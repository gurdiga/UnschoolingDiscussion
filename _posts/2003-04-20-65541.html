<div id="ygrps-yiv-699776843">Thank you for the feedback on the praise bit, most of what you have offered<br/>
I already do, so I guess I&#39;m on the right path.  However I do like some of<br/>
Sandra&#39;s suggestions about asking how she came to make/build/plan something,<br/>
to give her a chance to to explain and understand how she came to make it.<br/>
And it makes sense to give her feedback as if she were an adult, I&#39;ll have<br/>
to remember that!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Heather<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When my little ones bring me something they made that they&#39;re very<br/>
pleased with, I make a fuss over them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t do is tell them that if they make their beds and brush<br/>
their teeth every day they get stickers or praise.  They don&#39;t get<br/>
praised for things that I tell them to do in order for me to get them<br/>
to keep doing them, but they get encouraged when they do something on<br/>
their own that they&#39;re happy about.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the thing you don&#39;t want to do with praise is try to get<br/>
them to do stuff by praising them.  In other words, you don&#39;t want to<br/>
withhold kind, affirming, words that tell your child she&#39;s a<br/>
wonderful person until she does something that you consider<br/>
praiseworthy.  You want to make sure she doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s worth<br/>
more as a person when she performs a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
But when she says, &quot;Look what I&#39;m doing, Mom!&quot;, she&#39;s looking for you<br/>
to be excited with her.  If my husband painted the windows while I<br/>
was out and I came home and he showed me, all excited about the work<br/>
he did, he would be a little disappointed if I didn&#39;t say, &quot;Wow, you<br/>
did a really good job!&quot;<br/>

  He&#39;s also focused on making friendships through the activities that<br/>
  he is good at (or at least enjoys), like computer gaming, D&D, etc.<br/>
  Right now he is also finding that he can connect with older (16/17)<br/>
  girls. He&#39;s got a couple of friends who are girls right now. He&#39;s<br/>
  also always been better at connecting with adults than kids his own<br/>
  age.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for your kind words. Funny how I couldn&#39;t think of focusing on<br/>
her strong points.Guess i was feeling a bit funky.Molly is still trying to<br/>
find what she is good at. She has a sister (the hypersensitive one)who is<br/>
mega quick and finds every activity easy and is noticed by others right away<br/>
for her immediate skill. Hard on Molly.Her sister does not rub this in at<br/>
all but molly notices it none the less. We have been focusing on accepting<br/>
herself for where she is at.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Has she always been unschooled? Does she have any school induced<br/>
  stuff to get over?<br/>
<br/>
  Molly has been home now for 5 years and really unschooled for 2-3 years.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if she has stuff still to get over. I guess being put in<br/>
special reading and needing extra help always.<br/>
<br/>
  !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I like the idea of finding areas for her to use her body individually.<br/>
She so far loves rythmic gymnastics as there is no focus on others ability.<br/>
She has only been involved for about 1 month.She laughed with one girl over<br/>
a move they made and was very excited. This alone was social contact enough<br/>
for her. One girl is seeking her out .Molly is hesitant but we are working<br/>
on trying one visit and seeing how it goes. I am helping her with wording to<br/>
make the call.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Help her find her strengths and don&#39;t focus too much attention on her<br/>
  weaker points. Let her shine. That plus your support and love will<br/>
  help her remain Whole.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank You again. I sometimes forget about this.<br/>

&gt; My in-laws are right near West Palm Beach in Lake Worth. We go down<br/>
&gt; there, but not that often. Maybe once a year. I&#39;ll be sure to put<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; word out next time we go. I love meeting other unschoolers!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  My parents live about 5 minutes from Lake Worth.<br/>
Also about 5 minutes from Dreher Park zoo.  Dh and my dad took my<br/>
younger 2 to the zoo this past visit.  I like to go there just to<br/>
climb the trees there in the park.  I grew up climing trees like that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have gone to the Dreher Park Zoo and Science Museum and<br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; the Lion Country Safari. Our big find the last time we were down<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; the Morikami Gardens. I&#39;m not sure exactly where it was, but it was<br/>
&gt; within 15 minutes of their house. It was this fabulous acreage of<br/>
zen<br/>
&gt; gardens right in the middle of a bustling Florida avenue. Lots of<br/>
&gt; information on the former Japanese settlers and gardens in general.<br/>
&gt; Art work too. We loved it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Dad takes the grand kids to Lion Country Safari every Thankgiving.<br/>
The women go shopping that day. (We love Ross, TJ Max and Marshalls)<br/>
My mom has mentioned a garden that sounds like what you&#39;ve<br/>
described.  We&#39;ll have to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know next time your heading down.<br/>

Subject: Re: Praise<br/>
<br/>
I think it often has to do with the type of praise being given.  Truthful<br/>
praise, imho, can do no harm.  I also think there is such a thing as<br/>
overdoing it, though.  For example, pulling out the bells and whistles for<br/>
*every tiny little thing*.  &quot;WOW, you are the BEST child in the WHOLE ENTIRE<br/>
WORLD&quot; is great here and there.  We over did those type of statements with<br/>
our now 6 yr old and she went through quite a phase of letting EVERYONE know<br/>
just how incredibly wonderful she was at any opportunity.  That tends to<br/>
turn people off, even their friends.<br/>
<br/>
I take every opportunity to tell my children when they are doing something<br/>
right, nice, and so on.  &quot;Thanks for helping your sister with ________, that<br/>
was very nice of you.&quot;  &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for _____ all by yourself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even using gentle parenting techniques, it is so easy to pay more attention<br/>
to the &#39;bad&#39; things.  I think the key is to *catch* our children being good<br/>
and doing well and honestly comment on those things.  Offering unrealistic<br/>
praise *can* be detrimental to a child who *may* grow up thinking they can<br/>
do no wrong.  There *may* also come a time, further down the road that they<br/>
become fearful of sharing important situations or times of bad judgment in<br/>
fear of what their parents might think of their *perfect* child.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose parents treated her as if she were THE best child on<br/>
earth.  She became pregnant at 14 and went to her choir teacher at school to<br/>
confide because she was so terrified of letting her parents down.  She truly<br/>
believed that they thought she was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to say this extreme situation is normal or even probable in<br/>
every circumstance.  I just think we owe it to our children to be honest<br/>
with them and let them know that we ARE proud of them for their<br/>
accomplishments and will offer honest praise accordingly, but that they are<br/>
also allowed to make mistakes and that we will help them resolve their<br/>
mistakes and still love them regardless.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yr old made a rather large mistake recently and I calmly explained why<br/>
I was upset.  A couple of days later, she wrote me a letter, apologizing,<br/>
suggesting a consequence very appropriate to the situation and offered an<br/>
appropriate solution.  All on her own!  When I told her how proud of her I<br/>
was and how impressed I was and kept going, she finally stopped me and said,<br/>
&quot;Goolleeee Mom, you don&#39;t have to over do it or I might do it again!&quot;  Of<br/>
course, she was laughing but it was a wise lesson.  I LOVE learning things<br/>
FROM my children! :)<br/>

 Weird.  What good does it do for a baby to identify birds?  What good would<br/>
 it do a child in New Mexico to identify a cardinal, unless just for fun?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the program that guy started (you know the &quot;teach your baby<br/>
to<br/>
read&quot; guy) called &quot;teach your baby encyclopedic knowledge&quot; or something like<br/>
that.<br/>
I looked into it many years ago (silly me) and couldn&#39;t believe the<br/>
flashcards and memorization stuff they were pushing on little babies!! It<br/>
was<br/>
ridiculous.<br/>
All so the kid could recognize different birds, names of things and<br/>
definitions.<br/>
It&#39;s all about the parents, not the child.<br/>
They feel oh-so-good when little Johnny can show off his incredible<br/>
knowledge.<br/>
Only problem is, if you can look it up in an encyclopedia, why does the kid<br/>
need to memorize it at all? How silly.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;My daughter Kiele thrives on praise and I have heard two different views<br/>
about praise and how it affects children.  The first view being that it&#39;s<br/>
good for their self esteem, it gives them pride in the work that they have<br/>
accomplished or with what ever they have done.  The second view is that a<br/>
child who is always praised will only do things to please adults rather than<br/>
to please herself, to hear others talk good about her.  Kiele looks for<br/>
praise constantly although I do see the pride that she takes in her work<br/>
whether it&#39;s building with blocks or coloring a picture, however she looks<br/>
for my approval to see if I like what she has done.  I know that this is<br/>
normal for a 4 year old, but I was just wondering if giving her praise all<br/>
the time for everything that she does is good for her?   If anyone has some<br/>
pointers on this I would appreciate it...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course when a child does something they are excited about, they want to<br/>
share and get a response back. One that will make them feel good. I also see<br/>
the point of how praising just everything isn&#39;t good either. I watch what I<br/>
say and how I say it. I make sure to comment on how much work it looks like<br/>
went into that picture they just did or how I love the way they used color.<br/>
Something else beside just &quot;oh isn&#39;t that lovely, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; Making<br/>
sure I praise the effort instead of just the picture. I think that makes a<br/>
big difference. Not just the result but the process to get there. I think<br/>
that helps so much with their self esteem and not always concentrating on<br/>
whether the end result will be to anyone else&#39;s satisfaction. I do this with<br/>
all comments, or I should say I try on most. Even with something like<br/>
cleaning up the playroom without me asking. Instead of just saying great<br/>

me feel good and how much time it took them and how organized everything<br/>
looks. Hope this helps some.<br/>

I also wanted to add to my last post that if it&#39;s something my child did<br/>
creatively, like a picture or making up a game, I always ask them how they<br/>
feel about what they did. Sometimes they are unhappy with it and just asking<br/>
to see what someone else thinks. If that&#39;s the case, I can hear why they<br/>
aren&#39;t satisfied and help them figure out a better way or point out other<br/>
good things they may have not seen.<br/>

Yes, all I could think of was &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses&quot;.  Quite sad.<br/>
Some of the things people put these poor children through is just insane!<br/>
Don&#39;t you just know those poor babies are sitting there wondering how to<br/>
roll their eyes in the back of their little heads! &gt;BG&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw a similar program called &#39;teach your baby math&#39; or something to that<br/>
effect.  They have these flash cards almost a foot square with different<br/>
patterns of red dots and the baby is supposedly supposed to learn how to do<br/>
the four math facts by looking at random dot pictures.  Looks like a head<br/>
start to blindness to me!  I always wonder if those kids were the ones who<br/>
started those pictures you have to stare past to actually see the form<br/>
through all the muck.  Ah well, I&#39;m rambling again...<br/>

Sandra, When I tell my daughter she&#39;s &quot;stuck with me&quot; it&#39;s in the<br/>
context of we, her family, will not abandon her.  No matter what.  She&#39;s<br/>
come up with some rather interesting &quot;Even if...&quot; questions, and<br/>
sometimes that becomes a game, but it&#39;s also very very serious.  With<br/>
her recent query into belief systems (swim team locker room discussions<br/>
with a &quot;fundy&quot; teammate has triggered a rash of conversations!) plus our<br/>
current health issues (my cancer recurrence/current chemo & DH&#39;s<br/>
upcoming major surgery), the &quot;stuck with me&quot; has expanded into<br/>
discussing what will/may happen after death does separate us. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
We&#39;ve had some really amazing talks.  Yes, including running, suicide,<br/>
murder, going to jail, heaven/hell/reincarnation/etc, how would I<br/>
feel/what would I do if she died, she&#39;d like to live with Aunt P but<br/>
Aunt P&#39;s even older and what if she dies, wills & inheritance, oh my, on<br/>
and on.  Addressing a lot of things, curiosity, security, laws, her<br/>
sib&#39;s trials growing up (one legal name change at 18) and my own (my<br/>
father died when I was 4), what it takes (& means) to earn a living...<br/>
<br/>
Ann<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He tested us unbelievably,...my husband (ex-marine) finally looked<br/>
him straight in his eyes, after a major<br/>
meltdown on son&#39;s part, and said, &quot;get it all out, give us all you&#39;ve<br/>
got, but you&#39;re not going anywhere.  You&#39;re stuck with us.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I missed the original of this, but wanted to point out just on principle<br/>
that<br/>
kids are NOT stuck.  They can run or they can kill themselves.  I&#39;ve<br/>
known<br/>
kids who&#39;ve done both.  Trapping and holding them too hard isn&#39;t<br/>
guaranteed<br/>
to raise them to adulthood.<br/>

Subject: Re: Praise<br/>
<br/>
Too much gushing can cause the child to start not to really trust your<br/>
judgment, and so too much praise can prevent you from being able to honestly<br/>
praise them in the future.<br/>
<br/>
When kids were little and would show me something I try to think what I<br/>
would<br/>
do if it were an adult who was showing me some project or hobby of theirs.<br/>
I<br/>
could converse with them about it, ask them questions to draw them out to<br/>
tell me more about how they did it, and what the characters are doing, or<br/>
where they got the idea, or something that creates more understanding and<br/>
appreciation for me, and gives them a chance to explain more about what they<br/>
made/built/wrote/planned.<br/>
<br/>
Today some friends came over who hadn&#39;t been over for a few months, and<br/>
Keith<br/>
was showing them his yard project.  Then we ended up in the garage to get a<br/>
tool, and they saw his current wood carving.   Thinking back on those<br/>
conversations, as candid examples of honest interaction involving praise,<br/>
they didn&#39;t gush, they didn&#39;t use &quot;the poodle voice,&quot; and they didn&#39;t say<br/>
anything like &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you&quot; or &quot;This is WONderful.&quot;  They asked<br/>
questions about what kind of gate he was going to use, what kind of tree one<br/>
tree was, and about the wood, they talked about poplar wood and carving<br/>
patterns and what he could do to make his knotwork horse look less<br/>
dragonlike.  He told them about the bed he&#39;s making.  We talked about<br/>
medieval tents (we&#39;ve discovered a new Viking tent design).<br/>
<br/>
There were no kids around.  Keith was getting some very positive feedback,<br/>
but they were also drawing him out to teach them more about what he was<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was doing some painting last week, and using nail polish for some of<br/>
her paint.  We talked about textures and whether other paints and markers<br/>
could go with it or whether they chemically clashed.<br/>
<br/>
I ask sometimes if she wants me to keep something for her, or if she wants<br/>
to<br/>
put it up.  Sometimes it&#39;s yes, and sometimes no.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some parents say &quot;I LOVE this and I want to put it on the wall&quot;<br/>
when the kid might not be finished with it, or might have just wanted<br/>
someone<br/>
to say &quot;I like the way you wrote your name on that picture.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As kids get older, one thing they&#39;re learning from us is how to act with<br/>
others, and so if we treat them like other people instead of like kids, we<br/>
model respect and interest instead of just praise.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband shows me something he&#39;s making (or I show him something new,<br/>
like a webpage or a sewing project) we can TELL how the other person feels<br/>
about it, so saying &quot;How do you feel about this?&quot; seems to impersonal for<br/>
people who live together and can read each other already.  If a kid brings a<br/>
picture she doesn&#39;t like, wouldn&#39;t the mom know?<br/>
<br/>
One way I found to keep from just making mom-noises was to remember not to<br/>
say &quot;This is good.&quot;  I don&#39;t KNOW something is &quot;good,&quot; and it makes better<br/>
sense (and better communication, and conversation) for me to say &quot;I really<br/>
like this&quot; (&quot;I&quot; messages) or &quot;How pretty, especially the trees.&quot;<br/>

Anna ( my 13 yo dd) and I were just talking about preschool and daycare the<br/>
other day.  I used to work in a preschool, and it was just like you<br/>
describe.<br/>
  I loved being around the kids, but I HATED the &quot;make out your lesson plan&quot;<br/>
demands from the director ( who was really just operating under the command<br/>
of the preschool Board of Directors)   Anna and I talked about how totally<br/>
ludicrous it was to try to mold those little kids to such a structured day.<br/>
We talked about ways to nurture and &quot;take care&quot;  of 10   2 yos at one time.<br/>
How to handle &quot;nap/quiet&quot; time for kids who need and want to sleep and kids<br/>
who don&#39;t, meal times, outside time.. all the standard daycare routines.<br/>
Anna had solutions and ideas that were so wise and sensitive to children.<br/>
I<br/>
said, &quot;Anna, you are so wise, you must have lived 3 lives&quot; .. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I know that some parents have to work. They have to put thier children in<br/>
daycare. Everything   I have learned about children in my own experiences,<br/>
coupled with my recent embracing of unschooling, has confirmed to me that<br/>
the<br/>
Montessori method of preschool/daycare is the best alternative IF a parent<br/>
has to put thier child in an out of the home child care situation.  My neice<br/>
and nephew go to a public Montessori school and they absolutely love it. If<br/>
they didnt go there, my sister would most likely homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
As we discussed Montessori methods, Anna said that she wants to have a<br/>
Montessori preschool, and maybe even a Montessori  &quot;grade&quot; school, when she<br/>
grows up.  I am going to call our local Montessori school next week and see<br/>
if she can volunteer.  She is VERY excited!<br/>
