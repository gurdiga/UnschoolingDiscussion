&quot;I found vague references without history to three kinds of finger crossing:  <br/>
to purposely tell a lie (like the wedding vows in The Truman Show), for good <br/>
luck (when the wheel&#39;s spinning on a game show) and for time out in a game of <br/>
tag or something.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, in Germany it&#39;s considered BAD luck to cross anything. My <br/>
neighbors would show me their hands and legs when they were wishing me good luck <br/>
to show me that nothing was &quot;crossed&quot;. Something about letting the good vibes <br/>
or wishes OUT and not &quot;trapping&quot; them inside.<br/>
<br/>
Ask your German buddy about this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is rabid about crossed bats in the dugout.  Swears it will win or <br/>
loose a game. She&#39;s even marched into the dugout of a semi pro baseball game <br/>
her brother was playing to UNCROSS the bats.  The turn around in the game was <br/>
remarkable.  <br/>
<br/>
She reads a lot of German books and is fluent in German (or so she tells me, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t know for sure) maybe that is where she picked this up, because I <br/>
had never heard of it before.<br/>
