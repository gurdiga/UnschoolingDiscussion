 </span></blockquote>Actually Yahoo has been misbehaving for quite some time. (Or maybe just<br/>
misbehaving with this group?) I&#39;ve had a few people explain what they&#39;re<br/>
doing to unsubscribe by email and they&#39;re doing it right but Yahoo ignores<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t explain why anyone would then miss the message at the bottom<br/>
that gives them my email to write to if they have problems ;-) but it does<br/>
explain why some people claim they can&#39;t get off the list.<br/>
