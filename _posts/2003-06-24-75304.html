<div id="ygrps-yiv-80719811">Hmmm, this has been interesting and now I&#39;m hearing Joyce (whose opinion I respect a great deal), but I thot I &quot;owned&quot; my stuff.  I said &quot;I have yet to meet a Christian who can accept<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people as just people.&quot;  Me, just me, in my humble opinion, etc.  The ones I met are &quot;overpowered by&quot; and the ones I met (not the whole bunch &#39;cause I&#39;ve never been to S.C. or Hawaii) annoyed me. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, that aside, I like what you say Joyce - the large majority of the self-identified Christians are proselytising and I hate it.  But in talking about my beliefs, esp. about unschooling, it seems, here in Canuck-ville, I have had people slowly admit they are Christian and I find the malady is still there.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m stopping on this thread - letting it go - but I would LOVE to see an FAQ on how to &quot;own&quot; your stuff - and how to acknowledge the other person owned it.  I think Sandar was trying to help me own it with the spat with Deb from IL on another thread and here I tried it again.  (Damn! Now I&#39;m grumpy.)<br/>

  &gt; In my short life of 41 years, I have yet to meet a Chrisitan who can accept<br/>
  &gt; people as just people.  I believe that they are overpowered with the original<br/>
  &gt; sin mythology and belive we are all flawed rather than intrinsically valuable.<br/>
  &gt; They also completely subjugate animals as lower forms of life.  And they deny<br/>
  &gt; what seems to me to be the obvious truth of evolution.<br/>
<br/>
  Which makes it sound like all liberals are nonChristian.<br/>
<br/>
  Did you say you were in Canada? Are things that different in Canada?<br/>
<br/>
  Since you make the distinction between Christian and Buddhist/Taoist I<br/>
  assume you mean by Christianity the religion that encompases Presbyterians,<br/>
  Lutherans, Methodists and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
  And yet you mention their denial of evolution. That belief is only true of<br/>
  Bible literalists and they don&#39;t represent the majority of Christians.<br/>
<br/>
  In America it&#39;s a fairly safe assumption that everyone we meet is Christian.<br/>
  And yet Americans can be anywhere from conservative to liberal. So it&#39;s not<br/>
  safe to make the broad statement you did.<br/>
<br/>
  *Unless* someone lives in the Bible Belt. *Unless* someone is confining<br/>
  their assumptions about Christians to people who *tell* others they&#39;re<br/>
  Christian.<br/>
<br/>
  In the US people don&#39;t go around telling people they&#39;re Christians. It&#39;s<br/>
  just assumed. It&#39;d be like telling people they&#39;re human ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  *Unless* what they mean by Christian is fundamentalist Christian. And *then*<br/>
  the reason they&#39;re telling you they&#39;re Christian is because they&#39;re<br/>
  proselytizing. And proselytizing is part of the package that includes the<br/>
  viewpoints you mentioned above. So it&#39;s likely that anyone who proselytizes<br/>
  also holds the other beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
  So, how do you know the judgemental people you&#39;ve met are Christian? Have<br/>
  they told you? Are you aware of their religion because of the cirucmstances<br/>
  you&#39;re meeting them in. Christians you meet in a demonstration outside a<br/>
  Planned Parenthood clinic are not likely to be a broad spectrum of<br/>
  Christians ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By owning your stuff, do you mean that if others hear a thought that doesn&#39;t<br/>
make sense to them that they should accept that you&#39;ve come to your beliefs<br/>
with a great deal of experience, thought and insight and that they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
ask you to explain yourself?<br/>
<br/>
Won&#39;t happen. Not on this lsit! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want an opinion questioned, then it&#39;s best not to post it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll qualify that though. When we&#39;re talking about unschooling, it&#39;s<br/>
presumed that those who have proven that they can back up what they&#39;re<br/>
saying with experience, thought and insight can, indeed, do so with whatever<br/>
they say.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;proven over time&quot; people don&#39;t get to rest on that presumption, though!<br/>
They aren&#39;t &quot;experts&quot; in the sense that people should just accept what they<br/>
say. They still need to continue to make sense and be able to back up what<br/>
they&#39;re saying. *But* if someone is battering at them asking them to prove<br/>
every little bit because unschooling sounds so impossible to believe, then,<br/>
to keep the list useful for others, the &quot;proven over time&quot; people have the<br/>
privilege of saying &quot;Look, you&#39;ll just need to accept that I know what I&#39;m<br/>
talking about for now and read until this starts to make sense.&quot;<br/>
