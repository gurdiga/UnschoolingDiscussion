<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898299861">I thought a quote from a book I&#39;m reading was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading the first book, Shaman&#39;s Crossing, in the latest trilogy, Soldier Son Trilogy, written by someone I met about 25 years ago.  (you can find her website at Robin Hobb)<br/>
<br/>
She is not an unschooler or a homeschooler, although she had four children.  Her youngest is now a teen.<br/>
<br/>
This quote touches on the differences between appearing to know math and really knowing math and between rules and principles.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was good at math, but I was good at it in a rote way, just as a small child can recite &quot;nine plus twelve is twenty-one&quot; long before he knows what numbers are or that they signify quantities.  I could manipulate numbers and symbols accurately because I knew the rules.  Gord, however, understood the principles.  He explained exponents in a way that made me understand that I had been looking at a map of mathematics and Gord knew the countryside of it.  That is an inadequate explanation for such a subtle awakening, but it is the best I can do.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956286671">I really liked that math quote.   When I went to put it somewhere for others <br/>
to find later, I found this:<br/>
----------------------<br/>
 I saved this without keeping the name, date or place and it&#39;s been a while <br/>
so I honestly don&#39;t remember who wrote it at all. And I bet the author has <br/>
changed her thoughts, so it&#39;s a relic and can stand without credit. It was from <br/>
some unschooling discussion in 2004, and more recent comments will follow.<br/>
<br/>
-=- The reason this conversation is really bothering me, is because Sandra <br/>
kept responding with other points that had nothing to do with my one and only <br/>
question. (Her points are GREAT ones, and ones I in fact agree with, but they <br/>
are points about something other that my one question: Should I give my 4 & 7 <br/>
year olds that particular game? She never said Yes (and why) or NO (and why). <br/>
You might ask yourself if you were trying to have a conversation with someone <br/>
and they were skipping over your particular question, and making lots of other <br/>
points that had nothing to do with what you were still trying to talk about!!! <br/>
I&#39;m not wound up and defensive and angry. Although I find myself frustrated, <br/>
and now on the defense trying to tell you (and Sandra) that I agree with all <br/>
those points she made, BUT IT&#39;S NOT WHAT I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. That&#39;s all.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 A question like &quot;should I buy this, yes or no?&quot; isn&#39;t the kind of questions <br/>
others can answer very well. And if we did, we&#39;d need to say WHY we thought <br/>
no, which would involve explaining a principle. And with all of the best <br/>
answers, it needs to start, &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 If we answer questions with &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; and give people what they claim <br/>
to want, or what they think they want, we are chucking fish out instead of <br/>
providing information on how to fish, how to make one&#39;s own custom fishing <br/>
equipment and when and where the fishing is great. Unschooling can&#39;t work as a <br/>
series of yes/no questions.<br/>
<br/>
 Another principle at work. Helping people learn to find their own answers is <br/>
vastly superior to distributing answers on demand. And those who volunteer <br/>
their time and experience are not willing to hold other&#39;s hands for years or <br/>
months. They want to empower others. Empowerment is a principle, not a rule. <br/>
Learning to examine one&#39;s own life and needs and beliefs is necessary for <br/>
unschooling to work. When priorities and principles are coming clearer, such questions <br/>
as whether or not to buy a particular game or tool or movie or food are EASY, <br/>
simple, happy questions. That&#39;s why the mom quoted above didn&#39;t get the <br/>
simple straight answer she thought she needed. No one wanted to waste time or <br/>
energy sending her down the wrong path.<br/>
-------------------------------------------<br/>
(end of that quote)<br/>
-----------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people think they just need to know something simple, a rule, when <br/>
they really could use having a principle so they wouldn&#39;t NEED the simple <br/>
answers or more rules.<br/>
<br/>
That above and Mary Ellen&#39;s math quote and comments are both here:<br/>
