 </span></blockquote>Hi Brooke,<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m not the one to advise you because I wake up after four hours of<br/>
sleep, and that&#39;s it for me.  = )  <br/>
<br/>
Kava kava is a natural sleep aid.  It works for some people.  And if I<br/>
can&#39;t sleep, even for those four hours,  I eat raw onions.  They knock me<br/>
out!  I can&#39;t eat onions if I&#39;m going to be driving, they&#39;re that potent.<br/>
 I don&#39;t know if it will work for you, but you could always try a peanut<br/>
butter and onion sandwich if you wake in the night. <br/>
<br/>
There are some other natural products you could try.  Calms forte, is a<br/>
homeopathic product.  I can&#39;t think of the others, sorry.  You could<br/>
check with a natural food store maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Stress is bad.  When I was taking care of my dad during his final<br/>
illness, all I could see when I closed my eyes was his dying body.  There<br/>
was no way to sleep.  Maybe there are relaxation tapes, visual imagery,<br/>
self hypnosis?  Massage, a snuggly cat? ( dogs just steal your pillow ) <br/>
I used St. John&#39;s wort and Kava kava.  It didn&#39;t always work but<br/>
sometimes it seemed to.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387333551">It sounds like it&#39;s time for you to join us old-timers for an afternoon nap :~) I&#39;m in the same boat. These days I dream of taking a nap from the minute I get up and sometimes I even get the opportunity!<br/>

ps. If you drink caffeinated drinks you could try eliminating them, at least after noon.<br/>

Any ideas on how to get some extra snooze time? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read.  But some people sleep where they can&#39;t turn a light on to read.<br/>
<br/>
The first few months I had this problem, I was blaming my husband for <br/>
snoring, and my boys for making noise, and the house for having bad <br/>
circulation, and then I figured out it was me--I was going to wake up (REALLY <br/>
awake, and agitated) at 3:30 or so.  <br/>
<br/>
I took Estroven for many months.  It helped some, but not totally.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
go to the doctor for full-on hormonal treatment.  <br/>
<br/>
Nowadays  I do sleep all night, but it was rough a couple of years ago when I <br/>
didn&#39;t know what it was.  <br/>
<br/>
I once looked up menopause stuff and found a site from New Zealand, I think <br/>
it was, and one of their first pieces of advice was &quot;use cotton sheets.&quot;  <br/>
That is my most true thing.  <br/>
And I keep baby powder by the bed to put in sweaty places so the heat itself <br/>
isn&#39;t so yucky.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Massage, a snuggly cat? ( dogs just steal your pillow )  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a cat been stealing my pillow lately--sleeping up against or wrapped <br/>
around my head.  It&#39;s very irritating.  And sometimes he puts a claw in my  <br/>
hair.  <br/>
<br/>
I can go without sleep better than some people too, so my recommendations <br/>
aren&#39;t the greatest.  <br/>
<br/>
Would finding an extra-dark, extra-warm room to sleep in alone help? (If <br/>
that&#39;s an option, depending on your house, your kids, etc.)<br/>

<br/>
  If you&#39;re not averse to alcohol, I find that having just half a bottle of beer will put me right to sleep, especially a dark beer.  <br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t want to drink every time I have insomnia (since it&#39;s a whole lot), so my usual guarenteed sleep inducer to do a yoga shoulder stand.  About 3 or 4 minutes in the position and I can just barely get myself into bed before I fall asleep.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just be careful with the shoulder stand.  I&#39;ve had neck problems for years, <br/>
ever since I fell over sideways while doing the shoulder stand.  (No, I <br/>
wasn&#39;t drinking beer, dark or otherwise.)  It didn&#39;t hurt at all, so I got <br/>
right back up sideways.  The next morning I couldn&#39;t turn my head without <br/>
extreme pain.<br/>

P.S. I use guided imagery (in other words, I guide my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713829691">This one takes some time to learn but it works wonderfully well. I <br/>
discovered it by accident. I used to be able to fall asleep easily <br/>
with the TV on but had a much harder time once it was turned off. I <br/>
realized I was listening to the TV without concentrating on it, and <br/>
it kept me from thinking about other things that were keeping my <br/>
thoughts active and awake. So now what I do is listen to whatever <br/>
noise is there: crickets, the cat breathing near my face, my husband <br/>
snoring, the refrigerator motor, the water dripping in the bathroom. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter. I just listen without thinking about what I&#39;m <br/>
hearing. It&#39;s a little like meditation in that every time i start to <br/>
think about the noise (as in how can he sleep when he snores that <br/>
loudly????)I stop and just calm down and listen to the sound without <br/>
thinking again. Nowadays it usually only takes me a couple of minutes <br/>
to fall asleep, even if I wake up in the middle of the night. I have <br/>
a daughter that learned to do this too and it&#39;s worked well for her <br/>
also. She&#39;d been dealing with insomnia for a couple of years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875198054">Thanks Priss, I&#39;d totally forgotten my main way of falling alseep lately (I guess it works so well I don&#39;t think about it, LOL,) I use a sound machine.  I bought it at the pharmacy for about $20, it has an automatic shut off (so it doesn&#39;t keep me awake,) and has 10 different sounds to chose from (I live in a very urban area near a hospital, no crickets or birds, LOL, and there&#39;s something about the ambulance sirens that keeps me awake, LOL)<br/>
