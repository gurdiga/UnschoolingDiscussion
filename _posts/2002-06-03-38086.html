are programmed to not only send to everyone in your address book, they also <br/>
pick up addresses from any mail you&#39;ve saved, including mail from this <br/>
list.  Chances are, someone on this list has a virus, but they didn&#39;t send <br/>
it to you on purpose.<br/>

said it will search your address book, documents folder, and send out emails. <br/>
I DID NOT open the attachment. But if it got my name from one of these lists, <br/>
then maybe others will get it to. Again, DON&#39;t open it!!!!! I didn&#39;t know it <br/>
was actually a virus until i sent the first notice to this list. SORRY for <br/>
the off-topic posts, people, but I hope I&#39;ve helped more than disrupted :0)<br/>

Hi, I posted this on another list but I wanted to post this here for others<br/>
who may be new to viruses.<br/>
 The program is written to automaticvally reply to any saved messages and<br/>
the virus ricipient&#39;s address book. The &quot;sender&quot; may not even know that they<br/>
received it if there is no virus protection software on tehir computer and<br/>
no one who received it from them has told them. Some viruses even change the<br/>
name of the senders to make alerts impossible.<br/>

answer this: if it was random, why did it come in a direct response to a post <br/>
I made, and from a bad address? If it were the worm emailing, wouldn&#39;t it <br/>
have a new subject line and contain telltale text like I was reading at a <br/>
virus site? And why would it be a bad return address? Could the virus delete <br/>
someone&#39;s email address? If it came automatically from someone who got my <br/>
address from this or the other list, why wouldn&#39;t their address be listed on <br/>
the member directory, and as bouncing since the address is no longer valid? <br/>
Still seems suspicious to me....I have had someone respond to me nastily on <br/>
AOL before and they deleted there screenname so I could not respond. I wonder <br/>
if reporting this to AOL and yahoo has any merit.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160563905">Well, actually, it&#39;s kind of interesting. Those that make viruses are very<br/>
creative, wish it was geared toward something less destructive.<br/>
<br/>
1. It was a response from your email directly because the virus has been<br/>
told to do that. See...usually viruses send themselves to everyone on an<br/>
address list and only in attachments to new addresses. Sounds like this one<br/>
has been programmed into the email client so that it also hits new addresses<br/>
whether there is an attachment or not. It&#39;s not really that difficult to do<br/>
and I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve waited this long before hearing of it. Several of us<br/>
had already worked out this idea, but it was just a curiousity thing. We<br/>
didn&#39;t know if it would work because we aren&#39;t destructive enough to test it<br/>
 But I guess someone has figured it out. So anyone that person gets an email<br/>
from is likely to get the virus right back. This happened the other day from<br/>
my grandmother, but I thought it was coincidence. Did you virus scanner<br/>
catch it on the way in? Thank goodness mine did!<br/>
<br/>
2. The address may not be bad. I don&#39;t know all the details as this is the<br/>
first post I&#39;ve seen about it. But, the address may not be bad. Some viruses<br/>
have shut down the email client for use by the owner, but the virus itself<br/>
of course still uses the client to spread itself. That&#39;s on a private email<br/>
account. If someone is using like hotmail or something, they may have been<br/>
trying to shut the email down (they can trace those viruses to accounts) and<br/>
the virus is interfering with that. Between the two there could be a big ole<br/>
mess. I don&#39;t know if it could be deleting the address or not, I&#39;ve never<br/>
looked into it, I guess it&#39;s a possibility, but unless it is making new<br/>
addies as fast as it&#39;s deleting them, that&#39;s counterproductive to most<br/>
viruses modus operandi. Viruses are programmed to spread far and fast, it<br/>
has to have an email to spread from. <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think the virus is making new addies, but I don&#39;t know<br/>
everything. I&#39;m a hacker, not a criminal, so I don&#39;t usually go around<br/>
making destructive viruses. :) What it could very well be (what sounds<br/>
logical to me) is a criminal using a side system and making email addies for<br/>
use to spread the virus and then deleting them for a new one so that it&#39;s<br/>
not as easily traceable.<br/>
<br/>
Now of course, all of this is already known information with some conjecture<br/>
and alot of common sense thrown in. But it is all very possible and now you<br/>
ve got me curious so I&#39;m going to go play with the idea.<br/>
