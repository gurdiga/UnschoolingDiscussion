&lt;&lt; If I need to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and watch TV <br/>
<br/>
or play a game.. I have to insist they turn the TV off and get in the <br/>
<br/>
car.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For most people, I think it depends how old they are, and whether the errand <br/>
is crucial.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 1:36.<br/>
I started waking kids up at 11:00 so Kirby could go to work, Holly could go <br/>
to free lunch, and Marty because he was to go and pick up the video they made <br/>
of the Junior Police Academy.<br/>
<br/>
I needed to send a money order for a Ninja Turtle Sword I&#39;m getting Kirby for <br/>
his birthday.  (SECRET!!)  <br/>
<br/>
I made pancakes from scratch and all but Holly sat and ate some.  (She was <br/>
saving herself for free lunch.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty asked me to get him a copy of Attack of the Clones, and so after Kirby <br/>
was at work and Holly had gone to the park, Marty went on errands with me.  <br/>
Hastings (got the DVD and a Futurama comic for Holly), grocery store (money <br/>
order and marinade stuff for a party tomorrow night), talked about Marty signing <br/>
up for kick boxing or regular boxing or wrestling, and drove by a kick boxing <br/>
studio that&#39;s roller-blading distance from our house to check hours and phone <br/>
number.  Went to the  post office.  Passed by the park where Holly was, stopped <br/>
to see if she wanted a ride, chatted, Marty stayed to eat the free lunch as <br/>
it was one of his favorites, and hung out with Holly and her friend.<br/>
<br/>
We were rarely far from the house, and Marty was in possession of a new DVD.  <br/>
I could have dropped him off.  He CHOSE to hang out with me and Holly for an <br/>
hour and a half.  We were having a really nice time.<br/>
<br/>
If I had very often felt like I had to insist he do what I say on MY schedule <br/>
without regard for his own feelings, I don&#39;t think he would, as a fourteen <br/>
year old boy, choose to go on errands with me.  He didn&#39;t really need to be <br/>
there to get his video.  I could have and was willing, but he wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, parents DO have the legal right to turn TV shows off partway through, <br/>
and to tell their kids what to do.  And YES they can be unschooling without it.  <br/>
But when people come and say &quot;I want my unschooling to work like yours does,&quot; <br/>
and they don&#39;t really want to honestly consider WHY it works well when it <br/>
works well, it&#39;s frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Back to chocolate chip cookies, my friend Barb LOVES mine and says they&#39;re <br/>
the best ever.  When she wanted the recipe and I got to &quot;use real butter&quot; she <br/>
said, &quot;I&#39;m not going to use butter, I&#39;ll use margarine, but go on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She can&#39;t make cookies like I make them if she insists on margarine.  They&#39;ll <br/>
be cookies, but her request was for me to give her the recipe for the cookies <br/>
she had just eaten.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599904204">This is what is going on around our place the last few days.<br/>
<br/>
we have a handmedown foosball table in the front room, and we are <br/>
evolving a game using both pokemon and foosball elements<br/>
<br/>
Pokemon Foosball!!!<br/>
<br/>
You play a round of foosball first. Actually, no, you select nine <br/>
cards first, at total random from an upside down jumble on the table. <br/>
Then you play a round of foosball. Whoever scores, gets to look at his <br/>
or her cards and select by sight. The other person must choose a card <br/>
from his hand without looking. Whichever card wins (and I am <br/>
completely reliant upon my kids to know what THAT is! L good thing I <br/>
trust them, eh?) that person gets to shoot the ball, while the person <br/>
whose card was weaker, has to be still for the value of the card&#39;s <br/>
defense number, divided by 10. IOW, if it&#39;s a defense value of 20, the <br/>
&quot;loser&quot; of the pokemon draw has to hold off for a count of two.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we start the ball on the foosball table by propping the ball <br/>
between the feet of two opposing players who have been turned up, so <br/>
their feet form this little...tripod-ish thing. When you do that, and <br/>
both spin the rods simultaneously, the ball goes FLYING! That can be <br/>
pretty funny.<br/>
<br/>
Because the players on one team have yellow in their uniforms, they <br/>
have &quot;electricity&quot; powers, and the other team has red, so they have <br/>
&quot;fire&quot; energy. This helps when a card is drawn that has one of those <br/>
energies as a defense, or helps the other side, if that energy is a <br/>
weakness :)<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this fun? We&#39;re making up some more rules. This is katie&#39;s and <br/>
my game. We&#39;re going to play some more tonight. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690300226">We used a whole litre (quart) of bubble stuff today. We didn&#39;t spill it or <br/>
make big bubbles, this was a whole litre used up in dip and blow :-) Mostly <br/>
I blew and the boys chased, then they progressed to trying to bite them. <br/>
Much more fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think we spent a total of two hours on this throughout the day and all <br/>
ages (4 to 38) had fun. We did lots of other stuff, too, but this was a <br/>
really good dampish day for bubbles.<br/>
