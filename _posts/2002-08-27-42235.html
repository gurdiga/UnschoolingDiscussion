<div id="ygrps-yiv-424131936">I sent in my enrollment form to &quot;teach&quot; my 11 year old. I was told it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Michelle, the first advice I would offer is for you to get a copy of your <br/>
state law. What state do you live in? What does the actual law say you have <br/>
to provide? NHEN has a great link for each states homeschooling laws.  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/LegInfo/default.asp?id=241&quot;">http://www.nhen.org/LegInfo/default.asp?id=241&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>
National Home Education Network - NHEN: Legislative Information Main Page&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
Also A to Z Home&#39;s Cool has links to state and Canadian laws here.  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/directory/Legalities.htm&quot;">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/directory/Legalities.htm&quot;</a>&gt;<br/>
Homeschooling Laws & Legalities - A to Z Home&#39;s Cool Homeschooling&lt;/A&gt;  And <br/>
international laws here.  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aolsearch.aol.com/redir.adp?appname=MS&query=homeschooling%20state%20laws&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2egomilpitas%2ecom%2fhomeschooling%2fregional%2fRegion%2ehtm&datasource=Google&partner=Google&clickedItemRank=7&requestId=cns1672&component=websearch.google.http.tcl&searchType=MS&quot;">http://aolsearch.aol.com/redir.adp?appname=MS&query=homeschooling%20state%20laws&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2egomilpitas%2ecom%2fhomeschooling%2fregional%2fRegion%2ehtm&datasource=Google&partner=Google&clickedItemRank=7&requestId=cns1672&component=websearch.google.http.tcl&searchType=MS&quot;</a>&gt;Regional and World Wide Homeschooling - A to Z <br/>
Home&#39;s Cool Homeschooling&lt;/A&gt;  I have found that (sometimes) people new to <br/>
homeschooling, in their efforts to follow the letter of the law to the exact <br/>
point, tend to over state what they are doing to the local officials. While <br/>
this isn&#39;t necessarily bad, it does open doors for inquiry that aren&#39;t part <br/>
of the law. Here in Kansas, I fill out a (one time) statement of intent. <br/>
(there is no official homeschooling in Kansas, we register as nonaccredited <br/>
private schools) They ask for the *name* of the school. I could have put <br/>
*unschoolers* and risked needless questions. Instead, I put Meadowlark <br/>
School. Simple, easy and no one bothers me. &lt;g&gt; If you need help interpreting <br/>
your specific law, ask! There are many here who can direct you to local <br/>
support groups. And there are others, like me who enjoy reading and <br/>
interpreting law. My point is too much information can be just that, too <br/>
much! <br/>
~Nancy <br/>
<br/>
PS. I strongly feel that a period of cooling off from school would greatly <br/>
help both your boys. Give them time to relax, let them play and just be for <br/>
some time. Your kids won&#39;t *fall behind* as it is just them. There is no one <br/>
to fall behind from. KWIM? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431224477">What state are you in Michele? It sounds to me like &quot;they&quot; are trying to<br/>
intimidate you by complying with some set of standards that may or may not<br/>
exist. I would try and contact other homeschoolers, or even better<br/>
UNschoolers in your area and see how they fill in the enrollment form you<br/>
mentioned. If you don&#39;t know of any other home/unschoolers, a place to start<br/>
would be the unschooling.com message boards, and click on &quot;Across the<br/>
Continent&quot; for your specific state. Here is a link to that site:<br/>

<br/>
I would not mention to any authority or school officials that you are<br/>
unschooling. The less they know about the specifics of your day, the better.<br/>
I would be outraged if any school official told me my child had to stay in<br/>
school *until* a stupid form was filled out. That is blatant intimidation<br/>
and scare tactics. I&#39;m sorry you have to go through this to unschool your<br/>
child but you must stand up for your rights. Try to find some support in<br/>
your area. Sorry that I can&#39;t offer more specific suggestions.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

The unschooling.com message boards also have a whole section about<br/>
complying with state requirements.  That&#39;s also a good place to read and post.<br/>
