<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253724005">I know many of you already posted about your MB type, but I am a very <br/>
visual, big-picture type of person, and I would love to see how the <br/>
graph would look of this group.  I know the tests are sometimes <br/>
ambiguous in their wording, but I also find that a good way to <br/>
determine type is to look at the description for the types you feel <br/>
closely resemble you, and the right one should be pretty obvious.  <br/>
Maybe not the most scientific of methods, but if nothing more, it <br/>
would be a fun way to see how &quot;uniform&quot; our personalities are or <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a fun description page that I liked because it isn&#39;t just a <br/>
generic, &quot;good qualities&quot; one.  It has a little humor in pointing out <br/>
the less-desirable aspects of each personality type also.  You have <br/>
to scroll way down to find &quot;THE 16 TYPES IN FULL DETAIL&quot; with the 16 <br/>
types in blue, and click on your type.<br/>

message board and the conference :-)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m leaving the usefulness of the list to your fingers :-) Maybe it would<br/>
be helpful to keep in mind that if something is ruffling your feathers that<br/>
asking a question and saying you don&#39;t understand will result in fewer<br/>
emails than expressing how ridiculous something seems.<br/>
