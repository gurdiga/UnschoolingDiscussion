<div id="ygrps-yiv-635988638">I sent this to the list but I&#39;m not sure if it showed up so I&#39;m trying again.<br/>
<br/>
We live in NY and have to send quarterly reports to the school district. <br/>
Could anyone tell me what subject area these would fall under? Playing <br/>
collectable card games like, &#39;Lord of the Rings&#39; or &#39;Magic&#39; and  Playstation <br/>
II video games. Some things are very easy to categorize but others are not. I <br/>
would prefer not to have to bother with any of this but living in NY doesn&#39;t <br/>
give me much choice.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Hi Kathy,<br/>
I have a great list for these things in my home computer. I will glad <br/>
to send them to you when I get home. Please remind me in an email to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kolleen@...">kolleen@...</a>. I&#39;m traveling now and might forget!<br/>
<br/>
Also, sign up for NYHEN-support, the people there are wonderful and <br/>
will assist you with these reports.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of us use worldbook.com as a guide to what is the &#39;expected&#39; <br/>
cirriculum and then get creative in applying it to what was done.<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They have to read the cards, that&#39;s english.  The LOTR ones are about <br/>
literature.  Those games are logic intensive (I think - I only barely <br/>
know how they are played) so that could fall under math.<br/>
<br/>
Video games are each different.  I&#39;d have to know the games to guess.<br/>
