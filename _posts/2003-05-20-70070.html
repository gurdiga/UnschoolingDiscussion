&gt; at least to me from my perspective of having one out of four who does, who <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; currently 11 and unhappily growing up too fast for her own self, and who <br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; always always been my most private child so that sometimes I don&#39;t know for <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; DAYS that she&#39;s brooding over something I did or didn&#39;t do and often have <br/>
&gt; no <br/>
&gt; recollection. :::sigh:::  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Neither of my boys do. Never have---they&#39;re almost *too* generous and <br/>
forgiving! &lt;g&gt; *I*, on the other hand could not have been nastier or more <br/>
begrudging. I was a bitch. My husband,  Ben, has always been the sweet, <br/>
forgiving soul, even as a teen. No girls (other than me) for comparison. I&#39;ve <br/>
learned (and am still earning) not to hold grudges.<br/>

&quot;into&quot; team sports. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched my husband, after a really intense, physical basketball game,<br/>
smile, shake hands, say &quot;Good Game!&quot;---and then they all go have a beer.<br/>
<br/>
My instinct is to say, &quot;Shove it! You PUSHED me!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I tended to involve myself in solo sports: dogs and horses and swimming and <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
Genetic/sociological basis?<br/>
