<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429446955">Dear unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come back to daily digest after being on no mail for 3 months. We live<br/>
in Tokyo and dd and I were on visiting my family in Sao Paulo, Brazil.<br/>
First I want to thank every one of you for sharing your views and<br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you already know that I am a second generation Japanese-Brazilian,<br/>
dd is 8 yo and her father is Japanese.  We have been unschooling since 3<br/>
years ago and that I belong to this list since it was created 2 years ago. I<br/>
have not been able to keep up with the volume of the post of the list but<br/>
whenever I have a chance I read some of it.  Deb has been very kind to let<br/>
me know if there is a discussion going on that are very close to our way of<br/>
unschooling. (tks Deb!  We are back.  )<br/>
<br/>
We have a HSlers group here in Tokyo that promotes outings at least once a<br/>
week. We are at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org">http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org</a><br/>
.......<br/>
Dd can read and write in Japanese, but when she needs to read &quot;instructions&quot;<br/>
on how to do things, like applying for prizes advertised in comic books, she<br/>
comes to me or to her father. She says that there are too many words there.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of that, when she is reading on her own, she basically has comic<br/>
books on her lap. And there in Brazil she always asks me to buy her comics<br/>
books in Portuguese.  And I see her concentrated and laughing.  Once in a<br/>
while she comes to me to read some passages to her.  I have found that she<br/>
&quot;gets&quot; most of the contents.  She is not reading the words, she is &quot;reading&quot;<br/>
the pictures.  So I am lead to believe that &quot;reading&quot; does not have to be<br/>
only from &quot;letters&quot;.  Out there, there are many unschoolers that are not<br/>
reading the words yet, and yet are able to get/have the inf he/she needs to<br/>
live and keep on learning.<br/>
<br/>
I need to keep myself for pushing myself to &quot;help&quot; dd learn to read<br/>
Portuguese.  I need to let her develop, use fully all the creative power she<br/>
has to understand the word.  I need to make myself know that &quot;reading&quot; is<br/>
only one way of understanding/expanding the world around me.  too bad that I<br/>
give it more value/power than it really has, when it comes to the<br/>
understanding of the world around us .  I wish I become wiser and become<br/>
able to write down about the power of understanding/expanding one&#39;s world<br/>
understanding without relying on to the  written language; for the<br/>
compreension of it.<br/>
<br/>
love and peace</div>

<br/>
I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back!<br/>
<br/>
I have been really interested in hearing how your daughter is learning<br/>
Portuguese.   I enjoyed your post and your thoughts about reading.    <br/>
<br/>
You know Dylan has been interested in learning Japanese and does know a<br/>
little when he hears it.   He&#39;s been watching movies in Japanese to see<br/>
how much he can understand and it&#39;s more than I do, that&#39;s for sure.   It<br/>
would be easier for him if he could talk to someone regularly, a friend<br/>
close by,  but there is no one in our little town who speaks it.   He<br/>
can&#39;t read it, but is now starting to write a little, when he folds an<br/>
origami animal, he finds the name in Japanese and writes it on the<br/>
animal.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll lose interest before he learns it well, but he has enjoyed<br/>
exploring another language and it&#39;s led to so many other, different<br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
He now can say the names of many of the countries of the world in<br/>
Portuguese, thanks to you!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great to see you posting again!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77184719">Hi,<br/>
 I may have missed the post. Please tell me about learning Portugese. What program are you using? Brianna & I have been talking about learning Portugese, but there are so many programs. I&#39;d really like to discuss this w/ you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
Noemi, who is on this list, spends a few months in Brazil each year and<br/>
her daughter is learning Portuguese using the &quot;immerse yourself in it&quot;<br/>
program.    Dylan learned a few words from a HUGE world map Noemi sent<br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
No program, just life.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has learned some Japanese from the Power Glide language program.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re worth the money new but you can find them used<br/>
all over the place.  That might say something about their effectiveness,<br/>
I don&#39;t know.   It starts out with a kind of mnemonic programming which<br/>
seems to work for just remembering words.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s a thing we did that is really wonderful for all kinds of<br/>
things pertaining to another language or culture.   We contacted the<br/>
Japanese Consulate in Seattle and asked them to send us stuff.   They<br/>
did!  Books, magazines, a flag, brochures, articles, posters, all kinds<br/>
of things, and we now have access to their lending library of Japanese<br/>
videos, movies, books and books on tape, etc.    Very cool, all free<br/>
except for shipping one way.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933127285">Thanks so much for the information and the ideas! We live in East Providence which is a very Portuguese neighborhood, so we are surrounded - at least as far as being in the US! We&#39;ve looked at different programs, but there&#39;s money and then there&#39;s effectiveness!!<br/>
I&#39;ll call the Portuguese Consulate tomorrow. I believe we have one in Providence!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!!<br/>
