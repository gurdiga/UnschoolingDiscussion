<div id="ygrps-yiv-743897233">Just a story to share.  My mom &quot;spanked&quot; her first two kids.  Nothing<br/>
brutal &quot;JUST&quot; hand slapping and such.  After #3 and #4 came along,<br/>
something changed in her and things she used to spank for now seemed like<br/>
amusing childlike behavior.  #1 & #2 were also spanked by our father.  I<br/>
was about 5 when they divorced, he moved far away out of the picture. <br/>
#&#39;s 1 & 2 have anger management problems and #2 verbally abuses and<br/>
neglects his two kids and even after being divorced for 9 years can&#39;t<br/>
communicate civilly with his ex-wife on matters concerning the kids.  # 3<br/>
& 4, my younger brother and I do not spank our kids and have loving<br/>
considerate relationships with our kids and spouses.  We&#39;re not perfect,<br/>
but strive to live kindly with others.  Mere coincidence?<br/>
<br/>
I am thankful that I&#39;ve learned about attachment parenting and<br/>
unschooling while my children were young.  Do you ever think, Faith, that<br/>
perhaps God has led you to these sites to expose you to another way?<br/>

We are shut up in schools and college recitation rooms for ten or fifteen<br/>
years,<br/>
and come out at last with a bellyful of words and do not know a thing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;And it&#39;s not like before I took this class I didn&#39;t spank, and because<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of this class,  now I<br/>
do.  I have always spanked, and I was spanked as a kid (and I turned out<br/>
fine.) I think that this is one of those issues that will never be won on<br/>
either side, so there is no point in debating it!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
