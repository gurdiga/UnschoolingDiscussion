&lt;&lt; Thanks everyone for your words of wisdom!!! I don&#39;t have any &quot;unschooled&quot; <br/>
support except for you all!! My &quot;homeschool&quot; friends get me going sometimes <br/>
about my kids future! Thanks for setting me straight! I hope you all had a <br/>
great weekend!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  This struck me just now b/c I was speaking w/ my mother today. What does <br/>
she mention.......cyberschool for homeschoolers and how PA. is paying for it <br/>
and maybe my state ID. will too. UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why can&#39;t people <br/>
understand or at least stop bringing it up. First off my dd is 5 years old <br/>
and if I was a PSer and held her back a year they all would have nothing to <br/>
say. But b/c I homeschool everyone has an opinion. I know, learn to deal, but <br/>
it frustrates me so. Maybe I frustrate me since I am such a wimp w/ my mother <br/>
I can&#39;t argue this w/ her. I usually say she is 5 and right where she should <br/>
be according to K. Usually shuts them up. Then I may have to go on and say if <br/>
we feel the need for a ciric in the future we will seek one. Usually the <br/>
naysayers are satisfied w/ this. I can see or hear the relief.<br/>

       NICKI~ who is very PMSy and late to boot. GGGGRRRRRRR it is a get <br/>
outta my way kinda day. &lt;VBG&gt;</div>
