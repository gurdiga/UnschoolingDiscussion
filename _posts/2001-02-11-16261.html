<br/>
These are state laws, so it totally depends where you move.  Do you know <br/>
where you&#39;ll be?<br/>
<br/>
Americans as a class of people do NOT habitually carry guns around, nor hunt.<br/>
<br/>
There are some people who hunt a couple of three times a year and that&#39;s <br/>
considered &quot;being a hunter,&quot; because many hunts are by lottery and only some <br/>
certain number get to go, and a hunting license will only allow for one deer <br/>
per season.  Even hunting once in two or three years can be &quot;being a hunter&quot; <br/>
but for someone who&#39;s only been a time or two, that&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ve hunted.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So &quot;being&quot; is pretty sparse activity anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
I have friends in Wyoming (a husband and wife, 50ish) who hunt LOTS, with bow <br/>
for sport and with guns for food.  Every year they put on a feast and invite <br/>
their friends. My husband has been.  They&#39;re also cooks.  So they kill and <br/>
cook it themselves.  I have friends here in Albuquerque who hunt at least <br/>
once a year, and for them it&#39;s a guys-out weekend.  (My parents used to go <br/>
together, mostly, like the Wyoming couple.)<br/>
<br/>
People do initial cleaning out where they&#39;re hunting.  The animal is gutted.  <br/>
There are certain things that have to be removed immediately so the meat <br/>
doesn&#39;t go bad.  Someone else will have to tell that.  The liver is sometimes <br/>
cooked right then and there.  If it&#39;s someone&#39;s first kill, there are <br/>
traditions concerning blood and liver which will never affect me personally.<br/>
<br/>
Then, generally, the animal is taken to a butcher, packaged up and picked up <br/>
all marked in white paper packages.  Sometimes the butcher works in exchange <br/>
for a portion of the meat.  <br/>
<br/>
As to carrying guns or locking them up, it depends on the person and the <br/>
state.  Some states don&#39;t allow guns to be tranported except in certain <br/>
circumstances (locked in the trunk of a car AND in the presence of a hunting <br/>
license or membership card for a shooting club--that kind of combination).  <br/>
Some allow them, but not concealed.  So they need to be in a gun rack or in a <br/>
holster case visible to police if they pull you over (there are mountings for <br/>
holsters on the dashes or pickup trucks, and this is often pickup truck <br/>
related---my dad had a gun rack in the back window of his truck, always).  <br/>
<br/>
Some people keep a gun locked in the glove compartment, or in the compartment <br/>
under the passenger seat in a minivan.  In some states that&#39;s what you HAVE <br/>
to do to have one.  In other states, that&#39;s what you CAN&#39;T do.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico people can carry guns, but not into hospitals, bars, or polling <br/>
places.  So they need to lock them in the truck in such cases.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s a city cop here and when visiting a house in which the <br/>
people don&#39;t know him, in Colorado, he made a speech just inside the door <br/>
which was, &quot;Ma&#39;am, I have a handgun on my person.  If this makes you <br/>
uncomfortable, I&#39;ll lock it in the car&quot; or something very similar.  She was <br/>
really impressed with him.  He&#39;s an Eagle Scout, totally sweet guy. <br/>
<br/>
In the 1940&#39;s and 50&#39;s it was common (out here) for kids to go out and shoot <br/>
non-food animals.  Squirrels, snakes, birds, rabbits.  Some families didn&#39;t <br/>
like it and would say &quot;If you kill it, you have to eat it.&quot;  Some families <br/>
considered it useful in that it desensitized the kids to killing animals <br/>
(when the parents were from a ranching/farming tradition in which kids cannot <br/>
be considering cows and chickens and pigs as &quot;cute&quot; or pets), and because it <br/>
taught them to use guns so they could be hunters or marksmen.  Many of those <br/>
dads had just returned from WWII and were afraid of further danger and really <br/>
did want their kids to be prepared to defend.  <br/>
<br/>
In an urban situation, that mentality is different than it is when a family <br/>
lives in a house on 20 or 2,000 or 200,000 acres of land and that land isn&#39;t <br/>
shared with others.   The mentality of people in the western states, who are <br/>
ranchers in the Rocky Mountains, or who live in the desert with rattle snakes <br/>
is TOTALLY different from Boston, or New York, places where it is crowded now <br/>
and has been crowded for hundreds of years.<br/>

Virginia. Thanks for the info. Explained it all very clearly. It&#39;s going
to be weird living in a country where if you drive a little way, all the
laws could change. In the UK, the law covers the whole country which is
why Home education here is a doddle compared to waht I&#39;ve been reading
about different state laws.
<br>I guess I&#39;ll be keeping my mouth shut on the hunting thing as that&#39;s
a personal no-no for me (being vegetarian).
<br>As for unschooling, I follow the autonomous path with nothing resembling
&#39;school&#39;. I hear that it is much trickier in VA but I guess that as a foreigner,
the state education dept (unless they&#39;re super-efficient) wont find me
anyhow so I wont get bothered.
<br>Now the VA vaccination laws might cause a few problems but if life
gets too stressful, I&#39;ll just leave :)
<br>Thanks again for the info re guns and hunters.
