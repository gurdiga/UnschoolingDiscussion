HERE COMES ATTILA (Episode 93)<br/>
by John P. McCann <br/>
Sung to Old Dan Tucker. <br/>
Yakko: The Roman world was in a mess<br/>
       The emperor wore a...<br/>
YW+D :                       ...cocktail dress<br/>
Yakko: When in the year 441<br/>
       Came a guy, Attila the Hun.<br/>
<br/>
YW+D : Run away; here comes Attila<br/>
       Flee today; he&#39;ll sack your villa<br/>
       Run away; here comes Attila<br/>
       He&#39;ll swipe your hogs and then your pillo&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Wakko: Attila was a nasty king<br/>
       He and his Huns wrecked everything<br/>
       He lived by arson and the sword<br/>
       Invaded France &#39;cause he got bored.<br/>
<br/>
YW+D : Run away; here comes Attila<br/>
       Far away; go to Manila<br/>
       Run away; here comes Attila<br/>
       He&#39;ll steal your socks and then your pillo&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Yakko: I guess he had a thing for pillows!<br/>
<br/>
Dot  : To a wedding Attila went<br/>
       Looking sharp like a Hunnish gent<br/>
       He ate a whole ox, then ate two<br/>
       Then passed away, but so would you.<br/>
<br/>
YW+D : Come on back; farewell, Attila<br/>
       Ate three ox, and got his fill-a<br/>
       He wore shorts made of chinchilla<br/>
       His favorite ice cream was strawberry.<br/>
<br/>
Yakko: What can I say? It&#39;s not a perfect world.<br/>
<br/>
YW+D : Attila!<br/>
       Attila!<br/>

objectionable outweigh what good their might be. <br/>
