<div id="ygrps-yiv-307669325">Kama, I&#39;ll try to do this.<br/>
Good-The children are learning to express themselves and think for<br/>
themselves, I am learning to listen and change from my old controlling<br/>
ways.<br/>
Bad-I worry sometimes about are they really learning enough for passing<br/>
state tests, am I introducing them to enough subjects that interest them,<br/>
are they missing out on some big mysterious whatever.<br/>
Ugly-Bill collectors call since I&#39;m not working anymore and my husband&#39;s<br/>
business is slow, I don&#39;t have money as I want to spend on music lessons<br/>
and sports activities.<br/>
Good-Thinking of doing some housework for people for some cash,<br/>
self-teaching music books, free sports through public schools, husband<br/>
used to be a coach and has become more involved in teaching.<br/>
Bad-Grandpa gives 14y.o. d.s. a hassle for being homeschooled.<br/>
Ugly-Learning new ways of communicating with the children puts me at odds<br/>
with authoritarian-style husband.<br/>
