this WONDERFUL event continues.<br/>
Here&#39;s my opinion (FWIW) I think that the conferences should ALL be held <br/>
within the same month of each year. Monetarily, if one year it is in November and <br/>
the next year it is in April. I&#39;ll have to choose ONE. We need to save money <br/>
up out of our other expenses to attend and truly NEED that year of savings to <br/>
attend. Maybe others also have that type of financial considerations<br/>

    You are so right. :-) This year is so much easier to deal with the $$. I<br/>
put up a little $ each pay day. It was easier for me. When I realized I&#39;d<br/>
need to  go a day earlier, so I wouldn&#39;t miss anything &lt;G&gt;, it wasn&#39;t hard<br/>
to just add a little to make up the hotel $. It&#39;s taken all year but It&#39;s<br/>
well worth it to me and my family. I wish they all wanted to go.<br/>
    I&#39;m not going to get caught up on digests tonight. Maybe tomorrow night.<br/>
LOL! <br/>
