<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500731696">I have family that are truckers.  In one situation, the family travels<br/>
together in their own rig.  They love it primarily because they are at a<br/>
stage that they can be a bit more picky about where and when they haul.<br/>
<br/>
In another situation, the mom stayed home most of the time and the kids took<br/>
turns taking off on adventures with dad.  The boys are now grown and own<br/>
their own trucking company and are all quite close.<br/>
<br/>
My dh travels a lot and it varies as to how the kids handle it.  The main<br/>
variable tends to be how I&#39;m handling it.  We have 5 kids with lots of<br/>
interests and sometimes I just get plain worn out when dh is gone.  I find<br/>
that my sleep is a major factor in how the kids handle Dad being away.<br/>
