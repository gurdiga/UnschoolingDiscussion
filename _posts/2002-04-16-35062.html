<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The best tool we have is the delete key. Which applies to life too! Our<br/>
&gt; society is *so* overloaded by data, I think learning how to *not* read is <br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; important as learning how to read! :-) And also learning how to filter what<br/>
&gt; makes sense from what is just noise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We (listmembers) can&#39;t control what people decide is useful to them to<br/>
&gt; discuss, but individually we can control what we decide to read. We<br/>
&gt; moderators *try* to keep the discussion on the ideas rather than on the<br/>
&gt; individuals expressing those ideas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The best tool we have is changing the subject line - which we unschoolers are <br/>
apparently allergic to &lt;G&gt;. I&#39;m more guilty than anybody, probably, and I&#39;ll <br/>
try to do it from now on.<br/>
<br/>
My PROBLEM is that I don&#39;t read them myself, not the subject lines or WHO the <br/>
posts are from. I respond and hit reply. Since I do have a tendency to change <br/>
subjects in mid-post &lt;G&gt;, I really will try to do the subject line switcheroo <br/>
when I do. <br/>
<br/>
Then people can just skip subjects that they are not interested in -- the <br/>
danger being that people may NOT switch subject lines and it can get <br/>
annoying. I&#39;m on a list where the moderators do sometimes switch the subject <br/>
lines and then send a post telling everyone they&#39;ve done it and that people <br/>
might want to &quot;catch up&quot; on that discussion by reading the more recent posts <br/>
on whatever the subject line was switched FROM. (If that sentence made any <br/>
sense, maybe our moderators could do that for us, here too, if we continue to <br/>
be unable to handle it ourselves. I think we&#39;d all appreciate it.)<br/>

How about an automatic periodic reminder to do this? Would that be annoying?<br/>
Or I should say which is more annoying, the reminder or the unchanged<br/>
subjects?<br/>

I&#39;m on anotehr list where they set it up so that there is a tag line at the<br/>
end of every post that says, &quot;Don&#39;t forget to trim your posts!&quot; Everyone<br/>
remembers to trim, but sometimes forget the subject line.<br/>
SO,<br/>
maybe we could have one that says, &quot;Don&#39;t forget to change the subject line<br/>
to reflect the thread!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes - that&#39;s exactly what they do. Actually - you&#39;re not going to want to <br/>
hear this, Joyce, they sometimes go and pull all the posts on that topic and <br/>
repost them under the new subject line. That seems like overdoing it, though. <br/>
And people WILL keep responding the old subject line for a while, anyway, of <br/>
course. Not sure what the best solution is other than that we all just try to <br/>
remember to change it.<br/>

picture ad and few will see it unless they&#39;re interested in spy cameras and<br/>
such! ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595971815">If anyone is annoyed by them -- they can be killers on slow connections! --<br/>
you can turn them off by:<br/>
<br/>
Going to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Unschooling-dotcom/</a><br/>
<br/>
Click on Edit My Membership.<br/>
<br/>
Click on Do not convert to HTML<br/>
<br/>
And then save the changes.<br/>
<br/>
Then in your email program, find the Preferences (maybe under Edit?). Check<br/>
for Compose or Write or something similiar. Somewhere it should say<br/>
something about HTML and give you the option of sending out plain text.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if both of those are necessary but I&#39;m only getting text ads<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re reading from the web, you *might* be able to turn them off by<br/>
again going to Preferences. On Internet Explorer there&#39;s a set of<br/>
Preferences called Web Content under Web Browser. Under Page Content there&#39;s<br/>
a bunch of check boxes next to Show Pictures and Animate GIFs. (Other<br/>
browsers should have some options somewhere about pictures.)<br/>
<br/>
Of course that turns off pictures on other web pages too so you&#39;ll need to<br/>
keep turning them off and on. :-/<br/>
