<div id="ygrps-yiv-799056464">Thank you Mary, I&#39;d be very grateful.  I need something to show my children<br/>
when their relatives harp on us.  Sometimes they forget how hard school was<br/>
when the taunting and teasing and lousy learning methods got them down.<br/>

&gt; I honestly don&#39;t know how I got this paper. If you would like I can send<br/>
&gt; it to you personally.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m on a webtv but when Joe gets home later I&#39;ll have him scan and send<br/>
&gt; it to you.<br/>
&gt; As my son would say, &quot;How does that sound?&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
