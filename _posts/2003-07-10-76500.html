<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307793499">**Im in the valley, east of the Oakland Hills in<br/>
Concord, where it regularly hits the 100s and theres no moisture in the<br/>
air.**<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  I&#39;m in Benicia.  It&#39;s exactly 10 miles from my house to the<br/>
Willow Pass Road exit in Concord.  My kid still finds Krispy Kreme<br/>
donuts to be a fabulous field trip. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(I only moved here 6 months ago and our local South Solano HS group is<br/>
still tiny.  I&#39;m desperately looking for kids in the 7-11 age range, so<br/>
I&#39;m &quot;networking&quot; way agressively.  I *do* understand though that Rory<br/>
might be a tiny bit too young to be James&#39; new best friend.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s a teacher and off for the summer so we do more things<br/>
lately that involve dad.  (He has come to park days, but he&#39;s<br/>
introverted and doesn&#39;t exactly love it.)  We&#39;re planning to be at the<br/>
Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Walnut Creek tomorrow at about 10:30 to<br/>
admire the raptors.  However, I bet your husband might be intimidated to<br/>
meet crazed strangers that you found on the internet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you hooked up with the Trivalley Explorers Homeschoolers group? <br/>
They have a little park day on Fridays in Concord but I keep planning<br/>
other stuff and procrastinating.  I swear I&#39;ll get there some day!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464892224">Hi Betsy!<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re in Benecia all the time - Dan&#39;s mom lives there.  We actually went to the 4th of July festical thing they had this year just last Friday and had a lovely time.  The Krispy Kreme shop was a great addition to Concord - we got a dozen last weekend!<br/>
 <br/>
While Rory is too young to be James&#39; new best friend, LOL, he *loves* being around other kids of any age and I&#39;d like to get together some time!  I&#39;ve taken the suggestions from here to heart about seeing other home and unschoolers in action.  Dan would probably be a little hesitant to meet crazy internet strangers w/o me around to bridge the gap - but he&#39;s open and wouldn&#39;t mind once we all get to know each other.<br/>
 <br/>
The Lindsey is on my weekend trip list - I&#39;m not sure how much enjoyment Rory would get out of it at this point, but we&#39;re going to give it a shot.  We&#39;ve also been meaning to go to Habitot in Berkeley.  Supposed to be really cool for the little ones.<br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t heard of the Trivalley Explorers - how do I get in touch with them?<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, and feel free to email me offlist - I&#39;d love to chat more about local things to do and arrange a get together at a park or something.<br/>
 <br/>
