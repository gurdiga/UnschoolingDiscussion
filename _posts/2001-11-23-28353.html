<br/>
Well, no, wheat and other grains *can&#39;t* be found by hunter/gatherer peoples <br/>
in other than very tiny quantities. Grains are entirely an artifact of <br/>
civilization, and the reason for civilization was settling down to grow <br/>
grains. <br/>
<br/>
It can reasonably be argued that foods that require changing their structure <br/>
to be edible are not at all natural foods for humans. That eliminates grains, <br/>
potatoes, legumes.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of information on the web on ancient diets. A starting point:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-880562907">It could also be argued that meat and fish require changing their <br/>
structure to be edible as well. That our digestive system and teeth are <br/>
not the same as a those of a true carnivore. <br/>
<br/>
Whatever way of eating that makes anyone feel healthy and happy is <br/>
probably best for them personally. Maybe there is no one way for all, <br/>
because all bodies are coming from different backgrounds nutritionally <br/>
and ethically.<br/>

<br/>
I could be wrong, but I thought that learning to cultivate rather than forage <br/>
was what led to staying in one place, for the quanitity and the permanent <br/>
structures to store extra.  Not that there was no use of grain until <br/>
settling, just that the planting of the grain made the staying and guarding a <br/>
necessity.<br/>
