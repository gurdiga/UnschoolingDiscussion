<div id="ygrps-yiv-342074248">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked for advice related to health concerns in the past and I&#39;d<br/>
like to do it again now if I may.  I have a friend whose 2 year old<br/>
daughter has cradle cap.  Is this possible?  I&#39;ve never really noticed<br/>
it on this little girl before but her mother claims that she&#39;s always<br/>
had it and as the hair is growing longer it&#39;s starting to grow unevenly<br/>
and even patchy in some areas.  Does anyone have any<br/>
advice/ideas/wondercures to help us out here?  <br/>
<br/>
Another concern I have for this little sweetie (I occasionally babysit<br/>
her) is she seems to drink an AWFUL LOT for such a wee thing.  Every<br/>
time she is here I will see her go through 4 or 5 or more (?), 8-10<br/>
ounce tumblers of watered down juice in a 4-5 hour period.  Is it just<br/>
me or is this excessive?  She just seems to glug and glug and glug.  I&#39;m<br/>
sure as a result of this plentiful fluid intake she also does not tend<br/>
to eat much.  To me, her little tummy seems un-naturally swelled and not<br/>
just with &quot;baby fat&quot;.  To feel her abdomen, she is very firm to the<br/>
touch.  I have had some basic and vague discussion with the mother about<br/>
the girl&#39;s fluid intake and the Mom definitely agrees that little<br/>
&quot;Mikayla&quot; drinks a lot.  I&#39;m not sure how vigorously she has pursued it<br/>
with a doctor.  I worry about this dear girl as I know her life is not<br/>
an easy one.  I wonder if Mikayla may be experiencing some stress as she<br/>
has been in a lot of daycare situations for extended periods of time. <br/>
Her mother is single and works long hours.<br/>
<br/>
Any help, ideas, suggestions anyone might have would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.  Is anyone out there in the medical profession?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047487030">My eldest has cradle-cap still.  I&#39;ve never done <br/>
anything specific about it, to be honest.  and she also <br/>
used to drink tons of juice, which I worried about, cos <br/>
dh wanted &#39;em to have sugar-free juice and she would <br/>
never have plain water, so it&#39;s squash with artificial <br/>
sweetener...  I know, but he shops...  If she drinks <br/>
from &#39;sippy-cups,&#39; could this be a comfort thing?  Does <br/>
she have a pacifier?  I think it could have been this <br/>
with mine, cos she never had a dummy and wasn&#39;t <br/>
breastfed for long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026587164">Hi Sonia,<br/>
     About the cradle cap,  my children have all had some form of it at<br/>
some point.  More shampooing never helped.  The advice in What to Expect<br/>
the First Year is to use baby oil, massage into the scalp, comb through,<br/>
and wash out.  I did try this.  It only worked temporarily and was a<br/>
major pain.  When just left alone it would come and go, never bothered<br/>
the kids, and was generally gone by about 2 1/2 or 3.  I&#39;ve also read<br/>
that it causes no harm to the children.  I have babysat many children and<br/>
been involved in many mothers&#39; groups.  I have seen many, many children<br/>
with this.  IMO it is a normal baby thing.<br/>
     About the fluid intake, I agree with you that this will cause her to<br/>
eat less.  It will give her many unneeded empty calories.  Although I<br/>
don&#39;t think it will really harm her,  I do think it is what she is used<br/>
to and uses it for comfort.  Does she take a pacifier or have a favorite<br/>
toy or blanket that she takes everywhere?  You could try distracting her<br/>
with activities that keep her hands busy or try different snacks that she<br/>
can help prepare.  Of course, the Mom should discuss it with her doctor. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459561628">Hi Sonia,<br/>
<br/>
Cradle cap is something I have experience with.  Ds had it and still does at <br/>
5 if we don&#39;t keep it under control.  The first mistake I made in treating it <br/>
was to use creams and oils (don&#39;t remember what, but everything was <br/>
recommended by family as what they had heard was good).  Finally, I was told <br/>
by a doctor to use dandruff shampoo and to gently scrub the scalp, and use a <br/>
fine comb to remove it while the hair and scalp are wet.  This worked <br/>
wonders.  Within the first week, it was gone (under control).  Now, if we <br/>
don&#39;t scrub while shampooing, his will return.  I noticed a small patch when <br/>
we were having his hair cut.  I didn&#39;t realize it was the same thing, but <br/>
that&#39;s what the beautician told me.  She also said it was not uncommon (in <br/>
her opinion) for a 5yo to have it.  We had long since stopped using the <br/>
shampoo. The dandruff shampoo the doctor recommended was Selsun Blue, by the <br/>
way, but I&#39;m sure any dandruff shampoo would work.  He also told us cradle <br/>
cap was an oil based condition, so applying creams and oils was only <br/>
contributing to the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the liquids go, ds is a heavy consumer.  He drinks milk, however, <br/>
and not juice.  He has been drinking three to four gallons a week for the <br/>
past couple of years, and probably two to three gallons before that.  We <br/>
always have food available for him and he eats when he is hungry.  We also <br/>
give him a multi vitamin daily.  I personally wouldn&#39;t want him to drink that <br/>
much juice.  Juice messes with my digestive system (especially if I drink it <br/>
before a meal), so I am leery of it, but I don&#39;t really know if that might be <br/>
what is affecting her.  I have heard that most children at that age go <br/>
through a period where they don&#39;t eat much.  Ds had a very healthy appetite <br/>
at that age, however, so I can&#39;t offer any advice there.  I know many others <br/>
will be along with plenty of suggestions for you, though.   <br/>

Hey, nobody said this would be easy. :)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he does produce a lot of oil, but the amount of milk he&#39;s taking in<br/>
really made me think of allergies. There&#39;s many signs of a hidden allergy. I<br/>
suggest the book &quot;Is This Your Child?&quot; by Doris Rapp. That&#39;s what made me<br/>
realize my daughter had an allergy. But a big symptom is seeming &quot;addicted&quot;<br/>
to the thing you&#39;re actually allergic to. And with milk common side effects<br/>
are: cradle cap, athlete&#39;s foot, constant stuffy nose. Also &quot;behavior<br/>
problems&quot; and fitful sleep. And sinus and ear infections. He doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
have all these things happening for it to be an allergy. The only way to<br/>
find out is to totally eliminate the possible culprit for a least a week.<br/>
<br/>
good luck...Valerie</div>

It definitely sounds unusual for that little girl to be drinking that much,<br/>
at least from my limited experience with my daughter. Has her thyroid been<br/>
tested? That and the possibility of diabetes also popped into my mind. I<br/>
have no medical training so I could be completely off. Hope somebody has<br/>
good advice for you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264519403">I second the advice on removing dairy. When we took all forms of dairy out<br/>
of my son&#39;s diet, his cradle cap disappeared (he was 3 years old), along<br/>
with a lot of other problems that were occuring (stuffy nose, inability to<br/>
sleep deeply, sensory integration problems).<br/>
<br/>
Though I grew up on a farm and remember begging my grandma to just shake the<br/>
cream back into the jar of milk instead of skimming it off the top, I have<br/>
come to believe that dairy is really a pretty bad thing for most people to<br/>
be drinking a whole lot of. Esp. as most supermarket dairy contains BGH<br/>
(Bovine Growth Hormones). But I still miss it :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704888203">I have a friend whose 2 year old daughter has cradle cap.  Is this<br/>
possible?<br/>
<br/>
I noticed this at times with my son even after he was no longer an infant.<br/>
My doctor suggested I try something his mom had used, not medical school but<br/>
it worked.  Put olive oil on the scalp & message it in.  I then used a<br/>
fingernail brush & worked on the problem areas.  This solved our problem.</div>

&lt;&lt; Finally, I was told <br/>
 by a doctor to use dandruff shampoo and to gently scrub the scalp, and use a <br/>
 fine comb to remove it while the hair and scalp are wet.  This worked <br/>
 wonders.  Within the first week, it was gone (under control).  Now, if we <br/>
 don&#39;t scrub while shampooing, his will return.  I noticed a small patch when <br/>
 we were having his hair cut.  I didn&#39;t realize it was the same thing, but <br/>
 that&#39;s what the beautician told me.  She also said it was not uncommon (in <br/>
 her opinion) for a 5yo to have it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was my experience as well.  My little guy needed to have it scrubbed and <br/>
brushed off (with a baby brush) regularly.  I still make sure I scrub his <br/>
scalp real good (gently of course).  His hair didn&#39;t grow until we got rid of <br/>
the cradle cap either.<br/>
