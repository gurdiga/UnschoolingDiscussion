<div id="ygrps-yiv-287943743">Aaack, I&#39;ve heard of imaginary friends, but now my dd has an imaginary <br/>
teacher, Deborah, who holds classes in her room with my daughter and a number <br/>
of her, (also imaginary), clones.  Deborah seems quite rigid and dictatorial. <br/>
 Everybody MUST sit and color.  So and so doesn&#39;t want to sit and color, but <br/>
the whole class will get a prize if they do.  The class needs exactly 4 <br/>
pieces of paper.  No, I can&#39;t give them 6.  Deborah gets very annoyed if her <br/>
directions aren&#39;t followed precisely.  So far I am being fairly tolerant of <br/>
Deborah and her ways, merely making the occasional aside that she seems to <br/>
need to loosen up and let people do different things sometimes and not be so <br/>
controlling.  I dunno.  Am I doomed?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115236068">If she needs that format to practice what might be self-discipline as she sees<br/>
it, so be it.  So long as she is not imposing that standard on everyone else in<br/>
the house is there really a problem?<br/>
<br/>
I know that classrooms real or imagined seem to bring out the fascist/nazi in any<br/>
number of people.  Maybe its all those tidy rows?  Then again maybe it is just<br/>
having someone be &quot;The Authority&quot; on what is being taught.  Dunno either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944905100">Well, my two daughters loved to play school and still do. Funny<br/>
thing...often they have a real witchy teacher too (her name is Mrs.<br/>
Picksweet). They also have an old desk that they found at the recycle dump<br/>
and old exercise books, a blackboard...even, a bell to call the student<br/>
back to the desk. It is too funny. <br/>
 <br/>
One time I was wondering why (out loud , of course) ...and they told me<br/>
that in a lot of books that they have read the teachers and the school<br/>
situation is harsh. And my dad (a retired univ. prof.) has told them some<br/>
corporal punishment stories from his school years.  Also, they reminded me<br/>
that their friends tell them all the stories about their experiences in<br/>
school. Obviously the stories are not too happy. <br/>
<br/>
Make believe and play is important...right! MAybe this make -believe play<br/>
is just so far away from  their own lives that it is really the ultimate<br/>
fantasy play???<br/>

<br/>
what a delightful game!  had to lol at your daughters fun.  isnt it <br/>
facinating the images of school she already has??  you probably have an idea <br/>
of where she has gathered her images... stories, other kids, tv shows, etc.  <br/>
it is pretty natural for her to act out school even tho she hasnt experienced <br/>
it i think.  my kids did the same thing, tho they havent for a while now that <br/>
they are older (9 & 7.)  lucky she is at home and can be the one up in front, <br/>
doing the telling!!<br/>
