Hello!<br>
<br>
Just wanted to introduce myself quickly and ask a rather off the wall question. I&#39;m Amy, 24, SAHM to Accalia Grace, 17 months, and dw to Cory, 28, a mental health counselor at a juvenile training school. We all live in South Dakota.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m hoping somebody can help me with this. I thought of all people, this group might know. I have a few friends with toddlers who have tooth decay problems. I recall hearing a long time ago about some sort of black walnut toothpaste that did wonders for tooth decay. Does this ring a bell with anyone?<br>
<br>
TIA.<br>
