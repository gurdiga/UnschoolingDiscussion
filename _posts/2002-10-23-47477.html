<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322015121">For those who either believe child abuse isn&#39;t as prevalent as reported by <br/>
the rest of us, please read the following. There are more than just the <br/>
effects of physical pain to a child&#39;s person, there are the long-term effects <br/>
such as a predilection towards being an abuser when grown, early pregnancy, <br/>
drug addictions, the need for state support, poor academic performance, the <br/>
list goes on and on. <br/>
Myranda says, don&#39;t step in, its not our business, we can&#39;t know if the child <br/>
is being hit hard or soft, only call and report if you know the child is <br/>
being abused. But according to her, how can we know? It is NOT our <br/>
responsibility to be judge and jury. It is our responsibility to say, THAT&#39;S <br/>
NOT RIGHT! STOP! If we don&#39;t stand up for children, and they see us not <br/>
standing up for them, then how can we expect them to stand up for themselves? <br/>
According to Myranda, the child would say no, stop. I&#39;m sorry, but if I see a <br/>
child being hit, and that child looks into my eyes and I look away, the <br/>
message I just sent to that child is that what is happening to her/him is <br/>
okay by me, and my refusal to step in tells that child that they shouldn&#39;t do <br/>
anything either. According to Myranda, people who abuse probably just want <br/>
what&#39;s best for their families. <br/>
<br/>
I checked the references listed, for the first site, and all were from 1998 <br/>
or newer and most were from 2001 or newer.<br/>

Victims of Crime)&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Statistics: Child Abuse and Child Sexual Abuse <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An estimated 984,000 children were victims of maltreatment nationwide in <br/>
1998.Of these,53.5 percent suffered neglect;2.4 percent were medically <br/>
neglected;22.7 percent were physically abused;and 6 percent were emotionally <br/>
maltreated (U.S.Department of Health and Human Services, Children ’s Bureau, <br/>
2000). <br/>
The rate of child maltreatment in 1998 was 12.9 per thousand children in the <br/>
population (Ibid). <br/>
<br/>
In 1998,approximately 103,845 children were sexually abused;sexual abuse of <br/>
children occurred at the rate of 1.49 children per thousand (Ibid). <br/>
Five to fifteen percent of all males,and fifteen to thirty percent of all <br/>
females report some type of exposure to child sexual abuse (Brown, 2000). <br/>
<br/>
Based on reports to law enforcement,children under 12 constituted roughly 50 <br/>
percent of all victims of forcible sodomy,sexual assault with object,and <br/>
forcible fondling (Snyder, 2000). <br/>
<br/>
The results of the 1999 annual survey by Prevent Child Abuse show that 41 <br/>
percent of the parents reported having spanked or hit their child during the <br/>
past 12 months,38 percent said they had sworn at or insulted the child,and 51 <br/>
percent indicated that they had failed to meet the child ’s emotional <br/>
needs.Two percent of the respondents reported kicking,biting, or punching <br/>
their child,while six percent said they had hit their child with an object <br/>
(Daro,1999).<br/>
 <br/>
Children (ages 17 and younger) are more likely to be kidnaped by <br/>
acquaintances who are not family members than by complete strangers.In 49 <br/>
percent of the juvenile abductions,family members were responsible. About 27 <br/>
percent involve non-family acquaintances,and 24 percent were attributed to <br/>
strangers (Finkelhor, Kidnaping, 2000). <br/>
<br/>
A longitudinal comparative study of 1,575 people,908 of which were abused or <br/>
neglected in childhood,and the remainder of which were the control <br/>
group,shows that the abuse/neglected group scored significantly lower on an <br/>
IQ scale,held significantly more menial and semiskilled jobs, had 1.6 times <br/>
higher odds of committing crimes as adults,and were significantly more likely <br/>
to have attempted asuicide and developed antisocial personality disorders <br/>
(Widom, 2000).  <br/>

 &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.yesican.org/statisticsCA.html&quot;">http://www.yesican.org/statisticsCA.html&quot;</a>&gt;CHILD ABUSE STATISTICS&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
CHILD ABUSE In 1999, an estimated 3,244,000 children were reported to Child <br/>
Protective Services (CPS) agencies as alleged victims of child maltreatment.  <br/>
Child abuse reports have maintained a steady growth for the past ten years, <br/>
with the total number of reports nationwide increasing 45% since 1987 (Nation <br/>
Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse (NCPCA) 2000 Annual Fifty State <br/>
Survey). Neglect represents the most common type of reported and <br/>
substantiated form of maltreatment.  In 1996, 25 states provided the <br/>
following breakdown for reported cases: 62% involved neglect, 25% physical <br/>
abuse, 7% sexual abuse, 3% emotional maltreatment and 4% other.  For <br/>
substantiated cases, 31 states gave the following breakdowns: 60% neglect, <br/>
23% physical, 9% sexual, 4% emotional maltreatment and 5% other (NCPCA&#39;s 1996 <br/>
Annual Fifty State Survey). In 1999, an estimated 1,401 child abuse and <br/>
neglect related fatalities were confirmed by CPS agencies, nearly 4 every day<br/>
.  Since 1985, the rate of child abuse fatalities has increased by 39%.  <br/>
Based on these numbers, more than three children die each day as a result of <br/>
child abuse or neglect (NCPCA&#39;s 1996 Annual Fifty State Survey).  According <br/>
to information from at least 18 states that were able to report the type of <br/>
maltreatment which caused the child&#39;s death for at least one of the past <br/>
three years. Approximately 54% of the deaths were due to physical abuse while <br/>
43% resulted from neglect. Young children remain at high risk for loss of <br/>
life. Based on data from all three years, this study found 82% of these <br/>
children were under the age of five while an alarming 42% were under the age <br/>
of one at the time of their death (NCPCA&#39;s 1996 Annual Fifty State Survey).<br/>
The U.S. Advisory Board reported that near fatal abuse and neglect each year <br/>
leave &quot;18,000 permanently disabled children, tens of thousands of victims <br/>
overwhelmed by lifelong psychological trauma, thousands of traumatized <br/>
siblings and family members, and thousands of near-death survivors who, as <br/>
adults, continue to bear the physical and psychological scars. Some may turn <br/>
to crime or domestic violence or become abusers themselves (U.S. Advisory <br/>
Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, 1995 report, A National&#39;s Shame.)&quot;The Third <br/>
National Incidence Study (NIS-3) of child maltreatment released by the <br/>
National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) in the fall of 1996.The <br/>
NIS is congressionally mandated under the Child Abuse Prevention and <br/>
Treatment Act (CAPTA). The NIS collects data on children who were <br/>
investigated by child protective services (CPS) agencies and on children seen <br/>
by community professionals who were not reported to CPS or who were screened <br/>
out by CPS without investigation. The NIS studies have been published on data <br/>
collected in 1979 (NIS-1), in 1986 (NIS-2), and in 1993 (NIS-3).The NIS uses <br/>
two definitions of child maltreatment: the Harm Standard, under which <br/>
children are counted as maltreated only if they have already experienced <br/>
demonstrable harm; and the Endangerment Standard, under which children are <br/>
counted if they have experienced maltreatment that puts them at risk of <br/>
demonstrable harm. The NIS-3 gathered data from a nationally representative <br/>
sample of 5,612 community professionals in 842 agencies serving 42 <br/>
counties.Finding of the NIS-3:<br/>
The estimated number of children seriously injured by all forms of <br/>
maltreatment quadrupled between 1986 and 1993, from 141,700 to 565,000 (a <br/>
299% increase). <br/>
Considering the Harm Standard: <br/>
The estimated number of sexually abused children increased 83%; <br/>
The number of physically neglected children rose 102%; <br/>
There was a 333 % increase in the estimated number of emotionally neglected <br/>
children; and <br/>
The estimated number of physically abused children rose 42%.<br/>
CPS investigated only 28% of children whose maltreatment met the Harm <br/>
Standard. <br/>
Although the percentage of children whose abuse or neglect was investigated <br/>
declined, the actual number of children investigated remained constant. <br/>
CPS investigated only 26 percent of the seriously injured and 26 percent of <br/>
the moderately injured children. <br/>
Girls are sexually abused three times more often than boys. <br/>
 Boys are at a greater risk of serious injury and of emotional neglect than <br/>
are girls. <br/>
 The incidence of fatally injured girls declined slightly, while the <br/>
incidence of fatally injured boys rose. <br/>
 Found no race differences in maltreatment incidence. <br/>
 Poverty is significantly related to incidence rates in nearly every category <br/>
of maltreatment. Compared to children whose families earned $30,000 or more, <br/>
children in families with annual incomes below $15,000 were: <br/>
More than 22 times more likely to experience maltreatment under the Harm <br/>
Standard and 25 times more likely under the Endangerment Standard. <br/>
More than 44 times more likely to be neglected, by either definitional <br/>
standard. <br/>
Over 22 times more likely to be seriously injured using either definitional <br/>
standard. <br/>
60 times more likely to die from maltreatment under the Harm <br/>
Standard.(Executive Summary of the Third National Incidence Study of Child <br/>
Abuse and Neglect, September 1996 and Reid, T. (1996). News NIS-3 Data. APSAC <br/>
Advisor, 9 (3).) <br/>
Children whose parents abuse drugs or alcohol are put at a greater risk for <br/>
violent victimization (National Commission on Children, 1993). <br/>
With the exception of homicide, children and youths suffer more victimization <br/>
than do adults in virtually every category, including physical abuse, sibling <br/>
assault, bullying, sexual abuse, and rape (American Psychological Association <br/>
Commission on Violence and Youth, 1993). <br/>
It is estimated that children with disabilities are 4 to 10 times more <br/>
vulnerable to sexual abuse than their non-disabled peers (National Resource <br/>
Center on Child Sexual Abuse, 1992). <br/>
In over 9000 divorces in 12 states, child sexual abuse allegations were made <br/>
in less then 2% of contested divorces involving child custody (Association of <br/>
Family Conciliation Courts, 1990). Survivors:It is estimated that there are <br/>
60 million survivors of childhood sexual abuse in America today (Forward, <br/>
1993)Long term effects of child abuse include fear, anxiety, depression, <br/>
anger, hostility, inappropriate sexual behavior, poor self esteem, tendency <br/>
toward substance abuse and difficulty with close relationships (Browne & <br/>
Finkelhor, 1986). <br/>
Clinical findings of adult victims of sexual abuse include problems in <br/>
interpersonal relationships associated with an underlying mistrust. <br/>
Generally, adult victims of incest have a severely strained relationship with <br/>
their parents that is marked by feelings of mistrust, fear, ambivalence, <br/>
hatred, and betrayal. These feelings may extend to all family members (Tsai <br/>
and Wagner, 1978). <br/>
Guilt is experienced by almost all victims (Tsai and Wagner, 1978). <br/>
If a child victim does not resolve the trauma, sexuality may become an area <br/>
of adult conflict (Courtois & Watts, 1982). <br/>
Adults who viewed domestic violence in the home as children have a greater <br/>
difficulty holding hobs, maintaining relationships with their peers and have <br/>
a higher risk of developing mental health disorders (Patterson, 1992). <br/>
Men appear to be prone to blame themselves for any sexual abuse they may have <br/>
experienced as children (Mendel, 1993.) Abusers:The typical child sex <br/>
offender molests an average of 117 children, most of who do not report the <br/>
offence (National Institute of Mental Health, 1988).It is estimated that <br/>
approximately 71 % of child sex offenders are under 35 and knew the victim at <br/>
least causally. About 80 % of these individuals fall within normal <br/>
intelligence ranges; 59% gain sexual access to their victims through, <br/>
seduction or enticement (Burgess & Groth, 1984).Stress indicators such as <br/>
unrealistic expectations of a child, unemployment and low self-esteem are <br/>
important characteristics in perpetrators of child abuse (Health & Human <br/>
Services, 1993).Approximately 60 % of the male survivors samples report at <br/>
least one of their perpetrators to be female (Mendel, 1993).<br/>

THAT is why I get worried when people make the blanket statement &quot;No one <br/>
knows your child as well as you do!&quot;  Because too many parents don&#39;t know <br/>
enough about child development and what is normal to have an awareness of <br/>
what children are and aren&#39;t capable of understanding or doing or learning at <br/>
various ages.  And so a five year old who can&#39;t stay dry all night and read <br/>
when the parent TELLS him &quot;Sound it out!&quot; gets spanked.  When he should be <br/>
hugged and played with and praised, he gets told he&#39;s bad, disobedient, and <br/>
then gets hit.<br/>

  ** Yes, most parents want what is best for their kids. That was my original statement, it hasn&#39;t changed, and I still stand by it. It doesn&#39;t matter who you do or do not want to include as a &quot;parent&quot;, MOST parents want what is best for their kids. Plain and simple. <br/>
<br/>
   And to top it all off, we just <br/>
  have to have faith.<br/>
<br/>
  ** Nope, you don&#39;t have to. No one has to. It would be wonderful though.<br/>
<br/>
   Oh gee. Well, that&#39;s just great. Thanks for your ever <br/>
  enlightening on again off again ideas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139688461"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; THAT is why I get worried when people make the blanket statement &quot;No one <br/>
&gt; knows your child as well as you do!&quot;  Because too many parents don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; enough about child development and what is normal to have an awareness of <br/>
&gt; what children are and aren&#39;t capable of understanding or doing or learning at <br/>
&gt; various ages.  And so a five year old who can&#39;t stay dry all night and read <br/>

Yesterday I saw a three year old girl at a thrift store with her mom and her<br/>
mom&#39;s boyfriend. She was right next to me when he came up behind her (a big<br/>
guy about 6&#39; 4&quot;) in a cape with a monster mask and yelled &quot;Boo&quot; at her as loud<br/>
as he could. She had tears running down her face. She cried and cried and he<br/>
just walked back to the costume section where he put on another mask. I<br/>
finally patted her on the back and gave her a toy to look at. She had subsided<br/>
down to muffled sobs when he came *back* in a different costume and scared her<br/>
again. Her mom finally showed up and when I asked if scaring her to tears once<br/>
wasn&#39;t maybe enough she ignored me and proceeded to tell her little girl that<br/>
she was &quot;so silly&quot; and &quot;not really crying&quot; and &quot;what a fuss about nothing<br/>
little crybaby&quot; for the next ten minutes while the girl kept crying. Geeze<br/>
Louise. How hard is is to figure out that a 3 year old maybe can&#39;t handle<br/>
that? Maybe a six or a seven year old might like being scared but scared to<br/>
tears?<br/>

Myranda,<br/>
<br/>
But you have changed what has been said and that&#39;s why some of us are very <br/>
confused. We remember what you have said previoulsy and maybe you don&#39;t. You <br/>
said your child goes over to your parents house every Sunday and that he <br/>
usually has a banana because they are there on the counter. Now I remember <br/>
you saying that your child understands what he can&#39;t have and has no problem <br/>
with not having certain foods. So having a banana that is sitting there <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense. Then it wasn&#39;t usually him having one but having one <br/>
every 8 weeks. That&#39;s not usually when they are there once a week. The he <br/>
was being offered banana&#39;s and doing great considering his age and someone <br/>
tempting (my own word) him. Then he&#39;s not actually &quot;at&quot; their house but out <br/>
with them. No wonder we&#39;re all confused. You just don&#39;t want to seem to <br/>
acknowledge that your stories are changing.<br/>

<br/>
That poor little kid. Good for you in saying something. Last weekend when we <br/>
took the kids to the church carnival, we were waiting in line for a dragon <br/>
roller coaster ride for the kids. There was this little boy maybe about 3 <br/>
that was sitting by himself and just terrified after the ride had started. <br/>
He was crying in such distress and stupid ass mom was just laughing away and <br/>
waving at him. I yelled out that the little kid was obviously not having a <br/>
good time and they needed to get him off. I really don&#39;t care if she asked <br/>
the operator to stop because she was embarrassed or not. She had them stop <br/>
the ride and then got him off. Other parents around were looking at me like <br/>
they couldn&#39;t believe I would say something, yet they all chimed in and <br/>
agreed with me. Maybe by saying something and letting others hear it, they <br/>
will get the guts themselves to say something if they see it.<br/>
<br/>
Also the same night, there were two kids that trampled through a line of us <br/>
waiting for a ride. One of those trampled was my Sierra who started to cry. <br/>
She got jostled quite violently and also stepped on. The boys were chasing <br/>
each other and maybe about 9. I grabbed them and then my husband took care <br/>
of the situation and the one kid apologized. All the parents just stood <br/>
around and looked while their kids were at risk too. Too many problems are <br/>
because people DON&#39;T say anything.<br/>
<br/>
And on that ride, when our kids got on, the operator was making the kids put <br/>
up their arms when the ride dropped down. Sierra would on the way up, but <br/>
grabbed a hold of the bar on the way down. The operator, trying to be funny, <br/>
said she wasn&#39;t going to operate the ride anymore unless everyone put up <br/>
their hands. Sierra had an odd look on her face and I knew she didn&#39;t want <br/>
to do it but didn&#39;t want to speak up either. I stood right next to the lady <br/>
and looked right at Sierra and loudly said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to put your <br/>
hands up just because she tells you to.&quot;&quot; The lady left her alone the rest <br/>
of the night.<br/>
