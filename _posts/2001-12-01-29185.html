<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713546671">I joined this list a few days ago because I thought it could be <br/>
interesting to get more unschooling info from such a huge and <br/>
established list. I also joined the new list to because it sounded <br/>
interesting too. I really like them both. I am too new to know anything <br/>
really about the dynamics of the list or why is split and honestly that <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter to me. I think there&#39;s so much great info here that I&#39;m <br/>
really interested. I have enjoyed lurking and reading the really <br/>
interesting posts about all aspects of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I admit that I am sad that my friend kathy b. has taken up so much time <br/>
and negative energy into this list. It feels like she&#39;s continuing a <br/>
fight that should not be there. She is impulsive in many ways. Not <br/>
excusing her because I am not in charge of her. It&#39;s just that she can <br/>
get all upset and hurt by things that are not her problem. Sometimes <br/>
she doesn&#39;t know how to let go and put out good things instead. She has <br/>
some good ideas, but is not always best at leaving others to their <br/>
beliefs. I&#39;m not saying this right, because she is my friend. I don&#39;t <br/>
agree with everything she says or does, nor she with me, but that&#39;s <br/>
what friends are sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this morning when I was online checking my mail, she came by. I <br/>
got busy with something and she was reading this list which is fine. <br/>
Then I read some, and realized she posted while I was still logged on <br/>
as me. She apologized that she didn&#39;t even think about the email thing, <br/>
but I just wanted you all to know that.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to lurk and learn from all of you. I don&#39;t have much to <br/>
contribute yet because I am so new to all of this. I will be away from <br/>
my computer for a few weeks soon, so if I don&#39;t respond to things, I&#39;m <br/>
not ignoring you. <br/>
<br/>
may your life be filled with joy<br/>

was nothing I could say about the issue because others here have <br/>
predetermined ideas about me and what I really mean.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
she is &quot;continuing a fight&quot; - I think she is &quot;discussing an issue&quot; <br/>
and doing so very rationally and sincerely.  Those who disagree would <br/>
do well to reread what she has said.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow Bridget, <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for such a kind thing to say. I am embarrassed that I <br/>
accidentally brought Makana into this. She is such a sweetheart, and <br/>
has her hands full at the moment. I really will calm down <br/>
now because I finally see that there are those who think one thing, and <br/>
those who think something else, and that is very normal. The folks who <br/>
questioned my character on this public forum <br/>
have revealed theirs as well, and that&#39;s ok. We are all different. Good <br/>
thing too. How boring it would be to have everyone agree with you all <br/>
the time, and not question anything. Or even <br/>
worse to assume that they themselves are wrong about what they think <br/>
because they &quot;don&#39;t get it yet&quot;. Anyway, I&#39;ll settle down for awhile <br/>
because I have to help a friend out and we have alot <br/>
to get done before wednesday.<br/>
