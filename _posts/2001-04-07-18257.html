<div id="ygrps-yiv-391136523">This is a subject slide.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think anually there are maybe 100 cases. So say,<br/>
two a state.  Most of the abductions are custody cases. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Speaking from a state with 1.6 million people or so, we&#39;re not due our two <br/>
per year from those stats.   <br/>
<br/>
We have more missing teens girls, and it&#39;s hard to impossible to say which of <br/>
those were runaways or date-gone-very-wrong things, as opposed to <br/>
drive-by-and-grab.<br/>
<br/>
I try sometimes and fail to imagine how I would cope with the mysterious loss <br/>
of a child.   <br/>
<br/>
My kids have a friend who ran away (he&#39;s here at the moment, having spent the <br/>
night along with some others from the anime club which meets almost all night <br/>
Fridays at an anime shop nearby).  He&#39;s also a homeschooler.  When I knew he <br/>
was not where his mom thought he should be (one busy Saturday six or seven <br/>
weeks ago), my first priority was to find out whether he was okay and what <br/>
his intentions were.  I threatened a kid with police coming to ask her if she <br/>
didn&#39;t give me a phone number I needed.  Within half an hour I knew several <br/>
places where he wasn&#39;t, I knew he had been delivered to a shelter, and that <br/>
he was safe.  I told the mom he was safe at a shelter without giving her the <br/>
other information.   <br/>
<br/>
It was two days before his 17th birthday and she was treating him like he was <br/>
ten.  I had suggested earlier the same day (the second time she called me, <br/>
before he was even due home) that she was keeping him on too short a leash, <br/>
that he was a good, thoughtful guy and should be cut some slack.  <br/>
<br/>
From her point of view, she was right to be calling all over because he <br/>
&quot;couldn&#39;t be trusted.&quot;   From my point of view, I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t leave <br/>
sooner.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s arranging lots of things himself--has applied to a transitional <br/>
residence program, is going to get a GED and apply for emancipation, he <br/>
figured out how to finagle his social security number (his mother had <br/>
promised for a year to get it out of the shed for him; he wanted to get a <br/>
job).  She had given his dentist a false number.  There&#39;s an older brother, a <br/>
grandmother, and there has never been a resident father.   There are no <br/>
outside relatives (those three being in the apartment).  <br/>
<br/>
He would be considered a missing child, perhaps, except that friends <br/>
persuaded him to call his mom once a week, which he does, and I&#39;m glad.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t tell her where he is, for which I don&#39;t blame him.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that there are other cases of the official statistics that <br/>
involve children escaping a stifling (or worse) homelife.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302687892">Actually, your timing for this &quot;subject shift&quot; is perfect... my 11-<br/>
year-old daughter was in tears the night before last, because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t think we give her enough independence.  We live in Orlando, <br/>
Florida, in a nice neighborhood, but rather near the tourist areas, <br/>
and there are robberies at the businesses less than a mile from here <br/>
too often for my comfort.  A couple weeks ago, my friend, who lives <br/>
around the corner, had an experience with a &quot;watcher&quot; - her daughter <br/>
was sitting on the bench on their front porch, while my friend ran <br/>
back inside for a sweater. A man was in a car across the street <br/>
watching her daughter, and when my friend came out and saw him, he <br/>
yelled something about living in the neighborhood and wanting to make <br/>
sure everything was okay, then took off quickly.<br/>
<br/>
There are no other homeschoolers in our immediate neighborhood, and <br/>
few kids my daughter&#39;s age.  The couple that she has found she didn&#39;t <br/>
even like because of their attitudes and behaviors.  She has a couple <br/>
of friends that live in a nearby neighborhood, but they aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to wander on their own either.  Most of her homeschool <br/>
friends live in a different part of town, where the kids attend <br/>
weekly homeschool classes.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that my daughter keeps reading all these books about <br/>
kids who can wander their little town on their own.  Since we don&#39;t <br/>
live in a little town, and due to financial constraints we cannot <br/>
consider that at this time, how do I help her feel more independence <br/>
without taking a chance that something will happen?  If she <br/>
could &quot;travel in a group&quot; it might be less &quot;dangerous,&quot; but those <br/>
don&#39;t exist here... and the only thing (besides houses) that&#39;s close <br/>
enough for her to go to (local shopping village) has had some crime <br/>
as well (mostly at night, but not all of it)...<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  <br/>

I know it&#39;s one of those endemic things that some folk <br/>
detest, but what about her having a mobile phone, with <br/>

Yeah, it depends on the kid.  My dd is 10 and very responsible, she was<br/>
born like this.  I have JUST begun to let her stay home alone for brief<br/>
periods.  My neighbor works at home and my best friend works around the<br/>
corner, less than 2 minutes drive from here.  I always make sure one or<br/>
both of there and aware she is home and I keep my cell phone on.<br/>
<br/>
What is so odd to me is that they offer classes called &quot;When I&#39;m In<br/>
Charge&quot; which teach kids how to handle safety issues when they are home<br/>
alone.  The ages they offer this to are 8 to 13? (not positive about the<br/>
max age).  Eight seems incredibly young to be home alone but maybe I&#39;m<br/>
just out of touch.<br/>

June. Last week we let them go to the mall on their own for an hour.  <br/>
My dh dropped them of at 11am and told them he would pick them up at <br/>
12. This is the first time we have allowed them to do this.<br/>
Both girls are very sensible.  When I go to the mall and they come <br/>
with me, I do let them do their own thing - giving them a time and <br/>
place to meet me,   It isnt that I dont trust the girls - I dont <br/>
trust other people!<br/>
<br/>
The girls are allowed to go to the movies together, or the swimming <br/>
pools.  A parent takes them and brings them back.  I do want to know <br/>
where dd is at all times.  she also goes for a walk around the block <br/>
with friend.  We live in a  safe area where most people know each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
I will leave dd alone during the day occasionally for a little while -<br/>
 but she has to stay inside and not answere the door or phone.<br/>
<br/>
I am rather protective compared to a lot of Mums with this age child -<br/>
and I am only just starting to losen the apron strings.<br/>

I was left &#39;HA&#39; from quite a young age, not only during <br/>
the day but at night too, basically I was more reliable <br/>
by myself than the sitters Mum found...  I always knew <br/>
where she was going and had the phone number...  I used <br/>
to phone once or twice while she was out :-)  I think I <br/>
would be about 8 or 9...  I&#39;m looking forward to my <br/>
eldest being able to cross roads by herself then she <br/>
can take herself to Granny&#39;s, maybe next year I think.  <br/>
I used to go to the shops by myself too.  But then I <br/>
used to play out down the street (a fairly fast main <br/>
road) when I was 3yo, so maybe it&#39;s that my mum was <br/>
clueless!!  <br/>
<br/>
Dunno, but I do like to be by myself...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66680852">I don&#39;t have any solutions or suggestions about how to encourage our <br/>
children&#39;s growing desire for independence, while keeping them safe.<br/>
<br/>
I think, like a lot of people, I&#39;ve thought that something like an abduction <br/>
couldn&#39;t happen to us because ...<br/>
<br/>
...we arm our children with knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
...we live in a &quot;safe&quot; area.<br/>
<br/>
...our children aren&#39;t afraid to speak their minds or to tell us things.<br/>
<br/>
When an 11yo girl from near here was abducted and murdered, I thought, well I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have let an 11yo go to a late night skate alone. And I would have <br/>
been there to pick her up right on time, if I HAD let her go. Now that my <br/>
daughter is older, I can see how that struggle for independence might have <br/>
led me to let her do something like this, and trusting someone else, who then <br/>
showed up late, to give her a ride home could have happened. We want to think <br/>
our kids are absolutely safe. That we or they are in control. It&#39;s <br/>
frightening that we can&#39;t always be safe, no matter how much control we think <br/>
we have or what tools we have given them.<br/>
<br/>
This is a link to a site with information on the abduction of three girls <br/>
near us who seemed safe. One was taken from her front porch where she was <br/>
doing her homework. The other two sisters, 11 and 15, had just gotten home <br/>
from school.<br/>

It&#39;s hard to know what to do as a parent. We live near a small college town <br/>
where my daughter, 14, is comfortable walking around with her friends. Being <br/>
dropped off at the town library. Spending hours in the little used book <br/>
store. She is confident, and I don&#39;t want her to be &quot;jumpy&quot; and wary and <br/>
frightened. But sometimes I am. I think I always will be. What was that <br/>
quote? (Yes, it&#39;s Laura, lover of other people&#39;s words.)<br/>

I&#39;ve left kids that young and younger, for long enough to go to the grocery <br/>
store (two blocks) or post office or to rent a video but only if and when <br/>
they wanted to stay instead of go.  Usually they were engrossed in something <br/>
(video game or Barbie-dolls or something) and I would put a phone number <br/>
right by the phone, and come right home and ask questions--were you scared?  <br/>
Anything weird happen?  And gradually, the time got longer and slight <br/>
incidents came up and were discussed, and now that Holly&#39;s nine she often <br/>
prefers to stay than go.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in a safe neighborhood, though, the neighbors know her, we have a smart <br/>
dog, several phones around the house, and Holly&#39;s decisive and assertive.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t pressure her to stay.  Sometimes I leave her with a brother somewhat <br/>
against her will if I&#39;m in a hurry to leave or it&#39;s not a kid-friendly <br/>
destination.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924776148">Laura: That&#39;s it. My daughter&#39;s are NEVER going to go anywhere alone. <br/>
Can I keep them in the house until they are 40? No? Darn. I agree<br/>
with <br/>
the quote at the end of your post :<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Making the decision to have a child -- it&#39;s momentous. It is to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>With stories like this, it is hard to let them go. Last night, my <br/>
almost 12-year-old daughter was riding her bike at dusk and I went <br/>
outside to call her in and couldn&#39;t find her. She was down the block <br/>
(about three houses) riding around in a parking lot that is on a main <br/>
road (where the local undersirables frequently walk). She&#39;s been told <br/>
not to go there, especially at night. When I asked her why she was <br/>
down there, she looked at me like I was crazy. Kids think they are <br/>
invincible. I did, didn&#39;t everyone?<br/>

&gt; frightening that we can&#39;t always be safe, no matter how much<br/>
control <br/>
we think <br/>
&gt; we have or what tools we have given them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a link to a site with information on the abduction of three <br/>
girls <br/>
&gt; near us who seemed safe. One was taken from her front porch where <br/>
she was <br/>
&gt; doing her homework. The other two sisters, 11 and 15, had just <br/>
gotten home <br/>
&gt; from school.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s hard to know what to do as a parent. We live near a small <br/>
college town <br/>
&gt; where my daughter, 14, is comfortable walking around with her <br/>
friends. Being <br/>
&gt; dropped off at the town library. Spending hours in the little used <br/>
book <br/>
&gt; store. She is confident, and I don&#39;t want her to be &quot;jumpy&quot; and<br/>
wary <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; frightened. But sometimes I am. I think I always will be. What was <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; quote? (Yes, it&#39;s Laura, lover of other people&#39;s words.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Making the decision to have a child -- it&#39;s momentous. It is to <br/>
decide <br/>
&gt; forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body.&quot;  <br/>

I&#39;m just curious about the phone thing:  What if you have a flat tire and <br/>
want to call and say you&#39;ll be late?<br/>
<br/>
I worry about phones.  I don&#39;t let our phone line be tied up if any kids are  <br/>
not home.  So on a night when all are in and accounted for, after 10:00 I&#39;ll <br/>
let the kids use both phone lines (so two can be online at the same time) but <br/>
if anyone&#39;s spending the night away or still out, I make sure the phone line <br/>
is available.<br/>
<br/>
My husband sometimes just lets the phone ring and it really bothers me.  I <br/>
tell him it could be me, or one of the kids, needing a rescue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349765580">&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve left kids that young and younger, for long enough to go to the<br/>
grocery <br/>
store (two blocks) or post office or to rent a video but only if and when<br/>
<br/>
they wanted to stay instead of go.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a point, she was afraid of being alone until recently so that may<br/>
be why it seemed so young.<br/>
<br/>
Staying home wasn&#39;t MY idea, LOL, I love her company.  It still makes me<br/>
nervous but she really wanted to have this freedom and she&#39;s so<br/>
responsible I felt that saying no would be insulting.  She usually wants<br/>
to go but needs a break from her little brother once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, now she&#39;s asking when she can start baby sitting.  Argh! <br/>
Thankfully she&#39;s good about giving ME time to get comfortable with new<br/>
ideas.  I&#39;ve told her that she is welcome to baby sit here in our house<br/>
when I&#39;m home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983379567">Unfortunately, we have a major freeway that turns into a regular 4 lane city<br/>
street running right in front of our only &quot;real&quot; mall.  This is the first<br/>
town with anything larger than a wide space in the road on the trip from<br/>
Pelican Bay (super max last stop prison) to points south when they cut folks<br/>
loose.  We&#39;ve had several murders by these supposed &quot;ex&quot; offenders and a<br/>
couple of years ago a 17 year old was snatched right in front of the mall<br/>
when she was crossing the street.  She has never been found.<br/>
<br/>
End result, I am working real hard at keeping my now out of control &quot;mommy<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dd will be 13yrs old in August.  her friend will be 13yrs old in<br/>
&gt; June. Last week we let them go to the mall on their own for an hour.<br/>
&gt; My dh dropped them of at 11am and told them he would pick them up at<br/>
&gt; 12. This is the first time we have allowed them to do this.<br/>
&gt; Both girls are very sensible.  When I go to the mall and they come<br/>
&gt; with me, I do let them do their own thing - giving them a time and<br/>
&gt; place to meet me,   It isnt that I dont trust the girls - I dont<br/>
&gt; trust other people!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The girls are allowed to go to the movies together, or the swimming<br/>
&gt; pools.  A parent takes them and brings them back.  I do want to know<br/>
&gt; where dd is at all times.  she also goes for a walk around the block<br/>
&gt; with friend.  We live in a  safe area where most people know each<br/>
&gt; other.<br/>

&gt; I will leave dd alone during the day occasionally for a little while -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554460849"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What is so odd to me is that they offer classes called &quot;When I&#39;m In<br/>
&gt; Charge&quot; which teach kids how to handle safety issues when they are home<br/>
&gt; alone.  The ages they offer this to are 8 to 13? (not positive about the<br/>
&gt; max age).  Eight seems incredibly young to be home alone but maybe I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; just out of touch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Over the years one of the ways I have stayed in touch is coaching soccer!!!<br/>
Various locations (small town, city, suburbs)  and various years.<br/>
I remember my shock in 1988 to learn that a 9 year old team member not only was<br/>
home alone for  3 hours each schoolday but he was also responsible for his 5 yo<br/>
brother.      Just last year (I am commissioner now, not coach)  I listened as a<br/>
mother explained why her child needed to be on team with a particular child so<br/>
that he could get a ride to practices since mom did not get home from big city<br/>
job until 6:30 daily.   Furthermore, practices needed to be on certain days when<br/>
younger son had activities since she depended on the 11 yo to supervise  the 8<br/>
yo.<br/>
<br/>
These examples were for &quot;after school&quot; hours.<br/>
For summertime, lots of kids are in &quot;day camps&quot;  which are often special<br/>
programs run by daycare establishments to provide supervision and activities up<br/>
to about age 12.     My experience is that after about age 10 families make<br/>
decisions based on the individual child  (able to control impulses, willing to<br/>
be home alone) and their own situation (older siblings at home,  neighbor<br/>
willing to be a contact if trouble arises,  parents or adults able to maintain<br/>
telephone contact, relative safety of home location)<br/>
<br/>
I can also remember when my now 21 yo was about 9-12 and our neighborhood teemed<br/>
with that age group.  I always tried to keep our property &quot;kid-friendly&quot;  as a<br/>
way to keep my son home.    The majority of the kids did not have an adult at<br/>
home many days.    Watching their life skills as they participated in our<br/>
household I thought that classes covering certain basics might be very useful<br/>
since it was apparent  many had not given thought to what to do in potentially<br/>
threatening situations.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, many kids are home alone from very young ages.      Or they are in the care<br/>
of others that are not quite adults yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678461204">The answering machines you hook to the phone to let you &quot;screen&quot; calls  can be<br/>
very useful.   &quot;Callnotes&quot;  has its advantages...........one being that it will<br/>
take a message even if you have call waiting and decide not to answer the other<br/>
line.   But there is a distinct disadvantage in that one cannot hover over the<br/>
phone and listen to the voice of the caller before deciding to answer.     I<br/>
think we were the &quot;last on the block&quot;  to get call waiting but it certainly<br/>
helped my mommy worries---------I could feel comfortable using the phone even<br/>
when my babies were out and about.     Miss Manners might say that it is rude to<br/>
put someone on hold to take another call but I have yet to find a parent who is<br/>
upset when I say &quot;let me take this call, my teenagers are still out&quot;.   Usually<br/>
they are quick to say &quot;I do the same thing&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Vicki<br/>
P.S.:   So glad that cellphone costs have decreased.     Pagers for a teenager<br/>
were very helpful (even police advised that pagers were nowadays less likely to<br/>
be for drug deals than to be from parents anxious to be able to contact mobile<br/>
children)  but cellphone is even better.<br/>

Many people interpret this to mean that a child cannot be left alone <br/>

&lt;&lt;  My children and I have used a code, in the past. I let the phone ring <br/>
<br/>
twice.. hang up and then return the call a couple minutes later...that way <br/>
<br/>
they know it is me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because I can&#39;t help being nitpicky...<br/>
<br/>
The ringer on the phone doesn&#39;t match the tone you hear.  It can seem the <br/>
phone didn&#39;t ring at all but it did.  Or the caller can hear a ring (which is <br/>
a tone showing a connection, not the actual sound or time of that ring on the <br/>
other end) and hang up, and the phone didn&#39;t ring on the other end.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s imperfect, a count of two.  It&#39;s possible to do, but not <br/>
guaranteeable.  You can&#39;t go absolutely by what you hear.<br/>

<br/>
Different state to state (and maybe cities??).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure all states have the laws.  Someone here has probably already put <br/>
up a website, but I&#39;m answering as I go. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I do the same thing with the door and phone, she doesn&#39;t answer either. <br/>
We have an answering machine so I just call and tell her to call me back<br/>
on the cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
I use Call Wave which answers the phone when I&#39;m online and plays the<br/>
message for me on the computer.  That way I can go online even when the<br/>
kids aren&#39;t home.<br/>
