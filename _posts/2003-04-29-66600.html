<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451291261">I think for lots of people this is such a difficult concept--&quot;getting&quot;<br/>
unschooling.   Especially if we went to school our whole lives and our<br/>
parents did and so on and so on.    We&#39;ve been told what to do and when to<br/>
do it.   We&#39;ve never just done what we&#39;ve wanted to do!   Which in turn<br/>
never get to develop those interests.   We go from doing what we were<br/>
supposed to do in school to-- doing what we are supposed to do in our jobs<br/>
to--doing what we are supposed to do as a wife/mother.<br/>
<br/>
Its a huge jump to doing what we are interested in or living our own lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that we can&#39;t take care of our families or<br/>
children but I think there is a healthy amount of care versus a mother not<br/>
having her own life.   I&#39;ve seen this in other Moms and I think this was me<br/>
for a while.   Taking care of others for so long that its so hard to make<br/>
the jump of allowing them (your children) to just be.  Allowing them to just<br/>
live their lives  and  then in turn we can live our lives also.<br/>
<br/>
Allow and enable your children to do what they want to do; do what you like<br/>
to do and some of the time those things will intertwine.    Its the weaving<br/>
of our lives.   Its the flow.<br/>
<br/>
An example of one of our days:<br/>
<br/>
I get up and work at the computer,   kids get up at different times,  some<br/>
make own breakfast, some I help.<br/>
<br/>
Kids watch a bit of TV,  play with animals,  play with toys/books.<br/>
<br/>
If we have to go into town, like today, I let them know,  so they can get<br/>
ready.   My son will probably stay home and play his gameboy,  daughters go<br/>
with to look at plants and get dirt for planting.    I love gardening and so<br/>
do the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Come home and start working outside on yard,  planting,   cleaning up a bit.<br/>
Stop, because Kyra, 5 dd,  wants me to jump on trampoline with her.   Do<br/>
that for a while.   Play for a while.   Other two kids join us,  then I get<br/>
too tired to move,   so I go and plant more.<br/>
<br/>
I start getting hungry,  ask if anyone is hungry,  some are, some aren&#39;t.<br/>
Some of us eat.   Go back outside to work.   Kyra is scootering,  Abbi is<br/>
inside drawing flowers,  Alec is working at the computer looking up Pokemon<br/>
characters and helps for his games.  Alec makes his own lunch, he likes to.<br/>
<br/>
Later,  a friend might come over to play, we might go for a bike ride, I<br/>
might do my yoga,  they for sure watch their Toonami shows.   I sometimes<br/>
watch with them, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
This evening we have some friends coming over who are going to help get a<br/>
piano into our basement.   We&#39;ve had one in our garage for a year and we<br/>
finally get to bring it in!!   We are all excited about that!   So, sometime<br/>
today we have to get a space ready for that,   I have to move 2 full book<br/>
cases,  ugh!    Then,  I bet we&#39;ll play the piano.<br/>
<br/>
A glimpse into one of our days.<br/>

Kelli in MN,   and so excited that its trying to be spring here!</div>
