My idea is she&#39;ll grow out of it some, if her patterns follows mine.<br/>
<br/>
If I could have a cookie or donut, I would look at the box or tray and would <br/>
pick the one I thought would mind the least being separated from the rest.  <br/>
Sometimes I was lucky and one seemed to WANT to leave there.<br/>
<br/>
I kept a dead snake for years.  When I found it, it was freshly run over <br/>
lengthwise by a car, quite dead but still &quot;warm&quot; (for a snake) and my teacher <br/>
really wanted me to throw it away, but no, it was educational and I was <br/>
fascinated so I put it in a shoebox, took it home, and it eventually lived <br/>
(stiffly) stuck above the horseshoe above the door of one of my dad&#39;s storage <br/>
sheds.  <br/>
<br/>
It mostly passed when I was 15 or so and able to give away some dolls and <br/>
stuffed animals to younger female friends and neighbors.  <br/>
<br/>
I have an adult friend who personifies her furniture and cars, but she&#39;s not <br/>
a packrat, so when I see her name and talk to something and then just give it <br/>
away or sell it, it makes her seem cold to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have one of her old couches (given name unknown to me &lt;g&gt;).  She kept it <br/>
super clean and all.  I let the dog use it to look out the front window, and <br/>
Holly jumps on it.  My friend probably thinks I care less about it than she <br/>
did, but I&#39;m just giving it more freedom than she did!  A less structured <br/>
life.  It used to have scheduled baths and bedtimes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
