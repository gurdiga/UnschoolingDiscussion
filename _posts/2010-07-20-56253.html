<div id="ygrps-yiv-34264644"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I did need to get used to the style though, which is why I think the advice you get as a new member, to read for a few months(?) before you post, is very worthwhile. Also reading up on subjects that are of interest for your own situation on the web site is very helpful, and many questions can be answered by that, without even posting.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes it&#39;s worthwhile to read the archives! Also when you can find the<br/>
time to, reading Joyce Fetteroll and Sandra Dodd&#39;s websites:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com">http://sandradodd.com</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<br/>
The email list is a lot of reading. Following new threads is good but<br/>
old ones are, in a way, more productive for someone like me who wants<br/>
to see what happens without having to wait and wade through new stuff<br/>
everyday. The archives have already happened, so they are incredibly<br/>
helpful and the new stuff coming down the pipe (believe me) is about<br/>
9/10ths a repetition of what has gone before on the list.<br/>
<br/>
One of things I&#39;ve learned on this email list about unschooling is<br/>
that human nature is a very determinedly steady indicator of what will<br/>
happen on the list, and that&#39;s why we see the same questions being<br/>
posted over and over again. Go look in the archives. Almost everything<br/>
one can think to ask about unschooling has been asked already. The<br/>
search function is ok and better than it was when I started reading<br/>
the list. It&#39;s been improved.<br/>
<br/>
Hint: to see all of a thread, there&#39;s a link at the top of the<br/>
messages so that threads appear either in the time each post was<br/>
posted or grouped by topics. Click &quot;Group by Topic&quot; and save yourself<br/>
the trouble of losing half or more of the threads you&#39;re reading and<br/>
so that you can see the progression of the thread you&#39;re on.<br/>
<br/>
The websites are great because topics are already right there in the<br/>
margins to click on. You&#39;re already reading online by being on an<br/>
email list. And reading on a website though different can be<br/>
productive in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
I spent loads of time reading. Otherwise being discouraged isn&#39;t hard<br/>
for someone who has almost no support in the community except<br/>
incidentally for unschooling. What I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t like anything the<br/>
people around me are doing, for the most part. There are elements of<br/>
it in gentle parenting, but unschooling goes beyond gentle parenting<br/>
by supporting a child&#39;s interests in ways that really push the<br/>
envelope.<br/>
<br/>
In particular, I hardly ever meet people other than unschoolers who<br/>
are so pro-vidgame/tv, etc. Most people are decidedly anti. It&#39;s hard<br/>
to imagine a more comprehensive learning resource, and NOT using seems<br/>
incredibly wasteful unless one&#39;s child isn&#39;t interested of course. But<br/>
mine definitely is interested. If I weren&#39;t reading and hadn&#39;t read<br/>
for a long time all the information about how great such a resource<br/>
is, I could easily be led to think I&#39;m not doing the right thing to<br/>
let Karl delve into such an interest to such a degree as he has. He&#39;s<br/>
very knowledgeable about so many things due to that interest. Things<br/>
which sometimes wows him and other times he takes for granted. Things<br/>
I can&#39;t take for granted and still appreciate the thing that<br/>
unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing goes in particular with food. Most people are not very<br/>
relaxed about food consumption for their children. It either must all<br/>
be eaten or only certain things are allowed. But unschooling isn&#39;t<br/>
about how much or what to eat. It&#39;s about what the child, the person<br/>
whose range of choice unschooling can enhance considerably. I have<br/>
only one non-unschooling friend who is friendly about food and choice<br/>
for her children (and others). Right, I don&#39;t have lots of friends but<br/>
among the friends I have, only one is generous about food choice in<br/>
the family. :) Pretty much everybody else seems to be about<br/>
restriction for everyone. The opinionated ones raise eyebrows about<br/>
Karl&#39;s eating choices if it&#39;s not &quot;good&quot; for children or assume that I<br/>
chose his food if he eats what they think of as &quot;good&quot; food.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not a difficult concept, even if at first blush a<br/>
parent doesn&#39;t agree with it. What&#39;s difficult is knowing how to<br/>
support unschooling for one&#39;s own unique child. It took a lot of<br/>
reading and doing and experiencing the effects of it in our own family<br/>
to figure out the nuts and bolts of unschooling, what it is, what it<br/>
does, how to do it. I&#39;ve been reading for over 5 years about<br/>
unschooling. I&#39;m still learning about things I can do better.<br/>
<br/>
Read the archives. If you don&#39;t know where to start, click on what<br/>
interests you. Or click on topics about tv, video games, food, etc.<br/>
Those are always hot topics full of juicy unschooling info and how to.<br/>
