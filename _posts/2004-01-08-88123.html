&gt; I never found them to be &quot;preachy.&quot;<br/>

&gt;&gt;Read books like &quot;The Berenstain Bears and Too Much<br/>
&gt;&gt;Junk Food&quot;.  Great book that isn&#39;t &quot;preachy&quot;.  Worked<br/>
&gt;&gt;for my kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t that an oxymoron? A Berenstain Bears book that isn&#39;t preachy?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321761115">Oh, I hate them without even having read that.  Unfortunately Lydia loves them and often checks them out from the library.  We do talk, though,  about how disrepectful mama and papa bear are to the cubs and what it would have been better for them to do.  Prob. not the use intended by the authors.   I also emphasize the bit in one book where the cubs agree that &quot;no school&quot; is better than &quot;school&quot;  - lol. <br/>

I&#39;ll try to watch the show with my kids and talk to them about my objections. <br/>
 It&#39;s just hard for me to watch or read the books to my cherubs without <br/>
imposing my views on them.  I&#39;d like for them to get there themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing the nephew story.  Can&#39;t wait to receive that one sometime <br/>
soon!<br/>

I love the old Berenstein Bears series, the one I grew up with. There is<br/>
only one bear cub who has a bumbling papa  attempting to teach him the ways<br/>
of being a bear. Small Bear rescues him everytime and shows the reader he<br/>
really didn&#39;t the lesson but humours his Dad anyway. Not preachy just funny!<br/>
