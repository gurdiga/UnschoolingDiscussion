loves to learn. I have heard about kids that love workbooks and enjoy the<br/>
structure of knowing exactly what they can do this minute. Others learn<br/>
better with freedom to learn when and what they want to. The idea of<br/>
unschooling is to let the child learn  in the way that is best for them at<br/>
the moment and to not become frustrated and agitated when their style of<br/>
learning changes.(That also means not buying workbooks for the next 12 years<br/>
at one shot. Your child&#39;s desire to work in them may change very quickly.)<br/>

<br/>
I just HAVE to jump in and say you ARE unschooling!!! That is how our <br/>
children learn from birth!! We do not sit  down with them and read them a <br/>
textbook on how to walk!!!!!!! You&#39;re already doing it!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377917013">I think unschooling is just plain &quot;not going to school&quot;    From there it is<br/>
whatever you want to do in your journey of life and that part of it you share<br/>
with your children in their journey.<br/>
That&#39;s  sounds weird, but I don&#39;t think it has to be anything that specific.<br/>
I&#39;m not into labels, because all of us are so diversified, that we cannot be<br/>
labeled.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42918571">Yes Ann...I agree that choice of  learning  is part of the very fabric of<br/>
homeschooling. <br/>
I don&#39;t think it sounds weird, I think it sounds just right.<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts.<br/>
