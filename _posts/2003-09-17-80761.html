&lt;&lt; ROFL! I&#39;ve never seen &quot;Blazing Saddles.&quot; Now I&#39;ll have to :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Watch it alone before you share it with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I liked it when I was younger, but the one time I rented it after I had kids, <br/>
I took it back without sharing it with them because of much use of &quot;the &#39;n&#39; <br/>
word,&quot; which at the time they had never heard, and which even now they&#39;ve heard <br/>
very rarely, and I&#39;m interested in keeping it that way.  Someday they&#39;ll see <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth a warning.<br/>
Being born in the 50&#39;s and having Texas redneck relatives, I heard it <br/>
countless times as a young child, but moving to Northern New Mexico, that use and <br/>
reference stopped cold, and there ARE still some pockets of the world where <br/>
political correctness in terms of terms &lt;g&gt; has a semblance of maintenance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000093337">Thanks for the warning, Sandra. Accalia usually doesn&#39;t want to watch any of<br/>
&quot;our&quot; movies with us yet. She&#39;ll run upstairs and watch her own thing unless<br/>
we happen to be watching Spiderman or Hulk :)<br/>
