Myranda<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been very busy lately and am just now catching up on this list.  I have<br/>
  to comment on the &quot;lazybones&quot;, nicknames issue.  My MIL says everything with a<br/>
  smile, no matter how negative. The last time she visited she talked about how<br/>
  lazy my husband was as a child, she laughed and talked about it in a<br/>
  good-natured way.  I watched my husband smile and wince the whole time.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  lived with him for 12 years I know it hurt him, she doesn&#39;t acknowledge it or<br/>
  know it.  My husband tends to excuse everything she says even if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
  like it, because she says everything so &quot;lovingly&quot;.  If he calls her on it,<br/>
  who looks like the spoilsport? She&#39;s just being affectionate, right?  The<br/>
  mother who calls her son lazybones writes in one of her posts that the son<br/>
  enjoys the nickname.  Well maybe he sees that you enjoy it and approve of it,<br/>
  it doesn&#39;t mean he enjoys it.  It may take him years to admit that he hates<br/>
  it, just like it has my husband.  Children usually can&#39;t sort out complex<br/>
  emotions and feelings until much later.  Right now all he knows is Mommy finds<br/>
  &quot;lazybones&quot; cute, later on he may realize that Mommy was comparing him to his<br/>
  more active sibling, negatively.  You may say it&#39;s not a negative comparison<br/>
  but the first post on this &quot;lazy&quot; issue spoke volumns, every post after that<br/>
  is just defensiveness.  I&#39;m not trying to be mean, just truthful.  I&#39;ve<br/>
  unconsciously done the labeling thing to my own son.  Fortunately I&#39;ve had<br/>
  friends and family call me on it and I&#39;ve taken into account what they have to<br/>
  say.  Other people are not always right in their opinion but I figure if the<br/>
  issue is presenting itself to me there is a damn good reason and I better look<br/>
  at it closely before I dismiss it.  I&#39;d urge you to do the same.<br/>

<br/>
It isn&#39;t amazing or unusual to find adults who don&#39;t want to admit or <br/>

most parents are NOT like that here at unschooling-dotcom. This is a <br/>
special place where people try to learn from each other and from their <br/>
own mistakes how not to cause their children unnecessary harm or <br/>
damage. Really unschooling takes a certain willingness to examine <br/>
one&#39;s own motives and attempt to be honest. It takes work. It can be <br/>
painful and humiliating to admit to oneself that one isn&#39;t perfect and <br/>
that we can cause harm even with the best of intentions. I would say <br/>
most of us here have felt that pain at one time or another; we feel <br/>
your pain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989996333">Thankfully, I am not one of those parents who are not willing to admit mistakes or wrongs they do/did. I made many mistakes - not breastfeeding my boys, smacking hands and butts, punishments that were too harsh for the deed, blindly following doctors advice, trying to potty-train too early, putting my youngest in daycare, etc, etc. No one&#39;s perfect. I have learned from and changed many of my parenting ideas and practices since becoming a parent over 7 years ago. I learn more every day. Simply because I do not agree with the majority here about what is best for my family does not mean I am a stuck-in-my-ways, my-way-or-the-highway, miss perfect of a parent. <br/>

<br/>
Saying you&#39;ve been unschooling since they were born, though,  isn&#39;t true if <br/>
you&#39;re just lately figuring out what unschooling is and how it works.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t claim unschooling or homeschooling before the time Kirby would have <br/>
gone to school.  Some people do, for some reasons which are sometimes good.  <br/>
But retroactively saying you&#39;ve unschooled since you had children isn&#39;t as <br/>
honest as it could be.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to really look at what we&#39;re doing unless we can SEE what we&#39;re <br/>
doing, and getting a story clear in our own heads is a good way to look at <br/>
it.  If someone tells people &quot;We call him this because...&quot; and the next day <br/>
it&#39;s &quot;He made up his own nickname&quot; then there is a lack of clarity which goes <br/>
deeper than any one conversation, or weeklong discussion.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, maybe long dicussions are the equivalent of people <br/>
berating me because I don&#39;t play soccer or swim.  No amount of discussion is <br/>
going to change that.<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner&#39;s description of intrapersonal intelligence (people can google <br/>
it if that&#39;s unfamiliary) in his set of multiple intelligences describes <br/>
something just as real as dancing or understanding math.  BUt not everyone is <br/>
equally interested or facile with it.  I&#39;m not a dancer.  I&#39;m no jock.  Some <br/>
parts of math confuse the heck out of me.  Interpersonal/intrapersonal and <br/>
verbal stuff, though, come easy to me.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to get someone to understand or believe that some people can perceive <br/>
interpersonal situations better than others seems to be an insult in this <br/>
culture.  Sometimes we take &quot;all men are created equal&quot; to mean all have the <br/>
same abilities and talents.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone here were advising me or my kids on sports medicine, I would <br/>
really listen, because I don&#39;t know.  If someone advised me about how to seal <br/>
up a shower or fix plumbing, I would really listen.<br/>
<br/>
But when interpersonal or intrapersonal skills are the question, all emotion <br/>
breaks loose and those who have less of it deny &quot;more of it&quot; could exist.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not clearly expressing myself, and I do know it&#39;s awkward <br/>
subject matter.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell when a note doesn&#39;t match another note.  Some people can&#39;t.  So I <br/>
should tune the guitar, not the other person.  If I say &quot;I&#39;m no better at <br/>
tuning this guitar,&quot; or &quot;You know your own guitar best,&quot; that&#39;s not being <br/>
honest or helpful.  If I said &quot;I  have a guitar and it bothers me that the <br/>
chords don&#39;t sound right,&quot; I could advise on tuning it even by e-mail.   If <br/>
that person then said &quot;I tuned it that way on purpose&quot; or &quot;It sounds fine to <br/>
me,&quot; I would wonder what the original post had been about.<br/>

***Yeah, a negative meaning. A meaning that the rest of the world considers not<br/>

<br/>
I was thinking the same thing myself when Myranda wrote that.<br/>
I think she was trying to say that she was using it descriptively and not meaning it as an insult, but still.  Imagine if my son was overweight and I decided to affectionately call him Fatso.  I could defend it by saying &quot;But fat is just a word with a meaning!  Like any other word! And it&#39;s true- he is fat, and he knows it! And we say so affectionately, not meanly!&quot;<br/>
Sometimes, even when there is some truth to a description, it is unkind to hinge a child&#39;s entire self image on it by turning it into his name.<br/>
