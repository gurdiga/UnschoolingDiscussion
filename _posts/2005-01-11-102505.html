<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367549282">My kids wanted to make boiled peanuts, so we tried. We found recipes <br/>
online to make them, and did it. Well, they didn&#39;t come out right. <br/>
THey never got soft in the middle, kind of like really, really <br/>
aldente pasta in the middle.(we boiled and soaked, and boiled and <br/>
soaked them) LOL Does anyone have any suggestions? I used regular <br/>
raw peanuts. Do I have to use some other kind of peanuts that I <br/>
haven&#39;t found? Help.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Regular raw *green* peanuts? Dried peanuts won&#39;t work---well, I guess they  <br/>
*will* eventually.<br/>
 <br/>
I heavily salt the water, add bag of crab boil and two-three beers (alcohol  <br/>
cooks out, but leaves a great flavor). They boil for 30 minutes, and  then I <br/>
lower the temp to medium and cook another 20-30 minutes, depending  on how <br/>
recently they&#39;ve been picked and on how big they are.<br/>

green peanuts. As many places around here make the boiled peanuts, <br/>
there ought to be a grocery store that stocks the green ones to make <br/>
them yourself. LOL<br/>
Thanks for the info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307085553">Nisha -- I don&#39;t know where you live, but here in Northern Virginia,<br/>
I&#39;ve found green peanuts in Asian supermarkets, and sometimes at<br/>
roadside produce stands -- especially when rambling in Virginia peanut<br/>
country.  the best boiled green peanuts I&#39;ve ever had were from a<br/>
Shell gas station off I-95 just inside the Florida line north of<br/>
Jax-ville.  After buying a large stash of peanuts and citrus, we got<br/>
off the highway and took the slow road up the Georgia coast, snacking<br/>
on boiled peanuts and stopping at interesting places along the way,<br/>
such as these: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/geo-flor/11.htm">http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/geo-flor/11.htm</a><br/>

I savoring the idea of bawlin&#39; some up right now with some Old Bay<br/>
Seasoning and beer. ~ Alicia    <br/>
