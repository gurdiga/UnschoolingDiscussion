<div id="ygrps-yiv-414476145">Hi Faith,<br/>
<br/>
You are not alone.  There are several Ontario unschoolers with teenagers on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Nichoel suggested the Ontario Federation of Teaching Parents website, and that&#39;s a great place to start ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ontariohomeschool.org/)">http://www.ontariohomeschool.org/)</a>.  There&#39;s plenty of support for folks who are considering or beginning to home or unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me privately, if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Where in Ontario are you?  We&#39;re in Toronto, but lived in Kitchener for several years.<br/>
