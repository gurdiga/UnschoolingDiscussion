<div id="ygrps-yiv-308578206">Hello all!<br/>
My husband (Croatian) and I (Swedish) are currently living in Sweden, <br/>
renovating an old wooden sailboat, turning it in to our home. Our son, <br/>
2yrs in a week, is a happy, curious, smart and very loving little guy <br/>
with a passion for books, painting, anything with an engine and <br/>
household &quot;work&quot;. He loves cooking, cleaning, doing laundry and <br/>
gardening. We, my husband and I, are NOT as passionate about those <br/>
things, but we try to live life in a more cheerful and positive way <br/>
than what was passed down to us from our upbringing, part of which is <br/>
a distaste of all things household related. We want to instill in our <br/>
son a sense of joy in doing all things related to living, not just <br/>
what is known as &quot;hobbies&quot; or &quot;RR&quot;. One big inspiration has been <br/>
reading the Continuum Concept, but before that we were already on this <br/>
path. We are trying to make our life as independent as possible of <br/>
societal structures, but without isolating ourselves. Hence, we want <br/>
to live on our boat, unfettered by power companies, water pipes, <br/>
gasoline and mass produced schooling. But we also love the internet, <br/>
use whatever resources are available (libraries, paly centers for kids <br/>
etc) to enrich our lives. But it is at times hard. We do feel &quot;weird&quot; <br/>
in the eyes of others, and end up unfortunately a bit socially <br/>
isolated. And one of our big concerns is the rpessure from society to <br/>
put him in a school. I went to a Waldorf school for part of my <br/>
schooling and loved it. But we are looking in to home-based education <br/>
for our son, and are looking for information and inspiration...glad to <br/>
have found you all, look forward to soaking in widom and getting to <br/>
know you all!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a friend who loved to cook and clean as a kid, an by the time he was <br/>
twelve he was the sole kitchen crew at his house, made all the meals, people&#39;s <br/>
lunches and kept the grocery list.    He was VERY happy to have done that and <br/>
has cooked professionally from time to time as an adult, but that wasn&#39;t his <br/>
&quot;goal,&quot; it&#39;s just something that&#39;s fun and easy for him.<br/>
<br/>
Your son&#39;s interest might have side benefits for you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As to Continuum Concept, I don&#39;t think you need to pretend to like something <br/>
you don&#39;t, but I have found (mostly from reading Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s take on it <br/>
which is calming and sweet) that if you see &quot;housework&quot; as an evil burden that <br/>
it will make your life unhappy, but if you see it as a thing you can do or <br/>
not do, it&#39;s better.<br/>
<br/>
Even on a boat with all the many &quot;Have to&quot; conditions, you could STILL decide <br/>
not to do them, and risk the consequences.   But thinking of it that way, you <br/>
will probably decide the risks aren&#39;t worth the temporary joy of not <br/>
[cleaning/stowing/repairing/maintaining/stocking], and then you&#39;ll be doing those <br/>
things because you really WANT to.<br/>
<br/>
Your son doesn&#39;t so much need to see you doing the very things he likes to do <br/>
as he needs to see you doing things that are important to you, and doing them <br/>
joyfully.   And think of how much he will learn about sailing and map reading <br/>
and geography and weather!   <br/>

I have stuff on chores too<br/>

mostly written by other people, but Joyce&#39;s site is wonderfully well <br/>
organized and green.   Mine&#39;s not quite so jazzy.<br/>

it interesting to go no, I have NO problem letting him cook and clean.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OOO I am sorry if it came across as us pretending to have fun hwile <br/>
doing something we dislike doing!!! NOT at all what I meant. Rather, <br/>
we are continuously trying to find ways to do things that we usually <br/>
find a drag in a way that&#39;s more fun and less stressful. And also, <br/>
talking about exactly why we hate certain things. For example, my <br/>
parents forced me to do dishes immediately after dinne, no matter <br/>
what. No delay and spankings if I didn&#39;t comply. As a result I truly <br/>
hate doing dishes. But dh has no particular feeligns about it. SO he <br/>
does them all the time, and I do things he dislikes for various <br/>
reasons. CC was inspirational in that it really brought home the fact <br/>
that it is our attitudes towards chores that make them a bummer, not <br/>
the chores themselves...and by analysing thoe attitudes we can <br/>
actually learn to truly enjoy many things!<br/>

geometry, math, biology etc through hands on experience!! I can&#39;t <br/>
wait!!!<br/>
