&lt;&lt; So was the &quot;w&quot; once pronounced as in the others? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep.<br/>
Language lives well in ballads.  There&#39;s one called &quot;The Twa Sisters&quot; (still <br/>
pronounced) and in &quot;The Twa Corbies,&quot; which is in Scots dialect, the &quot;twa&quot; is <br/>
pronounced in the text.  <br/>
<br/>
It lasted longer in Scotland than England, that pronunciation.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of the rhythm and rhyme of ballads, there will be whole phrases which <br/>
are obsolete in spoken or written use, but still sung and passed on because <br/>
the ballad doesn&#39;t make sense without it.<br/>
<br/>
In Matty Groves, a version collected in the SE U.S., one verse is:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m standin&#39; here with two swords by my side<br/>
They cost me deep in purse<br/>
I&#39;ll give to you the best o&#39; them<br/>
and I will take the worst, worst, and I will take the worst.<br/>
<br/>
Library-collectors would probably change that &quot;worst&quot; to &quot;worse&quot; for <br/>
grammatical perfection, but whatever.  The &quot;cost me deep in purse&quot; definitely <br/>
dates the text from when men carried their money in purses (little belt <br/>
pouches).  And there&#39;s a Ben Jonson song about a cutpurse.   Cutpurse was a <br/>
pickpocket.  But the name was from literally slipping by, bumping someone, <br/>
and at the same time cutting the cords of leather or whatever that held a <br/>
purse on a belt, or that held it closed.  So in the 17th century, there were <br/>
still pouches in use.  The song is considered to be older than that, but from <br/>
just that purse clue it goes back at least to 17th C.<br/>
