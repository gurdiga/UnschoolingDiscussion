<div id="ygrps-yiv-62397388">Hi all,<br/>
I just want to add that I think Sandra made a very valid point !!!!!!<br/>
The point was if people were really interested they would research <br/>
it but they are looking for a confrontation !!!!!<br/>
Boy ! That really nails it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
I have found that to be so true for me because I can hear it in <br/>
people voices as they question me !!!<br/>
Also someone else said &quot;There was no friendly curiosity and desire <br/>
to really understand&quot; I think that about sums up the majority of <br/>
people who question me LOL........<br/>
Can anyone tell I have PMS LOL...........<br/>
Sonya,<br/>

P.S. I look forward to meeting you this summer @ the Live and Learn <br/>
conference Sandra :)</div>
