<div id="ygrps-yiv-71871658">Actually Kelly I don&#39;t see this as an unschooling issue but an issue with<br/>
marriage, which is obviously what it is.  For a husband (in this case) to<br/>
lay down the law about what he wants and yet he&#39;s not the one that&#39;s doing<br/>
what he wants, he wants someone else to do what he wants (LOL) namely his<br/>
wife is not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not lucky to have married a man where we have a lot in common, it was<br/>
planned that I would be married to someone who had the same belief systems<br/>
as me.  That&#39;s not luck, that&#39;s good dating, interviewing them and then<br/>
making a decision about whether he was marriage material, which is what he<br/>
did with me.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt whether unschooling is the only problem in a household where a<br/>
husband has an attitude of proof.<br/>
<br/>
I notice the defensiveness and the continual helpful other e-mails about how<br/>
to give him what he wants.... My question is why?  Why does a wife have to<br/>
passify her husband&#39;s fears?  The only response I can see that makes any<br/>
sense is Sandra&#39;s in having him go with them to some unschooling events.<br/>
Also acting like grown women with power instead of giving it away.<br/>
<br/>
Also what does this show our children, both boys and girls.  They learn the<br/>
majority of life skills from us and if a wife is running around like a<br/>
chicken with her head cut off to try and give her husband what he wants it<br/>
sets up unhealthy relationships and expectations for the kids.  Boys can<br/>
assume they will be with someone who will constantly  try to please them and<br/>
girls learn it&#39;s their job to please men.... Don&#39;t believe me?  Read some<br/>
psychological books.<br/>
<br/>
Again this is an area that I have studied extensively around women and<br/>
marriage and what works and what doesn&#39;t in the long run.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they&#39;re also his kids, and he loves them.  He feels responsible for <br/>
them.  So when there are differences, you talk about it, negotiate, <br/>
compromise.<br/>
We had our son in the hospital because dh&#39;s first child had some real <br/>
difficulties at birth.  He would have been extremely stressed out by a home <br/>
birth.  If I hadn&#39;t been able to find a doctor and hospital situation that <br/>
was comfortable for me, I would have had to put my comfort level over <br/>
his.  (I had a great doc.  My list of wants and don&#39;t wants was his <br/>
standard procedure.)<br/>
We compromised on vaccinations and did some.  We started unschooling on <br/>
more or less a trial basis.  (He had a good school experience.)  Now he&#39;s a <br/>
big supporter.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;sets up unhealthy relationships and expectations for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t see that.  I saw examples of women working at their marriage and <br/>
its issues, one of which is education of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Boys can<br/>

issue.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Again this is an area that I have studied extensively around women and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hope you&#39;re not implying that anyone who disagrees with you hasn&#39;t <br/>
studied these things themselves.<br/>
I married a man I love and respect who is *very* different from me.  It <br/>
hasn&#39;t always been easy, listening to each other&#39;s point of view and <br/>
compromising on issues that were important to me.  But guess what?  Our <br/>
marriage just keeps getting stronger and happier.  Our son has two very <br/>
different role models to pick and choose from.  He&#39;s grown up watching two <br/>
people work things out between them.  Working things out with dh has really <br/>
helped me work things out with my son, who is also *very* different from me.<br/>

<br/>
I find it fascinating living in the Middle East where all marriages are<br/>
arranged by family that so many are very happy. A lot of it has to do with<br/>
expectations. If you don&#39;t expect your marriage to be all roses then the<br/>
good times are all uphill.<br/>
In the Friday newspaper (which is like Sunday in the West) there are<br/>
hundreds of ads for the Indian and Pakistani families looking for &quot;boys&quot; or<br/>
&quot;girls&quot; to marry their children. They specify all kinds of funny things<br/>
such as &quot;must be homely!&quot; <br/>
This has nothing to do with the subject so I&#39;ll quit now:)<br/>

alike and also very easy going so things get decided so easily. Whenever we<br/>
disagree on something my daughter thinks we&#39;re fighting. And I don&#39;t mean a<br/>
yelling, match just disagree. The angriest anyone ever gets around here is<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 A vwry wise local unschooler once pointed out to me that words make a big<br/>
difference in how we are perceived and how others perceive us. When one says<br/>
My husband won&#39;t let me.....<br/>
My husband says I have to show him.....<br/>
It creates an atmosphere of unbalanced power. It&#39;s very different than:<br/>
My husband isn&#39;t sure how this works and I would like to reassure him.<br/>
negotiating is vital to a healthy relationship, as is trust and faith. Joey<br/>
didn&#39;t understand unschooling at first, not many do. I said to him, Do you<br/>
believe that I love our children and would Never do anything to harm them or<br/>
make their lives more difficult? He answered Yes (ding ding ding!! you win<br/>
the $64,000!!) I told him that I would answer any questions he had, offer<br/>
him things that I&#39;ve read, quotes from people, etc. but he must trust me<br/>
first and then he will begin to understand. That it takes time.<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure that Dawn&#39;s statement is simply about unschooling. It<br/>
reminds me of going out with friends without Joe. Sometimes people would<br/>
say, Joe will *let* you go out? (What am I? His slave?)(he just looked over<br/>
my shoulder and said, &quot;Yes, you are&quot; - In his dreams!!)<br/>
I still call him and make sure he doesn&#39;t have plans or something but I make<br/>
my own decisions just as he does. It&#39;s the way we phrase things in our<br/>
society that harken back to the days before women&#39;s liberation.<br/>
My husband won&#39;t let me.<br/>
Mr. Policeman says.... (from a toy)<br/>
Look at all the fireMEN!<br/>
I sence alot of the same when we talk about our DHs, that we have to prove<br/>
our intentions to the man of the house. I don&#39;t think we mean to come across<br/>
this way, but it makes it more difficult for women to be seen as powerful<br/>
and knowledgeable when we talk in this way.<br/>

looking for &quot;no competition&quot;? Are homely and<br/>

<br/>
My XDH was extremely handsome. With many talents and<br/>
skills he had a, hmmm, more than active social life. <br/>
My little sister(then 14), of whom I had custody, said<br/>
to me one day &quot;I&#39;ll never marry a handsome man.&quot; She<br/>
had the impression that good looks go with lots of<br/>
independent social activity. She saw that this hurt me<br/>
(thought I concealed it)and decided to avoid a similar<br/>
situation by finding a homely man.  Well....she found<br/>
LOTS of boy-friends of EVERY description and her<br/>
husband of over 20 years is a nice enough looking,<br/>
good hearted, good parent, good everything, OK man.<br/>
<br/>
BUT I did allow the situation to exist, for a while,<br/>
that made the wrong impression on her.....and I do<br/>
regret that.  But it wore off :-) What she didn&#39;t see,<br/>
was that I couldn&#39;t participate in the fun stuff with<br/>
my peers (well, anything) because I was too busy  with<br/>
HER. (She was a drinking, sexually active mess!!!)  Oh<br/>
well. Dunno for sure if she realizes her role in that<br/>
yet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142473900">As usual what I said was twisted and turned.... From my reading of the first<br/>
e-mail (sorry don&#39;t know who wrote it, I respond to e-mails and don&#39;t<br/>
usually look at who wrote it) talked about proving and justifying to her<br/>
husband about how unschooling works.  My response is that if my husband asks<br/>
me to prove or justify anything to him, I would laugh because I don&#39;t have<br/>
to prove or justify what I&#39;m doing to him.  I&#39;m a grown up and don&#39;t need<br/>
his permission to do what I want to do....<br/>
<br/>
Now if he were to ask me questions  about unschooling (that&#39;s if he&#39;d never<br/>
read anything or actually been involved) I have places I can point him to on<br/>
the internet, books he could read, lists he can join (he actually reads this<br/>
one, just doesn&#39;t post), people he can talk too..<br/>
<br/>
Because my husband has chosen to quit a full time job and take a contracting<br/>
job so that he can spend more time with the kids, he&#39;s actually home quite a<br/>
bit.  Last Friday he and the boys spent the day at a monster truck rally,<br/>
something all 3 of them love to do.  On Monday we are all off to the Pima<br/>
County Fair as it&#39;s dollar day.  Next week he&#39;s taking 3 hours off in the<br/>
middle of the day to meet me at the Ice Skating rink for Zak&#39;s first lesson.<br/>
He&#39;s one of the coaches on Zak&#39;s soccer team, goes to every match (sometimes<br/>
alone with both kids)..  Although my husband is not 50% involved on a daily<br/>
basis we have organized our lives so that he&#39;s around a lot more than many<br/>
husbands.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I don&#39;t need to prove or justify anything to him because he&#39;s<br/>
involved with the kids on a daily basis and can see what they are learning.<br/>
If he suggests something he wants to do with the kids and he&#39;s talking to me<br/>
about it my comment is usually &quot;that sounds interesting&quot; and he and they<br/>
take on a project and see if it works out.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Zak and I made Buzz Lightyear wings for him and I couldn&#39;t quite<br/>
figure out how to keep them on, so when DH arrived home he found the perfect<br/>
solution and continued with the rest of the costume.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts....  Maybe we are just very compatible when it comes to<br/>
our belief systems about the kids and that doesn&#39;t seem to be such a bad<br/>
thing.<br/>

Interesting they call themselves boys and girls even in their 20s and 30s.<br/>
40 seems to be the point where they become men -- though no one mentions<br/>
being or wanting a woman! (Though I&#39;m still not totally comfortable with the<br/>
term woman for myself since it seems to come with the burden of being mature<br/>
and responsible ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And the mentions of the communities (perhaps?) they&#39;re from: Keralite, Goan,<br/>
Marthomite, Nair, Ezhava. What significance is that? Are the cultures that<br/>
different in the various areas? Or something else?<br/>

Arab students say they are girls and not ladies or women because they<br/>
aren&#39;t married. <br/>

thing. Most people don&#39;t like to marry outside their group as there is a<br/>
lot of stigma and negativity towards &quot;mixed&quot; couples.<br/>
