-=-It&#39;s funny that the words &quot;peaceful parenting&quot; became an issue in the<br/>
previous discussion, because all that forethought and attention to<br/>
factors outside of the actual incident between kids, all that *action*<br/>
but not *reaction* -- that *is* what I think of as peaceful parenting.<br/>
Not just the talk -- heck, my 2 y.o. doesn&#39;t talk yet and as I said,<br/>
my 8 y.o. sometimes can&#39;t verbalize.Â  But seeing the whole picture,<br/>
and seeing the world through my children&#39;s eyes, so I can create a<br/>
space for them that leads to more peaceful living -- all that, to me,<br/>
is peaceful parenting.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is all of unschooling to me, including the parenting and the learning <br/>
situation and the freedom and respect and choices.    I consider it my role as <br/>
the parent who wants these things to happen and to unfold really well to create <br/>
a nest, and environment, in which learning happens easily, children can get <br/>
along with each other or get away from each other, choices are varied and <br/>
workable, there is safety to come home to any hour of the day, and there are <br/>
opportunities for various combinations of people (Holly really likes to be with <br/>
Marty lately; Keith sometimes wants to find good reasons to spend time with Kirby, <br/>
etc.).   There needs to be a variety of good and interesting food.   Clothes <br/>
and towels need to be clean.   If I want kids to keep taking baths because <br/>
they want to, soap, shampoo and conditioner need to be readily available.   <br/>
<br/>
I know from personal experience LOTS of ways to create an edgy, <br/>
insecure-feeling environment.   I could drink a lot, only buy toilet paper when it runs <br/>
out, not feed the dog but just yell at kids if the dogfood dish was empty, give <br/>
away or throw away kids&#39; clothes I didn&#39;t like, throw away any odd puzzle or <br/>
game pieces I came across, not tell people where I was going or when I&#39;d be <br/>
back, play music loudly if it&#39;s something I like that others don&#39;t like...    Oh I <br/>
could go on, but having that checklist inside me keeps me alert to who to be. <br/>
   And so I don&#39;t drink a lot, I get toilet paper before we&#39;re out, I keep <br/>
the dog fed (and others help willingly), I never throw things away without <br/>
asking, I try to keep games and puzzles intact, I am considerate about movies and <br/>
music and leave a note if I&#39;m going somewhere (or tell people, if they&#39;re awake <br/>
and home).    I learned those things from knowing what it feels like to wish <br/>
I had them.<br/>
<br/>
I try to give my children what I wish I had had, or at least I offer it.   I <br/>
try to do for them what I was glad people did for me when I was growing up.   <br/>
I watch them for clues, needs, desires, curiosities, interests, and I feather <br/>
the next with what they seem to lack.<br/>
<br/>
When there&#39;s a disagreement about something, not only does each child learn a <br/>
little (or a lot) about how to avoid it in the future, but I also learn what <br/>
I could do to help them have more space or opportunity to avoid such <br/>
frustrations &quot;next time&quot; (preventing many &quot;next times&quot; as we go).<br/>
<br/>
I chose to live with my husband.   I chose to have children.    Holly didn&#39;t <br/>
choose to live with Kirby.   Kirby didn&#39;t choose to live with Marty.    They <br/>
don&#39;t have to maintain a relationship for the rest of their lives.   I think <br/>
they will choose to do so, but they don&#39;t have the legal or social obligation I <br/>
have to Keith and that I have to each of them.<br/>
