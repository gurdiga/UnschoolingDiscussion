Ah, you reminded me of some &quot;tallest things&quot; fun we had once. Our<br/>
neighbor friend back in Pensacola (schooled) asked us what the tallest<br/>
waterfall in the world was. I guessed Angel Falls and when we looked<br/>
it up, it WAS.<br/>
<br/>
So then, we took some big paper and I drew Angel Falls height (I think<br/>
we used 1&quot;=10 feet or something) and compared it to Niagara (which she<br/>
thought was the tallest, but is actually highest volume).<br/>
<br/>
So then they wanted to know how some buildings compared, so we added<br/>
the Empire State building, the Sears tower and some building in Japan.<br/>
By then, we had no room left on the paper, so we took the measuring<br/>
tape and laid it out on the sidewalk. They were flipping out!<br/>
<br/>
Our little friend said &quot;NOW I see how learning can be fun!!!&quot;<br/>
She has vowed to homeschool her own children. :)<br/>
