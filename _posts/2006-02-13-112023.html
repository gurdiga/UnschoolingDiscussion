<div id="ygrps-yiv-114780926">&quot; I know I&#39;d be very<br/>
interested in hearing updates, knowing when I could light candles and<br/>
keep them in my thoughts, and knowing where I might be able to buy<br/>
take-out or grocery-store gift certificates or something that could ease<br/>
their minds at least a bit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, could you let us know about this if you get it going Kelli? That<br/>
website would be really great.<br/>
I was telling my dh who Diana was (someone I&#39;ve loved since her<br/>
earliest posts...that sigline was the BEST; &quot;wackiest widow west of<br/>
the Mississipi&quot; I think?) and how everytime I saw her at the<br/>
conference, she had a HUGE smile on her face. She positively radiates joy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling SO sad about this. It would feel really good to have some<br/>
info. on different ways we can help, aside from letters and cards and<br/>
other good wishes.<br/>
