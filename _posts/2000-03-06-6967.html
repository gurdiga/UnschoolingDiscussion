<div><font face="Times New Roman">&lt;&lt; For all of you who have gotten all of 
those e-mails that promise wealth, <br>happiness, etc. if you send this email to 
10 billion people,&nbsp; and those <br>emails that alarm and frighten - here 
they all are rolled into one.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I was on my 
way to the post office to pick up my case of free M&amp;M&#39;s,(sent to <br>me 
because I forwarded their e-mail to five other people, celebrating the <br>fact 
that the year 2000 is &quot;MM&quot; in Roman numerals), when I ran into a friend 
<br>whose neighbor, a young man, was home recovering from having been served a 
<br>rat in his bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken - which is predictable, since as 
<br>everyone knows, there&#39;s no actual chicken in Kentucky Fried Chicken, which 
is <br>why the government made them change their name to KFC.<br>&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;Anyway, one day this guy went to sleep and when he awoke he was in his 
<br>bathtub and it was full of ice and he was sore all over and when he got out 
<br>of the tub he realized that HIS KIDNEYS HAD BEEN STOLEN. He saw a note on 
his <br>mirror that said &quot;Call 911!&quot; but he was afraid to use his phone because 
it <br>was connected to his computer, and there was a virus on his computer that 
<br>would destroy his hard drive if he opened e-mail entitled &quot;Join the 
crew!&quot;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;He knew it wasn&#39;t a hoax because he himself was a 
computer programmer who <br>was working on software to prevent a global disaster 
in which all the <br>computers get together and distribute the $250.00 
Neiman-Marcus cookie recipe <br>under the leadership of Bill Gates. (It&#39;s true - 
I read it all last week in a <br>mass e-mail from BILL GATES HIMSELF, who was 
also promising me a free Disney <br>World vacation and $5,000 if I would forward 
the e-mail to everyone I know.)<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;The poor man then tried to 
call 911 from a pay phone to report his missing <br>kidneys, but a voice on the 
line first asked him to press #90, which <br>unwittingly gave the bandit full 
access to the phone line at the guy&#39;s <br>expense.<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;Then, 
reaching into the coin-return slot he got jabbed with an HIV-infected <br>needle 
around which was wrapped around a note that said, &quot;Welcome to the <br>world of 
AIDS.&quot; Luckily he was only a few blocks from the hospital - the one&nbsp; 
<br>where that little boy who is dying of cancer is, the one whose last wish is 
<br>for everyone in the world to send him an e-mail and the American Cancer 
<br>Society has agreed to pay him a nickel for every e-mail he receives.&nbsp; I 
sent <br>him two e-mails and one of them was a bunch of x&#39;s and o&#39;s in the shape 
of an <br>angel (if you get it and forward it to more than 10 people, you will 
have <br>good luck but for 10 people you will only have OK luck and if you send 
it to <br>fewer than 10 people you will have BAD LUCK FOR SEVEN 
YEARS).<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;So anyway the poor guy tried to drive himself to the 
hospital, but on the <br>way he noticed another car driving without its lights 
on. To be helpful, he <br>flashed his lights at him and was promptly shot as 
part of a gang initiation. <br>Send THIS to all the friends who send you their 
junk mail and you will <br>receive 4 green m&amp;ms, but if you don&#39;t the owner 
of Proctor and Gamble will <br>report you to his Satanist friends and you will 
have more bad luck: you will <br>get cancer from the Sodium Laureth Sulfate in 
your<br>&nbsp;shampoo, your wife will develop breast cancer from using the 
antiperspirant <br>which clogs the pores under your arms, and the government 
will put a tax on <br>your e-mails forever. I know this is all true &#39;cause I 
read it on the <br>Internet.</font></div></html></div>
