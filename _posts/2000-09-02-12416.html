Others have said it, but I want to emphasize that you usually lose your baby<br/>
teeth depending on how early you got them in.  Most of my kids and I got<br/>
ours &quot;late&quot;....nearly 12 months, so I figured they&#39;d start losing them<br/>
around age 7, like I did. But I have some nieces and nephews who got their<br/>
teeth early, at 4-6 months like your son (my sil is positive this is a sign<br/>
of high intelligence...oh, and the amount of hair shows that, too...agh!) so<br/>
they lost teeth right and left starting at 5 years. They all took very good<br/>
care of their teeth...it was normal, having nothing to do with a tooth<br/>
rotting and falling out. If that were the case, wouldn&#39;t it look and feel<br/>
rotten? It takes quite a bit of neglect for that to happen, not just<br/>
forgetting to brush once in awhile. I know I was terrible about it as a<br/>
child. I had a mouthful of cavities, but they never just fell out.<br/>

quarter after that. :)</div>
