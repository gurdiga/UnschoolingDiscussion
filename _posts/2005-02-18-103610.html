I&#39;m  addicted to using my 1948 Cat 12 road grader.  I love driving it.<br/>
I  love tinkering with it.  I even love the sound of the pony engine<br/>
over  the main engine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
 <br/>
Love doesn&#39;t equal addiction.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-For that matter--how many of the 1,600-odd people here  consider<br/>
themselves to be unschoolers even though they haven&#39;t bought  road<br/>
graders for their children?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The things we do have, our children are free to use, examine, drive (once  <br/>
they&#39;re old enough to drive, that&#39;s fine and even before they were old enough  <br/>
we&#39;d take the easiest van out late at night in empty parking lots and let them  <br/>
drive if they wanted to), read, play with, see.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I think the argument that not having something is incompatible  with<br/>
unschooling is flawed.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Not having trust in children&#39;s abilities to learn is incompatible with  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
There are some things that can really put a damper on unschooling success:  <br/>
Negativity.  Depression.  Cynicism.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-If I get rid of my road grader (my neighbors are interested), will  I<br/>
be making the choice for my children to not be able to have the  road<br/>
grader?<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
We have six automobiles.  One we inherited from an elderly neighbor;  it <br/>
doesn&#39;t run. One can only be driven by Keith.  We could sell one and  still have <br/>
automobiles.  We could sell all and ride the bus, I suppose, but  that&#39;s hard <br/>
to do in New Mexico.  Each of our driving teens has a regular  car to use, but <br/>
he doesn&#39;t own it.  They use mine sometimes; Kirby did  tonight, so he could <br/>
include his sister in a little outing (with her it was five  kids, and the <br/>
other car only carried four).  We&#39;re really flexible about  who drives what.<br/>
 <br/>
I have thousands of books.  I have given away and sold and traded and  <br/>
acquired books throughout the years.  My store of books isn&#39;t all the books  in the <br/>
world.  My kids have books of their own, and we share back and  forth.  I <br/>
think any unschooler who gets rid of a book or even hundreds  isn&#39;t compromising <br/>
unschooling.   I would think an unschooler who got  rid of ALL her books, or <br/>
refused to allow a child to read books, or  characterized book reading in <br/>
negative and belittling ways might be displaying  some questionable logic.<br/>
