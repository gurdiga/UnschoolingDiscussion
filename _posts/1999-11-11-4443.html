This is such a big topic and I am a little rushed for time.  This fellow Gordon<br/>
Neufeld whose seminar I am taking is certainly influencing my thinking though<br/>
almost entirely in directions which I have already moved in.  Our experience in<br/>
his course is probably 90% confirmation of our existing practices and beliefs.<br/>
The 10% difference for me is very important though.<br/>
<br/>
He is vehemently opposed to time-outs as a method of discipline.  He believe it<br/>
works because it stimulates separation anxiety which works in the short term<br/>
but damages the attachment.  I think in the example of a child playing with the<br/>
cord while someone is vacuuming is primarily a question of using distraction,<br/>
rearranging the vacuuming so it is not an issue, questioning what the dangers<br/>
really are.<br/>
<br/>
Getting &quot;obedience&quot; from a 1.5 year old is not really in the cards.  Of course<br/>
you stop a child from dangerous things but getting them to internalize such<br/>
behaviour at that age is not going to happen at least not every time.  You just<br/>
have to stop them from doing the thing one way or the other without resorting<br/>
to using the attachment stuff as a weapon to force compliance.<br/>
<br/>
Especially with sensitive children (most are) using the attachment in a fear<br/>
engendering fashion results in children armouring themselves which then makes<br/>
the discipline process that much more difficult especially when the chickens<br/>
all come home to roost in adolescence.<br/>
<br/>
Also I personally do not believe in eliciting apologies from children.  If they<br/>
are sorry they can be helped to express it but if they are not it is an<br/>
exercise in crazy-making. &quot;You tell your sister you are sorry.&quot; is a lie if you<br/>
aren&#39;t sorry at all and wish that your sister (at that moment) had never been<br/>
born.<br/>
<br/>
Also it is a challenge having a big for their age kid because everyone keeps<br/>
expecting behaviour that is not age appropriate because we all confuse size<br/>
with age.  I feel for these kids because sometime people are so unfair in their<br/>
expectations of them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the now christened (by me) Neufeld method emphasizing moving closer when<br/>
disciplining and minimizing separation.  When there is trouble get close.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to go on longer but gotta go.<br/>
<br/>
This whole subject is fascinating to me and helps me clarify what I believe<br/>
which increases the likelihood that I will behave that way.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The power we have as parents is enormous but to use it to manipulate<br/>
&gt; children is<br/>
&gt; &gt;the epitome of penny wise pound foolish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hey Joel,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Could you elaborate a bit as to the harmful ways in which we manipulate our<br/>
&gt; children?  I am in the throws of developing discipline practices that are<br/>
&gt; successful for my toddler boys (20 months and 35 months) and will soon need<br/>
&gt; to start all over again when our older adopted girl(or girls) come home, as<br/>
&gt; I am positive they will be dealing with attachment, trust and abandonment<br/>
&gt; issues, at the least.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I generally use time outs in his bedroom (2-5 min) for my almost three year<br/>
&gt; old about once a day (on average, some days less some days more) for series<br/>
&gt; problems like purposefully hurting his brother and refusing to apoloize,<br/>
&gt; tantrums, refusing to desist in an activity despite numerous warnings, etc.<br/>
&gt;  This usually has fairly good results, and is always followed up by a quiet<br/>
&gt; lap conversation about the offending behavior and what he should have done,<br/>
&gt; and often an apology to anyone who was hurt by his behavior (like brother,<br/>
&gt; or me or Daddy.)  Usually he is raring to go and wants to run off and play<br/>
&gt; afterward, but occassionally he needs calming after a tantrum and so I will<br/>
&gt; cuddle with him and pet him and give him lots of reassurance for a while,<br/>
&gt; until he is ready to get down and play.  I never strike my boys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Baby (1.5 yr. old) has only ever had three time outs, for about a<br/>
&gt; minute each, for purposefully pushing and disobeying in a dangerous<br/>
&gt; situation after numerous warnings (like playing with the electrical cord<br/>
&gt; while Daddy is vacuming) but he is generally really easy.  I try not to<br/>
&gt; even raise my voice with him, as he is so sensastive that it usually makes<br/>
&gt; him cry if I look or sound cross.  I try to make things into a game and use<br/>
&gt; humor to teach him, as he does not get upset and is much more receptive to<br/>
&gt; that.  He has a very gentle personality and does not respond well to<br/>
&gt; agression, and also cries when his brother gets too rough in play (a<br/>
&gt; frequent problem, with my rough and tumble, sports loving older boy!)  We<br/>
&gt; refer to our &quot;little&quot; guy as our gentle giant, because he is so very<br/>
&gt; gentle, and quiet but he is the same size as his brother and both wear size<br/>
&gt; 2 or 3 clothes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a side note, he has a really interesting personality.  Even though he is<br/>
&gt; shy, people are attracted to him in an irresistable way.  My older son is a<br/>
&gt; BIG flirt and has a magnetic personality, dimples, red hair and blue eyes<br/>
&gt; with long thick lashes.  I KNOW why people are drawn to him, he is cute and<br/>
&gt; talks incessently to everyone and is not the least bit shy.  His brother,<br/>
&gt; however, is shy and hides from strangers (although he has recently started<br/>
&gt; waving and saying &quot;Hi&quot; to people) but he has the most amazing affect on<br/>
&gt; people.  Everyone he meets wants to hold him and kiss him and he has this<br/>
&gt; incredible calming effect on them.  People have described feeling washed<br/>
&gt; over with peace when they hold him.  When he was an infant, everyone who<br/>
&gt; held him fell asleep!  It makes me wonder about him, his purpose, or since<br/>
&gt; I believe in reincarnation, I wonder if he has previously been some kind of<br/>
&gt; a healer.  I look forward to seeing who he will grow to be.<br/>
