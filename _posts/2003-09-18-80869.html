 </span></blockquote>How about just emailing the person back and saying that you find this <br/>
email horribly offensive.  That beating a child with a rod is much <br/>
more offensive than face paint and Harry Potter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97004716">I&#39;m feeling a little depressed today. Last night an email from a &#39;friend&#39; arrived. She thought I might find it worth reading. She had forwarded a Jonathon Lindvall newsletter to me as he had all sorts of ignorant sorry, interesting things to say about the evils of Harry Potter and Yu-Gi-Oh and Tolkien and C.S.Lewis. This was because when we visited last week, I took face paints and Jess wanted specs and a lightening scar. <br/>
<br/>
This is the second time I&#39;ve been sent one of these horribly offensive emails, the last time it was over spanking because it came up in conversation that we didn&#39;t.  I got to read about the pleasures of taking your children to the hardware shop so they could choose their own rod. (I&#39;m not kidding!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, part of me wants to respond (ruthlessly&lt;g&gt;) but it would then turn into a huge issue and I&#39;m not sure I want to go there. <br/>
<br/>
I feel like I&#39;m covered in stinksap! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can just see there will be less and less I can share with other mums if I get offensive emails telling me what some stupid man thinks everytime I open my mouth about the fun we are having. Grrr. Especially one who dares to bag Tolkien. &lt;g&gt;  He &quot;reflects a lack of recognition of the danger of the appearance of evil.&quot; What!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, rant over. Going to go make a cup of tea and breathe. <br/>

<br/>
Go dig up one of your best unschooling/non-spanking/virtues of <br/>
fanatasy character articles and forward it to her.  Nothing dramatic <br/>
with just a little &quot;I thought you might enjoy this&quot; note.  No <br/>
confrontation, but if she feels comfortable doing it, why shouldn&#39;t <br/>
you?  Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

thought was a friend. I think evil lies in the hearts of people who tell <br/>
others how to live.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326577012">Just send her a message back containing an article about the benefits of<br/>
those things, or how silly it is to be scared of them.  I remember an<br/>
article (or website) someone wrote where they actually tried to do the<br/>
magic from the HP books and didn’t succeed, thus “proving” parents<br/>
didn’t have to worry about their children learning witchcraft from the<br/>
books.  Send her some articles on positive disciple, or if you want to<br/>
be more direct, on the dangers and damage spanking can cause.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t know your situation specifically, and don’t know if I would want<br/>
to maintain a close friendship with someone who had such polar opposite<br/>
parenting ideas than I did, but doing the above might be a way to<br/>
continue the friendship and get the emails to stop.  If you’re not<br/>
interested in preserving the friendship, I’d probably send her a more<br/>
personal note.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes down to it, everyone has en expert in their corner who<br/>
will validate whatever parenting choices they’re making.  Hopefully<br/>
she’s understand that if you sent her some material supporting your<br/>
philosophies.<br/>
