<div id="ygrps-yiv-274249604">I hate to clog this list up with my whinings, but have a question for people <br/>
out there. How to balance the time with my children . I don&#39;t seem to be able <br/>
to this very well.My son is 7 years, daughter is 18mos. She does not sleep <br/>
with any great regularity. I try to read to ds and she is all over us like a <br/>
bad smell. I have tried setting her with stuff to do, but she is still so <br/>
little and has such a short attention span. We hardly read at all right <br/>
now!!!! If we try to do any art or lego or puzzles or anything she  wrecks <br/>
it. I am trying to take the approach that this too will pass, but I am <br/>
getting frustrated today!! I feel as if I am neglecting my son. My husband is <br/>
not overly involved with  the kids when he is home, unless I set him a <br/>
specific task, which I hate doing.Even if he tries, dd is very single-minded <br/>
and hard to distract when she wants to be involved with what we are doing. I <br/>
try to involve her, but I realize that this is developmental. Anyone else <br/>
experience this? Any suggestions?<br/>

 <br/>
Do you read to her too or just to her brother?  Can she sit on your lap<br/>
when you read?  My two year old sits on my lap when I read to his<br/>
brother and he expects a kiss after every sentence (sometimes he doesn&#39;t<br/>
wait for the end of the sentence) and sometimes he tries to turn the<br/>
page too soon.  If he gets too distracting, we give him a picture book<br/>
of his own to flip through while we read.<br/>

Well, that&#39;s what babies do.  It would be easier for you and your son to<br/>
stop getting annoyed about it than for her to stop doing it.  Or, you<br/>
could put two stools next to the kitchen counter and do art or legos or<br/>
puzzles up there where she can&#39;t reach.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; experience this? Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, very par for the course with a young toddler. We just saved <br/>
Legos, puzzles, etc. for her nap times when our daughter was this <br/>
age. We used a baby gate to give our son an area to keep and play <br/>
with the Legos that she couldn&#39;t get into, until she no longer <br/>
wrecked them. Other great toddler distractions - a pan full of cups, <br/>
spoons and cornmeal or millet, a stepstool and a sink with water and <br/>
soap and funnels and cups, a stamp pad and some stamps - our daughter <br/>
loved to decorate herself.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it&#39;s hard while you&#39;re in it, but it&#39;s a wonderful phase <br/>
as well and it will pass all too soon. Every phase can have its <br/>
moments where you can say &quot;I can&#39;t wait for this to pass&quot;, but then <br/>
of course it does, along with all the beautiful things that came <br/>
along with it. There will be dozens and dozens of years when she <br/>
won&#39;t crawl in your lap every 2 seconds, KWIM? In the meantime, try <br/>
to hang in there and just exist in toddler time. See if you can find <br/>
ways to give your older child some space where they can play without <br/>
being subject to the destructo-toddler. And use her naptimes as <br/>
special time to connect with the older child.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

I think that today I am venting and feeling some concerns that typically <br/>
would not be there. This little guffer simply does not nap, so we are busy <br/>
all the time. Her brother has a room for his stuff that the sister shouldnt <br/>
have right now. I really need to be reminded that this will pass all too <br/>
soon, and  you have done that. <br/>
I celebrate this child each and every day, and the wonderful spirit that she <br/>
has. I am missing the connecting with her brother now and then, and worry <br/>
about my ability to meet both of their needs effectivily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814654769">Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  I would have responded way differently if I&#39;d realized<br/>
it was just a vent.  I would have commiserated.  <br/>
 <br/>
My husband had a job for about two years where he was only home on<br/>
weekends and sometimes he wasn&#39;t home every weekend.  It was just me and<br/>
my kids all the time.  When he got a job where he could be home daily,<br/>
it quickly became clear that he didn&#39;t know how to deal with our older<br/>
son, who is very spirited and strong-willed.  Every single night for the<br/>
first six months or so, my husband would tell my son to do something and<br/>
my son would say no and my husband would try to insist, and my son would<br/>
throw a screaming fit.  <br/>
 <br/>
I kept trying to explain to my husband that our son will never cooperate<br/>
if you try to push him (and I had some resentment that if he&#39;d been<br/>
around more he would already know that).  My husband just kept insisting<br/>
that I wasn&#39;t strict enough with the kids (and he had some jealousy<br/>
because my son willing cooperates with me).  Luckily the whole thing<br/>
passed, my husband learned how to interact with our son and my son<br/>
learned how to express himself without screaming.  <br/>
 <br/>
But in the meantime, I sent my mom long, rambling email vents nearly<br/>
everyday.  And I said a lot of things in my vents that were much harsher<br/>
than &quot;all over me like a bad smell.&quot;  I can&#39;t remember exactly what I<br/>
said, but it usually had something to do with wanting to take the baby<br/>
and move to another country.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872071591">---Hey, Sorcha, I am pretty sure I asked for help in that vent, so <br/>
It&#39;s my deal, not yours! I was glad to hear what you had to say. I am <br/>
new to communicating with this medium, and forget that what you write <br/>
is what you get, no facial expression and the people don&#39;t know me. <br/>
What I wrote sounded pretty grumpy, and I am glad you stuck up for my <br/>
kid!!! I would do the same. I am relieved to hear that you didn&#39;t <br/>
leave the country, but I understand what you mean by that.This is the <br/>
first time that dd has been the one to be targeted as the cause of my <br/>
frustration. I think that happens when they get so busy and mom is <br/>
not taking care of herself.  Rest assured that I am feeling better <br/>
thanks t<br/>
o the  stuff I read here. My kids both are attachment parented and <br/>
treated empathically. My ds nursed to5and a half, dd will be done on <br/>
her own schedule also. She is the apple of everyone&#39;s eye around here <br/>
and we treat her accordingly. I was just hoping someone on this list  <br/>
would have a magic solution for me!! Thanks again,   <br/>
