I am  relatively new to this list -- I joined after attending the Live and <br/>
Learn  conference. I have to say that this conference was really altering to me <br/>
and  _my family_ (mip://02344400/my%20family) . We have always felt  <br/>
uncomfortable in our local homeschooling groups, and truthfully didn&#39;t quite  <br/>
understand why. I must say that after a day at the conference we all just  started <br/>
feeling like we had found home. My daughter felt totally comfortable,  and <br/>
commented that everyone she met was different, and it was okay! They were  not <br/>
necessarily different like her, but different like themselves. So after  trying to <br/>
figure out what type of learners we are, we have learned that we are  much more <br/>
in tune with unschoolers. Why has it taken us so long? I am learning  so much <br/>
from this list, and I am questioning so much about myself as a parent.  And I <br/>
agree with needing to be around people who inspire me. Thank  you!<br/>

This was so nice to read! <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad you made it to the conference----and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re  here!<br/>
