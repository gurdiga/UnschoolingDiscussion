<div id="ygrps-yiv-187521523">I just wanted to let folks know that I&#39;ll be speaking in Florida at<br/>
the end of the month:<br/>
<br/>
January 31 in Orlando; February 1 in Tampa; February 2 in Delray<br/>
Beach.  Send me a message and I&#39;ll be happy to send you the program<br/>
and the contact person. In all three places I am doing &quot;Don&#39;t Worry,<br/>
Be Happy: On the Curriculum of Happiness&quot;, and in two of them, &quot;Beans<br/>
and the Curriculum of Creamed Corn&quot; (also called &quot;Education and<br/>
Everyday Life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you live in said subtropical place, that has a REAL sun (not like<br/>
the ersatz one we have here), I&#39;ll look forward to meeting you! (I<br/>
promise fun.)<br/>

PLEASE say hello to Florida for me!! Especially Tampa LOL!!! We used to live about two hours north, in a little place called Homosassa Springs...We have really missed Florida, particularly the sunshine!! We&#39;re now on Cape Cod thanks to the Coast Guard...and planning to ask to go back to FL in 2005 so we can thaw out!!! <br/>

David, do you ever sell tapes of your speaking engagements?  I am always <br/>
needing some inspiration in everyday life and ideas.  I&#39;ve about worn out my <br/>
Peaceful Parenting tape from Sandra!  And I&#39;ve not yet been able to get info on the <br/>
last unschooling conference tapes.<br/>
