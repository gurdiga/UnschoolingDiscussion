<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119666851">Hi,<br/>
  Well, I have met Wyndham, and he always seems fine to me. I did see him<br/>
get a gutter ball on a bumper bowling lane, but ya know, I did that the last<br/>
time our group bowled.<br/>
Maybe he is just a late bloomer.<br/>
Have you ever totally left him to his own devices? Letting him do all the<br/>
&quot;wasteful things&quot; that are painful to let slide-like watch TV for 200 hours<br/>
straight.<br/>
It kills me when Tori wants to watch cartoon network for days straight, but<br/>
she always snaps out of it, or when she walks around with her face in a<br/>
gameboy.<br/>
I was so disturbed when we bought that thing, and worried that she would do<br/>
nothing else. But like everything else, she gets passionate about it, and<br/>
then puts it down for weeks at a time or it runs out of batteries, and sits<br/>
on the shelf for months.<br/>
I know that you know your son better than anyone, only trying to be helpful.<br/>

There was a time when no one but me wanted him to be around - or that <br/>
being out in public was too stressful for me because I had keep him <br/>
in such close contact to ward off public displays of violence.  So I <br/>
guess we must be doing something right.<br/>

Bridget, <br/>
Doris Lessing wrote a novel called The Fifth Child that I think you would find very interesting. She has incredible insight into human nature and the influence of society on the family. This novel is one of her best. From what you write about your understanding of your child, the stress and confusion about your relationship with him and his influence on your family, I believe that this novel could unlock some answers for you. From the little I know of your situation it would appear that this novel could be about you and it certainly reflects the struggles we all encounter as mothers. Her work is a little difficult and a follow up discussion can be very helpful too so if you decide to read it and you want to discuss the ideas I&#39;d be happy to participate. <br/>
