<br/>
You could find out some mouth exercises for her. Katie&#39;s first speech <br/>
therapist had her doing &quot;kitty cat exercises&quot; where she had to wipe her lips <br/>
with her tongue, around and around. There were others, but that&#39;s the one <br/>
she liked the best. And exercising those muscles made more sense to me than <br/>
a lot of other stuff they had her doing. Using the muscles could only <br/>
strengthen the neuronal connections, which is what is needed. I bet there&#39;s <br/>
something online about mouth exercises.<br/>
<br/>
I also think you&#39;re REALLY smart to video tape her, because looking back <br/>
will show how much improved her speech is.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;***the physiological connections will come. I<br/>
&gt;think my daughter&#39;s years of speech therapy were...I hate to say<br/>
&gt;wasted,<br/>
&gt;but...wasted time and money, which also put her through a bit of<br/>
&gt;sadness<br/>
&gt;about herself, as young as four years of age, thinking she must be<br/>
&gt;stupid to<br/>
&gt;need lessons to talk. If I could do it again, I would not put her<br/>
&gt;through<br/>
&gt;that.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You see Heidi,...this is why I came *here* to discuss these things.<br/>
&gt;THANK YOU. You write what my gut tells me every single day. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know if there are different degrees of Apraxia...I need to do some<br/>
&gt;research on it - perhaps that is all that it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have felt all along that sending her to speech therapy would be<br/>
&gt;inappropriate for her personality. I know this child and I know that<br/>
&gt;she would feel horribly isolated going to a school or office, to a<br/>
&gt;special room, to learn to talk &quot;properly&quot;. I have suggested it to her<br/>
&gt;a couple times and really wish that I could take it back. At first she<br/>
&gt;thought it meant going to school (which she was all-for BTW...she is<br/>
&gt;one child that thinks she&#39;s missing out on &quot;something&quot; not going to<br/>
&gt;school...) until I explained that there would not be playmates there.<br/>
&gt;Of course she changed her mind. But I think that even that suggestion<br/>
&gt;(once or twice) may have impacted her to some degree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One time, when she was 3 1/2 I took her to the YMCA and let her stay<br/>
&gt;in the babysitting room while I went swimming. When I picked her up<br/>
&gt;she was irritable and bothered (much like she was after I would pick<br/>
&gt;her up after preschool those 6 weeks that she attended). I aksed her<br/>
&gt;what was wrong and she said that the kids kept asking her what her<br/>
&gt;name was, &quot;they wouldn&#39;t hear me!&quot; she kept saying. I felt so bad<br/>
&gt;because I knew it was that they couldn&#39;t understand her name<br/>
&gt;(&quot;Jocelyn&quot; isn&#39;t entirely common anyway). So we talked about it and I<br/>
&gt;told her that she should just say that &quot;people call me Joc&quot; since it<br/>
&gt;was easier to say. After that I became very aware of the whole, *whats<br/>
&gt;your name* moments and she&#39;d look to me for back up. I tried to always<br/>
&gt;only respond if she wanted me to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We just watched home videos from that time period yesterday. In 2.5<br/>
&gt;years she&#39;s come a very, very long way. So it will only get better.<br/>
