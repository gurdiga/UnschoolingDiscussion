<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And a question. I didn&#39;t do this, but wondered afterwards if I missed<br/>
&gt; a bit of an opportunity. Would it have been appropriate at the time<br/>
&gt; to get out pennies and paper and pencil and do some percentage math?<br/>
&gt; Like, sit down with her and do some, striking while the iron was hot?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would you want to?  If she&#39;s got the concept in her head, and she&#39;s able<br/>
to apply it in her life, why would she need to do with with pencil, paper,<br/>
and pennies?  If she wants it, sometime, she can ask you or someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Rather it sounds like sitting her down might turn her off on percentages,<br/>
and perhaps even eventually turn her off on you in a way.  I mean, if every<br/>
cool thing that she learns turns out to have a schooly application that Mom<br/>
wants to show you, maybe she&#39;d simply stop sharing with Mom.  I don&#39;t mean<br/>
that you&#39;d be dull or mean about it, just that I think you can trust the<br/>
learning all by itself; it likely doesn&#39;t need to be reinforced on paper.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just note in your mind or your homeschooling records, if you keep them,<br/>
that today was cool!<br/>
