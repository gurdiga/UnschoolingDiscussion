<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141946317">I am battling complications from pneumonia.  If that wasn&#39;t enough, my <br/>
husband had to go out of town today for his mother&#39;s funeral.  Unfortunately, <br/>
help is not that easy to come by, so I need some ideas on easy ways to keep <br/>
my three-year-old amused.  I&#39;m drawing an absolute blank.  Kayla&#39;s ideas for <br/>
things to do are pretty dramatic, like sitting in a dirty rabbit cage and <br/>
squeezing the bunny, and flushing interesting items down the toilet.  She had <br/>
accomplished both those things by 7:00 this morning!  (This kid has <br/>
&quot;unschooler&quot; written all over her!)  Does anyone have any brilliant ideas on <br/>
how I can keep this energetic child happy while I recover?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138018836">How about: a bath with shaving cream and a popsicle stick razor, or a<br/>
big container of dried beans and a few measuring cups, or filling up the<br/>
sink and playing with boats/dolls/straws/bubbles/cups, or painting her<br/>
toenails, or drawing with washable marker all over her body, or making a<br/>
book, or cutting out snowflakes or paper dolls, or making a present for<br/>
daddy?  That&#39;s all I can remember of long lasting fun for three year<br/>
olds at the moment :0).  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-148878582">Holly said &quot;watch TV&quot; and I said someone already recommended that.<br/>
<br/>
She says &quot;Duplo&#39;s fun, if they have any of those.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have anything like dolls and dollhouses, Fisher Price sets, things she <br/>
could act out scenarios with &quot;people&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
How about painting herself, and then washing herself off (bath or shower) and <br/>
then painting herself again?  Or maybe the mom can paint on her, in the bed.  <br/>
If it&#39;s washable paint, so what if it gets on the sheets?    <br/>
<br/>
Paint a necklace, watch, rings, paint her fingernails and toe-nails.  With <br/>
water colors, or washable markers, or body paint or make-up.  Paint shoes and <br/>
stripey socks on her.  Paint sailor tatoos!  And the bath to get that all off <br/>
will probably last an hour. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418365490">The only thing worse than being sick and by yourself with a<br/>
healthy 3 is being sick and by yourself with a sick 3.  TV really<br/>
is made for the situation, but there are a couple of other things<br/>
that might help.  If you can drag your self outside a bout of<br/>
running around outside makes less vigorous stuff look better to a<br/>
3. 30 minutes of misery (assuming it makes your eyes hurt and<br/>
your bones shiver, which outside does to me when I am sick) for<br/>
you may yield a couple of hours of happy quietness.<br/>
<br/>
2 activities that tend to go on a loooong time, with little<br/>
supervision, are water and rice (separately).  For water -   Put<br/>
a large plastic storage box on some towels on a non carpeted<br/>
floor or in a pinch in the bath tub or floor of the shower.  Put<br/>
6 inches of water in it, then get out plastic measuring cups,<br/>
ladles, funnels, bowls, cups, spray pumps - you name it.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t have something like a big plastic box, it should work with<br/>
a deep roasting pan, but make a mental note to invest $5 in a<br/>
Sterlite box soon - it is a great all round toy.<br/>
<br/>
For rice - put a cup or so of uncooked rice (or lentils or peas -<br/>
something small enough not to block an ear or nostril, since you<br/>
aren&#39;t feeling like watching every minute) on a large tray or box<br/>
bottom - give the kids the same kind of pouring/scooping tots,<br/>
plus some toilet paper and paper towel rolls and a few things<br/>
with easily attached/removed lids. Depending on the kid and the<br/>
tools available tongs and chopsticks are fun with this too, but<br/>
may not be ideal if you have a kid who tends to run with a<br/>
chopstick in her mouth if your not watching.<br/>
<br/>
One of the better things about these when you are sick is you<br/>
don&#39;t HAVE to clean them up for a long time - leaving them there<br/>
while you nap or until hubby gets home is unlikely to cause<br/>
disaster.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Would she stand for filling the sink with water (preferably colored) and <br/>
putting things in that?  Pieces of bread, uncooked rice, dry washcloths, <br/>
sticks flour in bowls.  These have been fun for us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s warm here today, the sandbox is inviting.  But we just spend three hours <br/>
at the park.<br/>
<br/>
Pattern blocks are usually good for an hour or so.  Or jumping on couch <br/>
cushions on the floor.  Making towers out of things that are not normally <br/>
towers - cds, empty (or full) yogurt cups, stuffed animals, shoes (we had a <br/>
house of shoes once).  Or tying all teh shoes in the house together!  That&#39;s <br/>
great fun for some.<br/>
<br/>
Washing doll&#39;s hair.  A dirt pile. A long movie.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it works, or something works for you!  Sorry both for the pneumonia and <br/>
for your loss.<br/>

paint that will wash right off of the shower walls.  My boys will <br/>
stay in the shower for over an hour when I give them paintbrushes <br/>
and that &quot;paint&quot;.  Sick mommy could get a magazine and a pillow and <br/>
enjoy sitting in the steamy bathroom. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595530802">Thanks to everyone for some great ideas on how to keep Kayla busy while I <br/>
recover from pneumonia.  I am inspired, and I know I will make it through <br/>
this tough time.  Your help is deeply appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Carol, particularly interested in the idea of having Kayla paint herself in <br/>
the tub.  It might give my husband and me something to do when he gets back <br/>
in town, provided I&#39;m feeling well...<br/>
