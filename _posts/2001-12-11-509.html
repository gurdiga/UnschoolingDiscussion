<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The author of these &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; is John Rosemond,<br/>
&gt; a family psychologist who writes a weekly column which<br/>
&gt; is published in over 200 newspapers. <br/>
&gt; He gives terrific, common sense advice to parents. His<br/>
&gt; web site is www.rosemond.com.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reads more like, &#39;How to crush your children&#39;s spirit<br/>
&gt; completely&#39;.  I feel like crying for the children of<br/>
&gt; the parents who read this guy and think that &quot;He gives<br/>
&gt; terrific, common sense advice&quot;. IMO he seems like a<br/>
&gt; very frustrated (he obviously didn&#39;t get his &#39;needs&#39;<br/>
&gt; met and needs to make sure that others don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; theirs met either) and controlling person. The fact<br/>
&gt; that this guy is in over 200 newspapers is just plain<br/>
&gt; scary to me.<br/>

are...estranged), and that he&#39;s a pretty inactive father.<br/>
