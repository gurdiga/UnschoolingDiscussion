<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t do all the badge work in the meetings. And most girls do not earn <br/>
all the badges. There are a lot of them! If there are some you just don&#39;t <br/>
want your daughter doing, you could just mention it to the scout leader. <br/>
They could either not do that badge in group,  or your daughter could skip <br/>
that particular meeting.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I had to keep my mouth shut in the conversation because my views <br/>

want to see dd in a conversation about dating and not give my input.  <br/>
Stuff like that made me almost not do Girl Scouts.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But couldn&#39;t she just say, then, that she sees dating examples all around and <br/>
she would not do it like ANY of those?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d think they&#39;re wanting to promote thoughtful awareness and safety, and if <br/>
she already has a more conservative point of view and belief system, that&#39;s <br/>
good.  <br/>
<br/>
I worry about the families that keep their kids TOO  much away from the <br/>
culture because they could be more unprepared than they need to be.  My <br/>
friend who was abused by a priest had never had his parents say ONE WORD <br/>
about sexuality or private parts or anything about the realities of being a <br/>
little boy.  All they had told him was it was  not to be discussed (when it <br/>
got to close to &quot;it&quot;) and that he should do everything adults told him to <br/>
without talking back.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is a recipe for disaster.  By the time he was old enough to date he was <br/>
one messed up puppy.<br/>
<br/>
So courtship is a possibility if the children are save in the meantime.  I <br/>
wish I knew not one single story of sexual abuse by clergymen, but I do.  <br/>
(I&#39;d rather know them than not.  What I really wish is that there WERE no <br/>
such stories.)  And as far as I know there are more among protestants than <br/>
Catholics beause there are more protestants than Catholics.   An Episcopal <br/>
youth minister did another male friend of mine.  And tales of teenaged girls <br/>
and young women are not isolated.<br/>
<br/>
For some of the girls the discussions in girl scout meetings might be the <br/>
first chance they&#39;ve had to discuss those issues with people who have any <br/>
idea of the dangers (and who are willing to discuss it, I mean).  For some of <br/>
them, unfortunately, sixth grade is already too late.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember Carly had no interest in learning about &quot;becoming a woman&quot; with <br/>
anyone but me. She didn&#39;t want to deal with all the silliness that often <br/>
occurs in group discussions. She was in Girl Scouts when she still attended <br/>
ps. I should have realized that unschooling was her best option with her <br/>
frequent response to what badges she worked on. Carly had no problem saying <br/>
that she didn&#39;t want to work on a certain badge, and she wouldn&#39;t. The leader <br/>
allowed her to &quot;do her own thing&quot;. It&#39;s a shame that it took me longer to <br/>
figure out that that&#39;s how our whole life should go. I&#39;m so glad that I did. <br/>
Just more proof that we should trust our children. <br/>

little church. (The church changed denominations, I didn&#39;t change churches.) <br/>
I think the discussion of what to do, how you&#39;d date, etc. are important.<br/>
