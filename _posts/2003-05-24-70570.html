Just a note to everyone.  While selling jewelry at an antique show recently I had a woman come and buy several charms from me.  Her daughter leaves them under her pillow instead of money.  I thought that was such a neat idea.  Much more memorable then cash.  I would have liked to have done that instead of money or books which is what we do now.<br/>

My son will be thirteen in a couple of weeks, and I so wanted to do<br/>
something special for him.  What kind of blessingway ceremony? It sounds<br/>
like a wonderful idea, but I have absolutely no idea about what to do.<br/>
He&#39;s a very kind and thoughtful person, and I know it would mean so much to<br/>
him.  He helps teach the beginning students in martial arts class,<br/>
loves gaming and video games (thanks to you, Sandra.  From your sharing I<br/>
know that it&#39;s okay to be so very interested in the games. I could go on and<br/>
on about the benefits to reading skills from playing those games!),  and I<br/>
am rambling on a bit...<br/>
Anyway, any ideas? Anyone?<br/>

I&#39;m going to have to make a list of some of the digital artists that <br/>

I don&#39;t suppose you sell, or know where I could get, a charm with some kind<br/>
of mother/baby thing on it (NOT a baby bottle or pacifier, or baby buggy,<br/>
which seems to be all I can find). I would like to find something that looks<br/>
like the LLL logo (mom cradling baby). If you have anything similar or know<br/>
where I could find it, please let me know! As it stands now, I&#39;m going to<br/>
have to look for someone to custom engrave one if I can&#39;t find one, if it&#39;s<br/>
not horrifyingly expensive to do so.<br/>

with my daughter. They each brought gifts to the ceremony that had a<br/>
personal connection to me. My sister wrote a poem, some brought readings or<br/>
poems that they thought were fitting, some brought stones or feathers or<br/>
things from our past. I sat in the center of the circle and they each went<br/>
around and discussed what they had brought and why. It was very, very<br/>
moving. It was like deepening the connection to each of these friends<br/>
through remembrance and by seeing aspects of myself through their eyes. It<br/>
was very honoring. Also very hard for me to do. There&#39;s very few times in<br/>
our society when we sit still and listen to someone say nice things about us<br/>
without socially trying to brush them aside. All your defenses are down in<br/>
such a ceremony, and you accept each gift for what it is, from the heart<br/>
that it is given. There were many, many tears.<br/>
My friends also brought food, and we had planned to do henna tattoos around<br/>
each of our wrists but we ran out of time. Still, I think that would be a<br/>
nice addition. In some Blessingways the friends wash the person&#39;s feet,<br/>
braid flowers into their hair, etc. as well.<br/>
I think you can make the ceremony what you want to. I think the big<br/>
difference from the types of things we do in our culture (baby showers,<br/>
birthday parties) is that the Blessingway focuses on emotional ties and not<br/>
on physical gifts. It puts the relationships and the person being honored<br/>
into the center, it does not attempt to deflect attention from what is<br/>
important by less meaningful rituals (the playing of birthday or baby shower<br/>
games, the opening of presents all serve to put a comfortable barrier<br/>
between the emotions about the event and the people involved).<br/>
If a child was open to something like this, I think it could be a very<br/>
powerful and meaningful way to honor the transition of puberty.<br/>
