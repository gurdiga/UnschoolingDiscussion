&lt;&lt; I think you have touched on some of the core issues Laura.  A simpler, <br/>
relaxed,<br/>
 full of interests life is what it is about.  The interests however need to <br/>
spring<br/>
 from the heart and not just be imposed interests from someone else.  I am<br/>
 inspired by your account.  I know I have let many past interests atrophy to a<br/>
 certain extent mostly because of having to do the money earning thing for my<br/>
 family.  Salaried employment occupies so much time. It has its own interests <br/>
so I<br/>
 am not horrendously bored by my work but I want more time. Reflective time.<br/>
 <br/>
 My daughters really love to go for neighborhood walks.  They would always go<br/>
 longer and farther than me because I am usually tired.  I never want to do <br/>
it as<br/>
 much as they do and yet the walks we have had are usually very pleasant.<br/>
 <br/>
 There is a lesson here for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I was also thinking of the things you and John were discussing earlier <br/>
this week, exposing kids to many things versus letting them find their own <br/>
way. I am a proponent of both. I would not describe what I do as flooding my <br/>
kids and I would guess that John did not intend what he said to mean throwing <br/>
a thousand and one things at them at once. <br/>
    What I have always tried to do with all my boys is to show them that the <br/>
world is a very big place and there are all kinds of options out there. This <br/>
came from my having been raised with a very limited view of possibilities. It <br/>
has taken me many years to even begin to discover my abilities. Granted we <br/>
are all capable of much more than we&#39;ll ever use but it sure is nice to have <br/>
a choice.<br/>
    We travel as much as time and finances permit. We have been all over Ohio <br/>
since this is where we live. I take them to libraries,plays,musicals,craft <br/>
shows, pioneer reenactments, etc. I started reading out loud to them again <br/>
last year after having let it go for a couple of years. I read all kinds of <br/>
books and if after a bit they tell me they can&#39;t get interested I quit and <br/>
find another. <br/>
    In the eclectic collection of books I hope to read are books from every <br/>
era and country. ( well, probably not every, you get the point) What we will <br/>
all learn by reading these will broaden our outlook considerably.<br/>
    The exciting part of all of this is the realization that this wonderful <br/>
journey can be shared. I never dreamed how much I would benefit by having my <br/>
kids home. I knew I liked them and would like to be with them more before <br/>
they grew up. <br/>
    I have rediscovered what a big exciting world is out there. Not the one <br/>
on TV, the one that lives in our dreams and imagination and doesn&#39;t cost us a <br/>
fortune to use.<br/>
    I remember how much I loved to stay at my grandmother&#39;s house as a child. <br/>
My grandparents did not live on a lovely farm somewhere either. They lived <br/>
right in the North end of Columbus in an area I wouldn&#39;t walk anywhere in <br/>
today. However my grandmother possessed an incredible imagination. She would <br/>
let me make cookies and put in every food color to see what would happen. <br/>
Ugh! She let me write on her organ keys so I could learn to play and she <br/>
listened to me bang away in a four room house for hours. She taught me to <br/>
crochet and embroider. She took me down town on a bus and let me wear bright <br/>
red lipstick. Yet she never drove a car or wrote a check. <br/>
She never had any fancy clothes, nothing in her house matched but the <br/>
memories She gave me are as vivid today as they were 30 yrs. ago. <br/>
    This is what I hope to impart to my children and grandchildren. I want <br/>
their memories of me to be as sweet as mine of my grandmother are. Funny I <br/>
can&#39;t remember anything my grandma bought me, though she did buy for me at <br/>
times. What stands out is all that she gave of herself. Now I have to go cry. <br/>
Bye.<br/>
    Sorry this was so long, I got carried away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32995039">I cried too... and as for Ohio ...when I was 19 I hitchhiked by Zanesville on a<br/>
July evening and saw thousands of fireflies which I had never seen before.  It was<br/>
beautiful.<br/>
