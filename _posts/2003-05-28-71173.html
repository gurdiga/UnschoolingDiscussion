<div id="ygrps-yiv-717913766">Snakes and Ladders.  On a beach towel.  With giant pieces and waterproof <br/>
floating dice.  VERY cool.  I wish they&#39;d had backgammon!! They only otherwise had <br/>
checkers and tic tac toe.<br/>
<br/>
A backgammon board would make a beautiful towel (or wall hanging) but the <br/>
Snakes and Ladders board is pretty nice!!!<br/>
