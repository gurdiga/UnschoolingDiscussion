<div id="ygrps-yiv-717844401">Not that this probably applies to anyone else on this list :) but drinking <br/>
disrupts your sleep cycle. Even just a couple of drinks in the evening can <br/>
cause you to be wide awake at 3 or 4 a.m., and up for an hour. There are <br/>
many evenings I weigh which I want more: another glass of wine or an <br/>
uninterrupted night&#39;s sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Also, pregnant women wake up a lot. Maybe this is nature&#39;s method of <br/>
preparing us for the round-the-clock care of a newborn. The way to avoid <br/>
that, I guess, is obvious! (Does that take us back to not having wine before <br/>
bed? Hmmm....)<br/>
