Lose the Lipfinity...sure it stays on all day, but it&#39;s hell on your lips and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t look that great anyway.  And if you buy a high quality foundation <br/>
it will stay put and look great all day! Honest. But they run 28 dollars and <br/>
up for one bottle (yes, that&#39;s what I sell). It actually matches your skin <br/>
perfectly too, none of this ugly line stuff.<br/>
If you want a lipstick that is kind to your lips you will have to reapply it <br/>
occasionally. If you want stay put forever, it will dry your lips out. The <br/>
good lipsticks are 15 dollars and up (most of ours are around 18..yikes!!). <br/>
So it&#39;s not in the average SAHM&#39;s budget....but hey, I just figured out the <br/>
solution--go to work for them!! hehe<br/>
<br/>
On the handwriting issue...<br/>
I was actually nervous about writing to Sandra for some Thinking sticks <br/>
because I just KNEW she would think I was a bit Neurotic (ok, I&#39;ll just admit <br/>
to it now) because my handwriting is absolutely atrocious. Scrawls in every <br/>
direction, no sense whatsoever. I figured she&#39;d have a hay day analyzing it!! <br/>
Gulp.<br/>
ok, so the secret is out.....<br/>
I&#39;d hate to hear what anyone would analyze from my handwritten notes.<br/>

Buttercup movie or the Wesley movie.  It is very popular among many<br/>
unschoolers I know.  We had an unschooling family over in Nov. so their<br/>
children could see it - they don&#39;t have a TV and it doesn&#39;t play at<br/>
many movie theatres any more!<br/>

That&#39;s terrible!  I&#39;m really sorry you felt afraid of me seeing writing.  I <br/>
LOVE handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
As long as you weren&#39;t an obvious leftie dotting i&#39;s with hearts, I&#39;d be <br/>
happy.<br/>
<br/>
(I just know there&#39;s a heart-dotting leftie here.  And I&#39;m joking anyway.)<br/>
