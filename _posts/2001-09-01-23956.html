If you are shouting over the noise of the lawn mower for everyone to come<br/>
quick, the cat is having kittens, that&#39;s one kind of shouting. If you are<br/>
shouting to a distant child that his friend George is at the door, that&#39;s<br/>
another kind of shouting.<br/>
<br/>
If you are standing in a child&#39;s face shouting at him because he broke a<br/>
glass, spilled the milk, woke you up, colored on the walls, then you need<br/>
help and I don&#39;t want my kids around you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987396489">I was thinking about how people who were outside our house might perceive<br/>
the shouting.  Guess I wasn&#39;t very clear.  You can hear the shouting outside<br/>
but not much of the background noise.  We had just been having a<br/>
conversation about this.  Hubby came home and wanted to know why I was<br/>
&quot;screaming at the kids.&quot;  Both the kids and I looked at him like he was<br/>
crazy with a huh expression on our faces.  Then it dawned on us that inside<br/>
the house we had the stereo going, youngest was playing the piano and the<br/>
boys were upstairs and I had &quot;screamed&quot; to let them know that lunch was<br/>
ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801485064">First hubby&#39;s father was Italian, born in Italy, mother and father from<br/>
Italy and everything you see in the movies was true of this family and all<br/>
the other big Italian families I ever met--loud, shouting at each other,<br/>
roaring fights, slamming doors, screaming, etc.  BUT, there is no doubt<br/>
whatsoever that everyone loves everyone else AND absolutely no one (and I<br/>
asked because it is a real culture shock when you first land in one of those<br/>
large gatherings!) is offended or wounded by it--&quot;Oh that&#39;s just cousin<br/>
[whomever], that&#39;s just the way he is&quot; all said with a look of fond<br/>
acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
One should walk in the shoes perhaps first of a shouting/hollering/screaming<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, the nastier piece of work I ever met and the poster child for<br/>
sterilization never lifted her voice once!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with this point. I had an english grandmother that could say<br/>
things like &quot;that&#39;s lovely, dear&quot; in a tone that made you feel like it was<br/>
the worst thing you could have ever done. She was also adept at intense<br/>
guilt trips. She hardly ever raised her voice or shouted. I often felt like<br/>
I was an immense failure to her and often would avoid her company.<br/>

one of those just because type answers. <br/>

absolute worst, especially if the person called the<br/>
