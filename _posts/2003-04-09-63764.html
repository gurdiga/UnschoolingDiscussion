<div id="ygrps-yiv-609782865"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My eight year old daughter has just discovered Grease. She LOVED it. I <br/>
&gt;&gt;want to see if she&#39;d like other movies along the same lines and also <br/>
&gt;&gt;thought I&#39;d see what I could find about that *era* that we could look at. <br/>
&gt;&gt;Maybe we could sew a poodle skirt  :) Any suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about some of the old Elvis musicals or Bye Bye Birdie?<br/>
