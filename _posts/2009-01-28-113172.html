<br/>
I&#39;m going to keep this chat room open for a few hours and if anyone  <br/>
wants to come and join me to discuss food or the possibility of  <br/>
scheduling more live chats is welcome.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s 3:40 Wednesday afternoon in New Mexico. Your clockage may vary. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;ll be there for a few hours, and the room will continue to exist for  <br/>
24 hours after the last person leaves, as I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is something worth scheduling once a week or more, if there  <br/>
are others willing to host some chats maybe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377046893">That one went okay.   Two more are planned--midday Thursday (midday in  <br/>
north America) and Friday night (ditto).<br/>
<br/>
Details and a world time translator are here:<br/>

<br/>
Thursdays will be on young children (at the request of a mom in  <br/>
Montreal).  1:00 her time; 11:00 a.m my time; check your own time by  <br/>
going to the link above, and at that hour go back to that link to get  <br/>
into the chatroom.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night, another one, on how it is people learn about  <br/>
unschooling, and how they could do it better, maybe.<br/>
