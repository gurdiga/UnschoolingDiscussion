<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139832218">I&#39;m left-handed for writing, holding a fork or spoon, and for brushing <br/>
my teeth.  Everything else I do right-handed....throwing a ball, using <br/>
scissors, eating with chopsticks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The spiral-bound notebooks are a real pain in the, well, arm and wrist. <br/>
  LOL  The other thing that I still have a problem with is getting ink <br/>
or marker all over the outer edge of my hand as it drags across the <br/>
paper while writing from left to right.  I&#39;m constantly smudging my <br/>
stuff.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
If I want to use a pad of paper I prefer to use the kind that don&#39;t <br/>
have a spiral, but rather an edge like a book of checks where the paper <br/>
is just perforated.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;how&quot; your DS is holding his pen/pencil.... I wouldn&#39;t worry <br/>
about it.  I have a really odd way of holding my pen(cil) and it works <br/>
great for me.  My parents, grandparents, and teachers all try to teach <br/>
me a &quot;better&quot; way, but it wasn&#39;t better for ME.  Don&#39;t sweat it.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me.... one more &quot;retraining&quot; phase that my parents tried <br/>
to do with me when I was a toddler and learning to eat with <br/>
utensils.... they bought me a spoon that was bent toward the left so <br/>
that if I used it with my right hand the &quot;bowl&quot; of the spoon would go <br/>
toward my mouth.  But if I used it with my left hand the spoon would <br/>
point away from my mouth.  What kind of twisted trick is that to pull <br/>
on a little kid???  I still didn&#39;t use the darn thing with my right <br/>
hand.  I just curved my little left arm all the way around and used it <br/>
that way.  I still am annoyed that they did that to me instead of just <br/>
letting me be.<br/>

My husband is left handed and went to public school.  He did a lot of<br/>
writing practice, penmanship, etc.  <br/>
He doesn&#39;t like to write.  Not only is the binding of notebooks a problem<br/>
but we write from left to right and a left handed person&#39;s hand trails<br/>
through the ink and can smear it.   I think that&#39;s the reason a lot of<br/>
left handed people bend their wrist and write with their hand curving<br/>
over the top of the line - it tends to keep their hand off the paper and<br/>
out of the ink. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe your son could write from right to left?  <br/>
<br/>
So, if it comforts you, writing practice didn&#39;t make my husband a better<br/>
writer.  He did write long love letters to me before we were married so<br/>
he can write when he wants to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not left handed but my bird list is on a small, postcard size, sketch<br/>
pad and I use it with the spiral binding on the top instead of the left. <br/>
It&#39;s much easier to write in that way because your hand can support more<br/>
of the book as you write while standing or crouching.  There&#39;s room for<br/>
quick sketches too.  It fits in most vest or coat pockets and the easy<br/>
pouches of front or backpacks. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s bird list is different.  We printed the Montana species and had<br/>
it laminated.  It&#39;s about three inches wide by eight inches long , four<br/>
or five pages with a hole punched in the top for a ring and a clip.  He<br/>
marks off birds he sees and the date/location with a permanent marker and<br/>
the list can be clipped onto his backpack or zipper or belt loop.   He<br/>
likes it because it requires a minimum of writing. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I always enjoy your posts Julie. <br/>

The university bookstore has them  here, but I bet you can get it delivered <br/>
to your door form some online office supply place.<br/>

Marty does some things one way and some another.  He writes and draws <br/>
lefthanded.  He eats left handed.  When he went to play hockey, we figured &quot;lefty&quot; <br/>
but no, he&#39;s a righty playing hockey.  Lefty sword fighting.  ??  Maybe it&#39;s an <br/>
eye-dominance thing.<br/>
<br/>
Keith says that at work he uses a legal pad binder that opens the regular way <br/>
(like a folder) but he can fold that all the way under while he&#39;s writing.<br/>
