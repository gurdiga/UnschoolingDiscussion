<div id="ygrps-yiv-841993766">My little eighty-one year old mama is stopping by for coffee on her way<br/>
to a painting session with her friends.  She took up painting last year<br/>
and is having a wonderful time.  <br/>
<br/>
My little eleven year old boy is happily &quot;drawing&quot; artsy thank you&#39;s for<br/>
gifts he got for his birthday.  I didn&#39;t remind him to, he just got his<br/>
drawing stuff out and everyone is getting an original work of art with a<br/>
brief note.<br/>
<br/>
My dog is asleep in my rocking chair.<br/>
<br/>
That cat&#39;s are sunbathing in the window. <br/>
<br/>
The garden is calling my name, softly.&lt;g&gt;  Wait, it&#39;s getting louder!<br/>
<br/>
There are Robins building a nest on the ladder hanging along the side of<br/>
my garage.   Mrs. Robin has a line of mud across her breast where she&#39;s<br/>
been pressing and molding her nest. <br/>
<br/>
House Sparrows have moved into the ends of the clothes line poles.   <br/>
<br/>
A squirrel is dangling by his toes stealing sunflower seeds from the bird<br/>
feeder.<br/>

What a wonderful portrait of peace you have shared.  Thank you for the breath <br/>
of tranquility you floated into my afternoon!<br/>
