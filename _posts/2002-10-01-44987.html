<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204120903">You posted the little girl has quite a long list of people she doesn&#39;t like.<br/>
Does she really not like them or do they simply aggravate her at times?<br/>
<br/>
I currently have 2 three yo&#39;s living with me.  We hear lots of &quot;I hate<br/>
you&#39;s&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t like you&#39;s&quot; here.  One of the kids says it because it<br/>
gets a reaction and she truly enjoys reactions.  The other children&#39;s main<br/>
response to her is &quot;So?&quot;.  The other 3yo says it because he is mad and when<br/>
he is mad it clouds over his entire being, but only for a few minutes.  The<br/>
other children&#39;s main response to him is &quot;Why?&quot; which leads to talking and<br/>
usually laughing.<br/>
<br/>
I would want to find out exactly what is motivating this little girl.  But<br/>
if she really didn&#39;t like the little boy, I wouldn&#39;t make her play with him<br/>
but I would talk with her about feelings.<br/>

her when she comes to visit. They play together, have a great time and then <br/>
the little girl will just turn around and tell her that she doesn&#39;t like her <br/>
and she should leave, for no reason that&#39;s apparent. It&#39;s starting to sound a <br/>
little like a 3yo phase.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849050241">Thanks to everyone who answered.  To address some of your<br/>
questions/comments:<br/>
<br/>
The little boy in question is not very verbal.  I don&#39;t think he could be<br/>
coached to discuss it with her at this time.<br/>
<br/>
My sister hasn&#39;t told her daughter that it&#39;s not an option for her not to<br/>
play with him.  It&#39;s just difficult because he&#39;s pretty much a member of our<br/>
extended family, and he is going to be at the same place she is pretty<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard my sister say anything negative about S.  He&#39;s really a<br/>
very sweet, gentle little boy.<br/>
<br/>
My niece won&#39;t give a reason that she doesn&#39;t like him.  Like I said, she<br/>
has quite a few people that she just doesn&#39;t like, and has never given a<br/>
reason for.  My husband is one of them.<br/>
<br/>
My sister doesn&#39;t make her share her toys, and gives her lots of attention<br/>
when they are with him.<br/>
<br/>
They are never forced to play together, just, by circumstance, to be in the<br/>
same house or at the same activity.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t actually seem to be aggravated by anything these people, or this<br/>
little boy, are doing.  I&#39;m sure it makes sense to her, but from the outside<br/>
it&#39;s very irrational behavior.  For example, we were all walking to a fair<br/>
down the street from my house last week.  D told her mother that she wanted<br/>
to ride in S&#39;s stroller, which had a second seat available.  My sister<br/>
brought her up to the stroller, and D had a fit because she wanted S to get<br/>
out so she wouldn&#39;t have to be near him.<br/>
<br/>
Any more thoughts?  ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
But they&#39;ll only be three for a little while.  Less than a year. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And if she can play when she&#39;s read to and not before it will be better for <br/>
her relationship with him AND her relationship with her mother if her mother <br/>
will actually listen to her.<br/>
<br/>
I think if the girl is saying she doesn&#39;t like him and doesn&#39;t want him <br/>
there, then it becomes your sister&#39;s fault that the boy&#39;s feelings are being <br/>
hurt, not just the girl&#39;s.  It shouldn&#39;t hurt, if he IS extended family, to <br/>
wait another six months or a year and try again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371980560">To a three year old &quot;I don&#39;t like&quot; can mean many different things. (Please remember, three year old speaking)<br/>
<br/>
It can mean, &quot;I don&#39;t like you.&quot;<br/>
 It can mean &quot;You look/smell/sound funny (to me)&quot; (every person has their own smell and sound, and every person has a different sense of what is nice to them...doesn&#39;t mean there is something untoward about the child.)<br/>
It can mean &quot;I still remember when you took my toy&quot;<br/>
It can mean, &quot;whenever you are around, my mommy doesn&#39;t pay enough attention to me.&quot;<br/>
or, &quot;whenever you are around everyone pays attention to you and not me&quot; (even if they are getting equal attention or she is getting more attention)<br/>
It can mean &quot;I really like the reaction I get when I say these words.&quot; (Wow!  I really get attention from saying that to him! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me: I would :minimize contact between the two kids until the little one is old enough to 1) have forgotten whatever it is she was feeling and made her say the words in the first place<br/>
2) till she is old enough to know that you don&#39;t always like someone but most of the time you shouldn&#39;t say anything.<br/>
<br/>
When contact must occurr, I would make sure to ignore the child&#39;s words if possible, just pretend she didn&#39;t say them.   If not possible, then  remove her from the room, and then go back and comfort the boy.  If she is doing it to get attention that is most likely to curb the behaviour.<br/>

understood a whole lot more than he was able to verbalize.  And it was in <br/>
that stage that he just didn&#39;t like playing with his 15 month older cousin <br/>
much.  The cousin had a lot of loud toys, which may have had something to do <br/>
with it.  But we just ended up spacing out the visits more and it passed.<br/>
<br/>
Not really advice for you and your sister, though.  It&#39;s a tough spot, <br/>
guessing at what he&#39;s like to say if he could.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979849441">BTW,<br/>
<br/>
One more reason the child may be saying she doesn&#39;t like this young boy.  If she is very verbal and he is not she may really think he is not talking to be mean to her.  It is very difficult at that age to understand that people learn to talk at different rates and the boy is not deliberately not answering her, or talking it what she may consider, baby talk.  <br/>
<br/>
She also may not really understand what she is saying.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes...this happened with the little boy who moved in behind us. He 3 I think, <br/>
but he really had a thing with my youngest who was around 1.5 at the time.<br/>
Anytime Kyle was outside, Matthew (the neighbor) would turn around and go<br/>
inside. He told his mom that he did not like Kyle but would not give a reason. He <br/>
finally said that Kyle would not talk with him and just stared at him. Kyle actually<br/>
did not talk much until well after he was 2. <br/>
<br/>
Matthew&#39;s mom just kept talking with him and I had lots of talks with Jason about<br/>
why Matthew did not want to come over and play. (Kyle actually did not seem to <br/>
notice (Matthew was never mean about it, he just turned around and went inside!).<br/>
We gave Matthew some space (I kept Kyle busy if Jason and Matthew were playing or<br/>
Jason went to their house) and now a year later there is no problem.<br/>
<br/>
Three year olds are an interesting bunch. :o) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286314776">Excuse me for jumping in here, as I haven&#39;t actually read all the relevant<br/>
posts that go to this subject, but if I understand correctly, the contact<br/>
between the two children is occuring because the parents of the children are<br/>
friends also and this brings the children together?  If this is the case<br/>
then asking for a seperation of any time, be it a few days or six months<br/>
seems like quite a sacrifice to make just because a three year old is<br/>
throwing a fit about a younger child.  My seven year old would at times get<br/>
quite fed up with my friend&#39;s twin four year olds and say similar things.  I<br/>
told him to live with it as their Mother is my friend and they are my<br/>
friends and he can play in a different room if he doesn&#39;t want to be around<br/>
them when they are visiting.<br/>
<br/>
Of course if the adults are merely putting up with each other in order for<br/>
the children to have time together then for sure, take some time apart.<br/>
<br/>
If I had gone along with all my children&#39;s dislikes of others we would have<br/>
very few friends today, including many of their very best friends.<br/>
<br/>
As homeschoolers we don&#39;t have an enormous pool of friends to choose from<br/>
and sometimes we have to live with what we have.  I have seen siblings treat<br/>
each other in a fashion similar to how you have described the three year<br/>
olds&#39; behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
Also, asking a child to give a reason for not liking someone can be like<br/>
asking for the moon.  Analyzing one&#39;s feelings is something that even adults<br/>
find hard.  Sometimes asking what the other child did that they don&#39;t like<br/>
can yield some interesting responses, as concrete actions are easier to put<br/>
into words.  Don&#39;t make the question a demand either, but rather float the<br/>
question in the air during a time when the child is able to communicate.<br/>
Just verbalizing thoughts about feelings can help children digest those<br/>
feelings.  And explain your feelings about the matter.  Don&#39;t expect much<br/>
from any of this though as it will probably pass in a few weeks or so and<br/>
you will wonder what all the fuss was about.<br/>

How much damage should be done to the psyche of one child and the soul of <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Live with it&quot;?<br/>
If a child goes to another house and the resident child plays in a different <br/>
room, that&#39;s hurtful too.    When parents put friendships above their own <br/>
children&#39;s comfort, they&#39;re sending the child a big message.  What of <br/>
bringing an older child to facilitate play among those children?  What of the <br/>
moms visiting when the kids are with dads?  There are options, and any <br/>
friendship that can&#39;t survive six months of phone instead of in-person visits <br/>
wasn&#39;t a friendship worth hurting a child over.<br/>

&lt;&lt;As homeschoolers we don&#39;t have an enormous pool of friends to choose from<br/>

It&#39;s one thing to be insulted by a sibling who is stuck with your for life.  <br/>

If it&#39;s going to pass in a few weeks, better for that to be a time when the <br/>
kids are maturing separately.  Some hurts do last a long, long time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All the fuss&quot; was about the feelings of humans.  Even three year olds are <br/>
real people.  Their feelings are as big as ours are.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Exactly, Sandra.  I realize this conversation has taken kind of a<br/>
hypothetical turn, but to bring it back to reality for a minute, my sister<br/>
is very respectful of her daughter.  Under no circumstances would she tell<br/>
her to &quot;live with it&quot;, nor would she want the other mother to tell her son<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether or not they could take a break from seeing each other, I don&#39;t<br/>
know.  The three of us, and our families, spend a lot of time together.  I&#39;m<br/>
actually thinking that maybe they could look at this as almost a sibling<br/>
thing.  We haven&#39;t looked at it that way before, which is odd because we<br/>
always think of the cousins (my kids and my sisters&#39;) in a sibling sort of<br/>
way when they&#39;re having a problem, because they spend even MORE time<br/>
together.  I knew I&#39;d get something to think about if I posted here :0).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094748827">&lt;&lt;Any more thoughts?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thinking back over to similar situations that have occurred (kids saying<br/>
judgmental or hurtful things to other kids) I think I would downplay the<br/>
entire thing.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  Michelle (3) tells Danny (3) that she doesn&#39;t like him and he<br/>
looks hurt.  I might say something like &quot;That&#39;s ok but I DO.&quot; and grab the<br/>
little guy up in a bear hug or a tickle, give Michelle a wink and a caress<br/>
on the head.  Letting Michelle know that she is able to have her feelings<br/>
and letting Danny know that he is likable and leaving him with a smile.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34291004">This sounds like a case of *I don&#39;t want to play with you* more than *I hate you*<br/>
Actually it is easy to see how this develops.  A friend&#39;s coming over with whom a child normally likes to play with, but doesn&#39;t today. Yet, maybe mom/dad can&#39;t call it off...they are 1/2hr away, you need a sitter, she needs a sitter, or you simply don&#39;t want to greet them at the door with sorry, she doesn&#39;t want to play.  It is a bit embarrassing.  So mom or dad goes *Oh, you like soandso.* Right?  Something along those lines.  So liking a person must mean you play want to play with them and if you don&#39;t want to play with them you have to not like them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is my theory.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

  I have a friend whose 3yo niece tells her constantly that she doesn&#39;t like <br/>
  her when she comes to visit. They play together, have a great time and then <br/>
  the little girl will just turn around and tell her that she doesn&#39;t like her <br/>
  and she should leave, for no reason that&#39;s apparent. It&#39;s starting to sound a <br/>
  little like a 3yo phase.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830819952"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How much damage should be done to the psyche of one child and the soul of<br/>
&gt; another because the mothers want to visit?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow!  This sounds pretty drastic.  As trauma is pretty hard to measure and a<br/>
soul is a mystical substance about which I don&#39;t know a lot, I&#39;m afraid I<br/>
don&#39;t know the answer to that question.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Live with it&quot;?<br/>
&gt; If a child goes to another house and the resident child plays in<br/>
&gt; a different<br/>
&gt; room, that&#39;s hurtful too.    When parents put friendships above their own<br/>
&gt; children&#39;s comfort, they&#39;re sending the child a big message.  What of<br/>
&gt; bringing an older child to facilitate play among those children?<br/>
&gt; What of the<br/>
&gt; moms visiting when the kids are with dads?  There are options, and any<br/>
&gt; friendship that can&#39;t survive six months of phone instead of<br/>
&gt; in-person visits<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t a friendship worth hurting a child over.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not explaining myself well.  My seven year old says similar things to<br/>
his five year old brother and I wouldn&#39;t think of seperating them for six<br/>
months or even a day.  I tell him as above that if he doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
around his brother there are plenty of rooms in the house for him to be in<br/>
and friends&#39; houses for him to visit if he wants to get away.  The anger<br/>
usually lasts less than five minutes so I don&#39;t think it is such a big deal.<br/>
I always listen to what he has to say and I feel like I am respectful of his<br/>
opinion, but I also want to see my friends.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has friends that I don&#39;t care for.  I don&#39;t ask him not have them<br/>
over for six months, I just make sure that I am occupied elsewhere if I<br/>
don&#39;t want to be around them.  My children even have friends that I am<br/>
sometimes not too fond of, but I do my best to welcome them.  This is part<br/>
of sharing life together and I am not going to run my life on the fits of<br/>
anger of a seven year old or a three year old.  My friend&#39;s twins happen to<br/>
be the best friends of my younger son and part of the seven year old&#39;s anger<br/>
could be related to this at times.  Whatever.  He gets over it pretty quick<br/>
and if I kept them apart for long he misses them as much as I do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;As homeschoolers we don&#39;t have an enormous pool of friends to<br/>
&gt; choose from<br/>
&gt; and sometimes we have to live with what we have.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe this statement to be true.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s all relative.  I know many homeschoolers who feel they have lots of<br/>
friends, but to my mind they seem pretty isolated.  We try to have LOTS of<br/>
friends.  And the kind of friends that are like siblings that you can fight<br/>
with and get angry with and still be friends are the best kind and I value<br/>
them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I have seen siblings treat<br/>
&gt; each other in a fashion similar to how you have described the three year<br/>
&gt; olds&#39; behaviour.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s one thing to be insulted by a sibling who is stuck with your<br/>
&gt; for life.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s another to be insulted when you&#39;re a guest or a host.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children don&#39;t necessarily understand the role of guest or host.  If my son<br/>
is being ungracious as a host I may appologize to the other children.  They<br/>
never seem too bothered by it.  I am sure if I made a big deal about his<br/>
behaviour they would be more insulted.  But words are what you make of them.<br/>
My children do not hold back when they are upset, but by the same token they<br/>
recover very quickly also.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Don&#39;t expect much<br/>
&gt; from any of this though as it will probably pass in a few weeks or so and<br/>
&gt; you will wonder what all the fuss was about.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s going to pass in a few weeks, better for that to be a<br/>
&gt; time when the<br/>
&gt; kids are maturing separately.  Some hurts do last a long, long time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;All the fuss&quot; was about the feelings of humans.  Even three year<br/>
&gt; olds are<br/>
&gt; real people.  Their feelings are as big as ours are.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could be right and I could be wrong.  We are talking about children we<br/>
don&#39;t know.  I can only speak from my own experience and my kids tend to<br/>
have very short dislikes.  Many children that they disliked at first are now<br/>
their best friends.  I am glad I did not listen to advice like yours when I<br/>
still found opportunities to get them together.  As I said, we don&#39;t have a<br/>
huge pool of homeschool friends to choose from.<br/>
