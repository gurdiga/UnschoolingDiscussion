 </span></blockquote>Hi, Marianne --<br/>
<br/>
Awareness is the first step, so you are getting there on the deschooling<br/>
path.  (Give yourself a gold star, if your ideology allows that. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it does all come from your point of view and your frame of reference. <br/>
I find with my son, that it&#39;s thrilling to focus on what he IS doing, and<br/>
frustrating, demoralizing and wrong to focus on what he ISN&#39;T doing.<br/>
<br/>
Since, in some cases, children live down to expectations, it would be a<br/>
good idea if my &quot;ohmigosh he&#39;s never going to be able to ___&quot; thoughts<br/>
never, never leak into his conciousness.  Not fretting out loud is the<br/>
minimum requirement for that.  Not fretting inwardly is even better.  <br/>
<br/>
Be amazed by what your child can do (compared to what he could do at birth,<br/>
two years ago, etc.) and have faith in that amazing power.<br/>
<br/>
