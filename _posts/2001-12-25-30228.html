 </span></blockquote>I think you showed amazing restraint in your conversation. Personally I <br/>
like to point out all the people that die from the vaccines. I also point <br/>
out that each cost of a vaccine has a percentage that goes into a fund <br/>
for restitution to the parents of the children that die from it (although <br/>
many parents can&#39;t claim it since its very hard for them to prove it was <br/>
vaccine related death.)<br/>
<br/>
I also point out that all the cases of disease that are caused by <br/>
vaccines (the only Polio cases that exists in the world today are from <br/>
vaccinations) and back when I had money *laugh* I used to send them one <br/>
of Neil Zimmer&#39;s books on vaccinations.<br/>
<br/>
When pushed in conversation, I also point out how vaccines don&#39;t keep <br/>
kids safe, they just keep the symptoms from showing. Their poor little <br/>
bodies stop fighting and it turns into something a lot nastier sooner or <br/>
later in life. I&#39;m sure a lot of ADD is from vaccination poisoning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping to support a movement to keep our children safe.<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>
kolleen<br/>
<br/>
btw: this is a tough issue because there are one or two vaccines that are <br/>
safe. For example there is a company that makes a great tetanus vaccine <br/>
(I can get the name if anyone is interested). YET some states require <br/>
either a)religious b) medical. Very few states also allow c) conscious <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
This puts parents at a disadvantage that want to vaccinate for one (lets <br/>
say at the age of 5 for tetanus only) and not for any others. Which means <br/>
parents then have to go &#39;underground&#39; to make their choices.<br/>
<br/>
Tis a sad thing in my heart that our children are not our children when <br/>
it comes to things like this, yet something like spanking is legal. Oh, <br/>
I&#39;ll never understand it all.</div>

Karin, can you tell me how you heard that tetanus is the one to get? I&#39;m <br/>

ok.. so here&#39;s the plan. Next time she gets on our case, wants to <br/>
&quot;discuss&quot; it, whip out a John Holt book (or my favorite Real Lives by <br/>
Grace Lewellyn) and tell her the discussion will begin in one <br/>
week..AFTER she&#39;s finished reading the book :-) :-P *Maybe* then, <br/>
she&#39;ll either read it and learn or she&#39;ll stop the harassment. It <br/>
will at least put you in a position to have something *to* discuss <br/>
other than misled opinions about what you&#39;re doing ~or~ she won&#39;t <br/>
bring it up because she&#39;ll never take the time to learn about it.<br/>
Wishing you better success that I&#39;ve had!<br/>

I had a similar argument like this with my sister that never resolved.  My <br/>
sister is a lunchroom helper at her daughter&#39;s school, and one day she <br/>
attended a school seminar for teachers and other employees.  One of the <br/>
speakers spoke on vaccination, specifically pertussis.  When she came home, <br/>
she called me at our parents house.  (To make matters worse, all three of my <br/>
children were sick with whooping cough at the time, believed to have been <br/>
passed along by sick grandfather.)  She started explaining to me that I <br/>
should vaccinate because PEOPLE DIE from whooping cough.  I tried to explain <br/>
my research, and that the majority of deaths are not in previously healthy, <br/>
robust people like my children, and so on ...., and that she could plainly <br/>
see my children were not terribly sick from whooping cough.  She then made <br/>
the huge leap to accuse me that the only reason I homeschool is because I <br/>
won&#39;t vaccinate.  I (still polite) explained that I could write a religious <br/>
or personal exemption letter if I would like to send my children to school.  <br/>
And my homeschooling and lack of vaccinations are entirely unrelated except <br/>
in my desire to do what I feel is best for my children.  She then jumped back <br/>
to the pertussis vaccine and said again PEOPLE DIE.  I tried to explain that <br/>
I had compiled volumes of paperwork, read books, and even my M.D. supports my <br/>
vaccination decisions, and she starts quoting some county nurse that spoke at <br/>
the seminar that PEOPLE DIE.  I asked what specific arguments did she have so <br/>
that I could counter them, because I had done the research.  She then said <br/>
she did not want to discuss it because I am wrong and will never agree.  I <br/>
said I did not want to discuss it if she was going to be uninformed on the <br/>
subject and quote one biased person&#39;s opinion as her only argument.  She <br/>
again said I was wrong and wouldn&#39;t discuss it further.  I then said if she <br/>
truly believed I was wrong and endangering my children, shouldn&#39;t she try <br/>
harder to convince me of the error of my ways, and she hung up on me.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, my mother was in the room with me the whole time and only heard my side <br/>
of the conversation, and focused on me saying I would not discuss the <br/>
situation with an uninformed person, and told me that was rude.  <br/>
<br/>
As it is the custom in my family, everybody ignored this situation and it <br/>
went away.  This was three months ago, and everybody is friendly and on <br/>
speaking terms, but it as if the conversation never happened.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long.  Merry everything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210039526">Melinda, FWIW, I don&#39;t think you were rude to insist on an informed <br/>
discussion or no discussion at all.  Makes sense to me! The only <br/>
thing you could have added were some suggestions on where to find the <br/>
material but heck, that really isn&#39;t your problem ;-)!<br/>

My kids have been vaccinated once a few years ago, that was for tetanus. They were about age 5-8 I think. They both developed a little rash at the sight of the injection. It went away, though, and they seemed okay. I still question my decision not to vaccinate from time to time, and I really enjoy discussion about it. I have not discussed it with my MIL or FIL, though. FIL is a doctor, MIL is very pro-immunize against ANYTHING. We have successfully hidden our non-immunization viewpoint from them, so far. I avoid confrontation, if possible.<br/>

<br/>
What I have learned about tetanus is that it can basically live forever in <br/>
the soil, so there is no way for it to be eradicated forever as some <br/>
historical diseases have been, and since it is not like chicken pox or <br/>
measles, you can be on guard because something is &quot;going around&quot;.   Also, <br/>
because medical personnel expect everybody to be vaccinated, tetanus is often <br/>
overlooked until too late as the cause of your illness.  One more thing, the <br/>
tetanus vaccine has been around a long time, so we have had more of a chance <br/>
to view long term side effects, and even though everything has side effects, <br/>
we are able to judge tetanus a lot easier than say the newer hepatitis <br/>
vaccine.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t help putting views in.  It makes me feel that my research in the <br/>
subject is even more worthwhile.<br/>
