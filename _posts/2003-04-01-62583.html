<div id="ygrps-yiv-457736043">Well, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call Long John Silver&#39;s &quot;seafood&quot;, but they&#39;ve<br/>
always had malt vinegar for their fish.  (Of course, I once ordered<br/>
shrimp and chicken there and I wasn&#39;t sure which pieces were supposed to<br/>
be shrimp and which were supposed to be chicken, so I wouldn&#39;t look to<br/>
them for examples of fine dining).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope. You use vinegar when you get fish n chips from the chippy.<br/>
Fish being cod in batter and chips being what you lot call fries.<br/>
Yum.<br/>
5 weeks from now I will be in my favourite chippy in England. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh! Vinegar is yummy on crabs! Especially with old bay seasoning. Can you tell I live<br/>
near Maryland (actually in virginia but we vacation in Md and my family lives there<br/>
so I hope that it counts!)<br/>
<br/>
We host a crab feast for hubby&#39;s company (he is co-owner) each year and it would not<br/>
be complete without the vinegar.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Angela, I am not sure why.  But my family always did that.  And I hate the <br/>
taste of butter so it just made sense.  Maybe for me it was to cover the <br/>
flavor of the seafood a little.  I had lobster, crab, shrimp, clams etc so <br/>
much as a child that I can&#39;t stand the taste of it now.  <br/>
