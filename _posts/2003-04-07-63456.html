<div id="ygrps-yiv-87729737">For the kid more than the Mom:<br/>
<br/>
Read medical blogs - a bunch are linked here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.medrants.com/">http://www.medrants.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Butcher and &quot;autopsy&quot; an eating animal.  Compare what you find<br/>
with what you would find in a person - or another similar animal.<br/>
<br/>
Learn some Latin and Greek - it will take you further faster than<br/>
all the math in the world for the first part of med school.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteer at a vet clinic or zoo, which deal with a lot of the<br/>
same sick/well patient care, but without some of the privacy and<br/>
legal issues<br/>
<br/>
Connect with a doc or nurse practitioner and see if there are<br/>
opportunities to &quot;hang around and help&quot;.  That&#39;s harder to do now<br/>
with various restrictions, but our 6 loves going by the office of<br/>
a doc whose 3 girls are homeschoolers - he shows her &quot;stuff&quot; and<br/>
answers all kinds of questions.  After seeing an X-ray, she got<br/>
interested.  We now have a skeleton in the corner of the kitchen,<br/>
wearing a base ball cap, yellow kneesocks and a host of Post-It<br/>
note lables of different bones.  There is a box of miscellaneous<br/>
bones scavenged from the woods next to it - she compares them,<br/>
guesses where they came from, identifies features common and<br/>
dissimilar.<br/>
<br/>
Get involved with a disability organization;  though the medical<br/>
model no longer is welcome in the disability community, the<br/>
reality of chronic illness pervades those that deal with<br/>
progressive syndromes.  Hippo therapy organizations frequently<br/>
need help with the horses, combining the vet type thing with the<br/>
disability issues.<br/>
<br/>
Read medical thrillers, like Robin Cook&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the business of publicly funded medicine through<br/>

<br/>
Watch MASH<br/>
<br/>
Sit quietly in the corner of an ER some Saturday night and just<br/>
watch (you&#39;ll need permission - or at least ought to ask for it<br/>
to be congenial).<br/>
<br/>
Find out of the local hospital has a candy striper program.<br/>
<br/>
Take Red Cross First Aid courses.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to a pharmacist - preferable a Pharm D or a compounding<br/>
pharmacist - they are more likely to be in love with their field<br/>
and to answer questions enthusiastically.  Anybody who loves the<br/>
field enough to want to talk about it is a wealth of practical<br/>
chemistry and will slide a slew of math right into your head<br/>
while you&#39;re not scrunched up afraid of the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the local Community Mental Health Center to see if they<br/>
need help with clerical/activity related stuff and trade help for<br/>
brain picking about mental illness.<br/>
<br/>
Watch a video (given away like sugar candy) about laser eye<br/>
surgery, then fiddle with lenses and focal points. Buy a whole<br/>
fish for dinner, but dissect the eyes for fun.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Google and search the name of a disease, syndrome, organ or<br/>
whatever.  While you are there, look at professional associations<br/>
in allied health fields and at different university med schools.<br/>
Faculty pages and PR&#39;s about research are full of cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a medical school nearby, go take a look at the<br/>
library; heck, buy some books from the school books store or<br/>
venture out to Amazon and get the anatomy coloring book.<br/>
<br/>
.....if none of these appeal or you are out of ideas after trying<br/>
some, ask for more.</div>
