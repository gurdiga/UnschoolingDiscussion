<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798262682">Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
Feedback would be great about this money stuff with kids... When did some of <br/>
you start to give your kids money and did they have to do chores for that <br/>
money?  Were they expected to do chores anyway and then you gave them the <br/>
money just because?  Extra money for extra chores?  What age did you start <br/>
this?  Did you talk to them about money at this age and how to save and <br/>
spend?  We haven&#39;t introduced Zak to pocket money yet so we are not sure when <br/>
and if to do that.<br/>
<br/>
What has been your experience of this issue?<br/>
<br/>
