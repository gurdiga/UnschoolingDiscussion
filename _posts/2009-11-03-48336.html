<div id="ygrps-yiv-114944840">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (10) has recently discovered the joys of skyping internationally with a unschooled boy from Australia.  It&#39;s causing her to be excited by the idea of meeting more kids this way.  If you live outside of the US, or even somewhere besides the west coast, and have a kid that would like to chat, please e-mail me off list and I can give you her Skype name.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Joanna</div>
