<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235422899">How annoying I must be with all of my &quot;off the topic&quot; questions?  I have<br/>
a mothering kind of question for you.  I am really interested in finding<br/>
about my child&#39;s temperament.  I have a sneaky suspicion that we may be<br/>
on opposite ends of the spectrum.  I know an awful lot about learning<br/>
styles but I am more interested in getting the core of my dd and what<br/>
makes her tick.  Does any one have any book recommendations or even<br/>
better online websites or resources I can check out on temperaments<br/>
especially in children.  My girlfriend recommended a great site with a<br/>
&quot;test&quot; and everything but it was definitely aimed at adults.  Any<br/>
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

The only book I&#39;ve read like this is _Raising Christians Not Just Children_ <br/>
(I think) formerly titled _Raising the Curtain on Raising Children_<br/>
<br/>
Another book I really like is _Positive Personality Profiles_<br/>
