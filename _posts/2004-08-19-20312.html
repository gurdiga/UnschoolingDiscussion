office screaming at me that he hated me and that he didn&#39;t want me <br/>

that I couldn&#39;t take him to the library to look for a video he <br/>
wanted because I felt I couldn&#39;t trust him not to act that same way <br/>
in the library, then he had a huge tantrum over not getting his way <br/>
about that and was screaming at me until he noticed that I was <br/>
crying also and had tears dripping down my cheeks and he <br/>
asked &quot;what&#39;s wrong mom?&quot; And I told him that when he yelled at me <br/>
like that it was like he was hitting me hard, that it hurt when he <br/>
said those things. It was like an immediate light bulb went off in <br/>
his head and he starts telling me that he didn&#39;t mean those things <br/>
and that he doesn&#39;t want to hurt me and we gave each other a hug. I <br/>
think the day before (when I wrote the origional post) that he was <br/>
hungry and wasn&#39;t recognizing it, as well as possibly somewhat sleep <br/>
deprived as well as allergy season seems to have really hit him this <br/>
year, that night after he ate supper he went and laid down and went <br/>
to sleep about 3 hours earlier than usual! So anyhow I think that <br/>
perhaps mabye the worst part is over, he hasn&#39;t screamed at me like <br/>
that since hug so I can only hope we are going to a higher level of <br/>
communication. It&#39;s not going to be perfect but I think we are <br/>
making progress! I think him seeing my real feelings actually helped <br/>
us both a lot. Anyhow thanks to everyone who advised - I appreciate <br/>
it so much!!! Moza</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081172409">Hi Moza<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve described my guy, Jonathan 6, fairly well.  I&#39;m<br/>
happy that things are going better now.  Be prepared<br/>
if they seem to revert back for a while.  My daughter,<br/>
Lanora 13, has been one of my best reminders that<br/>
things are truly improving, even when J takes a spiral<br/>
down for a bit.  He has long periods where I am<br/>
convinced it&#39;s all over and can hardly remember what<br/>
it was like, then he will have a bad period.  Lanora<br/>
reminds me to not over-react.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing I can do for myself and for J is to<br/>
keep myself centered, think ahead about how to react<br/>
and hold the image of who I know he really is in my<br/>
mind.  It has also helped my stress level a LOT by<br/>
talking with other moms and learning that I&#39;m not<br/>
alone, there are so many of us who are dealing with<br/>
children who have temperaments like ours.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more thing, something that has helped the<br/>
most with J has been humor.  We began a game, when he<br/>
calls me &#39;stupid&#39; or says &#39;shut up&#39; I tickle him.  He<br/>
made up the second half of the game which is that he<br/>
has to say, &#39;I love you, mommy&#39; to make me stop.  It<br/>
diffused the power of the words and gave him an out<br/>
for a moment that may have escalated emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
Lanora and I, both, will withdraw our willingness to<br/>
play if he becomes too rude or aggressive.  He LIVES<br/>
to have us play with him so this has been a good<br/>
motivator to be more pleasant and self-controlled.  I<br/>
believe it&#39;s a natural consequence of unsocial<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend with a 23 year old son who tells me<br/>
that he was just like Jonathan.  Ben is very nice,<br/>
open, pleasant and personable now, it was such a good<br/>
thing for me to hear.  She says that she used to have<br/>
to sit on him to keep him from harming himself or<br/>
others when he was J&#39;s age, one would never know that<br/>
about him now.  However, she says he still has to put<br/>
real effort into empathy, to understand how others<br/>
think and feel.  He genuinely likes people but empathy<br/>
doesn&#39;t come naturally, perhaps it&#39;s the hallmark of<br/>
this kind of child.  Just because it&#39;s not natural<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t important to them or that they<br/>
can&#39;t learn how to understand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898333041">I think (or hope) perhaps that because I try and let my child <br/>
come to his own conculsions for the most part that those <br/>
conclusions, or what he &quot;learns&quot; is very valuable to him. He is one <br/>
of those kids who never seems to slowly learn something, it&#39;s like <br/>
he can&#39;t do it, he can&#39;t do it, he can&#39;t do it no matter how hard <br/>
anyone tries to &quot;teach&quot; him, then all of a sudden, usually when no <br/>
one expects it - He&#39;s doing it! <br/>
    So I think that perhaps this one one of those learning <br/>
experiences that he just didn&#39;t realize how much the yelling and <br/>
hitting was actually hurting me and he seems to really get it now! <br/>
Today we went into a convenience store for a soda (my only bad <br/>
habbit, I know it&#39;s corn syrup but I like my soda!) and as we were <br/>
headed out the door he said something like &quot;you&#39;re just stupid mom!&quot; <br/>
and I told him that what he said hurt me, he said then he was <br/>
just &quot;teasing with me&quot; so I told him if he wants to just &quot;tease&quot; <br/>
with me to call me &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; or something more like that <br/>
because those are words you can &quot;tease&quot; with and and not hurt <br/>
someone. Then I asked him why he called me stupid (normally I would <br/>
have probably asked him why he did it first, but I&#39;ve been so hurt <br/>
by his name calling lately I just blurted it out) and he said he was <br/>
just teasing so I said, &quot;well you&#39;re silly!&quot; and gave him a big kiss <br/>
to let him know I was teasing him. We&#39;ll probably go over the actual <br/>
meaning of stupid at some point so he can use it in a more correct <br/>
manner, but for now I&#39;m happy that that was our only &quot;clash&quot; of the <br/>
day and we both came out of it feeling good. Since my son isn&#39;t <br/>
yelled at or hit, or pulled around, etc.  by me or other family <br/>
members when he does something &quot;incorrect&quot;, and now he understands <br/>
for himself why it&#39;s important not to treat people this way, I think <br/>
things between us are going to be a lot better, I swear a light bulb <br/>
went off in his head!<br/>
     I think lots of kids who are punished when they do something <br/>
wrong, probably don&#39;t actually know the correct way, but they know <br/>
what to do to not be punished. So yeah, some people might think the <br/>
way my 6yo acts may not be &quot;acting as well as he should for his age&quot; <br/>
but I need to put my trust in that he is acting as well as he <br/>
understands and he is learning more (not being coersed, or told to, <br/>
but actually learning) all the time. <br/>
    I am babbling now but I have had such a circle of thinking this <br/>
month that a few days ago I was ready to give up the unschooling / <br/>
taking children seriously/ natural learning (whatever you wanna call <br/>
it!) approach because things were just getting so bad and now I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t think of doing anything differently! Just had to share - <br/>
Thanks again for everyone&#39;s support! Moza</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360372355">Another thing to consider is constitutional homeopathy. It helps with <br/>
these type of allergy and emotional issues. I have seen it help all <br/>
members of my family, significantly. I don&#39;t understand it all though.<br/>
