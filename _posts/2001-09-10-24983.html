Christians and non-Christians, relaxed (or not so relaxed) <br/>
homeschoolers to the absolutely radical unschoolers.  From more <br/>
tradional disciplinarians to non-coercive parents.  And the whole <br/>
spectrum in between.  I mostly read here, and read and read and <br/>
read.  I enjoy the wide variety of opinions here.  I enjoy the <br/>
TV/nintendo debate.  The chore list debate. The definition of <br/>
unschooling debate.  I have learned so much from everyone, whether I <br/>
agree with them or not.  Some things I feel may work for my family <br/>
and I try them.  Some things I don&#39;t.  I am always interested in <br/>
hearing about what others do, no matter how diametrically opposed to <br/>
what I&#39;m doing.  It opens my mind up to other possibilities, other <br/>
ways to do things.<br/>
<br/>
Many people here have written well thought out responses to your <br/>
posts.  But it seems you don&#39;t want to hear what&#39;s being said.  If <br/>
you don&#39;t agree, fine.  But please take some time to consider others  <br/>
points of view.  I hardly think Joyce was even remotely suggesting <br/>
what was said above.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a better comparison with unschooling and Christianity would <br/>
be, a christian saying they were a christian, but then turning around <br/>
and saying &quot;but I don&#39;t REALLY believe Jesus was the son of God.  I <br/>
just like what he had to say.&quot;  You could see this would be a problem <br/>
with most christians.  To me it&#39;s the same as saying, &quot;we&#39;re <br/>
unschoolers, but I have them do some writing and math to cover the <br/>
basics&quot;.   You&#39;re not accepting and trusting in the ideal.  That&#39;s <br/>
fine.<br/>
It&#39;s not unschooling though.  You don&#39;t have to define yourself as an <br/>
unschooler, or anything else.  I didn&#39;t for a long time and was fine <br/>
with that.  I kept striving for the ideal of unschooling, which <br/>
became apparent to me by reading discussions like this.  I had a <br/>
huge &quot;ah-ha!&quot; moment, and took the leap of faith.  The difference <br/>
from then to now is so immense, that I now understand why unschoolers <br/>
want to make it clear, just what unschooling is.  Everytime you &quot;slip <br/>
back&quot; and require learning from you children, you destroy the trust <br/>
that was building up in them.  The trust that you believe in them.  <br/>
The trust that they are smart enough to figure it out on their own.  <br/>
The trust that you belive that their interests and ideas are whats <br/>
right for them.  When I relized that simple truth, I decided never <br/>
to &quot;slip&quot; again, no matter how fearful I became.  I haven&#39;t.  I now <br/>
see the tremendous difference it has made in all our lives.  What the <br/>
trust really does for my children.  It&#39;s a lot of work, this letting <br/>
go of old mentalities.  I&#39;m still working.  <br/>
I&#39;m writing this to try to help explain the difference in attitude, <br/>
and why so many say, &quot;that&#39;s not unschooling&quot;.  I hope I made a <br/>
little sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128568192">I have to totally agree with Janet, I need to spend more time reading and less time thinking up a good response to something I disagree with.  Even when I don&#39;t like what someone else says I try to learn something from it.  While I started out seeing your point of view Bridget I think you may be on the defense so much after feeling like you were being attacked that now all comments are coming across that way.  That happens to me.......I get my feelings hurt and then I can&#39;t see past that to see some constructive comments being made........I just see it as another attack.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503755602">Hi,<br/>
  I cannot agree with the Christian/unschooling comparison. For me, my<br/>
version of Christian is very clear, but to the many people I know that<br/>
consider themselves good Christians, I wouldn&#39;t be considered as good as<br/>
they are.<br/>
My idea of a good Christian is to follow Jesus&#39; example and learn from his<br/>
teachings- not actually worship him and secretly condemn those who don&#39;t.<br/>
Most of the people he ran with were &quot;devilish&quot;. Also, people can learn the<br/>
same message he taught other ways, because the knowledge is out there, and<br/>
one doesn&#39;t have to be Christian to understand it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105185553">Well, see this is why I thought you were irritated at me &lt;g&gt;  The post about<br/>
how some posts effect me (reminding me of ps) followed a post in which you<br/>
lit into someone else and it &quot;felt&quot; like you had brought the same feelings<br/>
into the post to me.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the sooner they make post-a-vision (the kidlets&#39; name for the<br/>
computer of the future where you see and interact with the other poster) a<br/>
reality (defined as affordable for most folks), the  sooner we will all see<br/>
that what comes across in the written word is not necessarily how the poster<br/>
was feeling when they wrote it!<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who is off to collect seeds for next years garden and then we are off<br/>
to the mall so the kidlets can spend their paycheck.  Hope everyone else has<br/>
a nice day.<br/>

&gt; I have to totally agree with Janet, I need to spend more time reading and<br/>
less time thinking up a good response to something I disagree with.  Even<br/>
when I don&#39;t like what someone else says I try to learn something from it.<br/>
While I started out seeing your point of view Bridget I think you may be on<br/>
the defense so much after feeling like you were being attacked that now all<br/>
comments are coming across that way.  That happens to me.......I get my<br/>
feelings hurt and then I can&#39;t see past that to see some constructive<br/>
comments being made........I just see it as another attack.  I hope you can<br/>
stop and look at each post for what its worth.  Some won&#39;t be worth<br/>
anything, but others are worth their weight in gold if they make us really<br/>
think about our decisions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323343048">This is argumentative!  If she has determined that she is not defensive then<br/>
it would be adult and respectful to accept her word.  I&#39;d say she is in a<br/>
better position to judge how she is feeling.  This continual dissecting and<br/>
describing people with various adjectives that have negative connotations is<br/>
obsessive!  You are not judge and jury, so perhaps *you* should stop writing<br/>
so frequently telling people what they think, feel or are acting and do a<br/>
little more reading as you dictate others should do!<br/>
<br/>
And why she is here is her business.  I&#39;ve never read anywhere that folks<br/>
need to apply and be screened before they can join and that their motives<br/>
are be examed!  In fact, that sounds a tad bit paranoid!  Good heavens, a<br/>
homeschooler might be here hoping to contaminate all those prospective new<br/>
unschoolers.  Geez, give me a break!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  I stopped being defensive sometime early Sunday.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As evidenced by...   what?<br/>
&gt; This is defensive:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;You know, you might want to take your own advice just a little.  I<br/>
&gt; stopped being defensive sometime early Sunday.  I really don&#39;t care what<br/>
&gt; you want to call my system of running my household.  What I do care about<br/>
&gt; is that if I had been someone truly in need of advice or a place to feel<br/>
&gt; comfortable, this would not have been it.  I would have cut and run after<br/>
&gt; my TV post got blasted as being dishonest with my kids.<br/>
&gt; I was just pointing out that that last post about what &#39;unschooling&#39; is<br/>
&gt; really sounded like &#39;Math is like Satan&#39;.  It would have sounded that way<br/>
&gt; to me no matter where it came from or who said it or what the history of<br/>
&gt; the conversation was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again, people are trying to do you a favor.<br/>
&gt; Again, you&#39;re doing WAY more writing than reading.<br/>
&gt; Again, you don&#39;t think you NEED any of our &quot;favors.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again:  Why are you here then?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t be here (although I have no doubt you will<br/>
love<br/>
&gt; to interpret it that way).  I&#39;m asking what you hoped to gain from this<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; besides possibly the joy of antagonism.<br/>

It usually only seems to matter if there is a discussion going and people<br/>
disagree with a party.  There are folks on the list whose kids are enrolled<br/>
in ps, there are folks who are homeschoolers, there are folks that are doing<br/>
school-at-home.  They all use the term &quot;unschooling&quot; and no one has told<br/>
them otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
There are also many definitions of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  If you go to a radical<br/>
unschooling list lots of the advise on this list on how to &quot;encourage&quot; your<br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t be considered unschooling either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927947103">the kidlets are gardening nuts and it is one of those family things.  I<br/>
don&#39;t make time, they drag me out, although it isn&#39;t usually kicking and<br/>
screaming &lt;g&gt;  This year they are letting one of each plant go to seed so<br/>
they don&#39;t have to, hopefully, buy seeds next year.<br/>
<br/>
At anyrate, for flowers, depending on the type, the seed pods will start to<br/>
open and that is the time to pick them.  They have a bunch of those plastic<br/>
dish thingys that you put under pots to catch water and they put sticky<br/>
labels on them for the type of flowers.  Then they open the pods and shake<br/>
the seeds out.  They leave them in the trays to dry for about a month and<br/>
then put them in seal-a-meal bags and seal them (zip locks would work or<br/>
even waxed paper folded up and then sealed).  then stick them in a paper bag<br/>
or under the cupboard away from light or even in the back of your fridge.<br/>
<br/>
Oops, youngest is reading over my shoulder.  If they are for plants you want<br/>
to bloom early, they stick them in the freezer for about a month and then<br/>
plant them.  This is important with some seeds if you live in a real mild<br/>
climate or if you have real mild winters.<br/>
<br/>
As to books, we have tons of them that I&#39;ve ordered or the kidlets have<br/>
bought at book sales.  We like the Rodales the best.<br/>

have to do it.  As I might not pass a lot of tests various people might come <br/>

  Well, see this is why I thought you were irritated at me &lt;g&gt;  The post about<br/>
  how some posts effect me (reminding me of ps) followed a post in which you<br/>
  lit into someone else and it &quot;felt&quot; like you had brought the same feelings<br/>
  into the post to me.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess the sooner they make post-a-vision (the kidlets&#39; name for the<br/>
  computer of the future where you see and interact with the other poster) a<br/>
  reality (defined as affordable for most folks), the  sooner we will all see<br/>
  that what comes across in the written word is not necessarily how the poster<br/>
  was feeling when they wrote it!<br/>
<br/>
  Lynda, who is off to collect seeds for next years garden and then we are off<br/>
  to the mall so the kidlets can spend their paycheck.  Hope everyone else has<br/>
  a nice day.<br/>

  &gt; I have to totally agree with Janet, I need to spend more time reading and<br/>
  less time thinking up a good response to something I disagree with.  Even<br/>
  when I don&#39;t like what someone else says I try to learn something from it.<br/>
  While I started out seeing your point of view Bridget I think you may be on<br/>
  the defense so much after feeling like you were being attacked that now all<br/>
  comments are coming across that way.  That happens to me.......I get my<br/>
  feelings hurt and then I can&#39;t see past that to see some constructive<br/>
  comments being made........I just see it as another attack.  I hope you can<br/>
  stop and look at each post for what its worth.  Some won&#39;t be worth<br/>
  anything, but others are worth their weight in gold if they make us really<br/>
  think about our decisions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83795678">Everyone has their own gardens.  Hubby just has tomatoes this year but<br/>
usually does vining stuff (cucumbers, zukes, melons).  Eldest kidlet has a<br/>
flower garden with &quot;antiques&quot; and heritage flowers in it.  Middle kidlet has<br/>
flowers and what he calls &quot;weird stuff&quot; which are oddball plants he finds<br/>
and brings home to put in his garden.  Youngest kidlet has strawberries,<br/>
radishes, garlic and potatoes.  I peas, beans, lettuce, raspberries, herbs,<br/>
a butterfly garden, a rose garden, a scent garden, window boxes, hanging<br/>
planters, and lots of potted plants that hubby has brought home because<br/>
folks said they were &quot;dead&quot; and now they are &quot;happy.&quot;  We all also have<br/>
trees that we are raising.  Oh, and buckets of houseplants.  We usually have<br/>
more veggies but this has been a weird weather year and we didn&#39;t get a lot<br/>
of things in %-{<br/>
<br/>
We also collect wildflower seeds to be used in replanting for naturalizing<br/>
and working to remove invasion introduced plants.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; If you go to a radical<br/>
&gt; unschooling list lots of the advise on this list on how to &quot;encourage&quot; your<br/>
&gt; kids wouldn&#39;t be considered unschooling either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love the direction of some or all of these lists -- I&#39;m always hoping to<br/>
meet unschoolers more radical than I am, so I can learn.<br/>
