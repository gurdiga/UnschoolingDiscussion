teach your kids your beliefs.  That&#39;s what we were taught when they were <br/>
baptized.  That we bring them up and teach them in the Catholic religion.  <br/>
There was no mention that if you home or unschool, that God would punish us.  <br/>
(unless I missed something-LOL)  Being taught something in school, doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean it&#39;s right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    I guess a lot of people consider giving money the way to get to heaven.  <br/>
That&#39;s a view I don&#39;t support.  When I had my dd in catholic school, I was <br/>
paying tuition and still paying taxes to the ps system.  I am now hs&#39;ing but <br/>
still have to pay taxes for a system I don&#39;t believe in.  I guess we&#39;re <br/>
screwed no matter what!<br/>
    Maybe if we started our own home/un-schooling state or island...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653008877">I have never responded to this list before but since there is a Catholic<br/>
question and I am CAtholic, I thought I would reply.  Actually, Catholics<br/>
who homeschool do NOT have to send their children to CCD or any other<br/>
type of program.  Canon Law of the church even states this.  It also<br/>
states parents are the primary educators of their children and should see<br/>
to their religious upbringing.  They don&#39;t list the how to&#39;s.  <br/>

Thanks, Lisa. I know this and would quote Canon Law to any priests, etc - the practuce in some patrishes is  sometimes different to the Canon Law, isn&#39;t it? But, actually, I have never had any criticism from clerics - just from other Catholic friends - homeschoolers and non homeschoolers. In a way, since the criticism is from friends, it makes it a bit more difficult. Or maybe I am too sensitive! lol! ..Leonie W.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-410588554">Thanks for the answers, <br/>
 <br/>
I probably need to work on the changing the topic thing,  I&#39;ve never been very good at that.       And realizing that even if someone asks how the kids are and how the homeschooling is going,  they might not really care.  :(           My niavete is showing! (although I&#39;m sure its already been shown)      The real challenge is trying to differentiate between the two!   <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe with all this transformation I will eventually find enough friends that I won&#39;t have to worry so much about it....one can hope. <br/>
