Lutherans and Episcopalians work hard not to be freaky, though!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Some Southern Baptists would seem truly freakish to you, I&#39;m sure, if you <br/>
hung out with them a while and they explained what they believed and why.   <br/>
By the true definition of &quot;freak.&quot;  And there are a LOT of them.  And a lot <br/>
of them are homeschoolers.<br/>

You got me. I had in mind the regulating bodies of those denominations. I <br/>
don&#39;t doubt (really and truly) the goodness of the large majority of the <br/>
members of those denominations. But, as someone who takes the Gospel <br/>
seriously, I find much in the official statements of both denominations <br/>
disturbing, and not historically orthodox.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

I think that you have made several interesting points, and of course you are<br/>
entitled to your opinion.  I will also confess that I have not read ever<br/>
post in this thread in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
You personally find spiritual fulfillment differently than the Southern<br/>
Baptists and Lutherans.  However, there are still many people who are<br/>
happily Southern Baptist or Evangelical Lutheran.  I would suggest that the<br/>
fact that it works for them makes it an equally valid path to spiritual<br/>
fulfillment.  If you have specific criticisms of their beliefs, please state<br/>
them.  But your description, &quot;freaky&quot;, strikes me as inappropriate.  I grew<br/>
up Lutheran, and am presently (and happily) Episcopalian.  Please don&#39;t<br/>
judge my choice of path.<br/>

What is staggering to witness at this list, is the amount of lives f**ked <br/>
over by Christian denominations unwilling to give up control of the working <br/>
of salvation (Christ&#39;s work, not theirs, by the way); denominations that lay <br/>
the burden of salvation on the backs of followers -- a burden that no one can <br/>
handle, let alone accomplish. This is where the fundamentalist &quot;Do this, <br/>
don&#39;t do that ...&quot; comes from; the belief that it is up to us to please God. <br/>
*This is the very thing that Jesus preached AGAINST!* <br/>
<br/>
The burden of being righteous gives no hope for the murderer, raised in the <br/>
ghetto, forsaken by both parents and his own country. No hope for the wife <br/>
whose husband left her with no money and 5 kids and no ability or desire to <br/>
check to see if there is &quot;sin in her life that maybe needs to be confessed,&quot; <br/>
or that maybe she &quot;needs to get right with God,&quot; and &quot;have faith.&quot; Have <br/>
faith? After that? Get right with God? How does such a person in such a state <br/>
even know what goes on in her own heart, let alone tell whether or not her <br/>
&quot;sinner&#39;s prayer&quot; was sincere? <br/>
<br/>
The difference between the above, and orthodox evangelicalism, is that <br/>
orthodoxy teaches that *God has already got right with us!* Period. End of <br/>
story. It&#39;s not about what you eat, drink, watch, teach, or screw. God is <br/>
faithful; God is righteous; God is good; God is holy; God has forgiven us in <br/>
Christ; and the goodness of Christ -- not our goodness -- is what gets us to <br/>
Heaven. These are all gifts from God that people can do nothing to earn. <br/>
<br/>
Any moral reform in the believer&#39;s life is the result of the private inner <br/>
workings of the Holy Spirit, and is known as &quot;sanctification.&quot; Sanctification <br/>
is not man&#39;s effort at getting holy, or again, &quot;getting right with God.&quot; It <br/>
is the exact opposite. It is God working in the believer, patiently, to make <br/>
the believer more like God. The intention of sanctification is not to make <br/>
the sinner more pleasing to God -- that has already been accomplished by <br/>
Christ -- but because holiness is God&#39;s nature, and he made man in his image. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s true or not is another thing altogether.  : )<br/>

As a Taoist I would submit that it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s true or not. It&#39;s <br/>
your belief that gives it life.<br/>

We are!   Debi, smiling angelically, and hoping you all at least snicker instead of getting mad.  I&#39;m not trying to be further divisive, just provide a little comic relief.  In Canada, we used to have a TV show called &quot;4 on the Floor&quot;, and one of the weekly sketches was called &quot;Mr. Canoe Head&quot;.  It was always introduced as being a &quot;story so outrageous, only a Mormon would believe it!&quot;  That line always cracked me up.  On another side note, last time I was in Israel, I wanted to see some of the sites (and sights) related to Jesus and His journeys.  Imagine my surprise (and snickering) to see places labelled &quot;Catholic Shepherd&#39;s Field&quot;  &quot;Baptists&#39; Shepherd Field&quot;  etc -- I didn&#39;t even know the shepherds that were informed by the angels that Christ was born had denominations!  Okay, I am being facetious here, but the point is -- why freak out about exactly which field the angels appeared in?  Surely the important thing is that they came at all! (If that is what you believe)  Some of the posts on this line are fun to read and think about, others spread far more heat than light.   Just jumping in (why should you lot have all the fun?)  <br/>
