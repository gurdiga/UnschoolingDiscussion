-=-When <br/>
my kids take college courses, the teachers go nuts over what fantastic <br/>
students they are - they stand out by a mile. I know why - it is <br/>
because the teachers can see in their eyes, read in their body <br/>
language, hear in their voices and tell just by the looks on their <br/>
faces that they are there to learn and understand, not to swallow and <br/>
regurgitate undigested material. There are teachers who get excited by <br/>
the existence of such rare students.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how Kirby&#39;s teachers are feeling about him, but I needed to <br/>
correct something I think I wrote here.  I said I thought he was hanging out with <br/>
people his own age, but he told me a couple of stories the other day.  He was <br/>
talking through the last few things he wanted to be sure to do and one was to <br/>
&quot;get Michelle&#39;s contact information.&quot;  (I don&#39;t remember her real name, so I <br/>
loaned her &#39;Michelle.&#39;)  She was his regular math partner.  I assumed she was <br/>
someone his age, but didn&#39;t ask.   He mentioned that she had a 14 year old <br/>
daughter, and so I added up and thought she must be at least 30.  I asked him and <br/>
he shrugged and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but she talked about her daughter working <br/>
at Subway, so I thought she might be 14.&quot;  I said probably more like 16, that <br/>
few places would hire 14 year olds and he had been an exception.<br/>
<br/>
He told a story of someone else in the class commenting that they got along <br/>
so well they should become a couple, and her saying, &quot;But I&#39;m married,&quot; and <br/>
laughing.  So he does have older friends.    <br/>
<br/>
And he named another person, maybe my age he said (I&#39;m 51), who had a hurt <br/>
ankle early in the semester and asked for a ride one day (just to the class in <br/>
general) and he gave her a ride, and offered her a ride every time until it <br/>
just became the routine that he would drive her home.   She gave him $10 for gas <br/>
money the other day, and he said he accepted it and told her that of all the <br/>
people who had ever offered him gas money, she was the only one who&#39;d actually <br/>
given him any. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
So for two months he&#39;s been driving an older woman to her apartment after <br/>
every class and didn&#39;t think it worth mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
Seems interesting to me.  I&#39;m guessing some people his age (maybe most) would <br/>
be embarrassed or frustrated with an older woman who needed a ride.<br/>

Probably most kids Kirby&#39;s age who had been to school wouldn&#39;t even think to offer a ride to an older woman.  Their world experience is almost exclusively other kids their own age.  And how many 18 yo kids would be considered a likely, reliable choice for a regular ride by a 51 yo woman?<br/>
<br/>
Your kids are such nice people, Sandra!<br/>

This just made me tearfully mother-proud.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s *trustworthy*.  That kind of solid character that most people  recognize <br/>
right off.<br/>

Thanks, Karen.<br/>
 <br/>
I have e-mail I haven&#39;t read from Sunday and following, so sorry for me  <br/>
posting back to older stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby brought a little paper home today that says he&#39;s getting an award  <br/>
tomorrow for academic achievements this semester.  As he&#39;s only taking two  <br/>
classes and neither for college credit, I don&#39;t know what the deal it, and it  might <br/>
be several from each class, or everyone who got an A, or really a special  <br/>
deal.  He didn&#39;t know what was up, but I&#39;ll go tomorrow and see.   Holly says <br/>
she&#39;ll go with me.  Marty will be at work and Keith in the  hospital.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope they don&#39;t say &quot;And here&#39;s someone who was apparently raised by  <br/>
wolves and had never seen a math book before, but he got an A!&quot;<br/>
