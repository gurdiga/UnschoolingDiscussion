<div id="ygrps-yiv-917993776">After a week and a half of intense searching, I am throwing in the <br/>
towel and posting here.  My 12almost13yo dd is looking for a snail mail <br/>
penpal.  Everything we have so far investigated has a membership fee or <br/>
is not snail mail.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone out there has a daughter that may like to write, please email <br/>
me.  Her interests are building things (with wood,legos, clay, lincoln <br/>
logs, etc.), softball, loves music, video games and is an avid Roller <br/>
Coaster tycoon player, enjoys sewing, making friends and is the girl <br/>
from the well in The Ring for Halloween.  If you feel sure about a <br/>
connection between my dd and yours, please feel free to email her <br/>
directly at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lilmissjess_910@...">lilmissjess_910@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a line on mail penpals or where we could get a catalogue, <br/>
please email me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Sally</div>
