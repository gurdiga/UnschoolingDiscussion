<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028243247">Greetings again, both long timers and newbies!<br/>
<br/>
I have been on the list forever it seems, but life always seems to catch up <br/>
with me causing me to go web only from time to time. I will introduce myself <br/>
for those who don&#39;t know me:) <br/>
<br/>
My name is Teri Brown and I am an unschooling, momwriting, radical Christian <br/>
type of person. This list has always made me feel less weird(with my odd <br/>
unschooling beliefs) and that is probably why I like to hang here from time <br/>
to time:) <br/>
<br/>
I have two children, dd,10 and ds,11 who love to do all sorts of things, most <br/>
of which make me feel like a cab driver without pay! I hope to be able to <br/>
stay a while this time.<br/>
Peace to all!<br/>
Teri <br/>
