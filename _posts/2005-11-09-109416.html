<div id="ygrps-yiv-57726813">I know that learning disorders are for the most part overrated excuses that <br/>
teachers give because they can&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; kids to read.  However, there are <br/>
some children who truly do have dyslexia and other processing issues or <br/>
disabilities.  My son didn&#39;t read until he was 9 going on 10.  We had more <br/>
fights, heated arguments and me accusing that he was being lazy and <br/>
uncooperative.  It pains me to say this but 99.9% of the problem was that <br/>
&quot;I&quot; was more concerned about what others thought about him not being able to <br/>
read.  How can &quot;I&quot; possibly be doing a good job educating my children at <br/>
home when my almost 10 year old can&#39;t even read simple words like an and <br/>
the?  Well I found out after the damage was done that my son truly does have <br/>
dyslexia, but even with this very real problem learned almost over night on <br/>
his own when &quot;he&quot; was truly ready.  I didn&#39;t know about letting learn on his <br/>
own at the time I continued to push and push until our relationship was <br/>
seriously damaged.  I am still at this point rebuilding that.  It&#39;s not easy <br/>
to fix once it&#39;s broken.  By the way this same child, once learning on his <br/>
own to read has read somewhere between 400-500 books in the last 1 1/2 <br/>
years.  With comprehension.  He can&#39;t read aloud very well, but to himself <br/>
he reads almost constantly. If I don&#39;t get to the library when he has <br/>
finished the last of his 12 books for the week he will find something around <br/>
the house to read.  Heck, I have even caught him reading the dictionary!  He <br/>
still can&#39;t write or spell very well, but I believe that will come in time <br/>
because he sees and reads words all the time.  And even if he never writes, <br/>
well maybe that is not going to be one of the things he pursues in his life <br/>
anyway.  My point in all of this is that you need to relax.  Enjoy reading <br/>
to him.  Never, never ever ridicule him or compare him to his siblings or <br/>
friends.  He will get their in his own time.  What makes your timetable the <br/>
right timetable anyway?  I had to ask myself the same questions.  Just love <br/>
him for all his unique qualities and respect the differences.  Help him to <br/>
do all the things he wants that require reading.  I know when my kids were <br/>
younger and I have 5, that when the youngest at the time wanted a drink or a <br/>
snack or whatever, they weren&#39;t old enough to get it themselves. The needed <br/>
help.  I didn&#39;t get angry with them because they couldn&#39;t manage yet, or <br/>
force them to climb up on the cabinets to get a cup or whatever.  That would <br/>
be dangerous and unsafe.  I or one of the older siblings would help them. <br/>
The dangers are different obviously, but the damage is just as significant <br/>
in the long run and even immediately.  Don&#39;t deprive him of his need and <br/>
desire to learn other things because you can&#39;t get past the fact that he <br/>
can&#39;t read yet.  It&#39;s not about the order in which they learn things it&#39;s <br/>
helping to foster a love of learning of all sorts of things when they are <br/>
ready.  Lose the worlds timetable, and devote yourself to loving your son. <br/>
And remember the advice you sought out here may sound harsh and go against <br/>
your grain, but if you let it sink in and examine yourself and your motives <br/>
you will begin to see where the real issues lie.   My son now knows more <br/>
stuff than I ever hope to know and I am so proud of him.  I love to tell <br/>
people how he learned to read late and now it doesn&#39;t bother him at all.  In <br/>
fact I read this post to him before I sending it and he said that he hoped <br/>
that it helped you and your son. Help and change don&#39;t always come easy to <br/>
those of us who have spent years doing things differently regardless of the <br/>
fact that we were making no real progress.  For some reason we just keep <br/>
plodding along in the same wrong direction because the world says it is <br/>
right so it must be right.  Right?  WRONG!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
