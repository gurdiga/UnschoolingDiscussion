<div id="ygrps-yiv-245032700">Hello again Pat,<br/>
Think of it like a commune. Everybody has freedoms but you also have to<br/>
respect your fellow munies :-) (is that a word?)  If you are used to the<br/>
kids being in bed at, say 10, then what you do now is tell them that they do<br/>
not have to adhere to a certain bedtime *but* they still have to respect<br/>
your privacy and your need for quiet time.  This has nothing to do with<br/>
unschooling.. it has to do with them learning how to live under the same<br/>
roof with others. <br/>
If it&#39;s quiet time you need, tell the kids that at 10:00, you plan on blah<br/>
blah blahing (reading?) and they are free to do something quietly in their<br/>
rooms or in the basement. If they choose not to, then *you* might just have<br/>
to choose to get up at 6a.m, playing that army wake-up call &lt;g&gt; and show<br/>
them what disrespect for others&#39; needs feels like.  I mean, tell them once<br/>
what is expected of them. If they don&#39;t do whatever it is, don&#39;t nag.. just<br/>
show them how it feels if the shoe were on the other foot.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re coming along great, Pat. Just think outside the box ;-)!<br/>

After giving my children the freedom to decide their own bedtime a few days<br/>
ago, I am beginning to miss my few hours of quiet time.  This is very hard. <br/>
How does everyone else get a moments piece?<br/>

the day or early evening, to read a book while my son is otherwise<br/>
engaged. We have an early bedtime for the kid so that my husband and I can<br/>
have some time alone. I&#39;ve never been able to make love while my child is<br/>
awake in the house (except when he was a lot younger). Mostly, I guess,<br/>
bc we live in a small apartment. I have a hard time<br/>
relaxing. I realize this is a very personal issue, but how do some of<br/>
y&#39;all deal with that? The husband works in the early am, and is out like a<br/>
light at around 10:30. <br/>

I could really relate when you say you just can&#39;t relax.  I don&#39;t know how <br/>
much feedback you&#39;ll get on this one  :), but lately my normal routine after <br/>
&#39;the door is closed&#39;, no matter what time of day or night, is taking a <br/>
suspicious quick peek - under the bed and in the closet!  Talk about <br/>
&#39;paranoia&#39;!  lol  The little critters are EVERYWHERE!!!  Though, I can&#39;t say <br/>
this has hindered us too, too much... we did manage to have SIX!  Haha!<br/>

both (early hours and middle of the night), and evening hours work best<br/>
for us. The problem is I&#39;m an insomniac and have to be on a very strict<br/>
schedule for bedtime (regular cardio exercise and daily meditation help<br/>
too). As my son gets older, though, he will definitely be staying up later<br/>
so this problem will ultimately have to be dealt with. I myself had all<br/>
bedtime restrictions lifted around age 10.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very cool. I guess bc I have just one child I would feel guilty shutting<br/>
my door to him at night. He wouldn&#39;t have any one else to bounce off of<br/>
and would feel, I&#39;m afraid, left out, y&#39;know? Not having siblings to hang<br/>
out w/when mom and dad are otherwise occupied and not letting him in the<br/>
bedroom. He has his own bed and room but we have an &quot;open bed&quot; policy and<br/>
he often ends up in ours sometime during the course of the night. He&#39;s<br/>
five.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659777504">I am so glad I found this group!!! My husband and I agonize over this very thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with us, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to really put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one night in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so used to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I can&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is important not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s need to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of better.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would increase, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely remodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in choosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like a house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does love her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of what to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it just breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on what has worked? I just joined the group yesterday, so I may have missed earlier discussions.<br/>

In my book 4 is almost newborn! We have always had a family bed. I might also add that they all breast fed until they were around 5.  My partner and I were together for almost 9 years before we had any kids so sex where ever and when ever wasn&#39;t an issue. Our kids are now 18, 12 and 7. The 18 year old slept in our family bed or his bed with dad or little brother or little brothers bed etc...until he was 13 or 14. He never sleeps with any of us anymore :~( and we miss him. <br/>
We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are left. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has friends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They all have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick, can&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever we&#39;re most comfy.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my moms, until he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many well meaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or even large parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with negative results. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from a 2 week road trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the time cleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~). <br/>
<br/>
These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking for a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or to school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our doors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are your years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know it!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>

  I am so glad I found this group!!! My husband and I agonize over this very thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with us, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to really put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one night in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so used to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I can&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is important not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s need to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of better.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would increase, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely remodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in choosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like a house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does love her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of what to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it just breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on what has worked? I just joined the group yesterday, so I may have missed earlier discussions.<br/>

No, you don&#39;t sound at all like you&#39;re looking for a way out! Only the most loving and committed parents would ever find themselves in your situation. I was just moved  to tell you how another &quot;perfectly normal&quot; family lives and loves. I hope I provided a little support and comfort for you and your kind and thoughtful choices.<br/>

    These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house.

    Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are your years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know it!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>

        &gt; much feedback you&#39;ll get on this one  :), but lately my normal routine after <br/>
        &gt; &#39;the door is closed&#39;, no matter what time of day or night, is taking a <br/>
        &gt; suspicious quick peek - under the bed and in the closet!  Talk about <br/>
        &gt; &#39;paranoia&#39;!  lol  The little critters are EVERYWHERE!!!  Though, I can&#39;t say <br/>
        &gt; this has hindered us too, too much... we did manage to have SIX!  Haha!<br/>
<br/>
        Very cool. I guess bc I have just one child I would feel guilty shutting<br/>
        my door to him at night. He wouldn&#39;t have any one else to bounce off of<br/>
        and would feel, I&#39;m afraid, left out, y&#39;know? Not having siblings to hang<br/>
        out w/when mom and dad are otherwise occupied and not letting him in the<br/>
        bedroom. He has his own bed and room but we have an &quot;open bed&quot; policy and<br/>
        he often ends up in ours sometime during the course of the night. He&#39;s<br/>
        five.<br/>
<br/>
        &gt; Ps- Also I enjoyed what you wrote on the TV thread about your college friends <br/>
        &gt; - that was a pretty balanced remark...  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lynn, I remember listening to the &quot;Dr. Laura Show&quot; on the radio once where a couple called in with this problem.  Dr. Laura said she thought it was healthy for kids to know that their parents made love and that it was not necessary to hide it.  She did not say to flaunt it in front of them but in the privacy of their own room it should be fine.  I decided that as long as there weren&#39;t any loud alarming noises there shouldn&#39;t be any big deal.<br/>

I suspect that your encouragement for her to sleep in her own room (even if<br/>
done positively) has had a backlash effect of her needing reassurance.  Our<br/>
&quot;family bed&quot; transition was more gradual for most of our children.  They<br/>
went from our bed (king sized, luckily!) to a twin bed pushed up next to<br/>
ours to a pallet on the floor and THEN to their own rooms.  All was done out<br/>
of necessity as another baby arrived and needed the space closest to Mom&#39;s<br/>
breast.  We did &quot;encourage&quot; but still left the decision up to them.  My<br/>
youngest was actually *eager* to move into her big sister&#39;s bed and there<br/>
was no gradual transition.  She just told us one day she was ready to move<br/>
to her sister&#39;s bed and that was that.  Anyway--I don&#39;t know that it would<br/>
help with your sex life immediately, but it might make for a smoother<br/>
transition if you eased up with the encouragement for her own bed/room and<br/>
tried another in-your-room arrangement for a while.<br/>

&gt; I think your last statement hit the nail on the head!!! &quot;Just hope your<br/>
libido doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)&quot; That is what I am thinking<br/>
about!! with her growing up what seems like overnight, that is another<br/>
reason, I myself have a hard time with her being in her own bead. I know the<br/>
day will all to soon come, when we will be wishing she still wanted to sleep<br/>
with us. :o) I must have put things completely wrong! I pretty much was<br/>
looking for what other parents have done that has worked to keep things<br/>
&quot;going&quot; ;o] And I think the waiting until she goes to sleep in our bed is a<br/>
good idea! The only down side, is that she can usually outlast my husband<br/>
and I. But maybe we can outlast her on the weekends! Maybe we can set the<br/>
alarm clock for sometime in the middle of the night. That&#39;s an idea! I think<br/>
I do need to work on the whole &quot;outside the box&quot; thing.<br/>

&gt;   Hi Candy,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   In my book 4 is almost newborn! We have always had a family bed. I might<br/>
also add that they all breast fed until they were around 5.  My partner and<br/>
I were together for almost 9 years before we had any kids so sex where ever<br/>
and when ever wasn&#39;t an issue. Our kids are now 18, 12 and 7. The 18 year<br/>
old slept in our family bed or his bed with dad or little brother or little<br/>
brothers bed etc...until he was 13 or 14. He never sleeps with any of us<br/>
anymore :~( and we miss him.<br/>
&gt;   We have a king size with a single on the side for the four of us who are<br/>
left. Our 12 year old is with us unless he stays out at a friends or has<br/>
friends sleep over. Our baby, who&#39;s 7 already, is still always with us. They<br/>
all have a bedroom complete with a bed and at times, if someone is sick,<br/>
can&#39;t sleep, or wants to have sex, we play musical beds and sleep where ever<br/>
we&#39;re most comfy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   My oldest was extremely clingy and never slept out, except for at my<br/>
moms, until he was well into his teens. I admit I was worried and had many<br/>
well meaning people warning me, when he refused to attend sleep overs or<br/>
even large parties with friends, and we pushed him at times always with<br/>
negative results. Anyway, to make a long story short, he just got back from<br/>
a 2 week road trip to Key Largo with his old girl friend and we spent the<br/>
time cleaning and decorating his room to keep our loneliness at bay :~).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   These years of family living have been the best years of my life and I&#39;m<br/>
not looking forward to an empty bed and a clean house. Soon I&#39;ll be looking<br/>
for a support group for people who didn&#39;t send their kids to their rooms or<br/>
to school and can&#39;t live with the peace and quiet. Or maybe we&#39;ll open our<br/>
doors to some wayward teens or become foster parents or something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Enjoy your little one and don&#39;t be afraid of being too close. These are<br/>
your years together, make the most of it, it will be over before ya know<br/>
it!!!! You can have sex anywhere but in bed, so what. Just hope your libido<br/>
doesn&#39;t disappear when she does:~)<br/>

&gt;     I am so glad I found this group!!! My husband and I agonize over this<br/>
very thing. Our daughter is 4 and an only child.  If she can&#39;t sleep with<br/>
us, she cries,  and after listening to sobbing for a while, it seems to<br/>
really put a damper on the mood. :o) We have tried doing a schedule of one<br/>
night in our bed, and one night in her&#39;s, but I have to admit that I am so<br/>
used to her sleeping with us, that if she does not wind up in our bed, I<br/>
can&#39;t sleep, I keep checking on her because it is so unusual!! I know it is<br/>
important not completely neglect your marriage, but I think my daughter&#39;s<br/>
need to sleep with us has actually gotten worse the last 6 months instead of<br/>
better.  I always thought as she got older, her need for independence would<br/>
increase, and she would enjoy her room. We have even tried completely<br/>
remodeling her room to make it what she likes. We got her involved in<br/>
choosing the theme, colors, furniture, ect. we got her a bed that looks like<br/>
a house, even went out and found a pink TV to match everything! She does<br/>
love her room, but not enough to sleep in it.We are somewhat at a loss of<br/>
what to do next! She really does not take naps very often any more, and it<br/>
just breaks my heart to tell her she can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on<br/>
what has worked? I just joined the group yesterday, so I may have missed<br/>
earlier discussions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365700345">After everyone&#39;s comments yesterday, I tried the &quot;outside the box&quot; thinking. I would not give up having my daughter sleep with us for anything, that was not my point at all. It was not even really about just sex. I am just trying to keep balance. I would not want to neglect either relationship. Maybe it is of more issue to me than it used to be because my parents were married 30+ years, and are now in the middle of a divorce. I guess what I was wanting was more just some time to talk, if it were purely a sex thing, we could figure that out. Although you all did have some good ideas!  :oP At the same time, I don&#39;t want Courtney to feel like we are excluding her in any way. I can&#39;t sleep when she isn&#39;t with us in bed. My point was more trying to make some time just to talk and cuddle a little.  <br/>
Anyways, I tried something new last night!! We all got ready for bed, and then we let Courtney pick out one of her Veggie Tales movies (about a half hour) and put that on for her to watch. My husband and I went to our room and just talked about what happened that day, what we needed to do the next day, ect.  It was also nice just to have a few minutes to catch up and have some quiet time. When her movie was over, she turned off her TV, and packed up her blankie, and teddy bear and came into bed with us. <br/>
I would have to say that is just what I was looking for! Justin and I both focus so much on Courtney, that is was nice to just talk for a few minutes about us! Thanks for some of your ideas,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499419848"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We are somewhat at a loss of what to do next! She really does not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>take naps very often any more, and it just breaks my heart to tell her she<br/>
can&#39;t sleep with us. Any suggestions on what has worked? I just joined the<br/>
group yesterday, so I may have missed earlier discussions.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s extremely important for the parents, if they require it, to<br/>
have private time w/out the kids. I know every marriage is different, but<br/>
it&#39;s no good to sacrifice the relationship w/each other for the sake of<br/>
always meeting the &quot;needs&quot; of the kids. Parents need<br/>
to keep that bond strong so that they can be there for the kids in the<br/>
long run. I know too many people who have split up under the strains of<br/>
taking care of the kids only and not each other. (of course, I also live<br/>
in NYC which is probably divorce central so my sample population is<br/>
probably skewed!).<br/>
<br/>
Our son slept w/us exclusively until he was almost five. Then he started<br/>
to snore something awful, and my insomnia got really bad for a few weeks<br/>
on top of it, and I had to think of something that would satisfy my need<br/>
for sleep and his need for security. We got him a bunk bed and made a big<br/>
deal about how special it was. It became a play area as well as a fun<br/>
place to sleep, bc we draped a blanket over it and he started calling it<br/>
his &quot;clubhouse.&quot; It was a smooth transition, mostly bc he<br/>
knew he could always get in bed w/us whenever he wanted to, if he awoke in<br/>
the middle of the night. Sometimes, when I tuck him in, he asks me if I<br/>
will bring him in later. I always say yes, and then hang out w/my husband<br/>
for a couple of hours. Round about midnight, when I&#39;m ready to turn in, I<br/>
go get him and we all get into bed together. It&#39;s worked prety well for<br/>
us, and most nights he&#39;s happy to sleep alone, mostly bc he knows he can<br/>
always come in if he wants company. The thing that&#39;s really helped is<br/>
letting him listen to books on tape or music while he drops off to sleep.<br/>
He&#39;s listened to everything from Miles Davis, Micheal Jackson, Barney<br/>
music, Roald Dahl novels, Arthur chapter books, etc.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988326584">How does Dr. Laura irritate me?<br/>
Let me count the ways . . . <br/>
1.  Her belief that gays are inferior and should be cured. <br/>
      August 9, 1999 radio show<br/>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.horizonsfoundation.org/drlaura.htm">http://www.horizonsfoundation.org/drlaura.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
2.  Her refusal to acknowledge legally recognized religious groups <br/>
outside of the Judeo-Christian faith.<br/>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.magickalcauldron.com/laura.html">http://www.magickalcauldron.com/laura.html</a><br/>
<br/>
3.  Her doctorate is NOT in Psychology yet she allows that impression <br/>
to linger.<br/>
      See link in #1<br/>
<br/>
4.  Hypocrisy: <br/>
      {Ironically, in the Sept. 2000 edition of her Dr. Laura <br/>
Perspective magazine, Laura endorses the same strategies GLAAD <br/>
employed. In the second part of her &quot;Kids & Sex&quot; article, Laura <br/>
says: &quot;Write to the source of any offensive content and tell them of <br/>
your concerns. Write that not only will you stop watching the program <br/>
or reading the publication because of the stories or advertisements, <br/>
but you will also go out of your way not to purchase the sponsors&#39; <br/>
products and will encourage others to avoid them as well&quot; [p. 7]. <br/>
This is exactly the kind of campaign GLAAD orchestrated. But when <br/>
GLAAD contacts advertisers, it&#39;s intimidation and threats. When Laura <br/>
does it, it&#39;s &quot;improving your village.&quot;}<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.glaad.org/org/publications/documents/index.html?record=2742">http://www.glaad.org/org/publications/documents/index.html?record=2742</a><br/>
     <br/>
5.  Her idea that the ALA (that&#39;s the American Library Association) <br/>
is evil and that Go Ask Alice, a web site they promote and whichis <br/>
hosted by Columbia University, promotes immorality. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/index.html">http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/index.html</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/05/27/dr_laura/index.html">http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/05/27/dr_laura/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
6.  She is anti-Planned Parenthood<br/>
  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.drlaura.com/letters/index.html?mode=view&tile=1&id=1837">http://www.drlaura.com/letters/index.html?mode=view&tile=1&id=1837</a><br/>
<br/>
7.  I&#39;m tired of looking at this now!  I get the feeling she is anti-<br/>
feminist but haven&#39;t found a specific link for that.  I also think <br/>
her hypocrisy runs deep in more ways than I have above.<br/>
<br/>
You may consider her a child advocate but her comments about the &quot;Go <br/>
Ask Alice&quot; sight show that she is somewhat less than informed IMHO.<br/>
