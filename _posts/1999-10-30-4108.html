HOME EDUCATION IN SPAIN: ONE FAMILY&#39;S TRAVAILS<br/>
<br/>
by Dr. Pat Montgomery<br/>
The Leraning Edge, Vol. 17, No. 1, Oct/Nov 1999<br/>
Clonlara School<br/>
1289 Jewett St. Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This story is a factual account of a family living in Almeria, Spain:<br/>
Gabriel Garcia Rodriguez, Dolores (Lola) Ruiz Cruz, their seven year old<br/>
son, Gabriel Garcia Ruiz, and his two siblings, not yet of school age. <br/>
They have been enrolled in Clonlara School for the past two years.<br/>
<br/>
Lola explained to us her reasons for choosing to home educate: &quot;We think<br/>
that these are the most important years in the life of a human being, from<br/>
birth until sixteen.  We want to give them all our support and see the<br/>
family growing together, learning together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The parents had attended a gathering in Madrid where they became acquainted<br/>
with John Holt&#39;s work.  Here was a kindred spirit whose writings resonated<br/>
in their hearts and minds.  They had found the course that they would take<br/>
- parents as teachers, learners together.<br/>
<br/>
Home education is neither legal nor illegal in Spain; local school<br/>
authorities decide each case.  In the case of this family, the response of<br/>
authorities was to file suit aganst them in court.  The paretns had tried<br/>
to telephone both the Inspector of Schools and the local authorities, but<br/>
their calls were never returned. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Delegate hasn&#39;t returned calls; the Inspector hasn&#39;t returned calls. <br/>
We want them to know our position,&quot; states a quote from Lola in La Voz de<br/>
Almeria, September 18, 1999.<br/>
<br/>
For an entire week this September, the newspaper, La Voz de Almeria,<br/>
published a series of articles about the family&#39;s home schooling.  The<br/>
situation was thoroughly examined from every possible angle-the family&#39;s<br/>
reasons for their choice, the court proceedings, the localauthorities&#39;<br/>
response, and the actions of the State Inspector.<br/>
<br/>
The local school principal reported that she &quot;did her dut by informing the<br/>
State School Inspector&quot; as soon as she learned of the family&#39;s home<br/>
educating.<br/>
<br/>
The headlines and subtitles pretty much tell the tale:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;GABRIEL LIVES 6000 KILOMETERS FROM THE SCHOOL.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Ministry of Education admits that this is an atypical situation but<br/>
defends compulsory education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One photo of Gabriel playing in his yard was captioned, &quot;The garden and the<br/>
open area that surround the hous, together with the plaza and the park of<br/>
the town, are the scenarios for the child&#39;s games.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The tribunal disagrees about the higher riight of parents regarding the<br/>
schooling of their children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;Our Child is a Happy Child. Gabriel Eats when he wants to.  Neither<br/>
before nor after. Textbooks bore him,&#39; says his mother.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No child should be deprived of the companionship of other children,&quot;<br/>
opines the Delegate of Education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was, also, a grave misunderstanding about the use of the Internet. <br/>
Lola maintains regular communication with her Clonlara-assigned contact<br/>
teacher via email over the Internet.  In early articles, the newspaper<br/>
reporter&#39;s observations were misconstrued by school officials who got the<br/>
impression that Gabriel was being schooled over the Internet.  This caused<br/>
a ruckus, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education authorities are looking for legal ways to stop a young boy of<br/>
eigght years old from studying only over the Internet,&quot; blares one<br/>
headline.  The article under it states that Gabriel spends 10 hours each<br/>
day laboring over the keyboard.  Lola is then called upon to make the<br/>
correction that it is she herself who uses the Internet (but not for 10<br/>
hours a day).  Gabriel does not even know the keyboard yet and he shows<br/>
absolutely no interest in using it.  A second headline shouts: &quot;What they<br/>
have said about this child spending ten hours connected on the Internet is<br/>
totally false.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
De`ja vu all over again?<br/>
<br/>
The rights of parents to determine the educational choice for their<br/>
children, the underlying distrust of parents to determine the educational<br/>
choice for their children, the underlying distrust of parents by school<br/>
authorities to choose wisely, and the threat that home education makes to<br/>
conventional schooling are all part of the mix.  The scene has been played<br/>
out in homes and towns and cities all over the United States in the last 25<br/>
or so years; it has run its course through school districts and courtrooms<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it has reached fever pitch in Spain.  Oh, there have been home<br/>
schoolers in that country for years, but they operated &quot;underground.&quot; This<br/>
family has been forced into the public spotlight, a position that curbs<br/>
their freedom to educate in peace, without undue interference.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We never thought that is would cause so much dust to blow up,&quot; states Lola<br/>
in La Voz.  Hear! Hear!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps now that the issue is public, the local and state school<br/>
authorities and the edictor of La Voz de Almeria may benefit by hearing the<br/>
true stories of success from home educators in America.  You can share the<br/>
good news, as you know it, with them.  You can help allleviate the distrust<br/>
and the fear of the authoriiteis.  You can lend support to the Ruiz Cruz<br/>
family.<br/>
