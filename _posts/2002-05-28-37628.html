&lt;&lt; The other two finally got tired of <br/>
it and told her to stop cheating. She said, and I quote exactly: &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
blame me, I have ADD and that means I&#39;m special needs and I can&#39;t help what I <br/>
do.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
THERE IT IS.<br/>
<br/>
Makes me shudder.<br/>
<br/>
What the hell is wrong with teachers and parents and school?  (Oh, never <br/>
mind.  Ignore that question entirely.)<br/>
<br/>
IF one of my kids has a personality or mental quirk which could make it hard <br/>
for him to interact with other people (hey wait--it&#39;s not &quot;if,&quot; as they do <br/>
have a few little things) then I see my duty to help them find ways to <br/>
minimize their problems, to interact without that being detrimental.  <br/>
<br/>
I would never EVER tell my kids &quot;Well, just ignore people who think you&#39;re <br/>
rude.  They don&#39;t know your excellent biological or psychological reasons for <br/>
being rude.  They don&#39;t have your disabilities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s easy for one child to be courteous and safe in play situations and <br/>
more difficult for another child to do the same, then there it is.  It&#39;s <br/>
going to be more difficult for that one, but it&#39;s STILL expected and required <br/>
to be courteous and safe when playing with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents are worried that their kids might not have enough math skills or <br/>
report-writing experience to get jobs, and they might do better to see if <br/>
they have enough social skill to pass an interview and be respected by <br/>
co-workers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, here goes! I agree with you in that children (everyone) shouldn&#39;t use <br/>
any hindrance (mental, physical, or perceived) as an excuse for inappropriate <br/>
behavior, cheating, not doing something correctly etc. But do you &quot;help them <br/>
find ways to minimize their problems...&quot; or do you show them different routes <br/>
of expression? If one of my kids had a disability I wouldn&#39;t want to minimize <br/>
it, instead I would help them find more creative ways to live with it. I <br/>
guess my issue is only with the word minimize, and maybe you meant this all <br/>
along. :o)<br/>

If one is short tempered, he needs tricks to control his temper.  And that <br/>
will be a different route of expression.   And it will minimize his problem, <br/>
which is the danger of his short temper affecting his friendships, <br/>
reputation, legal standing, whatever.<br/>

It&#39;s minimizing the negative effect the problem could have on their <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131543271">I really feel the need to add my .02 worth on the<br/>
subject of using ADD/other issues as &quot;excuses&quot; for<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
When I was well into my 30s, a psychologist friend of<br/>
mine suspected I had ADD, and suggested that she test<br/>
me. Well, according to the test, I do have ADD. And,<br/>
while I believe that my son exhibits very many of the<br/>
characteristics, I don&#39;t feel it necessary to have him<br/>
tested, because I don&#39;t necessarily see it as an<br/>
impediment. And I definitely don&#39;t see it as an excuse<br/>
for bad behavior.<br/>
<br/>
However -- and this is a big however -- it was<br/>
enlightening for me to learn about some of the traits<br/>
common to ADD that have had an impact in my life. And<br/>
awareness has helped me help my son learn to minimize<br/>
(I definitely agree with Sandra that minimize is the<br/>
right word here) the impact that a given trait (or<br/>
limitation -- call it what you will) has on him and<br/>
his life.<br/>
<br/>
I think that we (society) are making a huge mistake by<br/>
letting children use ADD as a &quot;get out of jail free&quot;<br/>
card as an excuse for bad behavior. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion -- and I certainly am no expert except<br/>
in my knowledge of myself and my children -- having<br/>
ADD just means you may process information and<br/>
situations differently than some other people. But<br/>
then, introverts process information differently than<br/>
extroverts. That doesn&#39;t make introversion or<br/>
extroversion a handicap.<br/>
<br/>
Helping our children understand themselves, how they<br/>
view and interact with the world, and how to maximize<br/>
their talents and minimize, or work around, their<br/>
limitations IS one of our responsibilities as parents.<br/>
In my mind, this is the same as &quot;finding more creative<br/>
ways to live with it&quot;, as Nancy stated. <br/>
<br/>
But then, that&#39;s not unique to parents with children<br/>
who have been diagnosed with ADD. Everyone has<br/>
strengths and limitations. Some limitations will<br/>
always be part of us, and although we may develop ways<br/>
to cope with them, some talents or abilities will<br/>
never be natural or easy to us. To me, that&#39;s the<br/>
beautiful thing about unschooling. My son could not<br/>
cope with a &quot;learning&quot; situation in which he had to<br/>
sit at a desk facing forward for several hours a day<br/>
and pay perfect attention to a person at the front of<br/>
the room imparting information. <br/>
<br/>
Interaction with other people is just too important to<br/>
him. That&#39;s how he learns best, by bouncing ideas off<br/>
of someone else, by sharing (verbally) what he&#39;s<br/>
learning, by discussing things he finds interesting.<br/>
So by choosing unschooling, I believe I am helping him<br/>
capitalize on his strengths and minimize the impact of<br/>
his limitations.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
But if I&#39;m wrong, it&#39;s not my fault, because I have<br/>
ADD. HA! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>sounds like you have it right to me! My daughter shows signs of the same <br/>
&quot;disorder&quot;, but I would rather call it a difference, not a disability. <br/>
Amazingly enough, I share some but not all of those traits. And I was a <br/>
wonderful performing teacher&#39;s pet student until junior high. I always <br/>
thought it was hormones, puberty, becoming more interested in boys than <br/>
studies, but unschooling is showing me other possibilities about what was <br/>
wrong with my &quot;education&quot; and why i stopped &quot;succeeding&quot;. Anyhoo, I found a <br/>
website sometime ago, and wanted to share it with you........<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/3337/add.html&quot;">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/3337/add.html&quot;</a>&gt;ADD&lt;/A&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/3337/add.html">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Meadows/3337/add.html</a><br/>
<br/>
this is a site devoted to adult ADD types. I found it when searching how to <br/>
get my Messy, unorganized life together. I then found flylady.net, way back <br/>
before she is as popular as she is now with her own website, book, and a <br/>
hundred thousand subscribers to her list. It helped me find great coping <br/>
methods, getting on good routines, breaking things down into manageable <br/>
pieces, and getting everything running much smoother. A few years back, I <br/>
thought I couldn&#39;t even consider homeschooling, I was too undisciplined and <br/>
unorganized. BIG changes followed and we do just fine now :0) HTH, i haven&#39;t <br/>
visited that site in a while, i hope it still offers coping strategies and <br/>
not just lame excuses! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918334128">Paula Harper-Christensen did a presentation  on learning styles at the<br/>
HSC Sacramento conference last year (or the year before).  She said that<br/>
making a kinesthetic learner sit still to learn is child abuse.  I<br/>
agree!<br/>
<br/>
I would extend that and say it&#39;s just as unreasonable as expecting a<br/>
visual learner to learn with his eyes covered or an auditory learner to<br/>
learn with his ears covered.<br/>
