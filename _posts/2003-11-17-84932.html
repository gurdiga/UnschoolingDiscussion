 </span></blockquote>Her name is Stacia (a, not e) Tauscher.<br/>
Other than that, I couldn&#39;t find her - unless she&#39;s the Canadian woman who <br/>
was &#39;giving her husband the &#39;bumps&#39;&#39; in bed on 9/11.  (From a <br/>
where-were-you-when website.)<br/>
<br/>
The quote is everywhere it seems, but nothing more on her.<br/>
Maybe someone else is more talented than I at finding out about folks.<br/>
