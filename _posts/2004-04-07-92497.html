<div id="ygrps-yiv-1942329543">&quot;I feel bummed when I think about the school messing with schedules <br/>
again.<br/>
Oh well, August is a long time off so perhaps their minds will <br/>
collectively<br/>
change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps find a way to meet the desire, without going full school.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra has been very interested in going to school and I thought I <br/>
was finally going to have to start looking around this year. But an <br/>
alternative minded friend of mine, is wanting to offer some fun <br/>
classes to homeschoolers and when Sierra figured out that school <br/>
meant being gone all day, five days a week, but Miss Elizabeth&#39;s <br/>
class would be once a week...well, that sealed the deal.<br/>
She desires some structured learning, but she is also a product of a <br/>
free life, so I&#39;m pretty sure school would be harder for her <br/>
independent nature than she thinks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886947736">&quot;But if I do not trust my kids to make the &quot;correct for them&quot; choices <br/>
about<br/>
their education....then I am certainly no unschooler. I feel that I <br/>
must<br/>
walk the walk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
My children are choosing their education/learning every day. I am not <br/>
a closed door, but an avenue by which they can explore the entire <br/>
world, even shark infested waters and freeways if necessary. I&#39;d find <br/>
a way for them to do it safely.<br/>
My Dad has gone diving in shark infested waters, and loved every <br/>
minute of it. And I bet I could find a freeway that was closed for <br/>
construction that we could explore.:)<br/>
I know the original issue was safety, and of course we all keep our <br/>
children from life/death dangers until they are able to understand <br/>
those dangers and keep themselves safe. <br/>
School is just another part of the world, and a child that knows they <br/>
have free choice is not going to have the damage that a coerced child <br/>
would.<br/>
If I say I trust my child to make decisions about their lives, but I <br/>
won&#39;t allow them to go to school, then I&#39;m doing the exact thing to <br/>
them that school does. Forcing. Not allowing choice.<br/>
That&#39;s not in line with unschooling philosophies in my opinion.<br/>
