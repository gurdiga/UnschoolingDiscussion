 </span></blockquote>The post wasn&#39;t about censoring.<br/>
<br/>
It was about teachers and parents often thinking that reading is SO important <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t matter WHAT the kid is reading, they&#39;ll still be thrilled <br/>
just because they kid is reading, but they often do NOT feel that way about <br/>
other ways of learning. <br/>
<br/>
People get LOTS of information by &quot;watching&quot; and &quot;listening&quot; - but parents <br/>
and teachers put &quot;learning through reading&quot; on such a higher level that they <br/>
are happy their kids will read, no matter what they read -- but they don&#39;t <br/>
apply that same way of thinking to movies, tv, and music. <br/>
<br/>
But - maybe you wanted to move on to a new topic - that of censoring? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it just kind of morphed in my head, but yes, the censorship <br/>
thing in a big one for me.  I know lots of parents who say they let <br/>
their kids make all their own decisions but then go on to censor their <br/>
book, TV and movie choices.<br/>
