In LLL, the point of meeting women where they&#39;re at and encouraging them to<br/>
&quot;take what they can use and leave the rest&quot; is the hopes that they will move<br/>
more in the direction of LLL Philosophy. Or, if they don&#39;t move far in that<br/>
direction, they will at least support the organization and not bad-mouth it<br/>
to their friends! Ideally, we don&#39;t soften message, but we do tell it in a<br/>
kind way and emphasize that people &quot;have to do what&#39;s best for their own<br/>
families.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a ton of email lists, and this one doesn&#39;t seem all that harsh,<br/>
frankly, particularly on a harshness continuum on parenting subjects --<br/>
people get nasty about different child-rearing choices. Many of those who<br/>
post here are direct, but not nasty. I feel like I learn something, even<br/>
though I don&#39;t post myself.<br/>
<br/>
But not everyone will feel comfortable -- I guess I don&#39;t see a problem with<br/>
that. <br/>

peaceful and free to learn, reaching moms is the necessary step in<br/>
that direction.<br/>
<br/>
I think this list does a great job, for the most part. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
criticizing the list but explaining why some people are reticent to<br/>
stay and learn.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See, that makes a lot of sense to me. I&#39;m not sure why that would be<br/>
different for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if we are talking about how to help our kids with what they<br/>
need, we don&#39;t just demand that they &quot;get it&quot; (whatever &quot;it&quot; is), but<br/>
go to great lengths to help them, to understand them, to see them<br/>
through the frustrating, scary parts.<br/>
<br/>
This list has been that for me. But not everyone starts with as much<br/>
commitment to the idea of unschooling as I had at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Many of those who<br/>

Unschooling is wilder and broader and we&#39;re not the sole source for people  <br/>
who want discussions.<br/>

bottle fed, making fun of them in sarcastic ways. She said she was <br/>
never so uncomfortable in her life and couldn&#39;t wait to get away. She <br/>
went there fully intending to breastfeed and just thought it might be <br/>
good to get some support because many of her friends AND her husband&#39;s <br/>
relatives (mil, especially) were discouraging her from breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
She breastfed anyway, although not as long as she might have with more <br/>
support for long-term breastfeeding. And I never went to LLL, but read <br/>
&quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot; and had my sisters and mother as <br/>
role models and support.<br/>

Plus, the actual health and safety of newborn babies is not so much at  <br/>
stake.  LLL has big-lawsuit type liability if their methods can be proven  to cause <br/>
the death of a child.  (Which would never happen, but this  is a crazy <br/>
world.)  <br/>
 <br/>
Since everyone here is acting as a free-agent and there is no organization,  <br/>
etc., we have no liability if someone neglects their child in the name of  <br/>
unschooling and they run out the in the street and get hit by a car.  <br/>
 <br/>
I certainly prefer it that way.<br/>

 La Leche League International does NOT tell leaders to bash formula feeding mothers.<br/>
<br/>
When I was involved in La Leche League, we made it a point to avoid saying negative things about bottle-feeding.  Our focus was on promoting the positive aspects of breastfeeding and breastmilk and helping mothers to gain confidence in knowing their own baby rather than relying on &quot;experts&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To criticize LLL because of a bad impression from one group is not fair.<br/>

All she did was list the reasons her sister gave for not going to the local  <br/>
group.  She didn&#39;t bash the entire organization.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Fair&quot; is an interesting concept in that way too.<br/>
Some people had a VW they HATED and so they never want another  volkswagen.  <br/>
Is that fair?<br/>
 <br/>
If someone was raped by a marine in uniform and hates all marines  <br/>
thereafter, is that fair?<br/>
 <br/>
If a German shepherd bites a nine year old in the butt (ahem... it can  <br/>
happen) and she&#39;s wary of German shepherds from then on is that fair?<br/>
 <br/>
When someone badmouths a restaurant, I ask if they don&#39;t think it might&#39;ve  <br/>
just been the particular waiter and cook they had that day.  Other shifts,  <br/>
other days might easily be much better.  <br/>
 <br/>
Same with schools and teachers.  <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Fair&quot; isn&#39;t a fair measure.<br/>
