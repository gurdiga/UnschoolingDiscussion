 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s question that&#39;s come up around here this weekend.  I&#39;ve just come<br/>
back from being on three days holiday with just my son, and it came to my<br/>
attention that Tim doesn&#39;t generally talk to anyone these days, even if<br/>
they&#39;ve actually directed the question to him.  He&#39;ll choose food before the<br/>
waitperson comes and never look at them.  I order.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ok with that; it&#39;s not like he can&#39;t talk; at home he hardly stops!  But<br/>
at least one person commented on it, and I mentioned it to my husband, too,<br/>
and though we&#39;d never really given it any thought, he thought it&#39;s probaby<br/>
true that Tim talks to very few people.<br/>
<br/>
So, when did your kids start regularly ordering meals for themselves,<br/>
responding to waitpeople, cashiers, or people at social gatherings who<br/>
polietely say something to them?  I&#39;m just curious.  And has anyone else had<br/>
the experience that their child used to talk quite a lot and now doesn&#39;t?<br/>

talker, and has always pretty much ordered for himself and asked for refills <br/>
etc.  My youngest has only started doing this recently.  He was a little shy <br/>
at first.  But I never pushed either of them.  Never made them talk to people <br/>
they didn&#39;t talk to on their own etc.  I think every child is different.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Roxana talked to anybody and everybody when she was little. She stopped <br/>
talking to strangers at about 7 - although she&#39;d warm up fairly quickly <br/>
with new people we actually knew - just not random unknown people like <br/>
waiters, etc. She only started ordering for herself in restaurants a <br/>
year ago -at 14 - before that she was self-conscious and afraid they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t understand her or something and always got somebody else to <br/>
order for her. Rox is fine - perfectly able to make small talk with <br/>
strangers now. Goes to restaurants on her own with her friends and <br/>
handles it fine. My other kids always talked to strangers comfortably - <br/>
sometimes TOO comfortably &lt;g&gt; - and always order for themselves.<br/>

recently started &quot;coming out&quot; and talking to &quot;strangers&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan, on the other hand, is a regular walkie-talkie.<br/>

Ten or twelve, I think.  Marty at 14 is still shy sometimes to do the talking <br/>
when we go in somewhere.  We went to a police substation last week to turn in <br/>
his application for the Junior Police Academy.  Walking in, I asked if he <br/>
wanted to do the talking or should I.  He asked me to.  I reminded him that <br/>
if he did meet the person in charge of that, it was &quot;Lieutenant Sandoval.&quot;  <br/>
He nodded.  She wasn&#39;t there anyway.  I did the talking.  <br/>
<br/>
I figure it&#39;s the same as La Leche League said about holding kids&#39; hands and <br/>
letting them sit in your lap.  They&#39;ll only need it as long as they need it, <br/>
and then they&#39;ll walk away willingly on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
It has to be another phase of that.  If I press them to do it before they&#39;re <br/>
really comfortable, it will likely cause more problem than solution.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dd (now 10) was an early talker and spoke in complete sentences very<br/>
young. She never had a problem speaking with adults as she was<br/>
surrounded <br/>
by them every day! She has also placed her own order to wait people for<br/>
maybe 6? years. Although sometimes I have gotten her order and told the<br/>
waitperson myself. I believe this started when ds came along. He did not<br/>
talk until almost 3 years old and so I would order for everyone<br/>
sometimes and sometimes dd would do it herself. Recently I have noticed<br/>
that she doesn&#39;t talk as much, either. I have attributed it to changing<br/>
interests, more talking with friends recently and the fact that now ds<br/>
(4) is a real chatter box who will speak at length with anyone he<br/>
fancies. (If they stick around that long!) She sometimes just seems a<br/>
little embarrassed with adults she doesn&#39;t know lately, but if they take<br/>
the time and really act like <br/>
they care you know (not just fries or fruit with that) then she will <br/>
engage with them.<br/>
