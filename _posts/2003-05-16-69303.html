I had an idea for the conference, I am not sure if it is completely <br/>
useless as I am new to all this!  I noticed alot of posts about Dads <br/>
and trying to involve them or help them better understand <br/>
unschooling.  Maybe you already have something and I missed it on <br/>
your site: a seminar, question-answer type event just for Dads.  I <br/>
know I do the research and present info to dh.  I KNOW I do not <br/>
present it in nearly as eloquent or to the point way that experienced <br/>
unschoolers do.  Maybe Dads would enjoy and be more comfortable being <br/>
able to discuss with an expert and eachother without us moms--who <br/>
usually have all the answers ;).  Anyway, it is just a thought to <br/>
throw out there for those of us who are trying to get dh to <br/>
understand better.<br/>

Thanks for your suggestion. (And your confirmation will be in your e-mailbox <br/>
soon!)<br/>
<br/>
Last year we had a &quot;Reluctant Dads, Reluctant Husabands&quot; presentation. <br/>
Unfortunately (or fortunately???), it was attended by many women. Ben thought <br/>
that it was a little difficult for the dads to &quot;open up&quot; because they kept <br/>
being cut off by the women! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s requested some time to approach JUST the dads and let them air concerns <br/>
and questions. I&#39;m not sure *when* this will be, but Ben wants to get the <br/>
husbands/dads alone! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll happen, I just haven&#39;t &quot;scheduled&quot; it. Let your husband know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171840522">I&#39;m sorry, my sister is visiting and I don&#39;t have the time to devote to<br/>
figuring out the genesis of who said what to whom and why.<br/>
<br/>
Reading backwards I am seeing words that didn&#39;t help clarify anything. But<br/>
I&#39;m also reading supreme frustration that has brought people to this point.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to make your point, which seems to be causing great<br/>
misunderstanding, try to figure out what the other person is trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
And Glena, I&#39;m sorry I have to single you out. There are undoubtedly other<br/>
factors involved in this particular thread, but this is the second current<br/>
thread that has gotten testy because you cannot write what you mean. It is<br/>
*your* responsiblity to translate your thoughts into words.  Regardless of<br/>
how clear you think you are, if a half dozen people say they&#39;re reading<br/>
something different than what you mean then it&#39;s *your* responsibility to<br/>
figure out how to say what you mean *not* berate them for misunderstanding<br/>
your thoughts. It is *not* the reader&#39;s responsiblity to learn how to pull<br/>
your meaning out of words that are saying something different than you mean.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was NOT about the post regarding what someone did not understand, being <br/>
called a &quot;friggin idiot&quot; was in response to saying that the world does not <br/>
stop at our doorstep and everyone can help in overcoming injustices in the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently someone thought I meant THEY didn&#39;t do enough.  I said &quot;But if we <br/>
all sit happy fat and sassy in our own private unschooling worlds it&#39;s sure <br/>
to continue and to more than likely become more rampant&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It had NOTHING to do with a post being misunderstood or not.  That was a <br/>
completely different thread.<br/>
<br/>
As for this &quot;clarity&quot; issues, I&#39;ve thought and thought about it, and it&#39;s NOT <br/>
that I didn&#39;t write what I wanted and what was truthful, it&#39;s that others <br/>
PERCEIVE it differently than it was written, some LOOK to find something they <br/>
can twist or turn to suit them.  I&#39;ve decided that&#39;s fine.<br/>
I&#39;m no longer going to try to clarify anything to so that anyone gets a <br/>
better understanding of what was meant by the post.  It doesn&#39;t really matter <br/>
does it?  Well, sometimes it does but it&#39;s not worth the effort because no <br/>
matter what some people are going to say that read something different, it <br/>
meant something different to them, that&#39;s the nature of life.  Things mean <br/>
different things to different people.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Friggin idiot&quot; means friggin idiot and it wasn&#39;t in regard to anything but <br/>
someone being angry at me, not over any misunderstanding of a post or an <br/>
&quot;explanation&quot; of one.  But in direct response to a post about injustice in <br/>
the world.<br/>

That is GREAT to hear and I know it makes a big difference.  My dh is <br/>
very supportive and trusts the research I have done but I would love <br/>
for him to hear it from the horses mouth..LOL!  It makes a big <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s great, Pam. I think it&#39;s terrific when the guys are passionate<br/>
advocates about these kinds of things. My DH was a SAHD with our son for 2<br/>
years, and he used to talk to moms about breastfeeding and such in the<br/>
supermarket checkout lines (while carrying our son in the sling), so he&#39;s a<br/>
long-time advocate of the way we parent. Now he talks about unschooling in<br/>
the same passionate way and this is one of the things I love about him.<br/>
We&#39;re also fortunate in that our homeschool group has a ton of committed<br/>
dads. Almost every event has dads at it, whether it&#39;s park day or gymnastics<br/>
or a camping or beach trip. Often the dads just come when they can--at park<br/>
day for instance, there will be dads that show up on their lunch hour to<br/>
spend the hour with their kids, and then dads who show up at 3 or 4 when<br/>
they get off of work. Many of the families in our group do some kind of<br/>
flexible work thing, whether the dad works 4 ten hour days a week or they<br/>
run their own business or work from home, or the parents split shift or<br/>
whatever, and I think it is always beneficial to have dads be an integral<br/>
part of the group.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. And I&#39;m saying this gently. Sometimes one or two people will misread<br/>
something while many people get what was intended. That means the misreaders<br/>
need to reread. Or the writer, if the writer feels it&#39;s an important enough<br/>
point for them to get, can take the time to rewrite it another way to help<br/>
them understand.<br/>
<br/>
If *many* people perceive something different than what you mean to say they<br/>
are not at fault. You *can&#39;t* control how people interpret what you&#39;ve<br/>
written. You *can* control what you write, though.<br/>
<br/>
To help the list help people, and so it doesn&#39;t fill up periodically with<br/>
you pointing out that the words you used don&#39;t say what they are clearly<br/>
saying to others, you really really need to figure out why people are<br/>
perceiving something different than what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
It would help the list and yourself a *lot* if you could figure out why<br/>
people are perceiving &quot;Maybe tomorrow&quot; as a lie and a bad technique in<br/>
principle. And how the discussion you also had with your daughter doesn&#39;t<br/>
change the lie or the bad technique.<br/>
<br/>
*Please* don&#39;t try to explain it to me. *Please* try to figure out why<br/>
people are perceiving what they do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some LOOK to find something they<br/>
&gt; can twist or turn to suit them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is insulting to the volunteers who are here to help people. The<br/>
regulars have far more important things to do -- like being with our kids!<br/>
-- than to go looking for words to twist. The regulars are trying to seek<br/>
clarity so that those who&#39;ve come to understand unschooling can do so. They<br/>
are not picking on words to tick you off. That&#39;s a waste of precious<br/>
volunteer time and reader time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m no longer going to try to clarify anything to so that anyone gets a<br/>
&gt; better understanding of what was meant by the post.  It doesn&#39;t really matter<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, sometimes it does but it&#39;s not worth the effort because no<br/>

&gt; different things to different people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the purpose of the list is to help people understand, then<br/>
understanding is obviously important! Throwing out words that are<br/>
understandable only to you and then defending them against how people<br/>
perceive them is not helping anyone understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But in direct response to a post about injustice in<br/>
&gt; the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Friggin&#39; idiot&quot; was in response to a deep insult. And you then went on to<br/>
defend unschooling as noble when the subject was about people who volunteer<br/>
time *helping people understand* unschooling, not about people who spend<br/>
time unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t reading carefullly. You aren&#39;t writing carefully. You go off on<br/>
tangents without realizing you&#39;re changing the subject.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a great personality flaw. Probably lots of kind wonderful people<br/>
are like that. Some wonderful people probably can&#39;t type anything more than<br/>
gibberish.<br/>
<br/>
But it *is* a problem -- just as someone posting jibberish to the list would<br/>
be -- if you can&#39;t recognize it and can&#39;t recognize that not figuring out<br/>
how to fix it when you&#39;re participating on this list derails the list from<br/>
being as useful as it could be. It fills the list up with useless noise that<br/>
eats up readers&#39; and writers&#39; time. The list is already too busy than is<br/>
useful to most people. THere&#39;s too much to read. The list doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
add noise to that.<br/>

<br/>
Some people DO, in casual conversation, need to get the last word.  My mom <br/>
can&#39;t hear &quot;I have a headache&quot; without saying &quot;I have a headache AND my arm <br/>
hurts.&quot;    Some people need to be the last one to say &quot;see ya!&quot; in a phone <br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
This list is not casual conversation.  It has a purpose so important that if <br/>
the unchallenged &quot;last word&quot; is something which could send an unsettled <br/>
family on a wrong turn, someone (I don&#39;t care who)  needs to come in and say <br/>
something which will head them back toward unschooling.<br/>

You are my hero!  You changed my life in telling me how to do this on aol.  I <br/>
logged on today w/ith over 600 messages and quickly decided there wasn&#39;t room <br/>
enough in my head or heart for the angst in a number of the threads.  So I <br/>
read from some folks on the topic and deleted away.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t remember if I thankes you for this before.  Really, when it&#39;s too much <br/>
but you are afraid to miss something important (as opposed to something <br/>
simply big) - you&#39;ve described it perfectly.<br/>

Be sure and have your husband (Ben?) keep an eye out for mine (Mike) in <br/>
this regard...great idea!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Last year we had a &quot;Reluctant Dads, Reluctant Husabands&quot; <br/>
&gt;presentation.<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately (or fortunately???), it was attended by many women. Ben thought<br/>
&gt;that it was a little difficult for the dads to &quot;open up&quot; because they kept<br/>
&gt;being cut off by the women! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He&#39;s requested some time to approach JUST the dads and let them air concerns<br/>
&gt;and questions. I&#39;m not sure *when* this will be, but Ben wants to get the<br/>
&gt;husbands/dads alone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It&#39;ll happen, I just haven&#39;t &quot;scheduled&quot; it. Let your husband know. <br/>
