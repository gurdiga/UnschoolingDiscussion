<br/>
That&#39;s too bad they are doing that to your children it is not nice at all.<br/>
Hang in there.<br/>
Laura<br/>
&lt;&lt;My parents, the retired schoolteachers, are visiting this week (leaving <br/>
Friday, thank GOD), and they&#39;re driving me nuts! My kids cannot say or <br/>
do one thing without being corrected. Everyone else in the house can say <br/>
they&#39;d like some ice cream, but MY kids have to use the correct formula, <br/>
which of course they&#39;re refusing to do. My son skipped supper rather <br/>
than do whatever was being required of him *by a GUEST in my home!*<br/>
<br/>
And the worst of all is that it took me five days to see it! Even after <br/>
all the years I&#39;ve been on this list. Even though I&#39;ve decided, by very <br/>
conscious choice, to live in another state from them, I still couldn&#39;t <br/>
put a finger on why I was getting so upset. Because they, the courtesy <br/>
police, are being so incredibly RUDE to my kids, their hosts.<br/>
<br/>
OK, end of rant, thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83149439">my in-laws overstep boundaries on a regular basis. I&#39;ve gotten better at <br/>
setting boundaries and insisting they be respected, but it&#39;s an ongoing <br/>
battle. I found Susan Forward&#39;s books on dealing with difficult parents <br/>
and difficult in-laws to be helpful. But it took a while before I saw <br/>
past my anger to what they were actually doing, and the best way to deal <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
good luck, and feel free to rant away,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re aware of this right now, as you can validate your kids&#39;<br/>
feelings as needed.  I&#39;d be interested to hear your and other&#39;s<br/>
experiences in dealing with that kind of double standard.<br/>
<br/>
I only found out months/years after it happened, but my sister (who even<br/>
my husband, the most unjudgmental person on earth, said didn&#39;t<br/>
discipline her kids at all) took it upon herself to chastise my daughter<br/>
several times during at least her last two visits to us.  Because of my<br/>
sister&#39;s lack of discipline with her own kids, her daughter Emily (15<br/>
months younger than Bethany, but you would swear there&#39;s at least 10<br/>
years between them) can get away with anything, so Bethany now has a<br/>
very strong resentment toward them both, and now that I know things that<br/>
she&#39;s been telling me, I can see why.  My sister did her chastising<br/>
while I wasn&#39;t around, so I didn&#39;t know what was going on at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, my sister is in TX, while we&#39;re in MI.  Unluckily, she has the<br/>
money to travel whenever she likes and considers our home her &#39;oasis&#39;<br/>
(her word).  I haven&#39;t invited her since 2001 (special circs.), but she<br/>
came last year anyway, and may have invited herself for next month<br/>
(we&#39;re having an anniversary party one afternoon next month, and sent<br/>
her an email &#39;invitation&#39; to it, along with my understanding she<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t be able to make it.  Her response was she&#39;d have to<br/>
see, as it would involve taking the kids out of school and coming for a<br/>
WEEK.<br/>
<br/>
My spiritual self may know that she can&#39;t really do anything to us, but<br/>
my physical self dreads hearing another year of my daughter&#39;s resentment<br/>
and my own feelings of envy (she&#39;s got assets in the millions while<br/>
we&#39;re barely scraping by :)<br/>

Unfortunately, she&#39;s willing to stay at a hotel--even though the nearest<br/>
is 30 minutes away--but that seems to make the money spending worse.  I<br/>
insisted on the hotel last year, but things have gotten to the point<br/>

My mil really doesn&#39;t like me at all but, she is excruciatingly polite all<br/>
the time. Even when I say stuff that she totally disagrees with which is all<br/>
the time !Especially now, as I am speaking my mind a lot more these days.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after Mark and I had decided to get married, he was having an<br/>
argument with his parents and his dad went to say something about me. Mark&#39;s<br/>
response was &#39;don&#39;t you say anything about Julie or I will get up and leave<br/>
and you won&#39;t ever see me again.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
So they are real careful with me. &lt;g&gt; Doesn&#39;t mean they are not a pain in<br/>
the neck but it does make them a little more careful. They know that Mark<br/>
will only put up with so much and the stuff they used to do to control<br/>
situations (like crying and bringing up &quot;the past&quot;) has no effect upon<br/>
either of us.<br/>
<br/>
Julie, who doesn&#39;t have that much of a backbone but whose husband has one of<br/>
steel!<br/>

Actually, that thought might mean more than any other impetus I could <br/>
think of. My oldest daughter has no trouble speaking her mind, my <br/>
youngest either. My boys, now...one is 23 and a new father, and is so <br/>
intent on not offending anyone, and my middle boy, 10, backs down <br/>
EVERY time. Oldest boy, taking after me. Youngest boy, taking after <br/>
his dad.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, having the thought &quot;They&#39;re learning how to do this from ME&quot; <br/>
might provide the impetus I need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713537146">My sweet husband is such a marshmallow. L he WILL NOT FIGHT, which is <br/>
frustrating to me sometimes, because he doesn&#39;t even really like to <br/>
talk things out, he&#39;d just as soon leave things as they are. Ignore <br/>
it and it will go away seems to be his philosophy. SO...my mil and <br/>
bils have gotten away with commenting on my weight (like, the FIRST <br/>
TIME he brought me up to MT to meet them...)and my housekeeping and <br/>
the number of kids we have, with him making nary a murmur about it.<br/>
<br/>
I prolly need to get my own courage up to protect HIM from his <br/>
family! L Ah, well. I&#39;m better today than I was 10 years ago, and am <br/>
able to stand up to people whose opinions don&#39;t matter to me, AND <br/>
getting better at deciding WHOSE opinions DO matter to me...process <br/>
of elimination. One by one, the list of people to whom I will speak <br/>
my mind clearly, and not put up with their bullying, is growing.<br/>

told Bethany she could pick--the ranger knows us, knows Bethany is a<br/>

I don&#39;t know many more incidents, because my sister was always careful<br/>
to do it when I wasn&#39;t around.  Meanwhile, her daughter would pop a<br/>

animals at Bethany, snack on whatever she could find, then fill her<br/>
plate at supper and not really eat anything, etc.  I would rewind and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038235359">Oh, Holly...I&#39;m sorry this is how things are with her. And grateful <br/>
that my family has never had these kinds of problems.<br/>
<br/>
I realized after I posted, that she was staying in a hotel room, and <br/>
it wasn&#39;t really a self-invite but a big family event kind of thing. <br/>
Still, the running over daily to hang out at your house...&quot;Sure, come <br/>
on over today, but tomorrow, we&#39;re going to be out all day.&quot; and then <br/>
BE out...museum, park, zoo, library. <br/>
<br/>
Or, like Sandra says &quot;Come on over, but if you shame my kids, you&#39;re <br/>
outta here&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like some pretty bad passive aggressive stuff going on, her <br/>
waiting until you are gone from the area, to pick on your kids. have <br/>
you ever talked up front and frank about these things?<br/>
<br/>
(coming from Mrs. No Spine, mind you...dunno if I&#39;d be able to do it, <br/>
myself, but I do know talking about it frankly at least clears the <br/>
air)???<br/>

<br/>
Set boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
I have very difficult in-laws. The stories are many, but the point is: <br/>
set boundaries. You have a right to say &quot;no&quot;. You have a right to <br/>
protect your child. If you can&#39;t trust her around your child, simply do <br/>
not allow this to happen. Your child needs to be able to trust you, and <br/>
your first priority is your child, and yourself, not your sibling. <br/>
People who constantly overstep boundaries are used to getting their own <br/>
way, and are, on the whole, very self-centered.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t explain. You don&#39;t owe her an explanation for &quot;no&quot;. ex.: No, <br/>
today isn&#39;t a good day for a visit. (why?) It isn&#39;t a good day. We have <br/>
other plans. -- be firm, refuse to explain. Keep saying no. Your plans <br/>
may be to have a quiet day at home. You don&#39;t need to justify to her. <br/>
She isn&#39;t in charge of you. Set boundaries. Don&#39;t allow situations where <br/>
your child is alone w/ an adult who treats her badly. Period. My fil has <br/>
left my oldest in tears before w/ his condescending attitude, criticism, <br/>
etc. We simply make sure that she is not alone with him anymore, not <br/>
sitting next to him, etc. If he goes too far (as he always does - the <br/>
man is so supremely self-centered that he is only capable of seeing one <br/>
pov - his.) I have more than once had to step in, answer a question. <br/>
Generally, I&#39;ll send my daughter off somewhere (ex. go see what <br/>
dad/brother/somebody is doing. or could you get me such-and-such.) I <br/>
don&#39;t fight, I deflect. I don&#39;t confront, I essentially ignore.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, simple boundaries, firm answers, refusal to argue or explain <br/>
works. Sometimes, the behavior can be so outrageous, you have to take a <br/>
stand. But most of the time, firm, non-defensive works fine. Also, <br/>
there&#39;s no reason to allow your daughter to be alone w/ relatives who <br/>
treat her badly. If they treat her badly in your home, then meet them <br/>
elsewhere. You *don&#39;t* have to allow them free and unsupervised access <br/>
to your home and your life.<br/>
<br/>
And when the behavior doesn&#39;t improve, adjust accordingly. ex., in-laws <br/>
kept showing up at odd times and letting themselves in, even when we <br/>
were home. I could hear them knocking gently *as* they were putting the <br/>
key in the lock (&quot;we knocked, but you didn&#39;t answer the door.&quot; bs.) We <br/>
moved shortly after that, and fil was furious when I wouldn&#39;t allow him <br/>
to have a key to our new home. He badgered hubby for months, but I <br/>
insisted.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and give your kids permission to set boundaries, and to tell you <br/>
when someone else doesn&#39;t respect them.  Simply being an adult relative <br/>
does *not* give someone the right to insult, demean, or bully a child. <br/>
Also, tell your daughter it is okay to speak up. ex. &quot;I&#39;m allowed to <br/>
pick the mint.&quot; So many of us grew up with the attitude that children <br/>
never, ever challenged an adult, even when the adult was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a confrontational person by any means, but I had a choice of <br/>
learning to set boundaries or letting my in-laws run amok in my life. I <br/>
chose to learn to set boundaries, and although I will never have <br/>
anything more than a civil relationship w/ in-laws (because they <br/>
continue to try and be rude, controlling, and disrespectful of <br/>
everyone), I have learned how to keep them from harming my family. If <br/>
you want to chat, just holler. been there, done that, still dealing w/ <br/>
all of it. (I&#39;ve got tons of war stories, if you want to hear them <br/>
&lt;vbg&gt;. Honestly, I could write a sitcom. Some of it is absolutely <br/>
unbelievable.)<br/>
<br/>
hth,<br/>
good luck - I know how hard it is.<br/>

That has worked well with my in-laws.  They bug us at our house, and at their <br/>
house Keith&#39;s mom can justifiably call too many shots.  But when we&#39;re at a <br/>

<br/>
My parents left, and I&#39;m happy to report that the last 2 days went much <br/>
better than the first five. After I pointed out (in metaphor, not <br/>
directly) how rude it is to be rude to people even if they&#39;re young, and <br/>
after I started stressing how important it was for everyone to model <br/>
what they wanted the kids to do, it got better.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped for gas when we were all coming back home. The kids rode with <br/>
them in the van and were all waiting outside for me when I got there, so <br/>
I said to my son (5), &quot;Oh, Brian, you could have let them in--it&#39;s your <br/>
home and you&#39;re the host.&quot; Then I apologized to the lot of them for <br/>
having left them waiting.<br/>
<br/>
I also found it was so interesting that my parents came and instantly <br/>
started imposing their standards on a much more informal household. They <br/>
can see dh and I weren&#39;t doing these formally correct things, but still <br/>
found it OK to try to require them of the kids. I did mention that the <br/>
most correct thing for a host to do when a guest makes an error is to <br/>
make the same error, to make the guest feel at ease.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we have 3 months off now, before the next *test*.<br/>
