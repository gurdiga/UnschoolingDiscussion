&lt;&lt; I really, REALLY wouldn&#39;t want to model for my children that income could <br/>
be <br/>
legitimately tied to the unpredictable whim of an employer in the &quot;REAL&quot; <br/>
world.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Waiting tables occurred to me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s whim, sometimes it&#39;s generosity, sometimes it&#39;s you impress <br/>
the heck out of them, but you can be charming and a whiz and the person is poor <br/>
or stingy or always figures tips mathematically.<br/>

Kirby got a $75 Christmas bonus at work.  It came with pay stub and all.  <br/>
They had figured out how much income would work out to $75 net.   He didn&#39;t <br/>
expect it, but I think it was based on something.  Sales or hours or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith gets incentive stuff sometimes at Honeywell, and &quot;prize&quot; kind of gifts <br/>
sometimes.   Usually stuff.  They have little catalogs.  When he passes <br/>
&quot;anniversaries&quot; (lately, 15 years) he gets to choose something.  Last time he got an <br/>
electric juicing machine.   Last month they finished some project or another <br/>
on deadline and got gift certificate credit of some sort they can spend online <br/>
at one of several stores.  He&#39;s finally going to learn to use the Amazon <br/>
site, and probably will buy music.<br/>
<br/>
This is not written in defense of tying allowance to chores.  It&#39;s just an <br/>
information dump of some sort, about the real world not even being so <br/>
consistently dollar-per-hour sometimes.<br/>
