Can anyone suggest ways to help with sounds?  Terry doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem able to do the l sound or the p sound.  Is this strange?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it&#39;s not strange.  I have forgotten how old he is, but I do remember<br/>
both of your children are young.  There were many sounds that confused my<br/>
second child. He was 8 before he was able to say all the basic sounds.  And<br/>
he wasn&#39;t reading until 9and 1/2.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830064679">Hi Crys!<br/>
    Terry is still little, right? I think it&#39;s an age/developmental thing.<br/>
My 3yo Marshall is not making his L sounds at this point... (I&#39;d swear he<br/>
was a couple months ago, but that&#39;s Mommy ear for you&lt;g&gt;) Instead, his L&#39;s<br/>
sound like Y&#39;s -- Hello sounds more like Heyyo, etc.<br/>
    I haven&#39;t noticed about his p&#39;s, but his L&#39;s are very obviously missing<br/>
at this point... and I don&#39;t want to go wake him up right now to check on<br/>
his p&#39;s&lt;G&gt; I&#39;ll let you know sometime later in the day...<br/>
    I think I remember reading something about it being a developmental<br/>
thing -- they usually make those sounds correctly around five or so -- some<br/>
a little younger, some a little older.<br/>
YMMV.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959863901">My 4 year old has trouble with consonants.  I&#39;ve heard that: Speech<br/>
therapy is more effective when started young; AND that Most children will<br/>
outgrow speech &quot;problems&quot; without therapy (assuming there is not a<br/>
hearing problem).  Around here homeschoolers can enroll their children in<br/>
speech therapy through the schools, but I wonder if this is one more way<br/>
to label kids.  I like to think she will outgrow this.  She is much<br/>
easier to understand now than even a year ago.<br/>
I just sometimes repeat things to her with correct pronunciation.  Not in<br/>
a correcting way, but in a conversational way.  Like, &quot;Oh, you are<br/>
looking for the dog?&quot;  Dh has actually worked with her when she &quot;reads&quot;<br/>
him her picture books.  So there is one that she reads as &quot;Que- que-<br/>
que-een&quot;<br/>
