<div id="ygrps-yiv-921671343">We are having a clothes issue. My girls LOVE to wear dresses. They also love<br/>
to play outside. A lot of their dresses would be ruined if they played out<br/>
side in them. So, when they get up and want to get dressed I remind them<br/>
that they should put on play clothes (most of the time not dresses, they<br/>
have few play dresses). They tell me they won&#39;t go outside. I don&#39;t argue<br/>
with them, I let them put the fancy clothes on. Then a bit later when they<br/>
want to go outside I let them know they have to put play clothes on first.<br/>
That is when I hear &quot;But mom...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what to do. You guys always have great ideas, and I seem to be<br/>
stuck.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when they do wear their few play dresses outside I ask that they wear<br/>
shorts underneath. This mostly applies to my 4 year old. Then I end up<br/>
finding those shorts laying outside on the ground or on the porch.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do about this? More specifically, how can I change my thinking?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1901735978">Your post is so near and dear to my own heart!  My dd (9) Only wears dresses--and the <br/>
fancier the better.  I&#39;m thinking that she may actually have the princess gene, because <br/>
after conversations about the possibility of ruined dresses, she&#39;s always decided to wear <br/>
them outside anyway--in the sandbox often--and she&#39;s hardly ruined a one!  I have so <br/>
many wonderful pictures of her playing all out looking like a princess--and we could have <br/>
made a big issue of it and not had all those joyous occasions.  <br/>
<br/>
But the possibility of damage is there, so our strategy until now has been to buy them at <br/>
Costco because you can get the most beautiful dresses for $13.00, so I&#39;d just pick one up <br/>
every trip till we had the collection.  They only go up to size 8 though, so we&#39;ve had to be a <br/>
little more creative now that she&#39;s in a 10.  If you have your eyes out there looking you can <br/>
find them on sale for the next year, off season, etc., and of course there&#39;s Goodwill, but we <br/>
haven&#39;t had good luck with that ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
She has said that wearing fancy dresses is her style.  She really identifies herself as the girl <br/>
who does that--and she&#39;s unique in that regard, because most moms won&#39;t allow their <br/>
daughters to wear their best to the park.  My theory is that those are generally the clothes <br/>
that the most money are spent on, so why not get good use out of them!  <br/>
<br/>
My MIL gave her a beautiful blue velvet dress from Nordstrom&#39;s that had been worn by a <br/>
cousin.  She asked that Caroline not wear it except for fancy events because she wanted to <br/>
pass it down to another cousin.  I personally didn&#39;t appreciate this, because my MIL knows <br/>
exactly who my daughter is and has helped to get other dresses that could be worn--and <br/>
it was like torture for it to be in the closet and not touchable.  So one day my dd wore it <br/>
inside the house, stood up while accidently standing on a sash and ripped it off.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
believe it came off--and she wasn&#39;t playing or anything--just sitting very calmly wearing <br/>
the dress.  (She likes to wear the ties down because they feel like ribbons to her, but the <br/>
ties on this dress were much longer than her other dresses.)  So now I have to get it to a <br/>
seamstress to be repaired--so my feeling is that that dress was more trouble than it was <br/>
worth!!  We thought we were respecting the spirit of the request--oh, well.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing you could do is to see if your daughters will agree on one dress each that <br/>
does not get worn for play so that it stays nice to be available when needed.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Also, when they do wear their few play dresses outside I ask that they wear<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; shorts underneath. This mostly applies to my 4 year old. Then I end up<br/>
&gt; finding those shorts laying outside on the ground or on the porch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t been able to sell Caroline on skorts because they just don&#39;t FEEL like a skirt or <br/>
dress, so they don&#39;t feel fancy.<br/>

Holly had a Cinderella dress she wore LOTS.  It was a used yellow  <br/>
prom dress or bridesmaid&#39;s dress from a thrift store.  I took in the  <br/>
neckline by making hand-sewn (temporary, if it lasted long enough)  <br/>
pleats.  We cut the bottom off; didn&#39;t even hem it, I don&#39;t think.   <br/>
And with the long piece of the outer layer, she had a veil, a shawl,  <br/>
a belt...<br/>

no sewing neccessary! She has them in many colors and the tulle is <br/>
available for 1.00 a yard most of the time so very inexpensive to make <br/>
them, and she helps too. It may not solve all the problems but I know <br/>
she would like to wear these if shes like my daughter :)</div>

wanted to mention eBay.  I have gotten some great &quot;lots&quot; of clothes for <br/>
my kids -- including beautiful dresses for my dd to wear whenever.  <br/>
Clearance rack at Target has also netted us some wonderful dresses for <br/>
less that $5.<br/>

Otherwise I second the thrift store!  Shimmery adult skirts can become <br/>
capes or sun dresses if you add ribbins for shoulder straps.  We take <br/>
in a lot of waists, and add belts to a lot of fancy women&#39;s shirts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720489925">Find plenty of play dresses, even fancy ones on second hand stores, cheap simple ones on Target.<br/>
   <br/>
  I let my kids play in their fancy stuff. Why saved them if they are going to grow out of them anyway. I want them to have joy . If they feel joyful wearing their fancy stuff them be it.<br/>
  I know when they get older they may CHOOSE to save fancy stuff for special occasions.<br/>
  I don&#39;t want them to be like me that likes to save certain clothes because I like them to much and end up never really wearing them.<br/>
   <br/>
  Why does she need to wear shorts under her dress. Little kids underwear are so big anyway They probably cover more than her swim suit.<br/>
  To be honest people in the US are too hung up on stuff like that. When I lives abroad little girls did not even wear a bikini top at the the beach until they were much older.<br/>
  A modest underwear is as good as shorts.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; What can I do about this? More specifically, how can I change my  <br/>
&gt; thinking?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve already gotten a lot of good ideas about getting clothes that  <br/>
the girls *can* play in.  I want to give you some suggestions for how  <br/>
to change your thinking...<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself what your own issues are.  It could be anything, from  <br/>
not having any nice clothes when you were little even though you  <br/>
wanted them to being concerned about the money.  Our suggestions will  <br/>
be hit or miss if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with yourself.  One  <br/>
way to find out is to ask yourself questions.  When you are saying  <br/>
&#39;no&#39; to playing outside with the dresses what are you saying &#39;yes&#39;  <br/>
to?  You say the dresses will be ruined, so are you saying yes to  <br/>
being frugal?  ... to order?  ... to care for people&#39;s things?<br/>
<br/>
When I find myself saying &#39;no&#39; I try to take a moment to get at what  <br/>
my &#39;yes&#39; really is.  With a &#39;yes&#39; I open up to so many more creative  <br/>
solutions. With a &#39;no&#39; it&#39;s the end of the story, really.  You don&#39;t  <br/>
have to &quot;let go&quot; of your desire - whatever it is.  And once you are  <br/>
aware of the issue then you can make better choices for meeting that  <br/>
need w/o hindering your relationship with your kids.  For example, if  <br/>
your need is to be frugal - well, you&#39;ve received a lot of ideas  <br/>
already for creating an abundance of outdoor play dresses while still  <br/>
being frugal.  And, you can invite your kids to participate in the  <br/>
process - which will bring you all closer together.  And it will feel  <br/>
better, because you will be taking action to meet your need for being  <br/>
frugal rather than just closing the door with a &#39;no&#39;.<br/>

<br/>
Hie thee down to the closest thrift stores and start looking for used fancy <br/>

fancy dresses bought used, dirt cheap, that were either previously totally <br/>

<br/>

as little as possible yet still having a fantastic wardrobe the kids loved. <br/>

Learn to bargain down garage sale sellers. Go on the last day when they&#39;re <br/>
staring at stuff they really don&#39;t want to take back in the house. Fancy dresses <br/>
often have fancy prices, and sometimes you&#39;ll hear &quot;Do you know how much this <br/>
is worth?&quot; in reply to a low offer, but hey, the answer to that is whatever <br/>
it&#39;s worth TO YOU, not what they spent for it before their daughter wasn&#39;t <br/>
allowed to wear it much. :) <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to look at bigger sizes! Prom and bridesmaid dresses can be <br/>
fairly easily sized down for super fancy duds for little people with strategic <br/>
pleating.<br/>
<br/>
Aw, I miss those days. My babies are almost 30, 23 and the still home pair <br/>

<h4>Joylyn at 2008-05-07 06:05:21 +0300 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308883759">All of this reminded me of something that happened when Alexx was about <br/>
9 months old.<br/>
<br/>
She was happily playing on the floor with her toys and I was doing <br/>
something else, and I looked over and she was busily pulling the tissues <br/>
out of the box, one by one.  It must have seemed  like magic to her.  <br/>
She would pull one out, and another one would appear, and she&#39;d pull <br/>
that one out, and another one would appear.  My grandmother and my <br/>
mother slipped into my body and I went to pull the box away from her, oh <br/>
my god, she was wasting that precious tissue, that I was going to blow <br/>
my  nose into--but as I got close I realized that she had the expression <br/>
of utter delight.  She was happy, and around her were perfectly good <br/>
tissues, they just were no longer neatly in the box.  I stopped myself, <br/>
and thought about the situation<br/>
<br/>
The tissues were about 99 cents a box.  Maybe a bit more.  By far the <br/>
cheapest toy on the floor. <br/>
She wasn&#39;t hurting anything.<br/>
She wasn&#39;t hurting anybody.<br/>
She was really enjoying herself.<br/>
<br/>
So, I let it go and she and I played with the box of tissue until it was <br/>
empty.  Then she played with the empty box for a while.  She would stick <br/>
tissue back in and try to get them to come out the same magical way they <br/>
did before, but it didn&#39;t really work.  So then she used the box for her <br/>
other toys.  After she was clearly finished with the tissues themselves, <br/>
I piled up what was usable and put it where it could be used... I tossed <br/>
the rest. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, that is my gage for a lot of things.  Is it hurting anyone?  <br/>
hurting anything? <br/>
<br/>
Another example would be halloween costumes.  I used to want to, for <br/>
some odd reason, want to put them away for--uh what exactly?  Instead I <br/>
let them wear them, play with them, use them for dress up, etc. etc. <br/>
etc.  After all, in a few months they won&#39;t fit.  What better way to get <br/>
their money&#39;s worth...<br/>
<br/>
Same with fancy clothes.  I put it away, they wear it once.  I let them <br/>
wear it all the time--and I get my money&#39;s worth. <br/>
<br/>
If, I say, bought a particular outfit for a particular outing, I would <br/>
expect my children to understand that it needs to be saved for that <br/>
outing.  but after that, I think it&#39;s fair game.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everyone else... if they really want to wear their fancy <br/>
clothing out to play in the mud, let &#39;um.  Buy clothes for cheap, get <br/>
hand me downs.  In the long run, I would think that the memories of <br/>
playing in the mud in fancy clothing would be far better than the <br/>
memory  mom freaking out over a bit of fancy cloth that won&#39;t fit in six <br/>
months anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Or, they could just do what my kids did, when they were younger and we <br/>
had a back yard that was rather secluded--they played in the mud sans <br/>
clothing...<br/>

&gt; Don&#39;t forget to look at bigger sizes! Prom and bridesmaid dresses can be<br/>
&gt; fairly easily sized down for super fancy duds for little people with <br/>
&gt; strategic<br/>
&gt; pleating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Aw, I miss those days. My babies are almost 30, 23 and the still home <br/>
&gt; pair<br/>
&gt; will be 16 in 6 days. Man it goes fast!<br/>

To be honest people in the US are too hung up on stuff like that. When I<br/>
lives<br/>
abroad little girls did not even wear a bikini top at the the beach until<br/>
they<br/>
were much older.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, I agree with you, in theroy.<br/>
<br/>
You asked why.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s part of it. I admit that part is senseless fear, but it isn&#39;t all<br/>
senseless.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a story...<br/>
We are without a vehicle and using public transportation. About a week ago<br/>
we were riding the bus and this one guy got on. He looked a little slow (not<br/>
necessarily retarted, but you get the idea). Normally I am okay around<br/>
people of that nature (I worked in an adult foster care home and LOVED it),<br/>
but this guy kindda gave me the hebie gebies. About halfway through the<br/>
ride, he started staring at my youngest (4) who was in a dress and not<br/>
sitting like a lady. She was covered, but he was just looking a little to<br/>
closely for my comfort.<br/>
<br/>
I try not to worry too much about it because I rarely let my kids out of<br/>
site (I try not to use absolutes or I might say *never* in this case), but<br/>
it worries me a bit, now that we are on public transport that we are more<br/>
vulnerable to the people in our neighborhood and we don&#39;t live in a pleasant<br/>
neighborhood. I just did a sex offender search and it turned up 12 child<br/>
offenders within a 1 mile radius of my home. Here is the map they gave me.<br/>
The red dots are child offenders.<br/>

So, while I do agree with you in theroy, I think for us, we have to be<br/>
careful about the issue.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I assume you&#39;re wanting them to wear shorts under the dresses because you&#39;re<br/>
worrying about showing underwear as they play? If so, maybe wearing a<br/>
leotard<br/>
(or swimsuit) underneath might satisfy you both. They&#39;re not underwear, and<br/>
yet the girls still get the feel of bare legs that shorts sabotage.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Great idea. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for your ideas. You have helped me a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738787652">Is that still a concern in your backyard?<br/>
<br/>
Could you help your daughter learn to sit like a princess?  Maybe some<br/>
princess like bloomers would be more appealing than shorts?  I found a<br/>
site that sells them and they had cute pictures<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lainaline.com/girls_bloomers.htm)">http://www.lainaline.com/girls_bloomers.htm)</a>.  Kind of pricey, but<br/>
they don&#39;t look hard to make.  I bet your daughters would love helping<br/>
you pick the fabric :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188273982">This thread is timely for me, and one of the ways I have been making the<br/>
most progress with unschooling mentality.  Even when Grandma gives dd a<br/>
special dress, she is now allowed to wear it when and how she wants, as long<br/>
as it is safe and modest (a word I have never used in my life til recently).<br/>
 Now that the shoe is on the other foot, and I am the mom, I relate to the<br/>
cautiousness expressed about shorts under skirts.<br/>
Our relationship is too precious for me to get adversarial to protect<br/>
clothing.  Recently, Grandma bought dd some pastel espadrilles.  Within a<br/>
week they were brownish gray from being worn through woodchips and mud, but<br/>
oh she has been happy to be able to wear them all she wants.  And we have so<br/>
much more positive energy and trust, when I&#39;m not struggling against her<br/>
desires.<br/>
<br/>
As I say yes more, or simply don&#39;t say no, dd expresses so much<br/>
appreciativeness, and even respect for me - respect that I&#39;m behaving more<br/>
reasonably, I think.<br/>
