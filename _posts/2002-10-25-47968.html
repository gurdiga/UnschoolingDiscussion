<div id="ygrps-yiv-110050356">Hi everyone. Nancy, Mary, and Robyn thank you so much for sharing your stories.<br/>
<br/>
i had come to the conclusion that spanking was not for me about 1 1/2 yrs. ago, when Jaiden was 2 1/2. I realized that I was not a &#39;cold blooded&#39; spanker but that it was always done in anger, if I took the time to calm down, spanking just didn&#39;t make sense. But what really clinched it for me was seeing the paddle that my parents had used on me and my brother years before on my mother dinning room table, and she had had my baby brother(7yrs) write his name on one side of it (my brother and I had had our names carved into it by a family friend) and I just could NOT bring myself to EVER hit my kids. Unfortunatly, I did become a yeller and I am working on that. Now, dh was also spanked as a child, but not the way I was, and has never seen the problem in it. We have been talking about it for the past few years, most of it me resolving my issues with it, but this past year dh has been home pretty much 24/7, due to his injury, and has started to spank Jaiden and sometimes Avery we&#39;ve talked about it and came to the conclusion that it only happens when Jason is overly stressed or is in an unmanageable amount of pain. I did call him on it this last weekend and I do have to admit that I was not very tactful about it, but I did seem to get my point across. So we are both trying very hard to realize the things that set us off, me yelling and Jason swatting, and make sure that we remove ourselves from the situation, because we both admit that the problem resides with in us, not the kids. <br/>
<br/>
thanks for letting me get this all out<br/>
