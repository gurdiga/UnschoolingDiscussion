We could go to the beach and fish for rainbow trout or drive to Prince Rupert and sit in the black sand on the oceanic beach. Or we can go someplace interesting.  Got some local (artsy) water shots on the web, but one was in January (-20C)  <br/>
<br/>
Google some of these places and you&#39;ll see - it&#39;s not about igloos unless some unschool kids built one in their backyard!  LOL!<br/>
