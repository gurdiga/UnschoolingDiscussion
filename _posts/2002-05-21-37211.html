<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145655783">Maybe someone can help me with my Unschooling venture. I have been reading <br/>
the post...haven&#39;t ventured yet :0)...but I am thinking about it. I have been <br/>
reading and have found some really good ideas. I do have a question <br/>
though...my children are all into the computer and electronic games. I don&#39;t <br/>
drive (soon though) so how do I get them away from the computer games and the <br/>
electronic stuff? I know that there is learning in everything, but can you <br/>
help me find it? I am excited about this new venture and I am a little scared <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
Are my children going to get what they need? Will they score high, even at <br/>
grade level on standardized tests? How will I explain this one to my sister <br/>
who is always wondering what I am doing next? She doesn&#39;t too much say <br/>
anything about what I do, she supports me to the best of her ability. My <br/>
concern is not being able to explain these things and my reasonings for <br/>
Unschooling to family, friends etc.<br/>
<br/>
Should I run out and purchase books or something? See, I am confused. I don&#39;t <br/>
see where the learning is coming in when we are sitting around the house all <br/>
day long and there is basically nothing in our neighborhood but the cars that <br/>
pass our street. We are planning on purchasing Marine World Passes for the <br/>
season, would that be educational? Or would that be directed learning if I <br/>
chose to take them to see the animals as opposed to it just happening or them <br/>
wanting to see the animals? <br/>
<br/>
Please help me!<br/>
<br/>
:0) Trying to get a grip on the reality of all this...beat me if you have to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How could your husband get you away from something you enjoyed?<br/>
<br/>
By offering something even better?<br/>
<br/>
Try doing things *you* enjoy that they could join in. Cooking something new,<br/>
planting a kid friendly garden, washing the car, digging in the dirt and<br/>
seeing what you turn up, playing some music you&#39;ve never heard before.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are my children going to get what they need?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends. If they&#39;re choosing TV and computers because there isn&#39;t<br/>
anything that&#39;s as meaningful, then they&#39;re choosing the best of the least.<br/>
<br/>
Are you interested and curious about life? Do you have interests that you<br/>
get excited about such that your enthusiasm will infect your kids?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Will they score high, even at<br/>
&gt; grade level on standardized tests?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they don&#39;t need to know something at a particular age, does it matter?<br/>
Worrying about standardized tests can interfer with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I run out and purchase books or something?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only if you don&#39;t have any books in the house! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Can you get a weekly trip to the library so you (and perhaps they) can pick<br/>
out books and software and CD&#39;s and books on tape?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there is basically nothing in our neighborhood but the cars that<br/>
&gt; pass our street.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How many pass in an hour? What kind? Does the volume and type change during<br/>
the day? How many Volkswagon bugs pass by in an hour?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends. Are you going because it&#39;s educational or because it&#39;s fun? Are<br/>
you making the type of offers you would to a friend or because you&#39;re trying<br/>
to direct your kids to do the things you want them to do? Thinking about<br/>
that might help you answer your own question.<br/>

Kathy Ward has a really great unschooling section in her family webpages.   <br/>
At the bottom of the page noted above, there&#39;s a link to her article on video <br/>

When Kirby was little and we were poor, most of his toys were from thrift <br/>
stores, and we found things to do that cost nothing.<br/>
<br/>
A block from our house was a major street (Wyoming Blvd, for those who know <br/>
Albuquerque), and we would walk up there sometimes and sit on a low wall and <br/>
watch the cars go by.  Sometimes something really exciting like a bus or tow <br/>
truck pulling something interesting or a fire truck would go by.  Sometimes <br/>
an antique car.   <br/>
<br/>
But one game we played was secretly math and music and patterns, and it was <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Car&quot; was said on the same note.  &quot;Truck&quot; was said a third higher (like do to <br/>
mi) and &quot;Van&quot; was the fifth (so).  So the three together would have made a <br/>
major chord.  Kirby didn&#39;t know this, but he DID pick up the pattern without <br/>
any instruction, because it was a game.  So we would sing   car car car car <br/>
VAN truck car and it sounded like bugle music.  When he could sing some of <br/>
his own and I was singing other ones, it made harmonies.  He was too little <br/>
to maintain that, and would get on my note, but it didn&#39;t matter.  We weren&#39;t <br/>
&quot;singing,&quot; or looking for patterns or tunes, just speaking on a tone without <br/>
holding them out.<br/>
<br/>
This will be gibberish (sorry) to some, but it was a way to turn traffic flow <br/>
into a musical game.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446530012">Thank you for your input Joyce. You have answered my big question in regards <br/>
to how to do this thing. Okay, a good point you made when you used the <br/>
&quot;friend thing&quot; as an example. I would go to Marine World with my friend to <br/>
have fun, not to teach her anything. I would go to the mall with my friend to <br/>
have fun, not to teach her anything. I go the library with my friend to have <br/>
fun and to see what new things we can happen-chance upon, not to teach her <br/>
anything. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250897796">I have done this with my 4 year old just having fun. We would spell the cars <br/>
out really fast. Example, if we saw a truck, I would spell the word truck and <br/>
then say the word. If we saw a van I would spell van and then say the word. <br/>
So, one day his grandfather came over and Ticky looked out of the window and <br/>
said, &quot;Paw-paw, you don&#39;t have a v-a-n! Don&#39;t you know you have a t-r-u-c-k?&quot; <br/>
My father about fell off of his rocker. He was shocked...and so was I. He <br/>
never spelled the words when I spelled them, he only repeated them. So, of <br/>
course, I was surprised to hear him spelling these words.<br/>
<br/>
So, I have been unschooling (in a sense) and didn&#39;t even know it ;) How <br/>
refreshing!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone can give me some advice on helping my little one recognize the <br/>
sounds of the alphabet. Does anyone have any suggestions?<br/>

              <br/>
There&#39;s a tape Discovery Toys used to put out (still might) called &quot;Sounds <br/>
Like Fun.&quot;  It&#39;s monotonous, and everything is about lullaby-speed &lt;bwg&gt;, but <br/>
the songs are pretty sweet.  Some are traditional, most are original, all <br/>
done by the same woman accompanying herself on guitar.  But one is letter <br/>
sounds, and the tape comes with a little chart with pictures.  ALL my kids <br/>
really liked that tape.  It&#39;s not the spiffiest of recording engineering, but <br/>
it&#39;s pretty spiff for easy concepts painlessly presented.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s only dealing with initial sounds, but it was useful.<br/>
<br/>
Still, my kids read late, and we had that tape way before unschooling was <br/>
part of the scene, but they still sing those songs sometimes today.  It&#39;s how <br/>
they learned the months in order, and how they learned to count by tens.<br/>
