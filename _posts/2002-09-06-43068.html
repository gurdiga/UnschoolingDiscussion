&gt;For those who missed the segment on Fox News last night...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Fox News 9/6/02 Transcript<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Anchorman) Do you have the right to teach your kids as you see fit -<br/>
&gt;in the privacy of your own home? One state now says no, you can&#39;t do<br/>
&gt;that. In fact - if you do - you could get arrested. Who should<br/>
&gt;control your children&#39;s education you or the state?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;William Longenese (spelling?) reports. You decide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(narrator) It&#39;s back to school for the Andersons. Only this year the<br/>
&gt;state considers their teacher a felon. The crime? Their mother<br/>
&gt;schools Stan and Katie at home - without a teaching credential.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Homeschool Mom - Thurleen Anderson) )  &quot;I decided that I could do<br/>
&gt;better. We also are very committed to raising our children to be<br/>
&gt;leaders.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Calif. Education Department Deputy Superintendent Scott Hill) &quot;In<br/>
&gt;the eyes of the department there is no way to read the law but to say<br/>
&gt;that that&#39;s not an authorized education for those children.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Mike Smith - Home School Legal Defense) &quot;Well that&#39;s their opinion,<br/>
&gt;and we say they&#39;re wrong.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(narrator) More than a million children nationwide are homeschooled<br/>
&gt;With enrollment grow 15% per a year, some fear public education may<br/>
&gt;suffer. Last month California did something about it - issuing this<br/>
&gt;statewide directive. &quot;In California homeschooling, a situation where<br/>
&gt;noncredentialed parents teach their own children.. is not an<br/>
&gt;authorized exemption from mandatory public school attendance.  <br/>
&gt;Therefore parents who homeschool their children are operating outside<br/>
&gt;the law.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Mike Smith - Home School Legal Defense)  &quot;Perhaps this is an effort<br/>
&gt;to scare people not to remove their child from public school. They<br/>
&gt;are telling them it&#39;s illegal for most of them unless they are a<br/>
&gt;certified teacher.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Calif. Education Department Deputy Superintendent Scott Hill)  &quot;The<br/>
&gt;law is very clear kids must be educated. There&#39;s a compulsorily<br/>
&gt;education law in California. Kids are required to go to school. They<br/>
&gt;are require to learn our state content standards. That is the law.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(narrator) It is now up to the local districts to enforce truancy<br/>
&gt;statutes and while many won&#39;t bother. One&#39;s already going door to<br/>
&gt;door looking for kids who are homeschooled. Then it&#39;s up to a local<br/>
&gt;DA to prosecute parents - not because they can&#39;t teach, but because<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t carry a teaching credential.<br/>
&gt;* * * *<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m wondering if flooding the California Department of Education with<br/>
&gt;an email campaign would help the homeschoolers in California. The<br/>
&gt;HSLDA asked for email to go to Germany several years ago, and that<br/>
&gt;was supposed to have been effective. What do you think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see HSLDA and Fox News together sounding the alarm.<br/>
<br/>
They both use the alarm freely. The Alerts HSLDA sends out for every state<br/>
would make me fear that any moment DSS or the law would be knocking on my<br/>
door! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you check with Homeschool Association of California (http://www.hsc.org)<br/>
you can see what they&#39;re advising homeschoolers in CA to do about the<br/>
letters.<br/>

<br/>
If HSLDA can get enough people stirred up about California&#39;s lack of law, <br/>
won&#39;t they (HSLDA) be in there proposing laws soon so they can say &quot;Join our <br/>
association and give us $100 a year because WE made homeschooling legal in <br/>
Calfornia, and WE understand the new laws better than anyone and YOU all owe <br/>
us for the right to homeschool&quot;?<br/>
