<div id="ygrps-yiv-101769356">=My son, River Spirit, 13, who has had a declared hatred of writing<br/>
*anything* since the beginning of time, has just informed me that he is<br/>
writing a book. (Be still my heart!!!!!)  His book, currently titled, &quot;A<br/>
Warrior Reborn&quot;  is about three people from a lost civilization: a chef,<br/>
a teenage Royal Guard, and a retired gladiator.  There are also several<br/>
subcharacters in this adventure story.   He says he has written 44 pages<br/>
of the first chapter and is also using digital images (created with Lego<br/>
people) to illustrate it.=<br/>
<br/>
= That is very cool! And what  great idea to illustrate it that way. I&#39;ll<br/>
have<br/>
 to tell my son about that. His internal world of characters and conflicts<br/>
 revolves around the Lego guys and he&#39;s always telling stories about them.<br/>
 He&#39;d love to make a visual story about them that way.=<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My older son Noah (5 1/2) has been spending a lot of time lately creating<br/>
what he refers to as &quot;My Star Wars Lego Movie&quot;. He&#39;s seen all 5 Star Wars<br/>
movies (impatiently awaiting the next one - anyone know when it&#39;s supposed<br/>
to come out??) and has created a lot of fairly complex ships, etc. He has<br/>
made up a bunch of new characters as well (including &quot;Bad&quot; versions of most<br/>
of the main characters -e.g. &quot;Bad&quot; Han Solo -that have all gone to the Dark<br/>
Side) and a plot which continues to unfold, with new bits and pieces added<br/>
almost daily. He hasn&#39;t expressed any interest in trying to record any of<br/>
this so far, I think I&#39;ll ask him if he wants to.<br/>
