Open Letter to President GW Bush<br/>
<br/>
2/2/2001<br/>
<br/>
Dear President Bush,<br/>
<br/>
As the Jewish son of a US veteran who fought in Nazi<br/>
Germany during WWII I am deeply troubled by your links to<br/>
the Third Reich, anti-Semitism and eugenics. References to<br/>
these connections can be found in many books and newspaper<br/>
articles and on thousands of websites on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
I have personally done two years of research which have<br/>
convinced me of the validity of these accusations involving<br/>
three generations of your family. Among the prominent authors<br/>
that link the Bush family directly to Nazi Germany is former<br/>
US Justice Department Nazi War Crimes Prosecutor, John<br/>
Loftus, now the President of the Florida Holocaust Museum.<br/>
<br/>
While I did not vote for you and feel the outcome of the 2000<br/>
election has questionable legitimacy, I fully accept that you are<br/>
now the President of the United States. Therefore, it is very<br/>
important that you personally address these issues.<br/>
<br/>
Since the election I have observed a concerted public effort on<br/>
your part to &quot;reach out&quot; to groups such as African Americans<br/>
and the disabled - the same groups your family targeted for<br/>
elimination or sterilization in the past. I&#39;d like to believe this<br/>
represents a dramatic change of heart on your part rather than<br/>
being a cynical public relations effort intended to make people<br/>
forget your family history - or worse - a smoke screen for more<br/>
horrors to come.<br/>
<br/>
You frequently claim to be a man of faith, a born-again<br/>
Christian. Both the old and new testaments you read from each<br/>
day place great emphasis on repentance and forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
In that context it would seem appropriate that you respond to<br/>
these allegations, either by denying or acknowledging them<br/>
and if true, publicly apologize to the American people. That,<br/>
rather than empty rhetoric and political posturing, could go a<br/>
long way towards accomplishing the &quot;healing&quot; you seek.<br/>
<br/>
For the purpose of clarity I will list and briefly summarize<br/>
some details of the four main allegations in question and ask<br/>
that you respond to each. References from books, newspapers<br/>
and the websites of  think tanks and foundations associated<br/>
with you which support each allegation can be found on the<br/>
website and in the texts noted at the end of this letter.<br/>
<br/>
1. THE BUSH FAMILY FINANCED HITLER<br/>
<br/>
Your grandfather Prescott Bush (whose picture now hangs in<br/>
the oval office) and his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker<br/>
(who you are named after) were managing directors, stock<br/>
holders and board members of Brown Brothers Harriman, once<br/>
the most important private banking house in America. In that<br/>
capacity they personally directed a constellation of interlocking<br/>
companies including the Hamburg-Amerika Shipping Line and<br/>
the Union Banking Corporation. In 1942 a number of their<br/>
companies were seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian<br/>
under authority of the US Congress&#39; Trading with the Enemy<br/>
Act, which declared them to be fronts for the Nazis.<br/>
<br/>
These companies functioned as a means of channeling<br/>
hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and strategic war<br/>
materials to Nazi Germany and to IG Farben, an oil, chemical<br/>
and munitions cartel half-owned by John D Rockefellers&#39;<br/>
Standard Oil. This same IG Farben built and operated<br/>
Auschwitz and forty other slave labor factory/death camps.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, this shameful corporate history did not end with<br/>
the WWII era. Many of the corporations such as GM, Alcoa,<br/>
Monsanto and the various oil companies represented so<br/>
abundantly by your cabinet appointees were also enthusiastic<br/>
supporters of Nazi Germany and in a number of instances were<br/>
directly involved in IG Farbens&#39; slave labor factories, the<br/>
Holocaust and eugenics. The origin of your family fortune and<br/>
extensive political and corporate connections can virtually all<br/>
be directly traced to the Third Reich.<br/>
<br/>
2. THE BUSH FAMILY ARE THREE GENERATIONS OF<br/>
EUGENICISTS<br/>
<br/>
While your public pronouncements have led many Americans<br/>
to believe you are a principled opponent of abortion and a firm<br/>
supporter of equal rights for minorities, the mentally ill and the<br/>
disabled even a little research into your family background<br/>
paints a very different picture. In close cooperation with the<br/>
Rockefeller and Harriman families - a relationship that began<br/>
with financing Hitler - your family has been at the forefront of<br/>
the American eugenics movement for almost seventy years.<br/>
<br/>
Your father and grandfather were both prominently involved in<br/>
Planned Parenthood at a time when this was a very<br/>
controversial organization.  Known today as an advocate for a<br/>
womens&#39; right to choose, when your father and grandfather<br/>
were involved this organization was at the forefront of a<br/>
nationwide movement to sterilize minorities, the mentally ill<br/>
and the disabled. Its&#39; founder Margaret Sanger enthusiastically<br/>
supported Hitlers&#39; eugenics laws in the 1930&#39;s and sought to<br/>
established them throughout the US. Both your father and<br/>
grandfather spent many years trying to limit the population of<br/>
third world nations which they saw as a threat to the<br/>
dominance of the US. As a Congressman you father was<br/>
nicknamed &quot;rubbers&quot; by his colleagues because of his<br/>
obsession with limiting the birthrates of minorities.<br/>
<br/>
Like you and many of your advisors, both your father and<br/>
grandfather were associated with the Pioneer Fund, a private<br/>
eugenics foundation in NYC founded by Wycliffe Draper.<br/>
Draper and other Pioneer Fund members helped Hitler draft<br/>
both Nazi Germany&#39;s racial laws and the US laws requiring<br/>
mandatory court-ordered sterilization which at one time were<br/>
on the books in 30 States. These were the very laws Hitlers&#39;<br/>
eugenics laws - which led to the Holocaust -  were inspired by.<br/>
<br/>
William H. Draper III, a relative of the Pioneer Fund&#39;s Wycliffe<br/>
Draper and co-fundraising chairman for the 1980<br/>
Bush-for-President national campaign, has also been a leader<br/>
of the world eugenics movement. His father, William H.<br/>
Draper, Jr. was director of the German Credit and Investment<br/>
Corp, a Nazi front company associated with your grandfather,<br/>
Prescott Bush.<br/>
<br/>
As UN Ambassador your father worked with both William H.<br/>
Draper III and John D Rockefeller III to expand the activities<br/>
of the Office of Population Control at the US Agency for<br/>
International Development (USAID). Your father praised the<br/>
lifelong eugenics efforts of both Rockefeller and Draper in an<br/>
introduction he wrote to a 1973 book, World Population Crisis:<br/>
The United States Response. Many researchers now believe the<br/>
African AIDs epidemic was the result of one of the many<br/>
covert population control techniques employed by USAID.<br/>
<br/>
While chair of the Republican Task Force on Earth Resources<br/>
and Population your father brought William Shockley, a noted<br/>
race scientist, before the US Congress to testify in support of<br/>
Shockleys&#39; &quot;Bonus Sterilization Plan&quot; which proposed offering<br/>
a cash incentive to African Americans, drug addicts and the<br/>
disabled who would voluntarily be sterilized as a means of<br/>
reducing welfare, social security benefits and crime.<br/>
<br/>
3. COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM IS THE NEW<br/>
EUGENICS<br/>
<br/>
Most Americans know that while Governor of Texas you<br/>
presided over more executions than any US governor or world<br/>
leader, including the executions of women, the mentally ill and<br/>
retarded prisoners. Simultaneously, under your watch Texas<br/>
has had the worst record of legal assistance to accused<br/>
prisoners of any State. Your &quot;Guinness record&quot; for executions<br/>
is consistent with the eugenics-based efforts of both your father<br/>
and grandfather.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous members of your cabinet and staff have praised or<br/>
are direct associates of Charles Murray, author of the Bell<br/>
Curve, a classic text of eugenics which attempts to prove that<br/>
African Americans are genetically inferior and thus have the<br/>
lowest IQ&#39;s of any race. This bogus theory is then used by<br/>
Murray as the justification for eliminating welfare, affirmative<br/>
action, social service programs and for building more prisons -<br/>
all of which are ideas you are closely associated with. Almost<br/>
every reference in the Bell Curve about African Americans can<br/>
be directly traced to the Pioneer Fund, a eugenics organization<br/>
with long-standing ties to your family.<br/>
<br/>
Among your appointees and advisors who share an<br/>
organizational or personal association to the Bell Curve are<br/>
Stephen Goldsmith, Tommy Thompson, Elaine Chou, Myron<br/>
Magnet, Marvin Olasky, Linda Chavez, Karl Rove, Floyd<br/>
Flake, Spencer Abraham and John Ashcroft. Even your<br/>
minority advisors have a Bell Curve connection.<br/>
<br/>
Your Health and Human Services Sec. Tommy Thompson,<br/>
based his welfare reforms while Governor of Wisconsin on<br/>
Murrays&#39;&#39; books and employed Murray as a consultant. Your<br/>
chief domestic policy advisor, Stephen Goldsmith, credits<br/>
Murray with creating the entire welfare reform movement in<br/>
the US and recently introduced him as a great scholar at a<br/>
welfare seminar at the Manhattan Institute. Myron Magnet, the<br/>
man whose book you claim has influenced you second only to<br/>
the bible, praises Murray in almost every article he writes.<br/>
<br/>
Murrays&#39;&#39; racially-charged ideas are extensively quoted and<br/>
lavishly praised on the websites of the Heritage Foundation,<br/>
The Federalist Society and the Manhattan Institute - right wing<br/>
think tanks closely identified with you and virtually all of your<br/>
appointees. On some of these websites Murray is mentioned<br/>
hundreds of times, always as a visionary and brilliant thinker.<br/>
These foundations significantly contributed in numerous ways<br/>
to your becoming President and even a number of the US<br/>
Supreme Court Justices who ruled in your favor are members.<br/>
<br/>
The Bell Curve was written at the Manhattan Institute, the very<br/>
think tank that you have publicly acknowledged as the source<br/>
of your policy ideas. Murray continues to give speeches there<br/>
to this day alongside some of your closest advisors.<br/>
<br/>
Manhattan Institute senior fellows, John J. DiIulio Jr. and<br/>
Stephen Goldsmith, were just appointed by you to head up a<br/>
multi-billion dollar &quot;faith based initiative&quot; intended to replace<br/>
social services. Consistent with many facts addressed in this<br/>
letter, the Manhattan Institute was founded by former CIA<br/>
director, William Casey - a close associate of your father - who<br/>
spent the years following WWII bringing hundreds of former<br/>
Nazis involved in eugenics to the US.<br/>
<br/>
4. YOU HOPE TO MAKE CHRISTIANITY THE DEFACTO<br/>
&quot;OFFICIAL&quot; RELIGION OF THE US<br/>
<br/>
You have made numerous public statements both as Governor<br/>
of Texas and US President which imply that Christianity is the<br/>
official religion of this nation, a viewpoint apparently shared<br/>
by many of your staff, cabinet members and advisors. As<br/>
governor you created an official Texas State holiday, Jesus<br/>
Day. I am unable to find any reference to you creating a<br/>
corresponding Moses Day, Buddha Day or Mohammed Day<br/>
despite your state having many citizens of those faiths.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike any other modern-day US President you have not<br/>
appointed a single Jewish person to your diverse cabinet which<br/>
uniquely has an Arab-American, a Chinese-American, a<br/>
Japanese-American, an African-American and a<br/>
Cuban-American. While campaigning for President you<br/>
publicly stated your belief that only those who accept Christ<br/>
can enter heaven, which implies that followers of other<br/>
religions - specifically Judaism - are condemned to hell. This<br/>
same statement has been used for centuries to justify<br/>
anti-Semitism, forced conversions and genocide. At issue is not<br/>
your beliefs but that you chose to highlight this while running<br/>
for the nation&#39;s highest office, despite knowing it&#39;s historical<br/>
use as a means of fomenting anti-Semitism.<br/>
<br/>
During your father&#39;s 1988 Presidential campaign it was<br/>
discovered by a Jewish newspaper that at least ten former<br/>
Nazis, a number of them SS officials directly involved in<br/>
carrying out the Holocaust, were working in high-level<br/>
capacities within his campaign. Public pressure forced them to<br/>
resign but later many resumed working with your father.<br/>
<br/>
Your father is also known to be a close friend, long-time ally<br/>
and business partner of the Saudi royal family, as is your Vice<br/>
President, Dick Cheney. During WWII this corrupt, virulently<br/>
anti-Semitic dynasty - which was set up as rulers in the 1920&#39;s<br/>
by your father&#39;s Wall Street oil business partners - were among<br/>
Hitler&#39;s most enthusiastic supporters.<br/>
<br/>
Your so-called faith-based initiative &quot;guru&quot;, Marvin Olasky,<br/>
converted from Judaism to Christianity and actively seeks to<br/>
convert other Jews as well. Unlike some participants in your<br/>
faith-based initiative, Mr. Olasky is honest enough to admit<br/>
that proselytizing will take place while social services are<br/>
performed at taxpayer expense.<br/>
<br/>
In light of these facts and your families decade long efforts to<br/>
finance Nazi Germany it seems only fair to ask, are you an<br/>
anti-Semite?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. President, I understand that you have many important tasks<br/>
to accomplish. Nevertheless, it seems essential that you<br/>
respond to these questions in detail without further delay. If as<br/>
you have repeatedly said, you are a, &quot;uniter not a divider&quot;, then<br/>
nothing could do more to resolve the lingering doubts millions<br/>
of Americans have about you, your agenda, your cabinet<br/>
appointees and your presidency than straightforward answers<br/>
to these questions.<br/>
<br/>
The American people would surely be comforted to find that<br/>
all of these charges are untrue and that you are in fact the<br/>
humble family man and born-again Christian your aides and<br/>
the corporate media are so intent on portraying to us.<br/>
