 </span></blockquote>I know I was taught different but I always saw Lanora as perfect.  I <br/>
understood why she did what she did, even when it appeared to be &quot;bad&quot;.  Even <br/>
selfishness comes from a real human need.  Now I have to explain this concept <br/>
to HER when dealing with her brother!<br/>
<br/>
When Lanora was three we were her friend&#39;s birthday party.  The people <br/>
attending were primarily from church.  One woman, an avid spanker, came to me <br/>
insisting that I start spanking Lanora because she was becoming a brat.  <br/>
Evidently Lanora had yelled at this woman&#39;s mother, &quot;You get out of here!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Without seeing your child as whole and perfect the knee jerk reaction would <br/>
be to assume the worst.  Instead, I simply ASKED why.  She had recently <br/>
learned about &quot;stranger danger&quot; and had been told that if she was approached <br/>
by a stranger and couldn&#39;t get to an adult she trusted that she should yell <br/>
at them to go away.<br/>
<br/>
The woman, someone Lanora didn&#39;t know, came up to her while she was standing <br/>
inside a play structure.  She couldn&#39;t get out and run to me so she did what <br/>
she had heard.  Real simple, no rudeness, no evil &quot;sin&quot; nature, no need for <br/>
correction of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen so many parents in church accuse their kids, refuse to hear any <br/>
explanation and then punish.  These are the same people who look at me like <br/>
I&#39;ve got two heads when I BELIEVE my kids.  They can&#39;t conceive of trusting <br/>
their own children!  I don&#39;t hang around these people any more.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m too sad now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH NO! <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at the sadness.  Look at the many people you and your daughter <br/>
will meet who will see your relationship and reconsider their own.<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend I&#39;d known for years before either of us had children.  She has <br/>
not excuse for spanking but that she&#39;s just controlling and mean.  Although <br/>
she has fundamentalist ancestors (grandparents and beyond there), she was <br/>
raised &quot;logically&quot; and scientifically.  And they had saved in their set of <br/>
logical &quot;facts&quot; that if you didn&#39;t spank kids they would be bad.<br/>
<br/>
So when Kirby was being absolutely normal and curious and active, and her <br/>
daughter was sitting right where they had told her to sit and being quiet <br/>
they way they told her to be, they wanted me to spank Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
The main purpose was so that they were justified.<br/>
<br/>
They would have been happy for me to hurt Kirby to make their daughter feel <br/>
better about her sitting still to avoid a spanking.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that sad?<br/>
<br/>
Our friendship started to fail then.   <br/>
She told me that Kirby was going to grow up to hit me.<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>
<br/>
Current situation is her kids are cynical and frustrated and mean and I have <br/>
been told by a mutual friend that her son (Marty&#39;s age) has actually hit her <br/>
at least once.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are happy and peaceable and generous.  <br/>
<br/>
We both had choices.  I asked her several times to think about homeschooling. <br/>
 She said she might homeschool when they were older.  But by the time they <br/>
were older the dad had shot himself in the head and she had to work fulltime. <br/>
  More happiness sooner could have turned their lives around HUGELY.<br/>
<br/>
The dozen+ families who knew both my family AND that family have a no-brainer <br/>
display of whether being gentle with little kids can turn out well, and <br/>
whether spanking guarantees good teen behavior.   And more.  It took a while <br/>
to set the tableaux up for them, and I&#39;m sad that it involved a death, but <br/>
twelve, fourteen years after the parting of ways, we are making serious <br/>
differences in MANY lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Sandra, you&#39;re right and do see it that way.  I just get sad when I <br/>
think of the relationships I had and how this &quot;doctrine&quot; of spanking has been <br/>
made such a cornerstone.  I&#39;m sad about the relationships that have been lost <br/>
over this issue.  I&#39;m even more sad about the kids I&#39;ve seen lost once they <br/>
were old enough to throw off the control of their parents.  Most of them go <br/>
off the deep end.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so weird!  It was obvious to everyone near us how wonderful Lanora was.  <br/>
She was bright, friendly, well spoken, related easily with adults and was <br/>
responsive to my words.  All of this and people STILL told me I needed to <br/>
spank her.  I asked them &quot;Why would I?  Do you think her behavior could be <br/>
any better?&quot;  They agreed with how great she was but I guess they thought I <br/>
should just schedule spankings, needed or not.<br/>
<br/>
It got me to question a lot of things and that has been good.  I just wish I <br/>
could get all of the &quot;punishment&quot; mind set out of my head.  It&#39;s a long <br/>
learning curve for me I guess, the doubts make it hard to stay on course.  <br/>
I&#39;m thankful for this list and those who hold up the standard so I can&#39;t <br/>
forget where I&#39;m going.<br/>

Kris,  <br/>

it is sad and it is hard,  I know how you are feeling.  Lots of transition around our circle of friends too.   I just keep hoping that as these friends go, new ones will come that will be more accepting and similar in their parenting styles.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 3 Feb 2003, at  1:05pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70977735">I was thinking about this last night.<br/>
<br/>
A good friend of mine and I have sons that are similar in many ways.  We were supposed to take a trip together.  Our boys have never met though, and we&#39;ve never done anything like that before.<br/>
<br/>
She and I are very different in how we parent, etc.  It turned out we couldn&#39;t go on the trip anyway, but I was glad because after thinking about it, I realized it very well could have been a disaster.  She would have seen some things in my son that she would have &quot;disciplined&quot; and I would have handled it much differently than she does.<br/>
<br/>
She talks about her son all the time and I do understand her frustration, but I think she needs to change the way she thinks about him.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the only way I seem to be able to maintain many of these kinds of friendships is just not to talk about what I do or how I do it, and not to have our kids spend time together, or at least under certain circumstances.  I share very little of my philosophy with these people.  <br/>
<br/>
Its not hard in this case because we are co-workers so we see each other there without having to get together outside of work.  But I also have friends of all kinds everywhere, and there are just some people who I count as a friend but not the kind of friend I would share things with.  There are just different kinds of friends I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Its amazing to me to listen to some of these people though.  When I told my hacker story, the first thing they jumped on was why an 11 year old would be online chatting in the first place (sigh).  I&#39;ve met really wonderful people online and spent time at their HOMES!  Why would I deny that to my children? It expands their universe and their cultural experience to meet people this way.<br/>
<br/>
So many people have bought into a deeper philsophy, not just about education, not just about spanking or &quot;training a child&quot; but the idea that children are really little more than animals (though none of them would ever use &quot;animal&quot; to describe their child&#39;s intelligence).   People just cannot conceive that children would have intelligent thinking even at their young ages and that it is *good* to support and encourage that.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked me last night why I homeschool.  Turned out he was a college history prof. but I didn&#39;t know that right away.  I told him it wasn&#39;t the teachers necessarily, and we liked family time together, but I want my kids to have a real opinion on things...even if it differs with authority.  <br/>
<br/>
He asked if I was prepping them for SAT&#39;s.  I said I didn&#39;t know yet, that I have a philosophical problem with testing (and why).  I told a stranger more in that 5 minutes than I&#39;ve told my co-workers in 15 years LOL.<br/>

<br/>
  Was his response good?<br/>
<br/>
  Well....actually it was.  But he did say that if my kids ever want to get into any good (selective) college <br/>
  they&#39;ll HAVE to have good SAT&#39;s whether we like it or not.  He was very nice and I think his point had more to do with his thought that reality dictates their necessity, not that testing is a poor way to evaluate learning.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever really run into a situation where he&#39;s *had* to think about how to get around it.  And if the circumstances had been different, I might have talked more about that.   He was a family member visiting a patient that I had, and circumstances were such that I did not want to cause any distress.  He *DID* say that the university where he teaches doesn&#39;t use SAT&#39;s though, and I thought that was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
  He teaches in West Virginia I think.<br/>
<br/>
  But, at that point, I started using my &quot;evasive&quot; tactics then (aka diplomacy LOL) and said that I have been reading up on it and that I think I&quot;ve found some ways around it.  I also mentioned that I wasn&#39;t quite sure which direction my kids were going to take yet so it wasn&#39;t really an issue quite yet.  <br/>
<br/>
  In my favor though, the reason we began talking was bec. he was watching a Benedict Arnold movie and telling me how the movie has it all wrong, etc.  We got to talking about history and he said his students often don&#39;t know about the names of the two original political parties, etc.  I knew about them (but couldn&#39;t remember their names).  And then we got to talking about Jefferson and I said &quot;oh yeah, he&#39;s the one who was sort of the aristocrat but believed that every man should have a vote, and not be overun by aristrocracy.  <br/>
<br/>
  From there we got into a lively discussion about history, students, education, etc etc.  And the SAT kind of fell by the wayside...but he did say he was impressed that a nurse would know this information when his political science majors and History majors do not.<br/>
<br/>
  We also talked about learning and some of the books I&#39;ve chosen to have around the house...some of the ones we&#39;ve read.  <br/>
<br/>
  Overall, I think we agreed on more than we would have disagreed on. I *really* enjoyed the discussion and I know he did too.  Its so neat to see someone come alive with their passion like that and it was very affirming to be able to say &quot;I never learned this stuff in school, but I&#39;m learning it now with my kids&quot;.   We had so much to talk about.  We talked about the constitution and declaration, etc etc. and I told him how I finally understood how the constitution came to be when I read it side by side with the declaration and how we had never done that in school.  <br/>
<br/>
  I even shared that I was involved in the legislative effort here in PA and that the legislators on the ed commmittee don&#39;t even know what is in the PA constitution (sad isn&#39;t it!).  <br/>
<br/>
  The whole family was such a neat neat family.  I wish I knew them better.<br/>
