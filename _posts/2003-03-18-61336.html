<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051501326">Hello all - It&#39;s probably about time I introduce myself as I&#39;ve been lurking on this wonderful group for about a week.  I&#39;m Karen, my dd is Brogan Elizabeth and dh is Stuart.  Brogan just turned 3 in December and we are, of course homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Our family and friends know that we are homeschooling but it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve announced to the general population - until today.....<br/>
<br/>
a bit of background info...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been in Gymboree Music with Teddy and his mom for a few months now. On Thursday she told us it was their last day as they were moving on Friday :-( On Friday I was talking to the Gymboree owner (Christine) about losing Teddy and his mom and she said to me &quot;well you know they were kind of different&quot; She said it - in not a mean way but not in a positive one either. Then she said &quot;she was homeschooling&quot; almost like it was a weird thing. That made me feel a bit odd - normally I&#39;d pipe up and mention that I&#39;m homeschooling too but something held me back. <br/>
<br/>
When Christine mentioned they were homeschooling my immediate reaction was almost sadness - I wish I had known that they were homeschooling because I would have loved to have talked to her about it.<br/>
<br/>
Today as we were driving to Brogan&#39;s gym class I mentioned the incident to Stuart. I was telling him how Christine made me feel like homeschooling was a bit odd and like somehow I should &#39;hide&#39; the homeschooling. And yet I&#39;m not ashamed of it - I really think this is the right direction for our family and I&#39;m proud that I&#39;m homeschooling. I told him I wasn&#39;t going to let people like Christine bother me.<br/>
<br/>
One of the mommies in gym class works at the library. I was going to ask her how to &#39;suggest&#39; a homeschooling book that I wanted to the library (hoping they&#39;d get it in). After I casually asked her how to go about it (there&#39;s a form) she asked me what book it was - I told her it was a homeschooling book. All 3 ladies that I was hanging out with had such a POSITIVE reaction to me homeschooling - it was GREAT.<br/>
<br/>
I was really stunned. The gal that works at the library told me Groton (my town) has a really strong homeschooling community and that one of the groups meets every Wednesday night at the library. She told me to give her a call and she&#39;d get the group e-mail address for me or I could drop by and meet the other homeschoolers. Another gal knew someone who&#39;s a huge homeschooling advocate and the third gal suggested some books and was really excited and supportive about homeschooling. I swear I left gym just glowing. I really haven&#39;t checked around locally to see what other homeschoolers are out there - now I know there&#39;s a good system in place :-)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I rambled a bit it was just a great experience. Lesson learned...I&#39;ll never hide my homeschooling again. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really enjoying reading all of your messages.   <br/>
<br/>
Ren your &quot;it finally happened&quot; thread was very helpful.  Here in CT the &#39;guidelines&#39; say you &#39;need&#39; to register in order to homeschool - however there&#39;s no law saying that you have to.  If they &#39;catch&#39; you - I believe there&#39;s a form you have to fill in and return within 10 days.  I, however rather like Sandra&#39;s suggestion of sending them a copy if they &#39;need&#39; one and chucking the original :-)<br/>
