 </span></blockquote>My Daddy didn&#39;t like for us to &#39;act up&quot; at the dinner table.  But, my 2 <br/>
sisters, AND my mother and I, often ended up laughing and &quot;carrying on&quot; during <br/>
dinner.  Mom would stifle a giggle and try to act like she wasnt in on the fun..  <br/>
But, we would keep on and on til we were all dying out belly laughing ( <br/>
including Mom)  Daddy would get mad shove himself away from the table and storm into <br/>
the living room.  Then we would REALLY get to rolling laughing, and he would <br/>
sulk in the living room til we finally wound down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Every time we went out to eat, we would get a &quot;warning talk&quot; from Daddy.. <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you girls go in here  and act up, now, ya hear?&quot;  Of course, that only <br/>
served as fuel to make us loud and giggly.  Daddy would give us an evil eye <br/>
and lean in and whisper to us.. &quot;Everybody knows your here&quot;.    My sisters and <br/>
Mom and I still  use this line when we go out with just &quot;the girls&quot; and we get <br/>
loud and rowdy.. &quot;Alright now, everybody knows you&#39;re here&quot;  LMBO.. As <br/>
children, we might say, &quot; I&#39;m thirsty, I want something to drink&quot;, Daddy&#39;s solution:  <br/>
&quot;Get in there and hook your lip around that spigot&quot;.  We would plead,   <br/>
&quot;Daddy, we&#39;re hungry, let&#39;s stop to get something to eat&quot;  ( on a long road trip <br/>
back from Grandma&#39;s).  Daddy replies,  &quot;I&#39;m gonna take you to a restaurant, you <br/>
can get something real good to eat&quot;  We are so excited,  &quot;Yay, yay, where is <br/>
it? when are we stopping?&quot;   Daddy&#39;s answer, &quot;We&#39;re going to Banner&#39;s <br/>
Restaurant, that&#39;s where we are going&quot; ..  Of course, Banners Restaurant was HOME. .. <br/>
We went through this &quot;Banner&#39;s Restaurant&quot; scenario almost every time we took a <br/>
long road trip.   We really knew he wasn&#39;t going to stop.. BUT, sometimes he <br/>
did.stop.  Occasionally, if HE was hungry, he would stop at a restaurant on <br/>
the way home from Grandma&#39;s.  And then we got the &quot;you better not act up in <br/>
here&quot; talk.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, what is the difference that I recall these childhood memories with <br/>
fondness and affection rather than resentment and hostility towards my Daddy?  <br/>
 I think it&#39;s because for all the &quot;wrong things&quot; my Daddy did, he done many <br/>
times over more &quot;right things&quot;   Thank goodness for that, otherwise, I might <br/>
have been scarred for life.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I remember getting yelled at for spilling things.  I also remember <br/>
<br/>
when me and my sis were growing up we could not laugh or talk at the <br/>
<br/>
dinner table.  Well, of course we would end up in the giggles <br/>
<br/>
probably from stress&lt;G&gt; and then get yelled at, maybe spanked.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We had a &quot;don&#39;t sing at the table&quot; rule.<br/>
No singing, no humming.<br/>
<br/>
You might choke.<br/>
<br/>
Once at a restaurant, when I was eight or so, no booster seat, full-size big <br/>
everything, I spilled chocolate milk.  We were with other people, maybe <br/>
another family, I don&#39;t remember.  The waitress wanted to give me another one <br/>
but my mom wouldn&#39;t let her, so I ate with chocolate milk on the table cloth <br/>
around my plate and none to drink. Or I tried to eat, because although I <br/>
don&#39;t remember who all was there (I remember it was kind of dark inside, it <br/>
was Matilda&#39;s, in Espanola, I remember there were about ten people at the two <br/>
tables pushed together), I remember how tight my throat felt from frustration <br/>
and trying not to cry.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I don&#39;t remember who was there because I was too ashamed to look around.<br/>
<br/>
If my mom could get that back and change it, would she?<br/>
