<div id="ygrps-yiv-756496867">Please forgive me for adding yet another O.T. issue to the list -- as I have now<br/>
been &quot;called&quot; to work on relief matters related to the Indian earthquake.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize in advance to anyone on this list who doesn&#39;t think this e-mail<br/>
belongs here.  My one excuse, other than urgency, is that funds from my book and my<br/>
homeschooling-related speaking engagements have funded housing and<br/>
communitydevelopment-related projects in India, so this really is an extension of my<br/>
homeschooling life.  And, frankly, I can&#39;t personally see how responding to a<br/>
natural disaster is NOT an unschooling issue! But please use the delete key if you<br/>
think this is inappropriate.<br/>

<br/>
I thank you very much for asking.  My &quot;family&quot; is in the far south,<br/>
about 1700 miles away, so they are fine.  However, I work with a bunch<br/>
of Gandhian educators (I actually gave a homeschooling speech to an<br/>
incipient homeschooling group there) who work with the poorest of the<br/>
poor in jungly areas about 350 miles to the east of Bhuj, and the<br/>
devastation is grave indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Literally minutes ago, I received the appeal below (through a Quaker<br/>
f(F)riend of mine, just returned from there.) I know each of these<br/>
people personally, some for as long as 25 years.  Funds will not go<br/>
through a big aid agency, I can assure you, but directly to the folks<br/>
who can really use it. If folks would like to contribute, I am<br/>
collecting funds. Tax deductible contributions can be made out to the<br/>
Gandhian Foundation, and sent to me, at:<br/>

We currently don&#39;t have a system for collecting material goods, but I do have an<br/>
inquiry in and report when I hear anything.<br/>
<br/>
Prayers can&#39;t hurt either!<br/>

Friend David,<br/>
        I am forwarding to you a copy of the email just received from<br/>
the<br/>
folks<br/>
in Gujarat who are on the job .  If you agree with me that we have a<br/>
reeeliable channel, then let&#39;s go ahead.  I will set up India Earthquake<br/>
<br/>
Relief Fund 2001 with you and Ellen as members of the &quot;committee&quot;.<br/>
I will seek Gandhian Foundation Board  approval, providing a tax<br/>
deductable channel.  I will also check the bank number in Mulund.<br/>
<br/>
        To Mary Arnett:  The New Delhi Friends Working Group may want<br/>
to  consider using this channel to extend help.  I know the people called, working<br/>
in the spirit of Gandhi.  We can decide at our Feb. 14 meeting.<br/>

FORWARDED --<br/>
<br/>
Dear Friends,<br/>
As all of you probably know already there has been a severe earthquake<br/>
in Gujarat on Friday, flattening huge parts of Kutch, Ahmedabad, and<br/>
Saurashtra.  The impact of the quake, which measure 7.9 on the Richter<br/>
scale is devastating and even worse that estimated as the death tool has<br/>
reach 20,000 people and is continuing to shoot up while the rescue work<br/>
is going on.   Over 100,000 people are supposed to be still under the<br/>
debris.<br/>
<br/>
Already a lot of national as well as foreign volunteers have joined the<br/>
local survivors in their relief efforts.  However, most rescue work is<br/>
centered in the big cities like Bhuj and Ahmedabad while the rural<br/>
people are still waiting for help.  Also, there are not enough doctors<br/>
especially orthopaedic surgeons present to cope the amount of injured<br/>
people.  That way, only the extremely serious cases are being dealt with<br/>
up to this point.  Furthermore, the destroyed infrastructure and<br/>
communication systems make it very difficult to reach the suffering<br/>
people struggling with a shortage of water and food, clothing and<br/>
medication.<br/>
<br/>
We ask you to help.<br/>
Any assistance in form of personal help,<br/>
                               money donation or<br/>
                                   sending needed material is welcome.<br/>
<br/>
We are setting up a group of volunteers consisting of doctors as well as<br/>
people trained in first aid.  Also those who are physically capable of<br/>
helping with relief work are badly needed.  Dr. Roy, Dr. Anita Roy,<br/>
Sidhar, Michael, and Kanti have already left for Rapar, one of the<br/>
three worst affected areas,.  We have mobilized four other teams from<br/>
Maharashtra, MP, and Gujarat so far, and others will be mobilized as<br/>
well, preparing to go there soon.  In Deesa, northeast Gujarat, there is<br/>
a hospital lacking helpers to cope with the number of injured persons.<br/>
<br/>
The relief work will include:<br/>
   &lt;&gt; removing rubble<br/>
   &lt;&gt; rescuing survivors<br/>
   &lt;&gt; dealing with inured<br/>
   &lt;&gt; cremating the dead<br/>
   &lt;&gt; collecting food, water, medicines, and other supplies<br/>
   &lt;&gt; setting up relief camps<br/>
<br/>
Anybody who is physically and emotionally able to deal with these tasks<br/>
please contact us.  It needs to be stressed that the volunteers will be<br/>
confronted with situations that are not easy to bear so do only join if<br/>
you are confident about managing this.<br/>
<br/>
However those who would like to contribute financially would be of great<br/>
<br/>
help as the relief group does not only involve buying medication and<br/>
other material but the team also needs to be self-sufficient due to the<br/>
lack of water and food in the devastated areas.<br/>
<br/>
Foreign contributions may be sent in the name of &quot;Bombay Sarvodaya<br/>
Friendship Centre&quot;, State Bank of India, Mulund West Branch, code No. 011<br/>
<br/>
900, account No. 20702.<br/>
<br/>
If you could donate warm clothing, sleeping bags, blankets, as well as<br/>
dry food and needful things, like torches, we will transport and<br/>
distribute these to the needy.<br/>
