BOSTON - A little-noticed provision in a new federal education law is <br/>
requiring high schools to hand over to military recruiters some key <br/>
information about its juniors and seniors:<br/>
name, address and phone number.<br/>
<br/>
The Pentagon says the information will help it recruit young people <br/>
to defend their country. But the new law disturbs parents and <br/>
administrators in some liberal communities that aren&#39;t exactly gung-<br/>
ho about the armed forces.<br/>
<br/>
Some say the law violates students&#39; privacy and creates a moral <br/>
dilemma over the military&#39;s &#39;&#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39;&#39; policy on gays.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;I find it appalling that the school is sending out letters to do <br/>
the job of the military,&#39;&#39; said Amy Lang, the parent of a student at <br/>
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where Coke was once banned in a <br/>
protest against the soda giant&#39;s investments in apartheid South <br/>
Africa. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s clearly an invasion of my daughter&#39;s privacy.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The No Child Left Behind law, signed last January, pumps billions <br/>
into education but also gives military recruiters access to the <br/>
names, addresses and phone numbers of students in 22,000 schools. The <br/>
law also says that schools must give the military the same access to <br/>
their campuses that businesses and college recruiters enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
School systems that fail to comply could lose federal money. The <br/>
measure also applies to private schools receiving federal funding. <br/>
But Quaker schools and others that have a religious objection to <br/>
military service can get out of the requirement.<br/>
<br/>
Students and parents who oppose the law can keep their information <br/>
from being turned over to the military, but they must sign and return <br/>
an &#39;&#39;opt-out&#39;&#39; form.<br/>
<br/>
The Boston school system, which has 7,500 juniors and seniors, <br/>
included the opt-out notice in a take-home student handbook, but <br/>
fewer than a dozen parents opted out.<br/>
<br/>
So far, 95 percent of the nation&#39;s schools are in compliance, said <br/>
Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Sandra Troeber. She would not identify the <br/>
other schools. But Education Department spokesman Dan Langan said <br/>
that the current focus is on cooperation and that no schools have <br/>
been sanctioned.<br/>
<br/>
Federal law already requires men to register with the Selective <br/>
Service within 30 days of turning 18. The new law, however, enables <br/>
the Pentagon to reach potential recruits when they are 15 or 16.<br/>
<br/>
In New York City, Daniel Alterman was taken aback when his 15-year-<br/>
old son, a junior at Stuyvesant High, received a recruitment letter.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Parents are in the dark,&#39;&#39; Alterman said. &#39;&#39;It freaked me out. I <br/>
didn&#39;t sign up to support the military effort.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Alterman said after he opted out, his son received another letter, <br/>
this one promoting scholarships. &#39;&#39;It was very seductive. They didn&#39;t <br/>
say anything about risk to personal safety,&#39;&#39; Alterman said.<br/>
<br/>
Among those objecting to the new requirements is the New York City <br/>
chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Executive director <br/>
Donna Lieberman said that the opt-out provision is inadequate and <br/>
that schools should be doing more to protect students&#39; privacy.<br/>
<br/>
In a letter last month, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and <br/>
Education Secretary Rod Paige reminded high school administrators of <br/>
their duty, and cited &#39;&#39;the excellent educational opportunities the <br/>
military affords, as well as an environment that encourages the <br/>
development of strong character and leadership skills.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The Pentagon said better access to students could also hold down the <br/>
rising costs of recruitment. Over the past decade, the cost per <br/>
recruit has nearly doubled from $6,500 to $11,600.<br/>
<br/>
Before the law, military recruiters could meet with students in <br/>
Cambridge and Northampton on campus only if the student sought them <br/>
out, and then only at a meeting attended by a guidance counselor. But <br/>
Cambridge held a military career fair at the high school a month ago.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a vast departure from the way we&#39;ve done business,&#39;&#39; said <br/>
Donna Harlan, an associate superintendent in the Northampton school <br/>
system. &#39;&#39;We are not in the business of giving lists of names of kids <br/>
to anybody. That was tough. The issue was if we were to receive <br/>
federal or state money, we had to comply with the law.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The law also spelled the end of a 6-year ban on military recruiting <br/>
on campus in Portland, Ore. After contending that the &#39;&#39;don&#39;t ask, <br/>
don&#39;t tell&#39;&#39; policy discriminates against gays, the school system now <br/>
gives recruiters a shot at its 16,000 students.<br/>
<br/>
In Massachusetts, Framingham High senior April Middleton decided over <br/>
lunch recently that maybe the military is in her future after talking <br/>
with Army National Guard Sgt. Louis Perrin, a recruiter who visited <br/>
the cafeteria.<br/>
<br/>
Middleton, 18, said she plans to enlist after she graduates, and the <br/>
prospect of war has not scared her off. &#39;&#39;Sometimes you&#39;ve got to <br/>
make sacrifices,&#39;&#39; she said.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, however, recruiters battle hostility.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;One teacher said we were trying to brainwash kids. All we were <br/>
doing was handing out pencils,&#39;&#39; Perrin said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re not trying to <br/>
invade anybody&#39;s privacy. We&#39;re just trying to protect their <br/>
freedoms.&#39;&#39;<br/>
