<div id="ygrps-yiv-865068066"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;**I have a hunch we&#39;re talking about different situations.&gt;I&#39;m not talking about a melt down or a tantrum.**&gt;When we started this thread, I thought we were talking about an 8 year&gt;old who was hitting his mother repeatedly, in one incident, despite her&gt;efforts to stop him.  That&#39;s more than just a tiff.&gt;Betsy&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have gotten a little confused trying to keep the different situations straight within this discussion, but the original posting with is the one I would like to respond to.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen many suggestions dealing specifically with the hitting, but I have seen quite a few regarding avoiding the problem beforehand.  This would be ideal, of course, but for those families already dealing with this problem, is there a specific course of action the parent could take when being repeatedly and painfully struck by the child?  I wish I had better answers but, thankfully, we haven&#39;t had this problem crop up so far.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that the hitting would be sufficient cause for intervention of a sort in my home.  This behavior would absolutely not be tolerated at all.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, home should be a **safe** place.  Secondly, I consider intentional hurting of another to be vicious and unacceptable.  I would not allow my significant other to beat me or my children, therefore I will not allow my children to beat others, myself included.<br/>
<br/>
I have physically intervened when a stranger drew back her arm to strike my son (then 3) in a grocery store because he tripped and fell against her legs.  Had she actually succeeded in striking my son, I am quite sure that I would have been facing legal consequences.<br/>
<br/>
I know that some people will take exception to the words &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;tolerate.&quot;  I understand that placing rules and restrictions on others removes some of their freedoms.  I agree, to a point, but feel that just as we have the right to freedom, we also have the right to safety.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When a parent says &quot;I don&#39;t allow my child to say &#39;kill&#39; or &#39;stupid&#39;&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
won&#39;t tolerate video games&quot; that&#39;s not about personal space or safety, that&#39;s <br/>
about control.<br/>
<br/>
When a person says &quot;I don&#39;t tolerate being called names&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they can prevent it, it means they won&#39;t smile wanly and let it continue.<br/>
<br/>
To &quot;tolerate&quot; is to accept tacitly without taking action to stop the <br/>
stimulus.   I don&#39;t think anyone should tolerate what they believe is wrong and bad.   <br/>
Unfortunately in much of the world, children are expected to tolerate TONS of <br/>
nonsense and neglect and abuse just because they&#39;re children.   That makes <br/>
them powerless.    <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think children should be powerless. <br/>
I don&#39;t think parents should be powerless either.<br/>
<br/>
Where consideration and joy are, there&#39;s not a lot of need for power issues, <br/>
power struggles, or other power questions.<br/>
<br/>
I have the power to provide a more peaceful environment for my children than <br/>
I had, and I try to use that power.    I&#39;m not all-powerful. A metor could hit <br/>
the house, a war could break out, the kids could all get some wasting disease <br/>
and it wouldn&#39;t be too peaceful, but their lack of peace won&#39;t come from <br/>
parents or each other.<br/>
