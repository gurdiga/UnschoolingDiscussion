<div id="ygrps-yiv-882928339">A quote I believe is spot on:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I learned...that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic,<br/>
energetic, striving, but it comes to us slowly and quietly and all the time,<br/>
though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start<br/>
flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness.&quot;--Brenda Ueland<br/>
(1891-1985)<br/>
