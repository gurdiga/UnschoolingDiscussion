<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394600525">I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for a few days.  I thought it was high<br/>
time I made an introduction.  My name is Heather.  I have 2 young boys<br/>
ages 9 and 3 and another boy due in July.  I am married to the live of<br/>
my life, TJ (we met at age 12   vomit now  it&#39;s one of those<br/>
disgusting fairy tale stories LOL).  Together we live in VT with our<br/>
Puggle, Linky Soda, and Josie the Pusseycat.  I love politics and<br/>
painting, the boys enjoy sports and video games and cooking, and my<br/>
husband, while a mild mannered IT professional by day, is a superhero<br/>
husband by night.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling since early 2006 and making our way toward<br/>
peaceful parenting shortly thereafter.  Both my husband and I were<br/>
raised in very coercive and controlling environments and have found<br/>
much solace in raising our children the way we always wanted to be<br/>
raised.  <br/>
<br/>
I also co-moderate a group on MySpace with my friend Tara which has<br/>
also turned me into an advice giver instead of receiver.  There are so<br/>
many things I am well versed in, but there is so much more to learn,<br/>
experience, know, so while I grow here, maybe I&#39;ll be helping others<br/>
grow there.  &#61514;  One of those things is message board clarity!  I can&#39;t<br/>
count how many times I have been misunderstood.  Moving on<br/>
<br/>
When my friend Tara sent me the link to this group, I hesitated. <br/>
Because the LAST thing I needed was MORE emails, from MORE yahoo<br/>
groups!  However, I am already enjoying the conversations I am<br/>
reading.  I definitely look for a lot personal exchange of support on<br/>
message boards, since I have a lack of support of other radical<br/>
unschooling families here.  There are other unschoolers, but I would<br/>
say unschooling in the &quot;no curriculum&quot; sort of way.  Not necessarily<br/>
the parenting sort of way.  (Well, that I can tell anyway.)  <br/>
<br/>
The issues that pop up most around here are sibling rivalry, chaos in<br/>
the house, and some real combative behavior from my three year old<br/>
(I&#39;m thinking he might become a boxer &lt;G&gt;).  My children are<br/>
high-spirited and my oldest has been giving me a run for my money<br/>
since birth!  I&#39;m so glad to have found this lifestyle that enabled me<br/>
to reconnect with him.  Our lives have never been the same since! <br/>
Then, pregnancy has sort of added in an irritability factor that I<br/>
thought I had gotten rid of!  So I come to the boards looking for that<br/>
no-nonsense, kick my rear end advice that I know I can&#39;t get anywhere<br/>
else!<br/>
<br/>
OK, I think that&#39;s enough for now!  I look forward to future exchanges<br/>
with all of you.</div>
