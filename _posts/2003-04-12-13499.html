<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066043427"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You REALLY might want to comsider one of the two<br/>
&gt;conferences---one on the west coast and one on the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ooooo, where is the one on the West Coast?  Somehow I<br/>
missed hearing the details of that.  Of course things<br/>
have been kinda crazy round here.  For those<br/>
interested, remember my hubby had a near fatal car<br/>
accident last fall and broke himself up pretty good? <br/>
He&#39;s healing really well, getting stronger all the<br/>
time, with only occassional twinges from the broken<br/>
bones.  <br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that he got laid off from his job<br/>
about a month ago.  He&#39;s working hard to find a new<br/>
job, but this damned war (as I like to call it) is not<br/>
condusive to hiring.  Fortunately we spend less than<br/>
we make and live simply, so we are able to eke by on<br/>
what we had, his retirement savings cashout from his<br/>
job and our tax return.  We&#39;re both looking for part<br/>
time work to keep us afloat before that money runs<br/>
dry, and if another job in his field does not present<br/>
itself before that time.  On the plus side, the boys<br/>
and I are loving having him around all the time, and a<br/>
lot of projects are getting done around the house and<br/>
property.<br/>

Thanks for letting us know.<br/>
<br/>
Last week it crossed my mind and I was hesitant to ask.<br/>
