Duncan has a vocabulary that most college students would envy. Mostly from <br/>
CARTOONS!<br/>
<br/>
He recognizes MANY musical scores---especially opera---from CARTOONS!<br/>
<br/>
He knows state capitals, history, math, physics---TONS of stuff---from <br/>
CARTOONS!<br/>
<br/>
SO many deep discussions about friendships and relationships and bigotry and <br/>
cultures and customs and languages and ANVILS and all SORTS of other stuff <br/>
have begun because of CARTOONS!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s AMAZING that so many people seem intent on bashing cartoons. They&#39;re <br/>
obviously NOT watching them! <br/>

<br/>
Casey and her understanding of cartoon physics vs. earth-bound physics from <br/>
watching Looney Toons?<br/>
<br/>
Conor&#39;s research of the ancient Japanese myth that Dragonball Z is based on?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the stories and 100&#39;s of drawings Casey has made of Hamtarro or her <br/>
love of Edgar Allan Poe that started from a Simpsons episode?<br/>
<br/>
Or how about Conor&#39;s unending fascination with the science and technology of <br/>
robotics that is nurtured through Gundam Wing? He loves trying to design his <br/>
own working robots and checks out Wired, Popular Science and loads of books <br/>
for ideas after wtching this show.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just a few examples of what my kids have done with their cartoon <br/>
exposure. It doesn&#39;t even begin to describe all the wonderful conversations <br/>
we&#39;ve had about cartooning, animation, background music, comic timing, <br/>
slapstick comedy, irony, wordplay, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think cartons are cool. ;-)<br/>

Animal Planet.  It is their choice.  I try to see the value in all TV.  When <br/>
I was young I watched a lot of cartoons as well and my parents let me have <br/>
that choice.  I think I turned out OK.  I guess I believe it is all there for <br/>
them to use.  Cartoons are there like books, and nature walks, the kitchen, <br/>
and LEGOs.  Just one more thing available to them.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Exactly! I am still amazed, after years of watching the cartoons my kids like, how much history, music, foreign language, science, grammer and who know&#39;s how many other things they cram into cartoons these days. I know the ones I used to watch were never like that. My kids come up with things all the time that I know they had to get from tv. And right now, that means mostly cartoons. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618386878">Take Animaniacs...popular children&#39;s cartoon...the<br/>
characters are rude to each other, obnoxious,<br/>
foul-mouthed (they may not swear but that&#39;s beside the<br/>
point); the Simpsons, SouthPark and others are<br/>
marketed to kids when the content is adult...<br/>
<br/>
Yes there are many great cartoons for kids,<br/>
DragonTales, Blue&#39;s Clues, Dora The Explorer; but I<br/>
also find alot of political correctness and whatnot<br/>
being taught that I object to. <br/>
<br/>
For what the kids DO watch, we talk about quite a bit.<br/>
And I&#39;ll admit, there is a difference between what<br/>
I&#39;ll allow and what my husband would allow. For<br/>
example, Yu-Gi-Oh. He sees it as a math game and &quot;just<br/>
fantasy&quot; but while I can see that in it, it also<br/>
promotes fighting and sorcery. <br/>

Sorry if I stirred up a bee&#39;s nest, I don&#39;t mean to<br/>
ruffle feathers. If we don&#39;t approve of something, we<br/>
just turn it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632469591">Egad.  I let my kids watch all sorts of cartoons, from Blues Clues to<br/>
the Simpsons to Spongebob, and they&#39;ve even caught an episode of South<br/>
Park, which didn&#39;t harm them but isn&#39;t on very often in our household<br/>
because I can&#39;t stomach large doses of it (it&#39;s not even the politics of<br/>
it that bother me, but the fact that I don&#39;t enjoy having someone&#39;s<br/>
political opinion shoved down my throat *quite* that much.  I can<br/>
stomach the political commentary of the Simpsons, but South Park is too<br/>
much).  <br/>
 <br/>
But there is one cartoon I&#39;d prefer my kids not watch.  Rocket Power.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not forbidden, but I hate that show. They&#39;ve seen it, and a few<br/>
weeks ago in Borders my son asked for a Rocket Power sticker book and I<br/>
bought it.  But I&#39;d really rather they not watch it, and I&#39;ve<br/>
conveniently found more interesting things to entice them with while<br/>
it&#39;s on.  My complaint about it isn&#39;t religious or moral; it&#39;s simply<br/>
that the kids on the show make fun of reading and learning and being<br/>
smart.  It really irritates me.  But if it was someone&#39;s favorite, I<br/>
guess I&#39;d have to get used to it.<br/>

I am a visual/kinestheic learner and Sarah is an<br/>

making sure she knows how to read? Not at all. I&#39;m<br/>

attendence at a local public school under an IEP for<br/>
language arts tutoring.<br/>
<br/>

took upon myself. I want that for my children as they<br/>
grow older and have a firm foundation of reading,<br/>
writing, mathematics and a basic understanding of<br/>
history and sciences. <br/>
<br/>
I may not be unschooling them at the moment, and we<br/>
may never totally forgo any sort of written<br/>
curriculum, and while we&#39;re totally enjoying the<br/>
curriculum we are using right now I don&#39;t want it to<br/>
be everything they learn from or how; but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that unschooling won&#39;t work for us. <br/>

Those are all examples of learning (ooooh, except maybe that &quot;playing school&quot; <br/>
part!). There does NOT have to ANY &quot;sort of instruction&quot;. There should be <br/>
opportunities---and those are everywhere, staring you in the face, every day <br/>
(and night).<br/>

If he&#39;s surrounded by books and reading, he&#39;ll learn when he&#39;s ready. We <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308990360">From: Elizabeth Roberts <br/>
  &lt;&lt;If there is one thing that I have EVER been passionate<br/>
  about it&#39;s books and reading!!! Censor a book? Nope.<br/>
  Expose them to something inappropriate before they are<br/>
  ready? Nope. Read it with them and discuss it when<br/>
  they are? Absolutely!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  How could you possibly know when your kids are ready for something that they aren&#39;t exposed to so they can chose on their own? You monitor what they can see when they can see it. You could be keeping them from all sorts of interests you may never know they have. And if the time comes that you do introduce these interests to them, you may have missed the window for them when it would have been interesting. And what about things that interest you and not them? Will they have to sit through it because you think they should?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;I do realize that my children may very well have<br/>
    different opinions than me as they grow, and I can<br/>
    handle that. They may enjoy things I wouldn&#39;t at all,<br/>
    so what? We&#39;re different people.Already my oldest,<br/>
    who just turned 7, has stated emphatically that she<br/>
    will NEVER be a reader like I am. I&#39;ve already told<br/>
    her that&#39;s all fine and dandy but she still needs to<br/>
    BE ABLE TO READ.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Opinions are one thing, interests are something totally different. When children are young, one of the best ways to encourage them to find their interests is by providing all sorts of things for them to look at, hear, smell and taste. They are the best judge of what interests them. They pick apart small pieces of what they see and hear to discover their own interests.<br/>
    And did you ever think that by making your daughter read, because YOU say she needs to be able to, is why she feels the way she does about not reading like you?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;I am a visual/kinestheic learner and Sarah is an<br/>
    auditory learner. So what? Am I holding her back by<br/>
    making sure she knows how to read? Not at all. I&#39;m<br/>
    giving her computer software based phonics instruction<br/>
    and everything else we can think of INCLUDING her<br/>
    attendence at a local public school under an IEP for<br/>
    language arts tutoring.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Yes you probably are. By not letting her discover all this on her own, you may very well be squashing her interests and not letting her discover how wonderful it is to learn on one&#39;s own. Just because you really want to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;My best learning experiences growing up were ones I<br/>
    took upon myself. I want that for my children as they<br/>
    grow older and have a firm foundation of reading,<br/>
    writing, mathematics and a basic understanding of<br/>
    history and sciences&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I think we all can agree on what you have said here. But what you say and think seem to be different than what you are telling us you do with your children. If learning and growing on your own were the best experiences, then why restrict tv and make a point to tell you children they really need to read. Probably before they are even ready to do so and are interested in it. I fyou want that for your children, then why not let them have it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;&lt;I may not be unschooling them at the moment, and we<br/>
    may never totally forgo any sort of written<br/>
    curriculum, and while we&#39;re totally enjoying the<br/>
    curriculum we are using right now I don&#39;t want it to<br/>
    be everything they learn from or how; but that doesn&#39;t<br/>
    mean that unschooling won&#39;t work for us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Well no you aren&#39;t unschooling now and if you can&#39;t even see yourself gettting rid of the curriculum, then you won&#39;t ever be unschooling. And it does mean that unschooling won&#39;t work for you. People unschool here every day and it works. When you come into this defending school stuff, not seeing anything else but in school terms, then it seems as if you are unwilling to look at what unschooling really is. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619744893">Reminds me of a story. One day my 3 year old daughter and I were going<br/>
into a store. As we got out of the car she said to me, &quot;Mom, let&#39;s<br/>
pretend there isn&#39;t any gravity in this story.&quot; I was surprised she even<br/>
knew the word. I asked her what would happen to us in that store if we<br/>
didn&#39;t have any gravity to see if she really knew what she was talking<br/>
about and she started in on explaining what it would be like. Her eyes<br/>
were a-blaze and she was so animated!! She told me about how she&#39;s like<br/>
to float around the earth rather than being stuck to it because of<br/>
gravity. She had learned all about gravity from The Magic School Bus. <br/>
 <br/>
This was the beginning of me realizing all the stuff she was learning<br/>
from TV. It has only grown from there.<br/>
 <br/>
One day she came into our room in the night to tell us she had just had<br/>
a nightmare. I asked her to tell me about it and she told me how a<br/>
capybara (sp?) was chasing her. I had never heard of a capybara before<br/>
and started asking her questions about it...and she looked at me like I<br/>
was an idiot and finally said, &quot;Mom, do you know what I&#39;m talking<br/>
about?&quot; I told her I didn&#39;t know what a capybara is and she kindly<br/>
explained what kind of animal it was, and how it walked and what it ate,<br/>
etc. She had learned about this on Zaboomafoo. I had never even heard of<br/>
the darn thing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471895762">Yes, that&#39;s a favorite of Sarah&#39;s right now. Another<br/>
was Wishbone, it had been a good program although not<br/>
animated. I wouldn&#39;t mind reruns of that one!<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Am I the only one who is mourning the departure of Steve from Blue&#39;s clues?  <br/>
  I can&#39;t relax with Joe; he smiles too much.  He&#39;s like one of those animated <br/>
  characters where the sun keeps glinting off his teeth.  I don&#39;t trust him, <br/>
  and I miss Steve.  And I&#39;m not just saying this because I have a pneumonia <br/>
  induced fever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  No you are not alone. My kids watched Blue&#39;s Clues when they were little. It was always Steve. Then recently my Alyssa discovered tv and also Blue&#39;s Clues. Well Joseph and Sierra started watching it along with her. They also have a renewed interest in Dora too. Anyway, none of us like Joe. (from tv not to be confused with my husband!) I can&#39;t really put my finger on what it is.....but I know it&#39;s not Steve. Even Alyssa prefers Steve and she was totally new to this. Luckily here we still have more Steve shows than Joe. I&#39;m sure they are reruns but since my kids stopped watching a while ago, they are all new to us!!!<br/>
