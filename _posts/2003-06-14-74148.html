&gt; bad, you know what I mean. Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>
&gt; relationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; he&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; breath now. Thank-you to anyone that can pass some wisdom to us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t change your parents or your in-laws. You CAN change YOUR lives. <br/>
Make yourselves haoppy. Maybe after a while they&#39;ll see your happiness and join <br/>
in. <br/>
<br/>
To me, part of Unschooling is about showing our children that we have the <br/>
ability to make ourselves happy. To pursue our dreams. <br/>
<br/>
Making yourselves miserable in order to make someone else happy isn&#39;t <br/>
right---and the parents and in-laws seem to think that their misery NEEDS YOUR <br/>
company.<br/>
<br/>
If the grandparents REALLY won&#39;t speak to their grandson because he <br/>
MOVES---what kind of grandparents are they anyway? THAT&#39;S selfish! And just plain MEAN. <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want my boys to be around someone like that! Much less plan our <br/>
lives around them.<br/>
<br/>
Get on with your lives---the move sounds wonderful! They&#39;ll come around. Or <br/>
not. Their decision.<br/>
