&lt;&lt; <br/>
 just thought someone here might be able to recommend a place to start<br/>
 for an adult wanting to learn about arthurian legend.  i read The<br/>
 Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley and really liked it... more<br/>
 for its beautiful vision of goddess culture and its writing.   it was<br/>
 also very easy to get lost in the story.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, The Mists of Avalon was made into a movie.<br/>
Not an astoundingly well made one, but fun to watch anyway. Some cool scenes <br/>
and costuming. Lots of the Pagan rituals, which were very educational for me!<br/>
<br/>
What was that movie with Richard Gere? Knights of the Round Table? Can&#39;t <br/>
remember.<br/>
Or maybe it was just Camelot. Something along those lines. I&#39;ll look it up if <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t beat me to it.<br/>
<br/>

And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love the book and reread it probably once a year.  But the movie <br/>
was so astoundingly bad (I know I have the minority opinion here).  <br/>
The only thing it had going for it was Joan Allen as Morgause.  And <br/>
to not even have the second Merlin or Nimue *at all* was <br/>
inexplicable.  They are key players in how the story turns out.<br/>
<br/>
I loved the Sam Neill movie (my video tape of it finally wore out), <br/>
but I didn&#39;t like the way they portrayed Morgan le Fay in that one.  <br/>
It was almost like Queen Mab was the Morgan le Fay character and <br/>
Morgan was superfluous.  I did love Mab though! (But why one earth <br/>
was she even in it???)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see a balanced Arthurian legend.  One where neither side <br/>
is portrayed as explicitly &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  <br/>
Where Merlin and Morgan are co-protagonists and the circumstances are <br/>
the antagonists.  And I&#39;d like an Arthur who isn&#39;t a wuss (Sean <br/>
Connery was a decent Arthur but way too old). <br/>
<br/>
For some reason, my favorite character is always Mordred.  Poor kid.  <br/>
He&#39;s not the bad guy; he&#39;s an abused and neglected child!<br/>

I agree with you.<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to trash the movie, because I still think it&#39;s fun to watch if <br/>
your expectations aren&#39;t too high.<br/>
Pity too...it could have been a GREAT film.<br/>
Poor character development and too much focus on the Priestess/rituals aspect <br/>
(although educational for me) left it an overall poorly developed movie.<br/>
It&#39;s too bad.  I&#39;d still recommend it for someone fascinated with that time <br/>
period/legend.<br/>

People aren&#39;t &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.  Many stories have a hero who isn&#39;t <br/>
good or evil.  Scarlett O&#39;Hara isn&#39;t good or evil.  That&#39;s why her <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gag.  Political correctness??  That&#39;s not my idea at all.  I&#39;m <br/>
picturing a story with powerful, fully human characters.  Not &quot;good <br/>
guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;.  I think a movie version would be more powerful <br/>
if the characters were fuller and less &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Gone with the Wind is a great movie, but it&#39;s another example of a poor <br/>
<br/>
adaptation of an amazing book ~ I read first then saw the movie, at &lt;gasp&gt; 25 <br/>
<br/>
~ I was sooooo sad!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I watched it for the first time last summer, and wasn&#39;t impressed.  No doubt <br/>
when it came out it was a biggest-ever deal, and there were still people <br/>
living who had been involved some in the civil war, and it wasn&#39;t so dated.<br/>

  Cerrridwen is Welsh (I&#39;m not her, but I know a lot about the name).  <br/>
  It means &quot;white poetry&quot; or better translated, &quot;bright inspiration&quot;.  <br/>
  Someone (Robert Graves?) mistranslated it as &quot;white sow&quot; and some <br/>
  people are under the mistaken impression that she was a pig!  She <br/>
  wasn&#39;t.  She&#39;s a character from the Mabinoginon, who has a cauldron <br/>
  of inspiration.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Tell me about your name: Cerridwen. Sounds Celtic or Welsh. My<br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter loves all things Celtic, Gaelic, or Welsh! L I used to call<br/>
&gt; &gt; her an Anglophile, until she informed me that she doesn&#39;t really love<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone who subdued the Irish so fiercely as they were subdued by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; English.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Guess she dunt like the Scots then either. Mind you, the Irish, English, <br/>
&gt;Cornish n Welsh fight like abag of ferrets :-)<br/>
&gt;As for the C word.....<br/>
