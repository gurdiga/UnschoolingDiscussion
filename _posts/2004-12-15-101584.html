<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544660559">Please help me.  I&#39;m shaking and crying.  I just blew up at my kids <br/>
big time.  I&#39;m just sick.<br/>
<br/>
Background-4 kids-ds9, ds7, ds5, dd2<br/>
Have homeschooled all along.  I&#39;ve always been relaxed, but gradually <br/>
shifted to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My kids fight all the time.  I repeat, all the time.  They fight over <br/>
everything.  I&#39;m going insane.  Here are examples just from today:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on the couch reading to dd2 while ds7 is building with blocks at <br/>
my feet.  Dd5 comes into the room sort of walking/wiggling/being a <br/>
little boy.  As he gets closer to me I say, &quot;Be Careful of ds7&#39;s <br/>
tower.&quot;  At that point he wiggles his hips extra hard and his leg <br/>
knocks over the whole thing.  Ds7 jumps on him from behind and <br/>
tackles him.  &quot;How come you knocked over my tower??!!!&quot;  (hit, <br/>
hit)  &quot;Leave my stuff alone&quot; (hit,hit)  Ds5 starts sobbing.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sitting down and ds7 comes over to show me something he just read <br/>
in a magazine. While he&#39;s talking to me ds5 comes and leans on ds7 <br/>
hard enough for him to fall over.  I said `Please stop&#39;.  He didn&#39;t, <br/>
knocked ds7 over, ds7 got up and kicked ds5.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making brownies as we&#39;re going to a friend&#39;s house for supper.  <br/>
I&#39;m starting the filling and ds9 calls &quot;Can I like the filling bowl <br/>
when you&#39;re done?&quot; I say yes.  Ds7 pipes up &quot;Hey, I want to lick the <br/>
filling bowl.&quot;  I say &quot;You can lick the frosting bowl when I make <br/>
that this afternoon.&quot;  Ds5 says &quot;Hey that&#39;s not fair!  I want <br/>
something to lick.&quot;  I say &quot;Well you can help me make the frosting.&quot;  <br/>
OK everything seems fine.<br/>
<br/>
I make the filling, give the bowl to ds9.  Ds7 says &quot;can&#39;t I have <br/>
just a little?&quot;  &quot;No!&quot; says ds9, &quot;Mom said I could have it.&quot;  Later <br/>
when I give the frosting bowl to ds7, ds 5 starts crying &quot;How come I <br/>
don&#39;t have anything to lick?&quot;  I ask ds7 if he&#39;d like to share.  Of <br/>
course, he wouldn&#39;t.  Now dd2 starts cryingshe wants to lick <br/>
something.  I have nothing more to offer!  Everyone is mad.<br/>
<br/>
Later.<br/>
<br/>
Dd2 asks for a poptart.  I say yes and get it for her.  There&#39;s two <br/>
left in the package.  (you already know what&#39;s coming, right?)  I <br/>
hand her one; she asks for the other.  She has never, never, never <br/>
eaten more than one pop tart, she gets too full.  I tell her to eat <br/>
the first one and then we&#39;ll see if she&#39;s still hungry.  At that <br/>
point ds5 grabs the second pop tart off the counter and runs way <br/>
shouting &quot;It&#39;s mine It&#39;s mine.  I&#39;m having this pop tart.&quot;  Dd 2 <br/>
starts screaming.  I asked ds5 to please give the pop tart back to me <br/>
and we&#39;d try to work something out.  &quot;No&quot; he says and turns around to <br/>
try to hold it out of my reach. I try to grab it and think `this is <br/>
crazy, I&#39;m not going to get into a grabbing match with a 5yo.&quot;  Now <br/>
ds7 is crying there&#39;s no pop tarts left for him and I know ds9 is <br/>
going to throw a huge fit (crying, stomping) when he gets home from a <br/>
friend&#39;s house and sees there aren&#39;t any left.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I could go buy more Pop tarts at the store, but I couldn&#39;t <br/>
go this exact minute and when would it end.  How many pop tarts would <br/>
I have to buy to make everyone happy?<br/>
<br/>
I finally just blew up and yelled and stomped out of the room and <br/>
into my bedroom where I locked the door.  Not the most mature thing, <br/>
but I was scared I was going to abuse my children if I didn&#39;t leave <br/>
the room NOW.<br/>
<br/>
This is just a small sampling.  It&#39;s all the time.  Fighting over <br/>
everything, being so cruel to one another.  Sometimes I feel they&#39;d <br/>
be better off on a ps playground then home with siblings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read these boards for years.  I try to breathe.  I say Yes <br/>
whenever I can.  I try to be gentle and calm.  I try to give everyone <br/>
tons of attention.  I&#39;m just stretched too thin.  I feel as if <br/>
someone is always whining or crying or complaining or grumbling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at the end of my rope.  Sandra, Ren, Kelly, others.please help.<br/>
Sorry if you are reading this more than once.  I&#39;m going to post it <br/>
on a few boards.<br/>

&gt; Please help me.  I&#39;m shaking and crying.  I just blew up at my kids <br/>
&gt; big time.  I&#39;m just sick.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Background-4 kids-ds9, ds7, ds5, dd2<br/>
&gt; Have homeschooled all along.  I&#39;ve always been relaxed, but gradually <br/>
&gt; shifted to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids fight all the time.  I repeat, all the time.  They fight over <br/>
&gt; everything.  I&#39;m going insane. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that perhaps what is happening is that you are trying to be fair all the time <br/>
and the kids are holding you to it. But what happens is that they want more than fair so <br/>
they are pushing your limits to see what happens. I keep thinking of the Faber and <br/>
Mazlisch books, especially Siblings Without Rivalry.<br/>
<br/>
somethien we&#39;ve done which is extremely time-consuming and yet has a high yield (and <br/>
we&#39;ve done it since they were very young), is take upset parties to the couch. We seat them <br/>
opposite each other and have each one share what is bothering him/ her. The speaker <br/>
gets uninterrupted time to say what he or she feels. The listener needs to hear all the <br/>
words and say back what is bothering the first one. If he or she misunderstands, the <br/>
speaker gets to make corrections.<br/>
<br/>
Then you reverse it so that the other child now gets to speak and hear her/his words fed <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
Once both have spoken and have head each other&#39;s powerful feelings, it&#39;s time for you to <br/>
ask questions that would help them discover how they would have liked to be treated <br/>
differently, or they can brainstorm solutions for future episodes, or they can simply let go <br/>
(sometimes just airing the feelings is enough).<br/>
<br/>
The reason it is time consuming is that sometimes it means being late to a meeting or <br/>
appointment, sometimes they won&#39;t hear each other and try to shout over each other. <br/>
When that happens, we usually separate them for a few minutes and then bring them back <br/>
together again when they are calmer.<br/>
<br/>
The brainstorming time is when you can suggest ideas too, but beware of solving it for <br/>
them. Kids are sensitive to parents taking over and making things unfair again. Stay <br/>
focused on the feelings.<br/>
<br/>
So, in the pop tart instance, it might be that one of the kids would say that it is unfair that <br/>
the little sister gets the second pop tart reserved for her when she won&#39;t really eat or finish <br/>
it. She might say that she likes having two because it&#39;s a complete package.<br/>
<br/>
Once they have heard each other, it&#39;s time to help them think through how to address <br/>
both those concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Might it have worked to ask for the second one as a favor? Might it have worked to split <br/>
the second one? Might it work better next time for you to declare that you are about to <br/>
give a pop tart to the sister and no one may take it or ask for it, but that you are ready to <br/>
offer other snacks to whoever is hungry?<br/>
<br/>
For stubborn kids who refuse to see anyone else&#39;s viewpoint, there is usually a longer term <br/>
issue underneath it. Sometimes there is anger in the home or there is a feeling of <br/>
uncertainty or desperation that is mainfesting in sibling relationships. We had this a bit <br/>
when my oldest was bullied on our street. He would come home one down and that would <br/>
trigger some of his behavior that was less gentle.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who deliberately destroy a sibling&#39;s tower need some time alone with you to talk <br/>
through why that was a satisfying thing to do - what the goal was. It may take revisiting <br/>
this issue multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
Recently one of my kids wouldn&#39;t allow his sibling onto the X Box and even when we <br/>
showed him that in the reverse situation, he&#39;d want the same courtesy, he replied, &quot;I only <br/>
care about what benefits me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, I took him off the X Box to have a chat with me about values and human <br/>
beings and what it means to demonstrate concern for others and what it means to care <br/>
only for self. I imagine this is not the last time we&#39;ll have this talk. :) But I don&#39;t want to <br/>
ignore it, either.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps.<br/>

 <br/>
It sounds like maybe ds5 has no concept of personal space issues.  Have you ever explained to him -- maybe at a time before an incident happens, or maybe as a habitual reminder for that child -- about personal space issues?  Andy (8) tends to bump into people, and he crowds people, too.  For him, it&#39;s partly a sensory issue and as such he just doesn&#39;t get that other people have greater needs for personal space than he does.  It may take regular attention on your part to remind him to give others a wide berth.  It also might help to have him deal with the aftermath as a real consequence. When he knocked over the tower, did he pick up the blocks, or help his brother re-build?  Was he expected to?  Knowing he&#39;ll be responsible for damages may encourage him to be more careful and considerate of others.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also found that with Andy, speaking to him isn&#39;t always enough, especially when he&#39;s excited or wound up in some way.  I reach out and place my hand on his arm or back (leg if he&#39;s sitting) as I speak to him -- it sort of re-centers his energy so he can pay attention to what&#39;s happening outside of himself.<br/>

  ****All I can say is this happens in my house also. We also talk about being nice and doing unto others and if you don&#39;t like to be hit then it&#39;s not nice to hit your sister etc. As a matter of fact my middle two were fighting today, we discussed it, I guess repitition and modeling are good ways to go. I also try to be proactive not reactive and I pray hard, I usually only yell when my hormones are raging which is what happened today. After it&#39;s all said and done we discuss it, talking is the best advice I can give, my kids are almost the same as yours, 9, 6, 5 and 2.  I too have run to my room stomping, you are not alone. Of course then they all show up at my door &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s normal for us to feel &quot;sick&quot; when we know that what we did was not <br/>
so hot.  Guilt is there for a reason, take the guilt and go with it. <br/>

even sisters who are being a pain.  This has been rule from day one and <br/>
the girls never hit each other.  They occassionally get rough, but it&#39;s <br/>
rare and immediately stopped (usually be the girls).  Occassionally <br/>
Janene hits me, when angry, and I simply hold her hands and say &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
to be hit, I don&#39;t like to be hit, I don&#39;t hit you when I am angry, you <br/>
cannot hit me, etc.&quot; and then I bring her into my arms and love her and <br/>
hold her tight ( hard to hit if you are being hugged tightly and <br/>
lovingly). <br/>
<br/>
The word NO is not a bad word.  It can be your friend.  Say NO once in a <br/>
while.  Not a lot, mind you.  We negotiate, and compromise and I say yes <br/>
probably 99% of the time, but No is a word I can use and do use. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use time out in our house but we do take it a lot.  I take a <br/>
time out, to regroup, to breath, to just take a few minutes for myself, <br/>
and I teach my children to do the same.  When the girls are having a <br/>
tough time together, I encourage time apart.  And there is NO HITTING OR <br/>
HURTING.  Ever.  Period.  By anyone.  by mom or dad or lexie or janene. <br/>
<br/>
If Janene is loosing it we, she and I, go into another quiet room <br/>
together and cuddle and talk.  Lexie and I will do the same, although <br/>
she rarely looses it in the same manner.  Lexie needs a different type <br/>
of time, usually a big bear hug holding her tight will help her regain <br/>
her emotions.  Janene needs more space, most of the time, and so we have <br/>
to leave the room for a bit so she can have that space.  Also, she needs <br/>
to vent and then calm down and then can talk about solutions.  Lexie can <br/>
be hugged and then the solutions can help her to calm down, to see that <br/>
there are other options, choices, ideas. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like your five year old needed some attention, too.  <br/>
Sometimes if you can figure out what the need was, you can prevent the <br/>
behavior.  One thing we do is talk about it afterwards.... Here are some <br/>
questions we use..<br/>
<br/>
what happened? <br/>
<br/>
Do you know why that happened?  (sometimes they can figure it out, <br/>
sometimes they have no clue, you might help them out, were you feeling <br/>
like you need mommy and you didn&#39;t like it that your brother was <br/>
there?--this question can often not be answered...)<br/>
<br/>
How could you have handled it differently?  How could *I*, the <br/>
mom/dad/adult, have handled it differently? <br/>
<br/>
Next time how could we handle this situation so the outcome would be <br/>
different?  (Sometimes you have to give them the words to say, instead <br/>
of the kick... instead you could say &quot;mom I really need your attention <br/>
now please.) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Later.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m making brownies as we&#39;re going to a friend&#39;s house for supper. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m starting the filling and ds9 calls &quot;Can I like the filling bowl<br/>
&gt; when you&#39;re done?&quot; I say yes.  Ds7 pipes up &quot;Hey, I want to lick the<br/>
&gt; filling bowl.&quot;  I say &quot;You can lick the frosting bowl when I make<br/>
&gt; that this afternoon.&quot;  Ds5 says &quot;Hey that&#39;s not fair!  I want<br/>
&gt; something to lick.&quot;  I say &quot;Well you can help me make the frosting.&quot; <br/>
&gt; OK everything seems fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They couldn&#39;t share?  You could&#39;nt have made a 2nd bowl for the other <br/>
child? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I make the filling, give the bowl to ds9.  Ds7 says &quot;can&#39;t I have<br/>
&gt; just a little?&quot;  &quot;No!&quot; says ds9, &quot;Mom said I could have it.&quot;  Later<br/>
&gt; when I give the frosting bowl to ds7, ds 5 starts crying &quot;How come I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have anything to lick?&quot;  I ask ds7 if he&#39;d like to share.  Of<br/>
&gt; course, he wouldn&#39;t.  Now dd2 starts crying...she wants to lick<br/>
&gt; something.  I have nothing more to offer!  Everyone is mad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s lickable, then why not make a bit more and let everyone have a <br/>
bit of everything.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Later.<br/>

&gt; Dd2 asks for a poptart.  I say yes and get it for her.  There&#39;s two<br/>

&gt; hand her one; she asks for the other.  She has never, never, never<br/>
&gt; eaten more than one pop tart, she gets too full.  I tell her to eat<br/>
&gt; the first one and then we&#39;ll see if she&#39;s still hungry.  At that<br/>
&gt; point ds5 grabs the second pop tart off the counter and runs way<br/>
&gt; shouting &quot;It&#39;s mine It&#39;s mine.  I&#39;m having this pop tart.&quot;  Dd 2<br/>
&gt; starts screaming.  I asked ds5 to please give the pop tart back to me<br/>
&gt; and we&#39;d try to work something out.  &quot;No&quot; he says and turns around to<br/>
&gt; try to hold it out of my reach. I try to grab it and think `this is<br/>
&gt; crazy, I&#39;m not going to get into a grabbing match with a 5yo.&quot;  Now<br/>
&gt; ds7 is crying there&#39;s no pop tarts left for him and I know ds9 is<br/>
&gt; going to throw a huge fit (crying, stomping) when he gets home from a<br/>

other things... attention? <br/>

mature. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110477736">Fonty,<br/>
<br/>
Let me first say that I is HARD WORK to take good care of several young <br/>
children at once, and that in my experience, it gets much easier as <br/>
they get older. So take heart--it won&#39;t be like this forever.<br/>
<br/>
Anything you can do to reduce the pressure for the next few years will <br/>
help: relax even more on housework standards, reduce obligations to be <br/>
places at scheduled times, cut back on responsibilities outside the <br/>
family, make sure you fit in time to do something relaxing for you on a <br/>
regular basis,...<br/>
<br/>
I have a suggestion that might help in some of the situations you gave: <br/>
instead of you deciding what&#39;s fair, help the kids decide.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, with the brownie situation, as soon as more than one <br/>
child wants to lick the bowl, stop and present the problem to them: <br/>
&quot;Two (or three or four) people want to lick the bowl. What can we do?&quot; <br/>
At first, you may need to suggest lots of solutions, until they get <br/>
practice doing it. These solutions might be: sharing the bowl, making <br/>
more batter so there&#39;s lots, an even more exciting thing to eat for one <br/>
or more children, one licking the frosting bowl later in the day, ... <br/>
The key is to make sure everyone is happy before implementing a <br/>
solution. This gets the kids starting to do this kind of <br/>
problem-solving for themselves, and the family expectation starts to be <br/>
that everyone is happy with a solution. Now of course everyone won&#39;t <br/>
always be happy, but that&#39;s what you want to aim for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106503199">-=I finally just blew up and yelled and stomped out of the room and <br/>
<br/>
into my bedroom where I locked the door.  Not the most mature thing, <br/>
<br/>
but I was scared I was going to abuse my children if I didn&#39;t leave <br/>
<br/>
the room NOW.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not so bad.  Maybe depends what you yelled, but declaring that you&#39;re <br/>
really angry and tired of the whole deal and can&#39;t believe they fight so  much <br/>
and slamming a door isn&#39;t so bad.  I hope it&#39;s not, because I&#39;ve done it <br/>
myself a couple of times in the past couple of months.   Yeah, could&#39;ve been <br/>
better, but could have been worse.  <br/>
<br/>
But the real better thing to do is to see what you can do to make things <br/>
better in the future:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I suppose I could go buy more Pop tarts at the store, but I couldn&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
go this exact minute and when would it end.  How many pop tarts would <br/>
<br/>
I have to buy to make everyone happy? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Enough that nobody is entirely left out.<br/>
If you bought chicken strips or french fries would you give them all to one <br/>
kid, or to all the kids but one?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Dd2 asks for a poptart.  I say yes and get it for her.  There&#39;s two <br/>
<br/>
left in the package.  (you already know what&#39;s coming, right?) -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids would be okay with this, but they&#39;re older and they&#39;ve had years of <br/>
knowing there will be more.   I still sometimes ask if someone else minds if <br/>
Holly has the last of something.  Or if someone else is around and one&#39;s making <br/>
Ramen or something it will usually be offered (two packs cooked instead of <br/>
one).  And the kids will offer too, not just me, because I modelled it for years <br/>
and suggested it for years.<br/>
<br/>
That sharing can come, but until then you need to be the one who oversees <br/>
fairness.  And fairness doesn&#39;t mean measuring or counting, it means <br/>
consideration.<br/>
<br/>
With licking a bowl, leave enough on the beaters or spoons that others can <br/>
get something, or get another whole spoon and get some on that too.  Giving the <br/>
whole thing to one kid seems to be a parental error, not kid-unreasonability.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As he gets closer to me I say, &quot;Be Careful of ds7&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
tower.&quot;  At that point he wiggles his hips extra hard and his leg <br/>
<br/>
knocks over the whole thing.  Ds7 jumps on him from behind and <br/>
<br/>
tackles him.  &quot;How come you knocked over my tower??!!!&quot;  (hit, <br/>
<br/>
hit)  &quot;Leave my stuff alone&quot; (hit,hit)  Ds5 starts sobbing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a harder one.   I would&#39;ve gotten the younger one to sit by me and <br/>
told the older one that I would&#39;ve been on his side entirely if he hadn&#39;t jumped <br/>
up and tackled and hit.  And then I would&#39;ve asked the midkid if he did it on <br/>
purpose or accidentally, and talk about prevention of accidents.   Accident <br/>
doesn&#39;t excuse total carelessness.   Me being me, I would probably talk about <br/>
the difference between murder and manslaughter and tell them people can go to <br/>
prison for manslaughter too.   And that would be distracting enough and meable <br/>
enough th<br/>
Z*at in the future he might consider &quot;blockslaughter&quot; and not walk within <br/>
touching-distance of others&#39; block towers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-While he&#39;s talking to me ds5 comes and leans on ds7 <br/>
<br/>
hard enough for him to fall over.  I said `Please stop&#39;.  He didn&#39;t, <br/>
<br/>
knocked ds7 over, ds7 got up and kicked ds5.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The seven year old seems to be feeling crowded.  Maybe you need some time <br/>
with just him, to discuss being older and feeling displaced.  Be sympathetic.  <br/>
YOU kept him from being the youngest before he was ready to give that up.   I <br/>
used to tell Kirby that his  being mean and physical with Marty didn&#39;t make him <br/>
or Marty better people, and it was making my own life harder.  He could <br/>
understand that.  He didn&#39;t always consider it foremost when he was about to hit, <br/>
but sometimes he did.   <br/>
<br/>
When you talk to an older child, don&#39;t mention how much you love the younger <br/>
children or that they&#39;re just as important.  Lean toward how much you love HIM <br/>
and then act it, too.  I was a firstborn and really resented my sister and <br/>
the attention she got when she came along.  Any messages that I was wrong to <br/>
feel that just made me dislike my mom more, and resent it more.  I was dumped for <br/>
a new kid, that was all.  And I bet your kids, being so near in age, feel <br/>
that too.  And the seven year old doesn&#39;t even have the comfort of being oldest.  <br/>
Find special attentions for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215742914">There has been some great advice given here on this whole matter. There&#39;s<br/>
only one more thing I can think of to help. Seems like the actions here with<br/>
your children can be pretty predictable now. I can almost tell all the time<br/>
with my kids when a problem is coming now. Head it off.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that child just really wants to see that tower of blocks come<br/>
crashing down no matter who built it or how much trouble they could possibly<br/>
get into. Jumping up or running over and scooping up the child ahead of time<br/>
with hugs and kisses can do the trick. Or even talking about how cool it<br/>
would be to see that tower fall but so and so would be upset. Then build a<br/>
tower yourself for knocking over. Sometimes it takes just minutes to thwart<br/>
the oncoming problem. Actually even seconds. And that&#39;s not so bad a time to<br/>
take away from what you were doing to maintain peace.<br/>
<br/>
Same with food and toys and such. Plenty of time there is only one bagel<br/>
when 2 kids want one. Share. And then my kids know right away that the item<br/>
is on my list for next time shopping. When something is the last, I comment<br/>
on it right away. Telling each child this is it and so and so is having it<br/>
or asking if anyone wants to partake of the last of it. The kids know more<br/>
is coming and appreciate being considered.<br/>
<br/>
Heading off the bad stuff when you know it&#39;s coming is more than half the<br/>
solution in my opinion. After awhile of that, the kids can do it themselves.<br/>
They see less problems and can figure out solutions on their own after<br/>
having help with it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201051216">Fonty, <br/>
i only have two small kids 3.5 and 10 months and it is<br/>
soooooo hard for me somedays.  You are a superwoman of<br/>
sorts to me.  Please find time each day to celebrate<br/>
the things that you have done well.  You deserve a pat<br/>
on the back, also forgive yourself for the things that<br/>
you are trying to change in the household.  From what<br/>
I hear from mommies in your situation- IT TAKES TIME. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think you are awesome from what I can read!  Is<br/>
there any way that you could steal time alone each<br/>
day?  That might help doing something that makes you<br/>
happy- that is just yours.  Sometimes I feel like the<br/>
world believes I do not deserve that time, and I fel<br/>
guilty when I want it, but then I remember that this<br/>
is the most important job (for me) and that in order<br/>
to give my best I must rejuvenate myself.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if this is possible, but if it is get out of the<br/>
house by yourself every now and then!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a bit, <br/>
Gia<br/>
<br/>
Rachel, <br/>
that was great advice about trying to help them solve<br/>
the problems.  I will have to use that when my boys<br/>
are a bit older. :)<br/>

&gt; regular basis,...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a suggestion that might help in some of the<br/>
&gt; situations you gave: <br/>
&gt; instead of you deciding what&#39;s fair, help the kids<br/>
&gt; decide.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For instance, with the brownie situation, as soon as<br/>
&gt; more than one <br/>
&gt; child wants to lick the bowl, stop and present the<br/>
&gt; problem to them: <br/>
&gt; &quot;Two (or three or four) people want to lick the<br/>
&gt; bowl. What can we do?&quot; <br/>
&gt; At first, you may need to suggest lots of solutions,<br/>
&gt; until they get <br/>
&gt; practice doing it. These solutions might be: sharing<br/>
&gt; the bowl, making <br/>
&gt; more batter so there&#39;s lots, an even more exciting<br/>
&gt; thing to eat for one <br/>
&gt; or more children, one licking the frosting bowl<br/>
&gt; later in the day, ... <br/>
&gt; The key is to make sure everyone is happy before<br/>
&gt; implementing a <br/>
&gt; solution. This gets the kids starting to do this<br/>
&gt; kind of <br/>
&gt; problem-solving for themselves, and the family<br/>
&gt; expectation starts to be <br/>
&gt; that everyone is happy with a solution. Now of<br/>
&gt; course everyone won&#39;t <br/>
&gt; always be happy, but that&#39;s what you want to aim<br/>
&gt; for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Fonty - read the above again. THIS, along with adult modeling kindness <br/>
and consideration and generosity, is the key to the future being way <br/>
easier.<br/>
<br/>
Also - separate, in your head, at least, the process of coming up with <br/>
LOTS of possible solutions and the picking of which one solution you&#39;re <br/>
going to try.<br/>
<br/>
So  with the this licking the bowl situation - as soon as the second <br/>
kid said, &quot;I want it too,&quot; then you say, &quot;Brainstorming time - how many <br/>
ways can we think of to handle this?&quot; (Notice - how many ways - not <br/>
asking for one single way.)<br/>
<br/>
AND - you let the &quot;ways&quot; be goofy ones, too. Here are some that you and <br/>
they might come up with:<br/>
<br/>
Take turns - each of us gets a lick, one after the other.<br/>
Give it to the dog and let him lick the whole thing and WE have <br/>
something else.<br/>
Mom scrape it off into separate bowls or on separate spoons so we each <br/>
get one.<br/>
Johnny gets to lick the bowl but &quot;I&quot; get an extra brownie when they&#39;re <br/>
done.<br/>
We go to the store and get more brownie mix and we don&#39;t cook them, we <br/>
JUST eat the batter.<br/>
Put peanuts in the bowl and smush them all around so they get brownie <br/>
mix on them and then divide up the peanuts.<br/>
<br/>
And so on --- no idea too silly - the goal to have LOTS of ideas. VERY <br/>
often one of the ideas will just spontaneously be acceptable to all and <br/>
you&#39;re done.<br/>
<br/>
If none are acceptable - it is WORTH it to take some time to choose one <br/>
- you&#39;re NOT deciding how to handle the bowl-licking problem - you&#39;re <br/>
helping them learn problem solving skills that will be probably the <br/>
most useful thing they ever learn.<br/>
<br/>
Being &quot;solution-oriented&quot; is a way of life. There are people who see <br/>
problems as obstacles and get upset by them and lose their cool in <br/>
their frustration and they end up angry. And there are people who see <br/>
problems as opportunities to be creative and they&#39;re challenged by them <br/>
and they end up feeling positive and energized. Which of those do you <br/>
want your kids to be?<br/>
<br/>
Some of this is innate temperament, I think, so some of us have to work <br/>
harder to be solution-oriented than others, but that&#39;s just the way it <br/>
is - it CAN be done.<br/>
<br/>
I made &quot;solution-oriented&quot; my mantra. Seriously. I&#39;ve probably repeated <br/>
it to myself a million times since I became a parent. I now hear it in <br/>
my head the MINUTE there is a problem - and it reminds me that there <br/>
are always lots of potential solutions. It keeps me from sort of <br/>
&quot;freezing up&quot; and feeling stuck and lets me keep MY cool and do <br/>
something more creative than I could otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
For example, my natural inclination might be to simply say to the other <br/>
kid, &quot;He asked first; you can have it next time.&quot; Well gee - THAT could <br/>
set off world war III in my house - why is asking &quot;first&quot; the deciding <br/>
factor AND my kids know that we&#39;ll never remember who was supposed to <br/>
get it &quot;next time&quot; and that could be far away and so on. Just because <br/>
one kid asked &quot;first&quot; - that isn&#39;t necessarily a good reason he/she <br/>
should get it - maybe the other kid wants it MORE or maybe the other <br/>
kid didn&#39;t ask first because he wasn&#39;t there TO ask or maybe a younger <br/>
kid didn&#39;t even realize that licking the bowl was something TO ask for <br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Also - last thing -- avoid the thought that this is all so SILLY - kids <br/>
fighting over who gets to lick the blankety-blank brownie bowl that has <br/>
all of about a spoonful of batter in it, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This is about far more than that - it is about who feels loved and who <br/>
feels left out and establishing how things will be decided in your <br/>
family and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Also - are you sure you couldn&#39;t have jumped into the car and gone and <br/>
bought more pop tarts when that issue came up? Going WAY out of your <br/>
way to do things like that - inconveniencing yourself - is how the kids <br/>
will learn to go out of THEIR way to be generous and kind and nice to <br/>
others, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra once picked me up at the airport and on the way to her house <br/>
Holly (who was 6, I think) asked if we could stop and buy some plums. <br/>
The first grocery store didn&#39;t have any so we drove to another one and <br/>
went in and THEY didn&#39;t have any either. So Sandra asked if I was too <br/>
tired or would I mind if we tried one more store. We did and they did <br/>
have plums. She bought a bag full of plums for Holly, who sat in the <br/>
back seat very very happily eating plums while Sandra and I talked and <br/>
I got to see some of Albuquerque just by driving around.<br/>
<br/>
This seems such a small story - but it was such a BIG moment in my life <br/>
because I knew that if MY 6 yo daughter had asked for plums that I&#39;d <br/>
have considered that a trivial request at such a time - and put her off <br/>
and I&#39;d have not even considered trying three grocery stores just to <br/>
get her something she had a sudden, inexplicable urge to eat. Sandra <br/>
knew that I was there to hang out with her - and we could do that while <br/>
driving around. She was looking at the &quot;reality&quot; as opposed to a <br/>
knee-jerk response like, &quot;Holly, you don&#39;t need plums now and I&#39;m not <br/>
dragging Pam all over Albuquerque from grocery store to grocery store.&quot; <br/>
THAT would have been thought and maybe said out loud by most moms, I <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
Again - automatically being &quot;solution-oriented&quot; and thinking of what <br/>
CAN be done -- Sandra&#39;s first thought was whether or not Holly could <br/>
get what she wanted at the same time we got what we wanted and the <br/>
answer was EASY. She didn&#39;t even know that I LIKE to go to grocery <br/>
stores in other parts of the country - I find it fascinating to see <br/>
what they have that is different than what I&#39;m used to at home.<br/>

&gt;something.  I have nothing more to offer!  Everyone is mad.<br/>

I can only focus on how to head them off in the future. What&#39;s worked <br/>
for us is talking after it&#39;s over and calm, but before it&#39;s forgotten. I <br/>
use these overwhelming situations as examples of when Mommy needs to <br/>
call a TIME OUT for herself and everyone drops the fight until she pulls <br/>
herself together. (which in this case would mean ds5 would return the <br/>
poptart until mom was calm enough to assess/deal/explain the situation) <br/>
I have the mommy&#39;s time out talk with them regularly when tensions are <br/>
high and assure them that they, too, have the option of calling a time <br/>
out when situations spiral out of control and understanding.<br/>

Trying isn&#39;t doing, if you&#39;re doing, then give yourself credit and say, <br/>
&quot;I breathe&quot; &quot;I&#39;m gentle and calm&quot; &quot;I give attention&quot; -- you can only DO <br/>
your best, whatever that means on any given day in any given situation, <br/>
no it doesn&#39;t mean being 100% perfect - it means if you have only 37% of <br/>
your capacity today, you give all 37%, tomorrow it may be 59% or even 3% <br/>
but give what you&#39;ve got. [I love The Four Agreements by Don Miguel <br/>
Ruiz] Though our goal is to have a peaceful family/existence, we can&#39;t <br/>
just wake up and have that ideal -- we need to journey to get there, by <br/>
today being MORE peaceful than yesterday, an easy and lofty goal. At my <br/>
house, sometimes that means 15 fights instead of yesterday&#39;s 16. [again, <br/>
advice I gleaned from the Peaceful Parenting tape]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is something bothering you that you think your children aren&#39;t picking <br/>
up on?? Big example from my own life: Thanksgiving is the beginning of <br/>
my annual grief cycle, culminating around December 3 (dh&#39;s death day <br/>
anniversary). This year, we&#39;ve got a new guy in our life so I kept quiet <br/>
about what I know to be the hardest couple of weeks of the year, <br/>
convincing myself I&#39;ll just be able to keep it together. Weeeeellllllll, <br/>
as you can imagine, a mommy who is barely able to function at dinner is <br/>
not a mommy who has /any/ available energy to tend to the needs of her <br/>
children. Hayden was in rare form, agitated, needy, aggressive and <br/>
crabby. I was so afraid that I would fall apart if I opened my mouth, I <br/>
was NO gentle or calm assurance to my little guy. Anything I did say <br/>
came out quickly and angrily. I did end up screeching at them both <br/>
before we went to sleep... the tirade lasted long enough for the entire <br/>
facade to be broken, I cried and cried, admitted to being more sad than <br/>
mad... then told the kids (for the first time, Hannah exclaimed!) <br/>
stories of their dad and me and why Thanksgiving is so important... A <br/>
bit ass-backward, I could have avoided the whole ding dang thing by <br/>
having the &quot;it&#39;s important and I&#39;m gonna be sad, so be gentle with me&quot; <br/>
talk for the week(s) prior. Luckily, we&#39;re a week into mommy having her <br/>
head out of her ass (which is how it feels to climb out from under <br/>
grief) and we&#39;re back to being normal -- which doesn&#39;t mean perfect, but <br/>
the situations as you described are down to once-every-other-day-ish <br/>
instead of several times daily.<br/>

I wrote earlier that I don&#39;t have these problems with my boys: their eight  <br/>

situations IRL with adults. I have lots of temperaments to work with and lots of  egos <br/>

happy. But to me it&#39;s not a *problem*: I just have a lot of  different solutions <br/>
to sort through to get what I ultimately need/want---happy  speakers and <br/>
happy attendees! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I just try not to look at these situations as problems to  overcome but as <br/>
solutions to find/sort through.<br/>
 <br/>
Again----great advice from Pam, but I&#39;d add to do it out loud----let them  <br/>
*hear* you problem-solving and let them join in.<br/>

<br/>
Hang in there!  I am sometimes overwhelmed with only two children.  Realizing that you don&#39;t like your behavior in a situation is the first step in changing.  I have given myself *time outs* and told the kids I was going in a room by myself until I could calm down.  I think it is a valuable thing for children to know that they can leave a volatile situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186516324">.  One thing we do is talk about it afterwards.... Here are some <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; questions we use..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; what happened? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>------<br/>
Good advice.  Talking about when everyone is calm. :)<br/>
.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>have a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bit of everything. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>------<br/>
Why couldn&#39;t I think of that yesterday in the heat of the moment? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Is this really about poptarts?  I don&#39;t think so.  I think it&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>about <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other things... attention? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>------<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How often do you go to park days?  Do you live where it&#39;s cold <br/>
 </span></blockquote>right now <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and outdoor play isn&#39;t available?  Sounds like more energy <br/>
 </span></blockquote>expending <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; might be in order too. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>-------<br/>
We live in Minnesota.  It&#39;s sunny but very icy and about 35 degrees.<br/>
I do encourage them to go outside, but they only like to when it&#39;s <br/>
their idea, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the good advice.<br/>

the oldest like #1, he&#39;s not the most aggressive and demanding (like <br/>

it&#39;s very hard for me to think of solutions to almost anything.  It <br/>

It&#39;s a no-brainer. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, my natural inclination might be to simply say to the <br/>

And that&#39;s the thing.  For too long we&#39;ve gone by &quot;who asked first&quot; <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

Guilty as charged, a few times anyway.<br/>

Well, actually we had just gotten home from errands.  We&#39;d been home <br/>
about 10 minutes when the pop tart episode happened.  We live in <br/>
Minnesota where it would involved not just shoes but coats, hats, <br/>
warming up the van, etc.  But maybe next time I could ask the <br/>
kids...is it worth it to them to get all bundled up...but what if 2 <br/>
say yes and 2 say no?  More dilemnas..<br/>
plums while Sandra and I talked and <br/>
<br/>
She was looking at the &quot;reality&quot; as opposed to a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193693546">My only thought is that growing up you always knew that the <br/>
brownie/cookie/icing bowl was never just yours. It was always shared, if <br/>
not with a sibling then with one of the adults....<br/>
Not sure if that helps, since it probably really was not JUST about who <br/>
got to lick what. BUt of course it can be just about the need for that <br/>
poptart or bowl of brownie mix.<br/>

&quot;Joe could have all if this batch and we could make more for Johnny.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Joe and Johnny could each have half.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Any other ideas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and when they start complaining immediately about one of my ideas, <br/>
I say, &quot;Just an idea - we don&#39;t have to do it. Any more ideas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if things are tense - sometimes I try throwing in a really goofy <br/>
silly idea right about then - have to judge how it will be taken.<br/>
<br/>
AND - don&#39;t forget to give them something fantastic to imagine. &quot;Next <br/>
time, I&#39;m going to make a whole SWIMMING POOL full of brownie mix and <br/>
you won&#39;t just get to lick it, you&#39;ll get to dive right INTO it!!!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
So - you can do this with us, if you want. Watch your kids and take <br/>
some notes - pick the next few conflicts and write to us about them and <br/>
we&#39;ll brainstorm ideas of how they might have been solved. There aren&#39;t <br/>
that many different KINDS of conflicts - you&#39;ll be able to use what we <br/>
come up with in other situations that arise later.<br/>

===============<br/>
<br/>
Progress, though, is that the bad days are fewer and farther between.<br/>
<br/>
If we advise people to settle for whatever instead of advising the best we <br/>
know, then honestly I think we would  be offering the kind of &quot;support&quot; some <br/>
people complain they came for and didn&#39;t get.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to support anyone justifying bad-mom behavior. No doubt there <br/>
are lists out there where if I went and described my own worst days, when I <br/>
treated the kids like evil worms, people would stroke and soothe me and say kids <br/>
are awful and moms work too hard and deserve praise no matter how they act.   I <br/>
myself can&#39;t do that, though, and unschooling can&#39;t flourish in the <br/>
lowest-factors realms.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and mindful parenting are lofty things, and if we just keep <br/>
notching a bit closer, and climbing a little bit higher, perspectives change.  <br/>
Maybe we intimidate those nearer the bottom of the hill, but there are lots of us <br/>
willing to help others find their way up there too.<br/>
<br/>
Though there are many who will encourage you to settle for the bottom, that <br/>
rope can help you climb up and away.<br/>

I make it a point to look really hard to notice and comment on the pleasant <br/>

==========================<br/>
<br/>
I have a collection of fallacies.<br/>
<br/>
Reading them might help one avoid making similar statements. And when you <br/>
stop making the statements, you can move that one extra step to not even thinking <br/>
the thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lately there have been statements made here that a kid or parent would <br/>
immediately (calmly and rationally) counter.  <br/>
&quot;You never listen to me.&quot;  (Holly)<br/>
&quot;You never let me...&quot;<br/>
&quot;I never get to...&quot;<br/>
&quot;No one every helps me...&quot;  (That was me.)<br/>
<br/>
None of the statments was true. It was worth pointing that out.  But in each <br/>
case the other  person or people knew that the speaker was feeling hurt and <br/>
overwhelmed, and sympathy came.  It&#39;s possible for someone to call another on a <br/>
false statement and yet still show compassion and generosity.<br/>
