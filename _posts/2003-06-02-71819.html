<div id="ygrps-yiv-486381751">I hope you all don&#39;t mind me forwarding this, it just seemed so appropriate <br/>
for a bunch of unschoolers!! :)<br/>
Hope no one minds the insinuation of being a &quot;crackpot&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Ren, A crackpot, but not a crackhead at least. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A water bearer in India had two large pots, each of which hung on the<br/>
ends of a pole he carried across his shoulders. One of the pots had a<br/>
crack in it, while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a<br/>
full portion of water.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked<br/>
pot arrived only half full. For an entire two years this went on daily,<br/>
with the bearer delivering only one and one-half pots full of water to<br/>
his house.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect<br/>
for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own<br/>
imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half<br/>
of what it had been made to do.<br/>
<br/>
After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke<br/>
to the water bearer one day by the stream. &quot;I am ashamed of myself, and I<br/>
want to apologize to you. I have been able to deliver only half my<br/>
load because of this crack in my side which allows water to leak out<br/>
all the way back to your house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of<br/>
this work, and you don&#39;t get full value from your efforts,&quot; the pot<br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
The bearer said to the pot, &quot;Did you notice that there were flowers<br/>
only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot&#39;s side? That&#39;s<br/>
because I have known about your flaw, and I planted flower seeds on<br/>
your side of the path. Therefore, every day while we walk back, you&#39;ve<br/>
watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful<br/>
flowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are,<br/>
there would not be this beauty to grace the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Moral:<br/>
Each of us has our own unique flaws. We&#39;re all cracked pots, but it&#39;s<br/>
the cracks and flaws we each have that make our lives together so very<br/>
interesting and rewarding. You&#39;ve just got to take each person for<br/>
what they are, and look for the good in them.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape.<br/>
Remember to appreciate the differences in the people around you.......<br/>
and &quot;Thank You&quot; to all my crackpot friends! <br/>
