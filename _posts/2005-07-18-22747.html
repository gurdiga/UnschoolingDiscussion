<div id="ygrps-yiv-967230312">The July/August issue of Life Learning is now available. In addition to our <br/>
usual features written by and about unschoolers of all ages, this issue has a <br/>
fascinating interview with writer and speaker Sandra Dodd. Sandra, who lives <br/>
with her husband and three always-unschooled teens in Albuquerque, New Mexico, <br/>
covers a lot of ground from her concept of &quot;strewing&quot;, through freedom, <br/>
learning for fun and what she calls &quot;spiritual unschooling&quot;. Single copies are <br/>
available for $4.95 (includes shipping) by calling 1-800-215-9574 (VISA and <br/>
MasterCard accepted). Details, subscription info and a PDF version of the issue are <br/>
also available on our website www.LifeLearningMagazine.com.<br/>
<br/>
================================<br/>
[Wendy sent this and asked me to post it, saying:   &quot; Sorry not to get to <br/>
this sooner. Life has a way of interfering with the best laid plans (in this <br/>
case, it&#39;s my 96-year-old mother who has experienced a very sudden onslaught of <br/>
dementia and had to be institutionalized).&quot;]<br/>
<br/>
There are photos of the kids there.   The one that says back yard is front <br/>
yard, and otherwise, there they are. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
