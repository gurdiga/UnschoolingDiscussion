 </span></blockquote>I have to agree with you Lisa, my daughter is 4 now, she was 3 when she<br/>
&quot;discovered&quot; Nintendo 64.  She plays it as well as my 11 and 14 year olds.<br/>
The skills needed to use all 7 buttons on the controller (most often in<br/>
combinations of two or more buttons) is definately nothing to sneeze at.<br/>
Tabitha can manuever her way around the Mario game and the Banjo Kazooie<br/>
game even though just to get to the &quot;world&quot; you are looking for is a huge<br/>
maze of hallways and secret rooms, pipes and tunnels.  She astounds me with<br/>
her ability to &quot;discover&quot; secret rooms the rest of us never found.  She also<br/>
learned to recognize numbers that no amount of flashcards in combination<br/>
with counting bears could teach her.  She knows how many &quot;lives&quot; she has<br/>
left by looking at the numbers.  When we reached the goal the other day in<br/>
Banjo Kazooie there was a big quiz about sounds and sites in the game.  If<br/>
Tabitha hadn&#39;t helped us with it we would not have cracked it.  She learned<br/>
more from that game than from anything else!<br/>
<br/>
She also has an incredible vocabulary.  Her preschool teacher wants to do a<br/>
test on her because she thinks she&#39;s brilliant.  You know what our secret<br/>
is?  Cartoons!  I know they are violent and I hate that but she has learned<br/>
so much from them that I don&#39;t tell her not to watch them.  She has tested<br/>
as near adult in vocabulary skills alone.<br/>
<br/>
This child was born weighing just over one pound and we were told not to<br/>
expect much from her.  Well, if anyone ever tells me that unschooling can&#39;t<br/>
work, I have my Tabby as a demonstration that watching tv and playing<br/>
Nintendo can teach plenty.  Now if I could get her to watch more of PBS than<br/>
Barney and TeleTubbies maybe she could start working on world peace...or<br/>
maybe Barney and TeleTubbies are all you need for world peace!<br/>
