<div id="ygrps-yiv-17070490">-=-I worry that it is the tv<br/>
<br/>
and video games, but I don&#39;t allow them to play or watch during the &quot;school<br/>
<br/>
day.&quot; We are basically an unschooling family, though, and we don&#39;t have<br/>
<br/>
regimented routines. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you have a &quot;school day&quot; you&#39;re not unschooling.  If something changes at <br/>
3:00, you&#39;re still dividing the world into &quot;educational&quot; and &quot;not <br/>
educational.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I<br/>
<br/>
am basically unable to &quot;make&quot; them do anything_=_<br/>
<br/>
You made them turn off the TV and video games.  Perhaps they question your <br/>
judgment and so are resistent to other suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
If your son has a hard time going to sleep and then wakes up in the middle of <br/>
the night, it is very, very likely that he&#39;s being expected to sleep too <br/>
much.  Not all kids need 8 hours of sleep, and if you&#39;re expecting MORE than <br/>
8 hours (he has a bedtime), he will wake up when he&#39;s had enough sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you let him stay up as late as he wants playing video games in his <br/>
room or reading then he&#39;ll sleep through from the time he goes to bed.<br/>
<br/>
It works for us.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t sleep much and neither does our oldest son.<br/>
