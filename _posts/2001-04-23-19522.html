I have a friend who has a family-wide week of silence every year around the<br/>
winter solstice.  They *hibernate* as much as possible, speaking to each<br/>
other and others only when absolutely necessary. I&#39;ve never been able to<br/>
convince my family to try it<br/>
<br/>
It sure does sound like a good idea though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261192618">LOL, Sandra! When my kids were still in school, they<br/>
always had to sign these pledge forms during this week<br/>
not to watch TV. And that was pretty funny considering<br/>
we don&#39;t have cable and our area gets NO channels<br/>
without cable.The kids would feel like they weren&#39;t<br/>
really participating since they weren&#39;t giving up<br/>
anything.So they would give up videos. <br/>
<br/>
It all reminded me of Lent, this giving up of<br/>
something.And the idea was if kids didn&#39;t watch TV<br/>
that week,they would read. That annoyed me (as an<br/>
English teacher, at the time)because it implied that<br/>
reading was a chore while TV was enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
And THAT reminded me of the woodshop teacher who used<br/>
to make the students WRITE for a punishment.I went to<br/>
him and asked if he would like it if I had the<br/>
students saw and pound nails for punishment.He just<br/>
acted like I was a freak for thinking pounding nails<br/>
wasn&#39;t fun. I told him he was implying to the kids<br/>
that writing wasn&#39;t fun. He was compeletely baffled<br/>
and clueless about my objections. SIGH! Juli<br/>

<div>The people who originally conceived of the no TV week did not say &quot;turn off 
your TV and read&quot;.&nbsp; Their idea was to just get people to THINK about their 
TV viewing, to get out of watching TV as a HABIT, rather than a conscious 
decision, and to think about alternatives to watching TV.&nbsp; They encouraged 
families to interact in other ways.</div>

husband that they don&#39;t speak in the morning. They<br/>
have breakfast, etc., but she&#39;s thinking about her<br/>
art, and they&#39;ve agreed that&#39;s silent time. Then she<br/>
goes to her studio and works. Sorry, I don&#39;t remember<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm, it seems to me that one of these things is not like the others.<br/>
Reading, talking, and asking questions are vital life skills in our society,<br/>
without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to lead a normal<br/>
life. OTOH, one can survive and even thrive without a television. I was<br/>
raised largely TV-free and other than a few occasions when drunken people at<br/>
parties spontaneously erupted into the theme song from Gilligan&#39;s Island or<br/>
some other such thing and I had no clue what they were going on about, I<br/>
can&#39;t say that it&#39;s been much of a loss. Well, there was that once in school<br/>
when I was teased by the other kids by not knowing who &quot;The Fonz&quot; was.<br/>
Oh yeah, I also don&#39;t rush over to glue myself to the tube whenever I go to<br/>
a house that has one :-), and neither do my (poor, television-deprived)<br/>
children :-)  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that given the fact that a large number of kids in this country are<br/>
being baby-sat by the television, with little to no interaction with them by<br/>
their parents (not that anyone on this list does that, but as someone who<br/>
has done a lot of work with disadvantaged youth I&#39;ve seen enough of it to<br/>
know it&#39;s not just some myth), that &quot;TV Turn Off Week&quot; would on the whole,<br/>
be a good idea. After all, many of these kids are never read a book, rarely<br/>
talked to, and often have no-one answering their questions. My in-laws are a<br/>
great example of television usurping all conversation and thought and<br/>
interaction with their children, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
I also think our culture could benefit from a good hard look at why the<br/>
average person on the street can name more people from &quot;Survivor&quot; and tell<br/>
more about their lives than they can about the neighbors that live right<br/>
next to them in their own community. TV is largely an isolating activity;<br/>
reading, talking, and question asking are not.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I do have a TV and even watch it once a week. I just can&#39;t resist<br/>
&quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;<br/>

don&#39;t think that having this week will get a parent to read a book to a child <br/>
that has not been interested in reading to them before, or answer questions, <br/>
etc. And it seems to me the remark about your inlaws may be a slight bit bias <br/>
:)  I doubt there was no interaction at all . <br/>
<br/>
I guess if the week gets people to think about their actions, etc. that is a <br/>
good thing, but I wonder how many people feel a fleeting sense of guilt about <br/>
not spending enough time with their kids and then forget about it the rest of <br/>
the year.<br/>

<br/>
For some kids, maybe the TV is the closest they come to literature, <br/>
language-learning and question-answering, and there is a TON of literature, <br/>
language, history, science, etc. on TV.  &quot;The Story of English&quot; (which we <br/>
videotaped) is amazing.  We bought the companion book too, but in the book <br/>
you cannot hear the accents (some of which had to be subtitled because they <br/>
are so unlike standard American English).<br/>
<br/>
My parents didn&#39;t like anything but country & western music.  Outside of band <br/>
at school and some $2.10 piano lessons (the teacher hadn&#39;t raised her rates <br/>
since the 1930&#39;s or so) TV was my window to classical, musical theatre, <br/>
Renaissance and folk music at first (the Friendly Giant is where I learned <br/>
&quot;Early One Morning,&quot; and when I first saw it in a book I recognized the tune).<br/>
<br/>
Photos in books don&#39;t show the way giraffes move, the way a lion sounds, the <br/>
way monkeys look when they use tools, and how their limbs move.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not buying that reading is necessary, either.  Many cultures exist <br/>
without it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Reading is.<br/>
<br/>
A book is the refuge, the escape of millions of kids right now, this moment, <br/>
who are in a book instead of listening to the teacher, or in a book to avoid <br/>
siblings or parents or caretakers or hospital personnel.<br/>

week works. I mean, TV turn off month or TV turn off<br/>

off week just reinforces the idea some kids have that<br/>
TV is fun, a thing to love, a thing you value so much<br/>
that turning off is a great sacrifice. Like the school<br/>
will REWARD them if they&#39;ve done it. Juli<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been waiting, with anticipation, for you to weigh in on this<br/>
discussion.  Once again, thank you.  Your thoughts echo some of mine and<br/>
you have, as usual, gotten me to think even farther outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an avid reader and it is one of my favorite &quot;escapes&quot;.  I think I get<br/>
as much, with different flavor, from the TV and movies I watch.  The<br/>
books about snakes I read to my 3 yo leave him cold but a show about them<br/>
on the Discovery channel thrills him right down to his toes.  No amount<br/>
of reading will communicate the sight of them flicking their tongues and<br/>
slithering across the sand.<br/>
<br/>
Not all children LIKE being read to.  My daughter easily consumed at<br/>
least 2 hours of my time with this activity everyday.  My son MIGHT<br/>
tolerate 5 minutes if I manage to use enough animation in my rendition. <br/>
He would rather play catch, &quot;the floor is hot lava so you have to get<br/>
through the house via the furniture&quot; or any other physical and/or<br/>
imagination play.<br/>

     We don&#39;t have it, either.  There are things on TV I enjoy seeing but <br/>
overall I feel like our household is better without it.  I felt like it was <br/>
on too much when I was a kid.  We went to Yosemite every year for a couple of <br/>
weeks to stay in a cabin and I was so glad it wasn&#39;t there.  It would have <br/>
ruined the whole atmosphere to have it blasting away every evening.  Even now <br/>
my parents have it on a lot when we&#39;re there and it even drives my 3 older <br/>
kids crazy.<br/>
     I also feel like there are better things we can do with the $480 a year <br/>
or so that it would cost us for standard service in our area.  We&#39;re pretty <br/>
strongly into the simplify your life stuff and look for ways to cut back <br/>
unfulfilling spending in order for my husband to work less.<br/>
     But I don&#39;t have some big major conviction about it like I&#39;m judging <br/>
people who do have it.  I&#39;ve had it before and it&#39;s possible that at some <br/>
future time, we could have it again (doubt it right now but who knows...).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623622567">I was an early and avid reader, as is just about<br/>
everyone in my family.  I assumed, when my son<br/>
voluntarily started reading phonetically before he was<br/>
2, that he would be the same... and then was dismayed<br/>
and alarmed when he entered school and nearly stopped<br/>
reading entirely (though he still loved to be read<br/>
to).  It wasn&#39;t until this past year (he just turned<br/>
11) that he began reading to himself for pleasure, and<br/>
he still isn&#39;t what you&#39;d call a big reader.  He<br/>
started reading for pleasure literally overnight,<br/>
though, so I just figure that he&#39;ll become more of a<br/>
reader as he matures.  <br/>
<br/>
Either that or he&#39;ll still be calling me to read to<br/>
him when he is 30.  ;D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526832143">Wizard is a special deck of cards (a regular deck + 4<br/>
Jesters + 4 Wizards), instructions & pad of special<br/>
scorepages.  It is a bidding trump & trick game, so it<br/>
is a good introduction to many of the aspects of<br/>
Bridge.  The game&#39;s rules are simple enough for middle<br/>
kids (a very precocious 8 and up, I think) to play,<br/>
but it does involve strategy and is challenging enough<br/>
to keep adults amused as well.  Everybody that has<br/>
taken our recommendation so far has come back with<br/>
rave reviews. In our area we have seen it at Games By<br/>
James, Zany Brainy, and Creative Kidstuff, I believe,<br/>
but is a more specialized game than you are likely to<br/>
find at Toys R Us, WalMart etc.  It can be found on<br/>
the net as well... I typed in &#39;Wizard and card games&#39;<br/>
in my favorite search engine (Dogpile), and got dozens<br/>
of sites that are selling it.  Well worth searching<br/>
out!  <br/>
