<div id="ygrps-yiv-909986145">&lt;&lt;A major component for health is the communication between your <br/>
<br/>
childÄ&#39; s brain and body. This vital link controls the growth,<br/>
<br/>
repair, <br/>
<br/>
& function of every tissue and organ. The spinal cord sends messages <br/>
<br/>
from the brain throughout the body via billions of nerves. <br/>
<br/>
Interference (nerve pressure or irritation) places the body in a <br/>
<br/>
state of disharmony. This can lead to decreased immune function and <br/>
<br/>
sickness.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
thnx for the comments on chiro, adjustments and birth.  i have bookmarked the <br/>
sites to check out when i go online sometime.  because individuals can be so <br/>
different, personal stories are interesting but not convincing to me.  the <br/>
info that explains the physical reasoning is much more helpful (as above <br/>
snip.)  i can see where some births are traumatic (physically) for the babe, <br/>
i guess it is the blanket statement that birth IS traumatic just doesnt sit <br/>
right.  i believe too much in the beauty of the natural design of women and <br/>
childbirth.  that chiro is something to fix our ails makes more sense than <br/>
that we just come into the world needing already to be adjusted!!   erin</div>
