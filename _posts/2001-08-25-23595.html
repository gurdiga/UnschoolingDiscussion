<div id="ygrps-yiv-118248093">These are interesting areas to me because my almost twelve year old son is <br/>
NOT a passionate writer and has awful handwriting. He attended school through <br/>
the third grade. HATED writing because it all consisted of writing stupid <br/>
sentences for vocabulary words. He also had a lot of trouble with <br/>
cursive...just didn&#39;t connect for him.  (By the way...WHY do they do that in <br/>
second grade????  Why don&#39;t they wait a few years when the hand-eye <br/>
development is better????)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...the way we got around the writing was this: One day I casually <br/>
invited him to go to a local cafe for lunch and to write poetry. He was so <br/>
startled he said yes! I taught him to write haiku (it&#39;s short, has a <br/>
structure, and doesn&#39;t force stupid rhymes.). He wrote about animals, which <br/>
is a passion for him. <br/>
<br/>
The next thing he wrote aside from poetry was an impassioned article for the <br/>
church newsletter. The church had serious problems with mice, and an <br/>
exterminator had to be called. He heard about it and was horrified at the <br/>
slaughter of literally hundreds of mice, and wrote a wonderful article for <br/>
the newsletter asking that people be careful about leaving food around to <br/>
avoid a similar fate.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing he wrote was an incredible essay (that he turned into a sermon <br/>
for our church&#39;s Children&#39;s Sunday) about Vegetarianism as a spiritual <br/>
practice.  (If anyone wants to read it, I am sure I could get permission to <br/>
share it. It&#39;s really impressive!)<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve discovered is that while it&#39;s certainly not a passion, Julian <br/>
likes to write things WHEN IT MATTERS TO HIM. He doesn&#39;t like to write for <br/>
the sake of writing.<br/>
<br/>
On the handwriting front: he still hates cursive. I figure it&#39;s important <br/>
that he be able to read it, so when I write him a note, I usually do it in <br/>
cursive. I don&#39;t make a big deal about it, and he hasn&#39;t complained. In <br/>
addition, I&#39;d like him to be able to sign his name legibly. I KNOW this is MY <br/>
stuff, but he has two other parents who do not have legible signatures, and <br/>
having spent time with bank tellers checking sig cards, I REALLY want him to <br/>
be able to do this. He finds it amusing, and says he has no objection, but <br/>
neither of us has done anything about it either.<br/>

<br/>
Marty and Kirby used to bring cursive for me to read when they could already <br/>
read things like Usborne mystery books and such, and occasionally one of the <br/>
visual clues was a note in cursive.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I apologized for having written something in cursive and Marty said, <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s okay, I can read it.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765294193">You really have a point about being able to sign his name.  We are a military family, and at age 10, children receive their first ID card.  It didn&#39;t occur to us that my son would need to sign his name for this, until the night before!  OH, NO!  And it has to fit in a little box, too!<br/>
<br/>
We had covered forming the cursive letters earlier in the year, but I don&#39;t make them do much writing, and to top it all off, my son goes by a nickname and hardly knows how to spell his given name!  What is a parent to do?<br/>
<br/>
panic.<br/>
<br/>
We practiced and practiced and practiced.  The poor boy&#39;s hand was getting cramps!<br/>
<br/>
Dad had to go with him, being the active duty member, and we were greatly relieved to find out that Dad was too busy with work matters on the appointed day to be able to take dear son to get this ID card.  That gave us 24 more hours!  Yippee!<br/>
<br/>
It all worked out.  He will likely never sign his name like that again, so it won&#39;t be much good for proving his identity, but it is done and reasonably legible.  By the time he needs to renew it at age 14, I&#39;m sure he will know how to spell his given name and be able to sign it appropriately.<br/>
