<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Play video games!  Do I let him? That just doesn&#39;t sound right to me.  <br/>

every day. We all take breaks and get tired of things and get interested in <br/>
other things and get side-tracked. Let him play until he has his fill. THEN <br/>
he&#39;ll surprise you by asking to do something you NEVER thought he would. But <br/>
you&#39;ll have to give him the time HE needs to get the game out of his system. <br/>
It&#39;s a trust thing. <br/>
<br/>
Almost all of us have been through this. As adults, it&#39;s allowed. We can read <br/>
or clean or watch TV or garden or paint or shop to our heart&#39;s content. But <br/>
children don&#39;t get the opportunity to get their fill of something---there are <br/>
ALWAYS limits! Trust your smart, sweet boy to play as long as he needs to. <br/>
It&#39;ll pass.<br/>
