<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161266089">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Brenda, an unschooler of my two children, 11 & 12.  I may not <br/>
have time to participate in this group, but I wanted to invite anyone<br/>
interested to join my e-mail list to discuss options of intentional<br/>
community for homeschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m exploring the possibilities of  starting a family-focused <br/>
community near Twin Oaks Community in Virginia (I&#39;ve been a member <br/>
there for 16 years), but the e-mail list is also for homeschool <br/>
families interested in intentional community in other areas.<br/>
<br/>
I am not writing this with the intention of starting a discussion on <br/>
this list.  Please e-mail me or subscribe to the list at:  <br/>
<br/>
