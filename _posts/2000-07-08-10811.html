we&#39;re going out somewhere for ME--if they want to mess up a trip to the park <br/>
or somewhere, that&#39;s their business) Then I immobilize one foot between my <br/>

I&#39;ve also heard that you can get good results by removing both.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt;  They would like to finish their turn with that toy&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
something I just remembered... a friend of mine uses a timer for toys when <br/>
there are a couple of kids... We set the timer for 2 mins.  When the bell <br/>
goes of it&#39;s time for the other person to have the toy.  I used this a lot <br/>
when Zak was about 3 and don&#39;t need to use it very often.  The other thing <br/>
someone told me, and this will probably work better with older kids is the <br/>
dividing up of anything such as pizza.  You let one person cut the pizza and <br/>
the other person choose what they want.. This prevents the cutter for cutting <br/>
big slices for themself because the other might choose those pieces.  I think <br/>
that&#39;s a great idea and we did it will a birthday cake recently...<br/>
