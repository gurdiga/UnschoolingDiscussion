<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060630929">Last week the kids and I went to Colorado.  Kirby was staying with a girl <br/>
he&#39;d met at an anime convention three years ago, and he&#39;s visited the group of <br/>
Denver-kids he met there another time before.  (The rest of us were elsewhere <br/>
doing elsewhat.)<br/>
<br/>
They had a group of friends like Kirby has a group of friends.  Most of <br/>
theirs are high school seniors.  Most of Kirby&#39;s is homeschoolers.   <br/>
<br/>
One thing he did was play Magic at the girl&#39;s house, with her deck.  She had <br/>
two decks and asked if he knew how to play.  He said sure.  <br/>
<br/>
He reported all this on the way home.  He said they played with 80 cards <br/>
instead of 60 and instead of playing one card at a time, they started with seven <br/>
cards and played five at a time.  She assured him that all the kids at her <br/>
school play it that way.  He went along with it.  He said once she said, &quot;You work <br/>
at a gaming store and you didn&#39;t know that rule?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He kinda laughed and said he had only said, &quot;Oh; my bad,&quot; and played it her <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s not that he&#39;s intimidated by her, nor was he trying to put the make <br/>
on her.  He was just trying to be friendly and play her &quot;house rules&quot; to be a <br/>
good guest.<br/>
<br/>
One day another friend of hers was over and he was invited to play.  He said, <br/>
&quot;I could beat you if I had my own deck,&quot; and said a couple of things that <br/>
caused Kirby to believe he was current on Magic-the-Real-Game.  So Kirby said <br/>
&quot;She has some weird rules,&quot; and left it at that.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him at what point did he admit to her that he proctors/judges Magic <br/>
tournaments?   He said he didn&#39;t.    I asked if he had worn any of his Magic <br/>
shirts.  He said no, he had just taken solid-color T&#39;s and &quot;Make 7 / UP Yours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it will embarrass her someday when she knows, but he can be pretty <br/>
charming and will probably soothe the awkwardness.  She wants to come and visit <br/>
here next summer, with another of the kids they hung out with up there, or two.  <br/>
She owns a hearse and wants to road trip down and hang out with Kirby here.<br/>
<br/>
Half of Kirby&#39;s t-shirt wardrobe consists of black t-shirts he has been given <br/>
when he worked at a Magic Tournament.  There are pre-release tournaments <br/>
(where participants get cards which aren&#39;t yet for general sale) and regional <br/>
tournaments (where kids come from several states around and the shop rents a big <br/>
hall of some sort for it) and Kirby has the t-shirts to document two years of <br/>
this work.   They say &quot;Staff&quot;  on them.  I think one says &quot;Judge.&quot;  There are a <br/>
dozen, at least, with large Magic-card art on the back and logo-fronts and <br/>
company sleeves sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
But he didn&#39;t reveal any of this to his hostess, and he played her way.<br/>
<br/>
At one point they went to a movie.  She and two friends, both he said dressed <br/>
dramatically goth-like.  And Kirby was wearing yellow pants.  There was a <br/>
skating rink in the place where the theater was, and two hockey-players, sticks <br/>
in hand (no skates, I presume &lt;g&gt;) taunted the boys.  &quot;Go back to the circus&quot; <br/>
or something.   One of the girls was encouraging the boys to respond in kind, <br/>
and Kirby said (sweetly and laughingly, the way he reported it to us), &quot;They <br/>
have sticks.  They could kick our asses!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think a hockey player on skates could kick Kirby&#39;s butt.  I think Kirby <br/>
could disarm a hockey player on solid ground, because he&#39;s studied Japanese <br/>
weapons for years (not sword, but bo and karate-related stuff).  If Kirby got the <br/>
stick, the hockey guy might be in trouble.  He didn&#39;t mention that to any of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My interpretation is a guess, but I think he&#39;s confident enough that he can <br/>
impress them without bragging that he found no need to defend  or inflate <br/>
himself, even when it wouldn&#39;t have been any exaggeration at all to just casually <br/>
mention what he does regularly at home.   He met them through his interest in <br/>
anime, which is his third or fourth interest, and let them think there wasn&#39;t <br/>
much more to him.<br/>
<br/>
I was impressed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Great story. It impresses me too!<br/>
<br/>
       When I was a very young, female professional in a world of men&#39;s men, <br/>
I was often mistaken for a secretary. It was much better to just go along with <br/>
it than to correct people. We Southern ladies always used to tell each other, <br/>
&quot;Always let them underestimate you!&quot; It was like the scene in Top Gun where <br/>
Tom Cruise is bragging to Kelly McGillis in the bar about being a pilot, and <br/>
she lets him go on and on and just bats her eyes at him, when the next day she <br/>
turns out to be the expert instructor for the class he&#39;s there to take.<br/>
<br/>
       Then when they do realize and are embarrassed, you get extra points <br/>
for graciously letting them off the hook &lt;G&gt;.  I hope Kirby discovers that part <br/>
is especially fine. JJ<br/>

<br/>
I forgot to remind those who havne&#39;t been following the Tale of Kirby that he <br/>
was a furious kind of explosive games player when he was little.  Games had <br/>
to played EXACTLY RIGHT and it was best if Kirby won.  Video games needed to go <br/>
well within his window of patience, or that controller was going to be sorry. <br/>
 He did NOT accept variance.  He didn&#39;t like furniture rearranged.  I used to <br/>
mess with him in this too-cruel way:<br/>
<br/>
I would sing the songs to The Jetsons theme song to the tune of The <br/>
Flintstones.  He would WAIL for me to STOP IT as though I were torturing the dog.   <br/>
When I stopped laughing (and now I probably wouldn&#39;t mess with a kid that way, <br/>
but it was just so funny to me and Keith that he couldn&#39;t stand it; we&#39;re older <br/>
and better parents now) I would say Okay, okay.  And I&#39;d start the Jetsons <br/>
theme &quot;right&quot; with the &quot;Doo dee dee, doo dee dee, doo dee dee, doo dee doodle <br/>
deedle DOOOOO! &quot;  And about the time he was calm again, I&#39;d get to the part that <br/>
went, &quot;Meet Fred Flintstone.  Doo dee dee, doo dee dee, his dog Dino, daugher <br/>
Pebbles, Wilma his wife...&quot;  Kirby hated it.<br/>
<br/>
But now he can go three days without insisting the world should be otherwise.<br/>

Another friend of mine works for the state of New Mexico in traffic research. <br/>
 Once at a party she was asked what she did at work.  She was starting to <br/>
explain it, but right after &quot;statistical modelling&quot; someone interrupted and said <br/>
&quot;OH, you&#39;re a model?&quot;<br/>

the Gathering player (is going to the JSS Champs in Kansas City this <br/>
summer).  He still corrects people if they do this &quot;not the right way,&quot; <br/>
but, I think he&#39;s easing up on it a bit.  This morning  he was telling me <br/>
of the different rules for Monopoly used at his friend&#39;s house, and he <br/>
wasn&#39;t implying that they were incorrect.<br/>
