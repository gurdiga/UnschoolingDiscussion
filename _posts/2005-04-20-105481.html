 </span></blockquote>Thanks!  I did found a whole list o&#39; preferred links at Margo&#39;s <br/>
group and a few personal recommendations as well, including fabrics-<br/>
store.com, fabric.com, sewingcentral.com, fashionfabricsclub.com <br/>
(oooh, tropical weight wool), periodfabrics.com - and of course, <br/>
eBay, with two thumbs up for a seller by the name of fabricguru or <br/>
crabdaddylonglegs.  If anyone has dealt with these suppliers and has <br/>
experience to share, pro or con, please pass it on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple of folks recommended the handy-dandy Smock Pattern <br/>
Generator at Drea Leed&#39;s website: http://costume.dm.net/ as well as <br/>
a hooped farthingale in lieu of the crinoline for the petticoat.  <br/>
They also told me that the dress Nike purchased at RenFest (see <br/>
photo at http://clandees.ardfamilyco-op.net) is made of material <br/>
which would be used more for undergarments than overskirts in the <br/>
16th century, so cotton gauze is not considered authentically <br/>
period.  <br/>
<br/>
Drea&#39;s site is a wealth of information, but someone offlist also <br/>
pointed me to the SCA&#39;s &quot;Known World Handbook&quot; as well.  Nike was <br/>
aware of her gown&#39;s shortcomings as she had explored the offerings <br/>
at SCA.org and other period-friendly sites many moons ago.  As I <br/>
mentioned to my correspondent, she had also subscribed to the local <br/>
SCA mailing list last year, but the group appeared to be very <br/>
inactive and she felt awkward about showing up unannounced at the <br/>
meetings.  <br/>
<br/>
Nike has long been interested in authentic costuming (hence, our <br/>
sewing projects of limited success as previously mentioned) and <br/>
living history, but hasn&#39;t had much success finding career options <br/>
in the field.  She heads off to a realist workshop in Toronto this <br/>
summer to help her decide whether art school will be in her future.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has contacts or is experienced in any of the following: <br/>
SCA, fashion design/costuming, artists in the realist style, nature <br/>
and wildlife photography and related work, etc. -- in the central <br/>
Florida area (we live along the Gulf/Nature Coastline) or otherwise -<br/>
- we&#39;d be thrilled to hear about it.  That&#39;s all for now -- thanks <br/>
again, Amigos...<br/>
