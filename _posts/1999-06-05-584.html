<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749423769"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tanya, in Washington, you do not need to register your child until the year <br/>
&gt; they are 8.  What this means is that if your child&#39;s birthday is in November, <br/>
&gt; you do not need to do ANYTHING until the FOLLOWING year, when she would be 8 <br/>
&gt; at the school entry deadline.  Does that make sense?  Another way.  If your <br/>
&gt; dd turned 5 in November, she would not have attended school that year, as the <br/>
&gt; cutoff date is Sept. 18th(?).  So, apply that rule to when she turns 8, and <br/>
&gt; that is when you need to register, and test.<br/>

O.K., I just want to make sure I have this right.  My son turned 8 in<br/>
April(2months ago), thus I do not need to register him with the school<br/>
district until next september?  Correct?<br/>
