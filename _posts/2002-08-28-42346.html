&lt;&lt; This reminds me, though, of what might be a good thing for some people, <br/>
and <br/>
 will surely be a bad thing for many more:  Our proving that there is an <br/>
 option will make many children resent school and their parents even more. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, showing kids there are options does amplify the resentment towards their <br/>
own parents and the controls they brandish.<br/>
My friend that is new to homeschooling this month, is trying the school at <br/>
home approach. Still has a lot of fears all bound up with this venture.<br/>
Her kids keep asking her why they can&#39;t be unschooled &quot;like Trevor and Jared <br/>
and Sierra&quot;. They love coming over here and long for no school.....I keep <br/>
sending her articles via email which she reads willingly and thanks me for.<br/>
So far it&#39;s helped her relax, but not embrace unschooling.<br/>
Baby steps...<br/>

<br/>
This is a hard time of year to relax.  I&#39;m not caught up in the public<br/>
school back to school frenzy, but my eclectic friends are all starting<br/>
up their lessons.  Sometimes I get all pale and sweaty thinking that my<br/>
son is never going to learn the things that their kids are, in theory,<br/>
learning.  I&#39;m feeling a lot of tension right now.  Any suggestions? <br/>
I&#39;m thinking &quot;go to the beach&quot;, but I&#39;m not planning to do that until<br/>
next week.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy, who&#39;s son is asking me a lot of tough questions about who can<br/>
beat who in Diablo II as I&#39;m trying to type.</div>
