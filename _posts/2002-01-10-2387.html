<div id="ygrps-yiv-745853496">I&#39;m over at the unschooling.com e-mail list trying to explain why the <br/>
terms &quot;educational&quot; would best be dropped from the vocabulary in <br/>
order to fully embrace the unschool mindset.<br/>
Talk about feeling like you&#39;re swimming upstream.<br/>
Man am I glad for this list, where everyone seems to have a deep <br/>
understanding of what freedom from the school mindset is!!!<br/>
I love you guys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275921485">OK, I think I ave to come up with a new sig line. That is what I think<br/>
Cowboys sing while out on the range in the SW and we are moving to the Land<br/>
of Dodd, er ... Land of Enchantment also known as New Mexico.<br/>

Someone help me think of a better sig line for moving out there onto a small<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530710101">I think you hit the nail on the head with that one.  One of my <br/>
neighbors asked me yesterday &quot;how educationally sound is this home <br/>
thingy (her words) thing you do with the kids&quot;... I calmly <br/>
responded &quot;wow did you learn that grammer in school&quot;.. She didn&#39;t get <br/>
it....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000263580">Oh yes! I think I remember you explaining that a while ago. No need to change a thing, it&#39;s an awesome sig line - much better than mine - which is none. :o) So when are you moving?<br/>
