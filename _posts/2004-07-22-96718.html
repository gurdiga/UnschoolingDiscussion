&gt; <br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t vax for anything.  I&#39;d much prefer they be exposed to chickenpox, as<br/>
&gt; well as mumps and measles -- if such a thing were actually possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My oldest had chickenpox at age 3, when you could still find &#39;wild&#39;<br/>
&gt; chickenpox.  Now, if a child has chickenpox, it&#39;s likely he got it from the<br/>
&gt; vax strain, either his own shots or being exposed to some other child who was<br/>
&gt; recently vaccinated.  I&#39;ve heard some real horror stories of cases of the pox<br/>
&gt; caused by the vax, so I&#39;m not sure how well that would fit with my plan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For Andy, who&#39;s 8, we had the chance 2 summers ago to expose him when a<br/>
&gt; friend&#39;s kids had chickenpox.  Unfortunately, he was scheduled to travel to<br/>
&gt; Hawaii with his grandparents two weeks later, so it would have been a really<br/>
&gt; irresponsible time for me to expose him, and by association everyone he came<br/>
&gt; into contact with on a plane.  As well, our entire household (except me) had<br/>
&gt; recently survived a nasty virus that landed our Dan, then 17 mos, in the<br/>
&gt; hospital with unexplained seizures.  I&#39;ve always suspected that illness was<br/>
&gt; the result of exposure at a playground (counting backwards the incubation<br/>
&gt; period we had), perhaps even a recently vaxed child.  Since then, I&#39;ve begun<br/>
&gt; to think maybe only after Dan&#39;s 5yo.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the boys reach late adolescence without ever having had pox, mumps, or<br/>
&gt; measles, I&#39;ll explain to them the risks of childhood diseases in adulthood and<br/>
&gt; leave it to them to decide if they&#39;d like to be vaxed.  In spite of the recent<br/>
&gt; media coverage, it&#39;s currently not safe (or possible) to be vaxed for whooping<br/>
&gt; cough after age 7, so it&#39;s a non-issue in adulthood.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I survived both measles, mumps (5x) and chickenpox, with no<br/>
&gt; lasting effects.  Both my parents and all their siblings (11 kids total,<br/>
&gt; living poor in Okla & West VA) survived those plus whooping cough (pertussis).<br/>
&gt; My Mom survived polio as a nursing infant, with no lasting effects.  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; terribly worried about them being unvaxed, but I&#39;d be happier if they had the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to acquire natural lifelong immunities to the childhood illnesses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Syl<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *******<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; does there come a time when you expose them if you can?<br/>
&gt; Is there an age when you try to have them get it if possible or just live and<br/>
&gt; see what happens on it&#39;s own?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-143391290">My great aunt lost an infant to whooping cough.  It CAN be a big deal to <br/>
a baby.  It broke my heart to hear her talking about her little girl.<br/>
<br/>
That said, we didn&#39;t vaccinate for whooping cough.  It&#39;s just not very <br/>
common these days and the side effect of the vax is more risk than the <br/>
risk of getting it.  And of course, once a child is above a year or so, <br/>
the risk of dying is slim to none, even if they do get it. <br/>

It was in the news recently that whooping cough is making a comeback, but  <br/>
mostly in teens and adults, because their immunity wore off.<br/>
