<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892464365">I&#39;m sure this isn&#39;t unschooling, since my child is two and couldn&#39;t have <br/>
possibly wanted to sprout bean plants, since he didn&#39;t know they sprouted. <br/>
I&#39;m also aware there are people who don&#39;t want to read &quot;what we did today&quot; <br/>
posts. However! I am unfit for being a lurker, so I just have to open my <br/>
large mouth and blab a bit :) and I think this is the most innocuous way I <br/>
can do it! :)<br/>
<br/>
In Benny&#39;s Easter basket he got five kinds of dried beans and peas, and five <br/>
plastic containers to put them in. This was really *really* exciting for <br/>
him, since he loves pouring and sorting and counting and whatnot, and so he <br/>
had split peas all over the place, and kidney beans, and was lying down <br/>
among them just running his hands through and saying &quot;Boooooteeful <br/>
Booooooteeful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So during one of the 47 times I was picking it all up out of the carpet (All <br/>
done beans! = You pick it up Mommy!) I thought I wonder if these dried up <br/>
little old dead things would sprout. So we shredded some paper towel and put <br/>
it in a pasta cannister, wet it, and then poked the beans down in. I am <br/>
constantly fighting the &quot;hands off - let him do it&quot; battle with myself and <br/>
this was no exception -- he put waaaaayyy too many beans in there, and I <br/>
just said okay, whatever, if they don&#39;t sprout they don&#39;t sprout. So I let <br/>
him pour in the water (WAAAAY too much!) and shut the lid. I never EVER <br/>
really thought they would sprout.<br/>
<br/>
WELL THEY DID! They absolutely totally did, those little buggers. So after a <br/>
couple days we pulled them out of there and &quot;planted&quot; them in some sawed off <br/>
milk jug planters with dirt which he poured in himself (shudder, I know, <br/>
hands off) and then waited for them to poke up through WHICH THEY TOTALLY <br/>
DID! And now they&#39;re about four inches high. I think it was just so cool to <br/>
see that total transformation -- and to see how Benny just sort of accepted <br/>
it like, oh, of course! :) I want him to have that farm kid awareness, or at <br/>
least as much of it as I can get into his city kid life. But it&#39;s weird how <br/>
even though I think of myself as having it, I still get sort of tingly when <br/>
I see this happening. :) ANYWAY, now I&#39;m romanticizing and soon I&#39;ll be <br/>
naming these lousy little plants -- with my husband already saying... &quot;Hmm, <br/>
now where are those going to GO?&quot; Heh heh.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

But it&#39;s learning, and so can the same kinds of things be when he&#39;s ten!<br/>
<br/>
Our pumpkins sprouted a few days ago.  This is the third year from pumpkin <br/>
seeds from our own yard, from a jack-o-lantern when we first moved here.  <br/>
(One year we didn&#39;t plant any.)  Free pumpkins when Halloween comes!<br/>
<br/>
I only talk about unschooling when I&#39;m talking to new homeschoolers about how <br/>
kids learn.  In my everyday life with freidns, relatives, neighbors, etc., <br/>
it&#39;s just &quot;they don&#39;t go to school&quot; and &quot;learning.&quot;   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539704440">Oh, that brings back memories.  When the kidlets were little they did<br/>
sprouts.  We must have eaten sprouts on everything!  It is fun for small<br/>
people because you have these little plastic lids with holes like screening<br/>
and they get to wash them out each day and then watch them sprout.<br/>
<br/>
Those were the &quot;veggies&quot; they loved to eat the most &lt;g&gt;  We even did<br/>
broccoli sprouts and son #3 wanted to send some to George Sr. &lt;&lt;&lt;bewg&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t count as unschooling.  You offered him an <br/>
activity, and he took you up on it, learned some stuff and had fun.  And <br/>
now he knows that beans sprout.  Maybe he&#39;ll have questions about that <br/>
process, and maybe he won&#39;t.  Or maybe the ideas will percolate, and he&#39;ll <br/>
come out with some amazing connection to something else in his life one day.<br/>
