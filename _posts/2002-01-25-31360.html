<div id="ygrps-yiv-34703306">Mary, you may be interested in getting the books &quot;Career Ideas for kids who like Money&quot; and the &quot;Career Ideas for kids who like Writing&quot; by Diane Lindsey Reeves.  It just might help your husband to realize that people have many interests.  The combination of these interests is what makes them want to pursue certain career paths.  I found it interesting that &quot;Talking&quot; is a category.  It makes a lot of sense to me now especially since I like to talk and would be comfortable in a job utilizing that skill.  I wonder if the people that post to this list are talkers or writers?<br/>
