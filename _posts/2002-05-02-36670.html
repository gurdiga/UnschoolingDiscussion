&lt;&lt; . I have come to believe that MOST adults suffer from enough math anxiety <br/>
 that it holds them back and prevents them from understanding things they <br/>
 ought to understand,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh gosh!! That is so true for me. Your whole post just really hit home.<br/>
I had a traumatic experience in school (1st grade) and totally shut down to <br/>
math after that.<br/>
The funny thing is, I&#39;ve always felt like I should be ok at it, because I <br/>
tend to pick up concepts fairly quick. But as soon as I try putting it to <br/>
paper or forced to do problems, I just freeze up mentally.<br/>
But I can do almost any percentage in my head, I&#39;m beginning to add, subtract <br/>
and multiply larger numbers without a calculator (yes, just beginnning to in <br/>
my 30&#39;s!!!)<br/>
and doubling or tripling recipes was always fairly simple for me.<br/>
In fact, I used the image of measuring cups to figure out other fraction <br/>
problems in life, because in the kitchen it&#39;s easy enough, but elsewhere I <br/>
would struggle.<br/>
<br/>
I need you to come tutor ME Pam!!!!<br/>
I want to get over this fear of math, this feeling of incompetency.<br/>
Most math posts go right over my head and I hate that. I want my kids to see <br/>
the fun in manipulating numbers and using math.<br/>
I&#39;m trying to teach myself some little tricks to help me get past <br/>
this....it&#39;s so hard.<br/>
sigh.....<br/>
Thanks for a great post Pam!!! (as usual).<br/>
