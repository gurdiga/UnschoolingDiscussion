<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316249820">It&#39;s all such a puzzle isn&#39;t it? There&#39;s obviously something compelling that <br/>
keeps drawing them back to this situation. Maybe some talking in their <br/>
downtime, maybe right before bed, will give you some insight into what they <br/>
getting from all this.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say, having had a child who *also* used to throw INTENSE tantrums (I have holes in my walls to prove it), that this is the crux of the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
Find out what it is that draws them back again and again.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I also had to do with my negatively energized child was to teach him different things he could do when he was frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Many times, he would grow frustrated and it didn&#39;t occur to him that he *could* ask for help.  He put it upon himself to figure everything out on his own.  Or he was so involved in what he was trying to do that he wasn&#39;t thinking about the fact that maybe I could help him with it.<br/>
<br/>
Other times I would take the game and ask him to please go in his room and cool off for awhile, because maybe it would come to him while he was taking a break.  And still other times, I would  have him jump on a minitramp just to get the energy out of his system.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would find out what compells them back to it again and again, help them name their feelings, and ALSO show them concrete ways to deal with their frustrations because while video games are one source of frustration, they won&#39;t be the *only* one.<br/>

This is something *so* important.  My daughter is the one who learned about<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He probably also has some really wonderful, endearing, and creative <br/>
&gt; qualities too though, right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh yes, both of them do.  They definitely have strengths and their own ways <br/>
&gt; of learning and certain things they excel in.   Ethan is mechanical minded. <br/>
&gt;  He loves machines, engines, speed, movement.   JP is very athletic and <br/>
&gt; coordinated.  They both have wonderful active imaginations.  I KNOW they <br/>
&gt; are worthy, valuable,  precious people.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s not okay to <br/>
Â  to hurt each other or break things that belong to the family. Maybe give <br/>
him a punching bag or trampoline to work out some of those urges. Don&#39;t try <br/>
to stop them, channel them.<br/>
<br/>
The channeling is difficult.  So much of the &quot;blow ups&quot;  are so impulsive and <br/>
fast happening.  Before I can intervene, the remote control has been broken <br/>
into a thousand pieces.  Gosh, if I listed the damage these boys have done.. <br/>
its unreal..  Holes in walls,  we only have 1 out of 6 dining room chairs <br/>
left.. numerous electronics (including a video camera), countless toys, games <br/>
CDs, damage to our vehicles, furniture. its endless.  .. And this ties into <br/>
your next statement...<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I wouldn&#39;t keep replacing them forever. He has no incentive then <br/>
to try a different method of displaying his anger. And anyway, it&#39;s just too <br/>
expensive. I&#39;m honest with my kids about how much we make and have and how <br/>
much we can spend on things. If the money&#39;s not there, it&#39;s not there.<br/>
<br/>
They just dont understand how these damages affect our family.  If its one of <br/>
thier own toys or belongings .. well, then, they no longer have that toy.  <br/>
Even though sometimes I will replace it.. But for family stuff ( like the <br/>
game controllers) we are just out of luck and out of pocket to replace the <br/>
stuff.. Our house looks like a war zone..  My husband has just given up on <br/>
keeping up repairs.. Most all of our doors are broken.( beaten or kicked in). <br/>
windows broken, holes in walls, peeled wall paper. Dh feels like its a losing <br/>
battle to keep things repaired.. and, really, it is.. We bought new entrance <br/>
doors over a  year ago.. Dh has never installed them.. Every time one of the <br/>
boys knocks another chunk out of the doors, Dh says,.. see, Im glad that <br/>
wasnt the new door.    This destructive behavior usually happens so fast, we <br/>
cant stop it.  To &quot;channel&quot; thier aggression elsewhere would require CONSTANT <br/>
supervision., which seems unreasonable for kids thier age..( and really, <br/>
impossible) <br/>
<br/>
Well, tantrums happen. Some people are hard wired to naturally calm <br/>
themselves and deal with frustration. Others have to work at it. Venting, to <br/>
me, is okay. Hitting, breaking things or hurting each other is not.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree.. Everyone is different in the way they handle thier stress <br/>
and frustration.  I see it so clearly among my own family.  My older son is <br/>
more &quot;verbal&quot;  my daughter more &quot;sulky&quot; and pouty.  The younger boys.. WHOOO <br/>
WEEE, its all physical.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand. Do they generally have trouble with transitions? Casey (my 9yo <br/>
dd) has a LOT of trouble transitioning to anything. Even things she loves<br/>
<br/>
YESS.. I written here before out the trouble they have with transistions.  <br/>
Other parents have spoken of similar situations.  I try all of that <br/>
&quot;beforehand&quot; stuff.. Sometimes it works, sometimes it just stresses them out <br/>
because they start worrying that much sooner that they will have to make a <br/>
transition.   Here&#39;s a prime example. We had been planning on going to a hs <br/>
valentine party on Monday.  We made candy over the weekend.. made our <br/>
valentines.. talked about the party.. Everyone was excited..  But on Monday, <br/>
Ethan wouldnt get out of bed.  He normally gets up before anyone else to <br/>
&quot;claim&quot; the game system.  But he wasnt up by noon.. The party was at  2..  I <br/>
went in around 12:30 to check on him.. He wasnt even asleep.  I said..&quot;Ethan, <br/>
the party is today .. you wanna get up and get ready?&quot;  He immedieatly <br/>
started to protest and say he didnt want to go.  I assured him it would be <br/>
fun.. lots of games, snacks, playing..  He insisted he didnt want to go.   I <br/>
thought he might change his mind as Anna, JP and I got ready, but he didnt.  <br/>
The party was only a few minutes away from our house.. So, Iet him stay home. <br/>
  I really didnt want to.. I knew that if I &quot;made&quot; him go, he would probably <br/>
have a good time.  AT LEAST he wouldnt be home alone.  But, I didnt make him. <br/>
 Of course, when JP and Anna got home, he wanted to eat thier candy.  <br/>
<br/>
I think folks who do not deal with this type of behavior do not understand <br/>
that these kids REALLY will not take the initiative on &quot;getting interested&quot; <br/>
in things.. Yes, Ethan does have some interests ( very limited) and I do <br/>
everything in my means to  make these things available, encourage and support <br/>
him in them.   But, I also know that if I dont encourage and sometimes even <br/>
insist that he go somewhere or try something new ,he would never know that he <br/>
DOES like it.   Is that wrong????<br/>
<br/>
.  He is the same way about foods.  I dont &quot;make&quot; him try new foods.. but I <br/>
have paid him to taste something.. Lots of times he finds  out that he likes <br/>
it!!!!.. I wish I didnt have to pay him to try something new.   Now, he went <br/>
with his Grandpa ( my Dad) to a BBQ one time.. He refused to eat.. Dad gave <br/>
him a plate and told him that if he was hungry , he better eat some.  ( yeah, <br/>
old school, no BS Grandpa)   Well, Ethan tried it, and he LOVED it!!.. If <br/>
that had been me, I probably would have bought him some chicken tenders on <br/>
the way home and Ethan would have never known he liked BBQ.  <br/>
  Oh.. I just reread that and I need to clarify.  I know, that if Ethan had <br/>
tasted the BBQ and hated it.. His Grandpa would have never made him eat it.   <br/>
 Yeah, Ethan would have been hungry for a while., but he would have had to <br/>
wait til they got home and then Grandpa( or most likely  Grandma)  would have <br/>
made him something he liked.. But the point is, Ethan didnt automatically <br/>
assume that he would be &#39;catered&quot; to for his limited preferences in food, <br/>
like he does at home with me and his dad.<br/>
<br/>
Its easy for folks to say &quot;kids will do this or they will do that.. given <br/>
enough time&quot;  But I think those are &quot;typical&quot; kids ..( I dont like labels <br/>
either.. but I dont know any other way to describe it)  <br/>
<br/>
Mary, you have been SOOOO helpful, sensitive and understanding.. I am so glad <br/>
you are here.  I know you post alot of the unschooling.com message boards.. <br/>
But the email format is so much easier for me to follow.. Thanks so much for <br/>
contributing here.  I really appreciate it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats what I ended up doing today.. After I took the N64 away..  Then he had <br/>
calmed down.. we went and ran some errands and he asked ( this was JP, 7 yo)  <br/>
if he could play it when we got back home.  I told him, he could.  I got it <br/>
back out and hes been playing happily all evening.    Sometimes I think they <br/>
do just need a break to regroup.   <br/>
<br/>
And the compelling attraction.. YES, there has to be some. .. And it must be <br/>
pretty strong.. This may be a WAYY off way to compare it.. BUT, it does have <br/>
its similarities..   Take alcohol or drugs.. or heck, maybe an extreme <br/>
sport..  The feeling, the &quot;high&quot;  the adrenaline during the activity . . its <br/>
compelling enough to go back to again and again despite hangovers,  fines and <br/>
jail time.., injuries, pain, and sometimes loss of loved ones.. Gosh, all <br/>
kinds of negative consequences.    Perhaps the &quot;rush&quot; the pleasure, the high <br/>
of playing the games is compelling enough to continue even though they cause <br/>
immense frustration and stress ( and damage to property)<br/>

<br/>
My kids will say yes to a lot of activities, but through trial and error, we<br/>
have found it best to miss out on many of them.  We didn&#39;t go to the park<br/>
day yesterday, because we had to be out of the house Monday and today.  We<br/>
all agreed that it would be better to have a day at home, even though we<br/>
knew that we would have enjoyed the park while we were there.  Three days of<br/>
activities in a row is just too many for us.  When we are home all day, I<br/>
can alternate my chores and projects with spending time with them.  When we<br/>
are on the go, either the house ends up a disaster or I&#39;m just not able to<br/>
spend time with them because I need to do the household stuff.  Neither of<br/>
those makes me happy if it happens too often!  Also, my kids are more likely<br/>
to get involved in a project of their own when we have long stretches of<br/>
time at home.  Our homeschool group had a Valentine&#39;s Party this week, but I<br/>
didn&#39;t even mention it to them.  (I don&#39;t usually not tell them options, but<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to go, and they went to a birthday party Monday, so I felt<br/>
that was enough parties for one week!)<br/>
<br/>
When I look at our schedule compared to the average school kid, it looks<br/>
pretty calm.  But it doesn&#39;t take very many extra activities to throw<br/>
everything off.  When people are all stressed and can&#39;t get ready to go to<br/>
something that sounds like fun, I find myself wondering if they really don&#39;t<br/>
want to go.  The other thing that happens when we schedule too many<br/>
activities is that we are less likely to make time for one on one visits<br/>
with our friends.  I aim for at least two weekdays each week where we do not<br/>
get in the car.  This may change as the girls get older, but it is working<br/>
well for us now.<br/>

<br/>
It is normal for children to be reluctant about tasting new foods.  My<br/>
neighbor, in his 30&#39;s, is a VERY picky eater.  He is a high paid worker with<br/>
a major food production company.  He probably has more sensitive taste buds.<br/>
<br/>
I like many foods that I hated as a child and hate many foods that I loved<br/>
as a child.  Tastes do change.  My children ate most everything as toddlers,<br/>
then rejected many foods they had previously liked, and are now adding more<br/>
foods to their &quot;acceptable&quot; list.  My husband refused steak until he was 16,<br/>
finally TASTED it, and decided he loved it.  His parents almost wished he&#39;d<br/>
never tasted it, because he was cheaper to feed on hamburger, than steak!<br/>
And they didn&#39;t have to pay him to try it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How does talking to them about it go? Does it end up having the general feel<br/>
of you telling them what they need to do to do better and them agreeing?<br/>
<br/>
Or are you there as their partner? To help them learn to be more aware of<br/>
their emotions and the build up of their emotions before they get to the<br/>
explosion stage. You think it&#39;s fast. They probably even think it&#39;s fast.<br/>
But there is a build up that they could be helped to be more aware of.<br/>
<br/>
I think you need to forget their ages and what is reasonable or not<br/>
reasonable. They are where they are and you need to be there to help them<br/>
get where they&#39;d like to be.<br/>
<br/>
Ask them if they want help in not destroying game controllers. How they<br/>
respond is going to depend on your motivations. If you are focused on<br/>
stopping them from destroying things, they&#39;re going to sense that your help<br/>
is about controlling them. If you are focused on helping them gain skills<br/>
that they&#39;d like to have, they&#39;ll be more open.<br/>
<br/>
You could suggest that they not play unless you can be there with them.<br/>
(That won&#39;t work if they are sensing you want to control them. They might<br/>
think it&#39;s a good idea if they sense that you want to help them.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s other suggestions you could make but it will all dependon whether<br/>
they see you as their partner or the protector of the stuff in the house. It<br/>
might also take some extra work to convince them that you really do want to<br/>
help them if your interactions with them have always been about changing<br/>
their behavior to behavior you think is acceptable.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well I think that a good outcome to something &quot;bad&quot; doesn&#39;t justify doing<br/>
something bad. Lots of kids have terrible times in school and end up<br/>
&quot;successful&quot; and thankful that they were pushed. But it doesn&#39;t justify<br/>
pushing in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
What does he want you to do? Ask him now while he isn&#39;t faced with going<br/>
somewhere he doesn&#39;t want to go. Does he want you to make him go? And ask<br/>
him again after you&#39;ve tried out his answer a couple of times. Ask him to<br/>
think about how he feels now that you pushing or not pushing. What does he<br/>
want you to do? It would help him be more aware of his feelings.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about the times he doesn&#39;t like it? Again, ask him what he&#39;d like you<br/>
to do. Point out the times he has really liked something after being made to<br/>
eat it and the times he hasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And if he doesn&#39;t want to be urged, what difference does it make? If you had<br/>
very limited tastes and people kept urging you to eat stuff you didn&#39;t want<br/>
to, wouldn&#39;t it be annoying?<br/>

close family and friends puts much more value on &quot;book learning&quot;   But as for <br/>
me, it makes no difference if hes does math problems or finishes a level on <br/>

smile on his face, and a sense of worth and accomplishment in his heart.    <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.. the concern is not over how many or what interests he has.  The concern <br/>
comes over the fact that even the stuff he likes and enjoys causes him <br/>
frustration and emotional upset.  I talked about the video game stuff.. But <br/>
really, it could be anything.. He loves biking, but often he will come in <br/>
angry, crying, upset, because his bike is not cooperating the way he wants it <br/>
to. .Maybe some piece of accessory is not working just right. maybe the wind <br/>
is blowing too hard.. maybe no one wants to ride with him . He loves jumping <br/>
on the trampoline,, but he could come in with similar complaints.  It seems <br/>
he is only satisfied and happy with even his limited interests for a very <br/>
short time.  Then he gets upset and angry or sad.. he feels like &quot;nothing <br/>
works for him&quot;  , like everyone and everything is against him.      And, the <br/>
other concern is that how can he know what might interest him, what he may <br/>
really excel at or enjoy if he won&#39;t try new things.. Im not talking about <br/>
overload here.. Im talking ANY new thing.. heck, maybe trying something new <br/>
once a month, or even every 2 months    But as of now, he resists anything <br/>
&quot;new&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222508643">Teresa ~ how do you handle it when he feels like everything is <br/>
against him?<br/>
<br/>
What does your son do that makes him SHINE?  <br/>
<br/>
A difficult and challenging aspect of children like this is the fact <br/>
that the reality of their body&#39;s capabilities does not match the <br/>
vision they hold in their mind.<br/>
<br/>
The KEY is to direct them to those things that they CAN do and do <br/>
well.  Those things that make them SHINE.  <br/>
<br/>
In Carol Stock Kranowitz&#39;s book *The Out of Sync Child,* she says <br/>
something like, &quot;Even the best-loved child in the world will feel <br/>
unloved.&quot;  I know what she&#39;s talking about.  It was my life.  It&#39;s my <br/>
son&#39;s life.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, they feel like many things are against them.  How you handle <br/>
that is key.<br/>
<br/>
It is imperative that you don&#39;t just write it off.  It is important <br/>
to acknowledge how he feels.  How frustrated he is.  And, yes, how <br/>
difficult life can be for him at times.<br/>
<br/>
But then it&#39;s important to move on.  Don&#39;t dwell on the negative.  Go <br/>
on to something where he can SHINE.<br/>
<br/>
WHen my son is totally frustrated, I&#39;ll hug him and say, &quot;It&#39;s a <br/>
difficult job to be Jake, isn&#39;t it?&quot;  He&#39;ll collapse in my arms and <br/>
cry.  And then I&#39;ll let him know that I think he&#39;s wonderful, and I <br/>
think he&#39;s doing a great job at being Jake.<br/>
<br/>
And then we move on to those things that make him Jake.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>
about his comic strips that he draws, or his monsters.  We&#39;ll talk <br/>
about his video games, or the book he&#39;s reading.  Or we&#39;ll curl up <br/>
together and read a book or watch a movie.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of stress and anxiety in these children&#39;s lives.  Do <br/>
what you can to move away from that and move towards the Joy and the <br/>
Love and the Strengths.<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to push anything new.  Let him stay where he is <br/>
comfortable.  Go to his world, in his place of comfort.  Meet him <br/>
there and get to know him there.  Let him enlighten your world and <br/>
let him know that his unique perspective on life enlightens your own <br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
Time helps, also.  My son would try to draw a couple of years ago, <br/>
and get so frustrated and cry.  A friend of mine told me the same <br/>
story about her 5 year old son.  He would draw something and take it <br/>
to her and angrily say, &quot;Would you just throw this away because I <br/>
HATE IT!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s what I said:  their vision does not match their physical <br/>
capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
My son stopped drawing and began working with clay (Sculpey).  He was <br/>
AMAZING with it.  He made Pokemon after Pokemon with it, and they <br/>
were WONDERFUL.<br/>
<br/>
This helped his confidence, and his motor skills.  After awhile, he <br/>
tried drawing again, and was better at it.  So he kept drawing.  Now <br/>
he&#39;s a wonderful artist and creates his own comic strips.<br/>
<br/>
I think most parents approach a frustrated child in the wrong <br/>
manner.  They always try to fix what went wrong.  That&#39;s not what the <br/>
child wants ~ especially these perfectionist children.  They want to <br/>
fix it themselves.  And right now, they just want to be frustrated <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
They are learning.  They are learning about the world.  They are <br/>
learning about themselves.  They are learning how to handle having <br/>
video games in their home.  They are learning how to handle <br/>
frustration and challenge.<br/>
<br/>
How YOU handle it and approach it will be their *teacher.*  <br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Then he gets upset and angry or sad.. he feels like &quot;nothing <br/>
works for him&quot;  , like everyone and everything is against him.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s genetic?<br/>
Maybe if you or his dad are that way he has it either genetically or by <br/>
modelling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Im talking ANY new thing.. heck, maybe trying something new <br/>
once a month, or even every 2 months    But as of now, he resists anything <br/>
&quot;new&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s happened even on this list, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Some people see the glass as half empty, some see it as  half full, and some <br/>
are quick to say that the glass sucks and that other people hate them because <br/>
they mentioned &quot;half empty&quot; to them.<br/>
<br/>
The best way I have ever seen or practiced changing children&#39;s behavior is <br/>
for me to be the way I want them to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joyce, I think this is the best advice around on parenting special-<br/>
needs kids in general. And it&#39;s also the hardest, because it is so <br/>
difficult to see your own kids struggle with things that come so <br/>
easily to others. I was relatively lucky because my special needs kid <br/>
was my first, and I threw away books like &quot;What to Expect&quot; right off <br/>
the bat, so I really didn&#39;t know (except for that gut feeling) <br/>
how &quot;behind&quot; he was, or how much extra work I was putting in <br/>
parenting him, over and above what you do with a &quot;normal&quot; kid. I only <br/>
learned that after I had my second kid and realized how easy it all <br/>
is when you don&#39;t have to deal with all that extra stuff!<br/>
<br/>
There are still things that my kid struggles with that other kids <br/>
don&#39;t, and I&#39;ve come to find that it&#39;s okay. But it doesn&#39;t make it <br/>
easier when other people don&#39;t understand and give you &quot;The look&quot; <br/>
because your kid is howling in protest that the floor is too cold and <br/>
to him it feels like his feet are getting frozen on ice cubes, so <br/>
he&#39;s really upset, but to other people, he just looks like an overly <br/>
coddled brat having a tantrum (other people&#39;s thoughts, not mine). It <br/>
just gets so wearing after awhile.<br/>
<br/>
This thread is very timely. My kid&#39;s &quot;disability&quot; doesn&#39;t pop up too <br/>
often anymore, but when it does it can be a real whammy. These are <br/>
the times I most feel like an unschooling failure - like anything I <br/>
do is wrong. Yesterday it was The Haircut. He&#39;s been growing his hair <br/>
long for a year (fine by me), but he can&#39;t brush it himself (motor <br/>
skills issues) and doesn&#39;t want me to brush it (extreme tactile <br/>
sensitivity triggers a fight or flight response every single day when <br/>
we try), but he also doesn&#39;t want it to become all matted or to be in <br/>
dreadlocks, and doesn&#39;t want to wash it or get it wet to make combing <br/>
it any easier (again, tactile sensitivity). So he had asked me to <br/>
call our haircutting person and have her come over to our house (she <br/>
is the only person who has ever been able to cut his hair, she is an <br/>
angel with a ton of patience). But when our haircutter gets here, he <br/>
starts freaking out, very loudly vocally and physically. He is <br/>
totally scared by the idea of the haircut, but also unable to deal <br/>
with any of the other possibilities. So what the heck do I do? What <br/>
ends up happening is I hold him in my lap, he continues to freak out, <br/>
and our hairdresser does the best job she can in the shortest amount <br/>
of time. I&#39;m sure she has no idea what the heck is wrong with my kid, <br/>
I attempt to explain some of it after he&#39;s disappeared upstairs. But <br/>
if he hadn&#39;t gotten his hair cut, we would&#39;ve gone through the same <br/>
freak out every day over hair brushing. Yet he doesn&#39;t want no hair <br/>
brushing or no hair cut either, he *chose* the haircut without me <br/>
even suggesting it. Now he&#39;s mourning the loss of his long hair, <br/>
which he really wanted but was unable to deal with. It all feels very <br/>
Lose-Lose-situation to me, and I&#39;ve been pretty bummed over it. If I <br/>
didn&#39;t have this child, I would think that you could go along <br/>
respecting a child and honoring their choices and it would all come <br/>
out perfectly as it does with my daughter. But some kids teach you <br/>
otherwise. Some times there is no easy way. We&#39;ve been through this <br/>
same scenario in many different variations over the years. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has read this far, thanks for letting me ramble. This is a <br/>
puzzle that I still continue to work on. It&#39;s gotten better with time <br/>
and the many things we&#39;ve done to help work through this, but we&#39;re <br/>
still not there. Funny thing is, if I tell a person that my son has <br/>
SID, they don&#39;t believe me. &quot;He looks so normal&quot;. Yeah, until haircut <br/>
time.<br/>

I used to cut Kirby&#39;s hair when he was asleep, when he was little.  I&#39;d cut <br/>
one side, and then wait for him to turn over and cut the other side.<br/>
<br/>
For years he had it long, and luckily he has the genetic advantage of <br/>
non-tangly hair.  Had his dad or I had tangly hair, the situation would have <br/>
been very much worse.  My sister&#39;s hair does tangle.  It was just luck.<br/>
<br/>
By the time he was ten or so, he could have haircuts without nitrous oxide.  <br/>
(That would have been nice, nitrous oxide shampoo times for his long hair...)<br/>

the beginning, I would think OMG this is how my kid is going to be forever! <br/>
Then it would pass. Sometimes it would pass like a like a gentle breeze, <br/>
sometimes like a kidney stone. But it would pass. And the time between <br/>
really intense sensory/behavioral issues are farther and farther in between <br/>

I made myself a sign for the bathroom mirror that says &quot;It&#39;s NOT the <br/>

going on to stress me out. So it&#39;s the hormones, my period,  the SID, it&#39;s <br/>
whatever. The unschooling doesn&#39;t succeed or fail based on one incident or a <br/>

understand each other. It&#39;s a lifetime of exploration. It&#39;s a lifetime.<br/>

cutting just the front so she can see how much easier it is to comb.<br/>

For some kinds of hair, wide-teeth combs work best.  Brushes will make things <br/>
worse sometimes.  <br/>
There are also options with girls&#39; hair, sometimes, of putting things up and <br/>
back with barettes and clips without really getting all the tangles out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Both my boys have long hair and all I have to do is remind them of what it <br/>
was like last week when they didn&#39;t want their hair combed then after a few <br/>
days decided they wanted it brushed out.  What a mess and took a lot of time <br/>
and gentle brushing to get all those knots out.  When I remind them of that <br/>
and how much easier it is if it is bushed on a daily basis they are more than <br/>
willing to sit still for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
 Also we figured out that if I braid the hair at night it helps with knots as <br/>
well.  And using a hard brush, you know the ones with the stiff plastic <br/>
bristles when the hair is wet and has lots of conditioner on it, before you <br/>
rinse the conditioner out it is easier to get through the tougher tangles.<br/>
<br/>
I do give them a choice and they even brush their own hair occasionally, just <br/>
can&#39;t reach the back very well.<br/>

be one of those babies that ends up in a dumpster, or the toddler <br/>
that is abused horribly. I&#39;m sure that many of those kids are just <br/>
extremely high needs or special kids born into families where the <br/>
parents have no internal resources to deal with them and so just flip <br/>
out or lash out. I&#39;m sorry both for the kids and the parents. It&#39;s no <br/>
easy row to hoe, even having the benefits of relatively good <br/>
parenting myself and a lot of reading beforehand about attachment <br/>
parenting, etc. I think if I was any less attached to my son at the <br/>
get-go, the outcome could&#39;ve been much worse. I have many wise women <br/>
of the internet to thank for that. And many current ones to thank as <br/>
well. Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131792323">Well, I don&#39;t think she cares about what length it is.  But Daddy does (he<br/>
likes it to be longer)! :-)  And the front is cut shorter than the rest.  I<br/>
think she has gotten phobic about combing at all, because she starts to cry<br/>
before the comb touches her hair at all sometimes. I think cutting it really<br/>
short could work, though, given a little time for her to see that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
hurt as much.  Thanks for the suggestion!<br/>

Does she want long hair? Could you cut it really short? You might suggest<br/>
cutting just the front so she can see how much easier it is to comb.. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you are feeling uncomfortable with forcing her to comb it, then that&#39;s <br/>
the voice you should listen to.<br/>
<br/>
When Casey was little, I always just kept her hair in a cute, short style <br/>
that kept the tangles to a minimum. That plus a lot of conditioner did the <br/>
trick.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254413448">We&#39;ve tried that, too, she just doesn&#39;t do it.  She holds the comb and<br/>
swipes at the top layer and then says she&#39;s done.  Her hair usually looks<br/>
about like it did before she started.  Maybe I need to lower my standards,<br/>

didn&#39;t comb her hair.  I feel like a bad Mommy!<br/>

she brushed her own <br/>
hair. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but she didn&#39;t scream, she didn&#39;t freak <br/>
out, and she accepted advise about where she missed and how she <br/>
might be better able to reach it.  It was really much nicer.<br/>
