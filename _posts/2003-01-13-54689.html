<div id="ygrps-yiv-979429973">Thaks for the list of clothing, Joyce.  I thought we had a lot of different<br/>
types of clothes here!  I wonder what a &#39;goatee&#39; is?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been able to figure out when a fetus becomes a child, so I have<br/>
backed it up to conception.  When would the eagle or the turtle in an egg<br/>
become the animal?  Even if it is only a &quot;potential&quot;...  Because I think the<br/>
life is at conception, I think abortion and child respect are incompatible.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be in favor of the death penalty - after all, it&#39;s in the Bible!<br/>
But now I don&#39;t support that either (the penalty, not the Bible).  I think<br/>
that respect for life means all life (so far human, but I may be moving<br/>
toward some veg beliefs), so whether it is young or old or possibly<br/>
criminal, I think we should honor and protect the individual.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, this can mean the way we treat infants and the way we treat<br/>
the elderly, as well as taking a position on the death penalty (I think it&#39;s<br/>
great that some gov. is commuting all the sentences in the state to life).<br/>
It can also mean calling about the possible (probable) war on the White<br/>
House # that was given earlier (202) 456-1111.  If we respect life, then it<br/>
should be all life - our children, those in the military, and people who<br/>
wear clothes that are very different from ours!  Pray for peace.<br/>
