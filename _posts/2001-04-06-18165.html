around our house. I don&#39;t think being aware of the things in life that<br/>
aren&#39;t happy and chipper positive necessarily means you have to live a dark<br/>
and dreary life. You can enjoy life to it&#39;s fullest and work hard to make<br/>
sure others (people, animals, plants, the earth, spirit) can do so also and<br/>
will be able to continue doing so for generations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377567670">Yup, I think that it is a choose of what state of mind you are in.  I see<br/>
all the &quot;bad&quot; things and I communicate that to the kidlets but not with a<br/>
depressed, whoa is me type attitude.  It is a &quot;we can make a difference&quot;<br/>
attitude and a &quot;I&#39;ll be blessed if I&#39;ll let corporate greed run over me with<br/>
hobnail boots&quot; attitude.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets are aware of the faults and are working to make it a better<br/>
world.  They aren&#39;t depressed by it but healthily (is that a word?) angry<br/>
about it.  They know the bug poisons are bad, they know about pesiticide<br/>
residue on foods, they read labels, and they are active in many areas that<br/>
are making a difference.  It hasn&#39;t made them paranoid but simply well<br/>
informed future voters that aren&#39;t going to be led around by their<br/>
collective noses.<br/>
<br/>
One wants to be a lawyer and I&#39;m thinking big government better start<br/>
gearing up now &lt;g&gt;<br/>
