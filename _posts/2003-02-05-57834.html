<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112263449">Hi!  My name is Sharon and I usually lurk here, have written a few<br/>
times.  Just curious how others here possibly would handle this...<br/>
<br/>
My 6 yo ds has decided to let his hair grow long.  My dh and I have no<br/>
problem with this, he lets us clean it no problem and it&#39;s his head.<br/>
And probably by summer he will shave it as usual.  <br/>
It is amazing how many people insist on telling him he needs a hair cut!<br/>
My own mom who is fairly open minded has even gotten into this and has<br/>
brought it up several times over the past few weeks.  She suggests a<br/>
trim to keep it from being &quot;shaggy&quot;.  But he likes it the way it is.  I<br/>
see this as part of the unschooling lifestyle -- letting make his own<br/>
decisions about his life and body.  <br/>
My mom and I actually ended up having an argument about this.  I guess<br/>
she is concerned about how others view him..just seeing a kid that needs<br/>
a haircut.  She wants to &quot;help them see he is a beautiful boy.&quot;  But one<br/>
of my points to her is those people are shallow and won&#39;t &quot;get &quot; it<br/>
anyway!  <br/>
I was very upset and angry because I regarded all of this as a power<br/>
struggle and also as a slight indication that she thought we weren&#39;t<br/>
handling this  &quot;properly&quot; or something??! She thinks she is being<br/>
helpful-- suggesting she take him to get the trim-- but when we didn&#39;t<br/>
want this help she got offended.  I think she is overstepping<br/>
boundaries. <br/>
I realize this may all sound trivial but again, to me it is the<br/>
principle of what we are striving for here.     Any thoughts, ideas,<br/>
suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks --you all have been such inspirations!  Sharon</div>

saying anything.  Now strangers think my boys are girls.  The boys are used <br/>
to it and just casually say &quot;no...we are boys&quot;.  A lot of people think it is <br/>
cool and I try to point out when I see a man with long hair.  It is that in <br/>
between stage when people say they need a hair cut.  When it gets long they <br/>
stop saying that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1738239564">My oldest son (6)always grows his hair long all winter<br/>
and usually cuts it in the summer. This is especially<br/>
offensive to dh&#39;s parents for some reason,as they see<br/>
it as unclean or uncared for. The funny thing about<br/>
that is Dh had long hair as a child and still does<br/>
now! He had shoulder lenghth hair for most of his<br/>
early childhood and from teen years to present it is<br/>
nearly waist length. Some people just seem to think<br/>
that a long haired child shows a lack of the parental<br/>
control thing. I just tell my son that it is his hair<br/>
and he can wear it however he wishes, but I tell him<br/>
that some  people may call him a girl or tell him  to<br/>
cut it so he won&#39;t be shocked and so hurt by other&#39;s<br/>
reactions.  <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time> 4 Feb 2003, at  7:31pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530481914">We&#39;ve had a bit of a different experience here. My son pierced his lip on Sunday night.<br/>
<br/>
He knew I just can&#39;t *stand* piercings there...just a personal thing with me.  Its really revolting to me, as are toungue piercings.  I can take the eyebrow, the ears, the cartilage, even a belly button.  But NOT the toungue, nose, or lip.  It just looks like a big ole silver zit.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I saw it the next morning and I told him that he can pierce what he wants but I think its totally gross!!!!  (I can tell him that because he expects me to be honest).  He was totally up front about telling me that he only did it for the shock value.  He likes to see other people&#39;s reactions.<br/>
<br/>
I *did* admit that *I* was not comfortable with it.  And I also mentioned that his girl friend&#39;s parents might not want him around their daughter if they see it.  I think he honestly hadn&#39;t thought about that.  I told him that like it or not, people *are* going to pass judgement and make decisions regarding their own kids and whether or not they would tolerate his friendship based on that little bit of shock value and I asked him if he thought it was worth that.<br/>
<br/>
I also explained that like it or not, his choice to pierce his lip might reflect in unwanted ways on me and his dad as parents, and asked him (leaving it up to him) if he would at least wait until he is 18.  <br/>
<br/>
He took it out.  It looks like it is getting infected anyway, and he&#39;d have to take it out for swim meets too (or get disqualified).  He left it out.  I&#39;m not sure of his reasons, and thats ok.  And if he REALLY has to have it, I won&#39;t make an issue out of it (and he knows that).  I just wanted him to know the reality of the social consequences and that I personally thinks its gross.<br/>
<br/>
He was ok with my feelings on it and seemed concerned about how it might reflect on me.  I appreciate his consideration of my feelings.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-645191590">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
I also have boys who occasionally have let their hair grow. My <br/>
seven-year-old especially dislikes haircuts and has often had longish <br/>
hair.  Right now it is quite long because he hasn&#39;t had it cut since <br/>
August. He says it keeps him warm in the winter!<br/>
<br/>
When faced with a persistent, interfering person, I like to use the repeat <br/>
method. Once I have stated my position adequately I calmly repeat a phrase <br/>
over and over when that person tries to argue with me. In your case, that <br/>
may be, &quot;Dylan (e.g.) likes his hair long. It is his hair and he can wear <br/>
it any way he wants.&quot; Deep calming breaths help as well :-) When she says, <br/>
&quot;Yes, but...&quot; you look her in the eye and repeat the phrase. I learned this <br/>
method at La Leche League for those people who thought four months was an <br/>
awful long time to nurse a baby, etc. You can add &quot;I&#39;m not going to argue <br/>
about this&quot; to the beginning as well. I tend to get flustered when I try to <br/>
argue; I don&#39;t have the mental agility that some people have (like my <br/>
sister-in-law) so sticking to that one phrase really helps me not get drawn <br/>
into an argument that will leave me in knots.<br/>
<br/>
Eric, my seven-y.o., uses a different method.  He looks at the person as if <br/>
they are nuts and walks away. Doesn&#39;t matter if it is his Grampie or a <br/>
stranger on the bus. Sometimes he adds a hmmmph. It&#39;s effective but I think <br/>
the reason he does this is that he doesn&#39;t yet understand what people are <br/>
doing when they say things like that.  We don&#39;t care if his hair is long so <br/>
why should anyone else care who means less or nothing to him?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sharon, your post really jumped out at me and I had to respond because we&#39;re<br/>
going through many similar things with our son right now. In fact, my dh is<br/>
also growing his hair longer at the same time, and getting alot of the same<br/>
comments that my son is!<br/>
<br/>
My son is 11 - 12 in a few months, and about 6 months ago he decided to let<br/>
his hair grow.<br/>
Well, in the past few months it has really gotten noticeable and so have the<br/>
comments about it&#39;s length!<br/>
I cannot believe the nerve of some people!<br/>
For the most part, we haven&#39;t heard a thing from strangers comments.<br/>
But our next-door neighbor (who is mr. crew-cut jock type) has had a lot to<br/>
say, and the thing that bothers me most is he says things directly to my<br/>
son, never in front of me.<br/>
He tells Ben &quot;get a hair cut - you look like a hippie&quot; and &quot;your parents let<br/>
you have long hair like that?&quot;.<br/>
Well, I think he dropped the comments when he recently saw that my husband<br/>
has noticeably longer hair, too. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The worst comments, though, have come from my husband&#39;s mother.<br/>
She has something to say just about every time we see her to both my husband<br/>
and my son.<br/>
She is always telling them to get a haircut - that they would look so much<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
I think that my husband has gotten it through to her that she better get<br/>
used to the look because he ain&#39;t changin&#39; for her and neither is my son. In<br/>
fact, he told her that his having long hair is a test to see if she really<br/>
loves him for &quot;him&quot; or for his &quot;hair&quot;.<br/>
She has laid off in the past month or so - this could also be due to a shift<br/>
in focus though because of a recent family death.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know where you&#39;re coming from. I get really defensive when people<br/>
put either my son or dh down for their length of hair. They are still the<br/>
same people on the inside, afterall. And for some reason, it really bothers<br/>
people ALOT! My son and I had a discussion about this subject just<br/>
yesterday. He was wondering why it&#39;s such a big deal to have long hair to<br/>
some people. We talked about how society has a certain expectation of how<br/>
men and women should look, and if they look different people get<br/>
uncomfortable. We talked about how it used to be that women weren&#39;t allowed<br/>
to wear pants. My son thought that was ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
My son and my husband still have their long-ish hair. We&#39;ll see how long &lt;g&gt;<br/>
it lasts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761908252">My son is ten now and has worn his hair long from about six years old. <br/>
He was often mistaken for a girl, but without that very important<br/>
socialization public schooled children get &lt;g&gt; he never felt it was an<br/>
insult if someone thought he was female.  He simply corrected them and<br/>
that was that.   We talked about the reasons people expect boys to have<br/>
short hair.  We talked about people who were rude, and people who just<br/>
hadn&#39;t thought about it, and Dylan could tell the difference and adjust<br/>
his response accordingly.<br/>
We did get grief from some family members, but repeated reminders that no<br/>
one was telling them how to wear their hair seemed to eventually work.<br/>
Dylan cut his waist length hair last summer then let it grow some.   He<br/>
cut it again in early December, some of that having to do with it getting<br/>
pulled a lot in Judo throws and holds.   He&#39;s decided to let it grow<br/>
again.   I&#39;ll have a long haired kid in the summer I guess.  <br/>
Life is so interesting.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve had similar issues with my mom as my son has decided to grow <br/>
his hair long (and it&#39;s definitely in that shaggy stage, LOL!), and <br/>
my 3 y.o. daughter decided to dye hers purple. Boy, people *really* <br/>
freak out about that one, as if it&#39;s doing some horrible damage that <br/>
a 3 y.o. can have control over what color she wants her hair. It&#39;s <br/>
non-toxic dye, what&#39;s the problem?<br/>
<br/>
In any case, what I said to my mom was something to the effect of: <br/>
You raised me, and you made your choices. You are my mom, but you are <br/>
not my kid&#39;s mom. You can respect the fact that we let them make <br/>
their own choices about clothes, hair, etc. or you can not be around <br/>
them. You can&#39;t belittle them or their choices.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a bit more blunt. When we were going out, my daughter <br/>
put on some dress-up clothes and pink fuzzy slippers. My mom <br/>
said &quot;You can&#39;t wear *that* to the theatre&quot;, and my DH said &quot;Yes she <br/>
can.&quot; End of story.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, my mom has gotten the point. :-)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I did a while ago that really helped is that I wrote <br/>
my mom a letter on mother&#39;s day, thanking her for all the things she <br/>
did that I appreciated growing up. The special birthday parties, the <br/>
camping trips, the fact that she breastfed me for a year in a culture <br/>
that really looked down on that. I think it helped her to see that my <br/>
different parenting choices are not total criticisms of her choices, <br/>
just things we choose to do differently. There is a lot that I <br/>
respect about the way my folks raised me, and some things that I <br/>
totally don&#39;t agree with. Doing this also helped her see the ways in <br/>
which she bucked the norm - breastfeeding, being a stay-at-home mom <br/>
with a college degree in an era of women&#39;s lib, etc. and I think <br/>
helped her understand better why I choose to do things differently. <br/>
After all, I&#39;m only doing what she taught me to - stick up for the <br/>
things I believe in :-)<br/>
