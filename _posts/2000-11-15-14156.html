<div id="ygrps-yiv-769350547">Why is it soooo hard for &quot;experts&quot; to admit that all children are different.<br/>
Kidlets 1, 3, 4 and 6 are social butterflys and have been since the day they<br/>
were born.  From day one, they&#39;d walk right up to strangers and talk their<br/>
ears off and in some cases straighten them up if they made mistakes (heaven<br/>
help the person that asked them &quot;why aren&#39;t you in school today, sweetie.&quot;).<br/>
Kidlets 2 and 5 were all about not wanting to have any outside contact until<br/>
they were much older and still weren&#39;t too comfortable with strangers at<br/>
first.  Now, at the ripe old age of 16, kidlet #4 has suddenly turned<br/>
shy-ish and kidlet #5 at age 12 is the next thing to a politician!<br/>
<br/>
Pre-school or daycare or anything else wouldn&#39;t have made them more<br/>
&quot;socialized.&quot;  These people need to get a life, OF THEIR OWN and live in the<br/>
real world.<br/>
