<br/>
Join us August 16th through 18th for a fantastic weekend at the lovely <br/>
Radisson Hotel Sacramento! If you haven&#39;t been to one of these conferences, <br/>
it&#39;s hard to describe what a great surprise you have in store: inspiring <br/>
talks, informative workshops, practical tips, an exhibit hall of interesting <br/>
learning materials, and fun activities for everyone in the family. This all <br/>
takes place in a resort-like atmosphere filled with well over 1,000 <br/>
homeschoolers, all basking in the celebration of this richly rewarding way of <br/>
family life. <br/>
<br/>
This year we are delighted and honored to bring you the following keynote <br/>
presenters: <br/>
Jane Healy, teacher and educational psychologist, author of award-winning <br/>
books, Your Child&#39;s Growing Mind, Endangered Minds, and Failure to Connect. <br/>
Distinguished researcher and writer, Frank Smith, author of over 20 books on <br/>
education and language, including Insult to Intelligence, and The Book of <br/>
Learning and Forgetting. Other featured speakers include an impressive <br/>
gathering of talent and wisdom of experience: Mary Griffith, David Albert, <br/>
Richard Prystowsky, Laurel Schmidt, Wes Beach, Donald Asher, Sandra Dodd, <br/>
Marty Layne, Ronaele Berry, and Lenore Hayes. <br/>
<br/>
Add to this a large number of informative workshops with a wide range of <br/>
subjects and presenters like Anna Kealoha and Ann Zeise, Pam Sorooshian, Jan <br/>
Hunt, and lots of panels and round table discussion groups for sharing with <br/>
other parents. <br/>
<br/>
Once again, the unique family program will offer lots of fun for all ages; <br/>
and the teens, as always, will be especially excited about being able to meet <br/>
peers from all over the state in a wide array of special workshops and fun <br/>
activities.     <br/>

When I was there last time, it was FREEZING at night and very pleasant in the <br/>

her keynote speach!!! She was hospitalized the entire weekend! :-(   But <br/>

&lt;&lt; I am a new member.  I just withdrew my 7 yr old, Bailey from school <br/>
 before Christmas.  I have received a million emails since I joined, <br/>
 but I&#39;m a little confused as to how this works.  Most of the emails <br/>
 don&#39;t make any sense to me because they are replies to someone <br/>
 else&#39;s question, that I most of the time do not see.  Can you give <br/>
 me some pointers?  Also, I&#39;ve seen reference to a conference and <br/>
 meetings.  How can I find out about these, and start getting <br/>
 involved with other homeschoolers/unschoolers?  Look forward to <br/>
 getting to know some of you!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Teresa, and anyone else that just joined...I can&#39;t keep up anymore!! <br/>
If you set your email preference to &quot;digest&quot;, you&#39;ll get a whole bunch of <br/>
posts in one email, easier to keep up with and skim the ones that don&#39;t <br/>
interest you.<br/>
If you read for a bit you will get the &quot;feel&quot; and know what the questions are <br/>
that are being answered...it takes a little bit, cuz some of the answers <br/>
could be from questions that came along yesterday. Once you get going, you&#39;ll <br/>
be fine.<br/>
Or you could browse the archives, but it takes a long time!<br/>
The conference everyone is talking about is the BOMB....awesome, incredible <br/>
and a must do!!<br/>
Here is the link to their website, which may be last years info. still, but <br/>
I&#39;m betting Kelly will have it updated before too long.<br/>
<br/>

I just looked and it is indeed the 2002 conference info. which will give you <br/>
a really good idea of how exciting and wonderful this event is.<br/>
And you can see pictures of a bunch of people that post here, Sandra, Joyce, <br/>
