<div id="ygrps-yiv-932006153">I am a rug braider.  I don&#39;t know if I can explain it in writing, but you<br/>
lace it like shoes, pulling tightly each time.  I use a heavy cord made<br/>
specifically for rug braiding.  The rug  is not sewn together. And start<br/>
with one long cord and pull it through half way at your starting point and<br/>
you can lace with both ends like a shoe.  If I can be more specific, let me<br/>
know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008016773">okay have you ever done a hidden stitch hem where you put the needle in the fold and then come out one end and stitch then back through the fold and then another stitch? sorta like this....     _&#39;_&#39;_&#39; except the stitch which is the on the top should be on the bottom by the lines. Does that make sense? Ok, you do the same thing, coil it go inside the braid then stitch except you catch both sides go inside the other side and then stitch back sorta like this _&#39;-&#39;_&#39;-&#39;_ does that make sense??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685759748">The kidlets went to a &quot;cottage&quot; fair a couple of summers ago and they did a<br/>
braided rug from old wool coats.  The LOL that taught the class had them use<br/>
a table top sew with a curved needle and thread that was neutral.  They did<br/>
more of a weaving stitch than and sewing stitch.  The curved needle went in<br/>
at an edge, curved and came out a little further down on the outside of the<br/>
inside of the coil.  Then she flipped the needle the opposite way and did<br/>
the same on the inside of the piece that was continuing the coil.    As she<br/>
went along she pulled it tight and you couldn&#39;t see the thread at all, it<br/>
just disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t really clear but if you&#39;d like I can send you a diagram<br/>
like she gave the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859085944">Stitch it from the back...the stitches will show, but they are supposed to.<br/>
<br/>
I did continuous stitching, catching up every few inches, back to braiding<br/>
and then stitch together again.<br/>
<br/>
Essentially I used a big cross stitch.  Purchased rugs have the stitching<br/>
show, so I didn&#39;t worry about it.  However, If you want it to not show, use<br/>
clear or matching thread.  Run the needle under the fabric, come out where<br/>
you want the connecting stitch to be, take a stitch in both pieces and run<br/>
the needle and thread back under the fabric to the next stitch location.<br/>
Hope that makes some sort of sense.  In order to keep the rug sturdy, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t go very far between stitches.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573065844">Hi, Mary Ellen!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone has already responded to this, because I&#39;ve gotten <br/>
only about 5 messages from this list all day, so I figure I&#39;m missing some, <br/>
but here goes...<br/>
<br/>
I happen to have the Tightwad Gazette out from the library, and she says <br/>
&quot;Originally, braids were hand-sewn together, but in the 1940s a faster and <br/>
stronger technique was developed: lacing through the braids, not the fabric, <br/>
with a blunt needle or a Braidkin, a flat, curved tool that costs about <br/>
$1.50.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Later, she says, &quot;the biggest expense is the thread to lace the braids <br/>
together. Although some suggest using carpet and button thread, twine or kite <br/>
string, my sources said these won&#39;t hold up for more than five years. A <br/>
stronger but more expensive thread is six-ply linen (or three ply for small <br/>
rugs).&quot;<br/>

thread that comes in colors that might be better, take more wear and tear, <br/>
and might blend in just fine.  Or use a contrasting color, but that&#39;s a <br/>
different look.<br/>

Sounds like fun!<br/>
