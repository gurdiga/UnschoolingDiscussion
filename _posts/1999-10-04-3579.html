&lt;&lt; And Faith, please know that all this is in no way aimed at you.  You seem<br/>
 like a very caring person online and you were just offering something to<br/>
 help out in response to a request for advice.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
Faith! {{{{{{ }}}}}}} everyone is on your side and trying to steer you away <br/>
from something you would hate.  Lots of caring here, not fussin at you!<br/>
