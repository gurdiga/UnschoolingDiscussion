Hey!!  Here is a ISP that sends all of its profits to organizations that<br/>
support nurturing children!<br/>
<br/>
I am very excited about it- it sounds wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
You can pick your e-mail address like - bronwen@homeschooling family.com  -<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bronwen@...">bronwen@...</a>  , there are 30 to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
and it is cheap!  Please check it out :-)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Bronwen</div>
