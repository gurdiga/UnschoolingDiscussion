<div id="ygrps-yiv-850615797">Hi~<br/>
 I posted the original violin question....and I did get my dd one on ebay.<br/>
I tried to find one that had all the &quot;right&quot; qualities...so time will tell.<br/>
  (Thank you so much JJ for asking your friend. I do appreciate it...and all <br/>
others that have given advice)<br/>
.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I guess I don&#39;t truly understand this cardboard box idea - especially for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the child who has been asking for a real violin consistently for the last<br/>
two years.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Well... I know for a fact my dd would not go for a &quot;box&quot;... ( she&#39;s made many <br/>
already herself over the years&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;). That might be appropriate if <br/>
&quot;I&quot; was to suggest she learn violin...but not now , when she is so passionate <br/>
about it on her own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;As for the china analogy, Jayn has several tea sets. Some are china. She<br/>
 </span></blockquote>also has a number of fragile china dolls. She knows they are breakable and<br/>
plays with them accordingly. Some have had broken limbs from accidents, and<br/>
I have repaired them.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 This reminds me...Chloe asked for a Nativity set for Christmas last year<br/>
( age 4)...she wanted her very own. <br/>
   I hard a hard time finding a child&#39;s one..so I got her a &quot;china one&quot;. She <br/>
was so very careful and treated it with the utmost respect. Now and then I did <br/>
have to glue on hands that fell off by accident &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. <br/>
Children ARE very capable beings.<br/>
<br/>
 I can&#39;t wait to see those blue eyes on Christmas morning...wide-eyed and <br/>
speechless no doubt &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
