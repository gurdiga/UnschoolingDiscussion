<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  Ask at any nursing home for the supply clerk.  They have large boxes<br/>
that diapers came in that is good for blankets and clothes.  They have<br/>
smaller, sturdier boxes that latex gloves came in for packing your heavier<br/>
items.  If anyone in your household is allergic to latex, ask for only the<br/>
boxes vynal gloves come in because the latex dust gets on everything.  Ask<br/>
them what day their shipment comes in because they probably will need the<br/>
boxes picked up right away.  There is never enough room to store them.<br/>

    Thanks so much! :-) I would have never thought of nursing homes.<br/>

&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>
is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>
excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>
the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>
analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>
grace.&quot;<br/>
