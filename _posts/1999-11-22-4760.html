&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Over a 40-year career, the difference in earnings between a high school<br/>
&gt; education and a college education is about $1 million, he told CNN.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;That&#39;s the value of a college education,&quot; said Caperton, a former West<br/>
&gt; Virginia governor. And even if it requires loans, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; anywhere in the world where you can make an investment and make that kind<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey Governor Caperton:<br/>
<br/>
Ever heard of starting your own business?  Guess what, hundreds of thousands<br/>
of people without college degrees do it all of the time and many of them get<br/>
returns which make your college-education-investment returns look like<br/>
peanuts.<br/>
<br/>
I fear you&#39;ve not been doing your homework lately.  Shame shame especially<br/>
for a man in your position.<br/>
