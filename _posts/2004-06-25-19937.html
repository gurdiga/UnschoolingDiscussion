<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985408693">Hi,<br/>
My name is Christine and we live in Fairbanks, Alaska.<br/>
I signed up for this list just a few days ago and I am looking forward to getting support and ideas and my questions answered about unschooling.  <br/>
I have read and heard about unschooling for years, but just recently decided it was right for us!  We have two boys, one is 9 and one is 11.  We have been busy with summer time activities such as biking, jumping on our trampoline, walking down to the river and digging in the mud and playing little league.  Summers are so short up here, we just take advantage of every warm, sunny moment!<br/>
Looking forward to hearing from all of you!<br/>
<br/>

This list is often very quiet, but there&#39;s more than you could probably read <br/>
at some other kinda-related places:<br/>

But all that said, throw your questions out here if you want to also!<br/>
