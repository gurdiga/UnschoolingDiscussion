<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715146713"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just recently joined this group in hopes of seeking support. This <br/>
&gt; includes<br/>
&gt; my relearning or rethinking what society has brainwashed me with as <br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &quot;normal or ok&quot; and though I&#39;ll get flamed by the obvious monopoly, I <br/>
&gt; feel I<br/>
&gt; must say something as the posts below really upset me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It one thing to disagree with someone, but to do so in such a <br/>
&gt; disrespectful<br/>
&gt; and undignified way is really upsetting to me. Where is the peace in <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; type of reply? Where is the love & understanding. Intolerance and <br/>
&gt; impatience<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t tools for teaching and I am here to learn.I will make mistakes <br/>
&gt; in my<br/>
&gt; parenting path and I will disagree with people here as we are all not <br/>
&gt; alike<br/>
&gt; nor are our styles of &quot;parenting&quot; and that should all be ok.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I shouldn&#39;t feel afraid to post in fear I&#39;ll get slammed by certain <br/>
&gt; members<br/>
&gt; like Oom. I didn&#39;t feel she was accusing or labeling anyone in <br/>
&gt; particular,<br/>
&gt; just sharing an opinion. So why attack? I&#39;m positive, I too, will get a <br/>
&gt; heap<br/>
&gt; of flaming, but I find this terribly uncomfortable and unfair. I&#39;d be <br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; more willing to listen to a non-reactionary gentle reply. It&#39;s a bit <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; the pot calling the kettle black to accuse of attack and then retaliate <br/>
&gt; by<br/>
&gt; attacking back as well. Non-reaction is an emotionally adult way to <br/>
&gt; handle<br/>
&gt; such things, not more insults and accusations or assumptions. Give the <br/>
&gt; topic<br/>
&gt; up Oom, you don&#39;t have a chance. You&#39;ve already been hung before tried. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen it happen before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the 5th time I&#39;ve been too intimidated to post because of this <br/>
&gt; type<br/>
&gt; of reaction. I honestly don&#39;t think Oom was name calling, etc... She is <br/>
&gt; on<br/>
&gt; another list that I have been on and appears to be a gentle soul.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can&#39;t we agree to disagree on certain subject, treat each other with <br/>
&gt; respect<br/>
&gt; and dignity?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wish you all well. I doubt I&#39;ll post after this out of fear. I feel<br/>
&gt; terrible about this as I still have many many questions and came seeking<br/>
&gt; help on many issues as I feel very alone in our unschooling journey. <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; shame a few ruin it for the many. :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck to all and PEACE,<br/>
&gt; Jeva<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *********************************************<br/>
&gt; Since you know SO much and seem to dislike this list SO much, what&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; deal?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your way is working great for you, just go do it!  Because your<br/>
&gt; commentary<br/>
&gt; and advice aren&#39;t adding to unschooling peace and prosperity.<br/>

&gt; Actually?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Huh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WE KNOW THAT.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And you used it of boys in general and it seemed of your boys in <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly my circumstances, and (almost) exactly what I was thinking!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I just read your articles elsewhere on the web and was very <br/>
impressed with what you wrote, but when I saw your posts here, the <br/>
hostility shocked me.<br/>
<br/>
As the old addage goes, &quot; you catch more bees with honey than vinegar&quot;. <br/>
(anyway, something like that...) I think anyone is probably going to get <br/>
defensive if attacked, although Oom seemed to be responding without <br/>
attacking back. I also think picking apart posts really takes things out <br/>
of context and leads to unintended nastiness.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree that spanking is wrong. I got ONE  &quot;swat&quot; with a paddle <br/>
as punishment in Jr. High School from the principal( I hope that this is <br/>
outlawed now--it was punishment for tardiness) and I&#39;m still mad at that <br/>
man today, twenty years on! It wasn&#39;t the pain--although it did <br/>
hurt--but the utter humiliation and rage I felt towards him afterwards. <br/>
I used to like him, too-- but never again.<br/>
<br/>
As I learned about myself when I first started attending La Leche <br/>
meetings (breastfeeding group), and I believe this to be true of most of <br/>
us, is that you do not always really Hear what is being said until you <br/>
are ready to hear it. There may come a time when someone who spanks (or <br/>
occasionally slaps) is ready to &quot;hear &quot; what opponents say against it. <br/>
Then he or she will remember those gentle voices and , I hope , stop.<br/>

We did resolve our <br/>
problems, we&#39;re all doing okay, except my dh just now wondered why I&#39;m <br/>
wasting my <br/>
time arguing with a bunch of total hypocrites.  He read that you folks <br/>
thought <br/>
it was okay to keep a child away from grandparents--which means, kids have <br/>
freedom until the minute they want something that bothers YOU.  You are <br/>
dishonest <br/>
and out of contact with reality.  What is more dangerous, a critical <br/>
grandparent, or getting hit by a truck?  I also shared the story with my son, <br/>
who <br/>
laughed and said he doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;unschooled&quot; if that&#39;s what it means.  <br/>
He <br/>
doesn&#39;t, and I will leave with great relief.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To me this entire post was attacking. Laura D<br/>

stick around long enough to learn that unschooling is not something that <br/>
kids have done to them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t go to school. Unschooling is the word I use so others might <br/>
easily and quickly understand what our lives are like.<br/>
