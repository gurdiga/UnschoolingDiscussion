<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok, y&#39;all---many of you musicians: How do y&#39;all feel about this--especially<br/>
&gt; as UNschoolers? Do you prefer conductors? Can they make a difference to you?<br/>
&gt; Or does it feel like meddling in what YOU know?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anything under 20 can easily live without a conductor, in my book.  However,<br/>
you have to have at least a core group that works together regularly and has<br/>
a vision for the group sound (I know that sounds wrong, but it&#39;s the words<br/>
we use...).  You can&#39;t just get 20 people together and fight it out in a<br/>
week.  It takes time.<br/>
<br/>
Anything much more than 20 needs a decent or better conductor.  I&#39;ve been in<br/>
orchestras of 100 that would have played better without the conductor they<br/>
had, though.  <br/>
<br/>
My favorite conductor story is from college; I was sitting in a rehearsal<br/>
with a man named Charles Zachery Bornstein, who as a child met Bernstein,<br/>
and was fond of telling us the story over and over, and pointing out that<br/>
his name was only ONE letter different than the master&#39;s.  Similarities<br/>
stopped there, as far as I was concerned!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, ol&#39; Chuck (as we referred to him) was on his podium whining<br/>
again, &quot;You&#39;re not LOOKING at the CONDUCTOR.  I don&#39;t know WHY I&#39;m even<br/>
HERE.&quot;  And my roommate, from the other side of the orchestra, announced,<br/>
&quot;Neither do we.&quot;  Nobody could stop laughing!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t figure out WHAT a conductor really DOES! &lt;G&gt; I figure that if <br/>
everyone KNOWS his part, that this guy just HAS to be superfluous! &lt;BWG&gt; But <br/>
I enjoy watching him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With small groups, like a quartet, they don&#39;t need a conductor because <br/>
they&#39;re all following one person.  Same with madrigals singers.  They <br/>
practice together a lot, and in a performance they are, to some extent, <br/>
&quot;singing along&quot; with the lead singer.  You usually can&#39;t tell from looking <br/>
unless just as they start three are looking at one of them.<br/>
<br/>
But with an orchestra they&#39;re not working  from memory and they&#39;re not <br/>
looking around much.   Also with small-group music, each person can see the <br/>
other people&#39;s parts.  They&#39;re singing or playing one of three or four or <br/>
five parts, but they can see what the other people are doing.  So if they <br/>
come in right after a certain run or section, they see on the paper that the <br/>
other people have finished; they hear it while they see it, and they come in.<br/>
<br/>
For an orchestra, only the conductor has the music that shows all the parts  <br/>
(the score).  The others have individual sheets with JUST their own parts on. <br/>
 If they&#39;re resting for a long time (others are playing and they&#39;re not) <br/>
their music probably just shows a black square with a number on the top.  And <br/>
sometimes that&#39;s a big number.  If your music says you don&#39;t do anything for <br/>
another 124 measures, it&#39;s good to have someone to &#39;cue you&#39; when it&#39;s nearly <br/>
your turn to come in and to point at you just as you&#39;re in.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more than that, that conductors do, but in simplest practical terms, <br/>
that&#39;s part of it.<br/>
