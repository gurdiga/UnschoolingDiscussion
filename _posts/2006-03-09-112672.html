<div id="ygrps-yiv-452709939">Someone posted this to another list and gave me permission to post it here. <br/>
It is an interview with one of the speakers at the Maryland homeschooling <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if there really is such a thing as a hierarchy of knowledge or <br/>
if she (or someone else) concocted such an assumption out of thin air. It <br/>
sounds to me that she has a moneymaking agenda to promote, which she does by <br/>
rubbishing other philosophies, including unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As far as her comments on math are concerned, my two little ones are doing <br/>
algebra already when they play with cuisenaire blocks, even they don&#39;t know <br/>
the &quot;arithmetic&quot;. Or am I missing the point here?<br/>

Interview with Lisa VanDamme, MHEA Conference Keynote Speaker<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt;Lisa, you contend that the Hierarchy of Knowledge is the most<br/>
neglected issue in education.  What is the Hierarchy of Knowledge and why is<br/>
it important?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa VanDamme&lt;To say that knowledge is hierarchical means that there is a<br/>
necessary order to the acquisition of knowledge. Before you can learn<br/>
calculus, you must learn algebra; before you can learn algebra, you must<br/>
know arithmetic; before you learn arithmetic, you must grasp the concept of<br/>
a number. This fact, that knowledge&lt;to be real, meaningful knowledge&lt;must be<br/>
gained in a specific order is generally understood in the subject of math,<br/>
but is woefully neglected in many other areas. The most abstract principles<br/>
of science are taught as bolts from the blue to be memorized, with no<br/>
presentation of the observations and intermediate principles that led to<br/>
their discovery and that render them meaningful. Controversial political<br/>
events are discussed and analyzed when students do not have the knowledge of<br/>
history that would make an informed, intelligent judgment possible. These<br/>
rampant inversions of the hierarchy of knowledge are turning children into<br/>
passive parrots able to recite abstract formulas&lt;and unable to think.<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt;Homeschoolers have the great opportunity to avoid most of the<br/>
teaching pitfalls that we see in most schools, public or private&lt;is the<br/>
Hierarchy of Knowledge something that homeschoolers should pay particular<br/>
attention to?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa VanDamme&lt;If we want our children to be truly educated, to have a vast<br/>
store of crucial knowledge that they grasp deeply and independently, then<br/>
education must be radically reconceived with respect for the hierarchy of<br/>
knowledge. Educators must ensure, at every step, that the child possesses<br/>
the prerequisite information to clearly understand any new item of knowledge<br/>
for himself. This approach cannot be found in today�s schools; any parent<br/>
who recognizes its crucial importance has no choice but to take his child�s<br/>
education into his own hands.<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt; There is a wide range of educational approaches in the<br/>
homeschool community. I can see how a parent with a more traditional<br/>
approach would see value in the Hierarchy of Knowledge, but what would be<br/>
the value to a parent who follows a hands-off, discovery educational<br/>
approach for their children?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lisa VanDamme&lt;I do not think such an approach is consistent with a<br/>
hierarchical method. If a child is truly left �hands-off� to make his own<br/>
�discovery,� he is either limited to the primitive discoveries that an<br/>
immature mind can make totally on his own, or he explores, without context<br/>
or guidance, the advanced discoveries available to him in books and modern<br/>
technology. In the former case, his concepts will be at such a simple level<br/>
that hierarchy is irrelevant; in the latter, he will necessary learn random<br/>
facts, formulas, theories, and ideas, out of order, without their<br/>
foundations&lt;and consequently will have no real knowledge at all.<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt;I have heard you voice criticisms of the classical educational<br/>
approach promoted in the book, The Well Trained Mind. Many homeschoolers<br/>
have this book. What do you find objectionable about it, from the<br/>
perspective of hierarchy?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa VanDamme&lt;The Well-Trained Mind has many virtues, but much of the<br/>
curriculum it advocates violates the hierarchy of knowledge. One way it does<br/>
so is in the recommendation of classic novels for children. For first<br/>
through fourth-graders, for example, The Well-Trained Mind recommends, among<br/>
other things: Gulliver�s Travels, a satirical commentary on 18th-century<br/>
English society; Victor Hugo�s Les Miserables, whose theme is, �The<br/>
injustice of society toward its lower classes�; and the poems of Wordsworth,<br/>
which denounce selfish materialism and encourage a retreat to the simple<br/>
purity of nature. The classics assume the cognitive context of an adult.<br/>
They are filled with romance, psychological insights, philosophic<br/>
principles, and other content that makes them remote from the knowledge and<br/>
experience of a child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt;Let me switch to another topic you will be presenting in a<br/>
workshop, conceptual learning.  What do you mean by �conceptual learning�?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa VanDamme&lt;It is important, in every subject area, to stress conceptual<br/>
understanding, to ensure that a child truly understands the meaning of what<br/>
is he doing, and does not just develop a rote, automatic, ability to do it.<br/>
In math, for example, it is important that a child not simply memorize that<br/>
he must carry or borrow a number, but that he grasp what it means to carry<br/>
or borrow a number. Certain pedagogical methods, such as requiring students<br/>
to verbally explain their processes in math, help to promote this conceptual<br/>
understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt;You are unknown to most of the homeschooling community, at<br/>
least in the East.  What would you like to say to our homeschool families<br/>
that will encourage them to take advantage of the value you have to offer at<br/>
our April 1 conference?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa VanDamme&lt;In the course of homeschooling small groups of children for<br/>
seven years, I discovered what education could be: how knowledgeable,<br/>
thoughtful, and mature students could become in the course of their<br/>
schooling, and how enthusiastic they could be about the process. I have<br/>
since translated these principles into my own �home-away-from-home-school,�<br/>
VanDamme Academy, with astounding success. The principles of hierarchy and<br/>
conceptual education are two of the cornerstones of this unique and<br/>
exceptional program, and I think parents dedicated to educational<br/>
excellence&lt;as many homsechoolers are&lt;stand to benefit from an understanding<br/>
of these issues.<br/>
<br/>
Manfred Smith&lt;Thank you Lisa.  I am looking forward to your presentations<br/>
and I�m certain that we will not be disappointed!</div>

the idea exists.<br/>
There are all KINDS of ideas people define and write about and &quot;do  <br/>
research&quot; about and do masters&#39; theses and doctoral dissertations  <br/>
about, so they MUST exist.  There they are, on paper in universities  <br/>
EVERYwhere.  The entire education industry thrives on the existence  <br/>
of those things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444554865">I think this relates to the heirarchy going from the lowest form<br/>
Content/Knowledge to the higher learning processes. This is often refered to<br/>
Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy or hierarchy.<br/>

Most teaching is done at the knowledge level (memorization) but should be<br/>
pushed to the higher end Synthesis and Evaluation (Using the material you<br/>
know).<br/>

built on the assumption that the students have last year&#39;s material.   <br/>
They know it doesn&#39;t work, so every year they review, and then add to  <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re doing assembly line teaching, though, and that changes things.<br/>
<br/>
People can only learn something if it connects to something they  <br/>
already know; that does seem true.  But that connection doesn&#39;t need  <br/>
to go in any one direction.<br/>
<br/>
In school life is divided into subject areas.  Science teachers don&#39;t  <br/>
expect that they can connect their presentations to math or history  <br/>
or English, to music, art or theatre.  But in any individual, those  <br/>
kinds of interconnected ideas are present.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can count on that instead of on methodical presentations  <br/>
over a thirteen year program.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439576075">There are plenty of real life examples where people learned the &quot;higher <br/>
order&quot; stuff first, and learned the lower level stuff as a by product or at <br/>
the same time or not at all.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that you *can&#39;t* learn one thing without knowing something else <br/>
first is just more educational gobbledy-gook.<br/>

Since her information is for people with a completely different primary goal<br/>
