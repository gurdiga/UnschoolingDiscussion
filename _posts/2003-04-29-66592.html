If the things you think you&#39;re doing for another person are things <br/>
which, if rejected by the person you&#39;re doing them for, would lead <br/>
you to feel angry or to call the person ungrateful, then you&#39;re <br/>
really doing them to feel good about yourself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do things for my children because I love them and because they like being <br/>
spoiled (my older daughters term, not mine).  My oldest daughter lives on her <br/>
own in an apartment within a few miles of me.  She works hard and long hours, <br/>
she often brings work home with her.  She lives alone, no pets.  Her dog she <br/>
got in college is here, by her choice, we are all here.  She enjoys company, <br/>
she doesn&#39;t so much like to cook.  She comes over most nights for dinner.  A <br/>
fairly new habit is her having Friday night dinner/game night at one of her <br/>
friends parents from work.  Do I resent that?  Of course not, I&#39;m happy that <br/>
she enjoys the company of others and is being fed and having a fun time.  Do <br/>
I feel rejected that she went to Kari&#39;s instead of here?  Not at all. <br/>
<br/>
My older son lives in his own house, farther away than my daughter but still <br/>
in our town.  He works hard, long hours, often driving four hours each day to <br/>
and from work.  His girlfriend works, sometimes, she doesn&#39;t like to cook at <br/>
all.  He likes to eat here.  He likes to get his meals served to him.  He <br/>
likes that someone thought about what he likes and doesn&#39;t when preparing a <br/>
meal.  He likes to spend time with his family and fool around with his <br/>
brother and sisters and dad and he likes sometimes to have long talks with <br/>
his mother.  He has lots of bills to pay.  Adult life is sometimes a <br/>
struggle.  He&#39;s recovering from a drug problem in his past.  He&#39;s learning to <br/>
be a strong adult and find his way in the world.  Sometimes he will call and <br/>
say he can&#39;t make it for dinner but he will be around later for dessert.  <br/>
That&#39;s fine with me too.  Sometimes he&#39;s tired and he doesn&#39;t come over at <br/>
all and just orders in.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
I do find joy in having all my children gathered around the table, eating and <br/>
conversing and loving one another but it&#39;s not something I would resent my <br/>
children for if they didn&#39;t show up.<br/>
<br/>
If I never saw my children I would miss them terribly, I would long for their <br/>
company, I&#39;d probably go visit them but I would never resent them.<br/>
<br/>
Home is a refuge to them, a place to know you are loved, that you are taken <br/>
care of, a familiar place.  My oldest daughter once said to me that when she <br/>
turned in to the neighborhood (coming home from college) it felt almost like <br/>
a cozy worn wonderful quilt was being wrapped around her and walking in the <br/>
door to the smell of her favorite foods was like climbing up in your mothers <br/>
lap and snuggling when she was little.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How could you ever be resentful of such wonderful creatures as your children? <br/>
 Wait, I know you could, my mother hated every minute of motherhood.  I <br/>
don&#39;t, I love it.<br/>
<br/>
Soon enough they will have families and even more life demands than the do <br/>
already.  Why NOT do the little things they enjoy and look forward to while <br/>
you can?<br/>
<br/>
Everything I do for my children comes from a place of love.  If they don&#39;t <br/>
want it, they are free to say so.  I&#39;ve been told no many times and I&#39;ve <br/>
never resented my children, I only took it as their right to say no about <br/>
something that concerns them.<br/>
<br/>
Life is often times hard when you are just beginning on your own.  I try to <br/>
do thing they enjoy and look forward to, maybe that long day and even longer <br/>
drive home in traffic won&#39;t seem so bad surrounded by love and things done <br/>
lovingly with you in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s just about honoring the most precious gifts I&#39;ve ever received <br/>
and treating them as special as they are to me.<br/>
<br/>
It does work for us anyway.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Your example about cooking a meal for your daughter unfortunately <br/>
&gt; &gt;brought up a bad memory for me of the last time my mother ever <br/>
&gt; &gt;spanked me.  She&#39;d bought cookies at one of those stores in the mall, <br/>
&gt; &gt;and she chose three different flavors that she thought I&#39;d like.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;When she brought them home, she asked me which kind I wanted, and I <br/>
&gt; &gt;said, &quot;None, thanks, I&#39;m not in the mood for cookies.&quot;  Well, she <br/>
&gt; &gt;knows how much I love cookies, and she&#39;d spent time and money <br/>
&gt; &gt;carefully selecting cookies especially for me and she asked again <br/>
&gt; &gt;which kind I wanted.  Now I&#39;m not usually one to turn down a cookie, <br/>
&gt; &gt;but that day I seriously wasn&#39;t in the mood for one.  And she lost <br/>
&gt; &gt;her temper and spanked me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s terrible, I&#39;m sorry it brought back such a bad memory for you.  If <br/>
Cait didn&#39;t want cookies, I&#39;d probably just eat them myself and then she&#39;d <br/>
probably ask me for them after the last crumb was eaten!<br/>
<br/>
I remember when my now 18 year old was probably three maybe... he was angry <br/>
at me for something, I don&#39;t remember now what it was, but he looked at me <br/>
and said &quot;fine, I&#39;m never going to eat dinner&quot;, I thought it was funny and <br/>
told him that it was fine with me if he didn&#39;t want dinner.  He then decided <br/>
to tell me he was NEVER going to eat again, again I just told him that was <br/>
perfectly OK with me if he never ate again, but if he decided he was hungry, <br/>
to let me know.<br/>
<br/>
The other kids have often used that with him through the years when he would <br/>
be angry about something, he does have a temper and they could often calm him <br/>
with laughter by saying &quot;hey John what are you gonna do? NEVER eat again?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your story, while I know it was painful for you, it <br/>
brought back a memory of my children that brought a smile to my face today!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for sharing.<br/>

This is so idyllic.  It sounds to me as if you and your family are doing just <br/>
fine.  :-)  I would REALLY suggest that you just relax and let this happen.  <br/>
If your mothering instincts are as good as your descriptions make them appear <br/>
to be, you&#39;ll do fine with unschooling, too.  Right now, your anxieties about <br/>
*getting it right* seem to be exhausting to you and to a lot of us.  Trust <br/>
yourself.  You have a lot going for you.  Know that, and just let go. <br/>
<br/>
Peace and blessing,<br/>
