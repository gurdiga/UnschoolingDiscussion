<div id="ygrps-yiv-995047763">&lt;&lt;but are they always ready for whatever, whenever?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe that as long as kids are in secure relationships where they can<br/>
discuss anything that is bothering them, they will be ok and will not stray<br/>
too far outside of their comfort zone, particularly homeschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Kids in ps tend to have more fractured relationships with their parents<br/>
(being separated so much) and a heavier reliance on peer pressure.  The kids<br/>
are often cajoled, teased and threatened into doing things, all sorts of<br/>
things, they don&#39;t feel comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that straying outside the comfort zone in a loving atmosphere<br/>
can be a good thing.  Zach (8) is a nervous, worrying kind of kid.  He was<br/>
introduced to Jurassic Park at a friend&#39;s house and had nightmares, scared<br/>
to go upstairs by himself, etc..  He then pestered and pestered to rent<br/>
Jurassic Park III.  I told him I didn&#39;t think it was a good idea, remember<br/>
how scared you got , etc., etc..  Finally rented it for him.  He spent most<br/>
of the movie hiding behind his hands.  Again , lots of fears but much less<br/>
intense.  Then Zach saw Jurassic Park video at the library.  Pester, pester<br/>
to get the movie.  OK, says I.  He has watched it pretty much non-stop for 2<br/>
days.  No longer scared, asking lots of questions about dinosaurs, their<br/>
visual systems, herbivores vs. carnivores, etc..<br/>
<br/>
By trusting him to step outside of where he and I both felt comfortable,<br/>
Zach was able to conquer his fears and take control.<br/>
