<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144852572">Just one more reason to be glad one&#39;s children are not in kiddy prison!<br/>
BTW, the program they are proposing in lieu of the testing for salmonella<br/>
has had little testing done to prove that it is effective and on testing<br/>
done to see the long term effects on children.  AND, the real reason, big<br/>
money to be made by the folks that do the irradiation!<br/>
