<div id="ygrps-yiv-372775860">I was just thinking today what a different parent I am than only 1/2 <br/>
year ago.  I took my boys to the story time at the bookstore this <br/>
morning.  Of course, my little one is picking up every book, <br/>
ignoring the reading and threw his cookie at a little girl who <br/>
wanted his book (ooppss).  I really did not care, except for the <br/>
cookie thing ;)  They had these worksheets to color at the end and I <br/>
asked my 5yo if he wanted to do those or go play with his brother <br/>
who was already over at the thomas toys.  He went to play, and the <br/>
fact that he turned down the &quot;educational&quot; activity did not bother <br/>
me at all.  In fact, it looked pretty boring compared to wandering <br/>
the store. <br/>
<br/>
I offered my 5 yo all sorts of books.  Of course the only ones that <br/>
get him excited are &quot;Captian Underpants&quot; and &quot;Yu-gi-oh&quot;..LOL!  Fine, <br/>
that is what we get.  I never would have done that before.  I would <br/>
have told him those were for older kids and directed him to other <br/>
areas. <br/>
<br/>
The kids played until they had had enough and it was a nice change.  <br/>
I always felt I was an easy going mom but I realize now how many <br/>
little things I felt the need to control.  Certainly, I was not <br/>
going to expose him to &quot;junk&quot; like the above.  Now I figure, if he <br/>
is interested in me reading it to him than what the heck.  Who am I <br/>
to tell him he can&#39;t be interested in something or I always know <br/>
best.  <br/>
<br/>
All these little changes are really from this list and listening to <br/>
all the discussions and trusting, especially trusting my children <br/>
who are pretty cool and fun kids!<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, it is so good to start getting back to normal around here!!!<br/>
<br/>

This is cool Olga!  I have realized this in myself too. I feel a bit dumb<br/>
when I think of all prejudices I have had towards certain books and the<br/>
TV..... It&#39;s so good to be free of that and all the crappy expectations of<br/>
my kids that come along with it. The kids are so happy, like I&#39;ve lifted a<br/>
huge burden off their shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to have you back!<br/>

find the value in Spiderman, Superman, etc.  This is my son&#39;s current &quot;thing.&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;m trying not to be judgemental, but it&#39;s a struggle.  I&#39;m not sure what it is <br/>
except that I was never interested in super heroes as a child.  Also, I have <br/>
trouble with violence in general.  Hulk, for instance, gets his powers from <br/>
getting angry, right?  Nathan has done a lot with this phase, including drawing <br/>
Zuperman, cutting him out and putting a big Z on his chest (actually a <br/>
backwards S).  He also makes spiderman masks, hulk hands, etc and engages in a lot of <br/>
imaginative play with his guys.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s clearly something I need to get over.  I&#39;m trying to think positively <br/>
and at least acknowledge that it&#39;s a good think I know it&#39;s my issue, not his!<br/>

Or into!<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to feel powerful.  Imagination makes it good, and they get to go <br/>
through their biochemical paces (internally, in their minds, in dreams and play) <br/>
and that all creates neural pathways and new perspectives on the world.<br/>
<br/>
Any stories are telling things that are inside people&#39;s minds.  Jung wrote <br/>
about &quot;The Collective Unconscious,&quot; about how the kinds of characters that <br/>
appear in stories all over the world, new stories and old, are based on the same <br/>
set of characters people seem to already have in their heads.  Stories of being <br/>
orphaned and of wicked stepmothers and being lost in the woods (or in fantasy <br/>
lands, or foreign planets) are common and useful, to kids AND adults.  Stories <br/>
of being all alone in a dangerous situation (flood, blizzard, war) are <br/>
instructive and stretch kids&#39; thinking.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What if&quot; they would powerful enough to stop any bad guy?<br/>
WHAT IF they could see through walls?<br/>
What if they could fly?<br/>
What if when someone else was afraid or crying, they could make it all better?<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t say anything nice, don&#39;t say anything at all!  (About The Hulk, <br/>
or Spiderman &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

If you just read through these book descriptions, you might feel better.  <br/>
It&#39;s not all about &quot;fairy tales,&quot; because there are ways in which Spiderman is a <br/>
fairy tale (though composed and not traditional).<br/>

I get power from anger.  I can feel the adrenaline pumping in my<br/>
body....the blood flowing.  I remember discovering that I could harness<br/>
that power to meet some productive goals.....I can really clean and<br/>
scrub my anger out.  I can get some exercise kicking a ball.  I suppose<br/>
it&#39;s some kid of internal exercise to find a way to scream out some of<br/>
the anger without frightening anyone.  I think The Hulk could be useful<br/>
fodder for learning how to manage the anger in the body.  Anger is an<br/>
important feeling...but it&#39;s simply a feeling.  How we manage it can<br/>
make or break relationships.<br/>

and baking soda as part of a Spirited Child exercise to my then three year old <br/>

<h4>Amy and Cory Nelson</h4>
<time>11 Sep 2003, at  5:18pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655814937">Hi Elizabeth!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking on and off on this list for a couple years now, so I&#39;ll<br/>
offer a quick intro before I respond to your post. I&#39;m Amy, 26, mom to 4 yo<br/>
Accalia and 1 yo Cole. We live in South Dakota.<br/>
<br/>
Accalia is taking after her dad in his love for comics and superheroes. Cory<br/>
has been collecting comics since he was 14, and we have boxes and boxes<br/>
lining our upstairs landing :) Spiderman and the X-Men are Accalia&#39;s<br/>
favorites.<br/>
<br/>
Cory is a therapist and is currently working at a prison. He also works with<br/>
children and families as a home-based therapist to bring in extra money.<br/>
Next April he&#39;s presenting a program at the national convention for the<br/>
American Counseling Association (ACA) on his superhero therapy that he uses<br/>
with some children. His program is titled &quot;Heroes and Villains: Comic Books<br/>
as Bibliotherapy.&quot; He&#39;s presented this before at conferences, and the gist<br/>
of it is that Cory takes the attributes that certain comic book characters<br/>
have and uses that as a jumping off point with kids to discuss what choices<br/>
they can make when confronted with certain situations - usually involving<br/>
anger. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to ask Cory for specific examples since I&#39;m fairly clueless when<br/>
it comes to comic book characters and their various powers, but I just<br/>
wanted to chime in and tell you how one person has used their love of comic<br/>
books and superheroes in their life and subsequent career :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52306904">Sorry to hear you had an argument with your friend :(<br/>
<br/>
Accalia and I once figured out a super hero persona for her - Thunder Girl.<br/>
Accalia is a typically exuberant and energetic 4 yo and often talks in a<br/>
really loud voice when she&#39;s really excited about stuff. One afternoon I was<br/>
just desperate for a little peace and quiet. Lately Accalia had been<br/>
watching an old X-Men video of Cory&#39;s and had been asking what her mutant<br/>
power was :) So, when I was getting close to wanting to run away for some<br/>
quiet, I asked if she&#39;d like to pick out a super hero to be, and we came up<br/>
with Thunder Girl. Thunder Girl&#39;s power is her *very* loud voice which she<br/>
uses in order to warn people of iminent danger. She can also use the force<br/>
of the sound waves to break apart boulders blocking roads, etc. Accalia<br/>
thought it was fun for a while, but unfortunately Thunder Girl really didn&#39;t<br/>
catch on when it came to reining in her powerful voice very often :)<br/>
