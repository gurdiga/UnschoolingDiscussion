      Thanks for your letter! I am 41 and though I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too <br/>
old, I sure do like to hear of  healthy babies being born to women in their <br/>
40&#39;s!  And I really love the stories about those  &quot;suprise babies&quot; born  <br/>
after years of infertility!    jackie</div>

      MY eyes teared up at your story!  What a beautiful and truly miraculous <br/>
story.  One thing I have definitely learned from my infertility, and I can <br/>
tell you have too; is to have complete faith in God.. I n fact, I believe one <br/>
of the reasons for my infertility was that God was calling me and this was <br/>
the way I would listen.  I truly believe that there is another child coming <br/>
into our lives.  And I also believe that even if we adopt her, she was still <br/>
always meant to be our child.  Your story proves what I have always believed <br/>
- you must know that your son was definitely meant to be yours!  I will never <br/>
forget your story and I appreciate you for sharing.   jackie</div>
