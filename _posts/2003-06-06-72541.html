 </span></blockquote>I am not sure it fits strictly into unschooling but maybe a blur of the line <br/>
and it falls into respectful parenting.  <br/>
<br/>
I try not to make a commitment that will affect the boys unless I talk with <br/>
them first.  If it is something we &quot;have&quot; to do, can&#39;t get out of, and they <br/>
really don&#39;t want to do it we try to compromise, maybe we can go and stay for a <br/>
short time, or dad can go and I will stay home or we can go and then do <br/>
something that they do want to do after. <br/>
<br/>
As for the cleaning, whoever feels that any place is dirty beyond their <br/>
comfort level cleans.  Usually I will be the first as I am usually the first one <br/>
uncomfortable.  But if the boys see me cleaning the living room they may join in <br/>
and help.  I try not to disturb things they are working on etc.  Sometimes I <br/>
will hear Dallen say &quot;I can&#39;t find a place to set up my LEGOs&quot; and he will <br/>
start cleaning, I will join in and help until it is clean enough for him.  I do <br/>
pick up here and there so it isn&#39;t a total disaster and the boys are pretty <br/>
good about picking things up when they are done, may be a week or two before they <br/>
are done but they don&#39;t want them lost or broken.  I feel if I want the house <br/>
a certain way it is my decision to keep it that way or reevaluate my <br/>
expectations.  And I have reevaluated many times.  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I think we have discussed this before so you could try to find the old <br/>
discussions.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Question.  What is the &quot;unchooling&quot; thinking on family responsibilities in<br/>
regards to the children?  Things such as:  cleaning up one&#39;s messes...<br/>
helping<br/>
clean out the garage... mom makes a committment that affects the children<br/>
(because mom is with kids 24/7)... things like that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I personally feel like unschooling works better in a family when one looks<br/>
at the philosophy of child led decisions also working in the dynamics of the<br/>
house too.<br/>
<br/>
I am a clean and neat nut. I&#39;m married to someone who likes clean but<br/>
doesn&#39;t at all see mess, clutter, piles and what have you. He&#39;ll actually<br/>
step over stuff instead of picking it up. I knew that when I married him and<br/>
he knew I was a nut about organization but still married me anyway too. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t hassle me about being anal and I don&#39;t hassle him about his clutter<br/>
of &quot;stuff.&quot; He has places where he can do as he pleases and I do too. Out of<br/>
respect to me in how I feel, he tries (he really does!) to organize things<br/>
in the family living space. Aside from that, I do it all. He has his things<br/>
to do around here and at the office all day and I have my things that I do<br/>
best. I don&#39;t nag at him to make things neat when he could care less. Why<br/>
should I?? So take everything I said and just apply kids to it too. I didn&#39;t<br/>
have them to be little maids and I knew darn well that kids make clutter.<br/>
It, for the most part, isn&#39;t important to them so why should I try and<br/>
&quot;make&quot; it be important?<br/>
<br/>
There are certain parts of the house that I ask to be kept a certain way.<br/>
That&#39;s for me. The kids don&#39;t play in the living room. When they do, they<br/>
know to take everything back out with them and put it away. Usually the only<br/>
things that end up in there are hula hoops, jump ropes, balls, etc. Once in<br/>
awhile they are left there and I just put them away. Most of the time, the<br/>
kids do it. The playroom is theirs and so are their bedrooms. When someone<br/>
is coming over to play with them for the day, they try and neaten (is that a<br/>
word?) things up a bit. Sometimes when their rooms get overwhelming, I&#39;ll go<br/>
and clean up or ask them if they want help or just want to do it themselves.<br/>
The dining room table of lately looks like it&#39;s going to walk away. Unless<br/>
I&#39;m having company for dinner, I let that go. If I want to sit at a table, I<br/>
can do that in the kitchen. Joseph is our big artist and really needs his<br/>
space. Most times his computer desk is way too small for his projects.<br/>
<br/>
Once in awhile the floor of the playroom is scattered with small things that<br/>
I can&#39;t vacuum around or push. I&#39;ll ask for some help in cleaning it up, and<br/>
9 chances out of 10, I get that help.<br/>
<br/>
All 4 kids were parented the same way with this and my 17 year old is very<br/>
considerate and also very neat and clean herself. The 7 and 8 year olds have<br/>
their moments and the 2 year old is a walking tornado!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I ask them not to do, and see to it is that they don&#39;t eat in<br/>
their bedrooms. Takes only one crumb to bring ants. The playroom has the<br/>
games and TV and they can eat in there with no problem.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t have chores or help with anything that is done around the<br/>
house like cleaning the yard and things unless they ask to help. They put<br/>
their dirty clothes in a basket and when laundry is done, I will ask them to<br/>
put away their folded clothes. They hang up towels after their showers and<br/>
that&#39;s about the only things I ask for. I know this was very long but I hope<br/>
it helps you somewhat understand what we do here. As far as commitments that<br/>
affect the children I&#39;m not sure what you mean?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126345740">*Most* of the time, I let it go and ask for help as needed with the understanding that the kids can and do say no sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Other times, when the house is positively overwhelming or there have been LONG periods of time where my kids have done absolutely NOTHING to help anyone out (like a few  months), I will ask that they help me with the expectation that they *do*.<br/>
<br/>
Usually those times are when *I* had nothing to do with the mess:  people made food and left it out everywhere (and we already have a long standing ant problem here).  People left dishes all over the house.  Many many times, I clean it up and let them know I cleaned it up, and remind them to please put stuff away.<br/>
<br/>
But after months of that, there are just days where I&#39;m *sick* of having to be the one to clean it up.  I have other things I want to do, and I cannot leave stuff just lay around because of the ants.  When it gets to that point, I ask them each to pick two chores to do.<br/>
<br/>
Then they go off and do them.  I&#39;m trying to remember if they&#39;ve ever said &quot;no&quot; on a day like that.  I don&#39;t think they have.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, this is so ironic! I have followed a bit of flylady advice about <br/>
not being a martyr when it comes to housecleaning. Sort not expecting <br/>
much from the family, and doing things for them joyfully brings you <br/>
joy, and sometimes gets them to pitch in without asking. <br/>
<br/>
My dh and oldest aren&#39;t very good about picking up after themselves. <br/>
My 3-going-on-4-year-old is more &quot;born organized&quot;, likes to clean up <br/>
and arrange things, and does things because they need doing, and <br/>
graciously helps when asked. Where does she get that from? <br/>
<br/>
The irony is I have become basically immobile with this bad ankle. <br/>
And the house is falling apart. I *wish* I could get up and take over <br/>
and not have to ask for help at all. I got injured after falling on <br/>
water I spilled from shampooing the carpet. The house was in good <br/>
shape, I was doing the extra stuff, getting ready for a birthday <br/>
party this weekend. <br/>
<br/>
I did something really stupid the other night. Everyone was <br/>
downstairs playing and watching tv, and trash and dishes and clothes <br/>
were everywhere. So i got up mad and put the knee of the bad ankle on <br/>
the seat of my computer chair, and scooted all over picking stuff up <br/>
and cleaning. I was so mad that no one was taking initiative when mom <br/>
was down. I was mad that I even had to ask, so I didn&#39;t. Dh came up <br/>
and got mad at me for not asking. They are the types to just step <br/>
over something and not pick it up. Passive aggressive crap gets on my <br/>
nerves. <br/>
