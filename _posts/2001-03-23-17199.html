<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147663250">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the sort version.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Debbie. My DH and I brought our son and daughter home from <br/>
PS 11 years ago to be with their sister and brother.  Our oldest son <br/>
now 22 is living on his our (well sorta, he lives with his good <br/>
friend and their cat.)  At home we have our daughters 20 and 15 and <br/>
our son 13.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of differences in styles of unschooling and we have <br/>
bee bopped back and forth through the years, depending mostly on our <br/>
problems with deschooling ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are things I wish I&#39;d done differently, but all and all it has <br/>
been a wonderful journey so far.<br/>

Hi Debbie &lt;&lt;waving&gt;&gt; its Kathy here!  It looks like your little talk last<br/>
night motivated you to rejoin the list?  For those on the list Debbie <br/>
participated on a unschooling panel last night for our local homeschoolers<br/>
night at Barnes & Noble.   Good to see you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716558513">Geez!  Where did Friday and Sat. go!  It&#39;s Sun. in 15 min; I think <br/>
the term SAHM is a joke &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Hey Kathy &lt;&lt;waving back&gt;&gt;, you&#39;re right doing the panel thing <br/>
on Thurs. got me out of the &quot;no mail/web only&quot; sneak in and read a <br/>
bit mode.<br/>
<br/>
As for college our oldest son got as far as getting the registration <br/>
form for the Community College and changed his mind.  Our oldest <br/>
daughter has taken classes at a School of Photography (she started <br/>
just before she turn 16) and took a course at So. Cal School of <br/>
Massage.  She plans to take more classes in massage and starting a <br/>
photography business.  Our 15 yo old daughter may want to take some <br/>
classes in Drama, Japanese or sign language at the local Community <br/>
College soon.  Our youngest son has talked about Culinary School.  <br/>
College is not a high priority to me.  I have kept them out of <br/>
institutionalized education for a reason, but if it necessary for <br/>
what they want to do, then so be it.<br/>
<br/>
What would I do different?  I&#39;d like to think I&#39;d never had put them <br/>
in school had I know about HSing.  I would not have caved under in-<br/>
law pressure and put the younger 2 into pre-school 2 days a week once <br/>
I did know about HSing.  In the beginning I gave them &quot;points&quot; for <br/>
every 15 min. of &quot;educational&quot; things they did.  They where to do 3 <br/>
hrs a day total of whatever subjects they chose to do, and I kept a <br/>
chart. What was I thinking!!  I also would have not been so <br/>
determined to get them all out &quot;in the real world&quot; in organized <br/>
sports and Scouting.  I didn&#39;t know of any like minded HSing support <br/>
groups at first and was so busy with other things I didn&#39;t pursue <br/>
them once I did find a couple.  I had on-line support for myself, but <br/>
not anything as a family until 5 years ago when we moved and I made <br/>
some lifestyle changes.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, it&#39;s 15 min. into Sun. I&#39;d best get to bed.  I&#39;ll only be the 2nd <br/>
to hit the hay for the night, who knows when to 2 youngest will go to <br/>
bed and/or couch &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;<br/>
Debbie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-59579792">thank you for coming out of lurking mode. I have teenagers new to<br/>
unschooling and any imput you have would be valuable. I have a hard time<br/>
letting go sometimes. Are any og your children planning on college? Do you<br/>
feel pressure to keep &quot;academic records&quot;? What state are you in, or are you<br/>
are in US at all?<br/>
Johanna<br/>
<br/>
Johanna,<br/>
      I&#39;m in Alabama and I have a teen who is working her way toward<br/>
college.  I have been doing this for so long that no, I don&#39;t feel pressured<br/>
to keep records, but I also am able to translate what we do into a<br/>
transcript for her fairly easily.<br/>
<br/>
      So much of what mom needs to do depends on where your children are<br/>
emotionally, academically and what their interests are.<br/>
<br/>
     Which part do you find the hardest to let go of?<br/>
