<div id="ygrps-yiv-314367601">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Ms T, (Teresa) and I found your group while looking for homeschooling groups on the net. I am also known as Xena in a few groups.  <br/>
<br/>
Where do I begin?  I am in my forties, and I have four daughters, only one who is not grown and out on her own.  My youngest daughter is six, almost seven years old.  Her father (step-father, actually, but only father she has every known, as her bio-dad ran off before she was born)  and I have decided not to send her to public school, for various reasons.  He is Australian, I am American, and we travel alot.  We value our freedom to move around as we please, although, at the moment, due to my husband&#39;s work commitments (software engineer/senior systems analyst), we are in a &quot;stand still&quot; position for the present.  Our daughter is a &quot;people person&quot;, very sociable, as am I, while her father is more introverted, very much a loner type.  They clash alot in this area, and I sometimes wonder if we&#39;re doing the right thing in regard to schooling, as our daughter is very very lonely.  She craves to have friends, and we are not in a living area where it is possible to make lasting friendships without going to school, if this makes sense.  The rest of the family lives three hours&#39; drive away, so we see them about once a month. <br/>
<br/>
Do you have any ideas for giving her social experiences while still continuing to educate at home?  I am learning alot from your group.  You have many diverse opinions here, eye-opening concepts, open intelligent discussions, which makes this a VERY interesting support group.  I&#39;m open-minded to learning other ways of dealing with education rather than the mainstream way.  My life concepts and the public education concept have clashed many times, although I must admit, I am sometimes a bit cowardly at &quot;going against the grain&quot;.   I&#39;m trying, but it seems NOTHING is ever easy, least of all rearing lively, sociable, high-strung children with a father who is ultra quiet and introverted!   <br/>
<br/>
I have lurked here long enough to realize there are many GOOD, well-thought diversities of opinion here, and I admire the spunk of so many of you for taking a divergent path from the usual/average way most of the masses allow themselves to be carried along.  Thanks in advance for your input!  <br/>
<br/>
Ms T<br/>

community sports, library groups.<br/>
<br/>
Ask the librarian if she has any information about homeschooling groups. Or<br/>
check <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a> for local groups. (Even if they&#39;re quite a ride<br/>
away it might be worth it once a week.)<br/>
<br/>
You could also start some kind of group based around an interest of hers.<br/>
Depending on the interest, you might get moms involved too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe give a class of your own, say like an art/social group.<br/>
