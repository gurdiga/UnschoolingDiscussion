<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220726303">This would be so lovely!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter cannot read a book withough stopping all along the way to discuss <br/>
and meander and wander and wonder (I wonder why they did that and not this? <br/>
.. . )<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know -- it sounds charming and entertaining and like she&#39;s thinking <br/>
about what she&#39;s reading, etc. <br/>
<br/>
But -- it is sooooo different from how I would read a book and soooo tiring <br/>
-- the tangents and things that come up -- there are many books that are <br/>
never finished because the reader wanders off to do some &quot;project&quot; based on <br/>
something that was mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I know -- the grass is always greener!  I know -- it&#39;s great and all that.  <br/>
But it drives me nuts!<br/>
<br/>
Well, some day she won&#39;t even want me to read with her and I&#39;ll miss it!  :)<br/>
