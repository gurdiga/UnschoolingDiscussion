<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522142359">We&#39;ve had a few discussions in the past about good &quot;unschooling&quot; movies, this <br/>
maybe have been discussed already...but we saw one that I considered sooooo <br/>
good, and a TRUE STORY.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;Rabbit Proof Fence.&quot;  It&#39;s about some half white, half Aborigine <br/>
girls in Australia.  The law there, at one time (actually for a LONG time) <br/>
was that if a child was biracial, they were taken from their families/tribe and <br/>
placed in &quot;orphanages&quot; to teach them reading, writing, civilized living (for <br/>
lack of a better term.)  It was so wierd, they had a theory that if they made <br/>
these kids act &quot;white&quot; they&#39;d marry and &quot;breed&quot; with white people, and <br/>
eventually the Aborigine would be bred out of them.  It was a very cool story, <br/>
especially for young women...warning though, it is kinda sad at times.  Just wanted <br/>
to pass that along.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our family LOVED this movie! (and we don&#39;t love many). Three girls escape<br/>
from the school that is there to destroy their culture and actually walk<br/>
home 1200 miles through heat and desert, keeping themselves alive and<br/>
hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
One note: the scene where the children are actually physically wrenched away<br/>
from their mothers and driven away is very upsetting. Both my 6.5 yo and I<br/>
found it very sad and hard to watch.<br/>
<br/>
If you can get the DVD, there&#39;s an interesting documentary included about<br/>
how the young actresses learned their parts--three Aboriginal girls from the<br/>
far outback who&#39;d never acted before.<br/>

I rented that a couple of weeks ago,  thought my kids would like it,  thought I would like it.  Oh boy, was it sad.  It is a good movie, amazing story, but I sat there with tears running down my eyes alot of the time.  My ds said, &quot;no thanks&quot; when he heard what it was about, he can&#39;t handle intense stories.  My dd, watched some but after a while decided to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
I had such a hard time with the attitude of the Kenneth Branagh character.  Well, with all the white&#39;s attitudes, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I live near a reservation in Minnesota and see such racism towards our natives.  Makes me really sad.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand,  the bravery that those girls showed, wow.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-955243851">I spent a summer at Red Lake, doing an internship at the long term care facility there.  It was sad to see the attitude that so many of the non-native employees had about the Chippewa there.<br/>
<br/>
I got to live in an apartment on the reservation.  It was really a great summer.<br/>

  Yep,  that&#39;s just a 1/2 hr north of us. <br/>
<br/>
  We are also just an hour away from White Earth Reservation.  Where Winona Laduke is from.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   **It was sad to see the attitude that so many of the non-native employees had about the Chippewa there.**<br/>
  There have been times where I&#39;ve had to stop and say, &quot;Excuse me&quot; when people have made certain comments.    I can&#39;t believe my ears sometimes.<br/>
  There is so much cool culture that people could be learning about and sharing in.  But there is also so much closed mindedness and stubborness.<br/>
<br/>
  I see some communication being openned up, but then there will be a setback on something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188280081">Peeking out of lurkdom.  Between traveling and kids, more kids and <br/>
still more kids &lt;g&gt;, and life in general, I rarely get a chance to do <br/>
more than scroll through until I see a subject line that interests me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Movie&quot; in the subject line caught my interest because we are always <br/>
on the lookout for videos to take with us when we are traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, I&#39;m rambling, so I&#39;ll get to the point.  This movie could as <br/>
easily have taken place in the United States as that was the policy <br/>
of the U.S. government and its boarding schools for full-blood <br/>
Indians and with the hope that when they became &quot;white&quot; they <br/>
would &quot;breed with whites&quot; to &quot;dilute the blood to the degree they no <br/>
longer qualify under blood quantum rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago we visited a few of the boarding schools here <br/>
and in Canada and then spent quite a bit of time investigating the <br/>
whys, wheres and howcomes of various genocide policies in the U.S. <br/>
and Canada.  Sad, very sad.<br/>
