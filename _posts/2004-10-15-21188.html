<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850117923">My previously unschooled daughter chose to attend grade nine this year. She<br/>
just got back her &quot;mid-mid-terms&quot; and has gotten 3 A&#39;s and one B. We always<br/>
have had access to learning material. I also have 2 foster daughters. One in<br/>
grade 2 and one in grade 6.  Makes me so thankfully I am home-schooling the<br/>
other kids.<br/>
<br/>
So essentially Amanda is good at writing tests!! But she also is doing well<br/>
on her assignments & understanding the material. She did fail one test which<br/>
required pure memorization of dates & facts. Basically music history. She<br/>
said it was stupid & she&#39;d never use it & that most of the class failed too.<br/>
She says she wants to be............a TEACHER!!! Yikes!! So she will need<br/>
grades in the 90&#39;s here in Canada to get into University for Teaching. So if<br/>
that is what she really wants to do she is going to need to teach herself (I<br/>
am showing her &quot;tricks&quot;) how to memorize just so she can get the marks for<br/>
the tests to do what she thinks she wants to do as a &quot;grown-up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It certainly has helped in my DH realizing that the kids don&#39;t need an 6.5<br/>
hour school day to become &quot;learners&quot;...only took 14 years for him to get<br/>
this!!<br/>
