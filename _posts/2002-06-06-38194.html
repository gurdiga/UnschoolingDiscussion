&lt;&lt; Grandpa did offer to pay for our room when we told him we could not <br/>
 afford one. Am I being a real pain in the butt?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think you are at all.<br/>
He offered. If it means that much for you to be there and you can&#39;t afford <br/>
it, then I think it&#39;s good and proper that he offered. You may not be able to <br/>
go otherwise.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t handle family pushing my kids off for an adult party either.<br/>
I&#39;ve had adult dinners out with family, where we got a babysitter that the <br/>
kids liked and movies for them to watch, but to send them off in such an <br/>
obvious way would not sit well with me either.<br/>
I personally wouldn&#39;t attend the party.<br/>
If he makes such a big deal out of everyone being there and then deliberately <br/>
separates the kids, that is very disrespectful of them.<br/>
I would do as you already wrote.....find something fun to do with the kids <br/>
while everyone else parties away.<br/>

He&#39;s 80! <br/>
People that old are not going to change, and shouldn&#39;t need to.  They can <br/>
just get blissfully old and die (or whatever). <br/>
<br/>
We shouldn&#39;t try to change people who are twice our age (three times, for <br/>
some of you).  We can avoid them, but avoiding a once-in-a-lifetime birthday <br/>
seems more cold than productive, and that might not be a good example for the <br/>
kids either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366799383">I would go and enjoy myself and I would take the kids because they would<br/>
get a real hoot out of staying in a hotel.  Lanora is old enough now to<br/>
see how some people are clueless about how great kids are.  I would<br/>
explain the situation to her and she would probably want to go anyway<br/>
because she thinks hotels are cool.  In fact, she would probably be<br/>
relieved to be excused from the party.  Jonathan (4) wouldn&#39;t care one<br/>
way or the other so I would just make sure he was free to have fun with<br/>
someone there to care for him.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with your convictions but as long as your honest with the kids<br/>
why not just get all the fun out of it that you can for all of you?  Your<br/>
grandfather isn&#39;t going to change or understand your objection.  I&#39;m<br/>
afraid that instead of a happy memory for all you&#39;ll end up with hurt<br/>
family members.  Perhaps it would be beneficial to show your kids that<br/>
sometimes people are more important than convictions, not always but<br/>
sometimes.  Maybe they will learn how to live a flexible life and retain<br/>
their teachability even when they&#39;re 80.<br/>

They shouldn&#39;t try to change us either!<br/>
I won&#39;t make my kids miserable for one night, regardless of the circumstances.<br/>
So if my kids understood and were fine with it, then I&#39;d go. If not, I&#39;d stay <br/>
with them and let dh go.<br/>

Right.  On MY birthday I get to call the music and the refreshments.  <br/>
<br/>
Not too long after people&#39;s 80th birthday parties, they die, but those little <br/>
kids will likely live another 70 years.<br/>
