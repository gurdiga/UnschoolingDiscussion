 </span></blockquote>I think there have been studies that show it does work, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
anything works for everyone, or all the time.  Some of the things that have<br/>
helped me with PMS (thankfully almost a memory) are evening primrose oil,<br/>
chasteberry, and, and, at least one other that I&#39;m not remembering.  None of<br/>
them continued to work for long, so I had to keep changing.  Now I use<br/>
natural progesterone cream for that and some other stuff like sore breasts.<br/>
Apparently it also encourages bone density growth, naturally a concern of<br/>
mine at this point.<br/>
