<div id="ygrps-yiv-118104875">This will probably make the US papers too, but just in case....According to <br/>
tomorrow&#39;s edition of &quot;The Times,&quot; ........<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>J.K. ROWLING is to write two short spin-off books from her Harry Potter <br/>
series in aid of the charity Comic Relief. She also intends to do the <br/>
illustrations herself. <br/>
Bloomsbury will publish Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch <br/>
through the Ages early next year, in time for Comic Reliefâ€™s Red Nose Day on <br/>
March 16.   &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The full article is on the newspaper&#39;s web site at the moment. If you look at <br/>
it after tomorrow, you&#39;ll probably have to do the free  registration thing....<br/>
