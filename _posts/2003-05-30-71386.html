 </span></blockquote>This is so true.  I remember when JP was born, Landon was  8.5, he became the <br/>
oldest of 4 children.  He seemed so &quot;old&quot;, so &quot;big&quot;, he was so capable and <br/>
independent.   It was like he was now the REALLY big brother.   Like he was half <br/>
grown or something.. lol.   That was my initial feelings right after JP was <br/>
born and the first few days after we brought him home.  Then, one night, Landon <br/>
came into our bedroom as I was feeding JP ( probably  more like early <br/>
morning)  He just woke up from a dream or something and came in for some comfort and <br/>
reassurance.   And it hit me like a faceful of cold water.  <br/>
<br/>
 HE IS ONLY 8 YEARS OLD!   He is ONLY 8 years old.   The stone cold reality <br/>
of his actual age.  8 years!  8 short years.  He was still just a &quot;baby&quot; <br/>
himself in many ways.   That one moment of realization made all the difference in my <br/>
perception of Landon as &quot;old enough&quot; to withstand this or that. Or to do <br/>
without &quot;this or that&quot;  Yes, compared to a newborn, even compared to Ethan at 3 <br/>
and Anna at 5, he WAS older, more mature and capable.. BUT, he was still just 8 <br/>
years old.  I thought of it in terms of what if he was an only child at 8?  8 <br/>
is 8 whether you are the only child or the oldest of a whole brood.  ( or the <br/>
oldest of 2 children). <br/>
<br/>
  In this epiphany, I also realized where a lot of my husband&#39;s relationship <br/>
with his family came from.  He was the oldest of 5 children.  The youngest <br/>
being born when he was 14.  He was the chief cook and bottle washer probably <br/>
since he was about 8 ( when baby # 4 was born).  His parents relied heavily on him <br/>
to be the big helper, the leader, the one they could count on..  Not all <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; stuff, but just a lot of responsibility for an 8 year old.  They seemed to <br/>
do exactly what Sandra said earlier.  In essence, they &quot;gave thier oldest child <br/>
away&quot;   They took away his childhood, his dependency on them.  They promoted <br/>
him up to thier right hand man and expected him to just grow up and not need <br/>
them anymore. <br/>
<br/>
  They still have that attitude now with us as his family.  His siblings and <br/>
thier families are always being &quot;loaned&quot; money, help with thier kids ( <br/>
babysitting, paying for lessons, buying clothes, etc)  Our family probably struggles <br/>
more than any of the others( financially), but thier attitude is.. OH, Gralyn <br/>
will be fine, he&#39;s tough, he does not need our help.  Afterall, he is the <br/>
oldest, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Any age is just an age, no matter what birth order postion a kid ends up in.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wish other people would realise this too. My youngest has/had a bit of a foul mouth when 6 and still now when 7 and because of his temper two people stopped being my friends - by email too, how<br/>
thoughtful - It just stunned me that they would do this over what a small child said, cut off what I thought were good friendships.<br/>
<br/>
Now I feel nervous whenever the youngest opens his mouth around my American friends. It&#39;s not an issue back home, people would just ignore it and not take it persoannly. After all, he&#39;s only 7 and 7 is<br/>
very little.<br/>
