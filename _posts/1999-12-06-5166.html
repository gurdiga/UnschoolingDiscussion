&lt;&lt;The difference is that Clonlara doesn&#39;t use scare tactics to get<br/>
people to join, doesn&#39;t involve itself in non-homeschooling political<br/>
agendas with members money and unknown to them, doesn&#39;t come into states<br/>
without the knowledge or request of the major state groups and start<br/>
creating state laws where none were needed or wanted, doesn&#39;t further<br/>
create such state laws to benefit themselves (i.e, you must belong to<br/>
one of thse homeschool groups in order to homeschool legally, and oh<br/>
yes, to belong to one of those groups you must first be a member of<br/>
H$LDA). <br/>
It&#39;s the difference between a assistance and an ax. <br/>

Subject: Clonlara <br/>
I&#39;ve heard mixed reviews on Clonlara. Some people think it&#39;s the best<br/>
thing they ever found. Others feel like they charge an awful lot (about<br/>
$550 per year) for what they do. I think it depends on whether you feel<br/>
like you need this kind of cover. It actually is a school - not a legal<br/>
defense association like H$LDA. Clonlara states that they will help you<br/>
by testifying in court if you need them too, but they don&#39;t offer<br/>
lawyers, etc. That said, I would much prefer my money go to an org. like<br/>
Clonlara than H$LDA, but I&#39;d rather not spend the money on either. <br/>
