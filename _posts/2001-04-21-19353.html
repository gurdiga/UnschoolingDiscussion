<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612950882"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It is too quiet out there. Are any of you virus free?<br/>
&gt;Johanna <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was worried because I had tried to open the email<br/>
attachments.  We also just recently reformatted our<br/>
computer, thanks to a dear friend who is an &quot;official&quot;<br/>
type computer expert.  We had not yet reloaded our<br/>
Norton Systemworks on the computer after the reformat.<br/>
 However, I do not seem to be getting any return<br/>
emails from myself, or any more from anyone else<br/>
besides the first three.  I also have not heard anyone<br/>
say that they are getting any from me.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if it is my ISP that screens it for me,<br/>
or yahoo (my mail server) or something else our friend<br/>
might have put on our computer, but I appear to be<br/>
virus free.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to comment on how interested I was in<br/>
following the whole SCA thread.  We just recently got<br/>
involved with communicating with the SCA folks in the<br/>
Seattle/Federal Way area, as we are moving there in a<br/>
few months.  I am working on the whole business of<br/>
trying to create fun personas for hubby and me that<br/>
refelct our tastes and interests.  We are planning on<br/>
doing some events and some camping this summer/fall.  <br/>
<br/>
The SCA is also holding their &quot;Arts and Sciences<br/>
(Symposium or Conference, can&#39;t remember which it is<br/>
called) of the Known Worlde&quot; in Seattle this October,<br/>
and there will be lots of opportunities to learn and<br/>
gain new/old skills from the talented people<br/>
presenting.  I have already got my hands on the lesson<br/>
plan from a lady who will be presenting a class on<br/>
historical midwifing practices, since the persona I am<br/>
working on is sort of a hedge witch/herbalist/midwife<br/>
kind of thing.  Like Strega Nona, only not so old! <br/>
LOL  I also got some book recommendations for her, for<br/>
research.<br/>
<br/>
So that is what we are working on right now, besides<br/>
packing, selling our house, finding work, etc.  %-/<br/>
How about you?<br/>
