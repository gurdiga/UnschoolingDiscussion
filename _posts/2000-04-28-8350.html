&lt;&lt; What magazines for kids do you like? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We like Spider for the younger one and Zillions for the older.  Zillions is <br/>
Consumer Reports&#39; magazine for kids and it really makes him think.  We don&#39;t <br/>
use many of the products they review, but the whole idea makes him aware of <br/>
what he calls &quot;ad tricks&quot;.  He sent in an essay to try to get picked for next <br/>
year&#39;s Z-Team (toy/game testers).  We&#39;ve got our fingers crossed!<br/>
