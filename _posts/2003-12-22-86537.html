<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684871589">Hi everyone!  <br/>
My 3 1/2 year old loves being read to and is starting to have a much longer <br/>
attention span.  He&#39;s been picking huge stacks of books for me to read to him <br/>
at bed time or when his baby sister is napping and I have lots of time.  <br/>
I am wondering when people started reading chapter books outloud to their <br/>
children and some good ones to try starting with.  I am thinking maybe <br/>
Charlotte&#39;s Web.  Any suggestions?  <br/>
 I have been reading longer picture books to him recently and he&#39;s also been <br/>
picking out science books at the library like volcanos and tornado info books. <br/>
 <br/>
The only thing I am worried about is that he will want me to read the whole <br/>
thing not just a chapter or two at a time.  He likes to finish things once they <br/>
are started.  <br/>
Thanks,  <br/>
Amanda<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I started reading chapter books to my son sometime when he was 4... <br/>
I remember he really enjoyed Dr. Dolittle, (we started but didn&#39;t <br/>
finish Charlotte&#39;s Web), The Littles, The Boxcar Children (they have <br/>
younger versions of this to start with, and then some of the same <br/>
stories in chapter versions for a little older children), and... <br/>
others. I&#39;m blanking. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I observed with my own son is that about a year after we <br/>
read certain books, (or explored certain topics) he really had no <br/>
recollection of them anymore. That&#39;s okay with me, as we can always <br/>
enjoy them over and over!! <br/>
<br/>
HTH!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-208649986">If he&#39;s interested, I would go for it. Read as long as he wants you to and <br/>
your voice holds out. The book will be there tomorrow or even next week. <br/>
Right now, we&#39;re (6 dd, 5 dd and 3.5 ds) in the middle of several books. <br/>
Sometimes it bugs me that there are books we never finish, but we either <br/>
get back to them or they weren&#39;t compelling enough to finish.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest anything by Roald Dahl--Charlie and the Chocolate Factory <br/>
kept even my 3 yo&#39;s interest!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what&#39;s great about the library--you can check out stuff from a bunch <br/>
of the different series to see which strikes a chord. My oldest wasn&#39;t wild <br/>
about the Magic Tree House, but she likes Secrets of Droon and Goosebumps. <br/>
I read these to her (yes, in the hopes that she will get so involved that <br/>
it will spark her to read by herself, I admit), and she loves them. No, she <br/>
hasn&#39;t started reading them on her own, but she often asks me to read, <br/>
which is just as good! ;) Plus, then everyone gets to hear them, which <br/>
makes for much  better discussions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-978109960">One of the beauties of the Little House books is that the writing <br/>
seems to progress as time goes on so that the first book is written <br/>
on a simpler level than the last book.  It&#39;s almost like she was <br/>
writing to kids who are the age she is in the book.  At least that&#39;s <br/>
how I see them after reading them each 10+ times.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know when I started reading chapter books to my oldest but by <br/>
the time my second came along three years later we were already doing <br/>
it.  My second listened to Peter Pan while I was pregant with my <br/>
third which would have made her just 2.  I remember reading The <br/>
Wizard of Oz out loud in three days with a newborn, 4, 5 and 8 year <br/>
olds; the baby nursed and the others listened intently.<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I read to each other almost every night.  The first book we <br/>
read together was Cruel Shoes by Steve Martin when we were first <br/>
married.  Now it&#39;s just usually interesting passages.<br/>

(either written or on the screen) I forget it quickly.  I can see <br/>
movies or read books for the first time all over again.  Non-fiction <br/>
OTH sticks with me forever.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a little like that with books and movies.  I know which ones I like, but <br/>
if I try to tell someone what happened, I don&#39;t have it all in order or I <br/>
forget whole parts.  I don&#39;t know the characters&#39; names after one exposure.    <br/>
<br/>
My husband, though, DOES.  If he read a fantasy book 20 years ago or <br/>
yesterday,  he will be able to tell you who did what in what order.  So he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like to watch movies repeatedly, usually.  There are exceptions for him:  The <br/>
Seven Samurai.   And lately, Babylon 5 (he has the first three seasons on DVD).  <br/>
He watches them over.  <br/>
<br/>
He has been amused sometimes when I&#39;m just as surprised and happy as the <br/>
first time at some detail in a movie when he knows I had seen it a few years <br/>
before.  I get that &quot;Oh yeah, I remember now!&quot; response, but I never sit there <br/>
thinking I know what will happen next.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234860251">Hi Amanda! My eight-year-old loved (and still loves) the Roald Dahl books <br/>
when we first started with longer books. He liked having a picture now and <br/>
then, and some of them are short enough to read all at once. Our library <br/>
also has a section with picture books for older children. These are books <br/>
that have a longer story but still have illustrations.<br/>
<br/>
He still likes the best of the picture books meant for small children, <br/>
though, especially Max and Ruby :-)<br/>
