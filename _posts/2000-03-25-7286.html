<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771935187">Hi Karen, <br/>
Welcome to the wonderful world of unschooling! I do<br/>
some home/unschooling and employ some of Charlotte<br/>
Mason in our week. I read alot to my DD&#39;s then I ask<br/>
them to take turns telling me the story I just read.<br/>
This tell me if they comprehend what they&#39;ve read. We<br/>
will also do some dictation from a book we are<br/>
reading. I will usually only ask that they write one<br/>
paragraph. Sometimes I will let them copy from the<br/>
book instead of me dictating. We are trying to<br/>
remember to use our Nature Journals when we walk.If<br/>
your son doesn&#39;t like to draw let him find things to<br/>
paste into his journal that he finds on your walks or<br/>
maybe he could dictate to you what he saw on these<br/>
walks and you could write it for him. If you are using<br/>
a journal it may inspire him one day. Type in<br/>
Charlotte Mason in your search engine to find links.<br/>
One link has her list of &quot;twaddle-free&quot; books. Let me<br/>
know if you can not find it. Good luck and have fun!<br/>

&gt;             I am relatively new to unschooling;  I<br/>
&gt; have been reading on it as <br/>
&gt; well as homeschooling for over a year now.  Recently<br/>
&gt; I read an article <br/>
&gt; praising the Charlotte Mason method.  I am<br/>
&gt; interested in learning more about <br/>
&gt; this, and I was wondering if anyone uses her<br/>
&gt; techniques, and what your <br/>
&gt; thoughts are about it.  One thing I have heard about<br/>
&gt; is a nature journal that <br/>
&gt; the kids would draw in-- my oldest son (5 yrs)<br/>
&gt; really does not like to draw <br/>
&gt; very much, at least he does not spontaneously choose<br/>
&gt; to sit and draw very <br/>
&gt; often.  Anyway, I would be grateful for any opinions<br/>
&gt; you might have. Thanks!    <br/>
&gt;                                                     <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581653834">Start out READING! Reading &quot;Living Books&quot; are one of the biggest things that<br/>
C Mason did. I have read books on C Mason, and this summer we will be going<br/>
&quot;totally Mason&quot;. We are partially Masoneers, but still holding onto<br/>
workbooks. LOL I have a list floating around of living books, but if you dig<br/>
around, you will find a few Charlotte Mason sites online.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543006562">Thanks for the advice about C. Mason, and about drawing.  I believe that my <br/>
son will develop more interest in it as time goes by; but I&#39;m sure you are <br/>
right about exposing him to a lot of drawing to help inspire him.  I also <br/>
agree that boys are,in general, a bit later in mastering the fine motor <br/>
skills.  My son does like to take pictures, and likes to glue things, so <br/>
these areas are where we could start.  My other kids are 3 and 6 mos.; my 3yr <br/>
old will enjoy gluing in a nature book, I&#39;m sure.  I found the site on C. <br/>
Mason-- it looks like there is alot of choices and even volumes to select <br/>
from.  I will start with a C. M. Education, and take it from there.  To all <br/>
who took the time to reply, I thank you very much!  -- And if you have any <br/>
other  thoughts, please send them my way :)                                     <br/>
