&lt;&lt; Putting the toys in time out helps.  I found that allowing the number<br/>
 of toys out to become overwhelming did just that - overwhelmed all of us.<br/>
 By putting toys away at good break points every day, it more or less stays<br/>
 under control.<br/>

toys not cleaned up into a box for a specific period of time?  If so, how <br/>
long do you leave them there as a rule?  I may try this... my 3 yo is being <br/>
extremely difficult about cleaning.  ~Karen</div>

For what it&#39;s worth, my former 3 yo (who is now 12 yo) who was *terrible* at <br/>
putting things away (he would even pour *more* toys out on the floor if he <br/>
got really angry about cleaning up! &lt;g&gt;), just made a double recipe of <br/>
chocolate chip cookies, put the mixer away, boxed up all the cookies and <br/>
rinsed off the dishes.  Although it doesn&#39;t often *occur* to him to clean <br/>
things up (especially his room), he&#39;s quite helpful when asked.  So the 3 yo <br/>
stage won&#39;t last forever &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hello. I am new to this list. I have to say that I<br/>
have put toys games etc. in timeout if they won&#39;t put<br/>
it away when they are finished or if they start<br/>
fighting over the toy/game and won&#39;t resolve the<br/>
problem. Usually/always I put it up high to where they<br/>
can&#39;t get it down but where they can see it to remind<br/>
them that they can&#39;t play with it because of thier<br/>
behiavior. It usually works. Haven&#39;t had a toy in time<br/>
out for a few weeks now. Oh, I only keep it there for<br/>
and hour or so depending on how bad the situation is.<br/>
The worse the situation the longer it is in. I always<br/>
get the toy out by the next day. They are 3.5 and 5 so<br/>
anything longer than that and they forget why it is in<br/>
timeout just that they can&#39;t play with it.<br/>
