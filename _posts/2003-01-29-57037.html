I have learned how to play guitar (ok, only a couple of chords so far), how <br/>
to be a makeup artist, herbology, Medieval history, math etc.....<br/>
In fact, everything I learned that has ANY sort of meaning in my life, was <br/>
learned after age 18. Why?<br/>
Because I was finally able to learn what I wanted, not what other people <br/>
thought I should.<br/>
Everything people thought I should learn is long gone.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Shyrley, Shyrley, Shyrley! You MUST be well-rounded! How would it look <br/>
just <br/>
 to take ONLY the courses NEEDED!? ANd WHAT would that do to others&#39; GPAs??? <br/>

letting it happen naturally. <br/>
But duh, they are in business! It&#39;s not about individuals.<br/>
I will have to take the TABE examintation to get into the massage therapy <br/>
program at the college here. If I don&#39;t meet their standard, they will put me <br/>
in REMEDIAL math, English or Writing. I am going to study up on that specific <br/>
test and prepare so I can ace it and not take their stupid remedial courses. <br/>

*I was a late blooner. :-) I moved around  a lot as a kid, didn&#39;t get Maths - until age 14. Something iside me clicked and Maths looked interesting. I got  myself a tutor to review basic Maths with me, then went on to study &quot;higher maths&quot;<br/>
at school. It all just fell into place for me.  I still love Maths! So, I figure if I could learn basic  written maths in a few months with a tutor, when motivated, so could my kids, if they so choose...Leonie W. <br/>

 Nope. :) If that were true the shop teacher would&#39;ve been the first one to <br/>
 the answer, not the other student. The truth is, if your son wants to be <br/>
able <br/>
 to do math instantly, he probably needs to be reincarnated with a different <br/>
 brain. :)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or read a book about being a human calculator. There are some amazing tricks, <br/>
none of which they teach you in school, that make arithmetic in your head <br/>
really easy.<br/>
Even if you aren&#39;t wired that way, there are tricks you can learn if you <br/>
really want to.<br/>
I am math deficient...but even I can learn the tricks! So I think anyone can <br/>
if they&#39;re interested.<br/>
