I&#39;m glad I was able to see his joy in it at the time, while mortified for the <br/>
neighbor, I knew he wasn&#39;t trying to be nasty, just impulsive, and little <br/>
boys (and sometimes big ones) are entitled to those adventures sometimes.<br/>

probably would have used NO! here. With a very quick explanation of why <br/>
not---and maybe let him spray ME! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

  I have to agree.  I don&#39;t think it was appropriate to let him enjoy that adventure at the neighbor&#39;s expense.<br/>
