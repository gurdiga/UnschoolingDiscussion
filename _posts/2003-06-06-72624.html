<br/>
But I think if someone is coming off school and seeing a child&#39;s activities<br/>
as projects instead of play, then it would be helpful for them to stop doing<br/>
that.<br/>

painting, she has her rock collection and her stamping (for example). If <br/>
you have to have costumes made in time for a play, then you have a <br/>
deadline, but you needn&#39;t think of it as a project.<br/>

medieval camping.  I had a plan,  I knew when I was finished, it was labelled <br/>
and frozen.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is working on a Viking bed.  That&#39;s a project.<br/>
When he&#39;s finished, he&#39;ll have a bed.<br/>
<br/>
If I asked one of my kids to do a project on Viking beds or a project on <br/>
breadmaking, IF what I&#39;m thinking is some kind of school-style thing, they would <br/>
have done some research, written something up, maybe made a poster or a model, <br/>
and MAYBE done one loaf of bread that they could discuss.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between doing a school-style project and actually doing <br/>
a real-life project.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is building a little deck.  It&#39;s a woodworking project, it&#39;s a <br/>
yard project, it&#39;s a $400 project (so far), but it&#39;s not &quot;a project on decks.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219593270">I&#39;m the one who brought that up.  I think &quot;project&quot; is a great word <br/>
and it doesn&#39;t really need to be replaced.  It just that in that <br/>
particular context it had a very schooly feel; needing to do <br/>
something specific and wanting help to accomplish that particular <br/>
thing.  <br/>

I must&#39;ve missed that convo, or it was before I joined but this is my <br/>
opinion. <br/>
<br/>
Phhhttt....No.  <br/>
<br/>
Why would you?  Was he in school were the word gives your child the willies?  <br/>
lol  Then I would give it a funny name, I dunno, interesting messy pile over <br/>
there, instead of calling it a project.  <br/>
<br/>
I have projects all over the house too.  They look just like interesting <br/>
messy piles, actually.  lol <br/>
