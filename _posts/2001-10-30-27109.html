<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825939325">Went to the Social Security office today.  Now, we live in the boonies.  I<br/>
seriously doubt that anyone could find us on the map let alone would think<br/>
about making a &quot;statement&quot; here.<br/>
<br/>
At the door was an *armed* rent-a-cop (which I find a tad more frightening<br/>
than the possibility of any terrorist acts up here) who demanded that all<br/>
women dump out their purses to be inspected, that all folks with fanny<br/>
pouches and backpacks dump them out also.  However, what didn&#39;t make any<br/>
sense to me was that he didn&#39;t request that folks carrying those zippered<br/>
daytimers that some folks use instead of purses dump them out.  Nor did he<br/>
ask the gal with the dog to dump out the dog&#39;s backpack.  Of course, the guy<br/>
looked to be about 70, so precisely what use would he be if some armed<br/>
terrorists decided to take over our local Social Security office, all 1000<br/>
square feet of it.<br/>

Life has become weird!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well... For what it&#39;s worth, this was posted to a state list this <br/>
morning (I&#39;ve stripped the original poster&#39;s identifiers from the <br/>
message). I found it interesting reading, but please note the <br/>
excellent caveats included by the original poster:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;In our national effort to preserve our lives from terrorism, have we<br/>
&gt;given our federal government way too much leeway with our<br/>
&gt;Constitutional rights?  Here&#39;s one opinion.  It may be a good place to<br/>
&gt;start a discussion of the Constitution within our own homes, with our<br/>
&gt;children and even as parents and citizens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The National Patriot Act bill in effect could be arguably one of the<br/>
&gt;most significant issues of liberty we have faced in years.  No matter<br/>
&gt;what your political or ideological persuasion, the implications of the<br/>
&gt;New USA Patriot Act could be far-reaching, and change the landscape of<br/>
&gt;American liberty and justice for years to come.  It is certainly worth<br/>
&gt;looking at quite seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;By the way, please note.  This article is written by John Kaminski.<br/>
&gt;It is published on a web page that is &quot;Breaking News and Views for the<br/>
&gt;Progressive Community.&quot;  I would hardly consider myself one to embrace<br/>
&gt;this type of web site on a regular basis.  (I was referred to the site<br/>
&gt;by the article, and had never known of it before now.  It is certainly<br/>
&gt;a politically left-leaning web site.)  But I think there are times<br/>
&gt;that people of different ideological positions can see a higher<br/>
&gt;principle from their particular vantage point.  This is one of those<br/>
&gt;cases.  It is up to each of us to judge whether the information<br/>
&gt;presented fits into our own personal political framework.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For me, when it comes to being vigilant to protect liberty, we have<br/>
&gt;just hit on one of those higher principles.  And I am willing to<br/>
&gt;embrace those whom I may differ with on other issues for the sake of<br/>
&gt;common ground.  Let us choose our wars carefully.  This may be one we<br/>
&gt;wish to choose.<br/>
&gt;The alternative could be much worse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One more thought.  We currently live under an administration that<br/>
&gt;appears to be (at the moment) pro-homeschooling.  Another<br/>
&gt;administration may not be so disposed.  I am not particularly<br/>
&gt;pro-Bush, nor anti-Bush for that matter.  There are people in this<br/>
&gt;administration that I like and others that I don&#39;t particularly like.<br/>
&gt;My point here is that even though the current administration may not<br/>
&gt;abuse this act today, it is now a part of our federal system of laws.<br/>
&gt;Future abuse is quite probable.  So now is the time to decide whether<br/>
&gt;or not it should be opposed or not.  We shouldn&#39;t wait until its abuse<br/>
&gt;is obvious.  Then may be too late.  And probably will be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Remember Jefferson&#39;s words, &quot;The price of freedom is eternal<br/>
&gt;vigilance.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Enjoy the read.  Then decide how your family will respond.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regards,<br/>

&gt;              The New USA PATRIOT Act<br/>
&gt;              Are You a Patriot?<br/>
&gt;              by John Kaminski<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The USA Patriot Act, now passed and the law of the land,<br/>
&gt;has<br/>
&gt;eliminated the Constitutional guarantee of probable cause when<br/>
&gt;investigating<br/>
&gt;a crime, and now allows the police  at any time and for any reason <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;enter and search your house, your files, your bank account  and not<br/>
&gt;even<br/>
&gt;tell you about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Are you a patriot? Well, the fact of the matter is, you<br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;whether you want to be or not. But are you an American or a mindless<br/>
&gt;corporate stooge? Well, that&#39;s another question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The recent passage and signing of the Patriot Act has<br/>
&gt;effectively nullified at least six amendments of the Bill of Rights<br/>
&gt;addendum<br/>
&gt;to the U.S. Constitution. As a result of this, America is no longer<br/>
&gt;America,<br/>
&gt;but a police state, pure and simple. This Patriot Bill is, in fact, a<br/>
&gt;massive violation of the Constitution it purports to uphold and<br/>
&gt;improve.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Among other things, it mandates that judges give police<br/>
&gt;search<br/>
&gt;warrants when they ask for them, for any reason. In fact, judges can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;deny<br/>
&gt;these warrants to police, because police don&#39;t need a stated reason to<br/>
&gt;ask<br/>
&gt;for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The Bill of Rights is the cornerstone of American freedom.<br/>
&gt;During the debates on the adoption of the Constitution in the 1790s,<br/>
&gt;its<br/>
&gt;opponents repeatedly charged that the Constitution as drafted would<br/>
&gt;open the<br/>
&gt;way to tyranny by the central government. Many states would not have<br/>
&gt;signed<br/>
&gt;the original Constitution without knowing that these amendments would<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;added, according to the federal website which displays the<br/>
&gt;Constitution.<br/>
&gt;These amendments became known as the Bill of Rights, which Americans<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;cherished, protected and fought for for over 200 years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The Patriot Act rushed through Congress and signed by<br/>
&gt;President<br/>
&gt;George W. Bush is a major step toward a totalitarian state in which<br/>
&gt;individual liberty is crushed by the whim of police and corporate<br/>
&gt;demagogues<br/>
&gt;masquerading as patriots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The Patriot Act:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                a.. Violates the First Amendment freedom of speech<br/>
&gt;guarantee,<br/>
&gt;right to peaceably assemble provision, and petition the government for<br/>
&gt;redress of grievances provision; it violates the First Amendment to<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Constitution three times. More on this below.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                b.. Violates the Fourth Amendment guarantee of probable<br/>
&gt;cause<br/>
&gt;in astonishingly major and repeated ways. The Fourth Amendment to the<br/>
&gt;Constitution reads: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their<br/>
&gt;persons,<br/>
&gt;houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and<br/>
&gt;seizures,<br/>
&gt;shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable<br/>
&gt;cause,<br/>
&gt;supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the<br/>
&gt;place to<br/>
&gt;be searched, and the persons of things to be seized.&quot; The Patriot Act,<br/>
&gt;now<br/>
&gt;passed and the law of the land, has revoked the necessity for probable<br/>
&gt;cause, and now allows the police, at any time and for any reason, to<br/>
&gt;enter<br/>
&gt;and search your house  and not even tell you about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                c.. Violates the Fifth Amendment by allowing for<br/>
&gt;indefinite<br/>
&gt;incarceration without trial for those deemed by the Attorney General<br/>
&gt;to be<br/>
&gt;threats to national security. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that no<br/>
&gt;person<br/>
&gt;shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of<br/>
&gt;law,<br/>
&gt;and the Patriot Act does away with due process. It even allows people<br/>
&gt;to be<br/>
&gt;kept in prison for life without even a trial.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                d.. Violates the Sixth Amendment guarantee of the right<br/>
&gt;to a<br/>
&gt;speedy and public trial. Now you may get no trial at all, ever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                e.. Violates the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual<br/>
&gt;punishment).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                f.. Violates the 13th Amendment (punishment without<br/>
&gt;conviction).<br/>
&gt;              Most of the following information is taken from the ACLU&#39;s<br/>
&gt;written objections to Congress before and after the passage of the<br/>
&gt;Patriot<br/>
&gt;Act. My comments are in brackets [].<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The Patriot Act does the following (I&#39;m putting the<br/>
&gt;immigration<br/>
&gt;stuff at the bottom because that least affects most of the people who<br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;be reading this):<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                a.. [It keeps judges out the process and lets cops do<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt;they want (cops meaning FBI, CIA, etc.)] It minimizes judicial<br/>
&gt;supervision<br/>
&gt;of telephone and Internet surveillance by law enforcement authorities<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;anti-terrorism investigations and in routine criminal investigations<br/>
&gt;unrelated to terrorism. [Unrelated to terrorism  that means anything.<br/>
&gt;How<br/>
&gt;long do you think before that includes political dissent? Oops, too<br/>
&gt;late,<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s already happened.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                b.. It expands the ability of the government to conduct<br/>
&gt;secret<br/>
&gt;searches  again in anti-terrorism investigations and in routine<br/>
&gt;criminal<br/>
&gt;investigations unrelated to terrorism. [Unrelated to terrorism  that<br/>
&gt;means<br/>
&gt;anything they want it to mean. If we don&#39;t agree with Nazi Republican<br/>
&gt;ideas,<br/>
&gt;they can now arrest us.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                c.. It gives the Attorney General and the Secretary of<br/>
&gt;State<br/>
&gt;the power to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations and<br/>
&gt;block<br/>
&gt;any non-citizen who belongs to them from entering the country. Under<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;provision the payment of membership dues is a deportable offense.<br/>
&gt;[That<br/>
&gt;means, among other things, that Bush and Ashcroft can decide<br/>
&gt;Greenpeace and<br/>
&gt;Ralph Nader are terrorists, and under this law, it can put them in<br/>
&gt;jail.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                d.. It grants the FBI broad access to sensitive medical,<br/>
&gt;financial, mental health, and educational records about individuals<br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt;having to show evidence of a crime and without a court order. [It<br/>
&gt;means they<br/>
&gt;can do what they want for no good reason, except to persecute and<br/>
&gt;imprison<br/>
&gt;people with humanistic, noncorporate rip-off views.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                e.. It could lead to large-scale investigations of<br/>
&gt;American<br/>
&gt;citizens for &quot;intelligence&quot; purposes and use of intelligence<br/>
&gt;authorities to<br/>
&gt;by-pass probable cause requirements in criminal cases. [Bye bye peace<br/>
&gt;movement. You&#39;re all going to jail; me too.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                f.. It puts the CIA and other intelligence agencies back<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the business of spying on Americans by giving the Director of Central<br/>
&gt;Intelligence the authority to identify priority targets for<br/>
&gt;intelligence<br/>
&gt;surveillance in the United States. [This is what America worked so<br/>
&gt;hard for<br/>
&gt;all those years to eliminate.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                g.. It allows searches of highly personal financial<br/>
&gt;records<br/>
&gt;without notice and without judicial review based on a very low<br/>
&gt;standard that<br/>
&gt;does not require probable cause of a crime or even relevancy to an<br/>
&gt;ongoing<br/>
&gt;terrorism investigation. [They can do any of this stuff without any<br/>
&gt;reason<br/>
&gt;whatsoever. This is the kind of freedom these fascists always wanted <br/>
&gt;freedom to put everyone who disagrees with them in jail.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;                h.. It creates a broad new definition of &quot;domestic<br/>
&gt;terrorism&quot;<br/>
&gt;that could sweep in people who engage in acts of political protest and<br/>
&gt;subject them to wiretapping and enhanced penalties. [This means they<br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;jail anyone who disagrees with them, and keep them in jail for life<br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt;a trial.]<br/>
&gt;              On immigration specifically, the new law permits the<br/>
&gt;detention<br/>
&gt;of non-citizens facing deportation based merely on the Attorney<br/>
&gt;General&#39;s<br/>
&gt;certification that he has &quot;reasonable grounds to believe&quot; the<br/>
&gt;non-citizen<br/>
&gt;endangers national security. While immigration or criminal charges<br/>
&gt;must be<br/>
&gt;filed within seven days, these charges need not have anything to do<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;terrorism, but can be minor visa violations of the kind that normally<br/>
&gt;would<br/>
&gt;not result in detention at all. Non-citizens ordered removed on visa<br/>
&gt;violations could be indefinitely detained if they are stateless, their<br/>
&gt;country of origin refuses to accept them, or they are granted relief<br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;deportation because they would be tortured if they were returned to<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;country of origin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              It permits the Attorney General to indefinitely<br/>
&gt;incarcerate or<br/>
&gt;detain non-citizens based on mere suspicion, and to deny readmission<br/>
&gt;to the<br/>
&gt;United States of non-citizens (including lawful permanent residents)<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;engaging in speech protected by the First Amendment. [Or, what used to<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;the First Amendment. Now, it doesn&#39;t exist.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Let me just take a bit more of your valuable time to make<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;couple of points crystal clear, again using material from the ACLU&#39;s<br/>
&gt;objections to passage of the Patriot Act.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Wiretapping and Intelligence Surveillance<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The wiretapping and intelligence provisions in the USA<br/>
&gt;Patriot<br/>
&gt;Act sound two themes: they minimize the role of a judge in ensuring<br/>
&gt;that law<br/>
&gt;enforcement wiretapping is conducted legally and with proper<br/>
&gt;justification,<br/>
&gt;and they permit use of intelligence investigative authority to by-pass<br/>
&gt;normal criminal procedures that protect privacy. Specifically:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              1. The USA Patriot Act allows the government to use its<br/>
&gt;intelligence gathering power to circumvent the standard that must be<br/>
&gt;met for<br/>
&gt;criminal wiretaps. Currently FISA surveillance, which does not contain<br/>
&gt;many<br/>
&gt;of the same checks and balances that govern wiretaps for criminal<br/>
&gt;purposes,<br/>
&gt;can be used only when foreign intelligence gathering is the primary<br/>
&gt;purpose.<br/>
&gt;The new law allows use of FISA surveillance authority even if the<br/>
&gt;primary<br/>
&gt;purpose were a criminal investigation. Intelligence surveillance<br/>
&gt;merely<br/>
&gt;needs to be only a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This provision authorizes<br/>
&gt;unconstitutional physical searches and wiretaps: though it is<br/>
&gt;searching<br/>
&gt;primarily for evidence of crime, law enforcement conducts a search<br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt;probable cause of crime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              2. The USA Patriot Act extends a very low threshold of<br/>
&gt;proof for<br/>
&gt;access to Internet communications that are far more revealing than<br/>
&gt;numbers<br/>
&gt;dialed on a phone. Under current law, a law enforcement agent can get<br/>
&gt;a pen<br/>
&gt;register or trap and trace order requiring the telephone company to<br/>
&gt;reveal<br/>
&gt;the numbers dialed to and from a particular phone. To get such an<br/>
&gt;order, law<br/>
&gt;enforcement must simply certify to a judge  who must grant the<br/>
&gt;order  that<br/>
&gt;the information to be obtained is &quot;relevant to an ongoing criminal<br/>
&gt;investigation.&quot; This is a very low level of proof, far less than<br/>
&gt;probable<br/>
&gt;cause. This provision apparently applies to law enforcement efforts to<br/>
&gt;determine what websites a person had visited, which is like giving law<br/>
&gt;enforcement the power  based only on its own certification  to<br/>
&gt;require the<br/>
&gt;librarian to report on the books you had perused while visiting the<br/>
&gt;public<br/>
&gt;library. This provision extends a low standard of proof  far less<br/>
&gt;than<br/>
&gt;probable cause  to actual &quot;content&quot; information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              3. In allowing for &quot;nationwide service&quot; of pen register<br/>
&gt;and trap<br/>
&gt;and trace orders, the law further marginalizes the role of the<br/>
&gt;judiciary. It<br/>
&gt;authorizes what would be the equivalent of a blank warrant in the<br/>
&gt;physical<br/>
&gt;world: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the places to be searched. This is not consistent with the important<br/>
&gt;Fourth<br/>
&gt;Amendment privacy protection of requiring that warrants specify the<br/>
&gt;place to<br/>
&gt;be searched. Under this legislation, a judge is unable to meaningfully<br/>
&gt;monitor the extent to which her order was being used to access<br/>
&gt;information<br/>
&gt;about Internet communications.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              4. The Act also grants the FBI broad access in<br/>
&gt;&quot;intelligence&quot;<br/>
&gt;investigations to records about a person maintained by a business. The<br/>
&gt;FBI<br/>
&gt;need only certify to a court that it is conducting an intelligence<br/>
&gt;investigation and that the records it seeks may be relevant. With this<br/>
&gt;new<br/>
&gt;power, the FBI can force a business to turn over a person&#39;s<br/>
&gt;educational,<br/>
&gt;medical, financial, mental health and travel records based on a very<br/>
&gt;low<br/>
&gt;standard of proof and without meaningful judicial oversight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The ACLU noted that the FBI already had broad authority to<br/>
&gt;monitor telephone and Internet communications. Most of the changes<br/>
&gt;apply not<br/>
&gt;just to surveillance of terrorists, but instead to all surveillance in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;United States. [All surveillance. The WTO geeks will love this one.<br/>
&gt;Now we<br/>
&gt;can be just like China.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Law enforcement authorities -- even when they are required<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;obtain court orders - have great leeway under current law to<br/>
&gt;investigate<br/>
&gt;suspects in terrorist attacks. Current law already provided, for<br/>
&gt;example,<br/>
&gt;that wiretaps can be obtained for the crimes involved in terrorist<br/>
&gt;attacks,<br/>
&gt;including destruction of aircraft and aircraft piracy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The FBI also already had authority to intercept these<br/>
&gt;communications without showing probable cause of crime for<br/>
&gt;&quot;intelligence&quot;<br/>
&gt;purposes under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In fact,<br/>
&gt;FISA<br/>
&gt;wiretaps now exceed wiretapping for all domestic criminal<br/>
&gt;investigations.<br/>
&gt;The standards for obtaining a FISA wiretap are lower than the<br/>
&gt;standards for<br/>
&gt;obtaining a criminal wiretap.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              Criminal Justice<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The law dramatically expands the use of secret searches.<br/>
&gt;Normally, a person is notified when law enforcement conducts a search.<br/>
&gt;In<br/>
&gt;some cases regarding searches for electronic information, law<br/>
&gt;enforcement<br/>
&gt;authorities can get court permission to delay notification of a<br/>
&gt;search. The<br/>
&gt;USA Patriot Act extends the authority of the government to request<br/>
&gt;&quot;secret<br/>
&gt;searches&quot; to every criminal case. This vast expansion of power goes<br/>
&gt;far<br/>
&gt;beyond anything necessary to conduct terrorism investigations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The Act also allows for the broad sharing of sensitive<br/>
&gt;information in criminal cases with intelligence agencies, including<br/>
&gt;the CIA,<br/>
&gt;the NSA, the INS and the Secret Service. It permits sharing of<br/>
&gt;sensitive<br/>
&gt;grand jury and wiretap information without judicial review or any<br/>
&gt;safeguards<br/>
&gt;regarding the future use or dissemination of such information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              These information sharing authorizations and mandates<br/>
&gt;effectively put the CIA back in the business of spying on Americans:<br/>
&gt;Once<br/>
&gt;the CIA makes clear the kind of information it seeks, law enforcement<br/>
&gt;agencies can use tools like wiretaps and intelligence searches to<br/>
&gt;provide<br/>
&gt;data to the CIA. In fact, the law specifically gives the Director of<br/>
&gt;Central<br/>
&gt;Intelligence - who heads the CIA -- the power to identify domestic<br/>
&gt;intelligence requirements.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              The law also creates a new crime of &quot;domestic terrorism.&quot;<br/>
&gt;The<br/>
&gt;new offense threatens to transform protesters into terrorists if they<br/>
&gt;engage<br/>
&gt;in conduct that &quot;involves acts dangerous to human life.&quot; Members of<br/>
&gt;Operation Rescue, the Environmental Liberation Front and Greenpeace,<br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;example, have all engaged in activities that could subject them to<br/>
&gt;prosecution as terrorists. Then, under this law, the dominos begin to<br/>
&gt;fall.<br/>
&gt;Those who provide lodging or other assistance to these &quot;domestic<br/>
&gt;terrorists&quot;<br/>
&gt;could have their homes wiretapped and could be prosecuted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              [If you have any doubt that these are the trappings of a<br/>
&gt;police<br/>
&gt;state, then you need to go back to elementary school and read about<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Constitution, which we no longer have.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;              [Fox News Channel reports tonight that 90% of the American<br/>
&gt;people are really happy with what Bush has done. I think somebody<br/>
&gt;wrote this<br/>
&gt;all in a book once, that when a free people gave away their freedom,<br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;did it happily and with much fanfare.]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536634054">Discussions I&#39;ve had about the constitution include the information that laws do not supercede it.<br/>
Laws are frequently passed that are unconstitutional, and are then overturned.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, all the following are hyperbole. (comments below)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;In our national effort to preserve our lives from terrorism, have we<br/>
&gt; &gt;given our federal government way too much leeway with our<br/>
&gt; &gt;Constitutional rights?  Here&#39;s one opinion.  It may be a good place to<br/>
&gt; &gt;start a discussion of the Constitution within our own homes, with our<br/>
&gt; &gt;children and even as parents and citizens.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;              The USA Patriot Act, now passed and the law of the land,<br/>
&gt; &gt;has eliminated the Constitutional guarantee of probable cause when<br/>
&gt; &gt;investigating<br/>
&gt; &gt;a crime, and now allows the police  at any time and for any reason <br/>
&gt; &gt;to enter and search your house, your files, your bank account  and not<br/>
&gt; &gt;even tell you about it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;              The recent passage and signing of the Patriot Act has<br/>
&gt; &gt;effectively nullified at least six amendments of the Bill of Rights<br/>
&gt; &gt;addendum<br/>
&gt; &gt;to the U.S. Constitution. As a result of this, America is no longer<br/>
&gt; &gt;America,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but a police state, pure and simple. This Patriot Bill is, in fact, a<br/>
&gt; &gt;massive violation of the Constitution it purports to uphold and<br/>
&gt; &gt;improve.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;              The Patriot Act rushed through Congress and signed by<br/>
&gt; &gt;President<br/>
&gt; &gt;George W. Bush is a major step toward a totalitarian state in which<br/>
&gt; &gt;individual liberty is crushed by the whim of police and corporate<br/>
&gt; &gt;demagogues masquerading as patriots.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt;              The Patriot Act:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                a.. Violates the First Amendment freedom of speech<br/>
&gt; &gt;guarantee,<br/>
&gt; &gt;right to peaceably assemble provision, and petition the government for<br/>
&gt; &gt;redress of grievances provision; it violates the First Amendment to<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Constitution three times. More on this below.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                b.. Violates the Fourth Amendment guarantee of probable<br/>
&gt; &gt;cause<br/>
&gt; &gt;in astonishingly major and repeated ways. The Fourth Amendment to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Constitution reads: &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their<br/>
&gt; &gt;persons,<br/>
&gt; &gt;houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and<br/>
&gt; &gt;seizures,<br/>
&gt; &gt;shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable<br/>
&gt; &gt;cause,<br/>
&gt; &gt;supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the<br/>
&gt; &gt;place to<br/>
&gt; &gt;be searched, and the persons of things to be seized.&quot; The Patriot Act,<br/>
&gt; &gt;now<br/>
&gt; &gt;passed and the law of the land, has revoked the necessity for probable<br/>
&gt; &gt;cause, and now allows the police, at any time and for any reason, to<br/>
&gt; &gt;enter<br/>
&gt; &gt;and search your house  and not even tell you about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                c.. Violates the Fifth Amendment by allowing for<br/>
&gt; &gt;indefinite<br/>
&gt; &gt;incarceration without trial for those deemed by the Attorney General<br/>
&gt; &gt;to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;threats to national security. The Fifth Amendment guarantees that no<br/>
&gt; &gt;person<br/>
&gt; &gt;shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of<br/>
&gt; &gt;law,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and the Patriot Act does away with due process. It even allows people<br/>
&gt; &gt;to be<br/>
&gt; &gt;kept in prison for life without even a trial.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                d.. Violates the Sixth Amendment guarantee of the right<br/>
&gt; &gt;to a<br/>
&gt; &gt;speedy and public trial. Now you may get no trial at all, ever.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                e.. Violates the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual<br/>
&gt; &gt;punishment).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;                f.. Violates the 13th Amendment (punishment without<br/>
&gt; &gt;conviction).<br/>
&gt; &gt;              Most of the following information is taken from the ACLU&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;written objections to Congress before and after the passage of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Patriot Act.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would lawmakers pass a law that is so very obviously unconstitutional? Because it&#39;s popular! They<br/>
get the credit for having passed it, then it&#39;s overturned by the courts. It&#39;s not the first time, it<br/>
won&#39;t be the last; in fact, it&#39;s really common for laws that can&#39;t and obviously won&#39;t be upheld to<br/>
pass for political points.<br/>

purposes, destroying our freedom.  And they got the government to do it for <br/>
them.  We seem to be doing much the same in Canada.  Well, of course we <br/>
have to, or Bush might get mad at us.........sigh.<br/>
