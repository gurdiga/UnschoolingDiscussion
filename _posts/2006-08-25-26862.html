<div id="ygrps-yiv-389377727">Someone on my local list brought this article in Ode Magazine to my  <br/>
attention   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.odemagazine.com/currentIssue.php.">http://www.odemagazine.com/currentIssue.php.</a><br/>
<br/>
I found it interesting and a smart defense for the virtues of video- <br/>
gaming!   I thought the line about a company that is developing  <br/>
&quot;educational&quot; video-games for classrooms, was kind of telling and  <br/>
humorous in a sad way:<br/>
<br/>
...But won�t educational games always lose out to their commercial  <br/>
equivalents purely focused on entertainment? �That�s not the  <br/>
competition here,� Bushnell replies. �Educational games are competing  <br/>
against the boring teacher in the front of the class who is just not  <br/>
capable of engaging his students.�<br/>
