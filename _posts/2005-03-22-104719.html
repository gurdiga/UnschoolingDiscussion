&lt;&lt; So I think it&#39;s a Howard Gardner thang. Some are good, <br/>
some are not, and some have to work at it. But I really don&#39;t <br/>
think we are &quot;programmed&quot; to learn the languages of our origins! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  I have a friend who EASILY learned Spanish, Navajo and Mandarin <br/>
Chinese all within the same few years.  Those languages are EXTREMELY and <br/>
entirely unrelated to the others.    He went to China to teach English.  It didn&#39;t go <br/>
well.  He has a natural ability to understand grammar and to pick up and <br/>
remember vocabulary, but one of Gardner&#39;s abilities is not his best thing.  <br/>
Interpersonal.  He wasn&#39;t even interested in learning what offended other people, <br/>
and China&#39;s a bad place to live for one who feels that way.  He liked to think <br/>
that his words should just be taken literally and the social stuff was optional.<br/>

OOps.<br/>

<br/>
This makes sense to me.  I struggle with languages.  I grew  up in a Navajo <br/>
community but had difficulty even learning that  language as a young child. <br/>
(tough language anyway and wasn&#39;t even written down  when I was young)  In <br/>
college, I took two Spanish courses and one German  course and ended up dropping <br/>
both because of my frustration.<br/>
However, I learned sign language and become very fluent quite easily. <br/>
 <br/>
While I am strong in linguistic intelligence, it is all visually  related.  I <br/>
have difficulty processing auditory information unless I have  something <br/>
written to go along with it.  I can follow the written foreign  language <br/>
information but when it comes to understanding and speaking it, I&#39;m  just lost.  I <br/>
really understood this for the first time just recently and  can now see all the <br/>
ways I&#39;ve learned to compensate for this.  <br/>
 <br/>
I like to have the subtitles on when I watch a movie or TV.  The kids  know <br/>
not to read an e-mail or newspaper article to me because I just have so  much <br/>
trouble understanding it unless I can see it.  In school I learned to  take <br/>
very specific notes because I just couldn&#39;t depend on<br/>
just listening to understand the material. <br/>
 <br/>
My daughter seems to be similar to me. Brenna loves to read  books and will <br/>
usually read in the room with us rather than watch a movie.   She told me this <br/>
morning of being at an Odyssey of the Mind meeting last night  where a friend <br/>
was reading an explanation of a problem clarification and she  just couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand it until she read it herself.  Logan on the other  hand, will stop <br/>
in mid step if he sees and hears a TV show or video game on  a screen and <br/>
completely can tune out anything else in the room. He seems to be  able to process <br/>
both visual and auditory information easily but is stronger  <br/>
logically/mathematically than he is linguistically.<br/>
 <br/>
I find it all fascinating.  I wish I&#39;d understood this in my college  years <br/>
and even a few years ago when I tried to learn some Spanish with the  kids.  It <br/>
might have saved me a lot of frustration and possibly I  could have found <br/>
another method of learning.  Because of all the  negative experiences, I&#39;m <br/>
hesitant to try again.  I am fairly fluent in  English....&gt;G&lt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Me too!  <br/>
<br/>
I can generally read along in Spanish or French and speak the words in  <br/>
English (like translating directions or whatever, or a webpage if it comes up in  <br/>
French or Spanish), but I wouldn&#39;t be able to read it aloud without botching it <br/>
 in those languages.<br/>

 <br/>
Me too.  <br/>
Especially if they&#39;re Brit or Australian, I can miss a phrase  entirely.<br/>
 <br/>
And if the subtitles are on I&#39;m so multi-processing that if someone says  <br/>
somethign to me I can understand them and keep up with the movie.  I don&#39;t  carry <br/>
on whole conversations, I can pause.  But if I&#39;m listening with  subtitles <br/>
and I hear ANYthing that outranks the movie, I have to rewind to that  part and <br/>
hear it again.  If the subtitles were on, I&#39;m okay.<br/>

 <br/>
Me too, but my kids aren&#39;t that way and I suspect it MIGHT be from being  <br/>
later readers and learning to remember things they heard. Maybe it&#39;s more of an  <br/>
indwelling thing, but I feel crippled sometimes by needing things in writing,  <br/>
and I live amidst piles of paper with notes and dates and times.    That&#39;s no <br/>
good way to live.<br/>

 <br/>
I  have the same thing, and I didn&#39;t realize it til college, either.  My<br/>
freshman year I got my first C ever in a large lecture class - I<br/>
couldn&#39;t see the instructor&#39;s lips to get visual clues for the lectures.<br/>
My second C was from an instructor who lectured with her back to the<br/>
class, while writing on the board.  But her chalkboard writings were<br/>
only part of the lecture - what she was saying sometimes changed the<br/>
meaning of what she wrote, so I didn&#39;t get it.  After those two<br/>
experiences I read a book called &quot;Smart but Feeling Dumb&quot; which talked<br/>
about &quot;auditory dyslexia&quot; (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not called that any more -<br/>
maybe it&#39;s part of auditory processing disorder?) and I put it all<br/>
together.  Just like you, I use subtitles on tv shows.  I can&#39;t<br/>
understand when someone reads aloud.  I feel asocial at parties because<br/>
I can&#39;t understand what people are saying in the midst of crowded rooms.<br/>
It&#39;s not a hearing problem - it&#39;s an understanding problem.  In grad<br/>
school I had to re-take the classes I got Cs in (they were central to my<br/>
area of study and my advisors wanted to be certain I had a good<br/>
grounding in them).  In the 10 person round-table type of course at that<br/>
university, I aced both.  I think it&#39;s fascinating that our brains work<br/>
so differently!  Why does a school system think they can effectively<br/>
teach everyone the same material when all our brains learn in such<br/>
different ways???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, it&#39;s the act of writing that cements the memory. If I write <br/>
something on the calendar, I&#39;m much more likely to remember it than <br/>
if not--even if I don&#39;t go back and read the calendar. Same thing <br/>
with taking notes in college. Reading them back before an exam didn&#39;t <br/>
do much to help, but having written them--and maybe re-writing them-- <br/>
did matter. I can pull up the mental image of what I wrote better <br/>
than I can read the words, I think. <br/>
<br/>
So maybe...if I write out the musical notes of a song, I&#39;ll be more <br/>
likely to sing it in tune?? Hey, maybe...at least I&#39;d be more likely <br/>
to head the right direction up or down the scale, which is hit or <br/>
miss usually.<br/>
