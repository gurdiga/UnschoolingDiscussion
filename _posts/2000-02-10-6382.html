&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Captain Underpants&quot;??????????????????????<br/>
&gt;Please explain.  I&#39;m afraid that sounds mighty interesting!<br/>
&gt;Ann<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is the newest book by Dav Pilkey, &quot;Captain Underpants and the Perilous<br/>
Plot of Proffessor Poopypants&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The humor is a little on the goofy/gross side, but its all pretty harmless<br/>
and actually the underlying social commentary is making fun of public<br/>
schools and how useless and boring they can be if the teachers are boring<br/>
people just putting in their time there.  It is put out by SCHOLASTIC.  This<br/>
morning we were rolling on the ground laughing as we read the part about the<br/>
professor with the silly name making everyone else change their names... Of<br/>
course we had to see what our names would become.... we were the<br/>
&quot;Waffleshorts&quot; Family and my kids were Poopsie and Gidget! They thought it<br/>
was histarical.... and I couldnt help but join them :-)<br/>
Certainly not for everyone, but then we have never represented the taste of<br/>
&quot;everyone&quot; !!</div>
