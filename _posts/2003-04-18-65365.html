Didn&#39;t you say your son is now in college??  If that is the case, it isn&#39;t <br/>
even necessary for me to state my opinions on the matter other than to say, <br/>
your son is an adult and HE is making the decision to take Ritalin at this <br/>
point.  Obviously, you are very content with the decisions you and your son <br/>
have made and I think that&#39;s what matters for *you*.<br/>
<br/>
(Please don&#39;t take this as though I am trying to be rude, as I am not.  I <br/>
just don&#39;t know how else to say it so that it will make sense.)  What we <br/>
think really doesn&#39;t matter in the end.  We can offer our thoughts and <br/>
experiences for you to take or leave at will.  If you feel like something is <br/>
rubbing you the wrong way, either you feel a hint of guilt for your decision <br/>
or you feel sound in your decision and want to help us understand.  There <br/>
will always be those that won&#39;t understand, no matter how many times you try <br/>
to explain it to them.  (Think unschooling!)  I can see that you feel very <br/>
passionate about the improvements you have seen in your son as a result of <br/>
Ritalin.  To that, I say GREAT!  Seriously!  The possible future <br/>
ramifications are something only you and your son will have to face.  Not me <br/>
and not anyone else on this list.  Kuddos to you for doing what you feel is <br/>
best for your family!  That&#39;s not to say every comment should be discounted, <br/>
just that you have done what any of us would do and that is to make the best <br/>
informed decision with the information you have at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Light,<br/>
