I hated history until I read the Little House Series to my girls. <br/>
Thought it was sooo boring.  Now I know that history is just people&#39;s<br/>
stories.  OK, not &quot;just&quot; stories, but far more than a series of wars and<br/>
dates.  Unfortunately, school has a way of turning kids off of<br/>
&quot;subjects&quot;.<br/>
