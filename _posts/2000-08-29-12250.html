&lt;&lt; Do I give in and eventually <br/>
 give up the few hours I have for myself or do I be a stick in the mud <br/>
 about the bedtime routine 7 days a week. I have found that if I do <br/>
 give up my few hours to myself it affects the way I interact and  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too!  I don&#39;t have a set bedtime, but I do have a timeframe I try to<br/>
work with. I didn;&#39;t need my alone time until after my third child was<br/>
born.  Now I just need to be &quot;off duty&quot;.  I get very resentful if they<br/>
aren&#39;t going to bed and asking me for help, fix food etc.  I hate to<br/>
be that way so I try to ward it off, remind them to eat, give them <br/>
lots of prep time to gear down for bed. Even still they don&#39;t have to<br/>
go to sleep, but may lay quietly in bed reading/talking/playing with<br/>
doll etc. So yes, I would say stick with the routinte.  (this is coming<br/>
from a very unscheduled, non regimented person too LOL).  <br/>

Sometimes it doesn&#39;t seem to matter how much they eat at dinner and <br/>
before bed they still get up and ask for an egg. My rule is that I <br/>
don&#39;t cook after dinner. If they really are hungery and they have had <br/>
a snack or didn&#39;t eat much at dinner then they can always have more <br/>
dinner. Either way if they wait until bedtime to ask for something <br/>
else to eat they get more dinner or something that doesn&#39;t require me <br/>
to prepare like a slice of cheese or ham or a piece of fruit.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do the same thing but it doesn&#39;t always seem to work. Ultimately I <br/>
leave the responsability on DS, the 5yo. I give him the choice and if <br/>
he doesn&#39;t like what is offered then he doesn&#39;t have to eat but I <br/>
always make sure to offer him something reasonable. I guess I do the <br/>
same thing with 3yod also. If she tells me she is hungery then I will <br/>
offer her something good to eat. If they really are hungery they will <br/>
sit down and eat. If not they will start to play instead of eat or <br/>
just won&#39;t accept the offer of food. If they choose to eat and play <br/>
instead then they don&#39;t get any more offers and then get in trouble <br/>
the next time they tell me they are hungery.<br/>
<br/>
 Even still they don&#39;t have to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; go to sleep, but may lay quietly in bed reading/talking/playing with<br/>
&gt; doll etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tell mine the same thing. You don&#39;t have to go to sleep and you do <br/>
have to stay in your bed. You can read or play quietly, just stay in <br/>
your bed. Oh and another excuse they use is that they miss Daddy. I <br/>
know sometimes this is real, that they really can&#39;t sleep because <br/>
they miss him. I also know that sometimes they are just using it as <br/>
an excuse to stay up and get some attention. DH is a police officer <br/>
and usually I will offer them one of his uniform shirts to sleep in. <br/>
They like this and they have to stay in thier beds or it will get <br/>
taken away. I used to didn&#39;t use it as a privilage until they started <br/>
using it as an excuse to get out of bed. It is pretty easy to tell <br/>
the difference.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am also fairly unscheduled. DH thinks I need to be more structured <br/>
in my HSing. But how do you unschool and provide a structure to your <br/>
day? Usually, I ask the kids what they are going to do this morning, <br/>
after lunch, when we get home, after dinner, etc. I let them decide <br/>
what the structure is. If there is something I need/want them to do <br/>
then I tell them they have to do &quot;this&quot; first and then they can do <br/>
what they want. Also, if they start running wild in the house they <br/>
get sent outside and have to stay out till they are ready to be calm. <br/>
If they complain that it is too hot, which it often is, then they can <br/>
always get in the wading pool or play in the water. If they choose <br/>
not to that is their choice, but if they decide to come in the house <br/>
they have to do something quiet/constructive, not just run and yell <br/>
through the house. DH is usually asleep during the day, so this is <br/>
important.  Corallyn</div>
