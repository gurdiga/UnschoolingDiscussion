<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021398310">WOW, Karen I went through this EXACT thing w/ my *best* friend when I was pg<br/>
w/ my oldest ch (24+ yrs ago) ... my *friend* literally cried when I told<br/>
her I was *pg* and could NOT stand the idea that I was having a baby (mind<br/>
you, we&#39;d WAITED *4* VERY LONG YEARS for our little blessing!!!) ... she&#39;d<br/>
been married about the same length of time as we were but she didn&#39;t want<br/>
any dch b/c she didn&#39;t want to lose her girlish figure!!!  dh believed she<br/>
was *threatened* b/c someone (my baby) was moving into her *space* ~~&gt;&gt;<br/>
*uhhhhhhhhhh* now you&#39;ll have~ta GET LOST!!!* &lt;&lt;~~  it&#39;s unfortunate that<br/>
sometimes *friends* grow apart but honest to Pete, I didn&#39;t lose much sleep<br/>
over it, let me tell you!!!<br/>
<br/>
*wellllllllll*, if this DOES happen to you, Dawn F, ***cheer up***, you&#39;ll<br/>
find soon find a new circle of like~minded h-s&#39;ing friends to fill that<br/>
space!!!  I think h-s&#39;rs naturally gravitate towards other h-s&#39;rs whether<br/>
we&#39;re unschoolers, traditional h-s&#39;rs, Christian h-s&#39;rs, non-Christian<br/>
h-s&#39;rs, whether or not mom&#39;s wear blue denim dresses/not or whether or not<br/>
we wear Birkenstocks/not ... we usually seek out like~minded folks to make<br/>
it through life w/!!!  @ least that&#39;s my $.02 ... btw, I *DO* wear both blue<br/>
denim dresses AND Birks; I even have a RED pair!!! hehehe ...<br/>
<br/>
welcome to the group, Dawn F. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453307897">Well, true feminists will be, but the feminist movement as a whole <br/>
has tended towards masculinising women&#39;s behaviour, making us <br/>
more competitive, etc.  And while I undersantd your point, that the <br/>
fathers could be the main parent, I believe that mothering should <br/>
be done by mothers, not fathers, not daycare staff or <br/>
&#39;childminders,&#39; and this cannot be replaced by anything in a child&#39;s <br/>
life.<br/>
