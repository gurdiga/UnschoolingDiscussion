&gt;(The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>
&gt;approved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>
&gt;unconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>
&gt;around the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>
&gt;through (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>
&gt;and the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>
&gt;education so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I feel about this case in essence. Its not as outright <br/>
apalling as it seems at first.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants have decided to take on this fight of a constitution that is <br/>
surely up for interpretation. Additionally, they have decided to take it <br/>
on before getting support of least a few  hundred other homeschoolers. <br/>
This leaves them at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Their beleif that, and I quote &quot;I consider this to be a spiritual battle. <br/>
 It takes faith in God and conviction to truth.&quot; Is altruistic and beyond <br/>
anything I myself have the energy for.<br/>
<br/>
As I have stated in the NY-Alert listserv, from where this discussion is <br/>
also heatedly taking place and also subcribed to by the Bryants, that one <br/>
takes on the big guys when one has enough voices behind them to listen.<br/>
<br/>
Again, again and again I repeat. This is by no means an opinion to take <br/>
away from the emotional pain that the entire Bryant family is going <br/>
through.<br/>
