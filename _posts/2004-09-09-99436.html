<div id="ygrps-yiv-650775053">I was contacted to day by a mom in SC who wants to learn more about  <br/>
unschooling. Her issue is that her family is Muslim. She&#39;s looking to  connect with <br/>
other Muslim unschooling families. The only one I know is  Asmaa---where are you?<br/>
 <br/>
If there&#39;s someone els willing to talk with her, I&#39;ll forward you her info.  <br/>
Please let me know!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
