<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353719411">I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the posts and looking at the archives and know <br/>
this might be a good place to help me grow.  My name is Beth.  I <br/>
live in Georgia with my DH and 3 children.  My kids are dd13, ds9 <br/>
and dd7.  Right now, only my 9 year old son is homeschooling.  I <br/>
share custody of my oldest daughter with her dad (he and his wife <br/>
are school teachers) and she has never been homeschooled.  My 7 year <br/>
old is in 2nd grade at the local public school.<br/>
<br/>
We began our homeschooling journey in early 2002 when we took our <br/>
son out of ps Kindergarten.  We started with a traditional boxed <br/>
curriculum which turned out to be a horrid expensive mistake.  We <br/>
then learned about unschooling and moved into a relaxed lifestyle <br/>
that left all the pressures of school behind.  Sometime during that <br/>
year, I discovered a literature based curriculum and started <br/>
borrowing books from its catalog.  Then I decided it wouldn&#39;t hurt <br/>
to just jump in and do a whole program.  I&#39;ve been curriculum <br/>
hopping since that time.  I&#39;m sad to say I reached a point last <br/>
October where I felt totally overwhelmed with life and put my two <br/>
youngest children back in school.  My ds9 was against the whole <br/>
thing and hated it from the 1st day.  My dd7, otoh, was very excited <br/>
to be going to school.  She&#39;s a social butterfly and says that being <br/>
home is very boring.  She wants to be around a bunch of kids all day <br/>
every day.  I took my son out after 13 days.  He is so much happier <br/>
at home.  My daughter isn&#39;t ready to quit though.  I thought for <br/>
sure that she&#39;d decide to remain home after the holiday break but <br/>
she is eager to return this week.  I must say I feel terribly <br/>
disappointed.  She said she&#39;d quit if I really wanted her to quit <br/>
but that she&#39;d rather stay in for a while.  My DH wants me to leave <br/>
her in until she decides to come home on her own.  I&#39;d feel better <br/>
about that decision if she loved every day, but she comes home 2 - 3 <br/>
days per week in tears because she&#39;s had a bad day.  I&#39;ve asked her <br/>
how I can make homeschooling more appealing again but she says there <br/>
isn&#39;t anything I can do and that she&#39;d rather stay in school.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve jumped around in homeschooling methods, trying to find that <br/>
perfect fit.  Most of the time we begin something enthusiastically, <br/>
only to have it fizzle out within a few weeks.  When I look deep <br/>
within myself, I see it&#39;s always me pushing though, and my kids just <br/>
trying to please me.  We get to a point where we&#39;re all unhappy so I <br/>
stop schooling so we can catch our breath and just live happily.  <br/>
Yet, I always find my way back to curriculum.  I realize this is a <br/>
bad cycle that must be broken.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading my favorite homeschooling book, <br/>
_Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves_ by Alison <br/>
McKee.  I seem to go back to this book whenever I feel a need to be <br/>
inspired yet again about homeschooling.  Every time I read this <br/>
book, I&#39;m reminded of how steeped I am in traditional education.  <br/>
Each time I feel like I&#39;ve finally let it go, only to find myself <br/>
drawn back to it all.  So I guess we&#39;re now back in a deschooling <br/>
mode.  My son and I are thinking about rounding up all the <br/>
curriculum in the house and selling everything we don&#39;t like.  We <br/>
also need a hobby and we&#39;re looking into geocaching.  We&#39;re not big <br/>
outdoor people but my son likes the idea of &#39;treasure&#39; hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this far!<br/>

I agree with your husband totally.<br/>
If a child quitting school would make your life better (regardless of  <br/>
her own feelings), that&#39;s not a good perspective for either of you.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the bright side and how much more time you can spend with  <br/>
your son when she&#39;s in school.  DO things with him, not to lure her  <br/>
home, but because it&#39;s good for the relationship between him and you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d feel better<br/>
about that decision if she loved every day, but she comes home 2 - 3<br/>
days per week in tears because she&#39;s had a bad day. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about that.  Let her decide on her own without pressure.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
Read that, please, and realize that if she&#39;s in school by her own  <br/>
choice that in itself makes her experience there different than it  <br/>
would be if she had no choices.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I look deep<br/>
within myself, I see it&#39;s always me pushing though, and my kids just<br/>

<br/>
Maybe go to google, and browse through some sites about  <br/>
codependency.  It will help you to have that concept in you, and to  <br/>
avoid the pitfalls of your emotional wellbeing being tied up with  <br/>
someone else&#39;s.  And then when you can tell the difference, you can  <br/>
just POUR wellbeing into your family situation so that there&#39;s enough  <br/>
for you and everybody else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-We get to a point where we&#39;re all unhappy so I<br/>
stop schooling so we can catch our breath and just live happily.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Make the happiness your priority, and the other things will fall into  <br/>
place and start working on their own.  If you&#39;re happy, and they&#39;re  <br/>
happy, and calm, and hopeful, then learning will start seeping into  <br/>
all the cracks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Try to forgive the crass analogy, but reading a  book about something  <br/>
you don&#39;t actually then go out and DO is just so much jackoff.     <br/>
You&#39;ve THOUGHT about finally letting it go, and it felt good to  <br/>
fantasize about letting it go, but it was only the mirage of the  <br/>
emotion involved while you were reading.<br/>
<br/>
To move to unschooling you have to seek out and experience natural  <br/>
learning, to the point that you trust it.<br/>
<br/>
To ride a bicycle, you can&#39;t read your favorite book on bicycles, be  <br/>
reminded how steeped you are in walking or driving, and feel like  <br/>
you&#39;ve let them go.  You have to get a bicycle and ride it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I guess we&#39;re now back in a deschooling<br/>
mode. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re in wishful deschooling  <br/>
fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My son and I are thinking about rounding up all the<br/>
curriculum in the house and selling everything we don&#39;t like. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking about it, huh?<br/>
Pack it up and set it aside for a few months. Don&#39;t mess with selling  <br/>
it right now.  Maybe you won&#39;t be able to unschool and you&#39;ll need  <br/>
that stuff.  Let it be there.  Learn not to need it with it still  <br/>
sitting right there (maybe in taped-up boxes put out of the way, but  <br/>
still...).  Don&#39;t waste your valuable deschooling time and energy  <br/>
selling a school materials.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We<br/>
also need a hobby and we&#39;re looking into geocaching.  We&#39;re not big<br/>
outdoor people but my son likes the idea of &#39;treasure&#39; hunting.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need a hobby.  You need to dabble in a hundred hobbies.<br/>

<br/>
Just do it! Especially the teacher&#39;s guides and lesson plans. And if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t sell, donate it to the Goodwill, or to your local homeschooling<br/>
group. I mean don&#39;t stay attached to the financial value of it. <br/>
<br/>
Once the stuff is out of the house think of all the shelf space and head<br/>
space that will be cleared.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m like that about books - I find that reading is very inspiring. I keep a<br/>
book about house keeping techniques around and find that inspiring at times.<br/>
Read Rue&#39;s book and be inspired about how great Unschooling can truly be. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope, I know that.  That&#39;s why I quit talking to her about <br/>
homeschooling.  I told her I support her decisions and will help her <br/>
in any way she needs me.  It just surprised me that&#39;s all.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Codependency is a possibility, however I really love schooly <br/>
things.  I love textbooks and workbooks, crazy as it sounds.  I <br/>
absolutely hate shopping for clothes, shoes, groceries, etc., but I <br/>
can spend hours at a school-supplies store like The School Box and <br/>
Learning Things.  I also love Barnes & Noble, but only the <br/>
children&#39;s and teacher sections.  I loved school through 7th grade.  <br/>
High School began at 8th grade and that&#39;s when I started disliking <br/>
school.  I had some really bad teachers.  They had me believing I <br/>
was a dummy until I was an adult and realized I was pretty smart!  I <br/>
like learning and have been having a great time learning Math, <br/>
History and Grammar alongside my children.  I&#39;ll just continue to do <br/>
it without them, that&#39;s all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really?  I don&#39;t see it that way at all!  If I can only be inspired <br/>
by the things I actually do, I have no hope.  There are many things <br/>
I like to read about that I would have no desire to do either.  For <br/>
example, I like mystery novels but I don&#39;t want to go out and be a <br/>
detective.  I really do believe my children will learn even if I&#39;m <br/>
not using curriculum.  I&#39;m trying to explain things, but writing it <br/>
all out is complicated.  Basically, I end up buying curriculum <br/>
because *I&#39;m* bored and want something to do with my children that <br/>
will be fun and educational.  Yes I realize that sounds stupid but <br/>
that&#39;s the point of being caught in a stupid cycle, which I said I&#39;d <br/>
like to end.  <br/>

&gt; deschooling fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then I&#39;m completely misunderstanding the definition of deschooling.  <br/>
I thought it was letting go of traditional schoolish ideas, and just <br/>
living life.  My son has been making his own choices of what to do.  <br/>
He spends most of his time playing Nintendo (some with me and some <br/>
without me), surfing the &#39;net, watching tv and playing Legos.  He <br/>
also does Math and loves to hear me read aloud.  So what should I do <br/>
to deschool?  or unschool?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just thinking about it, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, we&#39;re *thinking* about it because he&#39;s not sure what he wants <br/>
to keep.  We&#39;ve been busy with the holidays and we just got back <br/>
into town from a trip.  My DH and dd7 are still on vacation from <br/>
work and school so we&#39;re just kicking back and enjoying family <br/>
time.  Most of the stuff I plan to sell hasn&#39;t been used in months <br/>
anyway.  Some of it is in boxes in my closet and some is on a <br/>
bookshelf in my bedroom.  The things we&#39;ve had out are things my son <br/>
chose back in mid-November when I took him out of school again.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to get rid of his Math things, but he would like to <br/>
sell the writing things I&#39;ve had on hand for months.  He&#39;s been <br/>
wanting to read about the Middle Ages and he&#39;d like to sift through <br/>
the things I bought to see what looks interesting.  The whole point <br/>
is that we want to keep anything we find interesting!  Also, my dd7 <br/>
may be in school right now but there are some things that she wants <br/>
to keep as well.  So yes, I think it&#39;s smart to THINK about what <br/>
we&#39;d like to keep and sell.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, quantity isn&#39;t always better than quality!  The last time I let <br/>
someone talk me into doing something to look busy, I earned a Black <br/>
Belt.  That was a lot of money, time and effort and I couldn&#39;t care <br/>
less about the achievement.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I really don&#39;t own that much stuff like that.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
really liked scripted type materials so veered away from them.  I&#39;ve <br/>
already sold all the absolutely horrid stuff, like the boxed <br/>
curriculum materials.  I have some stuff I purchased but didn&#39;t <br/>
think we&#39;d use anytime soon so boxed it up for later.  I think it&#39;s  <br/>
going to be fun opening the boxes and seeing what&#39;s there.  Of <br/>
course, we&#39;re only talking about 2 small boxes.  I don&#39;t have a <br/>
closet full of curriculum.  I&#39;ve been a curriculum junkie since the <br/>
beginning, buying lots of stuff to look through then selling it <br/>
again later.  I rarely keep things around for too long.  I did clear <br/>
off one shelf this evening and found a how-to diagramming workbook I <br/>
totally forgot we had.  My son and I really like diagramming, so <br/>
we&#39;ll be keeping that one.  <br/>

<br/>
A book that you might enjoy is &quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me&quot;, a critique of high<br/>
school History teaching and the textbooks that are used in this country. I<br/>
found it fascinating, and illuminating as someone with almost no knowledge<br/>
of US history outside of the cinema. <br/>
<br/>
By extension the theme that textbooks are probably a lower quality source of<br/>
information about any topic seems useful. My suggestion is to look at<br/>
University reading lists and bibliographies for the topics that interest<br/>
you, rather than school texts (I mean of the kind that are apparently<br/>
recommended with boxed curricula.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget the vivid and wonderful information available to you and your<br/>
kids via the tv - especially the special interest cable/satellite system.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t get stuck in the flip side - an expectation that they will<br/>
continue to learn stuff &quot;without&quot; you. They would, but it would be better if<br/>
you supported their passions actively rather than only by standing back. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh no, I do all I can to support any of my children&#39;s passions.  I <br/>
cannot always buy everything they want but we manage compromises <br/>
most of the time.  For example, my son&#39;s latest passion is watching <br/>
Ebay for Star Wars Lego kits auctions.  Those things are expensive!  <br/>
In the month before Christmas, I spent $150 on 2 Lego kits.  At the <br/>
same time, I was purchasing Christmas gifts (more Lego sets).  Now <br/>
he&#39;s been telling me about some kit that costs $300.  Egads!  :)<br/>
<br/>
But I can only be as active as they&#39;ll allow me to be.  My son <br/>
really doesn&#39;t like involving me too much.  He hates asking for <br/>
help.  We&#39;re trying to help him see it&#39;s not a weakness or a flaw to <br/>
need another person.  I do as much as he lets me.  My daughter has <br/>
been the same way.  Even when she demanded that I teach her how to <br/>
read, she really meant for me to sit quietly while she figured it <br/>
out.  And that&#39;s exactly what we did!<br/>
<br/>
So yes, I&#39;m here when they need me.  Thanks for the book <br/>
recommendation as well.  To be honest, I don&#39;t recall learning much <br/>
History in high school.  I vaguely recall a Civics class because I <br/>
remember playing a Jeopardy like game in the classroom.  I don&#39;t <br/>
remember any History at all.  That&#39;s one reason I&#39;ve thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed reading History alongside the kids.  It&#39;s like I&#39;m seeing <br/>
these things for the first time.<br/>
