<br/>
Oooops! LOL Go to the head of the class, my pet LOL<br/>
<br/>
sorry about that, Tia...I&#39;ve been so busy these days, I&#39;m barely <br/>
peeking in here, and didn&#39;t see your post about proofreading until <br/>
this morning...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve passed on the phone numbers and fax numbers and URL for CBS. I&#39;d <br/>
write to them, myself, except I didn&#39;t see the program and never have <br/>
been one to jump on a bandwagon based on others&#39; opinions. I&#39;m sure <br/>
it was VERY ugly. <br/>
<br/>
I hope the feedback accomplishes something.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

(hoping this will actually get through)</div>

 </span></blockquote>You can read it online.  Just go to www.cbs.com  It was on the evening <br/>
news. The first segment was on our Canadian Thanksgiving, and I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to upset all the unschoolers (my family and my daughter&#39;s) by having it <br/>
on.  So I read it on the website and then responded.<br/>
