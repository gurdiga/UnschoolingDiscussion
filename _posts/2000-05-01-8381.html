<div id="ygrps-yiv-922956327">To Mook&#39;s mom...<br/>
<br/>
I am so sympathetic. I too have a 3yob, and he just had conjunctivitis, and <br/>
we had to go through the whole thing with the drops too. Argh!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I would just squeeze a few drops on there without even warning him <br/>
about it. I always do all this on the changing table so I keep the drops <br/>
handy and just do it before changing a diaper.<br/>
<br/>
Three-year-olds want to be in control of themselves so I have found that <br/>
other times it helps to offer limited options. I would say, &#39;Point to the <br/>
eye you want the drops in first. Did I get it in there? Should I put more <br/>
here? Would you like to try squeezing the bottle yourself?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I found that you actually don&#39;t need to get much of the liquid into the eye <br/>
for it to work. The general vicinity of the eyelid is good. Also, I often <br/>
used probably six or eight drops to get one close enough.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it is important to treat conjunctivitis because besides being <br/>
really uncomfortable, it is quite contagious. Whenever one of mine gets it, <br/>
I do too. So far, I have managed to keep it from spreading between the kids <br/>
with stringent hand-washing and treating ASAP. I guess I catch  it from the <br/>
snuggles, can&#39;t help myself...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555036906">I used breastmilk for conjunctivitis several times with great sucess. On one<br/>
occasion there was a very nasty viral version being passed around and I even<br/>
used breastmilk in my husband&#39;s eyes! He said it was the only thing that didn&#39;t<br/>
sting like hell.<br/>
<br/>
But 15 years ago, one night well after dark there was a knock at the door. A<br/>
woman I knew, but wasn&#39;t particularly friends with, was at the door. She held<br/>
out a small bottle and said &#39;I know you breastfeed, so could you please express<br/>
some into here, my son has conjunctivitis.&#39; I was so stunned by the confident<br/>
assumption in her voice, I did it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
