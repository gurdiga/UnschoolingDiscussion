<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928882563">I just sat down to read my emails from the weekend and haven&#39;t read past Joyce&#39;s comments because I just had to stop and make a few myself<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some people --<br/>
&gt;people who were &quot;taught&quot; to spell in school -- can&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How true.  as I stated before in a message, my ds was  an A student because we worked at MEMORIZING  the words.  Not because he knew how too spell.  One teacher told me he would probably never be a good speller because if a child is going to be a good speller it happens at the beginning - they either spell good or they don&#39;t.  Another teacher told me that he&#39;s not a good speller because he never ABSORBED the phonics of spelling, that anybody can spell good if the phonics are taught EARLY.  Well, in my opinion he doesn&#39;t spell because he doesn&#39;t yet see the importance of doing it.  He is 14 and still spells the way words sound.  That doesn&#39;t bother him and FINALLY it doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But what&#39;s the rush? What great enhancement to their joy &gt;in life will they<br/>
&gt;have if they enter college at 15 instead of 18 (or 20 or &gt;25)? Is it a<br/>
&gt;competition to get as many work years in as possible &gt;before retirement<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At our church there are a couple of kids graduating from public High School this year.  I ask one of the boys what he planned to do afterwards and he siad,  &quot;:Well, I guess I&#39;ll go to college&quot;  I asked what he planned to major in and he said &quot; I think math and my mionr will be religion&quot;  I said &quot;oh, that&#39;s interesting what are you palnning to do with that when you finish?  Teach?&quot;  He said, &quot;Oh, Gosh no, I don&#39;t know what I want to do yet.  Math is just something that I like and thought would be easy and studying religion is just something I thought I might gst a kick out of.&quot;  <br/>
I know of several young peoiple who have gone into college right after HS then come out and do something entirely different with their lives while paying off the debt of student loans for studying something that means NOTHING to them now!  DOES THIS MAKE SOME KIND OF SENSE THAT I MISSED??? <br/>
I don&#39;t care if my son goes to college or not!! I do care that he will be able to do something with his life that makes him happy.  If that means college in order to achieve that then I&#39;ll do all I can to help him.  If it means Technical school, so be  it.  Whatever!  But to go to college just for the sake of going to college, to me is a gross waste of time, money and INTELLIGENCE!.<br/>
  High Schools do not teach children to think for themselves.  They are not allowed to reason anything outside of a textbook.  Some are not ready, academically OR mature enough , to take on deciding what they&#39;re going to do with the rest of their lives.  They&#39;ve never been allowed to think about what they REALLY want  to do.  Only what&#39;s EXPECTED of them.<br/>
<br/>
What joy is there in being young if you are in college by the ripe old age of 15 and by the time you finish you&#39;re BARELY old enough to enter the work force.  Seems to me they going to miss some really great years when they could have been KIDS!<br/>

Same here.  Heck, if it&#39;s free, live there!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;One is taught to strive to get into a good college and they work toward <br/>
that, when deep down inside what they really want to do doesn&#39;t REQUIRE 4 <br/>
years of college.  Am I making myself clear on what I&#39;m trying to say?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems clear to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this the horrible dilemma of a lot of literature of the past 200 years?<br/>
Someone whose family expects them to go to college would be a failure if he <br/>
just declared up front that he really wants to be a bicycle repairman, or a <br/>
sculptor.  The family would still probably press for him to take engineering <br/>
or fine arts, and he would be four years behind schedule AND thousands of <br/>
dollars in debt just for doing what &quot;is always done.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
College doesn&#39;t have such a sterline reputation anyway.  It&#39;s where lots of <br/>
people have gone and met their first drug dealers, con artists, abusers.  <br/>
Also where many have met the loves of their lives (human or philosophical), <br/>
and their first mentors and greatest books and ideas.  It&#39;s hard for young <br/>
women now to realize to what extent in the not so distant past teenaged girls <br/>
were sent to college to get married.  &quot;Getting her &#39;MRS&#39; degree&quot; was common <br/>
into the 1960&#39;s and might still be common.  Lots of girls were expected to <br/>
drop out once they were engaged, since they weren&#39;t going to work anyway, but <br/>
that way they had met a college boy instead of a hometown future-grocer.<br/>

Some people do go to college without realizing what they want to <br/>
do.  Many of the people that go to college see it as big party.  <br/>
Many of them cut loose and party until they realize they have to <br/>
start studying if they want to stay in college.  Then many of them <br/>
realize it is like highschool all over, there are many require <br/>
courses to take such math, writing, english, history, ect.  You also <br/>
get a governmental isolated point of view on many of the subjects of <br/>
colleges, such as history,sociology, business and others.  This <br/>
turns into a moral issue for some people, where college is no longer <br/>
what they are seeking.  When people start to realize that many of <br/>
there opinions are not taken inconsideration, they are back to <br/>
square one.  College is not for everyone.  some people perfer to go <br/>
to trade schools, where they can learn occupation without the extra <br/>
courses. <br/>
<br/>
Then there is the group that goes to college and enjoys the whole <br/>
experience.  Some of them move on to have what they call productive <br/>
live, others realize that they took a different turn than what they <br/>
desired.  <br/>

<br/>
What it isn&#39;t -- but what society kind of suggests that it is -- is an<br/>
*automatic* stepping stone to a successful career. Kids enter thinking all<br/>
they have to do is get into a good college, study whatever degree is easiest<br/>
or leads to &quot;good jobs&quot; and they&#39;re set for life.<br/>
<br/>
People were just trying to get you to question the validity of the thought<br/>
process that led you to say:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My first two<br/>
&gt; entered college at 15 and I just can&#39;t see that happening with the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>*But* I can see where I misread that. You questioned how your *first 2*<br/>
could do what they wanted and enter college at 15, *not* how the next teen<br/>
or the younger ones were going to accomplish this.<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s perfectly possible they could have. If that was their desire,<br/>
there&#39;s no reason they couldn&#39;t have taken community college courses, gotten<br/>
a tutor, found resources to learn on their own, pursued various community<br/>
projects, volunteer work, paid work to gain experience in the fields they<br/>
wanted to go into.<br/>
<br/>
For instance your creative writing daughter could have offered classes to<br/>
homeschoolers or kids in the community, written articles about homeschooling<br/>
(or creative writing or whatever) for the local paper. Your youth minister<br/>
son could have done scounting, charity work, manned a hot line.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe they did do that.)<br/>
<br/>
What particular areas do you think a college would have found them lacking<br/>
in had they unschooled? We can probably give you some ideas on how they<br/>
might have pusued them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400272508">&lt;&lt;It&#39;s quite joyful when they&#39;re doing it on their own.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
I think these things are in response to someone worrying because one child <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to college at 15, when someone else did.  And from people saying <br/>
if you couldn&#39;t spell and write well you couldn&#39;t go to college (or whatever <br/>
all was said).<br/>
<br/>
I went at 16, from choice, and did have a great time, and did know what I <br/>
wanted to accomplish with a degree, and went and did that at the age of 21.  <br/>
Most of the people I was in school with then were there because their parents <br/>
wanted them to be, had gone 2000 miles from home just to get away from their <br/>
parents, were wasting their parents&#39; money not going to class, and didn&#39;t <br/>
know what they wanted to study or do with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Sounds to me that you all are blasting college.  I just don&#39;t see it being<br/>
that bad.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s bad about it is when people go for no good reason, or when parents use <br/>
it to make them do things, use it as a lure, and a boogey-man.  &quot;You have to <br/>
do book reports so you can get into college&quot; or &quot;If you&#39;re good and &#39;finish <br/>
this homeschooling&#39; you can go to college!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And shaming a kid who says &quot;I want to work at the video store for a while and <br/>
maybe to to college later&quot; isn&#39;t the greatest thing for parents to do.  MANY <br/>
families press kids to go to college whether the kids actually want to or <br/>
not.  Or the kids have gathered over the years that their lives are leading <br/>
toward that as a goal.  And college itself shouldn&#39;t be a goal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467262671">&lt;What joy is there in being young if you are in college by the ripe old age<br/>
of 15 and by the time you finish you&#39;re BARELY old enough to enter the work<br/>
force.  Seems to me they going to miss some really great years when they<br/>
could have been KIDS!&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite joyful when they&#39;re doing it on their own.  I think all of you<br/>
are misunderstanding me.....They CHOSE to go to college at that age and I<br/>
didn&#39;t stand in their way.  My son is planning on being a youth<br/>
minister...he already knows that and is working towards that end with his<br/>
degree.  My daughter wants to teach creative writing classes to<br/>
homeschoolers....she&#39;s also working towards that end.  She also plans to<br/>
homeschool her children when she marries and has them!!! :), and is<br/>
convinced that&#39;s the best option for education.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me that you all are blasting college.  I just don&#39;t see it being<br/>
that bad.  And btw, they both have jobs and incomes right now at 17 and 18,<br/>
and have been working since they were at the &quot;ripe old age&quot; of 15.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; But to go to college just for the sake of going to college, to me is a <br/>
&gt; gross<br/>
&gt; &gt; waste of time, money and INTELLIGENCE!.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids go just for the sake of going to college though (meaning they don&#39;t <br/>
know what they want to do, yet) - because they think of college as an <br/>
AMAZINGLY rich environment filled with interesting things and people who are <br/>
passionate about all kinds of stuff and willing to SHARE that with an <br/>
interested kid. My oldest daughter came home one day, when she was about 14, <br/>
and said, &quot;I just can&#39;t BELIEVE there are all these PEOPLE there who know so <br/>
much and they are getting PAID to share it with students.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Since then she&#39;s run into a few bad teachers - but really, for the most part, <br/>
she&#39;s had incredibly good teachers who inspired her and really have passions <br/>
and are there to share them. AND - this is a community college. It costs $11 <br/>
per unit for an 18-week semester. A typical class is three units - so it is <br/>
typically $33 for each class. Full-time attendance  - 12 or 15 units would be <br/>
well under $200 per semester, so we&#39;re not talking about big bucks.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has spent a year and a half on a debate team - that was a <br/>
WONDERFUL and challenging experience. She has been in two different vocal <br/>
performance groups - jazz and musical theater. She designed lighting for a <br/>
dance concert and ran the light board for a number of plays and other <br/>
performances. She&#39;s had her mural photographs displayed at a Laguna Beach <br/>
gallery. She&#39;s taken 8 semesters of ceramics, gotten a good job because of <br/>
her ceramics expertise and twice been invited to the home of Paul Soldner <br/>
(known as the Father of American Raku). All of these opportunities came about <br/>
because of going to community college. <br/>
<br/>
There are so many opportunities on our college campus - and we have a little <br/>
tiny not-particularly-spectacular community college. My second daughter is <br/>
now just getting involved there - she is learning website design and computer <br/>
programming from a man who is a GREAT teacher - she&#39;s thrilled with his <br/>
ability to help her &quot;get&quot; things that she&#39;s read but not thoroughly <br/>
understood. She has an opera class - learning about opera, not performing it <br/>
- from a young woman who sings opera herself and gets her students lots of <br/>
discounted tickets to all kinds of musicals and operas and other singing <br/>
performances. We saw &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; a few weeks ago at the Los Angeles <br/>
Music Center and we have tickets for Camelot in a couple of weeks. Also, her <br/>
beginning voice class is collaborating with a sound recording class to make a <br/>
class cd. She is having a GREAT time!!<br/>

can&#39;t afford it.<br/>
<br/>
My girls want to go eventually, but they are in no rush.  If yours are <br/>
going now because they want to, that&#39;s great.  I think it would have <br/>
been a mistake for Rachel to go earlier.  She talked about it a few <br/>
times but never pursued it enough to make it happen.  Looking back, I <br/>
think that was a good thing.  She&#39;s had time to learn to deal with her <br/>
depression without any extra pressure.<br/>
<br/>
So what kind of jobs do your have?  Rachel is looking right now but <br/>
she is kind of picky so it&#39;s taking a little time.<br/>

learning that occurs in college.  I had to pay for it myself.  The <br/>
difference in my attitude from high school to college was drastic.  <br/>

It&#39;s possible she had built up some frustrations and resentments.  Those will <br/>
come out somehow, someday, and blaming her for it doesn&#39;t seem mature or <br/>
realistic.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe she&#39;s just immature (not a crime), inconsistent (most people are, <br/>
if you look at them from all angles), and perhaps the two of you haven&#39;t <br/>
discovered a good means of intercommunication with which she can get her <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - being immature is a part of the process of maturing, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;ve been imposing structure (in terms of education, I mean) on the kid <br/>
her whole life and then suddenly you&#39;ve relaxed it and you&#39;re surprised when <br/>
the kid makes little progress in the areas that were previously being <br/>
imposed? Or not surprised, but unhappy?<br/>
<br/>
It was predictable. Not sure what you expected or why you expected something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d separate learning issues from interpersonal (attitude) issues. <br/>

yours just need to vent it a bit.<br/>
 <br/>
As for mine, her name is Jenni BTW, she is the middle child.  Both her <br/>
older sister and younger brother have had some rather serious problems <br/>
this past year and I&#39;ve had health problems too.  She has been a saint <br/>
through most of it and now she says it&#39;s her turn to be the bitch.  <br/>
I&#39;ll let a lot of it go for a while because she is right.  She&#39;s been <br/>
handling way more than her share and now she needs this.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think being a bitch is necessarily a quality I would want her <br/>
to keep, but I understand why she needs it right now and I know she <br/>
will outgrow it if we give her some space.<br/>
