<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026910613">I&#39;ve been noticing lately that my daughter will not pick out books at<br/>
the library.  She usually doesn&#39;t want to go and tries to hurry me out<br/>
of there when we do go.  I reserve a lot of books (for both of us) and<br/>
always have another list of books I want to search for.  For the most<br/>
part, she stays uninvolved.<br/>
<br/>
When the books are at home, I put them in her room and at night (usually<br/>
after I go to bed) she often stays up quite late reading a book from<br/>
cover to cover.  Some she rejects (which is just fine with me).  In the<br/>
morning, we talk about what she&#39;s read, the ones she liked and the ones<br/>
she didn&#39;t.  Most of the time, she&#39;s very enthusiastic about what a good<br/>
book she just read.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering if I should stop getting her books, in hopes that<br/>
she&#39;ll start looking for herself.  I can&#39;t even imagine not wanting to<br/>
pick books out for myself.  On the other hand, I hate messing up a<br/>
mostly good thing.    Now that I&#39;ve written this, I&#39;m wondering how<br/>
other kids hear about good books and how they make their choices.  I<br/>
really doubt any of her friends are telling her about good books they&#39;ve<br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
It just occurred to me that she&#39;s much  more likely to look for a book<br/>
(or several) she wants at a bookstore.  Maybe it&#39;s the layout of the<br/>
library versus a bookstore, most of  the chapter books are shelved so<br/>
you can&#39;t see the covers.  It&#39;s really not very browser friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear ideas or how your kids select their books.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are only in our second year of homeschooling too.  My daughter will be 11 in March.  It is my belief that she is so sick of reading, from school, that she refuses.  She honestly refuses anything to do with anything that might be &quot;learning&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
She will sit for hours tho, and listen to me read to her. We spend about 2 hours every night before bed reading, me aloud, then her sister aloud (she is 8 and has never been to school) and I have lately asked that Emily read.  I told her it&#39;s nice for me to be read to also.  She chose Black Beauty.  She has asked to read for longer, has admitted to loving this book, but still refuses to read on her own.<br/>
<br/>
She enjoys reading the book aloud. But still prefers to be read to.  Where as her sister is frustrated because she can&#39;t read completely on her own yet.  It is funny, Emily, who went to school, still tends to read in a monotone.  Ellen, who never went uses many inflections, laughs while she reads, comments on what will happen....<br/>
<br/>
I think we are making baby steps though.  She will now occasionally choose a book from the library.  usually one that she knows her sister will enjoy--or at least that&#39;s what she says.  :)  She has also decided that she loves the Little House Books and has them all ready for me to read in order.  <br/>
<br/>
I think, Carolyn, if what you are doing works, keep at it.  I have picked out books to read aloud that I remember enjoying and she has enjoyed them also...that&#39;s how we started on Little House...and Black Beauty too.  I know someday, I am not going to be able to read enough to her and she will take over in impatience.  i will joyously let her!<br/>
<br/>
I also find that both of them rarely discuss what we have read right away, but later, sometimes weeks later, it comes up...I don&#39;t even realize I am holding my breath until I exhale at those comments!  So, for now, this works...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julian, on his own in a bookstore, will almost always choose a Star Wars <br/>
novel or, for a long time (until they were completed), Animorphs.  They were <br/>
Safe. However, his favorite books seem to be the ones I hear about (or have <br/>
read before) and suggest. So he&#39;ll often ask me to find some things for him <br/>
to look at. He&#39;ll check out a pile and choose the ones that interest him. <br/>
<br/>
I just asked, and he has no idea what that&#39;s about...maybe the same reason <br/>
we&#39;ll often look for a book we&#39;ve read about or a friend has recommended if <br/>
we&#39;re looking for a &quot;new&quot; book. (Then there are the authors/series we ALWAYS <br/>
read--for us several mystery authors we almost always buy in hardcover <br/>
because we can&#39;t wait for the paperback)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239731064">We go to the library, used book stores and library sales with bags in hand.<br/>
I turn the kidlets loose.  They run back and forth from the section they are<br/>
interested in to the section I am in.  They haul books and ask what I think<br/>
of thus and such.  I give them an honest answer.  Or if it is something I<br/>
don&#39;t think is appropriate to their age level or understanding level, I will<br/>
tell them and let them decide from there.<br/>
<br/>
Last week we took several back that youngest didn&#39;t read because they just<br/>
weren&#39;t at her reading level, well not so much ability to read as being too<br/>
dry/boring more textbook sort of thing.  When we dropped them off she looked<br/>
at me really seriously and said,&quot;those were I told you so books.&quot;  Then when<br/>
I looked confused she burst out laughing and said &quot;if you were that lady we<br/>
saw here last time you would be saying I told you so.&quot;  And away she went to<br/>
get another bag of books.  She&#39;s quite the card &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Carolyn&gt;&gt;<br/>
My youngest dd is 9 1/2. She&#39;s been reading confidently for about 4 months or so. One day she told me that she&#39;d decided that it was time that she read chapter books. She picked up _Baby_ by Patricia MacLaughlin and was up really late reading it. She told me that the really cool thing about reading to herself is if she doesn&#39;t understand something, she can read it again, and then not only does she understand the first question, she learns something new. <br/>
 She decided that she was going to read all the books by Patricia MacLaughlin. She noticed similarities in the characters in several books. She reads the books first, then passes them on to me and then we talk about them.  She&#39;s now reading Janet Taylor Lisle books on her own, and we&#39;ve been reading The Chronicles of NArnia together.<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure how she decides what to read--it just kind of happens<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Usually by the cover.  The more creepy, ghastly and gruesome it is the<br/>
better.  Now, sometimes by the Author, if he liked another book. <br/>
Anything horror or sci-fi. Anything Japanese animation. If they&#39;re awful<br/>
he just stacks them up and looks at the covers.  He&#39;s nine and there&#39;s<br/>
just no point even picking up a book if it doesn&#39;t have a cool cover. <br/>

It&#39;s sad sad sad, not because it&#39;s odd but because it is horribly normal. <br/>
Schools are unfortunately very very very good at taking little kids with big <br/>
curiosities and mushing them into big kids who hate reading, especially <br/>
reading aloud. Schools also mush kids into thinking they hate learning (while <br/>
of course they&#39;re still learning plenty of things as long as they&#39;re not <br/>
identified as *learning* and nobody is trying to make them).<br/>
<br/>
Parents Who Love Reading, Kids who Don&#39;t by Mary Leonhardt is about how <br/>
schools screw up kids with reading, and what you can do about it. Great book. <br/>
