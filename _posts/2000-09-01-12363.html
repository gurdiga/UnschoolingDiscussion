<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree with BOnnie, and someone else that 
mentioned their support of this idea.It really has been turned around. I was 
always taught that it meant everyone helps everyone else, that is in their 
village or community.......not that it meant that the parents are out working 
too hard to know their own children, and the village or community(i.e. schools) 
took care of them for them.&nbsp; My philosophy on this topic is that we build 
our own villages of family&nbsp; &amp; friends, and they are in fact also 
teachers of&nbsp; us &amp; our children..as we ,adults &amp; children , alike, 
also are teachers of them &amp; theirs.and that we are all learning everyday 
from the people we trust &amp; care about.&nbsp; SO this would be a &quot;it takes a 
village to raise a child&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mentality, that I am proud of as 
these people I have chosen to be in our lives are there for a reason.&nbsp; They 
model our values, and they care for us.&nbsp; </font></div>
