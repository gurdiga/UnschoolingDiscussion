<div id="ygrps-yiv-802256618">***Christopher read this last night and today he went spider hunting. ***<br/>
<br/>
We made frames out of lath and put them on stakes in  different places in<br/>
the garden and yard.  Spiders moved in right away and built beautiful<br/>
webs. <br/>
<br/>
If you put a little box or hollowed out chunk of wood on the frame the<br/>
spiders like it better.  They have someplace to get out of the rain and<br/>
hide from predators.   The frames can be any shape, spiders don&#39;t seem to<br/>
care.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
You can put them in good lighting for picture taking, but they need to be<br/>
a little sheltered from wind. <br/>
