Trying to overcome that would be a huge step toward understanding unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dont see that as something to overcome.   Kids are not &quot;little adults&quot;   Of <br/>
course as my children get older, I  show much less restraint concerning <br/>
&quot;adult&quot;topics.   At the risk of  getting slammed ( which I know is probably <br/>
coming), I must say, I  think some topics are inappropiate for children to be <br/>
exposed to.   My husband and I maybe out for dinner and drinks with another <br/>
couple, and the conversations turns to sex, or we may discuss an R rated <br/>
movie that we have seen recently.  I may have a heart to heart talk with a <br/>
girlfriend or sister about marital problems.   I may discuss concerns for <br/>
over my childrens behavior with another mother.   My husband and I may <br/>
discuss financial or work related problems or here again, sex.   I may act <br/>
like I aint got no sense when I am playing with my children or in my own home <br/>
goofing off and being silly.. But if I am in church, or a meeting, I dont <br/>
behave that way.    Don&#39;t we all adjust our behavior to the situation and <br/>
circumstances that we are in?  <br/>

<br/>
No, kids aren&#39;t little adults, but they&#39;re people.<br/>
<br/>
Rain and I have been going out to dinner after Carousel some nights with<br/>
the cast. None of the other kids come, probably because the show ends at<br/>
11:15 p.m.. There&#39;s some risque conversation, lots of discussions lately<br/>
about theater politics and zoning, some swearing (and occasionally the<br/>
person will then say &quot;oops&quot; and cover her ears, but it&#39;s a joke). She<br/>
listens a lot and talks some, and she also always sits next to the 22 yr<br/>
old who plays her oldest brother and enjoys goofing with her. <br/>
<br/>
We do adjust our behavior for different situations, but having kids<br/>
around doesn&#39;t tend to define the situation. <br/>
