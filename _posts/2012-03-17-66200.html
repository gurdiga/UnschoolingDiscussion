<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991444289">Yes, Glenda & thank you Pam!<br/>
I had an ah-ha moment from this food limiting thread that came to me about<br/>
the baby proofing in our house-Eli&#39;s almost 3 & a half & we still have the<br/>
stove protecters & toilet lock on. Although he knows how to operate both<br/>
appliances safely, i&#39;ve been reluctant to take off the locks &quot;for his<br/>
safety&quot; (& my convenience, honestly) but I think, after reading this<br/>
thread, that perhaps the time for those &quot;limits&quot; has passed.<br/>
Thank you!!!<br/>
<br/>
I always learn something unexpected here!<br/>

Pam said-<br/>
&quot;Kids can learn about foods and their own needs and safety and health the<br/>
same way they learn to be safe in the out-of-doors or in a kitchen or near<br/>
a lake. Maybe try to consider it that way. Give them opportunities to<br/>
learn.<br/>
Too much restriction, control, and limiting is counterproductive to<br/>
helping them learn. Conventional parenting does a LOT of controlling and<br/>
limiting - often so much that it results in<br/>
serious shut-downs of learning processes and creates resistance or apathy<br/>
in the developing child..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eli&#39;s been expressing resistance to toilet & potty use, maybe taking the<br/>
lock off will have a positive effect....<br/>
