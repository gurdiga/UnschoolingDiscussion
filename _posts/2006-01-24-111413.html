 </span></blockquote>1) For every 2 year old carrying plates to the sink there&#39;s tens of  <br/>
thousands who aren&#39;t ;-) But you don&#39;t hear the moms of kids who  <br/>
aren&#39;t doing it mentioning that they aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
2)  At 2 or 3 kids often get a kick out of being competent at things  <br/>
bigger people do. The novelty of it wears off.<br/>
<br/>
3) You can often train kids to do as they&#39;re told. The fundamentalist  <br/>
Christians have lots of books on such things. It involves convincing  <br/>
the kid they should be terrified not to do what you tell them. Is  <br/>
that the kind of relationship you want?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends what kind of relationship you want with them. If you want to  <br/>
be their partner, you&#39;re going to work against that by making them do  <br/>
things they don&#39;t understand and aren&#39;t competent at.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can&#39;t understand in the way adults do why things need to be put  <br/>
away so basically it&#39;s similar to your husband making you scrub the  <br/>
ceiling every week.<br/>
<br/>
Kids aren&#39;t as competent at organizing as it seems they are. If you  <br/>
look at the worst mess in your house and then magnify it by 10 rooms  <br/>
that might be approaching what a kid sees when they see a pile of  <br/>
toys. It isn&#39;t important and it&#39;s overwhelming.<br/>

  My 2 year old does take her plate to the sink after a meal, but not always. She&#39;s just heard me ask..pretty much every night..for everyone to do so. Usually it&#39;s just a &quot;hey guys, let&#39;s not forget to take our plates to the sink when we&#39;re done.&quot; Overall my children are pretty good about cleaning up. Oh..I will say this, pretty much without fail, Gracie empties her &quot;pee-pot&quot; when she uses her potty chair. She just does it, but she hasn&#39;t been asked to! <br/>
   <br/>
  We don&#39;t require any chores around here, but I&#39;m constantly saying &quot;Please help me pick up&quot; and we&#39;ve had talks about how we all live here, and it&#39;s up to all of us to help keep the house looking nice. Sometimes they aren&#39;t in the mood to help. Sometimes I&#39;m not in the mood to BE helped! But I think we do pretty good.<br/>
   <br/>
  I don&#39;t think you&#39;re being lazy to pick up after them at all. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401979891">My son is 5 1/2 yo and my daughter is 13 m most of what gets accomplished<br/>
around the house is achieved together. We sort the laundry - one picks the<br/>
color and then we race around the house finding that color of clothing, he<br/>
helps me put them in, take them out, fold (well he hands them to me and<br/>
helps keep his sister away from the folded laundry).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He vacuums. I have a little Shark Vac that is just his size and he thinks it<br/>
is fun but if he doesn&#39;t want to do it then I do it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He washes dishes - though only gets to do the none breakables and makes a<br/>
huge water mess that leads to us washing the kitchen floor.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He takes dishes left in the living room to the kitchen (though usually just<br/>
to keep them away from his sister) and when reminded he takes his own and<br/>
puts them in the sink or the table or the counter.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He plays &quot;Treasurer Hunter&quot; with a flashlight and cleans out from under the<br/>
sofas in the living room.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When he has an accident in his pants he cleans or when he makes a mess he at<br/>
least helps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now this has been a progression of games and offers (on his side). He is a<br/>
very helpful child and loves cleaning but it is like everything else you<br/>
teach your child. He has to have a need or desire to learn and you can&#39;t<br/>
expect him to know how to do it the right way or to want to do it your way.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the original question was whether it would be better to  <br/>
&quot;take the trouble&quot; to try to force a child, or train a child, to &quot;do  <br/>
housework.&quot;<br/>
Let them figure it out gradually.<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling works with reading, and math, and science and  <br/>
history.<br/>
That&#39;s how unschooling can work with all kinds of learning.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-------------------<br/>
<br/>
Very good point.<br/>
<br/>
The expectation that kids will do what they&#39;re capable of doing  <br/>
reminds me of the heartbreak MANY kids experience when they &quot;learn to  <br/>
read.&quot;   They learn to read &quot;Hop on Pop&quot; so the parents stop reading  <br/>
to them.   There&#39;s an ocean between one-syllable &quot;reading&quot; of books  <br/>
with only 27 words and what parents could read to a child, but many  <br/>
thousands of kids (probably millions) have been cut off cold when  <br/>
they learn to read.  It&#39;s almost a punishment.   Add that to the long  <br/>
list of why pressing reading is bad, and why expecting kids to read  <br/>
as soon as possible (while parents are not being analytical about  <br/>
what reading really is) will cause more trouble than good.<br/>
<br/>
And so with housework.  If a child shows that he can pick up dirty  <br/>
clothes and put them in a basket, has he earned the total loss of his  <br/>
mother&#39;s help from there on out?<br/>
When he makes his first messy peanut butter and jelly sandwich, is he  <br/>
doomed to have to make his own from then on?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do that to your kids.<br/>
<br/>
I can pump gas, but I don&#39;t expect to *have* to do it until Keith  <br/>
can&#39;t do it for me anymore.<br/>
Keith can do laundry, but he doesn&#39;t expect to *have* to, because I  <br/>
do it better and more happily than he does.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is capable of doing his laundry, but I do it for him so he has  <br/>
more time to hang out with friends and play video games.  He learns  <br/>
more from doing that than he would from doing laundry.  This  <br/>
afternoon Holly and I went and bought him a black wool cap and a  <br/>
thermal shirt, because he was cold at work today, and is getting a  <br/>
sore throat and a cough.  I paid for those things.  It&#39;s for his job,  <br/>
and I *could* have told him to buy them, or to pay me back.  But he&#39;s  <br/>
learning from having that job, and it&#39;s good exercise, and these are  <br/>
clothes he&#39;ll wear when he&#39;s not at work too, and I don&#39;t see why he  <br/>
should have to pay EVERYthing now just because he has a job.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow he will be warmer.<br/>
<br/>
Years from now he will more calmly and generously go out and get  <br/>
something for someone else without feeling martyrly or put-upon or  <br/>
taken-advantage-of, because he will think that&#39;s just how people  <br/>
should be, and just how parents should be, and just how friends  <br/>
should be.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t send him the bill financially OR emotionally or socially.   <br/>
He looks good in that hat.  He will get well more easily, being warm.<br/>
<br/>
I also made a chicken and green chile casserole because I thought  <br/>
that would help him get well.  I also heated the hot tub for him, and  <br/>
he was in the hot tub when Holly and I went to buy him clothes.<br/>
<br/>
All that is a bigger version of helping a toddler put dishes in the  <br/>
sink, and helping a young child pick up laundry, and clean her room.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel the least bit lazy.<br/>
<br/>

I just reread that and had no idea what I meant ;-) But I think I  <br/>
meant they&#39;re looking at a pile of stuff mom wants picked up and it&#39;s  <br/>
overwhelming and they have no clue why it&#39;s important to mom. It just  <br/>
seems ridiculous to do something so difficult that makes no sense.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was wondering how much your little  ones could/do/did as far as <br/>
picking up after themselves, and what might be  reasonable at what age.<br/>
I have been reading a lot about families, even  unschoolers, who say <br/>
their three year olds help set the table every day  and their two year <br/>
olds always bring their plates over to the sink after  eating. <br/>
I&#39;m starting to worry that I&#39;m not expecting or asking enough out  of <br/>
my kids. &gt;&gt;<br/>
I know people that have children like this and the process it took for  them <br/>
to get there is not even close to unschooling. Every day? Oh boy!<br/>
Not that I am anti helping I just don&#39;t see it as a priority to keep  <br/>
repeating &quot;put your plate in the sink&quot; for days or weeks. Sure my kids have been  <br/>
known to put their plates in the sink including my 22 mo old but I don&#39;t think I  <br/>
have ever asked them to. <br/>
 <br/>
My 6 yr old sets the table here and there but it&#39;s her choice and she likes  <br/>
to pretend she&#39;s serving. This week she created a menu for my husband  and I <br/>
for our anniversary. She worked on it for a few days including setting the  <br/>
table and she asked for flowers when we went shopping. If I made a table  <br/>
clearing/setting a rule I doubt she would have created the dining out  atmosphere, <br/>
bothered to create a menu or even come close to the time she spent  on making <br/>
our day special. She also knows that we respect her as an important  member and <br/>
part of our anniversary celebration. When we celebrate or wedding  date we <br/>
have made a tradition of including all the kids weather we go to a hotel  or dine <br/>
out they come. I&#39;ve had people comment but in the end my husband and I  get <br/>
the time we need alone and that day was after all the day our daughter was  <br/>
created (TMI but a conversation in our home the past few weeks &quot;How did you and  <br/>
daddy make me?&quot;)  Sorry got off track....:)<br/>
<br/>
******************************************************************************<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Am  I being lazy by often picking up my kids&#39; toys and clothes for <br/>
them, or  doing it with them? &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My house is jam packed full of toys including outside and often something  <br/>
needs stepping over. Heck Monday Nicholas (3) was riding a bike from the tv room <br/>
 to his bedroom (his room that he doesn&#39;t sleep in so additional room full  <br/>
of toys:). The squeak of that little radio flyer bike and the toys he kept  <br/>
running into or knocking over was distracting as I was on the phone with a new  <br/>
unschool mom and trying to listen.. When I got off the phone he was working on  <br/>
his bike and using the rear tire as a launch for whatever little item he <br/>
could  find. I thought for a second about the mess he made but then was more <br/>
impressed  with his creativity. Cameron (22mo) held the dust pan (his new phase of <br/>
growth  and independence) while I swept and he walked to the kitchen to dump. <br/>
It  was a bit of a wait while he was going back and forth but after all it&#39;s <br/>
why I  unschool. They are learning by living and those are happier ways to get  <br/>
things done for us :) My house isn&#39;t as tidy as it could be but I don&#39;t put  <br/>
clutter before fun bc I know I will get to it and I do..<br/>
 <br/>
I pick up clothes for everyone equally including my husband.. <br/>
Your not being lazy (let those feelings of pressure go) you are placing  more <br/>
value in life than nagging and that&#39;s wonderful!<br/>
******************************************************************************<br/>
************<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Are my expectations for what my kids are <br/>
capable of too  low?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight,<br/>
Jenny&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know that I would even use the word expectation as it (to me)  sounds <br/>
too close to *rule,failure or even comparing to another for equality and  <br/>
balance... That&#39;s too much pressure and less flow of who you and they are.<br/>

I nearly passed out the other day when I read an article where the <br/>
woman said she had a three year old and one year old who, every day <br/>
set the table for each meal, washed the kitchen floor, cleaned the <br/>
windows, and took out the trash, and the two kids just LOVED to do <br/>
it, it was the highlight of their day, and her house was so nice and <br/>
clean thanks to them!<br/>
<br/>
I thought, Geez, is that even possible for two kids that young to <br/>
handle all that?? <br/>
<br/>
I was afraid maybe I was getting the attitude of, &quot;Well, you can&#39;t <br/>
handle this or do it right, so I&#39;ll take care of it&quot; when maybe I <br/>
shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the responses.<br/>

window cleaning job on the whole house.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Handle all that&quot; seems to imply completion of the task.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to set the table, that doesn&#39;t mean the child should  <br/>
be a waiter at a hotel.<br/>
<br/>
There are kid-degrees of things.<br/>
<br/>
But if a child is MADE to wash windows or set tables, he will learn  <br/>
to avoid it unless he&#39;s being required to function.<br/>
<br/>
Holly (14 now) likes to put the silverware away.  She does it  <br/>
cheerfully and more than once a day.   She doesn&#39;t like to put the  <br/>
other dishes away.  That&#39;s fine.  Holly used to like to  mop the  <br/>
floor.  She quit liking it.  Bummer for me, but had I ever once  <br/>
&quot;made&quot; her do it, it would have turned it to a punishment, a chore.   <br/>
It isn&#39;t.<br/>

It&#39;s not an all or nothing deal.  If they help sometimes, that&#39;s  <br/>
good.  If you make it seem fun, they&#39;re more likely to want to hang  <br/>
around where you are, and even by watching they will learn how to do  <br/>
it.  If you make it pleasant for them to be around you, they might  <br/>
voluntarily help.  Maybe not this year, and possibly never, but if  <br/>
they do and it&#39;s voluntary, that&#39;s something ZERO parents who enforce  <br/>
chores will ever experience.<br/>

DS is playing nearby, checking out the movie, and generally be-bopping <br/>
along, he&#39;s more likely to respond positively when I ask &quot;Hey can you <br/>
put this stack of socks in Daddy&#39;s drawer when you get a chance?&quot; than <br/>
if I said &quot;You have to help put away the laundry&quot;. He&#39;ll find a break <br/>
in the action and take care of it and maybe come back for more things <br/>
to put away. Or maybe not. I might end up done with the folding before <br/>
he finds a break and I&#39;ll take care of it - without &quot;Oh alright I&#39;ll <br/>
just do it myself sheesh sigh mumblemumble...&quot; (or at least I&#39;m trying <br/>
really hard to not do that - I&#39;m much better now)<br/>

&gt; olds always bring their plates over to the sink after eating.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there are loads of unschooling parents of little ones on the <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled list, and no one I know of is writing anything remotely <br/>
close to that, so maybe you need to change your company. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Each of my kids does different things at different times and to <br/>
different extents and all of it is welcomed when it comes.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, the girls have been into helping me cook. The other day, they <br/>
chopped potatoes and onions (Em learned about chopping onions and plans <br/>
on choosing potatoes next time! *g*), they&#39;ve been scrambling their own <br/>
eggs, making their own oatmeal (Em showed Sam how to do his), chopping <br/>
and steaming vegetables and helping make pasta and rice. They certainly <br/>
don&#39;t do this every time I cook, but I always welcome them when they <br/>
ask. For a long time, they liked helping make pizza dough, cookies and <br/>
bread, but then they got bored with that.<br/>
<br/>
Just this weekend, I asked the girls to help me in their room, which had <br/>
become *very* messy and completely un-navigable--pretty much everything <br/>
in there was on the floor. I asked them to let me know when they were <br/>
ready to tackle it.  Jules decided she was ready at some point in the <br/>
afternoon and came and got me, but Em didn&#39;t feel ready. I asked her if <br/>
she felt like sitting on her bed and keeping us company, which she did. <br/>
I did much of the work, which I usually do, but Jules helped a lot, <br/>
which she usually does and Em ran a few errands here and there--taking <br/>
cups to the sink and dirty clothes to the laundry. I ended up diving <br/>
into lots of their bins and asking them to help me sort through stuff <br/>
they no longer wanted. We also reworked their clothes baskets to create <br/>
more room--really an all day affair.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the day, I asked them to do me the favor of keeping the <br/>
floor cleaned up until tomorrow so I could run a vacuum. They asked why <br/>
I didn&#39;t just run the vacuum now, so I told them I needed to get Sam&#39;s <br/>
room cleaned up first and just didn&#39;t have the energy. They were fine <br/>
with that, and we went about our evening--dinner, playing and finally <br/>
curled up in our room to watch a movie and fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
As everyone else was falling asleep, Em, my nightowl, got up and cleaned <br/>
and organized her brother&#39;s room (a much more straight-forward job than <br/>
their room!). It was a gift to him and a gift to me--all freely given. I <br/>
doubt she would have felt so generous if I&#39;d made her clean her room <br/>
with us earlier that day because it was *her* room, and I&#39;m not sure she <br/>
would have thought to do it if I hadn&#39;t been modeling that kind of <br/>
generosity for her most of her life. Maybe she would have, I don&#39;t <br/>
really know. But, I do know this is what happened in our home this past <br/>
weekend, and I know that it&#39;s not an unusual thing to have happen. So, I <br/>
figure we&#39;re doing something right.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to them. There&#39;s an ocean between one-syllable &quot;reading&quot; of books <br/>
<br/>
with only 27 words and what parents could read to a child, but many <br/>
<br/>
thousands of kids (probably millions) have been cut off cold when <br/>
<br/>
they learn to read. It&#39;s almost a punishment. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of the kids at the park who don&#39;t want to learn how to pump<br/>
themselves on the swing because they know that when they do mom will stop<br/>
pushing them.  This morning I was watching Malcolm in theMiddle with my dd<br/>
and the next to youngest &quot;Dewey&quot; says &quot;Growing up is just a big crock.<br/>
Every day you get a little bit older and they expect you to do more and they<br/>
love you less.&quot;  or something like that.  Mom&#39;s reply was,&quot; No Dewey, that&#39;s<br/>
just this family.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671295897">I&#39;m glad that when my two were younger I didn&#39;t insist on chores or that they <br/>
HAVE to do this or that. I&#39;m glad we all did (and do) daily living activities <br/>
together. I&#39;m glad that when they sat with me watching tv and folding laundry <br/>
that I didn&#39;t insist that things be done a certain way. Even though I do have <br/>
a specific way to fold things. &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m glad that a quick vacuum of the living <br/>
room rug or washing the dishes isn&#39;t a huge deal. I&#39;m happy that cleaning the <br/>
bathroom isn&#39;t dreaded. I don&#39;t think it was lazy of me to pick up after the <br/>
kids, or that I was making them lazy. I didn&#39;t *create* lazy or resentful <br/>
kids. Both have things they don&#39;t like or enjoy doing, but don&#39;t we all! I&#39;m <br/>
glad that Darin and I fostered a healthy, respectful attitude about helping <br/>
and pulling together and family. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been having a few problems as I near the end of my pregnancy. I&#39;m on <br/>
orders from my Dr. to rest as much as possible, and taking medication for my <br/>
heart. It&#39;s hard, especially with Darin on the road. He&#39;s got Jack with him, <br/>
so its just Moly and me. I know that if, when Moly was younger, I had insisted <br/>
on chores and the rest that now she could be resentful about doing extra <br/>
things for me. But she doesn&#39;t mind doing the laundry and I can still fold it <br/>
sitting in bed or on the couch. Last weekend Darin was home and we put a chair <br/>
in the kitchen for me and he helped me make up a few meals that I split into <br/>
smaller portions and now Moly doesn&#39;t have to cook, just thaw and warm. And <br/>
she appreciates that. And even though I really shouldn&#39;t get up and drive her <br/>
places I still do. It doesn&#39;t take much out of me to drive her to her drum <br/>
lessons or to her youth group activities. She appreciates that and shows it <br/>
with the little things she does around the house for me. She has been unsure <br/>
and almost standoffish about the whole baby thing, and Darin and I could have <br/>
made my need to rest worse. We could have said &#39;Mom can&#39;t do this so you have <br/>
to&#39;. I believe that since we&#39;ve never said anything like that before and <br/>
didn&#39;t say that now, she isn&#39;t looking at helping out more now as a chore or a <br/>
burden. She may be unsure about the baby, but she doesn&#39;t resent the baby, her <br/>
Dad, or me. She has grown to appreciate what I&#39;ve always done for her and the <br/>
rest of the family and knows that the appreciation runs both ways. Especially <br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
I know from friends experiences with their kids and my own feelings toward my <br/>
parents that creating an adversial relationship about chores (or anything <br/>
between children and parents) can and does come back to bite you in the ass. <br/>
You always have a choice. Helping your children, showing them, guiding them, <br/>
respecting them, acknowledging their abilities... it all goes a long way <br/>
toward family harmony. And isn&#39;t that the goal in the long run? <br/>
