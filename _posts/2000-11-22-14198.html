<div id="ygrps-yiv-179899441">Can anyone help me find out alittle more about the lady who wrote the essay<br/>
titled, &quot;Swinging&quot;  by Norma.  I forwarded the article to my school teacher<br/>
Aunt today, to try to help her to understand unschooling. She has been<br/>
asking me questions and I thought she was truly sincere. Well she doesn&#39;t<br/>
think its about a real child.. that its just made up. I would like to be<br/>
