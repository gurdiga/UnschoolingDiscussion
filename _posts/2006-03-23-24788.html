<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486457216">Hi!  I&#39;m not sure how much help I can be to you and your husband but  <br/>
when I read the below my gut reaction was why not?  Why does he have  <br/>
to work at a job he doesn&#39;t like to do?  Why does he keep doing it?   <br/>
If he doesn&#39;t like paying the bills then why cant he think of ways to  <br/>
eliminate them or at least conserve so they are not as high.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m not very good at thinking like the norm.  But why does a  <br/>
child need to stick anything out.  I love this with my own husband.   <br/>
Sometimes he says one of the kids should stick something out to, it&#39;s  <br/>
ingrained in our society.  With him it&#39;s about money.  I spent the  <br/>
money for that &quot;class, sport etc&quot;  you should stick it out.  On the  <br/>
other hand I always convince him there is more harm in sticking it  <br/>
out then good.  The joy on my sons face when he is not made to  <br/>
continue with something he knows in his mind and body is just not  <br/>
feeling right is wonderful!  What would the world be like if children  <br/>
were given the freedom to explore what feels right to them and then  <br/>
to do what feels good.  Think of all those grumpy people in rush hour  <br/>
traffic who are unhappy and hate their jobs and lives for that matter  <br/>
but stick with it because that is all they have been taught?  Ok Rant  <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
Now why can&#39;t Kianne come home since she is the one who wants to.   <br/>
Just one child to start with.  It is possible to show your husband  <br/>
the joy in Kianne&#39;s face daily by having that freedom and if it is  <br/>
the two of you think of all the wonderful &quot;projects&quot; she could come  <br/>
up with to do together. Ask her, what do you want to find out more  <br/>
about, what do you love to do?  Sit down with her, draft up a plan.  <br/>
Ex:  Oh you like knitting, lets take a class together, help her  <br/>
explore everything about it, how the needles are made, how to make  <br/>
your own, how to figure out the patterns with different yarn because  <br/>
you love that yarn (there&#39;s a math challenge for ya!@)  What animals  <br/>
do the yarn come from and I don&#39;t mean oh sheep. I mean what breeds  <br/>
are best, how do your raise the sheep?  There is a life lesson.  I  <br/>
know several women who have followed their love of knitting and now  <br/>
run yarn stores, own their own flock of sheep and these skills were  <br/>
never taught in a classroom.  Have Kianne show the plan to dad and  <br/>
see what he thinks, maybe he can add things to it.  He may feel more  <br/>
comfortable knowing there is some type of plan not just that your  <br/>
going to sit home all day and watch tv.  (Although, I believe sitting  <br/>
at home all day watching tv can be great research too!)<br/>
<br/>
  It is totally possible that Holly seeing how fun and happy Kianne  <br/>
is will follow suit and want to come home to.  Although with her you  <br/>
may need to try harder to find those opportunities for her to play  <br/>
with her friends on a almost daily basis and to find new friends who  <br/>
she can be social with during the day.  Some people just need to have  <br/>
that in their lives and that is something that needs to be respected  <br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
I know you would like to bring them all home, and I am an all or  <br/>
nothing kind of person so I totally relate to it, but sometimes going  <br/>
slower is better for the other people (maybe your husband?) in our  <br/>
lives.<br/>

&gt; My husband doesn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; or agree with unschooling at all. He is  <br/>
&gt; saying right now to we need to make Kianne stick it out in school,  <br/>
&gt; she can&#39;t just quit. You can&#39;t quit things just because you don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; like them. He went off on a rant saying &quot; I don&#39;t like having to  <br/>
&gt; work, but I do it, I don&#39;t just quit; I don&#39;t like paying the  <br/>
&gt; bills, but I can&#39;t just quit&quot; Good grief!!<br/>
