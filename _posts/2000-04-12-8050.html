<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126224856"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Intellectually, I knew my son was growing up.  But I don&#39;t think with my<br/>
&gt; head, I think with my heart.  And my heart is several years behind.  So if<br/>
&gt; you see me this week, give me a comforting hug.  Here is how you will<br/>
&gt; recognize me: there will be tears in my eyes and I&#39;ll be holding Colton&#39;s old<br/>
&gt; teddy bear.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a 10 and an almost 12 year old, both boys. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot<br/>
lately about a rite of passage ceremony for them... prolly at age 13. I&#39;d<br/>
love to hear what others have done for their children to welcome them into<br/>
adulthood.<br/>
