<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278196914">This will seem a little off topic, but I started a post to this group  <br/>
and it got too big.   I will quote the quote that made me gasp, though:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The hikikomori studied and interviewed for Zielenziger&#39;s book were  <br/>
not autistic, but bright intelligent people who have discovered  <br/>
independent thinking and a sense of self that the current Japanese  <br/>
environment cannot accommodate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It will make more sense if you look here:<br/>

refusal-and.html<br/>
and if that link gets cut off try<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the story of the roundabout way I got to that quote, beginning  <br/>
with watching &quot;This is Spinal Tap,&quot; and moving on to a tape that  <br/>
Meghan Anderson-Coates sent me (THANKS!!!!!) and...<br/>
<br/>
There are &quot;disorders&quot; involving things like not wanting to go to school.<br/>

  You&#39;re welcome! I&#39;m glad you liked it. I found it fascinating. When we were watching it, my dh remembered a couple of the items advertised from when was a kid living in Taiwan for a few years. It was interesting at the end of the movie how they listed all the items that were actual products, etc.<br/>
  I have to say, I&#39;m saddened but not surprised that not wanting to go to school is considered a disorder. I know I&#39;ve heard the term &#39;school refusal&#39; before. Not sure when, where or in what context though. &#39;School refusal&#39; is probably a sign of high intelligence &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
