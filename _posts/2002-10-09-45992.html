<div id="ygrps-yiv-238065631">I just had to jump in with an experience from my<br/>
childhood.  I was diagnosed with Diabetes when I was<br/>
3 years old.  My Grandmother told me as a child that<br/>
I could not have children.  For 12 years I heard this<br/>
on a daily basis.  At the tender age of 16,  I became<br/>
pregnant with my first child.<br/>
<br/>
She never meant any harm to me.  But after hearing <br/>
those words over and over again I believed them on<br/>
a subconscience level.  So when I had sex at 15 I did<br/>
not use any protection because I thought that &quot;I could<br/>
not have children&quot; because I was told so.<br/>
<br/>
Now at the age of 33 I think it is kind of funny.<br/>
But so terribly sad.  I love both of my children<br/>
very much but I was to young at 16 to understand<br/>
how much responsibility comes with a child.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
