found out it was Star Hustler, now re-named to Stargazer :-) Still<br/>

&gt; I do know that your letter sparked a memory of that<br/>

&gt; up. I would dream of flying to the moon. I could see<br/>
&gt; it at night from my window. If you&#39;re ever in O.C. let<br/>
&gt; me know and we&#39;ll have a moon party!<br/>
