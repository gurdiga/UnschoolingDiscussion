<div id="ygrps-yiv-171364085">I just have to boast a bit.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old son plays War Craft (a certain version of it called<br/>
Footman Frenzy) and he just beat this one team that is considered one<br/>
of the best in the world. In fact, when he plays games, usually guys<br/>
team up (sometimes as many as 11 to one!) to play against him. He&#39;s<br/>
just gotten crazy good!<br/>
<br/>
My 13 year old son is becoming better and better at Halo 2 and is in a<br/>
tournament today. He&#39;s been so cute this week, working to get his<br/>
responsibilities done so that he can devote more time to training.<br/>
He&#39;s been downloading strategies off the Internet, printing them,<br/>
studying them, and then using them in trial sessions with his buddy<br/>
who will be his partner. This friend spent the night last night and I<br/>
got such akick out of their discourse - how they worked together, how<br/>
they determined who would be the boss, what codes theya re using to<br/>
cue each other into where their positions are (so that the opponents<br/>
at the tournament won&#39;t know what they&#39;re saying).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a high stakes week for both of my boys who spend a ton of<br/>
time online gaming.<br/>
<br/>
What hit me this a.m. is that sometimes we just don&#39;t realize how<br/>
powerful all this gaming is. We think that it is somehow not as good<br/>
as sports or music. Yet look at all those skills my boys are learning<br/>
just from hours online?<br/>
<br/>
And the sense of pride they have in becoming really good reminds me of<br/>
kids who are stars on their soccer teams. I just don&#39;t get the same<br/>
level of insight because I&#39;m not a gamer.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share. I&#39;m way proud of them.<br/>

<br/>
[LOOK what I just wrote up there!   I left it because it strikes me that I do <br/>
still think of those games as boy-things, which just shows my own filtration <br/>
system at work.   Holly plays Halo 2 for hours every day, and last weekend she <br/>
played with Kirby, who declared her &quot;really not bad.&quot;    In the context of <br/>
their gaming lives, that was quite a compliment and she beamed for half a day.]<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-171546424">Yes they have! In fact, this was the book of choice while we were in<br/>
Italy last summer. My 11 year old who &quot;doesn&#39;t like to read&quot; suddenly<br/>
couldn&#39;t put this book down after his brothers and dad talked about it<br/>
so much. The older kids have gone on to read the whole series, as has<br/>
their dad.<br/>
<br/>
More on gaming. My dh and I went to watch the 13 year old play in his<br/>
first Halo 2 tournament yesterday afternoon. He and his teammate got<br/>
killed in the first round but went all the way to the finals in the<br/>
consolation round (and lost)! It was exciting. They had a great time<br/>
and I FINALLY understand how to watch Halo 2 on the split screen. Lots<br/>
I still don&#39;t get, but I&#39;m learning and understood enough to groan<br/>
when they got hit or cheer when they got a kill! :)<br/>
<br/>
I was the only mother in the whole place. There were only two dads<br/>
(including dh).<br/>
<br/>
It struck me even more forcibly how much we adults don&#39;t understand<br/>
gaming. On this same Saturday, you can bet that there are droves of<br/>
moms and dads and grandparents out on soccer fields cheering their<br/>
sons and daughters on while they compete for their teams. These same<br/>
kids will not play soccer as adults (mostly) and their physical<br/>
exercise (which is a healthy use of time, I agree) will sustain them<br/>
for these few months while they are in soccer.<br/>
<br/>
Yet in the meantime, some kids are learning so much stuff through<br/>
gaming and parents routinely criticize it as entertainment,<br/>
obsessions, worthless use of time, expensive and wasteful and so on.<br/>
<br/>
This is one more instance, for me, of where &quot;encounter&quot; (really<br/>
getting inside what&#39;s going on, not just observing from a comfortable<br/>
distance) has changed me! I&#39;m so glad I went to that tournament and<br/>
could share in my son&#39;s losses and wins with real sympathy.<br/>

have always thought we would play games with out kids-granted, we thought they <br/>
would be much older, but that was before we decided to homeschool, and before <br/>
we came across unschooling... I was SO excited when, at 4, Wyl started getting <br/>
interested in them and I realised how VERY educational they really were! I <br/>
have a huge stockpile of games that we&#39;ve bought over the years, figuring we&#39;d <br/>
either get to them when the kids got older or &#39;way later when the kids were <br/>
gone... we could probably learn for the next 6 years in every subject on the games <br/>
we have stockpiled now! LOL I just kind of thought that since we were the <br/>
&quot;Atari generation&quot;, that more people our age would &quot;get&quot; games, and even still <br/>
play... I guess I should feel like a dinosaur... LOL<br/>

good thing because he can help DS with them (they&#39;re learning Age of <br/>
Empires and DH has already helped DS with StarCraft). But, there are <br/>
those of us who are just slightly ahead of the &#39;Atari generation&#39; <br/>
curve - I was 12 when the first Atari came out, whereas DH was 4.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564954435">Must be generational.<br/>
<br/>
I never played any games (I&#39;m almost 44). Never Atari. I was an adult<br/>
when computers were finally in offices.<br/>
<br/>
But even with that, my husband plays Starcraft and Warcraft and it&#39;s<br/>
because of him that I&#39;ve learned to relax about gaming.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve noticed in the homeschooling world that I inhabit is that<br/>
gaming is considered a waste of time or mere entertainment at best or<br/>
dangerous at worst.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s been cool for me to discover otherwise. (I still don&#39;t like<br/>
playing myself, though I will get on there to play fusion frenzy or<br/>
Rayman. I see it like golf - I love to watch golf on TV, but don&#39;t ask<br/>
me to go golfing. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819369985">I&#39;m not sure if it is generational. I&#39;m 41 and me and my daughters, <br/>
aged 9 and 19, all like to play on Neopets.  My partner (36) plays <br/>
games such as Medal of Honour (Allied Assault). Me and my partner like <br/>
to play Diablo sometimes and dd aged 9 likes to watch us play Diablo 1 <br/>
and 2, I prefer 1 but ex hubby (31) accidentaly broke the disc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-925934822">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have a question about this. My d/s (9) LOVES  playing games on his <br/>
computer but when he&#39;s finished is extremely  irritable and rude whether <br/>
he was asked to get off or not. Does  anyone else have this problem and <br/>
if so any/all suggestions please?  <br/>
<br/>
I encourage him to play because he has learned so much about strategy  <br/>
and has taken one of his games way beyond what I even knew was <br/>
possible,  but we are definitely having an attitude problem when he <br/>
signs off.  Setting limitations just makes him more angry, but there is <br/>
life  outside of the computer game and so much more that we could share  <br/>
together...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Can he play until he&#39;s finished? Setting goals is a big deal. If he has a  <br/>
goal to finish a quest I would think that was good. In a way he is setting  <br/>
himself a time limit (one to finish his goal possibly)<br/>
My son is 14 (as of this week). Sometimes he plays for hours. It is a  <br/>
learning process for parents. If you watch the games a few minutes before and  ask <br/>
what&#39;s going on you may find that you too will want to see the outcome. Just  <br/>
yesterday my son was on runescape trying to solve a riddle. Once I looked I was <br/>
 hooked until he solved it. I was quite impressed.<br/>
 <br/>
I would imagine it&#39;s frustrating to be told to get off the computer in the  <br/>
middle of a quest or anticipating the next. Much like being in the middle  of a <br/>
chat or half way through a digest and being told to get off.<br/>
The &quot;life outside of the computer game and so much more that we  could share <br/>
together&quot; will still be there in a week or a month when  he&#39;s done with his <br/>
current interests.<br/>
 <br/>
As far as being rude. Is he feeling stressed out during his play because he  <br/>
knows someone wishes him off? What&#39;s he mad at? I would look at what&#39;s got him <br/>
 angry and attempt to lesson that.<br/>

regular world, and for a while, around that age (9-11) I remember not thinking <br/>
to be nice about it.   Maybe just point it out to him.<br/>
<br/>
Kids are sometimes like that if they&#39;ve been visiting a friend and having a <br/>
really good time, or they just got back from an overnighter.   It can be a <br/>
relief to be home, but also disappointing.   Maybe he&#39;s disappointed to return <br/>
from being a big powerful important character in a game to being a nine year old <br/>
boy where people are expecting him to be nice.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell him he&#39;s making gamers look bad, and that&#39;s one of the <br/>
reasons some moms forbid games.   He should at least have lots   of input he <br/>
can consider when he thinks about how to act.<br/>
