<div id="ygrps-yiv-821805050">Hi All, <br/>
    First sorry for the cross post. I&#39;m taking a chance that maybe one of<br/>
you that checked out after I did at the Clarion may have picked up a bag of<br/>
book from FUN Books I left there. Jonathan smashed his finger in the car<br/>
door as we were packing up. The bag of books would have been right there in<br/>
front of the check out desk. That&#39;s where I was when he came in from the<br/>
accident. I&#39;ve called the hotel and they said it wasn&#39;t turned in. They are<br/>
to call me if they find it. I high doubt they will. :-( I&#39;m oh so sad.<br/>
<br/>
