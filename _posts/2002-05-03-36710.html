<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846717228">Hi All,<br/>
We started using a new doctor for our kids, one that is closer to our home. <br/>
At their first yearly checkup, the doctor took a lot of time with us, getting <br/>
to know each child, I was impressed. When we explained that we homeschool he <br/>
said, &quot;well that&#39;s great.&quot;  Then he proceeded to quiz the kids.  He asked my <br/>
four year old to spell his name.  He asked my six year old to do an addition <br/>
problem and to write a sentence. When she looked at him blankly because she <br/>
couldn&#39;t think of what to write on the spot like that he dictated a sentence. <br/>
 Then he asked my 10 year old to do a multiplication problem.  <br/>
<br/>
This so took me off guard because I wasn&#39;t expecting it that I didn&#39;t know <br/>
what to say.  I waited to see what the kids would do.  They answered the best <br/>
they could, given that they&#39;ve never been &quot;quizzed&quot; before.  The doctor <br/>
proceeded to explain to my daughter what a sentence was because she hesitated <br/>
when he initially asked her to write the sentence. She knows what a sentence <br/>
is, btw.<br/>
<br/>
The kids didn&#39;t seem all that bothered by the whole experience but I was <br/>
horrified.  I didn&#39;t know what to do, or what to say. In retrospect I <br/>
probably should have asked to speak to the doctor privately and explained <br/>
that I don&#39;t want him quizzing my children and that I was paying him to <br/>
provide medical care for my children, not educational care.  But, of course I <br/>
didn&#39;t think of that until much later.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have an experience like this and what did you do? <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148970777">Our former pediatrician was the one who first suggested that we consider <br/>
homeschooling. Our current doc talks to the kids but doesn&#39;t quiz them. <br/>
She asks me the developmental type questions.<br/>
<br/>
imho, I think you need a new doctor.  Good luck -- finding good doctors <br/>
is not easy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not too late to write him a letter and say your children aren&#39;t the only <br/>
homeschooled children he will ever meet, and that for the benefit of those <br/>
others (and yours, IF you go back &lt;g&gt;), he should consider that unless he&#39;s <br/>
in the habit of quizzing all his patients, schooled or not, and quizzing <br/>
adult patients, that it was inappropriate to quiz your children.<br/>
<br/>
I had a situation which warranted a very similar letter, but it wasn&#39;t to a <br/>
doctor.  I think if you write it it will make you feel better, help him look <br/>
at what he did more objectively (especially if you ask whether he quizzes <br/>
adults) and will benefit future others.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have never had an experience exactly like that, but I have had a physician <br/>
ask my stepdaughter whether she liked being at her father&#39;s house, and if so, <br/>
why, and if not, why not.<br/>
<br/>
I told the doctor that she should not appear to be stirring up trouble where <br/>
there was none, left the office with child in tow, and never went back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704678098">hi robin,<br/>
     i have this problem but it happenes every other friday when my ex comes <br/>
to pick up our daughter, he stands in our home and just startes asking her <br/>
all these different questions.. i asked her if this went on all weekend and <br/>
she says it does not, but she does get upset because he says she&#39;ll never <br/>
excell with this thing we&#39;re doing. i simply told him that she is getting the <br/>
attention and time she needs to do her own thing. he didn&#39;t like it but he <br/>
sees how happy and how much she has learned. who knows this week he may not <br/>
quiz us at all.</div>
