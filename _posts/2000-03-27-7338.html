<div id="ygrps-yiv-819026086">Hi,<br/>
I also have small children.  A 4 and 6 year old and a 20 month old.  We are <br/>
expecting our fourth this June.<br/>
We made a decision to turn our cable off so that television is no longer an <br/>
option for the children.  We go to the library once a week and they are <br/>
allowed one fun movie and the rest need to be educational. <br/>
<br/>
What a change it has been in our house - so peaceful, no tv battles and they <br/>
truly don&#39;t even mention watching any of their old shows (I was very <br/>
selective and limited TV, but I still always felt as if it was too much).<br/>
<br/>
Plus, now my husband and I get to actually talk at night since he isn&#39;t glued <br/>
to the TV:)<br/>
<br/>
As far as daily unschooling - I do put some things on the kitchen table every <br/>
day and let them help themselves at leisure.  Today I didn&#39;t as we are <br/>
getting ready to move and at dinner, they both had some &quot;learning&quot; books out <br/>
and were busy with them.  <br/>
<br/>
I will also ask them for suggestions throughout the day and when they have <br/>
one - I jump at the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
Warm wishes,<br/>
Tonya in Mass<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206273441">Oh boy do I wish I could unplug my husband.  It drives me nuts to have<br/>
the tv on every night.<br/>
Wish I could somehow break it accidentally  :)<br/>
