&gt; seems so clear to me not to do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t forced either, by my parents. But I had friends whose parents would <br/>
make me eat certain things---and drink MILK------EEEEYEEEWW! <br/>
<br/>
But I *was* a member of the &quot;Clean Plate Club&quot;---all those starving children <br/>
in China, ya&#39; know!. I didn&#39;t have to eat anything I didn&#39;t care for--- but I <br/>
DID have to eat what was in front of me. <br/>
<br/>
I babysat for people who force fed their children---and made ME an <br/>
accomplice! THAT&#39;S when I decided I would never do it. I saw so many children <br/>
made to eat---and just chew and chew and chew, never swallowing. Suppertime <br/>
would last for HOURS! When Cameron was a baby I refused to get caught up in <br/>
that, just KNOWING that he would be a picky eater. WRONG! That child has <br/>
always eaten everything he&#39;s ever tried! Go figure! Whenever you&#39;re <br/>
prepared...! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
