Now all of a sudden he says he is not interested in anything  just  <br/>
having  fun<br/>
and no learning is not &quot;fun&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I keep reading all these posts with people struggling to get unschooling,  <br/>
and about parents frustrated because their kids are saying that learning isn&#39;t  <br/>
fun. So I thought about it. Most of the kids saying this think of &quot;learning&quot; <br/>
as  something kind of the opposite of fun.  <br/>
 <br/>
Playing games is fun. Watching tv is fun. Reading can be fun (if it&#39;s  <br/>
something you like and you&#39;re doing it for...well...fun.) Playing with (and  maybe <br/>
even taking care of) the dog is fun, pretending to be a pirate, making  things, <br/>
using the computer, maybe cooking... Fun.<br/>
 <br/>
You get the idea. And most people who are here, even the beginners, will  <br/>
recognize that for any and all of these things that kids choose to do for fun  <br/>
during the day can be a source of remarkable learning.<br/>
 <br/>
But I think that even a lifelong unschooled kid would emit a bored sigh if  <br/>
someone said, &quot;Let&#39;s LEARN today!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s meaningless, and it even sounds boring. Learning isn&#39;t fun -- doing  <br/>
stuff that you find interesting and discovering more about it so you can do it  <br/>
better -- that&#39;s fun. Using stuff you already know to discover more interesting <br/>
 things is fun too.  But it has to be connected to something to mean  <br/>
anything, and when we talk about learning to kids (or even to each other) as an  <br/>
abstract concept, we lose them. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s all about relationship. Kids often find school boring because  <br/>
everything is presented as Necessary, but not necessarily related facts.  Learning <br/>
isn&#39;t fun. Sometimes in school they happen upon a topic or a book that  the kid <br/>
finds interesting and exciting, and sometimes that moment can change a  kid&#39;s <br/>
life. But it isn&#39;t the teaching/learning -- it&#39;s the relationship to the  child.<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t have to do that. We can just live and explore and let our kids&#39;  <br/>
worlds be very, very big so they can find the connections to themselves. We may  <br/>
notice that our kids are learning, but it doesn&#39;t have to be about that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136499609">It&#39;s also what we are learning. In school you are forced to &quot;learn&quot; <br/>
something whether you find it interesting or not. And there is such a <br/>
general area of facts that are to be learned in school. Unschooling allows a <br/>
child to focus on what interests them and often because school is so <br/>
narrow - the breadth of learning in the world is not in that narrow frame <br/>
that we were conditioned was &quot;educational&quot;.  So when our children are doing <br/>
things that are &quot;fun&quot; to them but we see them as &quot;not educational&quot; we are <br/>
forcing them to view life through our narrowly conditioned mind.<br/>
<br/>
We may<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771874601">&lt;&lt;Learning isn&#39;t fun -- doing stuff that you find interesting and <br/>
discovering more about it so you can do it better -- that&#39;s fun.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have always found learning to be fun.  I suppose that is because I <br/>
was usually given the oprotunity to learn about subjects that I was <br/>
interested in.  When I was in HS (and since then), if I found a <br/>
subject interesting (I went to public school), I would go to the <br/>
library and read everything I could get my hands on about it.  If I <br/>
read a book that I really liked, I would get every book written by <br/>
that author and read them.  <br/>
<br/>
As a result, I usually ended up knowing, understanding, and <br/>
retaining a lot more than they ever taught in school.  I was <br/>
also &quot;lucky&quot; enough to have teachers who understood that I learned <br/>
better on my own.  Yes, I was still required to turn in book reports <br/>
and similar projects but I was usually given the leeway to do these <br/>
projects on subjects that interested me (which was not always what <br/>
was being taught in class).  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is why I have had no real problem understanding and even <br/>
embarcing unschooling.  All I know is that I want my daughter to <br/>
grow up loving to learn about things that interest her and not being <br/>
forced to study things she has no interest in; memorizing the <br/>
answers so that she can pass the test and then prompty forgetting it <br/>
all.    <br/>

find interesting and<br/>
discovering more about it so you can do it better -- that&#39;s fun.&quot;<br/>

  Hmm.... For every action, there is and equal and opposite reaction.  (did I learn that in school?  I can&#39;t remember...)<br/>
