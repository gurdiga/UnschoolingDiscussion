<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654313993">HI!!  My kids and I saw a fisher cat/ weasel type of animal a month or<br/>
so ago.  The one we saw was hunting for a muskrat.  It was wonderful to<br/>
witness all of this first hand  _ I kept thinking if the kids were in<br/>
school right now they&#39;d miss all of this!!  :)   It looked like a fisher<br/>
to me but seemed small for one.  Maybe a runt?  &lt;g&gt; What I have come to<br/>
know about fisher cats is they are making a comeback and have been found<br/>
closer to residential areas now.  They are neat to see but do lock up<br/>
your cats at night - the fishers will kill them or any other small<br/>
animal around.  <br/>
 We are in MA, Heather where in CT are you ? <br/>
Have fun!  Sharon</div>
