    This I tried w/ Frog and Toad but she tired of it after 2 nights.At times <br/>
she will p/u a book I&#39;ve read and pretend to read it. She gets most of the <br/>
story correct. I am not worried about when she&#39;ll read, I have my standard <br/>
line for the inquiries. But she does seem genuinely frustrated about it. She <br/>
does alot of writing,she&#39;ll ask me to spell for her while she write a letter <br/>
to someone. She also writes in mirror image alot. My mother thinks this is <br/>
fascinating. I think I will try my mothers suggestion next and lable the <br/>
house. Might be fun.<br/>

   Thank you NICKI~</div>

 </span></blockquote>When she first started reading, my daughter loved to do &quot;treasure hunts&quot;.<br/>
I would make a series of clues and hide each on ein the place pointed to<br/>
by the last one, and at the end there would be a treasure (usually a lego<br/>
or playmobil treasure chest). When she first started, the clues were<br/>
things like &quot;bed&quot;, then on the bed, there would be a card that said &quot;cat&quot;<br/>
(which only works if you have cats like ours who rarely move), then by<br/>
the cat it might say &quot;tub&quot;... and as she got to be a more proficient<br/>
reader it would be more like, &quot;Look on mom&#39;s bed&quot; or &quot;Look under the milk<br/>
jug&quot;... and later still I got into mysterious clues, like &quot;This is the<br/>
place where books should be, When on their way to the library&quot;. She<br/>
really loved the gaem, she&#39;s always been into the idea of mysteries and<br/>
detectives.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie once (unintentionally) wrote the whole alphabet in mirror image,<br/>
when trying out a new calligraphy set. It was kind of odd, since she<br/>
rarely wrote letters backwards. She still writes numbers backwards<br/>
sometimes, though, especially when she&#39;s hurrying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Labeling everything is a great idea! There is no point<br/>
in repeatedly reading a book she doesn&#39;t request to<br/>
hear over and over - but maybe if you tried a few<br/>
predictable print books she may take to that. Here are<br/>
a few suggestions: Brown Bear Brown Bear What Do You<br/>
See & Polar Bear Polar Bear What Do You Hear (both by<br/>
Bill Martin Jr.), The Very Hungry Caterpillar & The<br/>
Grouchy Lady Bug (both by Eric Carle), Pumpkin Pumpkin<br/>
by Jeanne Titherington, If I Had by Mercer Mayer, But<br/>
Not The Hippopotamus by Sandra Boynton, Cat On The Mat<br/>
by Brian Wildssmith, or Growning Colors by Bruce<br/>
McMillan. (Frog and Toad books would be almost<br/>
impossible first (*by*) readers - although they&#39;re<br/>
great to read *to* her. The books suggested have very<br/>
few words and the the pictures give enought cues that<br/>
your daughter will probably be reading them herself<br/>
after only a few readings by you. This was not the<br/>
method I used to teach my older children.  They<br/>
learned in school using phonics and all read as little<br/>
as possible.  This is something learned after it was<br/>
too late to help them, but this is what I&#39;m doing with<br/>
my youngest.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606826226">I labelled the house for my son right before he turned two because he was<br/>
fascinated with signs and &quot;reading&quot; them (he would just read the letters on<br/>
them).  While out and about one day he made me stop so he could read the<br/>
letters on a sign I asked him if he&#39;d like it if he had signs at home to<br/>
read.  He excitedly yelled &quot;Yes!&quot; and we went and got strips of sturdy paper<br/>
at a teacher supply store and went home.  I asked him what he wanted me to<br/>
write on his &quot;sign&quot; and the paper were different colors so he handed me a<br/>
yellow one and said &quot;draw yellow&quot;, so I wrote Yellow on it.  He did it for<br/>
each color.  Then he said he wanted one for fireplace and I wrote fireplace,<br/>
asked him where he wanted it, and he took it to the fireplace.  He continued<br/>
until our home looked like a preschool :).  door, toilet, oven, microwave,<br/>
closet, garage, cabinet, clock, dishwasher, drawer, bookcase, desk,<br/>
computer, television....<br/>
He loved to be able to go around and read the letters off of everything and<br/>
know what the words were.  A few months later (he was about 2 years, 3<br/>
months) he spelled his first word.  We were driving and he saw a building<br/>
with a D on it, he said &quot;door has a D in it&quot; and I said yes it does.  He<br/>
then said &quot;D-o-o-r says door&quot;.<br/>
A few months after that we went to a park and on the structure it says &quot;Play<br/>
safe&quot;.  As we were walking towards it he said &quot;I know that word! It says<br/>
play!&quot; That wasn&#39;t a word we had up, and after about a week of me trying to<br/>
figure out how he learned it I finally figured it out - the VCR!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, labeling can be fun.  We&#39;ve taken all of ours down for now, right<br/>
now we have the solar system up in our living room instead, per Julian&#39;s<br/>
requet :) If he asks again we&#39;ll put more up, it did make for a lot of fun,<br/>
and quick and easy distraction while I would cook dinner or do dishes.<br/>
