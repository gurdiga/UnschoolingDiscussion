very disappointing. We have the huge big Smithsonian set and we lost interest <br/>
fast.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550716927">How long has this unschooling as it is today been around.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is as it is happening in home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that there is no real way to define it.<br/>
<br/>
It is my understanding that unschooling is when you allow the children to<br/>
lead.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think that a lot book work would not be part of the setting of<br/>
unschooling. Nor would tests.  Is this wrong?<br/>
<br/>
How does it translates when you have a child who has an area that they don&#39;t<br/>
wish to do because to them it is hard. Such as writing or math.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure that all of us want the best for our children.<br/>
 The best to me means  is college and hopefully  a 4 year college after high<br/>
school.  How does this unschooling works when there are S.A. T. scores are<br/>
going to matter along with G. P. A. and ton of other things.</div>

&lt;&lt; How long has this unschooling as it is today been around. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
the 1960&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is my understanding that there is no real way to define it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of descriptions, but not a one single official definition.  <br/>
There are many things which are NOT unschooling, and lots that are.  Mostly <br/>
it&#39;s a way of looking at learning, and a changing of priorities and <br/>
awarenesses.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is my understanding that unschooling is when you allow the children to<br/>
lead.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too simple a description.  If you really want to understand <br/>
unschooling from the point of view of many families who are committed to it, <br/>
go to www.unschooling.com and read the archives and the message boards.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How does it translates when you have a child who has an area that they don&#39;t<br/>
wish to do because to them it is hard. Such as writing or math.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
These things are discussed at length at unschooling.com, and so you could go <br/>
and read what&#39;s already written.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also already discussed.<br/>
<br/>
This list is not really for the purpose of intro to unschooling, sorry.  <br/>
There&#39;s an assumption that people here have read some John Holt or are <br/>
unschoolers already.<br/>
<br/>
[Note for others on the list who might wonder why I&#39;m being short about this: <br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cloister@...">cloister@...</a> on another list I was on, and I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s <br/>
why she or he is here now with beginner questions.]<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:) That is a chemistry question!! Science in<br/>
life...WHY? The portions were too small is a<br/>
hypothesis. So try bigger portions. WHY does this work<br/>
better? or does it? What happens if you substitute<br/>
something for something else? WHY?<br/>
