we are a travelling family hoping to meet other unschoolers while on <br/>
the road. we are on our way from houston to columbus, ohio tomorrow. <br/>
we will be there for 6 weeks. we travel in our rv for my huband&#39;s <br/>
job. our 2 boys are 1 and 5 but are used to playing with kids of all <br/>
ages. we have been travelling all over the usa for 4 years and love <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
