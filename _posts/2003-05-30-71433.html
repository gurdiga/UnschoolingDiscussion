&lt;&lt; Speaking of Eddie Izzard, Sandra, I just saw that he&#39;s going on tour. <br/>
 DH and I are going to go went he comes to Detroit.  We saw Dressed To <br/>
Kill on HBO and laughed our asses off.  Gotta pick that up on DVD! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve already committed to going en masse to the Weird Al concert in August, <br/>
so I&#39;m hesitant to even check the Eddie Izzard schedule.  It might only  make <br/>
me unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Helena in London said she saw him in a play there and he was <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that discussion here about expectations of prominent people, and <br/>
whether it&#39;s fair to expect more of some people?  There&#39;s a site with fan <br/>
reports/reviews/commentary on his comedy shows, which is very cool.  Someone collects <br/>
and posts reports after performances.  One person (young female from England, <br/>
I think) had a VERY snarky thing to say, and it was that she was dissatisfied <br/>
with the show not having tons of new material, and she said (not so nicely) <br/>
that he needed to decide whether he was going to be a comedian or be an actor, <br/>
and not try to do both.<br/>
<br/>
OH HUH!!<br/>
<br/>
She needs to take a deep breath and not think she owns him.<br/>
<br/>
If he never did stand-up again, the already-recorded material is more and <br/>
better than most people provide for posterity.  And if wants to quit acting and <br/>
quit comedy and become a diplomat or a truck driver, that&#39;s HIS life to decide <br/>
and not hers to dictate.<br/>
