Sounds a great time to get away just the two of you. Have you heard of<br/>
Marriage Encounter? It&#39;s a weekend designed to help good marriages into<br/>
great ones. The weekend focuses on just the two of you and improving<br/>
communication between you. It&#39;s not a retreat, nor a marriage clinic, nor<br/>
group sensitivity. It&#39;s a unique approach aimed at revitalizing Christian<br/>
marriage. Sounds like you might enjoy a weekend alone with your dh.<br/>
<br/>
We went 3 years ago (married 16 yrs) and it helped us a lot. I don&#39;t think<br/>
we would have even started homeschooling this year if we could not discuss<br/>
the ideas and be more open to each others feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. It was great for us.<br/>

Hope you get a chance to get away. It sounds like you guys deserve to get<br/>
away and make a weekend after all the stresses you guys have had.<br/>

     Thanks!  I went to the site and bookmarked it so that I could go back <br/>
again later.<br/>
I am going to do my best to talk my husband into a getaway with just the two <br/>
of us.<br/>
We haven&#39;t been alone together in over 17 years.  We need it!  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
we will know how to act without our kids around though!  LOL<br/>
