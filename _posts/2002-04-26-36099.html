Here is what I&#39;ve gotten out of what I&#39;ve read in the past here:<br/>
You can&#39;t unschool unless you relinguish ALL control over your <br/>
children&#39;s choices including when and how to do housework, sleep watch <br/>
TV, etc<br/>
Those who have said their children have special needs (like food <br/>
allergies, diabetes, mood disorders) say they are unschooling but that <br/>
it does not look like the unschoolers in the first statement.<br/>
And many here have said that you should put the control withthe child <br/>
even in cases like diabetes, because that is the only way to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I have said that I unschool my daughters and don&#39;t care what you want <br/>
to call what we do with Wyndham but I consider it unschooling.  But it <br/>
sure does look a LOT different from what I do with the girls.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I&#39;m asking is - -  Is unschooling supposed to be the <br/>
same for everyone including those with special needs?  And if so, how <br/>
can that be?<br/>

&gt; children&#39;s choices including when and how to do housework, sleep watch <br/>
&gt; TV, etc<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;ve read here, repeatedly and I&#39;ve written it myself - is that <br/>
unschooling means giving up SCHOOLISH stuff - stuff like textbooks, tests, <br/>
grades, assignments - and replacing those by seeing and appreciating and <br/>
facilitating the learning that comes by serendipity or by living in an <br/>
enriched environment or by supporting kids&#39; interests. <br/>
<br/>
In addition to that I&#39;ve seen conversations about other things - such as <br/>
housework and sleep and tv - in which people have stated their opinions about <br/>
coercing or limiting or controlling in those areas as well. And people have <br/>
said that, to them, it makes sense that unschoolers would be less controlling <br/>
in those areas and I&#39;ve seen posts (and written posts) pointing out the <br/>
benefits (imo, obviously) of BEING less controlling.<br/>
<br/>
But I never saw ANYBODY say that you can&#39;t unschool without relinquishing all <br/>
control over children&#39;s choices. I think you&#39;ve set up a straw man with this <br/>
statement. I do know that there are a few people who do believe in <br/>
relinquishing all &quot;control.&quot; That would be the &quot;Taking Children Seriously&quot; <br/>
noncoercive parenting crowd. But many people unschool - do not &quot;do school&quot; in <br/>
any way, shape, or form - while still requiring chores, bedtimes, and/or <br/>
limiting television. They probably have all kinds of other ways they make <br/>
choices FOR their kids too. My kids must wear seat belts in the car. My kids <br/>
are not allowed to eat in the bedrooms. My kids have chores to do on a <br/>
regular basis. My kids have to share the computer with me &lt;G&gt;. They aren&#39;t <br/>
ordered around harshly  -  they help make the decisions, but there are times <br/>
that I have the final say. When we&#39;re running to catch an airplane and they <br/>
want to play just one more game on the PlayStation, I might say, &quot;No, you <br/>
have to turn it off now we have to leave now.&quot; I might tell them, &quot;Please <br/>
have the table cleared off before you leave today.&quot;  None of this has <br/>
anything to do with our unschooling - it is just our parenting and the way <br/>
our family has evolved.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are being respectful and thoughtful and considerate of how <br/>
children really learn best and so they are LIKELY to be respectful and <br/>
thoughtful and considerate of their children in general and to TRUST their <br/>
kids much more than other parents do. So they are likely to be less <br/>
controlling and less limiting. I, personally, think they are less likely to <br/>
feel the NEED to be those things because the kids are not being shaped by <br/>
school.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t seen anybody say that. It would be stupid NOT to hand over control <br/>
of their diabetes to the child, as they get older. It would also be stupid to <br/>
make a 2 yo be fully in charge. Neither has anything to do with unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Do you give him assignments on material you&#39;ve decided to teach him and grade <br/>
his work and test him on the stuff you&#39;ve decided to teach him whether he <br/>
wanted to learn it or not? If so, it certainly isn&#39;t unschooling. If not, <br/>
then it probably is.<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s been implied is that once you recognize that children can be trusted<br/>
to learn the &quot;academic&quot; things then it&#39;s hard not to question why kids can&#39;t<br/>
learn the rest of the things they&#39;ll need in life by living life.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;I need to do it this way,&quot; the natural question many<br/>
unschoolers who don&#39;t separate unschooling from life is &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And many here have said that you should put the control withthe child<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, it was never said.<br/>
<br/>
For *some* people unschooling and all aspects of life are inextricable.<br/>
<br/>
I think allowing children the freedom to decide what is right for them is<br/>
being confused with learning by trial and error. I wouldn&#39;t let my daughter<br/>
step off a cliff to learn that cliffs are dangerous. But if she got cranky<br/>
after playing Nintendo, I&#39;d help her become more aware of her feelings and<br/>
how they might relate to other things (eating, playing Nintendo, sitting<br/>
still for several hours, and so forth). I&#39;d help her understand herself<br/>
rather than saying letting her behavior dictate what I allowed her to do.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the advice has been to help parents to stop seeing problems that<br/>
don&#39;t exist, *not* to tell parents to ignore problems that do exist.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it <br/>
&gt; sure does look a LOT different from what I do with the girls.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That what you do with your girls looks similar is coincidental not inherent<br/>
in unschooling. How each unschooling child lives his or her life and how the<br/>
parents interact with him will be different because children are different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is unschooling supposed to be the<br/>
&gt; same for everyone including those with special needs?  And if so, how<br/>
&gt; can that be?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The philosophy is still the same: people will learn what they need from<br/>
living life. Part of living life for kids is having parents who care about<br/>
them and want to help them achieve what they&#39;re trying to achieve. Just as<br/>
some 2 yos will need help climbing the stairs and others won&#39;t, some people<br/>
will need help recognizing what their body&#39;s needs are. That doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
taking the control away from them. It means helping them gain their own<br/>
control.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>same for everyone including those with special needs?  And if so, how<br/>
can that be?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Since no two lives can be *exactly* the same, I don&#39;t think any two <br/>
unschooling lives can be *exactly* the same. There will always be <br/>
differences in how any one person chooses to go about living and learning. <br/>
But I think it&#39;s the living and learning that remains the unschooling <br/>
constant.<br/>
<br/>
For my two children, the differences come out in things like personality, <br/>
energy, interests and also some &quot;special needs&quot;. The constant of <br/>
unschooling, though, is that they are still each free to pursue their own <br/>
interests in their own way. The constant of unschooling is in *my* <br/>
perception of their ability to learn. I&#39;m absolutely certain that they will <br/>
do it, and that they do NOT need a schoolish scope and sequence guideline to <br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the parenting differences that come up also have to do with my kids&#39; <br/>
differences. Conor tends toward depression. So if I see that his interests <br/>
are leading him somewhere dark and potentially dangerous to his psyche, I&#39;ll <br/>
step in and try to suggest some equally appealing lighter alternatives. <br/>
That&#39;s just a part of caring and helping out someone you love. I hope that <br/>
my friends and family will do the same for me. :o)<br/>
<br/>
For Casey, who tends towards the excitable end of things, I might help her <br/>
to find some calming things to do when I see that she&#39;s getting overwhelmed. <br/>
I might offer to read a story or make a craft. That&#39;s also just parenting to <br/>
help her learn to self-regulate.<br/>
<br/>
A special-needs child who absolutely *needs* structure and routine (autism <br/>
comes to mind) shouldn&#39;t be denied those things. In fact, NO child should be <br/>
denied what they need. I think the unschooling constant though, is that we, <br/>
as parents, have come to understand that the routines and structures of <br/>
school are artificial and not really part of anyone&#39;s natural routine. <br/>
Therefore, we can help our own children find their structure, routine and <br/>
learning without using schoolish methods as the model.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
(Uh-oh.... I feel a metaphor coming on.  And it&#39;s a lame one...)<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling has a single &quot;root&quot;, which is its philosophy, but it<br/>
has many leaves and flowers, which are its practice in people&#39;s<br/>
different lives.<br/>
<br/>
Blunt, get-your-attention posts tend to be directed at getting to the<br/>
root of the unschooling philosophy.  Many of us on this list don&#39;t<br/>
believe unschooling will work well, unless the parent &quot;gets&quot; the key<br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
No single post can tell a new questioner exactly how to unschooler one<br/>
or all of her children.  What each child persues, when, how and with<br/>
whom is totally individual and unpredictable.  People offer suggestions,<br/>
which come both from their lives and their philosophical beliefs.  This<br/>
advice may be accepted or discarded.  It certainly should be filtered,<br/>
adapted and customized, in my opinion.  However, if the philosophy<br/>
doesn&#39;t fit, then it&#39;s really unlikely that the advice on this list<br/>
would ever fit.  In that case, I would think finding a different list<br/>
would be more satisfactory.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is pretty much what I&#39;ve been saying all along.  The goal should <br/>
be for the child to have complete control over his entire life as soon <br/>
as possible And not be unhappy along the way.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem is that not all kids can reach that point in the same way <br/>
or at the same time.  For example, I would have been perfectly happy <br/>
letting Rachel drive at 14 and she wanted to at that point.  <br/>
Unfortunately our state law is 16.  Rachel at 14 was strong <br/>
enough and independent enough that had life allowed, she could <br/>
have moved out and been completely on her own.  Jenni, on the other <br/>
hand is nearly 15 now and has no desire to drive and is not ready to <br/>
be on her own.  I want her learn how to drive just in case and I&#39;ve <br/>
explained that to her.  What she does in six more months is up to her. <br/>
<br/>
But that isn&#39;t really a good example of what I mean.  Maybe this is <br/>
better, Jenni is allergic to milk.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve mentioned her <br/>
diet to her since she was 5.  Once she understood how milk made her <br/>
feel she took control of it.  She accepted the responsibility if she <br/>
cheated and felt bad.  Rachel, whose allergy is corn, was also given <br/>
complete control very early.  But she was not as comfortable with it. <br/>
 When she started taking out her bad reactions on the rest of the <br/>
family, she lost the priviledge to choose for a while.  We <br/>
periodically let go several times and once she learned not to take it <br/>
out on us, she kept the control all to herself.  Although, I can&#39;t <br/>
count how many times I&#39;ve asked her how much corn she had when she has <br/>
a headache - not nagging, just a reminder to think about it.  <br/>
Eventually, she will either grow out of the allergy or come to terms <br/>
with it and stop binging, I hope.<br/>
I guess I could have let her keep eating it when she was 9 and just <br/>
let her have daily temper tantrums and rages and headaches.  But that <br/>
would have been damaging to the entire family.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What you seem to be saying with this is that you had two choices: allow her<br/>
to make the right choice or take her right to choose away from her until she<br/>
could make the right choice.<br/>
<br/>
How about asking her during or after a tantrum if she had corn? How about<br/>
asking her to have her tantrum elsewhere because it isn&#39;t fair for the whole<br/>
family to suffer for the choices she makes?<br/>
<br/>
Others will probably have other ideas since I haven&#39;t had to stretch my<br/>
brain much in that area but it&#39;s a starting point.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s difficult to talk about a past problem. It&#39;s a whole lot more<br/>
meaningful to talk about a current problem since we can talk about what is<br/>
working and not working, not remembrances of what worked and didn&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So - can he choose to not do anything that involves &quot;material?&quot; Or he has to <br/>
choose some sort of material?<br/>
<br/>
Going to someone&#39;s house to &quot;do school&quot; does sound like the opposite of <br/>
unschooling, even if he is getting a lot of choice. My kids&#39; school allowed <br/>
HUGE choice - they got to decide what they read, what they wrote, which <br/>
learning centers they would visit throughout the day. They had no tests or <br/>
grades. But it was still school. They went at a certain time and came home at <br/>
a certain time and there was a teacher and there was the expectation that <br/>
that was where they were doing their academic learning.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids go hang out with Grandma at her house, we don&#39;t call it &quot;doing <br/>
school.&quot; If there isn&#39;t &quot;school&quot; happening, why do you call it that? Seems <br/>
sort of an odd choice of words.<br/>
<br/>
As part of figuring out what aspects of school are tossed out by unschoolers, <br/>
another one might be that learning occurs on schedule or in certain places at <br/>
certain times.<br/>

<br/>
The only thing my mom has told me about books for him, is that my dh <br/>
and I have to start doing some of the reading with him because she is <br/>
tired of learning about trains and trucks.  Then after a bit of <br/>
discussion, we decided it would be best all around if dh did the bulk <br/>
of the reading with him, because dh can answer his questions.  Mom and <br/>
I often can&#39;t and he is not yet patient enough to wait for us to find <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But I have said repeatedly that Wyndham chooses his own books.  In <br/>
fact, in part of the reading thread earlier, I said it was difficult <br/>
for me to think of his taste in terms of books like I do with the <br/>
girls because HIS choice of books is so different from mine and so <br/>
much like my dh&#39;s taste.  <br/>

occassionally but the difference is, now she understands it and just <br/>
talking aboutit is all it takes to get her back on track.  <br/>
<br/>
And my experience with her has a lot of impact on how I handle Wyndham <br/>
allergies.  They are a lot alike.  Right now, Wyndham is at the point <br/>
where he has no self-control about food.  He is also working through <br/>
lots of other problems.  Telling him he has to monitor his own food <br/>
would be cruel right now.  That does not mean I am doing nothing about <br/>
the problem except monitoring his food.  We talk about it and the <br/>
effects it has a lot.    <br/>
<br/>
And yes, when I was struggling to get my food sensitivities under <br/>
control, my dh DID take things away from me and I&#39;m glad he did.  He <br/>
helped me until I could get my own balance back and that is exactly <br/>
what I&#39;m doing with my children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have to remember that this is the child with lots of problems like <br/>
OCD and anxiety disorder.  He created this schedule himself. His whole <br/>
day is mapped out around when he goes to grandma&#39;s and when he watches <br/>
TV.  And woe to us when we disrupt that schedule.  Even when it is for <br/>
fun things like field trips and he can choose to go or not, it throws <br/>
him off balance enough that he gets crabby and irritable.<br/>
So yes, the learning goes on all the time.  But for this child, the <br/>
schedule is very important right now.<br/>

not answer, but the next obvious question is &quot;If there isn&#39;t anything <br/>
school-like happening, why does he call it school?&quot;<br/>
