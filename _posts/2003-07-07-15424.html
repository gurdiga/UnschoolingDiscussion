<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931270935">Wading pools. Several if necessary, for you and the kids. Water spraying <br/>
toys. Heat sucks the energy and niceness out of me, so the first thing is to<br/>
get cool and go from there. :)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of fluids. Lemonade. Ice Water. Iced Tea.<br/>
<br/>
New video games (rentals to see what you all like before you buy). Will they<br/>
play board games? I have lots of favorites of those.<br/>
<br/>
Naps.<br/>
<br/>
New pets (mice or dwarf hamsters or finches or anything that is entertaining<br/>
to watch and feed).<br/>
<br/>
Outings to air conditioned places that stir the souls of at least one of the<br/>
children. If I were trying to get Brit out of the house, I&#39;d take her to a<br/>
pet shop to window shop, or find a pet fair, or take her to a display of<br/>
medieval swords (she&#39;s heavily armed these days, playing &quot;Link&quot; from Legend<br/>
of Zelda). I&#39;d bribe Mikey into going with us by promising to take her the<br/>
next day to something fabulous to her.<br/>

Can you do any kind of middle of the night outings?  Does the<br/>
temperature drop at all over night?  (Morning people sometimes like to<br/>
go places at 5am in the summer, but that advice may be useless to you. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Your kids are older than mine I think.  Can you leave them home and run<br/>
to the library and pick up a towering pile of stuff?  Utter boredom<br/>
might cause them to look at some of it.  Funny stuff might be the<br/>
ticket, maybe bitterly cynical funny stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Invite more people from the list to come over and visit with you to<br/>
liven things up?<br/>
<br/>
Have a film festival of extremely snowy movies?  (I don&#39;t have a<br/>
favorite snowy movie, but my favorite &quot;you&#39;ll never feel warm again&quot;<br/>
book is H.M.S. Ulysses by Alistair MacLean, based on his naval<br/>
experiences on ships supplying northern Russian ports in winter.  I&#39;ve<br/>
never been so close to freezing to death just from reading.)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  My kid never wants to go most places either, but our weather<br/>
is more fortunate.<br/>

I do try that every now and then. Remind them that I grew up without a TV. There were no computers and we didn&#39;t have a car to go places like the beach until I was 23. I&#39;d left home by then!<br/>
<br/>
Heather then reminds me that I had much more freedom. I could spend all day out on my bike or playing in the woods cos there were hardly any cars and no peverts. She then berates me for moving to America where she cannot leave the neighbourhood - ours is a circle, a mile in Circumference. The neighbourhod then has one access road to a 8 lane highway that is gridlocked at all hours. She&#39;s taken to walking the dog round the circle but constantly points out that if we were back home she could go for miles :-(<br/>
