<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556921227">I just had two major surgeries this year, and have lingering health problems <br/>
from that.  Also, may possibly have lupus according to the dr.  I just can&#39;t <br/>
afford to be without insurance.  I still owe over $4000 copay from the two <br/>
surgeries.  <br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">This is a good idea. One of my former coworkers did 
this as well. It cost us $80 per person on our insurance. She just put that $80 
into savings for when they needed medical. We on the other hand have had 
stitched twice and a snake bite in three years. Thankgoodness for the 
inssurance. The snake bite would have broke us. He was in the hospital for 
3-4days with that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corallyn</font></div>

  to try to go without health insurance for myself. &gt;&gt;<br><br>I and the 
  two kids don&#39;t have health insurance... Our premiums were $300 a <br>month and 
  then a co-pay of $15.&nbsp; My kids go to the doctors about once a year, 
  <br>if that and it seemed such a waste of money.&nbsp; We took $200 and put it 
  into an <br>account each month and that&#39;s where we pay from if we need the 
  doctors <br>(which, as I said is rare).&nbsp; Our car insurance covers us if 
  we are in any <br>kind of accident, whether it&#39;s my fault or not and people we 
  visit own their <br>homes and have home owners insurance so the only other 
  accidents or medical <br>issues would be like apendicitis.&nbsp; We felt that 
  self-pay was the better way <br>to go in our case, as our kids just don&#39;t seem 
  to get sick (touch wood).... <br>Max has never been sick since he was born and 
  he&#39;s 10 months and Zak&#39;s had 2 <br>very bad colds and that&#39;s it in his 5 
  years.&nbsp; I guess we come from robust <br>stock (LOL)...<br><br>Dawn
