<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447707579">&quot;Leaders are not what many people think--people with huge crowds following<br/>
them.  Leaders are people who go their own way without caring, or even<br/>
looking to see if anyone is following them.  &#39;Leadership qualities&#39; are not<br/>
the qualities that enable people to attract followers, but those that enable<br/>
them to do without them.  They include, at the very least, courage,<br/>
endurance, patience, humor, flexibility, resourcefulness, determination, a<br/>
keen sense of reality, and the ability to keep a cool and clear head even<br/>
when things are going badly.&quot;--John Holt, from &quot;Teach Your Own,&quot; pg. 68.<br/>
