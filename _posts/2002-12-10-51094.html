<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226447423">I have no &quot;music inteeligence&quot;, so I neeed help from all you who do.<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old is getting a drum set for Christmas. Can you buy sheet music <br/>
for drums? Or is it more a &quot;by ear&quot; thang? Cameron&#39;s talked about &quot;tabs&quot; or <br/>
&quot;taps&quot;. I&#39;ve seen sheet music labeled for piano or for violin or for <br/>
clarinet, but I&#39;ve never seen music for drums (but I&#39;ve also never really <br/>
looked). Is is better just to find someone who drums already for a few <br/>
pointers? <br/>
<br/>
He also wants to know the names of the different drums in the set (a six drum <br/>
set with an extra snare). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really ignorant here! Thanks!<br/>

And there are books with CDs out there too if he wants to learn to read <br/>
notation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166622457">Yes, Kelly, there is written  music for drums, youcan find it in books for technique, and there usually written exercises to learn and practice. Visit your nearest music store and ask them or do a search online for &quot;drums&quot; or &quot;drum lessons.&quot;<br/>
Are you opposed to offering the option of personal drum lessons? I know it can be fun and maybe even save your chid some time on learning the techniques right.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also some resources on the net, where your child can start learning the rudiments, rolls, etc., such as:<br/>

Or he could do it the way my older son did while he was saving up for a drum<br/>
kit.  He&#39;d sit listening to music and do all the motions according to what<br/>
he heard and had seen on TV, etc.  By the time he got his kit, he was<br/>
actually quite good.  This is the kid who finally got to take band in grade<br/>
8.  He wanted to play drums, of course, but the teacher had enough drummers.<br/>
So she put my nearly tone-deaf son on the trombone!  He spent the whole<br/>
semester watching the kid next to him, doing exactly what he was doing, and<br/>
never played a note.<br/>

that he was never able to make himself play with others.  Drums are pretty<br/>
boring all by themselves.  (for any length of time)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-261939229">Thanks everyone for your advice on drumming. We&#39;re doing a bit of everything <br/>
suggested. My dad even found two videos of drumming! <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the info!<br/>
