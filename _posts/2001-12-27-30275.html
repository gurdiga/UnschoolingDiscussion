<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914140748">Hello,<br/>
  I was reading Melinda in Illinois dilemma with her sister about vaccines.<br/>
I know how annoying this can seem.<br/>
Anyway, I think that your sister is just fearful and concerned about your<br/>
kids, so as much as a pain as that may be, she probably has good intentions,<br/>
not just trying to annoy you.<br/>
My entire life, I have been blasted with unwanted medical knowledge and<br/>
concern, but I have just learned to appreciate the person concerned for my<br/>
family and say, oh, thank you, and as time goes by, things work out, and<br/>
some of my families biggest critics have changed their views. This goes for<br/>
homeschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
