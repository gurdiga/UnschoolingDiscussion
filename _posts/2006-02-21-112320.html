<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096827693">I first want to thank whoever it was that posted their kids&#39; video links on<br/>
dropshots.  Damien put his short film &quot;The Insulter&quot; on there in<br/>
installments.  Here&#39;s the link if you&#39;d like to see it:<br/>
www.dropshots.com/yargen .  It&#39;s in installments, so start at the bottom and<br/>
work your way up.  We made this short film while on vacation recently and it<br/>
was a lot of fun.  He&#39;s started work on another film with the working title<br/>
&quot;The Easter Mystery&quot; about the Easter bunny being upset that Christmas is<br/>
the big holiday of the year so he goes to drastic measures to ruin<br/>
Christmas.  Enjoy!<br/>
