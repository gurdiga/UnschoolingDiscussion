It bothered me, but at the time I was tandem nursing I had friends all around <br/>
me (five? six?) who were doing it merrily, with no problems (one show-off had <br/>
TWINS as the older kids.<br/>
<br/>
Then a bit later I had one friend who tried it and had the same trouble I did <br/>
exactly.  I went six months after Marty was born, but it was REALLY really <br/>
hard to nurse Kirby.  I bought him off with a Ninja Turtle costume when he <br/>
turned three.  Leonardo.  It had a great sword.  He still has most of that costume. <br/>
 Bummer it&#39;s three-year-old size.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486805036">I loved tandem nursing.  I found it wonderful.  I did not like nursing <br/>
the two at the same time, but I did like nursing my younger one and then <br/>
nursing my older one.  I had fewer problems with engorgement.  There are <br/>
so many reasons to continue to nurse past 2 years, I can&#39;t even name <br/>
them all.  I think for me, the major surgery Lexie had at age 3, where <br/>
she recovered in half the time, and even the doc said it was likely <br/>
because she was still nursing and had breastmilk after surgery. <br/>
 Toddlers and preschoolers who nurse to sleep go to sleep easily.  It <br/>
reconnected me to my children after a long day.  When Janene weaned at <br/>
four, I felt it was early weaning, and was sad.  When Lexie had surgery <br/>
last year, we all realized it was her first surgery without breastmilk <br/>
and I actually got some breastmilk from the milk bank to use, but she <br/>
didnt&#39; like the taste (it&#39;s pasterized, and it wasn&#39;t mommy&#39;s milk). <br/>
 There is a lot of stuff out on the web about long term nursing...<br/>

&gt; Betsy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t find it very irritating. Like Joylyn, I have seen so many <br/>
benefits from it that even though there were times when it was <br/>
difficult, I have found it overall to be beneficial. As with anything <br/>
in life, there have been tough times in our tandem nursing journey, <br/>
and times of great joy. It&#39;s a relationship, like any other. I&#39;m glad <br/>
I didn&#39;t leave my husband every time I found him irritating too :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some of the benefits I found in tandeming were that I could get both <br/>
of them to sleep at the same time (woohoo! big mommy benefit) and <br/>
that often allowed me to take naps when they both were napping. They <br/>
recovered more easily from sickness, and neither of them gets sick <br/>
very often. When we&#39;ve gone through serious health problems (my son&#39;s <br/>
serious allergies at age 4, when there were very few foods he could <br/>
eat), the breastfeeding suddenly became hugely important. He was <br/>
getting excellent nutrition through breastmilk when he had a very <br/>
limited diet, and I was able to comfort him when he was feeling very <br/>
sick, covered with hives, etc. Of course, that meant for a long time <br/>
that I had to also avoid every food he was allergic too. Ever had a <br/>
rice noodle and rice cheese casserole? Blech! I couldn&#39;t have <br/>
foreseen these upcoming issues when he was 3 and his sister was born, <br/>
so I&#39;m very glad that I continued the nursing relationship with him <br/>
so that it was available at that time. There were many more emotional <br/>
benefits too. Non-existant sibling rivalry when my 2nd was born, and <br/>
a very close tie between the two. My son never felt that he was <br/>
displaced or denied something that was so important to him because of <br/>
his little sister. Now that he&#39;s old enough to tell me how important <br/>
nursing was to him, I can see how that could&#39;ve been very hard for <br/>
him to deal with if I&#39;d weaned him when she was small.<br/>
<br/>
And FWIW, I haven&#39;t found LLL leaders to be the best source of info <br/>
and support for nursing older kids. All the leaders I personally know <br/>
weaned at 3 or 4. I have yet to meet one who let their child wean <br/>
naturally. Some of the ones I know did some pretty egregious things, <br/>
IMHO, like promising a 3 year old a weaning party with presents if <br/>
they weaned. Then the day after the party they have a sobbing 3 year <br/>
old who just didn&#39;t understand he was really going to have to give up <br/>
the single most important thing in his life. To me, that feels <br/>
manipulative, underhanded, and icky and very non-respecting of the <br/>
child. If, for some reason, I ever did have to initiate weaning, I&#39;d <br/>
hope to do it with honesty and forthrightness and honor the child&#39;s <br/>
grieving over the loss. So, at least in my experience, if you&#39;re <br/>
looking for support for nursing a child over age 3 or 4, look <br/>
elsewhere than LLL.<br/>

<br/>
YIKES!<br/>
<br/>
The LLL leaders here didn&#39;t do anything to press their kids to wean that I <br/>
saw.  Several tandem nursed pretty joyfully!<br/>
<br/>
Me, though, when Kirby was nearly three and Marty was an infant, when Kirby <br/>
latched on there was a wave of revulsion, at a biochemical level.  It was a <br/>
CLEAR signal to ME not to do it, but intellectually I really really wanted to.  I <br/>
felt bad enough about bringing Marty in without cutting Kirby off, so I tried <br/>
all manner of tricks and tools, and talked to moms who were doing it fine, to <br/>
try to see if I could change my response, but it was physical.   As soon as <br/>
Marty latched on, my body went all soft and the right hormones came, and it was <br/>
just perfect.  Kirby, one second later, I was having violent visions of <br/>
getting him OFF me.  Freaky and very sad for me.  I know one other mom who had that <br/>
happen.  She was sad too, and tried a few months anyway too.  <br/>
<br/>
I went six whole months, but near the end of it told him I was really sorry <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t feeling so good, what else could we do?  We made a deal about a <br/>
Ninja Turtle costume, and I rocked him to sleep every night for WEEKS (maybe <br/>
months) singing &quot;Kirby&#39;s Magic Horse Song,&quot;  It was The Ash Grove (the tune), <br/>
which has really long, slow lines and gave me a chance to think of a next line.  <br/>
They were all ad libbed, but the same theme.  They involved Kirby getting a <br/>
magic flying horse for his birthday, and going on adventures to help other <br/>
people.  And every time, the people they helped happened somehow to have Ninja <br/>
Turtle toys and let Kirby have one or two of them out of gratitude for his <br/>
generous help.<br/>
<br/>
Once a truck was broken down, and Kirby and his horse helped the driver, and <br/>
the truck was full of Ninja Turtle toys.  Once they helped someone who worked <br/>
at WalMart who gave him... a Ninja Turtle toy.  Once there was a cabin in the <br/>
mountains...<br/>
<br/>
He would fall asleep in the nursing place, without the nursing.<br/>
<br/>
(I went to Kirby&#39;s diary file to deposit that, but enough details were <br/>
already in there.  I found this, though, and will throw it in the hopper here.)<br/>
<br/>
July 15, 1990,  Kirby’s nearly four years old.  He woke up saying he had a <br/>
dream (he’s good at telling dreams) that I wasn’t in.  He said daddy wasn’t <br/>
there and I wasn’t there, just him and Marty and they didn’t call us because <br/>
they didn’t want us.  They were playing all by themselves and they weren’t <br/>
scared.  They were outside at a house that wasn’t our house and it was far away. <br/>
Then Kirby was playing  all by himself and he wasn’t scared but Marty was <br/>
playing all by himself and he was crying so Kirby went to find me and we were <br/>
looking for Marty but we couldn’t find him.  I asked, “Was I scared?”<br/>
<br/>
“No, because you were with Keith.” [‘Teef’ as he said]<br/>
<br/>
“Was it a scary dream or a good dream?”<br/>
<br/>
“It was a happy dream.  Then I was looking for Marty and then I opened my <br/>
eyes and I was in my house and my dream was gone.  That’s how dreams end.  How <br/>
dreams start is you close your eyes and then moving pictures come and then <br/>
that’s your dream.  Then at the end there are pictures.”<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe it was happy because he had lost Marty... but they&#39;re older now and do <br/>
pretty well together. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

months.  Some mothers do wean their children, I recognize that but there are chil<br/>
dren who naturally wean on their own much earlier than four, five or six.<br/>
<br/>
I nursed all of my children, until THEY were ready to stop.  It always felt <br/>
&quot;too soon&quot; to me, but none of them were over two years old.  Sometimes I felt <br/>
it was more a grieving process for ME that the special time was over more than <br/>
it was for the child.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m one of those people who cannot fathom nursing a five or six <br/>
year old child, anymore than I would think of handing them a bottle at that age. <br/>
 I&#39;ve read the posts and tried to understand why/how nursing continues up to <br/>
that age.  My nephew did it, I&#39;m trying to understand it but still admit I <br/>
would find it odd for a five or six year old to be suckling at his/her mothers <br/>
breast.  I know this is just my personal hangup for some reason and I&#39;m trying <br/>
to dismiss the oddness of it from my mind but just haven&#39;t been able to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked myself every question I can think of to try and determine WHY I <br/>
don&#39;t think I could/would do that but I don&#39;t really get any answers, other than <br/>
it seems really ewwwwwwwwww to me to have my big child latched onto my <br/>
breast.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have/do nurse these older children at what age would you <br/>
consider it NOT to be OK?  Or is there ever any arbitrary age?  Is it really <br/>
for nourishment or is it mostly for comfort?  Is it just for special time with <br/>
mother and child after a busy day, a time for sure you come together?<br/>
<br/>
Are other people very supportive of this?  I know my sister didn&#39;t get much <br/>
support.  I didn&#39;t say anything to her about nursing Dan at six in front of a <br/>
house full of people but I DID think it odd.  For nothing other than I would <br/>
not expose myself fully to a house full of guests and be comfortable just <br/>
chatting away at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying at all to say you shouldn&#39;t be doing this, I&#39;m just trying to <br/>
understand it and maybe get rid of some of the yucky feeling that it brings up <br/>
when I think of it.  I don&#39;t know where they come from so it must mean they <br/>
are not valid and I&#39;m trying to work on that aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows I might have grandchildren one day that want to nurse long term and <br/>
I&#39;d like to be positive and supportive if it ever comes up.<br/>

I can&#39;t personally imagine a six month old really weaning unless <br/>

Raine replies: My daughter weaned herself at 8 mos. because I cut my hair. I had very long hair which she held onto while she nursed, and I (unthinkingly) cut it quite short... That was it! She wanted nothing to do with nursing after that! I felt just awful... :o(<br/>
An interesting side-note... she now has very long hair herself (she&#39;s 10).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a lot of people confuse nursing strikes or distractibility <br/>
with weaning. Often, a baby will go on a nursing strike for one <br/>
reason or another. This can be caused by something traumatic <br/>
occurring, even something as simple as a mom yelling loudly when a <br/>
baby bites, a mom wearing different clothes, or smelling different. <br/>
It can also be caused by the baby teething or by many other things. <br/>
Nursing strikes can last hours, or days, or even a week or more, but <br/>
I know many moms who have successfully gotten the baby back to the <br/>
breast after a nursing strike. The thing is, if a baby goes to <br/>
bottles from the breast, child-led weaning hasn&#39;t occurred. A change <br/>
in preference or ease of eating has occurred. A child who is old <br/>
enough to wean will have already given up liquid nourishment like <br/>
formula not just switching the method of conveyance (breast to <br/>
bottle). <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, lots of moms confuse the 8 - 12 month distractibility <br/>
phase with weaning. I&#39;ve nursed two babes through that time period <br/>
and yes, they are much more distractible during that timeframe and <br/>
sometimes even hard to get *to* the breast. It&#39;s an easy time to <br/>
*wean them* either on purpose or inadvertantly, but it&#39;s not a <br/>
natural age for weaning either. At that point, they have been weaned, <br/>
either on purpose or by the mother confusing distractibility with <br/>
weaning, but they aren&#39;t weaning themselves. A child without formula <br/>
available (as in indigenous peoples) could not be weaned at this age <br/>
and easily survive.<br/>

Ack, sorry you met the wrong LLL Leaders but please don&#39;t paint them all <br/>
with the same brush. I have met many and all of the ones I have known well <br/>
have weaned naturally, including one who first tandem nursed babies with a <br/>
3-y.o. and then the twins with an infant. I have also met some who did just <br/>
as you descibe and I found it shocking not only that they would do this but <br/>
talk about it after :-P<br/>
<br/>
Both of my older sons weaned when I was pregnant though I was hoping to <br/>
tandem nurse, especially with my oldest who was only (only :-) 2years 9 <br/>
months when his brother was born. Eric (second child) was almost four when <br/>
he weaned but I still didn&#39;t expect it. Simon is still nursing at four - <br/>
he&#39;s four today.<br/>

should the mother continually try to get the baby back on the bottle?   Is is <br/>
about the breast milk itself?  that it is so much better for the baby?  Heck, <br/>
pump it and put it in a cup.   If you pumped during the strike, your milk <br/>

be it.  <br/>
<br/>
  To me, a nursing strike would be a definite sign of natural weaning.  To <br/>
strive to convince the baby that it DOES want to nurse seems unnatural.   It <br/>
almost seems like the Mom saying.. &quot;oh, but yes, you do want to nurse, you need <br/>
to, you just don&#39;t know it&quot;    Whats the difference in that and a mom saying. <br/>
&quot;oh, but you need to sleep in your own bed, you want to, you just don&#39;t know <br/>
it&quot;?  Or, &quot; oh, you need to follow this curriculum( read this book, eat this <br/>
food, play this game, take this class.. etc etc), it&#39;s better for you, you just <br/>

It&#39;s a situation where the baby doesn&#39;t want to nurse *right now* for<br/>
whatever reason (mother yelling or cutting her hair for instance).<br/>

&lt;g&gt;  I encouraged the child who went on the nursing strike to switch to a<br/>
bottle when he was a year and a half because he wanted to take it with him.<br/>
OUCH!  (I think I would have tried other things now, but that was then.)  He<br/>
threw his bottle into the garbage when he was three.  He was ready then.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s about the breast milk.  It&#39;s about the natural comfort nursing provides<br/>
a non-stiking baby.  Have you ever seen how fast a nursing toddler with a<br/>
cut lip stops crying once they start nursing?  And how fast the bleeding<br/>
stops?  There are all kinds of reasons to want to be absolutely sure that<br/>
the child is weaning rather than not nursing for some other reason.<br/>

months old.  He went from nursing around the clock (no solid food, <br/>
bottles or any other substitutes) to refusing the breast for almost <br/>
24 hours.  I absolutely tried to &quot;get him to nurse.&quot;  Partly because <br/>
my breasts were about to explode, and partly because I was worried <br/>
that he&#39;d get dehydrated- he also refused water from a cup.<br/>
The next day he picked up where he left off, nursing <br/>
enthusiastically and often and continued until two months shy of his <br/>
third birthday.  His 24 hour &quot;strike&quot; is still a mystery to me.<br/>

comfort.  The WHO (World Health Organization) recommends that a child&#39;s primary <br/>
source of nutrition should be breast milk until the age of 1 year.  And <br/>
should continue at least until the age of two. <br/>
<br/>
For me it is not a &quot;weird&quot; thing.  It isn&#39;t like he started breastfeeding at <br/>
age 4 or something.  IT has been a relationship from birth.  I am not sure you <br/>
can put an age on it.  I think it depends on the mother and child.  Every <br/>
relationship is different.  For us it is the most natural thing in the world.  My <br/>
son only nurses at night now so not many people see him nursing but at the <br/>
age of 3-4 he was still nursing in public and no one has ever said anything.<br/>
<br/>
When flying from Germany my oldest was 3 and my youngest about 6 months and I <br/>
tandem nursed on the plane.  Was thinking I might get some funny looks but no <br/>
one said anything.  The flight attendant even said how cute it looked, both <br/>
sleeping at the breast.  I will say it is really difficult to be discreet and <br/>
tandem nurse, however.  LOL<br/>

young?  Too young to stop drinking breast milk, or too young to stop nursing at <br/>
the breast?  Babies are often weaned to a cup with formula  at 8 months.   How <br/>
can you determine when a child is going on a nursing strike, or just <br/>
naturally ready to stop nursing?   I would say, if it takes weeks or months to get the <br/>
baby back to nursing, that is manipulating the child to go back to the <br/>
breast.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t like a mother is there trying to pay the child to nurse.  But at <br/>
that age there is still such a desire to suck for comfort and such a need for the <br/>
nutrition.  If the baby is crying it would seem more natural to me to try to <br/>
get it to nurse than to try to get it to suck on a pacifier.  Or if the baby <br/>
is hungry it would be a more natural thing to try to get him to nurse than to <br/>
take a bottle or a cup.  My boys were not very good at a cup at 8 months.  <br/>
Never did master the &quot;sippy cup&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I should say I have never had to deal with a nursing strike myself only <br/>
through my clients as a lactation consultant.  There are such benefits for baby <br/>
from the breastmilk and such benefits to the mother&#39;s health from the nursing.<br/>

&gt; Nutrition<br/>
&gt; Pam G<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can definitely understand the nutrition thing.  And even the long term <br/>
benefits ( over the age of 1)     The thing I do not understand is why it would <br/>
take weeks or months for a baby to get over a &quot;nursing strike&quot;.    And even if a <br/>
child did not want to nurse for that period of time.. Wouldnt they indicate <br/>
at some point that they did want to nurse again without the mother having to <br/>
&quot;be successful at getting them back to the breast&quot;?  I know that breast milk is <br/>
supply and demand.. no nursing mother would go completely dry in a few weeks.  <br/>
ESPECIALLY if she were pumping and offering the milk in a cup.   Why would it <br/>
be such an effort if the child really was just not interested nursing &quot;right <br/>
now&quot;  Wouldnt they eventually come back to the breast if they wanted to?<br/>
<br/>
I know Pam and she is such an easy going person, I can easily imagine her <br/>
boys  going through a non nursing jag and she would just let it slide by til when <br/>
and if they wanted to nurse again.   Just like she is not concerned about her <br/>
son still nursing at 6, she wouldn&#39;t freak out if he wanted to stop at 8 mos <br/>
( even it was just for a while).  Pam, correct me if Im wrong here.  <br/>
<br/>
    Maybe I am misinterpretting &quot;getting the baby back to the breast&quot;   <br/>
Especially after weeks or months.. Hours and days, I can understand.. you just keep <br/>
offering the breast til the baby accepts.. or you wait them out til they <br/>
indicate they want to nurse.   But after weeks??   What I imagine ( and since I <br/>
dont personally know the original poster, and now I cant even remember who is <br/>
was) is a mother pressing and trying and putting forth all kinds of effort to <br/>
get a baby to accept the breast again even after they have shown for an extended <br/>
period of time that they do not want to nurse.   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have you ever seen how fast a nursing toddler with a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> A toddler usually stops crying if the mother picks them up and comforts them <br/>
too.  I guess as it is with everything else it&#39;s really up to the mother and <br/>
the child to determine what works best for them.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to cry when anything is in your mouth.  I guess that statement <br/>
could reflect giving a child a pacifier or them using their thumb for comfort or <br/>
grabbing their favorite blankie.  Whatever it is that comforts that particular <br/>
child would work.  For some the mother feels comfortable putting them to the <br/>
breast and encouraging that, another might just pick them up and cuddle them.  <br/>
Yet another child might quiet themselves with their blankie or pacifier.<br/>
<br/>
Again, one of those instances where it&#39;s not a set in stone way for everyone.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Is it really for nourishment or is it mostly for comfort?  Is it just for <br/>
special time<br/>
<br/>
with mother and child after a busy day, a time for sure you come together? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is stuff in there.  Sedative stuff.  And for the mom too, there is a <br/>
stupifying effect along with letdown WHEN it&#39;s working ideally.  Some moms don&#39;t <br/>
seem to obtain that benefit.  Without it I could never have sat in one place <br/>
for thirty minutes.  With it, I could sit lovingly and patiently with a baby <br/>
for an hour.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Babies are often weaned to a cup with formula  at 8 months. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why and where? <br/>
<br/>
It really is worth trying to discover (from observation, reading, instinct or <br/>
communication with an infant, which is possible for some people if they&#39;re <br/>
careful and they have that kind of talent) what is natural and what is right.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I would say, if it takes weeks or months to get the <br/>
baby back to nursing, that is manipulating the child to go back to the <br/>

<br/>
Did someone say weeks or months and I missed it?<br/>
I think it&#39;s hours or a day.<br/>

anywhere they can drink from a cup and don&#39;t want a bottle any longer.  Landon <br/>
was totally off of a bottle by  9 months.   <br/>

Yes, in the original post someone said friends of thiers had babies on a <br/>
nursing strike for weeks or months, but sucessfully got them back to the breast.   <br/>
 I don&#39;t even contest a couple of weeks of a &quot;nursing strike&quot;  its the <br/>
extended time that seems odd to me to keep trying to get them back to the breast<br/>

Not just needing comfort.  Injured.<br/>
<br/>
Nursing a child with a cut lip provides clean pressure on the wound, and a <br/>
sedative.<br/>
