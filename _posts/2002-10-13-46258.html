<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know many parents who do get nervous along the way. Whether they unschool <br/>
or do school at home. Some people just question if they are doing the right <br/>
thing. I think it&#39;s a matter of the person. I know people who question every <br/>
day but still do a great job. Sometimes it goes in spurts and some people, <br/>
like me, are just so comfortable with it all, they don&#39;t even bother to <br/>
question. I have not yet come to thinking for an instance I&#39;m not doing the <br/>
right thing. And so far, not been nervous about it. My day may come!! I also <br/>
thing it really helps to have a great support system. Whether it&#39;s family, <br/>
friends or a support group. My husband and I joined a local homeschooling <br/>
group, very friendly to unschoolers when our son was 2. He is now the oldest <br/>
being unschooled. I guess we all grew up knowing and seeing it was the right <br/>
thing. That&#39;s maybe why we are so comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
As far as hobbies and such, it&#39;s my family and house. That&#39;s it for me. I <br/>
really have no time for anything else. For me it works. I guess my computer <br/>
is my down time and possibly a hobby. I enjoy it and it&#39;s interesting to me <br/>
all the stuff I run into surfing. My therapy is outside watering the <br/>
grass!!! Sounds stupid as we have a sprinkler system but I go out alone with <br/>
the dogs and stand with the hose and just water!! My husband thinks I&#39;m <br/>
nuts.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 16, 7, 6, and 2. (I&#39;m sounding like a broken record here if you <br/>
are reading all my posts!) My oldest goes to school. I don&#39;t feel like my <br/>
children at the ages they are at, need a lot of time with other children. <br/>
They have friends who come over but it&#39;s not a weekly thing. For us, right <br/>
now, I feel it&#39;s important for them to spend time together. When they get <br/>
older, I&#39;m sure it will be different.<br/>
<br/>
We do quite a few field trips with our support group. My two middle kids <br/>
also go every Friday to a homeschooling sports camp at the local park for 3 <br/>
hours. They wouldn&#39;t miss that for the world. This months so far we have <br/>
done a field trip to the local newspaper and football stadium. We had one <br/>
park day and one yet to come. We also have another field trip to a heavy <br/>
machinery co. and one for Legend of Sleep Hollow. Plus with Halloween coming <br/>
up, we have activities at 3 different community centers and library. My <br/>
youngest is also having a birthday which means the local carnival will help <br/>
us celebrate. So we are active and my kids get out quite often. They hang <br/>
with other kids at the field trips and parks and sports camp, but spend a <br/>
lot of family time at home too. This month was a busy one for us. Most of <br/>
the time it&#39;s a few park days and 1-2 field trips a month. In between, <br/>
they&#39;ll have a friend over or we&#39;ll do outside stuff together.<br/>
<br/>
They also want to do Spanish or French class once a week. They havent&#39; <br/>
decided which one yet. I will set ip up for them when they decide and when <br/>
things slow down a bit, which will probably be next month. Too much for us <br/>
at this age, doesn&#39;t work. Too many days from home and my kids act like they <br/>
never get to play with their things. When they get older, I&#39;m sure they will <br/>
need more time with others and I will provide that. For right now, they <br/>
don&#39;t and I really don&#39;t either. I don&#39;t even go to the grocery store alone <br/>
as there is always someone who wants to come along. It works for us but if <br/>
one needs to get out or the kids are showing signs that they need other kid <br/>
time more, than go with that. You have to just trust your kids to know what <br/>
they need and follow that lead. It just makes it easier if they all are <br/>
social or not together!!!! So far, mine have been cooperating!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s pretty normal. Anytime you reach outside the norms <br/>
that society puts out there, it&#39;s normal and probably healthy to <br/>
question what you&#39;re doing, whether it&#39;s working, whether it&#39;s the <br/>
right thing to do. It&#39;s probably a good idea for everyone to do so, <br/>
but when you&#39;re following the path of least resistance (which in our <br/>
society is school), people are less inclined to worry about it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, probably too many, LOL! But I had kids relatively late (started <br/>
at 30) and had a bunch of things I already loved to do. Some of those <br/>
I&#39;ve dropped or temporarily put on hold (my scuba gear has sat in the <br/>
closet for 7+ years now), but some I still try to do, and other new <br/>
ones I&#39;ve added. Mostly I&#39;ve prioritized down to the one or two <br/>
things I get the most enjoyment out of and try to concentrate on <br/>
those. For me right now, those are doing triathlons (with the <br/>
training that goes along) and writing fiction.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you feel isolated?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but then I am really fortunate in that I live in an area with a <br/>
lot of very active homeschoolers, and that I&#39;ve met an awesome group <br/>
of other homeschooling families that we hang out with. I feel like I <br/>
get a full measure of interesting and stimulating conversation each <br/>
week, because the other moms in my group are so interesting and <br/>
varied! Yes, I know I&#39;m very lucky. But I&#39;ve also put in work to make <br/>
this happen (as have all of the other moms).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;Then, I ask, what is a stimulating environment?! How often do your <br/>
&gt;kids get together with other kids? And what type of activities do <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;do with other kids and families?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think what is stimulating for each child or family is unique. My DH <br/>
and I, and not surprisingly our kids are all very active, very social <br/>
people. So we tend to enjoy things that go along with our natures. <br/>
Our kids probably get together with other kids about 4 - 6 days a <br/>
week. Regularly, we have homeschool singing group on one day, park <br/>
day or (wintertime) gym day on another. We have a neighborhood <br/>
playgroup as well, and then swimming lessons on another day. I try to <br/>
leave at least one &quot;free&quot; day in the week, but that inevitably gets <br/>
filled with some sort of playdate or field trip. Saturdays are <br/>
usually a family-only day, and some Sundays we go to church, where a <br/>
lot of the kids homeschooling friends go as well. In the summer, we <br/>
camp a lot, usually with other homeschooling families. Often we go <br/>
mid-week with just the moms and kids. This summer, I trained with 3 <br/>
other homeschooling moms for triathlons, so we spent many days at <br/>
parks and up at the lake watching each others kids while we swam or <br/>
biked or ran (ar all three!). We&#39;ve also done field trips to fire <br/>
stations, bakeries, fish hatcheries, etc.  But overall, I&#39;d put my <br/>
family on the very social, very active end of the spectrum. This is <br/>
what all of us enjoy, and every time I try to have a couple of &quot;quiet <br/>
days at home&quot;, all chaos ensues. All 4 of us thrive on being active. <br/>
I think what will work for any given family really depends a lot on <br/>
what sorts of interests and temperaments the family members have, and <br/>
what is &quot;stimulating&quot; for one, would be overload for another.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems like I am walking in circles some days, not knowing what <br/>
&gt;to do, or what I &quot;should&quot; be doing.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is no &quot;should&quot; to unschooling. Do what works best for you and <br/>
for your family. If you&#39;re happy, healthy, enjoying life and whatever <br/>
activities you do, then it&#39;s workgin!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; How did you learn to trust that everything will be ok, that kids <br/>
&gt;will learn what they need to.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I dunno, I&#39;ve always believed it. And both DH and I know for a fact <br/>
that following the status quo of school didn&#39;t work for either of us. <br/>
I don&#39;t think we could do worse than that, so I know we&#39;re doing <br/>
fine, if that makes sense. As for the kids learning, I&#39;ve seen it in <br/>
action. Though we don&#39;t spend much time on academic type things, my <br/>
son has seemed to pick up all of the same stuff that his friends <br/>
who&#39;ve gone off to Kindergarten or first grade do from sitting in a <br/>
classroom all day. He&#39;ll come out with things like &quot;Mom, if I take <br/>
these 12 peanuts, I can give 3 of them to each of us&quot;. Well, that&#39;s <br/>
division folks, and he didn&#39;t have to be drilled with it to figure it <br/>
out. He&#39;s also motivated to do things like reading and writing <br/>
because of his other interests. One day he wrote out a bunch of signs <br/>
for his Lego people, another day he sounded out all the names of <br/>
Pokemon characters in a book. He just does these things because he&#39;s <br/>
interested and learning all the time. The intrinsic desire to learn <br/>
and grow has never been removed. It&#39;s there from birth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am so worried that my kids are going to miss something! <br/>
&gt; Ok, enough questions!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe it would help to sit down and make a list of things <br/>
you&#39;re worried that they&#39;re &quot;missing&quot;. Then you can look at each item <br/>
and either decide it&#39;s silly, not worth worrying about, or valid and <br/>
you can figure out a way to address it. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck! As with all of life, the fun is in the journey. The <br/>
destination is just a mirage on the road. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra Dodd says you can&#39;t claim to unschool since birth because you<br/>
don&#39;t really know the dynamics of NOT sending them to school until<br/>
they&#39;re that age and everyone else&#39;s child is going off to school and<br/>
everyone you know expects yours to do the same.   <br/>
That&#39;s why your nervous!  They are now officially school age!   You<br/>
really are on the spot now!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
But if you pass the first day of kindergarten and their home with you<br/>
you&#39;re on your way, and when they are compulsory school age in your state<br/>
and rolling in the grass in your back yard instead of sitting at a desk,<br/>
SHAZAM! <br/>
<br/>
We listen more than we should to other peoples concerns, but we don&#39;t<br/>
have to.  Let your children show you how to not worry.  <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I have free time, time where Dylan&#39;s busy and doesn&#39;t need me<br/>
around, I clean&lt;g&gt; garden, read, read about birds, watch birds, feed<br/>
birds, paint birds (I like birds)  write poetry (not usually about<br/>
birds).  I look stuff up that I think Dylan would like and then share it<br/>
with him if he&#39;s interested.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to address the isolation issue.  I&#39;ve always been odd,<br/>
liked being by myself, I don&#39;t fit in where we live now, but I have some<br/>
good friends and really, much as I love them, I don&#39;t feel the need to be<br/>
around them a lot.  I&#39;m happy on my own.  I find friendships take a lot<br/>
of energy that I&#39;d rather be expending on other things right now.  I<br/>
don&#39;t mean that in the harsh way it sounds, just my need for<br/>
companionship seems to be less than other folks&#39;.  Maybe you could get<br/>
out with a friend on the weekend,  join something.  <br/>
<br/>
Your kids are little and would probably love just playing in a sand box,<br/>
or going to the park and climbing around on stuff.   If they have toys<br/>
and a yard and a mom who will read to them and games to play if they want<br/>
to, TV and drawing stuff and books, then I&#39;d say you&#39;re providing a<br/>
stimulating environment.  I don&#39;t think you need to worry about getting<br/>
them to the Met or the Art Institute of Chicago just yet. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan had a three regular friends that he&#39;d get together with, but they<br/>
all moved away at about the same time when he was almost seven.  After<br/>
that I offered to watch other moms kids after school for a few hours so<br/>
Dylan would have company.   Lots of moms are looking for nice kids to<br/>
introduce their own kids too, not just homeschooling moms.  You might<br/>
meet some at the park once or twice a week.  Your kids will let you know<br/>
when they want to be with other kids. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; after all of the reading I&#39;ve done, I still am somewhat scared. I am <br/>
&gt; so worried that my kids are going to miss something! <br/>
&gt; Ok, enough questions!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that part is hard because we have really heard about the importance<br/>
of school.  You just need to keep reinforcing what you already know. <br/>
Being in contact with people who think like you do will help.  This list<br/>
and others if you can stand all that reading!   Print out the stories<br/>
about older unschoolers and read them again if it helps.  Look at your<br/>
happy kids!   Remember people are learning creatures.  They were learning<br/>
before they ever thought of school.  Look at how much your little kids<br/>
know right now.  <br/>
<br/>
Eat chocolate.  That always helps. <br/>

Personally, I think it is, but it passes the longer you unschool. Which, by <br/>
the way, doesn&#39;t mean un-parenting. &lt;smile&gt; The first year or so that we <br/>
knew we were probably going to go the unschooling route, we wandered about <br/>
what we should &quot;do&quot; with the kids. Slowly but surely, we&#39;ve learned to <br/>
relax, and stopped worrying about what &quot;things&quot; they&#39;ve learned, and just <br/>
let them live free. To me, freedom means freedom to do &#39;whatever&#39; whenever, <br/>
as long as you&#39;re enjoying it :-D<br/>

conversations to have, music to hear, dancing to be done, etc. Can&#39;t say <br/>
that we&#39;re ever &quot;bored&quot; because there&#39;s always *something* to do. And when <br/>
there&#39;s not...naps are good too. &lt;G&gt; We live wayyyy out in the boonies, and <br/>
love it. We belong to a Spiral Scouts circle that meets twice a month that <br/>
with kids and parents of all ages.<br/>

As Mary says, &quot;Life is good&quot; :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167301251">&lt;&lt;&lt;Sandra Dodd says you can&#39;t claim to unschool since birth because you<br/>
don&#39;t really know the dynamics of NOT sending them to school until<br/>
they&#39;re that age and everyone else&#39;s child is going off to school and<br/>
everyone you know expects yours to do the same. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I have read that from Sandra in the past and this time I saw that statement I thought of a question.  <br/>
<br/>
After my son was born, I was off the usual 6 weeks and then returned to work putting him in childcare.  He was usually there about 9 hours a day.<br/>
He went for the first 3 years of his life. In my working environment, it was the norm to come back and happily put your child in daycare.  It was expected and I really didn&#39;t think I had a choice.  Is that reverse women&#39;s lib?  I had a good education, a good paying job (over $18/hour)that I enjoyed (a mammographer).  How could I waste all of that by staying home? <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s what I thought until my daughter was born.  I decided that there was NO WAY I could be away from her like I had been with my son.  I quit working during the week and pulled 16 hour shifts on the weekend so she would not have to go to childcare and my son could be home all day during the week for the first time.  She was only looked after by family/friends until she was 4 and went to preschool 2 or 3 days a month.  I feel that her early childhood education was more of an unschooling style than my son who attended preschool.  Was she just UNdaycared??  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.....<br/>

<br/>
I personally think you can unschool from birth, only because unschooling to <br/>
me means a lot more than just not doing school. Maybe it&#39;s a new term I <br/>
need, but that&#39;s what I and other unschoolers get out of it. More than just <br/>
educational needs. Most unschoolers say it&#39;s a lifestyle choice and that <br/>
definitely starts at birth with children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the part I agree with; I feel that the mindset of unschooling and the <br/>
knowing that this is your lifestyle can happen before compulsory school-age, <br/>
which can be as old as 8 in some states.<br/>
