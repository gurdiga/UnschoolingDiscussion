Oh I get it now - I&#39;m not a regular poster, therefor my opinion doesn&#39;t<br/>
count.  It doesn&#39;t matter that we&#39;ve been unschooling or whatever you<br/>
want to call it for many years now.  It doesn&#39;t matter that my opinion<br/>
has raised two bright, inquisitive, daring, funny and smart kids.  I<br/>
joined this list the first time over a year ago and was disgusted by the<br/>
attitude of people here - I still am.</div>

And this perhaps underlines why it&#39;s a good idea to ask questions first<br/>
rather than jumping to conclusions.<br/>

(not sure if I&#39;m a regular poster or Unschooling-dotcom moderator on this<br/>
one but certainly red in the face either way!)</div>

Whoa... Joyce is one of the moderators, and she was only merely showing that last post was not a moderated post, just one from herself...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296682095">Ah, did I miss something?  I think this meant that Joyce wasn&#39;t wearing her<br/>
moderator hat.  I&#39;m sure someone will correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry you have so much anger but I think you are allowing it to<br/>
cloud how you read lots of the posts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505668508">No, no! She means she&#39;s not posting as a moderator, just as a regular Joe at<br/>
this point! No offense or offensiveness meant!<br/>
