<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248899418">&lt;&lt;,Yet in the meantime, some kids are learning so much stuff through<br/>
gaming and parents routinely criticize it as entertainment,<br/>
obsessions, worthless use of time, expensive and wasteful and so on.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are so right.<br/>
<br/>
One of the mothers in our homeschool group is having a hard time  ( her words) with her fifteen year old. She ngas him about game playing and he responds in anger and it escalates from there. <br/>
<br/>
Last week, at a teen group in the park, I spent a while chatting to this kid about his games and about the games I play and the games my dh plays. He seemed so happy to have someone take an interest in gaming. <br/>

if so any/all suggestions please? <br/>

I encourage him to play because he has learned so much about strategy <br/>
and has taken one of his games way beyond what I even knew was <br/>
possible, but we are definitely having an attitude problem when he <br/>
signs off. Setting limitations just makes him more angry, but there is <br/>
life outside of the computer game and so much more that we could share <br/>

easily maneuvered finger stuff for him while he&#39;s playing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;so much more that we could &gt;share &gt; together...<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you tried getting into his world and sharing in, learning <br/>
about, the games he loves?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget - if you&#39;ve limited games, he&#39;s going to play like mad <br/>
when the limits drop because he knows from experience already that <br/>
the limits will come back. He needs time to trust they won&#39;t be <br/>
coming back before he can relax about it. If you had been limited <br/>
about your favorite food (like mint chip ice cream) and then someone <br/>
said Okay no more limit. So you ate a bunch and they said &quot;Oops my <br/>
mistake, you NEED a limit&quot; and you got limited again. And then they <br/>
removed the limit yet again, wouldn&#39;t you go a little nuts at first <br/>
until you came to trust that it was there for you *whenever* you <br/>
chose, however much you wanted at the time?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes they are frustrated because:<br/>
<br/>
a) they weren&#39;t successful at the mission (didn&#39;t get to the next<br/>
level, got beat, felt like they were better at the game yesterday...<br/>
sort of like how when peoplel play golf for relaxation and come hom<br/>
irritible because their swing just didn&#39;t go well).<br/>
<br/>
b) they sense that someone is waiting for them to get off and it threw<br/>
off their concentration.<br/>
<br/>
c) they know that they have no one to debrief with after the game<br/>
(they won&#39;t say this to you, but I&#39;ve noticed that if I just start<br/>
asking interested questions about the game itself, they will unwind as<br/>
they describe what happened online). We&#39;d ask questions after a soccer<br/>
practice (sorry to keep using that example, but it works for me) if a<br/>
child came home irritible (was your coach hard on you? Did you get<br/>
tired? Was it too hot?)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for gaming you can ask, &quot;Wow. What happened? Did you not get to<br/>
the next level? Was there too much lag? Who was online today? Anyone fun?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just be a friend, rather than wishing that the child wasn&#39;t cranky.<br/>
<br/>
d) they are just cranky.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids get cranky at the supermarket or while cleaning up the<br/>
ktchen table, we don&#39;t usually worry that those activities are the<br/>
issues. We usually work on helping them through the attitude or emotion.<br/>
<br/>
Same with gaming.<br/>
<br/>
My boys have had periods of irritibility during especially challenging<br/>
levels of games. They might go days not breaking through. That is<br/>
frustrating! But it is also building skills like perseverance when<br/>
things get tough and a willinginess to work hard even when feeling<br/>
cranky. :)<br/>
