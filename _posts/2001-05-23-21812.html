My OT question:<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here know about medical treatment of elderly patients?  I don&#39;t <br/>
mean the actual medicine part but the rude, condescending, waste her time <br/>
because she&#39;s old, who cares if we ever cure this because what&#39;s she possibly <br/>
doing in her life that&#39;s important anyway, part??  <br/>
<br/>
We just went through/are going thru some of this with a medical situation my <br/>
Mom is dealing with and I would appreciate any insights or hints on websites <br/>
to check for elderly medical patients&#39; rights.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom is a very vital, active 68-year-old self-employed, school volunteer, <br/>
Gramma, gardening wonderwoman, active community member, just past her first <br/>
year of widowhood and has gotten her life back on track, person.  She is not <br/>
ready for the old folks home in any way but has been treated badly by medical <br/>
personnel (except for one man who actually did the right thing and may have <br/>
saved her life).<br/>
<br/>
So, any insights would be appreciated.<br/>

How awful for you (her as well). We (children and I) volunteer at a nusing <br/>
home once a week and I could ask for info there, you will probably get it <br/>
faster here :) What is her condition? Hope all goes well for you all!<br/>
