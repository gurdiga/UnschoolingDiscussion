<div id="ygrps-yiv-423241410">-=-&gt; If a parent wants a child to &quot;act better&quot; for reward, they&#39;re <br/>
<br/>
training their children to be dishonest.  To act, instead of be, better.-=-<br/>
<br/>
After someone said &quot;good post&quot; or something to what contained this, I see the <br/>
need to pull it and elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
My first priority is being.  I want my children to BE honest and generous, <br/>
not just act honst and generous.<br/>
<br/>
There are other choices, though.  It&#39;s not just that anyone who isn&#39;t <br/>
generous is always stingy.  It&#39;s not that anyone who doesn&#39;t always see the value in <br/>
honesty cheats and lies all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So as a secondary wish, if someone isn&#39;t really nice, it&#39;s better that they <br/>
act nice than not.   If someone isn&#39;t really very sociable, they should fake it <br/>
for the length of a party or project.  If someone doesn&#39;t believe in <br/>
etiquette and manners, they might at least fake it during dinner at the table with <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Fake it til you make it&quot; is better than &quot;never even fake it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;honestly understand and live it&quot; is even better than &quot;fake it.&quot;<br/>
