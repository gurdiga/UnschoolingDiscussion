 </span></blockquote>Well, we eat meat, so I feel like the proverbial butcher after manhandling<br/>
Mr. Turkey and Ms. Ham. As I was throwing out the giblets (=garbage, in my<br/>
book) I called the kids in and we dissected them first; found the valves in<br/>
the heart and everything. They were suitably impressed, but not enough to<br/>
include the results in the gravy.<br/>

Emily, 6, has taught her grandmother chess, read to her, made her watch<br/>
while she did addition problems, and is now playing JumpStart Kindergarten<br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
We just saw a hawk on the back fence and I made a mental note to keep a<br/>
close eye on the dogs (my 7 lb dachshund might look just like a rabbit) and<br/>
maybe pick up a plastic owl to put out there. I don&#39;t begrudge the hawk her<br/>
dinner, but I would take exception if she decided to pick up some takeout<br/>
from the yard (it&#39;s happened around here before.)<br/>
