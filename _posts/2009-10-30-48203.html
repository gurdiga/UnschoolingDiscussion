<div id="ygrps-yiv-31795159">a while back my 7 year old and I read Pippy Longstocking. He got such a kick out of the part in the book where she wanted to go to school so she could have a holiday like the other kids.  last week, one day that my husband was home we had a fire going, and football was on, and we made homemade pizza.  It felt to me just like a holiday.   can everyday feel like that? have any of you accomplished that feeling on a daily basis?</div>

<br/>
I say, &quot;why not!?!&quot; Even the most mundane, regular days are a gift.  Its up to us though to aknowledge the gift and experience it.  <br/>
<br/>
Living for the next holiday/retirement/break from routine is a sad way to live... and all too common.  Not to be morbid but at the end of my life I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll want to feel that I loved everyday to the fullest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596903098">My husband and I both work from home and have no set hours, and it<br/>
definitely often feels like a &quot;holiday.&quot;  We don&#39;t have anywhere or anything<br/>
to get up and ready for in the morning or any time.  We fit our work in<br/>
around our other activities and we usually have most meals all four of us<br/>
together.  I don&#39;t know if it feels like a holiday every day, but I think we<br/>
are probably about 5-6 days per week feel like Saturdays with a Wednesday or<br/>
Thursday thrown in every once in a while.  :)<br/>

I think we do it about half the time.   That&#39;s not bad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-275651437">Hey guess what?  Every day IS a Holiday!  This website tells you what all of them are.  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone-ta-pott.com/">http://www.gone-ta-pott.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
They are categorized in many different ways such as weekly, monthly and yearly, food related, animal related, etc.  Great site to have bookmarked if you want to throw a party and need an occasion to hang it on! <br/>
