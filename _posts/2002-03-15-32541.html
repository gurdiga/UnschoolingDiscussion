<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782013833">Hi, this is Katy C. from Louisiana.  I post on several groups and on <br/>
the Unschooling.com board.  I have two kids, Bridget age 11 and <br/>
Harrison age 6, who are still in gov. school.  We plan to finish out <br/>
the school year (little guy is getting speech therapy) and start <br/>
detoxing over the summer. DH, Eric, has not totally come around to <br/>
the unschooling concept but I&#39;m working on him. :)<br/>
<br/>
If you have 5 hours to waste, I&#39;ve found a site that has recordings <br/>
of Steve Moitozo speaking about homeschooling.  They&#39;re very <br/>
interesting and have information for both newcomers and veterans. The <br/>
link is www.homeschoolassociates.com.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118272636">Hi Everyone! I am Kathy, married to Paul, and mom to Logan 15, Andrew <br/>
10, Alexander 6 1/2, and Christopher David 14 months. We reside in <br/>
Mesquite, Texas were my dh grew up. <br/>
 We have been homeschooling for 9 years now, and within the past <br/>
several years we have moved from strict school, to relaxed school, to <br/>
unschooling. (I think we have always had the unschooling in us, it <br/>
has just taken time to come out. lol)<br/>
 <br/>
 I have noticed several posts on late readers etc.. and wanted to put <br/>
in my .02 worth. My son Andrew who just turned 10 yesterday was still <br/>
not reading as of January of 2002. He is a VERY smart child and we <br/>
just couldn&#39;t understand why he wasn&#39;t reading. SOOO we started <br/>
getting him tested to find out why. Well, first they did an IQ test <br/>
and he scored a total score of 141. By his IQ he should have been <br/>
reading. lol Well, after days and days of testing they told us he was <br/>
dyslexic. We have worked with him here at home etc.. and it was still <br/>
not doing that much good. However, a few months ago, Andrew <br/>
discovered a book called Junie B. Jones is a Party Animal. He loved <br/>
it! lol Has now read the entire series and has graduated to adult <br/>
science fiction. lol I kinda wonder if he really was dyslexic or if <br/>
he just wasn&#39;t ready yet. At any rate I am now a firm believer that <br/>
they will read when they are ready too. I refuse to push, prompt, or <br/>
overly encourage the two younger children to read before they are <br/>
ready. <br/>
 For now, we will read as a family, tell stories, have fun! :)<br/>
<br/>

Mom to Logan, Andrew, Alexander, and Christopher <br/>
&quot;Some people think we put our lives on hold to raise a child, but we <br/>
know that to hold a child IS life&quot;</div>
