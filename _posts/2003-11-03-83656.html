<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412581893">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d let you know that I&#39;m going to leave the list for a couple <br/>
weeks or so.  My dh will be out of town and I feel like I just need to focus on <br/>
what needs to be done around here -- I&#39;m learning a lot reading the emails, <br/>
but it&#39;s a huge investment of time, and I often find a good part of the day <br/>
gone while I sit and read and respond.  Just need a change of pace, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Amy<br/>
