&lt;&lt; I am assuming that you are talking about the SCA here.  Did you continue<br/>
to be active when your children were younger? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was easier with one than three.  They all had (have) memberships and <br/>
costumes, always, and we had a collection of wooden and metal toys, always.  <br/>
I came across them just Thursday.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been phases when one kid or another wasn&#39;t interested or had <br/>
weekend commitments and my husband and I would trade off.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, the youngest has a new interest (dancing) and the oldest is <br/>
fencing and has just become a squire.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Were you a fighter, Sandra?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  My husband is, though; has been since he joined in 1975 or so.  He&#39;s a <br/>
Viscount and a Count, and a Master of Arms.  He&#39;s still fighting.  He had the <br/>
last of his (most recent) squires knighted in February.<br/>
<br/>
What barony are you in?<br/>

&lt;&lt; We will try something this summer - I just don&#39;t want to deal with<br/>
an almost 4 year old and a 6 year old while my husband is off fighting! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have done a fair amount of trading off.  I go to arts events <br/>
(while he stays with kids) and he goes to wars and tournaments.  Sometimes we <br/>
get someone to stay with kids so we can go to something together (especially <br/>
when we&#39;re singing).  <br/>
<br/>
At camping events, we have often arranged to have something in our camp <br/>
(music, philosophy discussion, some campfire-thing) so the kids can be asleep <br/>
and we can hear them if they wake up.  This coming Grand Outlandish <br/>
Tournament (Memorial Day) we&#39;ll have the big bardic circle (storytelling, <br/>
singing) in our camp.<br/>
<br/>
We have also hired babysitters (after a fashion) at the events--arranged for <br/>
a young teen girl to hang out with the youngest child, make sure they have <br/>
water (our most important thing when camping in New Mexico and hereabout) and <br/>
sunscreen and food and something to do for some block of time, in exchange <br/>
for money to spend at the merchants, or for some other thing the kid wanted.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite thing about it all is the people my kids get to know through the <br/>
group, and the things they get to see.  Holly&#39;s godfather is Sir Raymond the <br/>
Quiet, an armorer, jewelrymaker, publisher.  Marty&#39;s is Duke Artan MacAilin, <br/>
a man of great honor and thoughtfulness.  Kirby&#39;s is now deceased, but he <br/>
studied Japanese swordsmanship (was a black belt in a couple of martial forms <br/>
outside the SCA) and culture.  At events the kids get to interact as people, <br/>
not &quot;as kids,&quot; and they get to do real, useful work alongside adults they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t otherwise meet.  So as your kids get older, I recommend taking them <br/>
(or as soon and as often as you can stand to, if they enjoy it).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318452957">Not too long ago Sandra was nice to send me some links so I could find out <br/>
more info on SCA and if there was a chapter close to us. Unfortunately for us <br/>
there was not. Well, about 75 miles away which is not unrealistic but I <br/>
cannot make it work for now. Gas is so high and my van is getting so old. But <br/>
it certainly sounds fantastic. I know the kids would love it as they are <br/>
already in martal arts and wish they could take fencing. We love history. And <br/>
there is such a large variety of things to take part in. Your children get to <br/>
do a lot of interesting things Sandra. I find your posts about the <br/>
neighborhood kids hanging out at your place to be interesting too. It is just <br/>
the opposite here, there are no neighborhood kids. Viewing other people&#39;s <br/>
unschooling lives is interesting. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the info on SCA<br/>

I knew that your name sounded familiar! I must have read your name in the <br/>
list of BOD members or something.<br/>
I&#39;m in Axemoor, Meridies. For everyone else, New Orleans area.<br/>
We take our guys(3 years old)everywhere with us. The SCA is very family <br/>
oriented and we have memberships for them too.<br/>
My husband fences and fights(not as much anymore due to age and wisdom) and <br/>
I am getting ready to start fencing.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We take our guys(3 years old)everywhere with us. The SCA is very family <br/>
oriented and we have memberships for them too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some places are less family oriented than others, but pretty much, yes--it&#39;s <br/>
something whole families can do.  One of my favorite things about the SCA has <br/>
always been that it&#39;s something singles or couples or families or one member <br/>
of a family or teens can do.  Almost every other organization is designed FOR <br/>
teens, or single adults, or couples, or whatever.  But in this one, it&#39;s the <br/>
activities and projects which are the focus, not the kind of people doing <br/>
them.  The only requirements (besides wearing costumes and behaving as ladies <br/>
and gentlement) are the interest learning about history.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew a homeschooling family (met through e-mail homeschooling discussions <br/>
years ago) and their kids were the same ages as mine, and they took their <br/>
kids to events, and we did too.  <br/>
<br/>
The difference was the mother was a very structured homeschooler.  Structured <br/>
about everything in her kids&#39; lives--hair, dress, food, bedtime.  We got <br/>
together three different times, and the differences in our homeschooling was <br/>
striking.  The mom became my apprentice within the SCA.  She learned FAST <br/>
(not everything from me, for sure)--recorder, weaving, costuming, calligraphy <br/>
and illumination.  She devoured this stuff, was good.   I suggested that her <br/>
kids could learn the same say as people learn in the SCA, and she rejected <br/>
even thinking about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe in part it was social.  Take what you will from this, but she lived <br/>
in southern Illinois at the time, and went to a fundamentalist church.   <br/>
There are parts of the country (the south, sometimes the northeast) where <br/>
there seems to be much age-based prejudice.  I think it must be harder in <br/>
some social settings than others to let teens play SCA or to let kids decide <br/>
what to eat.  They&#39;re related in a lot of ways.<br/>
