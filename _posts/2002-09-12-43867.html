<div id="ygrps-yiv-289721838">Each school day must consist of four and one-half hours. Ga. Code Ann. � <br/>
20-2-690(c)(5).<br/>
<br/>
Attendance records must be kept and submitted to the superintendent each <br/>
month. The records will &quot;not be used for any purpose except providing <br/>
necessary attendance information.&quot; Ga. Code Ann. � 20-2-690(c)(6).<br/>
<br/>
Parent must write an annual progress report and retain it for three years. <br/>
Ga. Code Ann. � 20-2-690(c)(8).<br/>
<br/>
Standardized Tests: Children must take a national standardized achievement <br/>
test every three years beginning at the end of the third grade. &quot;Test scores <br/>
are not required to be submitted to public school authorities.&quot; Ga. Code <br/>
Ann. � 20-2-690(c)(7).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well these are just some of the GA laws that some were speaking of. Seems to <br/>
be they want attendence take and certain subjects taught. Well in MHO, mark <br/>
attendence on some calenders and and say you taught the subjects in the <br/>
hours you were too every day.<br/>
And it does seem like they want testing done every 3 years starting at 3rd <br/>
grade. But the scores are NOT required to be sent in to the school system <br/>
and that means you can be the only one to see them. And the written annual <br/>
evaluation could just show improvement.<br/>
<br/>
The part that really gets me is where they say this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to the Attorney General of Georgia, the local superintendent does <br/>
not the have the authority to require parents to affirmatively produce <br/>
evidence of their continuing compliance with the law in the operation of <br/>
home study programs or require the production of documents. Although the <br/>
superintendent has the authority to &quot;request&quot; such materials, he cannot <br/>
require parents to submit them. 1986 Op. Att&#39;y. Gen. No. U86-19<br/>
<br/>
So what I&#39;m seeing is that you should keep the records but have the right to <br/>
refuse them if anyone asks to see. Sounds easy enough to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Standardized tests are tests given to show a child knows the *standard* for <br/>
their grade level. It gives a timed test in different subject areas like <br/>
reading, reading comprehension, and math. I remember taking the ITBS (Iowa <br/>
Test of Basic Skills *I think*) and I know the public schooled kids around <br/>
here take the CAT (California Achievement Test) The schools use them to show <br/>
they are teaching the right things to the kids, and use the average test <br/>
scores to get government money. If a school has a low rate of passing or <br/>
average grades, they can get grants and other government money. If the school <br/>
has a high rate of passing or average grades, they can get grants and other <br/>
government money. &lt;g&gt; If a child doesn&#39;t *do well* on a test in school the <br/>
teacher *may* go over the scores with the parents and they *might* discuss <br/>
things like average scores and what to do to help Johnny or Susie pass the <br/>
test next time! Another thing schools do if they have consistently low scores <br/>
(all around, not just one or two children) is teach the test. This means that <br/>
the teachers spend the majority of their time drilling kids on exactly what <br/>
they need to know to pass the tests. In some areas this is to the exclusion <br/>
of all else in school. In Georgia, if your child takes the test, you get the <br/>
scores. It will be for you and you only. The problem will be that you will <br/>
see this supposed line up of where your child stands compared to an average <br/>
100 other students. What does that tell you? It tells you that if your child <br/>
falls in the 89 percentile, then 87 children did worse than your child and 11 <br/>
percent did better. It won&#39;t get you extra money, it won&#39;t be reported to <br/>
your local third grade teacher. I guess Georgia, like some other states, <br/>
feels that parents must want to know where their child stands on this line. <br/>
But what does that mean to you as a homeschooler? Well, I guess that depends <br/>
on you and how much importance you place on a test. &lt;g&gt; Just remember there <br/>
are other states with more rules and restrictions and Unschoolers live and <br/>
*survive* ;o) in those! &lt;eg&gt; ~Nancy<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; scores to get government money. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he &quot;standardized&quot; part of standardized testing means that the tests were<br/>
given to thousands and thousands of kids, and then tweaked and retweaked<br/>
so that they effectively divide the testees into different levels. So, a<br/>
test item that was most often missed by overall high scorers but answered<br/>
correctly by overall low scorers is generally taken out of the test.<br/>
<br/>
Think of a standardized system for grading, um, tomoatoes. You would ask<br/>
a series of questions about each tomato (is the color a deep, clear red?<br/>
is the color uniform? it it firm but not hard? is it uniformly round?)<br/>
and you would have it set up so that a tomato with 4 or 5 out of 5 yeses<br/>
is grade A, 3 is grade B, 2 is grade C, and 1 or 2 is sauce. I&#39;m making<br/>
these up, I know nothing about tomato grading but I&#39;m currently<br/>
surrounded by fields and trucks full of &#39;em.<br/>
<br/>
So, a standardized test is intended to compare, and to categorize. It&#39;s<br/>
not really about whether a kid knows the state standards for learning,<br/>
it&#39;s about whether he scores better or worse on a test supposedly based<br/>
on those standards than other kids his age - and the tests are set up so<br/>
that very few kids will be able to get all of the questions right,<br/>
they&#39;re set up so that kids will fail, because god forbid we have too<br/>
many Grade A kids.<br/>
<br/>
I think almost all tests should be criterion-referenced, not<br/>
standardized. Criterion-referenced tests are like your driver&#39;s license<br/>
test - they test whether or not you have mastered a set body of<br/>
knowledge. You pass or you don&#39;t, and if you don&#39;t you can do it again.<br/>
You&#39;re not compared with every other 16 year old who takes the test,<br/>
because that&#39;s not the point. Why does society have this intence need to<br/>
sort kids out into good tomoatoes and bad tomoatoes?<br/>
