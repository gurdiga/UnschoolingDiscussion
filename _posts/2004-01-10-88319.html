&lt;&lt;  I have taken to telling her that I just don&#39;t want to be around<br/>
<br/>
teasing (or yelling or whatever) and would she please go somewhere else.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Hey! You guys are way too loud<br/>
<br/>
you may talk more nicely to your brother or you may go to your room.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask you to think again about that &quot;you may...&quot; construction.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of a nurse asking &quot;how are we this morning?&quot; when it&#39;s obvious <br/>
that she&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
If you word it that way, it says that whatever the child does is done only <br/>
with your permission.  And they have only two choices.   But honestly, they <br/>
&quot;MAY&quot; haul out a machine gun and have the whole thing over with.  They MAY run <br/>
away. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not above and beyond sending someone away if they&#39;re really being <br/>
irritating, but it&#39;s never my finest moments, and if you say &quot;Let us have this room <br/>
if you&#39;re going to keep being that way,&quot; it means &quot;be anywhere but right here <br/>
for now, please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if you say &quot;Here or in your own room,&quot; that seems to be punishment of the <br/>
banishment sort.  &quot;Go to your room&quot; is like sending a dog to the crate for <br/>
being bad.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the best thing when I can manage it is to go out, and then call out <br/>
the offending kid, ask him (I&#39;m picturing Marty; why would that be!?  &lt;bwg&gt;) to <br/>
help me do something that honestly needs doing (so that I drew him toward <br/>
something instead of sending him away from something) and while we&#39;re closing the <br/>
gate or gathering wood or feeding the dog or moving the hose or whatever it <br/>
is, I can say &quot;Are you hungry?&quot; or &quot;Is Brett coming by later?&quot; or just <br/>
something to feel out his mood, and try to see what his problem is without saying, <br/>
&quot;Marty, what is your problem?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
And often just getting some one-on-one mom attention is all the kid needed <br/>
anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a dog who is a rescue collie cross.  She is a jumper, very high <br/>
need.  Now, two years later, we&#39;ve discovered a pattern to her jumping.  <br/>
She jumps the fence (a 6 foot fence easy) when I haven&#39;t been paying <br/>
enough attention to her.  She doesn&#39;t jump on weekends, when I&#39;m home.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t jump when it&#39;s cold out, or raining.  <br/>
<br/>
I notice a similar trend with the girls.  When we get too busy (as we <br/>
did with Mark&#39;s recent accident) we seemed to be having more break downs <br/>
(although the girls didn&#39;t jump the fence).  Just making the time a few <br/>
times a day to cuddle and read and talk seems to make things easier for <br/>
everyone. <br/>

*************************************************<br/>
And I&#39;ve noticed, most of the time, that if I&#39;m in a good mood, or if I can <br/>
even fake it (push myself out of a slump) the kids get along much better.  When <br/>
I&#39;m grouchy, tired, worn out, or sick, all hell breaks loose and they argue <br/>
much more (7 in the house).  I believe naps for me is one of the single most <br/>
important things I can do!  So even if I&#39;m feeling like sludge, if I can speak <br/>
in a sweet, kind voice to them, listen when they have something to say <br/>
(although my head may be throbbing), they will generally get along better and treat <br/>
each other the same way.  It&#39;s really amazing.  <br/>
<br/>
And if things really get bad, finding something different to do, something <br/>
they haven&#39;t done in a while, like baking or painting or pulling out toys and <br/>
games they&#39;ve forgotten about, changes their attitudes easily with no ranting or <br/>
lectures.  <br/>

Our 10 y/o boy has a problem sometimes at stores, touching everything, being <br/>
rambunctious, etc.  The other day we went and before we LEFT and when we first <br/>
got there he was acting this way, so I knew he needed to stay with me at the <br/>
store instead of going off with older siblings (sometimes they need a break <br/>
from him anyhow.)  <br/>
<br/>
He got angry, crossed his arms, wouldn&#39;t stay with me,... I told him, <br/>
&quot;Michael, you seem really grouchy about this.  I can see you&#39;re p.o.&#39;d but you have <br/>
to stay with me this time.  You can be miserable if you want, or you can come <br/>
along and shop with me and have a fun time.  I&#39;m having a fun time either way.&quot; <br/>
 Then I went about shopping, and began asking him to get this for me, or push <br/>
the cart, or look and see if he can find this or that (while I was waiting <br/>
for a prescription to be filled.)  Pulling him aside and then distracting him <br/>
from the whole situation and DROPPING IT almost always works well with him.  The <br/>
dropping it is the most important cause he tends to beat himself up when he <br/>
makes mistakes.<br/>

It&#39;s Marty.  When I think of any of these examples, Marty&#39;s face pops in.  <br/>
Marty&#39;s four year old face pops in now.  I used to say &quot;Marty, do you need to <br/>
hold my hand?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say it in a mean or threatening way, just in a &quot;Would it be better <br/>
for everyone if you and I partnered up and held hands through these next few <br/>
minutes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It would be enough choice and reminder for him to concentrate on acting like <br/>
a kid who does NOT need to hold his mom&#39;s hand.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;d ask it nicely, like you&#39;d ask someone &quot;Do you need a hug?&quot;<br/>
