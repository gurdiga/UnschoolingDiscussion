&gt; go.  <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s never even asked to see the one rifle we do own, which we inherited <br/>
&gt; from <br/>
&gt; a buckskinner friend of ours who hunted and trapped in Colorado and Alaska, <br/>
&gt; and died on an icy night.   His name was Marty.  That&#39;s why Marty&#39;s named <br/>
&gt; Marty.   Still, our Marty at an age to use real guns has no interest, and <br/>
&gt; will not be happily amused to get toy guns for Christmas.<br/>

Eric shot a squirrel. He skinned it, removed the meat, pan-fried it, and ate <br/>
it. We got information from the Foxfire books about skin preservation. <br/>
Unfortunately we used too much salt and alum. Eric has a rock-hard squirrel <br/>
hide on his bedroom wall with a sign &quot;my first squrel&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t personally kill an animal unless I depended on it for sustenance, <br/>
but Eric and dh love to hunt. The positive is they use (eat/hide) anything <br/>
they get. Plus in twenty years of knowing my dh, he&#39;s only brought home one <br/>
deer. I think he just goes to walk in the woods. He tells all sorts of <br/>
stories about what got away.<br/>

He WILL (positively) be very happily amused to get toy guns.<br/>

I accidently wrote nonsense.  Sorry.<br/>

time.  He also just likes walking in the bush, even though he works there as<br/>
well.  But the best thing he ever brought home was a happy surprise.  He saw<br/>
antlers and started circling around to where he&#39;d be able to see the animal.<br/>
When he finally got there, it turned out to be just a skull with the antlers<br/>
intact, a cougar kill probably.  He brought it home, and after looking at it<br/>
for several years, I finally made an awesome basket around it, using the<br/>
antlers to form the bowl shape and leaving the forked part sticking up.<br/>
