<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371371119">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being out there!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Michelle, married to Bob, momma to George (6yo), Theo (almost 3yo), and Elijah (almost 2mos). None of them have ever been in any kind of school. Although I always planned to keep my children out of school, when G was three we thought we&#39;d give nursery school a try, see if he liked it as a fun activity, meet some kids. The first day, I watched as a mom handed over her wailing child to the teacher and ran out, in tears herself. : ( My husband and I stayed with George as he was nowhere near ready for us to leave. When it was time to go outside, we were talking to the teacher about George&#39;s reaction to things that day (he was hating it). She said, &quot;Well, we&#39;ll need to phase you both out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Phase us out. <br/>
<br/>
We never went back and that was our last encounter with school. Phase us out???<br/>
<br/>
Reading posts on this list over the past week or so has been very helpful in firming my resolve about unschooling. I&#39;m prone to thinking those typical thoughts about getting &quot;behind&quot;, feeling defensive to the grandparents, wanting to get out the workbooks, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Just last week, I had a hit of anxiety and did get out the workbooks, some asinine thing about matching up letters. G did one line of it, hated it, we had a big power struggle with raised voices and him removing himself into his room. I walked by ten minutes later and he said, &quot;Momma? Want to do some blocks with me and count them? That&#39;s learning too...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oy. Good thing one of us has his act together!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for being out there with your thoughtful words. You&#39;re helping me clear my head and my children&#39;s path.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am so glad to hear there is someone else out there that has those moments<br/>
of anxiety.  My anxiety level has been building for last couple of weeks.<br/>
Last night took me over the edge.  I am the music minister at our church and<br/>
had choir practice to lead and my husband who is the pastor needed to go<br/>
visit someone.  He mentioned that Barbara would hang around and keep an eye<br/>
on the girls for me.  I had a fleeting thought that they really didn&#39;t need<br/>
anyone (they are 12 &9) but thought what could it hurt.  Well, was I so<br/>
wrong!  She ended up taking them to her house.  She grilled them on how<br/>
&quot;moma does school&quot;  Oh, bless there hearts, they tried to tell her about<br/>
child led learning and about things they do in a day, but kept saying, &quot;you<br/>
really need to ask our mom because she can explain it better.&quot;  My 12 yo<br/>
said the lady gave a look of disapproval and kept grilling.  I was more than<br/>
irate!  My 12 yo said she got really scared.  I think that&#39;s what added  my<br/>
anger.  I don&#39;t like my girls feeling scared over situations like that. We<br/>
had this long conversation about how they didn&#39;t need to tell others<br/>
anything except they are allowed to learn about the things that interests<br/>
them and to talk with moma.  Gosh I was so taken back that I really don&#39;t<br/>
even remember my whole conversation with my girls.  Then the panic hit!  I<br/>
came home and pulled out the library sheet where they can read so many hours<br/>
for an ice cream at Ben and Jerry&#39;s and then the math workbook.  O.K., I<br/>
know what you are thinking.....What was she thinking?  I wasn&#39;t! :( I<br/>
finally settled down.  But the truth is I don&#39;t feel like I do enough with<br/>
my girls.  It is so hard to explain in an e-mail.  Our lives have been so<br/>
crazy for the past year.  We have had three moves and new jobs, etc. I feel<br/>
like I am still settling.  I read about all the neat things others are doing<br/>
and think.... I am such a failure.  I keep telling myself we are o.k. and we<br/>
all just needed time to settle after such a whirlwind in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me vent.  Yours posts are what keep me going most days.<br/>

<br/>
i just wanted to write ya and say that you&#39;re right!  you *are* ok....in<br/>
fact, you&#39;re perfect right now in this moment. :)  <br/>
<br/>
we all slip up and have to refocus our intentions sometimes.  give<br/>
yourself credit where credit is due, apologize when you make a mistake<br/>
and move forward!  we just moved recently (this is our 3rd move in a year<br/>
too!) and we&#39;ve been through several job changes and a bankruptcy.  i<br/>
*know* where you&#39;re at!  give yourself permission to absorb the newness<br/>
of where you are...veg a little, pamper yourself, love your kids with all<br/>
you have.  the *neat things* will come when everything&#39;s settled.<br/>
<br/>
no worries...all is well. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384450948">Lisa, Thank you so much for your words of encouragement. I can&#39;t begin to<br/>
tell you how much your words encouraged me and help me give myself that<br/>
permission I need to just &quot;be&quot;.  You know, I started not to post last night,<br/>
but I am so glad I did.  It is a reassuring feeling to know others can<br/>
identify.  Even though I don&#39;t want others to have to go through what we<br/>
did, it helps to hear others have walked a similar path and survived!  It is<br/>
so easy to drown in the negative around you by others who have no idea what<br/>
you are or have been through.  This list makes the world a smaller place for<br/>
me.    You are right about one thing...these are fabulous people!  Thank you<br/>
all! :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Tracey<br/>
