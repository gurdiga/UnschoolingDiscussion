<div id="ygrps-yiv-800465755">Hey Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
You know I&#39;m starting to think of some options along those lines too! <br/>
(re: foster children or adoption)<br/>
Wow, can I relate to the baby addiction!  It&#39;s unbelievable to me how<br/>
many of my cohorts - many of them past 40 yr.- who are still holding out<br/>
for another baby.  (I&#39;m not yet there but give me a moment...)  I think<br/>
some of us are just &quot;baby machines&quot; and it&#39;s what makes us happiest. <br/>
Even as a child I used to love everyone else&#39;s babies.  Being only 7 or<br/>
8 myself I&#39;d ring the neighbours&#39; doorbells asking if I could take their<br/>
babies on walks.  And I&#39;d just want to sit and cuddle those babies and<br/>
very young children.  It was such fun!  I&#39;ve travelled, have almost 2<br/>
degrees, have various talents/abilities/social connections and have had<br/>
all kinds of &quot;worldly experiences&quot;, yet babies are still my number one<br/>
interest.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m Sonia Ulan (my maiden name)...S.Ulan...SULAN!!!<br/>
I think Sulan must be a real name on it&#39;s own as I&#39;ve tried using it as<br/>
a password or user name on some sites and get refused that it&#39;s already<br/>
taken.  Our family has traced back our family tree to Gengis Khan, and<br/>
other &quot;royal ties&quot; to Mongolia.  (Capital city:  Ulan-Bator)  For<br/>
centuries though, our ancestry has been of Ukrainian descent. <br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t ask for all that but I thought I&#39;d pass on some history.<br/>
(Turns out Princess Diana was a descendent of Gengis Khan too!)<br/>

&gt; I always think of you as being named sulan b/c of your e-mail.! LOL!<br/>
&gt; Anyway,my dh and I decided we will have to do foster care if there is any lag<br/>
&gt; time between our kids being grownup and grandchildren arriving! We are<br/>
&gt; addicted to babies!<br/>
