10.25.02 - Last month, on September 11, Leif Enger, author of Peace Like a<br/>
River, came to read at Eagle Harbor Book Co. I spoke with Leif a few days<br/>
before and we both agreed that we could add little to the cacophony of voices<br/>
remembering the events of one year prior. However,  I told Leif I wanted to<br/>
begin with a few words, though I didn&#39;t yet know what they would be.<br/>
<br/>
On the morning of the reading, I didn&#39;t go to work, but went, instead, to my<br/>
boat. I meant to stay for a few minutes, but I ended up spending the entire<br/>
day thinking and writing. I realized there was something very, very important<br/>
being ignored. Something that had to be said, something that, on September 11,<br/>
2002 would be difficult to say. This is what I said to the audience that<br/>
night:<br/>
<br/>
Hi. Thank you all for coming. I&#39;m Morley Horder and my family and I own Eagle<br/>
Harbor Book Co. I&#39;d like to begin this evening with a moment of silence...<br/>
<br/>
Freedom. Freedom of speech, of association, of religion. Freedom to think what<br/>
we want, to write and to publish what we want, to believe what we want, to say<br/>
what we want, and, yes, to read what we want - in complete privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom is a cornerstone of our America. Today, in a rapidly changing world,<br/>
where fear has arrived in America, we face choices that may fundamentally<br/>
change our country forever: choices to limit personal freedom in the name of<br/>
public security. This is not the first time we have made such choices. Twenty<br/>
years ago, for example, we embraced airport security checks with little<br/>
debate. Recently, we have been told we may not board our local ferries if we<br/>
are not willing to submit to random searches. Next, we may choose to give up<br/>
the right to cross our bridges or to enter our buildings without being<br/>
checked. <br/>
<br/>
These decisions -- to limit our personal freedoms for the security of the<br/>
whole -- will be loudly debated, as they should be. We will clearly understand<br/>
the price we are paying in the loss of our personal freedom and feel the<br/>
security we gain in return.<br/>
<br/>
What concerns me, however, are recent decisions made without significant<br/>
public debate, the unintended effects of which are not so easily measurable.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose -- increased public security -- has been hailed, while the<br/>
unintended result -- erosion of freedom -- has been largely ignored, or,<br/>
perhaps, considered worth the cost.<br/>
<br/>
An example is the Patriot Act, passed in October 2001. The Patriot Act was<br/>
created by good people for a good purpose: increased security for all<br/>
Americans.<br/>
<br/>
Under the Patriot Act, the FBI can obtain court orders to monitor anyone it<br/>
thinks may have information relevant to an anti-terrorism investigation,<br/>
including American citizens who are not themselves suspected of criminal<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
Of particular concern to me is Section 215 of the Patriot Act. <br/>
<br/>
Normally, when a bookseller receives a subpoena for customer information, he<br/>
or she has the opportunity to ask the court to quash the order on First<br/>
Amendment grounds. In several cases, booksellers have successfully resisted<br/>
subpoenas.<br/>
<br/>
Under Section 215, however, booksellers may not have this chance. <br/>
<br/>
Depending on the wording of the order, the bookseller may be required to<br/>
immediately turn over the records that are being sought. In addition, there is<br/>
a gag provision preventing booksellers from alerting anyone that they have<br/>
received such an order, making it nearly impossible to determine whether this<br/>
new power is being used... or abused.<br/>
<br/>
The Justice Department has refused to release any information about subpoenas<br/>
issued -- despite repeated requests by the House Judiciary Committee. We know,<br/>
anecdotally, that subpoenas have been issued. But we do not know how many<br/>
times, when, or for what reason.<br/>
<br/>
Eagle Harbor Book Co. has never tracked customer purchases. We do, however,<br/>
keep certain records required by law. And those records, unless the<br/>
transaction is in cash, could be used to connect a customer with his or her<br/>
purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this law makes us more secure. That is very difficult to quantify.<br/>
<br/>
But our right to read what we want, and, by extension, to think, to believe,<br/>
and to say what we want, in complete privacy has clearly been eroded. <br/>
<br/>
These are fundamental rights that define America, and they are being sold --<br/>
traded -- for the promise of security. Such small, often unnoticed choices to<br/>
limit our personal freedoms -- usually made with good intention --<br/>
incrementally, inevitably, change our nation. Such decisions may be necessary<br/>
in this changed world, but I urge you all to consider very carefully before<br/>
giving your support. A freedom that has been sold is very, very difficult to<br/>
buy back again. I don&#39;t want my children or grandchildren to look back 50<br/>
years from now and say, &quot;This used to be a free country-- what happened?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We will face many more such important decisions in the coming months and<br/>
years. If this or other losses of personal freedom and privacy concern you,<br/>
please, speak with your congressperson. Talk with your neighbors,  your<br/>
children. Write your newspaper. Contact your local independent bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
Please, don&#39;t let decisions with such far-reaching results be made without<br/>
your input.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
A postscript: Leif Enger attracted nearly 100 people that night. He spoke<br/>
eloquently and it was a very special evening for all. My thanks to the<br/>
American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression (ABFFE.ORG) for<br/>
information about the USA Patriot Act. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172740761">This is great Peggy!<br/>
I was just talking with a woman who knows Leif and his wife,(they live just a bit from me)  They homeschool their kids, I don&#39;t know what kind-of homeschool, but he&#39;s a great guy.  <br/>
If anyone is looking for a good read, this is one!  A great one for young adults, lots of great discussion material.<br/>
I&#39;m planning on giving the book out to my siblings as soon as I find them at a good price.<br/>
Take Care, Kelli<br/>
