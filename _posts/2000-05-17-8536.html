<div id="ygrps-yiv-534426439">Hi Karen, I read your comments about the &quot;lack&quot; of wildlife in N.Z. Lots<br/>
of Americans have the notion that N.Z. has LOTS of wildlife (including<br/>
me! So you&#39;ll have to educate me).<br/>
By the way, I&#39;ve never seen a skink or hedgehog in the wild, so would<br/>
find that fascinating to observe.... Are rats and mice a problem where<br/>
you live?<br/>
Take care, Susan, busy mom of 5, Santa Maria, CA<br/>
