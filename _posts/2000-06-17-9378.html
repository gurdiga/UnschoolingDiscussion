 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve heard of and seen the Sling-Ezee but never knew it was deveoped by neighbors of the Sears. Guess they must rub off on people, huh? I have to agree that the NoJo doesn&#39;t fit some people right. I think I&#39;d be happier with something that doesn&#39;t require adjustment.<br>
