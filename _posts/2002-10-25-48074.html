<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571180175">I am not too familiar with this new singer but he seems to be safe <br/>
and unoffensive.  I think her friend Nancy turned her on to him. His <br/>
name is Tyler Dean.  His site is www.tylerdeanonline.com.  Does <br/>
anyone else&#39;s kid like him?  She&#39;s been crazy about him for a while.</div>
