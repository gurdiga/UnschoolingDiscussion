<div id="ygrps-yiv-135319604">It isn&#39;t just a book TO ME Dawn.  Nor is it just a book to other Christians.  It is what we build our life upon, its the values we teach our children, its the morals we try to live by.  It is our salvation.  I think this one sentence is more offensive to me than anything else said on this list beforehand.  It is also the reason that I believe there is true evil on this list.  I&quot;m not a preachy sort but I see pure evil in certain people on this list that I want absolutely nothing to do with.....my mind is much too precious for me to fill in with such hate.  I didn&#39;t push anything down anyone&#39;s throat.......I was speaking to Christians on this list, not you.  I stated that specifically!!! I was sticking around long enough to see if there were any final comments and yours makes me even more sure that this is no place for anyone with a good heart to be.  Thank you for making that even more clear to me.  Again I urge any Christians here that this is not a place for you......this is a place of condemnation, and hate.  Please just look at Dawn&#39;s post and truly look in your heart and see if there is anything of value there.  On a final note, I wanted to thank everyone who privately emailed me and will be joining me on other lists........I look forward to seeing you all there.<br/>

friends and I use as &quot;Ouiija-books&quot;--Zen Lessons--The Art of Leadership.   <br/>
Sometimes we just open to a page and see how it applies to the question or <br/>
problem we&#39;re having.<br/>
<br/>
Some people use the Bible as a Ouija-book, I guess, but it does have an <br/>
index--they could use the concordance to look up the situation at hand.<br/>

Real help. And I have had some ideas challenged.  Notice, &quot;ideas&quot; challenged <br/>
not convictions, not things that are important to me.  But shoot, I have yet <br/>
to be on any list that didnt have arguments from time to time.  Even the <br/>
Christian lists have blown up because someone got mad at someone else or <br/>
someone didnt say something just right yada yada yada.  Its just what we are  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580097773">Dawn, you talk about others being defensive, but look at your response. No<br/>
one has been trying to:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Christians keep beating me over the head with bible quotes.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
as you stated. Rachel was sharing what she had learned this week, the<br/>
conviction it brought into her life and the choice she made because of it.<br/>
Other scriptures shared were relevant to the subjects that were being<br/>
discussed at the time. I have seen people share from many sources besides<br/>
the bible, are these &quot;acceptable&quot; sources in your view? Also, to a<br/>
christian, the bible is much more than just a book like the TV guide. The<br/>
bible is a life guide. It is living and active and has wrought much change<br/>
in many people&#39;s lives. Personally, I believe anyone who believes in<br/>
numerology or astrology is deceived, but I have never put you down for your<br/>
choices in life. Don&#39;t put her down for hers.<br/>

almost always get &quot;Be virtuous and all will be well&quot;<br/>
when I toss I Ching coins. Always have.  Even when<br/>
someone else does it for me. Not what I wanted.  I<br/>
want to be encouraged to have temper tantrums and eat<br/>
chips and candy and and zombie out and get drunk or<br/>
say mean sarcastic things.  Never been encouraged to<br/>
do anything bad by any type of guidance thing. Phooey.<br/>

to manifest one&#39;s true intent<br/>
