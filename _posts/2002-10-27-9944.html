<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101470141">I wanted to come and say THANKS for people being on this list and keeping the <br/>
quiet back room for unschoolers to come relax in when the &quot;May I help you?&quot; <br/>
customer service counter outside is bustling with noise and complaints.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I stayed up too long (in the wheel chair is what I  mean by &quot;up&quot; <br/>
these days), and then in the middle of the night I got up with just the <br/>
walker and helped Kirby get a set of maps and directions for his out of town <br/>
trip, so when I woke up at daylight and there was nobody awake to get me food <br/>
with which I could take my pills, I realized I had WAY overdone it, and it <br/>
had been nine hours since painkillers, and...<br/>
<br/>
So I stayed in bed whimpering and dozing and waking up in pain and feeling <br/>
sorry for myself until after dark and then figured I needed to at least get <br/>
up and organize the mess of papers growing all around me.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly slept on a futon near me.  Not near enough to touch, though <br/>
that would have been nice.  I needed to have room go get out with the walker <br/>
and get to the toilet.  But she read me to sleep.  I had my choice of Henry <br/>
Babysits or Green Eggs and Ham.  I chose the latter.  This morning she read <br/>
me Henry Babysits.  That was sweet of her to offer to read to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think I got my ankle and foot swollen by staying up so long yesterday, and <br/>
so the cast was uncomfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
I really hate the idea of suing a place for an injury, but truly that ramp <br/>
was bad.  Couldn&#39;t possibly be legally to code.  And so at least I want the <br/>
hotel&#39;s insurance company to pay my co-pays and wheelchair rental and such.  <br/>
But I don&#39;t know what&#39;s right and good to ask for otherwise.  So that gives <br/>
me kind of a heartache and headache, just thinking about that.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith/dh would be thrilled if I could bring in some  money to help pay off <br/>
charge cards and recent important car repairs.   <br/>
<br/>
If any of you feel like discussing that, I could use advice, and if nobody <br/>
wants to talk about it that&#39;s probably even better.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby needed maps to Farmington, which is up near four corners (NW New Mexico,<br/>
 where Colorado, Utah and Arizona meet, kinda).  He and four other guys were <br/>
going to a tournament.  A newish card game about wrestling.  Raw Deal?  Raw <br/>
something.   <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re taking my van, and they&#39;re not back yet.  Probably will be back <br/>
around midnight.  The one who&#39;s driving is 22 or 23 or so, has a college <br/>
degree, a real job, an apartment.  I think there are no other drivers.  So I <br/>
told Kirby it&#39;s the others&#39; duty to have someone assigned to stay awake and <br/>
amuse the driver for safety purposes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve loaned our van twice before to Kirby-groups.  He&#39;s not driving at all <br/>
yet, but several of his friends can, and we&#39;ve sent 17 year old drivers twice <br/>
to take groups of kids, once to a movie, once to a party in a neighboring <br/>
town.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you with older kids are all used to this.  For me it&#39;s new.  I&#39;m not <br/>
actively scared or worried, but there&#39;s that apprehension in the back of my <br/>
mind.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, a gallomped slowly into the office, back across through the den (in <br/>
the walker) to show him where state highway maps are, in a filing cabinet (in <br/>
the backest room, where Holly&#39;s room used to be, for those who&#39;ve been here), <br/>
and BACK across the whole downstairs.  I stopped by for the wheelchair that <br/>
time, and I annotated the turn-by-turn directions he had gotten from some <br/>
online site.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had asked him to bring me some food and I had taken pain pills then.<br/>
<br/>
I need a nurse.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
And a shower... :-/<br/>
<br/>
Keith has a plan, but I still don&#39;t feel up to risking slippery tubs yet.  <br/>
<br/>
That is about the extent of my day today.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the couch now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being here so I don&#39;t feel like the only unschooling weirdo in the <br/>
world.<br/>

The ability to sue is what keeps much of business accountable to anyone. It&#39;s <br/>
too bad that frivolous lawsuits have given the idea a bad rep, but in your <br/>
case - well, you really have a case. Find a lawyer friend and ask them what <br/>
would be a reasonable demand. Ask for more so you can settle on less. (If you <br/>
don&#39;t have an appropriate lawyer friend, I do, just let me know and I will <br/>
ask for you).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you should do your costs and pain and suffering and whatever else an<br/>
intelligent but non-foaming lawyer thinks you should do. I really do. It&#39;s<br/>
not like you set them up, or will be claiming pain and suffering you aren&#39;t<br/>
having. That&#39;s real pain and real inconvenience and really not being able to<br/>
even go get your own pain medication because they were obviously negligent<br/>
(and made no haste in correcting the problem, either! Grrr.)<br/>
<br/>
One way to do it might be to take whatever you can get, cover your expenses,<br/>
and then donate some or half or most or whatever you and Keith feel is right<br/>
to a victim&#39;s center or to orthopedic research or some other useful charity.<br/>

get them their learners permits at 15 1/2 and then spend the next year or<br/>
two with them driving us everywhere, in all conditions at all times of day<br/>
on all types of roads at all kinds of distances.<br/>
<br/>
I got my license at 16 and promptly wrecked my car (not hurt and didn&#39;t hurt<br/>
anyone else, thankfully). Lots of kids are probably naturally much better<br/>
more cautious drivers than I was, though.<br/>

Could Keith give you a really good sponge bath? (I mean, make the kids go <br/>
somewhere else for an hour or two so he can really scrub you down.) and take <br/>
a plastic garbage bag and cut a hole in one corner. Then drape it around your <br/>
shoulders so your hair hangs down into the big opening. Put a bucket under <br/>
your head with the corner of the bag that got cut off is hanging into it. Now <br/>
he can wash your hair without water splashing all over. And he can use real <br/>
shampoo, not that spray in crap they had out at the hospital. And tell him I <br/>
said to really massage your scalp with his fingers. And when he washes your <br/>
back, he needs to rub it good too, because you are sitting and lying on it <br/>
too much and you need to keep the circulation going. <br/>
<br/>
Now, who lives near Sandra? Call her up, find out what she likes best to eat <br/>
and drink and go to the store and buy it. Now take it back to her (yes you <br/>
can eat some of the chocolate) and put it all in a cooler right beside her. <br/>
Put the chocolate across the room. &lt;g&gt; Don&#39;t forget to get some nice smelling <br/>
powder or lotion. Nothing too strong or sweet or overly flowery. Something <br/>
nice and calming. She can use it after she gets her sponge bath. My choice <br/>
would be just plain old baby powder. Nothing is nicer than a nice scrub, some <br/>
baby powder and a clean soft cotton nightgown. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry you don&#39;t feel good. I know what it is like to feel misplaced <br/>
and out of joint. And when you are hungry, tired and not feeling too clean on <br/>
top of that, well it just isn&#39;t too pleasant. Make Keith get that loofa out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13779616">In my experience the hotel would probably be glad to pay for your true <br/>
expenses if you just asked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were at Mandala Bay in Vegas when the revolving door didn&#39;t go just <br/>
right and lexie slammed into the glass, breaking her glasses.  She was <br/>
fine, we had the hotel nurse come check her in the room immediately and <br/>
put ice on her nose where the glasses hit mostly, but everyone, the <br/>
nurse, the glasses place we went to the next day and our local glasses <br/>
place said that if her glasses had been made out of glass instead of the <br/>
expensive, lightweight polysomething plastic we would have had major <br/>
cuts on her eyes and around her eyes.  Anyway, her glasses were <br/>
essentially new and now we had to replace the frames...  We went to the <br/>
doctor and she needed a new prescription and Mandela Bay paid for it <br/>
all.  100%.  It was about $300, so not a fortune but not small change, <br/>
especially to us.  We did have to sign a form saying we wouldn&#39;t sue, <br/>
but really, that was not our intention, it was simply to get the glasses <br/>
replaced.  So anyway, I guess what I&#39;m saying is call the hotel and ask <br/>
to speak to whichever dept handles this sort of thing and see what they <br/>
say.  Personally, if they are at fault they should at the bare minimum <br/>
pay your expenses, and I wouldn&#39;t think worse of you for asking for <br/>
more, for pain and suffering (surgery, missing the conference, etc.) <br/>
 Have you spoken to an attorney?  I would.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780399124">Hi Sandra --<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and often don&#39;t have much time to post! Thank good ness for daylight savings time!<br/>
<br/>
I feel for you. I was laid up with a broken foot a bunch of years ago and believe me, I&#39;d take another broken arm anytime. It is just plain frustrating not being able to get around. Re: painkillers and water, can you stash them somewhere really close? And maybe keep some food close as well? That would help, especially in the middle of the night when you wake up hungry and/or in pain. Is there any possibility of renting a scooter short term? They make some really nice model&#39;s...you can even go zipping down the street in them!<br/>
<br/>
Re: suing -- you have been grossly wronged. You have expenses related to the hotel&#39;s incompetence, and you definitely should receive some compensation for &quot;pain and suffering&quot;. They should absolutely not get off the hook free and clear. What will probably happen is that hotel&#39;s insurance company will offer to settle out of court -- you&#39;ve got a solid case. <br/>
<br/>
I wish we lived closer and could help you out!<br/>

  around midnight.  The one who&#39;s driving is 22 or 23 or so, has a college <br/>
  degree, a real job, an apartment.  I think there are no other drivers.  So I <br/>
  told Kirby it&#39;s the others&#39; duty to have someone assigned to stay awake and <br/>
  amuse the driver for safety purposes.<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve loaned our van twice before to Kirby-groups.  He&#39;s not driving at all <br/>
  yet, but several of his friends can, and we&#39;ve sent 17 year old drivers twice <br/>
  to take groups of kids, once to a movie, once to a party in a neighboring <br/>
  town.<br/>
<br/>
  Some of you with older kids are all used to this.  For me it&#39;s new.  I&#39;m not <br/>
  actively scared or worried, but there&#39;s that apprehension in the back of my <br/>
  mind.  <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, a gallomped slowly into the office, back across through the den (in <br/>
  the walker) to show him where state highway maps are, in a filing cabinet (in <br/>
  the backest room, where Holly&#39;s room used to be, for those who&#39;ve been here), <br/>
  and BACK across the whole downstairs.  I stopped by for the wheelchair that <br/>
  time, and I annotated the turn-by-turn directions he had gotten from some <br/>
  online site.  <br/>
<br/>
  I wish I had asked him to bring me some food and I had taken pain pills then.<br/>
<br/>
  I need a nurse.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
  And a shower... :-/<br/>
<br/>
  Keith has a plan, but I still don&#39;t feel up to risking slippery tubs yet.  <br/>
<br/>
  That is about the extent of my day today.<br/>
<br/>
  Back to the couch now.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for being here so I don&#39;t feel like the only unschooling weirdo in the <br/>
  world.<br/>

really go take pictures of that ramp, still wet I&#39;m sure, after all these <br/>
days.  Then what I would do is get a lawyer to write a demand letter, <br/>
demanding that they pay your expenses and fix the ramp.  I think they&#39;d <br/>
likely settle with you at some point, but you might have to push a little <br/>
harder.  <br/>
<br/>
The property & casualty insurance people are supposed to check for that kind <br/>
of unsafe condition before they write policies for big places like hotels and <br/>
such.  I&#39;m sure they would not want to pay a claim like yours over and over <br/>
again, and would make the hotel repair it if they knew about it. <br/>
<br/>
You can have my affidavit that the ramp was still wet even on Sunday, that I <br/>
got dripped on the head by the condensation from one of the a/c units above <br/>
the door, if you need it.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some of you with older kids are all used to this.  For me it&#39;s new.  I&#39;m <br/>

Ha!  I&#39;m used to *my* teen drivers.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;d let someone else&#39;s <br/>

well like you seem to do.<br/>

put Sandra in temporary need of a wheelchair. And I still think it&#39;s <br/>
ironic that Sandra&#39;s talk was &quot;How to Move a Puddle&quot; and there was a <br/>

Sandra slipped.<br/>

Yes, Sandra, I know your feet never touched the puddle, but it will <br/>

Thank you.  He would be willing to.  He&#39;s at work today.  Sunday.  They have <br/>
a BIG push at work to finish some contract (Honeywell) and he has a part that <br/>
gets worse the more the rest of them are finished (testing).  So when he IS <br/>
home my first requests of him involve doing things with/for the kids that I <br/>
wasn&#39;t able to do.  And he shops and brings us food.  That&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
A friend washed my hair last Saturday, the 19th.  She was willing to come <br/>
back to do it yesterday, but I was feeling really bad and slept most of the <br/>

good.<br/>

You guys each spend an extra minute in the shower in my honor.  How&#39;s that! <br/>

Oh sorry.  I didn&#39;t read the rest.  <br/>

I can&#39;t get out of the house. This isn&#39;t a wheelchair accessible house.  We <br/>
knew it when we moved in, and Keith and I joked that we DO need to keep our <br/>
older, smaller house which with just one ramp to the door would be wheelchair <br/>
accessible throughout.  That that would be our old-and-crippled  house.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wish we lived closer and could help you out!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saving all the parts about lawsuit advice, and when the first of any <br/>
bills show up, or maybe sooner, I&#39;ll read all that for fortification and <br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
I do plan to write a letter to the building inspector&#39;s office and ask them <br/>
to go and check out that ramp, see if it was ever approved by the city, and <br/>
let me know if indeed it is an illegal ramp.<br/>
<br/>
IF by the time they get there the ramp is just still sitting unchanged, I&#39;ll <br/>
feel much less guilty about asking for more than my co-pays.<br/>
<br/>
I assume that at some point their insurance company will send someone to <br/>
offer me a settlement--that if I sign  not to sue they&#39;ll give me something.  <br/>
My  husband got $100 for a bruise one time, and a note for a visit to the <br/>
dentist to get whatever he wanted (a filling got knocked out too) when he was <br/>
in a little accident that wasn&#39;t at all his fault.  They gave us $1200 for <br/>
the ratty little Honda Civic, too, which we continued to drive ever after <br/>
(seemed like at the time).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much for the encouragement and cyber-handholding.<br/>

make sure he was at least looking at me or  hearing me.  So they did what I <br/>
asked, but not in such a way that it would have made the whole ramp safer.<br/>

know all about how it happened and whether there was any other insurance or <br/>
if it was work-related.  It was nosey and a pain in the neck to me, someone <br/>
who doesn&#39;t even have a job.  But it was a foot injury, and certain types of <br/>
injuries are flagged in case of a workers comp claim.  But the letter asked <br/>
about vehicle accidents, location, etc.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In a previous life I worked in Human Resources and somehow was saddled with <br/>
most of the coporate insurance stuff.  They (the hotel) have property <br/>
insurance, you should have been given information about filing a claim.  They <br/>
should be clamouring for a way to appease you without a lawsuit being filed - <br/>
it&#39;s easier and cheaper to treat you well on the front end.  So, I&#39;d call in <br/>
inquire about filing a claim.  Probably the local bigshot didn&#39;t want to <br/>
report it to the head bigshot...<br/>
<br/>
Your medical (not just copays), incidentals (medicars, hospital beds, <br/>
anything you&#39;ve purchased to make your life easier) and lost wages should be <br/>
covered, at a minimum.  After that they give you something extra to cover <br/>
pain and suffering or whatever they call it.  The insurance companies all <br/>
have formulas to figure out what to give you.  <br/>
<br/>
The unethical part of this was their continuing a dangerous practice, a <br/>
danger to the general public.  It should&#39;t be much work on your part to get <br/>
what they owe you.  I remember with workers compensation, any time a surgery <br/>
was involved, there was a &quot;permanency&quot; award, because part of that injury <br/>
would never go away.  <br/>
<br/>
Rambling thoughts, just took a painkiller myself - after begging for some <br/>
food.  Hope it helps.<br/>

My insurance company nor the doctors/hospital cared if I was expecting to sue or settle with the trucking company.  They just wanted the copays now.  I would plan on paying those but getting copies of the original bills to send to the hotel people.  <br/>
You really need to get copies of all original bills (before the insurance pays), and all of your medical transcription reports from the doctors.  The insurance company(of the hotel) should reimburse you for total medical costs (again before your insurance co. pays), not just the copays.  <br/>
