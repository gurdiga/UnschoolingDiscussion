<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425938533">rudolf steiner was the founder of the waldorf schools and curriculum. The<br/>
following is a collection of quotes that I came across when I looked into<br/>
the waldorf approach to education.  An eye opener to say the least!<br/>
<br/>
Leslie, who can never resist an opportunity to out the true purpose of the<br/>
steiner/waldorf movement.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Today we study the true essence of human thought so we can train the child<br/>
in the right kind of thinking&quot;<br/>
rudolf steiner<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You see, when we really study science and history, we must conclude that if<br/>
people become increasingly strong, they will also become increasingly<br/>
stupid. If the blonds and blue-eyed people die out, the human race will<br/>
become increasingly dense if men do not arrive at a form of intelligence<br/>
that is independent of blondness. Blond hair actually bestows intelligence.<br/>
It is indeed true that the more the fair individuals die out the more will<br/>
the instinctive wisdom of humans vanish.&quot;    rudolf steiner<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Jewry as such has outlived itself for a long time. It does not have the<br/>
right to exist in the modern life of nations. That it has survived,<br/>
nevertheless is a mistake of world history, of which the consequences were<br/>
bound to come.&quot;<br/>
rudolf steiner<br/>
<br/>
 * &quot;The girl L.K. in class 1...is one of those cases that are occurring more<br/>
and more frequently where children are born and human forms exist which<br/>
actually, with regard to the highest member the ego, are not human at all<br/>
but are inhabited by beings who do not belong to the human race...They are<br/>
very different from human beings where spiritual matters are concerned. For<br/>
instance they can never memorise sentences, only words. I do not like<br/>
speaking about these things, as there is considerable opposition about this.<br/>
Just imagine what people would say if they heard that we are talking about<br/>
human beings who are not human beings. Nevertheless these are facts.<br/>
Furthermore, there would not be such a decline of culture if there were a<br/>
strong enough feeling for the fact that some people, the ones who are<br/>
particularly ruthless, are not human beings at all but demons in human form.<br/>
&quot;But do not let us broadcast this. There is enough opposition already.<br/>
Things like this give people a terrible shock. People were frightfully<br/>
shocked when I had to say that a quite famous university professor with a<br/>
great reputation had had a very short period between death and re-birth and<br/>
was a re-incarnated negro scientist.<br/>
&quot;But don&quot;t let us publicise these things.&quot; (Steiner, 1923, CT-4 pp. 36-37)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Whoever develops himself upwards, takes upon himself a tremendous<br/>
responsibility, that is the great tragedy; the corollary of every saint is<br/>
that a great number of beings are thrust down. There would be no development<br/>
if this kind of thrusting down did not take place. A man must continually<br/>
thrust others down, as he develops himself upwards. That is why all<br/>
development which takes place out of self-interest is evil and<br/>
reprehensible; it is only justifiable if done for the development of other<br/>
beings.&quot;     steiner [1905]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are within the great Root Race of humanity, which has peopled the earth,<br/>
since the land on which we now live rose up out of the inundations of the<br/>
ocean. Ever since the Atlantean Race began slowly to disappear, the great<br/>
Aryan Race has been the dominant one on earth. If we contemplate ourselves,<br/>
we here in Europe are thus the fifth Sub-Race of the great Aryan Root Race.<br/>
The first Sub-Race lived in the distant past in Ancient India&quot; steiner<br/>
[1905]<br/>
<br/>
Though the Nazis banned Anthroposophy, this does not necessarily confer<br/>
sainthood. The Thule Society, another source of Nazi mythology, was also<br/>
banned at the same time. These groups were suppressed as rivals, rather than<br/>
opponents, of Nazism.....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[W]hat the etheric body comprises derives from the maternal element, as<br/>
handed down from generation to generation, so that every man bears in his<br/>
own etheric body the legacy of the maternal element, and in his physical<br/>
body, that of the paternal element. Now, by reason of consanguinity, the<br/>
inheritance, perpetuating itself from etheric body to etheric body, was very<br/>
potent, and from it derived the old faculty of clairvoyance. The offspring<br/>
of endogamy inherited with the related blood the old capacity for wisdom in<br/>
the etheric body. But as blood became more and more mixed--as a result of<br/>
increasing intermarriage among tribes--the possibility of handing down the<br/>
ancient wisdom diminished; ...the mixing of different bloods obscured the<br/>
ancient wisdom more and more... We are, of course, still involved in this<br/>
process of deterioration taking place in the human blood because, in as far<br/>
as it has its origin in an ancient epoch, it will follow its lingering<br/>
course to the end of *Earth* evolution.&quot; (Steiner, 1909, GSJ p. 226)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The German spirit...is prepared for a truth that reveals itself to be true<br/>
out of itself, not requiring external verification. The German spirit is<br/>
prepared for this and evidence of this may be found everywhere. The thoughts<br/>
of those who were truly working within the essence of the German spirit have<br/>
always taken the form of considering truth to be an inner gift of the human<br/>
soul.&quot; (Steiner, 1915, DIN p. 104)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What has to come about for the civilization and culture of the future will<br/>
only come about if the German folk spirit finds souls that transplant the<br/>
Christ impulse into their astral body and ego the way it can indeed be<br/>
implanted there in a state of full conscious awareness. It has to come about<br/>
through harmony being established, by uniting with that which is consciously<br/>
achieved in Central Europe--more and more consciously.<br/>
&quot;This will need not just one or two centuries, but a very long time. The<br/>
time needed...I would say counting from the year 1400. Adding two thousand<br/>
years to 1400 we get the approximate time when something will emerge in the<br/>
evolution of the earth that has had its seeds in the German life of the<br/>
spirit...That is the intention of the cosmic intelligence...For the moment<br/>
the East is very far indeed from achieving this. The very best of them still<br/>
fall far short. Short sightedly, they still refuse to accept what Central<br/>
European culture in particular is able to give.&quot; (Steiner, 1915, DIN p. 62)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[The purpose of the Opium War] is not to help certain people make millions<br/>
and grow rich but to prevent certain souls who would have come from the<br/>
spiritual world round about now, to strengthen the cultural forces of<br/>
Europe, from incarnating yet, and instead to surreptitiously fill European<br/>
bodies with Chinese souls...In a great many European people a disharmony<br/>
between soul and body has been brought about in the way I have just<br/>
described...Seen in this way, that Opium War meant the switching of a soul<br/>
element from a part of the earth to which it belonged--and where it might<br/>
have been of use, because it would have fitted--to another part of the earth<br/>
where it could become a tool for forces whose designs are by no means<br/>
necessarily beneficial for mankind.&quot; (Steiner, 1916, KU1 p. 270)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[T]he ancient Greeks dreamed of a uniform, perfect, beautiful type of human<br/>
being that should have developed. This development did not occur because<br/>
Lucifer and Ahriman preserved older racial forms that had developed, so that<br/>
there was a coexistence of races rather than a succession.&quot; (Steiner, 1916,<br/>
UH p. 76)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[T]he representative people for the development of the consciousness soul,<br/>
hence for what matters particularly in our age, is the Anglo-Saxon nation.<br/>
The Anglo-Saxon people are those who through their whole organization are<br/>
predisposed to develop the consciousness soul to a special degree. The<br/>
prominent position occupied by the Anglo-Saxon nation in our time is indeed<br/>
due to the fact that this nation is especially suited for the development of<br/>
the consciousness soul.&quot; (Steiner, 1921, MTA p. 195)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No doubt about it, the soul becomes corrupted through using the French<br/>
language...It is also possible at the present time that the French will even<br/>
ruin their own blood, the very element which has kept their language going<br/>
as a corpse. That is a terrible thing the French people are doing to other<br/>
people, the frightful cultural brutality of transplanting black people to<br/>
Europe. It affects France itself worst of all. This has an incredibly strong<br/>
effect on the blood, the race. This will substantially add to French<br/>
decadence. The French nation will be weakened as a race.&quot; (Steiner, 1923,<br/>
CT-3 pp. 87-88)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[W]e are not justified in thinking that human beings were originally like<br/>
the savages of today. The savages have developed into what they now<br/>
are--with their superstitions, their magical practices and their unclean<br/>
appearance--from states originally more perfect. The only superiority we<br/>
have over them is that, while starting from the same conditions, we did not<br/>
degenerate as they did. I might therefore say: The evolution of man has<br/>
taken two paths. It is not true that the savages of today represent the<br/>
original condition of mankind. Mankind, though to begin with it looked more<br/>
animal-like, was highly civilized. ... Just as the present savages have<br/>
fallen from the level of the human beings of primeval times, so the apes are<br/>
beings who have fallen still lower.&quot; (Steiner, 1924, EEM p. 126)<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Jewry as such has long since outlived its time; it has no more<br/>
justification within the modern life of peoples, and the fact that it<br/>
continues to exist is a mistake of world history whose consequences are<br/>
unavoidable. We do not mean the forms of the Jewish religion alone, but<br/>
above all the spirit of Jewry, the Jewish way of thinking.&quot; (steiner,<br/>
Gesammelte Aufsätze zur Literatur, GA 32, p. 152<br/>
<br/>
Steiner then insists that racially stratified hierarchy “is simply a<br/>
universal law” and indeed a product of inescapable destiny: “The forces<br/>
which determine man’s racial character follow this cosmic pattern. The<br/>
American Indians died out, not because of European persecutions, but because<br/>
they were destined to succumb to those forces which hastened their<br/>
extinction.” (ibid. p. 76</div>

Uh...<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
But now he&#39;s dead.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, it might be another thing they don&#39;t want to discuss, but <br/>
are there anthropmorphististicists who think they know if or where Steiner has <br/>
reincarnated himself?   That would be fun to know.<br/>

<br/>
Some died out of bullet wounds and smallpox.<br/>
New Mexico has quite a few not at all dead, living where they lived 400 years <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in 1920 it looked like they were going to die out.  But they were <br/>
savages, after all, lower than the original level of humans in primevil times.  Not <br/>
cool and civilized like Germans.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised he still has a following.  The stuff that was quoted in <br/>
positive ways seemed just as crazy and baseless (more baseless, when it had to do <br/>
with &quot;still evolving&quot; after birth, and looking less like your mom if you quit <br/>
nursing at six months, and colors doing whateverall colors are supposed to do).   <br/>
I&#39;m surprised there&#39;s a single Waldorf school, let alone thousands of them.<br/>
