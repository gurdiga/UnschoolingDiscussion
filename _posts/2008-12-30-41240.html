That was nice to see.  When I was a kid if I was sitting in a mess, I  <br/>
was probably crying and my mom was probably  yelling.    It&#39;s nice to  <br/>
see it in a different light.<br/>

Have you looked at clonlara.org?  It&#39;s not better than plain old  <br/>
unschooling, but it might be better than school!   It can put a  <br/>
structure on unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712694408">I have but its more money than I have right now and I don&#39;t think its necessary. <br/>
<br/>
I looked at your page on unschooling curriculum and realized something while I was vacuming. <br/>
He just got finished with 5 long years of college. This took up a majority of his time when he wasnt at work. Now he is ready to jump back in and be the authority figure, Mr Command. <br/>
<br/>
Now that he has more time to watch Courtney it looks like she isnt doing anything. <br/>
<br/>
So I do have ideas and I&#39;ll prob blog about it a bit later. For now I have to get ready to go pick up Alyssa. <br/>
