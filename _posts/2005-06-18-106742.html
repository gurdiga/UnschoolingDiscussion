<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155079263">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to the list and have been enjoying the discussions<br/>
immensely. I have an 11yo son and 2yo daughter. This past year, we<br/>
tried homeschooling and have never looked back. As the year went on, I<br/>
became drawn to unschooling. The more I have read and discussed, the<br/>
more I know that this is a philosophy that makes sense in my heart. I<br/>
know that since my ds has been in school for some time, there will be<br/>
adjustments, and I&#39;m glad that my dd will never have to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
The biggest issue I&#39;m having right now is that every person in my home<br/>
is a right-brained thinker, and I&#39;m the sole left-brained thinker. Why<br/>
should that matter when you&#39;re unschooling? Well, I have been doing my<br/>
best to follow their interests and really stretching myself to try<br/>
things I never would have. I have enjoyed it very much and am glad<br/>
that we&#39;re on this adventure together. I guess that I sometimes feel<br/>
drained when most of our activities are centered around activities<br/>
that right-brained thinkers enjoy, like playing in the mud and<br/>
building. Like I said, I&#39;ve enjoyed things like this, but I feel that<br/>
things can be out of balance because I would love spending the day<br/>
reading or doing quieter activities. I&#39;m not saying that I want things<br/>
my way, but rather I&#39;m wondering if someone can help me see how<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs get met when our interests are all over the board. I<br/>
also want to avoid all of us leading a solitary existence under the<br/>
same roof.<br/>
<br/>
Please be easy on me...I&#39;m new to all of this and maybe I&#39;m missing<br/>
something fundamental to the homeschooling philosophy. I really want<br/>
to make this work. Friends have told me to just let go, but<br/>
left-brainers and right-brainers go about this in completely different<br/>
ways ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all of your input and understanding. I&#39;m glad I found such<br/>
a thoughtful group of people.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-186161827">I would first recommend not defining people as just left-brained or  <br/>
right-brained.<br/>
If you&#39;re not familiar with Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences theory,  <br/>
maybe google some of that.  I think it&#39;s a really helpful model for  <br/>
unschooling.   <br/>
 <br/>
You could maybe think of yourself as a supply officer and be involved in  <br/>
their interests at least at the level of providing materials and opportunities,  <br/>
even if you yourself don&#39;t hang out and do the physical stuff so much.   Find <br/>
them other partners too, maybe--playmates, visitors, opportunities.  <br/>
 <br/>
But if you define yourself as &quot;a thing&quot; or &quot;a way,&quot; it will probably  <br/>
encourage you to see your children more narrowly than is helpful too.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve already found this, but<br/>

 <br/>
Maybe just shake it up every day or two, and do something new.  It  doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to be organized and involve everyone. It could be just you,  yourself, and <br/>
if a kid or two gets interested, great; if not, great.<br/>
 <br/>
I had a really hard time accepting that some of my ideas were of no  interest <br/>
to Kirby, when we were first homeschooling.  It would hurt my  feelings.  I <br/>
reasoned with myself to snap out of it, and I eventually got  over it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
