LOL!  I don&#39;t like Dr. Phil&#39;s advice with regards to parenting either,<br/>
although I like a lot of the other stuff he has to say  .(I actually wrote<br/>
to him last year and suggested some books to him on compassionate<br/>
parenting.)   But last week as I watched one of his programs, I  began to<br/>
wonder if he gives the advice he gives because the parents that come on his<br/>
show have so little parenting skills, that having them pick their battles<br/>
and be consistent, which is what he often advises,  is  a huge improvement<br/>
in parenting for them and it is tangible advice.  Some of the parent&#39;s that<br/>
end up on that show couldn&#39;t even begin to incorporate compassion into their<br/>
parenting.  They don&#39;t even have the basic skills down.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I still think he is doing a disservice by only advocating punitive parenting<br/>
and not offering more compassionate alternatives but I think I understand<br/>
where he is coming from more now than before.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if that made sense, but I can&#39;t seem to find a way to say it<br/>
any better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913813642">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
I did not watch the show on purpose. Which is normal for me, LOL, but one  <br/>
our friends was on that particular show. I guess he was on there because his  <br/>
stepdaughter has trouble with thunderstorms? I didn&#39;t watch because I did not  <br/>
want to see them being embarassed on tv. Hopefully they weren&#39;t, but like I  <br/>
said, I don&#39;t care for the show. I am curious, those of you who saw it, what  <br/>
your response was to him, his wife and stepdaughter and if you think Dr. Phil&#39;s  <br/>
advice was at all helpful?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835458880">This is so funny - so many times I find that I read topics here and think -<br/>
wow - I felt like that and when I talked about it with other people they had<br/>
no clue where I was coming from. In unschooling forums I&#39;m finding all these<br/>
people more similar to me. I never liked Dr. Phil - especially the parenting<br/>
stuff - it was so counter-intuitive to my experience as a mother and tried<br/>
to fit every child into a strict framework. I also was a little more lenient<br/>
in my judgment of his handling of adults but it still leaves an icky<br/>
feeling. Not quite the violent soul-vomitting that I experience when I am<br/>
caught in the car with a devotee of Dr. Laura but a little hint of the same<br/>
source. <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be great to have a really radical unschooler giving advice on<br/>
national TV? I&#39;ll bet the ratings would be through the roof as all the<br/>
normal American families watched in horror as children were allowed to be<br/>
themselves. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>      I do like him though I find I disagree at times. I think his advice takes a middle road, doesn&#39;t go as far as I wish it would but is probably new and unfamiliar to much of his audience. He&#39;s stated over and over that he will not advocate spanking, that children&#39;s feeling are to be considered important and that modeling behaviour for kids is very important. He&#39;s also been reasonable on topics I don&#39;t agree with him on like co-sleeping. On one episode he stated his opinion of co-sleeping (against) but brought up that many pediatricians think it&#39;s a very healthy thing to do (he mentioned Dr. Sears) and provided pro-cosleeping links on his website. He&#39;s got some good ideas about kids and sex education (talk about it early and often) as well that I&#39;m betting are new to many viewers. <br/>
      He&#39;s rarely got parenting advice that&#39;s new to me or that I want to use but I think he&#39;s a welcome voice and bridge to gentler ideas about raising kids. If he WERE as radical as most of us, I&#39;m betting he wouldn&#39;t be as popular and many of those parents who practice hard and controling parenting would simply dismiss him rather than listen. He&#39;s not where we are but I&#39;m betting he&#39;ll be responsible for helping more than a few parents journey over to our side of the parenting issue.<br/>

one thing I remember him saying about how he was raised was that his <br/>
mother NEVER ever yelled, and she never ever hit them for doing <br/>
things wrong. And every night when she tucked them in, she would tell <br/>
them how lucky she felt to be their mom. Evidently he and his wife <br/>
did that with their sons as well. <br/>
I&#39;m not a fan, but I thought it was interesting that he so often <br/>

I think a lot of people do in a different direction. But I&#39;ve never heard  of <br/>
someone raised in kindness and freedom who turned out to be a mean  <br/>
prison-guard-type-parent.<br/>
 <br/>
He could be inventing that childhood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I doubt it.  To be fair, I&#39;m not a big TV watcher and I&#39;ve only <br/>
watched Dr Phil&#39;s show maybe twice, once when he did a show on <br/>
couples and had them attend a week-long thingy and this one on <br/>
parenting.  He did ok with the couples.  He got them talking.  From <br/>
what I saw of his show, he asks them the problem, then finds the <br/>
person who&#39;s to blame for the problem, then yells at them to either <br/>
shape up or ship out.  But, that&#39;s adults who are choosing to work <br/>
together to solve their problems.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t have that choice.  They are stuck with the rules of the <br/>
parents usually without discussion.  Dr Phil told one mother to take <br/>
90% of all her daughter&#39;s toys away and let her know the other 10 <br/>
could also go if she didn&#39;t behave.  He told another mother to take <br/>
the TV away so her son would go out and play.  She had complained <br/>
that he watched 9 hours of TV a day.  He was about 4.  The yard was <br/>
huge, ugly, fenced-in, in the direct sun, patches of grass and lots <br/>
of trucks.  There was no shade, no swings or slides, and no fun.  <br/>
Plus, he didn&#39;t ask her if she offered to play with him.  Maybe she <br/>
just opened the back door and said to go out to play.  Does the mom <br/>
ask the boy to help her bake?  We don&#39;t know because he didn&#39;t ask <br/>
her.  Dr Phil just told her to take away the TV and the problem <br/>
would go away.  Maybe she just sat in the house all day.  Maybe she <br/>
modeled TV watching.  Dr Phil gave really bad advice, in my <br/>
opinion.  He could have told her to make the yard more inviting to <br/>
him.  He could have told her to go out and plant a vegetable garden <br/>
with him since the yard had so much direct sun.  Not just take away <br/>
the one thing he likes and leave him with only the yucky yard.  He <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to be changing anyone&#39;s childhood from what I saw.<br/>

<br/>
Regardless of whether his recommendations are *better* than spanking, they<br/>
are nowhere close to as respectful of children and their needs as<br/>
Unschoolers try to be. His oft repeated paradigm is &quot;Children NEED rules!&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Children MUST HAVE structure&quot;, &quot;Parents MUST take control of their<br/>
children&quot;. When kids or teens have some kind of problem his answer is always<br/>
a one-size-fits-all more restrictions and control approach, OR ELSE. He is<br/>
also a vigorous advocate of &quot;Toilet Train Your Child in One Day&quot;<br/>
manipulations.<br/>
