<div id="ygrps-yiv-298879431">One thing we did sometimes was to play from the beginning so that one person <br/>
would win.  &quot;Let&#39;s let Holly win&quot; and then all moves would be made with that <br/>
goal in mind.  It doesn&#39;t make the game easier or harder, just different.<br/>
<br/>
There were times I said &quot;Kirby, it&#39;s not fun to play with you when you&#39;re not <br/>
<br/>
willing to possibly lose.&quot;  I wish I&#39;d thought of something better to do, but <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t, and the other two kids weren&#39;t that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       DD wasn&#39;t like this, but our eight-year-old son always has taken games <br/>
and wining very seriously. We&#39;ve done versions of both of these coping ideas. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       When we&#39;d modify a game to his overt advantage, we&#39;d rechristen the <br/>
game. We hoped it would help prevent him from confusing what we were doing with <br/>
the regular game, figuring he&#39;d also need to be able to play the real game <br/>
according to common rules, with other people who don&#39;t love him like we do! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       So when the family would go out to play baseball in the back yard, and <br/>
he got ALL the at-bats while we had to play the field (he was too little to <br/>
pitch anyway) we all called it &quot;Evan Baseball&quot; -- frankly, this turned out to <br/>
help us, too, to focus on &quot;playing with him&quot; instead of getting caught up in <br/>
actually playing baseball. We three, dad, mom and older sister, all are <br/>
first-borns and extremely task-oriented, so we can do just about anything as long as <br/>
we stay clear on what the task really is!<br/>
<br/>
      Evan became a big baseball fan last fall, during the unusually <br/>
thrilling run-up to the 2003 World Series. We watched the Cubs and Red Sox on tv with <br/>
him, and he was able to gradually understand for himself, with no loss of <br/>
face, what little resemblance Major League Baseball bore to what he&#39;d been <br/>
&quot;winning&quot; in the backyard.<br/>
<br/>
      We&#39;ve used this same idea in reverse when he&#39;s losing at a game we <br/>
haven&#39;t modified and renamed. Say he&#39;s having a bad run of luck at Monopoly and <br/>
demands extra turns or announces he&#39;ll just owe the rent, without the agreement <br/>
of his landlord. We explain that those rules don&#39;t belong in this game, but <br/>
maybe he wants to negotiate new rules for a different game, or we could go play <br/>
some other game entirely? But that it&#39;s not fun for anyone to just abandon the <br/>
rules in the middle of a game you&#39;re losing. <br/>
<br/>
       Also whenever WE are losing, we all model ways to keep enjoying the <br/>
game anyway -- over-the-top jokes about our imminent doom, theatrical wailing <br/>
with a big smile and a wink, bestowing extravagant titles like Landlord of the <br/>
Universe, loudly plotting revenge for the rematch we demand, et cetera. <br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;d say no matter what game we&#39;re playing, we tend to turn the whole <br/>
thing into theatre, egging each other on, improvising, trading roles, doing <br/>
bits of dialog from famous characters or stories.  (Sometimes we do have more fun <br/>
losing than winning! &lt;g&gt;)  JJ<br/>
