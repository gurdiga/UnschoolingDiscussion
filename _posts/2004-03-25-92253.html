Awhile ago there was a discussion about castle blocks.  My son has just <br/>
gotten into castles and stuff.  I just got one of the old fisher price castles and <br/>
guys off ebay but I want to check out those castle blocks, they sounded cool <br/>
but he wasn&#39;t into that at the time so I didn&#39;t really take in the info.  Could <br/>
someone tell me where to find them again.   <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
Amanda, whose son has a birthday coming up and wants a cool present<br/>

I just found it in the archives after a little confusion.  They look really <br/>
cool, perhaps they will be coming soon to our house. Amanda<br/>

Sorry, I had skipped a bunch of e-mail while I was out of town.<br/>
<br/>
The blocks we have are from Spain and I don&#39;t remember the name of the <br/>
company.  There are guest-kids sleeping up there where they are, and maybe someone <br/>
answered this already anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just maybe go with Lego knights and castles stuff because you&#39;ll be able <br/>
to find more later.<br/>
