&gt; &gt; talking about it to these other homeschoolers because it seems to freak <br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; out. Any one else go thru this?  What do you do?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m frustrated about this too, although the religious homeschoolers are far <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and few between around here.  What we have are charter schoolers who swap <br/>
curriculum tips like their kids swap baseball cards.  I often find myself joining <br/>
in, in probably a too know-it-all voice, saying what I used to do when I was a <br/>
teacher, and that, of course, we don&#39;t do any of that stuff now.   They seem <br/>
to ignore me and go right on trading recommendations.  I hope that the little <br/>
pause in the conversation is a little wondering if maybe unschooling makes more <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s something I&#39;m running into here.  People who used to be pretty <br/>
loose about homeschooling when their kids were littler are adding more and more <br/>
structure as they get older.  Many go to high school (the charter school ends <br/>
at 8th grade).  I even heard one person say that she was having her kids &quot;do <br/>
school&quot; in the summer, as they &quot;got behind during their unschooling years.&quot;<br/>

Too much to hope for. So sad for those kids if they have no choice in the <br/>
matter on returning to school.<br/>
