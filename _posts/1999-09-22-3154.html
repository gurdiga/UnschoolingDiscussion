 </span></blockquote>I work part time, and that goes ok for me, but I know what you mean about not <br/>
being told to stay home.  It isnt feasible for me to be home full time <br/>
either, and we have cut the corners believe me!  What are the logistics for <br/>
the care of your kids when you are at work?  We do more videos that I would <br/>
really like, but they are mostly educational, so that helps.  And they are <br/>
fun (like magic Schoolbus).<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who is a single parent, works full time making no money (a <br/>
teacher) and she wants to homeschool.  Victoria Moran is an author (very <br/>
good) and she wrote, homeschooled and was a single parent.<br/>
<br/>
There are more of you out there, you know.  Just that  that kind fo schedule <br/>
does give people much time to log on!<br/>

  {{{{{{{Marsha}}}}}}! Hun, I can only give you hugs and a great pat on the <br/>
back.  I can do a lot of things, but work full time and home school!  Wow, <br/>
you could give us some pointers!  I hope that you will find some others who <br/>
are doing this, it would be interesting to see the response,  I don&#39;t think I <br/>
could do it but applaud you and hope to be of encouragement!<br/>

I worked up until the end of July of last year....  For several years.  It&#39;s <br/>
tough there is no doubt about it.  But, quitting was an option for us we had <br/>
to cut back but we&#39;ll be okay.<br/>
<br/>
Trust your children Marsha, if you do they&#39;ll never fail you.<br/>
<br/>
But, aside from that, we spent a lot of time discussing how the day went, <br/>
what they were up too.  Cooking dinner being the best time.  And, the dh was <br/>
unfailing in the area of helping.  I&#39;ll never forget the night he went <br/>
through calenders with the kids to show each day that Beanie Babies were <br/>
&quot;born&quot;.  Best interaction I&#39;ve ever seen.<br/>

I was a full time employed mom. I work for a fast moving new dental office 35 <br/>
miles away from home. I did the juggling, and I got very good at it. The <br/>
children schooled in the evening, and it accommodated to all of our needs. I <br/>
could not leave the office, because I was the only one working, my dh was <br/>
badly injured in an auto accident that we were in, and I felt that I needed <br/>
to work. It is really sad to think of the reasons. I was driving the car, <br/>
another car did not stop for the stopsign, and I broadsided him. It was not <br/>
my fault, but I still have problems with it, I feel that I could have stopped <br/>
or veered (which logically was impossible) The police did say that if I did <br/>
not decrease the speed that we were going, The other car would have hit us, <br/>
and my daughter and husband would have been painted with me. I would never <br/>
have had a chance. So, I felt guilty and got a job. Dh still is making 85% of <br/>
wages, from insurance, but guilt is a terrible thing. I did recently have it <br/>
out with the girl who does the schedules. She started scheduling me for 2 to <br/>
4 hour days. It isn&#39;t worth it to drive 40 minutes for 2 hours. So, she just <br/>
took me off the schedule, altogether. I call once a week, and she won&#39;t talk <br/>
to me, and someone else says there are no hours. I have learned REAL QUICK <br/>
how to live on a shoestring budget, but my kids love having dh and I home. We <br/>
do lots of things, have camped all over the state, etc. MY point is that it <br/>
can be done, and well if you want it to. Sorry that I veered, sometimes my <br/>
fingers get away from me..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063684560">I think we have chatted before. You are not alone. I also am the &#39;breadwinner&#39;<br/>
in the family and unschool my children. My dh is an active part of this, but I&#39;m<br/>
still &#39;in charge&#39; and I get overwhelmed quite often. Actually, right now I&#39;m in<br/>
a major overload moment. Everything just builds up until I can&#39;t take it any<br/>
more. I get no time to myself. Even right now I have dh, dd, ds, and an 11 yob<br/>
in my room with me while I try to type. I&#39;m interrupted every few moments. I<br/>
even had to miss my bellydancing class because dh couldn&#39;t handle it this<br/>
evening. It&#39;s only once a week for 2 hours, but I seem to miss it about 1/3 of<br/>
the time. That&#39;s why I&#39;m in overwhelm. I get tired of always being in charge and<br/>
taking care of everyone else&#39;s needs while sacrificing mine. I know this will<br/>
pass by tomorrow. I&#39;ll pull it all together and then just deal with it.<br/>
Hopefully when my kidlets get older it will be easier (they are just 2 years and<br/>
6 months). Also adjusting to living with a needy 11 year old boy is challenging.<br/>
We&#39;ll get into a routine soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me sound off. I feel better already:)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
