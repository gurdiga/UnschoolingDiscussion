<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467635224">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
   I am new to this list, and to unschooling.  But I have to say that I have <br/>
been delighted with the couple of weeks that I have followed my son&#39;s lead <br/>
where his learning is concerned.  My son, who is nine, really likes the <br/>
concept and the term &quot;unschooling.&quot;  The other day after we got up and came <br/>
downstairs, I asked if he would like me to read while he had breakfast, or if <br/>
he would like to listen to our Star Wars book on tape while we worked on some <br/>
Christmas ornaments.  My son paused and considered.  &quot;Well,&quot; he said <br/>
thoughtfully, &quot;we&#39;re unschoolers, so the possibilities are endless!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Carol A.<br/>
