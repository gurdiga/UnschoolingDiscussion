Zen thumping isn&#39;t for everyone, but those who say &quot;I&#39;m fine like I am&quot; <br/>
should just accept that they&#39;re as fine as they want to get, maybe.<br/>

&gt; things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not what I meant, though.  Blunt and straightforward is good, but<br/>
unless people get validated that they&#39;re really trying to do the best for<br/>
their kids, their defenses are going to go up to the point where they aren&#39;t<br/>
going to be able to hear what we&#39;re telling them.  The last thing I&#39;d want<br/>
to see here is people being told that what they&#39;re doing is just fine if it<br/>
isn&#39;t.  But we can validate that what they are doing is the best they can do<br/>
with the knowledge they already have.  Then they&#39;re maybe more likely to<br/>
listen to other knowledge.<br/>

when people are defensive that&#39;s what they *hear*.<br/>
