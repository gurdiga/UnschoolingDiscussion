<div id="ygrps-yiv-956727538">The Carl books are not the ones I was referring to...those books are <br/>
by Alexandra Day.  The dog books we enjoy are by Lynley Dodd, an <br/>
author from New Zealand. Her books are so beautiful!  <br/>

here is a link I just found with some photos of her covers:<br/>
