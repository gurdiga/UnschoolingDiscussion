Preschool is overhyped<br/>

Advocates of universal preschool claim that starting kids in school earlier <br/>
is the key to improved academic achievement and higher intelligence. This <br/>
claim is made so often that one would expect it to rest on solid evidence. <br/>
But that is not the case. Proponents exaggerate the benefits for young <br/>
children, or fail to mention that the benefits fade after a few years. No <br/>
wide-scale longitudinal study, representative of the American population, <br/>
has found long-term positive effects from state-funded preschool.<br/>
<br/>
Most mothers like being at home with their children, especially during the <br/>
preschool years, and many make substantial financial sacrifices to be able <br/>
to do so. Parents also recognize that it is wrong to make one struggling <br/>
family pay for the child care of other families. According to a report from <br/>
the non-partisan Public Agenda, more than seven in 10 parents with children <br/>
5 or under say they should be responsible for paying the costs of caring <br/>
for their own children; only 24% say other taxpayers should help pay the <br/>
costs. Even a majority of parents earning less than $25,000 a year believe <br/>
that they, not their neighbors, should be responsible for the costs of <br/>
raising their children.<br/>
<br/>
The push for these programs doesn&#39;t come from parents, but rather from <br/>
politicians, who prey on the weaknesses of parents who are often strapped <br/>
financially. Pushing universal preschool may be good for politicians, but <br/>
it is not good for children, nor does it help build a social structure of <br/>
independent, healthy families. Instead of trying to &quot;help&quot; parents by <br/>
offering &quot;free&quot; preschool, politicians need to adjust current policies so <br/>
that parents and extended family members can spend more time with their <br/>
children, not less. Providing non-discriminatory assistance through tax <br/>
cuts would help all parents, whether or not they choose at-home parental <br/>
care, preschool or a combination of both for their children.<br/>
<br/>
The key to producing intelligent, healthy children does not lie in putting <br/>
more of them in taxpayer-funded preschools. Although child care outside the <br/>
home is necessary for some parents, especially single mothers, it should <br/>
not be promoted as the norm for all families. Instead of forcing mothers <br/>
into the workplace through heavy taxation, the government should reduce the <br/>
tax burden on families and, thereby, allow child care to remain in the <br/>
capable hands of parents.<br/>
