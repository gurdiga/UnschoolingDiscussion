&gt; So if there&#39;s one Holly thinks I&#39;d really like, she can go and get me and <br/>
&gt; we <br/>
&gt; can watch the whole thing together.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She likes to look at how the thing was produced---how the costumes work, <br/>
&gt; how <br/>
&gt; the sets work (doors and slides and such) and discuss what they&#39;re trying <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; teach babies with this or that scene.  She&#39;s not watching it as a baby <br/>
&gt; would. <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s watching it as someone who&#39;s interested in theatre and TV production <br/>
&gt; and education would.<br/>

course virtually everything does. And even if it didn&#39;t, life will go on if <br/>
everything is NOT educational. Maybe we obsess about that a bit too much.<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes you get back to the respect thing: I, for example, just <br/>
find Teletubbies totally creepy and it makes my skin crawl. If Julian (who <br/>
feels strongly that I need to mention that he has never wanted to) wanted to <br/>
watch it when I wasn&#39;t around, I&#39;d certainly have no problem with that. But <br/>
if I was doing something in the living room first, I&#39;d assume I had the right <br/>
to veto that. On the other hand, if I wanted to watch something he didn&#39;t <br/>
like and he was there first, he&#39;d have veto power.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this whole thing rarely comes up. I&#39;m babbling...<br/>
