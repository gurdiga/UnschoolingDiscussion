<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979972529">Then I need time to myself to just wind down from the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;day. Of course, this is the time that my husband wants my attention. Has<br/>
&gt;anyone found a solution to this type of situation?  Is this a<br/>
&gt;common problem for home/unschoolers, when mom&#39;s time comes last at the end<br/>
&gt;of the day?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I often have insomnia, which I think may be partially caused by the need<br/>
for down time at the end of the day.  My children are 1.5 and 2.5 and<br/>
really are exhausting.  They cannot even get a drink of water or use the<br/>
toilet by themselves at this age, and it just is really draining, the<br/>
neediness.  Since I am usually up late, my DH gets up with the boys in the<br/>
morning, changes diapers and gets them breakfaast during his morning<br/>
routine.  Then he sets them up with a movie or Sesame Street, etc and gets<br/>
me up before he leaves.  In this way I get my time to myself in the<br/>
evening.  While not a perfect solution, it works for now.  <br/>
<br/>
My DH is happy in his job, but it took a lot to get there.  When we met (at<br/>
work) and married he was the lowest man on the totem pole at work and was<br/>
way underpaid for his job title.  He took a promising &quot;temporary&quot; position<br/>
(per diem with the same Co.) two states away from us in Idaho (we were in<br/>
WA at the time.)  Even though I was 5 months into a VERY difficult<br/>
pregnancy and had a hyperactive 10 month old toddler in tow, I agreed to do<br/>
this move for his career.  After many difficulties, and me taking care of<br/>
all the move details, as he had to start work right away, I began pre-term<br/>
labor at six months.  I managed to hang onto the baby despite almost<br/>
continous labor and other problems through that long first Idaho winter and<br/>
he was born healthy the following spring.<br/>
<br/>
We then recieved news that his name was on the team for the three year<br/>
contract extension.  We figured if he could not find a permanent position<br/>
with his current company in that time, he could find work with one of the<br/>
other companies on the site here.  So we looked for and bought a house.<br/>
Six days after we closed and moved in, his contract was cancelled due to<br/>
internal politics.  Our only choice was to move AGAIN, this time back to my<br/>
parents&#39; home in WA (picture &quot;The Scream&quot; painting.)  The biys were about<br/>
18 months and 3 months old at this time.  After nine months of extreme<br/>
stress, during which time we held onto our house despite my mother advising<br/>
us constantly to sell and DH looked for work long distance, he finally<br/>
found work back here and we were able to move back into our house (which<br/>
was still full of our things - mostly still packed) in March of this year.  <br/>
<br/>
He is now enjoying his position and making much better pay.  But, like I<br/>
said, it took a lot to get here.  He is still looking into home based<br/>
business, just because he would like to spend more time with us at home.<br/>
However, his schedule is pretty flexible, and that allows us to spend more<br/>
time together (occassional long lunches during nap-times, working from home<br/>
once every week or two, etc.)<br/>
