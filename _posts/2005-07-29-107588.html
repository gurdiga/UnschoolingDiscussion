<div id="ygrps-yiv-293751727">This dialog with Sheila is truly mystifying to me.<br/>
<br/>
She shared a conflict her kids were having and advice was given. She<br/>
clarified her situation in response to questions and hoped for more<br/>
advice. That takes courage.<br/>
<br/>
At one point, the question (perhaps by someone else, I don&#39;t have time<br/>
to reread the whole thread) of what to do with siblings who don&#39;t get<br/>
along grew out of this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I shared a practice that has worked well for our family: sitting<br/>
together on the couch to discuss what went wrong and how to resolve it<br/>
peacefully, with all parties feeling heard and a part of determining<br/>
how to negotiate for what they want in the future without resorting to<br/>
mean-spirited communication.<br/>
<br/>
I got told that it would feel like torture and coercion to the poster.<br/>
<br/>
Yet a child can be told to breathe, to tell others to breathe when<br/>
feeling upset and that is seen as non-coercive.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, we have a principle that unkind speech will be addressed<br/>
when it happens--in order to protect kids from feeling tortured by<br/>
mean speech. This princple has worked extremely well for us. Our kids<br/>
just don&#39;t fight hardly at all.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just a principle we apply to them either. They have held us<br/>
to the same standards. We&#39;ve stopped what we&#39;re doing and have sat<br/>
down to really hear the perspective of the offended one as well<br/>
(parent-child, wife-husband). It takes humility and it also makes it<br/>
less rewarding to vent, let me tell you. You think twice if you know<br/>
you are accountable for mean speech.<br/>
<br/>
Punishment and coercion would be saying &quot;You apologize right now. You<br/>
sit and listen to me rant at you for what you did to me&quot; That&#39;s not<br/>
what happens. These are calm conversations with lots of support for<br/>
both parties. These discussions take time and gentleness. We offer both.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is too angry to sit down, he stands. If there is a need for<br/>
a few moments to regroup emotionally, of course we give it. But we<br/>
don&#39;t just leave it alone or until tomorrow. The goal is to give the<br/>
parties involved the chance to work through the miscommunication when<br/>
it occurs until relational peace is achieved. And it works.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had this practice for as long as I can remember. Our kids get<br/>
along great and we have clean slates between kids and parents too.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a parent would stop a kid from throwing a punch, we stop our<br/>
kids from being mean to each other.<br/>
<br/>
--<br/>
<br/>
Later in this thread, someone mentioned that her child will not accept<br/>
any of the offered support when cranky and whiny and one of the<br/>
suggestions is to tell the child &quot;Go to bed and I&#39;ll hold you in the<br/>
morning when you aren&#39;t so cranky.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How is that different than intervening in unkind speech and saying<br/>
&quot;Come to the couch?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If the cranky child refused to go to bed or continued to whine and<br/>
cry, what then?<br/>
<br/>
Certainly sleep is a good idea when cranky. But I&#39;ve noticed it is<br/>
usually the last thing my kids yield to when tired and upset. Fluffing<br/>
pillows means nothing to them.<br/>
<br/>
So a suggestion to &quot;Go to bed until you are less cranky&quot; would sound<br/>
coercive in their ears, like punishment. For us, once the child is<br/>
cranky, it&#39;s too late to suggest sleep. At that point, we watch TV<br/>
with them or go for a drive.<br/>
<br/>
Yet somehow this suggestion of &quot;go to bed&quot; is seen not as coercive,<br/>
categorically... I want to know why. Somehow saying that sleep is good<br/>
for the child is enough. Well, lots of parents would say math books<br/>
are good for children too. That hasn&#39;t been reason enough on this list<br/>
for expecting a child to do something.<br/>
<br/>
Now Sheila is being told that she is defending her kids obnoxious<br/>
behavior when she continues to share the express nature of the<br/>
conflict they had in the store (sticking out tongue and kicking). The<br/>
suggestion offered of what to say to the child: &quot;Stop it or you&#39;re not<br/>
coming with me next time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How do these last two suggestions not sound like all the parents that<br/>
are routinely criticized on this list?<br/>
<br/>
Sending a child to bed or threatening not to bring the child with you<br/>
next time sound like coercive tactics.<br/>
<br/>
Yet after reading this list for all this time, I&#39;m thinking that it is<br/>
the *way* these ideas are communicated that may be different - that<br/>
somehow you are saying to the child, &quot;I like bringing you to the store<br/>
with me, but since it seems that you get bored and cranky, I think<br/>
I&#39;ll go to the store alone next time and Daddy can watch you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe? I hope so because right now I&#39;m totally lost.<br/>
<br/>
I am also a bit mystified at the lack of gentleness in helping a mom<br/>
who is sincerely communicating her frustrations in such a vulnerable<br/>
way. I wouldn&#39;t think we&#39;d talk to our kids this way when they were<br/>
hurting and frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
It appears we are in a semantic whirlpool where it seems that what<br/>
defines coercion is the random impression a post creates on a poster.<br/>

<br/>
For my kids it would be similarly bad.   If they&#39;re angry enough to hit, <br/>
talking has already failed.<br/>
They&#39;re very rarely angry enough to hit, and it&#39;s less likely every day they <br/>
get older.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We breathed with him, we breathed slowly so that we were calm as we were <br/>
trying to help him.   He was little when that all started, maybe three or four, <br/>
and as time passed, he would remind us or a sibling, if someone was going on <br/>
faster and faster, getting frustrated &quot;Breathe!&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a command.   It wasn&#39;t coercing him to breathe.   Nobody said <br/>
&quot;unless you take deep breaths you&#39;re not leaving this place,&quot; and nobody said <br/>
&quot;Because you acted inappropriately we are going to sit you down and make you <br/>
breathe.   We went where he was and helped him calm down.   It became a tool he <br/>
could, has and will use in his life without others there to help him.   It became <br/>
a trick he has passed on to others.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It takes humility and it also makes it<br/>
less rewarding to vent, let me tell you.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Venting at another person isn&#39;t venting.   <br/>
Expressing the frustration to a third party, that&#39;s venting. <br/>
<br/>
I think different concepts are being confused.   <br/>
<br/>
If Marty is furious with Kirby, and we get Marty elsewhere and let him vent, <br/>
he can say what he wanted to say, we can advise him on what he might have done <br/>
differently, we can commiserate and sympathize and Kirby isn&#39;t hurt by any of <br/>
that.   And Marty is helped by it.   If Marty&#39;s communications needed to be <br/>
saved to be directed at Kirby, he wouldn&#39;t have had the opportunity to discuss <br/>
it candidly.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If a child is too angry to sit down, he stands. If there is a need for<br/>
a few moments to regroup emotionally, of course we give it. But we<br/>
don&#39;t just leave it alone or until tomorrow.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never just left anything alone or til tomorrow, so the comparison seems <br/>
to be to something that no one here recommended.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If the cranky child refused to go to bed or continued to whine and<br/>
cry, what then?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Other suggestions would be made.<br/>
<br/>
-= and one of the<br/>
suggestions is to tell the child &quot;Go to bed and I&#39;ll hold you in the<br/>
morning when you aren&#39;t so cranky.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t &quot;go to bed or else,&quot; it was &quot;maybe you should go to bed,&quot; or &quot;if <br/>
you&#39;re going to launch yourself on the floor, maybe you&#39;re tired, so let&#39;s do <br/>
this holding and rocking on your bed so if you launch you&#39;re in a soft place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Certainly sleep is a good idea when cranky. But I&#39;ve noticed it is<br/>
usually the last thing my kids yield to when tired and upset. Fluffing<br/>
pillows means nothing to them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have a different experience here.   Bed has never, ever been a thing that <br/>
didn&#39;t have to do with being tired and sleepy.   Bed is like food--comfort <br/>
when one&#39;s body needs it.<br/>
<br/>
The other night Kirby was playing World of Warcraft and another teen bragged <br/>
that he&#39;d been awake since the morning before (nearly 40 hours at that point) <br/>
and Kirby said he loved to sleep, that sleep&#39;s great and he doesn&#39;t stay up <br/>
just to stay up (or some such, I can&#39;t remember exactly now).   He said the <br/>
other kid said (and this to a group, over headphones) &quot;You&#39;re going to be the most <br/>
boring guy in college.&quot;     I remember people in college staying up just <br/>
because they could, too, not so much because they were involved in music or <br/>
conversation and forgot the time, but from watching the clock and being awake for <br/>
its own sake.   My kids have never had a reason to do that.   They know what <br/>
sleep is good for and they do it voluntarily.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So a suggestion to &quot;Go to bed until you are less cranky&quot; would sound<br/>
coercive in their ears, like punishment. For us, once the child is<br/>
cranky, it&#39;s too late to suggest sleep. At that point, we watch TV<br/>
with them or go for a drive.-=-<br/>
<br/>
To my kids it wouldn&#39;t sound coercive.   It would be the same as &quot;maybe <br/>
you&#39;re hungry&quot; as a suggestion for why they were cranky.      Another La Leche <br/>
League quick-trick was when a child is crying, HALT.:    hungry?   angry?   <br/>
lonely?   tired?       None of those are crimes or punishments.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yet somehow this suggestion of &quot;go to bed&quot; is seen not as coercive,<br/>
categorically... I want to know why.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s a suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Somehow saying that sleep is good<br/>
for the child is enough. Well, lots of parents would say math books<br/>
are good for children too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had a math book when he took a math class.   At that point he chose <br/>
one.   He chooses to sleep at least once in just about every 24 hour period, too. <br/>
  And when he&#39;s tired is when he needs sleep, but we no longer have to <br/>
suggest it to him at all.   Sometimes when he was little it was one of several <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now Sheila is being told that she is defending her kids obnoxious<br/>
behavior when she continues to share the express nature of the<br/>
conflict they had in the store (sticking out tongue and kicking).-=-<br/>
<br/>
When things continue for five or fifteen minutes without change or cessation, <br/>
something isn&#39;t working.   When suggestions people make are rejected <br/>
repeatedly, something is being defended.<br/>
<br/>
-=- The suggestion offered of what to say to the child: &quot;Stop it or you&#39;re <br/>
not<br/>
coming with me next time.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
If someone (of whatever age) is unprepared to behave well in public, taking <br/>
him out in public for a repeat isn&#39;t the best next move.   If someone is too <br/>
loud in a theatre or tells what&#39;s going to happen in a movie, I wouldn&#39;t take <br/>
him with me to a movie the next time (and maybe not ever again), but FIRST I <br/>
would ask him to be quieter, and ask him not to discuss what&#39;s going to happen.   <br/>
If he started hitting me, I wouldn&#39;t talk to him for five minutes about it.   <br/>
I would not be there to be hit within SECONDS.<br/>
<br/>
Letting children be abusive to mom or each other isn&#39;t unschooling.   It&#39;s <br/>
not good parenting.   It&#39;s not good socializing.   If a family comes over and <br/>
the kid is wild and the mom hasn&#39;t a clue about how to deal with him about it, I <br/>
won&#39;t invite them back.    (It&#39;s happened.)   That&#39;s because my house should <br/>
be safe from such things.   If one of my children goes with me to a store and <br/>
doesn&#39;t behave well and ignored suggestions or requests, then the next time <br/>
I&#39;ll leave that child elsewhere and go to the store without him, or get someone <br/>
else to go to the store.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sending a child to bed or threatening not to bring the child with you<br/>
next time sound like coercive tactics.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In what way?<br/>
<br/>
-=- that<br/>
somehow you are saying to the child, &quot;I like bringing you to the store<br/>
with me, but since it seems that you get bored and cranky, I think<br/>
I&#39;ll go to the store alone next time and Daddy can watch you.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
That, or &quot;if you want to go to the store you need to be helpful and sweet, <br/>
because otherwise it&#39;s insufficiently fun for anyone.&quot;      Or &quot;Dad can go to <br/>
the store next time and we&#39;ll stay home.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I like bringing you to the store with me&quot; wouldn&#39;t be true of a kid who&#39;s <br/>
causing a lot of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
When I had three kids small enough to ride in carts, I&#39;d often get two carts, <br/>
one for the main groceries and Holly, and that one I&#39;d push (with Kirby&#39;s <br/>
help, maybe).   Marty sat in the deep basket part of a second cart, and I&#39;d pull <br/>
that one, and give him groceries he could sort around him.   Or if we weren&#39;t <br/>
getting much, put one in the seat and one in the basket of a single cart.   <br/>
Nobody had to stay in, and nobody had to walk, and they   might change positions <br/>
a time or two during the outing.   We usually had a blanket (maybe a coat, in <br/>
season) so the one sitting in the basket wasn&#39;t uncomfortable.   A lot of the <br/>
whining and fighting we&#39;ve seen around us in stores was a child who wanted to <br/>
ride or be carried, or who wanted to get down and walk, and the mom was <br/>
saying no, stay right where you are.    <br/>
<br/>
Another thing to do to avert boredom and increase the spark of it being &quot;an <br/>
outing&quot; instead of just the same old grocery store is to go to different <br/>
grocery stores.   Yes, it takes longer, but there are new sights for everyone.<br/>

I always took your suggestions to breathe or go to bed as suggestions<br/>
that were meant to be tools to use to recover from anger, whininess,<br/>
crankiness etc. The wording: &quot;Go to bed&quot; is what tripped me up. So I<br/>
appreciate your clarifying and confirming that hunch.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, that is the spirit in which I offered my suggestions for<br/>
how we have helped our kids resolve their conflicts.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-If the cranky child refused to go to bed or continued to whine and<br/>
&gt; cry, what then?-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other suggestions would be made.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -= and one of the<br/>
&gt; suggestions is to tell the child &quot;Go to bed and I&#39;ll hold you in the<br/>
&gt; morning when you aren&#39;t so cranky.&quot;-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It wasn&#39;t &quot;go to bed or else,&quot; it was &quot;maybe you should go to bed,&quot;<br/>
or &quot;if <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re going to launch yourself on the floor, maybe you&#39;re tired, so<br/>
let&#39;s do <br/>
&gt; this holding and rocking on your bed so if you launch you&#39;re in a<br/>
soft place.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-<br/>
&gt; Certainly sleep is a good idea when cranky. But I&#39;ve noticed it is<br/>
&gt; usually the last thing my kids yield to when tired and upset. Fluffing<br/>
&gt; pillows means nothing to them.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have a different experience here.   Bed has never, ever been a<br/>
thing that <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have to do with being tired and sleepy.   Bed is like<br/>
food--comfort <br/>
&gt; when one&#39;s body needs it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other night Kirby was playing World of Warcraft and another teen<br/>
bragged <br/>
&gt; that he&#39;d been awake since the morning before (nearly 40 hours at<br/>
that point) <br/>
&gt; and Kirby said he loved to sleep, that sleep&#39;s great and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
stay up <br/>
&gt; just to stay up (or some such, I can&#39;t remember exactly now).   He<br/>
said the <br/>
&gt; other kid said (and this to a group, over headphones) &quot;You&#39;re going<br/>
to be the most <br/>
&gt; boring guy in college.&quot;     I remember people in college staying up<br/>
just <br/>
&gt; because they could, too, not so much because they were involved in<br/>
music or <br/>
&gt; conversation and forgot the time, but from watching the clock and<br/>
being awake for <br/>
&gt; its own sake.   My kids have never had a reason to do that.   They<br/>
know what <br/>
&gt; sleep is good for and they do it voluntarily.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-So a suggestion to &quot;Go to bed until you are less cranky&quot; would sound<br/>
&gt; coercive in their ears, like punishment. For us, once the child is<br/>
&gt; cranky, it&#39;s too late to suggest sleep. At that point, we watch TV<br/>
&gt; with them or go for a drive.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To my kids it wouldn&#39;t sound coercive.   It would be the same as &quot;maybe <br/>
&gt; you&#39;re hungry&quot; as a suggestion for why they were cranky.     <br/>
Another La Leche <br/>
&gt; League quick-trick was when a child is crying, HALT.:    hungry?  <br/>
angry?   <br/>
&gt; lonely?   tired?       None of those are crimes or punishments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Yet somehow this suggestion of &quot;go to bed&quot; is seen not as coercive,<br/>
&gt; categorically... I want to know why.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because it&#39;s a suggestion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- Somehow saying that sleep is good<br/>
&gt; for the child is enough. Well, lots of parents would say math books<br/>
&gt; are good for children too.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kirby had a math book when he took a math class.   At that point he<br/>
chose <br/>
&gt; one.   He chooses to sleep at least once in just about every 24 hour<br/>
period, too. <br/>
&gt;   And when he&#39;s tired is when he needs sleep, but we no longer have to <br/>
&gt; suggest it to him at all.   Sometimes when he was little it was one<br/>
of several <br/>
&gt; suggestions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Now Sheila is being told that she is defending her kids obnoxious<br/>
&gt; behavior when she continues to share the express nature of the<br/>
&gt; conflict they had in the store (sticking out tongue and kicking).-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When things continue for five or fifteen minutes without change or<br/>
cessation, <br/>
&gt; something isn&#39;t working.   When suggestions people make are rejected <br/>
&gt; repeatedly, something is being defended.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- The suggestion offered of what to say to the child: &quot;Stop it or<br/>
you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; coming with me next time.&quot;-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If someone (of whatever age) is unprepared to behave well in public,<br/>
taking <br/>
&gt; him out in public for a repeat isn&#39;t the best next move.   If<br/>
someone is too <br/>
&gt; loud in a theatre or tells what&#39;s going to happen in a movie, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t take <br/>
&gt; him with me to a movie the next time (and maybe not ever again), but<br/>
FIRST I <br/>
&gt; would ask him to be quieter, and ask him not to discuss what&#39;s going<br/>
to happen.   <br/>
&gt; If he started hitting me, I wouldn&#39;t talk to him for five minutes<br/>
about it.   <br/>
&gt; I would not be there to be hit within SECONDS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letting children be abusive to mom or each other isn&#39;t unschooling.<br/>
  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not good parenting.   It&#39;s not good socializing.   If a family comes<br/>
over and <br/>
&gt; the kid is wild and the mom hasn&#39;t a clue about how to deal with him<br/>
about it, I <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t invite them back.    (It&#39;s happened.)   That&#39;s because my<br/>
house should <br/>
&gt; be safe from such things.   If one of my children goes with me to a<br/>
store and <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t behave well and ignored suggestions or requests, then the<br/>
next time <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll leave that child elsewhere and go to the store without him, or<br/>
get someone <br/>
&gt; else to go to the store.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-Sending a child to bed or threatening not to bring the child with you<br/>
&gt; next time sound like coercive tactics.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In what way?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=- that<br/>
&gt; somehow you are saying to the child, &quot;I like bringing you to the store<br/>
&gt; with me, but since it seems that you get bored and cranky, I think<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll go to the store alone next time and Daddy can watch you.&quot;-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That, or &quot;if you want to go to the store you need to be helpful and<br/>
sweet, <br/>
&gt; because otherwise it&#39;s insufficiently fun for anyone.&quot;      Or &quot;Dad<br/>
can go to <br/>
&gt; the store next time and we&#39;ll stay home.&quot;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I like bringing you to the store with me&quot; wouldn&#39;t be true of a kid<br/>
who&#39;s <br/>
&gt; causing a lot of trouble.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I had three kids small enough to ride in carts, I&#39;d often get<br/>
two carts, <br/>
&gt; one for the main groceries and Holly, and that one I&#39;d push (with<br/>
Kirby&#39;s <br/>
&gt; help, maybe).   Marty sat in the deep basket part of a second cart,<br/>
and I&#39;d pull <br/>
&gt; that one, and give him groceries he could sort around him.   Or if<br/>
we weren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; getting much, put one in the seat and one in the basket of a single<br/>
cart.   <br/>
&gt; Nobody had to stay in, and nobody had to walk, and they   might<br/>
change positions <br/>
&gt; a time or two during the outing.   We usually had a blanket (maybe a<br/>
coat, in <br/>
&gt; season) so the one sitting in the basket wasn&#39;t uncomfortable.   A<br/>
lot of the <br/>
&gt; whining and fighting we&#39;ve seen around us in stores was a child who<br/>
wanted to <br/>
&gt; ride or be carried, or who wanted to get down and walk, and the mom was <br/>
&gt; saying no, stay right where you are.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another thing to do to avert boredom and increase the spark of it<br/>
being &quot;an <br/>
&gt; outing&quot; instead of just the same old grocery store is to go to<br/>
different <br/>
&gt; grocery stores.   Yes, it takes longer, but there are new sights for<br/>
everyone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687441518">One thing I did was to GIVE each child a dollar to spend. Another thing <br/>
was they sat in the cart and played with the foods - pretended they <br/>
were babies - especially bags of rice or beans that they could hold and <br/>
cuddle. When they were older we had a book called &quot;Grocery Cart Math&quot; <br/>
-- they played with that like a scavenger hunt. Each had a clipboard <br/>
and a pencil and the game was, for example, to find 5 things sold by <br/>
the ounce, write down the price, and figure out how much they were by <br/>
the pound. Or find 5 things sold by the gallon and figure out how much <br/>
they were if sold by the quart. Stuff like that. They&#39;d do the <br/>
scavenger hunt part in the store and the figuring in the car on the way <br/>
home. I think they really liked the clipboard and pencil!! You wouldn&#39;t <br/>
need the book to do this - just make stuff up. Be creative. And it <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to have the math component - just make it a scavenger hunt <br/>
where they try to find funny little things - they can just check off if <br/>
they find it or write down the aisle.<br/>
<br/>
We shopped in the middle of the night a lot - the aisles were big and <br/>
wide and the kids played - jumping on the different tiles on the floor <br/>
in patterns.<br/>
<br/>
We always got a treat of some kind to have in the car on the way home - <br/>
little something.<br/>
<br/>
I often picked out something strange and different that I knew we <br/>
hadn&#39;t had before - usually a fruit of some kind.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 14, 17, and 20 and they STILL always want to tag along to <br/>
the grocery store with me.<br/>
<br/>
I want to add, though, that we had a couple of grocery store trips that <br/>
didn&#39;t go well - kids too hungry, probably, and they were fighting with <br/>
each other. I remember at least twice leaving a cart of groceries <br/>
(asking the clerk to put it in the cold room for me to return later) <br/>
and just going out to get fast food instead of finishing my shopping. I <br/>
remember being really irritated to have to do that - but it was <br/>
annoyance at myself for setting us up for the problems - not finding <br/>
something for the kids to eat before going grocery shopping - dragging <br/>
it out too long - whatever.<br/>

hadn&#39;t had before - usually a fruit of some kind.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I ask Jayn to pick out things and collect our particular basic items - the<br/>
bread we like, any tomatoes she chooses (they come packaged, but a gazillion<br/>
varieties), the eggs. If she can&#39;t find any particular item from the list,<br/>
she goes and asks a worker. We shop at a small market, Trader Joes, and she<br/>
is now well known to many of the staffers. <br/>
<br/>
Also she likes to go and look at the different flowers, and smell them. She<br/>
can now be trusted not to mangle the bunches. Our TJ&#39;s has a little fountain<br/>
inside the door, and sometimes she throws in a penny for a wish. Another<br/>
game she likes, especially when I am standing in line, is to &quot;magic&quot; the<br/>
doors open and closed. <br/>
<br/>
Also she invariably asks to eat a snack in the process, either sitting in<br/>
the cart or walking. Usually it will be a bag of barbeque chips or a small<br/>
cookie bag, sometimes little bags of madelines. Of course I pay for the<br/>
package at the checkout. We also like places that do samples (as our TJ&#39;s<br/>
does.) <br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t had to come back later, but I have cut the odd trip short, and<br/>
stood in the line holding Jayn in my arms with her head on my shoulder. That<br/>
has happened when we didn&#39;t bring a sweater and she got cold in the<br/>
refrigerated sections.<br/>

Julie, I think the reason your first post set off people&#39;s coercion <br/>
alarms is that (as I recall) you started your description of the process <br/>
by saying &quot;we sit them down on the couch...&quot;.  Because this sentence <br/>
structure has the parent as the subject and the child as the object <br/>
(being set down or made to sit down) that could be why some people <br/>
pictured bossy parenting in their minds.  Thanks for giving the longer <br/>
explanation.  It&#39;s really hard for some of us highly emotional people to <br/>
imagine a face-to-face on the couch process like this working without <br/>
time for everyone to calm down first.  Not being able to leave the scene <br/>
has the potential to make some people feel trapped and controlled.<br/>

<br/>
We are life long homeschoolers(10 official years) and on our 2nd year as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 14 and wondering about writing a transcript. <br/>
<br/>
for instance:<br/>
<br/>
He does not care one bit to take Biology,  Cnidarians do not interest him in the least and we were wondering how do we count a Biology credit on someone who will never study it. (Other that a litter of puppies over the summer) He is very automotive minded right now(since he was 8) and there is just no way I can count that as a mollusk.<br/>
<br/>
All the cover schools in Alabama require it for graduation.<br/>
<br/>
There are other subjects with the same issues. I just used Biology as an example.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do I skip the ones he refuses and go on? Do I find pond water and suggest he look at while sitting in a car? <br/>
<br/>
How do you guys count credits, if you count them at all?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185767515">&quot;(Other that a litter of puppies over the summer)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d definitely tell the school about the litter of puppies.  Did he <br/>
do anything other than observe that the puppies were born?  Like did <br/>
he look up websites or books to see what to do to help if there&#39;s an <br/>
emergency?  Even if not, I&#39;m sure you could write up something about <br/>
observing the birth of a dog and monitoring the puppies.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an online biology book that you could look at for ideas of <br/>
things you might have done that would sound like biology for a <br/>
school:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookTOC.html">http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookTOC.html</a>  <br/>
Reproduction is one of the chapters and I bet you covered a lot of <br/>
that when your puppies were born.  Maybe you talked a bit about <br/>
genetics when you were guessing how many puppies would look like the <br/>
mom and how many would look like the dad.  Genetics is a chapter too. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been awhile since I read it, but I think in the book <br/>
Homeschooling our Children Unschooling Ourselves she talks about her <br/>
son being into fly fishing and how they wrote that up for biology.  <br/>
<br/>
Has he done any gardening, or watched you do gardening?  Or does he <br/>
have any other pets?  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one thing I&#39;d use if I were doing a transcript for my kids and <br/>
had to explain what we did for biology:  <br/>
<br/>
For awhile we had a lot of animal teeth things connecting together in <br/>
neat ways.  <br/>
<br/>
First, my son  and I were at Hershey Park and a groundhog boldly came <br/>
up to us begging for food.  I&#39;ve never seen a groundhog before that <br/>
wasn&#39;t dead on the side of the road. &lt;grin&gt;  So we threw him a pizza <br/>
crust and watched him eat it and noticed that he ate just the way our <br/>
hamsters eat.  We wondered if that is something that all rodents have <br/>
in common.  <br/>
<br/>
Several days later my husband came home with animal teeth that he <br/>
found on the side of the road at work, and thought we might enjoy <br/>
seeing them.  He didn&#39;t know what they were, but he guessed groundhog <br/>
because he had seen a dead groundhog on the side of the road about <br/>
the same place a long time ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Several days later we went to my parents&#39; house and played with their <br/>
new pet bunny.  We wondered if rabbits were rodents too, and went <br/>
home and looked that up online.  We found out that they&#39;re not <br/>
rodents because they have extra teeth, and found out that all rodents <br/>
teeth look the same.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I thought of those teeth that dh had brought home, and I <br/>
pointed out to the kids that they didn&#39;t look like the pictures of <br/>
rodent teeth we were seeing online.  I opened up the mouth of one of <br/>
our hamsters, and showed them the teeth.  They looked nothing like <br/>
dh&#39;s roadkill teeth.   Then I opened up our dog&#39;s mouth (Isn&#39;t it <br/>
nice how my pets tolerate me? &lt;grin&gt;) and we looked at his teeth.  It <br/>
was a match!  <br/>
<br/>
That led to a discussion of what kind of animals might have been <br/>
killed in that area that had teeth like our dog.  <br/>
<br/>
Several days later we were driving in a residential area and saw a <br/>
skunk dead on the side of the road.  It had just been killed.  We <br/>
pulled over and got out to look at it.  It&#39;s mouth was open and we <br/>
got a good look at its teeth and my daughter pointed out that his <br/>
teeth look just like our cat&#39;s teeth.  <br/>
<br/>
We also noticed that it hardly smelled at all, not like skunks <br/>
usually smell when they get hit by a car. So I said maybe it was <br/>
someone&#39;s pet and had been descented, and told her about a relative <br/>
that used to have a pet skunk.  When she got home she used google to <br/>
find out what would be involved in having a pet skunk.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not getting a pet skunk but she does want to get 2 pet rats and <br/>
train them to do things like mazes.  She just won an auction on ebay <br/>
for a cage, and she&#39;s been reading lots of stuff online about having <br/>
pet rats. She looked up breeders online and as soon as her cage comes <br/>
in the mail plans on calling them to see when she can buy her rats.  <br/>
<br/>
In a transcript I could write about animal classification <br/>
definitely.  Maybe something with digestion because of the different <br/>
kinds of teeth different animals have and what they&#39;re used for. <br/>
<br/>
We could write lots of other stuff about pets too, since my kids tend <br/>
to want a lot of pets. ;)  Like that our pet turtle ate every other <br/>
living thing, plant or animal, that we put in the tank with him, and <br/>
that he just keeps getting bigger every year. &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;He is very automotive minded right now(since he was 8) and there is <br/>
just no way I can count that as a mollusk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are we talking about a highschool transcript in order to meet the <br/>
requirements of the law or a transcipt for impressing a college so <br/>
that you can gain admission? <br/>
<br/>
At first I thought you were talking about a college transcript and I <br/>
was going to ask if he wants to go to college if he&#39;s really into <br/>
automotive stuff, but later I see you seem to be talking about <br/>
highschool credits? <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of anything automotive that would be biology, but I bet <br/>
you could come up with lots of stuff that he does with cars that <br/>
would be other branches of science.  Maybe chemistry too, if you had <br/>
to figure out which detergents best cleaned his greasy work clothes. <br/>
&lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I skip the ones he refuses and go on? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do you mean by skip?  Skip as in not showing the highschool that <br/>
you did anything for that subject?  I wouldn&#39;t do that if it&#39;s a <br/>
legal requirement and you could get in trouble for not showing it. <br/>
That would be something to discuss on a state homeschool list.  But <br/>
you could find things that the school understands to be biology. <br/>
<br/>
Have you gone anywhere like a science museum?  Science museums tend <br/>
to have things that include many different branches of science.  If <br/>
you look on your science museum&#39;s website you&#39;ll probably find that <br/>
some of the exhibits have something to do with biology.  What about a <br/>
zoo?  Aquarium?  <br/>
<br/>
What I do in my portfolio, and I&#39;m in a different state (PA) so I <br/>
don&#39;t know if this is anything like what you could do, is I <br/>
write &quot;Some of our favorite educational activities from this school <br/>
year&quot; at the top of a paper and then just start putting in stuff that <br/>
might impress them.  I don&#39;t point out that we didn&#39;t use a textbook--<br/>
I don&#39;t tell them what we didn&#39;t do, I tell them what we did do.  In <br/>
our case we did a &quot;unit study&quot; on animals.  In your case you did too, <br/>
just a different kind.  I bet if you think of all the conversations <br/>
you had about your dog having puppies you could come up with lots of <br/>
neat things to write about.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do I find pond water and suggest he look at while sitting in a car? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
lol!  I don&#39;t think that would really benefit anyone.  It might lead <br/>
your son to believe that you&#39;re nuts though. ;)<br/>
<br/>
But did he see a pond this year?  What other bodies of water has he <br/>
seen? Has he seen a river, lake, ocean, stream?  I bet he noticed <br/>
some differences.  You could say that as part of your ecology study <br/>
you did a field trip to observe different bodies of water.  Did he <br/>
wade in the creek?  Catch any minnows or crayfish in the creek? Find <br/>
any seashells at the ocean?   Did he bring them home?  That&#39;s <br/>
observing specimens. ;)  <br/>

go to school in AL, but it was possible in my high school to get <br/>
enough science credits to graduate without ever taking biology (I <br/>
think you needed 3 or 4 yrs of science and you could take any of <br/>
what was offered - bio 1, bio 2, chem 1, chem 2, physics, earth <br/>
science - totally possible to skip all biology).<br/>
<br/>
Oh hey if he might be interested - look into green house gases, auto <br/>
emissions, renewable energy sources (like the new hybrid cars) - <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this could be approaching it backwards - I mean getting tied in<br/>
knots trying to make ordinary life into transcript type Biology or any other<br/>
subject, for college admissions purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Another approach could be to examine the specific admissions requirements<br/>
for the particular courses that your ds is interested in at the colleges of<br/>
interest, as well as what might be available in community colleges that<br/>
expect students to transfer after a time. The colleges are the ones choosing<br/>
their own requirements or standards, not the State high schools. There may<br/>
be a simple one semester Biology (or other subject) course, designed for<br/>
people whose high school experience is judged inadequate for the college<br/>
coursework. For that matter Biology may not be required at all for the<br/>
College course of study or degree program that your son may become<br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I am reminded of Valerie&#39;s dd, Laurie, who learnt all the formal<br/>
math she needed for her particular college admissions requirement over a<br/>
couple of months prior to enrollment due to having the desire and motivation<br/>
to do so when it was essential to allow her to continue pursuing her<br/>
particular goals.  (&quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;, Valerie Fitzenreiter)<br/>
<br/>
Another thought is that you are worrying about it a few years earlier than<br/>
it will necessarily be impinging on his future plans. He has years yet to<br/>
discover Biology before college. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe try subscriptions to Scientific American and Popular Science. There<br/>
may be paths into biology from the mechanics and physics that are already in<br/>
the forefront of his mind, that some of those articles will inspire.<br/>

that is needed. DH did that - he tested out of all the science, <br/>

English and history requirements as well - a couple days of tests <br/>
(which he compared to a few hours of watching Jeopardy and playing <br/>
Trivial Pursuit) and he already had enough credit hours to almost be <br/>
a sophomore (he tested out of 1 1/2 semesters worth of work).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-151911546">I want to thank you all for the help and suggestions. I will check out those book ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what got into me. I just all of the sudden panicked when I realized he would be a 9th grader this year. Sometimes, I fall back into the box. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I really dont see him going to a formal college. He plans to be a professional dragracer and go to top fuel alchohol driver school. Somehow I dont think he will need Biology. It has awakened me to the fact that my next child &#39;12&#39; will possibly be needing to cover certian subjects in the near future and I should be watching for opportunities in her favored areas a little more closely.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to some of my local Alabama lists and have learned a bit more about what I am required and not required to cover.<br/>
<br/>
BTW We did cover some biology today at the vet. Our dog has demodectic mange and the vet let the kids watch him do skin scrapes,prepare the slides, and follow him to the microscope in the back to look at the critters. They each got to look at the cigar shaped many legged bugs. He also told the kids all about them.<br/>

&gt;My ds is 14 and wondering about writing a transcript.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;for instance:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He does not care one bit to take Biology,  Cnidarians do not interest him <br/>
&gt;in the least and we were wondering how do we count a Biology credit on <br/>
&gt;someone who will never study it. (Other that a litter of puppies over the <br/>
&gt;summer) He is very automotive minded right now(since he was 8) and there is <br/>
&gt;just no way I can count that as a mollusk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All the cover schools in Alabama require it for graduation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are other subjects with the same issues. I just used Biology as an <br/>
&gt;example.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do I skip the ones he refuses and go on? Do I find pond water and suggest <br/>
&gt;he look at while sitting in a car?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How do you guys count credits, if you count them at all?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400034606">It is not really a necessity, his PS friends have been talking about writing transcripts and he was interested. One of them had a &#39;list&#39; of what subjects had to be covered to get one of three diplomas from our county in Alabama. That is where the Biology came in. (That was when I realized he would be 9th grade this year and maybe he could use one.)<br/>
 <br/>
However, after asking on this list (and two others )we have decided that if he ever needs one we will deal with it then and he can keep an informal journal of his doings to remember activities for later inclusion if ever needed.<br/>
<br/>
He plans to become a professional drag racer and go to driving school which doesnt require anything but a drivers license and money. Otherwise hands on experience is all he needs right now and he gets plenty of that weekly with his Jr dragster. He does it all except push himself to the start line and we do that.<br/>
 <br/>
He is a perfectionist and wants to worry (be prepared) for all the what if&#39;s, before we even need to. He gets that from me. :o)<br/>
