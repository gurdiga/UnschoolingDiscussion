<div id="ygrps-yiv-175560882">Tia,<br/>
In thinking this through,  I was thinking that I&#39;ve always respected my<br/>
children&#39;s ability in their &#39;gut&#39; feelings.  They seem to naturally avoid<br/>
interaction with certain relatives;  and I let them (and the relative,  if<br/>
need be) know that these boundaries are to be respected.<br/>
    I have an older brother that used to beat me mercilessly,  and &quot;tickle<br/>
torture&quot; me (quite literally).  I have not talked this over with my<br/>
children - though I certainly will when they ask about it.  I have worked<br/>
through my own problems about this;  and respect that he has changed in some<br/>
ways...he seems to be trying,  at least.  However,  my children are terribly<br/>
afraid of him.  They even ask that he not be invited to family gatherings -<br/>
especially birthdays...(he like sto do the spanking for each year and a<br/>
pinch to grow an inch).   At any rate,  he&#39;s (my brother) actually beginning<br/>
to try different ways to relate to my children.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong,  I<br/>
would not leave my children around him without one of us parents to<br/>
intervene for them.)<br/>
    Anyway,   my point is that,  I do see how my children have to be better<br/>
off....after all,  I was reared to dis-connect from my own intuition....it&#39;s<br/>
a long road beck to one&#39;s self sometimes.  My children are encouraged to<br/>
know and trust their feelings.<br/>
Thanks for the input!<br/>

&gt; My mother smoked almost all her life.  I knew not to hassle her about it,<br/>

&gt; happened to mention on the phone early this summer that she hadn&#39;t smoked<br/>

&gt; It is always hard to tell if what you are doing is &quot;working&quot; or if you are<br/>
&gt; making some giant horrendous mess of everything.  I think it is human and,<br/>
&gt; in particular, mommy nature to worry about our parenting skills.  And<br/>
&gt; particularly for those of us who didn&#39;t have the greatest examples to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>learn<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over the years we&#39;ve had our ups and downs and our little &quot;family&quot; has<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; call from one of &quot;our&quot; kidlets that tells me &quot;ya ain&#39;t doing so bad, keep<br/>
&gt; following the same path.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s what was written in a card we received on Christmas Day from one of<br/>
&gt; our &quot;adopted&quot; boys.  This kinda card makes it all worthwhile and makes the<br/>
&gt; self-doubts go away at least for a little while!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You two have given me<br/>
&gt;      what no one else can,<br/>
&gt; Respect and responsibility to<br/>
&gt;      be a young man.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You shone light on the darkness<br/>
&gt;      and opened my eyes,<br/>
&gt; To learn from my mistakes<br/>
&gt;      and go on with my life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From drama with mama<br/>
&gt;      or trouble in court<br/>
&gt; You two would never stop<br/>
&gt;      givin me support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I can&#39;t pay you back<br/>
&gt;      for all the good that you&#39;ve done<br/>
&gt; But I recognize the family<br/>
&gt;      that loves me like a son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now when I speak,<br/>
&gt;      it&#39;s HONESTY before fear!<br/>
&gt; Merry Christmas and<br/>
&gt;      have a Happy New Year.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I think this has to do with how much damage was done and how much<br/>
&gt; &gt; insecurities it caused.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I spent many years oblivious of my own insecurities, still trying to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; my &#39;mother&#39;s approval&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I&#39;ve been working on cutting that line for many years. Sometimes, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t always keep my confidence and her words shake me. Sometimes, I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; shake them off.<br/>
