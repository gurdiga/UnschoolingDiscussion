<div id="ygrps-yiv-904700461">My son looks 4 and talks like he&#39;s 4, but he&#39;s only 2 1/2 so I get that a<br/>
lot... because not only is he acting out of control, but he is also only 2,<br/>
so people expect a lot more from him.<br/>
I also get a lot of &quot;aren&#39;t you too big for diapers?&quot; or &quot;can you write your<br/>
name for me?&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like unless they&#39;ve been through it, my<br/>
husband&#39;s friends&#39; wives (all with no kids) think they are the most<br/>
knowledgable people on earth regarding the way children should be or be<br/>
raised... needless to say it has been difficult for us to do things with<br/>
them.  At least as a family (the husbands are actually great with the kids<br/>
and to me, it is the wives that continually tell me what they&#39;ve read or<br/>
heard or saw on Oprah, because obviously what I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t working).<br/>
<br/>
Julian had an &quot;episode&quot; the other night at a duplex we were hoping to get<br/>
rented to us.  This happens at vacant places, but this time it was in the<br/>
evening, he was getting hungry, and it was just too much for him to handle.<br/>
Julian loves to run through vacant homes.  But he gets too worked up and<br/>
it&#39;s very hard to keep him calm with so much room to run.  I was trying to<br/>
fill out the application and talk to the guy but Julian just go so worked up<br/>
he was hitting the walls and cabinets, I stopped him, and then he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
stop crying and kicking the floor and screaming.<br/>
The landlord said I needed to be more firm with him.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t get the place.  But that&#39;s OK.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113679430">Definitely a good thing that you didn&#39;t get the place!<br/>
<br/>
My kids are both huge -- look at least 2 years older than they are -- and <br/>
bright -- so nobody ever treats them like the little kids they are.  I have <br/>
to remind myself quite often that they are just 6 and 8 -- no matter what <br/>
they look like!<br/>
<br/>
And, fyi, they were both in diapers until they were 4!  Hard to remember that <br/>
long ago, but it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i recently had a guy tell me that i&#39;m great at the mother part, i&#39;m just <br/>
really lacking on the father part.....that is spanking, scolding and <br/>
belittling (sp?). (i&#39;m a single mom)  it seems i get a lot more advice from <br/>
people without children....unwarranted advice that is.<br/>
<br/>
my heart goes out to you. home hunting is not fun, for adults or children. <br/>
good luck.<br/>
hope you find a family friendly environment.<br/>
