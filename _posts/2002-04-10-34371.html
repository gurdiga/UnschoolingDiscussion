 </span></blockquote>Joyce, I appreciated your whole post and am glad that the description is <br/>
being modified. I didn&#39;t know the RIGHT definition of unschooling and felt <br/>
that my attitude was pretty much in line with unschooling when joining the <br/>
list. Unfortunately the exchanges I&#39;ve had have been frustrating to me in <br/>
some sense (partially because we&#39;re going thru my mom having leukemia/cancer <br/>
testing and a huge financial blow - that makes anyone a bit sensitive I think <br/>
and I know it has affected my take on things here) yet the information here <br/>
has also been very helpful.<br/>
I&#39;ve learned that there ARE different levels of unschooling, however, there <br/>
is a True Unschooling Method and THAT is what I am not. I am eclectic and <br/>
that&#39;s just fine by me.  I have difficulty with making sure I&#39;m doing <br/>
something within a certain paradigm, for example being sure that I am doing <br/>
everything in the unschool manner according to one author. (My opinion only, <br/>
not meant as criticism at all.)<br/>
I don&#39;t mind learning that my understanding of unschooling is wrong. It helps <br/>
me personally to have a sense of the options out there, how others that are <br/>
homeschooling are doing it, and what goes on in other homeschoolers&#39; homes on <br/>
a daily basis. Its great to get that insight and have that kind of support.  <br/>
I feel that I don&#39;t fit in here because I&#39;m not an unschooler as has been <br/>
pointed out in answer to my posts and some of Kate&#39;s.  THat&#39;s cool by me, <br/>
there are lots of other groups out there and we can all find what is right <br/>
for each of us.  Good luck on the wording of the description, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll <br/>
get it right and it will be easier for newbies to know if they are in the <br/>
right place without disrupting the community that is here =)<br/>
