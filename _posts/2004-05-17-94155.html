<br/>

<br/>
The School in my Head<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nobody&#39;s perfect,&quot; they say, and I have been challenged to reveal my own <br/>
doubts and failings.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
I still have a school in my head.  Witness my total unwillingness to go to <br/>
Disney World.  That is a definite &quot;nope&quot; for me, and the only thing that would <br/>
help would be more deschooling.  That might happen, but I would rather settle <br/>
for the more comfortable Disneyland.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the true and embarrassing reason that I can love Disneyland and fear <br/>
Disney World:  I can score a higher percentage at Disneyland.  I can do better <br/>
than 80%, maybe 90% if I stay three days.    I have heard from many people <br/>
that one would have to stay at Disney World a week to see it all.  So I don&#39;t <br/>
want to go, because if I see any less than 70% that would not be a passing <br/>
grade. <br/>
<br/>
I see the world in terms of percentage grades.  I have a &quot;grading&quot; overlay <br/>
behind my eyes somehow that still hasn&#39;t totally faded out.  It&#39;s sad but true.<br/>
<br/>
For some people it&#39;s even worse, though.  Some people can&#39;t leave school <br/>
because they&#39;re carrying it around like a snail and his shell.  They live there, <br/>
still.  School became an ingrown, hard part of them.   They still define <br/>
themselves by their school failures and successes.<br/>
<br/>
How does a person who has gone to school for twelve years or thirteen or <br/>
sixteen or twenty years get over all that programming and all those messages?  <br/>
Slowly, and with effort, and sometimes school can still flood back in or ooze <br/>
around the edges.  Can they find their school-less selves?<br/>
<br/>
Last year I forgot school was out, and offered to help a friend of mine in <br/>
one of her history classes.  It was July, though, and she said, &quot;Cool!  When <br/>
school starts.&quot;   She needed to borrow some chain mail, but not in summer.    <br/>
That seemed like progress, for me to have been unaware of &quot;school year&quot; for a <br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
Every September, &quot;back to school&quot; kicks in.  I crave the smell of crayons and <br/>
new pencils.   I like to go down the school supply aisle at the store and <br/>
admire packages of paper, and new binders.  My kids still have the binders <br/>
they&#39;ve had for years and they don&#39;t need new ones.  I don&#39;t either, yet I&#39;m drawn <br/>
there like a migratory bird that has to pass over familiar ground at the same <br/>
time every year.<br/>
<br/>
I like the appearance of the letter &quot;A&quot; much better than I like to see a &quot;D&quot; <br/>
or an &quot;F.&quot;  My maiden name started with &quot;A&quot;, and my married name starts with <br/>
&quot;D.&quot;   &quot;D&quot; is not as good.  Those letters are branded into my brain with their <br/>
&quot;values&quot; from school.<br/>
<br/>
But little scars like that are only irritations or curiosities.  I regret <br/>
scars and imperfections and little sorrows, but though they slow me down, they <br/>
don&#39;t cripple me.  I can see through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
School is part of me, and I am part of the school memories of many people, <br/>
whether as a schoolmate or as their teacher.    But school is not a part of my <br/>
children, nor they of school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people say to me, &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy <br/>
with unschooling parents.&quot;   I don&#39;t go door to door asking people if they <br/>
know about unschooling, and whether they&#39;d like to know more.   If they come <br/>
where I already am, though, I might press.  And when I do, it&#39;s because of the <br/>
possibility that they will run out of time. <br/>
<br/>
My kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.   <br/>
<br/>
The mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to help her <br/>
child recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with him before <br/>
he&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it gradually.  If she <br/>
stalls, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
If the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading <br/>
instruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to unschooling, I <br/>
would rather press her to decide toward &quot;none,&quot; because &quot;some&quot; is damaging to the <br/>
child&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and discover it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; <br/>
will only hurt that much more. &quot;None&quot; can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the <br/>
parent can&#39;t get unschooling.  But if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she <br/>
misses forever the opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and <br/>
naturally.  It will be gone forever. <br/>
Forever. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t say, &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re <br/>
doing is fine, and if you want to unschool you can <br/>
come to it gradually at your own pace.  No hurry.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
People say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) of their late-reading children, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sure he&#39;ll be reading by the time he goes on a date.&quot;  The same cannot be said <br/>
of unschooling, though, if the parent is attached to thinking she needs to <br/>
teach things.  <br/>
<br/>
Until a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from working, <br/>
unschooling cannot begin to work. <br/>
<br/>
It seems simple to me.  If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you have to <br/>
stop talking and be still. <br/>
<br/>
Some people want to see unschooling while they&#39;re still teaching and putzing <br/>
and assigning and requiring. <br/>
<br/>
They have to stop that first. And then they have to be still. And then they <br/>
have to look at their children with new eyes. <br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t, it won&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
I still see &quot;subject areas&quot; everywhere, but I haven&#39;t taught those categories <br/>
and prejudices to my children.   Science has much more to do with history <br/>
than geology has to do with microbiology, but in school geology, biology, <br/>
astronomy and physics are all &quot;the same thing,&quot; and history is different altogether.  <br/>
 Yet the best parts of history involve the knowledge cultures had and how <br/>
they put it to use, whether in shipbuilding or iron tool use, medicine or <br/>
communications.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked yesterday about when people discovered the world wasn&#39;t flat.  I <br/>
told her there was no one date or century because people discovered different <br/>
things at different times, and some were shushed up when they said the world <br/>
was round, or that the sun didn&#39;t orbit around the earth.   I also told her, <br/>
&quot;Ask your dad, because he&#39;s really interested in the history of science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I noticed when I said it that I had &quot;named subject areas,&quot; but I didn&#39;t feel <br/>
too bad.  She&#39;s twelve, and reading, and after all &quot;the history of science&quot; <br/>
was never part of my schooling.  A science teacher wasn&#39;t certified to teach me <br/>
history, and vice versa.  Only outside of school did I figure out that <br/>
scientific discoveries were history, and that music was science, and that art was <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
School served to prevent connections for me, but I overcame that, with <br/>
difficulty.  It is a problem my children never had.  If Animaniacs completed a <br/>
circuit for them between Magellan and WWII, well it&#39;s a circuit school would never <br/>
have completed for me under any circumstances.  If learning for fun creates <br/>
more connections than &quot;serious learning&quot; did, I can no longer look at &quot;serious <br/>
learning&quot; seriously.<br/>
<br/>
The best function of the school in my head, as it turns out, is to remind me <br/>
where not to dwell.  I did my time in and around school, and learned things <br/>
painstakingly and grudgingly that my children later learned while laughing and <br/>
playing and singing.  I have guarded my children&#39;s freedom and given them happy <br/>
choices that I didn&#39;t have.   <br/>
<br/>
I know from school that the best way to end an essay is to tie it back to the <br/>
beginning, but these birds cannot nest where I started.  They are a <br/>
generation removed and have flown freely out and about without a school to return to in <br/>
September.   But wait:  if I take 10% off the essay for a weak ending, I do <br/>
indeed tie it back, and so might yet get an &quot;A.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Quite pathetic, but it makes me feel better.<br/>

because they&#39;re carrying it around like a snail and his shell.  They live there, <br/>
still.  School became an ingrown, hard part of them.   They still define <br/>
themselves by their school failures and successes.<br/>
<br/>
How does a person who has gone to school for twelve years or thirteen or <br/>
sixteen or twenty years get over all that programming and all those messages?  <br/>
Slowly, and with effort, and sometimes school can still flood back in or ooze <br/>
around the edges.  Can they find their school-less selves?<br/>
<br/>
Last year I forgot school was out, and offered to help a friend of mine in <br/>
one of her history classes.  It was July, though, and she said, &quot;Cool!  When <br/>
school starts.&quot;   She needed to borrow some chain mail, but not in summer.    <br/>
That seemed like progress, for me to have been unaware of &quot;school year&quot; for a <br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
Every September, &quot;back to school&quot; kicks in.  I crave the smell of crayons and <br/>
new pencils.   I like to go down the school supply aisle at the store and <br/>
admire packages of paper, and new binders.  My kids still have the binders <br/>
they&#39;ve had for years and they don&#39;t need new ones.  I don&#39;t either, yet I&#39;m drawn <br/>
there like a migratory bird that has to pass over familiar ground at the same <br/>
time every year.<br/>
<br/>
I like the appearance of the letter &quot;A&quot; much better than I like to see a &quot;D&quot; <br/>
or an &quot;F.&quot;  My maiden name started with &quot;A&quot;, and my married name starts with <br/>
&quot;D.&quot;   &quot;D&quot; is not as good.  Those letters are branded into my brain with their <br/>
&quot;values&quot; from school.<br/>
<br/>
But little scars like that are only irritations or curiosities.  I regret <br/>
scars and imperfections and little sorrows, but though they slow me down, they <br/>
don&#39;t cripple me.  I can see through and over them.<br/>
<br/>
School is part of me, and I am part of the school memories of many people, <br/>
whether as a schoolmate or as their teacher.    But school is not a part of my <br/>
children, nor they of school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people say to me, &quot;You&#39;re patient with your own children but pushy <br/>
with unschooling parents.&quot;   I don&#39;t go door to door asking people if they <br/>
know about unschooling, and whether they&#39;d like to know more.   If they come <br/>
where I already am, though, I might press.  And when I do, it&#39;s because of the <br/>
possibility that they will run out of time. <br/>
<br/>
My kids have their whole lives to memorize 7x8 if they want to.   <br/>
<br/>
The mother of a twelve year old has VERY little time if she wants to help her <br/>
child recover from school and spend a few unschooling years with him before <br/>
he&#39;s grown and gone. She doesn&#39;t have time to ease into it gradually.  If she <br/>
stalls, he&#39;ll be fifteen or sixteen and it just won&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
If the mother of a five year old is trying to decide how much reading <br/>
instruction and math drill to continue with before she switches to unschooling, I <br/>
would rather press her to decide toward &quot;none,&quot; because &quot;some&quot; is damaging to the <br/>
child&#39;s potential to learn it joyfully and discover it on his own. And &quot;lots&quot; <br/>
will only hurt that much more. &quot;None&quot; can still be turned to &quot;some&quot; if the <br/>
parent can&#39;t get unschooling.  But if she doesn&#39;t even try unschooling, she <br/>
misses forever the opportunity to see that child learn to read gradually and <br/>
naturally.  It will be gone forever. <br/>
Forever. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t say, &quot;Gosh, I&#39;m sure whatever you&#39;re <br/>
doing is fine, and if you want to unschool you can <br/>
come to it gradually at your own pace.  No hurry.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
People say jokingly (though it&#39;s true) of their late-reading children, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
sure he&#39;ll be reading by the time he goes on a date.&quot;  The same cannot be said <br/>
of unschooling, though, if the parent is attached to thinking she needs to <br/>
teach things.  <br/>
<br/>
Until a person stops doing the things that keep unschooling from working, <br/>
unschooling cannot begin to work. <br/>
<br/>
It seems simple to me.  If you&#39;re trying to listen for a sound, you have to <br/>
stop talking and be still. <br/>
<br/>
Some people want to see unschooling while they&#39;re still teaching and putzing <br/>
and assigning and requiring. <br/>
<br/>
They have to stop that first. And then they have to be still. And then they <br/>
have to look at their children with new eyes. <br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t, it won&#39;t happen. <br/>
<br/>
I still see &quot;subject areas&quot; everywhere, but I haven&#39;t taught those categories <br/>
and prejudices to my children.   Science has much more to do with history <br/>
than geology has to do with microbiology, but in school geology, biology, <br/>
astronomy and physics are all &quot;the same thing,&quot; and history is different altogether.  <br/>
Yet the best parts of history involve the knowledge cultures had and how <br/>
they put it to use, whether in shipbuilding or iron tool use, medicine or <br/>
communications.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked yesterday about when people discovered the world wasn&#39;t flat.  I <br/>
told her there was no one date or century because people discovered different <br/>
things at different times, and some were shushed up when they said the world <br/>
was round, or that the sun didn&#39;t orbit around the earth.   I also told her, <br/>
&quot;Ask your dad, because he&#39;s really interested in the history of science.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I noticed when I said it that I had &quot;named subject areas,&quot; but I didn&#39;t feel <br/>
too bad.  She&#39;s twelve, and reading, and after all &quot;the history of science&quot; <br/>
was never part of my schooling.  A science teacher wasn&#39;t certified to teach me <br/>
history, and vice versa.  Only outside of school did I figure out that <br/>
scientific discoveries were history, and that music was science, and that art was <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
School served to prevent connections for me, but I overcame that, with <br/>
difficulty.  It is a problem my children never had.  If Animaniacs completed a <br/>
circuit for them between Magellan and WWII, well it&#39;s a circuit school would never <br/>
have completed for me under any circumstances.  If learning for fun creates <br/>
more connections than &quot;serious learning&quot; did, I can no longer look at &quot;serious <br/>
learning&quot; seriously.<br/>
<br/>
The best function of the school in my head, as it turns out, is to remind me <br/>
where not to dwell.  I did my time in and around school, and learned things <br/>
painstakingly and grudgingly that my children later learned while laughing and <br/>
playing and singing.  I have guarded my children&#39;s freedom and given them happy <br/>
choices that I didn&#39;t have.   <br/>
<br/>
I know from school that the best way to end an essay is to tie it back to the <br/>
beginning, but these birds cannot nest where I started.  They are a <br/>
generation removed and have flown freely out and about without a school to return to in <br/>
September.   But wait:  if I take 10% off the essay for a weak ending, I do <br/>
indeed tie it back, and so might yet get an &quot;A.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Quite pathetic, but it makes me feel better.<br/>

time just squeezing my son away from me, he&#39;ll be 12<br/>
in July and still holds fast to the desire to stay in<br/>
school for social reasons. I have spent the past<br/>
couple of months attempting to let go of my own school<br/>
thinking, and letting him stay home if he wants to.<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to shut my mouth and just support him<br/>
in his need to just lay around and do nothing, to<br/>
decompress and think and mull things over. I guess<br/>
I&#39;ve succeeded about 50% of the time. That&#39;s an F. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m concerned because he mostly wants to stay home-but<br/>
won&#39;t leave school. I know his biggest fear is that<br/>
he&#39;ll be stuck at home with me, having to hang out<br/>
with his baby sister who is only 10 months old. I&#39;m<br/>
trying to get us out there, involved in some<br/>
activities and meeting some people, but it&#39;s taking<br/>
time. 2 weeks until 5th grade is over. I&#39;m so worried<br/>
that we&#39;ll get through the summer and he will still<br/>
want to go back.<br/>

this new math assignment in which the kids have to <br/>
hold down a job and earn a living and keep their<br/>
finances balanced. He said he couldn&#39;t believe how<br/>
ridiculous it was to pretend something like that and<br/>
how he wished he had time to get a real job and earn<br/>
some real money. Then he said that he&#39;s pretty sure he<br/>
wants to homeschool next year and had a bunch of<br/>
questions about what would happen. So we&#39;re moving<br/>
forward even when I feel like we&#39;re moving backwards.<br/>
Life is so interesting. <br/>
