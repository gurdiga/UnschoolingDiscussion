We, people on those sources named right above have received a few dozen <br/>
apologies from people who will say &quot;I thought you were all mean and crazy, <br/>
but then <br/>
I figured out what you were talking about,&quot; or &quot;When I first read about <br/>
unschooling it seemed neglectful nonsense, but now...&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got one of those recently. It&#39;s below. I&#39;ve omitted the name, but I&#39;ve <br/>
included everything but her name so&#39;s not to reveal the writer of the &quot;e-pology&quot;. <br/>
It was very sweet to receive (but I&#39;ve gotten plenty of hate mail too, so.... <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).<br/>

*****Dear Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
First, I want to apologize to you for our interaction of 8 to 10 weeks ago or <br/>
more.  I insulted you and my insult was unwarranted and came from a place of <br/>
ignorance.  I apologize sincerely.  I hope that you will forgive me.  I am <br/>
wholly sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, I have done a lot more reading and a lot less talking/posting.  I <br/>
have come to a much fuller understanding of unschooling.  I still have some <br/>
questions, but I can understand where so many of the long-time unschoolers are <br/>
coming from, and how dedicated you are to helping people enjoy the lifestyle <br/>
without regret and worry.<br/>
<br/>
I had wanted to write you an apology some time ago, but never did--obviously. <br/>
 It was your post today, which actually brought tears to my eyes for much of <br/>
it, that reminded me to waste no more time and set my thoughts down and send <br/>
them to you.<br/>
<br/>
Your post about your experience with television and your boys is so <br/>
inspirational.  I still feel slightly scared about it, but I&#39;m not writing for you to <br/>
give me.... I&#39;m writing really just to apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to write this post.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,******<br/>
<br/>
