&lt;&lt; There are no &quot;Fun Games&quot; if they&#39;re designed to be &quot;educational&quot;<br/>
When prisons show movies, it&#39;s still prison. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t flow right.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Top Hat&quot; is the same movie whether it&#39;s watched by John on Death Row in The <br/>
Green Mile or by Holly Dodd in her living room when she chose it herself at <br/>
Hollywod Video.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a game which was designed to be educational and it is assigned in <br/>
a school to school children, their experience of that game will be entirely <br/>
different from Holly&#39;s if she chooses the same game from our game collection <br/>
and plays it because she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the game, it&#39;s the intent of the person who assigns the playing of <br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
And if it wasn&#39;t assigned, but chosen, how does that touch on school or <br/>
prison or education?<br/>
