<br/>
I don&#39;t know why, but I have the strangest feeling that you are reading<br/>
&quot;Punished By Rewards&quot;.  What do you think of it?<br/>

&gt; Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
&gt; wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
&gt; true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
&gt; who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
&gt; themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
&gt; on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
&gt; justify the use of control.<br/>
