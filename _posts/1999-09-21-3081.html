i am with you there.  i enjoyed a book that really led me in believing that <br/>
unschooling would work for us called &quot;wisdom&#39;s way of learning&quot; by marilyn <br/>
howshall.  it is a thick read but not too hard, and everything in it doesnt <br/>
fit for us-- but what i got out of it was that yes, productivity is <br/>
important.  not as an end, but to know that the process is happening.  for <br/>
me, tv and computer games are too passive and so we (adults) choose to limit <br/>
them greatly in our home.  it is comsumption which is different than active <br/>
participation.  (this is all in mho, and my personal philosophy-- and i <br/>
realize some computer games dont fit this description, just generalizing <br/>
here...)  my kids have an extremely wide range of &quot;sanctioned&quot; activities <br/>
from crafts to reading to writing letters to projects (self started) to <br/>
sewing to outdoor play to carpentry, etc, etc (right now they are in the <br/>
garage sanding the old wagon to give it a new paint job which they started <br/>
before i got up this morning, amazing!) but the point being ACTIVE activites. <br/>
 i will say i have not had to help anyone to deschool (except myself!) and i <br/>
do understand the importance of giving the kids time to just be and slowly <br/>
kind of un-do whats been done...  i guess it would be hard to know when <br/>
exactly to enter in the less passive activities.  maybe it will just be <br/>
child-led. one concern to me would be if he has already experienced being <br/>
&quot;bored&quot;  than wont he bored with tv and computer at home?  i would have been <br/>
as a child.....  just some meanderings....<br/>

We are in our first year of homeschooling. My son would have been in first<br/>
grade. He went to a town-run preschool 2 years ago that we both really<br/>
liked; the teacher was, looking back at it, very creative and the<br/>
environment was open and friendly. (I had only put him in preschool due to<br/>
pressure from everyone for my son to be &quot;socialized&quot; because he is an only<br/>
child. If I knew then what I know now!) The preschool teacher had warned us<br/>
that kindergarten was MUCH different than preschool, and she was so right.<br/>
Last year he went to kindergarten and lost all his inner motivation to<br/>
learn anything he calls &quot;educational&quot;, which included a lot. He even<br/>
stopped reading because they had a mandatory reading program for prizes<br/>
which he didn&#39;t want to do. By the end of the year he was &quot;bored&quot; (his<br/>
words), and didn&#39;t want to go back. Now the challenge is reawakening his<br/>
interest in new things without any appearance of schoolishness. Things are<br/>
improving a little each week, but we still have days of nothing but<br/>
computer games and TV, which I find frustrating. I can&#39;t get it out of my<br/>
head that we need to have something to show for our days at home when my<br/>
parents come over or we meet people at the store or at sports events who<br/>
question homeschooling.<br/>

&gt;olivia,<br/>
&gt;just curious, do you mean first year after a year of kindergarden or were <br/>
&gt;there years before that of preschool or other things?  If if was only kinder. <br/>
&gt;then it sounds like you&#39;ll be sailing along soon.  does 6yo like it so far?<br/>

Yes, I think that much of TV and computer time is passive. However,<br/>
sometimes a TV show will generate a conversation about something that turns<br/>
out to be important, and he does a lot of learning via the computer. He<br/>
hasn&#39;t yet become bored with either medium; maybe someday he will. <br/>
<br/>
Right now he is in a stage in which he wants (and waits for) me to do a<br/>
project with him, even if that means waiting and not doing anything active<br/>
until I finish some housework.  This is where the only child issue comes<br/>
in: he doesn&#39;t seem motivated to work on an &quot;active&quot; project (even though<br/>
the materials are easily available to him) unless he has someone to do it<br/>
with (and that means me since he hasn&#39;t a sibling.) Maybe this isn&#39;t just<br/>
an only child thing; maybe it is just a phase in his personal development<br/>
or a remainder from school days. Maybe he just finds an activity more fun<br/>
when you share it with someone. But I can&#39;t (and probably shouldn&#39;t) spend<br/>
every moment of the day being his playmate, even though I feel badly that<br/>
he spends so much time without other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, just rambling again...<br/>
