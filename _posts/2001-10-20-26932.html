<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740100278">Hi,<br/>
  My family and I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago, and we stayed in the<br/>
NYU area. WE felt very safe- police and soldiers are everywhere-plus<br/>
thousands of people are living and are busy doing their thing.<br/>
 Although ground zero is very sobering(the smoke,the building skeletons, the<br/>
smell, and the overwhelming sadness)there still remains an inspiring<br/>
positive spirit, and it is something to experience- I felt it throughout the<br/>
city. I would loved to have stayed longer, and I am glad that we didn&#39;t<br/>
allow fear to cause us to cancel our trip, because we seriously considered<br/>
canceling. It is awesome, cannot wait to return. Can you go?? Maybe that<br/>
would put you at ease. I know a wonderful hotel in the area-reasonably<br/>
priced.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t fly, but I think passengers and flight crews are much more alert<br/>
and are not going to let anyone get away with hi-jacking a plane. Have you<br/>
read how several planes have had military escorts, immediate landings,<br/>
confetti spilling out of a card and someone reporting it as suspect,<br/>
troubled passenger getting restrained by other pax., etc. It seems like<br/>
everyone is watching everything that used to go mostly un-noticed.<br/>
