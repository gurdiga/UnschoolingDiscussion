<div id="ygrps-yiv-644881285">Hi all, my name is Linda Maggioncalda and I have been reading the<br/>
list for a couple of weeks and have enjoyed it thoroughly and have <br/>
learned so much.  Before that I was reading on Unschooling.com.  My <br/>
husband Eugene and I have 2 daughters, Sarah (6) and Olivia (3.5).  <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading everything I can find about unschooling for the <br/>
past year (SandraDodd.com!!!!)and this wonderful way of living and <br/>
learning works well for our family.<br/>
<br/>
This story is about our recent visit with our niece and is long and <br/>
involved and I will write it in installments.  <br/>
<br/>
Ten days ago our 14 year old schooled niece, Noelle, walked in<br/>
to this peaceful scene to stay with us for two weeks as a &quot;mother&#39;s <br/>
helper.&quot;  This was arranged by Noelle&#39;s mother who told me that it<br/>
was Noelle&#39;s idea and that Noelle was really looking forward to it. (<br/>
BTW, both of Noelle&#39;s parents work full time and Noelle has always <br/>
gone to school. She will be in the 9th grade in the fall.)  We live <br/>
in Alexandria, Virginia and Noelle flew in from Detroit to be with <br/>
us.  My girls were very excited about their older cousin&#39;s visit.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle seemed to have trouble right away with our lifestyle and kept <br/>
trying to coerce and even force the girls to do things such as get <br/>
ready for bed, get dressed, eat.  I explained our parenting<br/>
philosophy--which she seemed unable to understand. <br/>
<br/>
The second day Noelle was here, as we were driving along in the car <br/>
she told me that my children needed to go school and that they <br/>
needed to be with other children.  I explained that we were with <br/>
other children plenty.  And she said, &quot;Yes, but they need to be with <br/>
other children without you.&quot;  I disagreed and said I thought they <br/>
needed to be with me and she said, &quot;Children don&#39;t need their <br/>
parents.&quot;  She then told me that I shouldn&#39;t homeschool them past <br/>
the third grade. I challenged her to open her mind to different ways <br/>
of doing things and offered the &quot;Teen Liberation Handbook&quot; (by Grace <br/>
Llewellyn) for her to read.  She refused.  I then told her that I <br/>
planned to homeschool them as long as they wanted to.  <br/>
<br/>
Noelle also said some rude and disrespectful things to me throughout <br/>
the day.  By the time my husband got home I was seething.  He talked <br/>
with her (she is his older brother&#39;s daughter).  He told her gently <br/>
but firmly that we don&#39;t talk to each other that way in our house.  <br/>
Noelle apologized and we seemed to have forgiveness and good <br/>
feelings all around.  <br/>
<br/>
Noelle came to me later and said, &quot;I know I have an attitude problem <br/>
and I&#39;m trying to change.&quot;  She then said that junior high was a <br/>
really mean place and she understood a little of why I <br/>
homeschooled.  She said, &quot;You don&#39;t want Sarah and Olivia to be a <br/>
mean girl like me.&quot;  I asked her, &quot;Are you a mean girl?&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m <br/>
not but junior high is so mean.&quot;  I said that was one reason I don&#39;t <br/>
want them to go there.  <br/>
<br/>
End of first installment.  Next, we go to Bible School and Noelle is <br/>
further challenged by our unschooling lifestyle.</div>
