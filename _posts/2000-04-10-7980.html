<div><font size="2">I think so, but since our hospital doesn&#39;t have a transitional 
care ward, it works as both, but not well since there isn&#39;t room for the mothers 
to sleep there.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know what criteria they use, but I do know that I 
wasn&#39;t asked because I was sleeping off a sleeping tablet, Heather&#39;s birth was 
short in time but makes a fairly long story, for a natural birth :-)&nbsp; So 
they couldn&#39;t ask me to express either.&nbsp; What interested me was that they 
never asked the mothers expressing for their babies if any excess could be used 
for other babies.&nbsp; I know mothers donating milk have to be tested for HIV 
and other diseases, but surely that doesn&#39;t take that long, and it&#39;s more 
appropriate to give milk to babies of around the same gestation and age, if you 
know what I mean.&nbsp; A fact-finding mission to China found the mothers 
expressing milk into enamelware bowls to give to babies who needed it, they were 
specifically matched for gestational age and age from birth, as close as 
possible.&nbsp; Makes sense to me :-)&nbsp; I must find out where I read that 
snippet ...</font></div>
