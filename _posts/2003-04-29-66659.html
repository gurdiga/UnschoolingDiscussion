<div id="ygrps-yiv-256789054">&quot;Ok, IF she somehow had no interest in supper for example and I had prepared<br/>
the meal with love it&#39;s still wrong because she specifically did not ask me<br/>
to prepare her supper?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only wrong if you cooked a meal instead of doing something your kids<br/>
would have rather you do with them.  If they would have preferred eating<br/>
peanut butter and jelly if it meant you took them to the park or played a<br/>
game with them or drove them to some cool place, then telling them that you<br/>
can&#39;t do those things because you have to prepare a meal isn&#39;t consistent<br/>
with the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve been doing is planning our days ahead of time.  I ask my kids<br/>
what they would like to do tomorrow and if there is anything special they<br/>
would like to eat.  Sometimes they give me something special they want to<br/>
eat, sometimes they don&#39;t care about what they eat as long as they get to do<br/>
some other really cool thing.  Planning a day ahead seems to make things<br/>
flow smoother for us.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the response, we sometimes plan, we most times don&#39;t.  It&#39;s just <br/>
me and Cait home for the most part all day so it&#39;s easier than if there were <br/>
little children with lots of interests and things to do.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday she wanted to go get manicures and pedicures, it was easy to do on <br/>
the spur of the moment because it was only me and her that we have to <br/>
consider schedules for.<br/>
<br/>
All the children and my nephew and his girlfriend and the children&#39;s <br/>
girlfriend/boyfriend and friends and the next door neighbors came over later <br/>
for a cook out and everyone just hung around and visited.  I didn&#39;t plan it <br/>
but it worked out OK since Cait and I had went to the market after the salon.<br/>
<br/>
We might think about doing something or going somewhere that takes some <br/>
planning, then we figure it out, but it is a very nice time in life to be <br/>
able to spend this time so laid back with her just doing absolutely nothing <br/>
or something planned or unplanned.<br/>
<br/>
It really is nice isn&#39;t it?  Thank you so much for sharing with me.<br/>
