not from a delivery truck!!! We would sneak eating it. . .thinking we were <br/>
sooo bad! LOL. . . ahhh, the memories of good ole Catholic guilt!<br/>

I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And they rarely ring the little bells anymore.  And many parishes allow<br/>
girls to be servers now.....and women are sometimes appointed as parish<br/>
administrators.  And laypeople are necessary to parish functioning.  Vatican<br/>
2 has slowly caused transformations......though Americans do tend to rebel<br/>
in some ways...I&#39;m not sure Pope JP-2 would think much of the female<br/>
servers.  Even read recently of a new schism in the Catholic<br/>
church......someone &quot;ordained&quot; a woman priest.<br/>
