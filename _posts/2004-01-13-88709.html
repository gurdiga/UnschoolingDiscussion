<br/>
Sometimes one parent is just better with the kids or with them more or more <br/>
interested or committed to unschooling and the other parent is more <br/>
distractable or busy, or NOT so good with kids.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is not as good with kids&#39; questions as I am, so they usually ask <br/>
me if I&#39;m around.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s gotten better over the years, but I&#39;m definitely the main unschooling <br/>
parent, still.<br/>

She&#39;s gotten better over the years in some resects, but I&#39;m definitely the &quot;main&quot; unschooling parent.  I&#39;m more....involved.  She would tell you the same thing, lol.<br/>

I replied to this earlier, but I guess it didn&#39;t show up?  Oh well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, in our family I am the one here most of the time so I am the main <br/>
unschooling parent. I am the one with most of the ideas and the energy to pursue <br/>
them. DH gets involved whenever he can, we look forward to more involvement in <br/>
the future but he does run the family business and through the week he is often <br/>
exhausted.<br/>
