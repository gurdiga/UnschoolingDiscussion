<div id="ygrps-yiv-470558270">First, I was wrong about the other teen I was writing about.  He&#39;s  still 17 <br/>
for a few weeks and the reason he can&#39;t get his wisdom teeth out right  away <br/>
is because he&#39;s in a Shakespeare production.  Sorry I missed the  &quot;nearly 18,&quot; <br/>
but it only makes the rest of what I wrote MORE true.  He&#39;s  not even 18.<br/>
 <br/>
Someone else wrote: <br/>
<br/>
I was  expected to support myself at 18 (with much less<br/>
guidance than he will  receive from me), and his 18th<br/>
birthday is the limits of the total support  I can<br/>
offer him as I have not yet earned great amounts of<br/>
money,  although I will continue to be able to offer<br/>
him partial support beyond  18.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==============<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be obnoxious, I&#39;m trying to lay out the parts of these  <br/>
ideas for examination.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I was expected to support myself at 18-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Why?<br/>
 <br/>
Tradition?<br/>
High school is over?<br/>
Social security benefits ended?<br/>
 <br/>
If we shun &quot;tradition,&quot; why should we keep some arbitrary parts?<br/>
Most people are &quot;expected to&quot; go to school from the time they&#39;re five or  six <br/>
(give or take a year).  If we lay that expectation by, what then does  &quot;18&quot; <br/>
mean in the absence of the assembly line?<br/>
 <br/>
If it&#39;s about social security and aid to the parent of a dependent child,  <br/>
that&#39;s a real and non-arbitrary reason. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-=-his 18th birthday is the limits of the total support I can offer him . .  .<br/>
although I will continue to be able to offer him . . .-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The choice of &quot;can&quot; and &quot;be able to&quot; means you don&#39;t see it as a  choice.<br/>
You chose your words, but you&#39;re not choosing your actions?<br/>
 <br/>

(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/haveto)">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/haveto)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
If you decide not to support him after he&#39;s 18, be clear inside yourself,  <br/>
and with him, that it&#39;s a choice, not a &quot;have to&quot; or &quot;able to&quot; or  whatever.  <br/>
 <br/>
When our kids were little and we instituted a weekly allowance, we said  <br/>
&quot;until you&#39;re 18,&quot; thinking that was in the hypothetical forever.  When  Kirby <br/>
turned 18, I felt bad about his allowance ending, because he used to keep  it on <br/>
the calendar and only cash it out for out of state trips.  But he was  fine <br/>
with it.  It was kind of a point of pride with him, but he had a job  at the <br/>
time and really wasn&#39;t hurting for money.<br/>
 <br/>
Outside of social security, insurance, voting rights and tradition, 18 is  <br/>
arbitrary. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
If ALL six year olds are ready to leave their moms and go to school, then  <br/>
ALL 18 year olds are ready to start supporting themselves as adults (at least  <br/>
partially).<br/>

I&#39;ve read a couple of articles about kids in foster care losing all their support on the 18th birthday, even if that birthday falls before high school graduation (as mine did).  That can be really rough.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
============================<br/>
 <br/>
By &quot;fly&quot; do you mean move far away, or just do things like get jobs, go to  <br/>
college early, ride a bike across the continent?<br/>
 <br/>
If no one is winding the rubber band tighter and tighter and tighter, there  <br/>
probably won&#39;t be any sudden, wild, distant flight.<br/>
 <br/>
I haven&#39;t known any kids whose parents gave them freedoms early and who  were <br/>
supportive of them and did not declare that they would be on their own at  18 <br/>
who then wanted to move out before they were 18.  I&#39;m not saying there  <br/>
aren&#39;t any.  I&#39;m saying of the teens I&#39;ve seen grow up in the families I  knew when <br/>
they were little, when the parents were gentle attachment-parenting  types <br/>
(with or without unschooling) or unschoolers who were doing more than just  <br/>
saying they were unschoolers, but whose family lives really changed, none said  &quot;I <br/>
am out of here&quot; before they were 18, and none said it after, in that way and  <br/>
that tone.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of regular-parenting, always schooled families, I know two in which the  <br/>
parents (both times a parent and a step-parent, which may or may not be  <br/>
coincidental) went on and ON in advance of the kid being 18 that at 18 that kid  was on <br/>
his own.  One joined the air force.  One got a crummy job,  bought a crummy <br/>
car from a crummy relative and moved with a crummy girlfriend to  a crummy <br/>
apartment.  <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the darndest thing about that:  the families aren&#39;t under less  <br/>
stress, with that 18 year old boy gone.  Their rent is just as high.   Their water <br/>
and electricity aren&#39;t cheaper.  Maybe the food&#39;s a little  cheaper.  Maybe the <br/>
house is quieter.  <br/>
 <br/>
In another family (said &quot;homeschooling&quot; but did squat but pay for American  <br/>
School and yell at the kids about it seasonally) had a girl who went to babysit <br/>
 for someone with a six year old, and basically didn&#39;t go home much from then <br/>
 on.  Her parents didn&#39;t get along, her brother was horrible, she had an  <br/>
older sister who got pregnant as a teen, married the boyfriend and  moved to <br/>
Europe.  Being at the babysitting house was the best part of her  life.  She&#39;s 18 <br/>
now or 19, joined the national guard, and is in  Baghdad. <br/>
 <br/>
Although I think any of my kids could function as adults if suddenly  <br/>
orphaned, and while I think they&#39;re already prepared to be good mates and  parents, <br/>
I&#39;m in no hurry to shove them out and they&#39;re in no hurry to go.<br/>
 <br/>
When a family sets time limits and says &quot;When you&#39;re fifteen you can date&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;When you&#39;re sixteen you can stay out after midnight&quot; and other such  <br/>
limitations and &quot;goals,&quot; it makes it easy (maybe inevitable) for the child to  <br/>
think &quot;Yeah, and when I&#39;m 18 I can bail and stop being treated as a powerless  and <br/>
mindless child.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s in Europe without having to wait until she was 16, or 18 (didn&#39;t  <br/>
even have to wait for school to be out).  Kirby is across town on his own,  but <br/>
that&#39;s not a new privilege.  He&#39;s gone to this gaming shop 15 or 20  miles away <br/>
with increasingly regularity.  Marty&#39;s off camping with his dad,  but with <br/>
his dad and 1500 or so other people.  Keith might not see him  much, but I&#39;m not <br/>
worried.  Marty has his own tent and will go to sleep  every single night, at <br/>
some point.  My big worry is sunscreen.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m rambling, but intending to try to remind new readers (and old readers  <br/>
with only young children &lt;g&gt;) that if choices and freedoms are common and  <br/>
safety and mutual friendship are common, turning  18 doesn&#39;t become a special <br/>
threshhold in an unschooling  household.  [For the social security administration, <br/>
that&#39;s quite a  different matter, and when someone&#39;s collecting <br/>
mother-of-a-dependent-child  benefits, that and the child&#39;s check together are over $1000 a <br/>
month (maybe a  fair amount more, it&#39;s been a while since I knew and I don&#39;t <br/>
know what all the  factors might be), and the sudden loss of that much money is <br/>
BIGtime, and not an  arbitrary thing, and not an unexpected thing.]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I mean do things that are usually seen as &quot;grown up&quot; things, but it is<br/>
probable that people younger than 18 or 17 or 16 are also ready for<br/>
living completely independently.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean in a &quot;gotta escape this house and the parental units&quot;<br/>
way.  I mean in an exciting, ready to move into the larger world<br/>
because I know my parents support and love me kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
This week has been a week of reflection for me, as my daughter (15)<br/>
got her first &quot;real&quot; job working at the waterpark, has huge<br/>
responsibilities there that involve other people&#39;s safety, had to get<br/>
a work permit and fill out tax forms and open a checking account, take<br/>
CPR and first aid and water safety/rescue training, learned about<br/>
sexual predators at these parks and how to spot them and report them,<br/>
is learning about how a work schedule can dictate what you can and<br/>
cannot do the rest of the time (going to the park might work, but a<br/>
trip into the city might not because she has to be at work by 3pm, etc.). <br/>
<br/>
I suppose it seems young to me to do all that and learn all that<br/>
because I am looking at it through my public-schooled background. <br/>
Maybe it isn&#39;t so much that she is ready younger than most, but that<br/>
she has the freedom to do those things at a younger age?  Probably if<br/>
more kids had that freedom it wouldn&#39;t seem so unusual.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392173419">My daughter plans to move out at 16 (she&#39;s 12 now). Four or five years ago, the plan was to livbe with me forever, and get a really big bed so that I could sleep on one side of her and her husband could sleep on the other. I don&#39;t really know what she&#39;ll want to do in 4 years... but she&#39;s comfortable being a lot more independent than most 12 year olds. <br/>
