<div id="ygrps-yiv-37279856">Since the conference-goers are still being oh-so-quiet (traveling, <br/>
exhausted, too overloaded with extreme joy to want to come back to our <br/>
mundane world &lt;G&gt;), I&#39;m going to hijack the list for one day for my own <br/>
(non-nefarious) purposes. Here&#39;s the deal:<br/>
<br/>
I have to come up with an organization name - today.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a bunch of unschoolers, BUT here is what I want:<br/>
<br/>
1. sounds enough like a school name that it won&#39;t stand out when listed <br/>
among 80 or so schools<br/>
2. sounds enough like a youth group/organization that the local parks <br/>
department will let us camp in the youth group area<br/>
3. sounds enough like an unschooling support organization or at least a <br/>
&quot;learning support&quot; organization that we can sponsor speakers and hold <br/>
workshops and qualify as a nonprofit organization that does those <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Reasons:<br/>
1. We want to set up an organization that can sponsor &quot;teams&quot; of <br/>
homeschooled kids doing things such as Destination Imagination. For <br/>
this we don&#39;t want to sound at all strange. We&#39;ve been doing it under <br/>
&quot;DragonTree Home Learners&quot; and we feel that we&#39;ve experienced some <br/>
anti-homeschooling discrimination from appraisers - many of whom are <br/>
teachers - and we want to try it this year while competing on a more <br/>
level playing field.<br/>
<br/>
2. We want to camp out in our very lovely large regional park, which <br/>
allows youth groups such as the YMCA and scouts to camp, but not <br/>
informal groups of individual families.<br/>
<br/>
3. We want to bring Sandra here to speak about unschooling and I want <br/>
to give a series of talks about joyful mathematics. To rent the rooms <br/>
we want to use, we have to pay over three times as much if we&#39;re not a <br/>
nonprofit organization. We might want to have other speakers, too, in <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
4. The DI team wants to do some fundraising. Local businesses will ONLY <br/>
support nonprofit organizations or schools. Most DI teams are <br/>
associated with a school and do their fundraising that way, but ours is <br/>
not, of course. For example, local fast food places and restaurants <br/>
will have special nights where we get 10 percent of the spending by <br/>
anybody coming in with one of our fliers. We need a nonprofit <br/>
organization to sponsor us.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m picturing this like a venn diagram - three circles with an <br/>
overlapping part in the center where all three conditions have to be <br/>
satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any hope?<br/>
We&#39;re stymied.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512952774">How about something like &quot;DragonTree Association for Cooperative Learning&quot; <br/>
or &quot;DragonTree Cooperative Learning Association&quot; or something like <br/>
that?  Or, you could use the geographic location in the name instead of <br/>
&quot;DragonTree&quot; (like, I would use &quot;Orange County Cooperative Learning <br/>
Association,&quot; being that I&#39;m in Orange County, New York).  You could also <br/>
use something like &quot;DragonTree Center for Cooperative Learning,&quot; but the <br/>
word &quot;center&quot; might be confusing to folks who are expecting you to have <br/>
a...well...center.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get other ideas, but maybe these ideas <br/>
will help get other ideas that will work well for you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

avoid working, which I really ought not do, but...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949378801">**We&#39;ve been doing it under<br/>
&quot;DragonTree Home Learners&quot; and we feel that we&#39;ve experienced some<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know much of anything about non-profit organizations.  I assume <br/>
you have to have a lofty purpose.  Have you put in words what your <br/>
purpose is?<br/>
<br/>
For coming up with a name, I&#39;m tempted to break the name into two <br/>
parts.  There are some adjectives at the beginning of the name, and then <br/>
at the end there is a noun: e.g. learners, people, group, school, or <br/>
some-word-that-sounds-like-school-but-is-a-little-different.<br/>
<br/>
You want probably some kind of more buttoned down adjectives than <br/>
&quot;Dragon Tree&quot;.  And then the second half of the naming problem is what <br/>
kind of noun do you want to be?  I&#39;d probably try to solve the noun part <br/>
first, and then add some pleasant but possibly meaningless adjectives.  <br/>
Either something geographic or something uplifting or something Latin &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I named our &quot;school&quot; Hillside Academy.  I picked &quot;academy&quot; because I <br/>
really didn&#39;t want to use the word &quot;school&quot;.  &quot;Hillside&quot; is a pun on my <br/>
name (Hill) which notes that my son learns at my side.  But it sounds <br/>
bland enough that it isn&#39;t obvious that it&#39;s got a joke embedded in it.  <br/>
(I&#39;m not suggesting that you have to sneak a joke into your name.  It&#39;s <br/>
just my way of enjoying a rather bland name.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy, not really getting anywhere<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS   When pondering nouns, &quot;coalition&quot; came to mind.  But perhaps that <br/>
sounds too warlike? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other possibilities:  group, team,  um... forum, society, lyceum,  um...<br/>
<br/>
School names just don&#39;t sound like youth group names?  I don&#39;t know any <br/>
youth group names, except Scouts of various genders.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-936598875">Hi all-<br/>
I&#39;m brand new (first post!), and I am exhausted because I just drove home (to Canada) from the conference last night, BUT I couldn&#39;t resist jumping in here before I go to bed. Love this challenge! I like an acronym, because it kind of gives you a &quot;nickname&quot; to use if/when needed. It can also allow you to be slightly &quot;vague&quot; about who you are! How about CAL? &quot;Center for Alternative Learning&quot;? Something like that? Then, if you wanted to, you could throw &quot;School&quot; in if it better suited the occasion: CAL School. Um...CAIL? Center for Alternative and Independent Learning? Again, as others have suggested, you could play with it and put your geographic location in there somewhere if it works.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911685831">Hello.  I have been just reading for about a month or so now.  My son is only 23 months but I am certain I don&#39;t want to put him in public school.  I am finding these posts interesting and enlightening.  Thanks!   I am wondering about the organization name.  Perhaps, as Sheila said, the acronym could be suitable for home/unschooling while the full name sounded more official.  Something like: ATHOME = Association To Heighten Orange county M....  Education ?   Ok...the only thing I can think of in my half asleep state for M is munchkin or something...probably wouldn&#39;t work.  But the rest might.  Hope it helps.        Khrys<br/>

of work for 2 days - yeesh! Anyhow, just wanted to toss in another <br/>
tidbit in this discussion. In addition to having a cool sounding <br/>
name, they might want to see your non-profit ID (which schools and <br/>
others have already). Our support group incorporated as a non-profit <br/>
last year and it was a long journey - who knew there were gazillions <br/>
of different non-profit type statuses. We got it so that we can do <br/>
things like rent space some day for an actual &quot;center&quot; to keep our <br/>
lending library and other resources and not be at the mercy of the <br/>
library, the children&#39;s museum, the community center when scheduling <br/>
events.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543269227">Betsy, were you at the conference?  The last speaker was Sandra.  <br/>
She talked about the diffence between beginning unschoolers and <br/>
advanced unschoolers.  In the beginning, unschoolers are afraid of <br/>
what people will say so they hide what they are doing.  People hide <br/>
from advanced unschoolers because they are sooo confident that they <br/>
can out answer anyone.  Ok, I&#39;m probably botching what she said, but <br/>
there will come a day when you will have enough confidence in your <br/>
decision that you will have answers for everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
If your kids are smaller, maybe it will help you to keep a journal <br/>
or a log of what you and the kids do.  My kids are older and we <br/>
don&#39;t do as many field trips but we do a lot more conversing and <br/>
answering questions and figuring things out.  Those things are hard <br/>
to journal because who can remember everything you talked about by <br/>
the end of the day.  I&#39;ve found that when someone asks me what we do <br/>
all day, I give them one anecdote of something we did that was cool <br/>
and tell them how much the kids learned from that one activity.  I <br/>
guess I sound convincing because I rarely get asked twice.<br/>

============<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the reasons I started my blog. It shows the kinds of things we do all day and how all the days look different. Of course, my kids are younger--7, 5 and 4--so it may be easy for someone to accept that but still question for the older kids. You&#39;re welcome to send her there. I&#39;m hoping that as my kids grow, I&#39;ll end up with a kind of document that can reassure people and serve as a resource for them as well.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re uncomfortable answering that kind of a question, having a couple of resources that you could spout off might take the pressure off. You could just say, &quot;Oh, there are some wonderful resources that talk about exactly that--you should really check them out.&quot; Or, something of the sort.<br/>
<br/>
That, of course, doesn&#39;t get down to the deeper question of why you think you&#39;re not comfortable with unschooling at the cellular level. *g* I don&#39;t know what makes me confident; I doubt I &quot;get it&quot; any better than you do. It may be that my kids are still young and there&#39;s less doubting with Em not reading at 7 than there will be when she&#39;s 10. It may be that because of teaching and my research that I&#39;m more comfortable translating or seeing the learning in all kinds of things, not just schooly things. It&#39;ll be interesting for me to watch my own evolution--to see if the confidence stays or wavers. I have no words of wisdom on this front other than to tell you to just watch your kids, really sit back and observe them totally without bias and they&#39;re sure to amaze you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-706115072">I find I have days (even weeks) when I feel a little worried that I&#39;m neglecting something -- we&#39;ll spend several consecutive days just hanging out at home, watching TV, on the &#39;puter, etc.  Sure, I get the laundry, the boys play with each other, but still I feel like I should be doing more.<br/>
 <br/>
Then we&#39;ll have a day, or two or even three, when we&#39;re busy -- not always things that look all that important, either.  This week, for example -- I&#39;d been feeling sluggish, like we&#39;d spent too much time home last week (forgetting the multiple times we&#39;ve been to the museums & zoo in the last month).  Monday, we didn&#39;t do much but hang around the house -- I was feeling restless and guilty.  Tuesday, tho, went like this:  I stitched a cape to a t-shirt for Andy -- he played The Silver Snake Superhero (his creation) for a while; we went to the library, where we read a few books, and checked out several too.  Then off to the playground nearby, where I pitched and both boys hit the ball, I kicked the soccer ball with Dan, the boys chased (twice) a roadrunner until it got smart and jumped over the fence, they rode the bouncy toys and climbed the playset; we then hit the bank, bought lunch out and hit another playground.  Yesterday, Andy decided to make a card for my mil (her b&#39;day is<br/>
 coming up soon, she&#39;s been recovering from surgery and he realized she&#39;s feeling better).  He spent more than an hour drawing and coloring just the right picture (a dancining tiki on a surfboard, on a big wave) only to run out of room for the head.  We glued an extension on the homemade card and he finished his picture then dictated the greeting and signed his name.  His friend arrived for a playdate, we packed up our park toys and went to the playground.  The bigger boys played baseball, roamed all over the (huge) park, and had a great time.  Dan (3) was all over the playset, monkey bars, etc; we played freeze tag, dug a tunnel in the sand, and he showed off for a 3yo girl nearby (had to be for her, he&#39;s never that showy for me!).  He ran -- he runs just beautifully -- somehow I&#39;ve missed noticing that before today.  <br/>
 <br/>
Today?  We&#39;re home again, dh has my car (his is in repair) so we&#39;re limited to the neighborhood park, and the boys are still asleep.  It feels okay to be kinda sluggish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My point is that we&#39;re often much more active and constantly learning as unschoolers than it looks to the ultra-organized, structured learning school-at-homers.  Our goal, tho, is to enjoy watching our kids unfold at their own pace and readiness -- their goal is to &#39;provide a better education (subjective to their opinion) than the schools.&#39;   We&#39;ve rejected their path -- they don&#39;t even begin to understand ours.<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t need to compete with them -- we don&#39;t share the same destination.<br/>

Yeah, that&#39;s a good idea that makes it less personal.  If she had asked <br/>

I am around people who unschooled until the age of about six and then <br/>
gave up and switched to more formal homeschooling.  I&#39;m not near to <br/>
anyone who is unschooling at the age of 10.  But my personal (eclectic) <br/>
friends are quite supportive and when I get worried always point out how <br/>
much my kid seems to know. <br/>

Good advice.  This weekend (when dad&#39;s home) is probably the perfect <br/>
time to go river kayaking, since we&#39;ve got kayaks, we&#39;ve got a river <br/>
running right by, and a heat wave headed in this weekend.  And I&#39;m going <br/>
to do some Fridays at the beach with other homeschooling moms, starting <br/>
next week.  (We&#39;re traffic-avoidant this weekend._  And I think we&#39;ll <br/>
hit the Farmer&#39;s Market tonight and get extra food for the friends who <br/>
are visiting tomorrow.</div>

<br/>
I think I&#39;d also tend to focus on interests rather than academic stuff, per se. Like I would divert talk from reading, workbooks, etc. to conversation like, &quot;Emily&#39;s really interested in Egypt right now and anything to do with mythology, so we&#39;ve reading all about that.

<br/>
I think the key is to come up with ways to shift the conversation from academic ground to interest ground, if that makes any sense. Don&#39;t let those other folks define the terms of learning for you and your kids--when you let them do that, you let in those fears and doubts. If you constantly shift the ground away from them, their beliefs, not yours, will be the ones in question. They&#39;ll be saying things like, &quot;Wow! they go into all that stuff without teaching?

<br/>
Absolutely!  I&#39;ve been thinking of this analogy lately.  Academics, in a<br/>
sense, are the tools.  Students spend years learning to use the tools, in<br/>
preparation for the day they get to build something.  Unschoolers are busy<br/>
building, and can&#39;t help but learn to use the tools while doing so.<br/>

I know this is late and you&#39;re probably already feeling better about <br/>
this, but I just wanted to chime in here and say that I used to feel <br/>
that way, too, but I&#39;ve come to look at others&#39; opinions of <br/>
unschooling the way I look at others&#39; opinions of extended <br/>
breastfeeding and co-sleeping: I think what I do is right for me and <br/>
my family and I understand it might make other people uncomfortable, <br/>
but I can&#39;t help that.  I do sometimes feel that I need to &quot;educate&quot; <br/>
friends and family about the benefits of unschooling but I remember <br/>
feeling that way with bfing too.  It never worked and I would only <br/>
get more tense about it, so I stopped trying to make my case.  The <br/>
suggestions about telling them where they can find more information <br/>
are great.  That usually works around here.  My ex-SIL, OTOH, always <br/>
wanted to argue (&quot;They *need* to be exposed to bullying&quot; of all <br/>
things), and I finally had to tell her that it&#39;s not up for <br/>
discussion and I would never presume to tell her how to raise her <br/>
child and I would appreciate the same respect.    <br/>
<br/>
That said, I do sometimes feel those &quot;pesky competitive feelings&quot; <br/>
but only when I&#39;m wondering what other people are thinking about my <br/>
kids.  That&#39;s just a silly thing for me to do, because there is <br/>
always going to be something about my family life that people are <br/>
going to disagree with.  That&#39;s just the way it is.  When *I* think <br/>
about my kids, I think they are smart, special, creative, and very, <br/>
very individual.  It turns my stomach to think about sending them to <br/>
school and I am proud that we are doing what feels right to us. :)<br/>

I don&#39;t know that I have anything helpful to say, except that this tin can<br/>
image is wonderful. It has made me start thinking of &quot;Just Married&quot; behind a<br/>
car - a merging or blending of two lifestyles. Maybe that is what you are<br/>
doing - going through a process of joining your respect for &quot;book learning&quot;<br/>
and the unschooling concept of &quot;life learning&quot;. They don&#39;t have to be<br/>
mutually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
If you are disrespecting the media-drenched parts of unschooling, it could<br/>
be felt by your kids as disrespecting some of their interests. Just an idea<br/>
for you to mull over.<br/>

Great image!<br/>
<br/>
I used to feel a bit like that but it has worn off over the years and I never let my kids know. I have finally gotten rid of it but I wouldn&#39;t recommend the method. Having Celyn who has cerebral palsy and brain damage has finally taught me what is important. And that is loving your kids and letting them be who they are.<br/>
<br/>
Celyn may never know what a book is, let alone hold one. But she will know how to smile and be happy and she will know I love her. And thats the important thing. The rest, talking, seeing, academia, reading, building a weather station in the back yard, etc etc is all icing on the cake (or frosting as you lot say...) and thats the main thing really, for ALL children.<br/>
<br/>
Are they happy and do they know mum loves them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m right here with you but perhaps I&#39;ve detatched a few more tin cans than you have <br/>
(great image!! btw).<br/>
<br/>
My older two kids have enrolled in public school this year (high school) and are going to it <br/>
four hours a day. I&#39;ve realized that for all of my unschooling rhetoric, the bigger message <br/>
that has gotten through to them is that college is Very Important and that preparation <br/>
requires Hard Work.<br/>
<br/>
Last night after a long heart to heart with our &quot;senior&quot; (and a week of soul searching with <br/>
my husband), we realized we had unwittingly done what we had never intended to do <br/>
consciously. We are both extremely frustrated with the school system seeing it up close <br/>
now. And my oldest suddenly realized last night that he doesn&#39;t want to waste another <br/>
minute of his LIFE getting ready for something that he isn&#39;t even sure he wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
It was a eureka moment. He&#39;s withdrawing on Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
My sophomore daughter is face-to-face with kids who wish they could go back in time to <br/>
kill Shakespeare so that they wouldn&#39;t ahve to study him. She&#39;s taking classes where the <br/>
teachers move kids to new seats if they are having too much fun with each other working <br/>
on a project. She is studying materials that we have already used (with more creativity and <br/>
energy) two-four years ago (Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, Clues to Acting <br/>
Shakespeare, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Last night I felt like I had finally crossed all the way over the unschooling threshhold. The <br/>
little nagging doubts and hold out thoughts were smashed beneath my oldest son&#39;s <br/>
realization that he will live first and figure out what to do with his LIFE later.<br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;ll see what my dd decides to do. But I am finally at peace that this nagging doubt <br/>
about the value of school is behind me.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Shyrley,  This is a really good point.<br/>
<br/>
Give Celyn extra hugs and cuddles from me today.    :-)   )The other <br/>
kids, too, if you can catch them.)<br/>
