&gt; Woman<br/>
&gt; were all on.  They were my heroes.  Jaime Sommers in particular.  I&#39;m still<br/>
&gt; a huge fan of Lindsey Wagner and Jackie Smith. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I loved Wonder Woman too.  I think I was her for Halloween at least 3 times. <br/>

Woman. He also mostly did murals of her in art. I have no idea how he turned <br/>
out.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s why I loved Xena too ( well, that and the lesbian subtext!)<br/>

something. <br/>

&gt; Kelly<br/>
&gt; (Bionic wannabe)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I never watched that, but I saw the series finale.  When all those girls <br/>
&gt; became slayers, the girl playing Little League, etc,  I cried.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, yah, how does Buffy slay with high heeled shoes?  My hubby said they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; extra spikes for the vampires?  lol <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Buffy is much cooler than the rest of us. (Sort of like Joni Mitchell)  <br/>
I don&#39;t even know how Ordinary, non-super-power people walk in high heels.<br/>

I guess I like to be teased. lol  They kissed in the series finale, but it <br/>
was a gyp. (SP?) But the Sappho poem, now there was a fantastic romantic moment. <br/>
 True love and all that. ;-) <br/>
