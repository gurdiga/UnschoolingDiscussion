&lt;&lt; It&#39;s more often than not a chemistry that&#39;s already there when<br/>
 they act off each other that we end up seeing the result of in love scenes.<br/>

    You guys talking about chemistry, I gotta add my pov here. <br/>
<br/>
    Any scene where the chemistry is hot, the people involved are usually <br/>
*not* involved romantically with each other. <br/>
<br/>
    I personally think it is much easier to stay in character as someone&#39;s <br/>
lover if they are not *really* your lover.  When you are in love with them,  <br/>
it&#39;s too easy to be self conscious, and the scene goes nowhere good.    When you <br/>
don&#39;t know them well, your creativity is sparked, and that&#39;s where that <br/>
fantastic on-screen chemistry can come from.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s quite a few examples of this, like Tom and Nicole in the Kubrick <br/>
film, Ben and JLo in Gigi, both got bad reviews because of no on screen chemistry, <br/>
real life lovers.   <br/>
<br/>
Now if you&#39;re a really good actor or actress, and you are in the moment, this <br/>
shouldn&#39;t matter, but.....lol<br/>
