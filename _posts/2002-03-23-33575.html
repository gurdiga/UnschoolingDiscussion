<div id="ygrps-yiv-370936740"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;there are rules for gymnastics.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gymnastics has been a great way for Casey to get some structure in her life. <br/>
She&#39;s learned so much more than just gymnastics too. You know, the usual <br/>
teamwork, discipline, overcoming stage fright, etc.  And the kind of full <br/>
body movements they use are so good for calming her down and helping her <br/>
focus.<br/>
<br/>
The gym we go to is very aware when  a girl gets overwhelmed and needs to <br/>
take a break. They have been very supportive of Casey&#39;s quirks and unusual <br/>
learning style. She did drop it once when she felt burned out, but has <br/>
picked it up again with renewed vigor. This was the same kid who decided not <br/>
to go school part-time because it would interfere with her life too much. <br/>
For Casey, unschooling has been the key to opening so many paths.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
