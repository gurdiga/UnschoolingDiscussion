 </span></blockquote>LOVED this story! Sandra, I think you should collect some<br/>
just-be-quiet-and-watch stories. When Zoe was maybe 5 and 6 she used to use<br/>
little toys to trace pictures and words. Toys, so nothing was actually being<br/>
traced. Then she used pencils and pens, but she would trace pages and pages<br/>
of words. We still have no idea what she liked about it, but it was<br/>
obviously important for her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the answer I should use for when people ask me &quot;What did you do<br/>
to get such a great motivated child?&quot; &quot;Oh, we watched her trace for months<br/>
and months.&quot; &lt;ggg&gt;.<br/>

time. Cameron busied himself with pen and paper. He had a toy. He kept <br/>
picking it up, turning it upside down, putting it down, drawing, picking it up, <br/>
turning it upside down, .......<br/>
<br/>
When he was &quot;done&quot;, he brought it over to me. In a slightly wiggly, but VERY <br/>
legible scrawl, we read &quot;Made in China&quot;! &lt;G&gt; I still have that piece of paper! <br/>
