&lt;&lt;My son wants to go to collage and now says he can not go because he will <br/>
not get a GED or a diploma.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the college he wants to go to. Many will take homeschoolers <br/>
without a diploma. Some want a diploma or GED, some want SAT&#39;s and some a <br/>
combination of all of them. Some will just look at a portfolio or essay of <br/>
accomplishments. If he wants a GED, he can go and get one. You can also make <br/>
a diploma for him if that&#39;s important.<br/>
