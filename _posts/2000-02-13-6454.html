<div id="ygrps-yiv-341810518">Thea, I have 8 kids, 3 girls, age 27, 24, and 20 and 5 boys age 22, 18,<br/>
15, 11 and 8. The 15, 11 and 8 yo are the ones we are schooling at home.<br/>
We took the boys out of public school last spring because all of the boys<br/>
are dyslexic and the school just was not interested in trying anything<br/>
new to help them. The basic attitude was they will grow up to be garbage<br/>
men so why bother, I had a problem with this. If my child wants to be a<br/>
garbage man than ok, but no one has the right to tell him to. Erick, the<br/>
8 yo could not read, at all, barely recognized 1/2 of the alphabet and<br/>
they passed him to 2nd grade, when I objected they told me that he would<br/>
never be normal and they had to keep his self esteem up, he has no self<br/>
esteem problems and I have never met a &quot;normal&quot; person, the uniqueness is<br/>
what makes people interesting. Anyway that was what made my final<br/>
decision, I had been looking into it for 2 years, but to be honest did<br/>
not know if I was patient enough to give them the education they deserve,<br/>
now I wonder why it took me so long. They are so much happier and are<br/>
learning and no one calls them dummies, that happened alot in school. I<br/>
was lucky enough to have a sister in law that had homeschooled for 16<br/>
years to help me get started, our methods are very different, but she<br/>
helped me more than I can say, unfortunately she lives about a thousand<br/>
miles away so the day to day support is not there and she is a<br/>
traditionalist so the email is not her style, although I am slowly making<br/>
inroads there. My husband shares the learning disability of the boys and<br/>
he is a field mechanic and machinist so I am very aware that they can<br/>
succeed if they are given a good chance, he travels alot with his job and<br/>
now the kids and I go visit where he is working, the learning<br/>
opportunities are limitless and we learn together about the places we are<br/>
going to visit or want to visit. We play a game we call fantasy vacation,<br/>
we pick a place we want to go, learn as much as we can about it and plan<br/>
a vacation, we decide where we would stay, eat, go visit, what the<br/>
weather would be like, it is fun and I am learning as much as they do. I<br/>
am so sorry I did not have the courage to do this for my other kids, they<br/>
missed so much and so did I by trusting that the school knew best. I have<br/>
I have 11 grandchildren and will homeschool or help with most of them, it<br/>
has become a family commitment.<br/>

Thank you for the encouragement, I sent out another letter earlier that<br/>
explains why I feel it is so important to defend ones right to religion<br/>
even if it is not my belief, but thank you for caring how I felt even<br/>
though we may never be able to comminicate our beliefs to each other<br/>
enough to make a solid understanding, I can always use a new friend or an<br/>
old one for that matter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345498980">When they find our we are in a minority religious group and homeschool<br/>
as well....you can just see &quot;fringe lunatic&quot; in their eyes as they size<br/>
me up and shake their heads at the fate of my poor children. It sure<br/>
would be nice to get some POSITIVE reinforcement for a change.<br/>
<br/>
Oh Nanci, it sure is nice to know that I&#39;m not the only one  feeling<br/>
this way.  As I posted before , my son has been diagnosed ADHD,  and I<br/>
can really see the difference in him when he&#39;s been around negative<br/>
people.  It&#39;s really hard to be positive all the time , but I do try to<br/>
for my son&#39;s sake.  After his weekly court-ordered visits  with my birth<br/>
vehicle, he is very negative, argumentative, and just plain hard to be<br/>
around.  It really makes me wonder what kind of garbage she&#39;s filling<br/>
his head with.  On the other hand, he&#39;s with his father every weekend,<br/>
and he never comes home with this crappy attitude. We both use positive<br/>
reinforcements with him and I do believe that makes a difference. Every<br/>
one needs a pat on the back every now and then.  I too have very<br/>
different religious beliefs, and because of that my birth vehicle has<br/>
convinced  most of my extended family that I&#39;m brainwashed.  Just wait<br/>
til they find out we&#39;re unschooling !!    No pat on the back for me !!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We ran into that a lot.  In order to correct the &#39;problem&#39;, I started making <br/>
a point of telling DS a subject we covered when he&#39;d ask a question/find an <br/>
answer.  We&#39;d explore something, go for a walk, make cookies, whatever and <br/>
I&#39;d say, gee, we can count that as our PE/math/science/language arts/ what <br/>
ever for today.  He&#39;d stop and smile and acknowledge the coolness of the <br/>
whole process and go about his business.  Now DS, age 12, can rattle off the <br/>
&#39;subjects&#39; we&#39;ve been pursuing with the best of them.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do this constantly, just often enough to start bringing it to his <br/>
awareness.  Now, we&#39;ll talk about or explore something and he&#39;ll say, &#39;Gee, I <br/>
guess we just did (fill in the blank), huh mom?&#39; <br/>
<br/>
When others ask him what he&#39;s learning they usually aren&#39;t interested enough <br/>
to find out HOW he&#39;s learning it.  In fact, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had <br/>
anyone spend enough time and attention to his answer to have him explain what <br/>
sorts of things we are doing.  Some of them get to hear the beginnings of an <br/>
explanation, but then they are ready to be off on different topics because <br/>
they were only being polite to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  It&#39;s okay to feel like you aren&#39;t accomplishing anything <br/>
sometimes.  Looking back, it seems to me that the first through third grade <br/>
age was the hardest to resist the need to school at home.  That&#39;s when all <br/>
the other kids are starting school and learning to read and all.  That&#39;s when <br/>
I still had a sense of &#39;you know, it&#39;s not too late, you could change your <br/>
mind and enroll him in PS and he&#39;d be able to catch up&#39;.  Ugh!  After you are <br/>
past age 8 or 9 and see that kidlets really are learning something from their <br/>
daily activities, it gets a lot easier.  I felt much easier when my youngster <br/>
started reading his older brother&#39;s books.  There is 10 yrs between the two <br/>
of them and younger DS wasn&#39;t at all afraid to read older DS&#39;s books from <br/>
about age 7 or 8.  He didn&#39;t understand all of the material, but he was up to <br/>
the challenge of trying.  He read rather major novels from start to finish.  <br/>
He understood the words, just missed many of the implications.  Now as he <br/>
re-reads those same books, he tells me all about the things he didn&#39;t <br/>
understand then that he understands now.  It&#39;s a great experience for him to <br/>
realize that review never hurt anyone and that we sometimes understand things <br/>
much better with more experience.  (Doesn&#39;t hurt mom&#39;s credibility, either, <br/>
for him to realize that life experience often brings greater understanding.  <br/>
heheheh)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that was a turning point for me.<br/>
<br/>
Out of self defense, DS has learned to tell people that everyone learns at a <br/>
different pace.  He has a cousin that loved to tell him how stupid DS was <br/>
because he didn&#39;t go to school.  (We heard a lot of other PS propaganda from <br/>
that kid, too.  I was amazed to hear the exact same words coming out of his <br/>
mouth as the phrases spouted by NEA.  I don&#39;t know whether it was his father <br/>
explaining why the cousins couldn&#39;t homeschool or the PS teacher defending <br/>
her job.  But that&#39;s sort of a different issue.)  <br/>
<br/>
We waited and watched.  Pretty soon it became obvious that there were topics <br/>
DS was covering which his cousin had no clue about.  When cousin realized DS <br/>
knew more about different things, DS simply pointed out to him that everyone <br/>
learns things at a different pace.  Just because we have not formally covered <br/>
a topic before the cousins, does not mean we&#39;ll never learn it and ps cousins <br/>
aren&#39;t required to keep pace with DS, either.  <br/>
<br/>
(I over heard the conversation that day and was bursting with pride at the <br/>
way DS handled his over bearing and bossy cousin.  I&#39;ll probably burn in hell <br/>
for that one, but it was worth it!  &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your kids.  If you need more structure to your schedule, do what you <br/>
need to for your family, setting bed times or nap times or story times and <br/>
dinner times, etc.  But, don&#39;t feel you need to follow the ps schedule or <br/>
anyone else&#39;s, for that matter!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I love the freedom of unschooling, but there is <br/>
 also something chaotic about it and it is a very difficult concept to <br/>
 explain to family & friends.   My kids have been telling people that they do <br/>
 nothing for school.  You can guess the reaction by all to that!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might want to coach them a bit on how to respond to some of <br/>
these questions.  After a grocery shopping trip where the clerk asked<br/>
if they were in school and my dd said no we homeschool, and the clerk<br/>
said oh your mom teaches you?  Dd says &quot;no&quot;?  sorta like why would<br/>
you say that LOL.  I just sort of laughed and said something like<br/>
we learn from the world around us blah blah.  Anyhow after that I<br/>
talked to my dd.  I said that some kids go to school and are taught <br/>
by teachers.  I said you are at home and we learn from everything <br/>
around us.  We go places and do things and everywhere we go<br/>
(and when we don&#39;t go) and everyday we learn something.  We don&#39;t <br/>
have to be in a school to learn things.  She really took to that and<br/>
now is apt to say if questioned that we go places and do things<br/>
or that we learn everywhere we go....<br/>
I love www.unschooling.com  -- they have great essays and message<br/>
boards.  One of the boards is titled, Dealing with Reluctance with sub<br/>
folders for spouses, family, friends. ..this might give you some suggestions<br/>
on how to deal with others.  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; The <br/>
 father was allegedly outrageously abusive to the children and when the <br/>
 authorities where called by a public school teacher, that&#39;s when the father <br/>
 took them out of ps and homeschooled them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to teach 9th grade, though, and I saw abuse.  Sometimes kids would be <br/>
kept home for a few days until the bruises went away.   The first time I was <br/>
in a big discussion about homeschooling (at a playgroup) someone there said <br/>
&quot;WHY would the schools be so [resistent, or worried or something]&quot; and I said <br/>
&quot;They&#39;re afraid the kids are being butt-f-----&quot; and although it was a *VERY* <br/>
indelicate thing to say, many people who have not done public education or <br/>
social work fail to consider that. <br/>
<br/>
For kids who are being abused, public school is their safe-line to <br/>
civilization and the possibility of finding out that what&#39;s going on at their <br/>
house isn&#39;t okay, and that there might be assistance available.  <br/>
<br/>
When we decided to homeschool, I talked to a couple of adult friends (both <br/>
single men, and we had boys) and told them that if my boys EVER came to them <br/>
complaining of abuse--physical, sexual, ANYTHING--they were to take the boys&#39; <br/>
side against us if necessary and do whatever was right to do.   Then I told <br/>
the boys &quot;If you ever think what&#39;s going on here isn&#39;t right and you&#39;re <br/>
afraid to talk to me or dad, go to Paul or Jeff and they will help you.<br/>
<br/>
Paul&#39;s moved out of state.  I should probably renew this deal.  On the other <br/>
hand, now that the kids are 8, 11 and 14 (the youngest is a girl) and I knew <br/>
them and their communications better, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as necessary.  But <br/>
because of this conversation, I should probably arrange for another emergency <br/>
outlet.  It&#39;s educational for the friends I solicit for the job too.<br/>

Hello! Thank you for thinking about me. Yeah, we&#39;re okay. Things are settling <br/>
down a bit.<br/>
DD is still doing her thing. I am still biting my tongue off. I have kind of <br/>
cracked down on the watching t.v. thing though for as long as it takes to get <br/>
certain things down around the house. My thought is if she thinks she is <br/>
going to watch t.v. all day and not pick up her room or take a shower or help <br/>
with the little  things, then she has another thing coming!LOL! She dug her <br/>
heels in for  a few days and we had some battles but they were battles we <br/>
needed. Sometimes it takes a mother to remove herself from a situation to <br/>
gain some control. My daughter was of the mindset  that since she didnt have <br/>
to go to school then she didnt have anybody to listen to. I went along with <br/>
that for a while , but a person can only take so much of back talk and what <br/>
shall I call it? ummm..........very subtle noncompliance. I really dont mean <br/>
that she should bow to my every whim but I do expect  S.O.M.E. respect. I <br/>
really am an easy going person and dont expect a whole lot. <br/>
I do have to admit to looking in to some online curriculums like Conlara and <br/>
Laurel Springs. Im just so confused right now. I think. I keep going back and <br/>
forth with it. I have forced days out of the house for Riding Lessons that <br/>
she does enjoy and errands and stuff.I find trying to keep her busy has made <br/>
her cut down on her eating out of being bored.  Her attitude has definately <br/>
shown a turn around on the days we just spend out of the house together. <br/>
On a better note , the family has faded off into the distance for now. I <br/>
havent heard anything else about it. Maybe the holidays? Maybe they got the <br/>
picture? (probably not).<br/>
Anyway Thank You for thinking about me , that made me feel good.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.<br/>

We had a great Thanksgiving! We spent much needed time with family. We<br/>
played lots of games, which is one of my favorite things. We are in the<br/>
process of packing. We are moving to Bryan from Houston. Not far but<br/>
stilll the same work. It means I have to clean piles and go through<br/>
things, YUK!  Anyway, good for you. Hang in there it sounds like it is<br/>
getting better. I have a young dd (4). I have learned to say &quot;O.K. we&#39;re<br/>
going now&quot;  and not give her the opportunity to reject. I know she is<br/>
going to get something out of it (good, or not) and so we just go and do<br/>
and sometimes she fusses and I think Oh well. And then she has a good<br/>
time. go figure.  She gets lots of choices on things but sometimes she<br/>
just has to go along with the family/schedule, in good humor or not.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how I would handle my family if they had a family discussion<br/>
about me and my decisions (i&#39;m sure they do but they are not yet brave<br/>
enough to say it to me). I  find that I avoid the subject just so we<br/>
don&#39;t go there and I don&#39;t have to explain our lives to them.  They just<br/>
think we are weird, or maybe they just don&#39;t want to think about it?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello, all:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am new to this list. I am a sahm/wahm from Michigan (Detroit area)<br/>
&gt;and I just took my girls out of public school in January. My daughters<br/>
&gt;are almost 11 years old (12 in April) and almost 9 years old (9 in<br/>
&gt;May). I also have an almost 7 week old son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I noticed, after reading some of the postings, that some of you have<br/>
&gt;daughters who are my kid&#39;s ages. Would any of your girls want to<br/>
&gt;become e-mail pals with my girls? They have been asking me every day<br/>
&gt;about finding some pen pals who also home school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I fell into this unschooling thing --- I was pregnant, miserable and<br/>
&gt;tired, so they pretty much guided themselves to what they wanted to<br/>
&gt;learn when I first took them out of public school in January. Then,<br/>
&gt;when my son was born, well ... you all know what it&#39;s like having a<br/>
&gt;newborn --- so they kept pursuing their own interests because of the<br/>
&gt;demands of the baby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This unschooling thing seems very natural --- just like it felt when<br/>
&gt;they were very small and I taught them throughout the day --- or they<br/>
&gt;investigated the world around them on their own. However, on the other<br/>
&gt;hand, I feel like I should be giving them more structure and so do<br/>
&gt;they --- they want worksheets and assignments. I bought some<br/>
&gt;worksheet books and they use them occasionally. But mostly they love<br/>
&gt;to play Barbie&#39;s, make doll clothes, draw, write, read, do computer<br/>
&gt;games or play with Lego&#39;s. Hmmm. I&#39;m just new to this and trying to<br/>
&gt;adjust ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any advice? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m doing okay and should just keep doing<br/>
&gt;what I&#39;m doing, but then the guilt sets in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>
&gt;Nancy from Michigan<br/>

Thanks! Yes, they are unschooling very naturally. It&#39;s the way I <br/>
raised them before they were old enough to go to ps and it&#39;s the way <br/>
they have always spent their free time. Somehow, someway, these <br/>
qualities stayed intact during their ps (and two years in Catholic <br/>
school) experience.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest reason I took them out of ps is because they were bored. <br/>
Now, they have the whole world at their fingertips all day long with <br/>
all of the resources we have around here --- computer, CD-ROMs, <br/>
library, video ... not to mention time to explore their creative<br/>
ideas <br/>
and thoughts on a daily basis!<br/>

and I get him to tell me what he needs to do to reach that goal.  Then I<br/>
look for materials that might help and get him to check them out.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.  He&#39;s taken every programming<br/>
class I&#39;ve found for him, and he loves Japanese (with a tutor).  He&#39;s crazy<br/>
about Odyssey of the Mind and the Stock Market Game (I classify those as<br/>
critical thinking and economics) but refused to participate on the<br/>
homeschool debate team.  Loves chemistry and physics, refuses to study<br/>
biology.  Reads voraciously, so I make sure there are plenty of books<br/>
available to him at home, and we visit the library a couple of times a week.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where he&#39;s going with this - his stated goal is to become a<br/>
game designer, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of games in progress.  Still,<br/>
he&#39;s learning, he&#39;s happy, he&#39;s alive (and there was a time I wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
he&#39;d see his 9th birthday).  I expect some college, somewhere, will be happy<br/>
to have him.<br/>

  &gt;Subject: Re: Checking in/checking out<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Hi all, Jacli here :) I&#39;ve been relatively quiet for quite a while. Going <br/>
  &gt;through too much physical turmoil to get embroiled on the stuff on the list <br/>
  &gt;too. But Helen&#39;s message struck me. I didn&#39;t appreciate her method but I <br/>
  &gt;understood her madness.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;The plain fact is that we seem to have cycles on this list. The good, the <br/>
  &gt;bad and oh yes, the ugly.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;We have moments when we shine. When we all come together to help one <br/>
  &gt;another question and answer our collective approaches to schooling, <br/>
  &gt;unschooling and parenting in general. These are the moments when we -each <br/>
  &gt;of us- contribute just a little something, a little bit of our own flavor <br/>
  &gt;and when taken in create a masterpiece.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Then we have moments when we get a little thoughtless or insensitive. <br/>
  &gt;Perhaps too sensitive is what I should say. Moments when for just a New <br/>
  &gt;York minute we let the bad in and become JUDGEMENTAL.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;That&#39;s okay. This list is full of moms, dads, teachers, leaders and since <br/>
  &gt;we&#39;re all human on this list, the occasional screw-ups. But we acknowledge, <br/>
  &gt;apologize and move on. And thank goodness for the occasional screw up. They <br/>
  &gt;remind us to think before we speak, to consider and reconsider the way we <br/>
  &gt;treat or mistreat others, such consideration is probably a big asset for a <br/>
  &gt;group of folks attempting to guide their young-ins and deschool themselves <br/>
  &gt;at the same time.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;The problem is when the Ugly sneaks it&#39;s ugly face in. Ahh, the moments <br/>
  &gt;when we tear down instead of buildup. Then we go back in and do it again. <br/>
  &gt;The long, long debates on whether so and so said what they said they said <br/>
  &gt;and so forth. Usually followed by people upset about all the people saying <br/>
  &gt;what was or was not said and then the comments about how people should go <br/>
  &gt;and say things somewhere else.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;This is not new for us. But it is shameful. Because when we are good, we <br/>
  &gt;are AWESOME! When we shine it is because, as a group we encourage, support <br/>
  &gt;and unite.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I do not care for the way Helen responded to the UGLY. But I do think it <br/>
  &gt;came from an emotional place of frustration and disappointment that it had <br/>
  &gt;come back again. And let&#39;s face it, when folks start telling other folks to <br/>
  &gt;get on other lists, UGLY has come back in a big way.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Shame on us. Do you know what I do when the ugly comes? When the first <br/>
  &gt;whiff of ugly has come I try to ignore it by becoming real friendly with my <br/>
  &gt;delete button. But at times like this, times when UGLY has come back all <br/>
  &gt;the way and brought friends, I leave. That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve been off this list <br/>
  &gt;several times and I&#39;m about to do it again. And that&#39;s okay too. Because <br/>
  &gt;the true feeling of this list is strong enough to survive even the ugly and <br/>
  &gt;the disappearance of one or two faces. Ugly is like a fire and if we all <br/>
  &gt;just stop feeding the flames IT WILL GO AWAY.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Sooner or later The Good will come back and when it does I and the others <br/>
  &gt;who have already quietly slipped away for a bit will come back. I just hope <br/>
  &gt;in the meantime that we haven&#39;t already permanently alienated some of the <br/>
  &gt;wonderful people on this list who maybe don&#39;t understand our ups and downs. <br/>
  &gt;The list will survive, but it could come back and bloom and thrive if only <br/>
  &gt;we would all work just a little harder to stop feeding the ugly and start <br/>
  &gt;working The Good.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Well, just my two cents, bye all, Jacli :)<br/>

  &gt; &gt;Subject: Checking in/checking out &gt; &gt;Dear friends and listmembers, &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt;It&#39;s a major disappointment to see this list fall back into the same <br/>
  &gt; &gt;kind of downward spiral we experienced a few weeks (or was it &gt;months?) <br/>
  &gt;ago. &gt;... It was truly discouraging to see the disparaging remarks &gt;about <br/>
  &gt;our magazine in the middle of this discussion ... &gt; To see our magazine <br/>
  &gt;called into question &gt;because of what someone who happens to write for us <br/>
  &gt;does on this list &gt;was probably the final straw for me. &gt;I&#39;ll be blunt. I <br/>
  &gt;do not have the time nor the interest in being &gt;involved with the kinds of <br/>
  &gt;dynamics I&#39;ve read here in the last few &gt;hours.... &gt; For that reason, I am <br/>
  &gt;removing all &gt;references to HEM from this list, turning this list over to <br/>
  &gt;the &gt;moderators, unsubscribing, and getting on with what needs doing in my <br/>
  &gt; &gt;life. I wish you all the best in finding appropriate resolutions. &gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-703244896">The answer to her question - Does homeschooling your children mean that you cannot also be a rocket scienctist?? Come - on now - we are all very good at multitasking :) and if you put off being a full fledged rocket scientist until your children are grown - think about how much you will have matured your skill by that time :)<br/>

  Evidently Marilyn vos Savant received numerous letters<br/>
  from happy <br/>
  homeschoolers, but sorry, folks, she&#39;s not convinced.<br/>
  She says we <br/>
  didn&#39;t answer the question she asked. Here&#39;s an<br/>
  excerpt from her <br/>
  latest response on Parade&#39;s website:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;...Many home-schoolers described how well their kids<br/>
  are doing and <br/>
  their high hopes for them, but almost no one addressed<br/>
  my concern <br/>
  that a large percentage of the kids would never use<br/>
  their educations <br/>
  if they became home-schoolers themselves. Gifted<br/>
  violinists would <br/>
  never be heard in a concert hall; great leaders would<br/>
  never be able <br/>
  to change society; brilliant scientists would never<br/>
  have a shot at <br/>

  Here&#39;s a question to ask yourself: Would you want to<br/>
  home-school your <br/>
  sons and then watch them become home-schooling parents<br/>
  themselves <br/>
  instead of having careers? This is a serious<br/>
  philosophical issue: If <br/>
  you stay at home and teach your child rocket science,<br/>
  and he stays at <br/>
  home and teaches his child rocket science, and he<br/>
  stays at home and <br/>
  teaches his child rocket science, when does anyone<br/>
  ever become a <br/>
  rocket scientist? In short, home-schooling is easy to<br/>
  recommend for <br/>

  Heres my responce to her question : Let me know what<br/>
  you guys think ..<br/>
  Marilyn,<br/>
  This is in responce to your homeschool  questions ...<br/>
  I have been homeschooling for 2 years now and I love<br/>
  it ... Someone once asked me what hopes i had for my<br/>
  daughter when  she grows up ...I hope for her to find<br/>
  and have faith in God ,to have a wonderful husband<br/>
  ,and a happy long life ,Then the question came about<br/>
  her career ,Or to homeschool her kids.  I hope that<br/>
  she does homeschool her children !!! I hope that i<br/>
  have installed  in her that children are the most<br/>
  important part of our lives ..That  a child  is a gift<br/>
  from God and that it is our job to raise that child<br/>
  and to take care of them  to teach them about God <br/>
  ...Not to push them off one someone else to raise ,or<br/>
  send them off for some one to teach them that man came<br/>
  from apes....It is our  &quot;career &quot;to raise our<br/>
  children. It is more rewarding then any paying JOB <br/>
  there is out there ...As far as my daughter  using her<br/>
  gifts or being a leader. We as homeschool parents do<br/>
  all that. We teach our children what we know, we share<br/>
  our gifts with them, we lead them in the direction<br/>
  they want to go. We do not force them to think one way<br/>
  or another. They are free to think on their own, not<br/>
  what someone else tells them that it is the way to<br/>
  think. That someone elses ideas are better then<br/>
  theirs.. We look and learn at all angles, not just one<br/>
  sided  views . To answer your question,  I would be<br/>
  very proud if my daughter or sons grows up to<br/>
  homeschool their children .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989347068">The flaw in Marilyn&#39;s argument is that she assumes that students are limited <br/>
to becoming that which their teachers are, in this instance, homeschooling <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
I am a homeschooling parent, and I am also a practicing attorney with a <br/>
flourishing practice in Palm Beach County, Florida.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that the public school system, irrespective of what <br/>
Marilyn and the politicians say, has crumbled.  Those parents who care enough <br/>
about their children&#39;s education to dedicate otherwise &quot;spare&quot; time to <br/>
accompany their children on a homeschooling adventure should be lauded.<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn also seems to place more value on rocket scientists than she does on <br/>
educators.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want my son or daughters to grow up to be homeschooling parents.  <br/>
Nor do I want them to be rocket scientists.  I want them to learn to love <br/>
learning, to grow into themselves, to examine their lives, to question <br/>
everything, to make their own ways, to be self-confident and self-reliant, <br/>
and to call me at least once a week (smile).  <br/>
<br/>
If my son wants to be a doctor, or if my daughter wants to be a writer, then <br/>
I will support them in that endeavour.  If they have children and are <br/>
concerned about the state of public (or private) (or standard) education at <br/>
that time, and they choose to teach their children at home, then I will be <br/>
excited for my grandchildren, that they will embark on the education of a <br/>
lifetime and will learn for learning&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn is wrong to assume that homeschoolers are not valuable to society, or <br/>
that homeschooling breeds only homeschoolers.  She is right to say, however, <br/>
that homeschooling is not necessarily a good idea for society at large.  No <br/>
matter how much we homeschoolers enjoy the journey, it is time-intensive and, <br/>
at times, exhausting.  Not every parent is eager to assist, coach, watch, or <br/>
take pleasure in the independent education of a child.  Society is fortunate, <br/>
however, that some parents are eager to do so.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think that Marilyn is right, but for the wrong reasons.  She has lost <br/>
sight of the fact that the goal of education is education.  It seeks only <br/>
itself.  She fails to understand that a rocket scientist can also be a <br/>
homeschooling parent.  And that a homeschooling parent, in and of itself, is <br/>
the most wonderful co-teacher any future rocket scientist could have.<br/>
<br/>
I do not intend to respond to Marilyn, though.  I am too busy watching my <br/>
children flourish and practicing law to worry about what the self-styled <br/>
&quot;smartest woman in the world&quot; has to say on a topic about which she knows <br/>
nothing.  Perhaps some of our older homeschooled students can craft responses <br/>
to her along the lines of:  &quot;I&#39;m a homeschooled student, and when I grow up I <br/>
want to be a homeschooling rocket scientist.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;because he thinks the question bugs me.  In fact, the question doesn&#39;t <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So then I&#39;m curious. What would be the problem with him having it everyday? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why does he need to throw a tantrum because you said no? (That was your <br/>
&gt; original post, I think.) If the question doesn&#39;t bother you, is it the <br/>
&gt; eating of ice cream for breakfast rather than desert that bothers you? The <br/>
&gt; eating of ice cream rather than the breakfast you&#39;ve already prepared? I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; not trying to start an argument BTW. I&#39;m really interested in your answers <br/>
&gt; and experiences. :o)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing would be the problem with him having ice cream everyday, except that <br/>
we don&#39;t have ice cream every day.  Moreover, even if we did have ice cream <br/>
every day, I don&#39;t, personally, think it would be prudent to &quot;allow&quot; him to <br/>
have it every day.  And I am comfortable with that decision.  (And I cannot <br/>
even imagine what a judge in a child custody situation would do with this <br/>
fact pattern.)  (No, wait, I can imagine what a judge would do, and I would <br/>
counsel a client to not give a child ice cream every day for breakfast, <br/>
unless a doctor said that same was necessary for health reasons.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, no, I never said that he threw a tantrum as a result of being <br/>
ice-cream-deprived.  And, no, that is not what this thread was about.  This <br/>
thread was about watching Ben beat Sue with a baseball bat, and advising Ben <br/>
that Sue might be bad, and might be shrewish, and might have deserved to have <br/>
been hit with a baseball bat, BUT . . . and that&#39;s where I saw a logical <br/>
break, &#39;cuz there wasn&#39;t nothin&#39; else to tell to Ben, or to correct Ben&#39;s <br/>
behaviour, or to protect Sue from another beating with the baseball bat.<br/>
<br/>
And, finally, no:  neither the question about ice cream nor the eating of ice <br/>
cream bothers me.  Ben beating Sue with a baseball bat.  THAT bothers me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I&#39;m not Olivia or a TCSer (too rigid, and at times absurd for <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;me),but that doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t found some value in thinking outside <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the box on some of my formerlly held parenting beliefs. :o)&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Yeah, me too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cool! :o) Then let&#39;s keep on with this part of the discussion.<br/>

My mom had a baby when I was in high school. I found out that I loved babyfood pears.<br/>
<br/>
I used to take a jar with me to school everyday, for a year. <br/>
<br/>
After a few funny looks and comments, a bunch of my friends started bringing jars of babyfood also, we each had our own fave,<br/>
<br/>
I was kinda bummed that my kids never liked babyfood(all those pears!), they wanted real food, if it didn&#39;t look like what we were eating, they wouldn&#39;t eat it.<br/>
<br/>
Although, they never fell for me eating the baby food out of the jar, they&#39;d just pull food off my plate.<br/>

times.  Not sure it was the babyfood or the being spoon fed.  I tried once with <br/>
each of them.  They clamped their mouths shut and that was that.  I would put <br/>
finger foods on their plates and they would pick at what they wanted.  That is <br/>
how our &quot;unfooding&quot; started.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044268564">Hello Chris - <br/>
<br/>
My son is a little younger than yours - and I took him out of school just over a year ago.  I was totally fed up as well. And like you, a working mother.  <br/>
<br/>
The first thing that the two of you will go through is breaking all the schooling habits - it was easier for my son than it has been for me!  I think they say that it takes at least a month for every year your child has spent in school to get over it.  Sure, there may be a long time that he sits in front of a TV seemingly not doing anything... various things like that.  But what I came to realize is that without the pressures of school, my son slowly grew back his fascination with everything.  He didn&#39;t have to squeeze his TV time in around all the demands of school - so, if he was interested in something, he could take the time to really explore it.<br/>
<br/>
I still have moments of panic, thinking that I&#39;m ruining his life... yes, he&#39;s there alone all day long while I work.  But we talk to each other at least a dozen times a day.  I really enjoy the calls that start &quot;Mom!  guess what I just heard???&quot; and I get a lecture on weather patterns... or game design... or... or... <br/>
<br/>
And our evenings and weekends are a blast!  No having to stop to do homework... long discussions about whatever interests either of us... doing research together on the net... creating something... being free to explore who we are and what we want to grow to be!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy - it&#39;s never too late...<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>

Hello everyone.  I&#39;m a new member but have been watching the list off and on for a couple weeks now.  I am a single mother of a 13 year old son who is finishing up seventh grade this year at public school.  We are both completely fed up with the public school system and want out.  I&#39;ve been doing some reading/researching on homeschooling, which is how I discovered the concept of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Chris</div>

<br/>
  I am completely intrigued by the idea and really wish that I had learned about it years ago when my son was still young.  I am concerned that it may be too late now for it to be of value to him.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Is it too late for you? Funny thing about unschooling, it involves the parents too, who are generally older than their children, and works changes into their lives. If I at 29 could embrace unschooling why on earth would it be too late for your son? It&#39;s never too late.<br/>
<br/>
  I am determined that this is going to be his last year in public school, but I&#39;m facing several challenges, not the least of which is that I have to work full time to support us.  I am desperately trying to find a way to make a living from home, which has always been my goal/dream anyway, but so far nothing viable has come to light.  Even if my son has to stay home by himself during the day, I still feel that he will be better off than he currently is in the school system.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Just wondering...Why have him finish the year?<br/>
<br/>
  From the posts I&#39;ve read thus far, it seems as though most of you either have younger children or started your children with homeschooling/unschooling at a young age.  Do any of you have any advice about starting with a young teenager and how to move from a schooling type of mentality to a self-learning mentality?  He is a very intelligent child, but he has absolutely no motivation to put it to use at this stage in his life.  Considering some of the things I&#39;ve been learning recently about the school system I can understand why, but I&#39;d like to help him overcome that.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess the other major question I have is, is it possible to make this work for him if I&#39;m not able to be home with him during the day?  As much as I desperately want to be, I have to pay the bills somehow, so there is a strong possibility that it just won&#39;t work out that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Maybe that would even be better than having you home! No trying to prod him to do something...and no one there to distract him from that growing feeling of boredom and impatience that will grow in him as he deschools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318428512">Hi Chris and welcome.<br/>
And good for you to have the courage to explore your options.<br/>
<br/>
Have you and your son read The Teenage Liberation Handbook?  Perhaps that may be helpful. <br/>
<br/>
Also - try to connect with other homeschoolers in your area.  People are usually very willing to help transport children to homeschooling events - especially the teen years where the population of homeschoolers seem to slim down a bit (at least in our area) and so are very interested in connecting.  Your son doesn&#39;t have to be home alone all day.  I know several single working parents who&#39;s children are taken with different families throughout the week for varying activities or just to be with folks.<br/>
