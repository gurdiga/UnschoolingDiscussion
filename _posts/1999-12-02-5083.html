<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557203442">From Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Want, by Barbara Sher<br/>
	&quot;Pioneer families and small farmers had to pool their labor to get their<br/>
barns built, their crops plowed and harvested, their corn husked.  In the<br/>
process, they reaffirmed the bonds of community---and had a whale of a<br/>
good time.  Working together toward vital common goals strengthened their<br/>
relationships as it lightened their labor.  There was no split in their<br/>
lives between love and work, self-interest and mutual aid.  In our<br/>
complex and technically advanced society, we no longer need each other&#39;s<br/>
direct and personal help to survive.  We&#39;re still dependent on other<br/>
people, but the cooperation that keeps us alive has become abstract and<br/>
impersonal.  We can buy houses built by strangers.  We can stand in line<br/>
at the supermarket to buy our food.  We can open the Yellow Pages and<br/>
hire a doctor or a plumber.  We exchange most goods and services for<br/>
money instead of love.  We&#39;ve gained the freedom to pursue our individual<br/>
goals--and that&#39;s a precious freedom--but we&#39;ve paid a high price: the<br/>
community of purpose that once fused work and relationship into a<br/>
meaningful whole.  Our most practical and satisfying way of getting<br/>
things done is still together.  And the proof is that so much of our<br/>
potential stays stubbornly locked inside us as long as we try to tap it<br/>
alone.<br/>

Snowflakes are on of nature&#39;s most fragile things,<br/>
but just look at what they can do<br/>
when they stick together.<br/>
