<div id="ygrps-yiv-299056073">I know it is frustrating to get alot of emails and not being able to <br/>
sort them easily.  I get a lot of emails for various projects and <br/>
have sorted them on yahoo.  (I love yahoo.)<br/>
<br/>
What I did to resolve this:  Go to the section for your group <br/>
settings and click on the part that says no emails.  Then once a day, <br/>
or once a week, or whenever, you can just to to the group as it is <br/>
saved in your section in yahoo called &quot;my groups.&quot;  I love this <br/>
feature because it lowers my incoming emails.  The downside is that <br/>
you might miss something. but these days, being so busy, it is good <br/>
for me to miss something.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I love Raymond.  Please tell us what happened!<br/>
