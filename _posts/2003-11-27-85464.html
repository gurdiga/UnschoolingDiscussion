&lt;&lt; Asking permission <br/>
becomes a way of gauging their own sense of right and wrong because they <br/>
know that I will explain a no and help them come up with better <br/>
alternatives. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like what Danielle wrote, and it&#39;s seeming to tie right in with the <br/>
principles/rules ideas.<br/>
<br/>
We announce when we&#39;re going to bed.  Keith doesn&#39;t usually, but we assume if <br/>
it&#39;s past 10:00 p.m. he&#39;s probably gone back in the back to sleep.  Even on <br/>
vacations he usually goes to bed early.  He stayed up until 1:00 to play Encore <br/>
with a big group a week and a half ago, and it was notable. <br/>
<br/>
If I say I&#39;m going to bed, it&#39;s kind of a last call for me to help people do <br/>
something.  If Holly says &quot;I&#39;m going to bed,&quot; and I&#39;m up, it means she wants <br/>
me to go with her and help her and tuck her in.   If Marty says &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
bed&quot; it means he relinquishes the computer, and he&#39;s no longer available to <br/>
other teen-boys as a gaming partner.  (Because of Kirby&#39;s schedule, he sometimes <br/>
is brought home by or brings home other gamers.)   If Kirby says &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
bed&quot; it might mean he&#39;s sick, because he&#39;s usually the last one down. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
But it deeply means &quot;nobody gets my computer or X-Box until tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have a policy/rule/tradition &lt;??&gt; here of people telling where they&#39;re <br/>
going and when they might be back.  We expect the kids to let us know where <br/>
they&#39;ll be, but it&#39;s easy for them to do, because we have always done that for <br/>
them.  We always leave them phone numbers where we can be reached, if I&#39;m going to <br/>
the movie with someone I tell them when theater I&#39;ll be in.  It just makes <br/>
them feel secure.  And so they have no qualms about telling us exactly where <br/>
they&#39;ll be, with whom, and giving us phone numbers.  It just seems natural.<br/>
<br/>
Keith left one day and didn&#39;t say where.  He was gone a LONG time, like three <br/>
hours.   I was shocked.  He hadn&#39;t even gone to a movie.  He had gone to buy <br/>
shoes, and he hates buying shoes.   So he was traumatized enough and I didn&#39;t <br/>
press him to do better next time &lt;g&gt;.   I think he knew if he had said he was <br/>
going to get shoes I would have offered to go and help, but I couldn&#39;t go that <br/>
day anyway.  And if he declared &quot;shoes&quot; and came back without shoes, he would <br/>
have failed.  So he just limped away (mentally limping) and came back with <br/>
two pairs of shoes, and some trauma to overcome.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem was a friend of his had called and wanted to come and get <br/>
something from Keith and I had said he should come over and wait, that I figured <br/>
Keith had just gone to Lowe&#39;s or Costco and so should be back any time.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s minor, but it&#39;s a good indication that it&#39;s deeply ingrained habit here.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the one way Kirby is irritating me since he has been able to <br/>
drive is that he doesn&#39;t leave enough and doesn&#39;t stay long as long as I expect <br/>
him to.  Last night he told me he would take his friends home, and this <br/>
morning they&#39;re still here.  I&#39;m sure they just played until it was too late and <br/>
one of them was asleep and it was past midnight and Kirby can&#39;t legally drive <br/>
after midnight, so they stayed.  A good decision, but I didn&#39;t expect it, and I <br/>
feel crowded.<br/>
<br/>
Not a big deal.  Kids are safe.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Kirby had four other teens when he got home.  We had made a <br/>
chicken casserole and saved Kirby one serving.  Ooops.   I had no easy plan of <br/>
action, but I had $20.  I quietly on the side told Kirby I&#39;d give him that $20 to <br/>
take them out for a cheap burger or pizza if he wanted, and he looked hurt!  He <br/>
said &quot;Do you not want us eating those pizzas and stuff?&quot; (meaning the kid <br/>
freezer-food Keith keeps stocked)<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I NEVER turned down money from my parents. <br/>
I NEVER turned down an offer to get out of there, or to eat elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
So I have $20 still, and Kirby&#39;s friends ate freezer-food (lean cuisine <br/>
chicken stuff or teriyaki chicken bowls or mini pizzas).  But they didn&#39;t GO HOME!  <br/>
LOL!<br/>
