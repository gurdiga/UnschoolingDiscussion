<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107693413">Everyones posts on their days felt like an invitation to share ours.  <br/>
Me and the kids went to gymnastics this morning.  I have to do it <br/>
with my 2 year old, which I usually dread because the concept of <br/>
taking turns does not click, for obvious reasons..LOL!  He was <br/>
actually great today.  We came home and went for bike rides and then <br/>
went out back in our kiddie pool and splashed and played with dad <br/>
where Keiran discovered he could make rainbows with the hose.  The <br/>
boys got haircuts courtesy of Dad and Mom!  Then me and Keiran (my 4 <br/>
1/2 yo) went for an archealogical dig in the sandbox.  We have <br/>
been &quot;studying&quot; Egypt.  He got interested after a discovery show.  I <br/>
found a great mummy kit so I hid the pieces in the sandbox.  He dug <br/>
them up and recorded them in his &quot;notebook&quot; and we weighed the pieces <br/>
just like real archealogists ;)  Then we came inside and made the <br/>
mummy (the kit even has organs that come out and are put in the <br/>
canopic jars, amulet stickers and a death mask..pretty cool).  We got <br/>
our Encyclopedia set in the mail, a good bargain as it was hard to <br/>
find something still in book format!!  We purused through those for a <br/>
while, although it was more hubby and I!!  Then the family went out <br/>
for dinner where we sat on the porch in a swinging bench seat with <br/>
the Florida breezes!!  Then we came home and dad and I shared reading <br/>
time.  The kids are now making an awful lot of noise in their room <br/>
when they should be sleeping..LOL.  We just put the baby in a bed so <br/>
he is enjoying all the freedom that his little toes are providing!! <br/>

a show on discovery when he was around 5 and we are still going strong!<br/>
It is amazing what this kids knows about egypt...it has also led us to<br/>
read and watch shows on the incas as well as get into egypt mythology<br/>
which led us to greek and roman mythology etc etc etc. Whenever we go to<br/>
the library he always requests to go to the egypt section. And check the<br/>
tv listings...there are TONS of shows on Egypt/mummies/pyramids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127599889">this is some of what our day looked like today.<br/>
<br/>
Me: got up at 5:30 (as usual...early riser) and checked emails and <br/>
discussion boards. Had a long chat with an online girlfriend. We were <br/>
the only ones in the room and got a chance to learn a little bit more <br/>
about each other. Got some laundry done. I&#39;ve posted baby pics on my <br/>
yahoo picture album, of my baby grandson to be found at the following <br/>
link <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/heidic40/">http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/heidic40/</a> click on baby aidan and <br/>
say &quot;awwww&quot; ;) When the kids got the puter away from me, they made <br/>
virtual homes with the punch!home design software and played <br/>
something online. <br/>
<br/>
played go fish with Katie, read a few chapters from &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, <br/>
Jeeves,&quot; explored a very lovely unschooling website <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hollow/1093/unschooling.html">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hollow/1093/unschooling.html</a> and <br/>
sent an email to Kathy Ward asking about her Christian journey in <br/>
unschooling, THEN found her essays about that journey and read those; <br/>
from that site, discovered some links about permaculture and <br/>
sustainable farming; printed up plans for a pizza box solar oven and <br/>
downloaded plans for a more substantial solar cooker; played war with <br/>
Katie while Robby played a computer game; watched the rain fall down. <br/>
Wished I&#39;d already got worms for the garden plot, and was thankful <br/>
that we spread leaves out there. This rain will be good for things.<br/>
<br/>
Thought of a possible story plot about intelligent chickens.<br/>
<br/>
Katie rode her bike between wet spells, and got caught out in a <br/>
deluge. Our spring is making up for a dry winter. She also snuck a <br/>
baby chicken in under her jacket and set him up in the main bathroom <br/>
tub. Twisty Toes. We may have to cull him since his feet are <br/>
deformed. Robby worked hard on his &quot;Top Secret&quot; kit which arrived in <br/>
the mail today: puzzles, clues, codes to find what was stolen, and <br/>
whodunnit, and where it was stashed after stolen. Japan is the <br/>
featured nation for this kit.<br/>
<br/>
We baked a couple dozen oatmeal cookies for tomorrow&#39;s fellowship <br/>
time at church, and I&#39;ll throw together a veggies n dip platter <br/>
tomorrow before we go. Abbie did a volunteer stint at a children&#39;s <br/>
library event, handing out free pencils and balloons and signing kids <br/>
up for read-aloud after school things, and then spent some time <br/>
chatting online about Elvish and other things Tolkien. She was <br/>
laughing, scoffing I say, at some poor sot who didn&#39;t know Sauron&#39;s <br/>
name before he started following the original bad guy...Malkor? L<br/>
<br/>
Drowsed in my chair until I heard Jim loading dishes into the <br/>
dishwasher...um...dirty dishes into a washer that had been run, that <br/>
is. Got up and we unloaded the diswasher and he put the dirties in. <br/>
Tucked the kids in. And posted this.<br/>
<br/>
g&#39;night<br/>
<br/>

Oh, wow. Just realized something: NO TV AT ALL TODAY. wow!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756831672">This was our day yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
Alisha and I got up and went to her early morning soccer game.  Then <br/>
we went yard saling and didn&#39;t get home until 3 pm.  I got Alisha <br/>
lots of books and clothes, a lot of videos the whole family will <br/>
enjoy, and  I got the boys a neat little tykes thing with <br/>
interlocking roads and train track.  <br/>
<br/>
While ALisha and I were gone, dh and the boys stayed home and played <br/>
Thomas most of the day.  <br/>
<br/>
When I got home I relaxed on the computer for a little while, watched <br/>
the boys put their new little tikes toy together, and ordered chinese <br/>
take out, which dh picked up.  He also drove Alisha to mcdonalds to <br/>
see if they had the latest brat doll and to the hallmark store to get <br/>
the american girl pins she earned.  <br/>
<br/>
While he was out I played t-ball in the yard with the boys.  When <br/>
they stopped needing me to play with them I pulled some weeds while I <br/>
watched.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I watched a movie together while Alisha played Zelda and the <br/>
boys played outside.  <br/>
<br/>
I packaged up some broken Thomas the tank engine stuff  to take <br/>
advantage of their lifetime guarantee and promised the boys we&#39;d take <br/>
it to the post office on Monday.  Alisha and I started reading Frank <br/>
Peretti&#39;s Cooper kids adventure books, which we got at the yard sales <br/>
today. <br/>
<br/>
I took a shower, brushed the boys&#39; teeth, and spent some time with <br/>
the boys.  Luke, the 3 year old, and I put a few more links on our <br/>
paper chain we&#39;ve been making and did a few pages in his Thomas the <br/>
tank engine magazine (which has a built in workbook which the boys <br/>
love!) .  Usually Matt (5) is upstairs with us when we do that but we <br/>
got a new game at the mall yesterday and he was downstairs playing <br/>
that with his sister.  <br/>
<br/>
When Matt came up we were done with the magazine.  He put his feet in <br/>
front of my nose and I dramatically coughed and gagged and said how <br/>
stinky they were.  Luke did the same to me, and then I started doing <br/>
it to them.  It turned into this weird game with all kinds of rules.  <br/>
If they said hi before I put my foot in front of their nose, I <br/>
couldn&#39;t stop them from putting their foot in front of my nose.  I <br/>
had to cough and gag and I couldn&#39;t put my foot in front of their <br/>
nose until I was done coughing and gagging.  They would run off of <br/>
Luke&#39;s bed and onto Matt&#39;s bed, which was their base where I couldn&#39;t <br/>
go.  Somehow we started counting how many stinky feet were on Luke&#39;s <br/>
bed.  I would brag, &quot;Ahhhh...only two stinky feet on the bed...and <br/>
then Matt would jump on and say, &quot;4 stinky feet&quot;!  Then Luke would <br/>
jump on and we&#39;d say, &quot;6 stinky feet!&quot;  Matt would escape me and be <br/>
laughing on his base and say, &quot;Huh-huh, now there&#39;s only 4 stinky <br/>
feet on the bed!&quot;  I bet no school has ever taught math exactly that <br/>
way before! lol   <br/>
<br/>
I read the boys a Sesame Street book, sang them each a song and <br/>
tucked them in.  Then I sang to Alisha and tucked her in.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
long after I went to bed that the boys were in my bed with me.  They <br/>
looked at books in bed with me for awhile before they fell asleep.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305996173">Thanks for the warning..LOL!  Although he is interested n Egypt, it <br/>
has not been able to compete with the Harry Potter craze which has <br/>
consumed my house.  Both my boys, including our just turning 2 yo, <br/>
beleive they are wizards!  My little one tends to point and shoot <br/>
anything that resembles a wand at you.  I think half his frustrations <br/>
come from beleiving it will really make me stop what I am doing!!  <br/>
Imagine the disapointment after seeing it work on the games and <br/>
movies, but not working for him LOL!!  Poor kid!  For some odd <br/>
reason, Keiran (4yo) has decided he would like to learn more about <br/>
pirates???  IF you or anyone have any good suggestions there, let me <br/>
know!<br/>

Oh!  Ethan does this, too!  (He&#39;ll be 3 on the 30th.)  His favorites are the <br/>
butter knives (ack!) and sticks from the yard.  He points them at us and <br/>
says (I hope I can get this phonetically!) &quot;psheeroh psheeroh&quot;!  LOL  Very <br/>
Star Wars sounding, though he&#39;s never seen the movies.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, he found a bent stick that very much resembled a gun and the <br/>
noise it made had a Zsa-Zsa sound....zseeromp zseeromp zsrah zsrah.  Where <br/>
do they come up with that stuff??? &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946523242">I remember reading an article in Home-Ed Mag.  a couple of years ago <br/>
about fun pirate stuff, like making treasure maps and going on <br/>
treasure hunts, and good books and movies like Peter Pan and Hook. <br/>
That sounds like a lot of fun.  Good luck!<br/>
