<br/>
Yep---as if I didn&#39;t have enough to do! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve been reading up on fencing. Unfortunately all the library <br/>
books are ANCIENT!---nothing since 1975. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I ran across this passage and thought I&#39;d share:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is up to you to make of the sport what you want. The achievements <br/>
will be yours. This is true of anything you study. The teacher can&#39;t <br/>
give it to you, like pouring milk into a pitcher that just sits there. <br/>
You must take it. You must look at it from several angles, think about <br/>
it, tear it apart and put it back together, try, make mistakes, correct <br/>
yourself, practice, ask questions, try again. The teacher can show you, <br/>
point out where you went wrong, suggest what you can do to improve.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Happily, there is no time limit and no grading. Stick with it and you <br/>
soon will become proficient. You will know that you have made <br/>
progress---not in comparison to anybody else, but from your own <br/>
personal starting place, according to your own characteristics, and <br/>
toward your own goals, or for your own purposes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The book is _Complete Fencing_ by Albert Manley.<br/>

How fun for you and Duncan!  My daughter, Zoe (7) has been taking <br/>
fencing<br/>
since last January.  Here&#39;s a photo of her (she&#39;s the one on the right)<br/>

<br/>
Her interest in medieval warfare is what got her started and fotunately <br/>
the<br/>
coaches are good at making footwork and skills practice fun most of the <br/>
time.  It is one of<br/>
the least expensive activities she&#39;s been involved in.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Nice photo---she&#39;s using a French handle? Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s interest came from Japanese warfare---anime and manga.<br/>
<br/>
I have been interested since high school and college. It was offered in <br/>
college, but I never got around to it. Too busy at the stable, I guess!<br/>
<br/>
This seems like a great excuse! &lt;G&gt; I just have to decide between foil <br/>
and epee. By tomorrow night. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
