<br/>
&gt; There are calls to &quot;move on&quot; but to what? Will they tell us? My own grief<br/>
&gt; for my kids damaged by school has made me devote myself to helping others<br/>
&gt; escape that same damage. Yes, my kids were hurt twenty years ago, but the<br/>
&gt; schools are just as terrible today, if not worse, so how are we supposed to<br/>
&gt; &quot;move on&quot;? Some people here seem terrified by the schools they have just<br/>
&gt; escaped. Are they supposed to simply &quot;move on&quot;? How do you mean that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The moderator(s) have been incredibly clear, concise and specific on this<br/>
subject. They&#39;ve already said (more than once, more than twice) that posters<br/>
who are coping with just having taken their children out of a bad situation<br/>
in a school are of course going to talk about that bad situation (and<br/>
should) in their process of heading toward healing, and in their process of<br/>
beginning unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There is a big (huge, galactic) difference between Jane Doe showing up on<br/>
the list with school tales of horror just done to her 10 year old twins and<br/>
how she&#39;s so glad to find unschooling and can we please help... versus what<br/>
seems to be your never-ending posts that either attempt to derail<br/>
non-school-bashing discussions to school-bashing discussions or complain<br/>
that you can&#39;t understand simple list parameters, simply stated, repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, others here have given it as their opinion that you must know that<br/>
you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing. But I&#39;ve seen people who can write pretty<br/>
well who are so caught up with their own voices that they truly do NOT hear<br/>
anyone else (similar to the way a pet Basset Hound will pick up a ground<br/>
scent and will not HEAR his owners calling him away from the busy road --<br/>
not a matter of ignoring, just a matter of physical limitation and strong<br/>
tracking drive).<br/>
<br/>
So, if you really don&#39;t understand but are sincere in wanting to, I suggest<br/>
you email one of the moderators privately and try to get it worked out.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, you are doing what others have said, intentionally<br/>
derailing conversations, then please stop it.<br/>
