<div id="ygrps-yiv-382190941">Hi,<br/>
 I guess I&#39;m in the minority, but I don&#39;t see the insult in fondly calling a <br/>
child Lazybones.  I could understand if he was constantly told in a harsh <br/>
tone to move his lazy butt, or get his lazy no good butt off the couch, but <br/>
Lazybones as a nickname just doesn&#39;t sound hurtful.  I&#39;m guessing the child <br/>
is aware that he&#39;s growing up in loving surroundings.  I also realize that <br/>
some kids have lousy childhoods, and that colors who they are and how they <br/>
view things.<br/>
 Since I don&#39;t know anyone here personally, this is just my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536831351">I think it just depends on the context and the tone.  I probably <br/>
wouldn&#39;t use the term lazybones because I would be afraid that the <br/>
child might somehow think that there&#39;s some truth to it. However, <br/>
I&#39;ve heard kids called all kinds of things, like stinker and stinky <br/>
and peanut and pickle.  No one who calls their kids stinker are <br/>
really saying that they&#39;re literally stinky.  So much depends on <br/>
individual family situations. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to admit that I call Eric Stinky. Because of his Cystic Fibrosis (he <br/>
doesn&#39;t fully digest fat), he can clear a room with his farts. As with many <br/>
in his age range, he is quite proud of this ability. Thus the name Stinky. <br/>
<br/>
With the recent posts I asked if the name bothered him at all. His response, <br/>
&quot;I do stink; I have great farts.&quot; He just asks that I not scream it to him in <br/>
a public place (I don&#39;t). I told him to let me know if it ever starts to <br/>
bother him. &quot;No problem, Mom.&quot;<br/>
