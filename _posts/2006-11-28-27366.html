<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790326821">Hello. I think that Cosleeping has been addressed on this group <br/>
before so I am bringing a question that has me troubled. I/we co-<br/>
sleep w/ our three and 1/2 yr old son and almost 2 yr old daughter <br/>
and we are all happy with this practice. My daughter still nurses on <br/>
and off all night (only nurses at bedtime and during night as I have <br/>
weaned her off daytime nursing). Well... My Mother In Law this <br/>
morning on the phone when I was discussing a totally different <br/>
problem in my life with her, said she had some advice for me that <br/>
she knew wasn&#39;t her business but that she just felt compelled to <br/>
talk to me about anyway. Then she launched into how she thought <br/>
I &quot;just need to get the kids out of our bed&quot; and how &quot;it&#39;s not good <br/>
for the kids nor for your marriage&quot; and how &quot;kids should see that <br/>
their parents are a separate unit from themselves and that they <br/>
don&#39;t need to see themselves as part of the marrital unit&quot; (or <br/>
something like that?) and how &quot;sleeping with them is more for YOU <br/>
than it is for THEM&quot; and how they&#39;re never going to grow into self <br/>
reliant individuals if I keep them in our bed etc etc etc, yatta <br/>
yatta yatta... As usual, my blood pressure went right up and I just <br/>
kept stammering &quot;I&#39;ll give it some thought&quot; etc etc. I never know <br/>
what to say to her when she goes off like that. As you can imagine, <br/>
she is also against homeschooling as well, but that is another <br/>
issue. What do you all say to the naysayers in your lives re: <br/>
cosleeping or attachement parenting or whatnot. I&#39;ve asked the same <br/>
sort of question before when she lambbasted me about homeschooling <br/>
being a bad idea... Maybe I should just talking with her? Hard for <br/>
me though &#39;cause she&#39;s been more of a mother to me for my whole <br/>
marriage (15yrs) than my own Mom, who I was astranged for like 8yrs. <br/>
(yet ANOTHER story). Advice please!</div>

<br/>
I would get a copy of The Family Bed or some other better book if  <br/>
there is one by now, and give it to her.  Tell her nicely that after  <br/>
she&#39;s read that,  you&#39;ll be willing to discuss it if she still wants  <br/>
to.  Smile.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t back down.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not your mother.  Why isn&#39;t your husband dealing with her?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384830966">We Cosleep as well my kids our 9yr dd & 3yrs son  although my <br/>
daughter has her own room she rather be with us and its fine she is <br/>
growing up so fast i&#39;ll enjoy it while it lasts. My 3yr old stop <br/>
nurising about 6mm ago and I miss it. But sorry for the rant. My 9yr <br/>
is very independent and happy she feels safe in our bed we respect <br/>
that right now this is what she needs and when shes ready she&#39;ll go <br/>
to her own bed. Nursing my kids created an amazing bond with them & <br/>
sometimes people who haven&#39;t experienced that don&#39;t understand. You <br/>
don&#39;t have to justify to anyone why you do or don&#39;t do things if you <br/>
know what works for your family thats what counts. I stop trying to <br/>
explain to naysayers our relationship with our kids speaks volumes <br/>
and it shows as they get older. <br/>
<br/>
So not sure if this helped but I really know how fustrating and how <br/>
people close to you can make you second guess your choices what has <br/>
helped me is focusing on what makes my kids happy because in the end <br/>
thats what matters to me.<br/>

has been working on cosleeping from before I heard him speak at the American <br/>

there that directly address the problems your MIL seems to be predicting are <br/>
more likely to occur in a cosleeping household. In an exerpt from Our Babies <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve posted before about your MIL&#39;s critical stance on your parenting <br/>
choices. I don&#39;t know if putting together a bunch of resources demonstrating <br/>
that your choices aren&#39;t made in a vacuum, in the absence of research and <br/>
careful thought, will be enough to sway her to believe that you are wise <br/>
enough to make your own decisions. For whatever reason in your life and your <br/>
relationship with your mother-in-law she has decided, it seems to me, that <br/>
you aren&#39;t quite capable enough to operate without her advice or lead. And <br/>
maybe before you can expect her to respect you that is something you need to <br/>
address.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand is your mother-in-law, who is an important person to you, as <br/>
you&#39;ve stated, and on the other hand are your children. They shouldn&#39;t lose <br/>
out on because you are afraid of this woman&#39;s opinion. And whatever you do, <br/>
you need to keep them present in your mind in the face of whatever onslaught <br/>
yur MIL produces. Really.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370532541">Thanks again everyone for your words of advice. I do tend to let her <br/>
comments effect me more than I should. I don&#39;t know if it is her <br/>
lack of belief in my abilitys or if it has more to do with her need <br/>
to &#39;control&#39;. I guess both my husband and his brother (the only kids <br/>
from the family) both agree that she really likes to be in control <br/>
of all things as much as she can or is allowed that position. They <br/>
are both good, after more than 30yrs practice, of just ignoring her <br/>
ideas when they don&#39;t want to practice what she preaches and that is <br/>
a good deal of the time. I guess I just need to take their lead and <br/>
let it roll off... I will work on it. I am not going to change my <br/>
sleeping arraigements. I will read the links ya&#39;ll told me about on <br/>
co-sleeping and send them to her. If she won&#39;t read them, I guess <br/>
that will tell me a lot. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753580107">Just chiming in with my 2 cents. We let the kids sleep with us early <br/>
on, but then basically forced them into their own beds. We weren&#39;t <br/>
very enlightened back then *sheepish grin*. However, I am now <br/>
divorced (8 yrs) with two teens (dd15, ds17) who live primarily with <br/>
their dad. My daughter sleeps with me instead of in her own room, and <br/>
I joyfully allow it. I rub her back until we are both asleep, and <br/>
while I do enjoy sprawling out all over my queen bed, I love that she <br/>
wants to be this close to me right now. <br/>
<br/>
We are just beginning the unschooling experience, and are fighting <br/>
her dad all the way. Even if he were to agree to &#39;homeschooling&#39; he <br/>
wants to bring school to home and make her conform. Sheesh! Not gonna <br/>
happen, lol. BTW, my ds17 is still in ps, graduating in May. He&#39;s not <br/>
interested in leaving, so I&#39;m not arguing the point. He wants to get <br/>
into college to study computer science next fall. He&#39;s decided he&#39;s <br/>
going to have to pay for his own college, because his father makes <br/>
too much money (and is fussing about it all, but that is another <br/>
story for another time, eh?). <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, but decided to come out of the <br/>
woodwork to join the group. Thanks for having me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425343284">Hello again all,<br/>
   I just wanted to thank everyone for their comments and support and to tell you I wrote my MIL an e-mail telling her that, while I appriciate her concern and realize that she likely just voiced it because she wants what is best for us and our kids, that we are going to continue to co-sleep as long as it is working for us and that right now, it&#39;s working. I also sent her some of the great Links I got from you all! I don&#39;t know how she&#39;ll &#39;take it&#39; but I have decided that it&#39;s time to grow a backbone and call her on what feel like &#39;potshots&#39; to my parenting style and choices. As many of you have said, these are my kids and I need to raise them in the way&#39;s I believe, that she has &#39;had her chance&#39; with raising kids. I am very happy to have found this group so it can help soothe my fears when I hear such things and get a bit &#39;uneasy&#39;. Have a lovely day everyone!<br/>
Smiles,<br/>

   Thanks! I&#39;d not heard that one before and it&#39;s perfectly put! I think I&#39;ll write it out and post it on my &#39;fridge! ;) <br/>
   <br/>
  B/t/w I got an e-mail back from my MIL and she said &quot;I Give!&quot; and went on to say that she knows that Josh and I are terrific parents (among other things) and signed it &quot;Reformed Meddling MIL&quot;. So she took it pretty well and I don&#39;t think I did any &#39;damage&#39; by asserting my opinion. Which is good, &#39;cause I know my kids need their Grandma and I don&#39;t want to make bad blood. However, I am not going to continue to allow her to make me feel bad about my parenting decisions! Thanks to so many of you for showing me how I was being a bit &#39;weak&#39; in this area. I am working on correction and growth in that area! (I think more and more lately that people [who aren&#39;t in school itself] are all Unschoolers, just in different &#39;stages&#39;! LOL! If that makes sense... Lord knows I&#39;ve been Unschooling myself on the subject of Homeschool/Unschooling lately, can&#39;t seem to read enough on it! ha!)<br/>
  Have a lovely day!<br/>
  <br/>

Cool!!<br/>
And that will make it easier next time.<br/>
<br/>
With my mother in law, it was our decision not to circumcise Kirby.   <br/>
She had been nurse, and said &quot;You have to get him circumcized,&quot; after  <br/>
I offered to let her change and dress him, which I thought would be a  <br/>
nice thing for her, as a grandma, to get to deal with him that way  <br/>
when he was just a few days old.<br/>
<br/>
I said we had read a lot before making the decision, and I could let  <br/>
her read what we had read.  She said &quot;Well I&#39;ll read it, but it won&#39;t  <br/>
change my mind.&quot;   She took the stuff (four books with sticky-notes  <br/>
on the right pages, I think) and when she brought them back the next  <br/>
day she set them gently on a table and said  &quot;Things have changed a  <br/>
lot since I was in nursing school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we didn&#39;t send Kirby to school, she balked and I said &quot;I could  <br/>
give you some of the books we read...&quot; and she said &quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So she knew by the first simpler situation that I really HAD done  <br/>
research, and after a while all I had to do was threaten to make her  <br/>
read. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, gradually, they came to really appreciate the way we are  <br/>
and the way the kids are.<br/>
