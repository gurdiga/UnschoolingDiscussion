<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now that I think about it, we (my kids and I), watch the ads with more <br/>
concentration than the shows.  We are always commenting on the quality <br/>
of an ad, or my daughter might say, &quot;I don&#39;t get that one&quot;, so I&#39;ll <br/>
explain why I thought it was funny.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;ve always loved ads more than most shows.  I often find them to <br/>
be very creative.  Or sometimes I find it interesting to try to <br/>
remember the original ad that the new one is a take-off from.<br/>
