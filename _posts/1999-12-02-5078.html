<div id="ygrps-yiv-731823160">A passage from the article:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The US is not the earthly paradise. It is a society that, through common<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sense and fairness has indeed offered boundless opportunity for tens of<br/>
millions of immigrants from all over the world. Americans are perhaps freer<br/>
from what an American writer called &quot;the hidden injuries of class&quot;. But that<br/>
does not mean there is no class inequality and no class consciousness.&lt;&lt;<br/>
