<br/>
the last time I really remember wetting the bed ... I was in 7th grade.  My<br/>
cousin was spending the night and then we had to crawl into my sister&#39;s twin<br/>
bed for the night.  I would have LOVED to not wet the bed.  If Jackie had<br/>
not been spending the night, I would have woken up cold, sometime in the<br/>
middle of the night, so I still would have slept through.   I don&#39;t ever<br/>
remember my mom making a big deal about it.  My dad, once, got really mad at<br/>
me.  He was yelling at me, asking how i could sleep through it ... I think<br/>
he was embarrassed as the bed I peed was his sister&#39;s while were just 4<br/>
houses over visiting them.  I honestly had not known that I had wet the bed<br/>
and found out when they came to get me to take me home.<br/>
<br/>
In 7th grade, I was already 5&#39;9&quot;.  I don&#39;t think they had big diapers back<br/>
then and I would NOT have wanted to wear them.  I don&#39;t really think I wet<br/>
all that often, though I really do not remember, except for Girl Scout camp,<br/>
but that is a totally different story and that was 4th grade! LOL<br/>

&gt; I think sleeping is really important and if they can sleep wet they<br/>

I wasn&#39;t thinking about the electrical field ... and I do agree with that!<br/>
I remember when we had a water bed, we never turned on the heater!  Just had<br/>
a couple of thick blankets underneath our sheets. Besides, even with the<br/>
heater on low, I would  sweat and feel like I was sticking to the mattress<br/>
with only a thin pad under the sheets. Gross!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Why should they have to were diapers for how ever long they wet the bed<br/>
&gt; 10-14 years, if a little jiggly thing is going to re-establish their<br/>
ability to<br/>
&gt; wake at night? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Marty never had an &quot;ability to wake at night,&quot; so it couldn&#39;t have been<br/>
&gt; re-established.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are good arguments against sleeping in electrical fields (like under<br/>
&gt; electric blankets, too close to all-night appliances like clock radios)<br/>
and it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem healthier or safer to me, but if someone&#39;s priorities are<br/>
&gt; different, then that &quot;alarm&quot; might be the lesser of some uncounted number<br/>
of evils.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just wanted my kids to be able to sleep as long as they wanted to, after<br/>
&gt; they had gone to bed sleepy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And now that Marty never has any troubles (hasn&#39;t for years), it seems in<br/>
&gt; retrospect that the least intrusive/invasive/pressuring solution worked<br/>
out fine.<br/>

not sure) she started becoming very frustrated with her bedwetting (it <br/>
was EVERY night and sometimes more than once in the night)  - and we <br/>
talked about the alarm (it was clear she was an extremely deep sleeper <br/>
- still is). She decided she wanted to try the alarm underpants and so <br/>
I got them for her. We played with it a bit during the day - <br/>
experimented with how much moisture it took to set it off, etc. She <br/>
wore them that night. The alarm never went off because she didn&#39;t WET <br/>
herself. Ever again. She wore the special underpants for about 3 nights <br/>
and then that was it. No more bedwetting.<br/>

  When my oldest was about 9 years old (she might have even been 10, I&#39;m <br/>
  not sure) she started becoming very frustrated with her bedwetting (it <br/>
  was EVERY night and sometimes more than once in the night)  - and we <br/>
  talked about the alarm (it was clear she was an extremely deep sleeper <br/>
  - still is). She decided she wanted to try the alarm underpants and so <br/>
  I got them for her. We played with it a bit during the day - <br/>
  experimented with how much moisture it took to set it off, etc. She <br/>
  wore them that night. The alarm never went off because she didn&#39;t WET <br/>
  herself. Ever again. She wore the special underpants for about 3 nights <br/>
  and then that was it. No more bedwetting.<br/>

You just put it in the front pocket of guys underwear or girls who wont wear guys can were two pairs of girls undies.  You don&#39;t have to wait for it to go through the laundry it in-between so it&#39;s good for more then one wetting a night.  I like the idea with this kind as they don&#39;t alert the whole house and it is somewhat discreet.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was young my mom bought a big mat version that went under your sheet and then literally &quot;SCARED THE LIVING PISS OUT OF YOU IT WAS SO LOUD&quot;  woke me up did the trick of making my brain wake me up when my bladder was full.  The problem was it scared me so badly I would literally be unable to sleep for hours if it was on the bed and then when I did wake to use to bathroom I&#39;d jump bolt upright in bed and run scared that the thing might go off.  I still kept my sleeping through anything ability fire alarms, neibors knocking on my door because of fire, land lord using master key and coming into my room to wake me up, slept in landlords car while firemen threw smoking mattress out of top floor apartment desmoked the building and then with sirens blaring when to another fire.  Then I had kids and wake much more easily.  Anyway the humiliation of wetting the bed was far more severe then that *@%*@ alarm.<br/>

less and less.<br/>

magazines and on tv about helping children stop<br/>
wetting the bed and gave them our name.<br/>

during the night!<br/>

to do something she wants to do it NOW. Asking her to just be patient <br/>
and reassuring her that she&#39;ll stop eventually --  it simply wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to satisfy this kid at that time. No way. At that time she was <br/>
wanting to do overnighters with friends - frequently. At home we had <br/>
plastic under the sheets and we were used to washing bedding - <br/>
sometimes changing it in the middle of the night and then changing it <br/>
AGAIN a few hours later. But overnighters were a problem. It was common <br/>
for all the kids in our homeschool group to stay at each other&#39;s houses <br/>
a lot - we lived long distances from each other - 30 to 40 miles - and <br/>
so overnight &quot;play dates&quot; were the norm. This was her motivation. Just <br/>
to be clear, I am NOT recommending this - just describing our rather <br/>
unusual experience with it. Apparently, though, kids often do not pee a <br/>
big flood right off during the night, but tend to leak a little (still <br/>
holding it in) before they finally let it all go. That is why the <br/>
alarms work - they wake the kid up when a tiny bit of moisture hits <br/>
them, before the big flood starts.<br/>

<br/>
But you did say that she is the one that asked for the alarm thing too. I<br/>
think that makes a big difference from a parent saying here, we need to try<br/>
this to get you to stop. She wanted it and obvioulsy was ready because it<br/>
never even really had to work.<br/>
<br/>
Reminds me of Sierra and her sucking her thumb at night. She was the one<br/>
that asked for the liquid stuff you use when I talked to her about solutions<br/>
if any. I think she used it a couple of nights just in case and stopped<br/>
pretty much, as far as I know, right then.<br/>

<br/>
I think that there is a definite physical correlation but as time passes if your accustomed to wetting the bed I think your mental queuing is affected.  Most children develop a mental queuing as they potty train and if they are physically not ready for night queuing to develop they pass over that and the little alarm that goes off in many children&#39;s heads while they sleep&quot;Oh I have to pee gotta get up.&quot; is sighlenced.  It can take a strong focus or something traumatic to induce the alarm to work.  Also with very heavy sleepers or children with say a milk allergy it can continue well after they are physically able to do the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that make sense the kids are rowdy tonight :-P<br/>

there&#39;s some kind of alarm going to go off can possibly make them sleep <br/>
more lightly. They might still not be producing enough of the hormone that <br/>
slows urine production at night, but if they&#39;re sleeping a little more <br/>
lightly they just might wake up when the bladder gets full. I wish I&#39;d had <br/>
one when I was a child. They didn&#39;t have them then, and when my boys could <br/>
have used them, we couldn&#39;t afford them. Plus I was skeptical because I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331236251">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What&#39;s the kid supposed to do?  Wake up mid-stream and try to make it to the <br/>
bathroom?  If not, what?  <br/>
<br/>
I think sleeping is really important and if they can sleep wet they should.<br/>
And if a parent could afford some kind of electric alarm system, they could <br/>
have afforded diapers.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was part of my thinking too but then I was thinking and reading some.  Why should they have to were diapers for how ever long they wet the bed 10-14 years, if a little jiggly thing is going to re-establish their ability to wake at night?<br/>

&gt; I think it&#39;s some of both. If the child is a deep<br/>
&gt; sleeper, knowing that <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s some kind of alarm going to go off can<br/>
&gt; possibly make them sleep <br/>
&gt; more lightly. <br/>

about when it might go off, too, which could make for<br/>

flowing, maybe it would stop on its own without.  But<br/>
some kids (and parents) don&#39;t want to wait that long.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-550874264">With that experience you just mentioned, what does that really<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;say about thinking that bedwetting is physical? Isn&#39;t that what most<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;do believe, that the child hasn&#39;t matured enough in that way to wait?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For a different perspective on that idea and the concept of toilet training<br/>
in general, you might be interested to check out my website<br/>
www.natural-wisdom.com where i talk about raising babies without relying on<br/>
diapers. Babies are clearly able to control their sphincters long before<br/>
what is commonly believed.<br/>
<br/>
My belief, based on my experience of raising a conventionally diapered child<br/>
who night-wet for many years and 2 diaper-free children who were<br/>
consistantly dry at night within the first 8-14 months, as well as talking<br/>
to hundeds of moms about this issue, is that conventionally diapered<br/>
children are actually trained to ignore their body signals and that toilet<br/>
training is a re-training to try to refind that awareness. Kind of like<br/>
having to unlearn your programming after quitting school to regain your<br/>
natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
And once that&#39;s happened (ie. the diaper training or the school-programming)<br/>
it takes a lot of patience and time to undo and can&#39;t be forced. But, like<br/>
schooling, long-term diapering and toilet training can happily be avoided<br/>
altogether!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
One thing i&#39;ve discovered in my research that long-time night-wetters might<br/>
find helpful, is the very clear link between food allergies/sensitivities<br/>
and night-time wetting. By far the most common culprit seems to be dairy.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard literally dozens of stories from moms whose children stopped<br/>
night-wetting totally when all dairy was removed from the diet. Some<br/>
children were so sensitive and predictable that as soon as any tiny bit of<br/>
dairy entered their system (like a breastfeeding mom drinking tea with milk,<br/>
or casein in a food product) they wet the bed again. I&#39;m sure that info<br/>
would apply to older children too and i wish i&#39;d have known it with my first<br/>
who really struggled with this and, as we now know, had food allergies.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, citrus before bed and diuretic foods like watermelon can also<br/>
cause night-wetting but dairy is by far the most common.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that&#39;s helpful to someone.<br/>

herself.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are responding assuming the parent wants the alarm for the<br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
So what someoene means by the words they write is going to depend on which<br/>
assumption they made.<br/>
<br/>
If the child wants one, why not?<br/>
<br/>
If the child is wetting at night, the parent should let them know what<br/>
options are available so they can try various things out until they find<br/>
something what works for them.<br/>

<br/>
Marty never had an &quot;ability to wake at night,&quot; so it couldn&#39;t have been <br/>
re-established.<br/>
<br/>
There are good arguments against sleeping in electrical fields (like under <br/>
electric blankets, too close to all-night appliances like clock radios) and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem healthier or safer to me, but if someone&#39;s priorities are <br/>
different, then that &quot;alarm&quot; might be the lesser of some uncounted number of evils.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted my kids to be able to sleep as long as they wanted to, after <br/>
they had gone to bed sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
And now that Marty never has any troubles (hasn&#39;t for years), it seems in <br/>
retrospect that the least intrusive/invasive/pressuring solution worked out fine.<br/>

&gt;In 7th grade, I was already 5&#39;9&quot;.  I don&#39;t think they had big diapers back<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t in 7th grade when I stopped, but I was almost 12. I was still <br/>
wetting *every* night and hated it. I didn&#39;t get to go to Girl Scout camp <br/>
because of it. I went through puberty still wetting. In fact, I woke up one <br/>
morning, and my usual wet bed was red. Yuck! I hated it, would have done <br/>
anything in my power to stop, but it seems puberty stopped it for me. It <br/>
was just a month or two later.<br/>
