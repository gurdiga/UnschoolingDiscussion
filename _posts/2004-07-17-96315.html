What is the significance of this?  I&#39;ve seen this in our neighborhood, and others nearby, and had no idea it meant anything.  The boys just thought it funny -- I figured it was some kind of jr. high prank.  <br/>

It could be copycat stuff like that where you live. In certain neighborhoods<br/>
in Los Angeles it means drugs for sale, usually a crackhouse or pot.<br/>
