<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your sister.  My brother died a year and a half <br/>
ago.  (I didn&#39;t find your post snotty at all, btw. &lt;g&gt;)  When Hillary was <br/>
born, she weighed 8 pounds 4 ounces.  She looked perfect in every way, <br/>
although she had lost deep layers of skin and lacked muscle and cartilage <br/>
tone due to the fact that she passed away a week before birth, so her head <br/>
was very relaxed and would sort of flatten out in my hands when I held her.  <br/>
We had an extensive autopsy performed and genetic testing which revealed no <br/>
answers as to the reason of why she died.  (I now wish I hadn&#39;t chosen to do <br/>
those things.)  I realize that it is a different kind of not knowing, but <br/>
that has plagued me for the past 10 years.  Losing my brother also had a <br/>
tremendous affect on my life, very similar to losing Hillary.  Losing him <br/>
greatly changed my views in dealing with loved ones.  My mother and husband <br/>
in particular. (Long derailing story there.)  However, there are different <br/>
things I took away from each situation.  Losing Michael changed my views in <br/>
how I see people in general, young and old.  Losing Hillary had deeper <br/>
effects regarding my living children.  Mostly through the little, everyday <br/>
things that are so easily taken for granted and/or cause annoyance.  For <br/>
some reason, my words are locking up on me and I can&#39;t express what I am <br/>
trying to say here.  I, too, am not trying to be snotty. :)  I don&#39;t feel as <br/>
if either is any more profound or moving, I just feel as though there is a <br/>
difference, yet I am unable to express it in clear words.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right but what I am saying is that those profound different events <br/>
can lead 2 people to the same conclusion. Effecting everything about <br/>
me and how I treat others.<br/>
Every time I am out I look for her, even though my concious mind <br/>
knows she won&#39;t be there. I don&#39;t know she is dead but pretty sure of <br/>
it {if anyone knows the history of the Hell&#39;s Angels you&#39;ll get my <br/>
drift}.<br/>
In effect our situations are the same. I think I look upon her when I <br/>
look in my daughters&#39; eyes because part of the reason she ended up <br/>
the way she did IMHO was because of being passed around like she was <br/>
damaged goods when she was young. So it had an HUGE impact on how I <br/>
parent, the mate I chose to be with, what I believe.... EVERYTHING <br/>
about who I am today.<br/>
And I always said that I think it impacted me the most. I related <br/>
with her the most. After she was gone I was always compaired to her <br/>
{in a negitive way}. Anyway nothing like a death of a person where <br/>
you KNOW they are dead and you have a set time to morn. I morn her <br/>
absence but know not that she is gone. In a since she became a large <br/>
part of me.<br/>
ANYWAY...<br/>
 There&#39;s no way I could explain the whole history and the whole <br/>
ramifications {no spell check} just as I couldn&#39;t say for sure how <br/>
loosing a child would effect me {but I do have a pretty good idea <br/>
because of this I VERY MUCH have imagined it over and over along with <br/>
them being abducted}, unless you have had a close family member <br/>
missing, where you don&#39;t know ANYTHING {all these for emphasis} <br/>
 and have good reasons to expect the worse {like her being tortured <br/>
etc}, don&#39;t underestimate the change in a person that can occur due <br/>
to it all. :-)<br/>
