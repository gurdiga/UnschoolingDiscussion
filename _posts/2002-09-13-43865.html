 </span></blockquote>Just fun. They&#39;ll learn without you making life &quot;educational&quot; on purpose. <br/>
Life IS educational, automatically.<br/>
<br/>
But - if that&#39;s too much of a mind-twist, to start with -- start an <br/>
observational journal.Don&#39;t do any lessons. Play lots of games, read aloud to <br/>
them, dig in the dirt, cook, run around, play dressups, sing songs, bang on <br/>
the piano, play with a tape recorder, build with legos or blocks, do puzzles, <br/>
draw and paint and color wildly......<br/>
<br/>
Your job is to look at all the things they do and get in touch with WHY they <br/>
are doing them - what are they learning?<br/>
<br/>
They are ALWAYS learning if it is something they are choosing to do <br/>
themselves. Learning is the same as living IF a person is free to choose how <br/>
to live their own life.<br/>
<br/>
Keep a journal for a while, jotting down the learning you see happening, <br/>
until you don&#39;t need to anymore.<br/>
