<div id="ygrps-yiv-321677334">We recenlty read &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot; by Lemony Snicket.  Tonight we were<br/>
talking about different things we could name our *school* (we have to pick a<br/>
name for the state and we already have one for this year, but anyway) and<br/>
Leigh (8) said we could name it The Ersatz School!  One meaning of ersatz is<br/>
imitation.  (although our *school* is certainly not an inferior imitation!)<br/>
I thought that was a great idea.  Ah, the joy of books! <br/>
