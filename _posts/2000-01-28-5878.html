<div id="ygrps-yiv-911235225">You might want to check out a wonderful little garden site at www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/6160. It is full of EASY gardening ideas to make it a true family affair. We have had fun with teepee gardens and sunflowers (which we let our cardinal bird friends eat on). We even started a small butterfly garden. We add a little each year, this year we are going to add the garden steps she has along with some &quot;lasagna beds&quot; (if I can ever get my book away from my mother, LOL)......just an idea...Aleasa</div>
