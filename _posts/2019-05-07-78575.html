At a couple of conferences in those days (2013) I did workshops in which each participant ws asked to name a person, or to tell a story (if they didn’t know the person’s name) about something that was said or done that changed the trajectory of their parenting knowledge and practice.  <br/>
<br/>
The stories are touching and sweet.  You probably have one, too.  If you want to share it here, I think it will be read gratefully!  Credit those who helped you grow, even if it was a teacher in school, or a relative whose voice is in your head in ways that aren’t always positive.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839494517">When Sky was 4, he was in daycare. It was NOT a rich learning environment! I found a wonderful, part-time, parent co-op preschool that focused on play and emotional intelligence. It was a few hours a morning, a few times a week. The teachers there had teen children themselves, and each had more than a decade of experience in this particular school. Sky joined late in the year, October I think. We had our first parent-teacher conference in December or January.&nbsp;<br><br>At the meeting, the teacher gave me a helpful review -- her input of Sky&#39;s development as someone who was really trying to see *him* and get to know him as a person. She asked at the end if I had any questions. I did. I was desperate to know how to make him stop lying and stealing things that I told him were &quot;mine&quot;. My markers, my contact solution, the q-tips in my bathroom, tampons! It seems comical now, to think about how much I was getting in my own way by both being too far away and simultaneously trying to control every detail in our home.&nbsp;<br><br>The teacher smiled patiently, then said carefully, &quot;Every behavior has a function.&quot;&nbsp;<br><br>While this moment had nothing to do with unschooling, it was pivotal for my relationship with my child. It gave me the approval from an elder that I needed, to see my role as his mother differently. She gave me permission to stop trying to make him understand me and instead to keep trying to understand him. <br><br>When he was a baby, I didn&#39;t take any of his behavior personally. I looked for cues, I assumed he knew something that I didn&#39;t know and that it was my job to understand. But in toddlerhood, I started to have shame around some of his behaviors. I was so concerned with getting the behaviors to stop -- and stop reflecting poorly on me --&nbsp; that my priorities got jumbled up. My parenting had become very much a performance for the Gaze of others rather than a path to intimacy and peace with my child.&nbsp;<br><br>The paradigm shift that occurred when I understood her words to me handed my curiosity back to me. With it came trust, that I could follow his lead and we&#39;d be ok. That moment primed me for unschooling.&nbsp;<br><br>Tara Joe Farrell</div>
