<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213213477">Have any of you ever actually listened to the words of You Learn, by <br/>
Alanis Morissette?<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You Learn<br/>
<br/>
I recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone <br/>
I recommend walking around naked in your living room <br/>
Swallow it down (what a jagged little pill) <br/>
It feels so good (swimming in your stomach) <br/>
Wait until the dust settles <br/>
<br/>
You live you learn <br/>
You love you learn <br/>
You cry you learn <br/>
You lose you learn <br/>
You bleed you learn <br/>
You scream you learn <br/>
<br/>
I recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone <br/>
I certainly do <br/>
I recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at anytime <br/>
Feel free <br/>
Throw it down (the caution blocks you from the wind) <br/>
Hold it up (to the rays) <br/>
You wait and see when the smoke clears <br/>
<br/>
You live you learn <br/>
You love you learn <br/>
You cry you learn <br/>
You lose you learn <br/>
You bleed you learn <br/>
You scream you learn<br/>
<br/>
Wear it out (like a three-year-old would do) <br/>
Melt it down (you&#39;re gonna have to eventually anyway) <br/>
The fire trucks are coming up around the bend <br/>
<br/>
You live you learn <br/>
You love you learn <br/>
You cry you learn <br/>
You lose you learn <br/>
You bleed you learn <br/>
You scream you learn<br/>
<br/>
You grieve you learn <br/>
You choke you learn <br/>
You laugh you learn <br/>
You choose you learn <br/>
You pray you learn <br/>
You ask you learn <br/>
You live you learn</div>

Another great song is by John Mayer (CD is Room for Squares) No Such Thing.<br/>
Hes got a great website, too. www.johnmayer.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.johnmayer.com/">http://www.johnmayer.com/</a>&gt; . The first song you hear is the one Im talking<br/>
about. Its an unschoolers /break-out song if ever there was one!~<br/>
