Makes me sad. But I had similar thoughts when we were in different areas of <br/>
the country/world (military). I&#39;ll say it NOW before it&#39;s too late. You&#39;re <br/>
going to miss it when you&#39;re gone! Maybe not ALL of it! Maybe not MOST of it! <br/>
But you WILL miss it! <br/>
<br/>
Make the best of it, Shyrley! Get out and visit unschoolers---we have SO many <br/>
on this list! You never have to be in VA again until you leave! Really! A new <br/>
family every week!<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re going to miss being able to grocery shop at 3:00am! And (although <br/>
you hate it now!) WARM weather! And all SORTS of things about VA that piss <br/>
you off now ---you&#39;ll miss!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy it NOW. Bitch about it later. It&#39;s not a permanent condition. Enjoy it! <br/>
Or as the Officers&#39; Wives say, &quot;Bloom where you are planted!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
And WalMart on Saturday afternoons a 5pm because you started a project at<br/>
noon and now you need something. (All german stores close at 2p.m. on Sat.)<br/>
<br/>
And your favorite restaurants, unless McDonalds is your favorite.....<br/>
<br/>
I like Kelly&#39;s idea about a new family every week.  I&#39;m coming to the States<br/>
in March.  Think I could piece together a new family for every week until<br/>
the conference in August so I don&#39;t have to fly back until then?!?!<br/>

The Germans were great about breastfeeding in public.  People would move so I <br/>

some of the time! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

We have a German fellow coming in mid-March for three months (he&#39;ll have to <br/>
share Duncan&#39;s bunkbed!). He wants to better his English. It&#39;s always fun to <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But that&#39;s what I meant! You WILL miss some things, no matter how homesick <br/>
you might be NOW. When you&#39;re gone, the neat things about the place you left <br/>
will be JUST as missed as home is now. <br/>
<br/>
I miss the yellowness of northern California, the wineries, the fresh and <br/>
funky food, the cute restaurants and shops, the &quot;looseness&quot; of the people. <br/>
<br/>
Germany---all of what Pam described plus our incredible neighbors, the rich <br/>
food, the wineries (there&#39;s a pattern?&lt;g&gt;) and fests, actually HAVING the <br/>
stores closed by noon on Saturdays (seems more civilized!), and the <br/>
cleanliness and &quot;oldness&quot; of it. And the proximity of so many different <br/>
countries and cultures. <br/>
<br/>
St Louis area---I miss my quaint downtown life (we lived just 5 blocks from <br/>
Main Street), all the cultural offerings, &quot;The Hill&quot; (Italian restaurants), <br/>
and my weird friends.<br/>
<br/>
We learned our lesson from California. We bitched constantly about EVERYTHING <br/>
there, but after we left, we realized how much fun we had---and what we <br/>
really missed. We decided NOT to do that again, and we enjoyed our other <br/>
tours SO much more! We seem to REALLY enjoy going back out to California <br/>
whenever we can! <br/>
<br/>
Your stay is what YOU make of it. It&#39;s not permanent---and it can be a lot of <br/>
fun if you&#39;ll put homesickness out of your mind.<br/>

Wow, you actually had someone say that to you??? I&#39;ve never experienced <br/>
anything like that while nursing. I&#39;ve nursed in all kinds of public places <br/>

out of the room everytime I started to unbutton!!!!! That was actually a <br/>
good thing. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

now.  I guess we missed the wineries too much.  And the flea markets, love <br/>
those.  Germany had great flea markets.  There was a Mexican restaurant we <br/>
loved there.  Can&#39;t remember the name ,it was tacky though,  they used cole <br/>
slaw instead of lettuce or tomato in everything.  Taco with cole slaw. <br/>
burrito with cole slaw inside etc.  It was not authentic but it was great.  <br/>
Oh well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100418421">I was visiting the crayola factory with a friend and her kids, and <br/>
she was breastfeeding.  There was school group there, and a teacher <br/>
asked her to please take it to the bathroom.  She said that these <br/>
kids are worldly and that they shouldn&#39;t be exposed to looking at a <br/>
woman&#39;s breast.  My friend did go to the bathroom, and didn&#39;t tell me <br/>
until after the teacher had left.  (I was off with the kids while she <br/>
was nursing).  <br/>

If I had been there, I would have had a thing or two to say to that <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;m trying. I have realised that once we go back to the UK I&#39;ll never be able to visit the US again. DH&#39;s UK salary wont allow it. We&#39;ll probably stay another year for that very reason and try and<br/>
treat it like a long vacation. It&#39;s just that the day to day living is grinding me down.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to be teenagers here though. There&#39;s no buses. How are teens meant to go visit their friends? Now that Heather is nearly 11, back home I&#39;d feel happy about her going out and<br/>
cycling to a friends house or catching the bus to the town centre. She&#39;s very restricted here cos there&#39;s no public transport and the roads are so congested that *I* feel nervous on my bicycle. Endless<br/>
suburbia with no heart and no transport :-(<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t regret moving here at all. It was time for a change and back home in Malvern we&#39;d been there 10 years and I could see the rest of my life stretching out before me, unchanging, with the same<br/>
people. I had to get out of there!!!  I&#39;ve met some great people, learned that stereotypes don&#39;t describe America (well, apart from you lot saying y&#39;all and Sherifff&#39;s spitting tobacco juice...) and<br/>
seen some cool stuff like the Grand Canyon.<br/>
Now I miss my country. I miss being able to have conversations without explaining different terms or having people look blank cos I&#39;ve used a cultural reference. I miss seeing my mum. She&#39;s 68 now and<br/>
seeing her once a year isn&#39;t a good thing especially cos she&#39;s sick. I miss going to the pub. I miss sheep. I miss being able to cycle to the supermarket without some jerk in Hummer trying to kill me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m getting maudlin. I appreciate your email though.<br/>
Start inviting me places and I&#39;ll do a big road trip :-)<br/>

I guess I&#39;ve been lucky then. Done it in malls, theaters, zoos, museums, <br/>

anyone give me the impression they were unhappy about it. How awful for <br/>

&lt;&lt;We learned our lesson from California. We bitched constantly about <br/>
EVERYTHING <br/>
there, but after we left, we realized how much fun we had---and what we <br/>
really missed. We decided NOT to do that again, and we enjoyed our other <br/>
tours SO much more! We seem to REALLY enjoy going back out to California <br/>
whenever we can! <br/>

bathroom if you&#39;re willing to eat *your* lunch there.&quot;  I probably would<br/>
have also said something about it being good for kids to know how babies are<br/>
fed.  But I never had a chance to say such things because nobody ever<br/>
bothered me about it.  Perhaps it had something to do with my &quot;Mama Bear<br/>

It happens here sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ya&#39;ll&quot; is used in southeastern New Mexico but central and northern say &quot;you <br/>
guys.&quot;  We&#39;re a linguistic border state. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone in England says &quot;jolly&quot; or &quot;blimey&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s <br/>
not really cool to hear someone &quot;in the wild&quot; say it (as opposed to scripted <br/>
on a movie or TV).  Same with &quot;bloody&quot; and &quot;arse.&quot;  Comedians saying it are <br/>
just that.  But real little old men in uttering those words in front of <br/>
betting offices, that&#39;s the TRUE wonderful tourist experience!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this before, but when we were in Kirk Ella (near Hull, which is <br/>
near York, which is NE England) I couldn&#39;t understand the little throw-away <br/>
phrases which were things with meanings like &quot;thanks&quot; or &quot;see ya&quot; or &quot;here <br/>
you go&quot; (like when people are giving you change or a receipt) or &quot;How are <br/>
you?&quot;  I would stand there baffled trying to figure out what they said.  But <br/>
Holly always understood them.  So she would translate for me, or make some <br/>
appropriate response and lead me away.<br/>

It&#39;s about 286 miles to Pocatello from here.   There are other<br/>
