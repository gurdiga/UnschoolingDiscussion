<div id="ygrps-yiv-794441329">Just HAVE to share this with you.<br/>
Diana A.<br/>
&quot;the world is our classroom&quot;<br/>
READ THIS.  LET IT REALLY SINK IN...THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU START<br/>
YOUR DAY<br/>
TOMORROW...<br/>
<br/>
    Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in<br/>
a good<br/>
mood  and always has something positive to say.<br/>
When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply,<br/>
&quot;If I were any better, I would be twins!&quot;<br/>
He was a natural motivator.  If an employee was having a bad<br/>
day,<br/>
Michael was  there telling the employee how to<br/>
look on the positive side of the situation.<br/>
    Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went<br/>
up to<br/>
Michael and asked him, &quot;I don&#39;t get it!  You<br/>
can&#39;t be a positive person all of the time.  How do you do it?&quot;<br/>
     Michael replied, &quot;Each morning I wake up and say to myself,<br/>
Mike<br/>
you have two choices today.<br/>
You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose  to be in<br/>
a bad<br/>
mood.  I choose to be in a good mood.<br/>
Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or<br/>
I can<br/>
choose to learn from it.<br/>
I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me<br/>
complaining, I<br/>
can choose to accept their complaining or I<br/>
can point out  the positive side of life.  I choose the positive<br/>
side<br/>
of  life.<br/>
     &quot;Yeah, right,  it&#39;s  not that easy,&quot; I protested.<br/>
<br/>
     &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Michael said. &quot;Life is all  about choices.<br/>
When you<br/>
cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.<br/>
You choose how you react to situations.  You choose how people<br/>
will<br/>
affect your mood.  You choose<br/>
to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It&#39;s your<br/>
choice how<br/>
you live life.&quot;<br/>
I reflected on what Michael said.  Soon thereafter, I left the<br/>
Tower<br/>
Industry to start my own business.  We lost<br/>
touch, but I often thought about him  when I  made a choice<br/>
about life<br/>
instead of  reacting to it.<br/>
<br/>
    Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a<br/>
serious<br/>
accident, falling  some 60 feet from a communications<br/>
tower.  After 18 hours of surgery  and  weeks of intensive care,<br/>
Michael<br/>
was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back I<br/>
saw<br/>
Michael about  six months after the accident. When I asked him<br/>
how he<br/>
was, he replied.<br/>
    &quot;If I were any better, I&#39;d be twins. Wanna see my scars?&quot;<br/>
I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone<br/>
through his<br/>
mind  as the accident took place.<br/>
    &quot;The first thing that went through my mind was the<br/>
well-being of my<br/>
soon  to  be born daughter,&quot; Michael replied.<br/>
    &quot;Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered that I had two<br/>
choices:<br/>
I could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to<br/>
live.&quot;<br/>
      &quot;Weren&#39;t you  scared?   Did you lose consciousness?&quot; I<br/>
asked.<br/>
Michael continued, &quot;...the paramedics were great. They kept<br/>
telling me I<br/>
was going to be fine.  But when they wheeled me into the ER and<br/>
I saw<br/>
the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got<br/>
really<br/>
scared. In their eyes, I read  &#39;he&#39;s a dead<br/>
man.&#39; I  knew I  needed to take action.&quot;<br/>
     &quot;What did you do?&quot; I asked.<br/>
    &quot;Well, there was a  big burly nurse shouting questions at<br/>
me,&quot; said<br/>
Michael.<br/>
      &quot;She asked if I was allergic to anything.<br/>
     &#39;Yes, I replied.&quot;  The doctors  and nurses stopped  working<br/>
as they<br/>
waited for my reply.  I took a deep  breath and<br/>
yelled, &quot;Gravity.&quot;<br/>
Over their laughter, I told them, &#39;I am choosing to live.<br/>
Operate on me<br/>
as if I am alive, not dead&#39;.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Michael lived, not just due to the skill of his doctors, but<br/>
also<br/>
because of  his amazing attitude.<br/>
I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live<br/>
fully.<br/>
Attitude, after all, is everything.  You have two choices now:<br/>
     1. Delete this.<br/>
              or<br/>
     2. Forward it to the people you care about.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will choose #2.  I did.</div>
