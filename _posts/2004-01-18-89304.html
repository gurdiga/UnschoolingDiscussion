a description of how to play it with just dice and paper, too. <br/>

It is called &quot;Countdown&quot; and they sell it at Target and I think I also <br/>
saw it at Wizards of the Coast, which is going out of business and has <br/>
everything marked down 30 to 50 percent right now (except Magic, the <br/>
Gathering cards).<br/>

have changed all of the rules and are having a blast, my 12yro can&#39;t get enough. <br/>
I will write how we play when I get a minute.<br/>

My son got two versions of this game for Christmas in a tin box filled with <br/>
other peg games.  Ah, now I look and it came from Target &lt;bg&gt;  It&#39;s a red <br/>
canister, &quot;7 wood mind-teaser games,&quot; and a sticker that says it only cost $8!!  <br/>
Check out www.target.com ~ very fun games!!   <br/>
