We had a fisher cat in our yard too. (We&#39;re in CT also) They sound just like <br/>
a baby crying, sort of spooky especially when you don&#39;t expect to see them in <br/>
these areas!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Another note about nature watching - we saw a fisher cat in our yard <br/>
yesterday. I live in Connecticut. Apparently they are rare around here. They <br/>
are strange looking - but it did make for an interesting Internet Search as <br/>
this one was light brown/tan whereas all of the photos I have found showed a <br/>
black or dark brown animal.  My neighbor says they adapt their color to their <br/>
surroundings like a deer.  I couldn&#39;t  find this info anywhere. &gt;&gt;</div>
