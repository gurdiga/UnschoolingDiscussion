&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t view banning as censorhip -- though I guess one could argue that <br/>
it is in the strictist sense.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But censorship involves keeping a person from having a voice.  It is NOT <br/>
censorship for the local paper to choose which letters to the editor it <br/>
publishes.  It would be censorship for the government to tell the paper it <br/>
couldn&#39;t publish anything.<br/>
<br/>
Ned can say what he wants in his own forum.  This isn&#39;t Ned&#39;s forum.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Shut up in my house&quot; isn&#39;t censorship, it&#39;s responsible home ownership <br/>
sometimes, if the person is saying things you reall, TRULY do not want said <br/>
in your house and you  haven&#39;t gotten him to shush otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I have some yahoo groups on different subjects.  I get to run them my way.  <br/>
One&#39;s never had anyone else put off, but it&#39;s about mentors and students in <br/>
the SCA (and is inactive lately anyway).  One is the New Mexico homeschooling <br/>
list.  Nobody&#39;s ever been put off.  The other is an unschooling discussion <br/>
that has people thrown off all the time for trying to sell us stuff.  But I <br/>
have lovely assistants who kick them off for spamming the list.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not censorship.  They have the right to try to sell things, but not on <br/>
my list.<br/>
<br/>
Ned was vaguely trying to sell something.  Maybe he&#39;s going to run for office <br/>
again.  Maybe he&#39;s going to publish a book.  I have no idea.  But it was like <br/>
a sales pitch or a campaign, and he was hooked on phonics in a bad way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a point worth being aware of. Undoubtedly Christian debate can<br/>
feel like real open debate but it&#39;s constrained by the Christian viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
If someone brings in ideas from a secular viewpoint that are incompatible<br/>
with the Christian viewpoint, are the ideas wrong? Or is the Christian list<br/>
wrong? Is it wrong to constrain a vision to what you believe is right?<br/>
<br/>
Kind of a scary thought.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling debate here is constrained by the ideal of treating children<br/>
as fellow human beings due the respect that adult humans get. It&#39;s what<br/>
ideas are judged and weighed against.<br/>
<br/>
Is that ideal necessary for unschooling? Shouldn&#39;t someone question whether<br/>
that ideal is necessary for unschooling? And if it isn&#39;t, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling ideas that don&#39;t encompass that particular ideal be allowed to<br/>
stand side by side with those that do?<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s idea of unschooling includes coercive parenting, are they<br/>
unschooling wrong?<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes in here with incompatible ideas and they &quot;get shouted down&quot;<br/>
is it because their ideas were full of holes or because a few posters with<br/>
narrow views are more skilled at debate?<br/>
<br/>
If someone says something doesn&#39;t work, is it because the theory doesn&#39;t<br/>
work in all cases or because someone wasn&#39;t doing it right? Does someone<br/>
need to be able to articulate unschooling well in order to understand it?<br/>
<br/>
If something truly doesn&#39;t work, would anyone be brave enough to come here<br/>
and say so?<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of debate has at it&#39;s foundation goals that differ. Someone<br/>
can argue that punishment works while someone argues that punishment<br/>
doesn&#39;t. If both families have decent children, how can one be wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Well, they can both be right because they have different goals. The first<br/>
has a goal of training their kids to do right. The second of helping their<br/>
kids make their own decisions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Joyce:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughtful response. Now, we&#39;re talking about the ideas <br/>
behind the action of censorship.<br/>
<br/>
1. Is it wrong to constrain a vision to what you believe is right?<br/>
I believe that we cannot truly know what we believe if we constrain our <br/>
vision. I think it was Plato(?) in the allegory of the cave who told the <br/>
story of some people who were chained to a cave wall and only ever able to <br/>
see shadows on the wall opposite. They believed that all reality was shadows, <br/>
because that was their only experience. One day, one of the people got loose <br/>
from his chains, and went outside. He discovered that true reality was much <br/>
more than shadows when seen in the full light of day. When he went back to <br/>
his friends whose &quot;vision was constrained,&quot; they refused to believe him or <br/>
listen.<br/>
<br/>
2. The unschooling debate here is constrained by the ideal of treating <br/>
children<br/>
as fellow human beings due the respect that adult humans get. It&#39;s what<br/>
ideas are judged and weighed against.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this, but would add that we should also treat adults with the <br/>
same respect that we would our children.<br/>
<br/>
3. Is that ideal necessary for unschooling? Shouldn&#39;t someone question <br/>
whether<br/>
that ideal is necessary for unschooling? And if it isn&#39;t, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling ideas that don&#39;t encompass that particular ideal be allowed to<br/>
stand side by side with those that do?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we should always question---that is how we learn. There is no definition <br/>
for unschooling, other than the broken down word itself---un = not  +  <br/>
schooling. Schooling is many things, so notschooling must be as many opposite <br/>
things. <br/>
<br/>
4. If someone&#39;s idea of unschooling includes coercive parenting, are they<br/>
unschooling wrong?<br/>
<br/>
We all may wish we could parent and relate to others without coercion, but <br/>
almost every interaction with others involves some level of coercion. If I <br/>
ask my child to scrape his plate into the trash is that coercive ?, and if he <br/>
refuses and then I scrape it so that there will be a clean plate later, am I <br/>
being manipulated? Is coercion in our daily living O.K. but not O.K. <br/>
regarding academics? If I say to my child, I want to teach you how to tie <br/>
your shoes because I&#39;m sick of tying them, and you are old enough to learn, <br/>
is that wrong? Then if I say I want to teach you how to read because I&#39;m sick <br/>
of reading everything for you, you are old enough to learn, and besides I&#39;ve <br/>
got my own book to read, is that wrong? Unschooling is an ideal, something we <br/>
work toward with different levels of purity and success.<br/>
<br/>
5. If someone says something doesn&#39;t work, is it because the theory doesn&#39;t<br/>
work in all cases or because someone wasn&#39;t doing it right? Does someone<br/>
need to be able to articulate unschooling well in order to understand it?<br/>
<br/>
I think that we are all different, and that things that work for some, don&#39;t <br/>
always work for others. Also some theories are just lousy and don&#39;t work in <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we need to be able to articulate something in order to <br/>
understand it, but I think articulating most things helps us to gain deeper <br/>
understanding. Some people are incredibly intuitive and spiritual and don&#39;t <br/>
feel the need to articulate their experiences.<br/>
<br/>
6. If something truly doesn&#39;t work, would anyone be brave enough to come here<br/>
and say so?<br/>
<br/>
I think many wouldn&#39;t, not only because of what happened to Ned, but because <br/>
others have been attacked for stating views different from certain very <br/>
strong-minded individuals whose personal definitions of what constitutes <br/>
unschooling seem rather rigid to me.<br/>
<br/>
7. Lots and lots of debate has at it&#39;s foundation goals that differ. Someone<br/>
can argue that punishment works while someone argues that punishment<br/>
doesn&#39;t. If both families have decent children, how can one be wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Well, they can both be right because they have different goals. The first<br/>
has a goal of training their kids to do right. The second of helping their<br/>
kids make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that both are right. If the children are blooming, growing, and <br/>
happy---then they are both right. I&#39;ve known both types to raise wonderful <br/>
children, and I&#39;ve known both types to raise rotten nasty children. I think <br/>
what the successful ones have in common, are their capacity for love, <br/>
forgiveness, fairness and a strong sense of right and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
8. Does unschooling only encompass the goals of the best debaters here? If <br/>
that<br/>
is limiting unschooling, is calling this Unschooling.com misleading?<br/>
<br/>
Your best point. You&#39;ve said it better than I can. Perhaps since you are one <br/>
of the better debaters here, and have a history as such, you will have that <br/>
idea seriously considered.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, thank you.<br/>

&lt;&lt; 1. Is it wrong to constrain a vision to what you believe is right? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is locked in this cave.<br/>
That point has been made to you a couple of times, but it&#39;s not changing your <br/>
stance, it seems.<br/>
This is nobody&#39;s be-all and end-all, and the whole world is out there, as it <br/>
has been and will be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I agree with this, but would add that we should also treat adults with the <br/>
same respect that we would our children.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If people asked my children to change the subject they would do it.<br/>
<br/>
If they ask other people to change the subject, I&#39;d expect the other people <br/>
to do it too.<br/>
<br/>
The lack of respect seems to be a few people&#39;s respect for the rights of this <br/>
list to focus on unschooling, and of the owner and moderator to run it as <br/>
they have decided to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Then if I say I want to teach you how to read because I&#39;m sick <br/>
of reading everything for you, you are old enough to learn, and besides I&#39;ve <br/>
got my own book to read, is that wrong?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  No parent knows if a child is &quot;old enough to learn.&quot;  Learning doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to do with age, and a parent who asserts that it does will be <br/>
detrimental to other parents coming to natural learning without fears and <br/>
arbitrary measures.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who tell their kids they&#39;re sick of reading to them might as well put <br/>
them in school.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that attitude would not be in keeping with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I say to my child, I want to teach you how to tie <br/>
your shoes because I&#39;m sick of tying them, and you are old enough to learn, <br/>
is that wrong? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same, only unlike reading which eventually will come along if a child isn&#39;t <br/>
so traumatized he avoids it for life, shoes don&#39;t HAVE to be tied.  Velcro is <br/>
invented!  There are slip-ons.  <br/>
A parent who&#39;s unaware of those options might not be open minded enough to be <br/>
a good unschooler, but a parent who came here and said, &quot;My kid is old enough <br/>
to learn to tie his shoes, how do I teach him?&quot; would be reminded that age <br/>
doesn&#39;t guarantee &quot;ready&quot; and that velcro has been invented and there are <br/>
slip-ons.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think that we are all different, and that things that work for some, <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
always work for others. Also some theories are just lousy and don&#39;t work in <br/>
practice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you think unschooling is lousy and won&#39;t work, there&#39;s no sense in being <br/>
here.<br/>
If you think it might work, cool!<br/>
If you think other theories are better, I bet there are lists on which they <br/>
are being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some people are incredibly intuitive and spiritual and don&#39;t <br/>
feel the need to articulate their experiences.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How many of them join discussion lists where articulation is the only medium?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think many wouldn&#39;t, not only because of what happened to Ned, but <br/>
because <br/>
others have been attacked for stating views different from certain very <br/>
strong-minded individuals whose personal definitions of what constitutes <br/>
unschooling seem rather rigid to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you want links to other unschooling discussions and web pages?  There are <br/>
hundreds.  I bet you could find one you like or you could make your own.  <br/>
Since you&#39;re sure this one is flawed, you could make a perfect one!<br/>

government is not limiting speech on Unschooling-dotcom.  And<br/>
*absolute* freedom of speech applies nowhere.  Your posts are the first time<br/>
I&#39;ve heard the idea that unschooling should include absolute freedom of<br/>
speech.  I guess you must believe that it would be perfectly all right for<br/>
me to scream abuse and foul language at my kids, just because I felt like<br/>
it.  I should be able to walk into Congress or the Supreme Court and do the<br/>
same.  Right?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve said twice now that you&#39;re going to unsubscribe because<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom is not being run the way you&#39;d like it to be.  You&#39;ve<br/>
made your attempt to convince us that you&#39;re right and we&#39;re wrong.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have been successful.<br/>
<br/>
You keep talking about Ned, but I really think this is much more about<br/>
Sandra.  Sandra didn&#39;t make the decision about Ned.<br/>

Thanks for taking the time to explain.<br/>

I also think that if we are going to have all-out free speech on this<br/>
list then pointed suggestions to leave the list should also be<br/>
considered.  Free speech isn&#39;t always pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m personally not interested in reading a lot of posts from posters<br/>
(several, throughout the history of the list) that address the point of<br/>
how much they don&#39;t like the list.  In my opinion, people who don&#39;t like<br/>
this list should exercise their freedom not to read it.  There is no<br/>
reason I can comprehend for people who don&#39;t like the list to try and<br/>
change it when many people like it the way it is.  Thousands of other<br/>
homeschooling lists are only a few mouse clicks away.  This isn&#39;t the<br/>
