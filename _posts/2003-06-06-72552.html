<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564774954">Okay folks...I have been bombarded with e-mail, etc. on the timing of the <br/>
conference, unfortunately not all of it particularly nice. I would love to go <br/>
forward with this, and I want people to come! And since no one else has mentioned <br/>
wanting to do it, I&#39;m going forward.<br/>
<br/>
Late September and all of October are really not options. The area is crammed <br/>
with tourists visiting Salem for Haunted Happenings. If you&#39;d like to come <br/>
during that time, please do, and we&#39;ll have a good time. Just not for a <br/>
conference. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m doing a poll. Go to this URL and weigh in on your chosen time of year <br/>
for this. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You have five choices: April or May, Memorial Day weekend (maybe even with an <br/>
extra day), August, early November, or ANY!<br/>
<br/>
I already have some great plans happening...now we have to figure out WHEN so <br/>
I can figure out WHERE.<br/>
<br/>
Please vote ASAP!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>

That&#39;s horrible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry now that I even wrote the &quot;yeah!  After school starts they need <br/>
it!&quot; little thing, because if you&#39;re doing it you can do it your way.<br/>

<br/>
The problem with polls like that is that people&#39;s first choices don&#39;t reflect <br/>
what their &quot;can&#39;t possibly&quot; dates are.   I could do any except Memorial Day.<br/>
