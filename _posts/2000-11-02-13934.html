It was &quot;The Lutheran&quot;. I didn&#39;t mention the name since I figured it would be<br/>
rather obscure to most.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s my question answered.   I wondered whether it was a Christian <br/>
magazine hoping to bring elderly Pueblo grandparents to Jesus.  <br/>
<br/>
They have a perfectly good religion, and many of them are Catholic on top of <br/>
that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine such an organization coming out of Taos Pueblo itself--&quot;Let&#39;s <br/>
send the single elders who don&#39;t have grandkids around out to attach <br/>
themselves to Anglo and Hispanic families in town!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I probably will sound cranky and irritating to some on this list, but having <br/>
grown up across the Rio Grande from Santa Clara and down the river from San <br/>
Juan (my sister&#39;s kids went to San Juan Elementary before they homeschooled) <br/>
it sounds kind of suspicious.<br/>

<br/>
Calm down Sandra, who said anything about cramming religion or whatever down<br/>
their throats? The article in magazine was about a Lutheran pastor in South<br/>
Dakota who had lunch with Native American members of Custer (SD) Lutheran<br/>
Fellowship. The adopt-a-grandparent program was mentioned (a blurb) because<br/>
the main person interviewed is part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you just go to the website and check out the mission and history<br/>
of the program yourself? It started because some elderly Lakotas froze to<br/>
death due to their isolation. They want people to take a real interest in<br/>
these people and personally send them things they could use like food and<br/>
blankets. There&#39;s nothing even mentioned about religion.<br/>

<br/>
The address was Taos, New Mexico, so there was no reason for me to assume <br/>
anything about freezing Lakotas.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much, native people are WANTING some isolation from outside Society.  <br/>
It is very, very hard for me to believe that people who fight hard against <br/>
adoption of babies by non-Indian families want anyone &quot;adopting&quot; the elderly. <br/>
 Situations may be different in different parts of the country, with <br/>
different groups.  I was questioning whehter it was coming from the Pueblo or <br/>
from outside.  The answer is &quot;outside.&quot;</div>

<br/>
**The reason the address is Taos NM  is because one of the founders is Gail<br/>
Russel of Taos. There&#39;s a photo of her in tribal regalia at the website. The<br/>
other founders were 7 Lakota elders.<br/>
