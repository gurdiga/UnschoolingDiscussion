<div id="ygrps-yiv-296175737">Hey<br/>
<br/>
This could turn into a &quot;rattle off some steam&quot; post, but I do have a <br/>
question/need some SOMETHING to get me through an anxious time.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do when you and your partner have widely divergent styles <br/>
of thinking? I am a reader and a thinker. Love ideas! Want to delve <br/>
deeply into studying things, and really grasp the concepts in the <br/>
things I read. I get a true sense of fulfillment in getting out the <br/>
dictionaries and encyclopedias, notebooks, pens, etc...study tools... <br/>
and deeply exploring things: word meanings, etymology, language, <br/>
data, knowledge, facts. I love a mind challenge, and am always <br/>
reading. Frequently seen writing, too: letters, journals, stories. <br/>
Verbalizing. <br/>
<br/>
As such, my way of thinking &quot;looks&quot; like academic success and I have <br/>
proven myself by getting on dean&#39;s lists in college and by (don&#39;t <br/>
laugh. It&#39;s my favorite, nearly my only, validation) by scoring VERY <br/>
HIGH on all kinds of tests, whether IQ or Mensa challenges, or <br/>
whatever. My &quot;style&quot; of thinking looks like a superior intellect on <br/>
paper. (Let&#39;s not get into what I&#39;ve actually DONE with high scores <br/>
or good grades. Ha! Scoring high on a standardized test means <br/>
absolutely ZILCH in the real world. More people have said &quot;what <br/>
potential&quot; with a wistful gaze in my direction, than I&#39;d care to <br/>
remember)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Hubby isn&#39;t verbal. His intelligence is spatial. He&#39;s not a <br/>
big reader, and ideas don&#39;t excite him like they do me. He&#39;s not a <br/>
scholar, but more of a builder. He doesn&#39;t score high on standardized <br/>
tests, he isn&#39;t highly creative. This equates to his not &quot;looking&quot; <br/>
intelligent, but he really is genuinely smart, just in a different <br/>
way than myself. I look good on paper; he gets on with life and does <br/>
what needs doing. <br/>
<br/>
So, now I&#39;m watching my kids and finding out: Abbie is my scholarly <br/>
type, and the younger two are not. And it&#39;s MAKING ME NUTS! I want <br/>
them to read and write and have wonderful insights and make mental <br/>
connections in the world of literature...aaaagh!<br/>
<br/>
sorry. The reason this even comes up is: I&#39;m the bigger influence on <br/>
the kids than my hubby, as far as modeling behavior. It&#39;s easy for me <br/>
to get a book down and read, not so easy for my hubby to come up with <br/>
things to do that interest him. There&#39;s only so many decks you can <br/>
build, you know? He does take Robby with him on odd jobs and other <br/>
things, but just isn&#39;t as involved around the house. So, if my way of <br/>
learing is visual/verbal, and my kids&#39; way takes more after their <br/>
dad, spatially and kinesthetically...but their dad isn&#39;t as involved <br/>
in their day to day life as I am...and I model reading and writing, <br/>
but they need me to do things...aaaagh!<br/>
<br/>
anyone even slightly understand where I&#39;m coming from?<br/>

<br/>
Have your children come to you asking that you do things with them that you<br/>
feel you can&#39;t?  Are they requesting things that you feel like you just<br/>
can&#39;t give them because of a difference in personality? Is there someone<br/>
else that can provide different activities that they want besides you and<br/>
your husband? Other groups or even classes if they ask that they can get<br/>
involved in? Has any of it actually happened or are you anticipating the<br/>
what ifs?<br/>

<br/>
I could say DITTO to everything you said.    The only thing I can add is that <br/>
along with the same type of personality that your husband has, my husband is <br/>
also very negative.  He has even earned the nickname NEGATOR.   He calles it <br/>
&quot;realism&quot;   I call it a big old buzzkill, spoilsport, killjoy, wet rag.. .. <br/>
you get the idea.   <br/>
<br/>
One reason I took my kids out of school is because I see the effect that <br/>
school has had on my Dh.  My two younger boys are a  lot like my husband.  I <br/>
did not want to see them end up being negative with a low self esteem and <br/>
having to struggle through life feeling like failures.    I wonder how much <br/>
of this kind of stuff is just basic personality traits and how much is <br/>
&quot;environmental&quot; and circumstantial. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you need to be anything than what you already are.  Are <br/>
you happy with the way you learn and the things you do?  If yes, then <br/>
you are being a good model.  My kids are way more creative than I am.<br/>
In different ways from each other too.  I don&#39;t feel I need to model <br/>
a style of learning that is more up their ally.  They find their own <br/>
way by being given opportunities and freedom.  And they usually <br/>
really impress me.<br/>
Are you giving them the impression that reading and writing is <br/>
somehow better than deck building?  Just by doing it, you are showing <br/>
them that it&#39;s something YOU like, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are <br/>
going to come away with it&#39;s better, unless you are somehow giving <br/>
that message. (which I&#39;m not implying you are, just tossing ideas <br/>
around).<br/>
I&#39;m curious as to what you mean by, &quot;they need me to do things&quot;.<br/>
Do you mean things that you&#39;re not interested in, but they are?<br/>
There are many ways to facilitate, without having to &quot;do&quot;.<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine trying to do everything my kids are interested in.  I <br/>
just take them where they need to go, tell them about things that <br/>
might interest them....whatever they need.<br/>
If your dh does things that your kids seem to be interested in, maybe <br/>
encourage him a bit more to include them.<br/>
Age counts.  My ds Sam started really being able to help his dad when <br/>
he was 7 or so.  They really started to bond more at that time.<br/>
My ds Jack is 6 and not quite there as far as being truely helpful, <br/>
so my dh has to show a lot of patience to include him and that&#39;s not <br/>
really a strong point of his.  So, I figure it will come with time, <br/>
while encouraging dh to do little things here and there.I hope this <br/>
helped.  I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s quite where you were going with your <br/>
post.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420470176">Hi Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
I understand where you are coming from. My husband is just like you and I am <br/>
just like your husband. I&#39;m the one who likes to build things, can change the <br/>
oil on the vehicle and so on and he is more the creative one with his nose <br/>
stuck in a book all the time and loves to talk. He is now home all the time, <br/>
temporarily (He&#39;s an aircraft test pilot) and he is driving me crazy! His <br/>
best friend is the dictionary and I don&#39;t knock this because it is who he is <br/>
and he&#39;s a very smart person. Sometimes it gets on my nerves when he carries <br/>
on about what he reads but our son really does benefit from it all. Our son <br/>
does get a lot from me but not like he gets from his dad and that&#39;s okay. I <br/>
can&#39;t give you any advice because I can&#39;t find the words LOL, I just figured <br/>
I&#39;d let you know I understand where your coming from. I sometimes ask myself <br/>
the same question that you are asking.<br/>

<br/>
Ooh!  Ooh!  Over here!  I want a deck!  I really want a deck.  Pretty please!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been thinking about building a deck as a summer project, because<br/>
my husband is a teacher and is going to have some time on his hands. <br/>
But we are building on a steep slope, so I don&#39;t know if we are really<br/>
going to be able to do the work ourselves.  (I think the post holes need<br/>
to be exceptionally deep if they are supporting a taller beam.  But I<br/>
really don&#39;t know the right words to discuss the ideas.  Right now I<br/>
would trade some points of my SAT scores for more &quot;deck intelligence&quot;. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**So, if my way of learing is visual/verbal, and my kids&#39; way takes more<br/>

writing, but they need me to do things...aaaagh!**<br/>
<br/>
One idea would be to let your dh do more of the picking of toys and<br/>
tools for your kids if you think he has better understanding of the way<br/>
they learn.  Give them money and send them all to the hardware store and<br/>
see what happens.  &lt;bweg&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can learn to enjoy participating in some kinds of<br/>
construction?  I like building with Legos (they count!) and I&#39;m learning<br/>
to like trips to Home Depot (of course I immediately drift to the garden<br/>
department).  I&#39;m still afraid of power tools, so I&#39;m not a great role<br/>
model yet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  I don&#39;t think you being very bookish is harmful to your kids if you<br/>
unschool them.  It&#39;s not the same as having a bookish 1st grade teacher<br/>
who makes you read lots of books you don&#39;t like and write detailed book<br/>
reports about them when you want to run and climb on the monkey bars.<br/>
You aren&#39;t constraining and compelling your kids in these ways. (I<br/>
hope!) Your bookishness probably isn&#39;t &quot;bending&quot; or &quot;thwarting&quot; your<br/>
kids.  Just try to keep it that way. If you find yourself getting all<br/>
thwarty you can come on back and we&#39;ll give you a lecture.  (Do you<br/>
learn well from lectures? &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of great books written about the idea of multiple<br/>
intelligences.  So if you like books about ideas you can have fun<br/>
reading them.  ;-)</div>

<br/>
I read some articles about research about pessimism and one point that<br/>

There is a book called Learned Optimism that might help him, if he<br/>

<br/>
**One reason I took my kids out of school is because I see the effect<br/>

<br/>
Some people, including me, believe that schools teach &quot;learned<br/>
helplessness&quot;.  If a dog in a cage is being shocked and can&#39;t get out,<br/>
according to experiments after time he will learn that he is trapped in<br/>
the cage and won&#39;t go out even if the door is open.  I think school is a<br/>
very disempowering experience for most people.  It was for my dh.<br/>

Having a pessimistic outlook, you will probably succeed in your <br/>

Optimists can easily fail, but hey! they probably consider it a <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are building on a steep slope and it can be done.  LOL.  Jackson did a lot <br/>
of research before he got started but the deck is looking gorgeous and is <br/>
very large.  All you need is a good book. We found one at Home Depot or <br/>
Lowes.  On of those stores.  The book is real specific about what to do and <br/>
how to go about it.  <br/>
<br/>
He uses that as his unschooling example when talking with other homeschooling <br/>
dads.  He says that he knew nothing about building a deck but he wanted to do <br/>
it so he read and talked with people, at Lowes and Construction workers, <br/>
looked things up on line, etc., etc.  And that is how he wants his boys to <br/>
learn.  He wants them to know how to go about learning something that they <br/>
are interested in.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  This describes my dh, ds and me almost perfectly.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
got my nose in a book (or computer screen).  The first place I turn when I<br/>
want to learn about something new is the library or Internet.  I love<br/>
learning about things just because.  My husband reads for a short time<br/>
before going to sleep.  When he wants to learn something new, and it has to<br/>
be something practical, he turns to people.  He&#39;ll ask how to do something.<br/>
My son hates reading.  He does read stuff on the internet but only to find<br/>
out something specific, like how much that component he wants for his bike<br/>
would cost.  When he wants to learn something, and that means how to do<br/>
something, he&#39;s most likely to just jump right in and try to do it.  He<br/>
might watch someone else do it.  He has tons of mountain biking videos that<br/>
he watches a *lot*.  I know he&#39;s learning from them about biking, but now<br/>
that he&#39;s interested in film, I think he&#39;s learning about editing and camera<br/>
work from them as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something to keep in mind. As a ps&#39;er, though my grades were <br/>
awful, and I did not do well socially, I always scored REALLY high in <br/>
any test. Standardized tests seem to fit with a visual/verbal style <br/>
of intelligence, more than a spatial/kinesthetic style, therefore <br/>
people who score high seem to be &quot;more intelligent.&quot; I have come to <br/>
learn that standardized tests mean nothing at all in the real world, <br/>
but that old way of thinking (&quot;Look at that TEST SCORE!!! wow! Me <br/>
smart!&quot;) sticks something fierce. So far, I think I&#39;ve managed to <br/>
avoid passing this attitude to my kids, though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the input!<br/>

I love the deck he built for me two summers ago. It wraps around from <br/>
just that side of the front door, clear back to level with the back <br/>
of the house. A VERY pleasant sitting place in the evenings, as the <br/>
house faces to the southeast, and the setting sun is hot in the back, <br/>
but the shade in the front is sublime. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow. My hubby isn&#39;t negative, per se, but a bit of a pessimist about <br/>
things, and so am I. Where he and our son are in lock-step is in <br/>
their hatred of being nagged or talked into doing things. I&#39;ve had to <br/>
keep my tongue inside my head on many issues, because I don&#39;t want my <br/>
boy to have the same &quot;Can&#39;t do anything right&quot; that I sometimes see <br/>
in his dad. And I think it was his mother, more than school, that has <br/>
kept my hubby down and brought out his passivity. I don&#39;t want to be <br/>
to my son, what my mil is to my hubby: a nagging shrew who knows how <br/>
to do everything (in her own mind, but not in truth), and better than <br/>
anyone else. (ditto)<br/>
<br/>
So I need to lay off the kid, and let him grow in his direction, <br/>
supplying the trestle so to speak. Guidance, support, assistance as <br/>
he requests it.<br/>
<br/>
yeah. Thanks, Teresa<br/>

&lt;&lt; There is a book called Learned Optimism that might help him, if he<br/>

<br/>
Great book, great author, Martin Seligman.  He&#39;s got a website, too, <br/>
www.positivepsychology.org<br/>
<br/>
He also wrote:<br/>
Optimistic Child: A Proven Program to Safeguard Children Against Depression <br/>
and Building Lifelong Resilience<br/>
<br/>
His most recent book is Authentic Happiness.  Really very good.  <br/>

<br/>
You take questionairres to take stock of your personality and see what traits <br/>
are getting in the way of being happy, and which ones, strengthened and <br/>
encouraged, can help make you happier.  It&#39;s really very helpful, I thought.  <br/>
