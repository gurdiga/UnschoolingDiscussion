&gt;I have a dog that is having seizures.... not very often though.  The <br/>
&gt;last <br/>
&gt;one was over 2 months ago and very short.  He just had one, and it <br/>
&gt;lasted <br/>
&gt;for like 2-3 minutes....  is there anything anyone can suggest???  <br/>
&gt;Herbs, <br/>
&gt;oils????<br/>

can be controlled by medications.<br/>
