Have you thought of writing?  Short stories, novels, kids books...  Also, <br/>
besides all the stuff that&#39;s been suggested to be calmer- do you journal?  If <br/>
all else fails, this usually works for me before sleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-708046668">have I ever thought of writing? &lt;BG&gt; No, I&#39;ve never<br/>
THOUGHT about it. :) I just do it. Alot. But not<br/>
enough to keep up with all the ideas and characters<br/>
and stories in my head. :) My latest pursuit that I&#39;m<br/>
determined to actually FINISH (I usually don&#39;t finish<br/>
them, cuz a short story feels like I&#39;m leaving<br/>
everything else that happens later out, and a novel<br/>
just doesn&#39;t ever end. :)...) is about a girl named<br/>
Nari. It&#39;s kind of a odd mix of fantasy (as in<br/>
faeries, elves, etc...and involving characters that<br/>
I&#39;ve been writing about for years and years now),<br/>
science fiction, adventure, cyberpunk, and nonsense.<br/>
Who knows how it will turn out. But I am determined it<br/>
WILL end up being a complete &quot;project&quot;, that hopefully<br/>
maye someday will be published. I usually don&#39;t think<br/>
in those terms, but I&#39;ve been lately looking into alot<br/>
of different mags that accept unsolicited work<br/>
(fiction&#39;s really more my bag, I&#39;ve decided) and<br/>
making myself have a nice little free-writing time<br/>
every day. I&#39;ve never been much for journaling in the<br/>
sense of writing personal stuff down, but my free<br/>
writing notebook is kind of like a journal to me. <br/>
Thanks for asking, though. Love to talk about writing,<br/>
I do. :)<br/>
