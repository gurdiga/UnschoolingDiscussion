<div id="ygrps-yiv-295756653">Long and more about language and ideas than about practical  <br/>
unschooling, so feel free to skip it.<br/>
=======================================<br/>
<br/>
In Monday&#39;s chat the topic turned somehow to &quot;guilt and shame,&quot; and  <br/>
whether they were natural or were put on people from outside.<br/>
<br/>
There have been bits of discussion about that here too; I&#39;ve been in a  <br/>
couple of good conversations about it.<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;re natural, and have to do with regret and disappointment  <br/>
about having marred one&#39;s social standing (thinking in the most basic  <br/>
&#39;caveman&#39; terms).  I proposed on Monday that even a hermit could feel  <br/>
ashamed if he did something harmful to live or property in some  <br/>
careless way.<br/>
<br/>
Today the word-of-the-day word is &quot;connote.&quot;  I don&#39;t like their  <br/>
definition at all.   I think &quot;denote&quot; names or points at, and  <br/>
&quot;connote&quot; makes a more shaded connection, with judgment.   I don&#39;t  <br/>
think a connotation goes both ways.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway...<br/>
The example they used is &quot;guilt connotes remorse.&quot;   I don&#39;t think so  <br/>
at all.  But it did introduce &quot;remorse&quot; to my thought swirl.<br/>
<br/>
One can have remorse without being guilty (in a way).   Even if some  <br/>
incident isn&#39;t &quot;my fault,&quot; I could still feel great remorse at my  <br/>
having been there, and regret that I hadn&#39;t been able to do anything  <br/>
about it.   And maybe I&#39;m stretching &quot;remorse&quot; too far.<br/>
<br/>
In Catholic sin-absolving process (Frank or someone can correct me if  <br/>
I screw this up), it&#39;s not enough to confess.  There must be  <br/>
contrition.  I think of &quot;contrition&quot; as humble regret, or as remorse.   <br/>
Remorse doesn&#39;t necessarily include embarrassment.  Contrition  <br/>
should.   And then there&#39;s penance.  (Remorse can last a lifetime  <br/>
without hope of penance.)<br/>
<br/>
I like it when I&#39;m already pondering something and another clue is  <br/>
dropped on me.<br/>

  Visual Thesaurus Word of the Day: connote<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; connote<br/>
&gt; When two things are so closely related as to be inseparable (such as  <br/>
&gt; cause and effect) you can say that one connotes the other, as guilt  <br/>
&gt; connotes remorse. From this meaning is derived the related one of   <br/>
&gt; &quot;convey in addition to exact explicit meaning.&quot;  The derived noun  <br/>
&gt; connotation is nearly always related to this sense.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081467783">From another topic:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have a running audience in my head to keep my thoughts more  <br/>
clear... Prominent unschooling voices that I&#39;ve been reading for  <br/>
years, my mom and my sister, my dad, my husband, my children, and a  <br/>
couple of very traditional parents who I love and a couple of  <br/>
traditional parents who I have zero respect for. Almost everything I  <br/>
write is geared to that audience in some way or another even if they  <br/>
all aren&#39;t my actual audience! I don&#39;t really have an audience anyway,  <br/>
other than the one in my head and whoever happens to be out there  <br/>
reading!-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was Jenny Cyphers.<br/>
<br/>
It reminded me of Freud&#39;s concept of the Super Ego, the [perhaps  <br/>
judgmental] audience in our heads.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s why a hermit can feel remorse, because he has ideals.<br/>

<br/>
I think too, that we are our own worst critics!  I feel very deeply when I&#39;ve done things that I don&#39;t like, while, for others, it&#39;s a minor blip on the radar of life!  Just like how I really hate most of my artwork when I&#39;m done with it, and sometimes can&#39;t even bring myself to look at it for a loooong time.  After enough time has passed I can like it.  Same goes with mistakes or remorse.. with enough passing of time the intensity of feeling dissipates.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m less hung up about guilt and remorse than I am about the repeating of the things that causes it!<br/>

I would like to extend this discussion to how it directly connects to unschooling. Less about language and more about as it relates to unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Is it/should it be a goal of unschooling parents to raise a child in a guilt-free environment? And/or attempt to raise a child that does not feel guilt and/or remorse? <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, heavens no! One of the big things that has happened for Eric in a recent huge developmental jump (he does it that way--changes very fast all of a sudden, has since he was a baby) is that he now more deeply feels and more easily expresses remorse when he does something that hurts or inconveniences someone else, or creates conflict. It&#39;s healthy to feel remorse or guilt when things like that happen.<br/>
<br/>
But raising kids who recognize that remorse is part of a natural process, that doing something you feel remorseful about isn&#39;t the end of the world, and who can move on from that and let go of it--that is something I do hope for them. I used to have a really hard time letting go of my mistakes, and it&#39;s no way to live.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If guilt is natural, it would be contorting reality to try to prevent  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s natural or not, the less guilt the parents can impose on  <br/>
kids, the better for unschooling. The more parents are aware of how  <br/>
their actions and words can create guilt and shame, the better for  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And/or attempt to raise a child that does not feel guilt and/or  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could we raise kids who don&#39;t feel love? Or don&#39;t feel hate? Or don&#39;t  <br/>
feel anger? How would that be possible? Why would an unschooler want  <br/>
to try to control her child&#39;s feelings?<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t control how others (our kids) feel, but we can control our  <br/>
own actions that unnecessarily cause a child to feel bad about himself  <br/>
and find better ways.<br/>
