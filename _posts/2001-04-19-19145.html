<div id="ygrps-yiv-809125531">Our kids probably watch a lot of movies/TV that other kids their ages don&#39;t get to watch....  ER, CSI, action/adventure movies, etc....  I think I do tend to shield them from gratuitous sex moreso than violence, though.  With the violence, it is pretty easy to see and understand what is &quot;wrong&quot; or undesirable with it.  The kids can identify a &quot;good guy&quot; and a &quot;bad guy.&quot;  With the sex... it just isn&#39;t that cut and dried.  We tend to fast forward through anything explicit...   I will discuss the relationship between the people with my 9yo... as it relates to our family&#39;s beliefs regarding sex as something for a married couple, though.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if a movie is full of violence for violence&#39;s sake, we usually won&#39;t want to watch it.  It needs to be key to the movie&#39;s plot.  Same with the sex and/or language.  We pretty much discuss anything that raises questions from the kids or that we think needs to be addressed.<br/>
