<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075738217">Does anyone here know how or have any advice on how to deal with demanding <br/>
parents and in-laws? I could really use some advice before I move on and loose <br/>
my cool with my family. Please excuse my way of writing, as you all know I am <br/>
not good with words. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always been the type of parents that procrastinate. We&#39;ll do it next <br/>
year, someday, maybe tomorrow and so on. Since we&#39;ve joined this list we now <br/>
have the attitude with ourselves and Christopher that there is no tomorrow, lets <br/>
do it now! Life is to short! <br/>
<br/>
Here is the problem: My parents whom we are extremely close to, think we are <br/>
ruining Christopher by unschooling him and that my husband and I are just <br/>
crazy. Christopher wanted all his hair shaved off and he got what he wanted and my <br/>
parents had a fit. I wanted to get some tattoo&#39;s, always have, I had them <br/>
done and now I am a freak. They&#39;ve bucked us right down to television, video <br/>
games, bed time and anything else under the sun. I guess our change in 6 months is <br/>
too much for them to swallow and I can understand that but it is getting to <br/>
be too much. <br/>
The big one hit Friday when we told them we are moving to New Hampshire by <br/>
the end of July. Now they won&#39;t talk to us! I know it must be hard for them as <br/>
we have never lived out of state but they know we&#39;ve been building on our land <br/>
for 3 years and we&#39;ve been saying someday, someday, someday. We&#39;re tired of <br/>
saying someday. We all want to go so badly, especially Christopher. With Kevin <br/>
being laid off from the airport for the last 6 months and the cabin almost <br/>
done, it&#39;s the perfect time. I hate to see my parents cry and I don&#39;t want them to <br/>
be mad but we just can&#39;t say okay maybe next year, that is the same thing we <br/>
kept on saying with our son in regard to homeschooling. Maybe next year. Big <br/>
Mistake.<br/>
<br/>
The second problem comes with my husbands parents. They left Kevin behind to <br/>
live on his own since 16 years old. 2 years ago they moved back from out of <br/>
the country to our state. Last year, they were both diagnosed with a terminal <br/>
illness. They are stubborn, live on their own and don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s help. They <br/>
are very mad that we are leaving. We&#39;re only going to be 3 1/2 hours away <br/>
from them, compared to the 1 1/2 hours we are now. Not too bad. They said they <br/>
came home to live close to their son and now we are leaving and if that weren&#39;t <br/>
bad enough we are ruining their grandson by unschooling him. He talks too much <br/>
now. I can&#39;t believe that bs! They&#39;ll never speak to us again if we go. The <br/>
way I look at it is Kevin is 44 now and Christopher will be 14. We are not <br/>
getting any younger. Christopher has been wanting to live there (on our land) <br/>
since he was 5 years old. He wants to do it before he&#39;s not a kid anymore. Kevin&#39;s <br/>
parents wanted their freedom to go off on their own, now we want ours. This <br/>
is the first time all 3 of us have been so happy and content with life and <br/>
moving there would make us all so much happier. We feel for them of course but to <br/>
stay till they die? They said we could just wait for that to happen. I don&#39;t <br/>
like that thought.<br/>
We&#39;ve told them over and over that we&#39;ll write, we&#39;ll visit and call them as <br/>
often as we can. We&#39;ve reassured them all that we will be just fine out there <br/>
in the woods. We want to go, go, go! All the brothers and sisters though are <br/>
very happy for us.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that enough or are we being selfish? Any thoughts? Sandra, what&#39;s your <br/>
thoughts?<br/>
How can we handle this without leaving on bad terms? There I go with the word <br/>
bad, you know what I mean. Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>
relationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either and <br/>
he&#39;s in tears. I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going to <br/>
breath now. Thank-you to anyone that can pass some wisdom to us.<br/>
<br/>

Ironic that New Hampshire&#39;s State motto is: Live Free Or Die<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps you can&#39;t leave on good terms.  I&#39;m sorry you are having such a hard <br/>
time.  I have dealt with this far more than I care to have.  I think your <br/>
family is most important, you, your husband and your son.  I know how <br/>
difficult it is to turn away from family and be chastised by them but in the <br/>
end, you have to do what is best for the people you love most.<br/>
<br/>
Your words above contain your answer, if you will listen to them.  &lt;&lt;This  <br/>
is the first time all 3 of us have been so happy and content with life and <br/>
moving there would make us all so much happier.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Dont put your life on hold for people who aren&#39;t supportive of you, <br/>
especially those who condemn the life you choose to lead!  Easier said than <br/>
done, but worse to forego your dreams and happiness for people like that.  <br/>
Family or not!<br/>

Best Wishes,<br/>

I would go, and go soon, and let them get over their uptight selves (or not).<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve read several other responses you&#39;ve already received, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
disagree with a bit of any I saw.  I think if you&#39;re over 21, they&#39;ve seen it <br/>
coming and had some time to prepare themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They are stubborn, live on their own and don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s help.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why, if they don&#39;t need your help?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Not too bad. They said they <br/>
came home to live close to their son and now we are leaving&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
Maybe they shouldn&#39;t be as needy as  16 year olds.<br/>
But wait!  They thought 16 was old enough to be on his own!<br/>
<br/>
This is just irrational on their part, it seems to me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;if that weren&#39;t <br/>
bad enough we are ruining their grandson by unschooling him. He talks too <br/>
much <br/>
now. I can&#39;t believe that bs!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell them you don&#39;t want his talkativeness to disturb them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Christopher has been wanting to live there (on our land) <br/>
since he was 5 years old. He wants to do it before he&#39;s not a kid anymore. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
GO GO GO!!!!<br/>
My boys are 14 and 16.  Do it NOW.   When he&#39;s grown he might end up being <br/>
there forever, or might end up moving far away, but he will have a few years of <br/>
being where he&#39;s wanted to be for 2/3 of his life thusfar!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is the first time all 3 of us have been so happy and content with life <br/>
and <br/>
moving there would make us all so much happier. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tadaa!!!<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s parents were retiring when I first met them, 25 years ago.  They&#39;re <br/>
still alive.  You want to wait 25 years?  DON&#39;T.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t that enough or are we being selfish? Any thoughts? Sandra, what&#39;s <br/>
your <br/>
thoughts?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think everybody else was saying &quot;go&quot; and they&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Christopher doesn&#39;t want to loose the wonderful <br/>
relationship he has with his grandparents but they won&#39;t talk to him either &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not wonderful.  WHAT &quot;wonderful relationship&quot; if they think he talks <br/>
too much and he&#39;s on the road to certain failure?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and <br/>
he&#39;s in tears. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s bad, but he can write to them, call them, make them gifts (and <br/>
probably won&#39;t, once he gets away and gets busy elsewhere).   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not their life.  Mayby they&#39;re mad because he&#39;s not the fantasy boy <br/>
they&#39;re envisioning (whatever they&#39;re envisioning), but he is who he is!  And he <br/>
wants to go to that property.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m so angry that they are acting like this! Okay, I&#39;m going to <br/>
breath now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just put that energy into packing and planning, and when you see them smile <br/>
really big, and if they&#39;re pissy back, put it in an imaginary jar of proof that <br/>
it&#39;s really fine that you&#39;re going.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kim, <br/>
<br/>
I ditto what Heidi and everyone else said. I do want to add something though. <br/>
When I read your post last nite, I was on a posting rampage, but stopped <br/>
myself because I felt your dilemma was worthy of longer contemplation. I have a <br/>
tendancy to jump the gun and get confrontational sometimes, especially when my <br/>
family is being hurt. My blood was boiling as I read your post. <br/>
<br/>
I think more than anything else, it was the blantant disregard for your <br/>
marriage and your parenting and boils down to manipulation. I have been on this <br/>
road since I kicked my own father out of my home and my life just over 4 years <br/>
ago. You see manipulation as I know it now, is a two way street. In that, I mean <br/>
that people always talk about manipulators, but never the manipulated. <br/>
Manipulation only works when two parties are playing the game. I thought I was not <br/>
an easily manipulated person in all aspects of my life. I was a rebel to the <br/>
core as far as the way stuff &quot;should&quot; be done and the way I did my own thing. <br/>
That is, except where my father was concerned. My mom used to tell me that my <br/>
dad was a great manipulator, and that she worried about how much he could <br/>
manipulate me and I was blind to it. Unfortunately, for 29 years I was more blind <br/>
than I really even want to admit. <br/>
<br/>
But when I opened my eyes to the pain he so easily afflicted on others, <br/>
especially his children and parents, I stepped back and realized I didn&#39;t want to <br/>
play the game anymore. I didn&#39;t want my kids to learn the game. I hated that my <br/>
siblings were stuck in the game because they were still minors. And when the <br/>
chips came tumbling down, I hated the fact that he had taught me from an early <br/>
age to play the manipulation game and I hated him for it. The more my sight <br/>
came back, the more I realized, I couldn&#39;t come up with a single positive thing <br/>
I liked about him. It was a horrible time in my life, but once I had all <br/>
these realizations, my own world started to make sense again.  The day he left my <br/>
home was the first day of my life that I knew I would never again be <br/>
manipulated, especially with something as important as love. <br/>
<br/>
You see that was his weapon of mass destruction...If you love me...you&#39;ll lie <br/>
for me, if you love me...you&#39;ll pick me over your mom, if you love <br/>
me...you&#39;ll live where I want you to, if you love me...you&#39;ll yada, yada, yada. Yet <br/>
doing all these things were never enough. <br/>
<br/>
My husband had had enough when my health was on a really bad road in 1996 and <br/>
all the surgeries were happening, one after another, then the near death <br/>
thing and my dad never showed up once. No call, no card, no is she gonna live? <br/>
Even after that, I still stayed in the game mode though. My DH couldn&#39;t forgive <br/>
him, but I could. He was my daddy. Three years later his own life fell apart <br/>
and who&#39;s door did he come knocking on? Shockingly, my DH said, &quot;He has to stay, <br/>
Rhonda, he has no where else to go.&quot; I knew then that letting him and 3 of my <br/>
7 siblings move in could risk everything we had built, but Phil loved me <br/>
enough to sacrifice his own feelings and try. Needless to say it didn&#39;t work. But <br/>
just like being sick can make you see stuff you never realized before, so can <br/>
these parents issues. For as horrible as it all went down, it was the only way <br/>
I was gonna really open my eyes, and realize I have the power to not let <br/>
anyone manipulate me, not even my parent.<br/>
<br/>
So as sad as it is, and yes, it is in fact sad, your parents and your DH&#39;s <br/>
parents, have chosen to use your families love against you. They are using it to <br/>
manipulate you, your hubby, and the worst of all, your child. I say, DON&quot;T <br/>
play the game. They have the choice to be mean and hateful or loving and kind, <br/>
either way it&#39;s their choice. As far as your son goes, I think a discussion of <br/>
what qualifies as sacrifice based on love vs. manipulation based on love maybe <br/>
in order. If they had 3 months to live and there was no doubt that they would <br/>
live past that time frame, that may be a sacrifice, where you love them <br/>
enough to postpone your own stuff. But to simply be throwing tantrums and pulling <br/>
that crap with your kid about not speaking to him, because your choices don&#39;t <br/>
agree with theirs, therefore you must not love them, well I&#39;d say they are all <br/>
full of shit. By the fact that your son is in tears over the things they <br/>
threaten, would have me moving sooner than July. Figuratively of course. In other <br/>
words, I&#39;d tell them you&#39;re leaving and you hope to have their best wishes, but <br/>
if they are too selfish to give you even just that much, are they even worth <br/>
one more tear? Especially the tears of your child? We are adults who can make <br/>
choices based on our experiences, but your son is watching all of this playing <br/>
out, what is it that you want him to learn?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, it seems I have still ranted, but I guess like always I had a lot to <br/>
say. <br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps, good luck and best wishes!!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490140381">Thank-you everyone that responded on list and off to our situation. Your <br/>
advice and personal stories helped us tremendously especially Christopher. He read <br/>
every one of them. <br/>

were just plain cold towards us barely saying a word but we just kept on <br/>
smiling! My parents were very quiet but I knew that wouldn&#39;t last long.<br/>
At one point, my mother went on one of her ranting modes and to our surprise <br/>
it was Christopher that spoke up and said his peace! A bit of a surprise. <br/>
Christopher&#39;s very talkative in the last year but still needed to come out of that <br/>
shell of expressing himself without anger and bitterness. He put us in tears! <br/>
He was honest and kind with his words when he told his grandparents this: <br/>
Grandma, try not to think of yourself so much when it comes to OUR lives. I love <br/>
you guys so much but you are being selfish. Grandpa says to Christopher: how <br/>
so son? Christopher said because grandpa, when you are not selfish you find hap<br/>
piness in what makes your kids happy. I am happy with my family and I will be <br/>
happy in New Hampshire. <br/>
<br/>
By now grandma breaks out in yet another rant of: see what you&#39;ve done with <br/>
this kid? This is the first time I can honestly say Kimberly that you have <br/>
always been such a good (now I know where I got that nasty habit)! mother that I <br/>
am disappointed in you and the way you are letting this kid go wild. Blah, <br/>
blah, blah. I am so glad I am not my mother anymore!!!! Wild? From speaking his <br/>
mind in a very calm and sweet voice? I calmly explained to her that with those <br/>
words she not only insulted me as his mother but insulted him as her grandchild <br/>
and makes herself look foolish. What kind of close relationship is that? I <br/>
explained to her that we have changed and that we don&#39;t want to live life for <br/>
anyone else but ourselves. Nobody dictates our life to us anymore, time to <br/>
lighten up, relax and enjoy what we have and we are going with or without their <br/>
blessings. <br/>
<br/>
Dad, who is really my step dad accepted this but said he was not happy we are <br/>
moving and that is okay with us. Mom on the other hand left the room and did <br/>
not return even when we were leaving. I on the other hand feel very refreshed <br/>
for some reason, not that I wanted for it to work out that way but I feel <br/>
happy. Strange. I guess I never realized how much DH or I have let our family <br/>
manipulate us. I guess we sort of let them know that they can be stiff and <br/>
materialistic all they want but we choose not to anymore. <br/>
<br/>
We spent the rest of the day packing boxes and blasting music and singing as <br/>
loud as we could. Usually we are quiet for our snooty neighbors. What a good <br/>
time we had regardless of what has happened. Even DH was singing which was a <br/>
first. And Christopher, well he is just so happy. Made me to think how I must <br/>
put more trust in DH and DS but mostly myself to make the right decisions. All <br/>
is well, in this family at least.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856961537">&lt;&lt;Just put that energy into packing and planning, and when you see them smile <br/>
really big, and if they&#39;re pissy back, put it in an imaginary jar of proof <br/>
that <br/>
it&#39;s really fine that you&#39;re going.     Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is such a powerful statement to me. Thanks Sandra. The more we smiled <br/>
today, the more pissy they were but it made us (DH, DS and I) realize how much <br/>
they do try and control us and how mean they are being by not speaking with <br/>
Christopher. Needless to say I have more than enough proof that it is time to <br/>
leave and it makes me feel much better.<br/>

<br/>
Thank-you Rhonda for your story and words of encouragement. <br/>
Thank-you everyone that posted to us.<br/>
Rhonda your story struck home with me as I too had a dad I had to put out of <br/>
my life. It took many years to do that about 18 years old. I don&#39;t know if <br/>
he&#39;s alive or still in jail. Even though he abused me and raped me and my sister <br/>
all those years, I still put up with his manipulation in my life. Weird how I <br/>
was strong enough to open my mouth and have him put away and now I fear having <br/>
to do the same &quot;standing up&quot; with the manipulation that goes on now with my <br/>
family, I think you know what I mean. Maybe the fear of loosing another parent <br/>
had set me back. But what I want Christopher to experience and learn brings me <br/>
forward to move on thanks to all of your help. I&#39;m so sorry to hear about <br/>
your situation and your health and I hope that you are doing well now. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Kim, I am so sorry for your pain. Both then and now. I think you just get <br/>
to a point where you decide even though you are willing to accept such <br/>
treatment, you  will not allow it to happen to your own child, in any manner, degree <br/>
or otherwise. My father has never laid a hand on me, yet the damage he <br/>
inflicted on me and more so on my siblings, is almost immeasurable. Because no-one <br/>
can see the damage and so much is internalized, it wasn&#39;t until I was an adult <br/>
with a family of my own, away from my fathers clutches, that I discovered I <br/>
could live without him. Even as a newlywed, we lived down the street. After the <br/>
twins were born, we moved into the house across the street. As my DH started to <br/>
see that all our decisions were being made with my fathers influence, he <br/>
objected. I gave in a little, but just a little! We moved a mile away.LOL A year <br/>
later we moved an hour away. Slowly we broke free and my DH was ever so careful <br/>
about it. I love him for that alone when I sit and think about that. A lesser <br/>
man would probably just said, that&#39;s it, we&#39;re not living this way. <br/>
Ultimately he did say enough was enough, but he truly supported me throughout the whole <br/>
heartbreaking process. <br/>
<br/>
I am glad discussing the manipulation factor helped you. I didn&#39;t know I had <br/>
so much to say about it. Funny how you start talking about one thing and <br/>
arrive to another. But I&#39;m pretty sure the steps you all made today were huge and <br/>
when everyone lays their head down tonite, everyone will contemplate what <br/>
Christopher had to say and the loving way in which he said it. That says so much <br/>
for you as parents and also will require the grandparents to self reflect. I <br/>
think this was a great start on your road to happiness without manipulation. And <br/>
as far as your own mother goes, perhaps her hurtful words today were actually <br/>
more about herself than you. I&#39;m sure your own painful childhood calls her own <br/>
parenting into question, so it&#39;s actually you who has the choice to cut her <br/>
slack or not. Even though she may have the world believe it is in the reverse. <br/>
Ultimately, you know you are a good mom and Christopher justifies that. <br/>
<br/>
Blessings to your family.<br/>
<br/>

No, actually Sandra I hung up on her. I know it probably wasn&#39;t the best <br/>

just was in no mood to listen to her. <br/>

You could say hanging up wasn&#39;t so nice, but if you had stayed on and asked <br/>
why she was so unhappy and abusive, you&#39;re afraid she would have slapped you <br/>
