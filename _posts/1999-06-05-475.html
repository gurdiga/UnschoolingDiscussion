Great!  I love to connect with other adoptive parents and one who unschools<br/>
is even better!  We are working on adopting a little girl age 8, but if she<br/>
does not turn out to be a good match for us we will be looking for another<br/>
little girl in the same age range as you.  If you want to see a picture of<br/>
our hopeful little daughter-to-be, email me at the above address and I&#39;ll<br/>
send you a URL to look her up. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>cool nanci,<br/>
i have been told that girls around here are hard to get. there just arent<br/>
as many. we were almost match with a great little boy but they found<br/>
another home for him. when will you know about this little girl?<br/>
<br/>
what are you planning about schooling. I was thinking it would be easier to<br/>
adopt a 4 yo cus then i wouldnt have to worry about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918593068">Somehow, in the course of reading 180 emails, I managed to miss the fact that <br/>
Andi and Nanci have adopted children, or are trying to adopt.  We have an <br/>
only child, our 10-year old daughter who we adopted at birth and are <br/>
unschooling.  There are more of us out there than you might think.  I once <br/>
joined a list of adopted homeschoolers as only children.  Too bad we <br/>
disbanded due to too many other commitments.  It was fun while it lasted.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, wanted to let Andi and Nanci know there&#39;s one more Amom on the list!<br/>

considering the 4-8 age range and would love ot know how people dealt with<br/>
the school system and homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Judy, that is nice to know.  Tell me again about your situation,<br/>
and who your adoptive kid(s) is/are, if you don&#39;t mind.  Aparents do have<br/>
to deal with some special issues and look at some things from different<br/>
perspectives than bithparents.<br/>
<br/>
I would be more than happy to chat with you privately at the above email<br/>
address or if you want I will privately send you ICQ and AOL IM nicknames<br/>
and/or numbers.<br/>
