<div id="ygrps-yiv-899777086">Hi all!<br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying reading all the discussions and introductions these past <br/>
several days.  It&#39;s been a pleasure to be a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; during all the <br/>
discussions since I joined this e-group.  Tho&#39;t I&#39;d go ahead and let ya know <br/>
a little about myself now.<br/>
I&#39;ve been home-schooling for two years now.  I knew from the time I was <br/>
pregnant with my first child that I did not want to go the ps route.  I <br/>
began schooling my ds in kindergarten.  Meanwhile, my dd chose to sit in on <br/>
his class, as she did not want to miss anything.  My dd was reading at the <br/>
age of three!   That is unschooling at work for ya.  :)  In these past two <br/>
years, I&#39;ve focused more on feeding my son the necessary info.  And he&#39;s <br/>
done well, tho&#39; he hasn&#39;t enjoyed learning as much as his sister has.  I&#39;ve <br/>
unwittingly been unschooling my dd and it&#39;s worked out wonderfully!  My ds <br/>
has been hindered in learning....especially reading, cuz there&#39;s been a lot <br/>
of force-feeding and frustration on both our parts.<br/>
Basically, I&#39;m into unschooling because it&#39;s relaxed, natural and makes the <br/>
most sense to me.  Since I&#39;ve gone the unschooling route (just in the past <br/>
two months), my son has been reading on his own, without struggle and <br/>
frustration.  I am delighted.  :)<br/>
My ds, Josh, is 7 (and a half, as he would add).  My dd, Mackenzie, is going <br/>
to be 5 this Sun.  :)   Josh is very into dinosaurs and enjoys arts and <br/>
crafts.  He&#39;s playing baseball now; but prefers bike racing.  Mackenzie is <br/>
our dancing bear.  :)  She&#39;s a story-teller, enjoys reading and arts and <br/>
crafts.<br/>
We live in SW Ohio.  Have a two-yr.old Rottweiler named Alex (short for <br/>
Alexandra The Great).  She&#39;s the baby of the family (and she knows it).  :)<br/>
I absolutely adore Jesus Christ and try to pattern my life after His.  :)  <br/>
But, I am not into main-stream Christianity.<br/>
As for the cable tv discussion...<br/>
I&#39;m glad we have cable; but we&#39;ve survived without it in the past and could <br/>
do so again.  :)  I love the Discovery channel and I enjoy catching some of <br/>
the old movies that come on.  My hubby is WAY into sports.  I limit the <br/>
amount of time the kids watch.  Reminding them that too much staring at the <br/>
boob-tube will make their brains go numb.<br/>
Guess that&#39;s about it for now.<br/>
Hope you all have a great day!<br/>
Marcy<br/>
<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! Welcome! &nbsp;I loved hearing about your son&#39;s success with reading after you began homeschooling. Yay!<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704920212">That sounds like our family too Holly.  We LOVE football.  Well, at least my <br/>
husband and I do and the kids will eventually (we hope), but only tune in <br/>
occasionally right now...<br/>
