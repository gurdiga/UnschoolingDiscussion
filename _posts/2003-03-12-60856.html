 </span></blockquote>Hi Jodie,<br/>
<br/>
I am completely new to home schooling (won&#39;t be starting till fall because <br/>
I&#39;m letting my 9 year old son finish out the 3rd grade first), but think the <br/>
only way to do it is to get your son to pass a GED (high school equivalency <br/>
test).<br/>
<br/>
By the way, my son has atypical autism -- very high functioning, a 130 IQ -- <br/>
and I&#39;m glad to hear your son is enjoying the homeschooling experience. Mine <br/>
has been battered in school by teachers because he&#39;s a square peg in a round <br/>
hole. They actually want me to put him on neuroleptic drugs to &quot;calm&quot; him <br/>
down. Translation -- in the areas where my son is two or more years ahead of <br/>
grade level, they want him to pretend he&#39;s not bored and use drugs to get him <br/>
to sit still in his seat. He has a full-time aide, mind you, and can easily <br/>
be assigned other work at those moments that fits his interest level more.<br/>
<br/>
Today he was sneezing a lot just before the school bus came and I just <br/>
decided to let him stay home. We ended up going to a small restaurant for <br/>
lunch near a harbor close to home. On the dock, we watched a sea gull in <br/>
clear shallow water (and he watched us). Even now and then he would move his <br/>
webbed feet very fast and disturb all the silt on the bottom of the water. <br/>
Sometimes a tiny sea creature would float up in the swirl of silt and the sea <br/>
gull would get rewarded with lunch. It was absolutely fascinating to watch.  <br/>
My son and I talked about how the sea gull&#39;s luck meant some other creature <br/>
would die. He said, philosophically, &quot;everything dies some time. That&#39;s life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re home now and he&#39;s just watching cartoons. My son is more relaxed today <br/>
than I have seen him in a long time. I can&#39;t wait for him to &quot;graduate&quot; 3rd <br/>
grade in June so he can come home for a real education.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t have to wait.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no &quot;value&quot; in a third grade graduation.<br/>
<br/>
If he thinks he&#39;s having fun and wants to keep going, that&#39;s one thing.  But <br/>
whatever damage you think school is doing to him will continue to be done <br/>
every day he goes to school.<br/>
<br/>
And if you see him home and being relaxed and calm, you could point out to <br/>
him that he could have that tomorrow, and the next day, and the fifteenth of <br/>
April, and the tenth of May...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Hello, Carrie<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your son sounds alot like mine at that age. Exact IQ too. They said <br/>
that he did not fit the keyhole for autism and teachers did not know <br/>
how to keep him from being bored. He now picks what he wants to learn <br/>
and is learning every day. It is glorious to see progress instead of <br/>
so many daily struggles. He finally could not handle the stress of <br/>
school and anxiety attacks got the better of him. This is why we <br/>
started to homeschool. With children who have such high IQs to start <br/>
with, it is amazing what they can find to learn on their own. Good <br/>
luck and I am glad you are homeschooling. Let them be your guide. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you for the reminder. I never want to complete my education as <br/>
well. As long as he can become part of life and never quits learning <br/>
this should be my goal. I should not need a bunch of tests that he is <br/>
going to forget after testing anyway. The things he learns now he <br/>
keeps with him. Thank you again for the support. This is a great <br/>
list. Jodie</div>
