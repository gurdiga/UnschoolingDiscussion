***If she&#39;s not used to a high fiber diet, you&#39;ll want to go easy on this to<br/>
begin with. Suddenly introducing a lot of fiber can cause cramps.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely true!  It is best to gradually introduce fiber and work your way<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
***Someone told me for diarrhea to do the BRAT diet: bananas, rice, apples<br/>
and<br/>
tea so for the opposite problem it seems those should be avoided!<br/>
<br/>
BRAT DIET - A bland diet consisting of ripe Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and<br/>
Toast. This diet is easier for the intestines to digest. This can be helpful<br/>
in cases of gastroenteritis, cramping abdominal pain, and diarrhea.<br/>
Alternatively, there are products (e.g. lactose-free &quot;Ensure&quot;) which may be<br/>
substituted (and more tasty) and still accomplish what a BRAT diet is<br/>
attempting to do.<br/>

<br/>
Mint tea is ok as the mint calms the digestive system but if you give tea<br/>
with caffeine it will stimulate the intestines.  Applesauce constipates,<br/>
apples stimulate.  I wish I could tell you why but I&#39;m not really sure.  I<br/>
could guess that it might be from the pectin they add to applesauce...<br/>
