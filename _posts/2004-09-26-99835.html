<div id="ygrps-yiv-63658944">Yes. My oldest has chosen to return to school. She&#39;s<br/>
not attending just yet becuase of the placement<br/>
process, but she should start sometime in the next<br/>
couple weeks. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s her choice to go. But she knows that she can come<br/>
home at any time.<br/>

There is a new list for just this situation started recently by another<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know how busy it is.<br/>
