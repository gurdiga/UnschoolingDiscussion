 </span></blockquote>Again, Mary, I agree with you.  However, I also think it&#39;s possible to be a<br/>
responsible owner and not use dogfood, which some folks consider a<br/>
consumerism thing.  I think that&#39;s what several people here have been<br/>
getting at.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about feeding your animals responsibly and then periodically acting<br/>
&quot;irresponsible&quot; by giving them table scraps.  It&#39;s more about considering<br/>
how your dog could be fed differently; using leftover people food, food that<br/>
is inedible for people or disagreeable to them as (part of or entirely)<br/>
their pet&#39;s regular diet.<br/>
<br/>
My point about weight was merely to point out an inconsistency in us humans<br/>
-- we&#39;re so worried about doing the right thing for our animals and yet we<br/>
know the right thing ourselves and don&#39;t necessarily do it.  I wonder if<br/>
dogs, given free access to food, would eventually demonstrate what we<br/>
already know children do: self-regulate.  They did in the wild, right?<br/>
<br/>
My dog lives with my Mom these days, though, so I guess I can&#39;t test this<br/>
theory!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We leave food down all the time, for the dog and the cats.  We keep food in <br/>
the bowls.  Food stays in the bowls.   If one gets empty, someone refills it. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have one fattish cat (not REAL fat, she had two litters and kept a belly), <br/>
and two skinny ones.  We have a dog who is NOT fat.  They eat out of each <br/>
other&#39;s bowls sometimes.  The cat-feeing station is  downstairs in a <br/>
bathroom, and the dog&#39;s is upstairs in the kitchen.<br/>

<br/>
Oop, I totally agree with everything you just said. Didn&#39;t want to sound <br/>
like I&#39;m against people who feed their dogs differently than I do. I use to <br/>
actually cook for my Dobie every day. Then again, I only had one child <br/>
too!!! And every now and then, the ones we have now do get a few scraps of <br/>
certain things. Not poptart but leftover steak and stuff, just very small <br/>
amounts. I find it agrees with them better as they are still puppies and I <br/>
still have a hard enough time making sure they get outside when they need <br/>
too. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well I have to agree once again. Kind of like Dr.&#39;s smoking. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I wonder if dogs, given free access to food, would eventually demonstrate <br/>
what we<br/>
already know children do: self-regulate.  They did in the wild, right?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well kind of I think. Dogs in the wild once again weren&#39;t fat so I guess <br/>
they did self regulate, or was it just that they didn&#39;t have access to food <br/>
all the time? Finding food was a hard thing to do then for them. Just like <br/>
wolves now can starve on their own. Also, dogs today are not the dogs from <br/>
the wild. There is great speculation that domestic dogs didn&#39;t even come <br/>
from the wolves and jackals we know of now.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;m ready to take the step to find out on my own <br/>
right now. Maybe when the kids are older and I have more house to myself and <br/>
more yard!!!!!<br/>
