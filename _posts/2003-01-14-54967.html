<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035423643">There was a really interesting article in the NY Times Education Supplement<br/>
this weekend... about the formation of &quot;free schools&quot; in Japan to try to<br/>
assist kids who are floundering in the regular schools.  Lots of great info<br/>
about how, even though Japanese test scores in science and math have always<br/>
been so high, many graduates have a hard time later in the workplace because<br/>
they haven&#39;t learned to think for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The article is here:<br/>

Here is an excerpt:<br/>

Free to Be<br/>
By MIKI TANIKAWA<br/>
<br/>
It was a typical exercise to promote orderly response. The teacher called on<br/>
each student, who was to shout out his name. &#39;&#39;Here! Yuuki Tamori, I am<br/>
fine.&#39;&#39; But Yuuki, 10, was shy.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Why can&#39;t you do it when everybody else is doing it?&#39;&#39; the teacher<br/>
admonished him. He was made to stand beside his desk for the rest of the<br/>
class. Yuuki failed to respond to his name on several more occasions.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;The more the teacher pressed him, the more difficult it was for him to do<br/>
it,&#39;&#39; said his mother, Haruko Tamori. &#39;&#39;I felt a sense of crisis after a<br/>
while because Yuuki was losing self-confidence.&#39;&#39; Mrs. Tamori decided to<br/>
send her son to the Learnnet Global School in Kobe, one of a growing number<br/>
of &#39;&#39;free schools&#39;&#39; that have emerged in reaction to the rigid curriculum,<br/>
group-oriented instruction and large class size (typically 40 students) of<br/>
the Japanese school system.<br/>
<br/>
Like alternative schools in other countries, free schools in Japan range<br/>
broadly in quality and mission, from helping children who have difficulty<br/>
adjusting to regular schools to offering nontraditional approaches to<br/>
education. But unlike in other countries, they are by definition<br/>
unaccredited in Japan. While not enforced, the law requires that children up<br/>
to age 15 attend schools that comply with government stipulations on<br/>
curriculum, facilities and number and qualifications of instructors.<br/>
Strictly speaking, free school attendance is illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, 300 to 500 such schools have opened over the last 10 years,<br/>
fueled by a phenomenon known as toko kyohi, or refusal to go to school.<br/>
Nearly 140,000 children refuse to attend -- one in every classroom in Japan<br/>
and more than double the number a decade ago, according to the Ministry of<br/>
Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. While poor grades and<br/>
boredom often lead to chronic truancy, the reason most often cited is<br/>
bullying, a problem so severe that it has drawn international attention. The<br/>
government is considering accrediting a school in Tokyo designed for toko<br/>
kyohi children, and it has deployed counselors to schools around the<br/>
country. But nothing has stemmed truancy, which is a particular problem in<br/>
junior high.</div>
