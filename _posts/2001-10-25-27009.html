   Funny. My dd wants a small breasted Barbie. I say we&#39;ll look but I haven&#39;t <br/>
found one yet. There are the Real Girl dolls now so maybe for Christmas. It <br/>
cracks me up that she notices how ridiculous Barbie&#39;s body is.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, there are dog bites due to aggression issues, and dog bites due to<br/>
 fear issues. This guy isn&#39;t at all aggressive or vicious - that would be<br/>
 a different story - he&#39;s just gets triggered and bites out of fear, and a<br/>
 second later he remembers where he is and feels quite bad and slinks<br/>
 outside.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    This is scarey to me. As I said I know what dog bites can do. I still <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let my child play w/ a dog who has a tendancy to bite. To me it is a <br/>
game of roulette. JMNSHO<br/>

was afraid poor skipper would grow up to be a serial killer, having those<br/>
huge bosoms flaunted at her all the time.  And what kind of name is that,<br/>
Skipper?  Poor thing. <br/>
