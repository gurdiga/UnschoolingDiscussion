<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054169299">Thank you , Pam for the tip for the book, &#39;Playful parenting&#39;.  I read<br/>
the review out of the Seattle paper and really like, among other things,<br/>
his idea to use instead of time outs (which I&#39;ve never liked and have<br/>
never worked for us anyway)....calling a &#39;meeting on the couch&#39; to<br/>
reconnect sounds like a much better solution.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very much Em&#39;s playmate and confidante.   I spend most days at teddy<br/>
bear tea parties,  building tents on the furniture, going on nature<br/>
walks in the woods and taping our treasures to our &#39;tape&#39; bracelets,<br/>
etc. : )<br/>
<br/>
I was just telling my dh yesterday that it&#39;s interesting to me how much<br/>
younger I feel (47) lately, and I credit it all to hanging out with Em!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Denise</div>
