<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771496048">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is just turned five and I&#39;m trying to find more computer games<br/>
to play with her.  At the moment, all we have, aside from the standard<br/>
solitaire and such is a batch of games called &quot;Potato Guy&quot; on my Linux<br/>
computer.  She loves them, but unfortunately we can only be on that<br/>
computer in the evenings.  During the day we use my laptop, which has an<br/>
older version of Windows.  Potato Guy has backgrounds and things you can<br/>
arrange on the backgrounds.  One is a castle with sort of Robin Hood-ish<br/>
penguins.  Another is a countryside background with a train track, road,<br/>
stream, and hills which can be decorated with buildings, people, and<br/>
vehicles.  And, of course, there are a couple of Mister Potatohead type<br/>
backgrounds.  Can anyone recommend anything in that general vein that<br/>
available either online or for Windows 2000/XP?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-637711084">Hi Sue,<br/>
www.poissonrouge.com is one of the best sites I&#39;ve come across. It&#39;s online so you should be ok with your laptop. When you get to the homepage, just click Play and you can play for free, unlimited. It says &quot;make a donation&quot; but you genuinely don&#39;t have to, only if you want to. Now your daughter can just click on anything in the playroom and explore. There&#39;s so much in there, we have spent hours there.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Jo<br/>
<br/>
