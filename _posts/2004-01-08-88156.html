<div id="ygrps-yiv-70139920">Oh I have been watching this thread and I have to comment here.My <br/>
son is 7 and and he played pop warner last summer and they asked me <br/>
for a report card and expected me to have something from a boxed <br/>
cirriculum. They looked at me funny when I told them I don&#39;t. I <br/>
decided to blow them off because I figure if I make a BIG DEAL and <br/>
provide them with something they will require it for everyone so <br/>
what I did is provide them with my approval letter and that was it.  <br/>
I figure it is none of their business (schools either) and I already <br/>
don&#39;t like that I have to report to the schools anyway. They never <br/>
said a word and never mentioned a thing about it.  <br/>
<br/>
On another note I thought it was way to many hours for my son and I <br/>
felt bad for those poor little guys that had to go to school on top <br/>
of it all. My son ended up deciding that it was not fun for him and <br/>
quit. While he was on the team one of the woman coaches commented <br/>
about another child that he had problems because he was home <br/>
schooled. She ended up getting to know my son because my husband <br/>
coached until the end (even after my son quit). She loved my son <br/>
because he was thoughtful and very respectful as well as one of the <br/>
most polite kids on the team. I think his purpose there was not to <br/>
play football but possibly to teach her or show her another veiw of <br/>
a home schooled boy (unschooled). I would like to also add her kids <br/>
were horrible - sorry but it&#39;s true.  <br/>
<br/>
So I think the less we give these places the better. They did give <br/>
me a stink @ first and said &quot;Oh we have to ask someone about that&quot; I <br/>
ignored them and said here this is what we have because he is so <br/>
young I have assembled my very own cirriculum. Even if he wasn&#39;t <br/>
young I would of siad the same thing !!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck !!<br/>

My son played Pop Warner flag football when he was five.  I couldn&#39;t imagine <br/>
how the other 5yo&#39;s could handle all those hours of practice and still go to <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
My son quit.  The coaches were quite mean and not at all respectful of the <br/>
children.  I think they thought they were coaching the pros!  They would make <br/>
the kids run laps when they lost a game, and they were always hollering at them <br/>
:(  The cheerleaders were treated better though...I think the woman had a <br/>
little more compassion for the children.<br/>
