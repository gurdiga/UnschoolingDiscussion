<div id="ygrps-yiv-237572208">I was looking for the explanations that were around in the 70&#39;s.  It  seemed <br/>
commonly said in those days that cold drinks were unnatural (and even  then <br/>
they were more common in the U.S. than in many other places and so they  were <br/>
looking for what was our health problem, and that was one of the accused  <br/>
factors).   It would keep other foods from digesting right if you  drank a really <br/>
cold drink (and some people said if you drank ANY drink it kept  the food from <br/>
digesting well, and that probably makes some sense, if the stomach  contents <br/>
are too diluted).  <br/>
 <br/>
But as to why cold would keep you awake while warm foods wouldn&#39;t, I found  <br/>
this, on an australian dietary rant site probably not worth linking up  <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
*****************<br/>
Too many icy cold drinks, beer, ice-cream, smoothies, cold salads etc, all  <br/>
impair the digestion.<br/>
What we have to remember is, that the digestion relies  on a chemical process <br/>
of a reaction-taking place to digest our food.<br/>
Our body  runs on 37degrees Celsius and therefore for any process in our body <br/>
to take  place it requires this temperature to run at optimum efficiency.<br/>
Therefore  put a cold piece of fruit straight out of the refrigerator at 5 <br/>
degrees Celsius  into the stomach. This cold piece of food then lowers the temp <br/>
in the stomach.  The stomach then has to try and bring this cold substance up <br/>
to 37 degrees for  digestion to take place. This requires more acid, which in <br/>
turn requires more  mucus to be made to protect the stomach lining. It also <br/>
requires alot more  energy.<br/>
More acid, more mucus and we get fluid build up and bloating taking  place <br/>
and a lot of energy being taken for this one piece of fruit. Do this over  a <br/>
lifetime and you are literally using up most of your energy just to digest  your <br/>
food. Also the digestion is impaired from all the extra work it has to  do.<br/>
****************<br/>
 <br/>
So your body has to wake up and work hard (your heart will beat faster,  <br/>
which isn&#39;t good for sleeping) if you&#39;re trying to warm up your  insides.   In the <br/>
middle of a hot day, it can be GREAT (feeling  anyway, maybe not for <br/>
digestion) to get that rush of alertness.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe if we all drank room -temperature beer and soda as a lot of  Europe <br/>
does, we&#39;d be not so unhealthy.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe not.<br/>
 <br/>
But for sleeping, drinking something your own body temperature or higher  <br/>
(not hot coffee &lt;g&gt;) would maybe lower your heartbeat.     Other things will <br/>
lower heartbeat too, though--meditation/prayer/yoga, peaceful  music, reading, <br/>
rocking a baby to sleep...<br/>

straight scotch, no rocks!<br/>
