<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075494280">Hi Tia,<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to get an answer to your question from some rat people more<br/>
knowledgeable then I am.  So far, no response.  I would contact your<br/>
local health department with concern about your pet rodents.  How is the<br/>
disease passed?  My initial feeling would be that if they  are kept<br/>
inside and caged, pet rats or mice (and other rodents) should be OK.<br/>

P.S.  You might not want to mention &quot;pet rats&quot; specifically to the health<br/>
department.  Many people are so prejudiced against rats they will<br/>
automatically say  &quot;oooh, yuck&quot; with out giving any thought to the<br/>
problem.  Ironically, mice, gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs are<br/>
perfectly acceptable.  A shame, since they all of them, (with the<br/>
exception of g.p.&#39;s), bite far more often then rats and are not nearly as<br/>
smart or lovable toward their human owners.</div>
