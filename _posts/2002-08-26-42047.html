<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847043490">Here in Arkansaw, (notice the drawl.....) there is a pumpkin farm that is a favorite field trip for schools, homeschool groups, and families.  They have rows of pumpkins to walk through and pick your own, a few farm animals, a short hayride around the field, and a sorghum mill demonstration.  They show you how the juice is extracted, show where/how they boiled the juice, and then even let you get a taste of it.  We&#39;ve gone about 4 years and it is still really fun for the kids.  This is a website I found giving you just a little info about sorghum.<br/>

<br/>
Is sorghum really molasses?<br/>
<br/>
No. Molasses is a by-product of sugar cane, whereas sorghum is the syrup produced when the extracted juice from the sorghum cane is boiled down. &quot;Sorghum Molasses&quot; is a colloquial term that probably started years ago as a lot of the syrup made on open pans turned out quite dark and strong, resembling Blackstrap Molasses in appearance and in taste. Thus, the term &quot;Sorghum Molasses&quot; came to be a part of our language.<br/>
<br/>
So what exactly is sorghum? <br/>
Sorghum is made from 100 percent pure, natural juice extracted from sorghum cane. The juice is cleansed of impurities and concentrated by evaporation in open pans into a clear, amber colored, mild flavored syrup. The syrup retains all of its natural sugars and other nutrients. It is 100 percent natural.<br/>
<br/>
Sorghum is one of the oldest natural sweeteners known. It was the &quot;principal sweetenin&quot; used by our ancestors as America was being settled. The sorghum cooking pan traveled westward with the settlers. It, thus, became a part of America&#39;s heritage. Besides being the energy food of the settlers, sorghum made their food more tasty and nutritious. Sorghum contains such hard-to-find nutrients as calcium, iron, potassium and phosphorous.<br/>
<br/>
The settlers found many ways to use sorghum-sweetening drinks, making confections, flavoring meats - but its most popular usage was in baking. It was used in place of sugar in making pies, breads, puddings and countless cakes and cookies<br/>
