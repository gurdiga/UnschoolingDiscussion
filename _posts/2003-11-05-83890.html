<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171248305">Hi Amy,<br/>
I also had doubts in the beginning.If I could do it all over again I <br/>
would just be with my son and NOT concentrate on school so much but <br/>
bonding and connecting instead. We get dissconnected from our kids <br/>
when they are in school.I think once you get the connection the fun <br/>
begins and the journey happens - natrually. Naturally is the <br/>
keyword - I was trying to do school things when I first got my son <br/>
home out of fear. This is my second year and it&#39;s more relaxing <br/>
because we just live and have fun.  I would describe it as a way of <br/>
life.  I still tell the school oh yeah he is reading and doing math <br/>
just to shut them up - but in our home and in my heart I know <br/>
everything will happen all natrually :) I let my son guide and <br/>
direct me I listen to him carefully for what he desires to know <br/>
about.  That is what I&#39;m doing for myself now as an adult and what a <br/>
gift it is  to be able to do it as a child with the help of your <br/>
parents.  I have let go of all my fears of the video game thing - I <br/>
never wanted to buy one for fear that he would play all day and not <br/>
learn. Well guess what he plays all day and still learns.  I thought <br/>
how will he learn how to read and I find that he is asking &quot;what <br/>
does this say - and that ??&quot;  The wheels are turning for him because <br/>
it is something he wants.  He does math in his own way and we play <br/>
lots of games.  You have fun and your together but theres great <br/>
learning involved in it. That is the beauty of being home you have <br/>
time to do what you love and why shouldn&#39;t you.He does what he loves <br/>
and I do what I love and then we do what we love to do together :) <br/>
Theres many lessons to be learned in life - everything is a learning <br/>
exsperience.  Everything - moving to a new home and remodeling which <br/>
is what we did our first year of home school LOL... Your son might <br/>
be feeding on your fear ... I don&#39;t know but I think my son use to <br/>
feel mine.  Now I see he is more relaxed now that I am.  He also <br/>
sees me explain my philosopy to other people. I also tell him not to <br/>
worry about others and what they think because you have to do whats <br/>
right for yourself. They do not live our life and we don&#39;t owe them <br/>
ANY explanations.<br/>
Your doing the right thing Amy. Love, Live and learn and be happy.<br/>
Connect and know that everything works out - natrually :)<br/>

Why are you dealing with a school?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d try to get away from that if you can.<br/>
