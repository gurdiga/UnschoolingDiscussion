<div id="ygrps-yiv-879266046">Hi...<br/>
<br/>
I too thought about buying this product, but ended up not doing it. Both my kids (3 and 6) love it in the kitchen. Since they WANT to be involved, I would still consider it ok from an unschooling perspective. My 6 yo loves to make gravy, make the lunch, and she also likes to get herbs etc that the 3 yo can&#39;t really get. My 3 yo &#39;started climbing on a chair at 12 months to help. She was in the wrap a lot while I was cooking... maybe it was a natural transition? But anyway, it just started by her picking up food scraps and eating them, or putting them in the bucket for the recycle bin. They she started getting the cups, and the spoons etc for me. She now likes to peel spuds, and carrots, and put them in the saucepan to cook. She also likes to help wash the dishes. at about 14 months, it was more playing but now sometimes she can actually &quot;wash&quot; the small items.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s grtime that your dd wants to be involved... I would just go with it and see where it leads.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me, I&#39;m not a huge fan of buying toys and things to do what can be done with what I have. <br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

Summary: the Learning Tower is (an expensive, IMO -- $200) product designed<br/>
and marketed with a lot of savvy Montessori-type language --<br/>
<br/>
[Quote]<br/>
<br/>
   - Fosters a positive self-image and a sense of independence in small<br/>
   children as they climb up and down without assistance<br/>
   - Welcomes the child as a helping participant alongside parents and<br/>
   siblings<br/>
   - Nurtures a child�s innate desire to be independent and inquisitive<br/>
<br/>
[/Unquote]<br/>
<br/>
My youngest is 13 months old -- I want to start involving her more in the<br/>
kitchen and give her access to things she can&#39;t get to -- countertops, sink,<br/>
etc.  She LOVES climbing already, and I have to really watch her, because<br/>
everything in her world has become a step-stool (trucks, balls, books,<br/>
stuffed animals, boxes).  I think she&#39;d like climbing on this... I got the<br/>
link to the product from a Montessori site, and, although I&#39;m not any kind<br/>
of Montessori purist, I do get a real kick out of a lot of the ideas, and I<br/>
guess I aspire to involve the kids more.  When I saw this item, I got really<br/>
excited -- it seems to accommodate kids from early toddlerhood clear up to<br/>
age 6 or so, and from reviews I&#39;ve read, it can hold two little ones at<br/>
once.  I&#39;m due with my second child in about a month, and I was thinking<br/>
this *tower* could give both my littlest ones some early independence and<br/>
access that they might not otherwise have.  But I am also a real sucker for<br/>
Montessori stuff, so I have to watch myself or I&#39;d have a house full of<br/>
well-marketed *items* like this.<br/>
<br/>
I am probably over-eager to have my kids be involved with me in things.  I<br/>
love having my daughter in the kitchen with me when I&#39;m working -- cooking,<br/>
prepping, cleaning, whatever -- right now she stands at my legs and hangs<br/>
on, looking up and wanting to be part of it all, and she doesn&#39;t do the wrap<br/>
or carrier thing (not that I could hold her like that right now, with my<br/>
pregnant belly).  She gets frustrated, and quickly bored with things I give<br/>
her to do on the floor -- measuring cups, spoons, pitchers.<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective:  am I jumping the gun on expecting my<br/>
babies to be part of activities in the kitchen?  My justification is that<br/>
I&#39;m in the kitchen a lot -- my little girl WANTS to be with me, and<br/>
currently gets frustrated by all the stuff I&#39;m doing up high that she can&#39;t<br/>
be a part of.  Am I trying to justify the purchase of a product that is<br/>
unnecessary?  (would step-stools work almost as well?)  The product<br/>
marketing proclaims that this is better than a step-stool, because it&#39;s<br/>
safer, and it can also double as a little kind of jungle-gym, play-house,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one more of my justifications before I turn it over to you all for<br/>
advice:  my 9-year-old step-son, who is along with me on the deschooling<br/>
journey at the moment (he&#39;s been traditionally home-schooled forever, and we<br/>
started deschooling about four or five months ago), also LOVES being in the<br/>
kitchen and wants to help all the time with cooking and such.  My<br/>
13-month-old wants to be in there with us, too, but she demands all the<br/>
attention because she gets frustrated.  I think if I could have something<br/>
like this to get her involved in a project up at our level, she would be<br/>
easier to handle, and she and her big brother could even work together --<br/>
which would be fun for him AND for her, because they really love each<br/>
other.  These days, he and I kind of wait until she&#39;s down for a nap before<br/>
we try to work together on a kitchen project, but then we have to be all<br/>
quiet and everything, which is no fun.<br/>
<br/>
This kitchen stuff has been a real de-schooling -- and scary -- area for me,<br/>
because I grew up in a strict, perfect, clean house where my mother was the<br/>
Kitchen Master, and I was not allowed in, because I was messy and too eager<br/>
and too slow and... you get the idea.  I don&#39;t want that in my house.  I am<br/>
still very intimidated in the kitchen, and just starting to overcome it,<br/>
because my mom&#39;s voice is always whispering over my shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t spill,<br/>
don&#39;t cut yourself, don&#39;t drip...&quot; etc.  I don&#39;t want to spend the next few<br/>
years keeping my daughter and her little brother/sister (don&#39;t know the<br/>
gender yet) trapped behind the gate, using my mom&#39;s same pattern of keeping<br/>
them out because it&#39;s inconvenient or frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my expense justification:  $200 divided by two children = $100,<br/>
divided by 5 years of use = $20/year/child for a potentially cool item that<br/>
could enhance our relationships and our kitchen activities.  And if you add<br/>
in the extra bonus of my step-son getting to interact with his little<br/>
siblings in the kitchen, well, that makes it even more affordable...right?<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?  Ideas?  People who have used this or know of it?  Am I a sucker<br/>
for a cool-looking product?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Deb<br/>

<br/>
I guess that&#39;s it, yes.  I really don&#39;t trust myself -- I&#39;m trying to make<br/>
sure I&#39;m not *pushing* or forcing my ideal image of our learning life onto<br/>
the kids, especially not too soon.  :)  I am finding with my daughter that I<br/>
am *EAGER* to do everything NOW.  :)  She&#39;s, you know, just learned to walk,<br/>
and here I&#39;m envisioning her standing next to me at the counter, cutting up<br/>
bananas with a plastic knife and splashing her hands in the sink.  :)  I&#39;m<br/>
still judging my every parenting move -- from as many angles as possible.<br/>
Am I doing it for &quot;me&quot;?  Is it for &quot;them&quot;?  Is it for &quot;us&quot;?  How could this<br/>
backfire?  (Oh, negative thoughts, go away!!  haha)<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m glad to hear that you have seen one in use and it looked like a cool<br/>
thing.  Thing is, a few months ago, I was gaga over this cool Melissa & Doug<br/>
all-wooden kitchen set-up (you know, with the fridge, and stove and<br/>
microwave, etc.), and I was trying to justify its purchase the same way.  We<br/>
finally decided to hold off -- wait til the kids are a bit bigger before<br/>
making such a purchase.<br/>
<br/>
But seeing this Learning Tower, I&#39;ve about decided not to bother with the<br/>
kiddie kitchen thing -- why not spend the money on the tower, and have a<br/>
cool, open-ended tool that actually encourages us working together in the<br/>
big kitchen -- not just me doing my *real* stuff, and them doing their<br/>
*fake* stuff off in the corner?  We are fortunate to have a big kitchen that<br/>
will accommodate this thing -- and as I see it, it could end up being a fun<br/>
climbing deal for years, inside or outside.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m leaning toward doing it.  It&#39;s cool.  I want it.  For us?  Yes, I think<br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In fact if you attached two matching tables together, one upside down  <br/>
on top of the other and screwed some horizontal boards to the legs  <br/>
sticking up, you&#39;d have basically the same idea.<br/>
<br/>
A chair with arms would work nearly as well, turned to face the  <br/>
counter. It depends how body aware she is. A step stool would have  <br/>
world for Kathryn since she&#39;s always had this great body awareness.  <br/>
Not cautious. Just knows where she is and where things are and how to  <br/>
move. But every kid is different in how aware they are.<br/>
<br/>
You could also get a low table and do more prep work sitting down at  <br/>
their level.<br/>
<br/>
But if you can afford it, it looks pretty cool.<br/>

========================<br/>
<br/>
We have the Learning Tower at our house.  I actually acquired it from a neighbor who was going to donate it to Goodwill anyway, so she gave it to us for free - awesome deal!  <br/>
<br/>
I have two kids aged 4 and almost 2.  Before we got the Learning Tower, multiple times each day they were pushing dining room chairs into the kitchen to climb up onto so they could reach the countertop and sink and shelves and whatever else is up high in the kitchen.  I like the tower better because they can both fit in it and I don&#39;t worry about them falling off as much.  Our chairs don&#39;t have arms, and it was altogether too easy for them to bump each other off the chair.  Also, my younger one has more than once managed to &quot;bump&quot; himself off a chair even when he&#39;s the only one on it.<br/>
<br/>
Even if your daughter is too young to really help or be interested in helping with kitchen tasks, we find the tower is really great for water play in the sink.  I can cook a whole meal while my son plays with measuring cups and spoons and whatever else with a small stream of running water in the sink.  As far as &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; it sounds like your daughter could start using it right away already, so I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s a real concern.  Also, I think it&#39;s pretty much a guarantee that toddlers will want to climb up on things and play with water and food and be up where adults are. &lt;G&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I totally understand not wanting to splurge for such an expensive thing.  I don&#39;t think we would have ever gotten one if I hadn&#39;t lucked into getting it for free.  I guess that part of it is up to you.  Now that we have it, I love it.  The only con is that it does take up a lot of space in our kitchen, but if you have a big kitchen that shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  If you can afford it, go for it.</div>

<br/>
If I had a big kitchen with a cool island like in the picture on the website, then perhaps such a thing would be useful.  There was a high chair that I really wanted when Margaux was little, that converted to a table and chair.  I never did get it.  It turned out that the high chair that someone gave us, she rarely wanted to sit in anyway.<br/>
<br/>
We have a corner bench and table with 2 extra chairs in our kitchen.  That seems to be the preferred location for all kitchen help and doings! <br/>

A couple of nice things about the learning tower is that you can move it around while they are in it, while they hold on to the rails. And two small kids can get inside it together. It&#39;s not just for the kitchen, it&#39;s also just fun to climb on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429002622">We purchased one when my now 8 year old was almost 2 I believe.  The reason being that he always wanted to be up at the counter helping (we have no kitchen table in the kitchen), and my husband had actually built a very sturdy large step stool for him that he fell off of like 3 times and hurt himself.   I saw the Learning Tower, with the sides to prevent falls and immediately knew it was for us. <br/>
 <br/>
Even though we have a very small kitchen and it was rather cumbersome, it was worth it for us.  He used it every day.  When my now 4 year old came along he used it as well lots and actually they both used it together for a time (they both fit, being 2 & 5 at the time).  They did occasionally use it for other uses as well.<br/>
<br/>
It was pricey, but is rock solid and was in excellent condition after 5 years of constant use and I sold it 3 months ago for $80.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577754775">I also have a Learning Tower. We bought it when my daughter was 18 months old. She used it a lot to play at the sink. We didn&#39;t have stools or chairs that were sturdy enough for her at the time. The sides really kept her from falling, especially when the floor of the Learning Tower would get wet and slippery from her water play (when she was young I would also put a towel under her feet to absorb some of the water and keep her from slipping.) Our problem was that our kitchen is small and it really didn&#39;t fit well and it is heavy to move from a different room for storage. One thing to know is that although they are very sturdy and I have no doubt that an older version on Craigslist or Ebay would still be in excellent condition, the older versions do not collapse for storage, whereas the newer versions do collapse for storage. In fact, just today, my husband took ours apart to store in the garage until our second baby is about 15 months old and will start using it again. My daughter is now 4 and most of her kitchen help occurs while seated at the kitchen table. Looking back on it, most, if not all, of her kitchen help could have occurred there except for helping with dishes or water play at the sink. And now that she is older, we use a chair with arm sides and that is sturdy and safe enough now for using the sink. In a nutshell, if you have the space and can afford it, you will use it. I also think it would be very handy if you have two children who want to help at once. It is big enough to accommodate that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059089881">I have one of these and it has been very useful. When my daughter got too big to sit at the kitchen counter in one of those portable high chairs that actually attach to the counter (she kicked away really hard one time and made the apparatus and herself crash to the floor, so that was the end of that)we put the learning tower in it&#39;s place and it is her favorite place to eat in the kitchen. She never liked to sit or kneel in a regular chair at the dining table, since it was never the right height to eat comfortably. But the tower is nice because when standing she was the right height to eat or play at the counter, and the height is adjustable of course. She learned to climb up into it early so she&#39;s very independent in that regard, and she pushes it to other locations on occasion. Sometimes the kids throw a blanket over it and make it like a cave. My daughter often balances her feet on various parts of it, trying out her physical skills and balance, it is very sturdy and not dangerous for her to experiment in this way. The retail price was really too expensive for us, but we were lucky enough to find one on Craigslist for a LOT less. You might do some looking around for a used one before you part with the $200. <br/>

&gt; Hi all.  I wondered if anyone had seen this product, or if anyone has used<br/>
&gt; it, as I&#39;m considering purchasing it in the near future (say, next six<br/>
&gt; months, possibly sooner) to have in our kitchen to help my littlest ones be<br/>
&gt; involved in all that we do in there.  Hope this isn&#39;t too far off the topic<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Summary: the Learning Tower is (an expensive, IMO -- $200) product designed<br/>
&gt; and marketed with a lot of savvy Montessori-type language --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [Quote]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    - Fosters a positive self-image and a sense of independence in small<br/>
&gt;    children as they climb up and down without assistance<br/>
&gt;    - Welcomes the child as a helping participant alongside parents and<br/>
&gt;    siblings<br/>
&gt;    - Nurtures a childï¿½s innate desire to be independent and inquisitive<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [/Unquote]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My youngest is 13 months old -- I want to start involving her more in the<br/>
&gt; kitchen and give her access to things she can&#39;t get to -- countertops, sink,<br/>
&gt; etc.  She LOVES climbing already, and I have to really watch her, because<br/>
&gt; everything in her world has become a step-stool (trucks, balls, books,<br/>
&gt; stuffed animals, boxes).  I think she&#39;d like climbing on this... I got the<br/>
&gt; link to the product from a Montessori site, and, although I&#39;m not any kind<br/>
&gt; of Montessori purist, I do get a real kick out of a lot of the ideas, and I<br/>
&gt; guess I aspire to involve the kids more.  When I saw this item, I got really<br/>
&gt; excited -- it seems to accommodate kids from early toddlerhood clear up to<br/>
&gt; age 6 or so, and from reviews I&#39;ve read, it can hold two little ones at<br/>
&gt; once.  I&#39;m due with my second child in about a month, and I was thinking<br/>
&gt; this *tower* could give both my littlest ones some early independence and<br/>
&gt; access that they might not otherwise have.  But I am also a real sucker for<br/>
&gt; Montessori stuff, so I have to watch myself or I&#39;d have a house full of<br/>
&gt; well-marketed *items* like this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am probably over-eager to have my kids be involved with me in things.  I<br/>
&gt; love having my daughter in the kitchen with me when I&#39;m working -- cooking,<br/>
&gt; prepping, cleaning, whatever -- right now she stands at my legs and hangs<br/>
&gt; on, looking up and wanting to be part of it all, and she doesn&#39;t do the wrap<br/>
&gt; or carrier thing (not that I could hold her like that right now, with my<br/>
&gt; pregnant belly).  She gets frustrated, and quickly bored with things I give<br/>
&gt; her to do on the floor -- measuring cups, spoons, pitchers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From an unschooling perspective:  am I jumping the gun on expecting my<br/>
&gt; babies to be part of activities in the kitchen?  My justification is that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m in the kitchen a lot -- my little girl WANTS to be with me, and<br/>
&gt; currently gets frustrated by all the stuff I&#39;m doing up high that she can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be a part of.  Am I trying to justify the purchase of a product that is<br/>
&gt; unnecessary?  (would step-stools work almost as well?)  The product<br/>
&gt; marketing proclaims that this is better than a step-stool, because it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; safer, and it can also double as a little kind of jungle-gym, play-house,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s one more of my justifications before I turn it over to you all for<br/>
&gt; advice:  my 9-year-old step-son, who is along with me on the deschooling<br/>
&gt; journey at the moment (he&#39;s been traditionally home-schooled forever, and we<br/>
&gt; started deschooling about four or five months ago), also LOVES being in the<br/>
&gt; kitchen and wants to help all the time with cooking and such.  My<br/>
&gt; 13-month-old wants to be in there with us, too, but she demands all the<br/>
&gt; attention because she gets frustrated.  I think if I could have something<br/>
&gt; like this to get her involved in a project up at our level, she would be<br/>
&gt; easier to handle, and she and her big brother could even work together --<br/>
&gt; which would be fun for him AND for her, because they really love each<br/>
&gt; other.  These days, he and I kind of wait until she&#39;s down for a nap before<br/>
&gt; we try to work together on a kitchen project, but then we have to be all<br/>
&gt; quiet and everything, which is no fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This kitchen stuff has been a real de-schooling -- and scary -- area for me,<br/>
&gt; because I grew up in a strict, perfect, clean house where my mother was the<br/>
&gt; Kitchen Master, and I was not allowed in, because I was messy and too eager<br/>
&gt; and too slow and... you get the idea.  I don&#39;t want that in my house.  I am<br/>
&gt; still very intimidated in the kitchen, and just starting to overcome it,<br/>
&gt; because my mom&#39;s voice is always whispering over my shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t spill,<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t cut yourself, don&#39;t drip...&quot; etc.  I don&#39;t want to spend the next few<br/>
&gt; years keeping my daughter and her little brother/sister (don&#39;t know the<br/>
&gt; gender yet) trapped behind the gate, using my mom&#39;s same pattern of keeping<br/>
&gt; them out because it&#39;s inconvenient or frustrating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my expense justification:  $200 divided by two children = $100,<br/>
&gt; divided by 5 years of use = $20/year/child for a potentially cool item that<br/>
&gt; could enhance our relationships and our kitchen activities.  And if you add<br/>
&gt; in the extra bonus of my step-son getting to interact with his little<br/>
&gt; siblings in the kitchen, well, that makes it even more affordable...right?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts?  Ideas?  People who have used this or know of it?  Am I a sucker<br/>
&gt; for a cool-looking product?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Deb<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As long as you are aware of these issues you should avoid the trap of blaming your daughter for wasting the money spent on it if she doesn&#39;t take to it and chooses instead to drag chairs and stools around the kitchen (or play elsewhere). I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong in buying it hoping it will facilitate all sorts of fun in the kitchen as long as you can let it go if it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
One practical question I would ask is how easy it is for a child to move around. Seeing the connection to Montessori makes me wonder, probably unfairly, if it is very heavy so that the children will only be able to access where you want them to. My own children (aged 7 and 5 now) would probably have found it a hindrance to independance if they couldn&#39;t move it around themselves, as they can with stools.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724136306">When we use it in the kitchen (as opposed to bringing it to the den for a<br/>
puppet show) it can cause stress because it really takes up too much space.<br/>

fighting will happen.  Then they have to move it for going from the counter<br/>

cumbersome.  sometimes there have been fingers smashed between the tower and<br/>
the counter also.  For us, it&#39;s just easier (and as safe in my experience)<br/>
to get those little step stools and let them climb on those.  They are<br/>
certainly cheaper!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good question, given my interest in Montessori and independence.<br/>
Still, we make a lot of choices that don&#39;t go right along a Montessori<br/>
approach (for instance, she sleeps in a crib, we put up gates) -- and I<br/>
think the freedom and involvement and opportunity this would give her at<br/>
such a young age would outweigh the problem of being *stuck* in a particular<br/>
area of the kitchen.  Her current spot in the kitchen is not really all that<br/>
satisfactory to me or to her -- on the floor, looking up, missing out on<br/>
things.  She&#39;s not capable yet of moving stools and chairs around to get<br/>
where she wants to be.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I come back to the safety problem with stools and chairs -- I try not<br/>
to be too overprotective, but I can see her really hurting herself dragging<br/>
certain items of furniture around, at least at this age.  I think she would<br/>
more likely topple them over on herself right now.  I like the fact that<br/>
this product would allow her to be with me, doing stuff, NOW, rather than<br/>
having to wait until she&#39;s 3 or 4 and more steady on a chair or stool, or<br/>
able to drag it where she needed it.  She may do that anyway when she&#39;s<br/>
older, which is fine, and we&#39;ll just cross that bridge when we come to it.<br/>
I like the fact that we could have two little ones on it at once, and I want<br/>
to maximize that time by having it now rather than waiting until she can<br/>
handle moving stools and such herself.  Plus, in a way, when she&#39;s so little<br/>
and can&#39;t move it, it wouldn&#39;t be much different than the permanent fixtures<br/>
in the house like the counter tops, or a couch, or the piano.  Would it?  I<br/>
liked the comment that one poster made about it giving her kiddo some<br/>
experience climbing and learning to experiment with clambering up and down a<br/>
fairly secure piece of furniture -- my hunch is that my Josephine will love<br/>
that part of it, and she will build lots of good climbing skills.  I might<br/>
also guess that she&#39;ll transfer her climbing skills to other types of<br/>
furniture in the house, and that&#39;s okay.  She&#39;ll get lots of experimentation<br/>
with what works and what doesn&#39;t, and we&#39;re here to help her if she<br/>
struggles.<br/>
<br/>
Our kitchen setup is such that we don&#39;t have an eating area in there -- we<br/>
have a separate dining room where we have our meals, so we don&#39;t have a<br/>
table in our kitchen where we do prep.  I do everything at the counter tops<br/>
and sink, and we use our dining room table for meals.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I had is that we have a farm/market garden business, and,<br/>
depending on how easy it is for us to move this thing around, we could also<br/>
set it up in the greenhouse sometimes and she could help us, play around in<br/>
dirt on the tables, or work with her own plants and things.  How cool would<br/>
THAT be?<br/>
<br/>
I know there may be ways to approximate the design, but I really think for<br/>
my time and money (especially if I can find one used or a little cheaper on<br/>
eBay or something), it sounds like it will be worth it.  If we get four or<br/>
five good years out of it, I&#39;ll be happy.  And if it ends up being one of<br/>
those duds that just doesn&#39;t go over -- well, we&#39;ll shrug and sell it on<br/>
eBay.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the thoughts provoked here and discussed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-629716220">I just wanted to say that we have a Learning Tower.  We got it when my son was 17 months.  We had a small kitchen at the time, but it was VERY worth it.  There isn&#39;t a day since then that it hasn&#39;t been used (he&#39;s 3.5 now).  It&#39;s spacious enough for two kids and VERY sturdy.  We have a larger kitchen now and we do move it around, but mostly I move it to where he wants it, as we added pads to the bottom to help level it on our uneven floor and they make it harder to slide.  Also, I wrote to the maker, Little Partners, and found out that the extra support pieces at the bottom are optional and it meets all safety standards with out them.  I can try to find the email if anyone is interested.  The supports didn&#39;t fit in my old kitchen.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I wanted to add that my brother has the Kitchen Helper, which is lighter weight and foldable.  It&#39;s slightly smaller, and better for their tiny kitchen.  However, the LT is rated for kids 18 mos and up, while the KH is only rated for kids 3years and up.  And the LT is rated for 2 kids, and while the KH can fit two kids snugly, it is only rated for one safely.   They are both very nice, and the KH is easier for the child to move around the room, being that it is lightly weight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, we got ours for $50 on Craigslist a few years ago.  A foldable model would be nice unless you have a huge kitchen or space to store it on the side. The support parts stick out at the bottom making a bit of a stubbed toe hazard.<br/>
<br/>
Ours doesn&#39;t get used every day, but Quinn often asks me to pull it up to the kitchen counter rather than using a step stool.  It&#39;s a larger platform and sturdier for sure.  Two small children can use it at once.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides using it to be elevated, Quinn uses her tower as a fort, playhouse, or puppet theater for herself or her toys either in it or under it with silks or blankets on top. When she was younger, she and a friend would squeeze underneath.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697284925">I totally am coming in late to the conversation about the Learning Tower, but I wanted to say: of all the pricey gadgets we bought as first-time parents, this one is the #1 awesomest.  We got it when our daughter was about 18 months old I think.  Now she&#39;s 6, and we have a son who&#39;s 4.  They still use it every day.<br/>
 <br/>
Both kids learned early on how to shove it around, and we just helped them with it when they were too little to move it much. Having the sides on it really matters, at least for my kids.  And its size and permanance give them their own place in the kitchen, so to speak, making them feel welcome whether they want to help or just hang out while we&#39;re in there.  They aren&#39;t underfoot.  Mind you, our kitchen is small so the Tower is always blocking one cupboard or another, but that&#39;s true whether the kids are in it or not.  After 4.5 years of shoving it around to get to stuff, we just got used to it. ;)  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, wanted to throw out there that we love ours and have no regrets about getting it.  For me, a regular folding stool isn&#39;t the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861753948">I&#39;m a little late, but I&#39;ll second what others have said:  my kids love theirs.  As they&#39;ve gotten older, a pulled-over kitchen chair can serve the same purpose as the tower, but they both still prefer the tower (maybe a sense of security, from the 4 sides, and extra stability?).  Can&#39;t remember how much we paid for it, but we&#39;ve had it for at least 4 years, and both my girls (including my big 6yo) love it, and it still accommodates both of them.<br/>
