Why would that work?  Unless you&#39;re running a school and charging other <br/>
people money to teach their kids, there&#39;s no business expense to deduct from. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Parents don&#39;t claim school clothes and school supplies when their kids go to <br/>
school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t do it as a home-based business because you aren&#39;t charging tuition <br/>
so there is nothing to deduct the expenses from (they&#39;d only be deductible <br/>
from the earnings of the business, not from your other income).<br/>
<br/>
But there is something new - something proposed as tax credits - I haven&#39;t <br/>
had time to read it carefully and don&#39;t know where it is in the bill-passing <br/>
process, if anywhere, but it would allow tax credits for some homeschoolers, <br/>
if passed.<br/>
<br/>
H. R. 257<br/>
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a credit against the <br/>
income tax for educational expenses incurred in attending public or private <br/>
(including religious) elementary and secondary schools and in homeschooling. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Also - one state - I think it is Minnesota - allows you to deduct the taxes <br/>
you paid on educational materials from your state taxes. You have to have <br/>
receipts. It isn&#39;t for homeschoolers - it is for all parents.<br/>
