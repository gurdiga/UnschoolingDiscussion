<h4>The Bullock Family  by way of Helen Hege</h4>
<time>21 Jul 2001, at  7:07pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881376745">Are you an Overweight Homeschool Mom?  Have you decided that it is time to<br/>
put a stop to those pounds that keep creeping up on you each year through<br/>
sedentary living?<br/>
<br/>
All of us at Overweight Homeschool Moms are at the same point in our lives.<br/>
We&#39;ve come together to seek support in our daily struggle with exercise,<br/>
healthy eating & just an overall healthy being.  Basically, we are a<br/>
Christian (primarily) group of homeschool moms that have banded together to<br/>
fight fat & the diseases that come with being over our healthy weight!<br/>
<br/>
Each of us knows what can happen to our families when we don&#39;t take care of<br/>
them.  Imagine what happens to them when we don&#39;t take care of ourselves!<br/>
<br/>
So grab a glass of water, hook up to your pc & let&#39;s start encouraging each<br/>
other on our daily walk to a longer, fuller, more enriching life!<br/>
