Embrace Your Eccentricity<br/>
<br/>
A serious study in eccentricity, conducted by Dr.<br/>
David Joseph Weeks, a clinical neuropsychologist from<br/>
the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, has turned up some very<br/>
positive information for those whom society labels as<br/>
being &quot;eccentric.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The report (which has been adapted into a book by Dr. <br/>
Weeks and Jamie James entitled Eccentrics: A Study of<br/>
Sanity and Strangeness, published by Kodansha Globe)<br/>
concludes that eccentrics live five to ten years<br/>
longer than average, and that they are usually<br/>
healthier, happier, and more intelligent than the rest<br/>
of us.<br/>
<br/>
According to Dr. Weeks, an eccentric s &quot;nonconforming;<br/>
creative; strongly motivated by curiosity; idealistic:<br/>
he (or she) wants to make the world a better place and<br/>
the people in it happier; happily obsessed with one or<br/>
more hobbies (usually five or six); aware from early<br/>
childhood that he (or she) is different; intelligent;<br/>
opinionated and outspoken, convinced that he (or she)<br/>
is right and that the rest of the world is out of<br/>
step.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many of us suppress our desire to do &quot;daring&quot; things<br/>
because we are afraid of being judged by our peers as<br/>
being weird or strange. The heavily conformist strains<br/>
in our society encourage us to behave like everyone<br/>
else, leaving our adventurous selves alone in the<br/>
shadows.<br/>
<br/>
Freud once wrote, &quot;...we have to give up a certain<br/>
amount of our wild nature in order to live in<br/>
society.&quot; But must we really? And is it healthy?<br/>
<br/>
Eccentric people are sometimes mistakenly perceived as<br/>
being mildly insane, or mentally ill. But actually,<br/>
the eccentric person chooses to behave in an<br/>
outlandish manner because it gives them positive<br/>
pleasure. In some ways, an eccentric is the flip side<br/>
of the neurotic -- the neurotic can be highly insecure<br/>
with feelings of inferiority, while the eccentric<br/>
celebrates his or her originality with no regrets.<br/>
<br/>
The eccentric people who participated in Dr. Weeks&#39;<br/>
study also scored very well on IQ tests, where they<br/>
ended up among the highest 15 percent of the general<br/>
population.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eccentrics are healthier because they are happier,&quot; <br/>
Dr. Weeks explains. &quot;Stated simply, eccentrics<br/>
experience much lower levels of stress because they do<br/>
not feel the need to conform, and lower stress levels<br/>
mean their immune-response systems can function more<br/>
efficiently.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if you feel like walking around in a raincoat on<br/>
the hottest day of the year, or joining the Polar Bear<br/>
Club, or shaving half your beard off while studying<br/>
under-water basket weaving, go for it! You are not<br/>
crazy, you are &quot;eccentric,&quot; which as it turns out is<br/>
very healthy indeed!<br/>

after I forwarded it...<br/>
<br/>
Happens to me too.....I get the reply before the post.<br/>
Once in a while.  Or I send several posts that show up<br/>
out of order with the first after the last by a day or<br/>
more.  Dunno where they go in cyber space.  The long<br/>
way around I guess. Happens in snail mail<br/>
sometimes......but then it is just different mail<br/>
bags.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed your rebuttal to the Seattle rag.<br/>
