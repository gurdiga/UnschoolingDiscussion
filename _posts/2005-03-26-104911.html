Be there.  It sounds so simple, but many moms get busy and they don&#39;t take<br/>
the time to really be there with their children to help them work things<br/>
out.  Moms get busy with cleaning the house or making dinner or whatever.<br/>
Take time out of your day to *be with your boys for how ever long it takes<br/>
to help them through this frustrating time.  Be there to not only help<br/>
diffuse the situation, but to prevent it from happening to begin with.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When something happens where one son can&#39;t express himself very well or does<br/>
something to the other, help him to say what he wants.  Help them both to<br/>
communicate without hurling insults at each other.  It&#39;s frustrating and a<br/>
lot of work, but it&#39;s such a great life skill to give them.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Help them to not make it personal.  If one took a toy, he could say, &quot;I<br/>
wasn&#39;t done with that.  Would you please give it back.&quot; (instead of &quot;you<br/>
moron, I was playing with that.  Give it back.) If one boy banged into the<br/>
other and the one who was banged was offended, it isn&#39;t going to help if he<br/>
yells at the one who banged him.  You could help him to say, &quot;I don&#39;t like<br/>
it when you bang into me.  Please be more careful.&quot;  Model saying sorry when<br/>
it applies to you.  Suggest that a sorry might make the other person feel a<br/>
little better when someone&#39;s been offended or hurt.  (I wouldn&#39;t force it<br/>
though.)  And help them to see things from the other&#39;s perspective.  (you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t like it if you were playing with that and he came and took it from<br/>
you with no warning, would you?&quot;)  But not too much preaching.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you are there for a good part of their interactions you can see where the<br/>
problem lies in their communication.  Maybe the older one is frustrated<br/>
because they younger one is doing something you can&#39;t see that isn&#39;t very<br/>
nice.  Maybe he is just in a growth stage and he needs your help to express<br/>
himself for now.  It can be frustrating but it&#39;s worth it.  When you see<br/>
them working out a deal or working through a problem later on in a mature<br/>
and thoughtful way, it&#39;ll be so worth it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thoughts on building family harmony? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Provide more things to do, either away from the house or in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re used to the old way where going out to lunch is for special <br/>
occasions and movies are &quot;too expensive&quot; and only for holidays or whatever maybe look <br/>
at all the benefits you get from one outing and consider it an expense of <br/>
unschooling, instead.<br/>
<br/>
Find things you&#39;ve had that haven&#39;t been out for a while, and bring those <br/>
out.  Bring something out in one room, and have something that&#39;s also interesting <br/>
in another.  Split the kids up that way, with FUN stuff, instead of boring <br/>
same-old stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Make homemade playdough and color it bright colors with Wilton cake-frosting <br/>
colors (just a spot about the size of a B-B on the end of a toothpick is <br/>
enough for a regular batch of playdough.  My kids used to love black and pink.    <br/>
Put it out with some familiar cutters and rollers, but some new and different <br/>
stuff, too.   A fork, more toothpicks, a piece of old terrycloth you don&#39;t care <br/>
a whole lot about.  (The color might stain it, but it will make good patterns <br/>
on the surface of the playdough, and you can wash it out or throw it away.)<br/>
<br/>
You be with them more yourself, interacting physically and verbally and <br/>
emotionally.<br/>
If you&#39;re spending time doing mom-stuff in the same way you would if they <br/>
were off at school, that&#39;s not going to work very well when the&#39;re stuck inside <br/>
from snow or mud.<br/>
<br/>
Bring a happy, surprising little snack once in a while when they don&#39;t expect <br/>
it.  Pineapple chunks on toothpicks.    (Toothpicks reminded me.)  <br/>
Yoghurt-coated raisens.  Little tuna sandwiches cut with cookie cutters.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s Deb Lewis&#39;s super list of things to do in the winter:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052054414">AMAZING! (Deb¹s list!)<br/>
<br/>
I love the vision it gives me.  And stepping past the old fears and<br/>
insecurities of what people might think -  to embrace the world, the people<br/>
in it, and all the wonderful vocations, activities, etc.  My parents never<br/>
ask anybody questions ­ fortunately my husband has modeled it for me and I<br/>
quickly picked it up!! I want my kids to never be hesitant to ask a<br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also for the recent discussion on learning vs teaching which was<br/>
brought up by my definiton of unschooling.  It has really made me think<br/>
deeply about how we learn, how my preschooler and toddler are learning, and<br/>
how we discuss, approach learning.  It¹s been a big positive.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Probably not as good, but cheaper and quicker if your computer is willing:<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed by an unschooling mom in Canada whose family does an <br/>
unschooling radio show.  The interview was edited down very tightly (I DO talk fast, <br/>
but not quite that unceasingly &lt;g&gt;), and is 30 minutes, wi (LOUD) musical <br/>
interludes (sit close to your volume control, or be prepared).  The inte<br/>
Zrview was 90 minutes, and not all is there but maybe an hours worth was <br/>
carefully packed into 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t have said &quot;civil war&quot; and when I did think this for me: &quot;oops&quot;<br/>
Cavalier is as late as they go (the bootmaking range), and I couldn&#39;t think <br/>
of the word.<br/>
&quot;Civil war&quot; kinda sounds like &quot;Cavalier,&quot; doesn&#39;t it?  (To people who don&#39;t <br/>
know anything about history, maybe. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
Because we have a DSL line now, it loaded very easily here.  I was surprised. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you know people at any of those other-listed stations there <br/>
you could ask them to play it.  It seems kind of campus <br/>
radio/public-access/online.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not specifically about peaceful parenting, but at some level all of <br/>
unschooling moves that direction.    The topics the interviewer wanted to cover <br/>
were strewing and spiritual unschooling.  <br/>

We were big into &quot;You can be next.&quot;<br/>
Another way of saying yes instead of no.<br/>
<br/>
Still works.  The kids will say &quot;You&#39;re next&quot;  or &quot;When I&#39;m done I&#39;ll let you <br/>
have it&quot; (&quot;IT&quot; recently being the X-Box-Live access) instead of &quot;No, I&#39;m <br/>
playing.&quot;<br/>
