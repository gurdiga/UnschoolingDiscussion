 </span></blockquote>I have a doggy question.  <br/>
<br/>
Since we lost Percy a few months ago, Ladybug (Jack Russell) has become quite <br/>
bearable to live with, doesn&#39;t run off, doesn&#39;t demand too much attention, <br/>
has not once made a mess in the new house (although she did eat the <br/>
gingerbread boy and tree off the g-bread house when no one was looking).  She <br/>
wasn&#39;t so bad when Percy was here, either, but now we get to see the real <br/>
her, I think.  Except for one thing--she won&#39;t get along with other dogs when <br/>
she&#39;s on the leash!<br/>
<br/>
We live in the country on 10 acres and there are lots and lots of dogs who <br/>
come around to visit her yard.  (I can hear all you city people clucking <br/>
about how she should be in a pen, but just hear me out! &lt;g&gt;)  There are 3 <br/>
dogs who live across the field and they hang out with Ladybug and she&#39;s just <br/>
fine around them outside.  But if I put her on a leash and let her sniff any <br/>
another dog, she gets to growling and nipping and won&#39;t let the other dog <br/>
sniff her.  (She weighs only 12 pounds and stands about 10 inches at the <br/>
shoulders, so she&#39;s almost always dwarfed by other dogs, so I understand <br/>
feeling intimidated.)  <br/>
<br/>
So what can I do to make her feel comfortable around other dogs while on the <br/>
leash?  She&#39;s 4 now and it&#39;s time for her to know better.  Sometimes I pick <br/>
her up and that makes her feel superior and stop growling...but the other dog <br/>
cannot come near me, because, of course, she&#39;s trapped and protective and <br/>
goes nuts.  So, I usually pick her up and carry her away from the other dog, <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t help her learn to accept them.  Short of obedience class, <br/>
and I shudder to think about all those other dogs there, what to do?<br/>
