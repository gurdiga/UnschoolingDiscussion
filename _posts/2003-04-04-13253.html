<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034187622">I loved reading about your home.  About a dozen years ago, when my family <br/>
moved back to the states after living in Okinawa, we were camped out in a two <br/>
bedroom apartment waiting for base housing.  We then had a choice, the seven <br/>
of us could move into a three bed-room house after three months, or we could <br/>
wait about a year for a four bedroom.  We did a family vote and went for the <br/>
three - which cut out one move.<br/>
<br/>
We put the toy shelves in the large living room, and the piano fit in our <br/>
bedroom.  My neighbors couldn&#39;t belive the lay-out, but their kids loved to <br/>
play in our space.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I have a bathroom all to myself, the mess I pick up is either mine, or <br/>
Trevor&#39;s, and life has changed drastically.  Kids grow up and leave home, but <br/>
memories of really LIVING in the home are forever!<br/>
<br/>
As far as reading ages:<br/>
<br/>
Chris - 4 1/2<br/>
Shawn - 6<br/>
Devin - 10<br/>
Donika - 4<br/>
Trevor - 12<br/>
<br/>
The teeth theory didn&#39;t really work for them.  Of course Shawn might have <br/>
thrown it off when after reading  Bruce the Moose&#39;s Loose Tooth he tied a <br/>
string around his front tooth and to the door, slammed the door, and there <br/>
went that front tooth about a year before it had planned to get loose on it&#39;s <br/>
own!!<br/>
