<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290360465">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I usually sit back and marvel at you all, but I would like to respond<br/>
to this post simply because I feel that so much has been going right<br/>
for my daughter and I since I threw out some of my ideas.<br/>
<br/>
When I took my dd out of school this year, even though I thought I had<br/>
an unschooling philosophy I felt pushed (by my own conditioning more<br/>
than likely) to &#39;teach&#39; Kaya what I thought she &#39;needed&#39; to know. I<br/>
tried to make it fun and exciting, but it was still led by me. I<br/>
wanted her to do certain things every day or every week.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I realized that it wasn&#39;t really &#39;fun&#39; for either of us. I<br/>
still had anxiety about whether I was doing everything right.<br/>
<br/>
Things changed for us when we started reading the fourth Harry Potter<br/>
book out loud. We were so into it that we sometimes read for the whole<br/>
day. Seriously, it was hard putting the book down long enough to make<br/>
meals, my throat started getting so sore. LOL <br/>
<br/>
I found myself justifying this to myself. We are homeshoolers we can<br/>
do what we want. As this went on I started believing myself, we can do<br/>
what we want truly. <br/>
<br/>
I am finding that when I am interested in something and spend time<br/>
myself on learning what I want to learn it opens Kaya up to explore<br/>
what she wants to learn and sometimes our interests coincide. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I am very interested in geography, finding out exactly where<br/>
things are in our world. I have maps on every wall of my living room.<br/>
We are literally surrounded by the world. I find it very exciting and<br/>
Kaya has picked up on that and wants to learn as much as she can. <br/>
<br/>
When I was in school there were so many things being crammed into my<br/>
head that I was uniterested in; I remeber very little about those<br/>
things. I don&#39;t use chemistry in my everday life, but I am finding<br/>
that there are situations where algebra would come in handy. While I<br/>
was not interested when I was in school, now I want to learn it and so<br/>
will put energy into doing so, not because someone is making me, but<br/>
because I can see how it would be helpful in my life. <br/>
<br/>
Schools turn out a remarkably uniform product. Each kid retains a tiny<br/>
fraction of what they consider to be the useless junk that has been<br/>
crammed into their heads.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that if you sit back and let your kids find what interests them<br/>
you will soon be marveling at how much energy they will put into<br/>
learning about their current passion. And you will probably be<br/>
remarking to everyone who will listen &quot;Wow, do you see how cool s/he<br/>
is? That is one amazing kid!&quot; ( or maybe that&#39;s just me) tee hee<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
Right, if by &quot;uniform&quot; you  mean uniformly disgusted with education and <br/>
resistent to learning.  Some escape, but not because the school didn&#39;t try to <br/>
squelch all joy.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can do that at home, too!<br/>

<br/>
If you hang out with them and do cool things instead of just sitting back, it <br/>
will happen even sooner.<br/>
