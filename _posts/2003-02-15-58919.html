<div id="ygrps-yiv-415778913">How about the unabridged version on audiotape?  My kids loved it.  There are <br/>
many parts in the original story that are left out of the movie.<br/>

I had a girlfriend who had a boyfriend who had CRS (can&#39;t remember, well you <br/>
get the picture!) He was such a burnout and I remember one day she called <br/>
him a scarecrow. I didn&#39;t get it and she started to sing the song from the <br/>
Wizard of Oz, If I Only Had a Brain!!!! Thought that was too funny. Now if <br/>
Joe or I or even Tara get a bit scattered brained we break into song!<br/>
<br/>
I could while away the hours.........<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486275559">Maybe they would like to listen to the unabridged version while coloring in<br/>
the WOZ coloring book?<br/>
<br/>
My dd was a munchkin in the local children&#39;s theatre production of WOZ last<br/>
fall.  The teens who played the lion, tin man, and scarecrow were all really<br/>
cool kids.  I have seen most of them in other ACT productions over the<br/>
years.  The young man who played scarecrow was an awesome Peter Pan a couple<br/>
of years ago.<br/>
<br/>
We happened to see the movie a few years ago when it aired in a local<br/>
theater.  That witch is really scary when her face takes up an entire<br/>
screen!  We have the video too.  I read a book &quot;written&quot; from the witch&#39;s<br/>
point of view - Wicked by Gregory McGuire.  Kinda strange.<br/>
