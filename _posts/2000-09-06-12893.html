<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735277430">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
You guys are incredible with all your helpful suggestions on my baby&#39;s tushie <br/>
and our up-coming road trip! <br/>
<br/>
BTW, my little guys tushie is looking much better today.  No dairy, finally <br/>
last night a bath, and breastmilk seems to have done the trick.<br/>
<br/>
I am once again looking forward to the trip, with all your helpful <br/>
suggestions about the car ride....<br/>
<br/>
Now, I need more help.... I am looking for good family books to read for a <br/>
family of a 5yr old girl, a 11 girl and 12 yr old boy.  And for my family <br/>
too.  However, mine may still be too little at 3 and 1.. any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Can you also give us a look inside a day of an unschooler?  For example, what <br/>
did everyone do yesterday or plan on doing today? (Notice that I did not say <br/>
&quot;typical&quot;...because I know better.)  Also, can you share your childrens ages?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your helpful suggestions,<br/>
Julie- who is really curious, not just trying to simulate a topic change....</div>

I have 2 stepkids ds 18 (lives with mom), dd 16 (with us) and 3 little ones<br/>
dd 7, ds 4 & ds 2.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest a couple of old books that have been out of print but are<br/>
now back in print.  I had them as a child & read them to my own.  Your older<br/>
ones could take turns reading.<br/>
<br/>
Elmer & the Dragon; My Father&#39;s Dragon & Dragons of Blueland by Ruth Stiles<br/>
Gannett<br/>
<br/>
The Boxcar Children read or get on audio tape<br/>
<br/>
Not much help but my trips are spent entertaining the little ones & I hope<br/>
they sleep alot.  Check at your public library for books on tape.</div>
