<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535047041">After the discussions concerning unschooling music, I thought I needed to <br/>
share an unschooling moment with you.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, we made a trip to Borders (on my crutches - Look Ma, no <br/>
wheelchair) and ended up buying Swan Lake on dvd.  Saturday my two cherubs <br/>
watched it three times, but not the last scene where the prince drowns or <br/>
some of the other scary parts.  Sunday, the same thing.  Except that Nathan <br/>
started dancing with the music, leaving the room to go in the &quot;wings&quot;, <br/>
leaping all over the place.  Julia mostly just watches, riveted.<br/>
<br/>
The past four days, this has been their quiet time pick.  Not so quiet for my <br/>
son, mostly.  I&#39;m thrilled they are so interested and can tell me the whole <br/>
story of the ballet and reenact it.  But at 3 and 4, I&#39;m not going to rush <br/>
out and enroll them in ballet classes.  Recovering from the broken ankle has <br/>
shown me how much ballet formed my legs and feet starting at age 4.  My foot <br/>
is pointed in the cast.  Even under anesthesia the surgeon couldn&#39;t <br/>
straighten me out.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on other ballets (we have asked Santa for the nutcracker for <br/>
Christmas) and/or operas to start with?<br/>

It&#39;s not a ballet, but Cats. <br/>
Mr. Mestopheles is a ballet guy.<br/>
So&#39;s what&#39;s her name.  (If their name&#39;s not in the song, I don&#39;t know their <br/>
names.)</div>

Well- some operettas. My kids have loved these from about age 3 on - Gilbert and Sullivan - esp The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado...Leonie W. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hansel and Gretel is an old fave of mine.  Might have something to do with<br/>
my grandmother&#39;s big production of the angel scene with all of us every<br/>
Christmas.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
She sang the part of Hansel in Germany.  My father was taken to see a<br/>
performance when he was around three.  As soon as he saw Hansel he shouted,<br/>
&quot;See that boy up there on the stage?  That&#39;s my mommy.&quot;  (Women often sing<br/>
young male parts in opera.  They&#39;re called trouser roles.)<br/>
We&#39;re playing the overture for an orchestra concert in a couple of weeks.<br/>
Oh, I guess you know now that I like the opera.  I think your kids might<br/>
too.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1034876435">My first operas were Gilbert and Sullivan, although I think that they ruined <br/>
me for &quot;True&quot; opera or more adult opera. They are fun but not such a good <br/>
intro to the beauty that opera can have.<br/>
I think kids will like  to hear The Three Tenors, and now there is a newer <br/>
trio called the Three Mo&#39; Tenors. They sing a more Jazzy style, mixing blues, <br/>
jazz and opera.<br/>
If your local TV stations will show the &quot;Pageant of Peace&quot; White house Xmas <br/>
tree lighting, they will be performing. Also on the bill are Sandra&#39;s <br/>
favorite &quot;new age poofs&quot; Manaheim Steamroller.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353406213">We have ordered the one below - the review emphasizes the<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; benefit, but I know that our little budding<br/>
ballerina likes other computer games that let her create a<br/>
musical phrase or line and adores Barbie and the Nutcracker, so I<br/>
rather think that when Santa leaves this one, it will be a hit:<br/>
<br/>
. The Nutcracker Music Game provides children with a feast.<br/>
<br/>
For children ages 4 to 6, the software offers musical games where<br/>
children learn the sounds of each instrument.<br/>
<br/>
But the truly amazing part of this software is the games for<br/>
older children.<br/>
<br/>
In the lead game, kids listen to selections from Tchaikovsky&#39;s<br/>
Nutcracker Suite and then experiment to determine which four of<br/>
eight instruments were playing the selection. Because they can<br/>
listen to each instruments part individually before they mix<br/>
them, kids can experience the process of orchestration.<br/>
<br/>
This musical masterpiece is available at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us or from the<br/>
publisher&#39;s Web site.<br/>
<br/>
(Five stars) Best for ages 4 and up.<br/>
<br/>
From Music Games International, www.KidsMusicStage.com, for $20.<br/>
Windows only.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004576799">I think &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; is a ballet by Tschiakovsky.  The video &quot;The <br/>
Swan Princess&quot; is based on Swan Lake but there is no ballet in it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My kids have loved these from about age 3 on - Gilbert and Sullivan - esp <br/>
The Pirates of Penzance&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All my kids know this one from the video with Kevin Kline, Rex Smith and <br/>
Linda Ronstadt.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago Kirby had a batch of visiting kids and made some clever <br/>
reference to Pirates of Penzance and they all looked blankly, so he said <br/>
&quot;What?  You guys don&#39;t know Pirates of Penzance?&quot;  And he set them down and <br/>
showed it to them, telling them what was important and funny and that the <br/>
patter song wasn&#39;t really originally from that operetta.<br/>
<br/>
I thought to myself:  &quot;Genetics.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
=Hansel and Gretel is an old fave of mine. =<br/>
<br/>
A school music book my dad had found at a dump when I was ten had a <br/>
kid-version of that, and I could play piano well enough to figure out the <br/>
tunes, and we did a little play of it in our bedroom.  It had no angel song, <br/>
though.  <br/>

I had thought that the G&S would be too fast for them to understand, but that <br/>
seems to be about the same speed as Veggie Tales.  My mother in law has a VT <br/>
