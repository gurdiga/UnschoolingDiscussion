I do have a question though. What about the studies that discuss brain<br/>
function during tv viewing?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
       Apart from the psychological issue of does-TV-breed-violence, the <br/>
study findings I&#39;ve read suggest  that young brains physically develop more and <br/>
richer neural pathways in  heavily-used areas. Use it or lose it. In other <br/>
words, TV changes the brain&#39;s hardwiring -- stimulation causes additional growth, <br/>
while longterm lack of stimulation leads other pathways and synapses to <br/>
atrophy. <br/>
<br/>
       This doesn&#39;t only apply to rapid-fire screen stimulation like tv and <br/>
computers, of course. It applies to everything about how the developing brain <br/>
is or isn&#39;t used.<br/>
<br/>
       So at bottom those who interpret the research wind up making value <br/>
judgments about which areas of the brain are &quot;better&quot; than others, especially as <br/>
we prepare children for their future. That means to live in future society, <br/>
but unfortunately it also usually mean for &quot;school.&quot; What amazes me is how so <br/>
many learned professionals in various fields, who don&#39;t otherwise act like <br/>
Luddites, just stonewall the idea that tv-computer capabilities will be more and <br/>
more integrated into the daily environments of the future, and that therefore <br/>
the brains of people in the future had BETTER adapt to it! And that graowing <br/>
brains to do well in &quot;school&quot; might be in direct opposition to this goal!<br/>
<br/>
          Some will find this debate annoying no doubt, but for any <br/>
unschooler who does want some links on the different perspectives, we chose to include <br/>
a few in PDE&#39;s Thinking Parent resources, as a sort of exercise in independent <br/>
analysis of education issues. <br/>
Part 3: Thinking for the Future<br/>
1) High Tech Debate: Does It Develop or Destroy Young Minds? -- Two adults <br/>
offer very different views of how technology affects developing human minds -- <br/>
Nature Magazine&#39;s opinion is included below too. Or maybe the kids have already <br/>
figured it out? Also, a link to and commentary on the Kaiser study on <br/>
children and electronic media.<br/>
