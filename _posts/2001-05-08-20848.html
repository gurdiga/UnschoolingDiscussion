<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000854126">I enjoy all the discussions on this list even when I may or may not agree. <br/>
It always gets me thinking on certain subjects that I normally wouldnt give <br/>
a second thought to. So I really dont mind a subject being posted/talked to <br/>
death because there are always so many different opions/ideas and I like <br/>
reading all the different views :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927636314">For me, unschooling did/does include all of life, parenting issues <br/>
especially. I realized when Laurie was starting college, and I was <br/>
being told... &quot;write the book&quot; by everyone that met her, that I <br/>
didn&#39;t just keep her from the monotony of school, I gave her an <br/>
entirely different life from what most kids were having. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059767599">I&#39;ve thought a lot about the passion we all were showing about <br/>
spanking. Wouldn&#39;t it be stranger if we did NOT show this passion? I <br/>
mean...we are so passionate about our children that we are giving <br/>
them the best childhood that we can in spite of any obstacles. We are <br/>
passionate people! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for saying this Valerie, this is one of the main reasons for us for<br/>
unschooling. There is just so much more to life! I think of how many petty<br/>
things my heart and mind were wrapped up in because of school and peer<br/>
groups, and how much rebellion I had to go pouring my creative energies into<br/>
in order to feel semi-in control of my life. I wish I&#39;d been able to put all<br/>
that time and energy into something that mattered instead of into anger<br/>
against all the obstacles in my path.<br/>
