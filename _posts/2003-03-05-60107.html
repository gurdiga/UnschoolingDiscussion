 Ren, did you ask the kids why things went the way they did when their <br/>
friends <br/>
 were there? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it was really my fault.<br/>
It really got me pissed off at the time, but like most scenarios, I see where <br/>
I was to blame once I back away and get some perspective.<br/>
I was totally relaxed the whole time the friends were over. This is another <br/>
unschooling family so the kids are absolutely awesome and very close to my <br/>
kids.<br/>
I fixed them food and brought it to them while they played video games. They <br/>
all crashed in the living room at various times (mostly in the early morning:)<br/>
I don&#39;t stress about mess when kids are hanging out, it&#39;s just more fun to <br/>
hang out and play.<br/>
<br/>
So after they went home, my kids were exhausted. They were totally, <br/>
completely wiped out. So cleaning up after themselves to any degree was not a <br/>
priority of course.<br/>
I did recognize some of that at the time because I remember saying &quot;I didn&#39;t <br/>
choose to ignore my sleep needs!!&quot;<br/>
They love these friends so much that they do this everytime they get <br/>
together. They just love their time and don&#39;t want to waste it sleeping. They <br/>
see each other weekly most of the time...we&#39;d spent the day at a Renaissance <br/>
festival just the day before, but when ya really like someone, I guess sleep <br/>
is NOT the priority at all.<br/>
So my relaxed state in the midst of mess only lasts so long. And I just <br/>
wasn&#39;t clear enough about warning them that I was starting to get <br/>
stressed...it just built up.<br/>
I need to give very clear information before I get stressed, as someone said <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
They were simply exhausted and wanted to be waited on a bit. And I was <br/>
exhausted too and didn&#39;t want to help anyone anymore.<br/>
Bad timing, tired people, Mom with too much going on....it all led up to a <br/>
rough couple of days. But I have to look at the big picture and the happy <br/>
household that we have most days.  Blow ups were WAY more common before I <br/>
learned to apply unschooling philosophies to other areas of life.<br/>
Now they seem to be the exception, and every time I learn a bit more about <br/>
myself and how I can do better.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forgetting about the cleaning up part.  Isn&#39;t it great to see children like <br/>
that.  When my boys are around like minded children you can see the <br/>
excitement.  No one harping or nagging.  They aren&#39;t worrying about what <br/>
their Mom will say.  I get that way when I see my brother, we usually don&#39;t <br/>
see each other but every couple of years and we stay up late talking etc.  <br/>
