&lt;&lt;   Give me someplace cold, never above 80, with lots of rain and <br/>
 cloudy days and I&#39;m THERE! &lt;bg&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;d be happy in the NW somewhere...Seattle or Portland for most <br/>
of the year anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Hawaii actually doesn&#39;t get very hot, only around 80-83 usually, very <br/>
temperate weather.<br/>
And there is not sand everywhere! Mostly there is lots and lots of black <br/>
stone that used to be lava :) and lush greenery.<br/>
The sand is pretty much where the land meets the ocean, you know, that place <br/>
they call the beach.<br/>
<br/>
I love Hawaii dearly. I&#39;d live there if you could drive to it. The isolation <br/>
of Alaska and Hawaii are what bother me. You have to spend a lot of money to <br/>
get OUT of there.<br/>
I LOVE hopping into my car and going to other states whenever I feel like it.<br/>
Great way to travel cheap (and meet other unschoolers)<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

 Jennifer, whose husband spent all winter on the eastern seaboard and is a <br/>
 big whiney baby about cold weather now.  Grrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really think you should all come down here for a mini-conference!!<br/>
We boast the nicest beaches in the contiguous U.S. (pure white sand, like <br/>
sugar), a not-too-big city but plenty of family friendly things to do and <br/>
great prices.<br/>
The beaches here are truly beautiful, dolphins swim by regularly and after <br/>
school starts in the fall it&#39;s very unpopulated too!<br/>
I think everyone should visit me in early October some year.<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to plan something. Anyone? (oh, I&#39;m in Pensacola, FL btw)<br/>

&lt;&lt; We spent a month in Alaska in &#39;00 and I STILL cry when I think of it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where did you visit in AK?<br/>
I was born and raised in Fairbanks, still have most of my family in various <br/>
places of Alaska.  I was visiting Fairbanks and Wasilla July/August 2000, <br/>
maybe we crossed paths.<br/>
