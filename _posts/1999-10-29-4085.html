Bhindi (or bhindu, depends on where in India you are), is a<br/>
representation of a &quot;third eye&quot; to signify inner vision -  just have you<br/>
have two eyes peering out into the world, you simultaneously need an<br/>
&quot;inner eye&quot; to peer into your own heart.  Women wear them, sometimes<br/>
much more elaborate, as part of general makeup -- men wear them when<br/>
taking part in religious ritual.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604552927">Interestingly enough my daughter had to wear one for her dance recital and <br/>
we didn&#39;t know until twenty minutes before.  Several of the moms had <br/>
anticipated my, um, ignorance (or shall we say general cluelessness) and<br/>

one and painted one on her with lipstick.<br/>

at her party did Mehndi (henna designs on hands, wrists, and ankles.<br/>
Then Aliyah and I went to the opera -- she decided to wear to wear her<br/>
bright red and cream salwa (it is kind of like a pajama set - long,<br/>
ankle hugging pants, with long embroidered kurta over it, then a scarf),<br/>
and of course a tear-drop bhindi -- she looked absolutely amazing - true<br/>
opera wear!<br/>
