<div id="ygrps-yiv-321319280">**It is an interesting question, which controversial subjects should be<br/>

<br/>
Permission to change the subject?  (And not because I&#39;m offended... just<br/>
because I&#39;m highly distractable.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering recently about that word &quot;rubric&quot; which has become<br/>
popular in education-ese.  So I looked it up in my 20 year old dictionary<br/>
and the meaning was roughly &quot;heading or title&quot; from the practice of<br/>
printing headings in red.  That matches how you used the word, but doesn&#39;t<br/>
really match the new Ed-speak meaning.<br/>
<br/>
In the teaching world, does &quot;rubric&quot; now mean &quot;goal&quot; or something like<br/>
that?  Anyone know?  And is this part of a special attempt to be mysterious<br/>
and baffle parents?<br/>

     As for a new thread, isn&#39;t it interesting that with such a full range of <br/>
religious beliefs we&#39;ve all come to unschooling. So far we seem to have <br/>
members who identify themselves as Christians, Pagans, of Native American <br/>
beliefs, Buddhists and Hindus and Other, yet we all share our educational <br/>
philosophy. It might be interesting to discuss the connection between our <br/>
spiritual beliefs and our beliefs about learning. I&#39;ll be happy to write <br/>
about this but right now I have to go to Satsang (our Hindu &quot;church&quot; <br/>

&lt;&lt; I wonder why Jesus is off topic? Really, I am just curious, not <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think Jesus is off-topic at all. Even for non-Christians, his life <br/>
can hold historical and philosophical significance. I would love it if <br/>
everyone would send out a post on their religious beliefs or lack thereof. It <br/>
is such a huge part of who we are and how we raise and educate our children. <br/>
It would be great if we could all do that without critiquing someone else&#39;s <br/>
faith. <br/>
<br/>
The problem comes in when people feel the need to qualify their beliefs with <br/>
things like &quot;I must confess&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not going to hide&quot;. When the post start <br/>
to be offensive and/or defensive then things tend to go downhill. <br/>
<br/>
I believe Jesus Christ was the Son of God and a beautiful example of how one <br/>
should try to live one&#39;s life. I believe that how we live is what really <br/>
matters. If your Pagan beliefs inspire you to hold out a hand to someone who <br/>
needs it, if your Islamic views teach you to respect and care for your <br/>
elders, if your Buddhist philosophy teaches you to find and perpetuate peace <br/>
then, as they say, it&#39;s all good.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest influence my faith has had on my homeschooling philosophy is <br/>
that it has inspired me to make sure our learning is less self-centered than <br/>
it might otherwise be.  <br/>
