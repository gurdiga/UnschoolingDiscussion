of pipe cleaners (so they bend), a wooden bead, felt, floss, and silk <br/>
flowers. Sometimes an acorn cap for a hat, sometimes they have wings. They&#39;re <br/>
cute little things, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches tall. <br/>

How old is Marsie? It might even be something you could make with her if I <br/>
can figure out how to write out the instructions without your seeing one.<br/>
