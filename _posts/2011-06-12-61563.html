<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to someone that isn&#39;t an unschooler who has some thoughts on <br/>
reading.  The title is a bit of a misnomer, but it does talk about kids that <br/>
have learned how to read without being taught.<br/>

Proof can mean all kinds of things.  What kind of proof are you looking for?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912170772">Has anyone proved, 100%, that school works? How does a child learn when they are <br/>
unhappy and in a crowd of people and just want to be somewhere else? School is <br/>
testing new methods, new curriculum all the time. They don&#39;t know what works, <br/>
have run almost no scientific studies to demonstrate the efficacy of their <br/>
methods, do no long term studies, except on a giant aggregate scale, to <br/>
demonstrate that what they are doing has lasting value. And schools themselves <br/>
don&#39;t trust that it works. Lots of universities have classes to get their just <br/>
enrolled students up to the standards they require for coursework. No matter <br/>
what A levels their students come in having attained. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you learn? How do you learn something you want to know about now? Do you <br/>
go enroll in a class everytime you want to learn something new? Do you seek out <br/>
someone to tell you not only how to learn something but what it is you need <br/>
to/should be learning? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I learn all the time. I learn by watching and listening, I learn by <br/>
experiencing, I learn by exploring. I learn by looking something up on-line or <br/>
by following an idea through a google search. I learn by playing with something, <br/>
by feeling something. The house I&#39;m in now has this sloping floor that is so <br/>
marked the bed slants. I&#39;m learning about construction in the 18th century in <br/>
rural Brittany. Lots of learning is cumulative. I know about lots of different <br/>
kinds of floors, kinds of home construction because I&#39;ve lived and stayed in <br/>
lots of different buildings. Looked at different buildings, seen different <br/>
buildings in films and television shows and books. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how not to learn. I don&#39;t know how to turn off the thinking and <br/>
analysing part of my brain. The part that connects one idea with another and one <br/>
experience with another and to come up with something more than just what is in <br/>
front of me. Babies do it, toddlers do it, young children do it, teenagers do <br/>
it, young adults do it, middle aged folks (like me) do it, old folks do it. <br/>
Can&#39;t see it starting or stopping, don&#39;t know how to prove that it isn&#39;t going <br/>
on. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039326747">Oh, I meant to add, I was at a talk this Saturday, presented by Alan Thomas and <br/>
Harriet Pattison (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lttl.org.uk/harrietandalan.html)">http://www.lttl.org.uk/harrietandalan.html)</a> that talked about <br/>
how children learn to read. And how, in an environment without pressure, without <br/>
failure versus success, it seems to be inevitable that children will learn to <br/>
read. They have a book: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.howchildrenlearnathome.co.uk/,">http://www.howchildrenlearnathome.co.uk/,</a> that I haven&#39;t <br/>
read, but am planning on getting when we get back to the UK. <br/>

And some who are graduating have barely graduated and might feel not-very-smart for the rest of their lives.<br/>

MANY who graduate don&#39;t even think about university because by the time they squeak through graduation they had school and everything that looks like school.<br/>

When I said &quot;slag and waste&quot; above, I meant human waste.  Every school knows that a fairly big percentage of their kids will fail.  WILL fail.  Not &quot;might fail.&quot;  School is set up to sort the best from the worst.  Being &quot;best&quot; is worthless without some having been measured &quot;worst.&quot;  And those kids are whole humans with parents who love them.  And they fail.   Because of school.<br/>

<br/>
My husband and I are Deaf.  I have a hearing and a Deaf son.  The first son was never being taught to learn to speak...we use AMerican Sign Language.  He uses it for about 2 years then start to speak well.  He doesn&#39;t have a speech therapist which isn&#39;t really necessary.  He hears many words from my family and friends.  Of course, lots of people kept asking me how can we communicate to each other if he is hearing?  It did annoys me and I just let them to see us, and now it&#39;s 4 years.  People are so amazing how he can signs and speaks without being taught.  Thought I&#39;d share.  :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453851513">-=-**How did kids learn to speak without being taught?** That&#39;s a good question.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband and I are Deaf. I have a hearing and a Deaf son. The first son was never being taught to learn to speak...we use AMerican Sign Language. He uses it for about 2 years then start to speak well. He doesn&#39;t have a speech therapist which isn&#39;t really necessary. He hears many words from my family and friends. Of course, lots of people kept asking me how can we communicate to each other if he is hearing? It did annoys me and I just let them to see us, and now it&#39;s 4 years. People are so amazing how he can signs and speaks without being taught. Thought I&#39;d share. :) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
Did he watch TV or movies and maybe learn words (accents, intonation) there, too?<br/>

<br/>
And.. if he did learn some from TV and movies, did you guys watch together with <br/>
the subtitles on?  I&#39;m curious about that!  That can help kids learn to read <br/>
too!<br/>
