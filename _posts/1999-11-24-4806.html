&lt;&lt; most<br/>
 people want to believe that this kind of thing is perpetrated due to cold<br/>
 heartedness, the need for control or disdain for the kids.  my experience is<br/>
 that it&#39;s actually not that personal (but it&#39;s extremely difficult not to <br/>
take<br/>
 it that way),  that it&#39;s the parents&#39; inability to handle the stresses of <br/>
their<br/>
 own choices.  it&#39;s not that they don&#39;t love you or that you are not lovable,<br/>
 it&#39;s just that their own needs are so big and out of control they can&#39;t even<br/>
 begin to realize you have any.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I think we lived the same life. Right down to 4 girls and one boy, I was <br/>
the oldest which was the most dangerous place to be in my family. I was <br/>
expected to be everything to everyone. My mother&#39;s confidant, my siblings <br/>
protector, the maid, baby-sitter and child when it suited them. Today I am <br/>
finally beginning to be me living and raising my children the way that suits <br/>
me.<br/>
    I am so grateful that I was given the grace not to repeat what my parents <br/>
did. However I have fought every day of my life the legacy they left in my <br/>
head. My mom is a different person today for the most part and is very sorry <br/>
for all that happened but it still happened.<br/>

    Thank you so much for your post.  It really made me think.  Your <br/>
description of your childhood, your insight into your parents&#39; reasons for <br/>
being the way they were, your empathy for yourself and your siblings and even <br/>
your parents...you have really developed a wisdom about all this.  Your <br/>
answer for finding a better way...that is, accepting yourself fully and being <br/>
kind to yourself...makes so much sense.  Thanks again for sharing this and <br/>
I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve joined the group here.<br/>
