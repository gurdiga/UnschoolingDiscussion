&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I guess part of my problem is still that I feel like it shouldn&#39;t <br/>
always be<br/>
 me asking.  I feel like they should notice too.  &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand this, but it&#39;s silly. It&#39;s like saying &quot;My husband should just <br/>
KNOW what I need&quot;<br/>
Communication is key.<br/>
We are likely to only be disappointed by having an attitude like this, <br/>
although it&#39;s hard not to sometimes.<br/>

Thanks, I am just trying to make sure that I everyone still continues to<br/>
feel that way.  I appreciate the encouragement!  It really is a difficult<br/>
shift.  I am not going from total control to this framework (in fact most<br/>
everyone I know would say I have always been too lenient - they are big<br/>
about responsibility, getting up early stuff around here), but just the<br/>
changing in the philosophy is definitely teaching me to be a kinder and<br/>
gentler parent!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you ALL for helping me along this journey.<br/>

It works. Really and truly. I know it&#39;s so hard to believe, but if you&#39;re <br/>
patient, have realistic expectations and be a happy, joyful cleaner of the <br/>
home, you get positive results.<br/>
It&#39;s tough for kids to be mean and snarky or unhelpful in the face of joy and <br/>

<br/>
My kids have been doing their clean up routine for years. So all of <br/>
this thinking is new to me. But something you said earlier really <br/>
clicked. I got to thinking about how I like to reinforce the stuff I <br/>
approve or appreciate in my kids.<br/>
<br/>
When I see one act kindly, I try to immediately say so. If one of my <br/>
kids shares a toy, gives up a computer turn or helps a sibling load a <br/>
program, I notice outloud so all can hear.<br/>
<br/>
Well today it ocurred to me that I probably take their help for <br/>
granted because it is what we have always done and expect them to do. <br/>
I&#39;m not an ogre, by any means, but I don&#39;t often notice the hard work <br/>
they put in with the same level of enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
So today, I really paid attention to any time a child spontaneously <br/>
did an act of clean up. I saw one child volunteer to clean the floors <br/>
with a broom. Another child carried my plate to the sink twice in one <br/>
day after serving me a snack. Another one put away his toys without <br/>
anyone asking him to.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed and commented each time. Then later I thanked them very <br/>
sincerely for all of their hard work in our home every day and every <br/>
week. One of them said, &quot;Oh mom. We don&#39;t do enough, really.&quot; (I <br/>
realized then that that is probably waht I&#39;ve communicated!) I <br/>
replied, &quot;Actually, I think you guys do a ton of stuff to make this <br/>
place run smoothly and I totally appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Later at bedtime, the same one said, &quot;That was nice of you to say we <br/>
work hard. I didn&#39;t we did.&quot; Then I told him that I was wondering if <br/>
they would want to keep doing their chores if I gve them a free <br/>
choice. Both the one who is the most considerate of all the kids and <br/>
the one who likes to do his work the least said, &quot;yes.&quot; That stunned <br/>
me. Iasked why. They said, &quot;because the house looks better and feels <br/>
better when we do it and it&#39;s a lot for you to do alone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well... what a great onversation we had and I am so grateful for some <br/>
new awareness of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
And I spontaneously did multiple sinks worth of dishes today to help <br/>
out the washer who had a big social life planned for today. In the <br/>
past, I probably wouldn&#39;t have thought of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

on them. And I hope I&#39;m not bugging you with all my &quot;yeah, buts.&quot; <br/>
I&#39;ve been at this a long time and have a really harmonious home, <br/>
Really. We have great rapport with our kids. <br/>
<br/>
I got interested in radical unschooling because of the <br/>
stranglehold college prep was having over us. I suddenly felt <br/>
forced to consider hs for the older kids and I just didn&#39;t want to do <br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
So I came here to get support to let go and let them really <br/>
self-educate even in the face of college. I didn&#39;t bargain on <br/>
rearranging chores and bedtimes and foods and TV time! LOL <br/>
But I&#39;m so glad that I get the *whole* picture now. Really. I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m just extending how we already parent to a deeper <br/>
philosophical congruence.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking the time to share with new ones like me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I know now from other posts that the reason you are able to do this is<br/>
 because of your relationship with Marty, and that is as it should be.  It is<br/>
 just different coming to this in the middle of the teen years and I am<br/>
 trying to figure out how to do it for us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about this topic a lot lately.<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to always raise children in the atmosphere of trust and <br/>
respect, it&#39;s another thing entirely to come to it when they&#39;re older.<br/>
I think many of the qualities that need to be there in order for this style <br/>
of parenting to be smooth and effective are already damaged.<br/>
I am SO lucky that I figured this all out before my kids were very old....I <br/>
still see where the lousy way I handled things has really affected Trevor.<br/>
But the further we go, the more I treat him respectfully and kindly, the <br/>
better it gets.<br/>
I think it just takes more trust and patience on the parents part in order to <br/>
get to a good place, having not done this all along.<br/>

<br/>
But the very important thing to remember is that it CAN be done. Although <br/>
Tara went to school and was raised differently then the other 3, she is <br/>
pretty much in the same place as I would want her to be as if she was raised <br/>
her whole life with the mindset we have now. And there were many years where <br/>
we did an awful job of parenting. Although we have always been easy going <br/>
with bedtime and food and such, well we have gone through times where Tara <br/>
was punished to the point where there was nothing left to take away from <br/>
her. It was rough and we all paid dearly for it, but things worked out <br/>
better than I ever thought they could. It takes a lot of hard work and <br/>
patience up the ying yang, but it&#39;s worth it.<br/>
