<div id="ygrps-yiv-212685079">This is what we used to do in regards to our 4 year old and bedtime:<br/>
1) watch for sleepy signs<br/>
2)then bring him up to his room (this would usually turn out to be around the same time <br/>
every night-between 7;10 and 7:30 p.m.)<br/>
3)read books, listen to tapes, sing songs, talk-his choice-until he fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Normally he would fall asleep within 2 to 20 mins.<br/>
Not bad, probably. He had a *bedtime* but it wasn&#39;t arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, he would *fight* sleeping almost every night.<br/>
Even when his eyes were closing he would fight it and say, &quot;mom didn&#39;t you know? this is <br/>
how i sleep. with my eyes open&quot; and &quot;mom, i wasn&#39;t sleeping, i was just pretending.&quot; :)<br/>
There would also be lots of restlessness, and sometimes yelling.<br/>
Almost always he fell asleep quickly, but lately it had been taking 40 mins to an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Two things happened for me<br/>
-I thought maybe I need to change the bedtime, that I was *missing* his sleepy signals, <br/>
and/or <br/>
-that maybe now was the time to *lift* a *bedtime* guided by us.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I decided it was time to lift the bedtime. <br/>
We recognized that Marley has a really difficult time accepting when he is tired, he <br/>
recognizes it but fights fights FIGHTS it, and we wanted to help him get to a place where <br/>
he felt comfortable and o.k. with being sleepy and could/would tell US when he was tired <br/>
and wanted to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
We have an older son, Sett, who is 10 1/2 who stays up till he decides he&#39;s ready for bed <br/>
and has been doing that for awhile now. (about 8 months, i think).<br/>
We don&#39;t feel comfortable with Mars being downstairs either alone or with his brother for <br/>
what could be long periods of time without us.<br/>
They get along really well but Sett is not ready (his determination which was also our <br/>
guess)to be alone with Mars on that level.<br/>
What we came up with was that Mars can stay downstairs as long as one of us (me or my <br/>
husband) are also down there.<br/>
After that, he has the choice of either coming up to our room with us where he can watch <br/>
t.v. or read or draw or whatever he wants that is on the quieter side of things till he falls <br/>
asleep<br/>
or <br/>
he can go to his room with one of us and do the same kinds of things till he falls asleep.<br/>
<br/>
He can also tell us when he&#39;s sleepy and or fall asleep down with us and then we&#39;d take <br/>
him up.<br/>
<br/>
The first night Mars fell asleep watching t.v (12:30 a.m.). and my husband, Adam, took <br/>
him up sometime after.<br/>
<br/>
The second night Mars said he was sleepy and ready to go up when Sett said he was ready <br/>
to go up(1:30 a.m.), but ended up fighting sleep once he was up there and saying he <br/>
wasn&#39;t ready so my husband brought him back down and he fell asleep playing mega man.<br/>
<br/>
Last night my husband was ready to go up. (Adam and I had talked about being aware of <br/>
when it was about 20-30 mins before we were absolutely ready to go to bed so that we <br/>
could help Mars transition from being downstairs to being upstairs.) <br/>
At 12:30 a.m. he started giving Marley time to adjust saying things like &quot;Mars, We&#39;re going <br/>
up in 30 mins, in 20 mins, in 10, in 5, in 3...&quot;. (This is what has worked best, transitions-<br/>
wise, for my guys in the past, giving time *warnings* so they know it&#39;s coming.)<br/>
Adam had been asking Marley what and where he would like to do/go-our room, his <br/>
room, books, gameboy, etc., but Mars was not interested in deciding.<br/>
So when the time came to go up, Mars freaked out  and started screaming and yelling and <br/>
kicking and refused to go up. <br/>
I had been asleep but woke up when I heard him and came down. I sat with him on the <br/>
couch and held him and listened to him and he told me how he was feeling and I listened <br/>
and gave him hugs and kisses. After he was in a calmner space, i started talking wiht him <br/>
about what his options were-of either our room or his and which did he want but he got <br/>
really upset again. Eventually I told him I was bringing him up to his room. He was still <br/>
screaming and was pretty upset and I laid him in his bed and laid with him untill he fell <br/>
asleep about 5 minutes later. Even as he was falling asleep he was saying &quot;mom, i&#39;m so <br/>
annoyed with you&quot; . (All of this, from when i came down to when he fell asleep, took about <br/>
20 mins.)<br/>
<br/>
What do i do now??? What did I do wrong???  We are working on putting a t.v. in the boy&#39;s <br/>
room as soon as we can, <br/>
but other than that I don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
Am I starting this too early?<br/>
Is it that I&#39;ve started this too late?<br/>
Help. Please :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39266549">I think others will probably have more specific, helpful advice. But i <br/>
didnt want to comment that when my son was around that age, he always <br/>
got more intense, more wound-up, more &quot;awake&quot; RIGHT before he&#39;d fall <br/>
asleep. If it seemed like he was &quot;bouncing off the walls&quot; or getting <br/>
super hyper sleep was sure to follow soon. It helped to do something <br/>
like lying in bed reading a book, or turning down the lights and <br/>
watching a video, because that would often induce sleep. Sometimes <br/>
though, if it seemed like we&#39;ve read for awhile and he still wasnt <br/>
sleeping, it meant it was too soon, and we got back up again. But he <br/>
did &quot;fight sleep&quot; until the last possible moment. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it would have been wrong to train him to go to sleep without  <br/>
protest by the clock.  Maybe not &quot;wrong&quot; right now, but in the  <br/>
longrun it would create in him the desire to be up, sneak to get up,  <br/>
stay up until daylight, and being up would be seen as &quot;mature&quot; and  <br/>
adult, and going to sleep would seem babyish.    That&#39;s not healthy,  <br/>
yet college kids everywhere show those symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even without a TV, can you get a CD player or tape player and find  <br/>
soothing stories or quiet music?<br/>
<br/>
Can you rock him to sleep or let him fall asleep next to you on the  <br/>
couch and leave him there, covered up?  Maybe he would like to fall  <br/>
asleep where people are and just stay there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You already don&#39;t have &quot;a bedtime&quot; as in a time by the clock that he  <br/>
&quot;has to&quot; go to bed, so when you say &quot;started this&quot; try to think  <br/>
clearly of what &quot;this&quot; is, to you.   And give it time.  It will be  <br/>
less new and he&#39;ll be less young every day.<br/>
