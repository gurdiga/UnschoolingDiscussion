&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve told her that she is welcome to baby sit here in our house<br/>
when I&#39;m home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best babysitter I ever had was a ten year old neighbor who used to kind <br/>
of flow back and forth between her house and ours, with her mom home and me <br/>
home.  That lasted three years, off an on (often when the girl needed money <br/>
or was bored).  She had little sisters too, and so Holly was THRILLED to &quot;go <br/>
with Amy&quot; anytime!  When it started, Holly was two, and she was very sad when <br/>
that family moved, when she was five or six.  She asked about them just the <br/>
other day, but I&#39;ve lost contact.<br/>
