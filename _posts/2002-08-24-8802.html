-=- &quot;It seems that for some people, it is also an equally important goal that<br/>
adults not exercise any influence over the learning process,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an unschooler write this, or say this, or <br/>
imply<br/>
it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it put forth in a put-down kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
I exert influence over other people&#39;s learning all the time, but I feel <br/>
skilled at pulling my blows.  And that only came from experience with going <br/>
on too long, or mis-guessing the direction of a question, or offering <br/>
unwanted help.<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA people often want to know more, and want some critique, but *just <br/>
enough,*  not too much, but if they get none at all, they can become <br/>
resentful.  Lots of &quot;am I getting warm?&quot; experience there.<br/>
<br/>
I often send friends websites about stuff I know they&#39;re interested in.  If I <br/>
sent them five a day they&#39;d be irritated.  One once in a while is different.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I &quot;taught a lesson.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This morning Holly was in Keith&#39;s office, and I was sitting around in there <br/>
too, and she was playing with Fisher Price people (old style, our big dusty <br/>
collection).  <br/>
<br/>
She asked if horses ate meat.<br/>
<br/>
Keith said no, they were vegetarians and talked about their teeth.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s learning to read better and she likes etymology, so wrote down<br/>
herbivore<br/>
carnivore and <br/>
omnivore.<br/>
<br/>
I told her mammals are categorized with those terms, and for herbivore I said <br/>
horses and cows, for carnivore I said dogs and cats, and for omnivore I said <br/>
people, Keith said bears, and some birds.  I said birds weren&#39;t mammals.  (So <br/>
I didn&#39;t want them on my list &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
And I told her &quot;herb&quot; was plant, &quot;vore&quot; had to do with eating, and when <br/>
people were REALLY hungry they were voracious.  Carne, I said &quot;like chile con <br/>
carne, &#39;with meat&#39;&quot; (and I could have said lots more but didn&#39;t).  &quot;Omni&quot; I <br/>
said &quot;omnimax, omnibus, omnipresent&quot; and then I wrote down vegetarian and <br/>
said when it&#39;s a choice for moral, religious or health reasons they say <br/>
they&#39;re vegetarian, not that they&#39;re herbivorous.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I was all done.<br/>
<br/>
I would have done that for anyone new to the language.  I analyze word <br/>
particulars for my friend Wolfgang all the time, because he&#39;s still learning <br/>
English and sometimes gets stuck for figuring something out.<br/>
