 </span></blockquote>As compared to what? The public schools? Hang in there - breathe deep. You&#39;re <br/>
on the right track - get the poor kid OUT of institutions and with his loving <br/>
family. Don&#39;t make him feel like he&#39;s a &quot;patient&quot; or a &quot;victim&quot; if you can <br/>
possibly help it - that doesn&#39;t do him any good. Surely you&#39;ve read &quot;The Gift <br/>
of Dyslexia&quot; right? Do that first. Then - don&#39;t make his learning other stuff <br/>
dependent on reading -- get into movies and books on tape and real-life <br/>
experiences, etc. Base life on his strengths - stop basing things on his <br/>
weaknesses. Let him heal. Let him grow strong and confident. Support him as <br/>
he is!!!!<br/>
