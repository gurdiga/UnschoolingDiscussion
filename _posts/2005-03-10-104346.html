<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197973247"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My question is my sons. they want to play<br/>
&gt; viedo games all day long and not do anything else. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are other people on this list that could tell you the same thing I<br/>
want to, but they will say it nicer and more coherently.  But this statement<br/>
made me want to share.  :-)  You could be describing my two kids, ages 10<br/>
and 12.  Instead of seeing this behavior as being a negative thing, I look<br/>
at it this way:  They are doing their work, their way.  How much of your day<br/>
is spent doing what someone else tells you to do?  I don&#39;t spend one minute<br/>
of my day that way!  My husband and kids can ask me to do something, but I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t feel like I have to!  I get to decide how I will spend my<br/>
day--how long I will hang out with the kids, how hard I will work and at<br/>
what, how long I sit around and read after lunch, whether I want to take a<br/>
shower or not!  Why should your kids do anything other than what they want?<br/>
Are they not allowed to be just as free as adults?<br/>
<br/>
Your sons had no control over their lives when they went to school, and now<br/>
they are doing what they want to do.   They may be just lowering their<br/>
stress levels by playing video games, which is also a good thing!  Beats<br/>
drugs, alcohol, and hitting each other.<br/>
<br/>
And if you will slow up and spend some time with your sons, you will<br/>
probably find out they are learning the entire time they are at it!  Their<br/>
gaming is also probably part of their social lives, too.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138340000">Thankyou Deirdre, i really appreciate what you wrote.<br/>
i guess what i really need to do is stop and smell the<br/>
coffee. i never really thought about it the way you<br/>
all have suggested.. from now on i will pay more<br/>
attention to what they are doing and saying than what<br/>
i want them to do. Question. what about math or<br/>
english. He hates reading. what do you suggest on<br/>
that. he wants to make video games later in life and<br/>
that requires alot of math. any suggestions. im really<br/>
new at this. and i really am going to work on this.<br/>
thankyou all again nancy<br/>

Don&#39;t press him to read.  It will only make him hate it worse (and not  like <br/>
you much, either).<br/>

<br/>
Books on tape.<br/>
<br/>
Movie versions of books.<br/>
<br/>
Books about his interests. If he doesn&#39;t want them read to him, leave <br/>
them out so he can browse. Don&#39;t worry if he just looks at the <br/>
pictures.<br/>
<br/>
Gaming guides to his favorite games. Point him to <br/>

Instead of reading, have your goal be a positive experience with print.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he wants to make video games later in life and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a child were interested in building would you worry that he didn&#39;t <br/>
know how to use a power saw? Would you find someone to give him power <br/>
saw lessons so that in the future when he was old enough and interested <br/>
enough he&#39;d be able to use one?<br/>
<br/>
A better way is to let him build. Let him play. Let him explore what <br/>
there is. As his interest builds find more outlets. (And when he starts <br/>
eyeing the power saw, you help him use it safely. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The really lousy thing about school math is that it gives us the idea <br/>
that &quot;real&quot; math can only be found in textbooks and only be learned by <br/>
dull repetition of things we barely understand until we get a glimmer <br/>
of what it all means.<br/>
<br/>
Real math gets learned as kids learn English: as a side effect of using <br/>
it to get what they want. They use their imperfect understanding and <br/>
the feedback helps them to figure out how to use it better. When kids <br/>
are using math for real they have a vested interest in the answer. <br/>
While a kid in school might see 34-17 and write 51 as the answer and <br/>
not care about the answer (it ends up in the trash either way), a child <br/>
in a store with $34 wanting to know how much they&#39;ll have after <br/>
spending $17 will know that $51 isn&#39;t right and will care that it isn&#39;t <br/>
right and they&#39;ll figure out why (or ask for help). At any rate they <br/>
care about how well they get the tool to work and will mess around with <br/>
it until they understand how to make it work. Just as a kid with a <br/>
hammer who is interested in building will eventually figure out how to <br/>
make a hammer drive nails in straight without previously having had <br/>
hammering lessons.<br/>

games and she said that the most important thing a kid could be doing <br/>
would be making up complex games - board games, card games, dice games <br/>
- making up all the rules, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If reading is still a problem you can also get a &quot;screen reader&quot;. The <br/>
ATT reading bar with the upgraded voices is very good BUT only works <br/>
with IE and costs money. If you use Firefox as your web browser then <br/>
there is a free add-on (foxy-voice) you can download that will read what <br/>
is on the screen. It will use the nicer ATT voices or the ones already <br/>
on windows. The ATT one works better (it just reads the screen, <br/>
foxyvoice only reads what you highlight...neither will read Flash) BUT <br/>
we are very mad at IE right now (bad spyware issues and a browser hijack <br/>
that took me about 20 hours to clear out) so ds is using Firefox as his <br/>
browser for now.<br/>
He mostly uses it to read though cheats and game FAQs. Wish we could <br/>
figure out a way to get the computer to read all the info in World of <br/>
Warcraft. I know ds is not experiencing the game as well as he could <br/>
because he can&#39;t read fast enough to follow the on-screen conversations <br/>
with other players..<br/>
