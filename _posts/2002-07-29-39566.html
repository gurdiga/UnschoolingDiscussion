<div id="ygrps-yiv-835850711">Hello, I mostly lurk and gain inspiration which I need a lot of. As far as<br/>
unschooling goes my gut says yes let them be but my upbringing (music<br/>
prodigy, swim team, early reader, ivy league parents etc.) keeps getting in<br/>
the way. This is my current struggle my daughter 8 loves to play the piano.<br/>
She has been tinkering for several years and plays for hours. She is mostly<br/>
self taught I have helped her read music when she asked or showed her what<br/>
little I know when she said ok. Any way for the last year she has been<br/>
playing the same  little  homemade ditties and her playing hasn&#39;t really<br/>
changed. She still plays a lot but she does ist in a mor perfunctory way and<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to enjoy it as much. I asked if she would like to take lessons<br/>
to learn some new things. She said very adamently NO. It is very hard for me<br/>
to watch her once joyful playing become stale. I have met a teacher who<br/>
seems very open, pleasant and gifted at teaching composition. I think My dd<br/>
would enjoy doing some new things but she seems to feel that lessons of<br/>
anysort are icky. I couldn&#39;t school her if I wanted to. SHe really goes her<br/>
own way on everything. Does any one have any suggestions for me. Maybe I<br/>
just need some hand holding. Thank you all you are an ongoing inspiration.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling parents definitely guide.  But perhaps you might consider how<br/>
much you are including in the term &#39;guidance&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago, I showed my son the moves for chess.  He&#39;s learned a<br/>
lot of theory since then, and I&#39;ve guided his learning by helping him find<br/>
some chess books that are at his playing level, and spending time playing<br/>
&#39;talking-games&#39; with him (where we discuss why we&#39;d make the move we&#39;re<br/>
going to make).  I would also say that I&#39;ve guided his Opa recently in<br/>
selecting birthday gifts for my son that would be appreciated.  I reminded<br/>
him of Tim&#39;s recent interests, told him what book series Tim is currently<br/>
working his way through, and advised on what lego sets we already own.<br/>
<br/>
In neither case did I require anything.  I never told Tim that his chess<br/>
game would improve greatly if he spent a certain amount of time each day<br/>
playing, and it never, ever goes over well with grandparents if I tell them<br/>
they need to buy THIS gift.  I guide.  I don&#39;t direct.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that&#39;s unschooling.  Now, for me, it was easy to get used to not<br/>
asking that my son do certain things each day.  I just stopped asking and<br/>
that was that.  It&#39;s taken longer for me to become accustomed to not<br/>
thinking in terms of what is educational and what isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just legos,<br/>
and if I think about it, I can easily find what&#39;s educational about playing<br/>
legos.  But I no longer do, I have become comfortable with everything being<br/>
part of my son&#39;s education.<br/>

Subject: how to unschool when your child wants to go to school<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschoolers for a few years now, it&#39;s a philosophy I have<br/>
embraced since before I had children and my husband joined me in this<br/>
attitude with very little persuasion.  Our oldest child is also a dedicated<br/>
unschooler, he can&#39;t imagine having to sit in<br/>
a classroom and do what is told, no time for spontaneous reading or cookie<br/>
baking or trips to the beach.<br/>
The problem we are having is our youngest, who sees her friends (all ages)<br/>
getting ready to go back to school and going for the first time.  She wants<br/>
to be just like them, she loves to sit at the table with assignments and<br/>
wants to be a part of the lunch box<br/>
carrying crowd.  I&#39;ve tried to handle some of this by supplying her with<br/>
&quot;school type&quot; books (she loves them and does them with no prompting from me<br/>
although she really wants me to say &quot;ok, now it&#39;s time for...&quot;) and when<br/>
school starts again in this area I want<br/>
to do something with her (and older son) to help take the sting out of her<br/>
friends not being around much anymore. (Even the ones who homeschool are<br/>
&quot;going back to school.&quot;)  Maybe a trip to the dinosaur exhibit at the<br/>
Natural History Museum?<br/>
Anyway the point of this is to ask:  What do you do when the whole family is<br/>
unschooling and one doesn&#39;t want to?<br/>
<br/>
Kate<br/>

to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human<br/>
being can fight and never stop fighting.  e.e.cummings<br/>

Subject: RE: how to unschool when your child wants to go to school<br/>
<br/>
I may be totally off line here, keep in mind we are very new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
However, wouldn&#39;t letting her go to school, be child lead learning, and<br/>
letting her follow her own path?<br/>
<br/>
I have always thought that if one of my sons actually wanted to go to<br/>
school, that I should just let them go, but also if they wanted to come back<br/>
home, they could do that also.<br/>
<br/>
All the friends my boys have, go to public school, and my boys have no<br/>
desire whatsoever to go to school with them, so far, but I have always<br/>
envisioned that one of them may want to just try it out and see what it is<br/>
like.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are your daughter, if allowed to just try it out would not like it<br/>
anyway.  Maybe ask her what she thinks it would be like, so you know EXACTLY<br/>
what it is she thinks she is missing by not going to school.  Is it the<br/>
clothes shopping before hand, the new notebook, etc..??  Is it the<br/>
socialization, because there would not be as much as she probably thinks<br/>
there is, with her coming from an unschooling family.  Maybe she wants a<br/>
&quot;desk&quot; of her own, for &quot;school&quot;.  Is she involved in any extra-curricular<br/>
activities with her friends, like gymnastics, sports, or dance, etc...??<br/>
<br/>
Just my meanderings for the morning........mind you I am barely awake......<br/>

Subject: Re: how to unschool when your child wants to go to school<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was like that after having been in school<br/>
for two years.  It was hard for her to break away.<br/>
She felt that she was missing something.  I tried to<br/>
fight her and insist on unschooling, but she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
do it.  So I gave her what she wanted.  I would take<br/>
her in September and do the school shopping thing.<br/>
She loved it.  I even bought her a new lunch box and<br/>
made her lunch.  I gave her assignments and graded her<br/>
(of course she always got A&#39;s).  I got already made up<br/>
worksheets on enchantedlearning.com and would give<br/>
those to her.  Every year when it came time for school<br/>
to start she would go through this, than one year she<br/>
said I feel sorry for kids who are in school and I am<br/>
glad I am home.  But she had to come to it in her own<br/>
time.  One thing I have learned, just because I<br/>
believe something and have believed it from the start<br/>
does not necessarily mean my children will.  They also<br/>
need to be given time to process things in life and<br/>
come to terms with it at their own time.  Even though<br/>
our kids are home with us society still influences<br/>
them a bit.  So homeschool her where she is at.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This time last year, Jack saw all his neighborhood friends getting ready for<br/>
kindergarten. He came home one day all excited and informed me that school<br/>
was starting soon and didn&#39;t I think it was about time to take him? He was<br/>
actually shocked when I told him that no, I didn&#39;t think it was time, nor<br/>
did<br/>
I plan on ever taking him. (Needless to say, Jack went to school last year!)<br/>
He begged, he pleaded, he told us exactly why he wanted to go to school and<br/>
Darin and I finally agreed that he would go, so he did. School wasn&#39;t all<br/>
Jack thought it would be, he had to get up early (Jack likes his sleep) he<br/>
had to go on days Moly and I were doing things he would rather be doing...<br/>
By<br/>
Christmas time, Jack was beginning to do the *I don&#39;t wanna* thing every<br/>
morning. Don&#39;t get me wrong, he loved being in school, he just hated the<br/>
hours. After a year of it, he was glad to be done. He realizes he plays with<br/>
his friends more after school than during school, he doesn&#39;t have to miss<br/>
out<br/>
on what Moly and I are doing, and he can get those much needed zzz&#39;s that he<br/>
loves so much.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend school, but it wasn&#39;t the worst experience of our lives.<br/>
He<br/>
didn&#39;t come out damaged, he wasn&#39;t labeled... (although I was sure he would<br/>
be) I don&#39;t know if he learned anything he wasn&#39;t already learning here at<br/>
home but he took from it what it offered and thankfully left the rest. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t unschooling, but it certainly wasn&#39;t forced either.<br/>

bother stopping to convince yourself that whatever the kid is doing is<br/>
worthwhile. And when that step is reached, it is very liberating.<br/>
<br/>
I still sometimes do think about it - just because it is INTERESTING to<br/>
think<br/>
about what the child is getting out of whatever she is doing.  But, with no<br/>
anxiety attached to the thoughts, no judgement, it is very different than<br/>
when just starting out unschooling.<br/>

&lt;&lt; there have been some great quotes lately about unschooling on the e-mail<br/>

                   please let me know &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you do it in way of a review, meaning you then tell people how they can<br/>
join this e-mail loop, then nobody can say a thing!<br/>
<br/>
And even if you didn&#39;t, there are over 800 people on this list and I&#39;m<br/>
pretty<br/>
sure that the law says what arrives in your mailbox (real mail or virtual)<br/>
is<br/>
yours to share.  Doesn&#39;t mean to swipe (which is not what you had in mind<br/>
anyway!), but to say &quot;So&#39;n&#39;so said this in public:  &#39;blah--------&#39;  &quot; is<br/>
wholly legal and pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
People who don&#39;t want to be quoted shouldn&#39;t say anything in public.<br/>

Subject: RE: how to unschool when your child wants to go to school<br/>
<br/>
Yes Sandra, I agree with what you said.<br/>
<br/>
Another point that leads to the fears of unschooling, is the HUGE amount of<br/>
curriculum suppliers, and &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot;, Sylvan Learning Center, and<br/>
others, that tend to make parents feel like they are never doing &quot;enough&quot;<br/>
for their children.<br/>
<br/>
I at first felt this pressure.  I would scour the net and catalogs for this<br/>
and that, and always thought I had found something better.  We are in the<br/>
process of moving AGAIN, and AGAIN, I am packing up all this stuff we paid<br/>
so much money for that either hardly or never was used, or was a total waste<br/>
of time or money.  They have to be making so much money off all these<br/>
homeschool curriculum materials, really.<br/>
<br/>
Of course one of the first questions of other homeschoolers, when I began to<br/>
homeschool was &quot;oh, what curriculum are you using?&quot;.<br/>

Subject: Intro and math question<br/>
<br/>
Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lurked enough and have thoroughly enjoyed the dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list after 1.5yrs of homeschooling my 8yr old ds. I took him<br/>
out of school half way through 1st grade when he was showing signs of<br/>
depression. He was unstimulated and frustrated. He has huge frustrations<br/>
with reading and writing (we are looking into vision testing)but is<br/>
conceptually advanced in most areas. The crunch came when the school<br/>
principal refused to accept his giftedness and stated &quot;I will not rearrange<br/>
MY school for your child&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We have been feeling our way through homeschooling ever since. I have now<br/>
come to the conclusion that I have been trying to &quot;school&quot; too much. I need<br/>
to find a way to get him excited about learning again. I will go along with<br/>
any interests he has but he is not very self led. He seems to need quite<br/>
alot of guidance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that total &quot;unschooling&quot; is our destination but I know that<br/>
finding the right balance for my son (and his siblings) IS my destination. I<br/>
am also sure that a large degree of unschooling has got to be the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Hence my plea to everyone out there! With all your experiences I hoping you<br/>
can give me some guidance. I&#39;m someone who likes to see something produced<br/>
on paper (workbooks look great to me although I&#39;ve never considered using a<br/>
curriculum - he may as well be in school!!) but I know they are not for him.<br/>
I want to inspire him again. I can see ways and means of unschooling most<br/>
subjects (art, history, science,geography etc)since it seems to me that they<br/>
are things we talk about and do as a family anyway. You&#39;ve probably guessed<br/>
my problem; MATH. I can see introducing concepts while cooking and crafting<br/>
and in general everyday life but how do you unschool the formulas for<br/>
calculating the circumference of a circle, Pythagoras and higher Trig functi<br/>
ons, calculus, physics functions etc? Do I just have to leave this until he<br/>
picks them up himself - I think I&#39;m scared to do that. He likes math and<br/>
science and these higher functions  are going to be important to be able to<br/>
manipulate the<br/>
 concepts that he already understands.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any help. Please be gentle with me, I&#39;m new to this ;.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
Louise<br/>
<br/>

You may well find that unschooling is not for you and your family, but you<br/>
won&#39;t *really* know unless you jump in with both feet.  To do that, you<br/>
need to stop thinking in terms of school subjects at all, and start<br/>
thinking in terms of what will help your son explore the things he&#39;s<br/>
interested in.  If he&#39;s really interested in science and math, he&#39;s going<br/>
to be asking questions about those things.  You can help him go from one<br/>
question to the next and show him how they all connect.  If he really needs<br/>
calculus and physics, etc. to do what he wants to do, then you can help him<br/>
find ways to learn those things.  But start with where he is now and where<br/>
he wants to go now.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the reason I&#39;m jumping in here is that thinking in terms of school<br/>
subjects really got in the way of my own understanding of unschooling, and<br/>
I started out thinking I was a radical unschooler.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Subject: RE: vision therapy<br/>
<br/>
Louise,<br/>
<br/>
Our family is too new to unschooling to give any advice.<br/>
<br/>
However, regarding vision, we are quite well informed.  Our three sons all<br/>
have glasses for varying reasons.  Our younges is legally blind without<br/>
glasses, and 20/60 with them, he has extreme astigmatism and a crossed eye<br/>
and wears thick bi-focal glasses.  Our middle guy is not so bad, and our<br/>
oldest has bi-focals with a very weak prescription.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we have discovered Vision Therapy, and it has done wonders for our<br/>
children.  Vision Therapy is not only for children with extreme vision<br/>
problems such as our youngest two.  They use VT to treat ADD, and similar<br/>
problems.  There is great information on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
One good source is www.alderwoodvisiontherapy.com and www.visiontherapy.org.<br/>
There are other great sites as well.  www.children-special-needs.org.<br/>
<br/>
You may or may not be interested in the subject, but since you mentioned it,<br/>
I thought I would share.<br/>

Subject: vision<br/>
<br/>
Our child was diagnosed with ADD and learning disabilities. We have spent<br/>
hours and hours tutoring him and working with him individually.  After<br/>
three years of special help, he still can&#39;t spell to save his life.  Well,<br/>
I finally got smart.  After being reassured by learning specialists umpteen<br/>
times that he was not dyslexic, I decided to take him for an eye exam at<br/>
the University of Houston Eye Institute, despite the fact he&#39;d had previous<br/>
eye exams in school.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold, he is very far sighted.  He&#39;s been struggling to compensate<br/>
for years, and eeked by.  Had we known three years ago, he&#39;d have had quite<br/>
a different experience in school, and probably would have been reading<br/>
quite well by now, and his whole attitude toward school would have been<br/>
quite different.<br/>
<br/>
Before you accept any learning disability diagnosis, get the vision and<br/>
neurology checked.<br/>

Is there a way to do vision therapy on your own?   It will be so costly to<br/>
take our daughter, esp. if there isn&#39;t a guarantee for end results.  She&#39;s 6<br/>
1/2, and we found out too late with eyes also.<br/>

I don&#39;t think 6 1/2 is &quot;too late&quot; by any means.  Most children don&#39;t read<br/>

Oh, I don&#39;t really mean &quot;too late&quot; for reading and such.  But after<br/>
researching on the net and such on her condition(ambloypia), its best to<br/>
diagnois in the early years to improve your chances on better eyesight.<br/>
Wasn&#39;t until 6 months ago, that the school caught it, when the pediatrician<br/>
all these years has said nothing was wrong.<br/>
Hopefully she will do better with mom and learning one on one, then she<br/>
would have in school...  I just hope I have the patience I need, she is an<br/>
extreme hyper child...but that&#39;s what makes her special!<br/>

own way on everything. Does any one have any suggestions for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I best idea is for YOU to play more.  Play various little things for just a <br/>
few minutes a day.  Brush up on some of your old favorite easy-stuff (not <br/>
some zoomy thing she couldn&#39;t begin to  comprehend).  Or just go in and do <br/>
scales and the kind of vocal-exercise scale things (cdefgfedc-c&#39;-c) and <br/>
change keys and go up by halfsteps.  <br/>
<br/>
When she hears other tricks and trills she might add some to her own mix, or <br/>
she might watch you and ask how you did that.<br/>
<br/>
I see lots of parents who can play an instrument and never, ever do.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was playing recorder last night on the deck while he was grilling <br/>
dinner.  Today at  noon we have two friends (men in their 30&#39;s) coming over <br/>
to practice some Renaissance stuff--dance pieces and some combo reed <br/>
organ/cello/recorder/vocal.  We have an SCA-event target, vaguely--to be able <br/>
to play at a couple of local winter events, just as background music.  My <br/>
personal goal is to find enough two and three part stuff that any combination <br/>
of us could pick up this little set of music and play for 20 minutes.  <br/>
Preferably a set of us not including ME.  <br/>
<br/>
But my point is, we&#39;re doing it for our own enjoyment, and the kids will be <br/>
in the house to hear it, but we won&#39;t say &quot;Come and sit and listen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We won&#39;t have to.  They&#39;ll pass through.  They&#39;ll listen outside, and they&#39;ll <br/>
have half a dozen other friends here because it&#39;s Kirby&#39;s 16th birthday!<br/>
<br/>
If  music is just for kids, kids won&#39;t want it as much as if it&#39;s a living, <br/>
vital thing for PEOPLE.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 8 year old boy is the exact same way about art.  He&#39;s been drawing <br/>
since he could hold a pencil almost, and used to admire art wherever we <br/>
went and called himself an artist and wanted to be an artist when he <br/>
grows up.  He would draw for hours and hours on long car trips, and <br/>
spent a lot of time drawing in front of the TV and watching Pappyland. <br/>
 &lt;g&gt; But I haven&#39;t seen him draw much in the last year, and his drawings <br/>
are perfunctory stick figures, mostly.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a creative break.  I think drawing was his &quot;life&#39;s work&quot; <br/>
for at least 5 years, and he&#39;s learned all he can from it for now, and <br/>
is just not interested.  He sucked the experience dry.  He may never <br/>
draw like that again, but he might move on to painting, or clay or tile <br/>
mosaics someday.  <br/>
<br/>
What do I do about it?  Be thankful that all my new notepads are no <br/>
longer filled up with drawings before I can use them (and cherish the <br/>
old ones that are), and keep him supplied in baseballs.  Because now his <br/>
all-time consuming passion is baseball, which co-existed with drawing <br/>
all these years, but has come to the forefront in a big way in the last <br/>
few.  He even begged me to re-do his room in a baseball theme (instead <br/>
of nicely drawn lighthouses &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
<br/>
The great thing about baseball is he will actually read books about it!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816436375"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hello, I mostly lurk and gain inspiration which I need a lot of. As far as<br/>
&gt;unschooling goes my gut says yes let them be but my upbringing (music<br/>
&gt;prodigy, swim team, early reader, ivy league parents etc.) keeps getting in<br/>
&gt;the way. This is my current struggle my daughter 8 loves to play the piano.<br/>
&gt;She has been tinkering for several years and plays for hours. She is mostly<br/>
&gt;self taught I have helped her read music when she asked or showed her what<br/>
&gt;little I know when she said ok. Any way for the last year she has been<br/>
&gt;playing the same  little  homemade ditties and her playing hasn&#39;t really<br/>

&gt;to learn some new things. She said very adamently NO. It is very hard for me<br/>
&gt;to watch her once joyful playing become stale. I have met a teacher who<br/>

&gt;just need some hand holding. Thank you all you are an ongoing inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra had some good suggestions.  Another possibility would be for *you* <br/>
to take a few lessons with this teacher, not inviting her to listen but <br/>
scheduling the lesson for when she&#39;ll be around.  Or, she might just not be <br/>
ready for lessons.<br/>
A young friend of mine was kind of like this.  He was offered lessons and <br/>
didn&#39;t want them.  Then at one point (age 9) he went along to his sister&#39;s <br/>
lessons and then came home and played everything she had been taught.  His <br/>
parents offered again, and he just took off.  After a couple of years, he <br/>
started on violin.  He progressed rapidly and then his teacher said he <br/>
should play viola because we needed them in our orchestra.  It took him <br/>
about a week to get good enough to join us.  Before that, I used to take <br/>
him with me to orchestra rehersals, and he would follow the scores and <br/>
watch the conductor.  He was also composing during this time.  I always <br/>
assumed he would either become a concert pianist, an orchestral violinist, <br/>
a conductor, or a composer.  Then he discovered fiddle music.  At age 15, <br/>
he was making good money fiddling and also accompanying fiddlers on the <br/>
keyboard.  Now at 18, he&#39;s in a very good fiddle band, touring, making CDs, <br/>
and making a living.  And he *still* could go back and do any of those <br/>
other things I mentioned at some point.<br/>
<br/>
All this to say once again that they&#39;ll do it when they&#39;re ready.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and please remember to highlight and delete everything in the digest <br/>
*except* what you&#39;re actually replying to.  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867132703">I am absolutely certain he would enjoy that.  But where would I put <br/>
them?  lol.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s started a collection of McFarlane baseball figures (famous <br/>
players).  They&#39;re mostly limited editions, so he&#39;s got a catcher, a <br/>
batter, and a pitcher.  We have a homemade Lego table that just happens <br/>
to have a green felt floor.  As soon as he gets his room cleaned up <br/>
today, we&#39;re digging that out and are going to paint a diamond on it. <br/>
 I&#39;m sure he will spend hours dreaming up baseball scenarios with those <br/>
three players, until they come out with a few fielders and shortstop.<br/>
<br/>
He and his father took a baseball trip to St. Louis last year, and I&#39;m <br/>
planning one for them on the sly for opening day next year.  He&#39;s been <br/>
in quite a few major league parks.  Way more than I or his brothers had <br/>
ever been to before they were 9.  <br/>
<br/>
We just spent about 2 hours in the JC Penney outlet looking for a <br/>
baseball (only) blanket/comforter/duvet to go with the Arizona <br/>
Diamondbacks sheets he found on clearance.  At Wal-Mart after that, he <br/>
spent 15 minutes talking to the guy with the airbrush t-shirt stand how <br/>
much it would cost to airbrush a giant baseball on a comforter, because <br/>
we couldn&#39;t find anything appropriate to fit his bed.  <br/>
<br/>
His oldest brother helped him paint real infield lines on the grass in <br/>
the front yard, and since I mowed it all off, it&#39;s time to repaint. <br/>
 This time, he says, they won&#39;t forget the batters box!  Our new <br/>
lanscaping even has a dugout (a bench) along the 3rd base line!<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, he doesn&#39;t really *need* another outlet for this <br/>
baseball obsession, but I&#39;ll keep the models in mind in case he runs out <br/>
of ideas!  lol.  Thanks.  :)<br/>
