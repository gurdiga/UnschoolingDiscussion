<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002400197">I have a question.  My sons are really attached to this one friend.  He is <br/>
about their age and they love to play together.  He adores my boys and they <br/>
adore him.  He is in school so we work around that and go over on the <br/>
weekends some times.  <br/>
<br/>
My question has to do with his family.  We are friends with the boys parents <br/>
and his mother works in my husbands office so we see each other frequently.  <br/>
She has been saying things like &quot;you should leave Dallen and Phillip here <br/>
with us sometimes.&quot;  &quot;I have read that it is good for kids and the parents to <br/>
be away from each other.&quot;  &quot;Bring the boys over here when you are working on <br/>
the deck so they won&#39;t be in the way.&quot;  Etc.  I tell her that it isn&#39;t our <br/>
style of parenting.  I never use baby-sitters.  That is just how we do it.  <br/>
My boys aren&#39;t in the way.  We are a family and enjoy doing things as a <br/>
family and our relationship as a couple is just fine.  <br/>
<br/>
How do I handle her repeated remarks without hurting any feelings?  I have <br/>
been trying to have her son over here more so the topic won&#39;t come up.  She <br/>
has also started up with the team sports thing.  Her son is 7 and in <br/>
tee-ball, basket ball, soccer etc.  I tell her that my boys aren&#39;t interested <br/>
in that stuff.  They do not like competitive sports.  We were talking about <br/>
how the kids run in the wrong direction sometimes, etc., and I said &quot;well it <br/>
is all in fun.&quot;  She said no there are parents who take this stuff very <br/>
seriously and get mad at the kids etc.  I responded ... that is part of the <br/>
reason that I am glad my boys aren&#39;t into that.  She said that it is good for <br/>
kids to be on team sports and wants my boys to watch sometime so that they <br/>
will become interested.<br/>
<br/>
I get the feeling that she thinks my boys are sheltered and I control <br/>
everything.  I don&#39;t want to hurt any feelings and she still works for my DH. <br/>
 But I want her to keep her mouth shut.  I don&#39;t say anything about her <br/>
parenting style.  I could say a lot.  She spanks her son and threatens to all <br/>
the time.  Another reason I would not let my boys be alone there.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway this has gotten way too long and I am ranting now instead of asking <br/>
the question.  Although the venting felt good.<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

think there&#39;s any way to stop the offers without giving offense.  I <br/>
always just kind of let it slide by without saying no, just not really <br/>

the time.  Another reason I would not let my boys be alone there.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of talking to her, can&#39;t you just talk to your boys?<br/>
<br/>
If they WANT to be there, what&#39;s the worst that would happen?  They might see <br/>
the other boy be spanked and he might cry.  That would be pretty bad, but it <br/>
would probably keep your boys from ever even THINKING about spanking their <br/>
own kids.  And they would appreciate their own home more.<br/>
<br/>
If you prepare your boys with WHY a mom would press team sports (to justify <br/>
her own kid&#39;s activities, or whatever) and how it&#39;s perfectly FINE to just <br/>
smile, or to tell her straight out they&#39;re not interested in playing soccer <br/>
or whatever, it will be a strenghtening thing for them, and an empowering <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Holly hangs around with a couple of families whose parenting practices I <br/>
question, but Holly sees it for what it is, and is pretty analytical.<br/>
<br/>
There was an odd neighbor across the street who took care of his brother&#39;s <br/>
daughter and sometimes Holly played with them. I told a story last summer <br/>
about him telling the other girl NOT to get out of the swimming pool, and <br/>
Holly just finally getting out herself and fetching whatever toy or thing the <br/>
girl wanted.   His name was Gary.  He died on Thanksgiving.  We were out of <br/>
town.  We heard about it when we got back. He got sick the night before, went <br/>
to the hospital and died.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little relieved, sad to say.  He was very, very odd.   Sad for his <br/>
niece, whose dad has no idea how to relate to her and whose mom is who knows <br/>
where.  <br/>
<br/>
Just this morning Holly told me a story about one of her acting teachers <br/>
having told THEM a story.  It was that when her son turned 21, he had asked <br/>
her to get him a Play Station, but she said &quot;Of course I didn&#39;t, because he <br/>
was a grown man and didn&#39;t need a gaming system.&quot;  I just looked at Holly <br/>
with big eyes, and she said &quot;I know!&quot; and laughed.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly sees it clearly as someone who is teaching kids, who never much cared <br/>
what her own child wanted, and when he plainly asked for something, decided <br/>
herself that he didn&#39;t need it.  Even though he WAS at that point grown, she <br/>
was still deciding for him what he needed.<br/>
<br/>
Sad.<br/>
<br/>
So to roll back around to the question &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I think kids SHOULD see and be around some other kinds of families, with good <br/>
opportunities to discuss what they saw and heard and how they feel about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s the only problem I see as possible with letting it slide:  since<br/>
virtually everybody does use babysitters, your friends may assume there&#39;s<br/>
some reason you don&#39;t trust them with your kids.  That might hurt your<br/>
friendship in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
It might be worth being honest with them by telling them, once, that you<br/>
don&#39;t use babysitters and you simply prefer to do things as a family.  Sort<br/>
of the thanks, but no thanks reply.  The next time she asks, it&#39;s very easy<br/>
for you to remind her that you don&#39;t do that.  If she presses, remind her<br/>
that different parents do different things and are happy that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of people in the world who think I&#39;m wierd, but at least I know<br/>
that they come by that belief truthfully rather than through mistaken<br/>
impressions.<br/>

pen pal&#39;s family for a week (they lived in VT and we lived in CA).  He was a <br/>
child that was very home based.  When he came back from the visit having seen <br/>

&lt;&lt; Interestingly, the father of this family made a unannounced visit to our <br/>
family a few months later.  We figured out that since his daughter (the pen <br/>
pal) was not going to be &quot;allowed&quot; to work or attend school, he was scouting <br/>
Chris out as a potential marriage partner!!!!  We were all shocked, and I was <br/>
very dismayed at his sexist conversation in my home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the &quot;unannounced&quot; was so he could catch you being yourselves, so <br/>
you couldn&#39;t prettify the situation to &quot;sell&quot; your son better. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sheeeesh.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It really was weird, because we lived on base and were HARD to find.  We&#39;d <br/>
give friends directions like go 12.3 miles turn left, etc.  and there he was <br/>
knocking on the door.  <br/>
<br/>
Actually, we started with refreshments on the patio, and when he was so <br/>
insulting as to the roles of women, I excused myself and left Russ to deal <br/>
with him.<br/>

Strange.<br/>
