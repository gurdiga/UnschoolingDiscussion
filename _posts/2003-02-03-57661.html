&lt;&lt;  When they were reunited as adults the following &quot;coincidences&quot; <br/>
 were noted: both developed sinus headaches at age ten, which later became <br/>
 migraines, they used the same words to describe their pain. They had <br/>
 identical pulse rates and blood pressure.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Trevor said he heard a story about twins that had apparently lived in <br/>
different neighborhoods.  Both decided to mow their lawns on the same day and <br/>
both fell down from a heart attack at around the same time and ended up in <br/>
the same hospital. Weird if it&#39;s true. I don&#39;t know if we can find the actual <br/>
story..it was just something he was remembering.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
