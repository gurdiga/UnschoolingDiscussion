<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594689785">For years I accepted private responses, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to do <br/>

<br/>
The e-mail is below, but I want to say that I am not &quot;in the answering <br/>
business.&quot;   If it were a business I wouldn&#39;t be doing it voluntarily and every <br/>
single day.    I care more about the children than the parents, but that&#39;s how <br/>
unschooling works.   Someone who can be publically harsh about her own child <br/>
might want to accept someone simply pointing out that she had been so.<br/>

Too many parents care more about their own sensitive feelings than their <br/>
children&#39;s.   <br/>

I cannot believe your response to me. Of course i love to be with my son or <br/>
he would be in school !<br/>
<br/>
 Do you have a maid ? I don&#39;t . I HAVE to do other work. My hubby is rarely <br/>
around and it is just me and a HUGE house.<br/>
<br/>
 How dare you insinuate I should put him in school  ! You really should get <br/>
out of the answering business if you can&#39;t be supportive. WHat kind of example <br/>
did you just set for the unschooling community ? Not a nice one.<br/>

==================================================================<br/>
<br/>
I offered, freely, links to information by MANY unschoolers, every single one <br/>
of whom HAS found a way to live happily with children and has shared that <br/>
freely and generously.<br/>
<br/>
That is not something for me to need to suffer insult about.<br/>

<br/>
You are wonderful in the &quot;answering&quot; business!  Ok yeah, so I&#39;m a fan. <br/>
<br/>
I have read your writings for years and found them some of the most <br/>
encouraging I&#39;ve ever read. <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean the words won&#39;t zing the old ego.  Your words are <br/>
edifying for the very fact that you do not go around Robin Hood&#39;s barn.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that came from the idea that he didn&#39;t have a barn because some <br/>
people put out a lot of words without saying anything meaningful.  That<br/>
<br/>
is not you.  You write for a purpose. This is why from the comfort of<br/>
my <br/>
home before my computer screen I have entertained ideas that have not <br/>
been customary for me.  It hasn&#39;t always been comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
This is no one&#39;s fault.  If I express myself in a similar language to <br/>
that which you use, which I sometimes do, I find myself alienating my <br/>
listener.  Broader horizons are hard to come by.  It&#39;s like busting sod<br/>
<br/>
to plant crops on soil that has never been used for that purpose.  The <br/>
clods break down to make room for the crop.  If someone doesn&#39;t want <br/>
their &quot;soil/soul&quot; to be used for the purpose of unschooling or<br/>
whatever, <br/>
they decide to think about ideas, dismiss them, postpone them, abuse <br/>
them, etc.  There are a myriad of choices.  If someone is unschooling <br/>
who finds the work burdensome: never to unschool is one possibility,<br/>
not <br/>
to unschool now is another, finding out how it could work better in <br/>
one&#39;s life is yet another, unschooling incorrectly in an attempt to <br/>
lighten one&#39;s load (which doesn&#39;t work) is another choice, and there<br/>
are <br/>
a ton of others available.  They all wait in the wings.  We direct the <br/>
&quot;play.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me is an incredibly freeing idea.  It lightens the load,<br/>
<br/>
not the other way around.  One reason unschooling is not always a <br/>
freeing idea to people is that some of what passes for love of children<br/>
<br/>
is really not so.  It&#39;s ownership/narcissism, and many of people who <br/>
relate in such a way with children.. especially their own...  have no <br/>
real wish to deal with the truth of it.  This doesn&#39;t mean they have NO<br/>
<br/>
love for their children (which might be true but hopefully isn&#39;t).  <br/>
Rather it might mean there are other things in the way curtailing its <br/>
fullest expression.  I know that I can be highly insensitive to the <br/>
needs of others, and I don&#39;t want to do that, and so I know the first <br/>
step to avoiding insensitivity is to realize that it exists in ME... <br/>
unhappy thought.<br/>
<br/>
Children join the household mileau as people or as different types of <br/>
personal accessories or accomplishments for the ones in charge of the <br/>
household, or other unacceptable things rather than having the freedom <br/>
to be their own person.  Parents are more powerful than children, and<br/>
it <br/>
is a mistake not to realize the responsibility of this power.  Of<br/>
course <br/>
many parents never admit to the less humanizing roles they put in place<br/>
<br/>
for their children.  To do so requires dismissing the role of being in <br/>
charge in order to become fertile ground for other ideas that actually <br/>
appeal more, which mean pain and growth, that replace &quot;old soil&quot; with <br/>
&quot;new soul&quot; to shine life through.<br/>
