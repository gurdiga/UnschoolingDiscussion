<div id="ygrps-yiv-209889669">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time I&#39;ve posted here so I&#39;ll let you know a little about<br/>
us.  We have been un-schooling for almost 4 years now.  I was brought to<br/>
this by my oldest 18yo ds.  When he entered 9th grade he decided he was not<br/>
doing anything they told him to.  No school work at all.  I tried and tried<br/>
to work within the system and lo and behold discovered that the system was<br/>
all lip service.  I pulled him out.  He got his GED at 16, for which I had<br/>
to get special permission. He passed it the first time without studying<br/>
anything.  (why waste 4 years in high school if you can do this?)  Anyway<br/>
the next year my younger son came home and the next year my oldest daughter<br/>
and the next year my middle daughter.  My youngest will never set foot in a<br/>
ps.  I have a wonderfully supportive husband that I&#39;ve been married to for<br/>
almost 21 years.  <br/>
<br/>
Now as to un-schooling high schoolers.........My oldest never understood<br/>
what I was trying to do with his education.  He still feels like he is a<br/>
dropout instead of a drop in.  It is hard to watch someone not be able to<br/>
see all the good things about himself because he can&#39;t see outside the<br/>
mold.  We are still working on these things with him and trying to help<br/>
formulate a plan for his life.  My oldest daughter 14, is returning to ps<br/>
this fall.  I am very against this and she knows it.  We live in Conyers,<br/>
GA where the school shooting was.  She is doing a project on school<br/>
violence and social hierarchy(sp) of high schools this summer so maybe she<br/>
will be more prepared for what she is getting into.  There are very few<br/>
older home-schoolers in our area and as she put it the ones she has met are<br/>
weird(her word not mine).  She is VERY social and that is why she wants to<br/>
go back.  She tried to attend an eighth grade dance with a friend at a<br/>
local middle school and was asked to leave.  I don&#39;t want her in ps but I<br/>
have made her in charge of her education and this is how she wants to get<br/>
it.  I may have to pull her out if things get too bad but right now we are<br/>
going there.  <br/>
<br/>
The other three 12yo ds, 8yo dd, 4yo dd are happy at home.  They love<br/>
un-schooling and are happy to not be in ps.  I am the co-leader of an<br/>
inclusive support group and we are actively recruiting new members,<br/>
hopefully some will be older.  However, we live right outside Atlanta and<br/>
there are several groups that have teen activities that we can participate<br/>
in if we choose.  We pick and choose as the activities are open to all not<br/>
just the group that sponsors them.  That seems to be the best way to get<br/>
the teens together around here.<br/>
<br/>
Our local school system does not allow home-schoolers on campus or to<br/>
participate in any school function.  It seems to me that most of the<br/>
pschoolers I talk to don&#39;t enjoy these things anyway.  They are forced to<br/>
be in band etc.. so it is not enjoyable to them.  <br/>
<br/>
Well anyway that is my .02 cents on the subject.  I do think that<br/>
un-schooling high schoolers that have ps ingrained into them and haven&#39;t<br/>
properly de-schooled is a hard thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>

<br/>
So did I.<br/>
Well, I was 17, but I had spent more time out of school than in for the few<br/>
years before that. My home life was nuts and I wanted to start earning a<br/>
living. :)<br/>
<br/>
I then went to community college, learned to love learning again, became the<br/>
youngest manager ever at the retail store I worked in, and supported myself.<br/>
I regret not pushing through to finish my bachelor&#39;s degree right then and<br/>
there since I&#39;m still working on it at a snail&#39;s pace, but I don&#39;t regret<br/>
bypassing those highschool years at all.<br/>
<br/>
Funny that I mentioned this to dh last night. I didn&#39;t study at all. I<br/>
didn&#39;t even get stressed out over it or *try.* I just knew how to take<br/>
tests.<br/>
<br/>
I do tend to like the idea of kids learning to take tests somewhere during<br/>
the course of their schooling. I know many don&#39;t, and I understand why they<br/>
don&#39;t, but I have found it to be a rather valuable skill-albeit a deceptive<br/>
one. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I also would hope that my kids won&#39;t be in such a hurry to leave the house.<br/>
I hope they take their time deciding how they want to achieve their dreams.<br/>
Dh and I work hard to create an environment where I pray that they&#39;ll be<br/>
nurtured, mentally stimulated, supported, and somewhat contented~so I expect<br/>
that this will be the case~but we&#39;ll see won&#39;t we. LOL<br/>
