<div id="ygrps-yiv-228417844">If anyone is interested, we came up with a couple more good ideas for<br/>
holiday fun/gift giving.<br/>
<br/>
Our neighborhood is having a holiday party and cookie exchange today. So<br/>
we&#39;re baking up 5 dozen cookies to take, and then we get to exchange them<br/>
with everyone else. This means we can give out really nice assortments of<br/>
cookies in baskets as gifts to family without having to bake 10 different<br/>
kinds of cookies.<br/>
<br/>
And the discussion on this list about consumption sparked another good<br/>
Christmas present idea. I&#39;m getting plain canvas shopping bags from the<br/>
craft store and the kids and I are going to decorate them - maybe with<br/>
handprints - for the grandparents. So instead of getting another &quot;My<br/>
grandkids love me&quot; T-shirt, they can get something that they can use all<br/>
year &#39;round. And best of all, every time they use it, they save one more<br/>
plastic or paper shopping bag from being used, since the answer to the ol&#39;<br/>
&quot;Which is better, paper or plastic bags&quot; argument is really *neither*!<br/>

similar using the iron-on transfers that one can put through color <br/>
printers -- maybe a photo of the girls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401468562">We&#39;re going to try making picture frames out of old CDs.  We get the samples<br/>
all the time & have used them to make Christmas ornaments & center pieces.<br/>
Our Brownie troop we made decorations & put each girl&#39;s picture over the<br/>
center hole.  Glitter glue, in moderation looks great.  In our homeschool<br/>
group I brought the CDs & glitter glue.  One of the boys (6) must have put a<br/>
pound of glitter glue on while I was working with another child.  On the<br/>
center pieces we glued (hot glue) a small candle in the center & put small<br/>
decorative apples & greenery around it.  The reflections were great.</div>

Hi Robin...I did this for my step-father-of-sorts. We took a plain chef&#39;s<br/>
apron (from a craft store, all of $5) and had all the grandchildren put<br/>
their handprints on it in navy blue fabric paint. Then they signed by their<br/>
print (or we did). Now he looks very spiffy when he BBQ&#39;s.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! Well, probably not, but here&#39;s what else we&#39;re giving for Christmas:<br/>
<br/>
- Homemade jam<br/>
- Cookies<br/>
- Shopping bags, decorated<br/>
- Hand-rolled beeswax candles - you can get sheets of beeswax and kids as<br/>
young as 2 or 3 can roll candles with help. Try contacting a beekeeper or<br/>
honey company first to see if you can get the beeswax there, it&#39;s a whole<br/>
lot cheaper than getting it at crafts or specialty stores and much cheaper<br/>
than getting the kits. Our honey company even sells wick by the yard. After<br/>
you roll the candles, you can cut out designs from beeswax and stick them to<br/>
it, or roll them in glitter<br/>
- I made a CD for each of my parents and my sister of our favorite Christmas<br/>
music from when I was a kid. I downloaded it all from Napster.com and burned<br/>
it onto a CD. This is great because all of the Christmas albums we loved as<br/>
a kid are on vinyl so of course we don&#39;t listen to them anymore. You&#39;d be<br/>
surprised what you can find at Napster!<br/>
- A home-made ornament - this year we&#39;re doing wool angels. You take clean,<br/>
carded sheep&#39;s wool and tie some ribbon around it to make the head and body,<br/>
fluff out some wings and you have a lovely angel. Last year our ornament was<br/>
wreaths made from canning jar rings. Decorate with beads, felt,  and such to<br/>
make a wreath. You can put a picture in the middle too, just glue it to the<br/>
flat center part of the canning jar lid and glue it in<br/>
- Some home-grown mint tea. My son and I picked and dried all the mint and<br/>
lemonbalm and we&#39;re gift-packing it up. We&#39;re also trying to make some<br/>
mint/lemonbalm lotion or lip balm, we&#39;ll see if we get that done in time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Would you be willing to share your recipe for mint/lemonbalm lipbalm,<br/>

<br/>
Sure, though this will be the first time I&#39;ve made it, so I don&#39;t know yet<br/>
how it will come out. The person who posted this recipe says it makes a lot,<br/>
so have lots of jars and containers ready!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ingredients:<br/>
1 cup Apricot kernal oil or Almond Oil or Grapeseed oil  (I have been<br/>
infusing mint and lemonbalm in mine for several weeks now)<br/>
1/4 cup Beeswax;<br/>
1 tablespoon Honey<br/>
<br/>
1)Gently heat oil and melt the beeswax in it;<br/>
2)When beeswax completely melted, remove from heat and stir in the honey(at<br/>
this point, you can also add Natural Flavoring Oil, if you want(not<br/>
flavoring extract, because it is in an alcohol base and does not mix well<br/>
with oil)-orange or peppermint or spearmint or anise oil for example. Add a<br/>
few drops and taste, then add more if needed)<br/>
3) when flavored correctly, take one tablespoon of the mix and put it in the<br/>
refrigerator. It will cool quickly, allowing you to test the consistency<br/>
before pouring into small containers. If too hard, add more oil; if too<br/>
soft, add more beeswax.<br/>
4) Pour into containers and let harden.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-552315805">Thanks so much, Robin! I can&#39;t wait to try it myself. You&#39;ll have to let me<br/>
know how it turns out. My aunt gave me some homemade honey lemon lip balm a<br/>
few years back, and I like it so much more than the store bought kind.<br/>
