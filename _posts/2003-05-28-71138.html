<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629659676">I agree with Kristen&#39;s comments and experience re selling on ebay/half and<br/>
Amazon.  I like half.com b/c it is the quick and easy...pictures and product<br/>
descriptions are not usually needed.<br/>
<br/>
I like to list toys, games and educational tools on half.com&#39;s &quot;everything<br/>
else&quot; section.  Most are the items I am selling already the product set up,<br/>
but if it doesn&#39;t, then you can set up one.<br/>
<br/>
I currently have 60 items for sell on half.com and 10 items on ebay.  Most<br/>
are homeschooling items.  Email me privately if you are interested in a list<br/>
of items I am selling.  Susan</div>
