<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716497783">Yes, it&#39;s true, this is how I feel and I thought tonight a good opportunity to shout it out:) I have been reading and reading for four months now and now I just come on specifically to see what Sandra says. I don&#39;t know how you became this wonderful, but you truly are wonderful, (and I don&#39;t even know ya) I just feel so grateful to have come on here and been turned on to this way of thinking about my children. Just the whole TRUSTING our children is sooo empowering to them and to us. I keep saying to my two year old all the time now when she is trying to destroy her sister, &quot;come here, I like it when you are near me.&quot; and she feels so great about it, I want to be with her, and she wants to be with me too! This was Sandra&#39;s advise and I am so blessed:) Thanks , Kelli <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237682217">I don&#39;t really know what to say.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
People helped me unschool and so I&#39;m glad to pass it along.  I think it is SO <br/>
wonderful to give kids this incredible (and relatively inexpensive) gift.  I <br/>
think it will change the world, a little bit, and that&#39;s enough.  Lots of <br/>
people don&#39;t get to change the world, but every one of these unschooled kids <br/>
will affect the people around him or her, and even if it&#39;s just a little bit, <br/>
it will be a lot.  Some of them will unschool their kids.  Some of them will <br/>
be researchers, writers, politicians, doctors, bus drivers, and will carry on <br/>
REAL conversations with kids they meet.  <br/>
<br/>
I could go on.  Gradually over the days and months, I DO!<br/>
<br/>
This list is great (when it&#39;s not dangerously crazy, and even then there&#39;s <br/>
sometimes an interactive soap-opera greatness), and I&#39;m glad there are so <br/>
many others here whose stories we all get to read as they unfold!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words, Kelli (and those others, about the &quot;perspective&quot; <br/>
post, I saved those; thanks).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586908286">Well, all I can say is &quot;Ditto&quot; to this, also.<br/>
And I know in my heart that positive interaction with my kids is the best.  <br/>
