Description<br/>
This is list is open to all Pagan Parents whether you are currently <br/>
homeschooling your children or are thinking about it. Topics vary from <br/>
whether to homeschool or unschool to what curriculum is best for those who <br/>
chose to use it. But most of all I want this list to be about the pagan <br/>
children and the unique position they are facing. How can we help each other <br/>
help them to become well educated and responsible adults, pagan or not.<br/>
There will not be any flaming allowed, I don&#39;t have time forit and will <br/>
unsub you immediately. This is a friendly place for us to help each other.<br/>
