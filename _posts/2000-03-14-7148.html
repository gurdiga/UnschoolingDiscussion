<div id="ygrps-yiv-800541558">I need some friendly parenting advice:<br/>
<br/>
For about 6 months now my 7 year old daughter has complained of<br/>
non-descript cramps/tummy aches.  I am at my wit&#39;s end trying to figure<br/>
out the cause.  The doctor gave my daughter a general exam and ordered<br/>
routine tests and an ultrasound but nothing came up.  For a while I<br/>
wondered if she could suddenly be gluten or dairy sensitive and we tried<br/>
the appropriate diets with no success.  Still lots of cramps with no<br/>
real rhyme or reason, at all times of the day or night.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone shed any light on this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks very much,<br/>
Sonia<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Further to all the discussion re: baby diets and nursing and<br/>
introduction to solids etc. our situation with our children has always<br/>
involved late introduction to solids and child-led weaning at an<br/>
advanced age.  (So I am hoping this is not allergy-related!!!)</div>
