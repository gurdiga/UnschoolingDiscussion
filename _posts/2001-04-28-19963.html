 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with Juli, that giving money for every day chores<br/>
is the wrong message.  My feeling is that these things<br/>
need to be learned as a basic life skills kind of<br/>
thing.  Allowance is nice, because it keeps a kid<br/>
having to beg for every penny, which is demeaning and<br/>
frustrating.  For those extra funds they may want,<br/>
extra work is good.  Waxing the car, home repairs or<br/>
improvements, doing someone else&#39;s regular chores for<br/>
them, or babysitting siblings might all be good<br/>
examples of extra work, above and beyond normally<br/>
expected chores.  Another option is to compromise by<br/>
loaning the child the money, matching their funds with<br/>
yours, or other financial arrangements.  After all,<br/>
loans, grants and financial contracts are common in<br/>
adult life.<br/>
<br/>
The child does not have to stop at home when looking<br/>
for extra funds.  They can go into business for<br/>
themselves walking dogs, delivering papers, weeding<br/>
gardens, washing cars, and all the various other tasks<br/>
that kids have long hired themselves out for.  I think<br/>
encouraging problem solving and enterprise is a good<br/>
thing.  If money is what they want, I do not want them<br/>
to learn that it all flows from me and dad, as it most<br/>
certainly does not.<br/>

<br/>
     I can see this point.  With our kids, their allowance or pay (whatever <br/>
we&#39;re calling it and however we&#39;re figuring it at any given point) is so low <br/>
compared to almost everyone we know (only $6 a week for each of the three <br/>
older ones) and yet they never seem to be short on money because it seems <br/>
like there&#39;s not much they spend it on.  Justin, my almost 17 yr old, is very <br/>
seriously into music so he is getting to the point where he&#39;d like more.  But <br/>
he has a good acoustic guitar that we got him for his birthday last year (or <br/>
half got him...we kicked in about $200 and he kicked in about $150) and he <br/>
plays it about 3 or 4 hours a day.  And he&#39;s getting an electric guitar for <br/>
his upcoming birthday with the amp, which he put in all he had for and we <br/>
supplied the rest.  Jonathan and Kevin (my soon to be 13 yr olds) can hardly <br/>
ever think of anything they care to spend their money on so they have about <br/>
$100 each right now.  Also, they do all get money for birthdays and Christmas <br/>
from relatives and from us.<br/>
     I find that unschooling and living out in the boondocks have brought <br/>
about this with our kids.  They like getting stuff from garage sales as much <br/>
as I do so we hardly spend anything on clothes anymore.  We do all love books <br/>
so some money goes to that when we can&#39;t find something at a garage sale or <br/>
library.  Kevin loves Civil War history so he has spent money on books about <br/>
that.<br/>
     I feel kind of embarrassed sometimes telling people how low their <br/>
allowances are but with the size of our family and our own attempts to get <br/>
Matt (my husband) out of the rat race as much as possible by working less, we <br/>
just can&#39;t afford to give them much more.  I am thankful that the kids don&#39;t <br/>
feel deprived by it.  I do want them to value time more than money, overall.<br/>
