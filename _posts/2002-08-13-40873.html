<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669253168">Thanks, Sandra. <br/>
It&#39;s late a tonight (2 AM) and I&#39;ve gotta say good-bye and go ::taking a<br/>
last look at all the posts before I have to go on a &quot;fast&quot; from e-mail<br/>
on my trip::&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ;) So it doesn&#39;t ever quiet down? - Well, I keep telling myself I&#39;d rather <br/>
&gt; have them all here - then my kids somewhere else... although I wasn&#39;t to <br/>
&gt; happy when my 4 year old and his friend somehow made off with my digital <br/>
&gt; camera into a &quot;secret hiding place&quot; that is so secret they can no longer <br/>
&gt; find it! I guess you just have to laugh about it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My step-mother brought me some of my dad&#39;s things, after he passed away. One <br/>
was an old beatup briefcase - junky, but it was my dad&#39;s and I couldn&#39;t bring <br/>
myself to toss it out. It sat out in the living room for a few weeks and then <br/>
I accepted reality that I was NOT going to get rid of it and I stuck it on a <br/>
way-high hard-to-reach shelf out of sight. There it sat for about 8 years.<br/>
<br/>
Then, one day I took it down and opened it and guess what was in it? Yep - <br/>
the MISSING TV remote control --- missing since my then-10 yo daughter was <br/>
TWO YEARS OLD &lt;G&gt;. She&#39;s now almost 18 and we still have the tv and still <br/>
have that remote and I think about her putting it in that briefcase, her <br/>
little two-year-old fingers struggling with those latches---opening them, <br/>
putting the remote control inside, carefully closing the old latches --- <br/>
every time I use it. And that reminds me of my dad, who died when she was <br/>
only two and before my other kids were even born and I think how he&#39;d just <br/>
crack UP at how we turned the house inside out looking for that remote <br/>
control and there it was, safely in his briefcase all that time.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  But I still think a parent who <br/>
&gt; &gt; has chosen to unschool when the child is 3 is an unschooling parent in an <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling family. There&#39;s a change of attitude that comes with <br/>
&gt; &gt; recognizing <br/>
&gt; &gt; the value in that unschooling label and lifestyle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with this, Mary. My kids are almost-5yo and almost-3yo. I think the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; difference is in the mindset.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AND - it is so much easier to develop that mindset when the kids are still 5 <br/>
and 3 than to try to adjust mindsets when the kids are older.<br/>
<br/>
Confidence comes over time -  those who are starting out thinking along <br/>
unschooling lines are going to be so MUCH more clear and confident and calm <br/>
when their kids are older and when it can sometimes get a little harder to <br/>
resist the pressures of the dominant &quot;school-is-a-child&#39;s-work&quot; cultural <br/>
beliefs.<br/>
