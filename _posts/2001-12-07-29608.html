&gt;Good question Mimi. . . I guess it could be or it could not be. . . it all<br/>
&gt;depends on your intention. I dont force those words either, but the<br/>
&gt;grandparents make a big deal out of it. . . like not giving them something<br/>
&gt;until they say please. Got any ideas on how to handle that one?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think kids have to learn that different people expect different things of<br/>
them.  I would tend to leave it between the kids and the relatives, unless<br/>
it really seemed to bother them.<br/>
<br/>
Another one I refuse to force on kids is apologies.  There&#39;s nothing worse<br/>
than getting an insincere apology from someone because they were required<br/>
to say it.  I&#39;d rather have no apology than a forced one.<br/>

This can be challenging at times with other grownups....I&#39;ll never forget<br/>
when a friend&#39;s dd hit my dd.  My dd was, understandably,  hurt and angry.<br/>
The other mom wanted to force her dd not only to apologize,  but to hug my<br/>
dd!  I was thankful I was present to inform the mom that if my dd refuses a<br/>
touch,  her will must be respected.  The mom was upset since it is(was-i<br/>
hope) her &#39;policy&#39; to make her children apologize and embrace. (Nevermind<br/>
that whatever upset the poor 3 yr old in the first place was still upsetting<br/>
her)<br/>
    There&#39;s a book used in gerontology circles for folks with dementia which<br/>
describes &quot;validation therapy&quot;,  which basically means recognizing the<br/>
person&#39;s feelings and validating that feeling and, therefore, the person.<br/>
This seems like basic empathy,  but recognizes the fact that the person may<br/>
not be capable of controlling how the react to the feeling.<br/>
