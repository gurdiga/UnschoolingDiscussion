<div id="ygrps-yiv-771486267">I have a mystery.  I didn’t receive my own Just Add Light and Stir mailing for the past two nights.  (I went to bed early and am up at 3:30 a.m. in Albuquerque; unnatural, but just in case anyone noticed the time.)<br/>
<br/>
I went to see what it might be, and Feedburner (a google function I use to let people subscribe to the blog by mail) shows 90 subscribers.  I thought there should be 1500.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking at the stats there, it says February 18, subscribers:  1,654<br/>
February 19, subscribers 90<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is a glitch feedburner will fix on their own.  With it being a Monday-off holiday in the U.S. maybe it won’t be seen or dealt with until Tuesday.   But I thought just maybe someone here would know something, or at least I could let some subscribers know of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
My next largest subscription feed is to the unschooling site news<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/aboutunschooling">http://sandradodd.com/aboutunschooling</a><br/>
which has 193 subscribers and had 191 the day before, so that one isn’t messed up, seems.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t think re-subscribing is necessary; I think it will be restored, but if anyone wants to see the two that didn’t go out, here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I hope this is the worst thing that happens this week, to any of us! :-)<br/>

Oooh!  One of the lucky 90.<br/>
So others missed seeing your cat watching TV. :-)<br/>

I found an address to write to feedburner.  It might not help, but will make me feel better so I can go to sleep happier. :-)<br/>

I went to see what it might be, and Feedburner (a google function I use to let people subscribe to the blog by mail) shows 90 subscribers.  I thought there should be 1500.<br>
<br>
Looking at the stats there, it says February 18, subscribers:  1,654<br>
February 19, subscribers 90<br>
<br>
Maybe this is a glitch feedburner will fix on their own.  With it being a Monday-off holiday in the U.S. maybe it won’t be seen or dealt with until Tuesday.   But I thought just maybe someone here would know something, or at least I could let some subscribers know of the problem.<br>
<br>
My next largest subscription feed is to the unschooling site news<br>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/aboutunschooling">http://sandradodd.com/ aboutunschooling</a><br>
which has 193 subscribers and had 191 the day before, so that one isn’t messed up, seems.<br>
<br>
I don’t think re-subscribing is necessary; I think it will be restored, but if anyone wants to see the two that didn’t go out, here:<br>
