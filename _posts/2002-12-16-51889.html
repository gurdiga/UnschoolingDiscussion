 I am the &quot;she&quot; that wrote the post about the pancakes!!.. It was all in one <br/>
 post .. from beginning to end.  Did you happen to read it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Teresa, Yes, I read the post, but without going back and rereading every <br/>
single one I can not quote exact words can I?<br/>
If I had time to I would. But I have four children and a job to deal with.<br/>
I only remember that the first post Elissa responded to was saying that the <br/>
mother can&#39;t always respond when her child wants something.<br/>
That was questioned, which upset you. Then an example was given (the <br/>
pancake/coffee scenario) and most everyone agreed that you weren&#39;t ignoring <br/>
your childs need for your own. YAY!<br/>
Can we move on now? PLEEZ??<br/>
<br/>
And this:<br/>
 &quot;TERESA IS A HATEFUL, VINDICITIVE PERSON WHO DOES NOT CARE <br/>
ABOUT HER CHILDRENS NEEDS .  SHE IS ARROGANT AND DISTRUPTIVE&quot;<br/>
was never implied NOR spoken. You are now accusing people of actually <br/>
attacking you, when they did not say any of the above things.<br/>
This is called reading into someones words things that are not there.<br/>
.  <br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>
