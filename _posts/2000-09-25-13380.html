<div id="ygrps-yiv-917409816">Greetings;<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, I&#39;ve enjoyed all the Christmas talk of late...as we are<br/>
anticipating our first frost any day now and I mourn the passing of<br/>
summer (though we&#39;re usually good for a stretch of Indian Summer into<br/>
October) I am now inspired to anticipate all that is to come with the<br/>
cooler temps and thoughts of Christmas!  I come from a small family so<br/>
for the last 15 years or so, our quiet and intimate Christmas<br/>
celebration with my husband, children and pets has always been a most<br/>
gratifying, glorifying and peacefilled day.  I am so looking forward to<br/>
it already...<br/>
<br/>
And btw, thanks everyone for all the info concerning vaccinations!  I am<br/>
finding that to be a very helpful, interesting and informative subject<br/>
too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Would some one like to tell me what an American Christmas is like?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure even in America Christmas is different for everyone, but I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt; happy to share what it&#39;s like for me. First of all, as you can tell, it<br/>
&gt; starts really early in my house. We begin with subtle things like listening<br/>
&gt; to carols, watching videos, and reading books. As the season progresses we<br/>
&gt; do things like put up decorations, do some wrapping of gifts and start<br/>
&gt; planning meals and visits. By the time Thanksgiving has passed we&#39;re in full<br/>
&gt; swing. Trees, wreathes. lights, fires, cocoa and carols every night.<br/>
&gt; Christmas Eve is even more special to me than Christmas Day. It&#39;s usually a<br/>
&gt; family day spent doing a lot of last minute bustling. Then it&#39;s off to<br/>
&gt; church for a candle light service that after 22 years in the same church<br/>
&gt; still brings tears to my eays. The kids sing and at the end everyone has a<br/>
&gt; lit candle and when those lights go out and Silent Night is sung it knocks<br/>
&gt; your socks off. Then it&#39;s home to celebrate with friends and try to get<br/>
&gt; little ones to bed (yeah right ). Christmas morning we open gifts. Then<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re off to my mom&#39;s for more gifts and breakfast. Then it&#39;s off to my in<br/>
&gt; laws for yet more gifts, dinner, and enough dessert to last all year. Then<br/>
&gt; we crash!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I second that.  I really learned a lot, too.  I know that I don&#39;t agree with <br/>
some of you on the subject, but you respected my opinions, and I really <br/>
appreciated that.  Thanks for listening.  Unschoolers are the best!<br/>
