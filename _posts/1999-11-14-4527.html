<div id="ygrps-yiv-985969302">Dr. Gordon Neufeld,  Vancouver, B.C. psychologist.<br/>
No book or web site but many speaking engagements, seminars, etc. Long<br/>
waiting list for his clinical practice.  I am lobbying him regularly to come<br/>
into the computer age and share with a much wider audience.  The stuff he<br/>
says is just absolutely absorbing....probably because we agree with so much<br/>
of it.<br/>

Maybe you could offer to do ghostwriting for him! <br/>

Actually, I respect what you&#39;ve said about his putting family and patients <br/>

he&#39;s ready!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908057976">I just spoke with Gordon Neufeld last night.  I explained that he just<br/>
absolutely needed a web site.  He is committed to doing this in the next six<br/>
months.  I believe what he is saying is akin to setting a spark to a flammable<br/>
liquid.  There is such a readiness for what he has to say among a significant<br/>
number of people that I predict he will be on Oprah within five years.  You<br/>
heard it here first!  He has a unified view and outlook which explains so much.<br/>
He absolutely does away with &#39;techniques&quot; and &quot;methods&quot; and &quot;how to&quot; approaches<br/>
to child development and looks at the relationship between child and parent.<br/>
When that relationship is cultivated, protected and nurtured the rest emerges<br/>
naturally.  More later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764735050">His basic philosophy sounds somewhat like Penelope Leach.  She promotes<br/>
educating parents on basic child development,  but focuses primarily on the<br/>
fact that children are individual persons.  Parents needs to &#39;get to know&#39;<br/>
the children they live with and learn to respect each others needs.  And<br/>
parents of babies (especially) must reply on their knowledge of the<br/>
individual child plus parental intuition if &quot;something is not right&quot; (as<br/>
Miss Clavel would say).<br/>
Hope this makes sense....I&#39;m in a bit of a rush :o)<br/>
