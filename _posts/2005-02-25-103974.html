&quot;...shoved through the cattle shoot&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
There are turkey shoots (poor turkeys) <br/>
and cattle chutes  (like chutes and ladders, only they&#39;re like cattle  <br/>
ladders, to get them into a truck).<br/>
 <br/>
I like words and word histories.  Some people were traumatized by  spelling <br/>
tests in school and might only as adults get an interest in words as  words, <br/>
with all their history and trivia.  So those who don&#39;t like words as  toys, <br/>
ignore me. That&#39;s okay. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So funny that you say that ­ I have been lurking on this list for the past<br/>
three weeks or so.  In that time you have posted definitions to more than a<br/>
few words!!!  Every time I¹d begin to read one of those posts it would pique<br/>
my interest, but I never actually finished any of those posts!!  What you<br/>
wrote above answered my unasked question ³why².  My mom homeschooled all six<br/>
of us and LOVED to send us to the dictionary to ³look it up² when we asked<br/>
her anything about a word; spelling, meaning, origins, etc.  ( we learned<br/>
not to ask)   Same with maps, thesauruses . . . .  I have quite an aversion<br/>
now.  I have only started to truly deschool, although I think I¹ve been<br/>
doing it slowly, sorta, for the last six years since I graduated.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas here and on sandradodd/unschool.com  fascinate me, attract me, and<br/>
repel me(so scary!)! It feels so right ­ but right isn¹t supposed to be this<br/>
easy, is it?? :)  My college professor husband and I are listening,<br/>
learning, and working up the courage to start the journey . . .<br/>

I don&#39;t usually finish all the math posts.  I read until I get  confused and <br/>
I skim for more stuff about people or words.  So I understand  when people <br/>
don&#39;t care about word histories.<br/>
 <br/>
When the parents or teachers act like looking things up is only for kids  and <br/>
not fun, it does tend to make kids wait to grow up so they never have to  <br/>
look anything up again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Especially with unschooling, it helps kids to see that looking things up  can <br/>
be fun, and can lead from one thing to another.  And from my quick  <br/>
willingness to pull down a reference book or to pull up google, my kids have  been <br/>
really generous with finding information for me when I&#39;m cooking or busy  and have <br/>
a question they can find for me.  We&#39;ve had some of our most  amusing <br/>
unplanned times from looking one thing up and then another one.   Last night Holly <br/>
and I  were looking up movies and actors and Meat  Loaf Aday and bios and had a <br/>
good time.  The night before we&#39;d been at  Barnes & Noble looking at <br/>
dictionaries, just for fun!<br/>

wonderful things!  I have shown my kids how they work, but never told <br/>
them to go look it up. And they never do - they seem to think that they <br/>
should always ask me, because if I don&#39;t know I&#39;ll look it up and that&#39;s <br/>
so much easier - and so much fun for me!  I guess one day, when they <br/>
have left home, they&#39;ll learn to do it for themselves - or will they <br/>
just text me? Hmmmm.<br/>
