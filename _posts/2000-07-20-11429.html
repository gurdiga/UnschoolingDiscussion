<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070971959"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;SNIP&gt;:Define Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have been asked to write an article defining Unschooling (at least from<br/>
what I know.)  One thing that I want to include is information about the<br/>
coining of the word Unschooling and the genesis of the movement, before I<br/>
move into describing the process.  Those of you who harbor information on<br/>
this issue, please indulge me.  I know it was Gatto&#39;s word, but not much<br/>
more than that.  Please site sources for information so that I may verify<br/>
and include them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

You should check out the GWS page (www.gws.com)...I think it was in fact<br/>
John Holt who coined the term unschooling which was, to him, not going to<br/>
school.  I&#39;m sure you could get quotes at the site, or in his many books.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with the article, can we get a copy???  Please!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I wasn&#39;t so certain of<br/>
&gt; what I was doing, hadn&#39;t done 7 years of successful &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
&gt; already, wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results, then I would be very<br/>
&gt; intimidated by this kind of vicious questioning about something so<br/>
&gt; totally nitpicky.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why are you here?  Did you come to share with us your experiences of<br/>
unschooling your daughter?  I&#39;m always interested in people&#39;s stories.<br/>
<br/>
Did you read the list for a week or two before you hopped in?  The only<br/>
reason I ask is because you seem to think the comments you have received are<br/>
vicious.  They look just like all the other criticisms of ideas (not people,<br/>
ideas) that I&#39;ve seen here over the months I&#39;ve been around.  They were<br/>
certainly not intended personally.<br/>
<br/>
Norma, please stay and feel welcome if you like what we all have here.  It&#39;s<br/>
not a closed society or group.  However, it is *our* group.  Helen owns it<br/>
for our benefit, Joyce helps us by moderating with a very light hand.   Join<br/>
us, or leave, as you please.  But don&#39;t try to change us; we like ourselves<br/>
this way!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am beginning to feel that also.  I am VERY new to homeschooling and<br/>
&gt; unschooling and if I have ?s or need support I am not sure I will post it on<br/>
&gt; this list.  Seems to be more of a debate forum.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, we definitely debate things around here.  I like it, so I stayed.  It&#39;s<br/>
ok if you don&#39;t like it, really.  But heated discussions here happen about<br/>
ideas, not people.  Your ideas do not reflect your personal worth in the<br/>
world, so let them be challenged, and defend them.  You&#39;ll probably learn<br/>
something, and so will anyone else who cares to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am not so sure that newbies<br/>
&gt; to unschooling would get any helpful support here?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t come here for support.  I come to learn.  I don&#39;t think this was<br/>
intended to be a support group, was it?  Clarification, please, Joyce?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If my 12 you wants to do a worksheet I let him.  If they<br/>
&gt; want me to check spelling GREAT I will do it.  My definition of unschool is<br/>
&gt; allowing my children to learn in an environment free from boundaries.  It is<br/>
&gt; allowing them choices to decide HOW they want to learn be it games, reading,<br/>
&gt; internet, hand on, tv, and most important just playing and living...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, according to what you&#39;ve just said here, I think you have the idea<br/>
quite nicely.  Unschooling is about what children want to learn, when they<br/>
want to learn it.  (Not when we, or the school, or anybody else, wants them<br/>
to!)<br/>

having their ideas challenged personally.<br/>
