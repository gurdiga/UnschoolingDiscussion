<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187613023">Hello all -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently set up a group for unschoolers to share resource ideas<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingResources)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingResources)</a>.  This is taken<br/>
from the group&#39;s description:<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Found a great board game? Know when a cool show will be on? How about<br/>
that awesome book your son just finished reading? Here&#39;s a place to<br/>
share what you&#39;ve found and to discover even more ways to feed your<br/>
children&#39;s passions! Games (of all sorts), books, science equipment,<br/>
websites, television shows, art supplies, toys, movies, math<br/>
manipulatives, magazines, etc.... LOTS of etc!<br/>
 <br/>
Has your family developed a cool game using spoons, strawberry baskets<br/>
and beanbags? Tell us about it! Found a great touring exhibit? Fallen<br/>
in love with a comic book? Found the perfect crayon? Discovered a new<br/>
science fiction series your daughter just can&#39;t get enough of? This is<br/>
the place to post about it! <br/>
 <br/>
Also, if your child suddenly develops a passion for dinosaurs,<br/>
astronomy, 1950s musicals, calculus, interior decorating, King Tut,<br/>
Kiwi birds, dragons, or the Union army, this is the place to ask for<br/>
resource suggestions!<br/>
 <br/>
What this group is NOT about: worksheets/workbooks, links to<br/>
attendance sheets, gradebooks or planners, curriculum of any sort,<br/>
discussions of home/unschooling theory, discussions of<br/>
home/unschooling in general, advertising businesses, etc. There are<br/>
many other lists devoted to these things. <br/>
 <br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I&#39;ve set up several pages at the Live Free Learn Free website<br/>
(www.livefreelearnfree.com) that will be devoted to listing many of<br/>
the resources suggested on the UR list.  Just click on &quot;Resources.&quot;<br/>
These pages are still being set up, but a few have a good bit of<br/>
information, already.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>
Happy unschooling!<br/>
