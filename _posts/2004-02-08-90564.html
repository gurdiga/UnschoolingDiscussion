<div id="ygrps-yiv-299008374">I picked up a couple of new things for my DD this afternoon.  I got <br/>
her a magnetic board with an underwater scene and lots of pieces to <br/>
go with it as well as a felt board and farm animal pieces.  <br/>
<br/>
We had SO much fun playing with them this afternoon.  I had <br/>
forgotten just how much fun it can be to make up your own stories.  <br/>
I would make up a story and my DD would grab the piece from me and <br/>
say &quot;No, mom, that&#39;s not what happened.&quot;  or &quot;I don&#39;t think so mom&quot; <br/>
and make up some other story for what &quot;actually&quot; happened.  :)<br/>
