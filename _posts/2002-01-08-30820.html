<div id="ygrps-yiv-379680520">&quot;He warned us<br/>
that he would not respond to anyone while &quot;The Simpson&#39;s&quot; were on.  Not a<br/>
healthy situation in my opinion. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like he&#39;s anticipating some interruptions and warning everyone not <br/>
to try it. Maybe it&#39;s not nice manners to go off and do your own thing <br/>
during a family Thanksgiving, but if wacthing TV at Thanksgiving is allowed <br/>
at all, then wanting to watch a  show without being interrupted seems <br/>
reasonable to me.<br/>
