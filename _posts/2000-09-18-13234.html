 </span></blockquote>I appreciate the effort of all...you for your very thoughtful response and <br/>
others for pointing out about the Onion.  I&#39;d never heard of it before.  I <br/>
knew the HP stuff was pure garbage because I read the books (actually I knew <br/>
even before that because my son tells me all about what he reads.  A very <br/>
vocal kid, that one is.  Book reports.  Yep.  We can check that off on our <br/>
school to-do list.  Ours are given orally and take longer than it took to <br/>
read the book to begin with.  But, I digress...again!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I appreciate seeing what&#39;s going around.  I run into uninformed <br/>
people who think they have opinions.  One in particular, is the father of my <br/>
12yr old ds.  The &#39;opinion&#39; posted about HP (based on Onion &#39;report&#39;) is <br/>
precisely the sort of thing he tries to use as logic to show that I&#39;m not a <br/>
good enough parent.  You would not believe what I got about Pokemon!  (You&#39;d <br/>
have to know this guy.  There is no way he has enough actual intelligence to <br/>
come up with this stuff on his own.  But he sure thinks he knows what he&#39;s <br/>
talking about and he tells the rest of us how much we are contributing the <br/>
evil in the world at large.  I&#39;m ornery, if he states these &#39;opinions&#39; in <br/>
front of my ds, I argue with him.  Can&#39;t let such stupidity go unchallenged <br/>
in front of my impressionable child.)<br/>
<br/>
At least I now have a little better understanding of how these sorts of &#39;fact <br/>
filled opinions&#39; get started in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
Ugh.<br/>
