 </span></blockquote>  Mary, <br/>
    Very recently a couple posts showed up on the &quot;parents of <br/>
spirited kids&quot; discussion list regarding testing.  It seems to me <br/>
that spirited, active alert, and gifted children have a tendancy to <br/>
have a different learning style, awareness of the world around them, <br/>
and view things with a different perspective than most.  what <br/>
concerns me is who is determining the right/wrong answer for tests <br/>
that are developed for very young children (pre-school age), what <br/>
exactly is being done with the results of these tests in terms of <br/>
what they are teaching the children?  in my opinion they must plan on <br/>
teaching the children to have a very narrow way of thinking and <br/>
discourage any creative, extended, analytical thinking!  <br/>
an example of a test question would be... &quot;Birds fly and fish _____&quot;. <br/>
the expected answer is &quot;fish swim&quot;.  A child answering &quot;fish don&#39;t&quot; <br/>
would be penalized with the wrong answer.  h-m-m-m-m-m.  is this a <br/>
true measure of what a person/child really knows?  why is the answer <br/>
&quot;fish don&#39;t&quot; not the &quot;right&quot; answer too!  it seems to me that this <br/>
would only serve to stifle a child&#39;s learning and comprehension of <br/>
the world around them into not looking at things from all <br/>
perspectives!  this was a test question given to a four year old.  As <br/>
i mentioned in my reply there, they wouldn&#39;t have gotten off that <br/>
easy had it been Sterling.  He would have gone on to justify that <br/>
some birds don&#39;t fly and some swim and provided them with examples.  <br/>
i&#39;m getting a little off track here but my point is that it seems to <br/>
me that the public schools are working awfully hard to teach kids how <br/>
to be dumber with these tests that are supposedly developed by <br/>
&quot;experts&quot; and that anyone here who has doubts about their choice to <br/>
unschool their kids should rejoice!!  <br/>

&gt; reading is important, but will everyone really need to be literate<br/>
&gt; in 2040?  Maybe computers will be so prevalent and so different from<br/>
&gt; what we can imagine that people will only need to know how to push<br/>
&gt; buttons?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  now this is a very good point.  think about where computers were <br/>
20-30 years ago and where they are now.  when you compare DOS to <br/>
Windows, one would have to agree that they already are moving toward <br/>
people only needing to know how to push buttons and some already are <br/>
pretty good with voice recognition and a person doesn&#39;t even have to <br/>
know the right button to push!!  Voice recognition computers in the <br/>
present are more often used for people with disabilities and are not <br/>
usually within the budget of the average household that owns a <br/>
computer.  but i don&#39;t think it will be that far in the future where <br/>
these will become the normal household computer.  this means our kids <br/>
won&#39;t even have to know how to type or compose a sentence correctly <br/>
because the computer will do it for us.  and yes, who else knows what <br/>
will be commonplace in 2040!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943282468">Let me start by saying that I have doubts too and struggle with how to<br/>
present what we do to others.  When I tell &quot;others&quot; of what we do in a<br/>
schoolish way, they are usually impressed.  What I don&#39;t tell is how we<br/>
spend most of our time, because it would seem like we are doing &quot;nothing&quot;<br/>
compared to what kids in school appear to be doing all day.<br/>
<br/>
Testing, IMO, is one of the major weaknesses of ps.  A member of our<br/>
school board said ~Yes, we teach to the test, but experts have figured<br/>
out what kids need to know and that is what&#39;s on the test~  I DO NOT<br/>
believe that tests accurately measure what a person knows.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
been good at taking tests and scored well in college classes but remember<br/>
so little of what I tested well at.  Used to study with a friend who<br/>
obviously knew the material better than I, yet I got better grades<br/>
because she freaked out at test time.  Don&#39;t know if tests are useful for<br/>
anything.  Is a Doctor who scores well on the medical boards a better Dr.<br/>
than one who barely passes?  I don&#39;t have the answer to how we can trust<br/>
that an expert we pay money to see is truly knowledgeable. <br/>
<br/>
Besides, as someone pointed out in something I read, we DO NOT know what<br/>
our children will need to know in 20 or 30 years!  I think reading is<br/>
important, but will everyone really need to be literate in 2040?  Maybe<br/>
computers will be so prevalent and so different from what we can imagine<br/>
that people will only need to know how to push buttons?<br/>
