&lt;&lt; The NASCO Science catalog has dead animals you can dissect.  It also has<br/>
 owl poop you can look at for evidence of what the owl ate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That IS a most excellent catalog, BUT it&#39;s not owl poop you dissect Sorcha.<br/>
Owl pellets are regurgitated. It&#39;s all the non-digestible parts of the <br/>
animal...never goes through the digestive tract though.<br/>

teehee....<br/>
It&#39;s ok. I just thought that should be clarified for future readers. :)<br/>
I&#39;ve witnessed owl pellet dissection with my kids so that&#39;s how I knew. We <br/>
look for pellets in the woods now, there&#39;s a resident owl AND a hawk. But we <br/>
have yet to find a wild owl pellet, even though they MUST be out there.<br/>
