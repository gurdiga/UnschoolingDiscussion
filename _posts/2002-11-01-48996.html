<div id="ygrps-yiv-498417277">I really thought that I had a handle on what unschooling is. The definitions I see here totally resonate with me. And everything I have read, I feel comfortable with. However, I am struggling on what it &quot;looks&quot; like IRL, if that makes any sense. Do you &quot;plan&quot; any learning? I believe whole heartedly that my boys(age 5 yrs) can and will learn without having curriculums to follow, and without me formally teaching them everything. But, I don&#39;t really get how the whole picture goes together. Do you set up or &quot;stage&quot; things, then see if they get interested in something, and then find more info and/or activities to relate to that subject? Or, do you just kind of go about your day with your interests and let them discover things on their own and ask you questions? I don&#39;t mean that I would just sit around eating bon-bons and not have to be present , but I guess it just doesn&#39;t seem like we have enough excitement around here. I am worried that I somehow need more to spur their curiosity? They really seem bored at times. I keep thinking, how can they be bored already, they are only 5! I hope this question is clear. <br/>
Can anyone help me understand? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t plan &quot;learning&quot; at all, but I do bring up all sorts of things <br/>
that I think my kids will be interested in. I go through our town&#39;s <br/>
weekly calendar once a week with the kids and we put stuff on our own <br/>
calendar that they might be interested in, stuff like plays, <br/>
readings, story times, parades, peace vigils, classes, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I buy things -- like my recent purchase of some early reader books <br/>
that are themed on the Lego characters my son loves, knowing he would <br/>
just be overcome with excitement when he saw them (he was) -- because <br/>
I know he&#39;s bored with the early reader-type books we have around the <br/>
house (Dr. Seuss and Bob books). That doesn&#39;t mean I expect him to <br/>
sit down and read them, which I guess would be &quot;planning learning&quot;, <br/>
but he does some times, and some times he asks me to read them to <br/>
him. They&#39;re there, they&#39;re available, sparking interest in the world <br/>
of reading. I buy other things that I think the kids will be <br/>
interested in. Sometimes I&#39;m right (word magnets for the <br/>
refridgerator, a scale to measure things), sometimes I&#39;m wrong <br/>
(cuisinaire rods). I think where unschooling really comes in is that <br/>
there&#39;s no pressure on the kids to use them, especially in the case <br/>
where I&#39;m wrong and they&#39;re not interested. Also, I can watch their <br/>
interest wax and wane without anxiety. My son will use the <br/>
refridgerator magnets for a solid week, making up poems and writing <br/>
them down on paper. Then for several weeks he might not touch them at <br/>
all. Both are okay.<br/>
<br/>
We also attend homeschooling and other events that the kids are <br/>
interested in, on a weekly basis. They always get to choose a class <br/>
or two to do as well if they want to - last year my daughter chose <br/>
gymnastics and my son horseback riding and swimming. At times when <br/>
they see something that they&#39;re interested in, as my son was at a <br/>
Japanese festival we went to that had martial arts demonstrations, I <br/>
will mention that classes are available in that subject if they&#39;re <br/>
interested (neither was interested in pursuing martial arts at that <br/>
point).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also things that I do just for me that they come along to. <br/>
Often they ask to be included in my activites. Sometimes they don&#39;t <br/>
want to be or can&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes boredom can be a great spur to finding new interests. But <br/>
sometimes (especially with kids this young), it can be very <br/>
frustrating for the parent. I know my kids tend to act out a lot more <br/>
if they&#39;re bored, picking fights with each other, etc. So if that <br/>
starts happening, we just go out of the house on some adventure or <br/>
another. My kids are both pretty high-energy, gregarious, extroverts. <br/>
So they need/want a lot of interaction, stimulation, movement, etc. <br/>
They are always asking me to call someone to come play or to go <br/>
somewhere (even if we&#39;ve just gotten home from a 6-hour playtime at <br/>
the park with friends, LOL!). So what works for us is to be busy most <br/>
of the time, doing things, usually with other people. That might not <br/>
work for others though, I have friends whose kids prefer to stay home <br/>
a lot more than mine do.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if this answers anything. I do think that once a person <br/>
releases the expectations of &quot;learning&quot; and the way that looks, then <br/>
anything they feel free to do or suggest to their kids will just flow <br/>
along - sometimes working, sometimes not, but not causing anxiety <br/>
either way.<br/>
