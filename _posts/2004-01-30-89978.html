Right.  It&#39;s okay for a list to have quiet days.  We don&#39;t need to fill them <br/>
up with &quot;is it quiet?  The list must be down.&quot;  If the list is down, we won&#39;t <br/>
see posts asking where all the posts are.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on AOL; lots are, it&#39;s not an AOL problem if the list quits.  But the <br/>
list didn&#39;t quit.<br/>
<br/>
A quiet day can be nice!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707584182">Well, the expectations for our week in Wlmsbrg did not come to <br/>
fruition thanks to the winter storm that blanketed VA ( as well as <br/>
many other states).  We did manage to get out for a couple of hours <br/>
on Tues, Wed, and Thurs.  Tues and Wed were so cold, mucky, yucky, <br/>
still icy, we only saw a couple of things and headed back in to our <br/>
WONDERFUL accomodations. ( THANK GOODNESS we had a great timeshare <br/>
with all the amenities to keep 6 kids occupied and happy)  Thursday <br/>
was much warmer and dryer and we enjoyed several sights.  Still, we <br/>
barely scratched the surface of everything that is offered in this <br/>
lovely, interesting Colonial town.  We have our Freedom passes, which <br/>
are good for a year, so we will definitely be going back when the <br/>
weather warms up.  The good thing is, now we are completely oriented <br/>
with the town, we know what we want to see, and we won&#39;t spend as <br/>
much time consulting the map :-)   I have to say, for anyone who <br/>
enjoys American History, Wlmsbrg is THE PLACE to put on your &quot;to do&quot; <br/>
list.  It is very &quot;self guided&quot;  You can ask as many or as few <br/>
questions as you like.  The interpreters ( costumed guides) are all <br/>
very friendly and amazingly knowlegeable about many historical points <br/>
from the lives of the characters they portray, to political events, <br/>
geographical facts, HECK.. anything about America in the 1770s.. and <br/>
before, and after.. LOL..<br/>
<br/>
 Anna and I most enjoyed &quot;A conversation with the ladies of the <br/>
town&quot;  One lady was the sister of Patrick Henry, I didn&#39;t catch who <br/>
the other lady was.. They were sitting, doing needlework, just <br/>
talking about current gossip of the day, asking us questions, <br/>
answering questions.. It was most intriguing.  Patrick Henry&#39;s speech <br/>
was also very interesting. The boys loved the foundry.  They each got <br/>
to file on some pewter spoons, pull the bellows to stoke the fire.. <br/>
We watched the tradesmen tarnish candlesticks and mold spoons and <br/>
file candlesticks.  JP would have glady stayed as thier apprentice :-<br/>
)  We also especially enjoyed visting with a slave from Peyton <br/>
Randolphs house.  In the slave quaters, we warmed ourself by the fire <br/>
in the small, sparse room that accomdated over 15 slaves.   John, <br/>
(the HUGE man) joked and laughed with us, asked the kids riddles, and <br/>
let Ethan try on the Mans servant coat.   Although it was cold, and <br/>
we didnt get to do nearly as much as we wanted, the quality of the <br/>
time we spent in town was exceptional.  Since there were few <br/>
travelers, we got lots of one on one time and special attention.  We <br/>
all agreed that a dream come true would be to get to &quot;work&quot; in <br/>
Wlmbsrg as an interpreter.. WHAT FUN!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217255129">Sounds like you guys had a great time despite the weather! I&#39;m glad. We also have Freedom passes and are up for a visit whenever--it&#39;s only about a 3 hr. drive for us. If you&#39;re ever up for an irl meet and greet. <br/>
<br/>
Many probably already know this, but I just wanted to point out how different each visit is. There are always different events scheduled, different people, etc. I don&#39;t think two visits would ever be alike! We also just *love* Colonial Williamsburg--there is so much to do. We&#39;re really looking forward to the weather warming up because we&#39;ve yet to make it to Jamestown!<br/>
<br/>
Also, for anyone considering the Live and Learn Conference, Plimoth Plantation is incredible! I actually enjoyed the time up there even more than Williamsburg. The one bummer is that they ask guests not to dress up, whereas Williamsburg welcomes it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty much a huge fan of both, though, and would highly recommend them both.<br/>

<br/>
Oh yes, that sounds like a great idea! We live about 5 hours from CW <br/>
( If I don&#39;t miss my turn and take the LOOOOONG way around)  Our <br/>
friends that we went with have been to CW several times and they told <br/>
us about all of the different seasonal events.  We really want to see <br/>
the Governor hung in effigy in the town square.  We also missed the <br/>
fife and drum parade, those are both warm weather events.  It was <br/>
nice to see the huge roaring fires and the long warm cloaks and <br/>
gloves.    When we plan our next visit, I will let you know!<br/>

  ===========================================================================<br/>
<br/>
We got a heavy dusting (about an inch) when we were there in December, and it truly is lovely. The Christmas decorations are amazing--it is a wonderful time to go if you can brave the weather. At night the line the streets with torches and have carolers and a military music concert that&#39;s terrific! All these young kids from the fife and drummers play--I could just picture my homeschool son getting into reenactments and doing something like this.<br/>
<br/>
Much of the outdoor stuff doesn&#39;t happen in inclement weather (no carriage rides for instance), but there are few people at that time of the year, so you really get to talk to the re-enactors and do things that you don&#39;t get to do at busier times of the year. We spoke to one of the wig makers for quite a while, and that was truly fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
For those that may seriously consider a trip out here, you could do a really great loop from Williamsburg to Monticello (Jefferson&#39;s home) to Mount Vernon (Washington&#39;s home) to DCs monuments and museums.  Loads of things to do!<br/>
