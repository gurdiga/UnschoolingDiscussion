<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749299179">I&#39;m hoping someone on the list can help me in some way!  My 5 year <br/>
old has been playing Freddi the Fish a lot, the one where you can <br/>
make your own mazes.  He thinks it is so cool, and was talking to his <br/>
sister (9) about how cool it would be if you could make your own <br/>
computer games to do whatever you wanted.  He asked dh and I if he <br/>
could, and dh said he would look into it.  Neither of us already know <br/>
how to make our own computer games.  Dh knows more about computers <br/>
than I do, but he&#39;s afraid it could take months to learn what he <br/>
needs to learn to teach my son how to do it and by then my son might <br/>
be really frustrated.  Already he&#39;s asking me to write notes, &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
forget about me making my own game&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have anywhere to point us so that we can learn how to do <br/>
this QUICK?  <br/>
<br/>
And in the meantime, does anyone know of any pre-programmed computer <br/>
games that let kids design their own games?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466652149">I&#39;ve been lurking for a few weeks, trying to figure out where I want to<br/>
fit in the Homeschooling spectrum. When I first heard of unschooling (a<br/>
few years ago) I thought it was way out there and completely dismissed<br/>
it as too &quot;hippie-ish&quot;. I knew (and still know) that I want to<br/>
homeschool. My children are too precious to subject to the public school<br/>
system, and for the most part I think private schools are even worse. My<br/>
oldest DS will be ready for kindergarten next school year, but here in<br/>
IL children don&#39;t officially have to be in school until 7, so<br/>
technically I have a few years before I have to make any &quot;real&quot;<br/>
decisions. I&#39;ve been researching all the different Homeschooling<br/>
methods...and I must admit that they all appeal to me in different ways.<br/>
Classical education makes lots of sense but sounds too structured to me.<br/>
Although to me it does make sense to study Latin as it is the basis for<br/>
a lot languages and it would (probably) make learning a foreign language<br/>
easier. Unit studies sounds like lots of fun, not as structured as the<br/>
classical approach. I&#39;m leaning toward unit studies. Using a cirruculum<br/>
sounds like lots of work to me, and maybe too structured, but I think I<br/>
could make it as loose as I want. The thing is my DS LOVES structure. He<br/>
likes to know what is happening next, and what is expected of him.<br/>
Sometimes when I&#39;m making dinner I&#39;ll get out dough to play with, or<br/>
paper and crayons, and he asks me what I want him to make. I tell him to<br/>
make whatever he wants. Right now he&#39;s in a preschool program, it&#39;s<br/>
pretty structured and he loves it. Unschooling I think would be hard for<br/>
him, and honestly, I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable with no structure. I could<br/>
buy one of those $20 workbook types of curriculums so I have an idea of<br/>
what topics to introduce. I still have some time for research. I totally<br/>
buy into the philosophy of child lead learning. I don&#39;t want to force my<br/>
children to learn anything that does not interest them. But I am not<br/>
sure I have it in me to totally let them do whatever they want. My<br/>
oldest is so eager to learn to read...I&#39;m looking into phonics programs<br/>
for him. But for now we are playing with fridge alphabet magnets and<br/>
learning the different sound combinations. He surprised me and put<br/>
together the word &quot;BED&quot; all by himself. He really wants to learn to<br/>
read, now I have to figure out how best to teach him.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now for my questions...<br/>
<br/>
Is it still unschooling if you include typical school activities,<br/>
textbooks, workbooks etc if that is what the child wants to do? My<br/>
oldest loves workbooks. He does not do them in order; he will flip<br/>
through them and do the pages that interest him. For a while it was the<br/>
numbers pages, but now he is doing the alphabet pages. So if I pull<br/>
together a unit study when he shows an interest and lead the learning is<br/>
this still unschooling? <br/>
<br/>
During my research I&#39;ve discovered Reggio Emilia, an Italian method of<br/>
early childhood education. Here&#39;s a link that I found interesting. This<br/>
sounds very unschooling to me...but would it still be considered<br/>
unschooling if you sent your children to a school? There&#39;s a school here<br/>
that flaunts it uses this method. I&#39;m not really considering sending my<br/>
children to this school, but I am intrigued by it.<br/>

<br/>
Another issue I have is my DH. I know this is fairly common, but he is<br/>
not supportive of unschooling. He does not even want to talk about<br/>
Homeschooling very often. I&#39;m the one who wants to do it, so he&#39;s kinda<br/>
dropped it in my lap to take of. I have not really tried to sell<br/>
unschooling because I am on the fence myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for reading, and for the most part I&#39;ve enjoyed this list.<br/>

Download both the evaluation version and the tutorial. The tutorial is<br/>
really good.<br/>
<br/>
(There are versions for both Mac and that other computer.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forgetting the term for the way it writes software, but you move the<br/>
characters and the program writes the code. But you can also write your own<br/>
code too so it&#39;s good for beginners and more advanced programmers.<br/>

Honestly, I&#39;m amazed it hasn&#39;t driven more women to suicide.<br/>

just looks extremely time-consuming and overly ambitious to me.  But I&#39;m<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been researching all the different Homeschooling<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The goals of unschooling are different than all the other methods you<br/>
mention. The goal of unschooling is not education. It is to help a child be<br/>
who she is and blossom into who she will become. Education happens as a side<br/>
effect.<br/>
<br/>
Just as people plant vegetable gardens to raise vegetables. Along the way<br/>
pollinators come and it&#39;s even a vital part of the process, but the purpose<br/>
of planting the garden isn&#39;t to attract pollinators.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the other homeschooling methods is to give to the child<br/>
something that appeals to the parents. In a way formal educational methods<br/>
are like those cool educational toys that parents want to give their kids<br/>
for their birthday. What you&#39;re buying with a curriculum is an image of what<br/>
you want your child to be. The image may be as simple as being prepared to<br/>
be whatever they want to be. And yet it is still like picturing your child<br/>
playing with the super deluxe Erector set you&#39;re planning to give them. But<br/>
what if the child has no interest in Erector sets? What if what the child<br/>
really wants is a Nintendo system?<br/>
<br/>
I think many parents see education as a gift they can give their children.<br/>
<br/>
But what if the recipent doesn&#39;t want the gift? If the purpose of giving a<br/>
gift is to satisfy some need in the giver for the recipient to have the<br/>
gift, is it really a gift? If the gift giver has emotional stake in the<br/>
recipent appreciating the gift and the effort involved in providing the<br/>
gift, is it really a gift?<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be helpful for parents choosing formal education to see it<br/>
honestly. Despite the pictures of happy children using the various formal<br/>
curriculums, it&#39;s not about giving a gift. It&#39;s about meeting *parents&#39;*<br/>
needs. It&#39;s about molding and shaping a fellow human being against their<br/>
will into something we want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds harsh, but if it weren&#39;t against their will, then the children<br/>
would choose to do it on their own. If it weren&#39;t against their will, there<br/>
would never be instances where the parent is coercing the child to do<br/>
something for the curriculum that the child doesn&#39;t want to do. There would<br/>
never be instances where the child can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t want to finish that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about giving them the freedom to be who they are. Formal<br/>
education is about molding them into something we think is valuable to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The thing is my DS LOVES structure. He<br/>
&gt; likes to know what is happening next, and what is expected of him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean it must be unstructured. The days can be as<br/>
structured as your family needs them to be. What isn&#39;t structured, though,<br/>
is learning. If your family has a lot of activites, you can structure home<br/>
time into the week. But it wouldn&#39;t be unschooling to set aside a specific<br/>
time for them to do math or workbooks. If *a particular child* would like to<br/>
set up their own schedule to do that, then it&#39;s fine to help him set it up<br/>
and help him adjust it to meet whatever goal he&#39;s trying to meet, but the<br/>
schedule is his, not the parent&#39;s to enforce.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes when I&#39;m making dinner I&#39;ll get out dough to play with, or<br/>
&gt; paper and crayons, and he asks me what I want him to make. I tell him to<br/>
&gt; make whatever he wants. Right now he&#39;s in a preschool program, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; pretty structured and he loves it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think if everyone had independent creator in them, there would be no<br/>
picture book illustrators, or product designers, or wallpaper designers, or<br/>
architects, or programmers, or ...<br/>
<br/>
Doing anything you want can be overwhelming. Working around natural<br/>
limitations, meeting some predefined goal in your own way can be challenging<br/>
and inspiring. So when he asks, think of yourself as the picture book writer<br/>
and him as the illustrator and give him a spark to run with. If you&#39;re not<br/>
good at thinking up things spontaneously, brainstorm a wild list of things<br/>
and keep it in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable with no structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who is the homeschooling for? Them or you? Whose needs is homeschooling<br/>
supposed to meet? Theirs or yours?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t want to force my<br/>
&gt; children to learn anything that does not interest them. But I am not<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because you&#39;re unclear on what your goals are. And you&#39;re intertwining your<br/>
needs and agendas with their needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it still unschooling if you include typical school activities,<br/>

&gt; numbers pages, but now he is doing the alphabet pages.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the child has full freedom to choose to do it or not, choose to do it in<br/>
whatever manner they want, then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But I think I&#39;d also be aware that I might be getting satisfaction out of<br/>
seeing the workbooks being done and make sure I was being as attentive in<br/>
meeting their other needs. For instance I&#39;d want to be aware that I was<br/>
putting a high priority on replacing finished workbooks, but was setting a<br/>
low priority on things I saw as less important like making the trip across<br/>
town so they can buy the video game they&#39;ve been saving for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So if I pull<br/>
&gt; together a unit study when he shows an interest and lead the learning is<br/>
&gt; this still unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the child can say &quot;No thanks, I&#39;d rather go watch TV&quot; and you be<br/>
perfectly okay with that then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; During my research I&#39;ve discovered Reggio Emilia, an Italian method of<br/>
&gt; early childhood education. Here&#39;s a link that I found interesting. This<br/>
&gt; sounds very unschooling to me...but would it still be considered<br/>
&gt; unschooling if you sent your children to a school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re uncomfortable with unschooling but want to stretch the<br/>
definition of unschooling to encompass your comfort zone. What is it about<br/>
unschooling that you want? Ask yourself why you want to be able to call this<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling *will* make you uncomfortable. You can&#39;t have the benefits of<br/>
child chosen learning without letting go of control. You can meet your need<br/>
for guarantees by sending them to school or using some formal educational<br/>
method, but you have to let go of the illusion that it has anything to do<br/>
with child chosen learning.<br/>
<br/>
You can let them do some choosing and you do the rest, or let them choose<br/>
from a selection of things you feel are worthwhile, but it won&#39;t be<br/>
unschooling any more than eating some meat is vegetarianism. (You might try<br/>
an eclectic list for that style.)<br/>
<br/>
Though there are benefits to be had by being mostly vegetarian over eating a<br/>
heavily meat based diet, by letting the kids choose some over choosing<br/>
everything for them, there are benefits that you need to give up. One of<br/>
which is the label vegetarian and the label unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As for the school, if a child can go when they want to and not go when they<br/>
don&#39;t, if they can do whatever they want to when they get there and can say<br/>
&quot;No, I&#39;m perfectly happy doing what I&#39;m doing&quot; to activities suggested, then<br/>
I guess it&#39;s as close as a school could come to unschooling. (That&#39;s the<br/>
theory behind Sudbury Valley schools.) But since schools aren&#39;t the whole<br/>
world, and can only present a slice of the world, they have to use some<br/>
value judgements on what is better or more important so it would be pretty<br/>
impossible for a school not to have an agenda. It may match your agenda<br/>
which is generally the criteria parents judge a school by. But does it match<br/>
your child&#39;s agenda?<br/>
<br/>

I did not realize why I was so on the fence about unschooling. It really<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because you&#39;re unclear on what your goals are. And you&#39;re intertwining<br/>
your<br/>
needs and agendas with their needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it still unschooling if you include typical school activities,<br/>
&gt; textbooks, workbooks etc if that is what the child wants to do? My<br/>
&gt; oldest loves workbooks. He does not do them in order; he will flip<br/>
&gt; through them and do the pages that interest him. For a while it was<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; numbers pages, but now he is doing the alphabet pages.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the child has full freedom to choose to do it or not, choose to do it<br/>
in<br/>
whatever manner they want, then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But I think I&#39;d also be aware that I might be getting satisfaction out<br/>
of<br/>
seeing the workbooks being done and make sure I was being as attentive<br/>
in<br/>
meeting their other needs. For instance I&#39;d want to be aware that I was<br/>
putting a high priority on replacing finished workbooks, but was setting<br/>
a<br/>
low priority on things I saw as less important like making the trip<br/>
across<br/>
town so they can buy the video game they&#39;ve been saving for.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this still unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the child can say &quot;No thanks, I&#39;d rather go watch TV&quot; and you be<br/>
perfectly okay with that then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; During my research I&#39;ve discovered Reggio Emilia, an Italian method of<br/>
&gt; early childhood education. Here&#39;s a link that I found interesting.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; sounds very unschooling to me...but would it still be considered<br/>
&gt; unschooling if you sent your children to a school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re uncomfortable with unschooling but want to stretch<br/>
the<br/>
definition of unschooling to encompass your comfort zone. What is it<br/>
about<br/>
unschooling that you want? Ask yourself why you want to be able to call<br/>
this<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling *will* make you uncomfortable. You can&#39;t have the benefits<br/>
of<br/>
child chosen learning without letting go of control. You can meet your<br/>
need<br/>
for guarantees by sending them to school or using some formal<br/>
educational<br/>
method, but you have to let go of the illusion that it has anything to<br/>
do<br/>
with child chosen learning.<br/>
<br/>
You can let them do some choosing and you do the rest, or let them<br/>
choose<br/>
from a selection of things you feel are worthwhile, but it won&#39;t be<br/>
unschooling any more than eating some meat is vegetarianism. (You might<br/>
try<br/>
an eclectic list for that style.)<br/>
<br/>
Though there are benefits to be had by being mostly vegetarian over<br/>
eating a<br/>
heavily meat based diet, by letting the kids choose some over choosing<br/>
everything for them, there are benefits that you need to give up. One of<br/>
which is the label vegetarian and the label unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As for the school, if a child can go when they want to and not go when<br/>
they<br/>
don&#39;t, if they can do whatever they want to when they get there and can<br/>
say<br/>
&quot;No, I&#39;m perfectly happy doing what I&#39;m doing&quot; to activities suggested,<br/>
then<br/>
I guess it&#39;s as close as a school could come to unschooling. (That&#39;s the<br/>
theory behind Sudbury Valley schools.) But since schools aren&#39;t the<br/>
whole<br/>
world, and can only present a slice of the world, they have to use some<br/>
value judgements on what is better or more important so it would be<br/>
pretty<br/>
impossible for a school not to have an agenda. It may match your agenda<br/>
which is generally the criteria parents judge a school by. But does it<br/>
match<br/>
your child&#39;s agenda?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another issue I have is my DH. I know this is fairly common, but he is<br/>
&gt; not supportive of unschooling. He does not even want to talk about<br/>

  This phrase leaped right out at me.  Some schools squash the creativity <br/>
right out of children.  Forget art, it&#39;s all about listening and following <br/>
directions.<br/>
  I think a little guidance is ok if your child is honestly looking for <br/>
ideas, I have plenty of books that can act as starting points to different <br/>
activities; I just hate.....&quot;Now everyone pick up the black circle, add a dab <br/>
of glue, and place it right THERE!!  Great work!&quot;<br/>

Sherry,   It sounds like you are very similar to how I felt about 2 years ago,  until I read everything out there on unschooling and all the writings in Sandra&#39;s web and tons of other writings in other webs.   <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling made so much sense to me,   I had to just get through and dismiss all my schoolish thoughts,    and think through what was best for my kids.       I chose unschooling and havn&#39;t had a second thought since!!      <br/>
 <br/>
Loooove It!  As wheezy says, my 5dd, loves Dragon Tales. <br/>

Download both the evaluation version and the tutorial. The tutorial is<br/>
really good.<br/>
<br/>
(There are versions for both Mac and that other computer.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forgetting the term for the way it writes software, but you move the<br/>
characters and the program writes the code. But you can also write your<br/>
own<br/>
code too so it&#39;s good for beginners and more advanced programmers.<br/>
