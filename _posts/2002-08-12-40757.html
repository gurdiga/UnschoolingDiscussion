<br/>
&gt; Dear Ned Vare:<br/>
&gt; This list is not the place to bring these topics up. Please Honor That. You<br/>
&gt; said you would. The majority requests that you would, the list moderator and<br/>
&gt; the list owner have gently requested that you would. Although some have said<br/>
&gt; &quot;Don&#39;t speak for me... I like Ned&#39;s posts...&quot; This does not negate that this<br/>
&gt; list is still not the place for political grandstanding. There are other<br/>
&gt; lists more suited for this kind of debate. Please.<br/>
&gt; ~Nancy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned responds: <br/>
Exactly which topics are you referring to?<br/>
And please give a definition of political grandstanding and an example from<br/>
my posts. I&#39;m not arguing, I just want to know what you mean and how I&#39;ve<br/>
offended you. <br/>
<br/>
Then, please make me two lists of topics -- one that you think are<br/>
appropriate, and the other for the inappropriate topics. Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
