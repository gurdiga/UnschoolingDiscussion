<div id="ygrps-yiv-109501093">and that isn&#39;t just buttering you all up!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks by the way for all the reading info. I do know not to go to fast or<br/>
get pushy, made that mistake already, and want to thank you all for your<br/>
advice....<br/>
<br/>
but now to the completely and wildly off topic part.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find info out for someone else who is suffering from<br/>
infertility due to high FSH level. This person will be 41 this year, and her<br/>
FSH level was 15.8.  I know next to nothing about this. Anyone who has info<br/>
on how to become pregnant with high FSH levels, write me please?  But only<br/>
infertility/high fsh info...whatever it took. Herbs, allopathic medicine,<br/>
egg donations... whatever...I need to give the info to this other person who<br/>
is not the internet fiend that I am....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all....<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
Rachel Ann <br/>
