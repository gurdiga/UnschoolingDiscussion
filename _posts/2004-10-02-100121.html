&quot;Perfectly&quot; would be what?<br/>
Kids know square roots?<br/>
<br/>
I learned to perfectly not care whether kids knew square roots.  That was <br/>
easy.  Having been &quot;taught&quot; that three times in school, I don&#39;t &quot;know that.&quot;   <br/>
And yet I can drive a car, type like the wind, harmonize by ear, sew without <br/>
patterns. . .<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sure, all the unschool experts say go to the grocery store, make<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think what the people who say those things mean is to let go of looking for <br/>
math so that you can see it all around you.<br/>
<br/>
This article might help.  (And it&#39;s not about math, I can assure you right up <br/>
front. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s one paragraph from it, and it gets better (I like to think, anyway):<br/>
-=-If I went to the flea market to buy a torque wrench but I didn&#39;t know what <br/>
one looked like, I would have a pretty hard time just finding one by looking <br/>
around. It probably wouldn&#39;t be on a table with clocks made of cross-cut <br/>
cedar. Looking through a tray of cassette tapes wouldn&#39;t help. It would be <br/>
especially difficult if I didn&#39;t even know what a torque wrench was for. I might look <br/>
all through those wirey-boards and steel boxes computer-repair guy brought. I <br/>
could look for hours through cloth and paperback books and come home saying <br/>
&quot;Going to the flea market for a torque wrench doesn&#39;t work.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-But a lot of textbook math is<br/>
<br/>
rare in everyday life (why would a 8 yo need square roots, what the<br/>
<br/>
hell is an integer, distributive properties,... ).  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why would an 18 year old need square roots?<br/>
To make a few more points in a math placement test, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby happens to be 18.  He has in the past month or two learned &quot;integer&quot; <br/>
(or heard it discussed, maybe didn&#39;t &quot;learn it,&quot; but at his age it&#39;s just <br/>
vocabulary for ideas he already understands) and was in another discussion about <br/>
distributive properties.  Why?  He wants to take a GED and I was going through <br/>
the test booklet with him.   Math is strong in him, but the terminology and <br/>
notation are not.  Not a big deal.   Too many school kids are full of terminology <br/>
and notation, but the math part of them is crippled or dying.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s more about math and Kirby, too:<br/>

<br/>
Stop trying.  You&#39;re struggling with something that can happen on its own <br/>
when you stop struggling (and not until you stop struggling).  You&#39;re wasting <br/>
energy and wasting guilt you could use more productively elsewhere in your life. <br/>

I think the problem is your mental model of &quot;a full knowledge of math.&quot;<br/>

In my mind unschooling doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t or don&#39;t use textbooks.  <br/>
Instead it&#39;s about following a child&#39;s interests. <br/>

children can and will learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622637613">Chin up :),  I&#39;m glad your back!<br/>
 <br/>
Its really going to help you if you let go of your &quot;schooly&quot; expectations.  We have so many ideas and expectations put in our minds from school and they really do get in the way of unschooling taking off in a wonderful and free way.  I think you know that,  just let it go!<br/>
 <br/>
 ***I find it very difficult to<br/>
be creative enough to incorporate math into everyday life on a daily<br/>
basis.***<br/>
 <br/>
Then don&#39;t.  Really.  Don&#39;t incorporate anything.  Just live your lives.  Live them to their fullest, follow what your kids like and want to do and all those other things fall into place. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
This morning for example, while I&#39;ve been writing this post, my daughter has written a letter with a picture and a message.  She decorated an envelope, wrote and learned about addresses and return addresses, discussed why we need return addresses.  Then talked about why we need stamps and certain things in certain places on an envelope.  She&#39;s 6.   That&#39;s an awful lot of learning in just 30 minutes.  :) <br/>
 <br/>
If you want to talk about math, here ya go--  my other daughter (10) doesn&#39;t think she&#39;s good at math.  She thinks her older brother is better at it than her.  Although the other day as I was waiting for her to get some socks on to go walk the dog, she decided to fill in the blanks on a multiplication table.  <br/>
 <br/>
We had written out one, months ago.  She wanted to know some multiplication so I drew one up for her.  I started filling in some numbers and then she said, &quot;Stop! I want to do it now.&quot;  She didn&#39;t finish it right then,  worked a few and then put it down. <br/>
 <br/>
Speed up to our dog walking day, she goes up to get socks and sees the table and wants to finish it.  I always thought doing a multiplication table was fun, kind-of like a puzzle.  That&#39;s what she thinks, and that&#39;s what she was doing and had  to do at that moment.<br/>
 <br/>
As I was waiting downstairs for her, I yelled up to her, &quot;are you coming on the walk?&quot;  Her reply, &quot;yep, just a minute I&#39;m figuring out multiplication, but I&#39;ll be done in a minute.&quot; :) Really, if you have someone willing and able, you can learn an awful lot of math in a very short amount of time.  (Right Pam &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
Your children might not learn math everyday. They might not learn English or other subjects everyday.  But you know what, when they do learn them, they are in realistic moments.  Moments that they will remember and that&#39;s real learning.<br/>
 <br/>
***Im college educated but I just dont think that way.  Sure, it<br/>
happens occasionally and I seize the moment, but not enough to amount<br/>
to a full knowledge of math.***<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of us here with college educations,  you can get there, but it takes some work.  Read more, read more about deschooling.  Have you read lots of Holt&#39;s writings?  Have you read lots of unschooling books?  A lot of books written on the subject are by people who once didn&#39;t think in unschooling ways.  And then they saw the light.  &lt;g&gt;  You can too!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Oh and also,  maybe one of your children isn&#39;t going to be a math wizard,  maybe they won&#39;t have a head full of math concepts.  That&#39;s OK.  Trust them to learn what they need.  That&#39;s an integral part of unschooling. They might instead have a whole head full of dance steps, or musical notes,  or strategies from video games.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
You have to trust your child and you might be able to do more of that if you step away from those school thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t give up!  If you have wanted to do this for 5 years, it must be making some important connections for you.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kelli~<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
PS.  One last thing-- you said: <br/>
***Please tell us you dont do it all perfectly.***<br/>
 <br/>
We don&#39;t.  We all make mistakes and fall short sometimes.  For me its when I&#39;m tired or feeling impatient.  But I&#39;ve learned to breathe through those moments.  Knowing that this is the best and only way I want to live my life keeps me going.  That and my kids love it too!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Right,  but sometimes you have to stop looking for it,  for it to start happening.  <br/>
 <br/>
Know what I mean?  &lt;g&gt;   And be OK if it doesn&#39;t look like what you think it should. <br/>
 <br/>
I love the way Pam L.  touches on that in her video game talk/article.  Being accepting of the way our children are learning. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I stop and think about it and we pretty much do learn all &quot;subjects&quot; every single day.  But everyone is different.  My youngest might touch on everything one day and my son might not.  Then another day he&#39;ll cover a ton on everything and she&#39;ll just do one thing.<br/>
 <br/>
It goes in wonderful bursts,  here and there.  :)<br/>

basis.  Im college educated but I  just dont think that way.  Sure, it<br/>

<br/>
Sure, all the unschool experts say go to the grocery store,  make<br/>

rare in everyday life (why would a 8 yo need square roots, what  the<br/>
hell is an integer, distributive properties,... ).   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds as if you&#39;re looking for &quot;teachable moments&quot;---not unschooling at  all!<br/>
 <br/>
YOU&#39;re not supposed to be seizing the moment----they are, in their own  <br/>
heads, when they are ready. And it probably WON&#39;T look anything like what you  <br/>
expect.<br/>
 <br/>
My eight year old knows what square roots are. He can&#39;t figure out the  <br/>
square root of 27, but he does know that four fours are 16 and five fives are 25  <br/>
and six sixes are 36. He also knows that, if you push that little square root  <br/>
sign on a calculator, you&#39;ll get a really funny number sometimes. He also <br/>
knows  that lined up and down in dots, they make squares! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Does it impact his life at all to know it? I have no idea----he&#39;s just  <br/>
playing with numbers. But he&#39;s *not* afraid of them!<br/>
 <br/>
And Pam&#39;s first piece of advice is &quot;Do No Harm!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
My 16 year old didn&#39;t understand fractions (after eight years of school!)  <br/>
until he worked in a deli and had to make milkshakes. He (at 14) was told  to <br/>
fill the container 3/4 full----and suddenly the light went on! He came  home to <br/>
tell me that he finally understood what fractions were! &lt;G&gt;  Quarts, halves, <br/>
3/8ths. It all suddenly made sense! <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s doing real life things and figuring things out because he  needs/wants <br/>
to.<br/>
 <br/>
You don&#39;t have to make a &#39;lesson&#39; out of every little math  experience. <br/>
People make connections every day, but they have to have &#39;dots&#39;  to connect. Let <br/>
your children find their own dots---little bits of information  they gather from <br/>
living a rich life---and they will connect them in strange and  wonderful <br/>
ways.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695898836">What prompted all this, I guess, is that this week I put my kids in<br/>
public school for one day.  Two reasons: my 6 yo wanted to go.  He was<br/>
curious were all his friends go every day.  I wanted him to see for<br/>
himself. I wanted my 11 year old to be aware of his choices.  He hated<br/>
it.  He said &quot;the clock never moves, its so boring&quot;, and most of all, he<br/>
was embarrassed that he didn&#39;t know the math they were doing.  He was in<br/>
tears that night because he did not want to go back because he felt<br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
How do you deal with that; when they don&#39;t measure up to the school<br/>
kids?  I have not been pushing the math so he is behind them.  Of<br/>
course, he is ahead of lots of them in reading and other areas.  But he<br/>
cant see that. <br/>
<br/>
 He also was reprimanded for getting a drink of water and was afraid to<br/>
ask to go to the bathroom.  My 6 year old was reprimanded for throwing<br/>
his lunch garbage away before he was supposed to.  I was a wreck all day<br/>
worrying how they were getting along.  I still want them at home with<br/>
me, but I want them to make the choice.  I hung around the school most<br/>
of the day, and some of the things I witnessed were scarey.  But that&#39;s<br/>
a whole other subject.<br/>
<br/>
So... I guess it is hard to fit in when you are an unschooler.</div>

=So... I guess it is hard to fit in when you are an unschooler.=<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to start with the final statement and then go back to the earlier <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to fit in *at school* when you&#39;re an unschooler, but it&#39;s easier to <br/>
fit in the world when one has been unschooled for many years.   If I wanted <br/>
my kids to fit in at school, sending them to school would&#39;ve been my best <br/>
course.   If I had sent them and found they did NOT fit in whatsoever (which is <br/>
true of many kids, poor things, who have no option to bail), then any fantasy of <br/>
them fitting in better by being unschooled would be unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and school are so different that unschoolers can&#39;t simply be <br/>
plugged back in.  You can&#39;t drop them back on the assembly line as though you <br/>
never took them off.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I wanted my 11 year old to be aware of his choices.  He hated<br/>
it.  He said &quot;the clock never moves, its so boring&quot;, and most of all, he<br/>
was embarrassed that he didn&#39;t know the math they were doing.  He was in<br/>
tears that night because he did not want to go back because he felt<br/>
stupid. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The couple of times a kid of mine has said &quot;might want to go to school next <br/>
year,&quot; I&#39;ve told them then they needed to practice handwriting and formal math <br/>
(as appropriate) and I&#39;d be willing to help them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-this week I put my kids in<br/>
public school for one day-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was the 11 year old in on that, or was it done against his will?  You don&#39;t <br/>
need to tell us, but for me, I wouldn&#39;t put a kid in school cold who wasn&#39;t <br/>
prepared.  I wouldn&#39;t let one go on his own without trying to coach him toward <br/>
readiness for some of the things he missed (mathematical notation and &quot;Don&#39;t get <br/>
up without permission&quot; kinds of things).<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do you deal with that; when they don&#39;t measure up to the school kids? <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things to say to a question.<br/>
The nature of grading and comparisons in school require that 1/3 or more of <br/>
the kids who have always been in school &quot;don&#39;t measure up to the school kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have not been pushing the math so he is behind them.  Of<br/>
course, he is ahead of lots of them in reading and other areas.  But he<br/>
cant see that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a problem for unschooled kids, particularly from about 9 to 12, I <br/>
think.  Joyce and I talked about this with our kids (12, 13, 15) after the Peabody <br/>
conference and they had some stories too.<br/>
<br/>
Before 9yo/4th grade, the unschooled kids Do seem to be learning like crazy, <br/>
and looking at lists of &quot;expected competencies&quot; or what&#39;s expected in those <br/>
first three or four grades shows our kids are just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Then for a few years school does some things unschoolers don&#39;t do.  Forced <br/>
cursive handwriting, maybe (not all schools, and the UK has a &quot;connected up <br/>
writing,&quot; I think they call it, that&#39;s more like a simple Italic calligraphy hand, <br/>
and makes more sense).  Multiplication and division (formally drawn out, <br/>
column by column CERTAINLY not in one&#39;s head--that&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot;).  History &quot;facts&quot; <br/>
(more like simplified mythology) about Columbus and the American Revolution (<br/>
sorry to use U.S. examples, and maybe other English speaking nations have done <br/>
better with their rote beginning history than we have, so disregard this if so).<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the unschooled kids are still playing games, figuring out math <br/>
their own individual ways in their heads and with toys or whatever, and being <br/>
creative and &quot;immature&quot; (by school standards, meaning they&#39;re not involved in <br/>
shucking off their childhoods or their imaginations), and so that&#39;s the worst <br/>
time to compare them to schooled kids or to put them back in school, I think.  <br/>
(Worst for making unschooling look bad, at least, if not for kids&#39; liklihood of <br/>
slipping in smoothly.)<br/>
<br/>
Then when kids are 13 and older, the unschoolers are just starting to blossom <br/>
with all kinds of ideas and questions and maybe projects and some kind of <br/>
philosophical outreach (some of them, if they have the talents/interests to do <br/>
so).  They are living in the real world, and starting to care more about what&#39;s <br/>
outside of themselves.  Their questions are big and good ones.   Their <br/>
understanding of history and science doesn&#39;t look like school&#39;s, but it&#39;s often based <br/>
in their having started to connect hundreds of dots in their own worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back in school, 8th graders, 9th graders (translate for <br/>
Brit-system in your head if you need to, sorry) are about fed up with their <br/>
nearly-ten-years of forced short-term study/regurgitate/forget, we know you know this, <br/>
just do it again for practice.   Some of them begin to shut down, or to just go <br/>
through the motions without joy (if they still had any left at that point).  <br/>
They become resentful at their lock-up and have all of high school to look <br/>
forward to.  Not only more of the same, but the teachers start to outright SAY <br/>
&quot;That history they taught you when you were little was quite oversimplified, <br/>
here&#39;s what happened.&quot;   And some of them who read outside of school know well <br/>
enough that this version is just a higher-level oversimplification.  It&#39;s not real <br/>
history.  It&#39;s an additional layer of facts on the same few myths.<br/>
<br/>
So I think both &quot;learning curves&quot; (quite a generalization and won&#39;t apply to <br/>
all individuals) have a flat spot, but for unschoolers I think it&#39;s in the <br/>
middle, when they&#39;re 10, 11ish.  For schooled kids it&#39;s later, when they&#39;re 13 or <br/>
14 that they stall out a while.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873758149">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  But a lot of textbook math is<br/>
rare in everyday life (why would a 8 yo need square roots, what the<br/>
hell is an integer, distributive properties,... ).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is precisely why it is unnecessary. We make cookies to make cookies.<br/>
Last night we made two cakes, one as a birthday gift for Granny, and one to<br/>
keep here, because Jayn asked for it.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I just felt I was failing miserably while others seem to have it all<br/>
together.  Please tell us you dont do it all perfectly.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t have it all together. I feel I fall short, especially in<br/>
comparison to what my dd deserves, on a daily basis. If I am tired or<br/>
stressed I start to be disengaged with Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
But, by golly, Jayn (4.9) has it together. She knows precisely what she<br/>
wants to do every day, or night in our current schedule. The only time when<br/>
she is not just &quot;being&quot;, engaged and enthusiastic in the moment, is when I<br/>
have tried to force something on her. Even her sleeping is determined - she<br/>
is so difficult to awaken before she is entirely ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304974157"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This article might help.  (And it&#39;s not about math, I can assure you right up <br/>
 </span></blockquote>front. &lt;g&gt;) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/seeingit">http://sandradodd.com/seeingit</a> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That article reminds me of how I thought of unschooling at first, as I would look for &quot;subjects&quot; in our day to day activities.  This is not the same as being aware of subjects, something that is hard for me to let go of after nearly two decades of subject indoctrination.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for subjects, for me, meant that I would be happy to play games like Uno with the kids because it was &quot;math&quot;.  We were &quot;doing&quot; math!  In fact, when I first began unschooling, I thought that it meant learning by playing games instead of learning by doing worksheets.  That was nice and fun, but it wasn&#39;t unschooling.  It was schooling with different tools.<br/>
<br/>
Being aware of a subject might mean noticing that a child&#39;s comment on a paragraph in Harry Potter reflects an understanding of the theory of division.  The child may not have any knowledge of the meaning of the word, &quot;division&quot;, yet clearly understands the process of organizing something into smaller pieces, or divisions.  Sure, you can call it math because humans have decided that anything to do with numbers is math, but &quot;math&quot; isn&#39;t the point.  The point is reading something (or hearing, doing, experiencing, seeing something) and making connections in one&#39;s brain.  That is real learning.  The child doesn&#39;t need to know that it can be called division or math in order to have the thought process.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways it is a small, insignificant difference, to say that one looks for subjects vs. one is aware of subjects, but it can make a big difference in getting to unschooling.  If we only see evidence of our children learning when it looks like the school-learning we were taught ourselves, it will be difficult to accept unschooling as a viable method of providing our children with an education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456866448">Gee, now I feel better...  <br/>
The part about chucking him out of a plane was funny though.<br/>
My son had reservations about going, but he was curious and willing to<br/>
check it out.  It was kind of an experiment to see how the majority<br/>
live.  He was there 4 hours.  I told him if he didn&#39;t like it he did not<br/>
have to go back.  I said he should have told the math teacher that he<br/>
hadn&#39;t learned this &quot;stuff&quot; yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am bordering on depression here.  I love the idea of<br/>
unschooling.  I have read tons of books, websites, very inspiring<br/>
speakers. It all seems to make perfect sense.  Then you find yourself in<br/>
a group of people, trying to explain yourself and they all think you are<br/>
crazy and your kid will grow up to be stupid.  And I get insecure and<br/>
think I am ruining their lives.<br/>

Still sounds like it was something you decided for him, if he had <br/>
reservations but was willing.   If he had said &quot;NO, I don&#39;t want to,&quot; would you have <br/>
pressed?<br/>
<br/>
The reason this is important to consider (not to tell us, but to consider <br/>
inside you) is that if it wounded him, but he had no choice, school didn&#39;t wound <br/>
him and unschooling didn&#39;t wound him.  Putting him in a harmful situation <br/>
wounded him.<br/>

You could love the idea of skydiving, and collect coffeetable books about it, <br/>
and videos, and go to air shows and collect parachutes, but unless you jump <br/>
out of a plane, it&#39;s not something you&#39;ve really done.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another &quot;out of a plane&quot; moment for you.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

bicycles but you yourself never get on one and ride. . .<br/>

become more confident by getting on your bike and jumping out of an airplane <br/>
