<div id="ygrps-yiv-441625690">My DH came home today and said that he had talked to a co-worker who had <br/>
asked how old the boys are now. When he said, &quot;they are 3 1/2&quot; , his <br/>
co-worker said, &quot;they&#39;ll be starting school soon&quot;. He said &quot;no, they aren&#39;t <br/>
going to pre-k&quot;. She said, &quot;they&#39;ll be behind&quot;. He said &quot;they already know <br/>
the alphabet and how to count to 30&quot;. She still said, &quot;they will fall <br/>
behind&quot;. He just asked, &quot;Behind what?&quot; and dropped it there. I love my DH so <br/>
much. :-)<br/>
