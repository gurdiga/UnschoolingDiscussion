<div id="ygrps-yiv-712133545">I suppose this sort of ties in with today&#39;s geography lesson &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Jackie asked me if there are still countries with kings and queens.  I said <br/>
I know that England has a queen and a prince, and I thought there were <br/>
others, but was not sure about the details.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to look via google, but must not be using the right terms.  Is there <br/>
a list somewhere of current kings and queens?<br/>

three kingdoms (Britain, African country and an island someplace -- I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271806215">Interesting. Australia isn&#39;t listed. We are a constitutional <br/>
monarchy, but our queen lives in England.. We have a Governor-General <br/>
to represent her here. His (so far they have all been men) role is <br/>
almost entirely ceremonial.<br/>
<br/>
I assume the same is still true for New Zealand, also not listed, and <br/>
probably some other parts of the &quot;Commonwealth of Nations&quot;, formerly <br/>
known as the British Empire.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, wikipedia says Queen Elizabeth is head of sixteen nations,or <br/>
&quot;Commonwealth Realms&quot;, including, of course, Canada. Presumably none <br/>
of those are listed below. It seems that the Queen is only called the <br/>
&quot;Queen of Australia&quot; when she is actually in Australia, ditto for <br/>
Canada and I guess all the other &quot;realms&quot;, according to wikipedia.<br/>
<br/>
We are being drowned in &quot;Commonwealth Fervour&quot; here, as the <br/>
Commonwealth games are being held in Melbourne and start next week. I <br/>
guess that in the US they haven&#39;t rated a mention?<br/>

and no other issues, I don&#39;t see how this would help. Women who choose <br/>

politics or is it about unschooling? I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m sure Sandra <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826891884">From a home/unschooling perspective, since north American women have a<br/>
very long life expectancy, there is plenty of time after the children<br/>
are grown to go into politics.  <br/>
<br/>
Being a politician isn&#39;t necessarily imcompatible with homeschooling.<br/>
For younger women in politics, there are their spouses.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
unschooling is imcompatible with father as primary-care-giver and<br/>
mother as primary-wage-winner.  And wouldn&#39;t it be interesting to have<br/>
female politicians championing more egalitarianism on that front?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I &gt; may also have overstepped the mark in posting this to the group?<br/>
Is it &gt; politics or is it about unschooling? I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m sure<br/>
Sandra &gt; will tell me though &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Indeed.  I was listening to a former female member of the B.C. <br/>
&gt; Legislature&gt; saying that Canada is behind Rwanda in the percentage of <br/>
&gt; elected females in&gt; government.  Yikes.&gt; Robin B.<br/>

championing more egalitarianism on that front?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63169205">=-==-=-=-=-Purely in terms of unschooling,<br/>
and no other issues, I don&#39;t see how this would help. Women who choose<br/>
to go in to politics also choose to put their children in full time<br/>
childcare. I don&#39;t see how they could understand, or support, home<br/>
schooling never mind unschooling.=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>

How can it hurt?  Just as not all SAHM think ALL moms should stay home, not <br/>
all career women think ALL moms should have a career.<br/>
<br/>
The more women get involved in politics, the more politicians will be aware <br/>
of family/child issues.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, a woman could have a political career before or after childrearing <br/>
and still take time to be home with her own children.  Many dads/partners <br/>
are opting to be the stay at home parent when the woman has the more <br/>
lucrative career and some couples are finding ways to share both wage <br/>
earning and childcare.<br/>

And LOTS of women are not moms, by choice or by circumstance.<br/>
And some moms and their kids find that school+cash is better than  <br/>
homeschooling minus cash, by choice or circumstance.<br/>
