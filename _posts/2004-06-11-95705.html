<div id="ygrps-yiv-758445368">We were asked to announce this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A new unschooling discussion group has formed that focuses on <br/>
unschooling as it relates to sustainable/natural living.<br/>
<br/>
  So if you use a composting toilet, drive a biodiesel car, live in an <br/>
earthship (or would like to someday), or are just plain “crunchy”, you <br/>
might be interested in this group.<br/>
