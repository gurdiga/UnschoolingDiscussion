<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640147111">Ahhhh.... isn&#39;t that a fear we all entertain sometimes?  But you know, there are many many 2nd generation-ers that offer examples of this not happening.  No we haven&#39;t seen it all yet, but there are at least lots of 20-something year olds that I know that were raised at least AP if not unschooled that are incredibly feeling compassionate people.  I am hopeful that at least a larger number of them will not rebel.  I think rebellion is about teenage angst and I just don&#39;t see that in these children or in this philosophy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah....maybe. Probably. <br/>
<br/>
But I think the real difference is the actual *thinking* part. Even as toddlers, they are being asked to *think*---to use their brains and to contemplate. That doesn&#39;t happen in most schooled homes (---*most*---I&#39;m giving them the benefit of the doubt there! &lt;g&gt;). We aren&#39;t making our kids be obedient. We&#39;re encouraging free thought----and deep thought---on all subjects, even those we may disagree with.<br/>
<br/>
So even if Cameron were to become Baptist or---or a teacher! &lt;g&gt; I think he would do it with a lot of thought and reflection, NOT &#39;just because&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I think the conference helps here too. (PlugPlugPlug!) New unschooling moms may seem a little &#39;out there&#39; to their kids (and I guess we ARE when compared to the mainstream). But when children see that there are LOTS more like them in the world, that mom&#39;s not a total nut, that this philosophy is really out there and works for others----then I think it&#39;s more likely to take hold. When they see other children---who are not in school, but are smart and joyful and love to learn---who are interested and interesting. And then when they compare *those* children to their schooled friends. And when they see *older* unschoolers who are so full of life and not drained and struggling, *I* think that *they* think a little bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron didn&#39;t participate in the first two conferences (that were held HERE), but he really enjoyed himself last year. Made several very cool friends and *listened* to most of the presenters. He&#39;s a convert now! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We talk about it a lot---his local friends are all still in school. They&#39;re miserable. He can see that and appreciate his lot now. That makes a pretty deep impression. (I don&#39;t know how Duncan will react, having never been to school and having few schooled friends---that could make a difference!)<br/>
<br/>
Cameron was out in Albuquerque last week visiting Sandra and her family. He got to see it working big time out there too. We&#39;ll be in Jacksonville in a week on our way to Disneyworld and will stay with Gail and her family. I think those experiences are valuable---to see that others treat their kids respectfully too.<br/>
<br/>
AND I think that that could be the problem with the kids (like us) who were spanked and schooled and Sunday-schooled to death: we got out there in the &#39;real world&#39; and saw that not everyone IS like that! What a concept! *Some* people are NICE to their kids! Damn!<br/>
<br/>
I think we talk about it enough and SHOW it enough, that our kids will be more thoughtful. I think they will choose the better  (and better and better) choices BECAUSE they CAN: they&#39;ve had that experience for a long time: free choice. And their choices were respected, even when we didn&#39;t totally agree.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m as cynical-----REALISTIC----as you, Tuck, but I really think that the foundation of trust and respect WON&#39;T come back to bite us in the butts. I think our kids may go even further---be kinder and more trustful and more respectful than we could ever have been.<br/>
<br/>
I see it in Cameron already. I just got a postcard yesterday that read: &quot;Unschooling ROCKS!&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I&#39;m probably  too cynical, but I prefer the term realistic.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah----but realistically-speaking: given the choice to harm another or not: what would Will choose? To allow someone else free choice or not: what would Will choose? To rear a child with trust and respect or to demand obedience: what would Will choose?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m cynical as hell about most of humankind. But my own kids? I think they are remarkably way ahead of me on this journey. I think they will make better choices---they already *have*!<br/>

*******<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about these unschooled teens lately and how cool it is  <br/>
they are traveling around visiting each other.  Brenna flew to Boston a few  <br/>
weeks ago and stayed with Julian and Kathryn and Beth.  Chris came in from  <br/>
Chicago.  Andrew and Dagny were also there.<br/>
My daughter who had never really seen much snow got stranded with them all  <br/>
during that big blizzard and ended up staying there 5 days instead of 3.   She <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to mind at all..:-)<br/>
 <br/>
These teens met at the Live and Learn Conferences and have stayed in touch  <br/>
through e-mails and letters.  I see such joy in Brenna when she talks about  <br/>
these friendships.  They have an understanding about each others lifestyles  <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t get with her local friendships.  It is so cool that they  have <br/>
been able to make these friends all across the country. Not only do they  get <br/>
to experience other unschooling families lifestyles, they also are seeing  more <br/>
of the world both at the conferences and during their visits. It was so fun  <br/>
to see those pictures of Marty and Cameron in New Mexico and I can&#39;t wait for  <br/>
them all to be together again at the October conference.<br/>
 <br/>
It will be fun seeing what our kids do with their lifestyle choices.   My <br/>
kids have been exposed to  public school with their local friends (and  one year <br/>
in 1st grade for Brenna), our varied homeschool choices before  unschooling <br/>
and now unschooling.  At least they will have something other  than mainstream <br/>
public school as their only experience.  They have seen how  exploring and <br/>
discovering and living a life that is not widely embraced by  others can still be  <br/>
a good alternative and for us the best  alternative.<br/>

 <br/>
I wanted to join Kelly in &quot;plugging the conference&quot;!  It has made such  a <br/>
difference in all our lives.  The friendships and connections just are so  <br/>
special for us all.  Our home is always open for unschoolers and we are so  looking <br/>
forward to seeing you and your family, Kelly!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it tends to go the other direction.  I don&#39;t think two parents, <br/>
neither of whom ever was spanked, would easily become spankers.  Some things <br/>
might go back and forth, like hair length or formality of dress, but deep <br/>
disrepect for children and violence toward them wouldn&#39;t swing back and forth, I <br/>
don&#39;t think.  <br/>
<br/>
It only takes one persuasive parent of two to swing the other&#39;s opinion, <br/>
though, so like recessive genes, a peacefully-headed parent could fall to the dark <br/>
side by marrying someone intent on that way.   My dad could&#39;ve been a really <br/>
incredible parent if he&#39;s married someone thoughtful and progressive.  His own <br/>
upbringing hadn&#39;t been too harsh or crazy.  But he let my mom call those <br/>
shots.<br/>

<br/>
I know lots of people in their 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s whose parents were hippies in <br/>
the Santa-Fe-to-Taos corridor, and many of these offspring are conservative by <br/>
comparison, drive new American cars without any bumper stickers, have newly <br/>
remodelled and modern houses with no signs of hippy decor.  Some aren&#39;t, but some <br/>
are that way.  (Some are my cousin&#39;s five kids. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-How many of us ever said, my kid will never do that, and then  they did?-=-<br/>
<br/>
My sister is sure I don&#39;t know what my  kids do, and that they&#39;re not honest <br/>
with me.  She has problems, and left her husband and kids a couple of years <br/>
ago, and so WANTS to believe that my kids are having trouble too.  Mine are home <br/>
a LOT.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you mean things like &quot;My kid would never talk back&quot; or &quot;my kid would <br/>
never run around&quot; (which some childless people say) but I never had those <br/>
things as ideals or expectations.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think now that my kids would never be alcoholics, and I hope they <br/>
won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, the hippie-kids-gone-conservative had alcohol at home.  <br/>
Those I was thinking of who stayed hippiesh did not.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I can say the same of my own mother&#39;s parenting.  I have taken what I<br/>
learned from her and improved on it.  I haven&#39;t gone in the total opposite<br/>
direction because much of what she did was good. (Although not all)  I think<br/>
that she too, took what she learned from her own mother and improved on it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No rebellion.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I feel my parents lacked the ability to communicate well with us when we<br/>
were teenagers.   We weren&#39;t very receptive to their attempts either because<br/>
of the way school mentality makes about us vs. them.  Out of 6 kids, 4 of us<br/>
were pretty rebellious as teenagers. But I don&#39;t think rebellion has come<br/>
into play in any of our parenting. We haven&#39;t all gone in the complete<br/>
opposite direction, like I see some people doing.  But that is because much<br/>
of what they did was good and we could see that. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I have a really hard time picturing my children choosing a completely<br/>
different parenting route than I have taken.  I am sure they will improve<br/>
upon some things but I don&#39;t think they will go the opposite direction just<br/>
to be rebellious. That doesn&#39;t make logical sense.  If they were wounded by<br/>
my parenting, they might feel the need to run the other way, but why would<br/>
someone feel that need if they grew up feeling nurtured and loved and<br/>
listened to.  Just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  <br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
I think it goes in all directions, and no one can predict how one human  will <br/>
react to being raised by another.  It&#39;s not even about how they react,  but <br/>
how they are organically made and respond to the stimulus of the world at  <br/>
large.  <br/>
 <br/>
Having raised a kid or two (neither of which I&#39;m  disappointed in, btw), I <br/>
realize now it&#39;s not an exact science.   There are likely outcomes, but not <br/>
certain ones.  &quot;Likely&quot; means  that some parents won&#39;t get the outcomes at all.  <br/>
 <br/>
I cringe when I hear younger mothers putting all their eggs in one  <br/>
basket--whatever they&#39;re doing.  I want them to be aware that it doesn&#39;t  work out all <br/>
rosey all the time, no matter what you do.  The most perfect  kid is still not <br/>
perfect all the time and if you try &quot;methods&quot; and &quot;principles&quot;  and pat <br/>
yourself on the back because they &quot;worked&quot; then you&#39;re giving yourself  and those <br/>
methods too much credit.  It&#39;s a human being we&#39;re talking  about.  We can&#39;t <br/>
predict the outcomes.  I don&#39;t want mothers and  fathers to have so much of <br/>
themselves at stake or be disappointed in their kids  when it doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;.  If <br/>
it doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;, it&#39;s OKAY, because we don&#39;t  have any control or interest <br/>
in how a kid lives their life after their  grown.<br/>
 <br/>
I want people to know that it&#39;s better to have a peaceful home and to trust  <br/>
your children, but that they&#39;re still autonomous beings and some day they may  <br/>
make choices you vehemently disagree with.<br/>

This is exactly what I&#39;m talking about.  We can&#39;t imagine it.   Neither could <br/>
my parents imagine me getting pregnant at 19.  <br/>
 <br/>
We should try to imagine it and decide how we&#39;re going to react to it, at  <br/>
least.  It is NOT outside the realm of possibility that some of the most  <br/>
respected and heard unschooled children may choose differently than the way they  <br/>
were raised.  It doesn&#39;t have to be about rebellion.  <br/>
 <br/>
We give them free choice.  Be prepared for the choices.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, of course not. But do you really think that----let&#39;s use the spanking example: I know of no one who was NOT spanked who now spanks. Not one. Most of the people who WERE spanked DO spank. A handful of spanked children refuse to spank their own kids (more and more, it seems).<br/>
<br/>
So it seems that the gentler the parenting, the gentler the future parent.<br/>
<br/>
My parents spanked. And it&#39;s been hard for me NOT to, but I don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
I had no curfew, so it was *really* easy for me not to enforce curfews----oe even consider them. <br/>
<br/>
As a little child, I was made to attend church and Sunday school---and in high school was VERY into church and religion. Atheist now, but my son is looking into Buddhism and reading/asking a little of the bible (though I think teenhood is a natural &#39;age&#39; for researching spirituality and religion). I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;d be VERY surprised to find him in the Baptist or Catholic or *any* church, but I guess it&#39;s not an impossibility. But too---that&#39;s not something that&#39;s important to me, so I wouldn&#39;t really care that much.<br/>
<br/>
The parenting thing IS. Yes, I *would* be disappointed if he put his kids in school, spanked, or were just plain unkind to his babies.<br/>
<br/>
Those horrible teens years that we were warned about for the first 13 years of our son&#39;s life have NOT come true. I guess his easy personality has something to do with it---but I think the parenting and the unschooling have a whole bunch to do with pleasant teen years. I have no doubts that he&#39;ll be a gentler, kinder parent than I have been.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s that rubber band thing: the tighter they&#39;re pulled, the further they&#39;ll fly. YES! I&#39;LL SAY IT: I can&#39;t imagine mine would fly that far! &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I know that A doesn&#39;t necessarily lead to B---but I think we can come closer and closer and closer with the unschooling philosophy than with anything else anywhere.<br/>

different parenting route than I have taken.  I am sure they will improve<br/>
upon some things but I don&#39;t think they will go the opposite direction just<br/>
to be rebellious. That doesn&#39;t make logical sense.  If they were wounded by<br/>
my parenting, they might feel the need to run the other way, but why would<br/>
someone feel that need if they grew up feeling nurtured and loved and<br/>
listened to.  Just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  <br/>
<br/>
As I am reading this, it brings back a conversation my daughter and I had after leaving the Live and Learn conference last year. Before that she was not sure that she really wanted to homeschool her own children. And that is where the problem was, when she was younger I had tried that particular route -- we came to unschooling when she was around 12 or 13, but before were trying to follow a loosely based school at home. She just never thought it was a model she wanted to follow. But, after the conference she told me, should she have children she absolutely knew she would choose unschooling. I remember how excited she was talking about it. What an impression the teens had made on her, what an impression the speakers had on her. She now proudly tells people about unschooling, and tries very hard to explain that it is nothing like homeschooling.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parentsroom.org/SpankOp.htm">http://www.parentsroom.org/SpankOp.htm</a><br/>
Another response from Amanda from North Carolina: I am a mother of three<br/>
great girls. I am also a 3rd grade teacher, and my husband is an<br/>
elementary principal. We both believe in spanking, although I was not<br/>
spanked as a child. I resent my parents for NOT giving me the discipline<br/>
that I needed. I was never spanked, grounded, or given any form of<br/>
corrective punishment. I was left to run wild, and do whatever I<br/>
pleased. Since I am a rather passive person, I didn&#39;t choose to do some<br/>
of the things my friends did, but I did get into some things with them<br/>
that they were punished for doing. Some of them got spanked, and some of<br/>
them were grounded. This started when we were about 9 and ended well<br/>
into our teens. I never once got in trouble. I sometimes felt that I was<br/>
not loved because they wouldn&#39;t punish me.<br/>
<br/>
I want my girls to grow up to be independent, free to be who they are,<br/>
and not to fear their parents or think they aren&#39;t loved. My husband and<br/>
I only spank as a last resort, or for an act of deliberate defiance. Our<br/>
children love us, and know that we love them. It&#39;s never done in anger,<br/>
and is never abusive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forum.canadianparents.ca/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=UBB37&Number=17769&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=9&o=&fpart=2">http://forum.canadianparents.ca/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=UBB37&Number=17769&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=9&o=&fpart=2</a><br/>
There is a huge difference between physical abuse and a spanking. Every<br/>
child should be treated on an individual basis. I myself was not spanked<br/>
however I would not hesitate to spank my child if the situation required<br/>
it.<br/>
&quot;Judge not lest ye be judged&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.christianforums.com/t91927&page=12">http://www.christianforums.com/t91927&page=12</a><br/>
One important thing to note is this: I was NOT spanked as a child and<br/>
boy, I wish I was. I turned out to be a complete terror during my<br/>
adolescence and teen years/early twenties, completely out of control and<br/>
doing everything I was told not to. &#39;Grounding&#39; was tried, but never<br/>
succeeded with me. I am living testimony that some children NEED to be<br/>
spanked. My mom and I both would have endured a lot less heartache and<br/>
rebellion if I had been spanked at a very early age.<br/>

<br/>
I can ditto that for my kids.  They are NOT difficult as teens.   <br/>
<br/>
I have three teenagers.  Even though things have been peaceful here so far, <br/>
if I wanted to prove teens could be difficult, I could act in all the dumb ways <br/>
parents have done in the past (and in other houses in my neighborhood today, <br/>
and probably in most of yours) and I could, myself, directly cause them to act <br/>
in those horrible ways.  If I wanted to do that, I would start insulting <br/>
their friends and hobbies, saying &quot;No&quot; when they asked to go places, buying them <br/>
clothes they didn&#39;t like, making them sit at the table with us at mealtimes no <br/>
matter what they might rather do, run their friends off at 10:00 every night, <br/>
not offer them snacks when they were here, ask my kids whether their friends <br/>
are drinking or using drugs (without any evidence, but because some parenting <br/>
pamphlet or TV commercial said I should ask), I could search their rooms and <br/>
nitpick every single thing I could think of.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all.  It wouldn&#39;t cost me a penny, and I could ruin our relationships, <br/>
make them start to &quot;act out&quot; and cause them to want to live anywhere else but <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
All over the place, parents are being told that if they want to be GOOD <br/>
parents they will do some or all of what I&#39;ve listed above, and they would have <br/>
started it years before, with control and rules and suspicion and doing more <br/>
talking than listening.   We KNOW where that can lead.<br/>
<br/>
What has not been known is where gentle, attentive school-free relationships <br/>
can lead.  To suggest that half of them will end up as though we had done <br/>
nothing is based on school models from the past, I think.   Yes, some kids who are <br/>
forced to go to church leave church and some stay.  But we&#39;re not talking <br/>
about force.  I didn&#39;t force my kids to stay home and have fun.  <br/>
<br/>
We won&#39;t know for sure for many years how this all ultimately plays out, but <br/>
it&#39;s certainly a &quot;risk&quot; I&#39;m willing to continue to take, because things have <br/>
happened with my kids that I never could have imagined when I started off <br/>
letting a two year old have another cookie, and not minding if he fell asleep in my <br/>
lap instead of in his own bed.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I was just saying that there will be SOME who do it differently, and to  <br/>
their parent&#39;s dismay.  There are no guarantees.  None.  Action A  doesn&#39;t <br/>
always <br/>
lead to desired Outcome B. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How does that help people unschool though?<br/>
And it sounds, honestly, like advice not to bother to unschool.<br/>
If what we do has no guarantee/none (which is true) that is not to say there <br/>
are no advantages or new views.<br/>
<br/>
My desired outcome is that my kids avoided the pressures of school and the <br/>
risk of spirit-crushing that is so prevalent there.  My actions DID lead to that <br/>
outcome, for Kirby at least.  Marty is 16 and could legally drop out, I <br/>
think, if he were court-ordered to enroll.  Holly, at 13, has a DAMNED big spirit, <br/>
and might be beyond crushability by a school at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Not all parents who think they&#39;re doing what I did would have the same <br/>
outcome.  Some&#39;s kids are already partly crushed.  Some of the parents lack <br/>
confidence or joy or perkiness.  Some of the couples don&#39;t get along well enough to <br/>
provide a safe, peaceful, homelife full of smiles and patience.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to screw up unschooling, I&#39;m sure.  Someone complained to me <br/>
once that her kids were not getting along and she was frustrated with her whole <br/>
situation and in what seemed to be an accusing way indicated that she thought <br/>
if she just took her kids out of school and unschooled them, they would turn <br/>
out like my kids.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more to it than just not being in school.   There is positive <br/>
attitude and humor and joy to be maintained, and if a child comes out of a famly that <br/>
seemed less than ideal to him he might well fish around to do better or <br/>
different.  If he felt crowded, or small, or ashamed, that&#39;s bad.  We KNOW those <br/>
things are bad.  They are also specialities of school, and specialities of <br/>
put-down parenting.   <br/>
<br/>
By not having those negative factors daily in our home, and by trying to weed <br/>
them out entirely from our whole lives, that is an &quot;outcome&quot; in itself.  We <br/>
have worked (and it is work, it doesn&#39;t happen while the mom&#39;s mind and soul <br/>
are elsewhere) to have positive interactions and feedback.   So that <br/>
accomplishment is complete.  That &quot;outcome&quot; is checked off my list.  I didn&#39;t parent the <br/>
way I was parented.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t decide our sucess until after our deaths, we&#39;re not NEARLY living <br/>
in the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065782546">A woman whom I have known all the years of my homeschooling - nearly 18 <br/>
years, is a fundamentalist born-again christian of the long <br/>
skirts-but-not-quite-headscarf brigade.<br/>
<br/>
She was, apparently, brought up without restrictions, free to make her <br/>
own mistakes, free to make her own choices. She did go to school - I&#39;m <br/>
not talking home or unschooling here. I suspect that this was more a <br/>
case of deliberate neglect in the manner of  - um - Dr Spock? was it? My <br/>
cousins &#39;suffered&#39; from the same fashion. I think those parents back <br/>
then got hold of a theory that was almost what we talk about as <br/>
unschooling, TCS, Ap etc. but just missed the mark.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever, she, apparently, ran wild. She told me once that she just kept <br/>
going further and further hoping that they would take some notice, do <br/>
something to show they cared. I - and she - believe that they did care, <br/>
but that they were misguided by this theory and their lack of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
She has brought up her kids - sorry, children, kids are baby goats and <br/>
equate with sin to her - strictly. Control over who / how / when they <br/>
associate. Many requirements. And yet.... their homeschooling has been <br/>
very close to unschooling, especially in their younger years. Not until <br/>
they were close to &#39;school leaving age&#39; did any of the three start doing <br/>
formal study - and it was very definitely their own choice of study.<br/>
<br/>
A mutual friend persuaded them out of putting an intercom in their <br/>
daughter&#39;s bed room when she became a teenager - their intention being <br/>
to monitor her conversations to ensure she wasn&#39;t falling prey to evil.<br/>
<br/>
 This woman had not been smacked as a child. She had been brought up in <br/>
an aetheist family. He had been physically and mentally and verbally <br/>
abused in a &#39;christian&#39; household. They never smacked their kids, never <br/>
verbally abused them, were always loving caring people. Her upbringing <br/>
without smacking carried over, and obviously she was strong enough to <br/>
help her husband over come his childhood examples.<br/>
<br/>
I really like these people, who kind of blow away many of my <br/>
expectations, but in a way that I can rejoice in. It&#39;s great to see the <br/>
different ways people can emerge as unique individuals from the <br/>
influences of their childhood. Goes to show, anything&#39;s possible. Makes <br/>
life interesting, don&#39;t you think?<br/>

I think it&#39;s wise to recognize that there is  no perfect way, because it&#39;s <br/>
out of our hands.  The kids are who the kids  are. They make their own choices.<br/>
 <br/>
We can&#39;t 100% absolutely positively manipulate them or their environment to  <br/>
make them be the way we want them to be.  It saves heartache if we allow  for <br/>
all possibilities.  Again, liklihood is they will make better choices  than we <br/>
made or our parents made, but there is NO guarantee.<br/>

it&#39;s  certainly a &quot;risk&quot; I&#39;m willing to continue to take, because things have <br/>
 <br/>
happened with my kids that I never could have imagined when I started off  <br/>
letting a two year old have another cookie, and not minding if he fell  <br/>
asleep in my <br/>
lap instead of in his own bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
And also, I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t unschool in case there&#39;s a possibility it  <br/>
won&#39;t &quot;work&quot;.  I&#39;m simply asking people to recognize the possibility that  things <br/>
might turn out as you could never imagine.<br/>

How does  that help people unschool though?<br/>
~~<br/>
It helps people be realistic.  <br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
And it sounds, honestly, like advice not to bother to unschool.<br/>
If  what we do has no guarantee/none (which is true) that is not to say there <br/>
 <br/>
are no advantages or new views.<br/>

I never  once got in trouble. I sometimes felt that I was<br/>
not loved because they  wouldn&#39;t punish me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
========<br/>
 <br/>
NOT a quote from an unschooler, nor about unschoolers.  <br/>
 <br/>
But I don&#39;t think feeling unloved is going to happen with unschoolers who  <br/>
listened to their kids enough to take them out of school, or who spend all day  <br/>
with their kids making sure they&#39;re safe and having a good time.<br/>
 <br/>
That was a story about feeling unloved, and what I think we&#39;re after is  <br/>
families who were good to their kids, knew other things to do than spank, and  <br/>
whether THEIR kids are likely to spank.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-There is a huge difference between physical abuse and a  spanking.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Not a quote of or by an unschooler.<br/>
Also not true.  A spanking is physical, and it&#39;s an abuse of  power.  It is <br/>
intended to shame and to cause pain, and parents can and  should find better <br/>
ways to deal with their children.<br/>
 <br/>
Just in case anyone reading here thinks spanking is not physical abuse,  here <br/>
are some things you really should take a glance at:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking_">http://sandradodd.com/spanking_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spanking)">http://sandradodd.com/spanking)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
-=-One important thing to note is this: I was NOT spanked as a child  and<br/>
boy, I wish I was. I turned out to be a complete terror during  my<br/>
adolescence and teen years/early twenties, completely out of control  and<br/>
doing everything I was told not to.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Did she go to school?<br/>
 <br/>
Probably.  Very likely a factor in being out of control and doing what  she <br/>
was told not to.  That would happen with or without spanking (and has,  and <br/>
does).<br/>
 <br/>
-=My mom and I both would have endured a lot less heartache  and<br/>
rebellion if I had been spanked at a very early age.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just  another data point.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Not one that will help people get to unschooling, I don&#39;t think.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t want mothers and  fathers to have so much  of <br/>
themselves at stake or be disappointed in their kids  when it  doesn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;work&quot;. <br/>
If <br/>
it doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot;, it&#39;s OKAY, because we  don&#39;t  have any control or interest <br/>
in how a kid lives their life  after their  grown. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All depends on what &quot;it&quot; is and what  is considered &quot;worked.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
Precisely.  Our parents think they were doing what would &quot;work&quot;.   It doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter what &quot;it&quot; is.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;ve met your goals, you have nothing to worry about.  Many  parents <br/>
have not.  Many parents, probably some of them reading here,  do not even know <br/>
what their goals are, yet.  It doesn&#39;t help them to talk  about unschooling as <br/>
if there were a guarantee.  If you don&#39;t care about  the future, just this one <br/>
moment of how it can be with your kid right now, which  I&#39;ve heard you say <br/>
many times, how is that allowing for the possibility that it  will be good for <br/>
your child&#39;s future or not?<br/>
 <br/>
I wonder if there is any person on this list who can articulate better what  <br/>
I&#39;m saying.  I&#39;m not being pessimistic.  I&#39;m not being devil&#39;s  advocate or <br/>
telling anyone to give up becuase it&#39;s hopeless.  I&#39;m saying,  &quot;allow for the <br/>
possibility&quot; that things won&#39;t go as you intended.  If you  don&#39;t give your kids <br/>
that complete and total autonomy, then to me it is simply  manipulating your <br/>
kids for a desired outcome.  Which is very similar to the  mainstream.<br/>

This  woman had not been smacked as a child. She had been brought up in <br/>
an  aetheist family. He had been physically and mentally and verbally <br/>
abused  in a &#39;christian&#39; household. They never smacked their kids, never <br/>
verbally  abused them, were always loving caring people. Her upbringing <br/>
without  smacking carried over, and obviously she was strong enough to <br/>
help her  husband over come his childhood examples.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s cool.  Good hybrid.<br/>
 <br/>
I had a friend raised that Dr. Spock way, and her parents were  intellectuals <br/>
(a doctor and an artist of the hoity Byrd family that did south  pole and <br/>
other fancy stuff &lt;g&gt;).  They kept her pretty sheltered, but  within the <br/>
sheltered environment didn&#39;t control or punish her.  She was my  best friend when we <br/>
were nine to twelve, and my cousin&#39;s friend after that, so I  got to see up <br/>
close.  She ended up being pretty religious, but likewise  peaceful with her own <br/>
daughter.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby, years ago when he was 12 or so, said he might homeschool his kids,  <br/>
but he&#39;d probably let his wife decide.  I haven&#39;t checked back with him on  <br/>
that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Marty and Holly, who have been to conferences, have said they wouldn&#39;t  marry <br/>
anyone who wouldn&#39;t unschool.  I&#39;m not pressing any of them one way  or <br/>
another, and none of them are in imminent danger of mating up, so we have  lots of <br/>
time.  <br/>

<br/>
This is a sad kind of twisted thinking in itself.  It goes a long way<br/>
toward explaining why a person would later try to use love as a <br/>
justification for hitting their own children. <br/>
<br/>
Punishment is not a form of love.   It is revenge.  <br/>
<br/>
Love is the positive attention and consideration parents give their<br/>
children so that a child never has a reason to act out in desperation,<br/>
trying to get noticed by anyone for any reason.<br/>

Except that another of my goals is to help keep this list useful and to its  <br/>
purpose.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
This doesn&#39;t make much sense.<br/>
 <br/>
If I thought school was the only way for my kids to &quot;succeed,&quot; I would have  <br/>
them in school.<br/>
 <br/>
Having made a choice, I&#39;m working to make that choice rich and good.   What <br/>
they do with the start we give them is their deal when they&#39;re grown and  <br/>
choose their own mates and have children or not.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a random crapshoot.  I don&#39;t think there are  guarantees.  <br/>
But I know this:  There is no way my kids will have the effects of  having <br/>
grown up in a dysfunctional, alcoholic household.  They will not  have the <br/>
effects of thirteen years of compulsory schooling with it&#39;s  life-draining homework <br/>
and grades and irritating platitudes.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- It doesn&#39;t help them to talk  about unschooling as <br/>
if there  were a guarantee. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Guarantee of what?<br/>
Unschooling is fragile.  It is guaranteed to be a disastrous failure  if the <br/>
parents don&#39;t really move pretty quickly and directly toward learning how  to <br/>
make it good.<br/>
 <br/>
What guarantees do you think people are making?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I wonder if there is any person on this list who can articulate better  <br/>
what  <br/>
I&#39;m saying.  I&#39;m not being pessimistic.  I&#39;m not being  devil&#39;s  advocate or <br/>
telling anyone to give up becuase it&#39;s  hopeless. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
It does sound pessimistic and antagonistic just for the sake of argument  <br/>
(which would be devil&#39;s advocate, I suppose).<br/>
 <br/>
-= If you  don&#39;t give your kids <br/>
that complete and total autonomy,  then to me it is simply  manipulating your <br/>
kids for a desired  outcome.  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Autonomy&quot; at which point do you mean?<br/>
&quot;Manipulating&quot; children by providing them a peaceful homelife?<br/>
