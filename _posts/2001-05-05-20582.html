<div id="ygrps-yiv-784541036">OK, I don&#39;t know how to say this and have it come across right. First of<br/>
all, welcome to the list Valerie, I&#39;ve found some of your posts really<br/>
insightful and it is always very interesting for me (especially as the mom<br/>
of only young kids) to hear from moms who have seen the Unschooling  journey<br/>
from start to end. I wish you well with your book and hope it comes to be!<br/>
You and Laurie obviously have an interesting story to tell.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, this is a list of many, many people including some<br/>
neophyte unschoolers, and many experienced voices as well. I value it highly<br/>
because there is usually an abundance of varying opinions to be found.<br/>
People on the list contribute to subjects that they find they have info and<br/>
expertise on, and with hundreds of people on the list, that means we get a<br/>
wide variety of voices to hear and topics of discussion. When any one person<br/>
posts so many posts, then other voices start to go silent. People can no<br/>
longer keep up with the number of posts and discussions die down. It&#39;s good<br/>
netiquette not to respond to every single post as if it is a personal email.<br/>
Lately, 20 or more out of 25 posts in several digests were from one person.<br/>
And each post had  a long stream of the previous posts in that thread (it&#39;s<br/>
also good netiquette to clip only the relevant bits of information out of a<br/>
post you&#39;re responding to). If all the people who post on this list did<br/>
this, we would have literally hundreds of thousands of posts a day the list<br/>
would become unusable. Now I&#39;m not the list owner or anything, I&#39;m just<br/>
saying this as my own personal observation. I hope I&#39;m not offending anyone<br/>
or stepping on anyone&#39;s toes. so this is my own personal request:  I&#39;d ask<br/>
people to think before they post  if what they are saying adds to the list<br/>
as a whole. Personal replies like ((((Hugs)))) or &quot;That&#39;s great!&quot;  can go to<br/>
individual email, not to the list. I&#39;d ask people to clip extraneous stuff<br/>
from posts that they are replying to - for those of us on the digest we<br/>
sometimes get an entire digest full of forwarded and replied-to text and<br/>
very little substance. I&#39;d ask people to think before they post and ask<br/>
themselves if they are posting so much that hardly anyone else is able to<br/>
get a word in edgewise. I miss many of the voices who have not been speaking<br/>
much in the last few days and I hope to see more of a balance on the list<br/>
again with many different opinions weighing in. That&#39;s my request, just my<br/>
own 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

Personally, I love Valerie&#39;s posts and hope she doesn&#39;t stop.  <br/>
Having a lot of posts has not kept me from posting, but has <br/>
encouraged me.  Personally, the thing I need most is the <br/>
reassurance that when your kids grow up, they will not have been <br/>
damaged by unschooling, and that is what I am getting from <br/>
Valerie&#39;s posts.  It is very easy to delete those posts you don&#39;t <br/>
want to read by looking at the subject line, so that you don&#39;t have <br/>
to read them all and can keep up with those subjects you are <br/>
interested in.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-681720317">Robin, Thank you for wishing me well on the book... <br/>
<br/>
I was aware that I was posting a lot, but struggling with whether or <br/>
not I should ignore something directed at me or not. I appreciate you <br/>
pointing this out to me and I am not offended. A club I was in before <br/>
was a bit smaller and every little post was wanted. I&#39;ll clip from <br/>
now on. The last thing I want is for voices to go silent. I didn&#39;t <br/>
miss those voices, because I didn&#39;t read back past where I joined. I <br/>
apologize to anyone that has been overwhelmed by my posting. Frankly, <br/>
I was trying to figure out how to word a post saying I couldn&#39;t post <br/>
so much anymore. The book is needing the finishing touches and my <br/>
time is limited. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also responding to a lot of personal email. Those are really <br/>
tugging at my heart and maybe I&#39;ll give you guys some breathing room <br/>
and concentrate on them more. :-)<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>

     Valerie, just please don&#39;t go to the other extreme!  I am enjoying your <br/>
posts!  Your story about how Laurie grew up and what she is doing now is very <br/>
encouraging and needed.  I have even told a few people I know about this <br/>
recently and it definitely catches people&#39;s attention.  My sister, who just <br/>
had twin babies in Jan., is unsure about what she will do in the future as <br/>
far as homeschooling or not.  When I told her about your book, she said she <br/>
definitely wants to read it when it comes out!  Anyway, just wanted to let <br/>
you know that your posts are great.  <br/>

like to add that I believe this is a good point and would welcome that as <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343632863">We used to belong to a group here in Las Vegas, NV. Their name is R.O.C.K, <br/>
they claimed they were inclusive. But, they weren&#39;t. When I told them that we <br/>
weren&#39;t religious, and weren&#39;t homeschooling for those reasons, they said, <br/>
&quot;that is fine, we would love to have you and your children join our group.&quot; <br/>
Well, things ended up being pretty hard for us, and them. To make a long <br/>
story short, last month the moderator of the group was asked to leave for <br/>
private reasons. Another moderator was picked. This group was supposed to <br/>
make decisions as a group, however this was done on a night where there <br/>
weren&#39;t more than four families together. They changed many of the &quot;rules&quot; in <br/>
the &quot;middle of the game&quot;. Then they decided that if you weren&#39;t religious and <br/>
couldn&#39;t make each and every one of the events/activities, you shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
allowed to be part of the group. Forget about the e-loop, which for many of <br/>
us moms was a tremendous help, they also decided that it was no longer <br/>
allowed to be involved in the e-loop if you weren&#39;t an &quot;active member&quot;. So we <br/>
quit the group. I felt bad for my kids, because other than those children, <br/>
mine knew of no one else that homeschooled, unschooled or anything of the <br/>
sort. So now we are in search of a group that truely doesn&#39;t care about the <br/>
reasons why we homeschool, just that we do.<br/>

Start you own group! There will be several others like you who feel <br/>
short-changed! Make it a free online group (msn, yahoo, whatever). Only <br/>
unschoolers or only secular or totally, really inclusive. You can make it <br/>
your own with your own rules (or lack of! &lt;g&gt;). You&#39;d be surprised how many <br/>
will come out of the woodwork--I&#39;m sure there are many others in the area <br/>
with the same feelings.<br/>

R.O.C.K, they claimed they were inclusive. But, they weren&#39;t.&lt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Shellie:<br/>
<br/>
We had a similar experience when we moved about 5 years ago.  We <br/>
hooked up with a group that touted itself as totally inclusive.  <br/>
Turned out that their version of &quot;inclusion&quot; was precipitated by lots <br/>
of unwritten rules and lots of group precedents that no one but a <br/>
few &quot;old timers&quot; knew about, that could be pulled out at will to <br/>
manipulate anyone and any situation they chose to manipulate.  And <br/>
there were all kinds of secret meetings, in back rooms and vans in  <br/>
parking lots, meetings on nights when no one could or, as it <br/>
eventually turned out, no one wanted to attend, at which the same <br/>
kinds of exclusionary power-wielding decisions were made.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I started a new group, a non-directed community-based home <br/>
education support group.  This group has no dues, no heirarchy, no <br/>
regular meetings, no exclusions at all.  The only rule is &quot;no <br/>
spamming.&quot;  Folks sign themselves up by joining the yahoo group, <br/>
which has open membership.  Everyone is equally free to post info <br/>
about events and activities, resources, play groups, meetings on <br/>
topics, and anything else they think applies.  <br/>
<br/>
In our case religion and race were among the excluding factors, and <br/>
then, ultimately, the fact that I wouldn&#39;t just leave quietly and <br/>
take what they were dishing out under the veil of &quot;inclusion.&quot;  I <br/>
became that terrible person who just would not shut up and go away, <br/>
as many had before me, instead holding their feet to the fire of <br/>
their &quot;inclusive&quot; claim.  But the exlcusion continued, peaking in <br/>
some members of this group holding a teen homeschool prom and, after <br/>
heated secret discussion (meaning I wasn&#39;t in on in any of this) I <br/>
was informed that my daughter would not be allowed to attend their <br/>
prom.  Errr, umm, by the way, who said she was interested in the <br/>
first place?  She already had dates for three other formal dances and <br/>
definitely was not interested, but this group was so determined to <br/>
keep her away from their kids and their prom that they held meetings, <br/>
made up lies, and ultimately had one mother meet with me, under a <br/>
false pretense, then later email me to tell me that &quot;they&quot; had <br/>
decided that my daughter would not be allowed to attend this prom.  <br/>
<br/>
Why?  No one had to give an answer to that.  But we know it wasn&#39;t <br/>
because my daughter was some terrible misbehaving delinquent teen.  <br/>
She is a lovely, dedicated, hard-working young woman, a competitive <br/>
figure skater who skates 2-4 hours daily, involved in lots of other <br/>
great volunteer activities, as well as working at a part-time job.  <br/>
The only &quot;crime&quot; she may have committed was being born into a bi-<br/>
racial low-income family.  Surely it couldn&#39;t be that, could it?  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and she was born to a mother who doesn&#39;t take it lying down, <br/>
doesn&#39;t just roll over and play dead when folks start wielding power <br/>
abusively.  So most likely their reasons for excluding my daughter <br/>
were either that she is bi-racial (in case folks don&#39;t know, racism <br/>
is illegal, and not nice!), or because her mother is a strong <br/>
individual who doesn&#39;t just back down and go away when folks are <br/>
behaving badly, violating their own rules, making up new ones to fit <br/>
every situation they don&#39;t like, engaging in libel and slander, and <br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so now it&#39;s a long story, I know.  But the end result has been <br/>
a wonderful new kind of group, that anyone can join whenever they <br/>
please, and leave whenever they please, too.  All approaches to <br/>
learning are welcomed, all religions or no religion accepted, all <br/>
kinds of activities and events are promoted, and all kinds of topics <br/>
discussed on the e-list.  We just finished up a week or so on gun <br/>
control after a group of us went to see Michael Moore&#39;s &quot;Bowling For <br/>
Columbine,&quot; and no one flamed or slammed or dissed anyone, though <br/>
opinions ran the gamut, to be sure.  I learned a lot.  What a great <br/>
group!  We are now about 200 strong and I believe this group will <br/>
continue to grow and proper long after I am gone.  <br/>
<br/>
So, start your own.  I started this one all by myself, as an outcast, <br/>
and slowly but surely, more and more families have joined, and are <br/>
still joining, every single day.  A new kind of group, with no one in <br/>
charge, no rules to waste hours and hours meeting to create or to <br/>
break, no purpose but to find and share interesting stuff with each <br/>
other that we feel might be of interest to other home educators.   <br/>
<br/>
And there are some group perks, too.  Since I am a certified teacher <br/>
I offer a free group &quot;portfolio assessment&quot; day to all group members <br/>
who join before Jan 1st of any year, and who remain members through <br/>
the assessment date.  And lots of others find or organize and promote <br/>
lots of wonderful activities and events and resources for our <br/>
children and families.  All great group perks!  And we have our <br/>
24/365 around the clock newsletter on yahoo!groups.  Much better than <br/>
the old hard copy version that many other groups publish with <br/>
deadlines that always miss something important, and the regulation of <br/>
which often causes plenty of uproar, not to mention the high cost to <br/>
members.  This new kind of totally inclusive home education support <br/>
group can work and I hope that others will try it.  If you do please <br/>
let me know how it works in your community.  This one has been going <br/>
about 2-1/2 years now.<br/>
<br/>
Say &quot;yes&quot; to total inclusion, and &quot;no&quot; to all forms of exclusion!  By <br/>
the way, many who join our group also belong to other little groups, <br/>
some of which are religion specific, or locality specific, or <br/>
educational philosophy specific.  No matter, all are welcome!<br/>

  &lt;&gt;We used to belong to a group here in Las Vegas, NV. Their name is <br/>
  R.O.C.K, they claimed they were inclusive. But, they weren&#39;t.&lt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Shellie:<br/>
<br/>
  We had a similar experience when we moved about 5 years ago.  We <br/>
  hooked up with a group that touted itself as totally inclusive.  <br/>
  Turned out that their version of &quot;inclusion&quot; was precipitated by lots <br/>
  of unwritten rules and lots of group precedents that no one but a <br/>
  few &quot;old timers&quot; knew about, that could be pulled out at will to <br/>
  manipulate anyone and any situation they chose to manipulate.  And <br/>
  there were all kinds of secret meetings, in back rooms and vans in  <br/>
  parking lots, meetings on nights when no one could or, as it <br/>
  eventually turned out, no one wanted to attend, at which the same <br/>
  kinds of exclusionary power-wielding decisions were made.  <br/>
<br/>
  So, I started a new group, a non-directed community-based home <br/>
  education support group.  This group has no dues, no heirarchy, no <br/>
  regular meetings, no exclusions at all.  The only rule is &quot;no <br/>
  spamming.&quot;  Folks sign themselves up by joining the yahoo group, <br/>
  which has open membership.  Everyone is equally free to post info <br/>
  about events and activities, resources, play groups, meetings on <br/>
  topics, and anything else they think applies.  <br/>
<br/>
  In our case religion and race were among the excluding factors, and <br/>
  then, ultimately, the fact that I wouldn&#39;t just leave quietly and <br/>
  take what they were dishing out under the veil of &quot;inclusion.&quot;  I <br/>
  became that terrible person who just would not shut up and go away, <br/>
  as many had before me, instead holding their feet to the fire of <br/>
  their &quot;inclusive&quot; claim.  But the exlcusion continued, peaking in <br/>
  some members of this group holding a teen homeschool prom and, after <br/>
  heated secret discussion (meaning I wasn&#39;t in on in any of this) I <br/>
  was informed that my daughter would not be allowed to attend their <br/>
  prom.  Errr, umm, by the way, who said she was interested in the <br/>
  first place?  She already had dates for three other formal dances and <br/>
  definitely was not interested, but this group was so determined to <br/>
  keep her away from their kids and their prom that they held meetings, <br/>
  made up lies, and ultimately had one mother meet with me, under a <br/>
  false pretense, then later email me to tell me that &quot;they&quot; had <br/>
  decided that my daughter would not be allowed to attend this prom.  <br/>
<br/>
  Why?  No one had to give an answer to that.  But we know it wasn&#39;t <br/>
  because my daughter was some terrible misbehaving delinquent teen.  <br/>

Almost exact same thing happened to us a couple of years ago.  We also were relatively new to the area and because we didn&#39;t attend church etc the kids at the homeschool group were really all the kids we knew.  <br/>
<br/>
Those of us who quit the original group, or in my opinion were forced to leave, created our own group.  Yes, it&#39;s smaller.  But we&#39;re all also very close.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there others from your old, now exclusionist group, who have left?  Or folks your were especially close to in the old group who may not have left yet, but may?  Give them a call.<br/>

Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
Well, the other group, the one where I encountered such hostility and <br/>
exclusion, had a newsletter, too.  And I was the publisher, for a <br/>
while, but I soon learned that a small but very vocal group of &quot;old <br/>
time&quot; members had all kinds of rules about what I should do and how I <br/>
should do it, even though I was an unpaid volunteer.  Didn&#39;t matter, <br/>
these members took it upon themselves to tell me how to do <br/>
everything; what I could and could not do, what I could and could not <br/>
change, what they did and did not like, etc.  The publisher was the <br/>
person on whom all the back room political drudge got dumped.  <br/>
Ridiculous!!!!  No volunteer job is worth what I had to put up with.  <br/>
I mean I only had years and years (too many to mention!) of <br/>
journalism and newsletter publishing experience, but the desktop <br/>
publishing was new to me, so I learned on the job, basically on my <br/>
own, with a little telephone or email assistance from the previous <br/>
publisher and a lot of help from my then pre-teen daughter.  We <br/>
actually partnered on the publishing of the newsletter.  That was the <br/>
fun part!<br/>
<br/>
So, when I started the new group I was determined to steer very clear <br/>
of that hard-copy expense (it was costing close to $2.00 per copy per <br/>
month) and all its accompanying contentiousness.  Instead of worrying <br/>
about who has computer access and who doesn&#39;t we offer to help anyone <br/>
who wants to join by meeting them at their local library branch where <br/>
they can have free internet access, set up their own free e-mail <br/>
account, and get on the list.  And individual members have often <br/>
volunteered to meet with someone in their own home to help them learn <br/>
basic internet skills so they can join and access the list.  Some <br/>
members have even donated their old computer systems to new members <br/>
who don&#39;t have them.  <br/>
<br/>
I mean isn&#39;t unschooling all about learning?  Are we not all learning <br/>
new things all the time?  Doesn&#39;t our learning how to access and use <br/>
the internet set a good example for our children who might be <br/>
intimidated about learning something new?  Of course, most of the <br/>
time they could easily teach us what we need to know about computers <br/>
and the internet in a minute, right?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;We have no executive or regular meetings other than the newsletter <br/>
meetings.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have no executives in CATCH.  In the other group we didn&#39;t have <br/>
newsletter meetings.  All the meetings had to do with organizational <br/>
hocus pocus.  All newsletter info was emailed to the publisher.  I <br/>
was not allowed to change or edit anything that was sent in by the <br/>
members.  Nor was I allowed to do much of anything that came close to <br/>
real publishing.  Basically I was a desktop publishing tech; I <br/>
copied, cut, and pasted, that&#39;s all.  That had been established by my <br/>
predecessor.  Much easier to do desktop publishing with email <br/>
newsletter submissions!  And a few rare members would mail something, <br/>
once in a while, though I needed to get it earlier to have time to <br/>
type it in, a nuisance in my opinion, especially when the newsletter <br/>
was getting up to 32 full pages.<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&gt;People can and do organize regular support group meetings, and <br/>
there are tons of activities organized.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here.  CATCH members organize whatever suits their fancy.  We <br/>
have had speakers, and topic groups, and play groups, and <br/>
event/activity organizing groups.  But it&#39;s basically up to the folks <br/>
who want to have something happen.  We don&#39;t do things just because <br/>
it was done before, or done a certain way before.  And folks have to <br/>
organize the financing on their own, too.  Good lessons in <br/>
organization and management skills, fundraising, for all involved.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;My son doesn&#39;t take part mostly, but my granddaughter is close to <br/>
needing a daytimer for all the activities she takes part in through <br/>
the group.  She&#39;s taking ballet, drama, first aid, renaissance <br/>
dancing and probably a bunch of other stuff I can&#39;t remember right <br/>
now.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s schedule used to be a lot like your granddaughter&#39;s, <br/>
but now that she&#39;s 15 it is a little different.  Still hectic at <br/>
times, but a different kind of hectic, with a job and an active <br/>
social life thrown in for good measure.  Sounds like your group is <br/>
doing a great job.  Keep up the good work!<br/>

&gt; about who has computer access and who doesn&#39;t we offer to help anyone<br/>
&gt; who wants to join by meeting them at their local library branch where<br/>
&gt; they can have free internet access, set up their own free e-mail<br/>

those in our area who do have internet access don&#39;t get on very <br/>

newsletter to everyone in the group who had an email address.  I <br/>
asked people to reply to me if they got the newsletter in their email <br/>
and if they prefer it that way.  Most people did not reply and now <br/>
get the newsletter by snail mail.  I talked to some of them, who said <br/>
that even though they have an email address they only get on the <br/>
computer to check email once every two weeks.  Often I send email to <br/>
homeschoolers in our group and don&#39;t get a reply.  I&#39;ll ask them if <br/>
they got the email I sent them a week ago and they&#39;ll say, &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>

going to try to get a grant to get the library system computerized, <br/>
so that we could have a online card catalog instead of the old <br/>
fashioned card catalog, but the library board doesn&#39;t want the <br/>
grant.  No one who works at the library (except the head librarian <br/>
who was recently hired) knows how to use a computer.  <br/>

etc.  Anyone who can&#39;t afford that just has to say so and we <br/>
subsidize them.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once I took on the newsletter and quickly calculated that we were not <br/>
taking in enough from members to even cover the cost of printing, let <br/>
alone mailing, dues had to go up.  Our treasurer then admitted that <br/>
we were in the red and dues went to $35/year.  I think that&#39;s very <br/>
high.  Yes, the group also had the policy that anyone who could not <br/>
afford membership could ask to be subsidized, though that fact was <br/>
rarely communicated to members.  As soon as I took on the job I got <br/>
bids for printing and changed formatting to cut newsletter expenses <br/>
significantly, almost in half.  I also suggested other ways to cut <br/>
printing costs even more, but the group never followed through on <br/>
those suggestions.  Then came the battle to get the dues lowered <br/>
again, so that the group wasn&#39;t just accruing money in the bank <br/>
without ever having consulted members about why the group was doing <br/>
this, for what purpose all the extra money was intended.  That took <br/>
almost two years to straighten out.  Dues are now down to $24 and <br/>
that covers the monthly hard-copy newsletter with some to spare.<br/>
<br/>
What I saw was that money and treasury and anything to do with money <br/>
was very divisive.  Back to power and control issues.  Though many <br/>
folks never recognized that as the source of division.  Instead they <br/>
saw only the people who brought up the subject of money as divisive <br/>
forces.  So in the new group I eliminated the need for any kind of <br/>
dues.  That is why there is no hard copy newsletter.  Besides, when I <br/>
analyzed all the information that was in the newsletter, even though <br/>
we organized and participated in many, many activities, I found that <br/>
about 3/4 of the newsletter was not information that I needed to keep <br/>
on hand.  So, with the listserv format folks only print out what they <br/>
are specifically interested in.  And the archives are always there <br/>
for quick reference, going all the way back to the beginning.  I love <br/>
that feature!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;I think people are gradually moving towards computers and the <br/>
internet, but I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s our place to push them. (being <br/>
an unschooler and all &lt;g&gt;)&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess we just have a different perspective.  I took my first <br/>
fortran course in 1963 when the computer was the whole building. <br/>
Almost forty years later I figure folks are way past &quot;gradually <br/>
moving towards computers.&quot;  I may be Quaker, but I am not Amish.  <br/>
Since many ways to access computers and the internet exist in today&#39;s <br/>
world I don&#39;t feel that it is pushing anyone.  From free access in <br/>
libraries and community centers, to web TV, to friends helping <br/>
friends there are many ways to learn about computers today.  It is <br/>
simply giving folks the opportunity to participate in the real <br/>
world.  Few jobs today do not require the ability to use computers <br/>
and access the internet.  My 15-year-old daughter works in a gift <br/>
shop and she has to use computers and the internet in her job daily.  <br/>
Choosing not to use computers and the internet is a valid choice, but <br/>
as restrictive as any other kind of exclusionary choice, like <br/>
religion or educational philosophy, or a pre-packaged curriculum.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;No wonder you hated it.  I *do* edit what comes in.  I took the job <br/>
because I want to get into freelance editing, so I&#39;m learning on <br/>
the &quot;job&quot;.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am a very good editor.  That is part of my job history.  But the <br/>
whole thing in the group had more to do with power and control <br/>
issues, the usual group dynamic crap, than with editing skills.  In <br/>
the listserv format everyone gets to edit their own submissions!  <br/>
Great home education, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Either folks learn to <br/>
spell check and grammar check, or they accept the consequences of <br/>
putting what they write out there in whatever form they choose to <br/>
present it.  I have no objections to that.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling is, after all, one of those things that brings the issue of <br/>
class consciousness into our lives.  Back when our Constitution was <br/>
being written many folks spelled many words differently.  And no one <br/>
got too upset about it as long as they could understand what was <br/>
being written.  But then education and class consciousness drifted in <br/>
and those who spelled one way were considered the best and brightest, <br/>
and those who spelled another way were considered &quot;uneducated.&quot;  It <br/>
is a construct that has remained with us, for better or worse, though <br/>
I don&#39;t think most people understand its class basis.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&gt;I&#39;m glad you were able to get a group going that meets your (and <br/>
other people&#39;s) needs.  I know there has been a lot of what you <br/>
describe going on with the local Christian group, but I don&#39;t have to <br/>
deal with it.  Phew!&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yup.  Life is much nicer when so much energy isn&#39;t tied up bickering <br/>
about things that don&#39;t even bleep on our radar screens anymore.<br/>

Information and money--the biggest things groups ever fight about.<br/>
<br/>
One compromise solution is to have copies of the lists of members and <br/>
upcoming events, but only hand them out in person at meetings.  Single <br/>
sheets.  Only print a few at a time, date them, and if someone wants to take <br/>
extras to give to other friends, fine.  But don&#39;t promise to mail anything, <br/>
because it&#39;s expensive and something to fight about.<br/>
