I know exactly what you mean about the cleaning thing.  I am an &quot;A number<br/>
one&quot; slob but even I reach a point.  Poor dh is very compulsive and I know<br/>
he does much better with stress as well if we can at least find the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Problem we have is the world is just such a fun place and there are so many<br/>
things we want to do.  Just today, we fed and milked all the animals and<br/>
took off into town.  We bought stuff for our new chickens (while dh was<br/>
helping build a chicken roost last night, he lamented not marrying the<br/>
&quot;high-maintenance, likes to shop&quot; wife), stopped at the market for echinacea<br/>
because Adriane needs to get a grip on her cold before her state gymnastics<br/>
meet this weekend and ended up enthralled by all the bulk stuff, went in<br/>
search of Day of the Dead things to do, bought pumpkins, came home had lunch<br/>
and the big kids are helping the little kids decorate theirs with markers<br/>
(the big kids will carve theirs this evening).<br/>
<br/>
So, per usual, cereal bowls are still in the sink, laundry is yet to be<br/>
folded and we stick to the kitchen floor &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
