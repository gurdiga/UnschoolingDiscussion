&gt; &gt; But mostly, I stall.  I hate to clean.  And I wish I had a steam <br/>
&gt; &gt; carpet <br/>
&gt; &gt; cleaner like the ones they rent, but they cost $800 so I don&#39;t have <br/>
&gt; &gt; one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got one for $125 or so, on sale at Target from somewhere under $200. It<br/>
&gt; looks like  a vacuum cleaner, that style, but it&#39;s a steam cleaner.<br/>
&gt; Worked great, I was always amazed at how much dirt was in the crpets.<br/>

together to buy a steam cleaner. We love it! <br/>
