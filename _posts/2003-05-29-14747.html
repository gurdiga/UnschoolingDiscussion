   I have been lurking for a few days, getting a feel for your group. Just <br/>
had to give you this site. There are a lot of people who do not immunize, we <br/>
blend in well! :)<br/>

our visas turned down cos the kids are unvaccinated and had to appeal just to get in and join their<br/>
American father. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr<br/>
Virginia allows a religious exemption so we use that but if it was abolished I would be on the next plane<br/>
home! As I will be if the Dubya gang make the smallpox one compulsory.<br/>
Pity the poor people in  Mississpi and West Virginia, the only two states not to allow a religious<br/>
exemption, only a medical one :-(<br/>
