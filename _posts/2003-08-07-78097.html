&lt;&lt; My favorite ages are toddlers and teens---the two that *most* people find <br/>
the <br/>
most &quot;choresome&quot; and difficult. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine too, I think, though Holly has been a joy at all stages.  Maybe I just <br/>
like girls better!  (But I like my boys more than most other boys&#39; moms seem to <br/>
like theirs.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty was never as difficult as Kirby, either.  I&#39;ve liked all my kids all <br/>
the time, but that doesn&#39;t keep some parts of their lives from standing out <br/>
almost magically.  Marty was the sweetest four year old I&#39;ve ever met.<br/>

stupid.-=-<br/>

<br/>
The same way it helps to think well of our children, it helps to think well <br/>
of others we deal with if we possibly can.  Looking for trouble isn&#39;t smart, <br/>
nor helpful to the list nor helpful to others trying to get unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. . . and I&#39;m not stupid.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The movie Forrest Gump has a famous line:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a play on a southern idiom: &quot;Beauty is as beauty does.&quot;  Appearance <br/>
doesn&#39;t make one good.<br/>
<br/>
If this list seems to outsiders to have &quot;a clique,&quot; then that&#39;s the paranoid <br/>
lost feeling in the reader.  The &quot;clique,&quot; if there is one, consists of those <br/>
who are being consistently helpful to others and who are actually living <br/>
successful unschooling lives and then spending their spare time trying to help <br/>
others do the same.  Yes, I will defend ANYone here who is goodheartedly trying to <br/>
help, against anyone who is pointedly trying to make them look small.  And <br/>
then some people WILL say &quot;OH well, the I guess she&#39;s in your clique TOO!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a deep immaturity in that.  Immaturity can be overcome.  Paranoia <br/>
can be overcome.  Feeling like an outsider can be overcome, IF you can see it <br/>
for what it is.<br/>
<br/>
If one posts to make trouble instead of to help others understand <br/>
unschooling, one is not being goodhearted nor helpful.  If one posts &quot;Kelly, you make me <br/>
sick, Kelly,&quot; one is not posting about issues, but about individuals.<br/>
