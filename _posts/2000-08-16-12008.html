 </span></blockquote>Oh my Kandice!  I would have her checked for allergies right away!!  In the meantime, until you can get in to see an allergist, start an elimination diet beginning with all the major suspicious items (dairy, wheat, etc) and remember that it may take weeks for effects to leave here system, so be patient.  Stick to whole foods, raw fruits and veggies (as long as she is not allergic to them) and get educated about allerges if you are not already.  Look for behavior changes after mealtime, or addict type behavior in demanding certain foods also.  Pay attention to self limiting in her diet and whether she obsesses over certain foods.<br/>
<br/>
Since we have a highly allergic family, and also one acutely allergic child, I have been learning a lot about allergies in the past few years.  It sure sounds to me like this &quot;changed&quot; little girl is profoundly unhappy and suffering in some way.  If allergies prove not to be the problem (which would surprise me) I would look into chemical brain imbalances and whether she needs help to regulate that and allow her to function normally.  She may be depressed.  I was at that age, and I was NOT a pleasant child, let me tell you.<br/>

she is testing?  I would hate to jump up and say &quot;Autism&quot; right away.  Is<br/>

know 7 was nonverbal until almost 4. I went from Dr. to Dr. and told he was just 
slow. I took him to a group of specialists and had a battery of tests run on him 
and was told he was austic. He also was uncontrolable. Screaming fits, 
frustritated very easily. I decided on a whim to go to an ENT DR. I found out he 
could not hear. He had fluid build up behind his ears(not due to ear infections) 
and his adnoide were 80% enlarged. I asked why no one found this sooner. DR. 
said no one ever did a tampanagram (SP?) on him. The funny thing was he could 
pass a regular hearing test.. Tubes went in the ears, adnoids and toncisls came 
out. He cried the first time he heard a plane fly over. He didn&#39;t know what it 
was. If you have ever read the checklist for autisum a large percentage of 
children would fall into the catagory.</font></div>

I don&#39;t know anything about autism, possibly that is the case.  However,<br/>
even in &quot;normal&quot; children, 3 is an age where your loving &quot;Dr. Jekel&quot; can<br/>
turn into &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot;.  The &quot;terrible two&#39;s&quot; have nothing on the &quot;VERY<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84213228">Hi Kandice;<br/>
<br/>
Is there a chance your delicious daughter could be affected by<br/>
vaccinations?  There are many who theorize some of us do react to infant<br/>
vaccinations and your situation could be the result 3-4 years<br/>
later...Perhaps a homeopath could shed some light?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the cause, she will certainly thrive in your tender,<br/>
supportive, sensitive and loving care!<br/>
<br/>
Some behaviorial problems can be tempered with a routine the child can<br/>
count on.  My best friend&#39;s daughter struggled with behaviorial and<br/>
communicative frustrations until almost 5 when SUDDENLY her<br/>
speech/vocabulary improved sufficiently that she could communicate more<br/>
effectively.  My friend also tried limiting refined sugars and white<br/>
flour.  Food sensitivities can be under-diagnosed and explain some of<br/>
what you might be seeing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I know that you&#39;ve gotten a variety of response here, but I would say, <br/>
based on my own experiences with my daughter, your description of your <br/>
daughter definitely sounds as if she might have some sort of developmental <br/>
delay, and she may also be dealing with other issues such as sensory <br/>
integration dysfunction, which is often one of the features of autism.  My <br/>
daughter was adopted from Russia at 22 months and was unable to speak even <br/>
very simple words until about 3.  At 4 she began to use more words, but <br/>
they were still unintelligible to most people outside our family.   She has <br/>
had a lot of speech therapy  (as well as occupational therapy and physical <br/>
therapy), and she now, at 5-1/2, is speaking in 3-4 word sentences, though <br/>
she is still difficult to understand.  She has many emotional and social <br/>
issues that make it a challenge for her to interact with other kids, <br/>
including my two younger kids (2 & 3).  She has many screaming fits, and <br/>
there is often major frustration for her in trying to make us understand <br/>
her needs.  She also unreasonably wants what the other kids have much of <br/>
the time, and she can often be quite aggressive with them.  This is not to <br/>
say that she can&#39;t be a wonderful kid.  She definitely can be and is.  She <br/>
definitely has her own set of challenges, however, challenges that we don&#39;t <br/>
always know how to handle.<br/>
<br/>
What is important to realize, however, is that there are MANY resources <br/>
available for kids with these kinds of challenges.  You can contact your <br/>
local area education agency, and they will provide free evaluations of your <br/>
daughter&#39;s needs.  We have chosen to have Sheridan attend a special needs <br/>
preschool that is located at the local public school, although we are <br/>
homeschooling the younger two kids.  Even if she did not attend this <br/>
school, however, Sheridan would be eligible for speech therapy, <br/>
occupational therapy, and physical therapy (and now, starting this fall, <br/>
music therapy, which we are THRILLED about because she responds incredibly <br/>
well to music) paid for by the local school district.<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] My 4 year old<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My daughter finally began calling us Mommy and Daddy at 3 years or so old<br/>
&gt; &gt;but mixed the names up for quite a while and still sometimes.  She can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;draw a line from the &quot;A&quot; to the &quot;B&quot; or put a circle on the &quot;B&quot; or tell me<br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt; &gt;there are two balls or three.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She can&#39;t really make a sentence yet.  We can&#39;t particularly communicate<br/>
&gt; &gt;with her because she doesn&#39;t understand much of what we say unless we use<br/>
&gt; &gt;the very few words in her vocabulary.<br/>
&gt; &gt;When she talks, we often can figure out what she wants but just as often,<br/>
&gt;we<br/>
&gt; &gt;can&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She spends a lot of her time throwing fits of frustration and being<br/>
&gt;stubborn<br/>
&gt; &gt;about everything and anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt;She was raised as a baby very lovingly by both me and my husband.  She was<br/>
&gt; &gt;very pampered and never left to cry.  We just loved her to death.  But she<br/>
&gt; &gt;started acting this way at about 3 years old and I wonder if she isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;autistic to some degree.  I have heard that this usually occurs at about 3<br/>
&gt; &gt;years.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Since that time, she has gone from being our very sweet loving baby to<br/>
&gt;being<br/>
&gt; &gt;very difficult for anyone in the family to live with.  She spends a lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt;her time screaming at siblings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;If the kids take her outside for a walk, it becomes a big long screaming<br/>
&gt;fit<br/>
&gt; &gt;for Michelle who isn&#39;t happy with anything at all particularly if it<br/>
&gt; &gt;involves the word &quot;no&quot;.  If we try to play with her, she is very likely to<br/>
&gt; &gt;grunt loudly at us defiantly and refuse to co-operate in anything.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I just don&#39;t know what to do with her.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t expect her to be like the gifted son and be a super child in her<br/>
&gt; &gt;abilities, but it would be nice if there was at least reasonable ability to<br/>
&gt; &gt;communicate with her.  I don&#39;t know how to work with her and help her and<br/>
&gt; &gt;there isn&#39;t a way to explain anything to her that she is upset and<br/>
&gt;screaming<br/>
&gt; &gt;about.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I don&#39;t mean to be one of those mothers who labels her kid and has too much<br/>
&gt; &gt;expectation.  I just don&#39;t know if everything is okay with her or not.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt;more time and freedom to do her own thing is all she needs, that would be<br/>
&gt; &gt;great.  She is free to have it here.  I just don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case<br/>
&gt; &gt;and am worried.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Blessings to you,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;If I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no<br/>
&gt;selling, inventory,or huge<br/>
&gt; &gt;start-up cost, would you like to hear about it?   NOT Amway!  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225619853">Kandace, I know very little about autism, but I read an article about it <br/>
yesterday in Good Housekeeping magazine-I don&#39;t know what issue it was, but <br/>
from what I read there are treatments that are effective for autistic <br/>
children now, but early intervention is crucial. If you suspect this is her <br/>
problem, please see your doctor and find out. I am not one who goes to a <br/>
doctor much myself, but in this situation it is pretty important. Waiting <br/>
could mean the difference between your daughter having a normal life or <br/>
being severely disabled if she is indeed autistic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358961780">Kandice,<br/>
<br/>
Your post just drips with your concern over your daughter&#39;s delays.  I feel <br/>
so much empathy toward you.  When I read your first posts, I thought too that <br/>
you need to relax and let nature take it&#39;s course, all children develop at <br/>
their own rate.  This last post, however, jumps out at me.  Now I&#39;m beginning <br/>
to think that you may want to consider taking some action.  Have you had your <br/>
daughter tested by a psychologist or an occupational therapist trained to <br/>
recognize developmental delays?<br/>
<br/>
My son was slow to develop, too, and his preschool teacher suggested that he <br/>
had ADHD.  We had an extensive evaluation done by a child psychologist, and <br/>
she told us that his problem is not ADHD, but sensory integration <br/>
dysfunction.  It is considered an autistic spectrum disorder, but not as <br/>
severe.  In effect, he doesn&#39;t process sensory stimuli the same way &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
people do, and it has resulted in delays in gross and fine motor development. <br/>
 But, intellectually he is not affected.  <br/>
<br/>
After the diagnosis, we had an additional evaluation done by an occupational <br/>
therapist, who confirmed the diagnosis.  He was in occupational therapy for <br/>
about two years, and is still in group therapy with other boys his age to <br/>
develop better social skills.<br/>
<br/>
Many SI children also often have speech delays which benefit from speech <br/>
therapy.  The acting out often comes from frustration over the inability to <br/>
control the body or communicate effectively.  These are all things that can <br/>
be successfully addressed in therapy.  Our insurance company (we&#39;re on an <br/>
HMO) recommended the psychologist (who we learned even later has an excellent <br/>
reputation).  Then our school system recommended the occupational therapy <br/>
agency who did the second evaluation and the therapy.  <br/>
<br/>
One important thing I learned from this process is that the earlier the <br/>
intervention, the better.  OT for these children is designed to help the <br/>
brain reroute signals and reprocess them in the brain.  The brain, however, <br/>
becomes hard-wired about age 10, and it becomes progressively more difficult <br/>
to retrain the sensory areas of the brain after that.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, our son is doing very well.  He&#39;s reached the therapy goals we <br/>
set when he was four.  He&#39;s still uncoordinated, and doesn&#39;t have a lot of <br/>
physical confidence.  But he addresses all of these issues in his own way.  <br/>
He won&#39;t play team sports (his choice), but he takes karate and just started <br/>
taking ice skating lessons (at his own suggestion)!  He looks a bit ungainly <br/>
on the ice, and progress is a bit slow, but he loves it!  <br/>
<br/>
We decided to homeschool because he could not function in a classroom.  It <br/>
was the best decision we ever made.  Now, of course, we homeschool for <br/>
completely different reasons -- because it&#39;s the best thing we can do for our <br/>
children.    <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to talk about this some more, feel free to post or to e-mail me <br/>
off-list.  <br/>
