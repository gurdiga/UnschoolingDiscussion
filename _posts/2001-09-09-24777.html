<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823312132">My daughter is 8. She reads voraciously and fluently (novels now, but she<br/>
did a whole year of Calvin and Hobbes, The Far Side, Archies... but I<br/>
digress). She doesn&#39;t do much writing, although  about 9 months ago or so<br/>
she became more interested and started to occasionally write a poem, or<br/>
write in her journal, or whatever. The problem is that she is<br/>
extraordinarily concerned about correct spellings, and I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
to do, if anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always spelled words that she asked me to spell for her (okay, once<br/>
I tried the &quot;Can you sound it out?&quot; line and she was furious, and<br/>
rightfully so, but I know better now). I&#39;m still happy to do that, or to<br/>
write wheat she dictates, but she wants to do this on her own now. She<br/>
actually spells most words correctly - she&#39;s quite visual and reads a lot<br/>
- but she also spells many incorrectly, and she can see that they look<br/>
wrong and is bothered by it. I think it started when she joined brownies<br/>
last year, and they were doing a project that involved writing, and Cacie<br/>
was cheerily working on it and asking the other girls if they knew how to<br/>
spell this word or that, and one girl said something like, &quot;You don&#39;t<br/>
know how to spell *little*? What grade are you in?&quot; in a really scornful<br/>
tone, and ever since then it&#39;s been a sore spot. I wasn&#39;t there when it<br/>
happened, but she told me later.<br/>
<br/>
So, for example,  Cacie will bring me a poem she&#39;s written and wants me<br/>
to read, and the first thing out of her mouth is always, &quot;It&#39;s all<br/>
spelled wrong but I don&#39;t care.&quot; Clearly, though, she does care. Her<br/>
drama teacher is including some journalling this time, and she worries<br/>
when she has to write  in class, because of her fear that that one of the<br/>
other kids will make fun or her spelling and embarrass her. <br/>
<br/>
This of course doesn&#39;t help my anti-schoolkid bias, but that&#39;s another<br/>
story....<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ve offered to help with spelling, I know there are lists of<br/>
commonly used words and I offered to get them for her... nope. I started<br/>
by stating (and restating) my positions that:<br/>
<br/>
 *If I can tell what she&#39;s saying, I think it&#39;s fine, because the whole<br/>
purpose of writing is to communicate ideas and she&#39;s done that.<br/>
<br/>
*Kids in school spend (waste) a lot of time memorizing the spellings of<br/>
these words, and she&#39;s learned how to spell a ton of words just through<br/>
the stuff she reads, and I&#39;m convinced that she&#39;ll spell well as an adult<br/>
because she is so visual<br/>
<br/>
*It&#39;s mean to be nasty to someone who asks for help or to make fun of<br/>
someone&#39;s work, and I don&#39;t think the kids in her drama class would do<br/>
that, and I sure wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
None of this seems to make any difference. She is a bit of a<br/>
perfectionist anyway, in a lot of things. She just seems so worried about<br/>
it, and I think she enjoys writing now but feels badly about spelling<br/>
when she does it, so she doesn&#39;t do it very often. Right now I&#39;m figuring<br/>
that I should just butt out for a bit, since I&#39;d said my piece and made<br/>
my offers, but it&#39;s hard to watch her struggle...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Daron,<br/>
<br/>
Has she tried putting her stuff on a computer and running the spellcheck?<br/>
 It&#39;s something she could do herself and she might have fun with it.  I,<br/>
personally, do ALL of my creative writing at the computer because I have<br/>
a thesaurus at hand and can switch the words around for effect without<br/>
have to rewrite the whole piece.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought I&#39;d mention it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062659720">My daughter went through a similar thing a few years ago. Her spelling was <br/>
pretty awful even though she is probably our biggest reader. She would <br/>
mispell words often and it caused her to feel embarrassed when it was pointed <br/>
out to her. On the pc it is easy to fix, use that spellcheck. She is now in <br/>
the habit of spellchecking even her instant messages. Then was the problem of <br/>
when she was writing aways from the pc. I did not want her to not join in <br/>
writing activities because of a fear of misspelling a word. She is also the <br/>
only one of my children who enjoys writing. And some of the other classes <br/>
that she takes (karate, 4H, service animal training) require writing. So I <br/>
bought her a little spell checker to carry with her in her pocket. I bought <br/>
it off ebay. And the more she writes the better her spelling becomes. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563583510">I went through this with my now almost 12 year old.From the age of 9 to about <br/>
11 she didn&#39;t write at all because of her spelling (this killed me because <br/>
she wants to be a children&#39;s writer). It all started when a traditionally <br/>
schooled girl made fun of her spelling. She then became obsessed with it. But <br/>
instead of learning to spell, it was like she developed a mental block and <br/>
her spelling became worse. <br/>
She finally got over it when she started talking to other homeschooled kids <br/>
she liked and respected and found that A. they couldn&#39;t spell either or B. <br/>
they really didn&#39;t care how Hailey spelled.<br/>
She is still sef couscious around &#39;school&#39; kids and sometimes turns down <br/>
classes she would othewise take because of this. I have recently bought her a <br/>
Franklin (this is the best for phonetic spellers) spell checker and that has <br/>
helped. She only uses it if she thinks others are going to see her work. She <br/>
is back to writing reams of material again...stories, poems, ect. She is even <br/>
going to edit the kids page of my zine.<br/>
All in all, I think that this is really her issue and all I can do is to let <br/>
her know that I am here if she needs me. Like reading I am fairly confident <br/>
(yes I wake up freaked out every now and then) that, like reading, she will <br/>
learn when the time is right or necessary. My son, on the other hand, has a <br/>
specific learning disability so I have just given him the tools needed to get <br/>
around spelling and to ask for assistance when he needs it.But this is a <br/>
whole other issue.<br/>
I know that I am rambling but I only have a few minutes on the computer.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that sounds like Cacie. I have suggested the computer and<br/>
spellcheck, too, but I think her typing (hunt.... and.... peck) is so<br/>
slow that it&#39;s even more frustrating for her. She&#39;s slowly doing more<br/>
keyboarding, but generally she calls me over and asks me to type for her.<br/>
Maybe in time she&#39;ll want to do more of it on her own, she&#39;s emailing a<br/>
couple of friends now and may eventually want to send a private note..<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does she feel self-conscious using the spell checker at these activities,<br/>
or do the kids have some privacy when they are writing? Maybe I&#39;ll look<br/>
for one. I think at this point it would slow her down a lot, though.<br/>
Like, she&#39;s started writing &quot;whish&quot; for &quot;wish&quot;, because I think she&#39;s<br/>
starting to realize that a lot of words with the /w/ sound actually start<br/>
that way. She&#39;s also writing &quot;wold&quot; for &quot;would&quot;, because she remembers<br/>
that it has a silent &quot;l&quot; in it. It all makes sense, and I think it&#39;s all<br/>
part of the journey, like when she was learning to talk and went from<br/>
saying &quot;feet&quot; to &quot;foots&quot; to &quot;feet&quot; again. I really think she&#39;ll naturally<br/>
get better at it, I just wish I could help in the meantime...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And the more she writes the better her spelling <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Argggh. Yeah, Cacie also wants to be an author. She&#39;ll burst in with her<br/>
great idea for a mystery novel, or a science fiction novel, and tell me<br/>
how it will go in great detail, and sometimes even get a few lines on<br/>
paper... but then she gets frustrated and stops. Which is maybe okay for<br/>
now, I guess. I love her stories, I have said that she could write them<br/>
down and be a great author, but I&#39;ve also said she could be a great<br/>
storyteller like Jim Weiss or Homer, too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they really didn&#39;t care how Hailey spelled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most of Cacie&#39;s friends are homeschooled, and she spells as well as most<br/>
of them or better, and they don&#39;t seem to care, anyway... and she is much<br/>
more relaxed about it with them, like when they make signs for things in<br/>
their games. I guess she&#39;s started these activities with schooled kids<br/>
again and that&#39;s what has brought it up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She is even <br/>
&gt; going to edit the kids page of my zine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooo, that&#39;s cool! I can&#39;t wait to see it - can Cacie contribute too,<br/>
then? <br/>
<br/>

&gt; she will <br/>
&gt; learn when the time is right or necessary. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right. I tend to take over her issues sometimes, or want to. I<br/>
guess I start to feel guilty, like I did something wrong. D&#39;you know,<br/>
when Cacie was born I had this idea that if I was a &quot;perfect&quot; mother and<br/>
didn&#39;t make any mistakes, she&#39;d be a &quot;perfect&quot; child and never be rude,<br/>
or yell, or hit, or touch things that&#39;s I&#39;d explained were dangerous.<br/>
Yup. Right. I was an awfully young, naive mom, good thing Cacie set me<br/>
straight right off.<br/>
<br/>
I have to confess, though, that I&#39;ve sort of criticized other people&#39;s<br/>
spelling whejn they post stuff on public forums that is really messed up.<br/>
I know Cacie has heard me doing this, and I wonder if that&#39;s why she<br/>
thinks it&#39;s important. I honestly do have a hard time reading posts from<br/>
people who hope they won&#39;t be &quot;lamb basted&quot; for their &quot;rediculous&quot; ideas<br/>
and taking them seriously, the spelling just gets to me. Maybe I&#39;m<br/>
fooling myself when I say I don&#39;t care about her spelling, bu I think I<br/>
see a difference between the efforts of someone just learning a skill and<br/>
someone who who supposedly has mastered it. Maybe I&#39;m a snob, but I would<br/>
display artwork by a 4 yr old that I would pass over if the artist had 25<br/>
years of experience in the same media...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know I talked to you privately about my brother, but I think some of my<br/>
stress with Cacie must relate to growing up with John, who was also<br/>
labeled with severe dyslexia at 7 and struggled with reading and writing<br/>
until he was 25 or so, when it all just clicked... but I have vivid<br/>
childhood memories of screaming, physical fights between him and my<br/>
parenst every noight for years while they tried to &quot;help&quot; him do his<br/>
homework, and I also stepped in as the big sister and &quot;helped&quot; him many<br/>
nights by doing it for him and trying to make my handwriting look<br/>
:&quot;messy&quot; enough... that all sucked.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770772544">If she&#39;s reading a lot and enjoys writing, the spelling will follow. I<br/>
have worked directly with doctors most of my adult life, and most of them<br/>
can&#39;t write legibly or spell correctly.  Yet they are very intelligent,<br/>
interesting people to be around.  I think if she is interested in<br/>
spelling maybe she could get one of those little pocket notebooks that<br/>
have commonly used words in it.  I don&#39;t know what they are called, but I<br/>
had to get one when I went to business school so I would not misspell in<br/>
business letters.  I think college bookstores sell them.<br/>
