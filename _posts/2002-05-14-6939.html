<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937538284">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
 I am asking if you have any quotes by your kids that you would like to share <br/>
with me.  In my homeschooling book I&#39;m scattering the sayings throughout. <br/>
 You can send them to me privately by:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:conniecolten@...">conniecolten@...</a><br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hsreflections@...">hsreflections@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Connie<br/>
