Being in Awe Can Expand Time and Enhance Well-Being<br/>
<br/>
Tags: Decision Making, Emotions, Psychological Science, Time  <br/>
Perception, Well-Being<br/>
<br/>
It doesn’t matter what we’ve experienced – whether it’s the  <br/>
breathtaking scope of the Grand Canyon, the ethereal beauty of the  <br/>
Aurora Borealis, or the exhilarating view from the top of the Eiffel  <br/>
Tower – at some point in our lives we’ve all had the feeling of being  <br/>
in a complete and overwhelming sense of awe.<br/>
<br/>
Awe seems to be a universal emotion, but it has been largely neglected  <br/>
by scientists—until now.<br/>
<br/>
Psychological scientists Melanie Rudd and Jennifer Aaker of Stanford  <br/>
University Graduate School of Business and Kathleen Vohs of the  <br/>
University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management devised a way to  <br/>
study this feeling of awe in the laboratory. Across three different  <br/>
experiments, they found that jaw-dropping moments made participants  <br/>
feel like they had more time available and made them more patient,  <br/>
less materialistic, and more willing to volunteer time to help others.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers found that the effects that awe has on decision-making  <br/>
and well-being can be explained by awe’s ability to actually change  <br/>
our subjective experience of time by slowing it down. Experiences of  <br/>
awe help to brings us into the present moment which, in turn, adjusts  <br/>
our perception of time, influences our decisions, and makes life feel  <br/>
more satisfying than it would otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Now that’s awesome.<br/>
<br/>
The study, “Awe Expands People’s Perception of Time, Alters Decision  <br/>
Making, and Enhances Well-Being,” will be published in Psychological  <br/>
Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.</div>

<br/>
I have said “stupid.”   Sometimes to be funny and sometimes because I find a belief so senseless and tiresome I want to express my dislike forcefully. <br/>
<br/>
At work once, when a train shut us down for a bit I said, “Trains are stupid,” but I was trying to be funny in expressing impatience to get working again. I don’t really think trains are stupid. I don’t find objects or locations stupid.  I’m too easily entertained or fascinated by things to find them stupid.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel awe often but not as often as some people, I think.  I hear people talking about some awesome juice or some awesome shirt or some awesome sandwich or their awesome selves.  I have very much enjoyed juice and shirts and sandwiches in my lifetime but seldom find those things awe inspiring.  I think I have reasonable self awareness and have never found myself awesome.  <br/>
<br/>
But deer in my yard in the mornings?  Yes.  Even though I see them almost every day where I live, they still take my breath away.  A bird, any bird, yes. A snowy mountain range, a misty river, the night sky, yes.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, &quot;awesome&quot; can be kind of aweful.<br/>
<br/>
People online are forever writing that someone is &quot;an awesome mom&quot; even though they&#39;ve never met her and her kids might be crying and sad.  <br/>

Every time I took a photo of a bird in Europe this summer, I thought of you.<br/>
I didn&#39;t send you any photos, but keep meaning to. :-)  I have papers with the names of some of the birds written down, but haven&#39;t gone through all my notes. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I saw starlings making patterns in the sky outside a third-story window in Leiden, in The Netherlands.<br/>

<br/>
I have felt this way, too! Birds, fallen leaves, streets lined with trees,<br/>
rain drops clinging precariously to leaves and grass blades, vibrant blue<br/>
skies, sea shells and drift wood washed ashore.....nature has that effect<br/>
on me.<br/>
And art - any type. Even those leaf crayon rubbings or leaves dipped in<br/>
paint - vein-side down and stamped. Or the baking soda + vinegar reactions<br/>
- no matter how many times we&#39;ve done and seen those! ha!<br/>
<br/>
Today evening I was watching the under-water world on Animal Plant and the<br/>
colours took my breath away..<br/>
<br/>
I was born in a small town in East of India. When I first came to Delhi for<br/>
higher studies, I used to feel irritated hearing &quot;awesome&quot; thrown in more<br/>
than once in every sentence! I suppose it was just a &#39;cool&#39; word to use by<br/>
the uber-cool crowd? For I found nothing awesome about the subject being<br/>
described!<br/>
<br/>
Sense of awe, I&#39;ve seen, has the power to make you feel calm, motivated and<br/>
optimistic...it can cure a bad headache....<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest gift I give to my daughter in our unschooling life is<br/>
my own sense of wonder and curiosity for seemingly mundane things. I wrote<br/>
about this experience here:<br/>

I am prone to getting a physical sensation of awe from hearing music sometimes--a good sort of perking up and then release (yeah, I know�) that comes in the form of a wave down my nervous system.  A time or three a year, something� some beautiful music, usually live music, some chord, some melodic progression will affect me physically and I let it wash through me and my whole nervous system tingles.  It&#39;s not repeatable or predictable, but I sure do like it.  I can&#39;t imagine a headache surviving one of those moments.<br/>

A couple of days before a migraine I get a sensation that has been described by other migraine getters as euphoria.  It doesn’t feel like euphoria to me it feels like awe.  Colors seem prettier, food tastes better, flowers are more fragrant, snow is more sparkly, and I find everything sort of magical, and wonderful.  Everything is beautiful or funny or sweet.  Sometimes it can feel more like a delighted mania, but usually it’s that physical, bubbling up feeling of awe. <br/>
<br/>
David was the first to notice that this happens to me before a migraine.  I’ve had migraines since I was eleven-ish and I hadn’t made the connection. <br/>
<br/>
But as to curing a headache, my first attempt at remedy for an ordinary headache is often a walk, out of town, where I’m more likely to see and think something new. I’m lucky to live where “out of town” is three blocks away. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was younger we would often go find something new and interesting to look at if he was restless or out of sorts.  We didn’t always need to be awe struck to be moved to a better, happier mood. But if we did find something awe inspiring it didn’t hurt at all!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We still do this even though Senna is 17 &lt;g&gt;. Our favorite thing to do  <br/>
is go for a drive. Senna listens to her music with her headphones on,  <br/>
but is very attentive to what we are passing by. We&#39;ve discovered deer  <br/>
and eagles and elk, funny signs, cool houses and barns, the rising or  <br/>
falling of the rivers, herds of horses where there were none the day  <br/>
before, cloud formations, amazing sunsets.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there aren&#39;t awe-inspiring things to see, but the it&#39;s awe- <br/>
inspiring to me that a quick (or long) drive can take us to a  <br/>
completely different state of mind.<br/>
