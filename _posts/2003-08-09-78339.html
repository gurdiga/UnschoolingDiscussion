<div id="ygrps-yiv-469527559">Rosie who is 12 and Roxana who is 15 and I were driving along in the <br/>
car having a sweet and innocent discussion about what I should talk <br/>
about at the conference - they were giving me advice. I&#39;m talking about <br/>
math - so that was the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie suddenly interrupts and says, &quot;You know what I&#39;m going to tell <br/>
people I want for my birthday?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Math workbooks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I tell all my friends I&#39;ll probably get about 20 of them!!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Silence while I absorb this and try to figure out what to say next &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana steps in and says, &quot;What kind of math workbooks?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;Mostly division.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Roxana: &quot;Why workbooks?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;Because they&#39;re fun and Mommy gets tired of me asking her to <br/>
give me problems to do all the time, but she doesn&#39;t like to spend our <br/>
money on workbooks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Roxana: &quot;But for birthday presents?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Rosie: &quot;That&#39;s what I want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
By this time I&#39;m trying not to laugh - the ludicrousness of this <br/>
conversation - right in the middle of them helping me with ideas for my <br/>
talk about &quot;UNSCHOOLING math&quot; -- is just cracking me up.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can probably get her pages of practice problems off the <br/>
internet somewhere - that&#39;s really all she wants, an unlimited supply <br/>
of opportunities to do division over and over - kids often like to do <br/>
that kind of thing - kind of obsessively practice something. I remember <br/>
writing my own name over and over and over - filling a notebook with <br/>
it. And hitting a ball against the garage door with a tennis racket, <br/>
over and over and over.<br/>

<br/>
Me too!  If they had made us do that at school, we wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do <br/>
it for fun.  And surely we wouldn&#39;t have wanted our birthday parties to have <br/>
any MENTION of it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I practiced my  name<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Adams<br/>
Sandra Lynn Adams<br/>
<br/>
and as I got older I practiced my potential married names.   I still find <br/>
those, in notebooks here and there, because I still have some folkmusic words <br/>
things, and mostly  music things, and some diaries, with my practice names.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Chacon<br/>
Sandra Garcia<br/>
Sandra Tsosie  (hard to pronounce)<br/>
<br/>
by college I was too cool to practice &quot;Sandra Singh&quot; and it&#39;s not a good <br/>
pronouncing name, either.<br/>
<br/>
Ended up Sandra Gill for a while<br/>
and Sandra Dodd for a LONG time.<br/>
<br/>
I used to practice writing numbers, too, though, in patterns.  It was partly <br/>
a speed race with myself to put numbers in columns and have the columns line <br/>
up really well.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, when I reconcile my &quot;envelope&quot; (I do $200 worth of debit card at a <br/>
time, and keep the date/place/amount on the outside of a little coin envelope <br/>
that holds the card), I&#39;d rather do it by hand than calculator, and instead of <br/>
doing it carefully, I do it lightning fast, two numbers at a time (like a <br/>
calcator does) adding one item/amount to the running sum each time.  And then I <br/>
do it again, with the numbers in a different order, and if the two totals <br/>
match, that&#39;s it.  If they don&#39;t, I go for two out of three.<br/>
<br/>
So even though I did have school I can still amuse myself with math by hand.<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes math workbooks that have pages with time or money or pie charts.<br/>
