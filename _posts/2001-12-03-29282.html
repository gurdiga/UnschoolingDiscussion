<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062664520">Last week we hosted a party for unschooling resource center that we belong <br/>
to. I had an opportunity to visit with a man whose children spend time there <br/>
along with my children.  As we were visiting, I made a comment about <br/>
&quot;manifesting&quot; which led us into a discussion about personal philosophies and <br/>
how they affected our children. He has a son who had been diagnosed with all <br/>
kinds of disabilities. . . I would guess the &quot;worst&quot; of those being autism. <br/>
He was pretty much non communicative, they could not reach him at all, and <br/>
the &quot;experts&quot; had recommended things they just were not going to do with him. <br/>
This man&#39;s philosiphies about life in general very closely mirror my own. . . <br/>
it was interesting to listen to someone who faced these types of challenges <br/>
stand in that truth and find solutions for his son that allowed for his <br/>
beliefs to be the forefront of any remedy that they tried. They found a place <br/>
that has been doing some exceptional work with children like this, with the <br/>
underlying belief that we are the creators of our existence and <br/>
circumstances. It is intense work that goes on for an extended period of <br/>
time, getting into their world so to speak.  I am excited to learn of the <br/>
work being done in this area. For those who choose a different way of <br/>
exploring who they are and who they can be by creating their reality, it is <br/>
exciting to find others having such great success in this. This father spoke <br/>
of the radical tranformation not only in his own son and family, but in the <br/>
lives of hundreds of others he attended with. He is rejoicing not in the fact <br/>
that his son can now do things the other kids are doing, but in the joy in <br/>
his face now, and his ability to manipulate his own world and enlist the help <br/>
of others when he chooses it. . . it was a remarkable story of truth and the <br/>
courage to not let labels or experts define who we are. <br/>

Remember that every act is an act of self-definition.  Every thought<br/>
carries the energy of creation.  Every word is a declaration of what is true<br/>
for you. Look to see what you are doing today.  Is this how you choose to <br/>
define yourself? Look to see what you are thinking today.  Is this what you <br/>
wish to create? Look to see what you are saying today.  Is this what you <br/>
desire to be so? Each moment of your life is a holy moment, a moment of <br/>
creation<br/>

Another interesting book is Rachel Pinneys Bobby: Breakthrough Of An<br/>
Autistic Child. I volunteered for her organization, Childrens Hours Trust,<br/>
years ago in and around London. (Since then she has died, and the group was<br/>
no longer actually working with kids when I last heard of them.)<br/>
