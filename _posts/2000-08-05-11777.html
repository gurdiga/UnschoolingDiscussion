<div id="ygrps-yiv-281612539">to unschool your children, and do you assign work each day or let the <br/>
child decide when and how much?<br/>
<br/>
I am asking because in my previous post re: my 9yo ds (who is not <br/>
motivated to do one math and one language lesson a day), someone <br/>
pointed out that some unschoolers *do* use texts.  <br/>
<br/>
Just wondering how many of you do and in what capacity......<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much and God bless you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107244285">About texts-I&#39;ve some suspicion to their accuracy and bias; however, I&#39;ve<br/>
purchased many texts from charity thrift stores-ones that were obviously<br/>
bought by institutional school families and never even opened-just like<br/>
new-lol!  And I&#39;ve accepted gifts of texts from my teacher family members<br/>
who saved the books from the garbage dumpster.  We haven&#39;t had any<br/>
opportunity to use them yet.  In fact, I haven&#39;t even shown them to ds yet,<br/>
but I plan to-only to let him know they exist.  I don&#39;t see these texts as<br/>
an end all, but as a jumping off point.  Leave the book out, maybe ds will<br/>
browse through it.  Maybe he&#39;ll see something of interest and ask me about.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll want to learn more, and look for more info on it in other books.<br/>
<br/>
I also use the texts to give me ideas-to remind me what sorts of subjects<br/>
may (I said may-as is in &quot;maybe&quot;!) be appropriate for ds&#39;s current learning<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
And, lastly, I&#39;m a book fiend. If it&#39;s got binding, and pages (doesn&#39;t even<br/>
have to have a cover! ;-) then I&#39;m going to gape at it. I LOVE books, even<br/>
poorly written ones.  (In that case, I LOVE complaining about how poorly<br/>
written they are! This morning we were shifting books in our bookshelves to<br/>
make space and dh said to me about an author-I forget which one- &quot;Sheesh,<br/>
you sure keep a lot of this author&#39;s books around for hating her writing so<br/>
much.&quot; lol!)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and lastly for real-I always keep in mind that *I&#39;m* the one with the<br/>
book addiction, not ds (although he&#39;s picking up on my affliction). I don&#39;t<br/>
really buy texts for him.  He&#39;s just my excuse. :-) I hope he&#39;ll take an<br/>
interest in them, just as I&#39;d hope he&#39;d take an interest in anything I enjoy<br/>
doing, but I don&#39;t force him. (Not that I haven&#39;t tried in the past.  Boy<br/>
did I learn my lesson! And ds was the teacher.)<br/>

Llewellyn reported a story of some boy who&#39;d hovered around the arithmetic<br/>
level until he was 15, and then suddenly dove into math and worked his way<br/>
nearly to calculus in a few months.  Coercion can be very demotivating for<br/>
some people.<br/>
