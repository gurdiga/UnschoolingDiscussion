My kids are all extremely emotional - very dramatic, lots and lots of <br/>
joy and sadness and anger around here!!! It can be exhausting. And <br/>
overwhelming for other people to be around us &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

about your oldest. I&#39;ve seen many similarities to Casey in there. That means <br/>
your daughter(s) MUST be fabulous! :o)<br/>
