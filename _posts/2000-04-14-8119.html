&lt;&lt; I also explained that learning is like breathing...<br/>
you are always learning every moment.  We had this conversation a few<br/>
times... Once it went no-where.  The next times the boys really cought on to<br/>
the idea... saying that in that moment they had just learned that they were<br/>
always learning , and then going on giving me a play by play announcement of<br/>
all the things they were learning as they sat there talking to me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
this is great.  i do think the feedback helps them be aware and grow in <br/>
confidence in their competency.  and then, hopefully too it will help them <br/>
see in themselves areas that they want to improve, and they will not worry <br/>
about it, but ask for support in surmounting whatever that may be!  yea!<br/>
