&lt;&lt; Then - there was this startling moment when one person said, &quot;But it is so <br/>
expensive to buy video games - how can you let them have unlimited video <br/>
games without going broke? We could never afford that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Silence.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes people have had that same sort of reaction when I say I&#39;ll let my <br/>
kids have whatever they want from the grocery store.  I&#39;ve gotten kinda <br/>
snooty, &quot;Well YOU might be a millionaire, but WE live on a budget.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say I would buy the entire grocery story and bring it home for them <br/>
to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
But if I&#39;m going to the store and ask &quot;Is there anything you want?&quot; I really <br/>
mean it.  And the answer is more than likely &quot;No.&quot;  But if the answer is <br/>
&quot;ham&quot; and the best ham I see is expensive, I&#39;ll buy it anyway.  And if the <br/>
answer is &quot;an Almond Joy&quot; those are 69 cents AT MOST and usually 50 cents at <br/>
the grocery store, but I MIGHT even spring for a pack of six or eight.  And <br/>
none of that will break my financial life.  <br/>

Kids have never asked me for anything that cost more than $3.50 so the snarky <br/>
accusations seem to come from nowhere.  But Pam has pretty much nailed it in <br/>
seeing that people see &quot;I don&#39;t limit&quot; as &quot;I provide the world in an <br/>
instant.&quot;  <br/>

I get requests fairly often for the chocolate orange in a box.  Here in<br/>
the big city they cost about $4.  I can&#39;t face paying that much for a<br/>
fairly small amount of chocolate.  (Especially now, when we have no<br/>
income.)  A roll of Pillsbury cookie dough also costs more than $3.50 here.<br/>

PS  We buy chocolate oranges just after Xmas when they are available at<br/>
half price.</div>

 </span></blockquote>But you could bake the cookies from scratch for less than $3.50. And some <br/>
ingredients like flour, sugar and butter will have left overs to be used for <br/>
another purpose. Besides homemade tastes wayyyy better than any old roll of <br/>
pre-made dough!<br/>
