<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389579895">I don&#39;t know if this is true or not, but thought it pretty interesting if it <br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
In amongst the roots of a specific species of Pine Tree which grows<br/>
above the Arctic Circle grows the hallucinogenic mushroom -<br/>
Amanita muscaria (fly agaric).<br/>
<br/>
This mushroom comes in two variations - bright red with gold speckles<br/>
and bright green with gold speckles and was used by the Shamans<br/>
of Siberia and Lapland for their &quot;outer worldly&quot; travels.<br/>
<br/>
It only makes its appearance on the longest night of the year and the<br/>
Shaman went out by the glow of the Northern Lights to harvest it,<br/>
returning with his full sack to his home.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the snow drifts, the Shaman entered his house through<br/>
a door which was nothing more than a hole in the roof -<br/>
and strung the mushrooms out to dry in front of the fire.<br/>
<br/>
When they were dry (about 12 hours later) the Shaman used to go out<br/>
and distribute them as gifts to his followers - as part of a celebration.<br/>
Usually, the reindeer who pulled his sled was rewarded with a handful of<br/>
mushrooms too ...<br/>
<br/>
One of the side effects of this mushroom is that it produces a reddening<br/>
of the nose - both of the shaman - and the reindeer.<br/>
<br/>
So - on Christmas Eve .. you now know why Santa comes down the<br/>
chimney - and Rudolph has a red nose .. and why the gifts are<br/>
traditionally placed under the pine tree in bright red and green<br/>
wrapping - tied with gold string ..<br/>
<br/>
