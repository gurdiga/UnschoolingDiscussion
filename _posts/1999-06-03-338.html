<div id="ygrps-yiv-673555272">Just browsing around the net and ran into this news story about a hacker<br/>
group called The Posse.  Today, they replaced a goverment page<br/>
(www.govnews.org) with the following. Story is at:<br/>

A mirror of the hacked page can be found here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Brief History Lesson<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>                               The Posse collective would like to remind<br/>
both law enforcement and skript <br/>
  kiddies alike that it is unwise to overlook the lessons of history and to<br/>
forget one&#39;s roots. In keeping with this, The Posse would like to pass onto<br/>
the new<br/>
                                 school a few words that were given to us<br/>
when we were first starting out.<br/>
                                                   So without further ado: <br/>
                                            The Creed Of The Elite<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another one got caught today, it&#39;s all over the papers. <br/>
&quot;Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, &quot;Hacker Arrested after Bank<br/>
Tampering&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Damn kids. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>
<br/>
But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950&#39;s technobrain, ever<br/>
take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him<br/>
tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?<br/>
<br/>
I am a hacker, enter my world...<br/>
<br/>
Mine is a world that begins with school... I&#39;m smarter than most of the<br/>
other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br/>
<br/>
Damn underachiever. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in junior high or high school. I&#39;ve listened to teachers explain for the<br/>
fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. &quot;No, Ms. Smith, I<br/>
didn&#39;t show my work. I did it in my head...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Damn kid. Probably copied it. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>
<br/>
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool.<br/>
It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it&#39;s because I screwed it<br/>
up. Not<br/>
because it doesn&#39;t like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I&#39;m a<br/>
smart ass... Or doesn&#39;t like teaching and shouldn&#39;t be here...<br/>
<br/>
Damn kid. All he does is play games. They&#39;re all alike.<br/>
<br/>
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the<br/>
phone line like heroin through an addict&#39;s veins, an electronic pulse is<br/>
sent out, a<br/>
refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know everyone here... even if I&#39;ve never met them, never talked to them,<br/>
may never hear from them again... I know you all...<br/>
<br/>
Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They&#39;re all alike...<br/>
<br/>
You bet your ass we&#39;re all alike... we&#39;ve been spoon-fed baby food at school<br/>
when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through<br/>
were<br/>
pre-chewed and tasteless. We&#39;ve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the<br/>
apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but<br/>
those few are like drops of water in the desert.<br/>
<br/>
This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the<br/>
beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying<br/>
for<br/>
what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&#39;t run by profiteering gluttons, and you<br/>
call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after<br/>
knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without<br/>
nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build<br/>
atomic<br/>
bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us<br/>
believe it&#39;s for our own good, yet we&#39;re the criminals.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of<br/>
judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime<br/>
is that<br/>
of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.<br/>
<br/>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but<br/>
you can&#39;t stop us all... after all, we&#39;re all alike.<br/>
