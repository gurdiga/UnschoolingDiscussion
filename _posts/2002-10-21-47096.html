&gt; oncoming migraine my son lovingly patted me on the hand and said,  &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sorry mom... but the lights are better than the voices.&quot;<br/>
&gt; He really thinks he&#39;s funny!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, Deb --<br/>
<br/>
He IS funny!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Sorry about the migraine, tho.  Ugh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, he really is.  He&#39;s so much like his dad it&#39;s amazing.  I met his<br/>
dad when I was about Dylan&#39;s age and David was 13.   It&#39;s fun to see. <br/>
They have the quickest, sharp humor.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s just gone outside to play, bundled up because it&#39;s chilly here and<br/>
he took a bag with him to pick up apples.  (He wants to put all the<br/>
apples in a pile for the deer when they come)   He came and kissed me and<br/>
said good bye mom,  I&#39;ll write when I get work. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He has me grinning all day.<br/>
