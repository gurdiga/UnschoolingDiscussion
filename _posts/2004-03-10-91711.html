<div id="ygrps-yiv-593827146">I have made books using the computer to walk the children through a move.  I<br/>
made one each and started with their current house and friends/Sunday school<br/>
class/any other group then used pictures of moving vans then airplanes/or<br/>
cars, photos/drawings of packing and unpacking, then things they could look<br/>
forward to seeing when they got there.  In our case we were moving from<br/>
California to New Jersey and so snow was the thing I made a big deal out of.<br/>
{I realized later that I was really lucky that we got a lot of snow the<br/>
first year.}  We read it like a story book and they were able to share it<br/>
with friends.  It seemed to work well.  When packing I have read that it<br/>
helps children if they know that their favorite things are not going to<br/>
disappear so you might want to have them pack their special things - to<br/>
carry or put in a special place in the truck with a big label so everyone<br/>
will take extra care of it.  I think it is a great idea to not have the<br/>
children around when packing.  If it isn&#39;t harder on them it is harder on<br/>
everyone else.  My children don&#39;t like change but have surprised me by<br/>
handling major moves without a problem.  My children have also got excited<br/>
about moves if they can visit the new house prior to moving and they can<br/>
discuss which room will be there&#39;s.  As you are in the military this might<br/>
not be possible - perhaps photos or perhaps just when you arrive they can do<br/>
that.<br/>

  ===========================================<br/>
It helped us to allow the children to each pack a special box (small one) that we kept with us--but we were driving and could do that. That way they knew that their special things would not get lost.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t take a box with you, it might help to let them pack at least one of their boxes so all their special stuff is in one place. We let the kids decorate their boxes with markers. It let them participate in the process and easily spot their special stuff as it came off the van. That worked well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you&#39;ve moved before, you probably know this, but make sure you have one box with cups, plates, utensils, etc. basic stuff that you can pull out right away and be able to pull a meal together. I had my basic spices, favorite pan, things like that. Take out only goes so far for so many days, you know? At some point you&#39;re probably going to want to scramble a quick egg or make a grilled cheese or something of the sort, and it&#39;s much easier to do from one box than to have to unpack several kitchen boxes to get the different things you need.  We had professional packers both times we moved cross-country, so I made sure to pack this box myself. They just wrote on it &quot;packed by owner&quot; so they wouldn&#39;t be liable for any breakage.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832588386">I have already been planning on an album for Sarah...I hadn&#39;t thought about extending that into one for The Littles, but that might be good..even one for Gracie for when she is older...maybe I should take one of the hospital she was born in? Hmmmm this could be a fun project!<br/>
