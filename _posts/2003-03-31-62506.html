<div id="ygrps-yiv-444259800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I really agree with this. I understand that I am new to this group but I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have spent several months researching unschooling, homeschooling, I am an <br/>
educator, a mother to three kids including a ten year old and I am a social <br/>
worker. I remember one time taking my ten year old (who was 6 at the time) to <br/>
see a rated pg13 movie becuase she &quot;really&quot; wanted to see it. I thought and <br/>
thought about it and decided I should go with her and let her decide. It was <br/>
a huge mistake, she told me it was too scary for her and we left. Then for <br/>
months and even years later she said, &quot;Mommy why would you let me see a movie <br/>
like that, I was not ready for that movie.&quot; She was right, she really was not <br/>
ready for that movie and it was my responsibility and my job as her mother to <br/>
make sure that she was developmentally ready for certain material. I feel <br/>
like I really liek this group of women because you are all independent <br/>
thinkers and that is great, I am too. However, I argue that as an independent <br/>
thinker and parent I tend to question what society&#39;s motivations are in media <br/>
and in the corporate world.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you comfortable with her being a 22 year old blaming YOU because she went <br/>
to see a scary or stupid film? If you die tomorrow, whose approval would she <br/>
seek to watch some movie next month? It&#39;s about taking responsibility for our <br/>
choices. Who told YOU what you can and can&#39;t watch? And who tells you NOW?<br/>
<br/>
If one of my boys were uncomfortable with scary or violent movies, and we had <br/>
discussed it, and he had asked me to help him decide whether a movie would be <br/>
appropriate, we would discuss the movie and I&#39;d let him make an informed <br/>
decision. If I said no because I thought it was too scary or violent, and he <br/>
found out later that it was lame OR if I said yes, and he went and was scared <br/>
and blamed ME------Both are examples of MY decisions and both are wrong---and <br/>
he may not trust my opinions of movies again. <br/>
<br/>
If we checked them out and I let him decide---yes, he *could* be frightened <br/>
and upset for a while (or forever), but then he would KNOW what he thinks he <br/>
can or cannot watch. And he could alter that as he got older.<br/>
<br/>
When Cameron was eight or ten or so, he wanted to watch Braveheart. I knew of <br/>
the torture scene at the end (not to mention the battle scenes)---and I <br/>
thought he might be frightened. We rented it, and I asked him to leave for <br/>
the torture scene. Ben and I watched it and realized it was IMPLIED torture, <br/>
but not graphic. We rewound it, told him what to expect, and asked whether he <br/>
thought he could handle it. He thought so, so we did. He was fine. <br/>
<br/>
By making all our children&#39;s difficult decisions FOR them (or even *some* of <br/>
the *important* decisions), they can quickly become incapable of making <br/>
INFORMED decisions themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I may certainly voice my opinion, but because I&#39;ve never FORCED my opinion on <br/>
them, my children are happy to listen to me (most of the time! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see your point and I also understand what your daughter was saying. <br/>
But there are other ways to achieve those goals other than outright <br/>
saying &quot;You can&#39;t see this movie,  you&#39;re not ready for it.&quot; For <br/>
instance, both of my kids (3 and 6) adored the first Lord of the <br/>
Rings movie, which they watched on DVD. The first time they watched <br/>
it, they asked me to fast-forward past parts they thought were too <br/>
scary. After a few times of doing this, and after watching all the <br/>
documentaries that showed how the scary orcs were created, they were <br/>
fine with watching the whole thing. Now they both want to see the Two <br/>
Towers, and my oldest wanted to see it in the theatre. I told him I <br/>
would go and check it out and tell him what I thought. After seeing <br/>
it, I told him that I thought it wasn&#39;t as scary as the first one (it <br/>
didn&#39;t have as many &quot;gotcha&quot; scenes), but that I thought with the <br/>
sound and large screen, he might feel very overwhelmed seeing it in a <br/>
theatre and might find it too scary. He thought about it for awhile <br/>
and decided to wait to see it on DVD. I think part of the reason that <br/>
he felt comfortable making that decision is that he trusts me to give <br/>
him accurate information based on his responses to previous movies. <br/>
He knows that I&#39;m not saying &quot;You can&#39;t watch this because it&#39;s too <br/>
freaky&quot; but that I&#39;m trying to give him the most accurate picture <br/>
possible of what he can expect. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really any different than what I&#39;d do for my husband. He has <br/>
a hard time with a lot of suspense/horror movies. I watched &quot;The <br/>
Sixth Sense&quot; first, and told him what he could expect and that I <br/>
thought he&#39;d really like it but it had a few &quot;gotcha&quot; parts and I&#39;d <br/>
tell him when they are coming up. OTOH, he will never, ever want to <br/>
see &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; and has told me to go ahead and see it on <br/>
my own. Being freaked out by certain kinds of movies is not limited <br/>
to children. Helping give good factual information, whether to my <br/>
husband or to my kids, is respecting them *and* helping them decide <br/>
whether they can handle any particular movie. <br/>
<br/>
The hardest time I have is when my kids want to see something that I <br/>
totally have no interest in seeing. If they rent it on DVD, that&#39;s <br/>
one thing, but if I have to sit through it in a theatre, that&#39;s <br/>
another. Making it through the Veggie Tales Jonah movie was a real <br/>
trial! DH fell asleep, but I thought at least one of us should stay <br/>
awake and make sure our 3 y.o. didn&#39;t wander out of the theatre. At <br/>
least with movies my DH likes that I don&#39;t (Happy Gilmore comes to <br/>
mind), I don&#39;t have to be there with him!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do too, and I also discuss those with my kids. They know what ads <br/>
and previews are and also why they&#39;re put there. They&#39;ve heard me use <br/>
the term &#39;gratuitous violence&#39; and seem to understand that sometimes <br/>
violence in a movie is part of the plot line, and sometimes it&#39;s just <br/>
thrown in to have a fight scene. They know why toys are created from <br/>
movies, but sometimes still decide to buy them. I do believe in <br/>
giving them lots of information. I think one of the great things <br/>
about unschooling is that we are present in our children&#39;s lives and <br/>
thus have the opportunity to give them a lot of context for the <br/>
things that they see and hear. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961802621">To my previous post I&#39;d add that being in touch with what bothers our <br/>
children helps us to help them make good decisions about what to <br/>
watch. For instance, my son might not have any problem watching a <br/>
movie with a lot of blood and battle scenes like &#39;Gettysburg&#39;, but he <br/>
would be totally freaked out by the scene in &#39;The Bear&#39; where the <br/>
baby bear&#39;s mother is killed by a falling rock, or the cruelty that <br/>
the men show toward the baby bear, keeping him tied up and taunting <br/>
him. My son gets very upset about animals being hurt. Sometimes I&#39;m <br/>
really surprised by what will bother him in a movie. Both of my kids <br/>
found the movie &quot;ET&quot; very disturbing because of the way the children <br/>
treated each other and the fact that the adults were very detached <br/>
from their kids and left them alone. They were really upset when the <br/>
mother left the little girl alone in the house. They were also very <br/>
upset by the little robot being blown off of the spaceship in the <br/>
movie Silent Running. It either didn&#39;t register or didn&#39;t bother them <br/>
that one adult human murders a couple of others in the same movie, <br/>
but they cried about that robot for a week and found it very <br/>
disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
So ratings aren&#39;t as helpful as really knowing what kinds of things <br/>
might scare or bother them, and talking with them frankly about what <br/>
is in a particular movie and what might be problematic for them. In <br/>
the examples above, the things that bothered them were not things <br/>
that could be predicted by movie ratings or level of violence or <br/>
graphic language or any other arbitrary indicator. It&#39;s things within <br/>
their own personality and experience that make some movies fine and <br/>
others disturbing. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll see &quot;Spiderman&quot; before they&#39;d <br/>
ever want to watch &quot;Dumbo&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079361011">&lt;&lt;  She was right, she really was not <br/>
ready for that movie and it was my responsibility and my job as her mother to <br/>
make sure that she was developmentally ready for certain material. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I liked Kelly&#39;s responses about children&#39;s responsibility and about the <br/>
dangers of the mother taking and then accepting responsibility (for years) <br/>
for what a child might or might not like.<br/>
<br/>
Through this whole discussion I&#39;ve been talking about video, DVD, television. <br/>
 Those things are safe at home, easy to walk away from.  I was never talking <br/>
about taking a six year old to a movie theatre with big speakers vibrating <br/>
their chairs and overwhelming two-hour presentations of anything they weren&#39;t <br/>
comfortable with.   <br/>
<br/>
Home.  Video.    Pause/rewind/discuss/walk out.<br/>
<br/>
If kids could walk in and out of movie theatres freely, they  might find some <br/>
things that made them uncomfortable, or find that some kinds of movies <br/>
weren&#39;t really scary for them.  <br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t &quot;make sure she is developmentally ready,&quot; speaking of my own <br/>
daughter.  She becomes developmentally ready by developing at her own pace.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know what her pace is in advance.  Neither does she.<br/>
<br/>
Neither does anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
There is no set order of what will or won&#39;t upset a child.  Nor an adult!  I <br/>
don&#39;t like sudden frights in movies.  When the guy came through the window in <br/>
The Bourne Identity, that was NOT fun for me.  The car chase was cool, <br/>
because the stunts were great, and different, and unlike lots of car chases <br/>
it wasn&#39;t a mass of wrecks, but a series of avoidances.  It was cool.<br/>
<br/>
Had I just been in a car accident lately, the car chase would have been <br/>
painful.  If I enjoyed the sudden adrenaline of surprise, the guy breaking <br/>
through the big window would&#39;ve been fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not liking broken leg scenes lately.  Will Penny, 1967, Charlton Heston <br/>
movie.  La la la, DOH!  A guy broke his leg.  I&#39;m not having fun.  I&#39;m <br/>
temporarily not developmentally ready to deal with broken legs. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My friend Carrie will never be ready to deal with snake movies, so all <br/>
reviews of movies for her involve telling her when to look away or go to the <br/>
bathroom because there&#39;s going to be a snake.  Or &quot;Funny.  No snakes!&quot; That&#39;s <br/>
a good review for her.<br/>
<br/>
The people who put ratings up don&#39;t know my kids.  They don&#39;t know that <br/>
language doesn&#39;t bother them but mean parents spanking or a child being <br/>
locked up or grounded to miss something really important and him crying would <br/>
NOT be a scene they could watch without being truly upset.  What would those <br/>
movies be rated for &quot;child with broken heart is portrayed graphically&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we rent a movie we think Holly would rather not see and we say so.  <br/>
Because she trusts us, and we trust her, and we know her really well and know <br/>
what upsets her, she believes us.  If she needs to come through the room <br/>
she&#39;ll say &quot;Is this a scary part?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s happened maybe three or four times ever.<br/>
<br/>
More often we start watching something, she wanders in and either decides <br/>
it&#39;s good, or too boring, or too scary, and goes away.   Same as adults do.  <br/>
Keith walked away from Sweet Home Alabama because he really hates duplicitous <br/>
characters and situations.  I walked away from Vanishing Point to which I had <br/>
been called because it had Viggo Mortensen ( 1997 remake).  I watched for ten <br/>
minutes and decided to turn it off, because I don&#39;t like high-speed macho car <br/>
fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
No one decided it for me.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and her friend, when they were six, walked in on me sewing and watching <br/>
Twelfth Night.  I told them it was a Shakespeare play.  &quot;What&#39;s it about?&quot;  <br/>
When I said twins, shipwreck and costume, they sat down.  I thought they <br/>
would get bored and go away, but they stayed to the end.  Not because it was <br/>
educational or required or the movie wasn&#39;t over yet, because we were ten <br/>
yards from all of Holly&#39;s toys, twenty yards from a swingset on a nice day, <br/>
and Kelly&#39;s house was across the street.  With all those options, they <br/>
watched Shakespeare.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s developmental chart would have predicted that.<br/>

Same here. In fact we rarely have enough money {and i like the comfort of home} to go to the movies but we rent a lot. And if we really like {or it&#39;s a really good deal on a previously viewed video we will buy it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is no set order of what will or won&#39;t upset a child.  Nor an adult!  I <br/>

Also my personal experiance. I can watch action, and some blood doesn&#39;t bother me. But movies like Friday the 13th or Jaws {I saw when i was 6 and my dad knowing I was scared made me sit through this at the movies}.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Our whole family sat through &quot;Dude, Where&#39;s My Car?&quot;<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a very good movie, but in retrospect there are a couple of running <br/>
jokes from that, and then all the kids got the joke in a piece of send-around <br/>
e-mail about the title of The Lord of the Rings being renamed which was <br/>
Ashton Kuchner (allegedly) suggesting &quot;Dude, Where&#39;s My Precious?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So even a dud can be salvaged in some ways.   <br/>
<br/>
That would have been another good one to watch on video instead of in a real <br/>
theatre.<br/>

getting a few messages these days, not sure why.  But I try to help my boys <br/>
decide what they would like to watch.  We talk about movies before we go see <br/>
them.  I don&#39;t make the choice for them.  And the decision about a certain <br/>
movie isn&#39;t based entirely ont he rating.  I remember when LOTR first came <br/>
out I was a little leary about taking my then 5 and 7 year olds to see it.  <br/>
But they wanted to go so we all went together.  They so enjoyed it, bought <br/>
the movie and watched it several more times.  When the LOTR TT came out we <br/>
went to that as well and all enjoyed it.  We would have missed out on that <br/>
movie if I had said &quot;it isn&#39;t rated G and i think you are too young to see <br/>
it&quot;.   If they had started to look a little scared, and I did ask a couple of <br/>
times if they would like to leave, we would have discussed it and left if <br/>
they wanted.<br/>

4 kids, I haven&#39;t missed a kid movie in at least 14 years..  MOST of them <br/>
were well worth the time and we always ended up buying them on video.  Folks <br/>
who don&#39;t have kids, or don&#39;t watch kids movies are missing out on some great <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s really true. I&#39;m amazed at the quality of stuff that&#39;s <br/>
out there. &quot;Jonah&quot; is the only animated movie I&#39;ve actively disliked <br/>
in a long time. But then my original chosen field of work was 3-D <br/>
animation, so anything by Pixar or companies like it are just drool-<br/>
city for me, and CGI is showing up in so many movies. Something like <br/>
Gollum in LOTR TT, just blows me away. I&#39;ve sat through the Toy Story <br/>
movies (willingly) who knows how many times. And even better is that <br/>
they all come with so much great stuff on the bonus discs. My kids <br/>
and I have learned so much about hand-animation, computer-generated <br/>
stuff, props, costumes, actors, directors. On the Spy Kids II <br/>
commentary, they totally encouraged kids to start using digital video <br/>
and start making and editing their own movies. That really sparked <br/>
both of my kids&#39; interest immediately. Wish we could afford a digital <br/>
video camera sometime in the very near future, but I know we&#39;ll get <br/>
one eventually and they&#39;ll love it.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t seen The Emporor&#39;s New Groove yet, but I guess I&#39;ll add it to <br/>
our netflix list!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also my personal experiance. I can watch action, and some blood doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother me. But movies like Friday the 13th or Jaws {I saw when i was 6 and<br/>
my dad knowing I was scared made me sit through this at the movies}.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love blood and guts in the movies. Always have. Even when I was young. The<br/>
bloodier and gorier the better. Not sure why, it just fascinates me. I get<br/>
upset with movies that always film in the dark where you can&#39;t see what&#39;s<br/>
going on. I love slasher movies. At night when I have my down time and<br/>
everyone is in bed, I watch Discovery Health. Love the paramedic shows and<br/>
the operation shows.  Now I know I&#39;m just one person, but it&#39;s never<br/>
affected me in a negative way. It hasn&#39;t hardened me at all to what goes on<br/>
in the world. I&#39;m not a violent person. I don&#39;t get really angry, I don&#39;t<br/>
hit or throw things if I get mad. So the violent gore studies about people<br/>
being effected by it doesn&#39;t wash with me.<br/>
<br/>
Joe loves the same kind of movies I do, but when it comes to real life like<br/>
the DH channel, he doesn&#39;t like to watch. He&#39;s fine when he knows it&#39;s<br/>
pretend. I get emotional with real life stories, but I still like to watch.<br/>
Turn on the  Soprano&#39;s and I find it revolting most of the time. So one<br/>
persons entertainment is another persons garbage. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
right for me to not allow Joe to watch Soprano&#39;s, I wouldn&#39;t like it if he<br/>
cut off a Jason movie I really wanted to see.<br/>

<br/>
My husband just told us when I was writing the other, he just moved one out of the way while we were asleep the other day. He didn&#39;t want to accidentally step on it and hurt it. My oldest dd was very happy knowing soon she would be out looking for them again this year. All last year they checked, I think everyday, under every rock, in the yard for them. We get them a lot here.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest is pretty well versed what to look for because we went over all that again and again and I have it printed out for her. We only have a couple of species to watch out for here in the triangle of NC. <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy watching them, enjoy nature. They aren&#39;t scared by the circle of life, but I think right now they like the eastern worm snake mostly because all it eats are worms. LOL<br/>

**Our whole family sat through &quot;Dude, Where&#39;s My Car?&quot;<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a very good movie, but in retrospect there are a couple of running <br/>
jokes from that,**<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes!!   its the whole thing about relationship building,  not whether or not the movie/tv show is a good one or not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been sitting here the last few days reading the TV/movie restriction posts.   Wanting to post something but not having the time to put my thoughts down.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to communicate to people who restrict these things that there is so much more to this than meets the eye.  I used to also feel the same way,  I did not see the value in certain TV shows or movies.   I would not miss TV or certain types of movies if I didn&#39;t see them.    But I am now at a different place.    If they want to watch TV they can,  if a movie comes along that they want to watch they can.<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
But the issue isn&#39;t me.... its my kids. <br/>
<br/>
        I figured out which shows I wanted to watch and which shows I didn&#39;t want to.  How did I do that?  By watching.  Not by my mother saying,  &quot;you don&#39;t need to watch that,  that&#39;s crap&quot;.    I pretty much had free reign to TV.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now my kids watch TV,  they watch Johnny Bravo, they watch DragonballZ,  they watch Tom and Jerry,  all the stuff they&#39;ve never seen before.        And you know what?  When I&#39;ve watched it with them, opened my mind up,  I&#39;ve totally had a new experience.   I&#39;m doing it for them and they open up to me.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Its just another avenue in which we can be a family.  In which we can build our relationship.  Yes there are commercials,  yes there is alot of &#39;stuff&#39; there, but we end up talking about it.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
TV will always be in our world,  movies too.   I can&#39;t keep things from them.  I choose to live my children&#39;s lives with them;   experiencing the world as it is and seeing it through their eyes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know for alot of people who are new to these ideas it doesn&#39;t make sense,  its just doesn&#39;t jive with what you feel is important.    <br/>
<br/>
But just try and open up,  try and see that everyone learns in different ways, maybe from a TV show, maybe from a gameboy or Playstation.   We don&#39;t know unless we let them give it a try.  All things have value even if its mindless drivel to you right now.  Let that go,  try and see it differently.  This unschooling life can be so rich,  its so amazing.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Keep reading these posts,  play with your kids,  live life with your kids.    Eventually,  if you allow it,  this will make sense.  Believe me....<br/>

&lt;&lt; The hardest time I have is when my kids want to see something that I <br/>
<br/>
totally have no interest in seeing. If they rent it on DVD, that&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
one thing, but if I have to sit through it in a theatre, that&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
another. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our whole family sat through &quot;Dude, Where&#39;s My Car?&quot;<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a very good movie, but in retrospect there are a couple of running <br/>
jokes from that, and then all the kids got the joke in a piece of send-around <br/>
e-mail about the title of The Lord of the Rings being renamed which was <br/>
Ashton Kuchner (allegedly) suggesting &quot;Dude, Where&#39;s My Precious?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So even a dud can be salvaged in some ways.   <br/>
<br/>
That would have been another good one to watch on video instead of in a real <br/>
theatre.<br/>

Maverick&#39;s (Tom Cruise&#39;s character&#39;s) &quot;Magic Power Necklace&quot; and how <br/>
Maverick rubbed the necklace when he needed power, but when he no <br/>
longer needed it, he threw it to the ocean. Of course, the &quot;magic <br/>
power necklace&quot; was the chain and dog tags from Maverick&#39;s <br/>
friend &quot;Goose&quot; who died, and there was a scene where he takes the <br/>
chain out and looks at it and rubs his thumb over it. It was just <br/>
really fascinating to me the completely different way my child <br/>
interpreted those scenes, and probably the whole movie. I love those <br/>
eye-opening moments when you get a window into your child&#39;s mind. <br/>
What a great experience!<br/>

Our kids somehow missed the Pokemon movie and we were able to do video.<br/>
Thank you very much. BUT, I wasn&#39;t so lucky with the PowerPuff girls movie.<br/>
I took Sierra and Joseph. I just couldn&#39;t get into it at all. Took maybe a<br/>
15 minute nap which is something I never do. Don&#39;t even nap at a home!!!<br/>
Well Joseph was very upset with me later. Couldn&#39;t understand how I could<br/>
have fallen asleep during such a great movie. So I assured him I didn&#39;t<br/>
sleep long and when I was able to tell him the parts I did see, he felt<br/>
better. Yes it sucked but then it didn&#39;t because they loved it. That makes<br/>
it worth it.<br/>

I Don&#39;t think I am ready to let my 7 year old watch movies like Blade <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885491196">I love this topic!  It&#39;s so nice to *not* be alone :)<br/>
I never consciously censored the kids, but one day *POOF* they had interest <br/>
in movies outside of their *age category*  I think it began with *Princess <br/>
Bride* I received as a gift after DH died ~ I had forgotten about the &quot;I want <br/>
my father back, you S.O.B.&quot; line and was a bit concerned when it came out in <br/>
front of the kids, but they just rolled with it (lots of empathy for Inigo!). <br/>
 One night I stayed up to watch *Signs* by myself and Hayden (4) woke up.  I <br/>
just told him, I&#39;m gonna watch a grown up movie and I don&#39;t know what this <br/>
movie is about.  If you want to stay and watch it fine, if not, fine.  He <br/>
stayed up and watched every single minute of the movie then woke his sister <br/>
at the crack of dawn so *she* could see it too.  She loves it!  They&#39;re just <br/>
coming off the thrill of the aliens and are now beginning to understand the <br/>
point of the movie ~ all things happen for a reason.  I guess I was bonked by <br/>
the unschooling god, I wouldn&#39;t trade this lesson for any g-rated movie!<br/>
<br/>
I personally believe that kids can handle *anything* given the proper <br/>
support.  I let my kids watch things that may not be *appropriate* because I <br/>
TALK to them, explain to them, prepare them, participate with them; then <br/>
after the movie I talk some more, explain some more, and listen, listen, <br/>
listen for what I may learn from their perspective!<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen Blade.<br/>
The Patriot has lots of parts she could watch.  It has two scenes I don&#39;t <br/>
want to see any more myself, but now I know where they are, and I&#39;ll offer to <br/>
go get drinks for people next time it&#39;s on if I know the scary parts are <br/>
coming.<br/>
<br/>
[calling kids in to interview them, 11:09 at night...]<br/>
<br/>
Marty has seen Blade and says it&#39;s not realistic enough to really scare a kid.<br/>
<br/>
Marty saw Exorcist III at the neighbor&#39;s house when he was 10 and it was too <br/>
scary and he was sorry he saw it.  It made him scared of walking alone in the <br/>
dark, he says.<br/>
<br/>
Holly says the worst movies she&#39;s seen are Fight Club and The Exorcist <br/>
(original 70&#39;s one).  When she saw The Exorcist, I tried to talk her out of <br/>
it, but she really wanted to be in on it because there were five teens, plus <br/>
me.   I stayed in because Holly wanted to stay.<br/>
<br/>
Partly the tension was broken by the number of people there.  Partly the <br/>
special effects were old-timey (to their eyes).  Partly I made comments <br/>
fairly often about how something was done, or the reaction in the theater <br/>
when I first saw it, first run.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly has watched Fight Club several times, though, and even by herself.  <br/>
She&#39;s pretty clear on the subtleties of the plot.  She probably could explain <br/>
some stuff to me!<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also very familiar with lots My Little Pony, Rainbow Brite, Ninja <br/>
Turtles  (movies and cartoons), Disney everything, Muppet/Muppet Babies / <br/>
Sesame Street lost of video, Winnie the Pooh (book, movie, TV series), <br/>
musicals (lots), and so it wasn&#39;t like the taste of video blood ruined her <br/>
for happy G-rated stuff!<br/>

convince my husband and he brought up the movie BLade (we both like that<br/>
movie) alot of movies he and i like to watch are grafic. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only older one I have that never had any tv or movie restrictions is<br/>
Tara. She&#39;s 17 and from a very young age liked the bloody scary movies. I<br/>
remember when she was very young, before a year old, she liked watching<br/>
wrestling with her dad. I thought it was kind of strange for a baby to watch<br/>
like she did, especially that. It wasn&#39;t like every day but when it was on<br/>
she watched. When she was 3 and 4 she would stay up with me and watch<br/>
Arsenio Hall and Trapper John MD. She also like Sesame Street and Care Bears<br/>
and Smurfs and such too. Along with Jaws and Robocop!<br/>
She never got scared, I always watched with her and talked about stuff and<br/>
even stopped movies to answer questions or whatever. I didn&#39;t find it<br/>
excessive or obsessive with her. She liked so many other things besides<br/>
scary movies.<br/>
<br/>
She still has no problems now with scary movies. She likes just about all<br/>
kinds. She does jump and scream now when she watches something very tense<br/>
and unexpectedly scary. She never did that when she was younger. She&#39;s not a<br/>
violent person and she&#39;s not scared of much, well except for bugs. They&#39;ll<br/>
send her screaming into the night in a heartbeat!!! Florida, what a great<br/>
place for her to live!!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t worry about no tv or movie restrictions with the other 3.<br/>
I&#39;m parenting them better than I was able to with Tara and she turned out<br/>
fine so it&#39;s certainly not tv that corrupts in this house.<br/>
Alyssa at 2 and a half just started to watch tv a little while ago. She<br/>
doesn&#39;t watch for long but she did make it through the whole Piglet movie<br/>
last week. Her first movie too. The trick was to keep feeding her! Worked at<br/>
the circus! Her tv attention span is at the most 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph (8) and Sierra (7) love dinosaur, shark, gator and bug movies. In<br/>
fact today Joseph was watching Orkin bug movies I sent away  for free!!!<br/>
Joseph will say he doesn&#39;t want anything too scary. So far he hasn&#39;t asked<br/>
to see anything that has been too much for him. He doesn&#39;t ask to see Jason<br/>
or Freddy type movies. He likes Die Hard and action stuff. He&#39;ll also watch<br/>
medical shows with me too. Sierra watches about the same as he does. Joseph<br/>
gets a little antsy if the romance gets a bit heated but so far nothing to<br/>
graphic that way. Naked bodies don&#39;t bother them, it&#39;s only when the<br/>
touching gets a bit much he&#39;ll say something. So now we just make sure he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be uncomfortable and for what they ask to watch, it really<br/>
doesn&#39;t come up often.<br/>
<br/>
Of course they all love Dragon Ball, Yu Gi Oh, Hamtaurro, Rugrats and Pooh<br/>
too. A nice blend I think.<br/>

too. What does bother her? Does she like action movies without the graphic<br/>
gore and violence? If she&#39;s been restricted to kiddie movies maybe start off<br/>
with tamer stuff and find out what she likes and doesn&#39;t like. (Lara Croft<br/>
had lots of mayhem with no blood. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Xena was more<br/>
graphic but still not Blade level if you get the Oxygen channel.) If she&#39;s<br/>
an only you might want to watch with just the 2 of you during the day so she<br/>
has full freedom to turn it off. In our family if we&#39;re all settled in for<br/>
the evening to watch a movie, if my daughter doesn&#39;t like something her<br/>
options are to go off by herself or have one or both of us give up the movie<br/>
too. And those aren&#39;t really great options.<br/>
<br/>
When you know what bothers her then you can use Screen It!<br/>
(http://www.screenit.com) to find out if a movie has any of the things that<br/>
bother her in it.<br/>

cartoons and occasional live action show that has animals.<br/>
<br/>
It helps now that Kathryn is older (11) and can articulate what it is she<br/>
doesn&#39;t like. It was a mystery when she was younger. Some action movies she<br/>
was fine with and some she wasn&#39;t. Indiana Jones seemed like the perfect mix<br/>
of action and humor but she always nixes it when we suggested it. Eventually<br/>
she was able to tell us that skeletons bother her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656684016">Its crazy though, the whole movie thing...<br/>
 <br/>
We rented Robin Hood last week,  the one with AR (Alan Rickman) and the &#39;other guy&#39;   thought the kids would like it.   Didn&#39;t think it would be too graphic or anything, well,  the opening scene has Robin in a prison where hands are being cut off,,,oops.    My son walks away disgusted,   &quot;I hate movies like this...&quot;  I really thought he would like the adventure part of it.    He loves LOTR and Star Wars.      I was really struggling.   Struck out again...<br/>
My dd and I watched it,       I talked with Alec about it later,   from what I can figure,  is that Robin Hood was more real?   LOTR  is more make believe?    I guess that makes sense.   He&#39;ll watch  Matrix and stuff like that , Terminator,   blow em up stuff like that,  but can&#39;t watch Robin Hood?        <br/>
A day later my dd wanted to watch it again,  she likes to listen closer and get the dialogue better.   So  my ds and I were going to play a game.   (In the same room)  he was fine with that.     As the movie went on he really got into it,   but the real people in and such must really be too much for him.<br/>
 <br/>
Then,  yesterday we watched Wild America,  loved it,  but,  boy there are some intense scenes in that.    With the aligators  or when they are going in a cave,    had to shut it off my daughter was stressing out.    (Yet she had no problem with the hands being cut off or seeing the Orcs in LOTR)  We did end up watching it all but we had to give it a pause.  Get some popcorn,  that kind-of thing.            So,  its very interesting how different things affect us. <br/>
I know when I was in high school I was standing in a the walk way of a mall. Watching an excerpt from Friday the 13th,  mid day, people walking all around me, they had it on in a video rental place.   I almost fainted when Jason came out of a lake at some kids in a boat.<br/>
Can you imagine me in the theater with one of those?         But I&#39;ll watch Robin Hood and LOTR and such,  no problem....<br/>
 <br/>
I think we&#39;ll all be OK going to the Piglet movie,  whew.....<br/>
