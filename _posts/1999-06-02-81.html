<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025838521">A quick intro: I&#39;m Carol from New Zealand, and am in the middle of<br/>
moving house after 21 years. There&#39;s only 3 chairs left in this house -<br/>
dh has one, the cat (very stressed) has the second, so I just have to<br/>
sit on the computer chair!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been homeschooling my kids nearly all there lives. No 1 went to<br/>
school for 7 weeks, no. 4 went for 5 weeks. No 1 is now 18, has recently<br/>
left home and is working for a beekeeper.<br/>
<br/>
We have just sold our house to another homeschooling family, with 8<br/>
children, who we didn&#39;t know till they came to look at the house. We are<br/>
planning to buy a little land in the country and build, but in the<br/>
meantime are renting a house 1/2 an hour from town to see how we like<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
I have always liked the ideas of unschooling, but am not always as<br/>
trusting as I could be - kids with some learning difficulties in &#39;basic&#39;<br/>
areas such as reading and writing test one&#39;s philosophical outlook<br/>
somewhat. Still, I think I&#39;m far too lazy to spend too much time being<br/>
structured and organised and trying to manipulate unwilling people so we<br/>
do tend to be pretty much unschoolers, in spite of my internal battles!<br/>
