<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963391608">&quot;She&#39;s the sort of woman who lives for others - you can always<br/>
tell the others by their hunted expression.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Screwtape Letters<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a balance - and one that gets struck everyday.  Most people,<br/>
most of the time, like to do things themselves competently and<br/>
easily.  Each day a child can and will master new skills of adult<br/>
living, unless you stop them.  For myself, I see it as a loop or<br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
- First the child can&#39;t - then I will absolutely and with no<br/>
hesitation.<br/>
- Second a child can, but doesn&#39;t know how - the I will do it<br/>
with, alongside, watching from the sidelines as cheerleader or<br/>
whatever so the child can; I may still do it when speed or<br/>
precision matters.  That&#39;s why getting dressed to go to a wedding<br/>
is supervised long after getting dressed to play in the back yard<br/>
is ignored.  This is a tough spot and will lead to some days that<br/>
all of the laundry comes out pink - and to days of tempery &quot;I CAN<br/>
DO IT, MOM&quot; when judgments about ability differ.<br/>
-Third a child can and does regularly<br/>
- Fourth Mom doing it for them is a gift of love, just like the<br/>
cup of coffee they bring me in bed at some point.<br/>
<br/>
Until they can do it, every time I do it is a bit of keeping<br/>
power and competency as my own special kingdom.  There are things<br/>
that I do believe it is my right to keep as my own kingdom<br/>
because the kids is not yet ready - our 6 y.o. is allowed to<br/>
start the car, but not drive it.  But I look at the things I do<br/>
through the filter of how they keep the child from learning to<br/>
master the world.<br/>

| &gt; I believe that unschooling works best when we moms get our<br/>
desires out of<br/>
| &gt; the picture.  In fact, I&#39;d say that where parenting is<br/>
concerned, that is<br/>
| &gt; true overall, but in order for unschooling to happen in its<br/>
most beautiful<br/>
| &gt; way, we need to let go of what WE want so our kids can become<br/>
more familiar<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
| &gt; with what THEY want, and set their goals, and dream, and form<br/>
plans, and<br/>
| &gt; all that.<br/>
| &gt;<br/>
|<br/>
| So if WE WANT to see them happy, We WANT to do things to honor<br/>
their being,<br/>
| as long as I keep doing things that make them happy because I<br/>
WANT to it&#39;s<br/>
| not good?  See just when I think I understand it I really<br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
|<br/>
| OK,  I do certain things that I know they like because I know<br/>
it makes them<br/>
| happy. BUT am I somehow impeding their growth by doing these<br/>
things without<br/>
| them specifically asking?  Or is it just selfish thing to<br/>
continue to do the<br/>
| things for them?<br/>
|<br/>
| Do you all plan special things for your children without them<br/>
asking?  How do<br/>
| you go about it so that it is not something about YOU and is<br/>
completely for<br/>
| the child?<br/>
|<br/>
| Or is it simply enough to say, I love having my two grown<br/>
children come home<br/>
| for dinner every night with the rest of the family so I will<br/>
just continue to<br/>
| cook meals that they enjoy?  Whatever the outcome, they get fed<br/>
and loved and<br/>
| sent back out into the world for another day, so what if it&#39;s<br/>
all about me?<br/>
| Or do I try to find some other place to be?  That I don&#39;t do<br/>
things unless<br/>
| requested?<br/>
|<br/>
| I really really don&#39;t want any of this to be about ME, that<br/>
would defeat my<br/>
| entire purpose of parenting.  ME things are other things, not<br/>
about things tha<br/>
| t bless my family.<br/>
|<br/>
| How do you all go about that?<br/>
