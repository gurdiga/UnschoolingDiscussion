<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182136164">Okay I&#39;ll give it a shot:<br/>
<br/>
Moochie - shepherd collie - nice dog, neighbor kids started teasing <br/>
him which could have become hazardous with little kids so he was <br/>
sent to a nice farm where he could run and play<br/>
Pokey - mix breed, chewed up a couch. Goodbye Pokey<br/>
Tex - sheep terrier (they were trying to establish a new breed) - <br/>
shaggy in winter, trimmed his coat in summer, looked like a <br/>
Bedlington terrier - lambish<br/>
Buddy - Elkhound shepherd mix - smart and strong, a real sweetie<br/>
Quinn - German Shepherd, retired guide dog<br/>
Bo - Alsatian (white) Shepherd, big galoot, huge but sweet as pie<br/>
-these were all dogs my family had as I grew up<br/>
<br/>
Bucky - lab golden retriever mix pound pup - lovable, thinks he&#39;s a <br/>
lap dog<br/>
Java - German Shepherd, retired guide dog<br/>
-These are our current furry friends.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of get the idea that I like BIG dogs? Maybe big furry things in <br/>
general because DH is 6&#39;, 300 lbs, full facial hair ;-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387306257">Sasha - Spitz/Boston Terrier mix - My first dog, we got her when I was in kindergarten, she had parvo when we got her, we didn&#39;t know.  She died quickly.<br/>
Chee Chako - Black Lab/Irish Setter mix - My childhood dog (she was actually my brothers, but anyway....), I adored her, she lived to be very old.<br/>
Foofur - Chocolate Lab/Cocker Spaniel mix - I was working in a pet store in high school when this man came in and literally threw her at me, told me to &quot;get rid of her.&quot;  She was very skittish, and so ugly she was cute.  Died just a few years ago, also very old.<br/>
Bailey - German Sheppard/Chow mix - Beautiful dog, found her in the middle of a very busy street (she was just a puppy).  She is very protective, and loves attention.  I keep her away from kids that she doesn&#39;t know well just in case.  She is extremely protective of both me and Richard.<br/>
Black Dog - Lab mix/Sharpei  mix - My brother&#39;s dog had puppies, my niece named the blonde one sunshine and the black one midnight.  They (the sisters) were fighting, so I took the black one.  I used to tease my niece that sunshine and midnight were very generic names, so I called her black dog.  It stuck.  Also so ugly that she is cute.<br/>
<br/>
The last two are my current dogs.  They are both quite old.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138531550">Lobo - red heeler (Austrailian cattle dog). Great girl, very loyal and<br/>
protective.<br/>
Spike - blue heeler - kind of a goofy dog, with an underbite so his<br/>
tongue always hung out. Would play fetch for days and days on end. My mom<br/>
meant to name him &quot;Spice&quot; but we misheard her.<br/>
Rusty - pedigreed Irish Terrier - My mom inhereited this dog from her<br/>
father after he died. He was a strange, strange dog, who seemed to have<br/>
frequent hallucinations. We know my grandpa used to beat him for running<br/>
away, too.<br/>
Mariah - black lab/blue heeler mix - my first dog after I left home. Very<br/>
sweet, great dog.<br/>
Armstrong - blue heeler - technically my dad&#39;s dog, but we lived with<br/>
them for 8 months and he thinks I&#39;m his person, too. Has probably been<br/>
abused, used to bite everyone (including both Rain and my dad, on the<br/>
face) but also used to lie with my mom on the bathroom floor while she<br/>
was having chemo<br/>
Nana- border collie - Wandered up to the home of an unschooling family in<br/>
Texas, right about the time I posted on a list about wanting a dog.. full<br/>
of energy, still a bit tweaky, but such a good dog. Very bonded to me...<br/>
Keith - chocolate lab - we adopted him 2 years ago. He has been in a 3x3<br/>
cement floor cage for a year ( a no kill shelter that over-extended<br/>
itself) and was a mess. He was clearly an old dog then, whith a<br/>
snow-white muzzle, but 2 years of good care have made a big difference,<br/>
and he&#39;s a great old dog<br/>
<br/>
Dar, kind of a suck for hard-luck cases, i guess...</div>
