<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046201878">I&#39;m sorry things got as crazy as they did here.   Someone I was really close <br/>
to, a singing and guitar playing buddy, a best friend, died early.  He had <br/>
grown up without a dad because of alcohol.  He left his kids because of <br/>
alcohol, and died in another state.  Both his parents were alcoholics.  My <br/>
mom was.  We both swore we would never drink.  I didn&#39;t; he did.  <br/>
<br/>
Alcoholism is common in my mom&#39;s family.  She has two of six siblings who <br/>
weren&#39;t alcoholics; the rest were.  Her dad was, her mom wasn&#39;t.   My sister <br/>
is, I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
Jon had two alcoholic parents, though, and most of his many siblings drank a <br/>
lot.  <br/>
His dad was Navajo.   Navajos seem to be passing alcoholism and Fetal Alcohol <br/>
Syndrome on at an alarming rate, compared to other groups in the area.  <br/>
Apaches too, I hear (even worse, I&#39;ve heard) but I don&#39;t know any Apaches.  <br/>
I&#39;ve never lived where they did.  <br/>
<br/>
Families are BADLY harmed by alcohol.  My brother&#39;s girlfriend/partner drinks <br/>
constantly.  Who&#39;s taking care of her kids?  I don&#39;t even know.  Five kids.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s clear to anyone why so many Navajos are drinking, and if I&#39;m racist <br/>
to say genetics are a factor, that&#39;s crazy.  If it&#39;s &quot;simply&quot; the fault of <br/>
&quot;white people&quot; (not a term used in New Mexico much), THAT is racist.   Do <br/>
individuals not have free will?  Jon did.  He knew before.  He knew during.  <br/>
He knew how to stop.  He knew what it was like to be without a dad.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom knew.  She knew during.  She stopped for nine years.  She could stop <br/>
again but she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
Whose fault is it that so many anglos in New Mexico and Texas are in genetic <br/>
alcoholic lines?  My dad wasn&#39;t an alcoholic.  My mom&#39;s second husband was <br/>
BIGTIME.  My half brother didn&#39;t have a chance.  Does he drink because of <br/>
&quot;white people&quot;?  <br/>
<br/>
Seems racist to me to suggest that a whole tribe is drinking because of <br/>
outside factors, but that their neighbors drink for individual reasons.<br/>
<br/>
When someone is genetically pre-disposed, they just need to not drink, or <br/>
they need to go ahead and drink and not blame other people for that decision.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t go against what I see with my own eyes and what I know from personal <br/>
experience just to make someone vaguely more comfortable or justified in some <br/>
other state.  I can&#39;t pretend all American Indians are one homogenous group <br/>
any more than all Europeans are one homogenous group or all Pagans are <br/>
worshipping the same Green Man and the same spirits.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who would be happier if another person would just roll over and say <br/>
something they don&#39;t believe would end up with false agreement and no more.  <br/>
I can&#39;t be dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same way no matter who the kid is.  It doesn&#39;t matter, <br/>
when parents are helping kids learn in their own way at their own pace what <br/>
the kid&#39;s background, politics, IQ, genetics, ethnicity, <br/>
class/caste/height/religion.  I wish more people could do it, but I think <br/>
those who can and who want to should.  I think it leads to a dozen other <br/>
facets of life people never consider when they first hear &quot;unschooling.&quot;  I <br/>
don&#39;t think it should lead to censorship and shaming.<br/>
<br/>
Other questions (accusations disguised as questions) were whether if a woman <br/>
says &quot;sexist&quot; that&#39;s proof.  No.  There are women promoting sexism <br/>
themselves.  There are women who convince themselves various ways to subject <br/>
themselves to men, even if the men are abusive.  There are women giving their <br/>
daughters dangerous messages.  There is one homeschooling curriculum with <br/>
different coursework for boys than girls.  Then there are men with a keen <br/>
sense of fairness who see men and women as equals and remind others to do so <br/>
too, when they have a chance.  Some men know more about sexism than some <br/>
women do.<br/>
<br/>
If someone knows a lot about Texas, for example, because of some personal <br/>
interest or fascination, just because I lived in Texas for a few years when I <br/>
was little doesn&#39;t mean I can say &quot;Well I know more about Texas because I&#39;ve <br/>
lived there.&quot;  If someone has lived there fifty years, they might know less <br/>
about some aspects or factoids or history than someone who has read, <br/>
interviewed people, and for whatever reason really cared to learn.  <br/>
<br/>
The argument that some jobs should be just for men because men are stronger <br/>
than women lost out in the 1970&#39;s.  If strength is the issue, then go with <br/>
strength, not gender.  Unless we want to argue that it&#39;s okay to say the <br/>
weakest man is stronger than the strongest woman, why is it okay to say that <br/>
ANY one person who identifies himself as American Indian gets to speak for <br/>
all of them, and will be able to veto the experience or opinion of someone <br/>
who isn&#39;t Indian or is only 1/4 instead of half, or WHATever.  Information is <br/>
information, and some people don&#39;t have all that much.  Propaganda is <br/>
propaganda, and some people have LOADS of it, and don&#39;t care to decide what&#39;s <br/>
true and what&#39;s sensationalism.  <br/>
<br/>
Some kinds of propaganda aims at prevention of learning.  It says &quot;Here are <br/>
the simple answers, just trust them.  Don&#39;t look at anyone else&#39;s answers, <br/>
just those I&#39;ve just given you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seemed today that saying &quot;There are other factors&quot; was met with &quot;Then <br/>
you&#39;re a racist.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling works very well with anyone&#39;s checklist of what not <br/>
to read, or what not to allow, or what not to watch.  <br/>
<br/>
But I think this discussion started with questions about what to get for kids <br/>
for history, didn&#39;t it?  More than one source, primary sources are good... <br/>
and we came to this yucky fight.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it hadn&#39;t happened, and I&#39;m sorry if people&#39;s feelings were hurt.  <br/>

Thanks.  <br/>

Both our moms are still living, still drinking, in their 70&#39;s.  So when they <br/>
say drinking will kill you, it means will kill an otherwise able-bodied man <br/>
of 35, it seems.  <br/>
<br/>
Life doesn&#39;t re-wind.  At the funeral Jon&#39;s son, Tinini, was 14 or 15.  I <br/>
took him aside and told him his dad had resolved not to drink, but had not <br/>
succeeded.  I asked him to try his hardest NOT to drink, because if he <br/>
started he might not be able to stop.  Naturally he looked at me politely, <br/>
but like I was a crazy lady, and went back to his friends.    I talked to his <br/>
mom a couple of months ago.  He&#39;s drinking some, and he has a baby.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916017133">Sandra - I did not disguise accusations as questions. I asked questions about the fats. I didn&#39;t even state that you knew the facts or had thought about the facts.<br/>
<br/>
No said that AI&#39;s are not &quot;genetically&quot; dispossed to alcoholism. <br/>
I asked &quot;If this happened ....would you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you would not.<br/>
<br/>
As for sexism - I didn&#39;t speak of proof - I said If a woman says something is sexist - can a man deny <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
Now you attack me, my blood, my history, my culture, the basic person that is me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;ANY one person who identifies himself as American Indian gets to speak for <br/>

who isn&#39;t Indian or is only 1/4 instead of half, or WHATever.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;<br/>
Gee, that worked FOR whites for years!! Any one AI could agree to whatever - and the US Govt. took that as gospel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look back and really read this thread. <br/>
Please, well, I was going to ask that you not insult me any further.<br/>
But you have.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry for your friend.<br/>
I am sorry for your life with an alcoholic. Truly, I am. It is always hard w/ alcohol in the picture.<br/>
<br/>
None of that changes what you said. <br/>
You are very good at diverting the subject. Ex: sexism - well - you go on to state how just because a woman says it&#39;s sexism doesn&#39;t mean its sexism. Therefore, just because an American Indian says its racism - well, I&#39;m only one and can&#39;t speak for all AI&#39;s;  a group of AI&#39;s can&#39;t say what is racist because this group isn&#39;t speaking for all AI&#39;s.<br/>
Let&#39;s just get on with other things now because Sandra has made these statements.<br/>
You have dismissed me, my thoughts, in fact, my life - why? Because I don&#39;t have a majority of all AI&#39;s - living or dead to agree w/ me?<br/>
<br/>
Did you read the story of SuAn<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think that many of the parents involved would go to their maker swearing they aren&#39;t racist?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t be dishonest&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how you see it.<br/>
I see a racist in denial.<br/>

<br/>
I have no idea what other individuals will or will not do or think.<br/>
<br/>
I do know I&#39;ve spent my life NOT choosing friends on the basis of color or <br/>
religion, have pressed others around me to shut up if they were telling <br/>
hateful jokes or making any slurs, that my kids are appalled when they see <br/>
stupidity, and I know that people are individuals.  Few individuals have nor <br/>
should any have the responsibility to make or break the reputation of their <br/>
&quot;race.&quot;  Judging an entire group of people to be bad OR TO BE GOOD as a group <br/>
is racism by definition.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this list is racist.  I don&#39;t think that saying let kids read <br/>
books and decide is racist.  I don&#39;t think providing a list of books with <br/>
information on why certain characters have been objected to *by the <br/>
reviewers* is a bad thing in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the suggestion that beause something is on a list of things that <br/>
someone or a group or a church or &quot;a race&quot; objected to then an unschooling <br/>
family won&#39;t ever read them is very, very bad.<br/>
Reviews are written by individual people.  They can give their reasons, and <br/>
others can read that and consider whether they want to bypass the book, or <br/>
read it and understand more deeply those objections.<br/>
<br/>
Telling other people what to read isn&#39;t censorship unless you make it <br/>
physically difficult for them to get to the books, and that didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>
Telling someone that unless they agree with you that a book is racist that <br/>
THEY are racist is a little more pressure than seems good or right.<br/>
