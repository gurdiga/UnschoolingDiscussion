<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746996652">Our homeschool group hosts a &quot;Not Back to School&quot; Party on the day that the<br/>
public schoolers go back to school.  We take over a local park and there are<br/>
300+ families that come out.  It is our largest attended function of the<br/>
year.  It is a celebration that our children aren&#39;t in public school.  Not<br/>
all the families are unschoolers, but they are growing.<br/>
<br/>
We just went shopping for supplies and had a blast.  It&#39;s really more of a<br/>
replenishing shopping trip.  Our girls love to have those new composition<br/>
books for poetry, cartoons, short stories, ect.  They love to write with the<br/>
gel pens in rainbow colors.  I think I have more fun...I pick out new stuff<br/>
for me, too!<br/>
<br/>
As far as spreading the word of unschooling, I take an &quot;attraction rather<br/>
than promotion&quot; approach.  I live unschooling and people can see that in my<br/>
life.  They come to me with questions about how we do it.  If I were to<br/>
chase them down, they&#39;d feel assaulted.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my take on it.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
