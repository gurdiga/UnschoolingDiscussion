 size="2">Maybe.&nbsp; But I would still say that if someone is at the beginning 
of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;continuum, maybe they&#39;re not &quot;strictly unschooling&quot;.&nbsp; 
Sounds more like thinking about unschooling, or hoping to unschool, or maybe 
&quot;relaxed&quot; homeschooling.&nbsp; My advice to anyone who was at that point would 
be to jump right in, the water&#39;s fine :).&nbsp; Why waste a lot of time dipping 
your toes in the edge?&nbsp; Too quickly those kids will be adults, and you, and 
they, may never have gotten wet.&nbsp; (A goofy analogy, I 
know)</font></span></div>
