<div id="ygrps-yiv-194257282">This is a true story from the WordPerfect helpline. Needless to say, <br/>
the help <br/>
desk employee was fired; however, he/she is currently suing the Word <br/>
Perfect <br/>
organization for &quot;Termination without Cause.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actual dialogue of a former WordPerfect Customer Support employee <br/>
with a <br/>
caller:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ridge Hall computer assistant; may I help you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, well, I&#39;m having trouble with WordPerfect.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What sort of trouble?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went <br/>
away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Went away?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They disappeared.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nothing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s blank; it won&#39;t accept anything when I type.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you still in WordPerfect, or did you get out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How do I tell?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s a sea-prompt?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There isn&#39;t any cursor, I told you, it won&#39;t accept anything I type.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Does your monitor have a power indicator?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s a monitor?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV.  Does it <br/>
have a <br/>
little light that tells you when it&#39;s on?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power <br/>
cord goes <br/>
into it. Can you see that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it&#39;s plugged into <br/>
the wall.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.......Yes, it is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two <br/>
cables <br/>
plugged into the back of it, not just one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the <br/>
other cable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;.......Okay, here it is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Follow it for me, and tell me if it&#39;s plugged securely into the back <br/>
of your <br/>
computer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t reach.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t have the right angle - it&#39;s because <br/>
it&#39;s dark.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dark?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes - the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming <br/>
in  from <br/>
the window.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, turn on the office light then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No? Why not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because there&#39;s a power outage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A power... A power outage? Ah, Okay, we&#39;ve got it licked now. Do you <br/>
still <br/>
have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like <br/>
it was when <br/>
you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Really? Is it that bad?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid it is.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tell them you&#39;re too stupid to own a computer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
