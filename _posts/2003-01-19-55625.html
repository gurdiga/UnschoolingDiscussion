&gt; So, on top of the short amount of sleep we are all<br/>
&gt; getting (they aren&#39;t really old enough for me to go and take a nap<br/>
&gt; and leave them to thier own devices and going to bed before them is<br/>
&gt; not an option, at this point) they are so full of energy they ware me<br/>
&gt; out just watching them and being that i can only watch before i am<br/>
&gt; drafted into all of there adventures, and we have lots of them, I am<br/>
&gt; finding my self so tired that i&#39;m rethinking this whole candy thing.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to restict them but I&#39;m at the point that I can&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; real clear, I&#39;m so tired. So, those of you that have done this, and<br/>
&gt; lived to tell the tale, it will get better wont it?<br/>

own body rhythms do that.<br/>
<br/>
Candy at midnight might cause a child to stay up until 1 a.m. (might, not<br/>
will) or some similar short period of energy-boost, but then the effects<br/>
fade fast and the caffeine and carbo crash hits.<br/>
<br/>
What causes &quot;excess&quot; energy is being 1 and 4 :) and since it&#39;s winter they<br/>
might also not have an opportunity for as much fresh air, outside-exercise<br/>
as they need. Cabin fever is not just for adults.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did at that age was put us all in a small room (usually their<br/>
bedroom) and lay down and let them play around me while I caught brief<br/>
little (like 1 to 20 minutes) naps for an hour or two. I was there, I was<br/>
mostly-aware, I would wake to any sudden noise or request. It helped a lot.<br/>
<br/>
You could also find someone who could come to your house and play with them<br/>
sometimes (an older homeschooling child, another sleep-deprived mother you<br/>
could trade with by going to her house) while you have a nap.<br/>
<br/>
You could nap as soon as your husband gets home while he plays with them for<br/>
an hour or so, and then he gets to go to bed at a decent hour (all this<br/>
assuming he works outside the house). On the weekends, he can stay up and<br/>
you can go to bed at a decent hour.<br/>
<br/>
And it does get better as they get older. My daughters are usually up later<br/>
than my husband and I, but at 8 and 5 they&#39;re perfectly capable of handling<br/>
their own bedtime.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399135445">Hi Pam, yah I&#39;m comming to the conculsion that it&#39;s because they are 1 and 4. we live in San Diego so they get to play out side a lot, not as much as they would like, we live in a sm. apartment complex on a fairly busy street so unless Jason or I is able to be out, at least keeping an eye them it&#39;s not real safe for them. I&#39;ll try your nap idea, it may just do the trick. Jason has been home with us for 14 months, do to a pretty serious work injury and he trys to take the kids out so that I can catch a nap but he can only be out for a short period of time before the pain is really overwhelming. He also just started night school so our schedual has changed a bunch.<br/>
So far the only other hsers I have met in my area are the &#39;school at home&#39; type or the &#39;we unschool everyting but math and english&#39; so they are usually only free on the weekends. <br/>
But we will be moving in the next few months and i&#39;m hoping for a yard and tons of unschoolers in the neighborhood :-)<br/>
