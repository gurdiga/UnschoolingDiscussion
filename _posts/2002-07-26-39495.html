<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084292882">Yes, I&#39;ll admit it. Twenty years ago, I was not as confident about<br/>
UNschooling as I am today, but I still have a long way to go.<br/>
<br/>
I really liked pamS&#39;s post. I&#39;m happy for you that you &quot;played with words<br/>
for the fun of it.&quot; That&#39;s what I was trying to do with my kid.<br/>
<br/>
If it ain&#39;t fun, don&#39;t do it. However, people come to this egroup (and to<br/>
Luz and me privately) with anxiety and confusion about how to get their kids<br/>
to learn things they believe are important. The answers are not easy. Many<br/>
people, no matter what we say, still believe there are things that they need<br/>
to teach their kids since they don&#39;t seem to know certain stuff, and the<br/>
parents feel (naturally) responsible.<br/>
<br/>
I was one of those people years ago. I believed that it was important for my<br/>
kid to know the connection between letters and sounds -- a simple fact, but<br/>
not obvious to all. It was (is) also my conviction that public schools teach<br/>
reading by the totally ridiculous and harmful nonsense known as &quot;Whole<br/>
Language&quot; that creates exactly the wrong concept for learning to read, and<br/>
causes most of the &quot;learning disabilities&quot; that kids in those schools have.<br/>
<br/>
In my defense, I believe that parents teach their children, even when and if<br/>
they are trying their darnedest NOT to teach them. I wanted NOT to be my<br/>
kid&#39;s teacher, but I wanted to be sure that he knew the principle behind the<br/>
English language -- phonics. What to do...?<br/>
<br/>
My experiment with teaching phonics -- using the regrigerator as a<br/>
blackboard --  lasted about four days (in actual time, about 38 seconds<br/>
total) and no more than twenty short words were ever put up before my kid<br/>
(who already could read) asked me to stop messing with his head by thinking<br/>
it was some sort of fun game for him because it insulted his intelligence.<br/>
 <br/>
That was enough. I quit doing it. He didn&#39;t like it. He didn&#39;t participate,<br/>
but it was because he already knew what I was doing. My failure was not<br/>
knowing that he already knew the principles. I&#39;m still sorry twenty years<br/>
later :,&lt;(. Kids can KNOW principles without being taught them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s OK (or even important) for parents to know/learn phonics. But<br/>
don&#39;t teach it to your kids. Is it the same for horseback riding, or<br/>
sailing?<br/>
<br/>
Am I getting it now?<br/>
<br/>
So can we talk about not teaching/learning arithmetic? :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;Once a child is reading, it doesn&#39;t matter how he learned.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I say that is true only if s/he reads accurately. I&#39;ve listened to high<br/>
school graduates &quot;read,&quot; using their Whole Language &quot;training&quot; -- memorizing<br/>
&quot;shapes of words&quot; and guessing instead of phonetic decoding, and it is<br/>
painful to hear the mistakes caused by the inability to analyse words<br/>
phonetically. Unless a person knows the connection between letters and<br/>
sounds, they simply do not know how to read well.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, as you say, reading takes practice. But like other things, it<br/>
takes correct practice.</div>

to the person you&#39;re reading aloud to? Sometimes. Is it to understand the <br/>
content of what you&#39;re reading, whether for pleasure or whatever? Most times <br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
Reading aloud and reading to yourself for compehension are two very <br/>
different skills. Conor doesn&#39;t always get every word right when he tries to <br/>
decode aloud, most often when the words are out of context. But he can give <br/>
you the most minute detail of anything he has ever read to himself. And <br/>
phonics to this day, at age 13, will still screw him up. It&#39;s not worth it <br/>
for me, or him.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned, what I think caused my niece&#39;s reading disabilities was the intense <br/>
phonics instruction in her small private school. <br/>
<br/>
I think Whole Language was one of the best things that ever happened to <br/>
schools - it is as close to creating a print-rich, playful environment as <br/>
much like an unschooling home as they are going to probably get to in most <br/>
public schools. It is wrong to say &quot;Whole Language&quot; as if it is an <br/>
alternative to phonics instruction. Whole Language, as we experienced it <br/>
first-hand (and I was VERY interested in how it was implemented and how well <br/>
it worked and did a LOT of direct observation as well as lots of reading on <br/>
the subject) always included phonics information - especially in the form of <br/>
games, but also just in constant informal communication between kids and <br/>
teachers and, in small amounts, in direct instruction.<br/>
<br/>
My older two daughters went to school for a while. These are my two who <br/>
learned to read really really well BEFORE starting school (they were tested <br/>
at high school reading level in first grade - whatever the heck that really <br/>
means &lt;G&gt;), so they didn&#39;t learn to read there. But they were there and I was <br/>
there (a lot, as you can imagine).<br/>
<br/>
We were lucky that their schools were at that time very very much whole <br/>
language based and these were just absolutely marvelous stimulating <br/>
interesting alive classrooms - they were just filled to the brim with a <br/>
b&#39;zillion different things - including wonderful gorgeous picture books, <br/>
fantastic nonfiction books about animals, electrons, space, dinosaurs -- <br/>
anything and everything, building materials, a whole corner set up with <br/>
beanbag chairs and tape players and headphones with books on tape and the <br/>
books themselves. The walls were covered with beautiful posters. They had a <br/>
mail area - where each kid had their own little mailbox and they had all <br/>
kinds of lovely writing materials - pens and ink, markers, stickers, <br/>
stationary, stamps and stamp pads, etc. They could write to kids in their own <br/>
classroom or any other kid or teacher or administrator in the school. There <br/>
was mail pickup and delivery once a day. They had a piano and other musical <br/>
instruments - they had lots of tape players and tapes. They had counters with <br/>
lots of animals - and signs all around them telling interesting things about <br/>
them and printed instructions about their care. The kids took turns taking <br/>
them home - with the instructions. There were lots of games -- there were <br/>
boxes of card games that involved words, there were traditional kids&#39; games <br/>
like Monopoly, etc., and there were special phonics games - phonics Bingo was <br/>
very popular. There were art supplies and there was gardening inside and <br/>
outside - all these things had printed instructions and ideas and <br/>
information. There was reading-aloud time, there was drama - kids put on <br/>
short plays. The kids made up games - board games, card games.<br/>
<br/>
These kids learned to read because there was huge motivation and interest. <br/>
They had very little required work - each child had a file folder in a box <br/>
and the teacher would leave them notes, each day, about things they wanted <br/>
the child to choose to do, sometime throughout the day. Some would just be <br/>
suggestions - usually offered to get the child started - others would be <br/>
actual times that the teacher was going to do something with the child - it <br/>
might say, &quot;Come play Bingo with me at 11:15,&quot; for example. They had a page <br/>
in their file, for the week, that was a grid - different areas of the room <br/>
listed across the top and the days of the week down the left side. They would <br/>
color in the square if they spent time in a certain area on a certain day. So <br/>
if they spent time in the &quot;Writing Workshop Area&quot; on Tuesday - they&#39;d color <br/>
in the square on the grid corresponding to that. The teacher also kept an eye <br/>
on what the kids were doing and had a page for each kid in a notebook and, <br/>
throughout the day, jotted down her observations on post-it notes that she <br/>
stuck on her notebook and at the end of the day stuck onto each kids page for <br/>
that day. The kids grid and her postit notes were what she used to write the <br/>
narrative description of what the child had been working on and learning -  <br/>
that they used instead of any kind of grades or report cards.<br/>
<br/>
The kids who didn&#39;t seem to be learning - the ones the teachers thought <br/>
needed more direct instruction - were given that more direct instruction - <br/>
mostly by the teacher organizing groups of kids to play the more <br/>
phonics-based games or singing the songs or whatever, togethe. In these <br/>
classrooms - about 5 percent of kids didn&#39;t seem to be able to &quot;catch&quot; <br/>
reading by the time they were 9 or so. So they tried to identify who those <br/>
kids were likely to be and give them more direct help. But why put ALL the <br/>
kids through all that direct phonics instruction when they could be having <br/>
FUN and reading great stuff and just learning?<br/>
<br/>
I took my kids out of school when one was 9 and one was 6 - my third never <br/>
went. But thank GOODNESS while they were there they had whole language - <br/>
they&#39;d have been bored out of their minds without that. Whole Language let <br/>
them mostly work at their own chosen levels - mostly on things they were <br/>
interested in - within the constraints of what was available in the school, <br/>
of course.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned - I think most people think, still, that kids need direct instruction in <br/>
some systematic way, in phonics, before they will be able to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
You often sound like that is what you are promoting when you say kids have to <br/>
be taught phonics. <br/>
<br/>
Yes - our kids learn from us all the time - whether we want them to or not. <br/>
That&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
But fooling around &quot;for fun&quot; and answering questions and offering information <br/>
because a kid is interested - that is so different from deciding it is time <br/>
for a kid to learn to read and engaging in direct instruction of phonics <br/>
because the adult has decided it is time and that that is what the kid needs <br/>
to know and how they need to learn it. It just is not necessary - we&#39;ve seen <br/>
it over and over and over now - unschooled kids, raised in homes where <br/>
learning is inseperable from life and where books and other print materials <br/>
are engaging and a constant presence, just learn to read. Parents are <br/>
sometimes even astounded - one of mine learned really truly on her own <br/>
without me even seeing any signs that she was doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I did not teach my kids to read. <br/>
I helped them learn, though.<br/>
<br/>
We could (and have, ad nauseum) argued about whether helping someone learn is <br/>
the same as teaching --- the point here is that it is good to spend time <br/>
thinking about the distinction since it helps clarify the difference between <br/>
what is USUALLY thought of as teaching (adult decides what, when, how, and <br/>
where a kid should learn and gives direct instruction to the kid and assesses <br/>
whether or how much the kid has learned) vs unschooling (kid decides what, <br/>
when, how, and where to learn - or often just learns without even &quot;deciding&quot; <br/>
to do so - adult is there to encourage, support, offer information, ideas, <br/>
and resources).<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, I could write almost the exact same thing about arithmetic. In <br/>
fact, I&#39;m giving a couple of talks about that at the conference in August in <br/>
Sacramento.<br/>

That was part of the old &quot;Look-Say&quot; method - from my own early school days. I <br/>
never once saw a teacher, in a whole language classroom in the 1990&#39;s, do <br/>
that word shape thing where they have the kids outline the word, etc. And <br/>
whole language involves FAR more than the Dick and Jane style big books with <br/>
the teacher reading and pointing to words. That is why it was called &quot;WHOLE&quot; <br/>
language. Look-Say was boring - the books were silly and there was nothing to <br/>
do but watch and then try to read yourself. That was replaced with <br/>
incremental phonics instruction and that was boring too - the books had to <br/>
all be written so that they&#39;d lead in a nice little progressive systematic <br/>
way from one sound to another. Whole Language was a response to the boredom - <br/>
it relied on kids being interested in real literature - fiction, nonficiton, <br/>
poetry, drama, and utilitarian stuff - as opposed to contrived &quot;readers.&quot;  It <br/>
came from New Zealand which has one of the highest literacy rates in the <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Whole Language involved a number of &quot;strands&quot; - or what teachers like to call <br/>
&quot;word attack skills&quot; (Don&#39;t you HATE that expression?). Phonics was one of <br/>
the strands, in fact.<br/>
<br/>
Also - although it is just one of the strands, guessing IS a good word attack <br/>
skill - if there is a picture of a hat and there is a word that starts with <br/>
&quot;h&quot; and ends with &quot;t&quot; and you&#39;re not confident in your short-vowel sounds - <br/>
it makes much more sense to &quot;guess&quot; that the word is &quot;hat&quot; rather than &quot;hot&quot; <br/>
or &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;hut&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Guessing is another word for trial and error - which is one really good <br/>
learning technique. Nothing wrong with that. A few good guesses like that and <br/>
the kid will &quot;know&quot; that an &quot;a&quot; between two consonants usually has that <br/>
short-a sound.<br/>
<br/>
Whole Language is what unschoolers do in their homes. I don&#39;t think teachers <br/>
could keep it up effectively in classrooms. I was involved with some of the <br/>
very first introduction of it into schools - helping put on workshops by New <br/>
Zealand educators - and the teachers were very enthusiastic and just loved <br/>
it. But - it was exhausting - they had too many kids in too-small a space, <br/>
and they had to keep enough eye  on them all to be able to offer what they <br/>
might need and to be able to write accurate assessments. And - since kids <br/>
were able and allowed to learn at VERY different rates - some kids didn&#39;t <br/>
learn fast enough to satisfy the administrators or parents. <br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers we KNOW that it is okay - that kids do learn to read - some <br/>
very early and some very late and lots in between. Schools couldn&#39;t handle <br/>
that reality and whole language relied on giving kids much of the same <br/>
freedom - while promising that they&#39;d all learn to read on schedule. <br/>

I really enjoyed reading your post here.<br/>
While my kids were still in public school one of them had a teacher who<br/>
taught from a whole language approach. I got curious about what whole<br/>
language was and was somehow invited to join an email loop list for teachers<br/>
who used whole language. It was a great list with lots of fascinating<br/>
discussion. I learned a lot about learning. The teachers on that list talked<br/>
a lot about the things you covered in this post.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

  that reality and whole language relied on giving kids much of the same<br/>
  freedom - while promising that they&#39;d all learn to read on schedule.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388783467">Does New Zealand still recognize Sylvia Ashton-Warner and *her* contributions (ie, organic reading)?  (She did the bulk of her work in New Zealand and one disastrous stint in a Free School in the States).  I really liked her theories that children were often interested in sex and fear (a word like &quot;ambulance&quot; &quot;ghost&quot; &quot;knife&quot; or &quot;kiss&quot; was more likely to be important to them than &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;sit&quot;) and that simply giving them *their* words (written for each child on a card every day based on conversations they had, and not contrived conversations to extrapolate the word SHE wanted them to have) would stimulate in them a desire for more.  If the child did not recognize the word later, she reasoned it was not a word they really wanted and moved on to something else.  She got really great results!  Also, phonics is only the decoding part of reading.  I have worked a lot with people of all ages (from toddlers to 80 year olds) who are learning English as a second language, and while their &quot;decoding&quot; skills are excellent (ie, they can sound out most words competently), they often have very little &quot;comprehension&quot;.  That&#39;s where guessing based on context comes in.  It is just as valuable as phonics, and both are needed to read fluently -- it&#39;s the whole &quot;connotative as well as denotative&quot; thing.  Just my humble contribution.  I am finding this whole thing really interesting!    Debi<br/>

I used to make lists of words when they were little, like the names of all <br/>
the dogs in our neighborhood, or all the kids.  And once they recognized or <br/>
figured out what the list was it was elimination and multiple choice.  So <br/>
they could use whatever clues they wanted to. Sometimes it was just initial <br/>
letter.<br/>
<br/>
I remember with Kirby, listing all the characters in Teenage Mutant Ninja <br/>

It was just a game.  <br/>

I reply:<br/>
We don&#39;t now, as the whole language approach - as someone else <br/>
suggested, does not work in the classroom over a long period of time. We <br/>
now have hundreds  of illiterate children leaving school, and <br/>
Universities having to do pre-requisite classes in simple spelling, how <br/>
to write sentences etc. Virtually none of us homeschooling in this <br/>
country have had a good experience with our children being taught from <br/>
the whole language approach, and there has been mounting pressure to <br/>
return to a phonics based learning system - which thankfully, is <br/>
starting to happen again. Cheers, from SUZIE in NZ (New Zealand).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360114795">There are people on this email list who&#39;ve been writing and reading online at <br/>
the same places I have long enough to have read some of this the first time I <br/>
wrote about it, when it was happening, unlike now when it&#39;s mostly history <br/>
and reflection.<br/>
<br/>
My first child learned to read just after he started school. We played games, <br/>
answered questions, read together. I left love notes on his pillow and tucked <br/>
encouraging quips into his pockets. He copied his favorite book on the <br/>
typewriter, and learned to use whiteout. He went to school and he learned to <br/>
read and we gave them the credit for teaching him.<br/>
<br/>
My first unschooled child learned to read while I was researching how to <br/>
teach her to read. We played a lot of games - bought games, homemade games, <br/>
made up on the spot verbal games. I read aloud for hours while she looked at <br/>
the pages. She asked questions and I answered. I pointed out interesting <br/>
signs. She pointed out interesting signs. Her dad recorded tapes of him <br/>
reading her favorite bedtime books so she could listen to them while he was <br/>
away at sea. I wrote love notes to her and she wrote back. She copied her <br/>
favorite book on the computer (Commodore 64!). She labeled the house with my <br/>
help. She learned to read easily and we gave her the credit.<br/>
<br/>
My third unschooled child learned to read in much the same way his older <br/>
sister had. I read aloud for hours, but he didn&#39;t look at the pages very much <br/>
because he was usually rolling around on the floor. We played games, but not <br/>
as intensely as I had with his older sister. He asked questions and I <br/>
answered. He loved to help me make the shopping list, going through the <br/>
weekly ads looking for the best deals. He played phonics games on our new <br/>
Macintosh computer. He liked getting love notes but wasn&#39;t much interested in <br/>
writing his own back until much later. He spent months compulsively reading <br/>
aloud EVERY SINGLE sign we passed in our travels. He learned to read easily <br/>
and we gave him the credit.<br/>
<br/>
My fourth unschooled child learned to read unlike any of her siblings. In <br/>
spite of the fact that she intensely wanted to learn to read very young, and <br/>
the fact that we have a family culture that values games and word play, where <br/>
phonics awareness sometimes seems to permeate the very air, she had a very <br/>
hard time learning to read. She couldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; phonics. She was well over <br/>
eight years old before she understood rhyming. She had an awesome vocabulary <br/>
and precise pronunciation of the words in that vocabulary - and she was <br/>
utterly unable to break those words down into their constituent sounds. The <br/>
games that her siblings so enjoyed, frustrated her beyond measure. She tried <br/>
and tried and tried and still she couldn&#39;t get it. It was truly horrible for <br/>
a while when she was about five or six. Her twin, who she&#39;d been competing <br/>
with since they&#39;d been conceived, was learning to read without her! She would <br/>
insist on trying to read something, insist that I tell her when she made a <br/>
mistake and then collapse into a screaming heap of frustration when I <br/>
corrected her, or cry in great gasping sobs when I didn&#39;t correct her because <br/>
she knew she wasn&#39;t getting it. She&#39;d pull out one of our homemade reading <br/>
games and beg everyone in the house to play with her, running away in tears <br/>
after a few minutes because she was unable to &quot;get it.&quot; After many many weeks <br/>
of torture I finally took the drastic step of HIDING all the phonics and <br/>
reading materials in the house. I hid the games and the magnetic letters, the <br/>
easy reader books and the BOB books, our homemade letter strips and the tiles <br/>
and every single book she could even begin to imagine she might be able to <br/>
read. I stopped reading with her twin when she was around and I put the <br/>
computer games out of her reach. (Then I went online and whined about it all. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
I then set about gently persuading her that she simply wasn&#39;t ready yet to <br/>
learn to read, that she WOULD be ready someday and while we couldn&#39;t know <br/>
when that would be that it wouldn&#39;t be forever, and that since she had skills <br/>
and talents that her reading brother didn&#39;t have maybe they could share with <br/>
each other instead of competing. It wasn&#39;t an easy sell. And let me tell you, <br/>
if sheer will power could have done it she&#39;d have read earlier than any of my <br/>
children because she is one stubbornly persistent child and by gum she <br/>
desired it more strongly than any of them. I researched and considered and <br/>
worried and then decided that if she wasn&#39;t progressing at nine I&#39;d start <br/>
looking for outside help for her. I worried because almost all the stories <br/>
I&#39;d heard about late readers were about kids who hadn&#39;t WANTED to read until <br/>
they got older, who learned to read when they decided they were ready. I <br/>
hadn&#39;t ever read about a kid who was trying to read and not succeeding who <br/>
later learned to read without &quot;special education&quot;. And I&#39;d never heard of a <br/>
kid coming through &quot;special education&quot; who liked to read.<br/>
<br/>
So she wasn&#39;t reading at six and seven and eight and nine. She drew <br/>
increasingly fantastic scenes and labeled them with words she solicited from <br/>
us, sometimes written in perfect mirror imaging from right to left. (Nope, <br/>
she&#39;s not the leftie. &lt;g&gt;) She sometimes sat for an hour or more looking <br/>
through books, pretending to read. Not looking at pictures or recalling <br/>
previously read text, just playacting for herself that she was a grown up <br/>
reader - her favorite book to &quot;read&quot; for over a year was a pocket Bible, <br/>
densely packed minuscule text printed on tissue thin vellum. She &quot;wrote&quot; long <br/>
stories and kept a diary, all in long scribbles without so much as a single <br/>
real letter on the page. She went to the library once a week and brought home <br/>
stacks of books about whatever topic she was currently fascinated by, usually <br/>
some animal species. She looked through every book by herself over and over <br/>
and sometimes let me read them to her. She told people she loved reading, and <br/>
none of us pointed out that she wasn&#39;t reading. I tried not to worry that she <br/>
just couldn&#39;t remember sounds. Every few months she asked for Lessons, and <br/>
we&#39;d work together on sound combinations a little bit (mostly playing games) <br/>
several times a day for a week or so until the frustration grew again and <br/>
she&#39;d agree to wait some more. Always I watched (and worried a lot) to make <br/>
sure I wasn&#39;t ignoring some real problem, that it truly was just a matter of <br/>
time till her brain grew enough connections to allow her to learn to read. <br/>
Meanwhile she could read Mom, Dad, Sarah, Love, and very little else. She <br/>
couldn&#39;t even read STOP signs!<br/>
<br/>
At nine and a half she very suddenly started to &quot;get it&quot;. She was reading. <br/>
She was playing the games and usually getting it all right the first time. <br/>
She started reading fiction. The first book she read completely on her own <br/>
was agonizingly slow, half an hour or more per 3rd grade level page. She <br/>
didn&#39;t care. She was SO happy to be finally reading. I couldn&#39;t believe that <br/>
anyone could take that long to read so little and not be totally losing the <br/>
sense of the story, but darned if she wasn&#39;t able to narrate the book in <br/>
detail after finishing it. At ten she is this week reading a book published <br/>
for adults (Raptor Red) with full comprehension, slowly, but her speed is <br/>
picking up. Harry Potter is still elusive - he&#39;s come down off the shelf <br/>
several times now for a try out and been put back each time with a sigh. <br/>
<br/>
She had more intensive and focused phonics instruction than any of my other <br/>
children, and none of it was any use to her till her brain was ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
Had she been in school she&#39;d have been remediated and tested and special <br/>
grouped for the last three years. It&#39;s unlikely she&#39;d have been able to keep <br/>
thinking of herself as a reader long enough for her brain to catch up to her <br/>
desire. She would probably have learned to read about the same time, possibly <br/>
even later, but she wouldn&#39;t have cared about it anymore. She&#39;d have been <br/>
convinced of her stupidity long before that. <br/>
<br/>
This has gotten much longer than I intended when I started, and it&#39;s gotten <br/>
very late. Sorry. :)<br/>

in school is that the motive to reading is to get good reading grades, not<br/>
to glean information from the words.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Obviously, as you say, reading takes practice. But like other things, it<br/>
&gt; takes correct practice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When kids learn to read on their own, reading for their own purposes,<br/>
reading is self-correcting. They want to know how the story turns out or how<br/>
to get past a stuck place in a video game so they figure out what the words<br/>
are telling them. There isn&#39;t that motive when reading in school where kids<br/>
read what someone else tells them to read for someone else&#39;s purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So can we talk about not teaching/learning arithmetic? :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As someone said, it&#39;s the same process. Kids use math and get better at it<br/>
which allows them use it more and therefore get even better at it. They<br/>
learn how numbers work by &quot;seeing&quot; them work and messing around with them<br/>
and seeing them in appropriate contexts. Understanding comes from using and<br/>
seeing rather than the other way around as it is in school.<br/>
<br/>
Kids seem to often work at the fringe of understanding, pushing their<br/>
envelope.<br/>
<br/>
Though this isn&#39;t about math, it&#39;s about how people learn: There&#39;s a novel<br/>
where the narrator begins the story by proudly saying that the town clock<br/>
frequently told the correct time. Now Kathryn in 11 years has certainly<br/>
(frequently ;-) heard the word &quot;frequently&quot; but in order to get the joke she<br/>
needed to know exactly what it meant so she asked &quot;Does it mean all the time<br/>
or most of the time or ...?&quot; Obviously she&#39;s picked up from the context over<br/>
the years that frequently had to do with how often something happened but<br/>
she didn&#39;t know exactly.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually she would have developed a clearer idea of what frequently means<br/>
by hearing it used in various contexts. And she&#39;s undoubtedly full of words<br/>
with varying degrees of fuzzy definitions. (Me too!) (It also makes me<br/>
realize that though kids appear to understand what we&#39;re saying, they&#39;re<br/>
understanding can often be piecemeal with them filling in the gaps with best<br/>
guesses -- that may not always be right.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with math. Kathryn uses the concept of percetages correctly<br/>
more often than not now, not because she&#39;s been taught better (I haven&#39;t at<br/>
all) but because she&#39;s had more everyday exposure in ways that make sense to<br/>
her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392821749">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
In reply to the subject about reading, I have a 16 year old boy who is <br/>
finally doing okay with reading.  I am so glad that I never went to a <br/>
remedial therapist.  We were able to work everything out at home.  He can <br/>
write everything, but the spelling is wrong (though phonetically correct).<br/>
<br/>
Yet he has enjoyed and excelled in so many areas over the years.  Ski racing, <br/>
motocross racing, motorcycle mechanics, bmx bike racing, bicycle mechanics.  <br/>
We just used his interests to pursue anything that could make him grow.  We <br/>
bought a rototiller so he could plow up the backyard and build bicycle jumps. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He is now intensely interested in remote control airplanes, and flies them so <br/>
nicely.  The mechanics part of it fascinates him.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that what I appreciate with my son is that he takes the time to do <br/>
everything the right way, without wrecking it.<br/>
<br/>
Had I know then what I know now I just wouldn&#39;t have worried as much.<br/>
<br/>
Regards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97550111"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;She couldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; phonics. She was well over<br/>
&gt;eight years old before she understood rhyming.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds like Lars.  He still didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; rhyming when he was 12, <br/>
believe it or not.  That was the last time I tried to do any rhyming with <br/>
him, so I don&#39;t know if he gets it now at 14.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;She had an awesome vocabulary<br/>
&gt;and precise pronunciation of the words in that vocabulary - and she was<br/>
&gt;utterly unable to break those words down into their constituent sounds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, this is like Lars.  I read to him so much, lots of it way above his <br/>
&quot;grade level&quot;.  He could tell really wonderful stories.  I remember his <br/>
sister and brother in law being surprised because he used the word &quot;steed&quot; <br/>
in one of his dictated stories.  It didn&#39;t surprise me at all.  He was <br/>
right in the middle of his King Arthur phase at the time.  &lt;g&gt; His <br/>
vocabulary matched all the stuff I&#39;d been reading.  But he too couldn&#39;t <br/>
break words down into their parts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I worried because almost all the stories<br/>
&gt;I&#39;d heard about late readers were about kids who hadn&#39;t WANTED to read until<br/>
&gt;they got older, who learned to read when they decided they were ready. I<br/>
&gt;hadn&#39;t ever read about a kid who was trying to read and not succeeding who<br/>
&gt;later learned to read without &quot;special education&quot;. And I&#39;d never heard of a<br/>
&gt;kid coming through &quot;special education&quot; who liked to read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was the same fear I had with Lars, and the reason why I finally pushed <br/>
the phonics on him at 12.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This has gotten much longer than I intended when I started, and it&#39;s gotten<br/>
&gt;very late. Sorry. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But very interesting.  I wish I&#39;d read it before I pushed the phonics on Lars.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105427301"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In reply to the subject about reading, I have a 16 year old boy who is<br/>
&gt;finally doing okay with reading.  I am so glad that I never went to a<br/>
&gt;remedial therapist.  We were able to work everything out at home.  He can<br/>
&gt;write everything, but the spelling is wrong (though phonetically correct).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your boy sounds a lot like Lars.  Where are you?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He can read whatever he wants now, but it&#39;s *very* slow.  For that reason <br/>
he doesn&#39;t attempt novels yet.  I&#39;m collecting short story titles he might <br/>
like.  Suggestions accepted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yet he has enjoyed and excelled in so many areas over the years.  Ski racing,<br/>
&gt;motocross racing, motorcycle mechanics, bmx bike racing, bicycle mechanics.<br/>
&gt;We just used his interests to pursue anything that could make him grow.  We<br/>
&gt;bought a rototiller so he could plow up the backyard and build bicycle jumps.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lars would love it if we did this.  Luckily, there&#39;s lots of bush around <br/>
here, and his friends build all kinds of jumps and ramps for mountain <br/>
biking.  (Actually, I&#39;m glad I can&#39;t get to where they are.  I&#39;d probably <br/>
shut him down if I could see what he&#39;s actually attempting.  &lt;g&gt;  Some of <br/>
those ramps are apparently *way* off the ground.)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve really encouraged the biking and bike mechanic stuff.  That and team <br/>
sports (and more recently music and MP3&#39;s, are what his life revolves <br/>
around, and I&#39;m getting pretty good at recognizing all the learning that <br/>
goes on with them now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Whole Language involved a number of &quot;strands&quot; - or what teachers like to <br/>
&gt; call<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;word attack skills&quot; (Don&#39;t you HATE that expression?). Phonics was one of<br/>
&gt; &gt;the strands, in fact.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, in some places, Whole Language got pretty perverted, to the <br/>
&gt; point where teachers were not *allowed* to teach any phonics.  I wonder if <br/>
&gt; this could be where its bad rep came from.  The original idea seems pretty <br/>
&gt; good to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes -- there are people who always see the next &quot;thing&quot; as REPLACING what <br/>
came before it -- that is the history of education reform. And there were <br/>
teachers who really resented the whole whole-language, etc. approach - they <br/>
didn&#39;t want to work that hard, put that much thought into what was happening <br/>
in their classroom, develop that MUCH interesting stimulating stuff to do, <br/>
pay attention to each child individually and notice what each one was REALLY <br/>
doing. They just wanted to give out standard assignments and grade them and <br/>
be done with it. And, being resentful of having whole language forced on them <br/>
- they sabotaged it - they needed to prove it wouldn&#39;t really work. They were <br/>
right, of course. It was doomed from the start -- I feel really lucky my kids <br/>
got into some of the experimental first tries at it - with teachers who had <br/>
fallen in love with the idea and wanted, badly, to make it work. None of them <br/>
are doing it anymore - the return to the old kind of standardized testing and <br/>
the amount of huge time that is now required to be spent on systematic <br/>
phonics programs and back-to-basics math programs - usurped much of the time <br/>
they had for all the cool stuff they used to do. There were two of those <br/>
teachers who really stood out - I talked to both of them in the last 6 <br/>
months. One is out of teaching - is running a program for kids with reading <br/>
disabilities in which she uses whole-language ideas. The other is still there <br/>
- but very very discouraged about her career choice now.<br/>
<br/>
 I really do think that whole language and integrated curriculum and basing <br/>
everything on Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences was a HUGE step in the <br/>
right direction - in theory and in having a lot of beneficial side results. <br/>
However, in practice, in schools where kids are compelled to be there and <br/>
mostly confined to spending their time in their classroom with only the <br/>
resources available there and with 20 to 40 other kids and one adult, it <br/>
isn&#39;t reasonable to expect whole language/integrated curriculum/multiple <br/>
intelligence theory/authentic assessment, etc. to really work out all that <br/>
well. I think it made classrooms MUCH MUCH better places - in the sense that <br/>
the teachers who really put their heart into trying to do all that are <br/>
undoubtedly better teachers and their classrooms way way better places to <br/>
serve time in now. But I think it was way too much to expect from most <br/>
teachers and they either were just no good at it or didn&#39;t try or tried <br/>
really hard and burned out. AND - the level of chaos in most classrooms - <br/>
with 20 to 40 kids all &quot;doing their own thing&quot; and many of them coming to <br/>
school with major personal issues and not wanting to be there anyway and <br/>
needing WAY more outside big-play time and so on -- the idea that whole <br/>
language, etc., could &quot;work&quot; starts to kind of seem silly.<br/>
<br/>
WHole Earth Education  --- WHEE? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is what we do - gives away my age, of course, since it refers to the <br/>
Whole Earth Catalog (which actually still sort of exists as the Whole Earth <br/>
Review but isn&#39;t the mind-boggling exciting catalog of wonderful <br/>
stuff-of-all-kinds that opened our minds and expanded our consciousnesses in <br/>
the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s).<br/>
<br/>
Look at some of the terminology used here from the Whole Earth people - <br/>
doesn&#39;t it just WORK so well for how so many of us view what we are doing <br/>
instead of sending our kids to school?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Whole Earth is committed to a vision of what&#39;s needed to challenge <br/>
 </span></blockquote>ingrained patterns and stale assumptions. Curiosity. Exploration. <br/>
Independence. Community. Living fearlessly. Principles. Tools and ideas. <br/>
Whole Earth shows you ways to take back your power and put it to use. &lt;&lt;<br/>

  Thank you so much for taking the time to write the post about your <br/>
kids&#39; learning-to-read experiences.  I usually lurk here, but I had <br/>
to respond to your post.  I have a 9 year old daughter who doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to learn to read at all, and I&#39;m starting to panic - again!  She <br/>
seems to know all the letter sounds and a lot of the &quot;rules&quot; for <br/>
reading but it just hasn&#39;t clicked for her yet. My 7 year old <br/>
daughter is starting to read fairly well, but that doesn&#39;t seem to <br/>
bother the Kaitlin (my oldest).  <br/>
  I checked this group tonight for moral support and found it in your <br/>
post and in the rest of this thread as well.  I&#39;ll hang in there and <br/>
wait &#39;til she&#39;s ready.  Whenever I feel anxious about it again I&#39;ll <br/>
come to this group instead of pressuring Kaitlin.  Djuana</div>

I recommend Frank Smith&#39;s book, &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; as a <br/>
great way to get a good basic understanding of the most current understanding <br/>
by researchers about how people really learn. It is a good read and very very <br/>
supportive of an unschooling philosophy, even though he doesn&#39;t mention it in <br/>
the book. It can be a lot easier to feel confident in our decisions as <br/>
unschoolers when we have a sense that there is research backing up our <br/>
beliefs.  Frank Smith IS speaking at the HSC conference in August in <br/>
Sacramento, though, so if he did NOT know much about unschooling before, he&#39;s <br/>
going to get a crash-course that weekend. I SO hope to get a chance to talk <br/>
with him there!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-307480529">Hi, Pam --<br/>
<br/>
What you wrote is very much what I believe.  Seeing it spelled out so<br/>
clearly here is reassuring for me.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some stuff in one of Jane Healy&#39;s books about brain development<br/>
and handwriting that parallels what you said about the brain and<br/>
reading.  (I wish I could remember which book.  But the gist of it was<br/>
that until the brain structures that provide fine motor control for the<br/>
finger tips are developed, a child learning to handwrite will develop a<br/>
&quot;kludgey&quot; suboptimal brain wiring for writing.  It&#39;s better to wait.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thrilled that both Jane Healey and Frank Smith are going to speak at<br/>
the conference!  I&#39;m going to have to buy a bunch of tapes of the<br/>
conference sessions since I&#39;m pulled in three directions simultaneously<br/>
but am not triplets. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m really getting psyched!<br/>

Years ago on AOL I suggested instead of bumper stickers that say &quot;If you can <br/>
read this, thank a teacher,&quot; there should be some that say &quot;If you can&#39;t <br/>
stand to read this, blame a teacher.&quot;   (or some such--I had probably worded <br/>
it better).<br/>
<br/>
OH my gosh, some people went ballistic!<br/>
<br/>
And I had *been* a &quot;language arts&quot; teacher--not early grades, not reading, <br/>
but I knew to the bone the sadness in the eyes of hundreds of kids (from <br/>
which I could be assured there were millions) when they were (DAILY, in <br/>
school) pressured to show they could read, to show they could comprehend, to <br/>
read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
I would not be in the least surprised if it were considered common knowledge <br/>
someday that compulsory schooling caused all manner of psychological and <br/>
emotional carnage which was passed on widely within one&#39;s own time, and to <br/>
children and grandchildren.   <br/>
<br/>
But there was a time when most of the books and paper available to normal <br/>
people was at school buildings.  And the globes and the maps.  Only rich <br/>
people had such things.  Only interested and curious people have them now.  <br/>
