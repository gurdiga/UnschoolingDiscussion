<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Well, why am I not surprised.  Let us take this rather rambling complaint<br/>
&gt; issue by issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;This was not an issue.&quot;  Of course it was, it was the foundation of the<br/>
&gt; issue with the hubby, it was included (even though it was not necessary to<br/>
&gt; include it), therefore it became part of the issue.  Oh, before anyone<br/>
goes<br/>
&gt; off on &quot;yes it was,&quot; to test relevance one asks if one could get an answer<br/>
&gt; without given portions of a text.  In this case, it does not meet the<br/>
test.<br/>
&gt;  A simple &quot;DH and I have a difference of opinion on discipline issues.<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any suggestions on how to bring him around to less<br/>
&gt; controlling/forceful type of discipline&quot; would have gotten lots of<br/>
&gt; constructive suggestions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hmmm, &quot;shortsightedness.&quot;  Ye ol&#39; Funk and Wagnall deems that to be<br/>
&gt; &quot;nearsighted.&quot;  Well, I would certainly hope that a slam at folks who wear<br/>
&gt; glasses was not intended.  &quot;Lacking foresight (the act or power of<br/>
&gt; foreseeing).  Hey, then I certainly qualify as not being shortsighted!<br/>
Did<br/>
&gt; I not predict this %-}<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Lack of respect.&quot;  Hmmm, lack works.  On both sides!  Respect, as defined<br/>
&gt; by most dictionaries is:  To consider deserving of high regard.  O.K., I<br/>
&gt; can go with that since most folks don&#39;t consider spanking to be &quot;deserving<br/>
&gt; of high regard.&quot;  Now, I&#39;m not thinking that was meant literally and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking the old adage &quot;respect is earned&quot; was kinda forgotten here.  So<br/>
&gt; just as a btw, one does not have to respect the view of others, it isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; given.  One has a right to differing views, one has a right to voice them,<br/>
&gt; however one does not have a right to respect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Casting them out.&quot;  I&#39;m not thinking so.  In fact, sounds kinda silly to<br/>
&gt; even say it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Shoving opinions down throats.&quot;  More exaggeration for arguments sake.<br/>
&gt; Poor debating style as use of the delete key was already mentioned several<br/>
&gt; times.  Thus, since one is not required to read what one does not agree<br/>
&gt; with the potential to shove an opinion down someone&#39;s throat is<br/>
&gt; non-existant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Remove from the list.&quot;  Again, sounds like one of my kids in a snit.  I<br/>
&gt; have yet to see anyone&#39;s remarks even vaguely resemble a threat or<br/>
&gt; suggestion of removal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Sounds pretty ps&quot; -- well, now if that ain&#39;t the pot calling the kettle<br/>
&gt; black. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Oh, and by the way . . .&quot; hehehe, oops sorry, but this is so neener,<br/>
&gt; neener, neener that I simply had to take a giggle break.  16 yo son was<br/>
&gt; reading it over my shoulder and agreed that the maturity level was what he<br/>
&gt; would expect from his ps friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not wanting to be accused of &quot;incorrectness&quot; (not agreeing with fact or<br/>
&gt; truth), it should be noted that &quot;all mighty&quot; is one word and has only one<br/>
&gt; &quot;L&quot;, and if we had &quot;absolute power over all&quot; or  were &quot;unlimited in<br/>
power,&quot;<br/>
&gt; then our correctness (conformance to conventional standards) would mean<br/>
&gt; that folks would change and give up pi behaviors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lynda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  I have friends who spank.  We argue about it all the time.  So, I<br/>
&gt; asked them about this e-mail (they asked to see the beginning of this<br/>
&gt; little bruhaha) and the concensus was that most spankers have more sense<br/>
&gt; (survival instincts one friend called it) than to make statements that are<br/>
&gt; graphicly descriptive of their spanking methods as they know (and they<br/>
&gt; thought all spankers knew since it is continually in the news) that folks<br/>
&gt; will come down on them like a ton of bricks.  Nan said, and I quote, &quot;the<br/>
&gt; description wasn&#39;t necessary to the content and she could have gotten the<br/>
&gt; advise she supposedly wanted without describing hitting her child.  I<br/>
&gt; wonder if it was done to cause a stir.&quot;  Now there&#39;s food for thought.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.S.  As to the other e-mail, &quot;doesn&#39;t mean you have thier knowledge.&quot;<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; AM one of those mandated reporters, therefore the knowledge is first hand.<br/>
&gt; I mentioned others because certain parties obviously wouldn&#39;t believe a<br/>
&gt; word I say. </span></blockquote></div>

&gt; The kidlets have a box of games that are small handheld things that are<br/>
&gt; magnetic.  Also in the box are tablets, word search games, colored<br/>
pencils,<br/>
&gt; tapes (some are books on tape, some music).  Then they play the alphabet<br/>
&gt; game (each in succesion has to spot something with a starting letter of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; alphabet beginning with A) and the car license plate game (both how many<br/>
&gt; states can you find and the alphabet game then number game with license<br/>
&gt; plates--first plate has to begin with A, next plate with AB, next with<br/>
ABC,<br/>
&gt; next with ABC 1, etc.).  Then they look for particular kinds of cars to<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; if they can find one from each manufacturer.  Then hard to find colors in<br/>
&gt; cars (orange, lavender, purple, baby blue, etc.).  They take binoculars<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; do bird watching, noting the different kinds they find.  They also take a<br/>
&gt; new book to read and an old favorite for when they get bored with<br/>
&gt; everything else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935766248">Thanks, Julie, I did  *grin*  5 hours solo with 2 little&#39;uns?  hmm.  <br/>
tricky.  But then, they&#39;re at an age where they might sleep a lot <br/>
still, if you can set off early in the morning or close to their <br/>
bedtime that might help.  We did a 6hr trip when Abi was 6mo, <br/>
set off with &#39;em both in their jammies, they slept for most of the <br/>
trip, and we arrived about 2pm, which was nice.  I did practically <br/>
the same trip last year, me with my 2 kids and 2 teenage girls I&#39;d <br/>
never met before, to go camping at a home-ed festival.  Now that <br/>
was fun!!  I&#39;m not giving you much in the way of ideas here, am <br/>
I?  Enough story-tapes that you&#39;re not going to get driven nuts by <br/>
the same thing.  Oh, and LOTS to eat.  My mum has a thing <br/>
about giving children food in cars, she worries about choking.  But <br/>
it&#39;s that or you crash the car from distraction from tetchy kids, so <br/>
what do you do?  Let go of worry, I say!!  Oh, and here&#39;s a story. <br/>
2 years ago, I went on holiday with my mum cos dh couldn&#39;t take <br/>
the time off.  He drove the kids up, though and came to pick us up <br/>
the following weekend, cos Mum&#39;s car was smaller than ours and <br/>
we weren&#39;t travelling light.  By the time we got about ten miles <br/>
from our destination (out of 80 or so) the kids were both bawling <br/>
their eyes out and dh was really fed-up.  Trying to stay cheerful, <br/>
he saw some sheep, and went &#39;Sheep!  Baaaaaaa!!!!!&#39;  to which <br/>
Heather replied &#39;oh, Daddy, no more sheep!!!&#39;  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck with your trip!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680816177">How old are the kidlets? My sister just drove from WA to OH and said that <br/>
her kids were getting into Harry Potter on tape. Hers are 5 and 7. She also <br/>
said the vcr was a life saver!<br/>
<br/>
We like to play our ABC game-take turns finding things that begin with each <br/>
letter. We like trivia-we have used books, trivial pursuit cards,  and <br/>
pamphlets that you pick up as you travel-we read them aloud and it always <br/>
strikes up some interesting conversations.<br/>
<br/>
We delivered some boxes of old homeschool junk from one family to another, <br/>
on its way to the Home School Resource Center and got first chance to dig <br/>
through the stuff. The boys found some magnetic games like the IQ games at <br/>
some restaurants that they have played over and over trying to beat <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
They also found a car bingo game you could easily make. It has pictures of <br/>
different things you see along the road-a fence, a horse, a cow, a bridge, <br/>
etc...Each card has the same pictures but in different layout. You cover <br/>
each one with a magnet as you spot the things. I&#39;d probably do it with dry <br/>
erase markers or those bingo markers. If you were going to a city you could <br/>
even take pictures out of a brochure to make the cards-see who spots the <br/>
arch or the flood walls of St. Louis, for example.<br/>
<br/>
I like this topic much better.<br/>

My little ones have been traveling for years now.   When dd was 2 weeks old, <br/>
we drove from Nashville to Maryland.  We have also driven to Texas  from <br/>
Maryland and back twice!!  We try to time it so that they sleep a lot.  My <br/>
aunt got me this great book 365 travel games and activities.  Some of the <br/>
ones I like include Radio drawing where the kids listen to the radio and draw <br/>
what they think the music looks like - what instruments they hear, is the <br/>
music loud, soft, fast slow happy , sad, etc.<br/>
Just Imagine - where the kids talk about what they would do IF : you grew <br/>
wings overnight, you could see in the dark, you had four arms instead of two, <br/>
you were giant, small, etc., there are several word games but I couldn&#39;t <br/>
remember your little ones ages.  Feel free to email me offlist and I can give <br/>
you more info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486935827">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
We used to travel from the Washington, DC burbs to Texas fairly frequently.<br/>
First trip was when Abby was under 1 and Lori was 3.  Have done it several<br/>
times since then.  They are now 15 and 19.  Anyway, I used to prepare a<br/>
goodie bag for each one.  You know the neat shopping bag type totes.  Well<br/>
they come in several sizes -- will accommodate whatever goodies need to fit<br/>
within! Right now I can&#39;t remember the ages of your kidlets.  BUT here are a<br/>
few suggestions for filling the bags: Depending upon age-- markers,<br/>
crayolas, coloring pencils, etc.  and lots of cool colored paper of various<br/>
types (colored note pads, stationary, coloring pages) sketch books,<br/>
journals, fill in the blank silly fun books (mad libs, I think they are<br/>
called that),  OR the neat write and erase boards that RoseArt has out under<br/>
10 bucks at Walmart and well work it).  Next everybody needs a good book!<br/>
If you have babies -- the chewable kind will work or hardboard for the<br/>
somewhat older babies.  Baby could probably use a new toy--teddy bear so<br/>
something like that.  They also need travel games.  Another fun thing to<br/>
include is the Rand McNally Kid maps with cool activities and facts about<br/>
the areas where they will be traveling through and to!  The biggy is treats!<br/>
Include fruit, a special treat (candy bar or favorite granola bar), etc.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure everyone gets a separate bag of their own.  They should be<br/>
distinctly *Built* for the recipient.  One way to prevent squabbles about<br/>
who gets which bag is to pick out bags based upon favorite colors, hobbies,<br/>
or cartoon type characters.  You might want to tie a cute curly ribbon on<br/>
each one and make it seem like a really special present for the trip.  You<br/>
can even stress that the presents are a reward because you *just know* that<br/>
everyone is going to be on their best behavior!<br/>
<br/>
The Wee Sing and Play tapes and the Are We There Yet tapes can be fun for<br/>
awhile--if you set a limit on the time that they can be played!  The old<br/>
license plates game and the A to Z letters game (found on signs along the<br/>
roadway) are also fun for a limited amount of time!<br/>
<br/>
Pack a cooler full of juice, water, or whatever suits your fancy and DON&quot;T<br/>
sweat the small stuff like spills in the car.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all --- just enjoy your time with the kids!<br/>
<br/>

haven&#39;t done any long car trips with my three kids, but I&#39;ve done the 24 hour 
flight from NY to Singapore many times (my three are 3,3, and 4m).&nbsp; About 
the most popular thing is a big snack box.&nbsp; Each kid gets their own one, 
and I put a HUGE variety of stuff in it - two each of a variety of cookies, 
little raisin boxes, pieces of other dried fruit, little boxes of dry 
cereal&nbsp;(I save all those little individual serving raisin boxes and fill 
them with cheerios, rice krispies, etc.), mini rice cakes - anything that can be 
easily cleaned up:)&nbsp; This keeps them busy for ages sorting through their 
box and picking out the next snack.&nbsp; </span></font></div>
<div><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="ygrps-yiv-409248220830531501-06092000">Mini 
magnet boards and magna doodles keep them busy a while too, as does a bag of 
colored pipe cleaners.&nbsp; Those party favor size tubs of play doh combined 
with a heavy duty board book (they put the play doh on the book to &quot;change&quot; the 
story - delete or add characters/objects) fill up some time too.&nbsp; I also 
bring beads and thread to make necklaces.&nbsp; BTW I find that putting each 
activity in a separate Ziploc bag works well, and each kid puts the activity 
back in the bag when they&#39;re done so it&#39;s ready for the next person.&nbsp; My 
son lately insists on bringing his binoculars with him on all trips, and they 
keep him busy, although sometimes my older daughter gets upset if he can see 
something she can&#39;t.&nbsp; I your kids aren&#39;t the sort to put stuff near their 
faces, then a styrofoam block with a collection of golf tees to stick in it also 
passes time, although it can make a big mess!</span></font></div>

live in Fairfax, is that anywhere near you?  We&#39;d love to go over <br/>
and visit &#39;em, but I kind-of wonder if I&#39;d go nuts, since their life is <br/>
so opposite ours (bil&#39;s wife went back to work within weeks of <br/>
birth, as standard, and justified it by saying that they daycare <br/>
people would be better at it than her, as if that makes a <br/>
difference, babies need mothers!!!!!!, but I digress, as usual...)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933726880">Here&#39;s something that was a hit on our car trip earlier this summer:  Crayola <br/>
has a new product called Mess Free Color Wonder.  I don&#39;t know if any other <br/>
companies are copying it.  The markers only work on special paper, and don&#39;t <br/>
mark clothes or car upholstery.  I bought the basic kit, which is a coloring <br/>
book and 6 markers in a little mesh bag that attaches to the coloring book.  <br/>
I also bought a pad of the special blank paper. <br/>
<br/>
Everything comes in a sealed package decked out with the familiar green and <br/>
yellow Crayola design.  I bought them at Target, and they weren&#39;t expensive <br/>
as I recall.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I didn&#39;t like is that the coloring book is designed so that <br/>
you can&#39;t color outside the lines.  The color only shows up inside the lines. <br/>
 That may be fine for my 3 year old, but my 7 year old wanted to use a little <br/>
more imagination!  But the blank pad had no such limitations.  Despite the <br/>
little restriction, they had a lot of fun with these.<br/>

put two colours of paint in a sealed-up bag (good, strong ziploc <br/>
