<div id="ygrps-yiv-592815271">I seldom encourage folks to go out and buy a book, but this is truly <br/>
an exception, one that most home educators would want on their <br/>
bookshelves. I had to order this through inter-library loan <br/>
resources, but am now going to buy it. In a nutshell, Steve Voeller <br/>
has done a great job putting together all the long-time available <br/>
options that most folks never pay attention to, to allow self-<br/>
determined learners to put together a college degree without ever <br/>
entering a classroom or taking a single course. No kidding!  Not that <br/>
I am advocating that everyone needs or should get a college degree, <br/>
but for those who want one, this book opens dozens of glorious doors, <br/>
detailing options that will save lots of time and money, especially <br/>
for motivated self-determined learners.<br/>
<br/>
Just for one example he points out in chapter 3, page 32, that &quot;some <br/>
students have completed their entire degree by just taking three GRE <br/>
[Graduate Records Exams] and five general CLEP exams. Using this <br/>
method, you could theoretically complete your entire bachelor&#39;s <br/>
degree within a few days! If you&#39;re interested in this method, <br/>
contact Excelsior College. They&#39;ve prepared a list of textbooks for <br/>
each test and a practice sheet that includes sample questions as well <br/>
as a description of the examination&#39;s content. You can find these at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.excelsior.edu">http://www.excelsior.edu</a> To receive the official GRE study <br/>
materials and more information contact: GRE-ETS, P. O. Box 6000, <br/>
Princeton, NJ 08541-6000, 609/771-7906, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gre.org">http://www.gre.org</a> &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Voeller does clearly state that these GRE tests are not easy and that <br/>
students should study and prepare very well before taking them.  <br/>
Still at only $130 each for the GRE exams, and only $46 each plus <br/>
another $10-$15 for the test registration center&#39;s fee for the CLEP <br/>
exams, one could theoretically get a four year accredited college <br/>
degree for less than $1500 in only as long as it takes to study for <br/>
these tests and take them. Wow! <br/>
<br/>
Surely this is an option suitable for many who would rather spend <br/>
their lives &quot;being&quot; and &quot;doing&quot; something rather than &quot;becoming,&quot; and <br/>
paying a great deal of money, spending a great deal of time, for the <br/>
privilege of &quot;becoming.&quot; All the options he lists would also be <br/>
suitable for adults who never finished college and decide to complete <br/>
their college degree. Or for those who decide to start late in life <br/>
and who could benefit greatly by saving years and years and thousands <br/>
of dollars they might otherwise spend on their families and their <br/>
lives. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, he clearly spells out all the other options available <br/>
for getting college credit without going to or enrolling in a class, <br/>
which include: CLEP exams, Excelsior College exams, DANTES Subject <br/>
Standardized Tests (DSSTs), Thomas Edison College Exam Programs <br/>
(TECEP), our own Ohio University correspondences courses (60 of which <br/>
can be taken on a credit-by-examination basis), the New York <br/>
University Foreign Language Testing Program, AP Exams, and the <br/>
Graduate Record Exams.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing he spells out the how-tos of portfolio assessment for <br/>
college course credit, another easy way to get credit for experience, <br/>
giving step-by-step instructions on how to put together a well-<br/>
constructed portfolio for any course. Then he goes on to explain how <br/>
to get credit for portfolio assessment even if the college you are <br/>
attending does not grant this type of credit. <br/>
<br/>
Following this he details how to use internships, exisiting <br/>
internship programs or by designing your own internships, for college <br/>
credit.  Then he provides lots of detailed information on online and <br/>
correspondence courses for college credit, independent study and <br/>
community college resources, general online study resources, and <br/>
that&#39;s only the first one-third of this excellent book! The last two-<br/>
thirds of this book are excellent resources on how to increase your <br/>
learning capacity, how to speed up the learning process while <br/>
increasing comprehension, how to cut study time by 50%, especially <br/>
for the types of tests and exams that these techniques require, a <br/>
wealth of study enhancing information.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend that every home educator, especially those who do <br/>
not buy into the huge mega billion dollar industry that is higher <br/>
education in this country, those who have learned that quality <br/>
education does not take place only in classrooms, spend the meager <br/>
$19.99 for this book. Or order it from your library and see for <br/>
yourself. It is a goldmine of time and money-saving information, <br/>
offering many alternatives to the independent learner, to anyone who <br/>
chooses to be resourceful rather than to follow traditional <br/>
educational dictates. With today&#39;s economy this book would pay for <br/>
itself in one CLEP exam&#39;s college credit, or one portfolio assessment <br/>
for course credit. What do you have to lose?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777652888">Book Review:  Accelerated Distance Learning:  The New Way To Earn <br/>
Your College Degree In The Twenty-first Century<br/>
<br/>
Someone emailed me that I made a mistake.  The author of this book is <br/>
*Brad* Voeller, not Steve.  That&#39;s what I get for typing in a hurry <br/>
as I am dashing out the door.  Also, from some of the email I <br/>
received I wanted to clarify that this book is NOT about online <br/>
learning, or correspondence courses.  This books lists dozens of ways <br/>
to use a variety of methods that have been around for some time to <br/>
accelerate getting a degree.  The most amazing one is to take three <br/>
GREs at $130 each and five CLEP exams at $46 + $10-$15 each in fees, <br/>
and come out with a full four-year accredited degree for under $700 <br/>
and with very little time invested.  Well, books needed to study for <br/>
the tests would be extra, so let&#39;s say for under $1000, max. <br/>
Whoopee!!!  This book gives plenty of detailed info on a wide variety <br/>
of ways to get a very good degree for a fraction of the time and <br/>
money most people invest.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone else emailed that they found this book on Amazon for $14.00 <br/>
instead of $19.99, with free shipping for orders of $25+.  An even <br/>
better deal<br/>

<br/>
Yes, thanks.  I got an email correcting that right away.  I posted <br/>
the correction a little bit later.  That&#39;s what I get for trying to <br/>
finish up that post, literally typing as I was running out the door.  <br/>
But *Brad* Voeller&#39;s book is a steal and well-worth investigating any <br/>
way you can get your hands on it.  I still have the Center For <br/>
Creative Leadership&#39;s copy through inter-library loan.  But I have <br/>
already ordered it from Amazon at $14.  It&#39;s one of those win/win <br/>
books if you think anyone in your family will be going for a college <br/>
degree.<br/>

Thanks. This is a great price!  Glad I haven&#39;t placed my order yet.<br/>
I think the title of this book kind of puts people off, almost <br/>
misleads them, but the information inside is fantastic, especially <br/>
for self-directed learners.  I&#39;m glad I got past the title to plow <br/>
through the inside of this phenomonal book.<br/>
