<div id="ygrps-yiv-300837729">My all time favorite show to watch with my son is &quot;spoungebob&quot; I <br/>
love that show - it&#39;s a riot !!!! That is one of my favorite things <br/>
to do because snuggling is great with hot cocoa or popcorn :)<br/>
<br/>
I use to be one of those moms that didn&#39;t like certain shows and one <br/>
of those shows was Rug rats because they didn&#39;t speak correctly. I <br/>
would let my son watch it but I would tell him the part that bugged <br/>
me. I don&#39;t worry about my son talking like them anymore so I kid <br/>
around about the show and talk like them and it drives my son crazy <br/>
LOL.................................................<br/>
<br/>
I think the dialogue with them is real important. If I am doing <br/>
other things my son always runs where I am to tell me the funny part <br/>
of what is happening. I get such a kick out of it :)<br/>
