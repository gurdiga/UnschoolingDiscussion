<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037540357"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sognokids@...">sognokids@...</a> <br/>
&gt;   &lt;&lt;Am I the only one who is mourning the departure of Steve <br/>
&gt; from Blue&#39;s clues?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. Count me in. But I am giving Joe a bit of time. I am hoping that as he gets<br/>
more comfortable he will get more natural. Have any of you seen some of the earlier<br/>
Steve episodes? He was very overly eager and everything was *so exciting*. Kind of<br/>
funny. But he settled in too.<br/>
<br/>
I remember Jason and his best friend (both 5 at the time) debating the Steve vs<br/>
Joe one time...it was so cute to listen to. Their consensus was that they liked<br/>
Steve. Kyle did not start watching it until after Joe was the main guy but still<br/>
prefers the Steve ones.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are so different...Jason used to watch it and just soak it up. Not much interaction.<br/>
Kyle on the other hand yells out answers, dances, draws in his notebook and then wants<br/>
to do whatever they were doing on the show. So cute....<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if Steve or Donovan are married or have girl friends? I always wonder<br/>
if their wives/sig others get a kick out of &quot;doing it&quot; with the Blues Clues guy! LOL!<br/>
OK, I admit I am a little weird and for some reason find Steve strangely attractive...<br/>

Guess I&#39;m weird with you then. When I commented on not liking Joe and missing Steve, I was going to comment on the weird attraction thing. Then I thought better of it!!! I&#39;ve actually talked about this with a few other women here and they feel the same way. LOL!!! What is it about that goofy little guy???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-825981868">Well, Joe is younger and technically better looking.  But the difference<br/>
is this: Joe seems like someone who hopes he looks sweet and innocent<br/>
for the camera.  Steve seems like someone who really is sweet but wishes<br/>
it didn&#39;t show so much. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, Steve is special for us because my husband and I started watching<br/>
Blue&#39;s Clues when our first son was born, before he was even old enough<br/>
to focus on the screen, because we wondered what it was about, and what<br/>
kids were about.  We&#39;ve watched it every single day since.  Blue&#39;s Clues<br/>
with Steve Burns will always remind me of those early days of parenting<br/>
when my husband and I had no idea what to do, but we just hoped we were<br/>
doing it right.  He has been a fixture in our home for five years.  We<br/>
have all the videos and we were pretty upset last weekend when one<br/>
finally wore out.  It&#39;s one of the first ones, and I&#39;m not sure it can<br/>
be replaced.  Joe&#39;s okay for a host of a kids&#39; show, but he&#39;ll never<br/>
mean as much to us as Steve.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course, my kids both love Joe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016281996">Add me to the list of those that have a thing for Steve.  If you are <br/>
interested in what he is up to now, here is his webpage: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.steveswebpage.com/">http://www.steveswebpage.com/</a>  He is working on an album for adults.  <br/>
I would suggest downloading some of the songs, they are actually <br/>
quite good.  I may even buy the album when it comes out.  I miss <br/>
Steve very much.<br/>
