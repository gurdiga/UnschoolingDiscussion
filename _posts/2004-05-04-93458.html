<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126430798">We were playing a game this afternoon called Trivia Adventure where you<br/>
answer trivia questions and make your way around the board to reach each<br/>
planet in the solar system.   Lilly (7) was asked &quot;Which of your organs<br/>
pumps blood through your body?&quot;  Her answer....&quot;Uranus.&quot;  Followed by peals<br/>
of laughter!    Ahh ha ha !!    Hey, it was a planet related game, after<br/>
all.  The next funny one was...&quot;If fish swim in a school, then whales swim<br/>
in a ?&quot;  Funny answer from my 9 yo, &#39;A college, of course!&quot;  They were too<br/>
cute not to share.<br/>
