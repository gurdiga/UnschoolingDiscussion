I&#39;ve talked about it for years, dh thinks I&#39;m nuts. Did it twice as a kid and <br/>
had a great time though.  If I have a better car in a couple of years I just <br/>
might do it!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

I would also like to drive up there,   it would be a beautiful drive!<br/>
 <br/>
We know lots of people from here in MN,  that go up there in July/August,  (they have to get away from the heat!)  Yeah,  I know, we don&#39;t know heat.   But they go up there for the great fishing.   <br/>
 <br/>
Its on my list of places to go.<br/>
