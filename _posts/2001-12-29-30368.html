I think Mark is right, Helen. My sister won&#39;t go on her trips unless a certain pilot is on board because of her lack of confidence in the entire industry from first hand experience( with both security and pilots as well!). <br/>
Makes me think a train trip sounds better and better.<br/>

Here&#39;s another story that I thought I&#39;d share - it could be an &#39;urban <br/>
legend&#39; (the source is my mom, but yah know, TRUST NO ONE! *smile*<br/>
<br/>
It comes from one of her customers at her restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
A doctor that travels is one of her clients. She hadn&#39;t seen him for <br/>
sometime, and when he showed up this month this is what he had to say.<br/>
<br/>
He lives in the boston area and the last time he had a trip planned was <br/>
on 911.<br/>
<br/>
As he sat in the waiting area he noticed a group of arab men cahorting <br/>
and having fun. The reason that he noticed them is the fact they were <br/>
laughing and joking around and enjoying themselves.<br/>
<br/>
When they boarded the plane, he noticed that they all sat in seperate <br/>
corners. And he thought it was odd.<br/>
<br/>
He told the stewardess and she answered him saying someting about not <br/>
being able to make people talk to eachother. <br/>
<br/>
He said that he really thought something was up and told her to do <br/>
something. Again she declined.<br/>
<br/>
He got off the plane, and then they had to retrieve his luggage (a law <br/>
about allowed to leave people&#39;s luggage without them).<br/>
<br/>
That was one of the planes that hit the towers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose this can be verified if someone got off the plane...</div>

 <br/>
Yes, it could be verified if someone wanted to check up on it. They keep a record of all that stuff.<br/>
Over the holidays, the news kept flashing that shot of the guy arrested for attempting to blow up a Paris flight. I asked dsister how she would have reacted if she had seen him on one of her flights. (I know this gets into discrimination... I call it instinct). She said she would have viewed him with great suspicion and never hesitates to let the pilots know of suspicious looking people on her flights.  I mean, wouldn&#39;t *you* (collective &#39;you&#39;) have been a little leary of that guy? <br/>
She (my sister) has some &#39;war stories&#39; that are pretty scary but I won&#39;t go into them now.  Just thought I should warn parents that a possible search/patdown could be in your or your childs&#39; future.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol! I&#39;m testing them, too ;-). The holidays bring out the chatterbox in me, I guess. Since I can&#39;t seem to relate too well with my family, well, I turn to my &#39;second&#39; family... unschoolers on the net!<br/>
