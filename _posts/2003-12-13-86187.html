college on through grad school.-=-<br/>
***************************<br/>
<br/>
My point was that Julian, at 14, is taking a course at Harvard Extension, and <br/>
that he had to write papers. This is a very challenging course, for college <br/>
credit, and no one else in the class is under 21. The last paper was an <br/>
argument paper, 5-7 pages long.<br/>
<br/>
Julian has never been a writer. Before this class, he has never written an <br/>
argument paper. We&#39;ve certainly used this to coach him in how to do it, but he <br/>
has done well-- he got a B+, as I mentioned. He DIDN&#39;T have to write countless <br/>
papers before to do well. He was willing to do this one because he really <br/>
cares about the topic of the course. <br/>
<br/>
These are skills you have to learn, but it doesn&#39;t have to be in the context <br/>
of writing lots of essays just for the sake of writing them.<br/>
