&gt; Albino redwood trees?  Where?  I assume you&#39;re in California somewhere.  I<br/>
&gt; never heard of such a thing all those years I grew up there.<br/>

25 years and I never heard of them either.  Somehow they mutate and have<br/>
white needles - they can grow to about 20 feet high in part of a nursery<br/>
ring - that ring of little trees that pop up when a big, old one dies.<br/>
I saw two at Henry Cowell State Park and a friend says there are some <br/>
at Big Basin.  Fred, our nature walk leader, says that there is a network<br/>
of people who know where they are but since some people have come along<br/>
and destroyed the trees, their locations are only given to people who<br/>
can be trusted to keep them safe.  I don&#39;t know if this is a recent<br/>
phenomena or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cool.  If you ever get pictures of them, I&#39;d love to see them.  I doubt <br/>
I&#39;ll ever get down to actually see them in the flesh, so to speak.  I&#39;ve <br/>
wanted to go down for a visit for a long time, but have never had the money <br/>
to do it right.  (The last time I was down was over 20 years ago when my <br/>
grandmother died, and I had no car to get to my favorite old haunts.)<br/>
<br/>
So do they only grow to about 20 feet and then die or what?<br/>
