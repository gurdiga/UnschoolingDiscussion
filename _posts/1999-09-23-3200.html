<div id="ygrps-yiv-1492518511">We are in the same situation!� As I type this it is 12:44 am and dd is watching a<br/>
video and hubby is asleep.� We are in dire need of grown-up time, but it is so<br/>
difficult.� We have been using the family bed for almost 5 years now.� Dd has been in<br/>
our bed since she was just a little over a year.� I can really relate to decompressing<br/>
time, I have to have it.� No matter how much I explain it to dh, he thinks I am just<br/>
ignoring him.� He forgets his day is filled with grown-up things, mine is not!� It is<br/>
the same 24/7 for me, not that I want to do the grown-up thing, but once you are<br/>
focused on one mind set you just don&#39;t push a button to change gears.� I have tried to<br/>
include him in our daily escapades and I just get the look!� LOL.� I have told him<br/>
there are things you could do when you get home, to give me my decompressing time, so<br/>
there is time and energy later for grown-up things.� He tries them once and if it is<br/>
not successful the first time it is the last time.� It so hard to be the one that is<br/>
supposed to take care of all the arrangements in the household so then when it doesn&#39;t<br/>
go as planned you get all the blame.� None of the credit when it runs smoothly (lol),<br/>
and all of the blame when it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
When someone gets a solution to this and all other life&#39;s problem, let us all know!<br/>
Thanks for letting me vent and it gives me great comfort to know I am not the only one<br/>
with the ailment.<br/>
