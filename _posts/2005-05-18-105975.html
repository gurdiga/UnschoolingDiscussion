<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710105322">Hello my name is Ann and I have been reading this list for about a <br/>
month.  I appreciate this wealth of information and  I enjoy it so <br/>
much.  I  feel as if I&#39;m drinking in water after being in the desert or <br/>
something.  I&#39;m not sure of the parameters of posting.  Thought I&#39;d <br/>
introduce myself and my family.  My significant other, and I are <br/>
parents to three amazing children, boys 12 and our daughter is 10.  <br/>
We&#39;ve been homeschooling for just over two years so very new to it all, <br/>
still.  I began school at home with a curriculum which I could tell <br/>
immediately was ridiculous but I continued in part to appease my <br/>
partner and family/friends etc, and probably to cover all the bases in <br/>
my own mind, too.   (we have many friends who are teachers and my s.o. <br/>
is a professor). Reading, and thinking about unschooling ;makes so much <br/>
sense to me.  I feel as if I&#39;m  a bit alone in it, though.  I&#39;m kind of <br/>
a closet unschooler, I guess.  Still sort of &quot;pretending&quot; to do a <br/>
curriculum, attempting to unschool myself, playing, being, living and <br/>
noticing everyone&#39;s interests.    I&#39;d like to understand how to  really <br/>
shift into unschooling, I also feel pressure at how old my kids are to <br/>
begin this, feel as if I need to either decide to &quot;go for it&quot; or not, <br/>
also not sure how to weave my work at an artist into the mix.  And how <br/>
to begin the dialogue with my partner, it took three years for me to <br/>
make a case for getting the kids out of ps.  Thank you for any and all <br/>
thoughts.   again, thanks, Ann Carlson</div>
