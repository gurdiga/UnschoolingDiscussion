<div id="ygrps-yiv-519813609">I don&#39;t know which site you are referring to but you do not need a written curriculum.   <br/>
In Texas, your child must attend a public school unless attending a private or parochial school. <br/>
Private schools are unregulated.  <br/>
Simply declare (to yourself, it is not necessary to register anywhere)  that you are establishing a very exclusive private school in your home and your child attends on a regular basis (YOU are the one that would decide if an absence is &quot;excused&quot; &lt;&lt;g&gt;&gt;). <br/>
<br/>
If authorities decide to question whether you really are a school,  or have a &quot;curriculum&quot;,  simply state that YOU  have developed a curriculum which is designed to meet basic education goals and that said curriculum was developed from many sources.....some written, some on an electronic screen (like the conferencing on this list).    It is not necessary for you to demonstrate or display it to anyone-----most especially not to any officials of the local public school!<br/>

  Hmm..I was reading more of your site and I came across the Texas<br/>
  requirements. I thought I had understood it to say that I was effectively<br/>
  free, but instead I find that my child must have a written curriculum. Now I<br/>
  m completely confused and quite unsure of what I need to do. Could anyone<br/>
  help explain how I can unschool Heaven and still meet whatever their<br/>
  requirements are. <br/>

want <br/>
MY kids to be subjected to such ridiculous instructional methods and it<br/>
gives <br/>
me absolute confidence that unschooling is a way better idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993783148">Thank you. I believe it was in the unschooling.com site that I read it, but<br/>
I may have misunderstood it. I have alot of trouble reading that kind of<br/>
thing. Sounds like double talk to me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
