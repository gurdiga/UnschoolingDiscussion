 </span></blockquote>    We turned ours off every night when we first got it. Then we left it on <br/>
24/7. Recently since our move I have been turning it off daily. Now we are <br/>
back on 24/7. Our computer is all screwy from the move and all sorts of stuff <br/>
is going on. I really should take time and call Gateway. Dh is ready to trash <br/>
it and buy a new one. That is always his solution. <br/>

I want a husband like that.  Mine&#39;s about to take our 17 year old Jetta in <br/>
for new brakes and fuel injection work.  IT&#39;S JUNK!  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the car I drive, but I&#39;m still ashamed to know it. &lt;g&gt;  (It was cool <br/>
when we bought it, before I was pregnant with Kirby, when it seemed really <br/>
big.  We had a Kaypro II then...)<br/>

unswerving devotion, AND the reluctance to change.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
