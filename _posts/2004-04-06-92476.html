<div id="ygrps-yiv-705706368">I would love to read this article!<br/>
  I just checked my email today (Monday) and the Sunday paper is no longer on <br/>
their website, the Monday front page is.  Could someone who forwarded the <br/>
article to their relatives please send it on to me?  (Unless you just sent them <br/>
the link to the paper) <br/>
<br/>
 Or is there something I&#39;m missing and I can still read the article even <br/>
though it&#39;s today&#39;s paper they have up now?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help!!!<br/>
<br/>
