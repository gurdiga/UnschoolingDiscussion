&gt; I think the last one, Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;The Art of Education,&quot; is <br/>
&gt; probably the one I turn to most when I need reminding why we do this. <br/>
&gt; Of course, I edited that book... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And while I&#39;m at this unseemly horn-tootling, &lt;g&gt; there are plenty of <br/>
&gt; terrific articles and columns online at our HEM and Unschooling <br/>
&gt; websites.<br/>

then?<br/>
