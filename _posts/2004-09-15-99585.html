<div id="ygrps-yiv-864444293">I&#39;m upset and alittle afraid right now... while I was away from home <br/>
yesterday afternoon, my 14 yo daughter got a phone call from a man <br/>
claiming to be an &#39;investigator&#39; I&#39;m assuming from DFS.. he knew my <br/>
children&#39;s names, asked which one he was talking too.. also asked if we <br/>
homeschooled. My dd was caught so off guard.. and did tell him her name <br/>
and answered that yes, we homeschool. When he asked to speak with the <br/>
mom.. she told him I wasn&#39;t at home and then she just hung up. This man <br/>
tried to call back about 5 min later.. but my dd wouldn&#39;t answer the <br/>
phone again, and he didn&#39;t leave a message.... So now I&#39;m wondering what <br/>
happens next... I feel like our lives have been invaded.. worried about <br/>
how far this will go.. Any one here have advice or experience to offer.. <br/>
I would so appreciate it. Right now, I&#39;m afraid to let my girls answer <br/>
the phone or even be outside during school hours.. and we live in the <br/>
country too! Thanks, Julie in MO</div>

This is a national secular legal advice group for home schoolers. Contact<br/>
them for some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have caller ID in your phone? It might be worth calling that number<br/>
during business hours (from a pay phone or with your ID blocked) to see if<br/>
it is DFS and not some commercial enterprise - some of which may still have<br/>
a large amount of information.<br/>
<br/>
Are all your legal paperwork things up to date and in order?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve role played with my kids so they&#39;ve had the chance to practice - &quot;My mom can&#39;t come to the phone&quot;, never that I&#39;m not home, unless it is one of our close friends or close family member.  If the person on the phone pesters you, all the more reason to REPEAT, my mom can&#39;t come to the phone.  If a kid is not able to do this, perhaps they should not be left home alone ever or should be instructed to NOT answer the phone.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my kids are 11 and 9, we use the answering machine anyway, so they wouldn&#39;t need to answer the phone when they are home alone.  On our machine, you can hear the caller leaving the message.  They can easily pick it up or call back if it is someone they wish to talk to, or me calling to check on them.  It is well worth the price to have this sort of answering machine!<br/>

I live in MO.  Do you have any idea why they would call you? They may<br/>
just have had someone complain and think they can bully you around. <br/>
You have rights in MO and as long as you have your ducks in a row,<br/>
there is nothing they can do. <br/>
<br/>
Have you logged any hours at all this &quot;school year&quot;?  What you need<br/>
most is to have started some form of logging 1000 hours. I would do<br/>
one of two things: 1. go to a teacher supply store and get a teachers<br/>
weekly planner and fill in the spaces for your hours and just put down<br/>
what you have done since the beginning of Sept. If we read a book, I<br/>
log it as an hour, if we go to the park, it&#39;s P.E. for an hour, if<br/>
they play Yugio cards I log math for an hour, etc.  It&#39;s only a few<br/>
weeks, so you should be able to put down enough that you can show<br/>
proof that you are doing things &quot;by the law&quot;.  2. If you don&#39;t want to<br/>
hand write it, you can use Missouri Logger Rhythms.  Do a google<br/>
search.  It&#39;s a program that you can do the same thing with and it<br/>
prints out nice pretty monthly hours that look very schoolish. It&#39;s<br/>
perfect for unschoolers b/c it prints out a log with just the core<br/>
hours/noncore hours without listing all the things that they might not<br/>
see as schoolish enough to log. I just log what we do everyday and try<br/>
to put it into subjects.  This way I&#39;m covered if I need it.  <br/>
<br/>
BUT, legally, no one can demand to see your hours without a court<br/>
order.  So, calm down and try to read up about your rights in MO.  The<br/>
only thing you need by law is to log 1000 hours in a year and have<br/>
some sort of portfolio (pictures, etc). I don&#39;t worry too much about<br/>
the porfolio stuff, I just keep any pictures or things they write.<br/>
That&#39;s it.  There is also a site on missouri homeschool law that you<br/>
can read up on your rights. I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have any links on this<br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
I would be furious that he questioned my child over the phone! I&#39;m<br/>
sure things will turn out fine.  Sorry for the ramble!  <br/>

Kinda worrisome.  Just today, I found myself explaining to Andy that now that it&#39;s school time again, he should probably stay close to me when we&#39;re out shopping and the like.  He&#39;d wanted permission to wait in the car while I was at the grocery store, and then to hang out in the toy aisle at WalMart while I did other shopping.  I told him I&#39;m a little worried he&#39;ll be seen by someone who will cause trouble by reporting it to the authorities in some way.  He offered to hide if he sees anyone who might have seen him.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

it would be a pain to deal with someone reporting us, but the reality <br/>

<br/>
I will not allow the kids to stray from me while shopping at any store--the<br/>
kids are 9 & 13.  We have been having trouble in all the major stores with a<br/>
guy groping kids.  He waits until the kid is alone on the aisle (usually in<br/>
the toy department) and then fondles.  By the time the kid finds mom &<br/>
reports it the guy is long gone.  There have been some incidents caught on<br/>
the cameras.  This is happening to kids from 7 or 8 up to around 16 both<br/>
boys and girls and all across our region. I&#39;m not willing to take that kind<br/>
of chance with my guys.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple of weeks, so I guess it&#39;s time to introduce<br/>
myself.  I am Liz, married to the same man for 32 years, work at home mom<br/>
and  mom to 6 children with my last name and multitudes that come through<br/>
the house and don&#39;t get our name.  We foster thru a therapeutic foster care<br/>
program.  I have 1 child with my last name left at home--the others are out<br/>
of the house (except Robbie -- died last year at age 17).  My 9 year old son<br/>
has never been in a structured school setting. He does best with child-led<br/>
learning.  My 2 younger girls homeschooled for some time of their<br/>
middle/high school years. Because of their time in public school they<br/>
required much more structure than I was comfortable with--they never<br/>
completely deschooled in spite of my efforts.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;d gladly nurse Dan (3.8) in public -- I&#39;ve offered to a coupla times recently when he wanted to cut short an outing to go home to nurse. He&#39;s the one who won&#39;t nurse in front of anyone except immediate family!  Somewhere around 20 mos, he decided nursing was a private thing -- before that we nursed everywhere, anytime<br/>

Yes, homeschooling is normal and natural.  It&#39;s a much bigger pita than I&#39;m willing to invite into my life -- and one of my neighbors is a genuine concern.  She&#39;s the queen of nuisance complaints to the city.  <br/>
 <br/>
My kids aren&#39;t afraid of someone knowing we they don&#39;t go to school -- they tell anyone who asks, and often folks who don&#39;t ask.  Because our lifestyle isn&#39;t mainstream, they know we are cautious.   <br/>
 <br/>
I guess, too, timing had a lot to do with it.  My inlaws arrive in 3 wks -- I really don&#39;t need to be juggling child or educational neglect complaints while they&#39;re here!<br/>
