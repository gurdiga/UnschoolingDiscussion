&gt; &quot;Expert&quot; is not a word to be used, I think.  I&#39;m experienced, though.  <br/>

Your experience has led you to expertise. You may not feel like &quot;the perfect <br/>
unschooler,&quot;  but I suspect that even when you&#39;re not, you pretty much know <br/>
the direction you need to go in. There is a reason that people come to hear <br/>
you speak at conferences, and it&#39;s not JUST cuz yer cute.<br/>
<br/>
By even the standards of mainstream society, you have a reputation (some <br/>
might even say notoriety!) in your field.  You&#39;re an expert -- you know <br/>
stuff! If you decided to write a book about it, your expertise and reputation <br/>
would get you a book contract. <br/>
