I&#39;m not  out saving the world and not my family........they are <br/>
my very first  priority, but I think it&#39;s wrong to live in a bubble. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
 <br/>
Keep thinking about that as your child gets older.<br/>
How much of the outside world will BE in your immediate moment-to-moment  <br/>
realm?<br/>
 <br/>
There is enough unhappiness in the world that will happen in the next sixty  <br/>
seconds to make us all suicidal.  We HAVE to tune a lot of it out.   Six <br/>
billion people aren&#39;t all having a good, peaceful time while you read  this.  And <br/>
that&#39;s just the people.   You seem to be putting a lot  of healing energy <br/>
toward chickens you&#39;ve never met and cows you heard or read  about.<br/>
 <br/>
You ARE in a bubble, with your baby.  And you should be.  She  should have <br/>
ALL of you.<br/>
 <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if all babies had their mother&#39;s full attention?<br/>
If you spend much time thinking about that, your baby doesn&#39;t have your  full <br/>
attention.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We have to <br/>
think about how our actions affect others but not neglect  ourselves in the <br/>
process. <br/>
I grew up in a family like this. I fell by the  wayside while my mom was <br/>
&quot;doing good&quot; for others. She was always nasty at  home........much like <br/>
living with <br/>
an alcoholic. <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Not only are some things genetic, but living with an alcoholic or anyone  <br/>
LIKE an alcoholic creates behaviors in the children that affect the  <br/>
grandchildren.  People have documented the heck out of this.  Even if  the offspring <br/>
didn&#39;t ever drink, they act like people whose parents drank, and  their children <br/>
(NOT the children of alcoholics) can be affected by inexplicable  controlling <br/>
and distracted behaviors.   The purpose of Adult Children  of Alcoholics is to <br/>
help people get past those problems.  It helped me a  lot.    Now there are <br/>
websites and people don&#39;t even have to  go to a meeting to get some of the <br/>
benefits.<br/>
 <br/>
Four of us stopped on a road trip to visit a friend of mine who reads tarot  <br/>
cards.  We&#39;d stopped just to visit, but she offered readings.   Cool!  One of <br/>
the four of us was newish to the group, and the girlfriend of  the only male.  <br/>
As we sat through her reading, the other three of us  glanced at each other <br/>
several times with big eyes, and took in our breath at how  bang on the reading <br/>
was.  (Having known each other a long time, what I  described above sounds <br/>
blatant, but we were really subtle, and the subject is  NOT good at social <br/>
clues, so she probably wasn&#39;t noticing us at all  anyway.)   The reader asked at <br/>
the end if any of it had seemed right  or useful (don&#39;t remember how she asked), <br/>
and the new friend said &quot;No, it  sounded as though you were reading for <br/>
someone else, not me.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
This is not a defense of tarot cards.  I have no strong feelings one  way or <br/>
another about that. It&#39;s about people not seeing traits in themselves  that <br/>
others clearly see.  Our reader-friend did another reading, which was  quick, <br/>
bland, and sounded like it was about someone else, or no one.  The  first one <br/>
had been &quot;the right one,&quot; the right first impressions of someone used  to <br/>
denying her own projections and reflections.<br/>
