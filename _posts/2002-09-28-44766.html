<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037644824">Several people have written me telling me they were having trouble<br/>
subscribing to my list.  I think probably because it&#39;s just so new.  If you<br/>
would like to subscribe, just send a blank email to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:LDSunshcooling-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">LDSunshcooling-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> that should do it.<br/>
Thanks for the interest!<br/>

Did you really misspell schooling?<br/>
If so, that might be why they&#39;re having trouble getting onto the list.</div>

It&#39;s not at yahoogroups under unschcooling OR unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Find the home page of your group by going to yahoogroups and double check <br/>
what you named it.<br/>
<br/>
Of if the home page won&#39;t come up, maybe the make-a-list didn&#39;t quite take.<br/>
<br/>
43 groups came up searching for LDS homeschool, but not all were strictly <br/>
just LDS groups.  Many were.  Most are small, but there are a few bigger ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Searching, I found this:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HISHOUSEFULL <br/>
This list is for Christian Women only, who have five or more children. Any <br/>
Protestant or Catholic women, NO Mormon, or LDS faith is represented here. <br/>
All children must be biological, not adopted, no foster children. The reason <br/>
for this is we are ladies who want to share stories of birthing many <br/>
children, being pregnant while breastfeeding, and encourage one another in <br/>
the area of letting the womb be controlled by the Lord. In adoption, the womb <br/>
is not affected, and fostering children is not part ... more<br/>
<br/>
They have more than five kids but there are fewer than 5 members on their <br/>
group.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
