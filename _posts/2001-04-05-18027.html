<div id="ygrps-yiv-557397838">This might be a long one, so I understand some of you<br/>
might have to skip it. But I&#39;d appreciate any advice<br/>
or support from those of you with the kindness and<br/>
patience to hear me out.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 8yo. There&#39;s some suspicion she might be<br/>
bipolar, but we haven&#39;t gotten so far yet as to seek a<br/>
diagnosis. Partly that&#39;s because I&#39;m appalled at the<br/>
idea of her taking medication. Partly it&#39;s a learned<br/>
mistrust of doctors. Partly it&#39;s fear/denial.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, today&#39;s incident, which has me in tears off<br/>
and on, concerns her blanket. She has had this special<br/>
blanket she calls BB since she was, oh, 2 or 3. It&#39;s<br/>
very special to her, though it&#39;s nothing more than a<br/>
raggedy scrap by now. It has to be washed frequently<br/>
because she chews on it. We&#39;ve talked to her about the<br/>
dye from the blanket getting into her system (she<br/>
sometimes has bright green poop) and about the<br/>
bacteria that grow on it from her saliva. She<br/>
understands this, but she isn&#39;t able to give up the<br/>
chewing. She also still sucks her thumb when trying to<br/>
sleep or calm herself. <br/>
<br/>
My ds (10yo) asked her today if she would rather give<br/>
up BB or the cat. She looked horrified at the thought<br/>
of either choice, then said the cat. Ds and I were<br/>
shocked, but I realized it wasn&#39;t a fair question<br/>
because of the completely different functions the cat<br/>
and the blanket serve for her. That&#39;s like asking me,<br/>
would you rather give up books or your friends? <br/>
<br/>
Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br/>
thought and thought and thought for so long I started<br/>
feeling insulted. I said, &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br/>
know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama,<br/>
but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br/>
hugged me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br/>
shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my personality, it&#39;s my life,<br/>
everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) say<br/>
anything else at all about it. <br/>
<br/>
Now before anyone jumps to the conclusion that we<br/>
somehow have a troubled relationship (I&#39;d give up my<br/>
dad before I&#39;d give up coffee, but then, he&#39;s never<br/>
liked me) let me assure you that we are very close,<br/>
very open and communicative, very<br/>
attachment-parenting. We adore each other. The other<br/>
day she woke me with breakfast in bed just because she<br/>
wanted to see my pleased surprise. <br/>
<br/>
However, I can&#39;t help being hurt. I keep crying. I<br/>
tell myself we&#39;ll talk this over tomorrow and it&#39;ll be<br/>
fine. Right now, she&#39;s still in her uncommunicative<br/>
stage. Dh is out of town for work, and so is my best<br/>
friend, and so I don&#39;t even have them to turn to for<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over this<br/>
is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br/>
me. In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br/>
pacifiers or special teddy bears are a symbol of the<br/>
mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>
realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>
object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>
saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>
as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>
that she really is bipolar. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br/>
unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br/>
example) writing one of her illustrated stories, and<br/>
she can&#39;t get her letters to line up perfectly and<br/>
goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go to<br/>
her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br/>
the story when she&#39;s feeling better. <br/>
<br/>
When she was in school (kindergarten and first grade<br/>
and the beginning of second) each year, the teachers<br/>
started off raving about what a happy, cooperative,<br/>
friendly child she was, so well-loved by the other<br/>
children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br/>
time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br/>
wondering if someone had died or if there was a<br/>
divorce going on, because Aubrey had suddenly changed<br/>
dramatically and was now  a sullen, teary,<br/>
non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br/>
the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br/>
was no problem, that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br/>
person, and that this new Aubrey was every bit as much<br/>
the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of course<br/>
they thought I was covering some family secret or<br/>
something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br/>
approach me and say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br/>
maybe whatever the problem was had been solved but<br/>
they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her &quot;old<br/>
self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br/>
maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br/>
to the school counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br/>
perfectionism, inability to stop a creative project<br/>
when it was time to line up (I know, I can see you<br/>
rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br/>
problems&quot; and so forth. The the school counselor would<br/>
feel the sweet thrill of success as Aubrey would<br/>
suddenly become sunny and sweet again.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess I<br/>
just won&#39;t. I hope someone had the extraordinary<br/>
patience to read it all. <br/>
<br/>
Juli, who is tearing up again.<br/>

It&#39;s late and I&#39;m tired but just had to do a quick reply.&nbsp; My mom is 
bipolar.&nbsp; It&#39;s a pain but not the end of the world.&nbsp; And very 
treatable in most cases.&nbsp; I&#39;m not one for tons of medication but there&#39;s a 
time and a place..... though I&#39;m sure there are many who would disagree.&nbsp; I 
can only speak from personal experience. It sounds like you are doing a great 
job with your daughter.&nbsp; How lucky for her, if she is bipolar (and even if 
she isn&#39;t) to be in such a safe, nurturing environment.&nbsp; My mom was not so 
lucky.&nbsp; Feel free to email me if you want more info.</span></font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-964812310">Juli,   Cry.. okay.. just cry it all out.  I wish you were here, it would so<br/>
much easier to talk about this in person than online. You&#39;re gonna have to<br/>
pretend we&#39;re at some park with the son shining and the kids are all off<br/>
having a good time.  Listen to that little voice and come on out of denial.<br/>
It&#39;s gonna be just fine. Matter of fact it&#39;s gonna be BETTER once you look<br/>
this thing squarely in the face.  Trust me, okay?  Take a deep breath, so<br/>
it&#39;s true we have some issues we have to deal with and then cry.  Some of us<br/>
will cry too<br/>
<br/>
I have lots and lots of thoughts and ideas and resources.  The chewing in<br/>
itself is a sign. Many, many Asperger&#39;s children chew their clothing.  What<br/>
you need to di is do a web search on Aspergers, Autism, Tony Atwood, and<br/>
bipolar. Read, read read. On the message boards there is a folder for<br/>
special needs kids with some just wonderful moms to talk to.Go there and ask<br/>
very specific questions, the more specific the better.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I have to go read to my own little girls, but will hold you in our<br/>
thoughts tonight. And tomorrow we can start looking this thing in the face.<br/>
&quot;kay?<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
Lisa<br/>
<br/>
No matter what, there&#39;s a whole world of support right here, on the loop and<br/>
on the boards. ----- Original Message -----<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801673363">Hi Yuli;<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is &quot;sit tight for now&quot;.  Aubrey is not so unique to be<br/>
paricularly attached to a &quot;lovie&quot; or inanimate object.  I have a sister<br/>
who was very much like your Aubrey.  She too was soooooooooooo<br/>
incredibly attached to her blankie I know it caused my mom unending<br/>
grief for a lot of years.<br/>
(My sister was also a thumb-sucker.)  I don&#39;t want to spook you but<br/>
would you believe she never really did out-grow the thing?  Even as a<br/>
teen she would enjoy the feel of running her fingers through that<br/>
hardly-there and well-worn scrap of a blankie.  Literally, it was a<br/>
shred of what it was but she still knew where it was if she needed it. <br/>
Certainly, her habits with it changed considerably the older she got, to<br/>
the point where it was a very occasional quick touch every few weeks,<br/>
but I think it was dependable security during an anxious moment.  Sure<br/>
beats cigarettes!  As a 38 year old woman now I do believe she STILL<br/>
knows where those bare threads of a scrap could be found if she needed<br/>
it!  I&#39;ve seen her suspiciously linger over a wash cloth or two when<br/>
folding laundry!!!  (Try not to laugh too hysterically)  I might add she<br/>
is now a completely content, attractive and successful woman who handles<br/>
extrememly stressful situations better than most people I know.  She<br/>
works at the biggest and busiest law firm in town, with one of Canada&#39;s<br/>
greatest corporate lawyers.  So the blankie has not done her any harm. <br/>
She did go through a spell of depression during highschool after coming<br/>
down with mononucleosis and then again after a sexual assault as an<br/>
adult but otherwise has been a strong and vibrant woman.  Try not to<br/>
worry.  The blankie behavior is far more normal than society is willing<br/>
to recognize.  It is wonderful to hear that you are such a loving and<br/>
&quot;attached&quot; mother who is so in touch with her daughter.  If she needs<br/>
your support in a different way when she is older I know you will be<br/>
there for her.  You are right to be concerned about how children can<br/>
often be over-medicated these days.  Maybe the day will come when she<br/>
could benefit from medication but I wouldn&#39;t think that day is here<br/>
yet.  If you become truly concerned with moodiness and unhappiness as<br/>
time goes on perhaps experimenting with the herbal St. John&#39;s Wort could<br/>
indicate some change.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish you and Aubrey all the best,<br/>
<br/>
Sonia<br/>

&gt; This might be a long one, so I understand some of you<br/>
&gt; might have to skip it. But I&#39;d appreciate any advice<br/>
&gt; or support from those of you with the kindness and<br/>
&gt; patience to hear me out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dd is 8yo. There&#39;s some suspicion she might be<br/>
&gt; bipolar, but we haven&#39;t gotten so far yet as to seek a<br/>
&gt; diagnosis. Partly that&#39;s because I&#39;m appalled at the<br/>
&gt; idea of her taking medication. Partly it&#39;s a learned<br/>
&gt; mistrust of doctors. Partly it&#39;s fear/denial.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, today&#39;s incident, which has me in tears off<br/>
&gt; and on, concerns her blanket. She has had this special<br/>
&gt; blanket she calls BB since she was, oh, 2 or 3. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; very special to her, though it&#39;s nothing more than a<br/>
&gt; raggedy scrap by now. It has to be washed frequently<br/>
&gt; because she chews on it. We&#39;ve talked to her about the<br/>
&gt; dye from the blanket getting into her system (she<br/>
&gt; sometimes has bright green poop) and about the<br/>
&gt; bacteria that grow on it from her saliva. She<br/>
&gt; understands this, but she isn&#39;t able to give up the<br/>
&gt; chewing. She also still sucks her thumb when trying to<br/>
&gt; sleep or calm herself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My ds (10yo) asked her today if she would rather give<br/>
&gt; up BB or the cat. She looked horrified at the thought<br/>
&gt; of either choice, then said the cat. Ds and I were<br/>
&gt; shocked, but I realized it wasn&#39;t a fair question<br/>
&gt; because of the completely different functions the cat<br/>
&gt; and the blanket serve for her. That&#39;s like asking me,<br/>
&gt; would you rather give up books or your friends?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br/>
&gt; thought and thought and thought for so long I started<br/>
&gt; feeling insulted. I said, &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama,<br/>
&gt; but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br/>
&gt; hugged me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br/>
&gt; shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my personality, it&#39;s my life,<br/>
&gt; everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) say<br/>
&gt; anything else at all about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now before anyone jumps to the conclusion that we<br/>
&gt; somehow have a troubled relationship (I&#39;d give up my<br/>
&gt; dad before I&#39;d give up coffee, but then, he&#39;s never<br/>
&gt; liked me) let me assure you that we are very close,<br/>
&gt; very open and communicative, very<br/>
&gt; attachment-parenting. We adore each other. The other<br/>
&gt; day she woke me with breakfast in bed just because she<br/>
&gt; wanted to see my pleased surprise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I can&#39;t help being hurt. I keep crying. I<br/>
&gt; tell myself we&#39;ll talk this over tomorrow and it&#39;ll be<br/>
&gt; fine. Right now, she&#39;s still in her uncommunicative<br/>
&gt; stage. Dh is out of town for work, and so is my best<br/>
&gt; friend, and so I don&#39;t even have them to turn to for<br/>
&gt; perspective.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over this<br/>
&gt; is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br/>
&gt; me. In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br/>
&gt; pacifiers or special teddy bears are a symbol of the<br/>
&gt; mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>
&gt; object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>
&gt; saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>
&gt; as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>
&gt; that she really is bipolar.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br/>
&gt; unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br/>
&gt; example) writing one of her illustrated stories, and<br/>
&gt; she can&#39;t get her letters to line up perfectly and<br/>
&gt; goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go to<br/>
&gt; her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br/>
&gt; the story when she&#39;s feeling better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When she was in school (kindergarten and first grade<br/>
&gt; and the beginning of second) each year, the teachers<br/>
&gt; started off raving about what a happy, cooperative,<br/>
&gt; friendly child she was, so well-loved by the other<br/>
&gt; children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br/>
&gt; time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br/>
&gt; wondering if someone had died or if there was a<br/>
&gt; divorce going on, because Aubrey had suddenly changed<br/>
&gt; dramatically and was now  a sullen, teary,<br/>
&gt; non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br/>
&gt; the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br/>
&gt; was no problem, that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br/>
&gt; person, and that this new Aubrey was every bit as much<br/>
&gt; the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of course<br/>
&gt; they thought I was covering some family secret or<br/>
&gt; something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br/>
&gt; approach me and say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br/>
&gt; maybe whatever the problem was had been solved but<br/>
&gt; they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her &quot;old<br/>
&gt; self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br/>
&gt; maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br/>
&gt; to the school counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br/>
&gt; perfectionism, inability to stop a creative project<br/>
&gt; when it was time to line up (I know, I can see you<br/>
&gt; rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br/>
&gt; problems&quot; and so forth. The the school counselor would<br/>
&gt; feel the sweet thrill of success as Aubrey would<br/>
&gt; suddenly become sunny and sweet again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess I<br/>
&gt; just won&#39;t. I hope someone had the extraordinary<br/>
&gt; patience to read it all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Juli, who is tearing up again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1882296702">Juli --<br/>
<br/>
I do not have answers with a capital &quot;A&quot; for you, but I can share some things <br/>
about our kids and family that may help.<br/>
<br/>
Our 7yo, Owen, chews his clothes. He chews the sleeves of his shirts and <br/>
sweatshirts, mainly. The left sleeves, usually. They get really, really wet, <br/>
sometimes to the elbow, and full of holes. He has a precious blankie, that he <br/>
chews on as well, but I guess the sleeves are more convenient. :)<br/>
<br/>
Jesse, 8, no longer chews his clothes. (For him it was the neck of his shirts <br/>
-- all of them had a hole or two at his breastbone.) He chewed for about a <br/>
year. <br/>
<br/>
Now, personality-wise, Owen is sunshine. He is one of the most self-confident <br/>
people I have ever met. He sees nothing wrong with chewing on his sleeves. In <br/>
his mind, if he&#39;s doing it, he must need or want to for some reason, and <br/>
that&#39;s good enough for him. He isn&#39;t sitting in the corner huddled up <br/>
chewing, he is running, laughing, playing, watching T.V. -- and chewing. <br/>
<br/>
Jesse is &quot;moody&quot;. (Like me.) He can explode or withdraw with frustration. His <br/>
&quot;habits&quot; -- continual handwashing, &quot;don&#39;t touch my things -- your hands are <br/>
dirty!&quot;, intense need to possess and collect things -- could be viewed as <br/>
odd, I suppose, as could Owen&#39;s chewing. But really, it&#39;s just them -- part <br/>
of their individual little &quot;uniqueness&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I would really hate to see them start to wonder if something is &quot;wrong with <br/>
me&quot;. To me THAT is much more damaging than Owen&#39;s chewing or Jesse&#39;s <br/>
explosions.<br/>
<br/>
I sucked my thumb until I was about 8. Besides the bad tasting stuff they <br/>
used to put on my thumb to discourage me, my dad&#39;s favorite tactic was to <br/>
make fun of me in front of my younger brother and sister. I tell Owen to chew <br/>
on his shirt sleeves as long as he wants to. We have lots of hand-me-downs, <br/>
and he won&#39;t run out of shirts. <br/>
<br/>
I also feel that &quot;bipolar&quot; is the medical communities next &quot;ADD&quot;. Just wait <br/>
and watch. It will be the next &quot;popular&quot; dx for kids. Look at what you have <br/>
done for your kids already, Juli. You are a strong and protective mother and <br/>
you can hunt down answers about the bipolar worries. You&#39;ll know in your <br/>
heart what is true and right and loving for your daughter. There is nothing <br/>
wrong with her having that blanket. There is nothing wrong with the chewing. <br/>
And she loves you, of course, she just sounds frightened that someone may <br/>
take her blanket away and that the people she loves view her having it as <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; somehow. &quot;Is something wrong with me?&quot; is a question that haunts many <br/>
of us from our childhood, and it breaks my heart when a child starts to <br/>
wonder this.<br/>
<br/>
You are a good and strong and loving mother. She is your perfect child. You <br/>
are so lucky to have each other. Don&#39;t let false worries and fear creep in. <br/>
Breathe deeply and then start to search for some truth. :)<br/>
<br/>
Finally -- I just cringe when I write a post that sounds &quot;all-knowing&quot; and <br/>
full of wisdom. (ugh.) This is just our experience and my thoughts. Take what <br/>
sounds right for you and your situation, and TOSS the rest! :)<br/>
<br/>
Love to you and your family,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815170494">I had two thoughts after reading your post.  The first was that it sounds to <br/>
me like your daughter&#39;s reaction may be more from feeling like she&#39;s being <br/>
pushed to give up the blanket than how she separates her attachment to <br/>
others.  She may be reluctant to admit that it&#39;s not as important as any <br/>
other loved thing or person for fear it will mean she has to give it up.<br/>
<br/>
The second thought is that it&#39;s very hard for children to answer questions <br/>
like the one that was asked of her.  I think they know instinctively that <br/>
it&#39;s a test of their loyalty and love and they freeze up.  Also, kids are <br/>
very close to their emotions.  If they aren&#39;t &quot;feeling&quot; particularly <br/>
affectionate it&#39;s hard to &quot;say&quot; it anyway.  I make it a point to not ask <br/>
questions like this and let them profess their affection on their own, which <br/>
is usually when they are &quot;feeling&quot; that way.  They&#39;ll understand that love is <br/>
a constant and can exist independent of their emotions as they mature.<br/>
<br/>
I know it can be very hard but I try to not take what kids say personally.  I <br/>
know they love me and what they say at times is more about mood than reality.<br/>

  bipolar.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I mean, ONE of the reasons (there are many)<br>&gt; 
  unschooling is so good for her is that if she&#39;s (for<br>&gt; example) writing 
  one of her illustrated stories, and<br>&gt; she can&#39;t get her letters to line 
  up perfectly and<br>&gt; goes into an uncontrollable fit, she can stop, go 
  to<br>&gt; her room, cuddle up with her blanket and come back to<br>&gt; the 
  story when she&#39;s feeling better.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; When she was in school 
  (kindergarten and first grade<br>&gt; and the beginning of second) each year, 
  the teachers<br>&gt; started off raving about what a happy, 
  cooperative,<br>&gt; friendly child she was, so well-loved by the 
  other<br>&gt; children, so kind, etc. Then, each year, there came a<br>&gt; 
  time when we got a phone call from the teacher,<br>&gt; wondering if someone 
  had died or if there was a<br>&gt; divorce going on, because Aubrey had 
  suddenly changed<br>&gt; dramatically and was now&nbsp; a sullen, 
  teary,<br>&gt; non-participatory girl who had tantrums and hid from<br>&gt; 
  the other kids at recess. I would assure them there<br>&gt; was no problem, 
  that Aubrey is, in fact a very moody<br>&gt; person, and that this new Aubrey 
  was every bit as much<br>&gt; the &quot;real&quot; Aubrey as the one they first met. Of 
  course<br>&gt; they thought I was covering some family secret or<br>&gt; 
  something. But one day soon, a smiling teacher would<br>&gt; approach me and 
  say maybe Aubrey had been sick or<br>&gt; maybe whatever the problem was had 
  been solved but<br>&gt; they were happy to see Aubrey was back to her 
  &quot;old<br>&gt; self.&quot; This cycle would usually occur once, twice, or<br>&gt; 
  maybe three times a school year. There&#39;d be referrals<br>&gt; to the school 
  counselor for various &quot;problems&quot; such as<br>&gt; perfectionism, inability to 
  stop a creative project<br>&gt; when it was time to line up (I know, I can see 
  you<br>&gt; rolling your eyes!)which was called &quot;transition<br>&gt; problems&quot; 
  and so forth. The the school counselor would<br>&gt; feel the sweet thrill of 
  success as Aubrey would<br>&gt; suddenly become sunny and sweet 
  again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I don&#39;t know how to wrap all this up, so I guess 
  I<br>&gt; just won&#39;t. I hope someone had the extraordinary<br>&gt; patience to 
  read it all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Juli, who is tearing up 
  again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478455039"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">To Juli about Aubrey,
<br>
<br>The good thing about homeschooling is that Aubrey won&#39;t HAVE teachers and 
<br>counselors and other kids making her moods worse, or spotlighting them, or 
<br>praising her for being &quot;up&quot; (or acting like it&#39;s their superior teaching and 
<br>counseling abilities that &quot;caused&quot; the happiness).
<br>
<br>I would recommend dealing gently with Aubrey in the moment. &nbsp;It&#39;s possible 
<br>that the dye and bacteria aren&#39;t as bad as the shaming and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;Do you 
<br>re-use toothbrushes or get a new one every day? &nbsp;(Or boil them?) &nbsp;People do 
<br>&quot;recycle&quot; their own bacteria pretty often, from drinking glasses, coffeecups, 
<br>all kinds of things.
<br>
<br>When she&#39;s down or agitated or depressed, the fact that you DO know it&#39;s the 
<br>low of a cycle and she&#39;ll come back up in a few days or weeks should make it 
<br>easy for you to accept that she just kinda might need to be left alone or at 
<br>her own chosen level of interaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;When she&#39;s active and zippy and 
<br>smiley, don&#39;t make a big deal about that either--just appreciate it, and 
<br>maybe encourage her to get some things done (room cleaning? projects? &nbsp;having 
<br>friends visit? &nbsp;I&#39;m thinking of examples from other people&#39;s lives) that 
<br>might be harder to do when she&#39;s down (temporarily, next time).
<br>
<br>Kirby has mood problems more than anyone else in our family except me. &nbsp;So 
<br>because I was that way as a kid too, I teach him tricks which nobody thought 
<br>to teach me. &nbsp;How to breathe through frustration and rising fury, and to 
<br>remember that you have to pick up what you throw, and clean up what you 
<br>break. &nbsp;(When he was younger, he would throw things down when he was 
<br>angry--like remote controls for video games, or decks of cards. &nbsp;He quit 
<br>doing that before long because we would calmly point out what his options had 
<br>been--to breathe, set them down, and then walk away.)
<br>
<br>What I&#39;ve told Kirby (when he&#39;s receptive) is that he will probably be that 
<br>way his whole life, so he needs to learn to feel it coming and make 
<br>allowances for it. &nbsp;When he&#39;s in a depressed or frustrated state, he needs to 
<br>arrange to be by himself a little more, and realize that it&#39;s HIM and not all 
<br>the people and things around him, and that he won&#39;t stay there, that way, for 
<br>long. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>He&#39;s lucky to be homeschooled and have the luxury of not having to interact 
<br>with a random bunch of outside people whether he wants to or not, when he&#39;s 
<br>in a low phase. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I&#39;m lucky that I recognized some of his &quot;symptoms&quot; and could share tricks 
<br>with him that help our whole family now, and will help him always.
<br>
<br>Trying to drug a child (except in TOTALLY extreme cases, which sometimes are 
<br>caused by overreaction to mild cases) or change them or wish the biochemical 
<br>realities away will add stress to an already stressful situation. &nbsp;Kids don&#39;t 
<br>act consistently and don&#39;t need to. &nbsp;&nbsp;Parents can learn to roll with the 
<br>waves, and help the kids do it too. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>&quot;Bi-polar&quot; or &quot;manic depressive&quot; comes in all degrees. &nbsp;I realized in my 20&#39;s 
<br>that there were periods of time (not consistent lengths, but a week or three, 
<br>varying) that I could work really late, get up early, be clear and quick and 
<br>work overtime and visit all my friends and read and remember things (zip, 
<br>zip, zip), and then a week or two that I fell asleep early three or four 
<br>nights in a row, couldn&#39;t concentrate well, was short tempered, etc.
<br>
<br>Having a consistent schedule every day did *not* help. &nbsp;I was restless in the 
<br>manic phases (if they can be called that without people freaking out here) 
<br>and too tired in the downtimes.
<br>
<br>I think it&#39;s like a larger-scale cycle of sleeping and wakefulness--it&#39;s like 
<br>a cycle of brain growth (especially in kids!!) followed by a quieter time 
<br>(quieter in speed, noise, growth).
<br>
<br>It is not unnatural.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015839436">I&#39;m no expert on the subject of being bi-polar and I second the advice to<br/>
read all you can about the various possible conditions you daughter may or<br/>
may not have. That said, I have a good friend who was diagnosed as bi-polar<br/>
around age 35. We always thought he just had an intense personality and felt<br/>
things deeply. The same kind of mood swings you describe in your daughter<br/>
could have been describing him. But no one seemed to think of it as abnormal<br/>
or bad or something that needed to be &quot;fixed&quot;. It was only after he started<br/>
washing down a lot of legal and illegal drugs with alcohol that it really<br/>
posed a problem, because then the highs and lows got so exteme that he<br/>
couldn&#39;t work or inter-relate or even function anymore. If he had had an<br/>
insightful, caring mother like you he probably wouldn&#39;t have needed to<br/>
nearly die before starting to get better. So pat yourself on the back for<br/>
caring enough to ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349622115"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: yuli womie &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:yuliwomie@...">yuliwomie@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dd is 8yo. There&#39;s some suspicion she might be<br/>
&gt; bipolar, but we haven&#39;t gotten so far yet as to seek a<br/>
&gt; diagnosis. Partly that&#39;s because I&#39;m appalled at the<br/>
&gt; idea of her taking medication. Partly it&#39;s a learned<br/>
&gt; mistrust of doctors. Partly it&#39;s fear/denial.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t have any good advice for you here. My sister has gone through a<br/>
spell where she was manic/depressive (after struggling with anorexia for<br/>
years) and I know how hard it can be to deal with this as a family. It was<br/>
very difficult while she was living with us at times. The good news is that<br/>
she is doing fine now and is not on any medication. So even if your worst<br/>
fears are realized, remember that it&#39;s not a lifelong sentence, that things,<br/>
people, brain chemistry changes. It&#39;s good to look around at all the<br/>
possibilities and see what could be influencing it. Have you ruled out<br/>
allergies and sensitivities? Many of them show up as behavioral issues and<br/>
some food allergies can directly influence how the brain is functioning<br/>
(dairy and gluten have both been shown to actually influence brain<br/>
function). My son after he has eaten dairy products is a whole different<br/>
child to the one when he has no dairy products. So you might keep a food<br/>
diary and a behavioral diary for her and see if there are any obvious<br/>
triggers. Also, I&#39;ve mentioned it on this list before, but I would think<br/>
about looking into NAET if you suspect allergy-related behavioral issues.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then ds asked, &quot;Would you rather lose BB or Mama?&quot; She<br/>
&gt; thought and thought and thought for so long I started<br/>
&gt; feeling insulted. I said, &quot;Now, really, you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know? I&#39;m your Mama!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama,<br/>
&gt; but I reeeeeeally need BB.&quot; Ds was horrified and<br/>
&gt; hugged me and petted my hair. He pressed her and she<br/>
&gt; shouted, &quot;It&#39;s my personality, it&#39;s my life,<br/>
&gt; everything!&quot; And then she wouldn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) say<br/>
&gt; anything else at all about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, first of all these are questions that are unanswerable for her<br/>
obviously. It would be like someone asking me which of my kids I would<br/>
rather lose. I still have never gotten over reading &quot;Sophie&#39;s Choice&quot;, ya<br/>
know? It&#39;s a question that horrifies any parent because if you love someone<br/>
completely you just can&#39;t contemplate losing them. I suspect the question<br/>
took so long for her to answer because she loves both you and her blankie<br/>
completely. As you mentioned you are an attachment parent, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re<br/>
aware of just how important attachment is to the child. But the good news is<br/>
that children naturally gain independence from their attachment objects but<br/>
love for people is a much more complex and lifelong thing. She may stay very<br/>
attached to her blankie for a few more years and it may always be something<br/>
special to her, but as she grows and blossoms, her love for you will be<br/>
something much more fulfilling and total than that. If she finds the<br/>
question so distressing, it might be just as well to let her know that you<br/>
understand how hard that question was for her to answer and to let it go at<br/>
that (though it might be hard for you).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really think that the reason I&#39;m so teary over this<br/>
&gt; is NOT that I believe she loves the blanket more than<br/>
&gt; me. In fact, I&#39;ve always believed that blankies or<br/>
&gt; pacifiers or special teddy bears are a symbol of the<br/>
&gt; mother. I think the reason I&#39;m so teary is that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; realizing that, first, the deep need of her comfort<br/>
&gt; object, and second, the inability to speak after<br/>
&gt; saying something that probably horrified her as much<br/>
&gt; as it did me, I&#39;m realizing that I&#39;m scared shitless<br/>
&gt; that she really is bipolar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well obviously, I have no idea whether your daughter is or isn&#39;t bipolar,<br/>
but I&#39;d say that neither of these things (having a deep need for an<br/>
attachment object at this age or being unable to speak after saying<br/>
something really frightening) is necessarily unusual. I know lots of people<br/>
who kept their blankies or teddy bears well into their teenage or even<br/>
college years, for one thing. As for the rest of her up-and-down behavior,<br/>
you might want to talk to a family-friendly counselor or therapist about it.<br/>
I&#39;d suggest maybe contacting La Leche League to see if they have the name of<br/>
someone who is pro-attachment and can give you a balanced viewpoint on<br/>
whether or not you should seek additional help. I&#39;d also investigate the<br/>
allergy end of it, from my personal experience with that being a big<br/>
influence.<br/>
I know it is hard to see your child struggle with something that other<br/>
children don&#39;t have to face. Sending many (((hugs))) your way!<br/>

up. he only needed it when he was tired.<br/>

help to stop sucking it. Once HE decided he didnt want to do it <br/>

but three of us are afflicted with this to different<br/>
degrees)... He was put on some anti-depressants (at<br/>
the time we didn&#39;t know that the guy who prescribed<br/>
them just did so left and right to everyone) and did<br/>
really well on them... the problem was that one day<br/>
without them made such a HUGE difference, and one<br/>
weekend he went the whole weekend without taking them<br/>
(he was off partying somewhere and his pills were at<br/>
home) and when he came back he was going to take them<br/>
and we all left the house for the day to go do our own<br/>
things we had planned, well, when he poured them in<br/>
his hand, alot more came out than he needed, and in<br/>
his HUGE state of MAJOR depression (worse than usual<br/>
from lack of medication), which impairs your reasoning<br/>
as well, thought he&#39;d take extra cuz he had missed the<br/>
whole weekend. Well, then he got soo depressed in that<br/>
moment of realizing he was so dependant on them to be<br/>
able to function for one day that he took the whole<br/>
bottle and we all ended up at the hospital praying for<br/>
his life. I&#39;m not telling you that to scare you, cuz<br/>
he is an extreme case and I&#39;m going to say some<br/>
opposite ones, but I just said that one first cuz it<br/>
was my first introduction to the term of bipolar and<br/>
manic-depressive. Medication was obviously not for him<br/>
and prescribed too hastily. My dad later on came to<br/>
terms with the fact that he was majorly bipolar, and<br/>
we have never been much of a doctor family except when<br/>
absolutely neccesary, so the rest of us have never<br/>
been &quot;diagnosed&quot; by a blessed &quot;professional&quot; but that<br/>
really doesn&#39;t matter to me. Anyway, my dad would<br/>
start consciously recognizing when he was having a<br/>
&quot;low&quot; day and a &quot;high&quot; day. (We could all tell his<br/>
&quot;high&quot; days since I can remember. He would come home<br/>
some days and say &quot;hey you guys wanna go out to eat<br/>
and stay in a hotel...just for fun?&quot;..this was coming<br/>
from a man who HATED eating out and hotels... and<br/>
proceed to spend a BUNCH of money on us all without a<br/>
thought. very compulsively overly happy and<br/>
energetic....and the next day you never know he could<br/>
be so depressed he just wouldn&#39;t get out of bed. we<br/>
always attributed those days, though, to his health<br/>
problems (heart, mostly) and assumed he &quot;just didn&#39;t<br/>
feel good&quot;) ANYWAY (I frequently drift, bare with me),<br/>
that was a good start cuz then he could consciously<br/>
work to make it not quite such an extreme case in<br/>
either direction (but there was still &quot;symptoms&quot; or<br/>
whatever you want to call them)...and then came the<br/>
prozac craze that swept the nation. At the time I was<br/>
a strict vegetarian and radical naturalist and thought<br/>
pills of any kind were bad for you in the long run and<br/>
there must be some natural substitute for whatever it<br/>
was. Well, my sister&#39;s husband (who we won&#39;t go into<br/>
cuz I am anti- him) started taking it (he was just<br/>
flat out depressed, nothing manic about this man ever)<br/>
and so she suggested it to my dad. Well, even her<br/>
husband which I don&#39;t like started acting differently.<br/>
He&#39;s normally hard to get along with and please and<br/>
gets mad at people alot, and he stopped all that. I<br/>
was happy for her, but really didn&#39;t care. But then MY<br/>
DAD was just on a normal even keel all the time. No<br/>
manic binges and no making you physically sick<br/>
depression that no one can help with. Just ...as close<br/>
to &quot;normal&quot; (aside from being part of our family, ha<br/>
ha) as possible. We all loved it and he seemed to,<br/>
too.<br/>
Then sister&#39;s husband stopped taking it. I think it<br/>
made him mad that it forced him to be nice to people. <br/>
After awhile my dad did, too, cuz he said it made him<br/>
too &quot;docile&quot;. We were like, &quot;yeah. for you. it&#39;s a<br/>
good thing.&quot; (joking....sorry this is what we do in my<br/>
family. joking helps everything)<br/>
my other brother I used to think had this bipolar<br/>
thing, but I&#39;ve come to the realization recently that<br/>
that&#39;s not it at all but something much different and<br/>
deeper. My mom&#39;s not had a trace of it at all that I<br/>
could ever tell. Me and two of my sisters could be<br/>
poster girls for the bipolar association if there is<br/>
such a thing. Especially me and my younger sis. I&#39;ll<br/>
tell you from my own experience, that I have ALWAYS<br/>
felt this way, since I was little. I used to cry when<br/>
my dad sang &quot;you are my sunshine&quot; and actually MADE<br/>
him never sing it anymore cuz I couldn&#39;t handle it cuz<br/>
it was &quot;just too depressing&quot;. Don&#39;t ask me how I knew<br/>
what depressing was, but I remember thinking all the<br/>
time that things were depressing and really knowing<br/>
what I meant by that. There have been brief times in<br/>
my adult life that I am at the very bottom of a very<br/>
depressing day and when you are there you really see<br/>
know way out and you act like a different person and<br/>
your friends and family wonder if you are on drugs and<br/>
you can hear yourself being a b*tch to them and you<br/>
feel bad but you don&#39;t have it in you to act<br/>
differently that day. or that hour, rather. And at a<br/>
couple of those times I have thought, I wish I would<br/>
just have some medication to make this go away and<br/>
I&#39;ll be normal. But those moments are fleeting and me<br/>
and my boyfriend have discussed this many times, cuz<br/>
his family (bipolar wise anyway) is the same way and<br/>
he is and in their family they are all just so<br/>
comfortable and accepting of the condition and the<br/>
fact that at any given moment one of them could be<br/>
having a &quot;low&quot; or a &quot;high&quot; (though theirs are for a<br/>
few dayz at a time, not changing several times in one<br/>
day sometimes)...and it&#39;s just like if someone had<br/>
diabetes or high blood pressure or arthritis...and<br/>
they work around it. In our family we all recognize it<br/>
and accept it but we worry about each other when we<br/>
see one of us getting down, cuz of the extreme<br/>
experiences we&#39;ve had with the boyz. But I have to<br/>
EMPHASIZE that their problems (bipolar or<br/>
manic-depressive or whatever) are only soooo extreme<br/>
cuz of their alcohol and drug use and I would NOT<br/>
anticipate that for your daughter...she sounds like my<br/>
little sister who to this very day is the moodiest,<br/>
most dramatic and sensitive person I know. Regardless<br/>
of any bipolar disorder. It&#39;s her personality. And<br/>
she&#39;s VERY defensive of people saying she&#39;s too<br/>
dramatic or sensitive. But she has been working on it<br/>
alot. She would be that dramatic and moody and upset<br/>
over things like that when she was younger, JUST like<br/>
your daughter. She sucked her thumb til she was like<br/>
11, and the only harm it did her (besides my<br/>
tormenting her) was that she sucked sooo hard it<br/>
pulled her teeth out a bit for a slight overbite but a<br/>
small price to pay, I say, for the comfort it brought<br/>
her (and she had great relationship with both our<br/>
parents and felt very loved by them, still does), and<br/>
when she sucked her thumb she had to have her favorite<br/>
blue blanket with &quot;soft&quot; on the edge (or any blanket<br/>
with &quot;soft&quot;, if the blue one wasn&#39;t available) and she<br/>
ran the &quot;soft&quot; in and out of her fingers while she<br/>
sucked her thumb and watched tv or whatever she was<br/>
doing...especially going to sleep. She just recently<br/>
had to get rid of the blue blanket (I think we buried<br/>
a dog with it or something) and she has now a little<br/>
yellow baby blanket that she found at a second hand<br/>
store and it was JUST like her old one, only smaller<br/>
(the blue one was a king size or something) ...the new<br/>
ones they make don&#39;t have REAL &quot;soft&quot; on them...just<br/>
some scratchy stuff...and she takes the new yellow one<br/>
with her when she travels or sleeps somewhere<br/>
else...when we go to the movies with my kids I wrap<br/>
the kids in it and she hangs on to the corner of<br/>
it...I think it&#39;s perfectly healthy...she&#39;s 21, by the<br/>
way. And she has never been on any medication and I<br/>
think the only damage that has ever been done to any<br/>
of us from this is feeling like there is something<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; with us that&#39;s embarrassing in some way and<br/>
not just adapting our lives on a purely day to day<br/>
basis according to how everyone is feeling. <br/>
Oh my ex husband had the same problems and ADHD if you<br/>
believe in such a condition. (I do) and I&#39;m sure my<br/>
kids have a bit of the signs now and will continue to.<br/>
I try to just act like it&#39;s normal to feel that way<br/>
and unless they are hurting someone else then I&#39;ll<br/>
treat it the same way as if they were anemic. I&#39;m not<br/>
saying that&#39;s for everyone though, cuz like I said I<br/>
think medication was the right thing for my dad. And<br/>
lots of other people to. But it is overrated and<br/>
overdone and sometimes not prescribed properly. My<br/>
advice? hm. Am I even qualified to give any? :)<br/>
I&#39;d say try reading alot about child psychology and<br/>
not just bipolar things and try to find the best way<br/>
for your family for you to talk to her about it...<br/>
just ask her how she feels. How she feels sometimes<br/>
when she&#39;s sad, or mad. (But do it when she&#39;s haveing<br/>
a &quot;good&quot; day, maybe? I don&#39;t know) She&#39;ll most likely<br/>
be embarrassed by this though. I was anyway. Talking<br/>
about any feelings with my parents at that age...<br/>
but it might help if you tell her YOU feel sad or mad<br/>
sometimes just for the heck of it. And that&#39;s totally<br/>
ok. Tell her you aren&#39;t mad at her or hurt by what she<br/>
said about BB, and maybe tell her about something you<br/>
were/are attached to from childhood. If she doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to talk about it, my honest advice is to not try<br/>
to make her talk if she REALLY doesn&#39;t want to, but<br/>
DON&#39;T act as though there is something to be hidden,<br/>
or NOT talked about and don&#39;t treat her like she is<br/>
fragile, cuz that may make her feel more on the spot<br/>
if she just wants to feel like a &quot;normal&quot; kid. Then if<br/>
it gets worse or maybe if you feel it&#39;s worse right<br/>
now, then see about a child counseler for her to see.<br/>
Sounds expensive, but so is medicating and this may<br/>
help in a more long term way.. there are sliding scale<br/>
places too, and ones that target talking to the WHOLE<br/>
family so she doens&#39;t feel singled out and everyone<br/>
else can be helped to deal with what&#39;s going on. <br/>
<br/>
As far as your feelings being hurt. I know mine would<br/>
be. I just want my kids to like me and think I&#39;m cool.<br/>
:) I used to have that going for me, but my boyfriend<br/>
has taken my place in the coolness department now and<br/>
they love me to death, I know, but I&#39;m not really<br/>
considered &quot;fun&quot; anymore. <br/>
They&#39;ll get over it. .....<br/>
or they&#39;ll be in trouble.<br/>
(joking again, sorry.)<br/>
I hope this long long long reply helps a little bit<br/>
and really bipolar is not that scary, unless it<br/>
reaches really psychotic levels... I think it is a<br/>
REALLY good sign that she can calm herself and knows<br/>
how to do so without infringing on anyone else. <br/>
Oh yeah, my son chews on EVERYTHING...I don&#39;t know<br/>
what it is but he goes through these spurts of chewing<br/>
on all his shirts, socks, toys, blankets, his<br/>
hands...I&#39;ve been meaning to look into some<br/>
psychological reasons for it. Anyone having any input<br/>
there is very more that welcome to share...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919276228">!!!!!<br/>
you know...<br/>
I..I just..<br/>
I love you. Can I say that? :)<br/>
Yeah I can. I at least love this post. I&#39;ve been<br/>
reading everyone else&#39;s responses to Juli and I feel<br/>
like mine is almost not worth reading with its sheer<br/>
confusing personal stories. <br/>
But what you said in another post about not even<br/>
noting if you son had stopped chewing or not. It was<br/>
lovely. <br/>
And this whole entire post is just the best one I can<br/>
think you could&#39;ve given. You did not dismiss they<br/>
possibility of calling it &quot;manic&quot; or what not, but did<br/>
not call it that either, as though it was a condition<br/>
to be treated. <br/>
To say it&#39;s not unnatural, and describing your own<br/>
experience as a REGULAR person with ups and downs...<br/>
are alot like my own experience and I had not really<br/>
thought about the sleep/energy thing in regards to<br/>
this before, but as a seperate &quot;problem&quot;.<br/>
( I was sitting here going &quot;yeah!&quot; &quot;me too!&quot;, etc<br/>
etc...I&#39;ll be questioned in a minute) <br/>
I agree with absolutely everything you said here and I<br/>
envy your kids. <br/>
I&#39;m sure their friends do, too. <br/>
My friends envied me cuz my parents were laid back and<br/>
I hardly got invited anywhere cuz they all wanted to<br/>
come to MY house...cuz my parents would let us eat<br/>
when we were hungry and whatever we wanted that we<br/>
could find and get dirty and all those things and I<br/>
think you must be a much more modernized version of<br/>
that, but doing it everso consciously and I love it. <br/>
It truly sets a beautiful example for those of us who<br/>
strive to be that way all the time. Thankyou very<br/>
much.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To Juli about Aubrey,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The good thing about homeschooling is that Aubrey<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t HAVE teachers and <br/>
&gt; counselors and other kids making her moods worse, or<br/>
&gt; spotlighting them, or <br/>
&gt; praising her for being &quot;up&quot; (or acting like it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; their superior teaching and <br/>
&gt; counseling abilities that &quot;caused&quot; the happiness).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would recommend dealing gently with Aubrey in the<br/>
&gt; moment.  It&#39;s possible <br/>
&gt; that the dye and bacteria aren&#39;t as bad as the<br/>
&gt; shaming and pressure.   Do you <br/>
&gt; re-use toothbrushes or get a new one every day?  (Or<br/>
&gt; boil them?)  People do <br/>
&gt; &quot;recycle&quot; their own bacteria pretty often, from<br/>
&gt; drinking glasses, coffeecups, <br/>
&gt; all kinds of things.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When she&#39;s down or agitated or depressed, the fact<br/>
&gt; that you DO know it&#39;s the <br/>
&gt; low of a cycle and she&#39;ll come back up in a few days<br/>
&gt; or weeks should make it <br/>
&gt; easy for you to accept that she just kinda might<br/>
&gt; need to be left alone or at <br/>
&gt; her own chosen level of interaction.   When she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; active and zippy and <br/>
&gt; smiley, don&#39;t make a big deal about that<br/>
&gt; either--just appreciate it, and <br/>
&gt; maybe encourage her to get some things done (room<br/>
&gt; cleaning? projects?  having <br/>
&gt; friends visit?  I&#39;m thinking of examples from other<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s lives) that <br/>
&gt; might be harder to do when she&#39;s down (temporarily,<br/>
&gt; next time).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kirby has mood problems more than anyone else in our<br/>
&gt; family except me.  So <br/>
&gt; because I was that way as a kid too, I teach him<br/>
&gt; tricks which nobody thought <br/>
&gt; to teach me.  How to breathe through frustration and<br/>
&gt; rising fury, and to <br/>
&gt; remember that you have to pick up what you throw,<br/>
&gt; and clean up what you <br/>
&gt; break.  (When he was younger, he would throw things<br/>
&gt; down when he was <br/>
&gt; angry--like remote controls for video games, or<br/>
&gt; decks of cards.  He quit <br/>
&gt; doing that before long because we would calmly point<br/>
&gt; out what his options had <br/>
&gt; been--to breathe, set them down, and then walk<br/>
&gt; away.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What I&#39;ve told Kirby (when he&#39;s receptive) is that<br/>
&gt; he will probably be that <br/>
&gt; way his whole life, so he needs to learn to feel it<br/>
&gt; coming and make <br/>
&gt; allowances for it.  When he&#39;s in a depressed or<br/>
&gt; frustrated state, he needs to <br/>
&gt; arrange to be by himself a little more, and realize<br/>
&gt; that it&#39;s HIM and not all <br/>
&gt; the people and things around him, and that he won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stay there, that way, for <br/>
&gt; long.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s lucky to be homeschooled and have the luxury of<br/>
&gt; not having to interact <br/>
&gt; with a random bunch of outside people whether he<br/>
&gt; wants to or not, when he&#39;s <br/>
&gt; in a low phase.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m lucky that I recognized some of his &quot;symptoms&quot;<br/>
&gt; and could share tricks <br/>
&gt; with him that help our whole family now, and will<br/>
&gt; help him always.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Trying to drug a child (except in TOTALLY extreme<br/>
&gt; cases, which sometimes are <br/>
&gt; caused by overreaction to mild cases) or change them<br/>
&gt; or wish the biochemical <br/>
&gt; realities away will add stress to an already<br/>
&gt; stressful situation.  Kids don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; act consistently and don&#39;t need to.   Parents can<br/>
&gt; learn to roll with the <br/>
&gt; waves, and help the kids do it too.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Bi-polar&quot; or &quot;manic depressive&quot; comes in all<br/>
&gt; degrees.  I realized in my 20&#39;s <br/>
&gt; that there were periods of time (not consistent<br/>
&gt; lengths, but a week or three, <br/>
&gt; varying) that I could work really late, get up<br/>
&gt; early, be clear and quick and <br/>
&gt; work overtime and visit all my friends and read and<br/>
&gt; remember things (zip, <br/>
&gt; zip, zip), and then a week or two that I fell asleep<br/>
&gt; early three or four <br/>
&gt; nights in a row, couldn&#39;t concentrate well, was<br/>
&gt; short tempered, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having a consistent schedule every day did *not*<br/>
&gt; help.  I was restless in the <br/>
&gt; manic phases (if they can be called that without<br/>
&gt; people freaking out here) <br/>
&gt; and too tired in the downtimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s like a larger-scale cycle of sleeping<br/>
&gt; and wakefulness--it&#39;s like <br/>
&gt; a cycle of brain growth (especially in kids!!)<br/>
&gt; followed by a quieter time <br/>
&gt; (quieter in speed, noise, growth).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is not unnatural.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<br>
<br>I have been through this with my 11 year old son also.
<br>I was told to start educating myself.
<br>Bipolar will scare the pants off of a parent, who isn&#39;t
<br>knowledgeable with this term.
<br>
<br>YOU WILL NEED TO LOOK AT BIPOLAR YOURSELF IN ORDER
<br>TO SEE IF IT EVEN FITS YOUR CHILD.
<br>
<br>Never accept any schools, or anyones opinion on &quot;what your
<br>child may have&quot; until you have weighed the info yourself.
<br>
<br>Be very careful if you seek a doctors help, let him figure it out,
<br>I wouldn&#39;t share any possible labels with him upfront.
<br>
<br>Also, there was I book I purchased Called The Out-of Sync Child by
<br>Carol Stock Kranowitz, M.A.
<br>
<br>My husband was diagnosed bi-polar, and I am not so sure the doctor
<br>was right. I know that bi-polar can be heriditary, so I also thought
<br>that my son was also. &nbsp;The situations that you mention, are similar
<br>to what my son has gone through.
