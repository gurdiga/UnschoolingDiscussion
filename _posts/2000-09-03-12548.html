<br/>
&gt;it wasnt just a frustrating day, i get this way occasionally, am i the only <br/>
&gt;one?  especially when the school year begins and my dd wants &quot;homework&quot; and <br/>
&gt;everyone else has such a neat &quot;plan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, Erin, you are not the only one who feels this way sometimes! I had<br/>
wanted to respond to your post (I am correct in remembering it was &quot;whine&quot;<br/>
right?), but I got sidetracked and the earlier mail got deleted. I copied<br/>
it and sent it to a friend and we both empathized with you. We can<br/>
DEFINITELY understand those feelings, especially at this time of year when<br/>
other homeschoolers are getting full swing into their &quot;wonderful&quot; unit<br/>
studies and curriculum plans and have to tell you all about them. Then<br/>
there&#39;s the back-to-school thing. (We won&#39;t even go there!) Unschooling is<br/>
hard sometimes because it requires a lot of faith and a lot of<br/>
spur-of-the-moment creativity, and a lot of paying attention and quick<br/>
changes in plans when the kids&#39; interests change. And so much of its value<br/>
can&#39;t be pinned down on paper and it won&#39;t be evident for years. Then I am<br/>
usually reassured by some small glimmer of real learning, when it peeks<br/>
out, that unschooling REALLY does work. But, oh those days of doubt in<br/>
between glimmers can be hard!<br/>
<br/>
So, I am glad you posted what we all feel at times.<br/>

I hope you had that hidden tape recorder ready to record DH&#39;s<br/>
pro-unschooling comments to save them for later. LOL My husband can be<br/>
supportive in one breath, then turn around and tell ds that he needs to do<br/>
more math practice or he&#39;ll need to go to school. Well, he is TRYING to<br/>
become more supportive...<br/>
<br/>
As far as unschooling support goes within local homeschool groups, I have<br/>
met quite a few people who would like to be more unschoolish but just can&#39;t<br/>
quite go there. I admit, if questioned by a non-homeschooler (and some<br/>
homeschoolers too) about what we are doing for &quot;schoolwork&quot;, I usually<br/>
sidestep the issue by saying we are &quot;going with my son&#39;s interests&quot; and<br/>
&quot;doing a lot of hands-on activities&quot; or that I obtained the local school<br/>
curriculum. (Of course I don&#39;t say we are actually following it!) I am<br/>
usually too chicken to use the &quot;unschooling&quot; word. But this is only our<br/>
second official year homeschooling, so maybe someday I&#39;ll utter that &quot;u&quot;<br/>
word in public. Ha, ha... <br/>
<br/>
When talking to other homeschoolers I usually first assess their<br/>
perspectives on learning before I disclose our approach. One thing that is<br/>
discouraging is when another homschooler tells me that they cannot attend<br/>
some great activity or arrange a play date because a certain time slot<br/>
(usually 8-12 AM) is reserved for school work and they don&#39;t leave the<br/>
house during that time. I first think &quot;that&#39;s too bad&quot;, then I think<br/>
&quot;should I be doing that or my child will be uneducated in comparison?&quot;<br/>
Although I realize that wouldn&#39;t work for us anyway, even if I ever wanted<br/>
to schedule our lives like that. But I do experience these confusing and<br/>
conflicting feelings about our way of learning. <br/>
<br/>
It is funny to read about your daughter&#39;s excitement over the novelty of<br/>
the history class. I think if it was an everyday thing the excitement would<br/>
wear off pretty quickly. I was surprised when ds recently asked for math<br/>
flashcards. I nearly did a double-take. This is a kid who HATES every term<br/>
related to &quot;school&quot;. So, we bought him some triangle flash cards. I don&#39;t<br/>
think he&#39;ll really use them beyond the the day we bought them. (I am afraid<br/>
he is like me: planning and shopping for educational supplies is more<br/>
exciting than actually using them!) I guess we all go through stages in our<br/>
lives when our need for structure ebbs and flows. At least with unschooling<br/>
you can allow yourself to ebb occasionally, whereas in school you always<br/>
have to go with their flow. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;ty olivia.  nice to know someone empathized with my decidedly on-topic post! <br/>
&gt;haha!  some topics are more interesting than others...  do you have have <br/>
&gt;unschooling support where you live or a pro-unschooling spouse?  tonite at <br/>
&gt;dinner, i heard dh make some comments that could be construed as supportive <br/>
&gt;of unschooling!  i was delighted, but acted calm!  :)  i still get somewhat <br/>
&gt;uncomfortable at trying to explain/defend our unschooling to anyone, esp <br/>
&gt;other homeschoolers...   <br/>
&gt;my dd(10.11) is has just begun taking a history class once a wk w/other <br/>
&gt;hmschoolers and it is much too schooly (style) for my taste.  but she is so <br/>
&gt;thrilled with being assigned homework, presentations, etc.  she is extremely <br/>
&gt;motivated, taking it all very seriously, and says, &quot;mom!  now i&#39;ll finally <br/>
&gt;get to use those homework tips i read about it my american girl magazine!&quot;  <br/>
&gt;LOL!  it is so funny to watch her... the novelty of it all, having been <br/>
&gt;unschooled her whole life-- it is &quot;fun&quot; to her, so far...<br/>
