You&#39;re right about Anakin killing the emperor.<br/>
But for some reason, in my mind Luke is the hero.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the crush I had on Mark Hamill from so long ago. :-)<br/>

  &gt; It&#39;s all coming back to me now. And in a way, Anakin<br/>
  &gt; was a vital piece of the puzzle to bring balance,<br/>
  &gt; being Luke&#39;s father, the real chosen one. (right?)<br/>
  &gt; I think it&#39;s time for another Star Wars marathon -<br/>
  &gt; it&#39;s been too long. :-D<br/>

<br/>
My friend, Merry, and I found we had a weirdness in common:  We both liked<br/>
Ringo best, and couldn&#39;t stand Paul.  Same with the Monkees:  We liked<br/>
Mickey best, couldn&#39;t stand whichever one was the cutiepie  -- Davy?<br/>
Drummers rule.<br/>
<br/>
These weren&#39;t teen crushes, of course; more like 2nd grade in the case of<br/>
the Beatles (remember the cartoon show??), and 5th grade for the Monkees.<br/>
David Cassidy, Bobby Sherman, the Archies, those guys were 6th grade and I<br/>
HATED &#39;em.  My first celebrity crush was Chad Everett.<br/>
<br/>
Star Wars was college era for me... Han Solo, sigh.<br/>
<br/>
And I married a guy who looked like Gilligan.  (Well, that was my first<br/>
impression &lt;g&gt;  Don&#39;t tell!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really should be doing laundry and baking cookies right now!<br/>

school...bleah.)</div>

<br/>
I went for nobility and duty.   Strider/Aragorn.  Henry V.  Charlton Heston <br/>
in El Cid.  I didn&#39;t care what they looked like as long as their ideals were <br/>
lofty and they were steadfast.   Which Beatle did I like best?  John Lennon.<br/>
<br/>
In real life I went for musicians--usually the lead guitar players. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Ended up marrying a madrigal singer guy who can&#39;t play guitar.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130162551">Simply by looks, Ringo. But I don&#39;t know much of anything about the Beatles<br/>
(if I tried hard, I could maybe name 3 songs, remember I am just a baby at<br/>
35. &lt;g&gt;) so I can&#39;t swear to stick with that in a court of law.<br/>

<br/>
My favorite Beatle was/is Paul. <br/>
I think music from the Wings helped form my opinion.<br/>
I get much more from the Paul/Linda relationship than I did from the John/Yoko one.<br/>

Well -- he&#39;s Strider, moreso than Aragorn, in the first movie.  Patience -- I <br/>
predict he&#39;ll grow.  He looked a lot like Strider to me ;-)<br/>
