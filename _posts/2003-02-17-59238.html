<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844183939">What an unschooler won&#39;t go through to obtain the optimal environment for <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
A friend has given us a LONG mobile home which needs some repairs.  All in <br/>
all we would have passed on this, the amount of work ahead of us is daunting <br/>
but the spot where it&#39;s parked is incredible.<br/>
<br/>
In a LITTLE town called Beavercreek (near Portland), all around us is forest. <br/>
 Across the driveway is a meadow complete with beaver pond and downstream is <br/>
the dam and resident beavers.<br/>
<br/>
The folks who owned the home before us were home schoolers (relaxed), the <br/>
family 100 yards up the road are home schoolers (also relaxed).  The other <br/>
neighbors are friendly and kind to children.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile the kids are learning the meaning of words like dry rot, <br/>
sub-flooring, floor joist, oriented strand board and the use of tools like <br/>
wrecking bars, reciprocating saws and clutch drills.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan may have discovered his calling, &quot;deconstruction&quot;.  After hours of <br/>
hammering, pounding and scraping yesterday he was begging to go again today.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m dreaming of the hours of lazy exploration for both kids, a yard in which <br/>
to build a &quot;club house&quot; and being neighbors with all the wild life there; <br/>
coyotes, hawks, osprey, deer, raccoon, beavers, nutria and more.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ve landed in heaven.  Funny how the things we <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have chosen before kids entered our lives become so vital to our own <br/>
happiness after they do.<br/>

Oh shoot, you&#39;re moving in???? I was so hoping you were going to say you <br/>
would fix it up and maybe rent it out. Sounds like the perfect vacation spot <br/>
for us. That&#39;s one thing I do miss down here. Actual wildlife that doesn&#39;t <br/>
include vultures and lizards!!! It does sound like heaven. Enjoy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, we&#39;re hoping to buy a motor home soon which would be a perfect spot for <br/>
friends from out of town to stay.  It would be great to meet folks I&#39;ve known <br/>
online when they come to our neck of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
It is like a vacation spot, we&#39;ve been saying it feels like we&#39;re camping.  <br/>
Every night the frogs sing in the meadow and it reminds me of camping by the <br/>
lake when I was a kid.<br/>
