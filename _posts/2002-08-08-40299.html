<div id="ygrps-yiv-466102491">Oops. I meant to say the that whole period after Solomon&#39;s empire broke<br/>
up was that of the prophets. Solomon built an empire rich in material<br/>
ways and mingled with the customs of foreign wives and vassal nations.<br/>
BY time he was done the spiritual life of the nation of Israel was<br/>
already deteriorated.  That&#39;s when Jews left the ways of the Torah,<br/>
mingled them with other pagan ways, and the kingdoms were destroyed and<br/>
the Jews taken captive by the Assyrians and later the Babylonians.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard it said that when a society appears to be at its strongest,<br/>
it is already falling. Its the force of material vs spiritual. And here<br/>
I speak of individual spiritual values and actions; they are often<br/>
strongest when a religion is growing, and when it reaches it so-called<br/>
peak it may already be stagnating due too the taking over the individual<br/>
responsibilities and responses by some organized group that supposedly<br/>
acts and speaks for all.<br/>
<br/>
The precarious balance of individual vs group, and attempts to<br/>
peacefully and co-operatively maintain a social culture and activity<br/>
with varying views of those within it. School &quot;culture&quot; vs home culture,<br/>
should we do stuff with our kids all the time or leave them to work it<br/>
out themselves, who should speak for homeschoolers? We could all speak<br/>
for ourselves, but co-ordination makes a bigger impact - then who&#39;ll<br/>
watch and decide, how to keep the group from overwhelming the<br/>
individual? And how to manage the material while not falling prey to its<br/>
seduction but keeping our values regards what is most worthwhile in<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
We have a very philosophical discussion group here really, these are<br/>
some of the big questions of life - ;)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;David moved the capital for the first time to Jerusalem (after battling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>its pagan inhabitants). He had the strong backing of the tribe of Judah<br/>
(from whence comes the name of the religion: Judaism) but united and<br/>
ruled all the Israelites  in their lands as king. and conquered<br/>
neighboring land too expanded his kingdom. His son Solomon expanded it<br/>
even further as an Empire, ruling neighboring lands. After Solomon&#39;s<br/>
death, Israel and Judea split apart again and the rest of the tribes<br/>
took sides with them. They were rivaling kingdoms until Israel fell to<br/>
the Assyrians. About 45 years later, Judah was taken by the Assyrians as<br/>
well. This whole period was that of the prophets.<br/>
