Anything could happen in 2 years: he could decide he&#39;s not interested in taking exams; he might find himself very motivated to learn handwriting: he might develop skills that make it easy for him to learn handwriting. Or you can apply for him to do a typed exam.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t need to practice handwriting for two years just to take an exam two years early.<br><br>In my experience, if a child says they want to learn a thing but then resist trying, it means they think they ought to be able to do the thing but don&#39;t really want to. Maybe you could look at ways of reassuring him that he will be able to learn, that he&#39;d doing fine as he is. And then do things that support pen control, rather than handwriting. Get him a notepad or sketchbook and some pencils or pens so he can draw or take notes when he&#39;s on the computer. Play pictionary or hangman or Operation with him; buy some window pens and draw patterns on the windows, use the stylus to play Fruit Ninja.<br><br><br>Bernadette.<br><div class="ygrps-yiv-2048694111gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-2048694111gmail_quote">On 13 July 2017 at 12:19, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joannefielding@...">joannefielding@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2048694111gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">
