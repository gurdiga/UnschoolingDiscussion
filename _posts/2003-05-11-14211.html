<div id="ygrps-yiv-377968544">**The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes is one story that too few people have heard or<br/>
read <br/>
and fewer still really think about. **<br/>
<br/>
My absolutely favorite telling of this is in Mandy Patinkin&#39;s new CD,<br/>
Kidults. He covers several songs from the movie Hans Christian Andersen in<br/>
it (Danny Kaye starred and sang in that one), including the Ugly Duckling<br/>
and Inchworm. His redo of the King&#39;s New Clothes is in a medley with<br/>
Everybody Says Don&#39;t (by Sondheim) and is a great description of<br/>
unschooling! Here are the lyrics to Everybody Says Don&#39;t:<br/>
<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t <br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t right, <br/>
Don&#39;t, it isn&#39;t nice.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t <br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t walk on the grass,<br/>
Don&#39;t disturb the peace,<br/>
Don&#39;t skate on the ice.<br/>
<br/>
Well I say do! I say,<br/>
Walk on the grass, it was meant to feel.<br/>
I say, sail! Tilt at the windmill<br/>
And if you fail you fail.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t get out of line<br/>
When they say that then, lady that&#39;s a sign<br/>
Nine times out of ten,<br/>
Lady you&#39;re doing just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Make just a ripple, come on be brave<br/>
This time a ripple, next time a wave!<br/>
Sometimes you have to start small, <br/>
Climbing the tiniest wall -<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re going to fall<br/>
But it is better than not starting at all.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody says no, stop,<br/>
Mustn&#39;t rock the boat, mustn&#39;t touch a thing<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says wait<br/>
Everybody says can&#39;t fight city-hall<br/>
Can&#39;t laugh at the King.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I say do, I say,<br/>
Laugh at the King, or he&#39;ll make you cry<br/>
Lose your poise<br/>
Fall if you have to, but lady make a noise!<br/>
<br/>
Yes!<br/>
Everybody says don&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says can&#39;t<br/>
Everybody says wait around for miracles<br/>
That&#39;s the way the world is made<br/>
I insist on miracles<br/>
If you do then, miracles, nothing to them<br/>
I say don&#39;t...<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid!<br/>
<br/>
