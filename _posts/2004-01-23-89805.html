<div id="ygrps-yiv-319885326">I was at a wharehouse store the other night and saw that they had a <br/>
large section of workbooks (curriculum), from pre-K to 6th grade.  I <br/>
picked one up because my DD wanted to look at it (she&#39;s 2.5 and <br/>
liked the animals on the front cover).  <br/>
<br/>
By the time that we got to the check out, I decided to buy if for <br/>
her because she was calling it a coloring book and was actually <br/>
making up stories to go along with the pictures. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had it for a few days now and mostly she has just colored in <br/>
it and continued to &quot;read&quot; to me from it based on what the pictures <br/>
are on the page.  <br/>
<br/>
Today, I have to admit, that she surprised me.  We were coloring and <br/>
the page was one where there were colored crayons on one side and <br/>
pictures on the other and you were supposed to draw a line to match <br/>
the pictures with the crayons....I hope that makes sense?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she points to the leaf and says that it&#39;s green and then <br/>
draws a line from the leaf to the green crayon!  She proceeds to do <br/>
the same with the other pictures on the page (getting them all <br/>
correct, by the way).  Then, she got bored with that and fliped the <br/>
page and continued to color.  <br/>
<br/>
I never told her what to do with the workbook and had only gotten it <br/>
so that she would have a really big coloring book but.....guess she <br/>
learned dispite me!  :-)<br/>
