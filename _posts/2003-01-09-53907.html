<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381485560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Today on another <br/>
&gt;board, someone spoke of the unschoolers she knows as being<br/>
&gt;poorly dressed, unhealthy emotionally, unprepared for life and<br/>
&gt;the homes of these families as being chaotic and dirty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>:::snip:::<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you deal with these broad stereotypes about unschooling?<br/>
&gt;What do you say to them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just tell them that the unschoolers I know are no more poorly dressed,<br/>
emotionally unhealthy, or unprepared for life than any other group. I also<br/>
tell them I think it&#39;s silly to judge anyone on how they dress, and on<br/>
points two and three I find unschoolers above the average, not below.<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t post it for the benefit of the (you&#39;ll excuse the expression)<br/>
yahoo who actually spewed that kind of crappola, I&#39;d post it for the benefit<br/>
of people who aren&#39;t having some kind of knee-jerk defense reaction against<br/>
unschooling and might be reading the same boards.<br/>
<br/>
Be calm, state what your own experiences are, and trust the folks who do<br/>
have a few particles of sense to rub together to make an intelligent<br/>
judgment on her scenario vs. yours.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also give out helpful websites like www.unschooling.com and encourage<br/>
those interested in learning about the realities of unschooling to visit<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, there is a fairly popular philosophy that kids do better when<br/>
&gt;pushed to perform (think of the strict teacher or the intense<br/>
&gt;football coach, or the passionate and demanding theater<br/>
&gt;director). Have you found that your kids generate enough<br/>
&gt;self-motivation to achieve their goals? Do you urge completion of<br/>
&gt;projects? Do you provide outside motivation (by coaching or<br/>
&gt;pushing) when the child has expressed interest in a certain<br/>
&gt;area?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t push them to achieve their goals. They&#39;re their goals, not mine, and<br/>
it&#39;s not my business to push them (that would be pushy! &lt;g&gt; And rude, too.)<br/>
I do try my best to give them the kind of support that will help them,<br/>
though -- whether that&#39;s money or car rides or listening to them yammer on<br/>
about their newest interest or whatever they seem to need at the time.<br/>
<br/>
But when I start pushing, it becomes my goal, not theirs. I have enough<br/>
goals of my own that I don&#39;t need to live vicariously through my girls.<br/>
<br/>
If they have a coach or whatever who is pushy and they still want to stick<br/>
with them, I&#39;m fine with that. If they don&#39;t like that style of coaching,<br/>
I&#39;m fine with them quitting.<br/>

of people who aren&#39;t having some kind of knee-jerk defense reaction against<br/>
unschooling and might be reading the same boards. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is an important part of the considerations on just about every board.<br/>
<br/>
When someone comes in here and says &quot;I force phonics on my children and <br/>
they&#39;re all well-adjusted early readers,&quot; if I make comments about people who <br/>
did NOT have phonics forced on them, it&#39;s because I&#39;m thinking about the <br/>
hundreds of others reading who are undecided.   I don&#39;t want people who are <br/>
not experienced unschoolers coming in here and setting their theories or <br/>
practices up as though they&#39;re just as valid within this discussion as those <br/>
of parents of kids who&#39;ve been unschooled for longer.  (Or who have been <br/>
unschooled, as it keeps happening that people who aren&#39;t even unschoolers and <br/>
admit they don&#39;t understand what unschooling is, still tell us how they&#39;ve <br/>
made their kids do this or that.)<br/>
<br/>
More often than not in ANY debate comments are intended for the audience, not <br/>
the person who made the original statement.<br/>
<br/>
So when someone comes here new and says &quot;Everyone jumped on ME and they hate <br/>
ME!&quot; they get twice as grumpy when the background response is &quot;Who?&quot;  Because <br/>
it is the issue and idea that&#39;s being discussed, not the person.  And that&#39;s <br/>
truly hard to get when people can&#39;t see their ideas as separate from <br/>
themselves.<br/>
