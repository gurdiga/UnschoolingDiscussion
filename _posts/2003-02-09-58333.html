I guess everyone has different ideas on how they want to homeschool, obviously, but to ask the school to be looking over your shoulder?         <br/>
 <br/>
 Our superintendent is really trying to rein in all the families who are looking at or choosing alternative ways of education.      He is also fighting charter schools and such,  he blames these schools and homeschoolers for all the problems that the district is having!           It scares me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keep in mind that these kinds of cyber schools differ a lot from place to<br/>
place.  We have one in BC that we&#39;ve been using for years.  The first 2<br/>
years there was absolutely no monitoring.  During the second year, the<br/>
government decided that if they were funding this thing they wanted &quot;proof&quot;<br/>
that the kids were learning.  The way it was handled, though, unschoolers<br/>
could still function.  You could send in anecdotal reports about what your<br/>
kids were doing rather than having to make them do certain things.  This<br/>
year, it&#39;s changed again.  The government decided for some weird reason to<br/>
fund them the same as regular public schools (even though their costs are<br/>
less) but they want more proof.  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll stay on next year.<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing ok this year, but that&#39;s because Lars is on an IEP and we<br/>
can still do basically what we want.  Even so, I think they&#39;ll want more<br/>
next year.  But the government has also started funding private school cyber<br/>
school programs (half funding, like most private schools in the province)<br/>
and there&#39;s one we might go with.  Wondertree has always been as close to<br/>
unschooling as possible, like a Sudbury school.  They&#39;ve worked out ways to<br/>
&quot;prove&quot; learning without interfering with what the kids are actually doing.<br/>
I&#39;m looking into it.  But we&#39;ve had the use of a computer all these years<br/>
that we wouldn&#39;t have had without the cyber school.  I think we&#39;ve gotten<br/>
some value for our taxes.<br/>
