<div id="ygrps-yiv-140516314">Forwarding this as requested.  The Home-ed laws in Ireland are <br/>
becoming tighter and tighter, and as case law tends to be what <br/>
rules, as it were, this is a very scary precedent, and needs fighting. <br/>
 Any help to Donal at the addy below, please!<br/>
Thanks for your indulgence,<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;This comes up quite often on the unschooling list I&#39;m on.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Tracy!<br/>
I wonder if you would mind putting my query re/ socialisation <br/>
studies<br/>
to your unschooling group?  Is it a U.S.A. group?  I&#39;m trying to<br/>
spread the net as wide as possible in the hope of  finding something<br/>
substantial. If you get any replies, I&#39;m at mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:donaloc@...">donaloc@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I hope you can help-<br/>
Warmest good wishes<br/>
Donal<br/>

Dear Group,<br/>
<br/>
We are extremely concerned about the verdict on Thursday in Chris<br/>
Best&#39;s case (in Ireland). The following letter was cc&#39;d to me: <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Dear<br/>
Debra, Many thanks for the email. Unfortunately the Judge decided<br/>
against us. She seemed to think that because William is a shy and<br/>
sensitive boy that it would be better for him to be in a place where<br/>
he can interact with other children - ie school. Personally I think<br/>
that school is one of the reasons why he has a problem interacting. <br/>
To<br/>
be honest I think that the Judge just couldn&#39;t bring herself to<br/>
dismiss the case and she just had to find something to justify her<br/>
decision. She couldn&#39;t do it t on the standard of education and so <br/>
she<br/>
did it on the socializing. The solicitor said afterwards that she was<br/>
very wrong in her decision so he is still behind us, and even the<br/>
reporters afterwards were saying that it didn&#39;t make sense. I hope to<br/>
get a copy of the Judgement which I will forward to HEN [Home<br/>
Education Network]. We are going to appeal the decision as I have<br/>
absolutely no intention of sending William to school against his<br/>
wishes. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We fear that the authorities will use &quot;socialisation&quot; as their excuse<br/>
in the future for insisting that &quot;every child&#39;s educational needs<br/>
would best be met in school&quot; .<br/>
<br/>
So we are investigating whether there is any research out there on <br/>
the<br/>
relative merits of socialisation in school and socialisation in the<br/>
home. Paula Rothermel, Amanda Petrie and Alan Thomas are all <br/>
being<br/>
contacted for their advice.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any ideas about lines of inquiry we could pursue, please<br/>
let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Bws<br/>
Donal<br/>
