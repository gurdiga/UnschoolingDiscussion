<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Renee<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my four and a half year old to a T.  Thomas is<br/>
hyperactive, hypersensative and we suspect SID, among<br/>
other things.  However, he has not been diagnosed with<br/>
anything in any way other than through my own<br/>
research.  We do know that he has asthma and multiple<br/>
allergy problems, including eggs, dairy, additives and<br/>
preservatives, nuts and other things.  I sometimes<br/>
wonder how much of his behavioral issues might be<br/>
related to undiagnosed allergies we have yet to<br/>
discover and we are looking into getting him some<br/>
comprehensive allergy testing once we get settled into<br/>
the Tri Cities.<br/>
<br/>
I too have to hold him a lot when he gets really<br/>
worked up, talk to him softly and explain over and<br/>
over what is and is not appropriate behavior.  I also<br/>
try to make him aware of the consequences of his<br/>
behavior.  Last month he nearly chopped off the end of<br/>
his baby brother&#39;s pinky finger (needing stitches)<br/>
while rough-housing with the shower door and refusing<br/>
to mind when asked repeatedly to stop.  I made a point<br/>
of making it VERY clear to him that he was responsible<br/>
for his brother&#39;s injury, so that he understood the<br/>
results of his actions.<br/>
<br/>
He also does not adjust well to changes in his<br/>
routine, and his behavior has been exhausting and<br/>
trying the last week, as we are in the middle of<br/>
moving and are staying with my brother and his family<br/>
(incluing Thomas&#39; favorite hyper/sensative mirror<br/>
image girl cousin who is 2 months younger than him.) <br/>
The two of them are quite a handfull, even without all<br/>
the other kids.  Since I am here alone and my husband<br/>
is still closing up the house and taking care of his<br/>
job transfer in Idaho, I am really tired, to put it<br/>
mildly.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My daughter has always been very intense like this. Her daily &quot;tantrums&quot; <br/>
 would last an hour or more, with her hypervenilating and sobbing &quot;I can&#39;t <br/>
 stop, help me stop.&quot; They often occured several times a day. Oh, how <br/>
 stressful! She&#39;s six now, and I still have to keep a close eye to know when <br/>
 she&#39;s overloaded. She&#39;s never been diagnosed with anything, and I prefer it <br/>
 that way, but my suspicions are that she has Sensory Integration Disorder. <br/>
 We&#39;ve removed dyes, etc., added cherry plum bach flower essences, etc., and <br/>
 they all helped, but didn&#39;t stop them. We&#39;ve practiced breathing techniques <br/>
 and everything.<br/>
 And it isn&#39;t just the bad stuff--even the good stuff--she&#39;s either flying <br/>
 high or sinking low. Has difficulty staying on an even keel--very different <br/>

    This is my dd. We removed dyes from her diet too. We also limit sugar but <br/>
not too much b/c then it becomes something to sneak. What does the cherry <br/>
plum bach flower do for your dd. I use rescue remedy for somehtings. I also <br/>
tried Calm Child,no difference. I also tried childrens Valerian for <br/>
bedtime(big troubles calming down to go to sleep) never worked. I would like <br/>
her to take liquid Cal/Mag but the battle could be worse than the benefits.<br/>
<br/>
   She will start w/ I can&#39;t stop moving,I can&#39;t fall asleep, then she gets <br/>
upset and her nose stuffs up and watch out your in for a ride. If you tell <br/>
her to take it easy or settle down she skyrockets ever more,this happens w/ a <br/>
simple fit during the day too. Last night I went around closing windows and <br/>
doors b/c she was fitting over something. I rode it out and she was fine in a <br/>
bit. The other night dh came home form walking the dog and heard her starting <br/>
w/ the nose thing,he silently walked back out and walked her some more. It <br/>
makes us tense too. Tough call as to soothe and calm or shut up and ride it <br/>
out. Sometimes soothing makes it worse in her case.<br/>
