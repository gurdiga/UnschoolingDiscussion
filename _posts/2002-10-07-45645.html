&lt;&lt;   Just curious is <br/>
 anyone else from Atlanta planning to attend the conference this <br/>
 weekend?  Also am I the only one attending with dh and preschoolers? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a support group in Atlanta, I will email someone and have them get <br/>
back to you. I am going right through Atlanta on my way to the <br/>
conference...someone in Canton offered to have me stay the night there on the <br/>
10th (on my way up) and the 15th (on my way home). It&#39;s a little out of the <br/>
way, but I can&#39;t do the whole drive in one day.<br/>
I will write them and find out who you should contact!!! Cool.<br/>
