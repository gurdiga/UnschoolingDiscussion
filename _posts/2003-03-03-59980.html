I dreamed about you, Tia.<br/>
<br/>
After hardly dreaming anything I remembered for many days, I dreamed last <br/>
night (when I was asleep in my own bed) that I was in BC and saw a barracks <br/>
with lights in the room at the left/west end, and went in and there was a <br/>
meeting of homeschoolers.  I went in and sat down on the side.  They were <br/>
looking at a video, maybe the Peter Kowalke video, or maybe a video of <br/>
someone they knew (just for a moment) who had been on TV talking about <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When there was a lull I said &quot;I was just here for a minute.  Sorry to <br/>
interrupt, but I was wondering if I could get the name of the yahoogroups <br/>
group for Canada.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
What a lame dream, huh?<br/>
<br/>
So, Tia, in a much more useful place to ask...  could I get that address?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I figured I should say something glowing there.<br/>
<br/>
I think you said there was also an unschooling list, not too active?  I <br/>
didn&#39;t want to pop in there before the conference for fear of political taint <br/>
or accidental effect.  I was kinda feeling that Star Wars prime directive <br/>
thing a little bit, perhaps. &lt;g&gt;  But now I&#39;ve already put a finger in the <br/>
time warp, might as well say &quot;cool, thanks!&quot;<br/>

It hasn&#39;t been going all that long, maybe a year.  It isn&#39;t very high<br/>
traffic, and a lot of us are also on hs-ca.<br/>

HEM, I am such a newbie, I just can&#39;t begin to describe it. I don&#39;t even know <br/>
what all the little abbreviations are , like LOL and &lt;g&gt; and dh and ds tho I <br/>
think I am figuring it out. And when the computer has a problem, I call my 7 <br/>
year old for help! <br/>

I used this computer for looking at pretty pictures of horses and dogs for 2 <br/>
years!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is hs-ca?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a list we started 6 or 7 years ago when we noticed that all the<br/>
homeschooling lists seemed to have a U.S. flavour.  We wanted a list that<br/>
would be for Canadian homeschoolers, though over the years we&#39;ve had a few<br/>
Americans here and there.  We&#39;ve even got Peggy, who I think is on this<br/>
list.<br/>
A blank message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:hs-ca-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">hs-ca-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> is the way to get on.<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty high traffic, chatty list.<br/>
