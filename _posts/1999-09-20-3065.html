    Money-At-Home.Com: New Web Site Helps Moms, Home Business<br/>
 Entrepreneurs, & Others Find Work-at-Home Opportunities & Jobs<br/>
<br/>
August 24, 1999 (INB) -- Money-At-Home.Com  &lt;http://www.money-at-<br/>
home.com/&gt; was an idea conceived by Andrea Taylor, a  mother  who<br/>
was looking to stay at home and not have to put her child in  day<br/>
care. She thought it would be great if she could help others  who<br/>
would also like to work at home, so she started Money-At-Home.Com<br/>
on June 24th, 1998. After just one year, her web site has  logged<br/>
nearly one million total hits and has recorded over 470,000 total<br/>
hits in the past 87 days alone. Most of  the  traffic  came  with<br/>
very little advertising. Money-At-Home.Com is fast  becoming  one<br/>
of the most visited  sites  for  people  who  are  interested  in<br/>
working at home and making money from home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Money-At-Home.Com offers a personal touch and provides  some  of<br/>
the best resources on the Internet for  anyone  wishing  to  work<br/>
from home,&quot; states owner and founder  Andrea  Taylor.  &quot;Money-At-<br/>
Home.Com is set on becoming the site to visit for  the  best  and<br/>
highest quality work-at-home resources, with  guarantees  on  all<br/>
our  products,  the  lowest  prices,  and   a   wide   array   of<br/>
opportunities to fit most lifestyles.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Money-At-Home.Com is about more than selling,  says  Taylor.  &quot;We<br/>
are also about giving. At  Money-At-Home.Com,  our  visitors  can<br/>
enjoy free advertising, free contests, and free expert advice for<br/>
their home businesses. They can access upcoming trade  shows  and<br/>
events, send free electronic  postcards,  and  utilize  our  free<br/>
reminder service.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Money-At-Home.Com is  in  tune  with  the  growing  trend  toward<br/>
telecommuting and the increased interest that Americans  have  in<br/>
working from home.<br/>
<br/>
Taylor invites companies that hires home workers to visit  Money-<br/>
At-Home.Com to post their job openings free of charge or to  send<br/>
an e-mail to &lt;mailto:AndreaTaylor@...&gt;.</div>
