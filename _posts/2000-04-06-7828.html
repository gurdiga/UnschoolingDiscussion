 </span></blockquote>Physiologically rare maybe but there can be a myriad of mitigating<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
If I were to have a fourth child I might well have to consider the<br/>
bottle.<br/>
My Multiple sclerosis is a battle and it is feasible that I would have<br/>
to give over the entire responsibility of feedings to someone else is a<br/>
very possible scenario.<br/>
But Hubbykins has been to the vets so I don&#39;t have to worry about that<br/>
;-)<br/>
<br/>
There are many valid reasons why nursing isn&#39;t a<br/>
possiblility...medications, other physical impediments, the need to earn<br/>
a wage where the employment situation doesn&#39;t permit you to take time to<br/>
pump or provide the facilities to store the pumped milk etc., etc.<br/>
