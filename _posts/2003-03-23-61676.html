 No you don&#39;t.<br/>
You&#39;ve let some school scare you into doing what they think is best.<br/>
If unschooling is the goal, then just DO it. Forget about the school, they <br/>
have NO power over you.<br/>
Find other unschoolers in your area to find out how to deal with officials. <br/>
You have convinced yourself you have to answer to the school and I highly <br/>
doubt that is the case at all.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
