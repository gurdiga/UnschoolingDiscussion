<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076042473">My daughter and I were talking today about how cool it would be to have one <br/>
of several possible birthdates this year.<br/>
<br/>
The 10th of any month this year will give a birthdate of X/10/10, at least <br/>
as we write it in the US.<br/>
<br/>
01/10/10 and 10/10/10 will be especially cool. 8/9/10 as well.<br/>

I love the many patterns found in numbers. My youngest child&#39;s birthday and <br/>
my husband&#39;s birthday and my birthday and our wedding anniversary all fall <br/>
on the same day of the week in any given year.<br/>

So they&#39;re all after February and there&#39;s not a Leap Year effect?<br/>
<br/>
I saved a 1971 calendar knowing it would be good again in 2010.  It  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work for just any calendar, but this was a Peter Max  <br/>
calendar.  I sold it on eBay for $36.  It will be good again in 2021,  <br/>
I think it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248405671">Annalise has her birthday on July 8.  Mine is exactly three weeks later, on July 29. Jeremiah&#39;s is exactly five weeks after mine, on September 2.  The leap year moves us all....the kids often have one party, four weeks after Lise&#39;s and four weeks before Jeremiah&#39;s.  They meet in the middle, so to speak, just after my birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Jim, with his February 20 birthday, might feel left out, except that, thanks to his eager mother and a dose of castor oil, he shares it with his own father.<br/>

the other day.<br/>
<br/>
(The real point of the story is that Jayn spontaneously noticed and grasped <br/>
the significance of the date conventions.)<br/>

<br/>
Isn&#39;t that a prime number thing? lol<br/>
<br/>
I love the little cubes for the days of the month on the Peter Max calendar.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to this post, I dug out a photo calendar I made for my daughter&#39;s <br/>
first full year - 1993. Yep, it corresponds with 2010! Fun with numbers, for <br/>
sure!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726803661">Our daughter&#39;s birthday is always exactly 2 weeks after my husband&#39;s <br/>
and mine is always exactly 3 weeks after hers. All in June and July. <br/>
When our dog was still alive it added to the coolness, because her <br/>
birthday was exactly 1 week before my husband&#39;s, making the spacing <br/>
1, 2, and 3 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We just gave my m-i-l a cool recycled home-made photo calendar from <br/>
1999 ~ it&#39;s good this year as well. Only the moon phases and dates <br/>
for non date specific holidays (Easter, etc) don&#39;t match.<br/>
<br/>
Dd was born in &#39;99, so her age is always the same as the last 2 <br/>
digits in the year before her birthday and one year more after her <br/>
birthday. Dh was born in 55 and will turn 55 this year.<br/>
<br/>
I love numbers and patterns too :-)<br/>
