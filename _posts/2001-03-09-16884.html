&lt;&lt; Yes...learning to write, print and spell can sometimes come before<br/>
 reading. My oldest taught herself how to spell her name, write her<br/>
 address and answer the phone in a professional manner at age 3 (I am<br/>
 hearing impaired) and was reading simple books before going to<br/>
 kindergarden. I had no choice...my ex-husband said at that time that<br/>
 Rebekah was not going to be homeschooled and that as a deaf person I was<br/>
 incapable of homeschooling. I wish now that I had had more backbone at<br/>
 that time to tell him to take a flying leap into the lake!<br/>

     Is it the other way around in school though? I cannot remember. I can&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315538168">Yes, I am USing now but only with the youngest one at age 10. My oldest<br/>
is almost 18 and lives with her dad in Medford, Oregon. She&#39;ll be<br/>
graduating from hs this year. The schools use phonics to get them to<br/>
start reading...bleech! Phonics makes it harder than it should be. <br/>
