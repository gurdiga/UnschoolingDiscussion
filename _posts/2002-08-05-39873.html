<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936108937"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But we did spend <br/>
&gt; a lot of time in doctor&#39;s waiting rooms, or car dealerships or church or<br/>
&gt; wherever, and capitalized on the fact that there&#39;s rarely much else to<br/>
&gt; do in those places except read or point out letters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to laugh at this, Tuck, not because it&#39;s not a great idea to point out<br/>
letters at these places.  Only because that&#39;s not what occurred to *me* at<br/>
such places.  My son used to associate going to the doctor with clapping<br/>
rhymes like Miss Mary Mack, Peas Porrige Hot, etc. because that&#39;s all *I*<br/>
could think of to do there.  It kept his hands out of the doctor&#39;s stuff! :)<br/>
