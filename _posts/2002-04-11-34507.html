<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954492954">I agree with Bridget, some kids do not seem able to self regulate TV when <br/>
they are allowed unlimited access to it. I have gone around on this issue a <br/>
ton. From TV free (which I find the best way to limit), to unlimited TV, to <br/>
allowing a certain amount. My kids are little, still formulating their <br/>
beings. I find TV is so easy for them, they choose it over say making a <br/>
puzzle or playing cooperatively together. Anyhow, it helps me and my son <br/>
when we know what he wants to watch and when. When he asks can I, I say yes, <br/>
when we are finished with dinner, or yes when I am nursing your sister to <br/>
sleep. He also seems content when he understands, you can watch 1 movie <br/>
today. I have him decide what he wants to watch and then we put in into the <br/>
family schedule. The same idea works well for us with the computer and <br/>
games. Usually, the kids plan to play a computer game when dad is home. He <br/>
is a much better technical support person than I am. My daughters seem to <br/>
not get attached to the boxes like my little guy. He will watch it all day. <br/>
He has forgotten to eat, or pee and then freaks out when it needs to go off. <br/>
I am also easily annoyed by the sound of the TV and I like to listen to <br/>
music. In our tiny house it is 1 or the other, not both. We do limit TV now. <br/>
As the children mature, I will reconsider this issue. Am I too controlling? <br/>
maybe. Yet, I feel TV interferes with other experiences and I want the <br/>
family to have lots of connected time together.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
My kids all watched less TV as they were more independent, able to get their <br/>
own art supplies out, able to read, able to leave the house to take the dog <br/>
for a walk, or to roller blade.  Because TV had never been withheld, they <br/>
didn&#39;t have a need to have more.  If I had allowed two hours a day, I think <br/>
they might still be claiming their two hours, thinking it must be pretty <br/>
special and powerful for me to dole it out like that.<br/>

<br/>
Learning is my priority, and I see TV and video as a wonderful learning tool.<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot of connecting time because I have watched TV and movies with my <br/>
kids since they were little.  I learned all the songs on the singalong <br/>
videos, and we would sing them in the car.  (Last week I was in the car with <br/>
another family of unschoolers, and the kids were singing &quot;She&#39;s Cute&quot; from <br/>
Animaniacs--a complex two-part swing song.  I could&#39;ve sung along if I hadn&#39;t <br/>
been totally hoarse.)    I&#39;ve watched Ninja Turtles and discussed motive and <br/>
plot.  I&#39;ve watched Power Rangers.  I&#39;ve watched My Little Pony.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have watched them without the kids, but the kids and their learning are my <br/>
main job right now.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Kirby went and rented K-Pax on DVD because I hadn&#39;t seen it and he <br/>
thought I would like it, and we sat and watched it.  Two of his friends were <br/>
there too, but he got it for me.  I spent time with a fifteen year old at his <br/>
request, at his initiative, and it was good.  And we&#39;ll talk about that movie <br/>
for at least another two hours, probably in ten or fifteen minute increments <br/>
when we&#39;re in the car together, over the next few months I&#39;m sure, if past <br/>
experience holds true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717163748">I think one of the most important parts of this is the &quot;able to get their<br/>
own.&quot;  I&#39;ve met a number of folks over the years who had all kinds of<br/>
&quot;things&quot; and &quot;stuff&quot; for their kids to do but they were locked up and mom or<br/>
dad had to get them down.  Or they were too expensive to use without<br/>
supervision.  Sometimes, frequently?, in younger children ideas can be<br/>
fleeting and if they don&#39;t have easy access to something they don&#39;t bother.<br/>
<br/>
I have often wondered how many of the &quot;surprises&quot; the kidlets have created<br/>
over the years they would have done if they had had to say, &quot;Mom I need . .<br/>
.&quot;  Wouldn&#39;t have been much of a surprise if I had to provide everything or<br/>
felt that I had to supervise things so they wouldn&#39;t make a mess or scribble<br/>
in something.<br/>
