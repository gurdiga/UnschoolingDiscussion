<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697964872">I guess I am just thick. I am concerned for my ds and his lack of <br/>
desire for things intellectual,educational, school. I don&#39;t know what words to use <br/>
anymore. He is 15 and I do want him to make the choice of direction for his <br/>
life. Yes, he has rights as a human being to go in his own direction. What <br/>
happens if his choice is to drop out of school and live at home indefinitely, not <br/>
working or helping out, just reading skateboard magazines, that we pay for <br/>
because he can&#39;t get a job. He says he wants a job this summer even, but he <br/>
doesn&#39;t apply for them and they are very difficult to find, especially for kids of <br/>
his age. One thing I haven&#39;t tried, is deschooling for an entire month for <br/>
each year he has been in PS. Of course that would be like a year of him doing <br/>
next to nothing. ( He had pre-school and kindergarten) The things he chooses <br/>
during summer (3months) and vacations and weekends, is playing outside with the <br/>
troubled girl next door and occasionaly his magazines, and TV. Yes each of these <br/>
have some redeeming value, but an entire diet of any of them and a normal <br/>
person would go insane.<br/>
       Sorry if this sounds really bad. I am just frustrated trying to figure <br/>
this all out along with my concern for my ds, and still dealing with 3 other <br/>
children that feel if everything is not the same for each then &quot;it&#39;s not <br/>
fair&quot;.<br/>
       Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated individuals <br/>
but with lazy and unmotivated people it is more difficult. ( again that <br/>
probably sound harsh but these guys will do as little as possible even accepting <br/>
punishment rather than help out or even take care of their own things)<br/>
       Well, either you will have some advice or I will recieve flaming <br/>
emails. I am anxioust to see. Until then,<br/>

<br/>
There are lots of things you haven&#39;t tried, like looking at the sky instead <br/>
of the floor.<br/>
You could try looking at your son as the pure being he is, instead of the <br/>
failed adult you&#39;ve overlaid on him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Of course that would be like a year of him doing <br/>
next to nothing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very negative.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes each of these <br/>

<br/>
How is he now?  Normal?  Sane?<br/>
<br/>
School is not normal.  If you don&#39;t want him to go AND you&#39;re not willing to <br/>
allow him time and space to recover, what miracle do you want us to provide <br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;       Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated <br/>

What do you base this statement on?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397140279">Hi Londa -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you my opinions on some of the things you said.  I hope some of it<br/>
helps you and your relationship with your son.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am concerned for my ds and his lack of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>desire for things intellectual,educational, school.<br/>
<br/>
**I know that society places a lot of importance in this things, but have<br/>
you put some thought into whether or not they are actually important for<br/>
your son?  Maybe he isn&#39;t an intellectual.  That doesn&#39;t mean he does not<br/>
have other &#39;valuable&#39; qualities.  Is he kind?  Mechanical?  Artistic?<br/>
Imaginative?  What does HE think is important in life?  Is that something<br/>
that you&#39;ve talked with him about?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; What<br/>
 </span></blockquote>happens if his choice is to drop out of school and live at home indefinitely<br/>
<br/>
**Well, I&#39;d be thrilled if my kids lived here forever, but do you really<br/>
think it&#39;s a probable outcome?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One thing I haven&#39;t tried, is deschooling for an entire month for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>each year he has been in PS.<br/>
<br/>
**I highly recommend it.  I think by the end of that time you would be<br/>
surprised by what your son is doing, and by the improvement in your<br/>
relationship with him once you&#39;ve taken a break from being stressed out<br/>
about his future, and started to see him as he is in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;an entire diet of any of them and a normal<br/>
 </span></blockquote>person would go insane.<br/>
<br/>
**You seem to be saying that your son is not &#39;normal&#39;.  What is normal,<br/>
anyway?  We all have our own passions and interests and I&#39;d hate to be<br/>
judged abnormal because I spend a lot of time bending wire, for example.  I<br/>
also believe that what we think about our children affects what they think<br/>
about themselves in a major way, even if we never vocalize it to them. What<br/>
messages is your son receiving from you about himself? Are you making him<br/>
feel loved for who he is?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated individuals<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but with lazy and unmotivated people it is more difficult<br/>
<br/>
**Again, I would be concerned about what message you are giving your son if<br/>
you think he is lazy and unmotivated.  It&#39;s quite possible that you are<br/>
creating a self-fulfilling prophesy.  You think he&#39;s lazy so he might as<br/>
well act lazy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;these guys will do as little as possible even accepting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>punishment rather than help out or even take care of their own things)<br/>
<br/>
**Well, this seems like a pretty good indication that punishments don&#39;t<br/>
really work.  Maybe it&#39;s time to try a different way of dealing with your<br/>
kids?<br/>
<br/>
I recommend looking for the good that is your son right this minute, I<br/>
recommend looking at him through positive eyes instead of negative, and I<br/>
recommend really thinking about what you are contributing to your<br/>
relationship with him by thinking of him as lazy and abnormal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804061544">&lt;&lt;Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated individuals<br/>
but with lazy and unmotivated people it is more difficult. ( again that<br/>
probably sound harsh but these guys will do as little as possible even <br/>

punishment rather than help out or even take care of their own things)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try and be gentle. :)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is quite the opposite, imo.  It is great for UNmotivated people! <br/>
  It gives them time and freedom to explore what it is they DO like.  My <br/>
first suggestion would be to help your son find other interesting people to <br/>
hang out with if you are concerned about the troubled girl next door.  Here <br/>
we have skate parks, is there anything like that where you live?<br/>
<br/>
My guess would be that your son has many more interests than what you are <br/>
aware of.  It sounds like he doesn&#39;t feel safe letting you in on what does <br/>
motivate him.  Especially if he is or is afraid of being punished.<br/>
<br/>
My next suggestion would be to read, read, read.  RUN out and buy a copy of <br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook.  You can find a discounted copy here...<br/>
<br/>
I can almost guarantee if you read it and offer it to your son as <br/>
acceptable, he will fly!  If he feels comfort and support in pursuing his <br/>
own interests with your support he won&#39;t be content to just lie around <br/>
reading magazines all day everyday.  I&#39;ve never known a kid to honestly do <br/>
that.  I don&#39;t think anyone here has.<br/>
<br/>
Your fears are steeped in public school brainwashing.  I know that sounds <br/>
harsh, but it is absolutely true.  He needs, more than anything, to know <br/>
that you support him and think he is worthy of becoming an amazing <br/>
individual.  I promise, whether you believe it or not, he has picked up on <br/>
your feelings and doubts.<br/>
<br/>
Is this the same kid who reads skater mags all day and dresses in black, <br/>
baggy clothes?  My 12 yr old is very into the skater/punk scene.  She <br/>
dresses in black and wears spikey jewelry and belts most of the time.  She <br/>
is a GREAT kid!  We were school-at-homers for quite some time.  Then we <br/>
became really laid back but still used curriculum.  She wanted to go to <br/>
school and asked often.  I left it as an option and ran like hell to find <br/>
something better than what we were doing.  I found unschooling.  I took a <br/>
deep breath and dove in head first.  I quit asking her to do school work, <br/>
chores, and every other nonsense thing I had been doing.  I quit punishing.  <br/>
I started to ask myself questions daily.  Would I want someone telling me <br/>
how to learn?  How to eat, speak, spend my free time?  If I was feeling <br/>
down, bored, directionless, would I want my Mom to tell me what a lazy bum I <br/>
was or how hard I was going to have it if I didn&#39;t make something of myself?<br/>
<br/>
It was clear to me then what my daughter needed.  I read here; still do!  I <br/>
bought books, checked out books, bought tapes (buy Sandra&#39;s!) read websites <br/>
and started a journal.  The change has been truly amazing.  We are still <br/>
growing, still learning, still feeling down and bored sometimes.  What we <br/>
have now is freedom.  We have love and respect for each other.  We finally <br/>
have peace.<br/>
<br/>
I urge you to start with Sandra&#39;s site first.  Her site has the more <br/>
personal changes and life transforming information.  Then go to <br/>
unschooling.com.  For me personally, I got more out of Sandra&#39;s site.  You <br/>
might be different.<br/>
<br/>
Please, tell yourself everyday, every minute if you have to, that your son <br/>
will turn out to be more than you ever dreamed he could be.  Remember that <br/>
school never turned out a bright or successful person.  The success comes <br/>
from the person himself.  From his desires and motivation.  All the pushing <br/>
and punishing in the world won&#39;t make a successful person.  Nor a happy one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666444582">If his self esteem has been damaged by school it won&#39;t be made magically<br/>
alright in a few weeks.   If he has lost parts of himself to the<br/>
expectations of others he needs time to heal.<br/>
<br/>
If you think badly about him, speak disparagingly of him and shame his<br/>
interests you won&#39;t be helping him to feel good about himself.   You&#39;ll<br/>
be adding to his pain and insecurity.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a whole person right now.   Start from there instead of the negative<br/>
place you seem to be right now and watch how things change.   <br/>
<br/>
You are the one who needs to help him remember all the good things about<br/>
himself and if you&#39;re convinced something - everything - is wrong with<br/>
him how can you do that?  Where can he turn for help and support if not<br/>
you?<br/>
<br/>
Help him do the things he&#39;s interested in.  Help him instead of standing<br/>
in his way, and instead of criticizing and worrying.    Make an effort to<br/>
see his interest as valuable.<br/>
<br/>
If you can support him in becoming a self confident, happy person with<br/>
hopes and dreams he will never be the unambitious person your afraid of. <br/>
  Forget about academic stuff entirely.  What have academics done for<br/>
him?   Forget about school things and think about joyful human things.   <br/>
You can&#39;t pour negativity all over him and then expect to see him at his<br/>
best. <br/>

I really wish I could add something to what Rue said. I can&#39;t. It was<br/>
wonderful. My only suggestion is that you save it and read it often. Really<br/>
read it and  accept the differences your son is showing you. You have to<br/>
allow yourself to let him have the time to deschool. Totally let him,<br/>
rethink the punishments and rethink you already labeling him as lazy and not<br/>
motivated. He&#39;s got a terrific person inside there if you can just see it<br/>
and nurture that part of him. And read a lot. On this list, message boards<br/>

<br/>
This reminds me of a comment a friend made to  me once when <br/>
I was explaining to her that writing is all about the mind life of her <br/>
children. Their thoughts are what create the writing. Her reply: <br/>
&quot;Well, my son doesn&#39;t think any interesting thoughts. He&#39;s only <br/>
1/4 inch deep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pause for shock and dropping jaw.<br/>
<br/>
Then I replied, &quot;Well, his thoughts must be interesting to him. <br/>
That&#39;s why he thinks them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are so quick to devalue what we don&#39;t know or understand or <br/>
what doesn&#39;t correspond with our view of life.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are skaters (and my brother was one) are so often <br/>
assumed to be stupid or dull or bored unmotivated types. But <br/>
have you ever watched skaters? Not exactly an undisciplined <br/>
bunch. To perform the way they do takes the kind of commitment <br/>
few of us give to anything in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Skaters are usually the sensuous performers on myers briggs <br/>
which means that much of their intelligence is lodged in their <br/>
muscles. They&#39;ve got to move to think. They&#39;ve got to use their <br/>
bodies to learn. And they are usually able to give an amazing <br/>
amount of time and energy to something once they lock in and <br/>
work on it. <br/>
<br/>
So let him go. My poor brother spent his twenties recovering from <br/>
being considered stupid, though he was an astounding athlete <br/>
who excelled especially in surfing and skateboarding (not the <br/>
valuable spors like football! gag). Once he realized he wasn&#39;t <br/>
stupid, he applied that same commitment to business. He <br/>
started his own company from scratch and makes a ton of <br/>
money today. Who knew?<br/>
<br/>
Love that kid. He&#39;s probably needing to recover from the school <br/>
brand on his pysche that says he&#39;s stupid, anti-social and <br/>
uncommitted.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that you would have this as a sig line.<br/>
<br/>
What I read in your email is frustration over today and panic about <br/>
tomorrow.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you all need to do is take ONE day at a time, and just <br/>
live that day, together...doing whatever makes it a pleasant and <br/>
happy day for all of you.  Remember when you gazed on that baby boy <br/>
and just loved him and everything was a significant milestone in the <br/>
right direction?  Try doing that again.  See him as wonderful, even <br/>
as he is.  When you believe in him, he&#39;ll believe in himself.<br/>
He may be 15 and full of bravado, but believe me, he still looks to <br/>
you to see how he measures up.<br/>
<br/>
When you string a bunch of happy days together, not only do you have <br/>
a happy LIFE, but your whole perspective begins to change (and so <br/>
will his).<br/>
<br/>
When my son was very young and I didn&#39;t know any better, we saw a <br/>
psychologist, who had a 15 year old boy at the time.  I was scared to <br/>
death for my son&#39;s future, even then.  One of the things the <br/>
psychologist told me was that if you take each day at a time, and <br/>
take each thing as it comes, and work on each one, the future will <br/>
take care of itself.<br/>
<br/>
Now my son is almost 15.  And you know what?  The psychologist was <br/>
right.  My son is not perfect.  He is still somewhat immature and <br/>
impulsive (as he should be!) and he is currently of the belief that <br/>
he should be himself at all costs, no matter how offensive it might <br/>
be to others.  But I remember being the same way at that age.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of worrying that he will alienate himself out of a future <br/>
job, or a future &quot;education&quot;, I realize now that this personality <br/>
trait is what makes a critical thinker, a lobbiest, an activist, an <br/>
inventer, a philosopher, and/or a catalyst for change in the world.  <br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll never do anything with that skill but vote his <br/>
conscience.  The point is, its a good trait to have.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead of worrying about what your son is *not* doing...think about <br/>
what he *is* doing and all the possibilities there are in the future <br/>
for him to utilize those traits and skills.  There is no such thing <br/>
as a negative character trait.  EVERY character trait has good uses <br/>
and bad uses.  Its a choice, but that choice is based on how we see <br/>
ourselves.  <br/>
<br/>
You say your son is &quot;lazy&quot;.  But could it be that he is just <br/>
not &quot;anal&quot;?  Maybe he is just very laid back and lets things roll <br/>
right off of his shoulders.  Maybe he sees the &quot;bigger picture&quot; in <br/>
things and doesn&#39;t get hung up on &quot;details&quot;.  We need both kinds of <br/>
people in the world.  I&#39;m a &quot;big picture&quot; person too, and I make a <br/>
pretty good ER nurse because of it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember how often my mother told me I was lazy because I wasn&#39;t <br/>
concerned with the same details that she was.  I was just interested <br/>
in other things.  I&#39;m 36 now, and my house is clean, my kids are well <br/>
cared for, and I manage to hold a decent job too...even when I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;feel like&quot; going to work :o).  I&#39;m not anal about it because I <br/>
have other things I&#39;m more interested in paying attention to.  Its <br/>
just a trade off, its not immoral.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was &quot;deschooling&quot; (or maybe it was just an age thing), he <br/>
went through about a year of retreating into his own games, music, <br/>
magazines, etc.  When he emerged, he suddenly got a job, and joined <br/>
the swim team knowing only one stroke...and with no knowledge of how <br/>
to do a flip turn.  That takes quite a bit of courage for a 13 year <br/>
old perfectionist.  He even had to attend practice with younger kids, <br/>
but he was ok with that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...take a deep breath and think about all the *good* things his <br/>
personality traits could produce.  See him and just love him as he <br/>
is.  And when you feel you have accomplished that, let *him* know how <br/>
much you believe in him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369741562"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; This reminds me of a comment a friend made to  me once when I was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>explaining to her that writing is all about the mind life of her <br/>
children. Their thoughts are what create the writing. Her reply: <br/>
&quot;Well, my son doesn&#39;t think any interesting thoughts. He&#39;s only 1/4 <br/>
inch deep.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll bet he would be very cautious about sharing any of his <br/>
deeper thoughts with a mother who belittles him so openly. Jeez.<br/>
<br/>
Conor (14) is not anything that school would consider a writer. He&#39;s <br/>
not much for putting pen to paper. His biggest passions right now are <br/>
the Matrix, DragonballZ and anything Anime, Sci-Fi and Fantasy. If <br/>
you wanted to dismiss him as a non-thinker, you could certainly <br/>
categorize all of those interests as teenage/kid fluff.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t. I talk to him and I really listen. And the other day he <br/>
opened up with some amazing thoughts that had apparently been <br/>
swirling around him for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
We got to talking about Pandora&#39;s Box and he told me his <br/>
interpretation of the story. He said that he believes Pandora&#39;s Box <br/>
is a metaphor for the ideas and knowledge locked inside each one of <br/>
us. It&#39;s accepted that the box is dangerous, because society fears <br/>
new ideas and change. But our challenge as humans is to find the key <br/>
to unlock our own Pandora&#39;s Box and unsettle the world with our new <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t push the academics. Let the stories and ideas and information <br/>
flow around them like water. They&#39;ll get wet and absorb and drink it <br/>
in.<br/>

doesn&#39;t apply for them and they are very difficult to find, especially<br/>
for kids of <br/>
his age. **<br/>
<br/>
There was just a segment on the radio 5 minutes ago about how many<br/>
students coming out of graduate school with MBAs can&#39;t find jobs.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, maybe by September, some of the typical 15 year old<br/>
jobs will be open as other kids march back to school.  Your son could<br/>
work during his deschooling period and still decompress.  It isn&#39;t all<br/>
about idleness.<br/>
<br/>
People who don&#39;t want to do anything, after a deschooling period, are<br/>
either &quot;depressed&quot; or &quot;oppressed&quot;, I think.  The deschooling may be<br/>
essential to overcome the oppression, but keep an eye out for<br/>
depression.  My husband and I were both having suicidal thoughts when we<br/>
were 15.  The hormones at that age can be a total downer.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
**Unschooling is a fantastic oppertunity for self motivated individuals <br/>
but with lazy and unmotivated people it is more difficult.**<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever do challenging or thoughtful things for fun, or are you<br/>
driven by a nagging voice in your head to be constructive all day long? <br/>
Do you feel guilty if you sit down with a book, or TV or computer?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-252174266">I thought deschooling was supposed to be a period of doing fun things, not<br/>
doing &quot;nothing&quot;.  Pretend it&#39;s summer vacation and plan something fun and<br/>
different for each week.  Contact your local tourist center and ask for<br/>
their guide.  Our area puts out a glossy magazine that is full of day trips,<br/>
museums, parks, special events, etc.  Ask each of your kids to pick<br/>
something out of it, then do it with them (even if it is something you would<br/>
never choose to do yourself - even if it is something that YOU think is<br/>
dumb).  Make it special.  Pack a cooler with foods, snacks, and beverages<br/>
and pretend you ARE tourists.  Take a camera or buy postcards to send or<br/>
save.  Go camping or go stay in a hotel in another town and explore their<br/>
sights.<br/>
<br/>
Invite the girl next door, or other friends, to come along on some of these<br/>
trips (if your son would like that).  Read some of his magazines and ask him<br/>
questions about them.  Watch TV WITH him.<br/>
<br/>
Do those things that many of us forget to do.  Go bowling, miniature golf,<br/>
community swimming pool.  Host a film festival.  Choose several movies,<br/>
provide popcorn and beverages, and invite some friends.  Maybe have everyone<br/>
bring sleeping bags and camp in front of the TV for the movie marathon.<br/>
Camp in the backyard.  Go on day hikes.  Take a group of teens to the mall<br/>
or video game store.  You can hang out nearby and read a book or sip a latte<br/>
while they play.<br/>
<br/>
We are all unique.  One man&#39;s insanity could be another&#39;s ecstasy.  Why<br/>
should a teenage boy have all the same interests that you have as a female<br/>
adult?<br/>

&gt; person would go insane.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with everything that&#39;s been said so far.  What I want to point out<br/>
is that your son may always be inclined toward doing more physical things.<br/>
This is absolutely not a bad thing.  I&#39;ve been reading that, at least in<br/>
Canada and probably also in the States, blue collar workers are going to be<br/>
at a premium in a few years.  So many parents and teachers and counsellors<br/>
have been pushing academics over vocational training for so long that there<br/>
just aren&#39;t all that many younger blue collar workers.  It&#39;s stupid for two<br/>
reasons.  For one, there&#39;s now going to be a shortage.  For the other, there<br/>
are always going to be kids who aren&#39;t academically oriented.  They can be<br/>
very successful doing the kinds of physical things they like to do, so why<br/>
push them in directions that don&#39;t suit them?<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old son is a lot like your boy, and he&#39;s never been to school.<br/>
His passions are team sports and mountain biking.  He&#39;s spent a lot of time<br/>
on his computer searching out biking information and pricing bike parts.<br/>
That and his bike mags are about the only reading he does, but he can now<br/>
read anything he chooses to read.  (He only learned at age 12.)  I&#39;m happy<br/>
with that.  His spelling is still terrible, and it&#39;s starting to bother him.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t bother him enough to want to do anything about it yet, but I<br/>
think he&#39;s leaning that way.  And even if he doesn&#39;t, he can always get one<br/>
of those Franklin spelling machines.<br/>
<br/>
His interest in biking has led to watching biking videos a lot, which has<br/>
led to an interest in film-making, especially the editing aspect  Maybe<br/>
he&#39;ll do something with that one day.  He already knows enough about fixing<br/>
bikes that the local bike store owner would hire him if he had enough<br/>
business.  I can see him owning his own bike store one day.  I can also see<br/>
him running an eco-tourism business (very big here on Vancouver Island).<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s worked off and on for his dad doing forestry work and knows he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to make his living that way, but he could if he had to.  Which brings<br/>
me to the lazy, unmotivated comment.  My son *looks* lazy and unmotivated at<br/>
times.  When he isn&#39;t working he&#39;ll sometimes watch TV for days straight.<br/>
But when he starts working, he seems much happier.  He likes the challenge<br/>
of making as much money as he can.  (The forestry work is piece-work.  They<br/>
get paid by the hectare or number of trees or whatever, depends what they&#39;re<br/>
doing.)  He jumps right out of the crummy when it gets to the job site and<br/>
starts working right away.  The older workers sit around smoking and<br/>
drinking coffee for half an hour, with frequent smoke and coffee breaks<br/>
through the day.  Then they bitch and complain if he makes more money than<br/>
they do.  He likes feeling competent and needed.  Maybe your son needs help<br/>
finding work that would make him feel competent and useful.<br/>
<br/>
But the best thing you can do for your son is much like what everyone else<br/>
has said.  See him as smart, competent, motivated, and interesting.  Give<br/>
him time to deschool, but don&#39;t expect that he *will* turn to academics.  He<br/>
may never do much in that area, but he *can* be very successful, especially<br/>
with your support.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m an ENFP and suspect that lots of unschoolers are NFs <br/>
(focus being empathic relating to others). The P quality makes it <br/>
easy for me to tolerate random chaos. :)<br/>
<br/>
ENFPs are known for being enthusiastic learners, love to have <br/>
parties which focus on other people (more than just holding a <br/>
party for the sake of an occasion) but are most happy when <br/>
engaged in relating to others on a deep level.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many STJs unschool. I&#39;d think not too many. STJs <br/>
tend to like traditional institutions, are loyal to authority and they <br/>
make up the majority of A students and teachers. Isn&#39;t that wild?<br/>
<br/>
NTs, otoh, would be drawn to the ideology of unschooling just for <br/>
the experimental nature of it! They love to chew on a new idea <br/>
like a dog with a bone and test it every which way.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope lots of women share their scores. it would be fun to do <br/>
an informal (random and chaotic &lt;g&gt;) survey of this list and see <br/>
what we get.<br/>
<br/>
Any STs?<br/>

doing &quot;nothing&quot;.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people think nothing is fun!<br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I added some new links to my deschooling page, notably the first on the <br/>
bottom left, Pattie Donahue-Krueger&#39;s article.  I&#39;m surprised this wasn&#39;t already <br/>
online.  I just intended to link to it, but it wasn&#39;t there!  Now it is!<br/>

An M-B true story - funny I hope - with a moral too.<br/>
<br/>
I was sitting in a small meeting room with 5 others, one of whom was new to the group, waiting for one more person before starting.  (It was a Success Team meeting, all you Wishcrafters!) The new person Sara and I started chatting, just the two of us, but it&#39;s a small room for 6.  She seemed to know about M-B so I barged right in and asked her if she&#39;d done the test.  &quot;Oh, yes, I&#39;m an ISFJ.&quot;  More chat and then she tells me that she&#39;s on a Board of Directors and the whole group (12 people) are a bunch of Perceivers.  &quot;I&#39;m so frustrated.  I&#39;m a J and they are really into their P-ness.&quot;  All conversation in the room halts.  LOOOONG silence.  And then I ROAR!  The whole room roars and people in the office come and see what&#39;s so funny &#39;cause we&#39;re all on the floor holding our sides!<br/>

  Have you<br/>

<br/>
  Yes. I like to use Keirsey Bates with my kids (Please Understand <br/>
  Me). They love it. My sister is a therapist and we have &quot;pegging&quot; <br/>
  duels. We try to see who can ID members of groups first when <br/>
  we are newcomers. :)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>

  INFP,  but<br/>
  &gt; thought I maybe became more &quot;J&quot; over the past 3-5 yrs.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve gotten more P over the years.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m an ENFP and suspect that lots of unschoolers are NFs <br/>
  (focus being empathic relating to others). The P quality makes it <br/>
  easy for me to tolerate random chaos. :)<br/>
<br/>
  ENFPs are known for being enthusiastic learners, love to have <br/>
  parties which focus on other people (more than just holding a <br/>
  party for the sake of an occasion) but are most happy when <br/>
  engaged in relating to others on a deep level.<br/>
<br/>
  I wonder how many STJs unschool. I&#39;d think not too many. STJs <br/>
  tend to like traditional institutions, are loyal to authority and they <br/>
  make up the majority of A students and teachers. Isn&#39;t that wild?<br/>
<br/>
  NTs, otoh, would be drawn to the ideology of unschooling just for <br/>
  the experimental nature of it! They love to chew on a new idea <br/>
  like a dog with a bone and test it every which way.<br/>
<br/>
  So I hope lots of women share their scores. it would be fun to do <br/>
  an informal (random and chaotic &lt;g&gt;) survey of this list and see <br/>
  what we get.<br/>
<br/>
  Any STs?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337200660">I worked with an ESTJ who COULD NOT get unschooling.  Wrong.  Just plain wrong.  No structure.  On the other and he regularly stomped on our feelings and ideas around the office.  Didn&#39;t even notice.  It was just the right thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
So, I tried to blend.  (My old Aikido training)  Resist and lose.  Blend and enjoy the ride.  Maybe with kids it&#39;s the same.  Blend/bend/adjust/assist.  It&#39;s tiresome at times, but so is scrapping with them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OMIGAWD! That&#39;s my exact problem with number three child. <br/>
he&#39;s an ESTJ (classic American male) and he loved it when the <br/>
whole family had set schooltable time, read aloud time and <br/>
then project time. (We were eclectic schoolers at that point). We <br/>
do go to a co-op once a week tht helps to sate his need for <br/>
socializing within a structure. <br/>
<br/>
he told me (now that we&#39;ve unschooled for six months) that he <br/>
just isn&#39;t into being unschooled. I had explained to him that all <br/>
that means is that his education is one that is tailor designed to <br/>
suit his needs.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re going to purchase a cool science program for him next <br/>
year (that has both experiments and course work).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been tough. He&#39;s even cried a few times worried that he&#39;s not <br/>
learning. (Geesh--from the kid who knows more about the <br/>
universe than anyone I know!)<br/>

<br/>
Ack Tory! I&#39;m that temperament that forgets relevant details! What <br/>
drives my son batty is that I buck any kind of systematic <br/>
approach. One description of my temprament went so far as to <br/>
say that I tend to find the weakness in a system and then <br/>
organize the detractors and set up a coup (or at least, a protest). <br/>
I looked back over my life and sure enoughit&#39;s proven true!<br/>
<br/>
So to have to &quot;do school&quot; in a traditional way just exhausts me. <br/>
But I also see his need to at least know he&#39;s progressing. This is <br/>
what the underlying idea is. He wants a way to measure <br/>
himself... so I&#39;m looking for ways to do that with him<br/>
<br/>
Open to all ideas! :)<br/>
