<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422231083">This was a great idea, Michelle!<br/>
<br/>
  We homeschool for a number of reasons such as my own negative experiences <br/>
with public school, and my stubborn refusal to let anyone else raise my <br/>
child. But I,m always adding new and better reasons, for instance, reading <br/>
everyone else&#39;s posts I find myself saying over and over- yeah, I agree with <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
I have just the one son so far-Gary age 6.<br/>
<br/>
Gary has been VERY into bugs since before he could walk, and recently he,ms <br/>
gotten interested in Spanish,and how electricity works(which has stumped me, <br/>
I have no idea how to explain this to a 6 year old without boring him to <br/>
tears,I have looked on the web, but most of what I found is a little too <br/>
advanced as he doesn&#39;t read much yet.)<br/>
<br/>
We live in Topeka,Kansas, and I,m actually very satisfied with the laws.<br/>
<br/>
We currently have 2 Dachsunds, and 2 cats, although in the past year or so <br/>
we&#39;ve also had ,cockateils, Anoles, Red eared sliders and various species of <br/>
fish, not to mention,dozens of varieties of insects in jars!<br/>
<br/>
We are rather eclectic spiritually. We are practising Wiccans, and I also <br/>
attend a UU felowship, would like to be a member of CUUPS but we have no <br/>
chapter here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always have time to post, somedays it&#39;s al I can do to read my <br/>
e-mail, but I too adore this list, I have learned alot from it.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of.<br/>
                            Blessings, Trisha<br/>
