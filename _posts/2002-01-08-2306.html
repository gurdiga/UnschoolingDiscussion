<div id="ygrps-yiv-467546409">&lt;&lt;We also have 11 acres of bush and a stream and a waterfall, and are only<br/>
10 minutes drive from the best surf spot in New Zealand and I wouldn&#39;t live<br/>
anywhere else ever again!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago my husband dragged me out to the airport because a new<br/>
airline was having a drawing with a free trip to New Zealand as the grand<br/>
prize. We had to dress in costume, which I was not in the mood to do--I<br/>
think we put on a couple of tropical shirts and some kind of hat.  The<br/>
³catch² was that the winner had to be prepared to leave in a few days and<br/>
there would be no layovers.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold, I won! Because of a strike of some kind we were able to delay<br/>
the trip long enough to get everything in order, and then we were off to<br/>
parts unknown with our 22-month-old in tow.<br/>
<br/>
We absolutely adored New Zealand and many times over the years have even<br/>
talked about emigrating. The people were wonderful, the land was gorgeous<br/>
and everything just seemed sweet and gentle. So many times since I have told<br/>
the story of leaving money outside overnight in a wooden box *in the open*<br/>
and finding it replaced with milk in the morning.   I wonder if that¹s still<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
We also saw the best parade EVER in New Zealand. It was in a smallish town<br/>
and there were many, many ³floats² all done with love by hand. No fancy,<br/>
high-tech lights or expensive effects--just lots of families dressed up,<br/>
singing and dancing. Wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
My dh may have a chance to be there again soon. He¹s quitting his job<br/>
(sh-h-h-h-h--they don¹t know quite yet) and taking a three-month trip by<br/>
himself to Australia with a possible stop-over in NZ. After years and years<br/>
of working at a job he¹s always been very stressed-out about, this is his<br/>
chance (³children² are 19 and almost-22) to unwind, ³find himself² and try<br/>
to plan the future. I can¹t go with him, and I don¹t even think I would if I<br/>
could--it¹s something he needs to do alone.  I¹m so happy for him while at<br/>
the same time so SAD at the thought of not being with him (this will be our<br/>
first long separation in 37 years!).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890143058">What a wonderful story, Susan. Wish I could win a trip to America to <br/>
meet you all - and to meet up with a couple of old friends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid that it is far less common to put money out for milk these <br/>
days. Most people buy tokens and use those instead, as these are far <br/>
less attractive to the young kids who found it a good money making <br/>
racket!  I missed our local street parade this year at New Year, as we <br/>
were out of town. (Well, we don&#39;t actually live in town, but you know <br/>
what I mean!) In the bigger cities they have the expensive floats and <br/>
fancy effects, but we country folk stick to the simple still &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you dh has a great trip and manages to get himself sorted out - <br/>
even if I do think a three month trip to NZ with a stop over in Aussie <br/>
would be a better bet &lt;beg&gt; It will be hard for you being left behind - <br/>
thank goodness for e-mail and phones, huh?<br/>
