<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651166352">&quot;I was thinking that most people who are attracted to <br/>
unschooling/sudbury philosophies wouldn&#39;t be attracted to the idea of <br/>
sending their kids away.&quot;<br/>

BUT, what if the child wanted to?<br/>
There are probably loads of unschooled teens that would love a chance to spend a year exploring nature in Maine. What better way to do it than a Sudbury school?<br/>
It&#39;s another option that is very child friendly for those that are looking for that type of experience.<br/>

As I said in one of my other posts....I have no idea what a Sudbury <br/>
school is.  Can any of you enlighten me?  I&#39;m really interested.<br/>

I thought what you mean was that you didn&#39;t know but you had then looked it <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve irritated people with this kind of recommendation in the past, but <br/>
google.com has answers 24 hours a day, and if the other people seem to know what it <br/>
means, it&#39;s probably better for a reader and for a very large group if one <br/>
does a bit of the footwork on the side.<br/>
<br/>
There is information that can only be obtained directly from other <br/>
unschoolers in the moment, and then there is information which is not particular to nor <br/>
a subset of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty torqued that someone asked who MLK was (and the initials came IN <br/>
context).   <br/>
Don&#39;t anyone asked me what &quot;torqued&quot; means.  If there&#39;s not a dictionary <br/>
within reach on your desk there&#39;s google and there are online dictionaries and if <br/>
you have Word, that has a dictionary.<br/>
<br/>
Would I ask my kids to look something up?  Probably not, but they&#39;re kids.<br/>

Right.<br/>
My son when he saw the post from Matt on my Maine unschooling list was like <br/>
look mom check this out! He has wanted to go to a military school for years he <br/>
says it would be neat but knows it would be way more book work than he thinks <br/>
is necessary. Sudbury schools to him from what he said last night would be <br/>
like Maine Conservation Camp just more fun. He went to MCS last year as many know <br/>
cuz I posted that I was missing him. He was gone a week and said it was a bit <br/>
too long without his Mom.<br/>
I was wrong about the school being for the parents to live in also but I <br/>
still say it sounds pretty neat even if it doesn&#39;t fit our family. Maine is a <br/>
beautiful place to be I could see families spending the 2000 to send their kids <br/>
here. Heck Berwick Academy is well over 10,0000 and thats not to live there <br/>
either.  Other local private schools around us are 3-4000.00 just for daily <br/>

Thank you, Matt.  Thanks to Sandra, I had already checked out this <br/>
website.  It&#39;s the first one that came up when I typed in Sudbury <br/>
school on Google.  BTW, I do normally check things out on google, I <br/>
was just being lazy in this case.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like a great program, if you were to send your kids away <br/>
from home, this would be the way to do it.  <br/>

Yahoo cuts the end off the emails on here. If you just click on my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you want people to subscribe to your blog without using email, <br/>
you&#39;ll need to syndicate your blog. It is an advanced feature in <br/>
blogspot called RSS.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/rss/">http://news.yahoo.com/rss/</a><br/>
<br/>
Blogs using RSS (Real Simple Syndication), can be read using news <br/>
readers. News readers are like that BBS feature in Outlook : They <br/>
bypass most of the markup and graphics on a website and go straight to <br/>
the content. Some news readers are apps like NetNewsWire ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ranchero.com">http://www.ranchero.com</a> ). Others are online like Bloglines ( <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bloglines.com">http://www.bloglines.com</a> ) and Feedster ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.feedster.com">http://www.feedster.com</a> ).<br/>
<br/>
You read the text, you can even look at images and, as far as I <br/>
understand, there is a group trying to develop feeds for music as well. <br/>
Anyway, it allows people like me to scan at 300, even 1000 sites in <br/>
just a few hours as opposed to days.<br/>
<br/>
With RSS I read the Beeb online, NY Times, Yahoo News, Google News. <br/>
With RSS, I&#39;ve been able to subscribe to 384 commercial and personal <br/>
websites. It&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread and it&#39;s THE HOT new <br/>
thing on the web.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If it is too much of a hassle of you wouldn&#39;t know how to enable it, <br/>
let me know. There might be other options.<br/>
