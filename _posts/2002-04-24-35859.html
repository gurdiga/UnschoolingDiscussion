<div id="ygrps-yiv-3468434">Yet we all live on the same property and haven&#39;t fought with each<br/>
other over it at all.  So why can&#39;t Ireland stop fighting?  Why can&#39;t<br/>
Isreal/Palestine?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s remember to change the subject :) These debates can be very sensitive for some.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now how can you relate your household to Isreal & Palestine or Ireland?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If mom is always saying &quot;this looks fun, wanna go?&quot;<br/>
&gt; there is a chance that the kidlet will think she wants him to go and<br/>
&gt; do it for that reason.  And guarding against that can be very<br/>
&gt; difficult with some kids.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My children have NO problem telling me they don&#39;t think something is<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; good idea! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s good.  Mine too now. But I had to work to get one of them<br/>
there.  She used to be the kind who goes &#39;along&#39; until I made it very<br/>
clear that she could say nah, I don&#39;t wanna to me, my dh, her<br/>
grandparents, her friends, etc.  Now she is doing what SHE wants to<br/>
do.  But, I know others whose kids still just go along and mom thinks<br/>
she is doing a great job &#39;helping&#39; them find their interests.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please, let&#39;s not turn this into a religious debate. :o)I have a<br/>
feeling<br/>
&gt; some here my jump on this. The above is the first example that came<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; my mind of using my parental influence in my child&#39;s &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for letting me share.<br/>
<br/>
But religious debates are fun!  Actually, I kind of agree with you.  I<br/>
am not Christian, but I do believe there is a &#39;something&#39; that set up<br/>
he system so it could work this way.  I just can&#39;t define my<br/>
&#39;something&#39;.<br/>
And on that note, my dh is pantheistic after having been raised<br/>
Brethren.  I am non-specific pagan after being raised Catholic (so<br/>
obviously my mom is Catholic).  Wyndham is still finding  himself.<br/>
Jenni is leaning toward independent witchcraft.  And Rachel is<br/>
Militant Agnostic - she doesn&#39;t know and neither do you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, it only looks like religion because they&#39;ve come to hate each other so<br/>
much. The situation in Northern Ireland is about land and division of power<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
In fact I can&#39;t think of any so called &quot;religious wars&quot; that are really<br/>
about religion and not about land and power. (History wasn&#39;t my strong suit<br/>
so I could be missing some!)<br/>
<br/>
So unless you&#39;re dividing the land and power at your house along religious<br/>
lines I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to worry about. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing you might want to consider is that at least a couple of the <br/>
religions you mentioned for your household are &quot;live and let live&quot; <br/>
religions, that don&#39;t try to convert others or say that theirs is the only <br/>
way.  I can&#39;t remember all the ones you mentioned, so I could be wrong, but <br/>
Paganism and Wicca for sure are &quot;live and let live&quot;.<br/>
