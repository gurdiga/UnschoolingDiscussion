<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708382685">&lt;&lt; I hear that a lot when I&#39;m in the library.  A<br/>
parent will tell the child that they already have<br/>
enough books, or they must take 2 and only 2, or<br/>
something like that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I confess, I say that a lot to my kids at the<br/>
library.  But that is because we are always at our<br/>
limit of 25 books on our library cards.  We have 2<br/>
cards.  They have to bring some back in order to check<br/>
more out...<br/>

Hi, Heather --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how &quot;suggestable&quot; your librarians are, but I&#39;ve used a<br/>
library system where &quot;educators&quot; could check out larger numbers of books<br/>
with longer renewal privileges.  I wonder if you could get your<br/>
librarians to create a policy loophole like that? <br/>
<br/>
I want to kick myself for suggesting that some people should get more<br/>
privileges at the library than others, but it seems to me that you need<br/>
a higher limit.  (Or need to get more cards for the youngest kids.  But<br/>
then you&#39;d probably need a shopping cart to get all the books home.)  :-)<br/>

went from $125/year to $150/year.  When I first joined that library, it was<br/>
only $50.  That was only about 9 years ago.<br/>
