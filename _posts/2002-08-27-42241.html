But what it boiled down to was exactly that. I believe it is true in many<br/>
places just like it is in my town in CT: The school system pulls most of the<br/>
strings of power and money. They want to possess the children, and to be<br/>
paid for it.<br/>

Thanks again, Mary, for your research. The story speaks for itself...the<br/>
authorities can find enough about any one of us, if they want to, to do<br/>
terrible things to us -- all within the laws. (just like the schools can use<br/>
any reason they want to recommend our children get drugged) The problem is<br/>
the arrogance of government officials, combined, often, with their deep<br/>
ignorance and feeling a need to control and interfere in people&#39;s lives.<br/>
It&#39;s why the laws need constant scrutiny and change.<br/>
<br/>
The stories of Ruby Ridge and Waco have similarities (only much worse) to<br/>
the one in Utah years ago. I was farming in western Colorado at the time of<br/>
the Utah incident. We saw similar attitudes around us and had Mormon<br/>
acquaintances among our ranching community. The shooting was big news.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I forget who this was, but I hope she&#39;s satisfied now with my claim and will<br/>
refrain from connecting  &quot;libertarian&quot; with &quot;scare&quot; in her future cheap<br/>
shots.</div>
