<div id="ygrps-yiv-585556622">First off, I want to assure you that I&#39;m not intentionally being obtuse<br/>
here.  I really do not understand what you are trying to say.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that it makes any difference, but as frame of reference, I was<br/>
born in Idaho and spent my early years there.  I have extensive family still<br/>
living in all parts of Idaho, so I think I&#39;m fairly conversant with the<br/>
attitudes of the general population in that area.  I was raised around guns,<br/>
have a healthy respect for them and know personally how to use them.<br/>
<br/>
So...what I understand you to be saying is that somehow these children are<br/>
not likely to be afraid of police presence and attempts to remove them from<br/>
their home after their father has very recently died, their mother is<br/>
arrested (based on personal experience, I can assume they have not had<br/>
contact with her since her arrest) because their upbringing has prepared<br/>
them for this?  That because they&#39;ve been taught to be self reliant and<br/>
responsible for themselves they are somehow not affected by what has been<br/>
happening in their family and home?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the local police/sheriff&#39;s department appears to have shown<br/>
enough restraint to not force the issue at gunpoint.  That was a pretty good<br/>
move on their part.  Still, I don&#39;t see how these children can possibly have<br/>
been anything less than terrified.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope I&#39;m misunderstanding this.  I do not understand how any child<br/>
in this situation could be anything less than terrified.  I think their<br/>
actions demonstrate their fear.<br/>

(Eiraul says):<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; I don&#39;t have enough first hand information about this case to really<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; whether the officials&#39; actions were justified or not.  But I do have<br/>
enough<br/>
&gt; first hand experience to know this will be a traumatic experience for<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(Nicki responds):<br/>
&gt;     I would first like to say I am sorry you had such troubled times as a<br/>
&gt; child. I can also understand what you are saying about the police<br/>
interfering<br/>
&gt; and how it impressed you and still does. When dh was a teen he had a party<br/>
&gt; and the police busted it and came in w/ weapons drawn. How ludicrous for<br/>
&gt; busting a teen beer party. They can really go over the top.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    But this dept. was very careful from what I read b/c they didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; another Randy Weaver fiasco. This is Idaho and we have had our share of<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I don&#39;t know many more details and I am glad they backed off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Also I know a few families like this in reguard to training kids in<br/>
&gt; weaponry. They are firm believers in anti gov&#39;t. and so on. These kids<br/>
&gt; probably weren&#39;t as &quot;scared&quot; as you think. Some of these families imagine<br/>
&gt; this scenario and are prepared for it. I personally know people who<br/>
believe<br/>
&gt; these things. It is pretty scary to listen to IMO.<br/>
