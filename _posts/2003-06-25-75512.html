<div id="ygrps-yiv-900079417">The post by the mom who wants new unschooling lists <br/>
reminded me of something I wrote last week. I was explaining to <br/>
someone who questioned whether we should &quot;trust our <br/>
children&quot; what it meant to parent them respectfully. The following <br/>
post is taken from that dialog.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us were raised either with authoritarian parents or what <br/>
might be called permissive parents (and at the extreme end, <br/>
neglect). I&#39;m pretty certain that on this list, none of us has <br/>
experienced what we are learning about: respectful parenting. <br/>
<br/>
An analogy occurs to me.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m wanting support for homebirth, consulting my memories of <br/>
my mother&#39;s hospital births doesn&#39;t help me. Listening to women <br/>
who&#39;ve decided between natural birth in a birth center versus <br/>
those who gave birth in a hospital proper doesn&#39;t clarify how <br/>
homebirth works. And in fact, the problems raised by those who <br/>
have never done home births are usually very &quot;hospitally&quot; in<br/>
nature. They not only can&#39;t answer the questions of a home birth <br/>
seeking mother, they don&#39;t even ask the right questions <br/>
themselves!<br/>
<br/>
To continue this example (and I promise to tie it all together), <br/>
when a woman says, &quot;I want a safe birth. The only way I know to <br/>
guarantee a safe birth is to be at a hospital in case of <br/>
emergency,&quot; she already comes from a set of beliefs about birth <br/>
that are radically different than the mother considering <br/>
homebirth. Mothers considering homebirths see birth as natural<br/>
and usually void of any complications whatsoever AND they see <br/>
hospitals as perpetrating a lot of unnecessary dangers to both <br/>
mother and baby in the name of protection.<br/>
<br/>
For the home birthing mother, her starting point is different. Birth <br/>
is natural. Birth is 99% of the time without a hitch. Birth is not an <br/>
emergency to be handled or a painful process to be endured <br/>
with epidurals. It&#39;s the normal, overwhelmingly natural and most <br/>
often safe passage of a full term baby from a womb. Birth <br/>
requires attendance, not intervention.<br/>
<br/>
And not surprisingly, the number of problem births at home is <br/>
miniscule. But many hospital birth mothers consider that result <br/>
&quot;lucky&quot; or &quot;she just has a good body for birth.&quot; They want to say <br/>
that their births were necessarily full of intervention or that their <br/>
baby couldn&#39;t have survived at home.<br/>
<br/>
But what if the underlying philosophy really does influence the <br/>
outcome?<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve thought about respectful parenting, consulting my history <br/>
or Jon&#39;s hasn&#39;t been that helpful. What was missing in our <br/>
homes wasn&#39;t more or fewer boundaries. What was missing <br/>
was a belief about children. (And I say this is true for how we <br/>
unschool as well.)<br/>
<br/>
Like birth, how you view it determines your choices. If we see <br/>
kids as needing boundaries because they won&#39;t be &quot;safe&quot; <br/>
without them, we&#39;ve already started from a totally different pov <br/>
than the parents who follow AP or NCP. When we face what<br/>
appear to be dangerous situations, we&#39;re usually still thinking <br/>
from the old mindset about children.  We&#39;re thinking of children <br/>
as people who need management and correction and <br/>
supervision. We don&#39;t see their development as natural, as <br/>
something to support and facilitate but as something to control <br/>
and manage.<br/>
<br/>
This attitude will influence us at all levels. How we &quot;school&quot; or <br/>
&quot;educate&quot; our kids will grow out of our ideas about children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What if my daughter is in a dangerous situation that I could have <br/>
prevented with a boundary?&quot; is a question asked by people who <br/>
feel that children are in danger and our job is to protect them.<br/>
<br/>
But what if the foundational belief system says, &quot;Children are <br/>
mostly inclined to respond to input and make rational decisions <br/>
if they feel fundamentally respected as complete, thinking <br/>
individuals&quot;? Suddenly the belief itself may set in motion a very <br/>
different birth/result. And solutions to problems that crop up will <br/>
be rooted in preserving that pov, not in abandoning it.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when mothers in hospitals have pain, they take <br/>
drugs.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t go sit in a bathtub. They can&#39;t walk around outdoors <br/>
and breathe the air. They can&#39;t get foot massages while listening <br/>
to soothing music in the dark. Heck, they don&#39;t even have a crock <br/>
pot of heated washcloths to continually put on the perineum to <br/>
keep it relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
The number of ways to relieve pain when you see birth as <br/>
natural are myriad. But the one thing you don&#39;t do is leave home <br/>
and head for the hospital! :)<br/>
<br/>
The number of ways to resolve typical family issues (eating, tv <br/>
viewing, keeping house, cleaning the dishes...) for our children <br/>
are probably just as numerous, if not more, if we fully embrace <br/>
the premise that children can understand reason, that they <br/>
themselves want to be safe and secure and that we are their <br/>
best allies when we give them the dignity of choice in their own <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
When we start with the assumption that they won&#39;t want our <br/>
limits, we&#39;ve already started with a different set of suppositions.<br/>
<br/>
If we start with the assumption that kids respond well to dialog, <br/>
options, respect and support, giving our ideas of what <br/>
constitutes safety or a healthy lifestyle will probably go a lot <br/>
further in winning their support than a boundary or enforcement <br/>
ever could. And it probably stands to reason that kids raised this <br/>
way really do have fewer problems than those who have felt <br/>
disrespected for most of their lives.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is like this. We cannot start with the assumption <br/>
that kids can learn without coercion and then spend the rest of <br/>
the day coercing. Our kids will read the mixed message: she <br/>
trusts me to teach myself how to read but I have to ask <br/>
permission to eat a handful of chocolate chips?<br/>
<br/>
The philosophical underpinnings will establish the family culture <br/>
that will or won&#39;t support the choices we make for our kids&#39; <br/>
education (on all levels, not just school subjects).<br/>
