<div id="ygrps-yiv-800325981">Who writes these books?  Siblings w/o Rivalry and How to Talk and Listen<br/>
- I forget the title.  Also, does anyone know any good books on<br/>
convincing a spouse who prefers to remain stubbornly ignorant, yet at<br/>
the same time refuses to allow you to homeschool?  I can&#39;t imagine what<br/>
he would say if I told him about unschooling!!! - I just won&#39;t.  Let him<br/>
think we spend from 8-3 at the table doing worksheets and reports.  I&#39;ll<br/>
just show him the paper things we do (ds loves worksheets - as long as<br/>
he gets to choose which ones we do and how long we spend on them).<br/>
<br/>
And, while I&#39;m writing...  DS (2yo) likes books with pictures - no<br/>
matter how difficult the words are, but no matter how written for kids<br/>
they are, he doesn&#39;t like them if they don&#39;t have pictures.  Fine.  I&#39;m<br/>
not worried.  The funny thing is, I was reading &quot;Little Men&quot; the other<br/>
day, and laughed at the part where Mrs. Jo ties Nan up to the couch. <br/>
Mook (ds) asked what was so funny, and I proceeded to tell him the story<br/>
- I ended up telling him the whole book.  As long as I was telling it<br/>
instead of reading it, he was fascinated and told DH all about the<br/>
book.  DH was impressed (and insisting that with ds&#39;s intelligence, it<br/>
would be a shame not to send him to school - grrrrr).  And, ds likes to<br/>
memorize books and then pretend that he&#39;s reading them in front of<br/>
people.  He can&#39;t read - he hasn&#39;t progressed visibly in the past half<br/>
year or so when he learned his alphabet and the sounds the letters<br/>
make.  (And, no, I&#39;m not at all worried.)  But other people ask me how I<br/>
do it (me?  He&#39;s the one who&#39;s learning, not me), but they don&#39;t really<br/>
want to know.  They just want the name of an expensive cram school. <br/>
Sad.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to go on...<br/>
<br/>
Love, Melanie in Japan<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482683815">Melanie:  sounds like alot of people (I&#39;ve run into tons) are &quot;stuck&quot; with <br/>
societys vain-boosting notion need to say &quot;MY DS/DD attends such-and-such <br/>
school (insert expensive cram school)&quot;<br/>
I wonder if DH is stuck with needing a prestigious school to cite where his <br/>
ds attends?<br/>
Just my $.02<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

Have you looked into book on tapes...?  I find that my kids are fascinated by <br/>
them.  Sometimes they want to be read too, but it&#39;s not unusual that they <br/>
will just plug the headphones into the stereo and listen for a while.<br/>

And how about videos????  My daughter could never (or would never) get <br/>
through &quot;Hamlet&quot; at 14 yo, but she saw the movie!!!  Better that than <br/>
nothing, IMO.<br/>
