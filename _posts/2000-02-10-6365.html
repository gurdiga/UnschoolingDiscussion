<div id="ygrps-yiv-693120849">Could someone suggest links for learning geometry?  A friend in public<br/>
school is having trouble grasping the methods her teacher is using and<br/>
would like another perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know how to make goat cheese?  Would appreciate links<br/>
for recipes and equipment.  Any suggestions on what else to do with large<br/>
quantities of goats milk would also be appreciated :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I highly recommend books from the &quot;Maneuvers with Mathematics&quot; series.  These<br/>
were developed for middle schoolers by the Maneuvers with Mathematics project<br/>
at the University of Illinois at Chicago, having found that the traditional<br/>
methods didn&#39;t work for so many kids.  They are carefully designed so that one<br/>
skill truly builds on the next, and provides real-world contexts.  The first<br/>
geometry one (there are 2 or 3) is called &quot;Maneuvers with Angles&quot; by David<br/>
Page et. al.  Published by Dale Seymour Publications, Palo Alto, CA<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t recommend much for goat cheese.  I&#39;ve heard that the most important<br/>
requirement is a goat.<br/>
