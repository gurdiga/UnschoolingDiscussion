<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368486206">Well now Leslie, after reading your post on multiplication, you&#39;ve just gotten me going again with lots of questions.  Your son&#39;s difficulty motivating himself to learn certain math basics makes me wonder.  Wondering here!<br/>
<br/>
There are several things I can think of that I would like to have learned or would like to learn that I do not want to put the effort into learning *on my own*.  Is this because I was taught in ps or is it because self-discipline and self-motivation require a lot of energy and my desire has not reached that level, or is it because I have other responsibilities at this time in my life that take priority?<br/>
<br/>
I used to race my bicycle and had a goal to win a national medal.  Every year I followed a very grueling training schedule, by myself, without riding partners because I had a goal to win that medal.  After coming in 3rd many years in a row and failing to win gold when I turned 40, I stopped racing.  I no longer have a goal to win a medal or train that hard but I would like to be physically fit.  I now swim on a masters swim team and need the companionship of other people and the help of a coach to motivate me to exercise.  I can no longer do it on my own, even though I have a desire to be fit.  Multiplication tables are like exercise and for your son, physics is like winning a national medal.  Buying a curriculum to motivate him to do basic math is not the answer because the child still has to *motivate himself* to do work he doesn&#39;t really want to do.  How can we make it easier for our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not all that much fun?<br/>
<br/>
IMO there is a benefit to knowing the basics.  I wish I could build furniture but I was never taught the basics and I have decided not to pursue this as a hobby because it requires too much energy to go back and learn from scratch.  I know some women that wish they could cook.  They never learned the basics and have decided it is too much trouble to learn now.  Can we get bye without these skills?  Yes.  Would there be more possibilities in life if we all had the basics covered?  Yes.  It is easier to cover the basics when you are young and have a lot of time.  Institutions cover the basics of many areas.  How do we provide this for our unschooled children and still unschool?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting subject. Since I too someties *wonder* if my child <br/>
will or will not learn the basics... then I think... what ARE the basics?<br/>
<br/>
The basics I needed to learn as a kid weren&#39;t the ones that the world <br/>
needed by the time I was working. I should of been prepared for <br/>
technology as opposed to that &#39;factory&#39; work mentality, or that <br/>
&#39;housewife&#39; mentality that they used to give us &#39;girls&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess all I worry is if he learns to read. I think that will be a <br/>
given for a long time to come.<br/>
<br/>
After that. I dunno. *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the vid games are preparing the next generation, maybe we&#39;ll have <br/>
&#39;communicators&#39; that will do all my adding/math for me. Instantly. Who <br/>
knows?? I can&#39;t even imagine. It would be like my grandmother imagining a <br/>
telephone before they had them. Yah know?<br/>
<br/>
What are the basics to you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483618371">+ Well now Leslie, after reading your post on multiplication,<br/>
+ you&#39;ve just gotten me going again with lots of questions.<br/>
<br/>
Pat.....wow--you are an intense person!  :-)  Keeping me on my toes--I like<br/>
that!  :-)  I was up with a throwing-up child last night and am coming down<br/>
with some sort of respiratory thing myself...hope you can make heads or<br/>
tails out of what I&#39;m about to say!<br/>
<br/>
+ Your<br/>
+ son&#39;s difficulty motivating himself to learn certain math basics<br/>
+ makes me wonder.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say he&#39;s having difficulty motivating himself to learn certain<br/>
math basics......honestly, I don&#39;t see it that way at all.  You don&#39;t know<br/>
my son, so I can see how you might think this.  My son just hasn&#39;t learned<br/>
them YET.  They haven&#39;t had compelling relevance to him yet.  They will when<br/>
he needs them for Algebra or for something else and I&#39;m positive he&#39;ll learn<br/>
them in just seconds or minutes.  (Incidentally, even though he hasn&#39;t<br/>
started the American School algebra course yet, he has done lots of algebra<br/>
just because he found it interesting.)  He learns so effortlessly, it seems<br/>
to me, and I have no doubt that if/when he chooses to memorize his<br/>
multiplication tables, for example, he will do so very quickly.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>
motivation problem, though...If I were to look at it as a problem, I would<br/>
see it as a timing one.<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to my story about Matthew learning physics when he &quot;should&quot;<br/>
have been learning English the other day.....  Would it have been more<br/>
desirable to tell him, &quot;put down that physics book right now and memorize<br/>
your multiplication tables&quot;?  He&#39;s read dozens of HTML and JAVA<br/>
handbooks...should I tell him to put those aside until he learns Biology?<br/>
Why or why not?  How about if he is playing guitar?  Working on his Eagle<br/>
Scout project?  Just what are the &quot;basics&quot; in HIS life?<br/>
<br/>
+ There are several things I can think of that I would like to have<br/>
+ learned or would like to learn that I do not want to put the<br/>
+ effort into learning *on my own*.<br/>
<br/>
My answer to that would be that you can&#39;t have everything!  We all have 24<br/>
hours in a day.  We choose how to spend those hours. We are not victims of<br/>
the clock....we have choices about the way we spend our time.  You say<br/>
you&#39;re not motivated to exercise on your own, so you seek out a situation<br/>
(companionship, coaching) to motivate you.  That&#39;s what my kids do, too.  In<br/>
fact, when they had decided to memorize their multiplication tables, they<br/>
did seek out my help to assist them and to help them stay focused.  (There<br/>
was a point at which they became disinterested, though--for now.)  At other<br/>
times, they have sought out different mentors or teachers or companions or<br/>
situations for things they wanted or needed to learn or do that were easier<br/>
with another motivator.  My son has taught himself to play the guitar, but<br/>
now wants to take lessons for some of those reasons.  He&#39;s taken computer<br/>
classes, sailing classes, he&#39;s gone to leadership training schools in other<br/>
states (with Scouts), my daughters both take art classes; one takes dance<br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
+ Is this because I was taught<br/>
+ in ps or is it because self-discipline and self-motivation<br/>
+ require a lot of energy and my desire has not reached that level,<br/>
+ or is it because I have other responsibilities at this time in my<br/>
+ life that take priority?<br/>
<br/>
I would guess &quot;all of the above&quot;, but primarily the latter (other<br/>
responsibilities that take priority).  24 hours in a day....<br/>
<br/>
+ Multiplication tables are like exercise<br/>
+ and for your son, physics is like winning a national medal.<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t see it like that, nor does he.  He studies physics only because<br/>
he enjoys it.  (Go figure!  I HATE IT!!!  His knowledge surpassed mine when<br/>
he was about 6 and I&#39;m not exaggerating.)  It is neither an &quot;exercise&quot; nor a<br/>
&quot;medal&quot;....it is the process he enjoys--he isn&#39;t working toward some end<br/>
goal.  Yes, he will need additional math skills to proceed with physics much<br/>
further....but they aren&#39;t *separate* skills to him....they&#39;re all part of<br/>
the whole.  He&#39;s not learning math so he can learn physics....he&#39;s just<br/>
learning about things he is interested in.  They interweave.<br/>
<br/>
+ Buying a curriculum to motivate him to do basic math is not the<br/>
+ answer because the child still has to *motivate himself* to do<br/>
+ work he doesn&#39;t really want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t buy him a curriculum to motivate him to do math....I bought him<br/>
numerous resources to assist him when he wants to learn more math.  I don&#39;t<br/>
have an assumption that he &quot;doesn&#39;t really want to do&quot; it.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
think that, necessarily, he has to &quot;motivate himself&quot;....perhaps there will<br/>
be some outside influence that will serve to motivate him.  (It was this way<br/>
with his spelling when others began reading his writing in Boy Scouts....his<br/>
spelling improved dramatically almost overnight.)  Motivation comes from<br/>
many places....including his parents at times--directly or indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
+ How can we make it easier for<br/>
+ our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not<br/>
+ all that much fun?<br/>
<br/>
Can you give a specific example?  I still maintain that learning does *not*<br/>
have to be &quot;fun&quot; to entice kids to do it.  In fact, I think that is one of<br/>
the most severe of the mistakes that mass education makes.  I shy away from<br/>
the workbooks with &quot;busy work&quot; to make things &quot;fun&quot;.  (Things like word<br/>
searches and crossword puzzles, for example.)  I hate those kinds of things,<br/>
and they&#39;re almost all you can find at the &quot;educational stores&quot;.  Not that<br/>
learning *can&#39;t* be fun....of course it can.....but some of the times that<br/>
I&#39;ve witnessed my kids taking the greatest strides in their learning was<br/>
when they were MAD or FRUSTRATED or PERPLEXED or BORED or EMBARRASSED.  When<br/>
the adult takes responsibility for &quot;making it fun&quot;, the child is<br/>
disenfranchised--their right to their own learning is usurped.  Then the<br/>
child&#39;s role in their education is once again relegated to the passive<br/>
role---&quot;entertain me&quot;/&quot;educate me&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And re: &quot;learning the basics&quot;:  One sentence in that post I wrote suggested<br/>
asking other homeschooling parents about what they consider to be<br/>
&quot;necessary&quot;....or a sign of &quot;education&quot;.  I bet you can all think of<br/>
examples like this in the homeschooling families you know....  One<br/>
homeschooling friend I have is always ranting about how little ps kids know<br/>
about world history and then going on and on about all these kings and<br/>
queens and wars and ancient history.  I know almost *nothing* about any of<br/>
these kinds of things and, other than a most bare outline, I don&#39;t think it<br/>
is important for my kids to ever know unless they want to.  I&#39;m 38 and have<br/>
never needed to know any of that stuff; I don&#39;t consider it &quot;the basics&quot; at<br/>
all, but my friend does.<br/>
<br/>
+ IMO there is a benefit to knowing the basics.<br/>
<br/>
Sure there is!  And because there *is* a benefit, unschoolers will have no<br/>
problems learning them in their own time frame.<br/>
<br/>
+ I wish I could<br/>
+ build furniture but I was never taught the basics and I have<br/>
+ decided not to pursue this as a hobby because it requires too<br/>
+ much energy to go back and learn from scratch.  I know some women<br/>
+ that wish they could cook.  They never learned the basics and<br/>
+ have decided it is too much trouble to learn now.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s lame.....it&#39;s never to late to learn *if* you really want to<br/>
know.  There are lots of things I&#39;d *like* to learn, but only a few I have<br/>
time for at any given time; therefore, I&#39;m making a choice, right?  Ranking<br/>
things in relative importance in my life.  If a woman really wants to learn<br/>
to cook, how hard would that be to do??  No one ever taught me a thing about<br/>
cooking...I was self-taught--unschooled.  I have a friend who amazes me with<br/>
all the things she will tackle on her own.  There are no excuses--if you<br/>
really wanted to learn--if it were really a priority for you--you could do<br/>
it.  We live in the age of the Internet, after all!  Above all, I want my<br/>
kids to know that it is possible for them to learn *whatever* they want.<br/>
(Even when there is no one around to make it &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;easier&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
+ Can we get bye<br/>
+ without these skills?  Yes.  Would there be more possibilities in<br/>
+ life if we all had the basics covered?  Yes.  It is easier to<br/>
+ cover the basics when you are young and have a lot of time.<br/>
<br/>
Bull hockey!  (Pardon my French....and nothing personal, Pat!)  We all have<br/>
24 hours in a day no matter how old we are.  My kids are often busier than I<br/>
am.  One of the lies that school taught us is that &quot;the basics&quot; take a long<br/>
time to learn.  John Taylor Gatto says that we could learn *all* the basics<br/>
in just 100 hours.  I&#39;ve heard others say the same sort of thing.  In the<br/>
early part of this century, people spent FAR FAR less time in school than<br/>
kids do now and learned much more than we do.<br/>
<br/>
+ Institutions cover the basics of many areas.  How do we provide<br/>
+ this for our unschooled children and still unschool?<br/>
<br/>
Pat, this isn&#39;t a rhetorical question:  What do you consider &quot;the basics&quot;<br/>
and why?<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I do for my children in terms of &quot;basics&quot; is to expose them<br/>
to as much of the &quot;real world&quot; as possible....so that they have a clear<br/>
understanding of what *is* important to learn and why.  I also have regular<br/>
discussions with them about their learning and what they would like to do<br/>
better or learn more about and how I can help.  There have been situations<br/>
where I have pointed out when certain &quot;basics&quot; would come in handy in their<br/>
own lives.  (Like Matthew&#39;s spelling when he was feeling self-conscious<br/>
about it in Scouts.)  I try to nurture their confidence that nothing is<br/>
&quot;beyond&quot; them--they can learn whatever they choose to learn.  And that they<br/>
are responsible for seeing that their own lives are successful (or not),<br/>
though I love them and am there to help if they desire it.  And that they<br/>
have choices in and control over their lives.<br/>

(others bored with this can delete here and you won&#39;t miss a thing <br/>
I&#39;ve told this story before... and before and before &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My oldest dd decided about 2 yrs ago that she wants to become a <br/>
doctor. This occurred after watching Trauma in  the ER . She asked me <br/>
what it takes to become a doctor and I, having no clue, went to <br/>
Borders and bought a few books on becoming a doctor (written by <br/>
doctors.. one female). I read them ( more on why *I* read them rather <br/>
than dd reading them to follow) and reported back that it&#39;s a tough <br/>
road, full of obstacles and costly and all the negatives plus the <br/>
positives. Because it is such a monumental task in my eyes, I <br/>
suggested she go to the hospital and follow a doctor around to see if <br/>
that&#39;s what she really liked. I mean, tv is one thing... real life <br/>
guts spilled out on a table is another. Well, the arrangements were <br/>
made and she *voluntarily* got up and out of the house by 6:00 AM <br/>
(this from a child who regularly sleeps till noon or later) and when <br/>
she got there, my friend who arranged this got some scrubs for Katie <br/>
and they were off.  I was to come back in 5-6 hours. I figured that <br/>
when I returned, she&#39;d be sick on her stomach, white as a sheet and <br/>
certain that being a doctor was *not* what it&#39;s cracked up to be. <br/>
Well sir, Mothers should never think &lt;bwg&gt; because we&#39;re always <br/>
wrong! &lt;g&gt;  I have never *seen* her so psyched over something! She <br/>
loved this better than anything she&#39;s ever done... including <br/>
gymnastics and dance and all the fun stuff she does. <br/>
The next step was to tell her what all she needs to study to become a <br/>
doctor and how important SAT&#39;s and GPA&#39;s are in this field because of <br/>
the difficulty of getting into med school.  After I spread the tough <br/>
stuff on thick, her response was &quot;get the books. I&#39;m ready.&quot;  Then <br/>
and since then, she&#39;s had me get the following... and I&#39;ll denote the <br/>
ones she uses with a &quot; * &quot;<br/>
Anatomy and Physiology***(her absolute favorite)<br/>
Conceptual Physics*<br/>
Harold Jacob&#39;s Elementary Algebra*<br/>
Harold Jacobs Geometry... on back order as we speak<br/>
College Biology book from Goodwill*<br/>
Latin (bummed out)<br/>
Spanish (bummed out)<br/>
Chemistry book (used from local prep school)*<br/>
<br/>
I never, ever have to force or encourage her to &quot;do schoolwork&quot;. She <br/>
has set her goal, knows what it takes and *she* is in charge. All I&#39;m <br/>
doing is guiding her and trying to make it a smooth ride whenever I <br/>
can. For example, in 8th grade she took the SAT to see how she&#39;d do <br/>
and although for an 8th grader it was good, the results were not what <br/>
she expected. That is why I&#39;ve been asking the list for SAT prep <br/>
information... to determine what would be the best &#39;next step&#39; for <br/>
her. Clearly, she&#39;ll improve because she has studied a lot more stuff <br/>
since initially taking the SAT but because this goal is so important <br/>
to her and because I see her taking all the other steps to reach this <br/>
goal, I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to find out about this SAT deal and <br/>
what can be done. I&#39;ll present her with my findings in the end and <br/>
she&#39;ll decide what, if anything, she wants to do about it. <br/>
.. oh, and by the way, she never sat down and memorized the <br/>
multiplication tables :-). That was never isolated out of the bigger <br/>
picture.... learning the multiplication tables became necessary to do <br/>
the Algebra.  Over time, as she has had to use them, she has learned <br/>
them with use of a calculator but there never was a moment when we <br/>
used flash cards and drill and kill and so on.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, back to the &#39;me researching rather than her&#39; thing.  Katie does <br/>
not like to read for pleasure. She will read factual books but even <br/>
then, she&#39;d rather glean the information some other way. The other <br/>
day she was bugging dh over something from the physics book. They sat <br/>
at the table and he was describing what he had read and I interrupted <br/>
and said, &quot;Katie, can&#39;t you read that yourself? Do you not understand <br/>
it??&quot; She replied... with a grin... &quot;oh, I understand it, Mom. I just <br/>
hate to read. I&#39;d rather Daddy just tell me what it says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the desire/passion is there, the motivation easily follows. Very <br/>
simple but something I think we all struggle with because we came <br/>
from a different mindset.<br/>
 <br/>
All I can say is, I hope all those medical journals come as &quot;books on <br/>
tape&quot; !<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549607867">Well Leslie that was a real mouth full and thank you for taking the time even when you weren&#39;t feeling well.  I so appreciate your directness.  I hate not really knowing what people are thinking because they are concerned about hurting my feelings.  These discussion are meant to help people sort things out.  This is good!<br/>
 In an earlier post I wrote:<br/>
+ How can we make it easier for<br/>
+ our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not<br/>
+ all that much fun?<br/>
<br/>
Leslies response to my question:<br/>
<br/>
+ Can you give a specific example? <br/>
<br/>
Examples would be handwriting, multiplication and addition facts, grammar, learning a foreign language and possibly some academics necessary for college.  I see that you don&#39;t feel it is our responsibility to &quot;entertain or educate&quot;.  That sure makes my job easy!<br/>
<br/>
So why is learning to brush ones teeth or using good manners more important than learning to write legibly?  I could take the same approach with basic life skills and figure when my kids got embarrassed enough about their poor hygene they would do something about it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m 99% sold on everything you are saying, but there is still that darned 1%.  This is what is bothering me - I think twice a day teeth brushing is an important daily habit. My kids don&#39;t seem to think the same.  I still have to ask my 10 and 12 yos if they brushed their teeth, they don&#39;t always remember.  I don&#39;t make it fun for them, I talk to them about the importance of it, I&#39;ve helped them with a routine so they will always remember,and I model good hygene myself, so what&#39;s up with that!!  Do you realize how much easier life is when we learn to clean as we go instead of letting things get way out of hand and then getting mad, frustrated, embarrassed etc. enough to try to learn to be neat.  It takes years of small incremental training to develop good life skills, why not take the same approach to some of the basic academic skills?<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I think you will say.  If the kids don&#39;t brush their teeth, they will develop tooth decay and that is a consequence far different from being embarrassed about your spelling.  If however there was no health related issue with not brushing their teeth, then they would remember to brush their teeth on their own once they wanted to.  So how about this for a come back, why do they have to get to the point of being embarrassed in order to start brushing their teeth? So now what do you say?<br/>

Do you ever wonder what you might have done with your cello playing if you had learned at an earlier age?  <br/>

Do your children play an instrument?  Just curious.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t have to get to the point of embarrassment. It can be a <br/>
situation where they experience sensitive teeth and pain associated <br/>
with the gums being irriated. I don&#39;t think embarrassment is the <br/>
*key* to getting them to brush, although it sure works a *lot* of the <br/>
time, especially when they are teens! <br/>

I loved the story about your daughter.  I read it after replying to Leslie with more questions that show how I just don&#39;t get the big picture yet.  My 12 yo dd has already decided she wants to be an astronaut or work in a space related field.  We went to a science museum when there were astronauts speaking and asked some questions.  She now knows she will need to get a PhD and work in a math or science field to be considered.  She says that she will probably be an engineer.  I guess I should look into engineering careers so we can give her more of an in depth look.  She is not asking what she needs to know in order to be an engineer, maybe I should look into that too.<br/>

I&#39;ve told this story before... and before and before &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
My oldest dd decided about 2 yrs ago that she wants to become a <br/>
doctor. This occurred after watching Trauma in  the ER . She asked me <br/>
what it takes to become a doctor and I, having no clue, went to <br/>
Borders and bought a few books on becoming a doctor (written by <br/>
doctors.. one female). I read them ( more on why *I* read them rather <br/>
than dd reading them to follow) and reported back that it&#39;s a tough <br/>
road, full of obstacles and costly and all the negatives plus the <br/>
positives. Because it is such a monumental task in my eyes, I <br/>
suggested she go to the hospital and follow a doctor around to see if <br/>
that&#39;s what she really liked. I mean, tv is one thing... real life <br/>
guts spilled out on a table is another. Well, the arrangements were <br/>
made and she *voluntarily* got up and out of the house by 6:00 AM <br/>
(this from a child who regularly sleeps till noon or later) and when <br/>
she got there, my friend who arranged this got some scrubs for Katie <br/>
and they were off.  I was to come back in 5-6 hours. I figured that <br/>
when I returned, she&#39;d be sick on her stomach, white as a sheet and <br/>
certain that being a doctor was *not* what it&#39;s cracked up to be. <br/>
Well sir, Mothers should never think &lt;bwg&gt; because we&#39;re always <br/>
wrong! &lt;g&gt;  I have never *seen* her so psyched over something! She <br/>
loved this better than anything she&#39;s ever done... including <br/>
gymnastics and dance and all the fun stuff she does. <br/>
The next step was to tell her what all she needs to study to become a <br/>
doctor and how important SAT&#39;s and GPA&#39;s are in this field because of <br/>
the difficulty of getting into med school.  After I spread the tough <br/>
stuff on thick, her response was &quot;get the books. I&#39;m ready.&quot;  Then <br/>
and since then, she&#39;s had me get the following... and I&#39;ll denote the <br/>
ones she uses with a &quot; * &quot;<br/>
Anatomy and Physiology***(her absolute favorite)<br/>
Conceptual Physics*<br/>
Harold Jacob&#39;s Elementary Algebra*<br/>
Harold Jacobs Geometry... on back order as we speak<br/>
College Biology book from Goodwill*<br/>
Latin (bummed out)<br/>
Spanish (bummed out)<br/>
Chemistry book (used from local prep school)*<br/>
<br/>
I never, ever have to force or encourage her to &quot;do schoolwork&quot;. She <br/>
has set her goal, knows what it takes and *she* is in charge. All I&#39;m <br/>

her. Clearly, she&#39;ll improve because she has studied a lot more stuff <br/>
since initially taking the SAT but because this goal is so important <br/>
to her and because I see her taking all the other steps to reach this <br/>
goal, I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to find out about this SAT deal and <br/>
what can be done. I&#39;ll present her with my findings in the end and <br/>
she&#39;ll decide what, if anything, she wants to do about it. <br/>
.. oh, and by the way, she never sat down and memorized the <br/>
multiplication tables :-). That was never isolated out of the bigger <br/>
picture.... learning the multiplication tables became necessary to do <br/>
the Algebra.  Over time, as she has had to use them, she has learned <br/>
them with use of a calculator but there never was a moment when we <br/>
used flash cards and drill and kill and so on.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, back to the &#39;me researching rather than her&#39; thing.  Katie does <br/>
not like to read for pleasure. She will read factual books but even <br/>
then, she&#39;d rather glean the information some other way. The other <br/>
day she was bugging dh over something from the physics book. They sat <br/>
at the table and he was describing what he had read and I interrupted <br/>
and said, &quot;Katie, can&#39;t you read that yourself? Do you not understand <br/>
it??&quot; She replied... with a grin... &quot;oh, I understand it, Mom. I just <br/>
hate to read. I&#39;d rather Daddy just tell me what it says.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the desire/passion is there, the motivation easily follows. Very <br/>
simple but something I think we all struggle with because we came <br/>
from a different mindset.<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is, I hope all those medical journals come as &quot;books on <br/>
tape&quot; !<br/>

I have natural musical talents. I play by ear, sing very well and can <br/>
remember music like the back of my hand. When it was &#39;discovered&#39; <br/>
that I could do this so easily, my parents made me sign up for music <br/>
lessons. I liked them at first but never was really crazy about them. <br/>
It felt like the need to get proper lessons was pushed way too soon <br/>
and sorta squashed my natural desire to do musical things. (the fun <br/>
was taken out of it and at an early age, it became a dreaded chore!).<br/>
I continued lessons because I was always told that was the *only* <br/>
thing I was good at and I was afraid that if I quit, I&#39;d not have a <br/>
single thing in life to identify me.  I got into college because of <br/>
my music... it *definitely* wasn&#39;t my unbelievably low SAT scores or <br/>
my GPA.<br/>
As soon as I discovered that I do, indeeed, have other &#39;talents&#39; and <br/>
can have an identity outside of music, I stopped playing and have had <br/>
NO desire to touch a note since. I still sing in the car with the <br/>
windows rolled up, though&lt;g&gt;.  Who knows where my musical talents <br/>
would have taken me had they not been shoved down my throat  <br/>
*earlier*.<br/>
p.s. I don&#39;t mean for this to sound like I&#39;m blaming my parents for <br/>
my outcome.... I pretty much dug my own hole way back when.<br/>

&gt; &gt;You don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; &gt;my son, so I can see how you might think this.  My son just<br/>
&gt; &gt;hasn&#39;t learned<br/>
&gt; &gt;them YET.  They haven&#39;t had compelling relevance to him<br/>
&gt; &gt;yet.  They will when<br/>
&gt; &gt;he needs them for Algebra or for something else and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt;positive he&#39;ll learn<br/>
&gt; &gt;them in just seconds or minutes.  (Incidentally, even<br/>
&gt; &gt;though he hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;started the American School algebra course yet, he has done<br/>
&gt; &gt;lots of algebra<br/>
&gt; &gt;just because he found it interesting.)  He learns so<br/>
&gt; &gt;effortlessly, it seems<br/>
&gt; &gt;to me, and I have no doubt that if/when he chooses to<br/>
&gt; &gt;memorize his<br/>
&gt; &gt;multiplication tables, for example, he will do so very<br/>
&gt; &gt;quickly.  It isn&#39;t a<br/>
&gt; &gt;motivation problem, though...If I were to look at it as a<br/>
&gt; &gt;problem, I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;see it as a timing one.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have an example to add to this line of thought, Pat. Maybe you just<br/>
&gt; need to read more examples of how this works???<br/>
&gt; (others bored with this can delete here and you won&#39;t miss a thing<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve told this story before... and before and before &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My oldest dd decided about 2 yrs ago that she wants to become a<br/>
&gt; doctor. This occurred after watching Trauma in  the ER . She asked me<br/>
&gt; what it takes to become a doctor and I, having no clue, went to<br/>
&gt; Borders and bought a few books on becoming a doctor (written by<br/>
&gt; doctors.. one female). I read them ( more on why *I* read them rather<br/>
&gt; than dd reading them to follow) and reported back that it&#39;s a tough<br/>
&gt; road, full of obstacles and costly and all the negatives plus the<br/>
&gt; positives. Because it is such a monumental task in my eyes, I<br/>
&gt; suggested she go to the hospital and follow a doctor around to see if<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s what she really liked. I mean, tv is one thing... real life<br/>
&gt; guts spilled out on a table is another. Well, the arrangements were<br/>
&gt; made and she *voluntarily* got up and out of the house by 6:00 AM<br/>
&gt; (this from a child who regularly sleeps till noon or later) and when<br/>
&gt; she got there, my friend who arranged this got some scrubs for Katie<br/>
&gt; and they were off.  I was to come back in 5-6 hours. I figured that<br/>
&gt; when I returned, she&#39;d be sick on her stomach, white as a sheet and<br/>
&gt; certain that being a doctor was *not* what it&#39;s cracked up to be.<br/>
&gt; Well sir, Mothers should never think &lt;bwg&gt; because we&#39;re always<br/>
&gt; wrong! &lt;g&gt;  I have never *seen* her so psyched over something! She<br/>
&gt; loved this better than anything she&#39;s ever done... including<br/>
&gt; gymnastics and dance and all the fun stuff she does.<br/>
&gt; The next step was to tell her what all she needs to study to become a<br/>
&gt; doctor and how important SAT&#39;s and GPA&#39;s are in this field because of<br/>
&gt; the difficulty of getting into med school.  After I spread the tough<br/>
&gt; stuff on thick, her response was &quot;get the books. I&#39;m ready.&quot;  Then<br/>
&gt; and since then, she&#39;s had me get the following... and I&#39;ll denote the<br/>
&gt; ones she uses with a &quot; * &quot;<br/>
&gt; Anatomy and Physiology***(her absolute favorite)<br/>
&gt; Conceptual Physics*<br/>
&gt; Harold Jacob&#39;s Elementary Algebra*<br/>
&gt; Harold Jacobs Geometry... on back order as we speak<br/>
&gt; College Biology book from Goodwill*<br/>
&gt; Latin (bummed out)<br/>
&gt; Spanish (bummed out)<br/>
&gt; Chemistry book (used from local prep school)*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never, ever have to force or encourage her to &quot;do schoolwork&quot;. She<br/>
&gt; has set her goal, knows what it takes and *she* is in charge. All I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; doing is guiding her and trying to make it a smooth ride whenever I<br/>
&gt; can. For example, in 8th grade she took the SAT to see how she&#39;d do<br/>
&gt; and although for an 8th grader it was good, the results were not what<br/>
&gt; she expected. That is why I&#39;ve been asking the list for SAT prep<br/>
&gt; information... to determine what would be the best &#39;next step&#39; for<br/>
&gt; her. Clearly, she&#39;ll improve because she has studied a lot more stuff<br/>
&gt; since initially taking the SAT but because this goal is so important<br/>
&gt; to her and because I see her taking all the other steps to reach this<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666984864">My boys are 8 yo.  Paul will usually brush his teeth once a day.  <br/>
Sometimes he&#39;ll forget for 2 or 3 days and he&#39;ll notice they feel kind <br/>
of yucky and then he&#39;ll start brushing them again.  He also  has <br/>
fingernails that grow incredibly fast and sometimes get to be very <br/>
long.  My husband and I used to clip them for him, but now he does this <br/>
on his own because he notices that dirt collects under them if they grow <br/>
to be too long, and he really doesn&#39;t like that.<br/>
<br/>
Paul&#39;s twin, Leroy, is another story.  He&#39;s a Juvenile Diabetic so I <br/>
have to insist that he brush his teeth 2 or 3 times a day.  It&#39;s <br/>
unpleasant for everyone.  He hates to do it and I hate insisting, but <br/>
it&#39;s necessary.  The dentist says he really should be brushing 5 or 6 <br/>
times a day.  I often feel guilty because he rarely brushes that often.  <br/>
But, we would be continually arguing and fighting over brushing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906058608">I&#39;m not sure how far I&#39;d go unschooling wise with the brushing teeth thing<br/>
since there are health risks (not just cavity) from not brushing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to modeling proper grammar, the language misuse on television has<br/>
always bugged me and I&#39;ve always &quot;corrected&quot; the announcers, actors, etc. as<br/>
we watch.  Eldest daughter (32 next month) decided that she needed some<br/>
college classes for job advancement.  The business college she decided on<br/>
told her she had to take a set curriculum.  This included Business English,<br/>
a report writing class and a transferable English class.  She aced them and<br/>
called to tell me that all my muttering at the television and my muttering<br/>
over the grant planning drafts I &quot;polished&quot; had paid off because she<br/>
remembered everything I had been ragging about.  The instructors had even<br/>
asked her about this because she was a re-entry student and it seems that a<br/>
lot of re-entry students have problems with English.  She got a real kick<br/>
out of telling them she didn&#39;t take English classes, that she didn&#39;t<br/>
graduate from a public high school and that she had learned all the grammar<br/>
and punctuation rules listening to her mother.<br/>
<br/>
Modeling works.  When your kids are older you will be surprised at how many<br/>
times they come back and tell you how much they learned just by being around<br/>
you.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well Leslie that was a real mouth full and thank you for taking the time<br/>
even when you weren&#39;t feeling well.  I so appreciate your directness.  I<br/>
hate not really knowing what people are thinking because they are concerned<br/>
about hurting my feelings.  These discussion are meant to help people sort<br/>
things out.  This is good!<br/>
&gt;  In an earlier post I wrote:<br/>
&gt; + How can we make it easier for<br/>
&gt; + our kids to learn the things that require practice but are not<br/>
&gt; + all that much fun?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Leslies response to my question:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; + Can you give a specific example?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Examples would be handwriting, multiplication and addition facts, grammar,<br/>
learning a foreign language and possibly some academics necessary for<br/>
college.  I see that you don&#39;t feel it is our responsibility to &quot;entertain<br/>
or educate&quot;.  That sure makes my job easy!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So why is learning to brush ones teeth or using good manners more<br/>
important than learning to write legibly?  I could take the same approach<br/>
with basic life skills and figure when my kids got embarrassed enough about<br/>
their poor hygene they would do something about it.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m<br/>
99% sold on everything you are saying, but there is still that darned 1%.<br/>
This is what is bothering me - I think twice a day teeth brushing is an<br/>
important daily habit. My kids don&#39;t seem to think the same.  I still have<br/>
to ask my 10 and 12 yos if they brushed their teeth, they don&#39;t always<br/>
remember.  I don&#39;t make it fun for them, I talk to them about the importance<br/>
of it, I&#39;ve helped them with a routine so they will always remember,and I<br/>
model good hygene myself, so what&#39;s up with that!!  Do you realize how much<br/>
easier life is when we learn to clean as we go instead of letting things get<br/>
way out of hand and then getting mad, frustrated, embarrassed etc. enough to<br/>
try to learn to be neat.  It takes years of small incremental training to<br/>
develop good life skills, why not take the same approach to some of the<br/>
basic academic skills?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is what I think you will say.  If the kids don&#39;t brush their teeth,<br/>
they will develop tooth decay and that is a consequence far different from<br/>
being embarrassed about your spelling.  If however there was no health<br/>
related issue with not brushing their teeth, then they would remember to<br/>
brush their teeth on their own once they wanted to.  So how about this for a<br/>
come back, why do they have to get to the point of being embarrassed in<br/>
order to start brushing their teeth? So now what do you say?<br/>

&gt; My boys are 8 yo.  Paul will usually brush his teeth once a day.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes he&#39;ll forget for 2 or 3 days and he&#39;ll notice they feel kind<br/>
&gt; of yucky and then he&#39;ll start brushing them again.  He also  has<br/>
&gt; fingernails that grow incredibly fast and sometimes get to be very<br/>
&gt; long.  My husband and I used to clip them for him, but now he does this<br/>
&gt; on his own because he notices that dirt collects under them if they grow<br/>
&gt; to be too long, and he really doesn&#39;t like that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Paul&#39;s twin, Leroy, is another story.  He&#39;s a Juvenile Diabetic so I<br/>
&gt; have to insist that he brush his teeth 2 or 3 times a day.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; unpleasant for everyone.  He hates to do it and I hate insisting, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s necessary.  The dentist says he really should be brushing 5 or 6<br/>
&gt; times a day.  I often feel guilty because he rarely brushes that often.<br/>
&gt; But, we would be continually arguing and fighting over brushing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995252272">It sounds like you may be the one to ask my *next* question. :-}<br/>
<br/>
Both my daughters took up an instrument when they were in ps.  My 10 yo played the violin in 3rd and 4th grade ps.  My older dd started in 5th grade and played in 5th and 6th grade ps.  This year, I&#39;ve been paying for private lessons so they could continue their instruments while they homeschool.  My 10 yo dd decided there was no purpose to playing the violin since she didn&#39;t have an orchestra to play with so she dropped it around Christmas.  My 12 yo dd likes her cello, likes going to her lesson but does not practice much.  I don&#39;t know the right way to handle this.  I have a feeling that at some point, she will get more into playing and practicing just because she enjoys it. On the other hand, it seems kind of odd to keep pay for lessons when she doesn&#39;t practice.  I asked her how long she thought I should continue to pay for her lessons if she wasn&#39;t practicing.  She said she planned on practicing more and would not give me an answer.  Any ideas?  <br/>

(excuse the intrusion, Tia. I also have to throw in another .02 on <br/>
this one as well as await to read your response).<br/>
<br/>
I have natural musical talents. I play by ear, sing very well and can <br/>
remember music like the back of my hand. When it was &#39;discovered&#39; <br/>
that I could do this so easily, my parents made me sign up for music <br/>
lessons. I liked them at first but never was really crazy about them. <br/>
It felt like the need to get proper lessons was pushed way too soon <br/>
and sorta squashed my natural desire to do musical things. (the fun <br/>
was taken out of it and at an early age, it became a dreaded chore!).<br/>
I continued lessons because I was always told that was the *only* <br/>
thing I was good at and I was afraid that if I quit, I&#39;d not have a <br/>
single thing in life to identify me.  I got into college because of <br/>
my music... it *definitely* wasn&#39;t my unbelievably low SAT scores or <br/>
my GPA.<br/>
As soon as I discovered that I do, indeeed, have other &#39;talents&#39; and <br/>
can have an identity outside of music, I stopped playing and have had <br/>
NO desire to touch a note since. I still sing in the car with the <br/>
windows rolled up, though&lt;g&gt;.  Who knows where my musical talents <br/>
would have taken me had they not been shoved down my throat  <br/>
*earlier*.<br/>
p.s. I don&#39;t mean for this to sound like I&#39;m blaming my parents for <br/>
my outcome.... I pretty much dug my own hole way back when.<br/>

I&#39;m wondering what would happen if you stopped taking responsibility <br/>

could allow you the opportunity to experiment with, say, brushing <br/>
teeth for a few months?  You know it must be pretty frustrating for <br/>

FREE FLIGHT FOR KIDS<br/>
If you have a child age 8-17, you can arrange for them to<br/>
have a free demonstration flight on a plane (usually small<br/>
personal prop planes). The Young Eagles Program is designed<br/>
to introduce young people to aviation. The pilot will<br/>
usually talk to the kids about the plane, aeronautical<br/>
charts/reference points, preflight inspections, instrument<br/>
panels, & the parts of the plane. While the flight is<br/>
usually a one day event, there are also summer programs<br/>
available at their headquarters. The flights can be found<br/>
all over the country. For more info on scheduling a flight<br/>
go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youngeagles.org">http://www.youngeagles.org</a><br/>
or Email yeagles@e..., or call (920)426-4831. What a<br/>
great Christmas idea. POST IT...near your phone.<br/>

&gt; Yes, I let the boys choose their own toothpaste also.  We used to use<br/>
&gt; the electric toothbrushes a few years ago, but we switched back to<br/>
&gt; traditional brushes because of the expense.  Teeth brushing has always<br/>
&gt; been a struggle with Leroy no matter what type of brush we use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, we haven&#39;t tried those battery-operated ones yet, so I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; definitely give those a try.  I&#39;ll let him pick it out himself, of<br/>
&gt; course.  Thanks for the suggestion.  I have to think more  positively!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Mimi,  we cured the toothbrushing problem with the youngest kidlet by<br/>
&gt; &gt; buying<br/>
&gt; &gt; her one of those battery operated toothbrushes.  They come in all kinds<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; shapes from movies now too.  Might be a thought to help ease of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; aggravation.  She also has her own toothpaste (she chooses it),<br/>
&gt; &gt; mouthwash<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Plax like stuff.  So, she &quot;owns&quot; brushing her teeth.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; My boys are 8 yo.  Paul will usually brush his teeth once a day.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes he&#39;ll forget for 2 or 3 days and he&#39;ll notice they feel kind<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; of yucky and then he&#39;ll start brushing them again.  He also  has<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; fingernails that grow incredibly fast and sometimes get to be very<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; long.  My husband and I used to clip them for him, but now he does this<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; on his own because he notices that dirt collects under them if they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; grow<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to be too long, and he really doesn&#39;t like that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Paul&#39;s twin, Leroy, is another story.  He&#39;s a Juvenile Diabetic so I<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; have to insist that he brush his teeth 2 or 3 times a day.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; unpleasant for everyone.  He hates to do it and I hate insisting, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; it&#39;s necessary.  The dentist says he really should be brushing 5 or 6<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; times a day.  I often feel guilty because he rarely brushes that often.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; But, we would be continually arguing and fighting over brushing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549443045">+ The Young Eagles Program is designed<br/>
+ to introduce young people to aviation.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done this--at least my husband and older kids did.  Also, Cafi Cohen<br/>
writes about the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) that her son, the pilot,<br/>
participated in when he was younger....that helped him get into the Air<br/>
Force (I think) academy.  A homeschooling friend of mine participates with<br/>
CAP here and really likes it.  In the Tulsa area alone there are 3 different<br/>
CAP programs--I&#39;m sure there is one in your area, Pat.  Here&#39;s a link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cap.gov/">http://www.cap.gov/</a><br/>
<br/>
(I just found another interesting space camp link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cosmo.org/">http://www.cosmo.org/</a><br/>
and, in doing so, remembered a space camp for homeschoolers that someone who<br/>
helped with GWS conferences put on last year or year-before.....anyone have<br/>
more details?)<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is a flight school near us and, in conjunction with Oklahoma<br/>
State University they run a summer flight camp.  You might call around and<br/>
see what you can find in your area.  My son went to it a couple years ago,<br/>
but was really disappointed with the wasted time....schooly kids who weren&#39;t<br/>
serious about being there.  But this year he is finally old enough for the<br/>
high school camp they do.  It is quite a bit more serious.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
he&#39;s interested in it or not yet--we just got the flyer for it in Friday&#39;s<br/>
mail and he was gone at a Scout campout all weekend.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not quite as interested in flying as he once was, though.  My<br/>
father-in-law and all 3 of his brothers fly.  They all flew in the military<br/>
and had small farm planes when they were younger.  I think just one of them<br/>
still has a plane.  One of my husband&#39;s uncles was a rocket<br/>
scientist--literally--for Boeing as an engineer.  Anyway, for a long time<br/>
there I really thought Matthew would want to be a pilot and I was trying to<br/>
come to terms with the whole military thing as that&#39;s the most common<br/>
&quot;route&quot; into aviation.<br/>
<br/>
My body aches from last night have turned into a full-blown raging flu, so<br/>
the other, more meaty post will have to wait until post-fever....  Ugh!<br/>

different from being embarrassed about your spelling.  If however <br/>
there was no health related issue with not brushing their teeth, then <br/>
they would remember to brush their teeth on their own once they <br/>
wanted to.  So how about this for a come back, why do they have to <br/>
get to the point of being embarrassed in order to start brushing <br/>
their teeth? So now what do you say?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
&gt; Pat<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is another one of those issues that is different for my son than <br/>
for my daughters.  I never had to order the girls to brush their <br/>
teeth.  They learned HOW from me when they were toddlers and they <br/>
just did it when they wanted to which was always enough to keep their <br/>
teeth reasonably healthy.  So, in most cases I think a hands off <br/>
approach can work for this kind of issue.  (However, do step in when <br/>
the gums are receding and the teeth are orange!)<br/>
<br/>
I also think neatness is genetic.  My dad was a pack-rat and so am I <br/>
and so are my kids.  My dad had no organizational genes though.  I <br/>
have a enough to get by and so do my girls.  We still don&#39;t live like <br/>
my mother would like, but we aren&#39;t wallowing in stuff either.  Now <br/>
that we have a room for everybody, I made it clear that I do not want <br/>
to be tripping on their stuff in the public areas.  My working <br/>
projects are contained to the area around my chair, theirs have to be <br/>
contained in an equal fashion.<br/>
<br/>
But then you get into the murky issue of handwriting.  My was <br/>
atrocious until I got to college.  My cursive is still atrocious.  I <br/>
print, my dad always printed and the brothers that were my dad lost <br/>
contact with when they were 4 and 6 print.  When I got in touch with <br/>
my half brother as an adult, I was SHOCKED at the similarity in our <br/>
writing.  There has to be a genetic link there.  <br/>
<br/>
I think being able to communicate is important but cursive writing <br/>
isn&#39;t.  Ask yourself if the child in question is capable of leaving <br/>
you a note that you can read.  If the answer is yes, the child is  <br/>
functional enough and can make his own decision about how important <br/>
neatness and practice are.  And it does not matter one bit if the <br/>
note is cursive, printed or typed.  As long as the child can <br/>
communicate when he needs to, all is well. (age is a factor here <br/>
too.  I think as teh mom of teens.  If you have toddlers, don&#39;t <br/>
expect note writing yet.)<br/>
