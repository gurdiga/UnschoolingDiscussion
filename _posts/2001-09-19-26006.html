<div id="ygrps-yiv-38925645">Below is an e-mail that I received from a client of mine when I told her that <br/>
I was unschooling my child.  She was talking about the problems her daughter <br/>
is having in school and homework etc and I said I couldn&#39;t help her with that <br/>
because I thought homework was unnecessary.  In the real world your boss <br/>
doesn&#39;t herd you altogether at the end of the day and assign you something to <br/>
do overnight that you are going to be graded on and compared to your <br/>
co-workers.  <br/>
<br/>
Please read and help me understand where this person is coming from and how <br/>
to respond.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Dawn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sorry you had such a bad school experience. I believe that teachers have an <br/>
obligation to make their curriculum engaging and relevant to their students, <br/>
as well as not waste their time with unnecessary of rote memorization. <br/>
However, let me point out some of the potential pitfalls of allowing learning <br/>
to be totally child-driven. <br/>
<br/>
Does a spell-checker eliminate the need for a child learning to spell <br/>
(definately a rote memorization task for English-speakers)? I ask job <br/>
applicants to fill out an application by hand. I want to know if their <br/>
handwriting is legible and whether they can follow simple directions. People <br/>
with spelling problems will only be considered if they have experience in the <br/>
field and good references as they come across as borderline illiterate.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly a person can use calculators to do computations and texts to look <br/>
up how to solve mathematical problems. But a person who cannot do a simple <br/>
problem quickly as an adult is mathematically illiterate. For example, an <br/>
adult should be able to figure out about how much paint to order to paint the <br/>
outside of a house, given the number of square feet a gallon should cover and <br/>
the ability to measure off the house. Even if you don&#39;t recall the exact <br/>
formula for finding the surface area of a triangle or rectangle, a person who <br/>
has taken geometry at least knows where to find the information quickly. <br/>
<br/>
Most of mankind has always been culturally illiterate, and certainly people <br/>
do just fine. But culturally educated people &quot;get&quot; the references made by <br/>
others. We KNOW &quot;for whom the bell tolls.&quot; Is there a huge value to <br/>
memorizing this 17th century poem? Not unless you&#39;re going to recite it to an <br/>
audience. Should every kid have read it before they graduate high school in <br/>
America (and the rest of the English-speaking world)? My vote is yes. Should <br/>
kids reading it for the first time today discuss it in the context of the <br/>
events of last week? Certainly!!! How is it a kid decides on his own to study <br/>
this particular poem out of millions published in the English language? With <br/>
the help of an educated adult, usually a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, all learning is self-driven, whether you&#39;re in a classroom or <br/>
not. The school systems have the task of turning out people proficient enough <br/>
in English and mathematics to effectively solve daily problems in the <br/>
business world and home life. Additionally, children need to be culturally <br/>
educated enough to understand our world, some of its history and intellectual <br/>
heritage, and the basics of the main scientific principles underpinning <br/>
modern life. The functioning of society relies on us having some amount of <br/>
common, general knowledge. (I like the thought of the Core Knowledge <br/>
curriculum group.) Unfortunately, the government sees the results of <br/>
standardized testing as the significant measure of success. <br/>
<br/>
In short (ha!), I agree there are plenty of people  who do well in life <br/>
without formal training. However, I have a great deal of respect for those <br/>
who pursue higher education. My answer to Mr. Shaw is that he achieved <br/>
literary success BECAUSE he received sufficient training in the drudgery of <br/>
English grammar and spelling so that he was then able to use these tools, in <br/>
concert with his innate talent, to generate his works.&quot;<br/>

&gt; field and good references as they come across as borderline illiterate.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one company&#39;s requirement. My husband (schooled, by the way, and a<br/>
high school graduate) is a dreadful speller. He had no problem getting jobs<br/>
in his field (construction estimating, project management, drafting)<br/>
throughout his pre-bookselling career. In some jobs, in some companies, a<br/>
spelling error on a application may be a factor. In many, it is not. My<br/>
husband&#39;s bosses cared whether he knew how to estimate the costs of a job<br/>
and whether he could manage sub-contractors and bring a job in on cost and<br/>
on time, not whether he knew to spell whether.<br/>
<br/>
The world is full of dreadful, schooled spellers who are working productive<br/>
lives. If spelling well IS a criteria for a particular job (and I can&#39;t<br/>
think of many offhand that wouldn&#39;t work with spell-checking -- even a vice<br/>
president of the U.S. can misspell &quot;potato&quot;. :)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Certainly a person can use calculators to do computations and texts to look<br/>

&gt; formula for finding the surface area of a triangle or rectangle, a person who<br/>
&gt; has taken geometry at least knows where to find the information quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have not the world&#39;s first idea of how to calculate how much paint<br/>
was needed to paint my house. None. My husband would, but let&#39;s say he<br/>
didn&#39;t: the guys at the paint store do. My nephew does. I don&#39;t need to know<br/>
everything. I am great with basic arithmetic (adding, subtracting,<br/>
multiplying, dividing) but I would have no more idea of where to find quick<br/>
information on geometrical formulas than I would how to find the Holy Grail<br/>
(and, further, I&#39;d have a lot less interest &lt;g&gt;). I was schooled, am 35<br/>
years old, and get through my days anyway. Most people don&#39;t even know that<br/>
I am by this person&#39;s definition &quot;mathematically illiterate&quot;. If they knew,<br/>
most people wouldn&#39;t care -- the parents in my girl scout troop would mostly<br/>
care that I&#39;m good at crafts and talking to their daughters; my dog training<br/>
friends would mostly care that I could give a good critique of what I could<br/>
see their dog doing from MY angle instead of theirs; my homeschooling<br/>
friends would care that I could talk on the phone to worried new<br/>
homeschoolers and help them find resources to make them more confident; my<br/>
family would care that I have extremely good instincts for finding books for<br/>
us to sell.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Culture is what the culture makes, not a few so-called classics hand-picked<br/>
by a few so-called experts. You want culturally literate? Know who Dexter<br/>
and his Lab are when you&#39;re talking to my 6 year old. You don&#39;t know a<br/>
muggle from a wizard? You won&#39;t last a day in a group of most 12 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
Or let&#39;s take my generation. &quot;Your mission, should you decide to accept&quot;<br/>
will get a laugh in a room of most adults over 30 or so. That&#39;s cultural<br/>
literacy.<br/>
<br/>
One particular 17th century poem is not more important across the board to<br/>
every human than any other poem, song, lyric, or ditty. The ideas put forth<br/>
in one particular poem are not completely unique to human knowledge: the<br/>
lesson in the bell tolling can be found from any number of other sources:<br/>
fact, fiction, experience, conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody knows everything. Nobody can know everything. Reading 17th century<br/>
poetry is not inherently more or less important than learning to bake a<br/>
decent cake, drive a nail, memorize a table of molds and mildews, sing every<br/>
song in the musical The Chorus Line, train a dog, drive a car, play the<br/>
banjo, speak German, know vast quantities of Disney trivia.<br/>
<br/>
One size does not fit all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Mark Twain said, &quot;I never let my schooling interfere with my education.&quot;<br/>
So Mr. Shaw may have been right for him, but that doesn&#39;t mean he was right<br/>
for every person. And unschooling would allow Mr. Shaw or Mr. Twain to<br/>
pursue their own path.<br/>

learning spelling is always a rote memorization task.  Not true for at <br/>
least many kids.  And two, that people will only learn to spell if they go <br/>
to school.  Besides that one being wrong, just look at the spelling of <br/>
people who have been through the system, including many who graduated from <br/>
university.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Certainly a person can use calculators to do computations and texts to look<br/>
&gt;up how to solve mathematical problems. But a person who cannot do a simple<br/>
&gt;problem quickly as an adult is mathematically illiterate. For example, an<br/>
&gt;adult should be able to figure out about how much paint to order to paint the<br/>
&gt;outside of a house, given the number of square feet a gallon should cover and<br/>
&gt;the ability to measure off the house. Even if you don&#39;t recall the exact<br/>
&gt;formula for finding the surface area of a triangle or rectangle, a person who<br/>
&gt;has taken geometry at least knows where to find the information quickly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, graduating from high school doesn&#39;t guarantee that people will be <br/>
able to do this, nor is it true that they won&#39;t be able to learn it when <br/>
they have a need to know it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Most of mankind has always been culturally illiterate, and certainly people<br/>
&gt;do just fine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder what she means by culturally illiterate.  Most people in most <br/>
cultures are literate in *their* culture.  Maybe she means Western culture <br/>
is the only one worth being literate in.  But which Western culture?  Most <br/>
North Americans are literate in their culture.....the TV/media/consumer <br/>
culture.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But culturally educated people &quot;get&quot; the references made by<br/>
&gt;others. We KNOW &quot;for whom the bell tolls.&quot; Is there a huge value to<br/>
&gt;memorizing this 17th century poem? Not unless you&#39;re going to recite it to an<br/>
&gt;audience. Should every kid have read it before they graduate high school in<br/>
&gt;America (and the rest of the English-speaking world)? My vote is yes. Should<br/>
&gt;kids reading it for the first time today discuss it in the context of the<br/>
&gt;events of last week? Certainly!!! How is it a kid decides on his own to study<br/>
&gt;this particular poem out of millions published in the English language? With<br/>
&gt;the help of an educated adult, usually a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So I can&#39;t understand what happened last week because I don&#39;t remember &quot;for <br/>
whom the bell tolls&quot;?  Because I certainly knew it once.  Since school just <br/>
exercised my short-term memory, it didn&#39;t stick with me.  Obviously it <br/>
wasn&#39;t relevant enough to me at the time to get into my long-term memory.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or maybe he achieved literary success *in spite* of his training in the <br/>
drudgery of English grammar and spelling.  Apparently Tolstoy dictated his <br/>
work, so he didn&#39;t even have to *know* spelling.  As a writer, I&#39;ve been <br/>
more hampered than helped by my formal schooling.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Sorry you had such a bad school experience. I believe that <br/>
teachers have an <br/>
&gt; obligation to make their curriculum engaging and relevant to their <br/>
students, <br/>
&gt; as well as not waste their time with unnecessary of rote <br/>
memorization. <br/>
&gt; However, let me point out some of the potential pitfalls of <br/>
allowing learning <br/>
&gt; to be totally child-driven. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does a spell-checker eliminate the need for a child learning to <br/>
spell <br/>
&gt; (definately a rote memorization task for English-speakers)? I ask <br/>
job <br/>
&gt; applicants to fill out an application by hand. I want to know if <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; handwriting is legible and whether they can follow simple <br/>
directions. People <br/>
&gt; with spelling problems will only be considered if they have <br/>
experience in the <br/>
&gt; field and good references as they come across as borderline <br/>
illiterate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Certainly a person can use calculators to do computations and texts <br/>
to look <br/>
&gt; up how to solve mathematical problems. But a person who cannot do a <br/>
simple <br/>
&gt; problem quickly as an adult is mathematically illiterate. For <br/>
example, an <br/>
&gt; adult should be able to figure out about how much paint to order to <br/>
paint the <br/>
&gt; outside of a house, given the number of square feet a gallon should <br/>
cover and <br/>
&gt; the ability to measure off the house. Even if you don&#39;t recall the <br/>
exact <br/>
&gt; formula for finding the surface area of a triangle or rectangle, a <br/>
person who <br/>
&gt; has taken geometry at least knows where to find the information <br/>
quickly. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most of mankind has always been culturally illiterate, and <br/>
certainly people <br/>
&gt; do just fine. But culturally educated people &quot;get&quot; the references <br/>
made by <br/>
&gt; others. We KNOW &quot;for whom the bell tolls.&quot; Is there a huge value to <br/>

amount of <br/>
&gt; common, general knowledge. (I like the thought of the Core <br/>
Knowledge <br/>
&gt; curriculum group.) Unfortunately, the government sees the results <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; standardized testing as the significant measure of success. <br/>
