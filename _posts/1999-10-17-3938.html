<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, trying to learn something in college was like trying to drink from a<br/>
fire hydrant, and, by all traditional measures, I was a &quot;good student&quot;; that<br/>
is if having a four year academic scholarship is proof of that.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I believe college degree mania is one of the biggest cons<br/>
going.  In many cases, getting a degree is more an indicator of how good a<br/>
teamplayer one is rather than how much one actually learned.  I have no<br/>
doubts that your dad is a better historian than your degreed sister.  He<br/>
probably learns history for more authentic, long-range, and significant<br/>
reasons than just to get certified and qualify for a job.  Also, his many<br/>
additional years of life give him the basis to understand history in a way<br/>
that young worldly inexperienced college students could never grasp.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; always telling him that what he&#39;s doing is really important for those<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kids.<br/>
<br/>
And someday he may be remembered fondly by many of them.  But more important<br/>
than that, I&#39;d be willing to bet he doesn&#39;t feel like a fraud.  Many (not<br/>
all) people in prestigious, big money careers are plagued with such<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; need to get way past the idea that our talents are only utilized well if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>

     I just read your Blue Collar essay and I loved it.  Your story is very <br/>
interesting and I agree strongly with your message.  I don&#39;t know if my dad <br/>
has reached a level of confidence yet where he values himself for who he is <br/>
completely but I would like to print up your essay and have him read it.<br/>
     One side thing I thought about while reading this: with a passion for <br/>
German Literature, you must have read Goethe.  I am just starting to read <br/>
him, having read some of his quotes in other books.  Are there any of his <br/>
writings that you would recommend in particular?  I am totally new to it.  <br/>
The book I bought is Goethe The Collected Works Volume 4,  From My Life  <br/>
Poetry and Truth (Parts One to Three).  I know I will probably lose some of <br/>
the flavor of it reading it in English but I&#39;m afraid my German is limited to <br/>
things like, &quot;How much does that cost?&quot; and &quot;Where is the bathroom?&quot; from the <br/>
three years we lived in Germany.  <br/>
     As always, thanks for sharing your thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
