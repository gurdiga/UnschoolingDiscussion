<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It really feels like he wants to be told what to do, to follow a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>curriculum,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and it seems to be about being like everyone else rather than any desire to<br/>
&gt;learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are kindof dealing with that here.  We went to look at math books at<br/>
Borders, because she (15) wanted to check them out.  There was one<br/>
recommended by Grace Llewellyn- Math for everyone (or something) and it had<br/>
things like balancing your check book and stuff.  Anyway, on the way out I<br/>
said something like &quot;I think it is silly to practice balancing your check<br/>
book, when you could just have a check book and balance it for real...&quot; and<br/>
I said a bunch more things..um..well the jist is this- what you want to do<br/>
is live your life - right - so when you get older you start thinking, well,<br/>
what is my life? is it good even if it is different? am I going in the<br/>
direction I want to be?<br/>
<br/>
so anyway- the real answer to the question &quot;should my life be different?&quot; is<br/>
not to go to borders or look through the genius tribe catalog to pick stuff<br/>
that interests you- or worse, much worse, pick stuff you think you should be<br/>
interested in and forcing yourself to do it, (or like in your son&#39;s case-<br/>
say you want someone ELSE to pick something for you to learn and force you<br/>
to do it!),  but instead to really think about the main &quot;umpf&quot;  in your life<br/>
and then work down till you have the nitty gritty day to day things you want<br/>
to do all fitting like a puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
SO we ordered this book:  (recommended HIGHLY by Grace Llewellyn in the<br/>
Genius Tribe Catalog- now defunct)<br/>
<br/>
First Things First: To Live, to Love, to Learn, to Leave a Legacy<br/>

She LOVED *Seven habits for highly effective teens* about three years ago<br/>
(she is 15) but I think this book takes life planning farther- I am going to<br/>
read it too!<br/>
We are also going to reread Teenage Liberation Handbook- I have to borrow it<br/>
because I lent mine to someone.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that your son is feeling some anger or something- maybe blameing<br/>
you for his unhappiness?  I don&#39;t know, of course.  I think a common<br/>
situation in homeschooling is for the mom to take a sort of role of<br/>
&quot;responsible for kid&#39;s happiness person&quot;  -  it is fun to give the gift of<br/>
something that would make them happy or knowledgeable- but I don&#39;t own<br/>
happiness or knowledge in my child - HE owns it, I am not *responsible* for<br/>
whether he is happy or knows something.  There are subtle differences in the<br/>
two attitudes in day to day life, which produces differences in the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I would write more but I have to go.<br/>
