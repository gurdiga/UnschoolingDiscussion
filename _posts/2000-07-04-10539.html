<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061026840">On August 18 we will be hosting a homeschooling family from <br/>
Belgium, Christine [Mom],  Guillaume [Dad], Irene [Grandmother], <br/>
Kevin, Sophie and Carmen [ages 3 to 8 I think].   I just received an <br/>
email from Christine asking if I knew of anyone in the towns listed <br/>
below who would be willing to host their family for a night or two.  If <br/>
anyone is interested please email me so that I can pass your <br/>
name and email address on to Christine.<br/>
<br/>
PART OF HER EMAIL WITH PLACES LISTED IS BELOW:<br/>
<br/>
We will stay with families contacted with GROWINGWITHOUT <br/>
SCHOOLING, an american association for homeschoolers and <br/>
SERVAS, an international free accomadating service for travellers <br/>
based on the will to build world peace. We are very glad to have <br/>
found a wonderful way to meet American people and know more <br/>
about your way of life. I&#39;m sure it will make our trip much different <br/>
than last year when we simply visited wonderful places. Our <br/>
program for this year is also very busy. Our itinerary and all<br/>
our visits are planned and it will surely be an interesting trip allowing<br/>
us to learn more about american history and culture,  discovering <br/>
other types of landscapes and climates. Thank you to be one of <br/>
our host during this exceptional experience !<br/>
I send you the list of the different towns where we did not find any<br/>
hosting family. Please tell us if you know someone there who could <br/>
host us for one or two nights never more.<br/>
