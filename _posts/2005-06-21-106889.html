&lt;&lt; To protect your privacy, you may also want to add &quot;All  <br/>
<br/>
information provided herein is considered privileged and <br/>
<br/>
confidential.  Any further disclosure of this information requires <br/>

written parental consent prior to such disclosure.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wanted to add here that one reason that irks me is that sometimes people will <br/>
send e-mail and say &quot;this may not be repeated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that&#39;s bullshit. <br/>
<br/>
Unless I agree in advance, what shows up in my e-mail or my mailbox is mine.  <br/>
If I want to print it out and stick it on my front door, I can do that.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a little kid saying &quot;I&#39;m going to tell you a secret and then you <br/>
can&#39;t tell anyone, but I broke a window.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wrong-o.   If it&#39;s my window and I didn&#39;t agree in advance to hear and <br/>
protect a secret, it&#39;s not a secret.<br/>
