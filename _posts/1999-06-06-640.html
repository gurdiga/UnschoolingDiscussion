<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006339955">I was downtown Charleston all day yesterday at &quot;Spoleto,&quot; an arts<br/>
festival, and right now am catching up on the 150+ emails which came in<br/>
while I was away from my computer, however I&#39;m going to post this little<br/>
note right now while I&#39;m thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading lots of messages from people on this list who mention going<br/>
to homeschool support group meetings. For some, they return home feeling<br/>
&quot;guilty.&quot; I&#39;m also reading messages about how non-homeschool &quot;friends&quot;<br/>
and/or family are laying the guilt trip on us or intimidating us (or our<br/>
kids) about &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have just made the unschooling choice for my 16yo daughter; pulled her<br/>
out of public school about a month ago. I am 44 yrs. old and she is my<br/>
youngest. This is all new to me and I&#39;m flying by the seat of my pants,<br/>
but I REFUSE to allow ANYONE to pass judgment on a decision I have made<br/>
for my family. When I was in my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s it MATTERED to me what<br/>
other people thought about me ~ my job, my kids&#39; performance, my house,<br/>
my husband. Now, in my 40&#39;s, I have FINALLY become so comfortable with<br/>
myself and who I am (I think the buzz word nowadays is &quot;authentic&quot;),<br/>
that I could care less what other people think. I&#39;m telling you, ladies<br/>
~ DON&#39;T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE COMPARISON TRAP. It&#39;s deadly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t belong to a homeschool support group. There is one at our church<br/>
which I have been invited to, but everyone there is homeschooling young<br/>
ones and they are all using curriculum. They don&#39;t even KNOW what<br/>
unschooling is. What would they possibly have to offer me that I might<br/>
need? I can find all the encouragement or advice I need on this list or<br/>
by surfing unschooling website or searching out a bona fide unschooling<br/>
group in my area. I think a lot of homeschooling groups are made up of<br/>
moms and dads who are there for no other reason than to flaunt their<br/>
child&#39;s &quot;progress/success.&quot; People are SO into that.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t associate with people or organizations who are going to tear you<br/>
down. Homeschooling is so good and right for the family, that Satan is<br/>
going to do everything he can to try and destroy it. Homeschooling is<br/>
bringing families together and couples together, and it is a very<br/>
personal and private and ~ as Martha Stewart would say ~ It&#39;s a good<br/>
thing!<br/>
<br/>
Women, go with your instincts with your kids. How dare anyone else ~<br/>
family or friend ~ secondguess your decisions/choices for your family. I<br/>
realize that they might love and care for you and your kids, but God<br/>
gave those children to YOU.<br/>
<br/>
A second message: I agree with the remarks about college. I do have one<br/>
daughter who always wanted to go to college and she did and she&#39;s got a<br/>
great job and she&#39;s happy. My husband has been trying to force our 20-yr<br/>
old son to go to school ... he just finished his first semester which he<br/>
flunked out. $500 wasted (it&#39;s a Tech College). I keep trying to tell my<br/>
husband that JB just isn&#39;t ready for school and he may never be ready<br/>
for school, but my husband believes that you have to have a college<br/>
degree to get a good job. Hogwash. My niece has a degree in journalism<br/>
and has been working as a waitress in a bar for seven years; my<br/>
girlfriend&#39;s son has a degree in history and the only job he can find is<br/>
as a dispatcher with a trucking firm. Duh. I wholeheartedly agree that<br/>
the important thing to a fulfilling life is not a job that pays well,<br/>
but a job in which one is happy. <br/>
<br/>
I worked outside the home for my church for seven years and was not<br/>
necessarily unhappy; but the place where I was REALLY happy was at home.<br/>
So I quit in January. I am LOVING being home, even though it is a<br/>
sacrifice. It&#39;s still the best decision I ever made. Life&#39;s just too<br/>
short to spend the majority of my time apart from my husband and my kids<br/>
and my grandchild.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies ~ do your own thing!<br/>

end of 4th and 6th grades. They wanted badly to meet other hsing youths. So<br/>
we tried a couple of support groups in the area.We found one about an hour<br/>
away and the boys seemed to make friends quickly, but this year, our second<br/>
year home, they found that they had nothing in common with the kids in the<br/>
group.  the other families did school at home, hsed for religious reasons,<br/>
farmed, etc. My children are home for educational reasons, unschool, and<br/>
love sports.  They continued to attend a few things, but you could see<br/>
there was nothing there. So we&#39;ve decided to just do our own thing from now<br/>
on.<br/>

hsing in the area, they either are eclectic or at least more relaxed.But<br/>
what is more important, the kids are friends, they share interests. Each of<br/>
my sons now has one close friend within 5 minutes now.  If only there was a<br/>

Lois,<br/>
After 5 years and several support groups, I fond that the best thing to do is <br/>
to find kids that your kids are compatible with and work from there.  Most of <br/>
my guys friends go to school, BUT their moms would like to hs them, just <br/>
can&#39;t afford a one person income.  However, they think along the same line as <br/>
we do and many times when we are going on field trips, they will take their <br/>
kids out of school for the day to go with us.  While I would like friends <br/>
that do hs, (you are so lucky!)  I just have to go with what I get.  I think <br/>
the support groups are only good for information, not support!  I have <br/>
friends that range from school at home abbeckaers to unschoolers and <br/>
everything in between.  Its just that their kids are to young or to old.  So, <br/>
we find friends at the music school or soccer field.  Maybe when we buy a <br/>
house, the new neighborhood will have the gift of hsing friends !!  Well, I <br/>
can dream can&#39;t I! ; &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349590826">I&#39;ve noticed something interesting about me and our support group.<br/>
I seem to need our group less and less.  It is nice to have people to<br/>
&quot;play&quot; with occasionally, but I shy away from the rest.  It gets to be<br/>
this obligation, which takes the fun out of all of it.  It seems that we<br/>
do fine just on our own.<br/>
Does anyone else feel like this?<br/>
I did just read the latest issue of F.U.N. news, and they had lots of<br/>
articles on support groups.  There was a Mom who wrote about dropping<br/>
out of her support group, and I&#39;m close......<br/>

seems that we do fine just on our own.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That happens with all kinds of volunteer work, though, which is one reason it <br/>
seems that those who DO continue to volunteer get cranky with those who <br/>
don&#39;t.  It happens at church, school support groups, any auxiliary group, La <br/>
Leche League, scouting, 4-H--it&#39;s not just homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was kinda cranky early on in this list when someone asked why old-timers <br/>
would come to get support from new unschoolers.   I don&#39;t go to my <br/>
homeschooling group meeting to get support.  I&#39;m sold.  I&#39;m confident.  I go <br/>
because I needed reassurance and help when I was new eight years ago and got <br/>
only some little help, sporadically and spottily, and I try to provide the <br/>
luxury to new newcomers that they can have some dependable, regular support <br/>
and some unschooled kids to see, watch and talk to.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a missionary element to all that sort of organization and leadership <br/>
of social action and political action and social-work group business.   Even <br/>
in social clubs, some people go way out of their way to organize the parties <br/>
and games and awards things.  It&#39;s just in some people&#39;s nature to be that <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s common in La Leche League for moms to come to the series of four <br/>
meetings ad be done.  If some of the older members don&#39;t keep coming, though, <br/>
when will new moms see older babies nursing?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling, but I do think it&#39;s common, and I think some people do their <br/>
community service in other ways than hanging in there and providing <br/>
organizational leadership.  It does get old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215643011">Dearest Ann,<br/>
	I have had the same experience with homeschool support groups, being <br/>
an unschooler.  All the hubbub that my support group puts on began to be <br/>
unappealing to me and my family.  &quot;Not another talent show,&quot; &quot;Not another <br/>
science fair,&quot; &quot;Not another field trip to some boring place,&quot; etc., was my <br/>
children&#39;s cry.  <br/>
	I enjoyed the fellowship MUCH more than did my children.  So, after <br/>
they stopped being involved, I stayed for a while just to be with other moms. <br/>
 But their curriculum-pushing became more and more their first line of <br/>
discussion and I felt more and more like an outsider.  (And in 1982 I had <br/>
STARTED the group for my kids to have friends and for me to have fellowship!  <br/>
Now it&#39;s like 1,000 member families or something and has all kinds of by-laws <br/>
and stuff, which I NEVER intended!  It&#39;s also become an exclusively Christian <br/>
group - which is fine, but also not the &quot;founding mother&#39;s&quot; intention!)  <br/>
	I even was still on the board and a contributing columnist for their <br/>
newsletter for a couple of years after my kids quit.  During my long illness, <br/>
(cancer - bone marrow transplant, chemo, radiation, surgeries, <br/>
recovery...)others had completely taken over and made the little friendly <br/>
club into something so different.<br/>
	Slowly I began to pull out of leadership, too.  It was hard for me <br/>
because this group was my &quot;baby.&quot;  But, they were so organized, had <br/>
non-profit status now, were so exclusivist, had a statement of faith to sign, <br/>
dues to pay (gosh, now you can&#39;t even GET the newsletter unless you&#39;re a <br/>
member!), etc.  <br/>
	So...now even though I still am friendly with some of the oldies that <br/>
still know me from way back, I don&#39;t go to any of their functions anymore.  I <br/>
still pay for membership just to keep up on what&#39;s going on (they don&#39;t even <br/>
put any info on their webpage), just for &quot;old time&#39;s sake,&quot; but I really am a <br/>
stranger now.<br/>
	My kids have grown up pretty much, now, as have I.  I don&#39;t need the <br/>
support in homeschooling terms, anymore, but this list seems to fit the bill <br/>
for me now.  So, you&#39;re growing up, now, Ann...you can now be the &quot;advisor.&quot;  <br/>
Love to you, Lynnie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543510036">&lt;&lt;others had completely taken over and made the little friendly <br/>
club into something so different.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like a commune that incorporates as a little town and then becomes a big <br/>
city.  That happens to the best of organizations of any sort, and there&#39;s a <br/>
huge sorrow in it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in the Society for Creative Anachronism for 22 years.  Twenty years <br/>
or so I was a corporate officer for four or five years.  I was again five <br/>
years ago.  The changes were just awful.  When I talk to people now about how <br/>
simple the club was and could be, they look at me like I&#39;m a grandma from <br/>
beyond the grave (well not quite THAT bad, but it&#39;s getting there. &lt;G&gt;).  The <br/>
rules books are extensive, and new members just take that for granted.  <br/>
Things used to be simple and easy and friendly.  Now just my household (my <br/>
own students and former students who have &quot;graduated&quot; up to other levels, and <br/>
their significant others and children and my husband&#39;s squires) is larger <br/>
than some whole shires,  and larger than baronies used to be when I joined <br/>
(although of course NOW baronies have to be three times that size and have <br/>
twice as many required offices and reports).  I don&#39;t really love this aspect <br/>
of growth.  It&#39;s fun for people to brag, &quot;OUR group has SIXTY FAMILIES!  But <br/>
the downside of that is that nobody can KNOW the sixty families.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t feel like a failure if your group grows beyond you.  It&#39;s the mark <br/>
of success, but just as with biological organisms, there&#39;s growth and death, <br/>
and the same goes for social constructs like clubs, fads, businesses based on <br/>
something new/current (like video arcades or head shops or tattoo <br/>
parlors--they can&#39;t ALL stay in business for thirty years when there&#39;s a <br/>
passing need).<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico the state homeschooling organization quit publishing the <br/>
newsletter and let their phone go.  This happened because it was no longer <br/>
really used or needed, as information is available elsewhere.  That&#39;s <br/>
success, in a way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616547675">I guess what is so strange, is that my kids are only 6, 4 and 3, and I already<br/>
feel like I&#39;ve grown out of our group.<br/>
Our group is very unstructured, but is starting to lean that way.<br/>
I find it easier and more enjoyable to just invite a family over to dinner or for<br/>

I know how you feel. My boys (11&12)enjoy each others company and have no <br/>
desire to do any social things with other homeschoolers. So needless to say, <br/>
we do almost nothing with them. I&#39;m always joking with them about being the <br/>
kids people talk about when the &#39;S&#39; word is mentioned. Their shy and quiet <br/>
and feel uncomfortable around a lot of strangers and I don&#39;t have a problem <br/>
with it. They&#39;ll come around at their own time. They just need time to grow. <br/>

&lt;&lt; How many of you out there have two homeschooling groups in your area?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

and the split was apparently VERY recent.  The person I spoke to at the <br/>
Christian support group asked me outright what my religious beliefs entailed <br/>
and when I told her I was a Christian she asked me what church and when she <br/>
found out I was Catholic, she gave me the number to the non-denominational <br/>
support group.  I&#39;ve been a member (of the non-denom. support group) for a <br/>
year now and I love the perspectives from the various members.  I think I may <br/>
have felt a bit out of place in the Christian group as my beliefs don&#39;t <br/>
totally match theirs.  Religion is often a topic at the non-denom. support <br/>
grp meetings and everyone is open, supportive of ideas/beliefs, and usually <br/>
learining something in the process of the discussions.<br/>
