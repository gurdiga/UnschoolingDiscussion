 </span></blockquote>I really like it too.  It&#39;s something I always try to remember and also try <br/>
to pass on to my kids.  I swiped it from the title of a book.  I never <br/>
finished the book, but I like the title.  Someone else asked it they could <br/>
use it.  I don&#39;t own it.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288990265">I found the quote so wonderful I used in a conversation also. I was talking with some ladies at church that homeSCHOOL and I put that emphasis there for obvious reasons. They usually make fun of me because they like to say that I do not ever teach my kids and they dont learn anything either. I think they are just jealous. <br/>
Anyhow, they were wondering how I respond to naysayers and rabid anti homeschoolers. I told them that other peoples opinions of me are none of my business. I thought it was brilliant. :-) (So thanks Tia...) They didnt get it! I think that they didnt get it because when we do hear others opinions of us we may tend to change what we are doing to conform to those said opinions. I think they would LIKE to unschool but feel that they could not because others may think that they are &quot;doing nothing&quot;. I told them I dont want to change from what I am doing because it works for me and my kids. I am not sure whether they got it then or not but they understood I think.<br/>
Anyhow that was my AHHAH!!! moment for the weekend and I thought I would share!<br/>
 God bless<br/>
