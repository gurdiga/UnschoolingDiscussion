<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193615186">Just want to say: I loved the googlisms;<br/>
and U.S. News mag came today with an article entitled<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The power of simple play&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dec. 8 issue, p.72.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like they are almost advocating unschooling (at least for the &quot;preschool&quot; years).<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve loved the concept of learning by play for over thirty years, I also loved this short article.<br/>
