<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068829681">Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
This is a Canadian film made by Zacharias Kunuk, an Inuit filmaker.  It&#39;s<br/>
called &quot;Atanarjuat, The Fast Runner&quot; and is in Inuktitut, subtitled in<br/>
English and runs about three hours.  I have not (to my dismay) seen it yet,<br/>
but know folks who have liked it very much.  It is based on an Inuit legend<br/>
and won Canadian film awards, plus the Cannes Palme d&#39;or for Best First<br/>
Feature Film.  It&#39;s available in DVD, but not sure about VHS.<br/>
<br/>
You can Google it, too.  This review looked good:<br/>

P.S. This is my first post on this list (invited by Tia, been lurking for<br/>
months).  Will do an intro shortly.<br/>
