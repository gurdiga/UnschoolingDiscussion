<div id="ygrps-yiv-841356224">Thanks to everyone for the words of wisdom, good ideas and a shoulder <br/>
to cry on.  I&#39;m feeling much better.<br/>
<br/>
I posted a request for field trip ideas on a local list and got lots <br/>
of good ones.  I ordered some butterfly chrysalises.  We plan on <br/>
starting an international lunch get together with another homeschool <br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>
In general I feel like I have some focus and that it is fine if I do <br/>
the learning and introduce my kids to what I&#39;ve learned.  It will <br/>
enrich their lives in some way even if it is just the fact that I <br/>
cared enough to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to worry about the fact that they don&#39;t have the focus <br/>
(yet or never will?).  I will still be making a happy, stimulating <br/>
environment for them to grow in.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Pat</div>
