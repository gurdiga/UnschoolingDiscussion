 </span></blockquote>I can never figure out how to answer this question. I actually wrote a<br/>
whole essay on it once, which is somewhere on my computer that&#39;s in<br/>
storage. <br/>
<br/>
At 2 1/2 the girls across the hall were in K and grade 1, and they came<br/>
over a lot ot play and would play &quot;school&quot; with her (which she loved,<br/>
btw). They taught her to spell &quot;cat&quot; and she would run around saying<br/>
&quot;C-A-T cat&quot; a lot. I think she already knew most of her letters, I&#39;m not<br/>
sure, maybe they taught her. <br/>
<br/>
One day right around her third birthday, she was writing &quot;C-A-T&quot; with<br/>
blocks - not alphabet locks, regular blocks that she was using to form<br/>
huge letters. Then something clicked in her little head, she took apart<br/>
the C, made an &quot;M&quot; and said, &quot;Look - M-A-T, mat&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A few months later she found the BOB books at Borders - we were hanging<br/>
out there to beat the heat in Phoenix because of air condiioner had<br/>
broken. She found them, read the first two at the store, so I bought them<br/>
and she read the rest over the next few weeks. I think I got the next set<br/>
a few months later but she only read the first one or two, her interest<br/>
in phonics waned abfter the basic letter sounds and short vowel sounds.<br/>
<br/>
So, it continued like that for a year or two, she slowly read more but it<br/>
was never a big jump... when she was 5 she was reading those Step 2<br/>
books, but it wasn&#39;t until about 6 1/2 when something clicked and she<br/>
could suddenly read everything, effortlessly...<br/>
<br/>
Someone told me that they had noticed an incresed  interest in writeing<br/>
beginning about two years after reading in a lot of unschooled kids, and<br/>
I&#39;ve kind of seen that. She didn&#39;t want to write anything when she was 7,<br/>
but at 8 she&#39;s written some poems, some letters, stuff like that, and<br/>
begun a few books (usually by writing 3 or 4 sentences).<br/>
