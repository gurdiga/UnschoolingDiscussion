<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251298399">Okay.. somewhere, and I&#39;m pretty sure it was here, I read a great explanation <br/>
to use to explain to someone why there&#39;s no reason to test children... Maybe it <br/>
wasn&#39;t here and I&#39;m hoping for some help from here... now I&#39;m rambling.<br/>
<br/>
Last week a co-worker was asking me if I was testing my son to make sure he was <br/>
&quot;progressing&quot;... love that word, don&#39;t you!  I tried to explain to this <br/>
gentleman that as far as I was concerned Sean was progressing.  He was happy, <br/>
we hadn&#39;t seen any temper tantrums in months, he giggled (hadn&#39;t seen that in <br/>
years) and actually came to me for love and affection and liked to spend time <br/>
with me... another thing that had been stolen from him by ps!!!  In fact, I can <br/>
actually say I love being around him and I even &quot;like&quot; him now.... please tell <br/>
me you understand that feeling....<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s not progression, what is?????????  Anyway, he got on his high horse <br/>
about how important tests are and because my two older kids have done great in <br/>
the ps system I know how important they are as well...... yada, yada, yada.  I <br/>
tried to explain that Sean wasn&#39;t Nick and Shevaun and to expect him to have <br/>
the same needs or desires was just not fair.   I know I lost that one, and i <br/>
want to be prepared the next time... can someone help me, please?<br/>
<br/>
What would be a good response to the testing question???  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the input.<br/>

Ask him what his scores were in school and whether it has made him a happier <br/>
adult!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Having a happy 14 yo is a major triumph in and of itself.  If the horse&#39;s <br/>
patoot you were talking to can&#39;t relate to that, then what hope that he will <br/>
see beyond the &quot;beauty&quot; of a standardized test? <br/>
<br/>
Smiling and walking away works really well sometimes.  imo<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Testing is probably useful in classes of 20 - 30 kids.  How can the teacher <br/>
possibly know who &quot;got it&quot; and who didn&#39;t.  We *know* what our kids &quot;get&quot; <br/>
and know because they&#39;re with us so much.  The homeschoolers I know who do <br/>
use testing say that it only confirms what they knew anyway.<br/>
