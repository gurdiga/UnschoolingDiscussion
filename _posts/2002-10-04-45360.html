&gt; decide they don&#39;t really want it after all.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are right NOW in the midst of an ongoing and really difficult discussion <br/>
about joining or not joining a 4-H Horse Group. My daughter (11 1/2) is <br/>
already taking horseback riding lessons - has been for 2 years. She goes once <br/>
a week to a quiet peaceful equestrian center and has a private lesson with a <br/>
sweet teacher and it is all very very relaxed and easy (she even often rides <br/>
a horse named, &quot;Easy&quot;) and she loves it. I&#39;m thinking it is enough <br/>
&quot;horsiness&quot; for her - she&#39;s happy, it is convenient (it is expensive - but <br/>
we&#39;ve adjusted to the expense by now, so it isn&#39;t killing us anymore).<br/>
<br/>
4-H is much much more consciously intentionally &quot;educational&quot; - they meet <br/>
weekly for 2 hours as a group - up to 8 kids all in the same level (of five <br/>
levels). They study horses - anatomy, health, feed, care, genetics, tack, <br/>
etc. -- everything to do with horses. As they learn, they have all those <br/>
typical 4-H opportunities to put together presentations for &quot;demo days&quot; and <br/>
county fairs and so on. There is a large amount of recordkeeping. <br/>
<br/>
At her level, they also get to go to the stables and take a horse out and <br/>
just ride - during specific times - of which there are a lot. They are <br/>
required to go to the stables at least one time per week in addition to their <br/>
lesson, to practice and to help with care of the club&#39;s horses.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of shows, too. Like one a month or more. My daughter has no <br/>
interest in competing, but the leader says that even those who don&#39;t compete <br/>
can come to the get-ready day - which is about 10 hours the day before a show <br/>
- washing and shaving horses and packing up tack, etc., and they can go to <br/>
the show as handlers - helping groom, etc., and cheer on their teammates. So <br/>
- shows are 3 days - really - of full involvement. And they cost usually <br/>
around $50 to compete - including transportation and feed for horses, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So - for the money (which is approximately the same as I pay right now for <br/>
private weekly lessons) she gets much more horse-time and more <br/>
horse-education and opportunities for showing and competing and demonstrating <br/>
and just handling horses. <br/>
<br/>
The big glitch - she doesn&#39;t really want to give up her current lessons and <br/>
there is no WAY we can pay for both private lessons and the 4-H program.<br/>
<br/>
So - this is a difficult decision for her. Any thought-provoking insight or <br/>
ideas or comments or whatever -- would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s active in other things - she&#39;s in Girl Scouts, she&#39;s on a soccer team <br/>
which she LOVES!!! She&#39;s on a Destination Imagination team - which she loves.<br/>
<br/>
I could influence her one way or the other, at this point, because she&#39;s so <br/>
torn. My considerations include my own convenience - the extra driving and <br/>
hanging around stables a lot (which doesn&#39;t interest me very much - although <br/>
I have learned to enjoy the horses more - to appreciate them as the amazing <br/>
creatures that they are).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259625422">&lt;&lt;We are right NOW in the midst of an ongoing and really difficult<br/>
discussion about joining or not joining a 4-H Horse Group.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Boy this does sound difficult because the two horse activities are<br/>
clearly very different experiences. I guess the first thing is to<br/>
ascertain what it is your daughter likes about, or hopes to gain from<br/>
the 4H. It seems like the issue is more than just time with the horses.<br/>
<br/>
I have two suggestions off the top of my head.<br/>
<br/>
1/ Could she do half the 4H events and half the riding lessons splitting<br/>
the money between the two. (This may betray my ignorance of 4H<br/>
structure).<br/>
<br/>
2/ Could your daughter volunteer, or even better call it apprentice,<br/>
part of the time at her serene riding stable to learn the animal<br/>
husbandry aspect from the people there. 4H are not the only groups who<br/>
go to horse shows. <br/>
<br/>
As for hanging around the stables, I&#39;m with you on that. Time to catch<br/>
up on your reading??<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571914994">Pam, would the stables where she takes lessons now let her work in<br/>
exchange?  Maybe that wouldn&#39;t fit your schedule either, but if she could<br/>
clean stables or groom horses in exchange for her lessons, or even to get<br/>
a reduced rate maybe that would help.  Maybe the teacher she has now<br/>
could involve her more in the work at the stables and that could be her<br/>
4-H.  Private 4-H.<br/>
<br/>
Could you talk to the 4-H leader and see if she could attend for a month<br/>
at some agreed upon lower fee to see if it&#39;s something she really wants<br/>
before giving up the other?    <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, that&#39;s all I can think of for now.  <br/>

<br/>
maybe it&#39;s just late at night here and I&#39;m exhausted already, but reading<br/>
that list of what 4-H does horse-wise made me tierd.  There&#39;s some serious<br/>
time commitment there.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I print out an extra calendar on the computer and put on my usual<br/>
stuff and then overlay theatre rehearsals and show times (my big<br/>
time-killer) to see if I have time in my life to handle the demands of a<br/>
particular show.  I&#39;m pretty visual, so I need it there on paper.  Sometimes<br/>
it&#39;s a real eyeopener to see what happens to your time to add something.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth.<br/>
