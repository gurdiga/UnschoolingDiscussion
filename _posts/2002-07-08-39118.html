<div id="ygrps-yiv-848228105">Dear Ned (and Luz),<br/>
<br/>
You have temporarily brought me out of lurker status because I was SO moved<br/>
to tell you how much I enjoy reading your posts. I like the fact that you<br/>
are speaking from experience and have BTDT in regards to most of the<br/>
scenarios presented here. I love this advice and your sense of humor:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No, you don&#39;t correct spelling for your child, any more than we would<br/>
&gt; correct yours. Writing is what&#39;s important. If you correct her spelling,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; risk spoiling it for her, and turning yourself into a &quot;teacher&quot;...heaven<br/>
&gt; forbid. She&#39;ll learn spelling in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In general, your posts bring me peace of mind and a sense of well-being - a<br/>
wonderful feeling!<br/>
I especially like to share your POV with my dh - as another father.<br/>
Keep posting and commenting - I look forward to reading.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you and yours,<br/>
Karin<br/>

&gt; On TEACHING MYSELF:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we say, &quot;He&#39;s teaching,&quot; we imply that the person already knows<br/>
&gt; something. When we say, &quot;He&#39;s teaching himself,&quot; we describe a situation<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; which the person already knows something, but is also learning it (again?)<br/>
&gt; from himself. We create a conundrum -- a riddle inside an enigma. &quot;Is he<br/>
&gt; learning from himself?&quot; and &quot;Will he give himself a test?&quot;  etc., etc...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; John Holt, in his usual desdain for school teaching, wrote something like,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Just because someone is &quot;teaching&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anyone else is learning.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Could that apply to teaching one&#39;s self?  What fun !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For Josie:<br/>
&gt; Yours is a common problem. You are seeing the results of being in public<br/>
&gt; school...it takes time to overcome the damage done. From your post, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; hard to tell how long you&#39;ve been with this list, but if you stick around,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure you will find reasons to continue to trust your kids to be<br/>
&gt; learning. The key just might be to increase their freedom instead of<br/>
&gt; thinking of ways to regiment them into familiar (but dumb) ways of<br/>
&gt; &quot;learning&quot; such as doing schoolwork.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one of them wants a curriculum, make him/her BEG for it. Luz adds, &quot;and<br/>
&gt; make &#39;em pay for it, too.&quot; (long ago, I sent for one for a ten year old.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the second day, the kid looked up and said, &quot;Dad, this is stupid.&quot; I<br/>
&gt; replied, &quot;Right. Let&#39;s send it back.&quot; We did. He went out to play --<br/>
&gt; permanently. Today, he&#39;s a thirty-two year old who makes sound tracks for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>TV<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; commercials.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You need new ideas. With the money and time you are considering spending<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a curriculum, why not buy magazine subscriptions or go to museums or<br/>
&gt; factories or the newspaper office (talk to reporters and editors) or city<br/>
&gt; hall (see how it works/doesn&#39;t) or all learn to sail or ride horses (like<br/>
&gt; royalty all do -- it&#39;s great survival training). If all else fails, browse<br/>
&gt; the yellow pages to see what people in the real world are doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As the cartoon character Pogo once said, &quot;We are confronted with<br/>
&gt; insurmountable opportunity.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To Melissa:<br/>
&gt; You end with this: &gt;&gt; I cannot imagine bringing myself to<br/>
&gt; take him there ever again.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s your bottom line...your conclusion.  It&#39;s risky for anyone to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>advise<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you about raising your child, but that usually doesn&#39;t stop me...<br/>
&gt; You are the one who&#39;s in charge since your dh is at MIT learning, of all<br/>
&gt; things, that there is a science to politics. Well, there is a science to<br/>
&gt; being a mother, too, and it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with sending the<br/>
&gt; kids to schools for babysitting and being told to sit down and be quiet<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cut this and paste that. I also don&#39;t believe that the goal in life is to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a  &quot;well informed voter&quot; especially when most schools prepare children<br/>
&gt; mostly for Socialism, not independence. It gets me crazy just thinking<br/>
 </span></blockquote>about<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it when your child needs to be climbing trees and playing with one or two<br/>
&gt; friends.  Keep in touch.<br/>
&gt; Luz and I have a website/page for more...<br/>
&gt; www.borntoexplore.org/unschool<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To Joyce:<br/>
&gt; Great stuff!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To Liza:<br/>
&gt; Thanks, and about READING SIGNS, when my youngest son was very small and I<br/>
&gt; carried him around town on my shoulders, talking to him, he learned to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>read<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the signs -- all kinds -- from my reading them and, of course, saying them<br/>
&gt; to him. The first I remember was STOP  and GO on the light signals at<br/>
&gt; crossings. Then BANK and MARKET and, and...  We went into stores and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>talked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to many people. I know it was why he became so verbal at a young age. He<br/>
 </span></blockquote>now<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; speaks four languages and is off in Europe (as a graduation from college<br/>
&gt; present) practicing them every day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To all:<br/>
&gt; One more crack: Stay away from anything that calls itself &quot;progressive.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
