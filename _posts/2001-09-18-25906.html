&gt; With reading, is it something for them to just pick up entirely on their own,<br/>
&gt; or should I point stuff out? I mean we read a lot of books, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really try to focus on him getting the words or reading or anything. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; sort of been of the opinion that when he wants to or is ready, he&#39;ll start on<br/>
&gt; his own. It just hit me tonight that maybe I should be pointing out words<br/>
&gt; more or &#39;trying&#39; to get him to notice small words. I think I may have just<br/>
&gt; answered my own question :-), but I could still use a bit of feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I noticed there was a little spark of interest with Brit (who hasn&#39;t really<br/>
made any major &quot;ah ha!&quot; decode on reading yet, she&#39;s 6) -- when reading to<br/>
her, she pointed out at some point which words were &quot;the end&quot; in a couple of<br/>
favorite stories, so I flipped back through the book and we took turns<br/>
identifying the other &quot;the&quot; words in it, too. I think this game lasted, oh,<br/>
I think probably four or five the&#39;s and then she was off talking about the<br/>
color of the rabbit&#39;s fur or some other thing.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a lot more likely to play more kinds of obvious &quot;learning<br/>
games&quot; with the girls, but somehow when he does them they really ARE games<br/>
and everyone involved is having a good time and he doesn&#39;t sound like<br/>
Central Casting&#39;s version of &quot;Now class. Class. Shut up!&quot; &lt;g&gt; -- both our<br/>
daughters are fascinated (still, after years) with the 30&#39; tape measure he<br/>
uses and learned to count largely from reading the numbers on the tape with<br/>
him as he went about projects.<br/>
<br/>
But I think in many cases it&#39;s just dropping bits of information that they<br/>
might find useful and can take or leave. While reading, I don&#39;t feel like a<br/>
fake if I point out that &quot;Bat&quot; starts with a &quot;B&quot; just like &quot;Brittany&quot; does,<br/>
any more than I find it fake to point out that the house in the book has two<br/>
stories like ours, or a fireplace like ours does not. And of course the<br/>
girls are right there telling me what they find interesting about the book,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago Mikey (4 in a few weeks) was drawing and brought me a<br/>
picture. She&#39;d written, for the first time ever, a few letters of the<br/>
alphabet. Three times each in &quot;words&quot; read YIM -- knowing my little<br/>
left-hander as I do &lt;g&gt; I readily decoded this to spell &quot;Mikey&quot; (backwards<br/>
and missing a few letters &lt;g&gt;) and she was delighted that I was bright<br/>
enough to get it. ;) I can only imagine the blow to my image if I&#39;d made the<br/>
mistake of trying to correct it, however gently, to my way of spelling Mikey<br/>
at that point.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I think there&#39;s a lot less danger and damage if when-in-doubt I<br/>
hush up and see what the kids have to say about it all first. If I try an<br/>
experiment and I feel goofy or they seem bored or overwhelmed, retreat is<br/>
IMHO the best strategy.<br/>

We played games with words and letters.  He&#39;ll probably start noticing words <br/>
with the same letters as are in his name, but it might not be on books.  Mine <br/>
noticed stuff on cardboard shipping boxes, billboards--places where there <br/>
were just a few big words.  Large masses of words (even in kids&#39; story books) <br/>
they tended to glaze over.  <br/>
<br/>
Mine liked multiple choice kinds of games, like picking their names out of <br/>
words that looked like their names.  When they started asking questions about <br/>
how people read I would write down lists of easy words like at, hat, bat, <br/>
cat, mat and they&#39;d look for the ones that started like words they already <br/>
knew.  Of that list, &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;mat&quot; would have been Holly&#39;s first picks <br/>
because of &quot;Holly&quot; and &quot;Marty.&quot;  Those games never lasted much longer than <br/>
the few seconds or minutes it took them to find the ones they knew.  Then <br/>
either they&#39;d ask another reading question or they&#39;d take off to do something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked me once before she was reading whether when I looked at a word I <br/>
read it all at once or sounded it out.  We were driving.  I read some signs <br/>
and business names to her and told her some, like &quot;restaurant,&quot; I just saw as <br/>
one big thing.  But others, like people&#39;s last names that weren&#39;t really <br/>
familiar, I sounded out.  To her, that was total news and really useful.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had fun with sticky notes and labelling things, mixing them up and <br/>
having the kids restore them to the right objects.  Floor, chair, TV, bowl, <br/>
lamp...  Another quick game without pressure to do it &quot;right,&quot; and done <br/>
because kids wanted to play a game, not &quot;to teach reading.&quot;<br/>

follow along.  Then I&#39;d look at him and he was very obviously looking away <br/>
from the book until I stopped.  &lt;g&gt;  He read at age 12, and then only <br/>
because I slipped away from my unschooling ideals and made him.  (He still <br/>
doesn&#39;t read very well at 13, likely *because* of the pressure I put on him <br/>
earlier.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237599766">My soon to be 5yo just started getting interested in letters and <br/>
numbers, and I think he&#39;s coming to realize their meaning.  He is <br/>
just starting to recognize the letter J(his name is Jack) and though <br/>
he has been able to spell his name(outloud) for a while, I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure it was meaningless to him.  I got him a wipe off book with the <br/>
letters of the alphabet in them to practice and some dry erase <br/>
markers.  I got my 7yo a cursive one and my 11 yo a multiplication <br/>
one.  I figured they might like the dry erase part of it, and I was <br/>
right.  <br/>
There are pictures in this book, with the words right next to them.  <br/>
Jack covered up the pictures with his hands and said, &quot;mom, what do <br/>
these letters say.?&quot;  I read &quot;owl&quot; and &quot;lamp&quot;.  He uncovered the <br/>
pictures in amazment and said &quot;how did you know that?!&quot; <br/>
I think we both had big moments of realization at that point.<br/>

an <br/>
 earlier thread. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am sitting here just smiling.  I am not at all surprised that you have a 3 <br/>
yr old<br/>
not showing interest in reading yet.  He is probably still just trying to <br/>
figure<br/>
out the language &lt;g&gt;.  Take it easy, he&#39;s just a baby : )  The unschooling.com<br/>
website has some awesome threads on reading, one I believe under Sandra&#39;s<br/>
folder.  I went there when my dd was 7 and it calmed me down thankly <br/>
before I started forcing her to do phonics.  I am so glad I didn&#39;t do that. <br/>
Just<br/>
the other day she made up a list of American Girl things she wants, copied<br/>
from the catalog.  The next day she is looking at her list (which she really<br/>
can&#39;t read, but recognizes some of the letters and sounds they make) and<br/>
tells me she thinks she can write a poem from this list.  She asked for my<br/>
help and I helped her string together a few sentences. She was delighted<br/>
and memorized it and read it over and over again.  I am so glad I didn&#39;t force<br/>
her to learn to read and that she can happily pick up a pen and paper and<br/>
say, I think I&#39;ll write a poem today!  What a joyful way to discover the power<br/>
of reading and writing.  <br/>
