<div id="ygrps-yiv-578003610">I&#39;m past the point of  PMS in my life, but I&#39;m up for living to one hundred<br/>
years old!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CORAL CALCIUM!<br/>
<br/>
Wow!<br/>
<br/>
Well, we all know now about osteoporosis and bone<br/>
support, blood vessels and circulation, teeth and<br/>
how important good quality calcium is for dealing<br/>
with the above and more.<br/>
<br/>
But I did not know that research says it might help<br/>
with such things as colon cancer and prolong your<br/>
life in general! That just BLEW ME AWAY!<br/>
<br/>
This whole Coral Calcium thing is IMPORTANT for<br/>
every single woman on the planet. But, of course,<br/>
you already know that without me, right? :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, please, read the following article and share<br/>
it with everyone you care about or who you know has<br/>
any of the mentioned conditions and could profit<br/>
from the below information.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! And let me know what you think, please.<br/>
<br/>
With Love,<br/>
Barda<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: For those of you who are interested in getting<br/>
some Coral Calcium of truly superior quality and at<br/>
an incredibly low price (that was discovered during<br/>
long and detailed search by your obedient servant :-),<br/>
there is a link and a code for you at the end of this<br/>
e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Enjoy! And stay HEALTHY and HAPPY!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays and Holydays! :-)<br/>

====================================<br/>
<br/>
-- The Okinawan Centenarian Study<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to the Okinawa study, followed by<br/>
a brief summary and some additional stuff I&#39;ve run<br/>
across about calcium:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.okinawaprogram.com/&#39;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
According to The Okinawan Centenarian Study,<br/>
every city, town, and village In Okinawa has a<br/>
family register system (koseki) that has been<br/>
recording reliable birth, marriage, and death<br/>
statistics since 1879. Life tables calculated from<br/>
this database show one of the world&#39;s highest<br/>
concentrations of centenarians and likely the<br/>
world&#39;s longest life expectancy for any country or<br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
After examining over six hundred Okinawan<br/>
centenarians and numerous &#39;youngsters&#39; in their<br/>
seventies, eighties, and nineties, the researchers<br/>
saw certain patterns begin to emerge. It became<br/>
clear that the Okinawan lifestyle was providing<br/>
some real, scientifically verifiable reasons these<br/>
people were so incredibly healthy so far into their<br/>
senior years. And they were reasons that could<br/>
have a profound impact on our health and well-<br/>
being here in the West.<br/>
<br/>
_________________<br/>
<br/>
Among the reasons for their longevity of life and<br/>
overall health cited by the study was &#39;the high<br/>
calcium intake by Okinawans in both food and<br/>
their natural drinking water.&#39; The coral calcium in<br/>
their water has played a key role.<br/>
_________________<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is right in line with numerous studies that are<br/>
beginning to point to the significant benefits of<br/>
calcium. In the October 13, 1998 issue of the New<br/>
York Times wrote an article appeared entitled<br/>
&#39;Calcium Takes Its Place As a Superstar of<br/>
Nutrients&#39; in which it reports that a study<br/>
published in the Journal of the American Medical<br/>
Association reported that &#39;increasing calcium<br/>
induced normal development of the epithelia cells<br/>
and might also prevent cancer in such organs as the<br/>
breast, prostate and pancreas&#39;. It also reported that<br/>
the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published<br/>
&#39;virtually no major organ system escapes calcium&#39;s<br/>
influence&#39; and that a research team from the<br/>
University of Southern California found &#39;adding<br/>
calcium to the diet lowered the blood pressure in<br/>
110 black teenagers.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The January 14, 1999 issue of the Phoenix Republic<br/>
wrote an article about cancer entitled &#39;Calcium<br/>
Reduces Tumors&#39; that the New England Journal of<br/>
Medicine reported &#39;adding calcium to the diet can<br/>
keep you from getting tumors in your large<br/>
intestine&#39;. Then the February, 1999 issue of the<br/>
Readers Digest wrote in an article entitled &#39;The<br/>
&#39;Superstar Nutrient&#39; that the Journal of the<br/>
American Medical published &#39;when the participants<br/>
consumption reached 1500 milligrams of calcium a<br/>
day, cell growth in the colon improved toward<br/>
normal (this means that the cancer was reversed)&#39;.<br/>
The Digest also reported that the Metabolic Bone<br/>
Center at St. Lukes Hospital believes that &#39;a chronic<br/>
deficiency of calcium is largely responsible for<br/>
premenstrual syndrome (PMS)&#39; and that &#39;a lot of<br/>
women are avoiding the sun and their vitamin-D<br/>
levels may be very low.&#39;<br/>

Did humanity originate in an area that had abundant coral calcium?<br/>
<br/>
But the people who live in areas where milk can be stored developed a<br/>
tolerance to lactose. That can&#39;t have taken more than a few thousand years.<br/>
Why would humans who haven&#39;t lived near the sea for 10&#39;s of thousands of<br/>
years still be dependent on coral calcium?<br/>
