<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331976539"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I read this post and did not interpret to say all<br/>
&gt;Christians. I have seen tis series marketed towards<br/>
&gt;fundamental christians for the purpose of <br/>
&gt;character education. If they are read as a model<br/>
&gt;without thinking things through, it could cause some<br/>
&gt;gross prejudices and i think that was the point of<br/>
&gt;the essay<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think your right Johanna, but did not want to speak<br/>
for Christians.  Thanks for adding your opinion as a<br/>
Christian homeschooler.<br/>
