<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191610412">Hello All!  I just spent the last hour or so reading all the post from the <br/>
last 12 hours!  EGADS!  Lot&#39;s to reply to!<br/>
<br/>
First of all, thank you Lois and others who are having a tremendous impact on <br/>
helping me relax and get my head together.  YES, you are helping, things are <br/>
already smoothing out a great deal here! THANK YOU THANK YOU!<br/>
	On to the replies about the boys and their time usage.  There is no <br/>
problem seeing the learing going on incessantly with the 11 year old.  he is <br/>
always busy doing something very creative and of interest to himself.  His <br/>
aspirations are to be an astronaut!  And is content to follow whatever course <br/>
needed to get him there.  he is an entrepenuer of sorts, makes beady things <br/>
and sells them.  Big StarWars nut he is, spends a good amount of time <br/>
creating new characters (drawing them) and developing new story lines.  <br/>
Builds all kinds of space stuff out of household junk.  He has designed a <br/>
couple of spacecrafts for a mission to Mars.  here is where I would love to <br/>
find him a mentor, because he is way past me with the space stuff already!  <br/>
My 9 year old is a different story... he loves to play baseball and other <br/>
games with another person or in a group.  Yes, he is my social one!  He loves <br/>
Nintendo, though he understands that there a limit to that.  he loves to play <br/>
chess.  he is picking up art projects more and more.  he is just a tough one <br/>
to figure out sometimes.  he has always been led by others, now he has to <br/>
determine his own direction and sometimes struggles with it.  he would be <br/>
content to do whatever I tell him....sheeesh.<br/>
	Yes, my freind, I chose the books on the shelf (most of them).  And I <br/>
seem to remember them asking me why I was buying them when we were at the <br/>
store.  DUH!!!!   Did I not get it.  They are all the modern and traditional <br/>
classics in literature.  And I do beleive they will someday have an interest. <br/>
 My 9 yo ds is reading Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher right now.<br/>
	About video games... unless the boys make a move to do some expansion <br/>
activities, I end the Nintendo fest.  For me, there is a lot of other <br/>
creative things they can be doing.  I did let them go for over a month with <br/>
playing Zelda everday, and I will tell you why.   They learned to sew by <br/>
sewing Link costumes, they learned to use power tools by building swords and <br/>
shields out of wood.  They used there imaginations to find things around the <br/>
house and in thrift stores that would serve as the pieces parts in the games <br/>
(rupies, coins, fairies, etc.).  They developed a monetary system from things <br/>
found in nature (gravel, ash, buckeyes, etc.).  They drew a map of the <br/>
kingdoms and them went outside to set up the kingdoms in the yard and the <br/>
woods.  11 yr o Ds picked up the recorder (flutaphone) and translated all the <br/>
music in the game for the recorder in written notes.  And of course they role <br/>
played until they were exhausted!  this my idea of a good video game.  If <br/>
they don&#39;t expand on it, we move on.  It is amazing how it did turn all of <br/>
there attention away fom playing the game and  onto living!<br/>
Now to the families putting in their views and quizzes.  My family would <br/>
never do that because they know they would catch all kinds of crap from me, <br/>
possibly in the form of not seeing thier dear grandchildren again.  I am just <br/>
too unpredicatble to mess with.  MIL does not quiz, she just asks how school <br/>
is going, and the kids say fine.  She butts out of our business, always has.  <br/>
My mom, bless her heart, just said OK, if that is what you want to do... she <br/>
does support it now becuase of how well the boys act towards her now and <br/>
because she and I have had the opportunity to become a lot closer because of <br/>
homeschooling.  She even helps me when I get tripped up with math concepts <br/>
and how to teach them.  This is the most interest I have ever seen her take <br/>
in something I am doing.  She and I will sit there and and work on the latest <br/>
math manipulative, math problems, chess game or whatever.  When I get <br/>
something new, I go straight to my mom&#39;s and we try it out!   its either that <br/>
or she will never see us.  We have made a strong effort to include her in on <br/>
our stuff and I think she is really enjoying all this.  we never used to have <br/>
such interesting conversations before.  Bottom line, i think she sees how <br/>
this has changed me and made me a better person, how could she not support <br/>
that?  <br/>
	DH told me last night that his brothers had a few things to say about <br/>
what we are doing when he visited them the night before.  they don&#39;t support <br/>
what we are doing and worry about socialization.  Dh and I both bursted out <br/>
laughing when he told me this.  We have kids over every weekend, all weekend, <br/>
and get together with other hs&#39;ers often.  How silly.  I was kind of miffed <br/>
that they said this to my husband, but Dh reassured me by saying that he <br/>
considered the source, both bil&#39;s still live at home with mommy (both in the <br/>
30&#39;s range), neither has ever been able to have a succesful fullfilling <br/>
relationship (women are meat to be taken advantage of) nor do they appear to <br/>
know what that is.  Both put their own value on how much money they can make. <br/>
 Both have been heavy partyers for long past the typical juvenile period of <br/>
silliness.  Neither one had done well in school.  there appears to be no real <br/>
substance to them.  But they know better than to ever say anything to me <br/>
about what we are doing, again, I am too unpredictable.  I have a wonderful <br/>
example of this, please bear with me...<br/>
	One Thanksgiving we were all sitting at the dinner table and bil #2 <br/>
starts talking about a &quot;fat chick&quot; at bar that was hitting on bil #1 and they <br/>
begin to laugh and carry on.  some background here, i am overweight by about <br/>
60 pounds... I just lost 23 pounds this year.  Anyway, I put down my utensils <br/>
and begin to giggle.  And they all looked at me in that &quot;uh, oh, she going to <br/>
do something way&quot;.  And I turned to bil #2 and say, &quot; I don&#39;t think that just <br/>
because someone is overweight they have no value and intelligence and should <br/>
be considered less than human and not worthy of being socialized with.&quot; (all <br/>
the while both bil&#39;s are sitting there with their Barbie look alike <br/>
girlfriends who shouldn&#39;t be at holiday gathering unless they are engaged and <br/>
committed, just my opinion) He began to stutter and sputter, then I chimed in <br/>
again &quot; Boy, you must think I am a fat pig!!!&quot;  And I picked up my fork and <br/>
began to eat again, you know, as fat people should not be doing.  They all <br/>
hung their heads and that was about it for the conversation that <br/>
Thanksgiving.  Hahahahahaha, you just never know what I will do, it is best <br/>
to watch what you say and keep your mouth shut if you are in my family, lol.  <br/>
I love it!  You know, they used to talk to me more when I was thin, egads!<br/>
	Hey we are coming through Pittsburg on July 2 and again on the 5th.  <br/>
we could stop in too!!!!!!!!  We are going to Gettysburg for the Civil War <br/>
re-enactments over the July 4th holiday!  we will be camping with another HS <br/>
family from Cleveland.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, that is enough for now,hahahaha. Sorry for the long post!  But it is <br/>
small if you consider I am replying to 75 e-mails, lol.  So great ot hear <br/>
from all of you and your experiences.  this is truly a God send, this little <br/>
community.  When you need, he provides.<br/>
