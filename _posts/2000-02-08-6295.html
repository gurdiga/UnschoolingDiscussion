&lt;&lt;OK, where did you see it?  I would like to get it too!  I want to learn to<br/>
<br/>
quilt and that sounds like an unintimidating way to start.  Like I don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
have enough on my plate already that I am barely keeping up with, but HEY!<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t help myself.<br/>

I realize you are just thinking about starting out quilting, but wouldn&#39;t it <br/>
be cool to have your prospective adoptive kid(s) make quilt patterns with <br/>
pattern blocks or squares and triangles of construction paper, and then once <br/>
a satisfying design was found, you could make real blankies -- doll sized or <br/>
child sized.  (Not trying to stick  you with an enormous sewing project, but <br/>
it just appeals to me.)<br/>
<br/>
I would de-emphasize the math in the beginning, focusing just on the art, but <br/>
the whole thing is mathematical, even if you are doing all the measuring and <br/>
calculating.<br/>
