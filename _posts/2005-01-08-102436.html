I just recently learned about lucid dreaming.  Brenna did a workshop  at Not <br/>
Back to School Camp on Dreams this past October. <br/>
I wonder if Zack went to this one. I&#39;ll ask him when he gets home he went to <br/>
a NBTSC party in Silver Spring, MD today.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530732001">I love dreams!  I am not sure what you mean by Lucid dreaming - I thought<br/>
that was when you were half awake and half asleep and the dreams are so<br/>
easily controlled and real?  That happens to me often and sometimes it is<br/>
terrifying.  Being conscious while your body is asleep that horrified me as<br/>
a kid.  As I got older I learned to wait it out, that&#39;s when you can &quot;fly&quot;<br/>
around in your dream.  That sounds really crazy doesn&#39;t it!<br/>
<br/>
I was just talking to someone about keeping a &quot;dream journal.&quot;  It is<br/>
amazing how going back and reading a dream from years ago will bring to mind<br/>
so many recent dreams that must be somehow connected.  I love to tell people<br/>
when I have dreams about them, just in case they need to hear it.  <br/>
<br/>
Sitting here right now I can&#39;t remember what I dreamed last night, but all<br/>
day long things will remind me.  I love it when something sparks my memory.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is what lucid dreaming is, when you are aware you are dreaming and <br/>
you can then control your dreams, change the monster into a friend, have <br/>
friends join you in your dark scary cave, etc.  But to me it&#39;s not <br/>
terrifying, it&#39;s comforting.  I can change my nightmares into good dreams. <br/>

remember a dream I had when I was 3--I was trapped on<br/>
Giligan&#39;s Island with a bunch of other kids.  Everyone<br/>
was worried that we would never get off the island. <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t worry!  This is just a dream!  We can get off!&quot;<br/>
I told them.  Then I showed them all how to lay down<br/>
rocks and hop from one to another all the way back to<br/>
Hawaii ;)  Ah, the mind of a three year old!<br/>
