<div id="ygrps-yiv-53254980">Hi to all. Yes Marsha, there are some of us out here. I am a single<br/>
parent who works full time. I am trying hard to unschool my dd(10) and<br/>
ds(12). I am from the old school and find it difficult to not follow the<br/>
text book, spelling list, &quot;rote route&quot;, etc. However, I am lucky enough<br/>
to be involved in a successful family business. My kids even help work,<br/>
earning and learning....I did it and I don&#39;t think it hurt me too much!<br/>
Is it easy? No. Is it a sacrifice? Yes. Would I trade my lifestyle for<br/>
another? No Way!!    My 17yo attends both ps/community college under<br/>
dual enrollment. Yes, she tells me how much she hates me &lt;BG&gt; for<br/>
putting her thru 13 years of public school. But I didn&#39;t know. 12yo is<br/>
in first year of hs and seems to be adapting well. 10yo is the reason<br/>
for my homeschooling adventure. She is very bright, labelled as gifted<br/>
but learning disabled, by ps. After tears, fears, and 4 years I pulled<br/>
her out of ps. WOW, what a difference! I let her pick her &quot;project&quot; and<br/>
she goes to it!    We have grown closer as a family. We have<br/>
grandparents, great-grandparents, uncles/aunts, etc. who see the<br/>
difference in the hs vs. ps kids. No comments...just awe!    Well,<br/>
enough rambling! I don&#39;t know if I answered any of your questions...but<br/>
I feel better!! (ps: you probably would hear more from single<br/>
parents/working moms if we weren&#39;t fighting for the puter! They&#39;re given<br/>
me the &quot;hurry up&quot; signal..gotta go...mind expansion is waiting on<br/>
me....)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another standing ovation for Aleasa, and anyone else I may have missed who<br/>
is working full time and homeschooling.  I am in awe, especially of you<br/>
singles!  Wow!  I suppose we do what we have to, and I am always surprised<br/>
what I can do when I HAVE to.  I support your committment to parenting 200%<br/>
<br/>
Hell!  I&#39;ll just give a round of applause to all of us!  We deserve it!!<br/>

  Hi Aleasa: <br/>
   Hello from one single homeschooling home to another... The family business <br/>
does sound ideal, I often I wish that I could find some type of home business <br/>
to do.....<br/>
