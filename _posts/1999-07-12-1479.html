<div id="ygrps-yiv-636620560">Hi There Lori, <br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list  as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that hsing has a learning curve...for the parents as well as<br/>
the children  , that is. There seems to have been an evolution of sorts<br/>
that happened to us as we learned along. We are starting our 6th year. <br/>
For instance, when we first started I used to put up the Canadian flag (and<br/>
sing our anthem) and have desks and have workbooks and have scheduled hours<br/>
and so on. But we have GROWN!!! And we realize now that we needn&#39;t<br/>
replicate our schooling history from our own childhoods.  And I find that<br/>
as the girls get older they are very integrated into the choice of the<br/>
learning materials. They have good self-esteem and they know that they can<br/>
choose the path. And they do... with great determination. I now only<br/>
consider myself a facilitator. They choose the path...I help with the<br/>
&#39;building materials&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
I still have days where I worry if I am doing enough but generally our<br/>
lives seem so much smoother now that we are moving away from curriculum and<br/>
etc. <br/>
Our provincial gov. supports homeschooling. In British COlumbia we advise<br/>
the gov. that we are hsing (called registering with the Ministry of<br/>
Education) and then we are absolutely free to do whatever we like. They are<br/>
never any tests done, never any home visits, never any reports to<br/>
file...absolutely no follow-up or Big Brother attitude.   And we hope to<br/>
maintain these freedoms. They are perfect for unschooling!!<br/>
<br/>
You are correct that unschooling is about relaxing. I think it comes with<br/>
the confidence that we are raising happy, inquisitive, spirited children. <br/>
