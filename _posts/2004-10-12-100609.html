<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302991348">I need to forewarn anyone who has a book to sell at HSC. The books <br/>
that didn&#39;t sell were returned to me in a horrible condition. <br/>
Barbara claims that she packed them herself, but she used no packing <br/>
material and put them in a box that was much too large. All 24 books <br/>
are in such bad condition that I can&#39;t sell them now. When I left <br/>
the conference, they were neatly packaged in the box I sent them in <br/>
and they were brand spanking new. <br/>
<br/>
Some have food on them, bent corners, water drops, marks, scratches <br/>
and scuffs as if they were used as hockey pucks. This damage had to <br/>
have happened before they were shipped. I&#39;m not exaggerating here. <br/>
The box arrived and was smashed in on all edges due to no packaging <br/>
material. The books were haphazardly tossed into the box. Barbara&#39;s <br/>
bad packaging and bad handling before packaging cost me $365 and she <br/>
says HSC isn&#39;t responsible. No, I think Barbara should be <br/>
responsible, but she won&#39;t even respond to my email. She suggested <br/>
that I file a claim with UPS, but they did nothing but deliver a <br/>
poorly packaged box of damaged books.<br/>
<br/>
My contract also states that they will have a check to me by <br/>
September 30th at the latest for books sold and my personal eating <br/>
expenses. It&#39;s October 23rd and I have no check yet. <br/>
<br/>
Meeting Pam and a few others was great for me, but I will never have <br/>
anything to do with HSC again unless Barbara leaves as coordinator. <br/>
<br/>
Pam, do you happen to have email addresses for the other speakers <br/>
who were selling books? I&#39;m going to look each one up from the <br/>
website, but just thought I&#39;d ask in case you already have them. I&#39;d <br/>
like to know if any of the others had similar experiences.<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie<br/>
