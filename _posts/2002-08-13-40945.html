I realize that you meant your original remark as a joke, but it&#39;s a kind <br/>
of a pet peeve.  Everyone assumes that you will send your child to school! <br/>
 Even though people have called her a pre-schooler and I have not verbally <br/>
objected every time, it still bugs me.  However, as I said earlier, she <br/>
has taken to correcting people for me (&quot;I&#39;m going to homeschool!&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
As for what I do different, it is mostly a case what I do NOT do.  I don&#39;t <br/>
assume that she needs my intervention to figure out how to do things, so I <br/>
try to stay out of her way and let her work though things on her own. <br/>
Also, I try not to make patronizing comments (&quot;You&#39;re so smart to be able <br/>
to do X&quot;).  I want her to think that it is natural to be able to do <br/>
whatever it is she can do.  Also, I used to answer her questions with <br/>
questions (&quot;What do you think it spells?&quot;). After thinking about it, I <br/>
realized how much it annoys me when people answer my questions like that, <br/>
so I&#39;ve just started to answer her questions, regardless of how basic they <br/>
are, and how much I think she may already know the answer.  Altogether, I <br/>
would say that it is a case of respecting her intelligence and not <br/>
treating her as a &quot;child&quot; (where &quot;child&quot; is used a pejorative), but rather <br/>
as an human who doesn&#39;t happen to have the experience that I have, but is <br/>
fully capable of understanding/reasoning on her own.<br/>
