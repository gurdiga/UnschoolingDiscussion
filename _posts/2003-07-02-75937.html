Ok, here&#39;s my creative idea question for the week:<br/>
<br/>
You know those ant farms that you can buy from catalogs?  I&#39;m too cheap to<br/>
buy one and figure I can&#39;t take it back to the U.S. when we return from our<br/>
current tour of Germany (dh is army).  So can you make your own ant farm?<br/>
<br/>
Do you have to have a queen to do this, or will just a bunch of worker ants<br/>
collected off the groud do?  And what sort of container would I use?  Food?<br/>
Right now my son is collecting ants in a plastic ziplock tub, which was<br/>
cheap enough that I didnt&#39; mind punching holes in the top.  But it&#39;s pretty<br/>
small in my mind! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to ideas!<br/>

I put &lt;ant farm make own -alien&gt; into Google and here are some ideas I found.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a website that tells how to make your own ant farm: &lt;A <br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s a cool site with a bazillion recipes and crafts, including an ant<br/>
farm:<br/>

&lt;&lt;Anybody have any ant farm tips or suggestions?  Experiences?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We only had an ant farm once. We didn&#39;t have much luck with them. They lived<br/>
for awhile but didn&#39;t really build like the pitcures showed. They were<br/>
rather boring to us. Then they all just started dying. Maybe one was a<br/>
murderer, not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we just got our owl pellets, triops packet and sea monkeys. Those<br/>
we have good luck with. Which reminds I have to go and get spring water.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let me know how the ants do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133012480">I guess we got lucky.  I think mine may have been in our P.O. box for a few days before we even got them.  Though they seemed like they were dying after having been in the fridge for ten min. (booklet advised this to keep them from moving too quickly when you put them in the farm) they all revived.  All fifteen or so are alive and tunneling and it soo neat.  Ihope it goes as well for you.  <br/>
