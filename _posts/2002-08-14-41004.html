 Oh I know what you mean by reading first.  I&#39;m trying to instill <br/>
that in my kids.  I never find the movie better--books are always so <br/>
much more visual to me.  <br/>
I&#39;m surprised any laundry gets done or food gets cooked and kids- <br/>
well there on their own when I get my nose in a good book.<br/>

The only movie to me that has been better than the book was Wizard of <br/>

<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
But about movies, I think it&#39;s great when a director DID really carefully <br/>
visualize what the author really wrote!!<br/>
<br/>
Some movies which did follow descriptions close enough for me to feel they <br/>
had really read the book:<br/>
Princess Bride<br/>
The Fellowship of the Ring<br/>
The Little Princess (based on Sarah Crewe, the old one)<br/>
<br/>
Vague pictures are good enough for me, but sometimes I do re-read <br/>
descriptions like Tolkein describing the trip down the river in The Two <br/>
Towers, or descriptions which involve building up to why someone is afraid or <br/>
sad.  Those are important.  <br/>
<br/>
I was just getting into reading slowly enough to savor descriptions when the <br/>
Evelyn Wood Speed Reading advertisements were everywhere in the late 1960&#39;s.  <br/>
Before that I was reading for plot and character.  I went back and re-read a <br/>
bunch of 19th century novels to look at the writing itself, and while I was <br/>
doing that &quot;You can read this book in TWO MINUTES&quot; advertisements were all <br/>
around.   <br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I can scan a dictionary for some information, and I can zip through an <br/>
article looking for figures, but I can&#39;t read the desciption of the coffin <br/>
maker&#39;s house in Oliver Twist in two seconds and know more than &quot;he lived <br/>
with a coffin maker.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So although I don&#39;t turn the words into pictures, I still let the <br/>
descriptions create the emotional background for my only-vaguely-physical <br/>
characters.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069080047">Yes.  My husband hates going to the movies with me when I&#39;ve already read the<br/>
book.  Especially if he really likes the movie and I hate it.  The movie A<br/>
Time to Kill came closest to my imagination.  Though I&#39;ve like some other<br/>
movie adaptions even if they weren&#39;t what I imagined.<br/>
<br/>
Now does anybody do this?  I have a tendency to change descriptions in the<br/>
book to suit my own taste or vision.  I&#39;ve changed characters&#39; race, style of<br/>
dress, etc.  For example I always change full hoop skirts into long skirts<br/>
with bustles or simply no hoop at all.  I can&#39;t bear to picture character&#39;s<br/>
wearing purple and yellow or some other color combinations I find<br/>
unattractive.  <br/>
