<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654435812">-=-Maybe Bill Gothard?  Gotthard?  ATI?  Advanced training institute?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  That was the thing.  Weird, weird cult-at-home program.  And so some Christian homeschoolers who got away from that and did their own Christian curriculum at home felt relatively free and wild, to choose their own music, maybe make some parental decisions, maybe even let a relative spend the night.<br/>
<br/>
I went to look online for the application, which I owned once years ago.  Didn&#39;t find one.  Found an expose/complaint article about him, written by Christians who don&#39;t think he&#39;s Christian enough (the complaints are varied and interesting), but this was fun in a Texans-are-crazy kind of way:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Gothard&#39;s &quot;Army&quot;<br/>
-=-Gothard operates what appears to be a paramilitary-like training school for teenagers on a 2,200-acre former college campus in Big Sandy, Texas, as part of his ALERT program (Air Land Emergency Resource Team) -- purportedly for domestic missions work via the providing of disaster relief and humanitarian aid (see second paragraph of Endnote #9). Gothard states that &quot;ALERT is an intensive program in which young men [male graduates of ATI] ages sixteen and older are trained in Biblical principles, Godly character, and practical skills. ALERT utilizes military disciplines to train young men to restore life, rather than take it, and to bring peace and encouragement to those in distress. The present program involves the following phases: (1) Discipline: in physical strength, endurance, and self-control; (2) Skills: in a wide range of vocational specialties; and (3) Emergency Services: in response to calls from cities, states, and nations.&quot; (Source: IBLP Internet web site, 8/97.) As of July, 2000, the program had 181 enrolled and 600 graduates.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since the hyper-spiritual warfare motifs of the Latter Rain movement are beginning to take a sinister shift towards actual military, Gothard&#39;s involvement in paramilitary-like things causes us to wonder if there is a connection. Don&#39;t forget that Joel&#39;s Army has a &quot;chosen seed&quot; (the coming generation) to carry out its purpose on earth, which is dominion (both physical and spiritual). In this context, Christians should have some grave concerns about Gothard&#39;s activities.<br/>
<br/>
A-=-long these lines, Gothard has clearly bought into the &quot;Christian America Myth&quot; (ATI Wisdom Booklet 53). . .. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The complainants are concerned the &quot;Character First&quot; movement endangers people by teaching them integrity without Jesus.  What if they learn to be good but don&#39;t fear God?  That is dangerous. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the first really in-my-face questions in the ancient online discussions days was from a Christian homeschooler honestly baffled at HOW on earth I could teach my children morals without Christianity.  Without the fear of hell, why would they be good?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227682115">I know this is off topic, but this morning I was thinking of &quot;connect the dots&quot; ideas, because I got an early copy of Dean Sluyter&#39;s new book Cinema Nirvana, about spirituality and the movies.   I really want to read it.<br/>
<br/>
But....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading at the Gothard site and it connected me a dot to Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  There, at the end:<br/>
<br/>
-=-It must be emphasized again that in Gothard&#39;s system, under no possible circumstances is a courtship to be entered into without the consent of the parents. In his seminar Gothard says, &quot;I&#39;m firmly convinced that God never intended girls to turn down dates. He intended for their father&#39;s [sic] to.&quot; This principle applies equally to marriage. In Gothard&#39;s booklet Establishing Biblical Standards of Courtship, there is a page for sons and daughters to cut out, which is a covenant they sign with their fathers to &quot;… demonstrate your commitment to God&#39;s plan for courtship instead of man&#39;s philosophy of dating. …&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
-=-The young person must say to his or her father, &quot;I will wait for your full release before entering into marriage.&quot; The father, in turn, tells his daughter that &quot;I will protect you from unqualified men.&quot; To his son the father says, &quot;I will protect you from strange women.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
And that connection is?....<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742741469">Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;know, for history buffs it has just about everything:  Costume, castles, philosophy, political science, religion, romance, family strife, class struggles, medieval medicine (or at least some plague)...   <br/>
<br/>
But more than that, it is FULL of quotable stuff, and this one is a gem of the connection between the mythology of Arthur and the fascinatingly weird government of England, with all its special chairs and rocks and swords and orbs and  fur collars and stuff:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Listen: Strange women lying in ponds<br/>
distributing swords is no basis for a system of government!-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857265297">Found some of the homeschooling stuff.<br/>
I think it was this group that said IF a woman worked outside the home, it couldn&#39;t be for a male boss.  She could only submit herself to her husband, and otherwise it was like adultry (or something like that, so only if she had a female boss could she work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-2 To enroll in Gothard&#39;s ATI home schooling program, parents and enrolling children are required to complete the Basic and Advanced IBLP Seminars (and pay the yearly $675 per family tuition fee). Families must agree to many guidelines in order to be accepted into the school and continue in it. At the yearly ATI conference, the dress code is nearly a uniform consisting of a white shirt and navy blue pants or skirt. They must follow a dress code while they are homeschooling, and the curriculum itself describes in detail what is required for proper and modest dress and grooming. Beards are not allowed, but an exception is granted to those who have one because of religious conviction. Once in ATI, a family is sent the curriculum on a regular basis. The curriculum consists of 52 Wisdom Booklets, which provide nearly all that is required to complete the education. These booklets make a stack just over a foot high. When a family has completed all the booklets, they start again from the beginning. The curriculum is intended to be used for all ages simultaneously -- K-12.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I find this fascinating like a big social trainwreck.  What a contrast to the &quot;let children choose&quot; stuff we talk about here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And from another former Gothardite: &quot;Mr. Gothard does not teach these wonderful truths which will set us free from the power of sin (the law) and to allow the Holy Spirit to empower us to be everything we were meant to be. No! He teaches how to be enslaved to the power and the penalty of sin. There is no freedom of the Spirit to lead in one&#39;s life. Gothard must think he has the blueprint for one&#39;s life. By the time you have &quot;progressed&quot; to the elite &quot;home education&quot; seminar, he will dictate when to get up in the morning, how to dress, what to eat (dietary law), what music to listen to, how to use the TV (never) and the newspaper (let others screen it for you), not to use contraceptives, when to have sex with your mate (based on Levitical law), what colors and styles to use in your dress, how to clean your house, how to check your mail, choice of toys, whether a man should wear a beard or not, how to use your money, how you should worship, how to be cleansed from sin, how to be right with your brothers, friendships, dating, and the list goes on. Gothard&#39;s blueprint is indeed a &quot;how to&quot; religion which gives people no room for personal Christianity. It is a way of controlling and cloning people. What area of life would the Holy Spirit be able to interact with a person under this system? Does Gothard know the mind of God so well that he can dictate so many details in the lives and hearts of God&#39;s people? Wouldn&#39;t this also isolate these people from any truth or added information from sources outside of the Gothard camp? Would it enhance an arrogance of superiority in the body of Christ because no one but Gothard knows God&#39;s way? (Source: Veinot & Henzel, A Matter of Basic Principles, pp.198-199.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This dad seemed to think that just tweaking the basis of the Christian school-at-home philosophy would cause better attitude and lifestyle:<br/>
<br/>
-=-A Baptist pastor wrote saying that his seven children are involved in home schooling with the Gothard ATI curriculum -- &quot;The improper interpretation of the Scripture and non-dispensationalism viewpoints are beginning to show in their attitudes, comments, and lifestyles. The beard issue started my concern (if you have one you are not in submission to God).&quot; Gothard teaches that beards indicate a lack of humility. (Personal e-mail on file.)<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
And this is for Ren, a former cultic Christian and current make-up artist:<br/>
<br/>
-=-16 Another example of Gothard&#39;s &quot;system&quot; is the IBLP Advanced Seminar Textbook -- Gothard provides information on how women are to select makeup and choose colors that enhance skin tone, how to choose a hair style, how to wear accessories, and the place of accents on the clothing, as well as how to stand (with illustrations) and why to avoid any slits in the skirt (pp. 276-281). Beyond these materials is a large set of notes called Advanced Training Institute of America. In it he teaches on self-image, responsibility, conscience, rights, freedom, success, purpose, friends, engagement, finances, gratefulness, and prayer. With material this extensive, one can only wonder when there would be time to read the Bible.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I MUST remind people, if outsiders say &quot;Homeschoolers are insane religious nuts,&quot; the only honest answer is &quot;Yes, some are.&quot;  To say &quot;No they&#39;re not&quot; or &quot;why would you say that?&quot; or &quot;Obviously you don&#39;t know any&quot; will make one seem dishonest or ignorant of the true craziness that&#39;s out there.<br/>

old Veteran&#39;s Hospital and have turned it into some kinda training <br/>
center/youth prison (really I don&#39;t know...but after reading about what <br/>
went on in Ill. I would not be surprised).It needed a lot of renovating <br/>

What they never figure out is you can&#39;t *teach* respect you can only give<br/>
it.  If you give it then kids can feel it&#39;s value and get filled up and<br/>
can give it to others.  The very reason schools have programs to teach<br/>
respect is because children are never on the receiving end of it and have<br/>
no knowledge of what it really is.  Those programs succeed in creating<br/>
kids who can parrot all the right language for a week or a month, but<br/>
that&#39;s all. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect it&#39;s that way with the other &quot;character building&quot; hypocrisy<br/>
they *teach* in schools. <br/>

authority?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve long wondered about the antipathy towards beards in some of <br/>
these organizations, as Jesus was a Jewish man, and under Mosaic law <br/>
was not allowed to even trim the edges of his beard. By his 30&#39;s he <br/>
surely had something LIKE bushy facial hair. One hundred years ago, <br/>
or maybe a little longer, men wore beards. It was The Style, and it&#39;s <br/>
one I&#39;d love to see come back. In fact, we attended a church right <br/>
after getting married, in which my hubby had the only beard, and it <br/>
did receive comment from the pastor. I dunno if they were <br/>
Goddardites, but I know they were into Ezzo (Growing Kids God&#39;s Way) <br/>
which advocates among other things, strict scheduled feedings and <br/>
deeply frowns upon a child in bed with mom and dad, or even in the <br/>
same room at night. Totally counter intuitive. And counter-biblical, <br/>
too.<br/>

such a thing is inconceivable, which is why Britain&#39;s anti-homosexuality <br/>
laws back then only refered to male homosexuality!<br/>
<br/>
One homeschooler years ago, desribed the Gothard system to me, it became <br/>
clear, in an attempt to convert me to christianity (I&#39;m a born again <br/>
atheist of some 37 years). She couldn&#39;t understand how I wouldn&#39;t think <br/>
Gothard was so transparently RIGHT that I wouldn&#39;t find God through him <br/>
and start homeschooling according to Gothard.<br/>
<br/>
Strange to say, I remainded unconvinced on both scores!<br/>
