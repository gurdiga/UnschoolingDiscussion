<div id="ygrps-yiv-2098720699">&quot;But with lumber and roofing materials there&#39;s no sense figuring it <br/>
out to the <br/>
inch because lumber and tarpaper and stuff only come in certain <br/>
sizes.  You <br/>
put it on and cut off the extra. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is very true, but....<br/>
I was making the materials list and knew the bottom 2x4 had to be 10 <br/>
feet. Knowing that the top piece would be longer, because of the <br/>
angle, I didn&#39;t know if 10 foot pieces would suffice or if I needed <br/>
12 foot 2x4. After doing the calculation, I could see that it was <br/>
such a tiny amount that the 10 foot would indeed work fine.....no <br/>
need to buy 12 foot and cut the extra off. :)<br/>
So sometimes, knowing a little math can save you money! Cool.<br/>
