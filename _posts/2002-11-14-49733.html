<div id="ygrps-yiv-696484976">Well for dinner tonight, Sierra had bread. Nothing on it, just bread. Now <br/>
this is a kid who usually can&#39;t do without her chicken every night. She&#39;s a <br/>
good eater, but tonight I guess was a bread night!! I don&#39;t worry at all <br/>
about what the kids eat during the day. I&#39;m with them and see that it evens <br/>
out. Sometimes not in a week, but it does. My son goes through periods of <br/>
liking just one thing for a long time. It use to be PB & J sandwiches. Then <br/>
it was cheese sandwiches. Then it was chips and sour cream. Each one would <br/>
last months. Now he&#39;s into chicken all of a sudden. He never eats meat <br/>
except for my meatballs in sauce. And the cheese is back again, but without <br/>
bread.<br/>
<br/>
I swear that my oldest for years lived on pizza, sauce and macaroni, <br/>
butter/garlic macaroni, PB & J, french fries, dry cereal and pancakes. This <br/>
lasted from about the age of 3 until she was about 14! She did add fast food <br/>
chicken in there along the way. Now she&#39;ll even have steak and eat veggies <br/>
and soup and salad. It&#39;s amazing it&#39;s the same kid. Dont sweat it, Tara is <br/>
living proof it all works out. She&#39;s healthier than the majority of kids I <br/>
know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280842128">I&#39;m going to forward this on to my hubby. Luckily for Jason I was (am to a point but <br/>
much better) a picky eater, so I do understand where he is coming from. I do think<br/>
that he has me beat though! It actually has helped me hear that lots of other kids<br/>
just don&#39;t like variety...I have to keep reminding myself that this is normal for<br/>
lots of kids and is part of who Jason is....<br/>
