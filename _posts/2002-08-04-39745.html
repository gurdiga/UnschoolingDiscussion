<div id="ygrps-yiv-94340983">Sandra - your cheap toy was Rosie the Reading Dog here - dd was<br/>
desperate for a dog.  I am a cat person and basically dislike<br/>
dogs.  After doing some research and talking to folks who had<br/>
working dogs, I was pretty sure that dd would have to be about 5<br/>
before she could be the emotional owner of a large dog (we&#39;re in<br/>
the country and a dog small enough for a hawk or coyote to get<br/>
readily would have been a mega tragedy).  I had no illusions that<br/>
at 5 she would be able to do the physical feeding/ washing and<br/>
all, but she needed to able to give commands that were lovingly<br/>
obeyed.  Biding her time till she was 5, she regularly told dog<br/>
stories and made up adventures with different kinds of dogs.  One<br/>
day the star was Rosie - the dog who could read.  DD wanted to<br/>
read - and had been reading in the sense of matching brands to<br/>
words and identifying some words since she was 2.<br/>
<br/>
She had a good grasp of sounds and a pretty fair sense of which<br/>
sounds went with which symbols.  As I said, we are in the middle<br/>
of nowhere, which involves some long car trips.  I heartily<br/>
recommend the no equipment, low effort car game of &quot;I see<br/>
something that starts with &#39;buh&#39;&quot; to which the other player may<br/>
reply &quot;It&#39;s a barn; I see something that starts with &#39;kuh&#39;&quot; or<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a barn; yarn rhymes with barn; what rhymes with &#39;cow&#39;&quot; or<br/>
any other variant the delays the dreaded &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But anyway back to Rosie the Reading dog - after she had told me<br/>
a couple of stories about Rosie&#39;s adventures (the poor dog got<br/>
locked into the library all night once, which I attribute to Marc<br/>
Brown, but that&#39;s OK) - I decided Rosie might be a message, so we<br/>
sat down to decide what Rosie looked like.  She was a red dog<br/>
(Clifford - where are you???) with long ears and so forth.  After<br/>
multiple drafts and some talking about how creatures with big<br/>
eyes are usually the young of a species or are supposed to be<br/>
particularly appealing (we did not overtly discuss anime, but she<br/>
asked me about Kiki&#39;s eyes the nest time she watched it) we had a<br/>
pretty cute 8 1/2 x 11 size dog.<br/>
<br/>
Now, dogs like bones and Rosie likes to read....put your selected<br/>
word endings on a bone shaped cut out, cut the slits that Sandra<br/>
recommended and make your strips of phoneme beginnings.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
tumble to the strips and slits until I had made a half a dozen or<br/>
so favorite/new word bones for dd, but I got tired of cutting out<br/>
bones and was trying to make things easier on myself. It worked<br/>
so well that I actually looked up the 42 (?) (don&#39;t remember any<br/>
more) consonant based phonemes and consciously mixed them up<br/>
between singles and digraphs on each strip.  DD has a folder with<br/>
Rosie and her bones and strips; it is in with the paper dolls and<br/>
coloring books.  She periodically gets it out to play with or as<br/>
a tool for making poems for birthday cards and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
If it had not been a fun game all the way along, I suspect I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have pursued it at all.  She will be 6 next week; loves<br/>
her dog; and while nothing in the dentist&#39;s office magazine<br/>
selection interests her, she independently reads much more that I<br/>
suspect, and with the occasional &quot;Mom what does *-*-*-* spell?&quot;<br/>
is happily working her way through Redwall again.<br/>
