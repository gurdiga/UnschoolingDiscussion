<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447418699">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
In response to Helen, I think that unschooling would work especially well<br/>
for you. Your children will have the opportunity to see first hand what you<br/>
do, and they may begin to have their own work that they want to do.  I work<br/>
many hours throughout the day at home, and<br/>
I like that my<br/>
children, 5 and 8 create their own goals and work.<br/>
We don&#39;t have a set schedule, but one of my children is a night<br/>
owl, so I spend an hour or so with her usually at night reading, listening,<br/>
singing whatever, and the same thing happens with my other daughter in the<br/>
morning while the night owl sleeps. Sometimes we are all on the same<br/>
schedule and that works out too. Just about every activity throughout the<br/>
day can be considered &quot;school&quot; time, because the learning never ceases, and<br/>
I am<br/>
available, but not at every given second.<br/>
Finally,to answer your question &quot;Do I need to plan some specific time to be<br/>
available or is it just all day long as needed?&quot;<br/>
You will have to try things to see what works best for your situation. You<br/>
may find, like me that you do both, because we do like to join others to go<br/>
on field trips, share projects, play games, a class here and there, so this<br/>
is time that has to be more scheduled.<br/>

  I&#39;m still weighing whether unschooling will work for me because I work<br/>
full-time from home for an internet research publisher. I have a couple<br/>
questions - hope this is the right forum:<br/>
<br/>
--How much time does the parent spend getting the kids set up each day if<br/>
any? Mine are 6 and 7 and so would be first & third grade in the fall. Do I<br/>
need to plan some specific time to be available or is it just all day long<br/>
as needed?</div>

&lt;&lt; You know what I mean here? A well-behaved child nets the parents strokes <br/>
of <br/>
 approval; a rambunctious prankster causes a parent embarrassment. Either <br/>
way, <br/>
 the child isn&#39;t seen as autonomous, but as a product of his/her parenting. I <br/>
 have to struggle with this one daily.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
    WOW! This is so timely. I was hiking this AM and thinking about my nearly <br/>
5 yr. old. Her behavior has been very outlandish and rude for almost all of <br/>
4. Her energy level is so high it comes out &quot;wrong&quot;. W/ our recent move all <br/>
of us have been stressed and not on our best behavior w/ one another. Not <br/>
being respectful. So I am reading a new book and had dh read a paragraph last <br/>
night that I thought was poinant. I felt she is reflecting my poor behavior <br/>
from this past month. She is very angry lately. I have been grumpy and short <br/>
tempered lately. He feels he has seen a huge downward change since she hung <br/>
out w/ a friend off and on the past 3.5 weeks. He can see the same faces and <br/>
voices and behavior. The friend is nearly 6. I did get rid of the whiny voice <br/>
syndrom by asking were her beautiful Zoe voice went b/c I love to hear her <br/>
voice. Never mentioned the whining or who it reminded me of. Took 2 days.<br/>
<br/>
    So I want to reconnect w/ this child again and enjoy eachother not be <br/>
worried about what others think about my rude child.(She starts demanding I <br/>
not speak to others when I see an acquaintance on the street). Small town I <br/>
probably see about 3 people each time out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-831669410">Laurie and I had no trouble communicating until she was around six <br/>
years old. I then noticed that she was getting a bit aggravated at me <br/>
from time-to-time. I read a book called P.E.T. Parent Effectiveness <br/>
Training (I don&#39;t like the title) and learned how to active listen. <br/>
It helped immensely...until she read it at age 8...then when I would <br/>
attempt to active listen she would say, &quot;Active listening again Mom?&quot; <br/>
We did get past that phase though and I learned to be a bit more <br/>
subtle so she couldn&#39;t always recognize it. <br/>
<br/>
I have found this technique to be useful with all people, although <br/>
it&#39;s not always easy to do. It takes time to listen and empathize and <br/>
I don&#39;t always feel like doing that. With Laurie, I always find the <br/>
time though. She&#39;s still my baby. <br/>
<br/>
