 </span></blockquote>Do you think (and this is for anyone who wants to respond) that college is <br/>
all about careers and schooly things?  When my oldest decided to go I was <br/>
excited for her and sad of course to see her leave, but it was about so much MORE <br/>
than just school and career.  It was about learning about herself, and learning <br/>
about people and places and all kinds of things she had never been around <br/>
(tiny college town in the middle of cotton farming families).<br/>
<br/>
Learning to get along with people she hadn&#39;t chosen to be with but <br/>
circumstances put them together, oh, there is SO much more than just the educational <br/>
requirements for her career that she learned and enjoyed about college.<br/>
<br/>
College is a sort of right of passage in many ways isn&#39;t it?  My oldest son <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go to college, so he didn&#39;t.  In many ways I wished he had gone <br/>
to college, just for the fun and excitement of it all, even if he didn&#39;t want <br/>
a career that required it.  Life can be hard and while I respected his <br/>
choices, I secretly longed to see him be more of a boy without so much responsibility <br/>
at a young age.  It&#39;s hard to see him out in very cold weather and come home <br/>
with sore bleeding hands just so he can pay his bills, barely, but it was his <br/>
choice and things are better for him now.  But it was hard as a mother to know <br/>
he could have been in a nice warm dorm room somewhere exploring so many new <br/>
things and worrying about which party he would be at next.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that some parents expect college and mostly for the career part of <br/>
it, but I really think it holds so much more for children/young adults/adults <br/>
who WANT to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Would it upset me if I paid for four or five years of college to have my son <br/>
come home and go into the construction industry which he could have done right <br/>
out of high school, not at all.  I do know that it probably would be a <br/>
different story with dad though.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t designed to be.  It shouldn&#39;t be.  But people go into it with<br/>
those expectations and the economy is changing to make it more like that.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun I had in college (well, ok, not the most fun -leer-) was the<br/>
chance to take a class just because it looked interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I have recommended to students that they do what I did.  Most schools have a<br/>
&quot;basic requirements&quot; list.  You have to have two arts, two history, etc.  I<br/>
took any class that looked good so long as it fulfilled a requirement I<br/>
didn&#39;t already have.  I was just filling in the blanks with things that<br/>
looked good.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of two years I sat back and looked at what I&#39;d taken.  Funny, I<br/>
was about halfway to a degree in English Lit with a minor in Anthro.<br/>
Without even trying.<br/>
<br/>
So suddenly, I knew what I wanted to study.  -grin-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726566570">College mortgaged my (our) future to the hilt!  Not a guarantee is CORRECT!  It&#39;s a debt unless you are from a wealthy family.  Class-based or what!<br/>
<br/>
I have two degrees and I&#39;d trade either one for two more years of Toastmasters.  FARRRR more practical in the work world.  Teaches all the &quot;benefits&quot; of a college education + leadership (NO, there is no practical leadership taught in any college cirric I&#39;ve seen, they teach the theory of leadership - totally different!), speaking your mind, and persuading others.  This makes managers and entrepreneurs, NOT FRIGGIN&#39; school.  Take it from a guy who only uses the pieces of paper as an easy means of getting interviews.<br/>
<br/>
As Sher says in Wishcraft, you don&#39;t need a degree unless you want to be a regulated profession - doctor, lawyer, engineer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971238398">I was discussing this post with my dh this morning.  I was telling <br/>
him how I loved college, it was such an enlightening experience and <br/>
time for me.  Of course, I had to add that I also needed alot of <br/>
enlightenment..LMAO!  My parents were not too open minded and <br/>
although I was the black sheep I was still pretty rigid.  IT was a <br/>
wonderful time for me to explore different topics, classes, some <br/>
things that may have seemed &quot;UGH&quot; at first that I loved.  Big shift <br/>
in thinking for me at this time!<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, the next train of thought was hopefully my kids will <br/>
experience this before they get to that age.  Maybe they won&#39;t need <br/>
so much enlightenment! I am really quite comfortable with my kids not <br/>
going to college.  My only hope for them is them is they find what <br/>
they love and understand that even that will require determination <br/>
and work.  Of course, if by 18 they have no direction I admit I will <br/>
be a wreck, but they are 2 and 4 so I have plenty of time!<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
Anyway, interesting how college has this *unschooling* quality where <br/>
you can take classes that are of interest to you (besides the <br/>
requirements) and most often direct your own learning in that you <br/>
don&#39;t have attendance, etc.  Of course, this is if you are not <br/>
following a specific career track that truely interests you.  What <br/>
happened to the wonderful respect of Humanities degrees? I don&#39;t <br/>
think unschooled kids need that college time to *grow up* or *find <br/>
themselves*, hopefully by that age they have already done alot of the <br/>
ground work for that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I never did the sororities and such.  No regrets there, to me <br/>
that was another pecking order system.  Any group that needs hazing, <br/>
even in moderate forms, is copying the structure of much of the <br/>
parenting that goes on and the schooling that they were exposed to.  <br/>
Of course, this is just my experience with it so maybe someone from <br/>
the inside may have a more in depth understanding. <br/>
<br/>
Olga :)<br/>
Gosh, I got long winded there!<br/>
