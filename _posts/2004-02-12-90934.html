<div id="ygrps-yiv-598184341">I had the weirdest feeling one day not too long ago when I realized how much <br/>
math my 12yro son had learned the past few years with absolutely no effort on <br/>
my part, we have had lots of conversations but I was only answering what he <br/>
was asking or explaining something he asked about. It was one of those aha <br/>
moments but also scary in a way. I had went my whole life being convinced that we <br/>
needed math taught to us, that math comes in a book and if we don&#39;t teach it <br/>
that way then we won&#39;t learn it. It was a moment when a lot of what I thought to <br/>
be true was really shaken to the core, in a very good way, like the clouds <br/>
parted I and could see the truth. But it was also one of those moments that I <br/>
kept thinking how can this be, is this true, does he really know what I think he <br/>
knows, how did he get to this and so on. <br/>
<br/>
That is a lot of words to try to describe what happened in a very short time <br/>
but that is really how it happened. Then I wondered if the people spending all <br/>
of the time teaching math or any other subject know the real truth or do they <br/>
really believe it needs to be taught that way.<br/>
<br/>
It was an &quot;is this real moment&quot;, can this be real when it goes against <br/>
everything I had thought up to then. It still leaves me shaken.<br/>

I had exactly the same experience.  I have Saxon books and we would dabble here and there, as my anxiety meter would go up.<br/>
<br/>
Well, after a year or 2 of not doing anything, my anxiety got the best of me and I got out the saxon 7/6 book again.  I picked problems from various portions of the book and we did them orally.  Low and behold he did them all in his head, even problems with negative numbers, percents, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
He can even do some algebra.<br/>
<br/>
It was quite an eye opener for me too to realize that math does *not* need to be learned linear fashion.  That is yet one more sacred cow of the education industry.<br/>

<br/>
I think the eye-opener for me is not that math doesn&#39;t<br/>
need to be learned from books, but that it will still<br/>
be learned.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of had this idea that when we started<br/>
unschooling that maybe higher math just &quot;wasn&#39;t<br/>
important&quot; and that they wouldn&#39;t learn it, but I<br/>
needed to be ok with that.<br/>
<br/>
People kept saying, &quot;if the child needs to know it,<br/>
they will learn it&quot;, and I took that to mean that<br/>
unless my kids decided to be doctors or scientists or<br/>
engineers, they would never have a reason to learn<br/>
higher math so probably wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am realizing that it will be learned, and better<br/>
and more deeply.  I don&#39;t have to accept that math<br/>
won&#39;t be learned; I was resigning my kids to a less<br/>
rich knowledge (in my thinking) because I didn&#39;t<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?  I mean, higher math isn&#39;t<br/>
something separate from their world right now, where<br/>
they are, and they are already in the process of<br/>
learning what they will need as well as what they need<br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, if I am being obtuse then I better stop<br/>
rambling.  I am sure someone will clarify this so that<br/>
you will know what I mean.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they believe it&#39;s necessary except in the cases of rare genius, and <br/>
as they have test scores on those kids in their schools they know they&#39;re not <br/>
&quot;rare geniuses.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
When people grow up in school and like school and continue on by becoming <br/>
part of it by staying in school and then immediately teaching in school (as I <br/>
did) it woudn&#39;t be hard to just live there for life, certain that it&#39;s good and <br/>
real and right and the only salvation of an ignorant world.<br/>
<br/>
What messed that comforting continuum up for me was that it was the 60&#39;s/70&#39;s <br/>
and school reform was rampant, and I fell into a period at the University of <br/>
New Mexico when school reformers were the main part of the faculty at the <br/>
college of education.  <br/>
<br/>
That shouldn&#39;t have mattered, since I was an English major and studying <br/>
psychology and anthropology/folklore secondarily.   But guess what?  It really got <br/>
to me, because what they were saying was borne out by the classes on thinking <br/>
and learning and communications I was taking, and by the stories of how <br/>
cultures are passed on I was hearing in the anthropology department, and the things <br/>
I knew that were making my English classes easier were things I had learned on <br/>
my own for fun.  History of words, historical forms of English (King James <br/>
Bible English helped me more in Shakespeare than anything else did, and they <br/>
sure hand&#39;t taught me any of that in school OR really in church, I&#39;d figured it <br/>
out because I thought it was cool).<br/>
<br/>
So...   If teachers have the opportunity to isolate themselves in the happy <br/>
belief that they only know their own subject because they learned it in school <br/>
and they&#39;re doing the world a favor by maintaining that unbroken line of trad<br/>
ition, then they will sleep better and probably digest better (thinking back to <br/>
that shared sit-down dinner thread &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
They probably REALLY do not want to know that kids can learn those things <br/>
painlessly and in other orders.    It&#39;s okay for us not to tell them yet.  Let <br/>
them be happy for now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think we should keep running our &quot;experiment&quot; and let the schools be.  A <br/>
few years down the line, we might give them cause to pause, when our kids are <br/>
grown and will be heard, as adults, to say &quot;I learned to read on my own,&quot; and <br/>
&quot;Math isn&#39;t hard if you figure out it from real-life situations.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Roya has a college math teacher who is like that. She taught high <br/>
school for 20 years and now teaches a class at the community college. <br/>
Roya asked her a question about something - saying &quot;In my last math <br/>
class we were shown to do whateveritis &quot;this&quot; way and now you&#39;re <br/>
showing us &quot;a different&quot; way. Can you explain the difference?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The teacher LITERALLY said: &quot;That was Math 100 and this is Math 120 and <br/>
this is how we do it in Math 120.&quot; As if that was an explanation.<br/>

We are having a similar experience with reading in our house.  I liked how you put it...when the anxiety meter goes up...and in our case I had to respond to my husbands anxiety about us &quot;not doing anything&quot; about reading.  My daughter, husband and i agreed together that she would &quot;work from a book.&quot;  At first she enjoyed the new activity.  Then would get bored.  Then it became my asking her to do it. And when i found myself pushing the issue - we dropped it.  Fortunately my dh was OK with this as well.  A year would go by and anxiety meter would go up so dd and i found another style book to &quot;work&quot; with.  Low and behold her understanding of the concepts were moving right along.  Without any &quot;structured&quot; activity.  We&#39;ve done this off and on for many years.   When she wants to &quot;work&quot; from a book, or dh anx. meter rises - every time we &quot;do&quot; something specific towards reading I notice the leap in her understanding.<br/>
<br/>
It helps my dh a lot when i forward many of your posts to him.<br/>
