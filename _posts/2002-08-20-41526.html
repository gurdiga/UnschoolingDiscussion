Keep in mind that only the humans (adults) performing in the circuses<br/>

(children) well.  But, in order to get animals (children) to perform<br/>
unnatural, silly, and scary tricks, other methods of &quot;training&quot; must be<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Ned, for tying in what I thought was totally off topic.  However, <br/>
it was I, Marji, who wrote the above, not Tina.<br/>
<br/>
So, in other words, we are not only unschooling, we&#39;re uncircusing!<br/>
