Ha, Ha!!!&nbsp; I did the same thing when the kids and I started talking
about this....
<br>I ran and found that book, and we made one, and <i>then</i> realized
this was a boat, not a hat!!&nbsp; :)
<br>Ooops!
<br>Oh well.
<br>A friend has a birthday today, so we were making her a hat!
<br>Anyway, I make them from the Family.com site&nbsp; that someone sent.&nbsp;
They are great!!!&nbsp; Very easy, and i am not talented at all in the
crafting dept.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t have masking tape, but did have that blue
tape from taping windows I was painting.&nbsp; That worked great.&nbsp;
I also didn&#39;t have much to decorate, so i just fringed the floppy hat,
and we used glitter to write their names.&nbsp; They turned out very cute,
and were a huge hit at science class today.
<br>Thanks everyone for all of your help.&nbsp; I now have to go make hats
for two teddy bears and a baby doll.&nbsp; :)
