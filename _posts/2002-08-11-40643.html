<div id="ygrps-yiv-457557213">Here&#39;s a neat thing some of your kids might get into.  It&#39;s called <br/>
Flat Travelers, based on the book Flat Stanley.  Kids make little <br/>
flat travelers.  They can be people, animals, or whatever.  Then they <br/>
find someone on the list of people who are willing to host their flat <br/>
traveler.  Your flat traveler goes on a trip (through the mail!) to <br/>
their home and they show them around.  They keep a journal of the <br/>
flat traveler&#39;s activities and maybe take some pictures and send your <br/>
flat traveler back home after a week. My kids are really getting into <br/>
it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826126887">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may have already heard of this and may be participating, but I <br/>
wanted to send the link out for those who might not have.  This is a great <br/>
program based on the book Flat Stanley - you make flat travelers and mail <br/>
them to others in the program, and host some as well.  You fill out journals <br/>
for the travelers and mail them back after a week or two, and send back <br/>
postcards and/or souvenirs, whatever you want.  The idea is for them to get <br/>
to know your area.  You get to make friends from all over the world and see <br/>
how other people live, and get a glimpse of other states and countries.  My <br/>
kids are learning tons about geography (we have a huge wall map and put a <br/>
star everywhere our travelers visit and a different colored star for our <br/>
guests) and they are so thrilled when a traveler comes home or we get a new <br/>
guest.  We currently have travelers in Canada, New Zealand and Australia, <br/>
plus various states.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you&#39;d like to participate, it&#39;s free (or almost free, it&#39;ll cost <br/>
you a stamp)- just go to &lt;A HREF=&quot;www.flattravelers.com&quot;&gt;www.flattravelers.com&lt;/A&gt;!  <br/>
<br/>
Happy traveling!<br/>
