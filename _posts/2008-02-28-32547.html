<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091926482">Yesterday there was a lady in line behind us at the store. Wanting to be friendly with the girls she asks are you guys of of school today? My 8 year old tells her no Im a no schooler and 4 year old says yea Im a no schooler too. So I end up giving this stranger a quick explination of unschooling. <br/>
  She looks at the girls and asks one of the standards.....Well how do you learn?<br/>
   <br/>
  With the omg! its so simple body language my 4 year old says well I learn cause Im a learner. <br/>

My kids say &quot;homeschooled&quot; in public.  The law has allowances for  <br/>
home schooling and that&#39;s what we do.<br/>
Unschooling is only a sensible term within the homeschooling  <br/>
community.  It&#39;s a particular kind of homeschooling, but it&#39;s still  <br/>
part of that.<br/>
<br/>
Or they would say &quot;We don&#39;t go to school,&quot; and the other people would  <br/>
say, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re homeschooled?&quot; and the answer to that is/was/should  <br/>
be &quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is great, though:<br/>
