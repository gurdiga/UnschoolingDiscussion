<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>14 Apr 2003, at  8:11pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180239002">My son, my husband, and I all sat down and talked together about some of the issues we had.<br/>
<br/>
We came up with something we think we can all live with in the way of expectations and responsibility when out and about.  (I know I&quot;m being somewhat vague here, but I prefer not to get into the details).<br/>
<br/>
Hubby did not get into a shouting match with son, instead, waiting for me so we could calmly handle it together.  Son did not dismiss hubby.  (This shouting/dismissing has been an ongoing struggle).<br/>
<br/>
We also discussed the sleep issue we were having (hubby thinks kids should be in bed earlier because he worries what they might be doing without any supervision).  I pointed out that I am also usually up very late, and that they usually go to bed soon after I do.  I also pointed out that I&#39;d rather they be asleep in the mornings when I&#39;m sleeping the most soundly.<br/>
<br/>
We agreed that it really is not an issue unless ds gets a job and then skips work because he doesn&#39;t want to get up and go (something which has never happened anyway when ds has had a job).<br/>
<br/>
Hubby feels like we are all having fun all day at his expense.  We asked for a list of things he needs to get done so that we can help him out while we are at home...since we *do* get to stay up as late as we want and we *do* get to sleep as late as we want and we *do* get to have as much or as little fun as we want every day while he is working all day.<br/>
<br/>
AND, hubby and I had a frank discussion about &quot;unschooling&quot; and this time I used the term.  We talked about the difference between that and homeschooling.  We talked about why I think its a good idea.  We talked about what it means in terms of &quot;keeping up with the school kids&quot;...and I asked him if he could be comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
He thinks he can.<br/>
<br/>
We are finally parenting as a team AND unschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
Life is GRAND<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
