<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>16 Dec 2002, at  7:05pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072274027">My mom teaches college English classes at several colleges in the area.  Over the past few years, she has had several students choose homeschooling as a topic to write about.<br/>
<br/>
She generally requires them to interview people for research and present both sides of the issue, or support one side or the other after doing research on both sides.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have to laugh because she always gets peeved when the papers come back slanted with the usual crap:  socialization, parents can&#39;t teach what they aren&#39;t expert in, yada yada yada.  Several times she&#39;s told me that they only interview one side, and spend very little time investigating the homeschool side. <br/>
<br/>
Well, she asked me if I&#39;d like to come into her classes and have the students interview me and I could talk about homeschooling, etc.  I said yes.  Should be fun :o).  I think it will be this spring and next fall.  <br/>
<br/>
Kristen, the one who was the teenage queen of debate at home ha ha ha.  My mama done told me I should have been a lawyer! <br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
