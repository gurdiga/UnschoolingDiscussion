 </span></blockquote>Thank you DAR!!  Is there any way you could write a short essay or <br/>
article on the benefits of unschooling special children?  And maybe <br/>
some examples of success&#39;s you&#39;ve witnessed?  With you being a <br/>
credentialed special ed teacher, that would help a TON.  I&#39;ll <br/>
probably be working on my information all night, and I want to make <br/>
sure that if it gets seen by a judge (I&#39;m praying it won&#39;t come to <br/>
that) that the judge also gets views from people of various levels. <br/>
<br/>
Also could we exchange emails sometime privately.  It would be great <br/>
to have an educator sometime who understands.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I could write something up, if it comes to that - but I think it&#39;s<br/>
important to *not* give the state any more than they&#39;re legally required<br/>
to get. I went and read some of your earlier posts, and looked up the<br/>
laws in Georgia, and they have no legal right to ask you for any of that.<br/>
You have to send a monthly attendance report, a yearly progress report<br/>
and a yearly declaration of homeschooling, and do standardized testing<br/>
every 3 years. You *don&#39;t* have to tell anyone whether you&#39;re<br/>
school-at-homing or unschooling, and you don&#39;t have to justify<br/>
homeschooling - and doing so just sets you up for more harassment, IMO,<br/>
plus it sets up other homeschoolers for harassment if they don&#39;t ive the<br/>
same kinds of information.. How about meeting them at the door with a<br/>
copy of Georgia ed regs<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/lawregs/georgia.html)">http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/lawregs/georgia.html)</a>, and copies of #1,<br/>
#2, and #3 - and then telling her she doesn&#39;t have a right to any more<br/>
information?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming this &quot;caseworker&quot; is someone with the school system, right?<br/>

teacher is part of my qualifications for talking about unschooling any<br/>
kid...<br/>
