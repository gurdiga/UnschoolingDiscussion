<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595419210">Try having a dog giving puppies in your house. This has been way more<br/>
interesting to the children than TV. Nikki had 9 puppies on Friday. One died<br/>
Sunday afternoon. The other eight are doing wonderfully. any one need a<br/>
puppy?<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I don&#39;t really agree with some of your feelings that a<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling moms role is to constantly involve her children in<br/>
&gt; &gt; countless excursions and fun activities.  Children need to be left<br/>
&gt; &gt; alone as well. They need to use their own abilities to entertain<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves.  Distractions and entertainment come in many forms. While<br/>
&gt; &gt; a mother who keeps her kids busy with activity is using a more<br/>
&gt; &gt; sensory approach then TV or video games it is ultimately steering<br/>
&gt; &gt; children in the mothers chosen direction.  I am definitely not saying<br/>
&gt; &gt; that you should sit around the house all day but I also don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that running all over the place trying to keep kids &quot;busy&quot; is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; answer.  There are a LOT of homeschooling/unschooling moms who do<br/>
&gt; &gt; this and I just don&#39;t agree...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tara, I completely agree with you (and I&#39;ll wager most unschoolers here<br/>
do,<br/>
&gt; too).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My posts on activities may have been confusing -- I was trying to get<br/>
across<br/>
&gt; that if there is consistently nothing more interesting than TV (and TV is<br/>
&gt; pretty interesting to most humans) that that is what a child will do. I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t mean for everyone to be constantly on the move. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Boredom is, IMHO, a vital part of unschooling. From boredom comes the<br/>
&gt; motivation to do amazing things.<br/>
