<div id="ygrps-yiv-173553432">Hi everyone -<br/>
<br/>
I read this article:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://inquisitivekid.ca/newsletters/Natural%20Child%20May_June%202008.pdf">http://inquisitivekid.ca/newsletters/Natural%20Child%20May_June%202008.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
online (The Natural Child Magazine) and wanted to hear what you all<br/>
think about it.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely think that most kids need more time for free play than<br/>
they&#39;re getting (and that is a really good reason to not send them to<br/>
experiencing generosity and abundance and saying yes as much as<br/>
possible. Also, should we say &quot;no&quot; to electronic, plastic toys because<br/>
they are not as &quot;good&quot; for the children and definitely not good for<br/>
the environment? (I think I know the answer already!)<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it is similar to food -- we should be offering them a whole<br/>
array of toy and play experiences so they can choose. I have to admit<br/>
I really LIKE some of the &quot;educational&quot; toys and so does my daughter.<br/>
(Like Leap Frog -- the alphabet magnet refrigerator toy is awesome!)<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?</div>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You do?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say the answer is there is no &quot;we.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t ask &quot;should we say no?&quot; without defining &quot;we&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the saddest stories I have heard since I started reading  <br/>
homeschooling and parenting stories online was of a mom who  <br/>
discovered Steinerism/Waldorf one day, and that night she replaced  <br/>
all her child&#39;s plastic toys with wooden stuff--she got it out of the  <br/>
house like it was satanic debris.   And her son had had a My Little  <br/>
Pony that he loved, it was his special huggy toy, and she had thrown  <br/>
it away.<br/>
<br/>
Way to improve faith and health, mom.   She hurt the environment more  <br/>
by throwing away a plastic toy, and she crushed her son&#39;s soul.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So what was your question?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh no, your making me think and clarify early in the morning (well<br/>
early for me!) I guess that&#39;s my own fault &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let me see... The more I think about it the less sure I am what my<br/>
&quot;question&quot; is. The way I read the article there seemed to be parts<br/>
that &quot;jive&quot; with unschooling and parts that definitely did NOT. Since<br/>
I am still trying to figure out how all of this fits together in my<br/>
life I wanted to bounce it off of more experienced people and see if<br/>
my interpretation matches. <br/>
<br/>
I can see the benefit of children having more free time (less<br/>
&quot;Structured time&quot;) and having more exposure to toys and/or materials<br/>
that encourage creativity. But how does that fit in with really<br/>
supporting children in their own interests and desires? I love the<br/>
idea of being truly generous with my children and not saying &quot;no&quot; just<br/>
so they learn that they &quot;can&#39;t always get what they want&quot;. Or saying<br/>
&quot;no&quot; because what they want is &quot;bad&quot; for the environment. I love the<br/>
stories of older unschooled children who are truly generous and<br/>
mature... I love the analogy of something becoming &quot;spoiled&quot; because<br/>
it doesn&#39;t get ENOUGH attention (eg food). Of course I said that<br/>
recently and was met with the response that my daughter is<br/>
&quot;overindulged&quot; then (instead of spoiled - She is 2 and I bought her a<br/>
pair of sandals that she wanted and didn&#39;t really &quot;need&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
ok, not sure that I am really clarifying here... more rambling. I need<br/>
some help I guess!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393400044">First off, it&#39;s in Natural Child Magazine, so the readers WANT to  <br/>
read that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to be picky here, and pounce on something in the intro blurb:<br/>
<br/>
In a world full of battery-operated, loud,<br/>
media-branded, one-dimensional,<br/>
plastic toys with no imagination, toys<br/>
that are well-made, simple, natural<br/>
and conducive to independent,<br/>
unstructured play are critical to<br/>
stimulating children, accelerating<br/>
their development and<br/>
enhancing their well-being.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wooden toys don&#39;t have any more imagination than plastic toys do, and  <br/>
there are NO one-dimensional toys.  It doesn&#39;t make physical sense.   <br/>
One dimension is a theoretical line, and nobody can mold that in  <br/>
plastic.  So without even getting to the real article, I&#39;m already  <br/>
irritated.<br/>
<br/>
That intro isn&#39;t a quote from the article, so maybe it was written by  <br/>
an editor.<br/>
<br/>
-=-“Play, from toddler toys<br/>
to adult gaming, has<br/>
become such a serious<br/>
activity that the idea of<br/>
free play – play for the<br/>
pure fun of it – has gone<br/>
the way of stickball and<br/>
paper dolls.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Paper dolls were crap.<br/>
And where I lived, we never played &quot;stickball,&quot; ever.  We had real  <br/>
vacant lots and real bats.<br/>
<br/>
Nostalgia is a way for parents to justify limiting their children,  <br/>
and a way of them reliving their own youths, but children who will  <br/>
mature in 2020 don&#39;t need stickball or paper dolls.<br/>
<br/>
How can we overcome this dilemma?<br/>
For one, stand firm and try not to give in.<br/>
David Elkind, author and professor of<br/>
child development, tells the following<br/>
story: “I recall pestering my mother to<br/>
buy a certain cereal so I could collect the<br/>
box tops. But my mother did not buy us<br/>
that cereal. I kept pestering her and complaining<br/>
about not having what my<br/>
friends had. Finally, exasperated with<br/>
my nagging and having housework and<br/>
other children to deal with, my mother<br/>
said firmly and conclusively, ‘Who cares<br/>
what you want?’ My mother cared about<br/>
what we needed but didn’t worry about<br/>
what we wanted.”<br/>
<br/>
That story is included to encourage parents to ignore their  <br/>
children&#39;s desires.  And there&#39;s the implied promise that it could  <br/>
lead to them becoming professors and authors!  And of course it  <br/>
didn&#39;t hurt David Elkind (athough it might be interesting to  <br/>
magically know why he grew up to study child development &lt;bwg&gt;, and I  <br/>
say &quot;magically&quot; because asking him might not work, if he hasn&#39;t  <br/>
thought about it much).<br/>
<br/>
-=-How can we stop our children from<br/>
becoming targets of consumerism at an<br/>
early age? Select toys according to their<br/>
play merit – natural, imaginative, openended,<br/>
etc. – instead of their brand<br/>
names.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Which brand names is he talking about?  Discovery Toys?  Fisher  <br/>
Price?  Playskool?  Duplo?  I really don&#39;t know.  But I don&#39;t know  <br/>
anyone who has chosen toys just by brand name. I do know a mom who  <br/>
chose toys that matched her decor:  Primary colors, no pastels.  And  <br/>
I&#39;m sure there have been a few moms who had pastel nurseries and  <br/>
avoided primary colors, but I haven&#39;t met them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If children are<br/>
first exposed to toys made of natural materials,<br/>
they will have a healthy standard<br/>
by which to judge synthetics.<br/>
Why not let our children experience<br/>
wooden animals or blocks and cotton and<br/>
wool dolls or puppets?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What about rubber?  That&#39;s natural.  I have three toys saved from my  <br/>
childhood, two from my infancy.  I have a rubber Indian with a  <br/>
tomahawk (VERY non-PC, and it stopped squeaking just a few years  <br/>
ago.  I was already 50.  It did last a while), a teddy bear (not  <br/>
rubber--all cloth but the eyes), and a Tiny Tears doll--rubber body,  <br/>
probably a kind of hard papier-mache head.  Not plastic.<br/>
<br/>
This guy totally skipped the main toy materials of the mid-20th  <br/>
century:  steel and rubber.  I cut the corner of one of my fingers  <br/>
off--not the bone, just flesh and nail--with a toy ironing board.  It  <br/>
was steel pipe that folded up and didn&#39;t have a cap on it.  So it was  <br/>
a lever with a sharp end.   Hooray!  But it was metal, and so &quot;natural.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why not let our children experience<br/>
wooden animals or blocks and cotton and<br/>
wool dolls or puppets? When machine<br/>
made toys are in such abundance, handcrafted<br/>
toys take on a new value and significance.<br/>
They reunite us with the real<br/>
world.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unless the family doesn&#39;t feel separate from the real world to begin  <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
They also teach us environmental responsibility.<br/>
Unfortunately, most hightech<br/>
or plastic toys are not fixable. We<br/>
used to be able to prop the toy open, replace<br/>
a spring or elastic or glue it back together.<br/>
Voila, the toy was as good as<br/>
new. Today, we endure toys that have a<br/>
short lifespan and cannot be fixed;<br/>
buying a new toy is cheaper than fixing<br/>
the old one, so we simply toss it away. If<br/>
we are to help children learn the meaning<br/>
of sustainability, this must change.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good point.  I wonder if that family owns any of the other  <br/>
not-worth-fixing things that are around these days?  Microwave, DVD  <br/>
player, computers are just about at that point.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I have repaired many plastic toys, by heating a wire and  <br/>
putting it through the plastic to pin a leg or whatever had come  <br/>
off.  We&#39;ve glued them, too.  I understand the author&#39;s point, but  <br/>
it&#39;s again assuming all natural-material toys are repairable.  Marty  <br/>
loved a hippo he had, but the cloth was cheap and it was stuffed with  <br/>
sawdust-like stuff, and when it started to leak I couldn&#39;t fix it.   <br/>
Every stitch tore the cloth.  So when you go with natural materials,  <br/>
get GOOD ones. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why not supply boys with boy dolls, dollhouses that can also<br/>
be converted to farmhouses or fire stations? Can young girls not<br/>
enjoy boats and trains rather than pink castles and princesses? Can<br/>
we not find a healthy balance?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Just earlier this month Holly and Sophie played with our Fisher Price  <br/>
people, and the boys always did too when they were little.  We got  <br/>
most of it used, and there&#39;s a filling station, airport, parking  <br/>
garage, farm, playground, houses, all kinds of cars--lots of non- <br/>
gender-specific play.  But although the really old dolls have wooden  <br/>
bodies, most of it&#39;s plastic.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Pre-programmed electronic toys monopolize the brain and<br/>
negatively impact children’s creativity when they demand response<br/>
to a scenario constructed by someone else.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is true of electronic toys that only have one outcome and no  <br/>
creativity allowed, like quiz games.    But it&#39;s not true of all  <br/>
electronic toys.  Holly&#39;s on another Harvest Moon jag.  Now she&#39;s on  <br/>
Game Boy because she can take it with her (she took me to the dentist  <br/>
the other morning, and was playing there while she waited).  One of  <br/>
the most fun things with that is to figure out what happens when you  <br/>
&quot;play wrong,&quot; because the programmers have taken it all into  <br/>
consideration so that there aren&#39;t dead ends or program-stopping  <br/>
moves, and some of it&#39;s cute and funny.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So let’s encourage our children to go out and play, rather than<br/>
sitting glued to the TV or computer game. Their health, social and<br/>
intellectual development will benefit.-=-<br/>
<br/>
A few things:  &quot;Let&#39;s encourage our children&quot; reminds me of a nurse  <br/>
asking &quot;How are we feeling?&quot;  &quot;We&quot; don&#39;t need to do anything as a group.<br/>
And &quot;glued to the TV&quot; is not something anyone wants.  But he&#39;s  not  <br/>
saying --Bring your kids in and don&#39;t leave them outside glued to a  <br/>
bike, or glued to a tree, or glued to the sandbox.--  The loaded  <br/>
phrasing is saved for &quot;the bad guys.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And do children need to &quot;go out&quot; to play?  And why can&#39;t parents go  <br/>
out too?<br/>
<br/>
As a reminder to young parents that it&#39;s good to have all kinds of  <br/>
toys, and that imagination is good, it&#39;s a good article.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  The author has something to sell:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Peter Emmenegger “Nurturing the Playful Mind” Page 24<br/>
is the father of two young children. He owns an e-store  <br/>
www.inquisitivekid.ca, which carries natural<br/>
toys and furniture. He believes that toys that are pure in form and  <br/>
color foster imagination<br/>
and instill independence and a desire to accomplish, and that we can  <br/>
make the world a better<br/>
place, one child at a time, by giving kids what they really need.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay.  My kids had lots of wooden toys.  We had a big basket  <br/>
of &quot;medieval toys&quot;--things that kids in the Middle Ages might have  <br/>
had--that we took to SCA events.  Everything in there was wood or  <br/>
metal or cloth, and appropriate to the period.  It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not  <br/>
aware of the differences, and we did have very many wooden toys, and  <br/>
cloth to play with for costumes.  Marty just lately went to a party  <br/>
and part of his costume was a big rectangle of dark blue silky cloth  <br/>
(though not real silk) that was in the dress-up box.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the idea of having a range and letting children  <br/>
choose.   If anyone here thinks the Waldorf philosophy of colors and  <br/>
textures is what their child really needs (because that author is  <br/>
strong into parents knowing what kids need), then there&#39;s a world of  <br/>
support (and sales) to help you live a Waldorf life.  (Hey, isn&#39;t  <br/>
that pretty much becoming a brand name now?)<br/>
<br/>
Oh...<br/>
There&#39;s that intro paragraph, from the toy-sales site:<br/>
&quot;In a world full of plastic toys, battery operated, loud toys, media  <br/>
branded toys, one-dimensional toys with no imagination; why not  <br/>
choose beautiful, well-made objects that are critical to stimulating  <br/>
children, accelerating their development, and enhancing their well- <br/>
being? &quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t begrudge them doing what they&#39;re doing at all, and the  <br/>
article is fine for the audience to which it was aimed.<br/>
<br/>
I also think some kids will be wildly creative and imaginative no  <br/>
matter what, and others will be not so much of either, no matter what.<br/>

How much more free time can kids have than unschooled kids have?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even if an unschooled kid is in dance lessons and a theatre troupe  <br/>

school.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of living by principles is important to remember.   <br/>
People aren&#39;t &quot;more principled&quot; the more principles they try to  <br/>
follow.  They&#39;re more principled in the degree to which they know  <br/>
what their principles are and live by them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if someone&#39;s principles include a boycott of plastic and  <br/>
electronics (and they&#39;re hypocrites if we know about it by computer  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), then that will be a guiding principle for them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend boycotting Chinese-made goods.  I&#39;ve been buying  <br/>
stuff straight from Hong Kong, from people whose English is  <br/>
atrocious.  So I like to think I&#39;m keeping Europeans/NorthAmericans/ <br/>
whoever from exploiting Chinese goods.  But is import &quot;exploitation&quot;  <br/>
when they set a price and get what they asked for?  How can a  <br/>
capitalist country like the U.S. begrudge other countries a  <br/>
capitalist economy?  (Oh... easily.  We want to keep the capitalism  <br/>
for ourselves.)<br/>
<br/>
So just about ever principle leads to a political end if you follow  <br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
At my house, choice is big.  Learning is big.  So if they can learn  <br/>
from something and they&#39;re interested in it, that&#39;s a &quot;yes&quot; for me,  <br/>
barring illegality or total unavailability or impossibility.  And  <br/>
even if we can&#39;t get a thing or be in a place, we can read about it  <br/>
and focus on it a while by websearch and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At some houses, all-natural foods are in the top three, or religious  <br/>
observance.  And so they decide what their lives will revolve around,  <br/>
and the fit other things in around that.<br/>
<br/>
Some families&#39; lives revolve around Rudolf Steiner.  He was kind of a  <br/>
mystic and kind of a racist goof from what I&#39;ve read.  But those are  <br/>
two aspects of him.  There were others.   Many religions are built on  <br/>
people who were one or both of mystics or racist goofs.<br/>

The real world that I live in is filled with brand names and machine made goods. I&#39;ve only once ridden in a hand built car and that was a kit car. I don&#39;t know that hand made = the real world. It should equal way more expensive. Maybe all this is just a way to get people to buy more expensive stuff so that they can move up in social status within whatever Waldorf based educational hierarchy they want to live in. But that isn&#39;t about the toys or the children, that&#39;s about the parents. <br/>

I&#39;d rather playskool. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a point . Before people had microscopes and germs &quot;didn&#39;t  <br/>
exist,&quot; wooden and woolen toys were all peachy.  But now that we know  <br/>
about bacteria, maybe washable materials are the way to go,  <br/>
especially with babies who suck and chew stuff.  Especially with  <br/>
babies who are bottle fed, and glass bottles with rubber nipples are  <br/>
NOT the way to go with babies anymore.  Maybe glass when they&#39;re too  <br/>
young to hold their own.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something gross.  We hear all the time about the high death  <br/>
rate among infants in centuries past.  In the 17th-18th centuries  <br/>
(and maybe before, I don&#39;t know) there were a couple of nasty  <br/>
contraptions used to feed babies.  One was a horn, mounted in a crib,  <br/>
with a pig&#39;s teat fastened onto it, and they would put cow&#39;s  milk in  <br/>
the horn and the baby could suck while lying down.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t make that up.  A cow&#39;s horn with a pig&#39;s teat stuck on it,  <br/>
for real.<br/>
<br/>
And there were feeding cans.  They were made of lead, and they used  <br/>
to set them on the raised hearth or somewhere where toddlers could go  <br/>
over and get some food on their own.  The spout led down to the  <br/>
bottom, like a tin watering can.  And they would put milk and oats  <br/>

it&#39;s lead.  And they didn&#39;t wash them out, according to what I read,  <br/>
they just put more in.  They&#39;d wash it out if it started to stink, I  <br/>
guess, but not after every meal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised anyone lived at all.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t universal, but there are existing specimens.  Maybe it was  <br/>
really rare.  And I wish I&#39;d kept the book.  Somewhere I have  <br/>
photocopies.  It was in a book about the history of breastfeeding  <br/>
(and much of it was, as Schuyler noted earlier, stories of NOT  <br/>
breastfeeding one&#39;s own children).<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there were feeding cans.  They were made of lead, and they used<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-447252706"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What do you think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Many of today&#39;s children do not value their toys because they have<br/>
so many of them. They go from toy to toy without spending time on any<br/>
one of them. They look to toys for amusement and distraction, not<br/>
imaginative inspiration.  Many parents do not realize this but, when it<br/>
comes to toys, less is more. Having too many toys, children find it<br/>
difficult to become attached to them. In many families, toys are given<br/>
all year round  purchased in supermarkets, pharmacies, zoos,<br/>
museums  so that toys are no longer as special as they once were. A<br/>
child who is given a toy at Christmas and whp knows that another one is<br/>
not coming until the next birthday will invest emotionally in that toy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have not found this to be true at all!  My younger daughter has lots<br/>
of toys.  Much more than her older sister ever had, partially because we<br/>
didn&#39;t have a lot of money when my oldest was little, and partly because<br/>
what we did have was handed down to little sister along with all the new<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux remembers EVERY toy she owns.  She must have a catalog in her<br/>
head.  I&#39;ve heard that argument before about having less is more.  I did<br/>
try that with the baby dolls for a while.  I put most of the dolls away<br/>
in a room and brought out essential stuff for one or two babies.  I<br/>
wanted to see if that idea was actually true.  Nope!  She likes to play<br/>
with them all.  She has her favorites for sure, but when I&#39;ve gone<br/>
through and gotten rid of toys to make room for new ones, every time, my<br/>
daughter knows exactly what has gone, even if she wasn&#39;t part of the<br/>
decision making process, more so when she was younger.  I wouldn&#39;t dare<br/>
get rid of stuff now without her permission, she will know and ask point<br/>
blank where things are.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux and I were watching a movie together and these people moved into<br/>
this huge house.  I commented about how cool it would be to have so much<br/>
room to explore and play and find places to hide.  Her comment?  She<br/>
thought it would be cool because she could have more room to have more<br/>
toys and more room to play with her toys.  For me it was simply about<br/>
the space to play in, for her it was more room for more toys.<br/>
<br/>
Less is more, may work for some kids, but it wouldn&#39;t fly with Margaux. <br/>
She lives large!  Sometimes I think it&#39;s because she has the same name<br/>
as a queen who lived pretty large and extravagent.  Not really, that&#39;s<br/>
just a running side joke in our family.  She would make a fine queen<br/>
though, she has all the qualities that royalty should possess.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure that I like the idea of emotionally investing in toys<br/>
either.  I think it&#39;s natural for kids to really cherish some toys.  I<br/>
also think if you have very few and are very emotionally invested in<br/>
them, if something happens to one of them, it&#39;s devasting, like death<br/>
for a child.  I kind of like the idea of abundance.  My sis-in-law<br/>
always went through her kids toys as they were growing up and got rid of<br/>
just about everything every year, and then they would buy new stuff to<br/>
meet the new demands of the kids.  There were a few times in those kid&#39;s<br/>
lives, when they literally had no toys to play with.  They certainly got<br/>
used to it, but I wonder sometimes how that must affect how they view<br/>
permanance in their lives.  Those kids didn&#39;t dare become emotionally<br/>
attatched to any of their toys!<br/>
<br/>
I love very much that my kids still play with stuff that I kept from<br/>
when I was a kid.  My favorite stuffed animal, was Margaux&#39;s favorite<br/>
for a long time.  She named it Curry because it was that kind of yellow.<br/>
Chamille has moved on from toys and now I give her some of my  treasured<br/>
clothing items from my own teen years, stuff that I will never wear<br/>
again, but kept because I couldn&#39;t bear to part from them.  I love<br/>
watching her dress them up in different ways, cut them, reassemble them<br/>
and reuse them.  None of these things are natural fibers,  even the<br/>
stuffed animals (some of the clothes are).  Yet here they are being used<br/>
by another generation.  There are even a few things that were my<br/>
mother&#39;s and my grandmother&#39;s.  Those things are natural materials, and<br/>
some of them are wearing out and have to be handled gentley.<br/>

-=-Wooden Cutting Boards Found Safer Than Plastic<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By JANE E. BRODY<br/>
Published: February 10, 1993<br/>
EVERY now and then a scientific finding flies in the face of  <br/>
conventional wisdom. And so it was with an accidental discovery by  <br/>
microbiologists at the University of Wisconsin&#39;s Food Research  <br/>
Institute that wooden cutting boards kill food-poisoning bacteria  <br/>
that survive very nicely on the plastic boards that have been widely  <br/>
promoted for years as safer than wood.<br/>
<br/>
The scientists, Dean O. Cliver and Nese O. Ak, stumbled upon the  <br/>
finding while seeking ways to decontaminate wooden boards and make  <br/>
them as &quot;safe&quot; as plastic. Much to their surprise, they found that  <br/>
when boards were purposely contaminated with organisms like  <br/>
Salmonella, Listeria and Escherichia coli that are common causes of  <br/>
food poisoning, 99.9 percent of the bacteria died off within three  <br/>
minutes on the wooden boards, while none died on the plastic ones.<br/>
<br/>
When contaminated boards were left unwashed overnight at room  <br/>
temperature, bacterial counts increased on the plastic, but none of  <br/>
the organisms could be recovered from the wooden boards the next  <br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
It had long been believed that disease-causing bacteria from raw  <br/>
foods like chicken would soak into a wooden board and be difficult to  <br/>
remove, even when washed; then when other foods, like salad  <br/>
ingredients, that are eaten raw are cut on the same board, the  <br/>
dangerous bacteria could be picked up by them and transferred alive  <br/>
to the consumer. Plastic was assumed to be safer because it is  <br/>
nonporous and contaminating organisms could be readily washed off. A  <br/>
Word for Safety<br/>
<br/>
Based on the new studies, Dr. Cliver said, &quot;Wood may be preferable in  <br/>
that small lapses in sanitary practices are not as dangerous on wood  <br/>
as on plastic.&quot; But he cautioned against being &quot;sloppy about safety&quot;  <br/>
and warned cooks to be sure to wash off cutting surfaces after  <br/>
cutting meat, chicken or fish, whether the surface used is wood or  <br/>
plastic.<br/>
<br/>
The researchers tested boards made from seven different species of  <br/>
trees and four types of plastic and found similar results: wood was  <br/>
safer than plastic, regardless of the materials used. Thus far,  <br/>
however, the researchers have been unable to isolate the agents in  <br/>
wood that make it so inhospitable to bacteria.--<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-259107612">I couldn&#39;t get to the update article without being a member, but  <br/>
here&#39;s the second link Mary sent:<br/>
<br/>
The Truth About Cutting Boards and Bacteria<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For an update, see Bacteria on Board.<br/>
<br/>
The Bac Story<br/>
In 1994, a research report was published that proved to be the  <br/>
opening salvo in a long battle over which material was more sanitary  <br/>
for cutting boards, wood or plastic. The researchers found that fewer  <br/>
bacteria could be recovered from wooden boards infected with live  <br/>
cultures than from plastic boards treated the same way. These results  <br/>
caused the researchers to question the prevailing view that plastic  <br/>
was more sanitary than wood; some have further interpreted the data  <br/>
to mean that wood is, in fact, a safer material for cutting boards.  <br/>
In a report that followed, researchers at a U.S. Department of  <br/>
Agriculture (USDA) lab concluded that beef bacteria on polyethylene  <br/>
and wooden cutting boards had statistically similar patterns of  <br/>
attachment and removal. Even so, the idea that wood is more sanitary  <br/>
than plastic persists and was recently reaffirmed in the food section  <br/>
of the New York Times.<br/>
<br/>
So What Is on Your Cutting Board?<br/>
We wanted to get our own perspective on the problem, so we asked four  <br/>
staff members to donate their used boards, two wooden and two  <br/>
plastic. We found very little bacteria growing on these boards when  <br/>
we sampled them, so we took the boards to a local lab to have them  <br/>
artificially inoculated with bacteria. The procedure worked as  <br/>
follows: A drop of the medium containing millions of bacteria was  <br/>
placed on the boards, the boards were left to sit for 40 minutes to  <br/>
allow for absorption of the bacteria, and an attempt was then made to  <br/>
remove the bacteria. In repeated tests, between 6.0 percent and 8.1  <br/>
percent of the bacteria were recovered from the plastic and between  <br/>
1.3 percent and 6.2 percent from the wood. Given that the number of  <br/>
bacteria recovered from each type of board was well into the hundreds  <br/>
of thousands, there was little to assure us that one material was  <br/>
much safer than the other.<br/>
<br/>
Soap and Water to the Rescue<br/>
Scrubbing the boards with hot soapy water was a different story. Once  <br/>
the contaminated boards had been cleaned, we recovered an average of  <br/>
0.00015 percent from the plastic and 0.00037 percent from the wood,  <br/>
or fewer than 100 bacteria from each board. In a related test, we  <br/>
were able to transfer bacteria from contaminated, unwashed boards  <br/>
made from both wood and plastic to petri dishes using potatoes and  <br/>
onions. But our most surprising discovery by far was that the  <br/>
bacteria could persist on unwashed boards of both types for up to 60  <br/>
hours!<br/>
<br/>
What, then, is the truth about cutting boards? Both plastic and  <br/>
wooden boards can hold on to bacteria for long periods of time. Both  <br/>
plastic and wooden boards allow for transference of bacteria to other  <br/>
foods. Luckily, we found that scrubbing with hot soapy water was an  <br/>
effective (though not perfect) way of cleaning both kinds of boards;  <br/>
the USDA also recommends the regular application of a solution of 1  <br/>
teaspoon bleach per quart of water. Simply put, maintenance, not  <br/>
material, provides the greatest margin of safety. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674543954">This article did make me think, so thank you for posting it. It made me feel really good that I let my kids decide what they want to play with. I have donated more cheap plastic toys to charity over then years than anything else. But I always let them buy cheap plastic toys if they were interested. It never lasted long and they came up with some pretty creative uses for them, sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
Their favorite toys have been the wooden building blocks, Lego and K&#39;nex. The Lego and K&#39;nex are plastic but there is nothing like them. <br/>
<br/>
What bothered me in the article is that I think choices should come from the child and not the parent. I also don&#39;t think that you can dictate creativity. The parent can help think of creative ideas or expose their child to creativity but it is the child&#39;s creativity that has to be respected, not the parents. <br/>
<br/>
My sons have always loved making forts in our house. I have a pile of old sheets and wooden clothes pins that they can use. The authors would probably love my use of old sheets and wooden clothes pins for creative play but it evolved from their ideas. I didn&#39;t buy the sheets and clothes pins and suggest that they make forts but was solving a problem. They had been using hand made quilts and heavy blankets that I didn&#39;t want covered with cat hair, and using ceramic treasures and other breakables to hold them down. They would also use the plastic toys they had been given but they hurt when the cats pull them down on your head! First we switched to an old sheet that I used for a drop cloth and then we started saving and collecting old sheets. The wooden clothespins make great clips to attach the sheets to furniture etc. We even put some hooks in the play room ceiling so they could hang sheets from them. <br/>
<br/>
I had looked into Waldorf but always felt that it tried to dictate creativity. My oldest had gone to a freestyle Montessori type school and that was what first introduced me to child led learning. We still use many of the Montessori inspired ideas to help organize the house. (art supplies in bins down low, cups and plates in a low cupboard and stools by the sink etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Although I didn&#39;t agree with most of the article, it made me think. I also love Saundra&#39;s discussions and points about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16213668">But it&#39;s not very sanitary. Ditto, wooden vs. plastic cutting board.<br/>
Saundra<br/>
<br/>
---------------<br/>
Actually, I read a study  that showed that wooden cutting boards are more sanitary because they have natural deterrents to germs. I am all for whatever needs the least washing and cleaning. <br/>
<br/>
I think that anything that increases our choice and freedom is more important than being &quot;natural&quot;. But I have found that many natural things increase our freedom. So I value them for increasing our freedom rather than for being natural. <br/>

My friend Ramona calls me that, with a &quot;u&quot; that isn&#39;t there.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Being as I am of West Texas parentage, it&#39;s more like &quot;Sayandra.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;m happy to know that wood isn&#39;t trying to kill me.  That&#39;s wonderful.<br/>

  If my child wants to do more connecting with the real world, a few of the many things Id suggest would be the latest movie, going by gamestop, or to get a pack of her newest fav Hananna Montana trading cards/stickers. <br/>

  I probably wouldnt say now outside and go play with a stick or a rock! <br/>

<br/>
In the 60&#39;s when &quot;natural&quot; was the way-in thing, I had my hair  <br/>
natural (luckily, long and straight and non-tangly), and my face  <br/>
natural (still, old  hippie face) and ate natural foods (sometimes- <br/>
not-always).<br/>
<br/>
I remember, though, reminding someone that if honey was natural and  <br/>
birds&#39; nests were natural, then people&#39;s houses were natural and  <br/>
things people made were natural things.  We were part of nature.<br/>
<br/>
It used to get them very confused, but then we&#39;d just smoke some more  <br/>
dope.  That was considered natural, in those days, to do.<br/>
<br/>
Those living really natural lives can hardly come and write about it  <br/>
on a computer, it seems to me.  Unless we consider computers to be  <br/>
natural (made by creatures native to this planet, out of parts and  <br/>
bits found on the planet...  like a bird&#39;s nest).<br/>
