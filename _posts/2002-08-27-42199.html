I know the lyrics and all the harmonies to just about every doo-wop and<br/>
surf <br/>
song that was ever on the radio, but I never wanted my boyfriend to beat <br/>
anyone else up, nor do I want to have tough-guy boyfriend who drive GTOs<br/>
and <br/>
motorcycles, nor do I want to just have a boyfriend and get married. <br/>
Nor, <br/>
when I was young, did I ever become that airheaded, violent character of<br/>
that style of music.  **<br/>
<br/>
OK, but do you wanna run out and see the new surfer girl movie?  (Blue<br/>
Crush)  It looks, from the promos, like it has gorgeous waves and<br/>
gorgeous girls in it.  I&#39;m not sure what kind of music is featured.<br/>
<br/>
There was also an Australian indie movie about a girl surfer called<br/>
Puberty Blues that I saw long ago.  I don&#39;t know if it is available on videos.<br/>

skateboarding, even though I&#39;ve never tried surfing and only skateboarded<br/>
when I was a teen.<br/>

<br/>
Although Puerto Penasco *is* only 4 hours away...<br/>
