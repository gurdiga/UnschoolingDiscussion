<div id="ygrps-yiv-837330385">One of you asked me to share my Chanukah story again. We&#39;ve told and<br/>
retold it in my household since the kids were small, and we&#39;ve also<br/>
turned it into a puppet theatre production.  So we&#39;ll tell it again<br/>
tomorrow night. Here goes:<br/>
                          ANOTHER CHANUKAH STORY<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time and space -- for a time without a space is like a nose<br/>
without a face -- at the far northern edge of the town, which was at the<br/>
far northern edge of the county, which was at the far northern end of<br/>
the country, at the far northern edge of the continent, at the far<br/>
northern end of the northernmost world, there lived a very poor family<br/>
consisting of a mother, a father, eight children (4 boys and 4 girls),<br/>
and an old cow.  In the cold, northern winters they didn&#39;t have much to<br/>
eat, or enough fuel for the fire to keep warm, and they couldn&#39;t afford<br/>
electricity.  Still, they were happy enough, and kept themselves happy<br/>
by singing together every evening.<br/>
<br/>
One cold and windy day in darkest December, the youngest daughter met an<br/>
old, shrivelled woman at the northern end of the town square.   The old<br/>
woman was wearing a tattered dark brown cloak that covered her whole<br/>
body and which she drew up over her head.  The old woman complained that<br/>
she had no place to stay and nothing to eat.  &quot;Come home with me,&quot; said<br/>
the girl, &quot;we don&#39;t have much, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll share what we have.<br/>
<br/>
And so they went home together.  The family welcomed the old woman, even<br/>
though there wasn&#39;t much in the pantry to eat.  (In fact, they were so<br/>
poor, they didn&#39;t even have a pantry.)  They had a bunch of potatoes<br/>
which had lots of black spots in them, so they cut out the black spots<br/>
and made potato pancakes.  They had a bag of wormy apples, so they cut<br/>
out the worms and made applesauce.  The old cow gave nothing but sour<br/>
milk, so with their potato pancakes and applesauce they had sour cream.<br/>
<br/>
It gets dark early in deep December and the house had no electricity, so<br/>
the father went to the candle box, but found only one small candle<br/>
left.  The father lit the last candle, and the family gathered around<br/>
the table to sing songs for the old woman, and also for themselves.<br/>
They music was beautiful, and somehow the light of the candle seemed<br/>
brighter as the family sang.  Soon, one by one, first the children, and<br/>
then the mother and father drifted off to sleep in the old family bed,<br/>
where they huddled together with the old cow to keep warm.  The old<br/>
woman slept in the old armchair by the table.<br/>
<br/>
The next day when they got up, they were all surprised to see that the<br/>
candle was still lit.  In the evening, they gathered together again to<br/>
eat their dinner of potato pancakes and applesauce and sour cream, and<br/>
to sing songs around the table.  And as the singing seemed to get more<br/>
and more beautiful, the old woman seemed less shrivelled.  And people<br/>
began to gather outside to hear the singing, their noses pressed against<br/>
the one small window.<br/>
<br/>
And so it went.  Every evening, the family ate their poor dinner of<br/>
potato pancakes and applesauce and sour cream, and sang around the<br/>
table, their faces and the one small candle still shining brightly.  And<br/>
the crowds around the window grew larger and larger.<br/>
<br/>
On the eighth day, there was a knock on the door.  It was Mayor Mayer<br/>
(the mayor of the town) who, having heard and liked the singing so much,<br/>
offered the family a job singing at city hall.  But at that, the old<br/>
woman stood up and took off her tattered cloak.  Underneath she was<br/>
wearing a robe made of gold.  She reached into her pocket and took out a<br/>
small crown of rich red rubies and placed it on the little girl&#39;s head,<br/>
and out of her cloak she brought a bale of fresh green grass for the old<br/>
cow.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was hungry and tired and you took me in,&quot; she said, &quot;and it gave you<br/>
such joy to do it.  I have a castle where any tired travellers, rich or<br/>
poor, can stop and have a meal and spend the night.  And since you have<br/>
been able to make the poorest fare seem like a feast, I want you to come<br/>
to my castle and take charge of the food, and the singing, and the<br/>
hospitality.  And bring the cow!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they did.  And to this day we celebrate the family which made a<br/>
feast out of the poorest fare of potato pancakes and applesauce, and the<br/>
cow who could only give sour milk, and the one small candle which stayed<br/>
lit for eight days by the light of their singing.<br/>
<br/>

I want to thank everyone who has responded so far to my Thanksgiving<br/>

South India.  The response has been great, and I have received about<br/>
$1500 so far towards a goal (by January 20th) of $5400.  Every little<br/>
bit helps!<br/>
