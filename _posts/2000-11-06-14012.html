<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I hope this doesn&#39;t come under spamming but the 
following is a letter the kidlets put together after reading e-mails over my 
shoulder and listening to me vent.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Lynda<br>If Ignorance Is Bliss Why Aren&#39;t More 
People Happy?</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">===========</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello, we are Derek, Kirk and Krystin and we are 
homeschoolers.&nbsp; We are Wiyot and live in Northern California.&nbsp; We were 
listening to our mom when she was talking about how people are always doing 
things for people in other countries and never realize that one of the poorest 
places in the world is right here in the U.S.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We asked her about this and, being unschoolers, she 
gave us one of those looks.&nbsp; So we headed to the library and then got on 
the net to do some research and we were really surprised at what we found!&nbsp; 
We decided to &quot;adopt&quot; the elderly living on the &quot;cold&quot; reservations.&nbsp; 
Winter is the worst time because only one out of every five hogans has any 
reliable source of heat.&nbsp; We decided to learn to crochet and make 
afghans.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We set a goal of each of us getting one afghan done 
before Christmas.&nbsp; But, we got to thinking that wouldn&#39;t be very 
much.&nbsp; We put this letter together so that maybe other homeschoolers would 
join us in our project which we call &quot;Stop The Frostbite.&quot;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, since we think unschoolers and homeschoolers 
are the greatest people in the world, we thought some other kids might like to 
help.&nbsp; Mom says that folks who have to do portfolios can use this as 
history, current events, math (counting all those chains and crochets and 
working with patterns), art and community service.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">You can e-mail us at <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="mailto:lurine@...">lurine@...</a>.&nbsp; We will be 
putting together a big box to mail on December 15 and will try to do one every 
six weeks after that.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Respectfully,</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Your homeschooling friends</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Derek, Kirk and Krystin</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">P.S.&nbsp; If you have any coats, sweaters or 
blankets you might want to donate, our mom has addresses to send them 
to.</font></div></html></div>
