<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880740095">When you say meat, do you mean beef or does that include pork, lamb and<br/>
feathered and finned critters?  It could make a big diff in what could be<br/>
the reason.  You see, beef is &quot;aged&quot; and that can make a difference.  The<br/>
rest generally are not.  Also, lots of folks (well, enough to be note<br/>
worthy) are &quot;allergic&quot; in some degree to beef.  It is hard to digest and<br/>
you have no way of knowing if you are getting him&#39;s or her&#39;s and that also<br/>
can make a difference.  You don&#39;t get the large quantities of estrogen in<br/>
pork, lamb, etc. that you do in &quot;her&quot; beef.<br/>
<br/>
We ran cattle for years and had our own butcher shop for 14 years and I can<br/>
vouch for folks having problems with eating meats.  Usually, however, it is<br/>
not a true allergy but a problem with digestion.  Also, if you are getting<br/>
your meats from a place that cryovacs, you are getting meats that are high<br/>
in pvc type off-gassing residuals.  The way to get around that is to use a<br/>
traditional meat market that has what is called an open case (where they<br/>
have meat displayed and they reach in and grab what you want and then wrap<br/>
it in paper) and to ask your butcher if they &quot;break&quot; their own meats or if<br/>
they get it already &quot;broken down&quot; into sections in cryovac&#39;d bags.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155819107">This is interesting...I can see her points but she is speaking about<br/>
mild-response allergies...not the Alexandra type you have witnessed. Still<br/>
and all I thought that you would be interested in this info. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758943990">Hi Brooke,<br/>
 My DD had allergies to pork. But in doing some<br/>
investigating we found it was really the salt and<br/>
other preservatives used in curing the pork. If she<br/>
had too much dairy,salt of any kind,or citrus she had<br/>
an asthma attack. I would like to stress HAD these<br/>
problems because through a wonderful Homeopath she is<br/>
now free of these allergies! Although she will not eat<br/>
pig of any kind as she loves them and wishes she could<br/>
own one!<br/>
 So I would try to find out how is the meat your DD is<br/>
eating is preserved if at all and if it is not what is<br/>
she having with the meat at the same meal. The other<br/>
food might be the culprit.<br/>
 Of course this may well be the body  saying &quot;I want<br/>
to be a vegetarian&quot;! lol<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Jill<br/>
