food.<br/>
  Now my older one seems obsessed with doing things other kids can&#39;t.  Same <br/>
thing happened when he found out other kids had bedtimes.  He stopped going <br/>
to bed when he was sleepy and started watching the clock.  Anyone else have <br/>
this happen?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, this happens here a lot.  In fact, there are kids who do not come <br/>
over anymore, and I suspect that&#39;s the reason.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!  Liam still loves to go to bed when he gets sleepy, but he definitely <br/>
has changed his food habits around that issue.  I figure that I just have <br/>
to stay the way I am and *not* change; I need to be a solid rock for him in <br/>
the shifting sands.  Mostly, I must remember not to shame him or his <br/>
choices or his friends&#39; choices or his friends&#39; parents!  I see him <br/>
starting to move through it already; last night, his preference for a snack <br/>
was tofu rather than Skittles!<br/>
