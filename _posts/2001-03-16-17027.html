The Top Ten Answers We Should Give to the question<br/>
&quot;What? No School Today?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
10. Well normally yes, But this time of year I need <br/>
help with the planting and plowing. <br/>
<br/>
9. Goodness, no!!! I graduated 18 years ago!! But <br/>
thanks for the compliment! <br/>
<br/>
8. No, we homeschool. We&#39;re just out to pick up a bag <br/>
of pork rinds and some Mt. Dew, then we gotta hurry <br/>
home to catch our soaps. <br/>
<br/>
7. What?!?! Where did you guys come from?! I thought I<br/>
<br/>
told you to stay at school!! This happens all the <br/>
time. <br/>
<br/>
6. There isn&#39;t? Why you&#39;d think we&#39;d see more kids out<br/>
<br/>
then, don&#39;t you? <br/>
<br/>
5. We&#39;re on a field trip studying human nature&#39;s <br/>
intrusive and assumptive tactics of displaying <br/>
ignorance and implied superiority. Thanks for the <br/>
peek! <br/>
<br/>
4. On our planet we have different methods of <br/>
education. (Shhh!!No, I didn&#39;t give it away..keep your<br/>
<br/>
antennae down!) <br/>
<br/>
3. Oh my goodness!! I thought that today was <br/>
Saturday!! Come on kids, hurry! <br/>
<br/>
2. Nope........Me &#39;n Bubba jes&#39;learns &#39;em at home. <br/>
Werks real good! <br/>
<br/>
And the Number One answer we should NEVER give to the <br/>
question: &quot;What No school today?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
1. &quot;What No bingo today?&quot; &quot; <br/>
