<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101029989">&lt;&lt;think out of the box so to speak&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here is what we did with my husband who was concerned that unschooling<br/>
wouldn&#39;t meet the kids&#39; needs.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him to closely watch the little guys, then both 1yo, all day to see<br/>
what they naturally choose to engage in.  Then I asked him to keep track of<br/>
what they could possibly be learning from what they were doing (playing with<br/>
television became cause and effect, listening to different<br/>
languages--banging on piano became climbing &lt;to get on bench&gt;, cause and<br/>
effect, learning rhythms and sounds--playing on pool table became rolling<br/>
balls).<br/>
<br/>
Last step was to take the things they were learning and put them into<br/>
educational language (cause and effect became science, listening to<br/>
different languages became social studies, climbing became PE, rhythms and<br/>
sounds became orchestra, rolling balls became physics).  If a couple of<br/>
1yo&#39;s were studying science, physics, social studies all on their own with<br/>
no help from an adult, what in the world would a 15 yo be able to do?<br/>
<br/>
I suggest perhaps something like that with your own kids, to help you look<br/>
at the world differently.<br/>

<br/>
This is a great idea, and could be used with any age kids for anyone who is <br/>
uncomfortable with the concept of unschooling.<br/>
