<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852258138">The Scouts are endangering their very future, and hugely.  If they <br/>
discriminated against people by anything else biological (size, race, hair <br/>
color) they would stand to be in gigantic trouble.  Gender is not a black and <br/>
white issue, and if/when that is proven scientifically to the satisfaction of <br/>
every goob on the street the scouts will be just as embarrassed (legally if <br/>
not personally) as if they had said leaders or Eagle Scouts had to be under <br/>
6&#39;5&quot; or all right handed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind being flamed.  Go ahead.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been keeping up on the decisions as they unfolded, but if ANY of <br/>
this is based on Biblical strictures against homosexuality, I feel compelled <br/>
to point out that there are probably ten times as many Biblical strictures <br/>
against usury (charging interest) and I seriously doubt the Boy Scouts are <br/>
discriminating against bankers or loan officers.  <br/>
<br/>
As to public buildings, though, they are FREQUENTLY used by all kinds of <br/>
private groups, and weddings, and parties, and during the time that group <br/>
contracts to use the building, they can enforce their own group&#39;s rules <br/>
(which keeps weddings from being open to all passersby, etc.).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538995821">O.K., I am going to put on my flame proof suit and climb into my retro-50&#39;s<br/>
bomb shelter and then I am going to respond to this.  First, before the<br/>
flames throwers are pulled out and used, let me say, I don&#39;t believe in<br/>
their policies, however, I do believe in their right to have any policy<br/>
they choose.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t for the life of me understand the mentality that wants to join<br/>
something that doesn&#39;t want them.  This isn&#39;t the same as denying something<br/>
that someone needs or requires.  I think people have a right to associate<br/>
with whomever they choose when it is not funded by taxpayers dollars.<br/>
<br/>
If the scouts don&#39;t want &quot;x&quot; folks in their &quot;club,&quot; then &quot;x&quot; folks should<br/>
just go and start their own group.  And, it isn&#39;t just about the<br/>
orientation thing either.  I think it was absolutely ridiculous for the<br/>
parents of that girl to sue because she wanted to be a BOY scout.  I think<br/>
it is absolutely ridiculous for women to want to join men&#39;s clubs and I<br/>
think the reverse is true also.  This sue, sue, sue garbage is out of<br/>
control.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are times when &quot;civil rights&quot; issues should be addressed and<br/>
there should be some equal access issues addressed but I really think there<br/>
are more important things in life that needed to be addressed than who gets<br/>
to join private clubs.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, what&#39;s next, is someone going to sue an individual family because<br/>
the one family won&#39;t let their kids play with the other family&#39;s kids?   I<br/>
don&#39;t think this is any different than those nutcake newagers who say they<br/>
have a right to our ndn religions and traditions!  They aren&#39;t wanted and<br/>
if they choose to sue, then we will fold up shop and go underground!<br/>
<br/>
As to the private vs. public in the solicitation of funding, why not?  No<br/>
one is forced to donate, that is a personal choice.  As to the use of<br/>
&quot;public&quot; buildings, well if the KKK can use them and have then the same<br/>
principle that their use was based on would apply to the scouts, they pay<br/>
taxes, they have a right to use what their tax dollars have paid for.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who will quit rambling now as I am sure that this was all clear as<br/>
mud &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;  This sue, sue, sue garbage is out of control. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree entirely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I really think there<br/>
are more important things in life that needed to be addressed than who gets<br/>
to join private clubs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been involved in a private (not secret, not very exclusive) club for <br/>
over 20 years and anyone who wants to play by the rules is welcome to join.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As to the private vs. public in the solicitation of funding, why not?  No<br/>
one is forced to donate, that is a personal choice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because asking for PUBLIC funding, for tax dollars, means then that <br/>
organization has to follow federal use rules.  Things may change with the <br/>
whole charter school thing.  Some kinds of discrimination are illegal.  More <br/>
kinds will eventually be.  It used to be okay to discriminate against blacks, <br/>
Chinese, women of ANY color/heritage.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that someday it will be illegal to discriminate against <br/>
homosexuals, because I believe (from having read research reports and <br/>
articles on human development) that homosexuality is NOT &quot;a choice&quot; or &quot;a <br/>
lifestyle&quot; or &quot;a sin,&quot; but is as natural as curly hair or long toes or a nice <br/>
singing voice.<br/>
<br/>
In the 1960s in a town I lived in Explorers were the BIG thing--it seemed <br/>
that hardly a boy grew to be 16 with being an Eagle Scout, and then they went <br/>
on to Explorers.  The big group hobby was canoeing, water safety, river <br/>
rescue, etc.  Every summer a big group went to the big Boy Scout camp in <br/>
Cimarron.  Every summer a group went canoeing in Canada, for several weeks.  <br/>
It was like Outward Bound, but all the guys knew each other well.<br/>
<br/>
The leader and coordinator of all that was a man who was unmarried, yet who <br/>
was elected mayor, a business owner, a hard working well-trusted man.  He was <br/>
homosexual, but it didn&#39;t matter.  He was not a child molester.  He was a <br/>
man.  He was a man who volunteered a GREAT deal of time and energy so that <br/>
young people could travel and learn and also grow up to be good men.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that would be illegal.  Maybe it would have been then, had anyone <br/>
complained, but there was nothing to complain about.  Parents trusted him <br/>
with their teenaged boys.  They trusted him to be mayor.   They named a <br/>
community center after him while he was still alive.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not good for boy scouts anymore, I hear.<br/>
<br/>
Scouting has touched the lives of many boys who had no sexual desire because <br/>
they were eight years old.  Some of them grew up not being heterosexual.  Is <br/>
it better or worse if they dropped out of Scouts before becoming life scouts? <br/>
 Eagles?  is it better to allow someone who never was a boyscout to be a <br/>
leader now than someone who is an Eagle Scout but just doesn&#39;t have sex with <br/>
women?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so simple a problem as a group not wanting certain kinds of people.  <br/>
It&#39;s a group changing their policy after many gay men have participated, <br/>
&quot;graduated,&quot; and donated time and money.<br/>
<br/>
I was the one who said the anti-Christian thing, I guess, in asking whether <br/>
it was because of Bible references, and if so were they discriminating <br/>
against bankers and loan officers.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But it would be much more honest to consistently refer to self as a &quot;private<br/>
club&quot;   with all the connotations that go with the name.  With or without a<br/>
federal charter  BSA  is thought of as a public institution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;As to the private vs. public in the solicitation of funding, why not?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; one is forced to donate, that is a personal choice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is not really a personal choice when the Boy Scouts  are  allowed to use<br/>
government equipment and sites for free.    Or when  government funded<br/>
employees are used to provide &quot;training&quot;  or &quot;service opportunities&quot;.    Or<br/>
when tax funded events give out free tickets  to Boy Scouts (whether in<br/>
exchange for being &quot;ushers&quot;  or &quot;being color guard&quot;  or not.<br/>
<br/>
When a group makes a contract to use a public building for a wedding,  there<br/>
is usually a site use fee.    Although Boy Scouts may occasionally pay a<br/>
fee,   in many, many locales  they  either are given a very substantial<br/>
discount or even have free use.<br/>
<br/>
I find BSA  to be not only bigoted  but dishonest about their bigotry.     I<br/>
personally would have more respect if  they were &quot;upfront&quot;  that they were<br/>

<br/>
Let me be clearer.    Most pedophiles are heterosexual males.     There are<br/>
probably pedophiles in every organization  that caters to youth.    Having a<br/>
wife or even having a child within the troop  is not  an indicator of<br/>
either willingness or unwillingness to exploit children.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Catholic church,   the Boy Scouts have had to contend with leaders<br/>
who found victims within the ranks.     Excluding homosexuals does not<br/>
address the problem. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-469611517">O.K., let&#39;s clear something up first.  They do NOT get &quot;public funding, tax<br/>
dollars.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Financial resources for the local council (the local nonprofit corporation<br/>
chartered by the National Council) come from an annual Friends of Scouting<br/>
(FOS) campaign, local United Ways, foundation grants, special events,<br/>
project sales, investment income, trust funds, bequests, and gifts of real<br/>
and personal property.<br/>
<br/>
National Organization<br/>
<br/>
Funds to support the national organization of the Boy Scouts of America<br/>
come from registration fees, local council service fees, investment income,<br/>
Scouting and Boys&#39; Life magazines, sale of uniforms and equipment,<br/>
contributions from individuals, and foundation grants.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Soliciting from the public is not the same as getting public funded tax<br/>
dollars.  They don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
As to the current hoopla over who can and can&#39;t be a scout leader, there<br/>
had always been a don&#39;t ask don&#39;t tell type policy and there had been<br/>
trouble until someone wanted to push the envelope.  Actually, you said it<br/>
all about the organization you belong to, &quot;anyone who wants to play by the<br/>
rules is welcome to join.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, to whomever made the christian remark, BSA has chapters that aren&#39;t<br/>
christian.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Let me be clearer.    Most pedophiles are heterosexual males.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there&#39;s the issue of pedophilia.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the homophobia.  A completely different issue. <br/>
<br/>
The idea that a heterosexual boy (or girl) shouldn&#39;t be exposed to an openly <br/>
gay individual who is held up as a person to be respected.  That&#39;s another <br/>
argument.  And I can kind of see the logic.  If you want to role model for <br/>
boys (and girls) and you don&#39;t want those models to be openly gay but macho <br/>
and outdoorsy and woodsy and &quot;handy with tools and fishing rods&quot; kind of <br/>
guys, then you don&#39;t take them to the Gay Pride Parade.  I can see it as <br/>
parents making the choices for role models for their kids.<br/>
<br/>
The flaw in this set up, it seems to me, is that it assumes that all gay <br/>
people are out and blatant.  That all manly men (who like women and are <br/>
therefore good role models) are out there chopping down trees and the ones <br/>
who are interior decorators and a little too handy around the kitchen are <br/>
&quot;obviously&quot; the gay ones.  That ain&#39;t how the world is arranged tho.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how anyone will tell.  If a gay man is not openly gay and macho <br/>
enough, he passes.  If a straight man is a little feminine (heaven forbid!), <br/>
they are suspected.  And then what?  Kicked out.  &quot;Well, Bruce, we noticed <br/>
how neatly you keep your campsite, so you better get out.  We can&#39;t have the <br/>
boys growing up seeing a role model like that.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Nothing at all to do with pedophilia, it seems to me.  Just plain old <br/>
ignorance about how gay people act.  As if they all act one way and it is <br/>
obvious.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many gay members of the scouts are having a secret chuckle right <br/>
about now?<br/>
<br/>
And how many gay boys are being made even more uncomfortable about the <br/>
decision to come out.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this was actually a case when the &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; stand would <br/>
have been best.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe some principled stand on honoring all Scouts for the good they do in <br/>
the lives of children.  Even if their campsites are a little toooo neat.<br/>

<br/>
Nance, you&#39;re scaring me.  One of my best friends is tall and strong and <br/>
hairy, but you know, he IS really really handy in the kitchen, and he has <br/>
nice handwriting too.  He knows how to sew, with or without patterns.  But <br/>
worse:  MY HUSBAND.  He was a boyscout for a while, and can set up a camp in <br/>
the dark, and tie ALL kinds of knots, but you should see how neatly he keeps <br/>
his ropes, in little non-tangling bundles, by size, all in one bag.  He used <br/>
to be a theatre major.  He knows the words to lots of musicals and has a <br/>
great tenor voice and blonde hair down to his waist.  <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s all balanced by my friend Mark who&#39;s pretty blatantly gay to hear <br/>
him *talk* about it, but he wears jeans and leather jackets and boots and has <br/>
a really low voice and has to shave a lot, so maybe he&#39;s NOT gay.  Maybe my <br/>
husband has been fooling me for 23 years.<br/>
<br/>
We have two 14 year old boys spending the night tonight.  Maybe I should take <br/>
them home; my husband will be arriving from Minneapolis within the hour.<br/>
<br/>
Good point (whoever made it) about other offenses--a policy like this will <br/>
allow married, closeted or unaware homosexuals, and will allow those willing <br/>
to be deceptive or secretive, and will ban those who are aware and honest.  I <br/>
doubt if they check to make sure none of the leaders have ever committed <br/>
adultry, but that&#39;s right there in the top ten.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well...<br/>
<br/>
It will change.<br/>
Then it will change back.<br/>
And we&#39;ll all die, eventually.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Boy Scout code, oath and law all clearly state that the participant is <br/>
&#39;morally straight&#39;.  Morally straight is not a reference to sexual <br/>
orientation.  It is a commitment by the leader or Scout to maintain a <br/>
standard of sexual purity.  That includes avoiding things like pornography <br/>
and sexual acts outside of marriage.  <br/>
<br/>
As for &#39;graduating&#39; and then having the group change policy.  That is simply <br/>
false.  The policy was &#39;morally straight&#39; all along.  It has not changed.  <br/>
This is not a new emphasis.  I reiterate, every candidate knew what the <br/>
standards were when they applied for leadership or membership standards.  If <br/>
they didn&#39;t, it was not the fault of the Boy Scout organization.<br/>
<br/>
No one has been denied any accolades due to policy changes.  Whether <br/>
homosexuality is a choice or not, a decision was made at some point to act on <br/>
those impulses/desires/urges.  That decision to act is what brings the person <br/>
outside of the &#39;morally straight&#39; boundaries to which they have agreed.  <br/>
Therefore, their rank, advancements and standing in the Scout community <br/>
should be taken away.  If they did not want to abide by the Scout Law, they <br/>
should not have joined.<br/>

&gt;  those who  have or will identify as homosexual.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BSA has been up front about their standards from the beginning.  There has <br/>
not been a change in policy.  This is not new.  The only thing new is men who <br/>
try to insist they can go against the code to which they agreed and force BSA <br/>
to allow continued participation in the BSA.<br/>
<br/>
As for focusing efforts to exclude pedophiles, BSA goes to great lengths to <br/>
keep such criminals out of their ranks.  Every leader is subject to back <br/>
ground checks and is required to sign statements that they understand and <br/>
agree to uphold the BSA standards.  <br/>
<br/>
Every boy is required to review a pamphlet directly addressing abuse, <br/>
including sexual abuse.  In order to achieve any Scout advancement the boy is <br/>
required to review a booklet addressing this very topic with his parents.  <br/>
The boy and his parents are both required to participate in this and sign <br/>
accordingly.  This booklet is included in every scout book, in front, right <br/>
behind the cover.  In order to look at any of the rest of the book, you have <br/>
to get past this very substantial booklet.  There is no way to miss it.<br/>
<br/>
Scout leaders have ongoing training directed at avoiding problems with abuse <br/>
of any sort.  Leaders are required to NEVER be alone with a boy.  All scout <br/>
activities are to include at least 2 adults.  Boys are to work in teams to <br/>
accomplish their rank advancement and merit badge activities.  This is for <br/>
the safety of the leader, the boy and BSA&#39;s liability.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone that has been actively involved in Boy Scouts or has spent any time <br/>
checking out the organization or the requirements for Scouting would know <br/>
these steps are taken.  This is not a new thing.  The above requirements have <br/>
been in place for at least 20 years.  I&#39;ll bet even longer, but can&#39;t vouch <br/>
for that personally because I&#39;ve only been involved in Scouts directly for 20 <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t believe me?  Go to your local Scout office and check it out.  I <br/>
recommend doing some research for yourself, rather than listening to rumors <br/>
or jumping to conclusions.<br/>

Yes,  I am familiar with the booklet.   Actually I even &quot;remember&quot;   seeing<br/>
it in a &quot;new&quot; &quot;revised&quot;  handbook and reading publications concerning its<br/>
development and mandatory inclusion  (not supposed to scissor it out even if<br/>
in a community expressing objections to such information being given to<br/>
young children outside the family home).    Did not realize it was 20 years<br/>
ago but I suppose that is possible.   Time certainly does fly, doesn&#39;t it.<br/>
<br/>
As for checking with a local scout office,  well it seems that there is<br/>
&quot;some&quot;  infighting whereas certain regions and locales have/are adopting<br/>
their own policies sometimes not  in agreement with policies from the<br/>
national<br/>
headquarters.   Sometimes quietly, sometimes not.     Sometimes being<br/>
slapped down by national office, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll leave in-depth research to others but  I fail to see how reading briefs<br/>
presented by both sides in a court case  or reading signed policy statements<br/>
from officers within the organization falls under the heading &quot;listening to<br/>
rumors&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
    Several regional United Ways around the country have declined to support <br/>
their local Boy Scout Councils because of their stance on gays in leadership <br/>
positions. In our area of Houston, word has gotten out among the scouts about <br/>
this.<br/>
    Now we the &quot;heterosexual parents&quot; have declined to donate to the United <br/>
Way. My company, which has several thousand employees, has seen this years <br/>
United Way drive results reduced to 85% participation. That is down from <br/>
100%. What a pity this is. Word has it that many of the former U.W. <br/>
supporters have declined because of the Scout issue.<br/>
    The supporters of inclusion are allowed to have their beliefs. We are <br/>
also allowed to have our beliefs, but are chastised and ridiculed for them.<br/>
    Parents who want gays as role models for their children should start <br/>
their own version of the Scouts, just as the vast majority of us currently in <br/>
Scouting were ready to do if the supreme court had sided against the Scouts <br/>
on this issue.<br/>
    And if the United Way thinks that they will change our moral stance by <br/>
withdrawing financial support from the Scouts, they should remember that most <br/>
of their money is donated by middle income heterosexual PARENTS. Some support <br/>
the gays, most do not.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THIS heterosexual parent donates to the United Way BECAUSE they don&#39;t support the<br/>
Scouts on this issue.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s put aside the fact that the founder of the Boy Scouts was gay himself, and<br/>
that there have been gay scouts since its inception, and still are. The issue is<br/>
also not that a private club excludes or does not exclude based on sexual<br/>
orientation.  In this, the Boy Scouts are no different than a gay-only club or<br/>
bar.  The issue is whether they can use public accommodations in doing so --<br/>
public schools, public parks, etc. -- which are paid for with funds collected<br/>
from the entire community, including people who happen to be gay.  I am not<br/>
permitted to not pay my taxes to support the use of these public accommodations<br/>
by groups which practice exclusion.  So the only fair solution is deny access to<br/>
those who practice exclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I work for a public agency.  Gay-only bars and clubs cannot solicit<br/>
for funds through the United Way in my agency because they practice exclusion.<br/>
So it would be a double standard to allow the Boy Scouts to do so.  The United<br/>
Way does not attempt to change my moral stance or that of anyone else.  I can<br/>
support the Boy Scouts or the gay bar if I wish, with my own funds and efforts.<br/>
I just shouldn&#39;t be forced to do so through my taxes or through an organization<br/>
that works through my public agency.<br/>
<br/>
I have lived long enough to remember a time, in my northern city, when Italians<br/>
couldn&#39;t get public sector jobs.  I went to a college (and this is in the 60s!)<br/>
which still had a Jewish quota. I grew up seeing little girls get punched and<br/>
kicked because they drank from water fountains labeled &quot;whites only&quot; (meaning<br/>
&quot;pinky gray&quot;), and they were &quot;coffee colored&quot;. I&#39;ve grown up, and my community<br/>
has grown up too. If Boy Scouts want to have their little exclusionary clubs,<br/>
that really is okay with me -- just don&#39;t do it on my dollar.<br/>
