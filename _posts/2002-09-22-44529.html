<br/>
&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;feeding 4 curious minds at once.....Do lots of you unschool more than<br/>
2-3?&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have three, within five and a half years of age.  One day I was reading <br/>
here about someone with three kids, infant, toddler and five year old, and I <br/>
thought, &quot;WOW!  How hard that must be!&quot; and then I remembered, &quot;HEY, I did <br/>
that!&quot;   The memory fades.  &lt;g&gt;  Mine are 10, 13 and 16 now.<br/>
<br/>
But I have found that learning often goes faster and easier when there are <br/>
more kids around interacting than when it&#39;s just my three.   For one thing, <br/>
the same old toys and games are played in a new light with other kids.  Some <br/>
games need more than two or three kids.  Some yard activites (basketball, <br/>
playing on the swings) are more fun with more kids.  Other kids have other <br/>
answers to questions, have other experiences and ideas.<br/>
