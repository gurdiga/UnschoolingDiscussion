<div id="ygrps-yiv-646248183">My 15.5 yo is thinking about taking some college classes.  I was wondering if there&#39;s been any discussion regarding the pros and cons of our just saying he has graduated from home school or if it would be preferable for some reason for him to take the GED.  He&#39;s taken practice GED&#39;s online without any problem.  Any ideas?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1636671794">Does he need a GED or diploma just to take classes where you are?  I think he <br/>
could just go and pick and choose the classes he wants, not as a <br/>
degree-seeking student, and see if he likes it.  My son did that at 14 at the community <br/>
college.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think most homeschoolers who start college young do it the <br/>
traditional way, with the test and the diploma, etc.  They dabble first.  My experience, <br/>
anyway.<br/>

Might depend on what he wants to do.  If he wants to go into the <br/>
military he will have to meet their specifications.  If he wants to <br/>
go to college he will have to jump through their hoops.  Some are <br/>
very open and do not require any diploma, GED, or even SAT/ACT test <br/>
scores for desirable students.  Others are real snippity about all <br/>
these things.  Best that he get his goals together, researches his <br/>
options, so that he can meet the requirements that are appropriate <br/>
for what he wants to do.  It really will be up to him.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter (now 16) went to a summer college program this past <br/>
summer and fell in love with the college where this was held.  She <br/>
had attended various programs at several other colleges before this <br/>
one, but she now says that this is the one where she wants to go to <br/>
college.  They were great, a very liberal liberal arts college, <br/>
listed in The Fiske Guide To Getting Into The Right College as one of <br/>
the &quot;Top Nonconformist Colleges.&quot;  It was a perfect fit for her.  <br/>
They asked for a transcript, references from teachers and counselors, <br/>
and SAT/ACT scores.  I made a nice homemade transcript, and told them <br/>
that I did not believe in SAT/ACT testing and explained why.  Then I <br/>
told them I would write references, as her teacher and counselor, if <br/>
they wanted, but since I was all of the above, they might be a bit <br/>
redundant.  I suggested I could get references from others, like her <br/>
skating coach, or her mentors in various volunteer programs in which <br/>
she has participated.  But they were satisfied, it seems with what I <br/>
sent, and not only accepted her, but offered her a full scholarship.  <br/>
<br/>
My advice is that he begin to clarify his goals.  Then it will be <br/>
easier to see what it will take to meet those goals.  Of course if he <br/>
is not ready for this, then it may take a while longer, perhaps years.<br/>
And there are so many options out there now that even college can be <br/>
done from home, getting a fully accredited four-year degree for less <br/>
than $700 to no more than $5000, depending on what route the student <br/>
chooses.  It&#39;s his life.  I am sure he will figure it out.<br/>
