<br/>
I agree Carol... If Zak has snatched a train from another child, we ask him <br/>
how would be feel if someone did that to him.  He usually comes up with &quot;sad, <br/>
mad, hurt&quot;  Then we ask him how does he think the other person feels right <br/>
now about Zak&#39;s actions.  Again he comes up with a feeling.  I ask him if <br/>
there is anything he wants to do about the situation.. .Sometimes he says <br/>
sorry, sometimes he gives the item back, sometimes he says he needs time <br/>
alone in his room... It seems to depend on his mood and whose involved.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad (god rest his soul) was a terrible womanizer, gambler, and completely <br/>
self-centered and he was always saying sorry to my mum... My mum says &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
easy to say sorry when you&#39;ve done what you want&quot;  and I happen to agree with <br/>
that and it makes apologies seem very insincere.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t agree with you more. Feeling sorry, is after all, just that, a<br/>
feeling. You can&#39;t (imo) make someone feel something. We also try to<br/>
encourage the recipient of the apology to say &quot;I forgive You&quot;. Again, we<br/>
don&#39;t force it, but it can give nice closure to the situation.<br/>

&gt; I loved what you wrote about honesty,  Beverley.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One thing that I have trouble with is apologies. When one of the kids has<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; something that has hurt another, I talk to them about it, but don&#39;t &#39;make&#39;<br/>
&gt; them apologise. But so many others, dh included, demand apologies be made.<br/>
My<br/>
&gt; way is to talk to the kid about what has happenned, listen to his story,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; if he *is* sorry for what he has done, encourage him to apologise - and<br/>
&gt; sometimes that means me going along too to hold a hand - apologising is<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; easy. I don&#39;t &#39;make&#39; the other accept the apology either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel it is bad enough that some one has been hurt, without dishonest,<br/>
false<br/>
&gt; apologies rubbing salt into the wound. And if someone is feeling so hurt<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t accept the apology, then that is part of the consequences of one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; actions too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This attitude has not been popular with others though - esp. other  who<br/>
demand<br/>
&gt; apologies, however insincere the apology might be! Personally, I think<br/>
such<br/>
&gt; demands spring more from a wish to humiliate the &#39;hurter&#39;, rather than a<br/>
wish<br/>
&gt; to mollify the &#39;hurtee&#39;.<br/>

<br/>
it&#39;s never too late to start anything and you don&#39;t have to have formal <br/>
education to write and get something published.  Look at J.K. Rowling, a <br/>
single mother, who typed her first Harry Potter on a typewriter and because <br/>
she couldn&#39;t afford to photocopy it, typed it out again!!!!  This is a woman <br/>
that it&#39;s estimated will make 40 million dollars this year.... no formal <br/>
education...  I started writing (without a degree in journalism) for some on <br/>
line magazines and then for a local newspaper.  Not once did they ask me <br/>
about my journalistic accomplishments.  Thank god for spell check is all I <br/>
can say... I also spend time doing some public speaking now and have no <br/>
&quot;official&quot; background for that.  Start small and then it will take off if <br/>
it&#39;s meant too... I would encourage you to go after your dreams while you are <br/>
young enough to benefit from the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember (you may not) all those years ago when the Open University <br/>
first started in England?  I remember hearing about a woman who was going to <br/>
be 78 years old, who&#39;d just finished University and gained her degree... What <br/>
an accomplishment for her.  As they say in American... &quot;you go girl&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460631639">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i agree w/ the position on &#39;empty/meaningless&#39; apologies.  it&#39;s silly, <br/>
superficial and imo ultimately fosters manipulation, particularly <br/>
emotional manipulation.  this morning my dh and i were discussing <br/>
books like huxley&#39;s &#39;brave new world&#39; and orwell&#39;s &#39;1984&#39;  and movies <br/>
like mad max.  though i&#39;ve not really read these books or really <br/>
watched these movies (eeks! - too dark and mean for me to get all the <br/>
way through) it is my impression that these &#39;versions&#39; of the future <br/>
have one definite thing in common (maybe more) which is a  complete <br/>
lack of empathy and compassion for both the individual characters <br/>
themselves and anyone or anything else. i feel that a society&#39;s true <br/>
value rests w/ it&#39;s ability to be generous of spirit.  so imo empathy <br/>
and compassion are critical skill to develop be it in a child or an <br/>
adult.<br/>
<br/>
so i looked up honesty particularly it&#39;s etymology  which is according <br/>
to my dictionary (i know it&#39;s not the best but it does give me a <br/>
starting point - hopefully i will soon be able to buy one of those <br/>
cool ones printed on onion skin paper and comes w/ a magnifying <br/>
glass:) honesty comes from honor: n.[me. honour&lt; ofr.&lt;l. honor, honos, <br/>
official dignity, repute, esteem]-  official implies authority, <br/>
dignity - worth, merit, befitting; repute - to think again, esteem- to <br/>
value, appraise.<br/>
<br/>
how would this concept of honesty- the one which forms when thinking <br/>
of these attribute - be translated into raising a child?  i personally <br/>
would like my son to embody an authority over himself, to value both <br/>
himself and others w/out judgment, to reconsider his actions i.e just <br/>
because he can doesn&#39;t mean he should.  to ultimately internalize a <br/>
blanket of empathy and compassion via thought and reflection for <br/>
everything from himself to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
my next thought would be how does this natural show itself?  when he <br/>
shares his things, thoughts, feels - parts of himself w/ others.  when <br/>
he recognizes the same in another - when he recognizes when others are <br/>
sharing parts of themselves w/ him.  when does he not show this?  when <br/>
his ego steps in and is no longer a tool which can get him to do <br/>
something but becomes the goal - something which needs to be fed.  <br/>
when he must be smarter, faster, better - winner at whatever.  when he <br/>
acts w/out regard for another be it a person, animal, plant, <br/>
environment....<br/>
<br/>
honesty is a core human trait and  i believe is innate in all people <br/>
yet extremely fragile.  it is my opinion that all things are possible <br/>
and we as parents can enhance or diminish (or push  to the back burner <br/>
so to speak:) any trait in our children be it done consciously or <br/>
unconsciously.  i guess i believe in the socratic view of vigilant <br/>
questioning of oneself and ones actions and believe that to be truly <br/>
honest you needs to actively question everything but particularly <br/>
oneself.<br/>

here.&quot; And reiterate why I didn&#39;t want him to do it. He sort of pondered that <br/>
and seemed to think it made sense.<br/>
<br/>
But he still wanted to do it.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] homesty (was discipline)<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 5 Jul 2000 12:07:21 -0500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i agree w/ the position on &#39;empty/meaningless&#39; apologies.  it&#39;s silly,<br/>
&gt;superficial and imo ultimately fosters manipulation, particularly<br/>
&gt;emotional manipulation.  this morning my dh and i were discussing<br/>
&gt;books like huxley&#39;s &#39;brave new world&#39; and orwell&#39;s &#39;1984&#39;  and movies<br/>
&gt;like mad max.  though i&#39;ve not really read these books or really<br/>
&gt;watched these movies (eeks! - too dark and mean for me to get all the<br/>
&gt;way through) it is my impression that these &#39;versions&#39; of the future<br/>
&gt;have one definite thing in common (maybe more) which is a  complete<br/>
&gt;lack of empathy and compassion for both the individual characters<br/>
&gt;themselves and anyone or anything else. i feel that a society&#39;s true<br/>
&gt;value rests w/ it&#39;s ability to be generous of spirit.  so imo empathy<br/>
&gt;and compassion are critical skill to develop be it in a child or an<br/>
&gt;adult.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;so i looked up honesty particularly it&#39;s etymology  which is according<br/>
&gt;to my dictionary (i know it&#39;s not the best but it does give me a<br/>
&gt;starting point - hopefully i will soon be able to buy one of those<br/>
&gt;cool ones printed on onion skin paper and comes w/ a magnifying<br/>
&gt;glass:) honesty comes from honor: n.[me. honour&lt; ofr.&lt;l. honor, honos,<br/>
&gt;official dignity, repute, esteem]-  official implies authority,<br/>
&gt;dignity - worth, merit, befitting; repute - to think again, esteem- to<br/>
&gt;value, appraise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;how would this concept of honesty- the one which forms when thinking<br/>
&gt;of these attribute - be translated into raising a child?  i personally<br/>
&gt;would like my son to embody an authority over himself, to value both<br/>
&gt;himself and others w/out judgment, to reconsider his actions i.e just<br/>
&gt;because he can doesn&#39;t mean he should.  to ultimately internalize a<br/>
&gt;blanket of empathy and compassion via thought and reflection for<br/>
&gt;everything from himself to the environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;my next thought would be how does this natural show itself?  when he<br/>
&gt;shares his things, thoughts, feels - parts of himself w/ others.  when<br/>
&gt;he recognizes the same in another - when he recognizes when others are<br/>
&gt;sharing parts of themselves w/ him.  when does he not show this?  when<br/>
&gt;his ego steps in and is no longer a tool which can get him to do<br/>
&gt;something but becomes the goal - something which needs to be fed.<br/>
&gt;when he must be smarter, faster, better - winner at whatever.  when he<br/>
&gt;acts w/out regard for another be it a person, animal, plant,<br/>
&gt;environment....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;honesty is a core human trait and  i believe is innate in all people<br/>
&gt;yet extremely fragile.  it is my opinion that all things are possible<br/>
&gt;and we as parents can enhance or diminish (or push  to the back burner<br/>
&gt;so to speak:) any trait in our children be it done consciously or<br/>
&gt;unconsciously.  i guess i believe in the socratic view of vigilant<br/>
&gt;questioning of oneself and ones actions and believe that to be truly<br/>
&gt;honest you needs to actively question everything but particularly<br/>
&gt;oneself.<br/>

word, isn&#39;t it? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
when <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;he recognizes the same in another - when he recognizes when others are <br/>

&gt;environment....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see what you are saying, but am a little worried about what I perceive to<br/>
be a negative in the ego comment - having become a survivor in life because<br/>
of ego. My ego construct protected me. It isn&#39;t the best.. construct to<br/>
have, but it was a natural survival tool, born from necessity. I am<br/>
repairing the damage as an aware, conscious thinking reflective adult. I<br/>
think I prefer a model of child (and inner child) raising that treats the<br/>
ego as a healthy partner.<br/>
<br/>
Winning, smarter, faster, etc isn&#39;t necessarily an undesirable state,<br/>
although competition is corrupted - the empathy, understanding and<br/>
compassion is stripped from the competitive act in social settings.... many<br/>
competitors compete against self. It is usually the audience that does the<br/>
corrupting, I feel...<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the doing is so much more important than the goal, but in<br/>
effect what we are showing are children is that the doing is the goal,<br/>
rather than some long term point in time or object...<br/>
<br/>
Cooperation and compromise go with empathy and compassion.<br/>
<br/>
Honesty is core of all of these.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058795686">Okay, normally I can ignore typos but I had to change the subject line on<br/>
this one.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just my warped mind, or did anyone else keep opening these messages<br/>
thinking that they would contain discussions about really messy houses? I<br/>
thought homesty was a clever word. Obviously derived from pigsty and perhaps<br/>
peoplesty would be technically more accurate, but homesty just had a good<br/>
sound to it. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if I mislead you into reading this message and thinking I had<br/>
something to contribute about honesty.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;how would be feel if someone did that to him.

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what about my hyperactive son?  How do I handle that when it comes to appropriate behavior?  The above scenairo just does not work with him.  Here is an example:<br/>
<br/>
Thomas snatches a toy away from another child and the child begins to cry.<br/>
&quot;Thomas, that was not a very nice thing to do.  Look how sad (so-and-so) is.  They would like to finish their turn with that toy&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;NO!  GO AWAY!!!!&quot;  Shouts Thomas<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please don&#39;t yell at me, Thomas.  You&#39;re not being very nice to us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!&quot;  and either runs away, or falls onto the toy on the floor, protecting it with his body.<br/>
Mother sighs deeply, other child&#39;s parents are annoyed, other child still crying...etc.....<br/>
<br/>
He is exceptionally stubborn, spirited and hyperactive.  HE screams and kicks for all he&#39;s worth when he needs a diaper changed or it&#39;s time to get ready for bed.  All our calm but firm insistence is for naught.  It seems to make no difference to him.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my younger child, Alex (just 15 months younger than Thomas) is a piece of cake sompared to his brother.  He is easy going, gentle, easy to reason with, etc.  It is VERY hard not to play favorites when Thomas is having one of his difficult days and it is time to choose who gets to go with Mom or Dad to run an errand, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the time, when Thomas is being mean and nasty to his brother (pushing, yelling, taking things) I tell tearful Alex just not to play with him for a while and try to get him interested in something else.  But it hardly seems fair to punish Alex for his brother&#39;s actions by taking him away from the activity in question.  The other half of the time, I have to send Thomas to his room to be alone, as he is just not fit company for other human beings.  He plays quiety in there and often emerges in a better humor.  Sometimes he refuses to come out again, prefering to play by himself after being over-stimulated and over-emotional.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805468142">Nanci, have you read the books by Faber and Mazlish?  they&#39;re <br/>
supposed to be for older children, but the principles are the same. <br/>
Nancy Samalin&#39;s books are based on the same work, Haim <br/>
Ginott&#39;s parenting workshops.  They outline 5 skills to engage co-<br/>
operation...<br/>
<br/>
&quot; 1.  Describe.  Describe what you see, or describe the problem.<br/>
  2.  Give information<br/>
  3.  Say it with a word<br/>
  4.  Talk about your feelings<br/>
  5.  Write a note&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the situation you&#39;ve described I can see 3 of these skills that <br/>
might be useful.  Describing the probelm, or what you see...  &quot;I <br/>
see an upset child!!&quot;   Give information...  &quot;We don&#39;t snatch&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Johnny hasn&#39;t finished with this&quot; and talking about your feelings.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know what your feelings were, here, and maybe some <br/>
people would think it&#39;s inappropriate to tell a small child how you <br/>
feel, but I think that it&#39;s a bit dishonest to act like you&#39;re not mad if <br/>
you are &lt;g&gt;  Another point that&#39;s mentioned is that asking how <br/>
someone thinks another might feel about something can be putting <br/>
them on the spot, so I say &#39;I&#39;m sure you can think about how you <br/>
would feel if this was happening to you.&#39;  It looks a bit long-<br/>
winded, but they might actualy think about it, rather than feeling <br/>
challenged and twisting their toe onto the ground...<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I try to do (need to stick this on the inside of my <br/>
specs I think...) is to talk to the &#39;injured&#39; party, commiserate and <br/>
empathise with the &#39;snatchee...&#39;<br/>
