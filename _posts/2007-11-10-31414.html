<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835490657">-=-I asked Thomas if he would bring in<br/>
one of his drink glasses from the computer desk to the kitchen, since  <br/>
I was<br/>
doing dishes, and he just started yelling at me about how *I* never do<br/>
anything and I make him do everything, which is the complete opposite  <br/>
almost<br/>
of how things really are.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What was Thomas doing when you asked him?  You didn&#39;t tell us the  <br/>
most important part.  What did you interrupt?  What did you expect  <br/>
him to stop doing right that second?<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve gone and gotten the glass and said something nice to the  <br/>
computer using kid (if he was doing that) or the TV watching kid, or  <br/>
maybe say nothing if it was at a crucial part of the game or show.  I  <br/>
might say &quot;Do you know of any more dishes down here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in the middle of something like playing a game that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
pause, or unloading the dryer, or cleaning the hot tub, or writing a  <br/>
letter like this and one of my kids asks me to do something, I&#39;ll  <br/>
probably say &quot;Wait a few minutes if you can&quot; or &quot;When I&#39;m finished  <br/>
with this I can help you&quot; or whatever.  If they&#39;re distraught or it&#39;s  <br/>
pressing, I&#39;ll drop whatever I&#39;m doing, but most often it can wait a  <br/>
bit.  When they were littler, I&#39;d engage them in conversation about  <br/>
the thing if I needed to stall.  I&#39;d be saying yes, but still  <br/>
finishing what I was doing and getting more details about what they  <br/>
needed too.  I didn&#39;t send them away to wait.<br/>
<br/>
But about dishes, whoever sees them pretty much gets them.  A week  <br/>
ago we had a full-on sit-down dinner after which Marty picked up all  <br/>
the dishes on the table, and we all thanked him.<br/>
<br/>
Someone will do it, or we&#39;ll all grab a few.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m doing the dishes, I check by the computers.  When I&#39;m coming  <br/>
upstairs, if someone has left dishes on the step where we leave mail  <br/>
to go down or dishes to go up, I grab them and take them to the  <br/>
sink.  If I leave a dish there, someone else takes it to the sink.<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t happen from discussion or planning, though.  It grew  <br/>
naturally from courtesies extended to the children from the parents.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I recognize that either this is how he truly sees<br/>
it, or he’s just frustrated about something and this is the first  <br/>
thing that<br/>
comes to mind to say.-=-<br/>
<br/>
His frustration will gradually ease if you&#39;re willing to gradually  <br/>
give more in patient and willing and loving ways.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I recognize that either this is how he truly sees<br/>
it, or he’s just frustrated about something and this is the first  <br/>
thing that<br/>
comes to mind to say. But I ended up yelling at him that I’ve been  <br/>
doing all<br/>
the cleaning and just asked if he’d bring in one glass.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your housecleaning is costing him peace and love.  Bummer.<br/>
It would&#39;ve been WAY easier for you to go and get that glass.<br/>
<br/>
-=-On the other hand,<br/>
the same week he helped put away the silverware while I was doing the  <br/>
rest<br/>
of the dishes, and all I did was ask if he’d help me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t help voluntarily until some time after you quit asking him  <br/>
to help.  That&#39;s another of those things that sounds stupid to say,  <br/>
but as long as he expects that you&#39;ll ask, he&#39;ll help when you ask  <br/>
(in various states of willingness) and when you don&#39;t ask , he won&#39;t  <br/>
help.  You&#39;re on the path to getting him to help when you ask, not on  <br/>
the path to getting him to want to help.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of good things here.  Please do look.  If you&#39;ve  <br/>
already looked, look again because those things come across  <br/>
differently with different levels of experience and understanding.<br/>

him to stop doing right that second?<br/>
<br/>
** I believe that in this case, he was just walking from the living room<br/>
(where the computer is) toward the dining room/kitchen. If he had a<br/>
particular plan in his head for what he was going to be doing, I didn&#39;t know<br/>
and he didn&#39;t say. **<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve gone and gotten the glass and said something nice to the  <br/>
computer using kid (if he was doing that) or the TV watching kid, or  <br/>
maybe say nothing if it was at a crucial part of the game or show.  I  <br/>
might say &quot;Do you know of any more dishes down here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
** This is what I do frequently. In the morning when they&#39;re still asleep,<br/>
I&#39;ll go through that room where I usually find their glasses, food wrappers,<br/>
plates, etc, and clean up. If they&#39;re in the room and I’m cleaning, I&#39;ll ask<br/>
if they&#39;re done with their drink, or if I can take it. **<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in the middle of something like playing a game that doesn&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
** If I&#39;d known he was going to respond that way I would have! I can&#39;t read<br/>
his mind. He didn&#39;t seem to be otherwise occupied. If he&#39;d been at the<br/>
computer I wouldn’t have asked him. **<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
** But this is where I&#39;m confused. I asked him if he&#39;d help, and he did. If<br/>
he had said no, I&#39;d have done it. I wasn&#39;t trying to order him to help. It&#39;s<br/>
been a while since he had a regular chore of helping with dishes. I&#39;ve tried<br/>
not involving him. Maybe it&#39;s just not been long enough. But that&#39;s why the<br/>
blow up over the glass was weird. I had to re-read what you wrote twice, but<br/>
I think I see what you&#39;re saying. If I just stop asking, eventually he&#39;ll<br/>
just want to help when he sees I need it. Right? I&#39;ve been trying to be more<br/>
conscious of nice things I can do for him (and Emily) before the need<br/>
arises, before they say they need help, or before they would go do it for<br/>
themselves. I want them to see that I&#39;m looking for things I can do in<br/>
anticipation, or just to be helpful, when in the past, I would have waited<br/>
for one of them to ask me first. **<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of good things here.  Please do look.  If you&#39;ve  <br/>
already looked, look again because those things come across  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220146781">This is one of my struggles (hoping for the kids to help more), so I just<br/>
wanted to throw my bid in here.<br/>
<br/>
What I usually do, as I do with my husband is say, &quot;Are you busy right<br/>
now?&quot;  If they say no, then I let them know what I need done.  If they say<br/>
yes, then I just say &quot;alright&quot; and either do it myself of they usually come<br/>
ask me what I needed done.  Everyone (except maybe the five year old cause I<br/>
don&#39;t ask him so much) has figured out that &quot;are you busy?&quot; means &quot;I need a<br/>
favor.&quot; in Momspeak (at least their mom&#39;s speak).  I think, though, that I<br/>
am acknowledging the fact that they can keep doing what they are doing.<br/>
When I really *need* something done, I will generally say, &quot;can you do me a<br/>
favor right now?&quot; but that usually only applies to my husband as he is<br/>
generally the only one who is capable of doing the things that I am simply<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be working pretty well.  It works almost all the time with my<br/>
husband, most of the time with my 11 yo, about half the time with my 7 yo<br/>
and almost never with my 5 yo (that is why I don&#39;t ask him much, just let<br/>
him help when he feels like it).  I think this is pretty age appropriate.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know.  Just my own thoughts and how I have gotten this &quot;no chore&quot;<br/>
thing to work for us fairly well.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like this is coercive.  I am not trying to be coercive, but<br/>
maybe I am missing something.  That does happen, LOL.  =)<br/>

you do me a<br/>
favor right now?&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
When I need help quickly, and everyone&#39;s engrossed in something, I&#39;ll  <br/>
ask &quot;Can you help met at the commercial?&quot; or &quot;Can this game pause?&quot;    <br/>
or &quot;I need help when you get a chance&quot; (if it can wait).<br/>
<br/>
Very often I get the help right that moment.  Usually I get the help  <br/>
in a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Some games don&#39;t pause.  If they&#39;re in a WoW activity, I might have  <br/>
to wait eight minutes.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879721767">One thing my kids LOVE is www.chorewars.com.  You can create a family &quot;team&quot;<br/>
(we&#39;re the Rizzo Raiders) and choose an avatar for your character.  You<br/>
create quests - anyone in the team can create a quest - and for each quest<br/>
the creator chooses the treasures to be won and the monsters to be battled.<br/>
After you complete the quest IRL, you log on to check it as completed.  At<br/>
that point you may encounter a monster to battle.  You rack up points and<br/>
after a certain number of points, you &quot;level up&quot; to more challenges.  Some<br/>
of the monsters my kids created were dust bunny monsters, lint trap<br/>
monsters, etc.  The only drawback is the battle is a &quot;click&quot; battle - you<br/>
don&#39;t battle as I thought we might.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lot of fun!  We are always thinking up fun ways to do household tasks<br/>
and this is one of our favorites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486961627">Thanks Olga. I will try asking if they�re busy first, even if it seems to me<br/>
that they�re not. I do ask if someone will do me a favor, too, and if they<br/>
can�t, that�s fine.<br/>
