<div id="ygrps-yiv-871297249">&lt;&lt;I was born in NYC but haven&#39;t lived there and still think it is very exciting and also overstimulating. I am always ready to go home to country life after a few sleepless nights there!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was strange to wake up at 2:00 a.m. and hear the horns and sirens sounding as though it were 2:00 p.m.!  I remember the first grade Waldorf teacher having to take my daughter for a long walk outside because the classroom was too stimulating for her. She&#39;s always needed quiet alone time--I truly wonder how life in NYC will affect her.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the kids at our Waldorf school seemed to think Eurythmy was kind of a joke--I think that was mainly because the Eurythymy teacher took it so very seriously.  It was similar to dancing, movements made to correspond to sounds and concepts. It can be quite beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Beth, I know there&#39;s a Waldorf school in Austin that I used to hear good things about years ago.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth a long trip, though, since I don&#39;t know that school personally (although I assume they&#39;re all pretty similar).  If you&#39;re interested, could you go for an information meeting in conjunction with a business or pleasure trip?<br/>

I meant to respond to this part earlier. Maybe she won&#39;t like it or get used<br/>
to it and come home to you or enjoy visiting you more often than not. That<br/>
is amazing though that her teacher would do this for her I guess you get<br/>
what you pay for (they are well trained in understanding how to<br/>
individualize) I think.. That is also why hs is a good option for kids with<br/>
sensory integration issues. My son is easily distracted & overstimulated in<br/>
a classroom environment and so am I! Homelife naturally can offer the quiet<br/>
time that is forced on kids in ps in a very unatural way (still they aren&#39;t<br/>
there to help them in the cafeteria and other places) One reason I let<br/>
Melissa go to the kindergarten here aside from it being only 2 hours long<br/>
the teacher kept the lights low and had art all along the walls and some<br/>
cosyness to the room. they were allowed to chose and expected to choose<br/>
activities on various tables. They were expected to become independent and<br/>
not have trouble making choices for a lot of different activities. For my<br/>
son esp but both kids this much choice overwhelmed them and the teacher<br/>
didn&#39;t like that they had so much trouble with it. I used to feel like i was<br/>
a terrible mother that I had somehow made them to dependent on mytelling<br/>
them what to do and why couldn&#39;t they just think for them selves and do what<br/>
they wanted till I realized this is not true at home and so it must be<br/>
something else aobut the environment that was  intimidating them. Right now<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like my house is cosy enough for the kids to settle into the<br/>
way I&#39;d like. We do have a lot of natural lighting though. Winter air is<br/>
stuffy and I&#39;ve had it with keeping the windows closed here! (Even though I<br/>
haven&#39;t taken them out of school yet I have had them home now either from<br/>
snow days or sick days so someone is always here lately). Each child still<br/>
would work best in their own room for indiviual projects they do enjoy. Do<br/>
those with more than one child have a sacred space for reading together as a<br/>
family? I think I need to get away from just reading with mine in their<br/>
beds.<br/>
