<div id="ygrps-yiv-200710684">Hi Everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just joined this List (and three others)!  We&#39;ve &quot;officially&quot; been<br/>
homeschooling for nearly two years now (we were doing some intensive<br/>
&quot;parenting&quot; before then *grin*).  We&#39;ve been following a delight directed<br/>
Unit Study approach for our content subjects using good childrens literature<br/>
to tie it all together (FIAR has sort of guided us and given me tons of<br/>
confidence to &quot;go-it-on-my-own&quot;).  For Math we&#39;ve been dabbling around in<br/>
Miquon (and loving it) and for phonics we use Letterland (a British<br/>
curriculum) to introduce the alphabet and the phonic sounds but have moved<br/>
onto the British version of Reading Reflex to actually teach reading when<br/>
we&#39;ve felt like some formal stuff.  I&#39;ve just completed the Unschooling<br/>
Handbook by Mary Griffith and am very excited to slide into this method of<br/>
learning (just find the Math-thing a little daunting!)  I&#39;m the South<br/>
African distributor of all the above mentioned curricula so this change of<br/>
direction is sort of embarassing *smile* !  I was sooo pleased to see Teri<br/>
on this List as I&#39;ve just discovered your beautiful Site and the book you<br/>
wrote for Christian Unschoolers on the &#39;Net!!!  Are there any Lists or<br/>
Message Boards for *Christian* Unschoolers available?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839261646">Dear Adele<br/>
<br/>
Welcome. I have a 7yob, too.<br/>
<br/>
As a distributor of curricula have you come in contact<br/>
with many homeschoolers?  Are the legalities<br/>
uncomfortable in SA? Do most folks do homeschooling<br/>
now? or less than in the past? What sort of school did<br/>
you grow up with? Confusing, I would guess, by the<br/>
ages of you children I put you in late twenties.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is a way to be parents that isn&#39;t<br/>
intensive? <br/>
<br/>
I suppose I&#39;m one of those sorts who has more<br/>
questions than answers. I often answer questions with<br/>
more questions, too!<br/>
