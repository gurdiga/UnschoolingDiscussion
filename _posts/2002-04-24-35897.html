I am also a Christian and have been out the public school system for almost 2 years. My oldest is 8 and he went for k and 1. My daughter went for 1 month of k before they were both pulled. Our Christ centered life is a HUGE part of how we unschool and even why we unschool. I think the Bible does teach us that we are to learn from life as we go through it. <br/>
I just thought I would speak up and let you know that there are Christians on this list. :-)<br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Intro: Hey BRIDGET<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If mom is always saying &quot;this looks fun, wanna go?&quot; <br/>
  there is a chance that the kidlet will think she wants him to go and <br/>
  do it for that reason.  And guarding against that can be very  <br/>
  difficult with some kids.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  My children have NO problem telling me they don&#39;t think something is a<br/>
  good idea! LOL!<br/>
  We have that kind of relationship. We live together and we KNOW each<br/>
  other well.<br/>
  But I do think parents have the right to introduce their ideas to their<br/>
  children. That&#39;s what wonderful and unique about FAMILY. We, as parents,<br/>
  impart things to our children that we hold dear or important. The child<br/>
  will, of course, agree or disagree as an individual regardless of my<br/>
  passion for whatever I&#39;m imparting. Usually my children have a &quot;prove it<br/>
  to me, show me that it&#39;s true and that it makes sense.&quot; Then the burden<br/>
  lies on me to produce that evidence. I think that is a good skill for my<br/>
  kids and for me to have. I didn&#39;t have the skill of proving anything<br/>
  prior to having my children! LOL! They have been a huge learning<br/>
  experience for me too.<br/>
  We are Christians, I impart to and teach my children our faith. I use<br/>
  the Bible (a curriculum in a sense.)As a Christian I do not feel it&#39;s<br/>
  wise to allow my children to just &quot;explore&quot; the world without the<br/>
  knowledge of God.<br/>
  For instance, biology, my children have learned that God is the<br/>
  &quot;intelligence&quot; that put it all together. I handed them what I believe<br/>
  and I found ways to &quot;prove it&quot; to them.<br/>
<br/>
  Please, let&#39;s not turn this into a religious debate. :o)I have a feeling<br/>
  some here my jump on this. The above is the first example that came to<br/>
  my mind of using my parental influence in my child&#39;s &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for letting me share.<br/>

  I am of two mind on this one.  I know one family where one of the kids <br/>
  LOVES workbooks and does thme all the time and asks for more.  So yes, <br/>
  workbooks can be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  But I also think that parents can have influence they don&#39;t understand <br/>
  or even see.  They may be subtly promoting something so the kids does <br/>
  it because his perception is that it will please his parent.  This can <br/>
  be workbooks, but it can also happen with all the other things we&#39;ve <br/>
  talked about.  If mom is always saying &quot;this looks fun, wanna go?&quot; <br/>
  there is a chance that the kidlet will think she wants him to go and <br/>
  do it for that reason.  And guarding against that can be very  <br/>
  difficult with some kids.  <br/>

  &gt; Why isn&#39;t it unschooling if you set up an activity from one of these <br/>
  books,<br/>
  &gt; but the kids are free to take it or leave it?  How is it different <br/>
  from<br/>
  &gt; having a fun computer math game available, such as Sandra mentioned <br/>
  she<br/>
  &gt; played with Holly?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I understand that even presenting children with certain &quot;academic&quot;<br/>
  &gt; activities can imply the parent feels they are necessary in an <br/>
  educational<br/>
  &gt; sense, but if the child can say &quot;no thank you&quot; isn&#39;t it worthwhile <br/>
  to offer,<br/>
  &gt; just for fun?  When I say this I mean &quot;offer&quot; once in a while, as it <br/>
  comes<br/>
  &gt; up or when I think it might be fun or fit in with something else <br/>
  that<br/>
  &gt; happened recently.  I do not mena &quot;planning a curriculum&quot; and then <br/>
  offering<br/>
  &gt; it to the kids with the hopes they will finish it.<br/>
