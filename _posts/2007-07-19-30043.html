 </span></blockquote>Three of my family have done it; I donated 14 inches when I went from <br/>
waist-length to really short, my daughter donated when hers got long <br/>
enough, and yes, my son did as well (I hated to see it go :-)  I went <br/>
to a really nice salon that was holding a one-day event; the kids went <br/>
to Great Clips, where they got a free cut for the donation.  Alex has <br/>
continued to get his hair cut there, but Laura wasn&#39;t as happy with her <br/>
style.  They&#39;re kind of a Supercuts sort of salon, and the quality of <br/>
the cut depends on who you happen to get.  He&#39;s only had one really bad <br/>
cut, though; he likes it short and spiky now, and one stylist cut it <br/>
way too short.  Hair grows, though :-)<br/>

I&#39;ve heard that some salons will do it for free.  Some also contact the<br/>
local newspaper and have them run an article with pictures, which could<br/>
be fun.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940627262">Zac did this last fall and we donated to Wigs For Kids (I think that was the name of the place)  - we found them on line and liked the fact that they make wigs for kids with various reasons for hair loss - where as locks of love are for one type of illness.  There are instructions on what they want done / how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I cut his hair - it was almost to his waist - we took pictures and just had a great time of it.  I&#39;ve always cut his and hubby&#39;s hair (saves a bundle).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967526942">My 7yro donated his hair to Locks of Love last year.  He had it cut at Wal-Mart and they sent the hair home in an envelope for us to mail.  My fiance took him and they just told the person cutting his hair that they wanted to donate it.  Then he came home with the envelope.  It was very hard for me because it was Justin&#39;s first haircut.  He still had his baby curls and they were awesome, went all the way down his back.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294400775">My first & third daughter decided to grow their hair long for a Canadian<br/>
Organization. I think it was� Angel Hair for Kids�. We live near a small<br/>
village and I called the local hair salon to ask if they would be able to<br/>
cut their hair, but we had to make sure it was long enough for the donation.<br/>
They said sure & then told us they would cut it for free!! With their<br/>
permission I called the local newspaper from a small town near us and<br/>
suggested it would be neat as we had never seen it done in our area before.<br/>
Since my kids were inspired by a story in my in-laws local paper (6 + hour<br/>
drive away), we thought it might encourage other kids or adults too. So they<br/>
were on the front page of the last newspaper of that year!!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, it inspired the local Fair Ambassador to have her very long locks cut<br/>
after she handed over her crown to her successor. She decided to do it at<br/>
the fair & ask if others would like to do the same and also to donate<br/>
financially as each wig cost about $1200.00. That year a couple of others<br/>
did do it and they raised enough for half a wig. Then next year my hair was<br/>
long enough as was my second & third daughter�s hair. So all 3 of us<br/>
donated. Then my DH said that if fair-goers would donate $100.00 he�d have<br/>
is head shaved bald. I also raised over $100.00 from friends at the fair.<br/>
THEN they ended up with over $1200.00. The following year MORE men decided<br/>
to take up the challenge & they made up pledge sheets ahead of time. There<br/>
were a couple of men who donated hair, but some were just getting shaved<br/>
bald. Of course there were still the girls & women donating too.  It is now<br/>
a yearly tradition at our local fair to cut & donate for the fair. I have<br/>
done it twice and one dd did it once & one dd twice & another has done it 3<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The reason my DH decided to have his head shaved that year was because one<br/>
of our friends� dd was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia. She is one of<br/>
my 3rd dd�s best friends. My husband stood up in front of all those people,<br/>
with tears in his eyes & told them the reason myself & 2 of our children<br/>
were donated & why he was fund-raising too. We were doing it for Cass. He<br/>
said it would be awesome to get enough donations to buy one wig for<br/>
$1200.00. The amazing thing is our town only has a total population of 500!!<br/>
Even the people who worked at the carnival rides were donating. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We got involved in a Curling Cancer Bonspeil and we were off our goal by<br/>
$200.00. DH offered to have his head shaved (it had grown back by then!) if<br/>
they could donate the extra $200.00. These people had already paid for their<br/>
meals, had donated prizes had bid on the auction and silent auction, yet the<br/>
managed to come up with the $200.00. This was from 80 people!! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Interesting thing is Cass decided she didn�t want to wear a wig, but chose<br/>
to wear hats instead. I lovely lady in the town near u gave me 3 lovely hats<br/>
for Cass. I am so lucky to be around so many generous people (not just money<br/>
but of time and helping others too).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is actually the Fair Weekend & tonight my oldest daughter won<br/>
Ambassador of the Fair. No�it is not a fashion show!! She had to do a quiz<br/>
regarding the community both the village and especially the rural as we are<br/>
an Agricultural Fair. She was also had to do a personal interview. Then they<br/>
were required to prepare a speech. The topic needed to involve the fair &<br/>
agriculture. We have lived in the area over 9 years & been attending the<br/>
fair for 10. We put crafts, flowers, etc in the fair as well. Anyways, the<br/>
judges said she was the most mature of all the young ladies (6). Interesting<br/>
as she was the youngest competitor (17) and the oldest was 20!! She won<br/>
several ribbons in the Photography Section of the Fair as well.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then my second youngest daughter was in the Youth Ambassador competition<br/>
with 4 other competitors. She sang �True Colours� with NO background music.<br/>
She won Youth Ambassador. We think this is the first time two sisters have<br/>
ever won both the same year!!<br/>

Better get myself to bed as it is going to be a VERY busy weekend. <br/>

That&#39;s what Dave did when he had to cut off his almost-waist length, wavy,  <br/>
thick, thick, thick (so thick, his ponytail was twice as thick as  my <br/>
tightly-braided hair) hair for a job. He got the info off the  website and we sent it <br/>
in, too... I don&#39;t remember if he got a certificate or  not, but I remember how <br/>
the staff where he got it cut paid him special attention  (and his hair) and <br/>
how happy and proud he was to think of his hair helping some  little girl feel <br/>
special. I know he had more than 10&quot;... I&#39;m thinking over 12&quot;,  but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure.<br/>
