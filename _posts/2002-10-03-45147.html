<div id="ygrps-yiv-610606253">I agree with the arbitrary bedtime thing being completely unfair to<br/>
children.  My youngest (just turned 2) has no bedtime and my oldest<br/>
(just turned 6) didn&#39;t until very recently.  Here is why she does now: <br/>
ZoÃ« is a child that cannot sleep in the day, even if the room is pitch<br/>
black.  She gave up naps when she was about 3 weeks old or so.  There is<br/>
something in her physical body that makes her need nighttime hours to<br/>
sleep.  She has been like this since the day she was born and if I<br/>
wasn&#39;t holding her she would not sleep ever until she was a little over<br/>
3 years (I became very capable of using the toilet whilst holding her). <br/>
She also has no sense of tiredness in herself.  If you ask her if she is<br/>
tired, the answer will always be no.  If you tell her that the signs<br/>
that her body is showing are sleepy signs, she will argue and stay up<br/>
even longer.<br/>
<br/>
Most children have the ability to go to sleep after a while from sheer<br/>
exhaustion.  Not this child.  We&#39;ve seen her literally stay up for 3<br/>
days straight and only then collapse with breastfeeding (if I happened<br/>
to not be home, she would not go to sleep).  We&#39;ve started having<br/>
behavioral problems that affect the entire family due to her being able<br/>
to live (but NOT thrive) on 4 or so hours of sleep.  DH and I prefer to<br/>
go to bed between 12 and 2AM, and so we always had her do the same with<br/>
us.  This DOES NOT work if the child will wake up at 6AM.  Children<br/>
really do need more sleep than adults.  They are growing!  The younger<br/>
the child, the more they need to sleep (although teenagers need quite a<br/>
lot of sleep, too).  I need 9 hours of sleep to feel refreshed, but I<br/>
seldom get more than 6 myself.  My daughter is not a nice person to be<br/>
around unless she has had at least 8 (preferably 10).  She has never<br/>
slept in a car, not even on a 24 hour straight drive that we did when<br/>
she was almost 3.<br/>
<br/>
For her health and every one in this house&#39;s sanity, we started a<br/>
bedtime with her.  She understands it, but doesn&#39;t always agree with<br/>
it.  On the days that we have &quot;allowed&quot; her to stay up late (traveling,<br/>
guests, just because, etc.), we have all (including her!)regretted it<br/>
for about 3-4 days<br/>
later.  It really takes her that long to get back into a good sleep<br/>
cycle.  It also takes her about 1.5-2 hours to wind down BY HERSELF to<br/>
be able to fall asleep.  If someone checks in on her, the clock starts<br/>
all over again and we regret it for days.  We are always gentle and kind<br/>
in this, but she NEEDS this for her health.  I hate it, but she loves it<br/>
and is thriving on this routine.  I, personally, hate routines and love<br/>
to do things on the spot.  She hates that, and her needs and wants come<br/>
before mine.  It took us 5.5 years of living her need for consistent<br/>
going to sleep time for us to come to the conclusion that she needs a<br/>
bedtime.  DH and I always felt that bedtimes were horrible and cruel for<br/>
us as children, however we both could sleep anywhere as children.  This<br/>
child cannot and will not.  It is physically impossible for her.  <br/>
<br/>
I only say all this so that those of you who have such strict &quot;No<br/>
Bedtime&quot; rules can see that the rigidness of that statement is just as<br/>
unhealthy as the rigidness of an arbitrary bedtime based on what the<br/>
clock says.  My daughter&#39;s bedtime is based on sunset and she rises<br/>
around sunrise, her physical choice of hours- definitely NOT mine.  This<br/>
has made us all live in less of a sleep deprived zombie state and it is<br/>
a wonderful live saver.  I am NOT a good mother when I haven&#39;t slept in<br/>
days and she is not a very nice person when she hasn&#39;t slept, either.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  We coslept with her until age 4.5.  I breastfed her daily until<br/>
age 4ish, then periodically even still (all her choice).  She gets loads<br/>
of physical contact, so please don&#39;t try to say that I wasn&#39;t fulfilling<br/>
her physical contact needs as an infant.  I definitely have been doing<br/>
this.  What I wasn&#39;t fulfilling was her lack of physical contact needs. <br/>
She has proven to me that quite a few people NEED time alone.  Her<br/>
bedtime<br/>
actually makes me sad, since I love to be with her, it is her that<br/>
doesn&#39;t do well with us.  Her bedtime is completely for her and has<br/>
nothing to do with the needs of the parents.</div>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a rule. It&#39;s the absence of rules. It&#39;s a blank slate to use as a<br/>
beginning point to find the best ways to meet each child&#39;s specific needs.<br/>
In your daughter&#39;s case it would be helping her to recognize the signs of<br/>
tiredness -- without telling her what she&#39;s feeling if that doesn&#39;t work ;-)<br/>
-- by starting bedtime routines or things that were calming and relaxing for<br/>
her when tiredness was starting to show or darkness was coming on. Good<br/>
things that she wanted to do. Not in a &quot;this is what you need so this is<br/>
what we&#39;re going to do&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
I think the identifying problems and seeking solutions part of the process<br/>
doesn&#39;t get enough &quot;air time&quot; because these discussions almost always take<br/>
off after someone insists that rules are necessary or insists people are<br/>
suggesting hands-off parenting. So everyone&#39;s concentrating on discussing<br/>
the no rules part and what parents do instead of rules is said but no one<br/>
notices it in all the noise about no rules.<br/>
<br/>
Even blank slate doesn&#39;t get to the idea since it will lead a rules type to<br/>
the conclusion that it means rules are based on a child&#39;s needs rather than<br/>
age, like 8PM bedtime for one child and 9PM for another child who needs less<br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Getting from the idea of parents finding the proper size container for<br/>
optimal child growth to the idea of nurturing growth in the container that<br/>
life provides is hard! Our society just doesn&#39;t have a ready-made model of<br/>
the second to describe what people mean when they say no rules. So people<br/>
trying to understand it put the ideas into the models they already know:<br/>
permissiveness, hands-off parenting, letting the kids raise themselves, Lord<br/>
of the Flies (someone mentioned recently).<br/>
