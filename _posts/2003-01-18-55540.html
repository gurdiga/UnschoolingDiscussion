&gt; WalMart used to stock some decent 14K earings for pretty cheap, maybe they<br/>
&gt; still do.  Can she borrow some from you or another grown relative to try<br/>
&gt; before she spends her money?  (Cleaning them well first, of course.)<br/>

  Here&#39;s another thought: see if you can buy just the *wires* in gold--from <br/>
an earring or bead or craft-supply store--and then re-string (well, <br/>
whatever...re-wire?  re-bead?) her favorite earrings onto the new, gold <br/>
wires. <br/>

  My dh has such odd, corrosive skin that he&#39;s even eaten away the <br/>
inscriptions inside his fat, gold wedding band--after only 22 years of <br/>
marriage. ;-)<br/>

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we are <br/>
to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and <br/>
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>
