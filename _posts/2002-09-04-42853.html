My name is Joanna; I am a production<br/>
assistant for The Merrow Report, PBS&#39;s<br/>
premiere series on youth and learning. We<br/>
are currently in pre-production for a piece on<br/>
applying to college from homeschool.<br/>
Although the angle is undecided, we are<br/>
leaning toward the journey of homeschooled<br/>
seniors applying to major national<br/>
universities. <br/>
<br/>
If you or anyone you know is graduating or<br/>
has recently graduated and fits this<br/>
description, you could be a focus for our<br/>
documentary and I would love to hear from<br/>
you. Also, any current issues in the world of<br/>
homeschooling that may be interesting to<br/>
cover are welcome ideas. Thanks, and my<br/>
email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jgc221@...">jgc221@...</a>...hope to hear from<br/>
you!</div>

Wes Beach might be the most knowledgeable person in California about<br/>
getting homeschooled kids out of high school early and into college.  It<br/>
would make a rather startling media expose if people knew that kids<br/>
could just click their heels together three times and wish &quot;there&#39;s no<br/>
place like getting out of high school&quot; and, boom, they can be graduated.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be a good idea to promote this, or do you think it would cause<br/>
trouble and government backlash?<br/>
