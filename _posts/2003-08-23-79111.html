<div id="ygrps-yiv-361012754">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
lol.. we do go &quot;school supply shopping&quot;.  The girls look at it as a time <br/>
to restock on whatever they need. They make their lists and off we go -- <br/>
it might not look like a typical list, it often includes a lot of stuff <br/>
from the craft store. But it&#39;s fun getting some new notebooks, colored <br/>
markers or gel pens, re-stocking their craft supplies, that sort of <br/>
thing. One daughter has decided that she likes writing, and after trying <br/>
lots of options, she likes the ancient portable typewriter best, so we <br/>
need to get a new ribbon for it. The kids have made friends with another <br/>
unschooling family that just moved to the area (now there are three <br/>
families that unschool - wow, a crowd!). their new friends are really <br/>
into games, so the kids want some new board games. The oldest is <br/>
involved in acting, so there&#39;s always something different on her list - <br/>
I think she needs deely boppers from Claire&#39;s (those weird headband <br/>
thingies with springs that stick up like bunny ears and have feathers or <br/>
such at the end of them).<br/>
<br/>
go &quot;unschool shopping&quot;. Do what unschoolers always do - do it your own <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
As for being an advocate for unschooling, I think it&#39;s sort of like <br/>
religion - best done by how you live your life and not by preaching at <br/>
people. --- imho.<br/>
<br/>
and as for quiet - not only is the list quiet - but one of the other two <br/>
local unschooling families is at the conference.<br/>
<br/>
take care,<br/>

<br/>
     What is the value of that to her?  What are her fears if she doesn&#39;t?  <br/>
Can you show how her fears are unfounded by example in your life, without being <br/>
confrontational or adversarial?  <br/>
<br/>
        I have no idea if you should freak them out, hehehe, or what that <br/>
entails exactly, but if they get a bit shocked by you doing things a different <br/>
way and that your kids are doing just fine,  that&#39;s not that bad, is it?   Or is <br/>
that what their shocked about? lol <br/>
<br/>
       Maybe don&#39;t make it about unschooling vs homeschooling but just your <br/>
personal preference or approach, what works for your family.  <br/>
<br/>
And, I love school supply time....How can 15 cent glue be a bad thing? lol   <br/>
Resistance is futile!  <br/>

stand hanging out with people who say things like &quot;maintain authority over my <br/>
kids&quot;, etc. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
     This is why I have no good mommy &#39;friends&#39;.  Long story starting with being the only person in my/our circle of friends to have kids, eight years later we have the only four kids in our &#39;group&#39;.  Our friends love our kids and have included them in their wedding parties (5-6 of them) but they are not always doing things that the kids can participate in.  Dance clubs, keg parties and the like.  We have many families with which we try to do things with occasionally but my problem is that our philosophies are so different.  It always turns out that the Mom will threaten and/or spank when we are out at some point.  I don&#39;t want to hang out with people that don&#39;t increase my enjoyment of life.  Watching their littleones deal with mommy smacking them is too depressing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what it is, with me so continually finding people like this.  My personality I would guess. :-D  I like dancing, hard music, and have sex on the brain a lot(4kids)8-0 that tends to make it hard for me to become good friends with the women that are kind considerate parents.  People assume my seeming crassness doesn&#39;t allow for a gentle parenting ideal and being mindful of what I want my children&#39;s lives to be (for them by them)  <br/>
<br/>
I have to go but I just wanted to say I know how you feel.  I too am under a self imposed mental health quarantine.  I don&#39;t have time for people who poison my beliefs and who can&#39;t benefit from my influence.  Sounds cold put that way and I&#39;m really not meaning it that way but....?  Honestly I only have so much time here.<br/>

bitchy, and cold, and superior, but hey, we all have our own standards, right? <br/>

with, just so hard to keep my mouth shut!!!!!! Maureen and I have both had <br/>
people ask us about unschooling based on what they see our children doing,and <br/>
that is cool.<br/>
As far as the Authority thing, that woman was worried that the children would <br/>
be running wild in the streets, talking back to their parents and doing drugs <br/>
and having sex.I simply talked about mutual respect with her, but I don&#39;t <br/>
think she got it.I am not so articulate.<br/>
Must go looking for some 15cent glue!!!&lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678860219">Just for fun today dd and I took the school supply list she would be using if in ps and priced out what it would cost to send her to 5th grade.......over $100 later (many of these items on sale....!) we looked at each other and laughed our way out of the store as we discussed all the fun we could/will have with that same amount of money.  I don&#39;t know if that helps with the &quot;want to purchase&quot; feelings you are having but it sure cured mine! (g)<br/>
We are headed out on a mom/daughter camping trip the week after labor day for our &quot;back to school&quot; experience.....dad/son are gone fishing this weekend....no better way to celebrate the season if you ask me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798495023">Forgot to mention on last post -- we have the same situation as far as no other unschooling families in the nearby area.  I have found the more comfortable I&#39;ve become with our decision to unschool - the less concerned I am with what others think (actually I just don&#39;t care at all what others think -- I look at the kids and dh and see joy on all the faces....genuine happiness in being together.  That&#39;s all I need to know we are doing the right thing!).  I used to do a newsletter and will often still get calls and questions about the local group...I have no problem being myself and sharing my enthusiasm for our lifestyle and non-schooling choice.  Most folks who call get very quiet and don&#39;t call back.  It has been very empowering for me though.  We have been unschooling for two years...homeschooling overall for three.  After joining this list I let go of restrictions on tv, food and bedtimes.  This has been by far the best decision we have ever made!  I never would have gotten to where I am now without the support I glean from this list --- although as a rule I am simply a lurker.....Thanks though to all those whose words continue to inspire me!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most people are coming from a totally different way of looking at kids, when <br/>
we talk about mutual respect, they have a barrier in their minds that that is <br/>
desireable, much less something to understand. It probably has nothing to do <br/>
with how articulate you are.  It&#39;s probably just a completely foreign concept, <br/>
but the more she spends time with you and your kids....the more she&#39;ll see it <br/>
as a possibility.  <br/>
<br/>
It can be tough when people make their own assumptions about how you raise <br/>
your kids, and then have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.  :-)  When I said I <br/>
don&#39;t do &quot;school at home&quot; to my aunt, I think her brain froze.  Conversation <br/>
ended. lol  <br/>

you can bet that the minimum wage where that glue costs $.20 is nowhere near<br/>
the $8 it is here.  It&#39;s all relative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We were in Walmart over the weekend, both my daughters were with me (dd 23 dd <br/>
15).<br/>
<br/>
They call a code Adam, the missing child alert, giving description and <br/>
clothing and such.  This went on for probably half hour.  Everyone was looking, the <br/>
doors were shut.  We were lingering near the front waiting to check out and we <br/>
see a Walmart employee bring a tiny 2-3 year old frightened boy to his mother <br/>
who IMMEDIATELY takes him from the arms of the employee and starts WAILING <br/>
him then and there.  My 23 year old dd walked up to her and said why are you <br/>
beating this child YOU are the one who lost HIM!  I was stunned that the woman <br/>
was beating the child, stunned that my daughter approached the woman, stunned <br/>
that the employee yanked the child back from the mother, I just couldn&#39;t believe <br/>
what I had just witnessed.  After it all was said and done (and the employee <br/>
made the mother promise not to hit the child and calmed the child down and <br/>
promised the little boy that Mom wouldn&#39;t hit him again) I was pretty proud of my <br/>
daughter to take such action and actually intervene in a situation like this.<br/>
<br/>
There was one lady who tried to confront my daughter and tell her that it was <br/>
none of her business that the mother was just scared.  Sarah again told her <br/>
why then HIT your child who is even more scared, and it was after all the <br/>
mother who LOST her child, should we all go beat the mother?  The woman looked at <br/>
Sarah like she was an alien and walked away murmuring and shaking her head.<br/>
<br/>
It was an odd day, sometimes in my town mothers get arrested for spanking <br/>
their children at the Walmart.<br/>
