Teenage Wasteland<br/>
<br/>
Critics on the left and right falsely portray kids as passive victims of<br/>
mass media.<br/>
<br/>
Carl F. Horowitz<br/>
<br/>
Hollywood has become to the right what big corporations are to the left.<br/>
When it comes to criticizing popular entertainment, the two targets<br/>
coincide, and the differences between left and right dissolve. I vividly<br/>
remember the ghastly sight of Jesse Jackson and Bill Bennett appearing<br/>
together on CBS’s Face the Nation a decade ago, united in their eagerness to<br/>
protect vulnerable youth from cultural pollution.<br/>
<br/>
Two new books, one mainly from the right and the other from the left,<br/>
reflect this bipartisan view of America’s young people as victims of mass<br/>
culture and mass marketing. But both also contain hints that kids are not<br/>
empty vessels waiting to be filled with evil desires -- that in fact, they<br/>
and their parents can counteract the antisocial messages decried by critics<br/>
like Jackson and Bennett.<br/>
