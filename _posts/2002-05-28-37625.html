<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here yet, but I&#39;d like to comment on this. <br/>
Americans do indeed have a problem with sex, but they don&#39;t have a problem <br/>
with paying to watch it on TV, the Internet, or magazines. The sex industry <br/>
brings in more money each year than Hollywood. Americans are into sex. The <br/>
problem is why they are into it that way?<br/>
<br/>
Violence is a fairly simple matter: It doesn&#39;t take much to destroy a Van <br/>
Gogh (if you can get in the vicinity of one), but it takes a hell of a lot to <br/>
create something of that level. Violence is easy, if you will. Many of us <br/>
identify with it for that reason -- we&#39;d love to bust up a restaurant, drive <br/>
a car off a bridge, knock some heads together (if only life were like a Daffy <br/>
Duck cartoon!). Indeed, simple violence has the appearance of power, <br/>
effectiveness, accomplishment, and we like -- and identify with -- those <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Sex, on the other hand, is a purely creative act. The trouble is, being <br/>
creative is difficult work. Moreover, sex inherently exposes almost every <br/>
weakness we have. We are at our most vulnerable during sex, and we hate that! <br/>
We crave power, not weakness. <br/>
<br/>
This has something to do with our being uncomfortable with it on the screen. <br/>
(I&#39;m talking about love scenes, not soft or hard porn, and there is a <br/>
difference. Modesty is no vice, and we are all better off with creative love <br/>
scenes.) Males are the ones who have the most problem with sex.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably males that have the most trouble with *romantic* love scenes, <br/>
too. And this is because romance is creative and difficult work, and because <br/>
men don&#39;t like the thought of having competition -- even on the screen. <br/>
<br/>
I guarantee that the more graphic the sex becomes on TV or movies, the less <br/>
romance we will have in our lives, and the harder it will be to return. We <br/>
would do well to head in the other direction toward having more romance in <br/>
movies, than trying to &quot;open our lives up&quot; to being able to &quot;handle&quot; more <br/>
graphic sex.<br/>
<br/>
Making it clear to our children that creating is indeed difficult work (and <br/>
that destruction is fairly easy), and modeling creative concepts like romance <br/>
and affection, may go a long way in establishing foundations for them which <br/>
may help them avoid the crud. It may even give us a new breed of filmmakers <br/>
who know the difference between real food and candy.<br/>

That would fit my theory above about having been made to wait, maybe.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, a point I kind of wanted to make (but it didn&#39;t really have to do <br/>
with sex scenes in the average R or PG-13 movie) is that pornography is as <br/>
easy for us as violence is. That is, typically it is romance and courting <br/>
that gets one into bed. (Not that sex is the be-all and end-all of a <br/>
relationship, but it is indeed the consummation.) The hard work of sexual <br/>
relationships is about saying and doing the right thing, and being the right <br/>
person. All that, mixed with a little wisdom and providence, and one may end <br/>
up with the perfect mate.<br/>
<br/>
But with pornography, all the difficult work is done for you: passion gets <br/>
turned on at the flip of a switch, and after that, who cares about anything <br/>
else (especially the future), except where the closest bed is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with much movie violence. Busting furniture or throwing pencils <br/>
and books may be the easiest way to react to something. To step back, wait, <br/>
analyze, and gather some peace, is hard work, almost as much as romance.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m obviously stretching, and my reasoning doesn&#39;t stand, for if it does, I <br/>
may be making a case for pornography (something I hope isn&#39;t the case). But <br/>
if viewing violent movies is simply an outlet for our repressed violent <br/>
natures -- a violence we dare not attempt ourselves, does that in the same <br/>
way make the viewing of pornography an outlet for a sexuality we dare not <br/>
attempt as well? I need to think about this. <br/>
<br/>
The Bruce Willis type movies are a hoot, and I&#39;m not sure they should be seen <br/>
as anything more than that. But I often wonder if America&#39;s passion for <br/>
murder and horror is the result of Americans being deeply angry; and if the <br/>
consuming of massive quantities of porn is the result of confusion or <br/>
ignorance about what it is to be human and sexual.<br/>
<br/>
Enough for now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922550047">Dear Bob,<br/>
<br/>
My point in that original post was that there does not appear to be a limit<br/>
for us in general on violence in movies.  There is a taboo and limit to how<br/>
much sex is appropriate and so influences our culture and society in how we<br/>
think about each.  I&#39;m not condoning either one but it does seem unbalanced<br/>
and I think this unbalance might be one reason why ppl have a problem with<br/>
sex in movies and not violence.  I wonder if I tell my kids they can watch<br/>
violent movies but not graphic sex just what am I telling them?<br/>
<br/>
If one thinks that graphic sex in movies is bad and will influence<br/>
negatively than the same holds true for violence in movies.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, pornography is the extreme but why is that not ok when all violence and<br/>
blood and gore is?  If it wasn&#39;t such a big deal the industry probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t make more money than Hollywood.  One of the reasons IMO that<br/>
Hollywood doesn&#39;t have graphic sex is only because society isn&#39;t ready to<br/>
except it like they are violence.  Personally I think it&#39;s only years away.<br/>
Just think of Britney Spears and the kids newest idols.<br/>

<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly. I hope I didn&#39;t sound as if I was defending <br/>
gratuitous violence in movies. Actually, I usually only see the ones that I&#39;m <br/>
told are &quot;must sees.&quot; But I don&#39;t think I would be less a person had I missed <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I can intellectualize the justification of violence in movies as much as the <br/>
next guy (as I did with Saving Private Ryan), but here is where I find <br/>
literature far more effective than movies in getting the point across. <br/>
<br/>
That said, I confess that there are moments in movies where the violence is <br/>
brilliant and lasts a lifetime. For instance, during Schindler&#39;s List (I <br/>
don&#39;t mean to dwell on Spielburg) there was a scene in which a Nazi guard <br/>
starts shooting Jews at random from up top his outlook. It blew my mind. I <br/>
felt the same about the violence in The Deer Hunter. There are a ton of <br/>
movies one could list, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Yet having also said that, I find myself horrified with what I daily see on <br/>
CNN or FoxNews, and I wonder why anyone would want to see more violent <br/>
entertainment on top of all that reality?!<br/>
<br/>
