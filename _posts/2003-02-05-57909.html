children aren&#39;t especially sensitive to visual images. Only that it<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be assumed that they are. We should decide based who each child<br/>
is, not base our decisions for each child on ourselves and our<br/>
sensitivities.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It also depends on the environment. We can&#39;t protect them from everything<br/>
but we can avoid bringing in things we already know *they* don&#39;t like to<br/>
see.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a shift in mind set. It&#39;s shifting from protecting them from things<br/>
that might harm them to avoiding things they don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
And they aren&#39;t likely to like the things that harm them, are they? But they<br/>
*might* like the things we *think* might harm them.<br/>

more than a handful of remarks to go outside and do something.<br/>
<br/>
But I was also an avid reader. I often read in front of the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Plato (or one of the Big 3 ancient philosophers) supposedly decried the use<br/>
of books because then kids wouldn&#39;t have to memorize things anymore. Which<br/>
was based on what?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do people give extreme examples? She isn&#39;t saying you did only to think<br/>
about why it&#39;s used as a tactic in trying to make a point. In the face of<br/>
people who are successfully and without dire consequences doing what we fear<br/>
to do, why do we cling to extreme examples? There are thousands of people<br/>
riding motorcycles and yet the bad outcomes that make our fears feel<br/>
justified get undue weight. We don&#39;t give that same weight to the far more<br/>
numerous automobile accidents because we *want* to drive a car.<br/>
<br/>
We too often make decisions based on fear. We fear something will happen<br/>
therefore we take steps to avoid it. It just seems to be &quot;better safe than<br/>
sorry.&quot; And we cling to extreme examples without understanding why they<br/>
occured or even *if* they occured because we want to feel we&#39;ve done what we<br/>
could to protect ourselves from the things that we fear.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because we&#39;re not used to being able to think things through.<br/>
We&#39;ve been handed the &quot;right&quot; answers our whole lives in school and at home.<br/>
So life seems like a bunch of rules to be memorized. When we go beyond the<br/>
rules, life seems like a crap shoot and we just pick the answer that seems<br/>
best.<br/>
<br/>
But we can through discussion find out why the &quot;right&quot; answers are right.<br/>
And why sometimes the &quot;right&quot; answers are picked just because people fear<br/>
what might happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712406466">Hey Kelle,<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel bad. I personally agree with you that TV should be limited in<br/>
those early years. My two are now 12 & 13 & I don&#39;t have to limit their<br/>
watching as they have better things to do. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, TV can be<br/>
very educational but it can also have a negative effect. I grew up without a<br/>
TV & really believe that I missed out alot on History - world events etc but<br/>
in other ways it was good as I learnt how to occupy my time.<br/>
<br/>
When my two were little I did restrict TV & was very careful what they<br/>
watched, keeping full control of the remote. They were never allowed to just<br/>
switch it on when they felt like it. I don&#39;t believe this was detrimmental<br/>
to them. In fact I believe I was being a wise parent & protecting their<br/>
young minds from things they didn&#39;t need to be seeing at that age. And yes,<br/>
by doing this they had to find other ways to occupy their time i.e reading,<br/>
playing together just to name a couple.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my opinion, each of us is responsible for our own kids & answer<br/>
for how they turn out. YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU & what you feel<br/>
happy with. For eg I know there are many families out there who leave the TV<br/>
on all day. I absolutely abhor that, it drives me nuts, therefore our TV is<br/>
only on when we are watching it & that&#39;s what&#39;s right for us.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good one,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966776064">I have to also comment on the restricting,  even if it is just a little restricting.   I used to do alot of restricting and have now stopped,  my kids are just fine,  no sitting in front of the TV for hours or anything.<br/>
 <br/>
But I think what really got the idea through to me was that we don&#39;t know what will be the route of learning for our children,  or how exactly they will learn.  <br/>
 <br/>
     I was never ever going to own a video system.  I also hate violence.     I used to equate the two.    But what about my son who loves video games and computers,   he&#39;s  very mechanical and his mind works in strategic ways,   so he loves games and he loves action movies.  I don&#39;t really enjoy them, but does that mean he shouldn&#39;t be able to watch them?  Yes there might be some violence in them, but that doesn&#39;t make him violent.<br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;ll probably end up working with computers or engineering or building things or what ever; who knows what it can lead to.    But if he didn&#39;t have those mediums to learn he would really be limited,   he would possibly find something to do or maybe kind-of enjoy.  Who knows how long he would enjoy it.   But most likely it would be something that I would have felt he should be doing.  Not what he wanted to be doing.       There is where lies the difference.   <br/>
 <br/>
He would have been limited to my likes and he may have ended up in a hazey type of existence.   Asking himself--what do I really like? <br/>
 <br/>
It takes alot of open minded considering,  whether we want our kids to grow up how we want them to be or how they want themselves to be.        I vote with them becoming who they want to be!<br/>

If it is up to the individual or family then how are your children involved <br/>
in that.  It seems to me that what you mean is: it is up to you or the <br/>
adults, the children (as part of the family) have no say.  Therefore it isn&#39;t <br/>

learning train for a 100 mile cycle but I can still do my own thing. She is telling me what works but I have choices.<br/>

Having control over someone is not &#39;guidance&#39; to me.<br/>

DH watching Amrican Idol last night). Yesterday they played about an hour of Baldur&#39;s Gate on the computer. The rest of the time they have been reading, looking up NASA on the net and playing games with<br/>
a cardboard box.<br/>
<br/>
Even with unlimited TV they haven&#39;t watched it. Back when I used to limit it, it made the TV &#39;special&#39; so they would bug me to watch it. Same with the computer. Limiting led to addiction and tantrums<br/>
and unpleasantness over &#39;turns&#39;. All that is gone  and yet none of them have become TV or computer-holics.<br/>

respectful treatment of children is a *big* foundation to base discussion on<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My opinion&quot; doesn&#39;t get to what you&#39;re basing your decision on. There&#39;s no<br/>
basis on which to examine any practices that are based on &quot;opinion&quot;. I<br/>
brought up a number of points -- real life examples that show the dire<br/>
consequences that are feared did not happen -- that suggest that what you<br/>
are basing your decision on are falacies and fears. You haven&#39;t refuted<br/>
those points just fallen back on &quot;my personal opinion&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It is many people&#39;s opinion that children should be spanked when they<br/>
disobey. Just because it&#39;s their opinion, does that make it okay? Right for<br/>
their family? The best they could be doing?<br/>
<br/>
It is many people&#39;s opinion that children must go to school in order to<br/>
learn. And what do they base that opinion on? Do they have knowledge of kids<br/>
who haven&#39;t gone to school? Or are they basing it on what everyone else<br/>
thinks?<br/>
<br/>
Most people base their opinions on very little thought and fall back on<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s my opinion&quot; in order to stop the discussion.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It probably does depend on personality, but I wonder if instilling a love <br/>
of books first, then allowing more television later (when kids are older), <br/>
contributes to indifference. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is indifference the goal?<br/>
<br/>
Why would one have to instill a love of books?  Aren&#39;t they inherently <br/>
lovable?<br/>

Thanks to the great suggestions on this list I came home from the<br/>
library yesterday with:<br/>
    a Nintendo game guide (gungan frontier?)<br/>
    Mad magazine with star wars on the cover<br/>
&   a graphic novel version of Hitchiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy<br/>
	(I also threw in a documentary video about astronomy.)<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t stay &quot;strewn&quot; very long before they were snapped up.  I<br/>
guess it helps that the librarians have pretty cool taste.<br/>

I have just purchased the 2003 edition and it&#39;s another favorite of his.  He also likes joke books, _Outdoor Life_ magazine, and a  few comic books.  We have tried to suggest books to him but he has no interest in them.  At all.  He does love to cook so he reads recipes and directions frequently.   I just try to notice all of the things he reads thoughout the day and not worry about it.  (This is the kid who learned to read by looking at the TV Guide channel to see when his favorite shows were coming on!)  <br/>
<br/>
Just some more thoughts......<br/>

ps..Hey it snowed in Arkansas today!  Not enough to let schools out but there is 2-3 inches on the ground that my kids are thoroughly enjoying!  We haven&#39;t had any accumulation here for the past 2 or 3 years so the kids are just ecstatic.  Something I was thinking about......I remember when I was in school, the thrill of the possiblity of snow which also meant the possiblity of school being cancelled.  Then the disappointment when we had to go to school anyway.  What good was the snow if we couldn&#39;t miss school???  My kids are so happy just BECAUSE of the snow.  They are enjoying the peacefullness and the beauty without even a thought about whether they will get to miss school or not.  It&#39;s a little sad watching the snow falling and knowing the other kids in town are watching it through the windows...........<br/>
