<div id="ygrps-yiv-163563627">I think I have not been as clear as I would have liked.  I am<br/>
pretty familiar with public education from the 20&#39;s forward and<br/>
certainly have no illusions that there was ever a day of<br/>
universal belles lettres.   But I was not referring to the<br/>
cultural knowledge of the elite effete - but to the markers that<br/>
let you know you are part of a larger group and react as a<br/>
&quot;member/guest&quot; rather than as &quot;unknown/other&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time that enabling a child to identify the<br/>
jokes/inside lines/assumptions/taboos of the common (not the<br/>
high) culture was seen as having value in education.  A person<br/>
learning a trade would be consciously instructed in the history<br/>
and lore of the trade (thinking particularly of printers with<br/>
whom I am familiar).  A person whose community was limited to all<br/>
members of one faith would learn the holidays and observances of<br/>
that faith.   etiquette, as practiced by the group of which you<br/>
were a member, was taught directly and as a valuable part of<br/>
learning, whether it was the mountain superstitious etiquette of<br/>
entering and leaving by different doors or the copy book forms of<br/>
introductions.<br/>
<br/>
As the world has become smaller and the common culture more<br/>
diverse, I think we have substituted political correctness for an<br/>
honest instruction on cultural connections.  School, especially<br/>
government school, intensify the effect because of their very<br/>
bureaucratic nature.  The result seems to me to be the formation<br/>
of a substitute common culture by age peers, to replace a sense<br/>
of group that is not taught.  It is not an indictment of schools<br/>
to say that they are doing what has been asked of them, but it is<br/>
a call the think clearly about what it is we are asking.  Whether<br/>
one is fortunate enough to have the resources (not necessarily a<br/>
financial issue, so much as a disposition one) to allow children<br/>
to learn their own way or whether one is packing a lunch and<br/>
sending little Susie out the door every morning, we are all<br/>
spending much of our time in common culture with the product of<br/>
that request to emphasize drug avoidance and diversity over the<br/>
cues that tell us who we are.<br/>
