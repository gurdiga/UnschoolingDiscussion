Yes, with this further thought: It&#39;s OUR money to start with.<br/>
Ideally, we should (be allowed to) keep the money in the first place. No one<br/>
should be forced to pay for other people&#39;s children. If we help others, it<br/>
should be because we want to, not because our home will be confiscated if we<br/>
don&#39;t. This is America...do you have the right to take your neighbor&#39;s<br/>
property? If not, what gives the govenment such a right. The government was<br/>
created to protect our rights, not violate them.<br/>

Joanna writes, concerning vouchers:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I chose to take my children out of the system and i don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; anything else to do with it.  Asking for our fair share comes with a<br/>
&gt; whole lot more than we are bargaining for.  there is no getting<br/>
&gt; around that.<br/>
&gt; Joanna<br/>

I totally agree. No one should be required to have anything to do with (or<br/>
be forced to pay for) anything they do not use or don&#39;t approve of. That<br/>
would be tyranny.<br/>
<br/>
There are only two methods of dealing with people: Voluntarily, or by force.<br/>
Public schools get their funding by force -- the schools use a third party<br/>
(government) to collect their money for them by force.<br/>
<br/>
The voucher movement is a partial measure in recovering an element of choice<br/>
for parents, but the idea still leaves the fund collecting to the state and<br/>
its force, and that will be the next big issue -- making funding voluntary.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, if vouchers give just a few children the means of escaping from<br/>
horrible schools, then they get my support. Ultimately, the only fair<br/>
solution is for all school funding to be supported by the parents who choose<br/>
them, with a variety of private scholarship methods to help needy families.<br/>
<br/>
While the government schools are getting more and more oppressive and<br/>
despotic, there is a balancing movement, such as homeschooling and a growth<br/>
of private schooling, and growing awareness of the needs of growing<br/>
children. We are an integral part of that counter balance.<br/>
