<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955986878">On Friday, as part of my professional work (public policymaking around<br/>
alcohol and drug issues -- especially drug treatment), I got to attend a<br/>
lecture by the head of the Civitan International Research Center at the<br/>
University of Alabama at Birmingham.<br/>
<br/>
They have been conducted a 20-year-study on &quot;school outcomes&quot; in several<br/>
southern cities and towns.  Specifically, they have been tracking<br/>
children and families where the mothers became pregnant in their teens.<br/>
85% of them were high school dropouts; average IQ of the mothers was 71<br/>
(bordering on retarded.) Their main question is what could be done to<br/>
ensure &quot;school success&quot; among the children -- such success defined as<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; scores for reading and math, and at least high school<br/>
graduation.  All of this under the assumption that &quot;school success&quot; was<br/>
a good thing, because it would lead to improved lives in the next<br/>
generation.  Given the families they were working with, I think it is<br/>
fair not to question the assumption (even though we&#39;d all likely agree<br/>
it is quite narrow.)<br/>
<br/>
They divided the mothers into two groups -- one to receive intensive<br/>
home services for both mother and children in preschool years -- not<br/>
just academics for kids, but working with moms to get them to interact<br/>
better with their children, etc. etc.  The other group was a control<br/>
group.  Lo and behold, the provision of these intensive services proved<br/>
a great success, 5, 10, and even 15 years later.  The kids ended up with<br/>
IQs exactly at the mean, same with reading and math scores, same with<br/>
high school graduation rates, etc., etc.  Interesting too, 78% of those<br/>
mothers in families who received services went back and got their<br/>
G.E.D.s (as opposed to only about 20% of the control group.)  In the<br/>
control group, average IQ ended up at around 72, and there was a 75%<br/>
high school drop out rate, etc., etc.  (you can find all these results<br/>
on the Civitan website, which I think is www.circ.uab.edu<br/>
<br/>
But now the researchers tried something interesting.  They divided both<br/>
groups -- those receiving intensive services in preschool and the<br/>
control group -- in half again.  Half of each group received intensively<br/>
&quot;academic&quot; services in schools in grades K-3.  They specially trained<br/>
the teachers, provided &quot;one-on-one&quot; time with the teachers, smaller<br/>
class sizes, reading specialists, math specialists, the whole nine<br/>
yards.  For the control group, they treated the kids in school like<br/>
everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what?  Providing the intensive services in school had NO EFFECT<br/>
upon future &quot;school success&quot;!  Not a whit - and neither for those who<br/>
received the intensive pre-school services or the control group.  I&#39;ll<br/>
say that again -- for this population, intensive school services had no<br/>
effect on school success -- neither on reading, math, high school<br/>
dropout rates, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally there are those who will say this proves the need for<br/>
intensive interventions in families, at least for at-risk kids.  I won&#39;t<br/>
debate the point -- for kids in families like these, it probably is a<br/>
good thing.  But turn it around -- the studies show that it is the<br/>
quality of family life, not what goes on in school, that makes the big<br/>
difference in &quot;academic success&quot;.  Asked about this, the researchers<br/>
said it is clear that, for the child, especially the young child, there<br/>
is no useful distinction to be made between education and life -- they<br/>
are all of a piece and cannot be usefully distinguished.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are homeschooling parents out there who sometimes worry<br/>
about those things which their kids might be &quot;missing&quot; by not attending<br/>
school.  This study and lots of others should help allay fears -- what<br/>
is important is what is happening in your family.  Don&#39;t let all that<br/>
talk about &quot;education reform&quot; fool you -- it is all a smokescreen for a<br/>
system which is failing, and failing fast.  And at best, as this study<br/>
would seems to indicate, even on the school&#39;s own terms, what happens in<br/>
the classroom is irrelevant to children&#39;s future success, even as it is<br/>
damaging to the child&#39;s quality of life in the here and now.<br/>
