<div id="ygrps-yiv-613424492">I have used &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; with my two<br/>
oldest.  They were 3 and 4 at the time, and both had very different learning<br/>

each came to me on their own terms requesting to learn how to read.  (I know<br/>
3 & 4 is early to learn to read, but I follow their lead.)  As unschoolers,<br/>
it&#39;s the only time so far I have purposely taught them something from a<br/>
book, and only because they asked for it.  I wrote a post about the book on<br/>

<br/>
I highly recommend it to everyone who asks about teaching children how to<br/>
read.  It&#39;s a very easy system to follow.  My son (now 6) is a voracious<br/>
reader and is rarely without a book in his hands!  My 3yo daughter is almost<br/>
finished with the book...(after finishing the book your child will be<br/>

unschooler.  If someone&#39;s three year old is ready to read, he can  <br/>
learn with or without that book.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted to try it and we got it and she went through some of the  <br/>
word lists, but it&#39;s NOT &quot;a very easy system to follow,&quot; and worse  <br/>
than that, it is &quot;a system.&quot;  It adds yet another layer above  <br/>
phonics, involving different colors of letters.<br/>

puts one closer to school, not closer to unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-734918164">A warning about Phonics Abuse (aka reading lessons)...DON&#39;T DO IT!<br/>
<br/>
Your children will read when they are ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One way to teach reading:<br/>
<br/>
Sarah, now 16, learned to read at age 5, using Teach Your Child To Read in <br/>
100 Easy Lessons. We stopped at lesson 65 because she was bored.  This was <br/>
long before we started unschooling, and yet even I could tell she didn&#39;t <br/>
*need* that book.  She was just ready.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How NOT to teach reading:<br/>
<br/>
Andrew, now almost 15, learned to read at age 12. We had started *teaching* <br/>
him at age 6, and eventually had used every single phonics program out <br/>
there (just name one, we used it) until he was 11; he struggled, we both <br/>
cried, we fought, we struggled some more. He felt worthless, stupid, <br/>
retarded, like he couldn&#39;t do anything else either, and stopped trying to <br/>
learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
I finally got to a place where I laid it all down and stopped trying to <br/>
force him.  I had heard about unschooling, and I went back and re-read John <br/>
Holt and just finally decided in my heart that even if he *never* read, it <br/>
was okay, and would not be the defining moment in his life.  I apologized <br/>
to him, and continued to read to him, whenever he asked, for as long as he <br/>
liked.  Sometimes he would try to follow along, and would ask that I hold a <br/>
white index card under the lines as I read them, but mostly he just <br/>
listened.  It was not unusual for me to read three hours straight when he <br/>
wanted me to, with him snuggled up next to me on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Six months after that decision on my part, I bought him a manga book <br/>
(japanese graphic novel based on anime) that was based on his favorite <br/>
cartoon, Rurouni Kenshin, thanks to someone on UnschoolingDiscussion <br/>
mentioning it in a post. I told him I would read it to him that night, and <br/>
I meant it. He took it up to his room, and two hours later came back down <br/>
to tell me he had read it twice! That evening he read it to me!<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks after that he was reading the rule book to the Lord of the Rings <br/>
tabletop battle strategy game, written probably at a high school or early <br/>
college level.  He has continued to read at that level ever since.  His <br/>
favorite books to read are G.A. Henty novels, which are historical fiction <br/>
novels.  Now I have to sometimes ask him to take a break because we have <br/>
other plans. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
But he still says he can&#39;t read.  I don&#39;t know why, and I don&#39;t know how <br/>
long that will last.  It breaks my heart every time he says it because *I* <br/>
am the one that made him think that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably The Best Way to help a child who wants to read:<br/>
<br/>
I learned *my* lesson well, and now Aaron, who is five days shy of age 8, <br/>
is making many reading connections, in total freedom. He knows most of the <br/>
letters of the alphabet, and most of the sounds.  His world is saturated <br/>
with words and sounds.<br/>
<br/>
We write things with sidewalk chalk, we play Boggle Jr. when he asks, we <br/>
read books together (but not every day...we are so busy sometimes it just <br/>
falls through the cracks), and just a few weeks ago he sat on my lap while <br/>
I played Quiddler with two other women and helped me make words with my <br/>
cards, and learned all about how almost every word has at least one vowel, <br/>
and which ones were vowels.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other day he got a large Twix candy bar, and looked at it a long time <br/>
and said, 4 to gowhat does that mean?  Even though the words to and go look <br/>
similar, and no one had ever told him the difference, somehow he knew that <br/>
to was oo and go was the long o sound.<br/>
<br/>
Word games, rhyming games, letter games, story books, soup labels, candy <br/>
bars, street signs, shop signs, the tv guide, sidewalk chalk and finger <br/>
paints and Magnetic Poetry on the refrigerator.  Words are all around us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, before buying 100 Easy Lessons or any other program, PLEASE read <br/>
John Holt&#39;s book _Learning All The Time_.  Read it twice.  Read it three times.<br/>
<br/>
You can trust  your child to read.  Just because they ask, doesn&#39;t mean you <br/>
have to go out and buy anything.  Answer their questions, play games, read <br/>
to them, and Trust Them.<br/>

&quot;Real, natural learning is in the living. It&#39;s in the observing, the <br/>

in the Joy.&quot; ~Anne Ohman<br/>

I always enjoyed reading aloud to all my kids and that was probably<br/>
the best thing I could do with them.  <br/>

I sat down and tried using phonics workbooks with my first son.  I<br/>

learned that what I find an interesting read is not what my boys found<br/>
 interesting. Also, this guy remembers what he hears much better than<br/>
I.   <br/>
<br/>
I was a bit more laid back with my second son.  I did a little phonics<br/>
but started collecting Calvin and Hobbes which he loved and he would<br/>
sit for hours with those and that is where reading began for him.<br/>
Then, comic books and manga.  Now, he reads Chaim Potok, Isaac Asimov,<br/>
Tolkein, Dracula, and assorted things.  He picks up Scientific<br/>
American or National Geographic if he sees an article that interests<br/>
him.   <br/>
<br/>
My third is a daugher who I found trying to read Alphaphonics by her<br/>
night light one night.  She liked the funny sentences.  She liked<br/>
writing notes to me.  She liked word games.  Then, Calvin and Hobbes.<br/>
 She would occasionally ask for help with words. She is an excellent<br/>

<br/>
My fourth daughter did not do any phonics or lessons of any type.  I<br/>
read a lot to her.  Her older sister read a lot to her.  And, one day<br/>
she was reading on her own.  She now reads to her older sister and her<br/>
stuffed animals with wonderful infection.  She says, &quot;Can you imagine<br/>
not having anything to read?&quot;<br/>

him/her &quot;no&quot; because using that particular book to learn how to read would<br/>
not be &quot;unschooling&quot;?!?  I am letting my children lead the way in their<br/>
learning.  I had the book and they looked at it and both expressed a desire<br/>
to use it.  There is more than one way to learn how to read.  Unschooling to<br/>
me is letting my children decide.  I did not force this method on them, and<br/>
if at any point they didn&#39;t enjoy the book, we would stop.  If my children<br/>
wanted to use workbooks I would let them.  It&#39;s all up to them, it&#39;s not<br/>
about doing things a certain way or NOT doing things a certain way, it&#39;s<br/>
about letting the child decide.<br/>
<br/>

about unschooling.  Every child can learn at his or her own pace and in the<br/>
manner best suited for him.  Could my children have learned to read without<br/>
this book?  I&#39;m sure they would eventually.  But why would I withhold it<br/>
from them if it&#39;s what they wanted to do?  My son&#39;s favorite thing to do is<br/>
to read.  He has learned so much and his passion everyday about reading and<br/>
learning is amazing to watch.  If I had told him he couldn&#39;t use that book<br/>
to learn to read because it was a &quot;system&quot;, then he would have missed out on<br/>
so much that he loves, while trying to figure out how to read on his own.  I<br/>
want my children to follow their passions.  This book was an easy way for<br/>
them to learn to read.<br/>

don&#39;t see what the hurry is.<br/>
<br/>
But I honestly DO see that the pressure to read has roots in the  <br/>
distant past and in the puritanical 18th century (for Americans, who  <br/>
suffered a very puritanical time while some other countries just  <br/>
booted out their puritanical types &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Reading is harder, and listening to CDs is easier.  Therefor, reading  <br/>
is virtue and listening is sin.<br/>
<br/>
We need to look for that dynamic when we&#39;re making decisions.   <br/>
Kneejerk puritanism is at the root of a LOT of school.   Sit down and  <br/>
shut up or we&#39;ll hit you with a stick (cane, rod or ruler, depending  <br/>
on the local tradition).<br/>
<br/>
A kid who can read Lemony Snicket passingly well will NOT be as good  <br/>
as Tim Curry reading Lemony Snicket with voices.  (Most adults aren&#39;t  <br/>
either.)<br/>

teacher, could he?<br/>
Does he think you taught him to read?  Do you?  (I think you said you  <br/>
did, but I&#39;m not sure.)<br/>
<br/>
Thinking teaching is necessary keeps people from knowing it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids are reading and that&#39;s great.  Some kids couldn&#39;t possibly  <br/>
learn to read at three with or without all the books in the world,  <br/>
and that&#39;s important for the purposes of this list.<br/>

<br/>
One difference is that reading to them is doing something together and you both experience the story.  Do you listen with your child?<br/>
<br/>
Jackie (10) loves audiobooks and sometimes listens for hours.  She usually is doing something else at the same time - playing with toys, drawing, etc.  She usually listens in the kitchen, so I often listen too while cooking, etc.  Sometimes she listens in her room.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes listen to books, rather than read.  It&#39;s great for multi-tasking as I can use my hands for laundry or something else while listening.<br/>
<br/>
Even if all your child&#39;s books were listened to, rather than read, they would still encounter print in other daily activities - signs, packages, notes, computer.<br/>

The danger is in misunderstanding the child&#39;s desire to read.  The push for early reading is so pervasive in our society.  When a child says, &quot;I want to learn to read&quot;, it may not be their own desire but pressure from others (friends, grandparents maybe).<br/>
<br/>
While textbooks can be useful from time to time, many *beginning unschoolers* eagerly await the day when their child asks to use one, seeing that as child-led learning.  If a child and/or parent thinks that learning means the parent gets out a particular book to learn a particular subject, then unschooling isn&#39;t really happening yet in that family.<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Teaching a Child to Read ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I guess I am the slow learner.  I took me 10 years to figure out that<br/>
&gt; kids do not need to be taught to read but will read when they are<br/>
&gt; ready, when it is something they are interested in, and when it is fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always enjoyed reading aloud to all my kids and that was probably<br/>
&gt; the best thing I could do with them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sat down and tried using phonics workbooks with my first son.  I<br/>
&gt; helped him sound out books that I thought were good ones.  He read,<br/>
&gt; but did not love it until he began reading computer stuff. From this I<br/>
&gt; learned that what I find an interesting read is not what my boys found<br/>
&gt; interesting. Also, this guy remembers what he hears much better than<br/>
&gt; I.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was a bit more laid back with my second son.  I did a little phonics<br/>
&gt; but started collecting Calvin and Hobbes which he loved and he would<br/>
&gt; sit for hours with those and that is where reading began for him.<br/>
&gt; Then, comic books and manga.  Now, he reads Chaim Potok, Isaac Asimov,<br/>
&gt; Tolkein, Dracula, and assorted things.  He picks up Scientific<br/>
&gt; American or National Geographic if he sees an article that interests<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My third is a daugher who I found trying to read Alphaphonics by her<br/>
&gt; night light one night.  She liked the funny sentences.  She liked<br/>
&gt; writing notes to me.  She liked word games.  Then, Calvin and Hobbes.<br/>
&gt; She would occasionally ask for help with words. She is an excellent<br/>
&gt; reader and loves foreign languages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My fourth daughter did not do any phonics or lessons of any type.  I<br/>
&gt; read a lot to her.  Her older sister read a lot to her.  And, one day<br/>
&gt; she was reading on her own.  She now reads to her older sister and her<br/>
&gt; stuffed animals with wonderful infection.  She says, &quot;Can you imagine<br/>
&gt; not having anything to read?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
This was not the case in our family.  No one we know would ever push a 3 or<br/>
4 year old to learn to read.  I believe that is very early and it would<br/>
never have been my idea.  There is no pressure for my kids to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;While textbooks can be useful from time to time, many *beginning<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unschoolers* eagerly await the day when their child asks to use one, seeing<br/>
&gt; that as child-led learning.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> While that may be true for others, it&#39;s certainly not the case for me.  The<br/>
appeal of unschooling to me was the lack of teaching materials and structure<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  If a child and/or parent thinks that learning means the parent gets out a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; particular book to learn a particular subject, then unschooling isn&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; happening yet in that family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree.  My son learns from books every day.  If he wants to learn about<br/>
human anatomy, he takes out one of his many books on the subject.  How is<br/>
that not unschooling?<br/>

American.<br/>
<br/>
We went yesterday.  I had been the day before, with Holly.  I had  <br/>
brought my own book, and saw him standing in front of the wall rack  <br/>
of magazines.  I said &quot;There&#39;s a Scientific American over there&quot; and  <br/>
showed him the corner table and he picked it right up.<br/>
<br/>
We used to get it until a couple of years ago, but it wasn&#39;t being  <br/>
read as well as some others.  I&#39;m kinda thinking of getting it again  <br/>
because Marty reads that every time he goes there and then tells me  <br/>
the cool things he read (yesterday it was that the time/space  <br/>
continuum might be liquid), but he never has twenty minutes he has to  <br/>
just sit at home, and I doubt he would read it here.  He&#39;s really  <br/>
busy lately.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t taught to read.  His breakthrough came with a player&#39;s  <br/>
guide, bought used.  I cut the binding off and put every page in a  <br/>
sheet protector and he decorated a canvas-covered three-ring binder  <br/>
for it.  By the time he got tired of that video game, he could read,  <br/>
too.  Breath of Fire III, I think.  I photographed it for the book  <br/>
Moving a Puddle, but it&#39;s in black and white there.  I&#39;ll put it  <br/>
here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/sandra">http://sandradodd.com/r/sandra</a> .  He still owns it, and it&#39;s  <br/>
more raggedy than it once was.  There&#39;s also a photo of the first  <br/>
book Holly read.  The one after that was The Body, by Stephen King  <br/>
(which isn&#39;t technically a book, but a novella; for a second reading  <br/>
choice, it&#39;s book enough).<br/>

  This is how it was with my oldest.  At 4 she wanted to know how to read. She only had an older cousin that is 2 years older. No one even thought about her reading.  She wanted to know what the things on the page meant.  She learned very quickly and hasn&#39;t stopped reading since.  <br/>
   <br/>
  NOW my middle child reads ONLY when she has too. She will read if she is playing a game or other instructions. But she does not get 12 books from the library every other week.  <br/>

and amblyopia (inward turning of one eye and and bit of a loss of vision in <br/>
that eye).  She is not a visual person.  Even when I do read to her she does <br/>
other stuff - plays with toys or draws.  Its difficult for her to read <br/>
regular print - she wears glasses which helps but its fustrating for her to <br/>
look at small (regular size) letters/words.   She writes alot (I spell) and <br/>
that seems to be where she is picking up word recognition.<br/>

&gt; =-=-=-=-=-=Is there much of a difference in the benefit of reading to your <br/>
&gt; child versus them listening to books on CD??=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One difference is that reading to them is doing something together and you <br/>
&gt; both experience the story.  Do you listen with your child?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jackie (10) loves audiobooks and sometimes listens for hours.  She usually <br/>
&gt; is doing something else at the same time - playing with toys, drawing, <br/>
&gt; etc.  She usually listens in the kitchen, so I often listen too while <br/>
&gt; cooking, etc.  Sometimes she listens in her room.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sometimes listen to books, rather than read.  It&#39;s great for <br/>
&gt; multi-tasking as I can use my hands for laundry or something else while <br/>
&gt; listening.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if all your child&#39;s books were listened to, rather than read, they <br/>
&gt; would still encounter print in other daily activities - signs, packages, <br/>
&gt; notes, computer.<br/>

Do they follow along with the Harry Potter books in the books as it is read <br/>
to them???? If not how is that helping them to put the words with the sounds <br/>
they make or at least see how the word looks that is being read to them?? <br/>
Does any of that matter?? Can the child read??<br/>

read as much as I would if she didn&#39;t listen to them.  But when I do, my<br/>

&gt;I guess I am the slow learner.  I took me 10 years to figure out that<br/>
&gt; kids do not need to be taught to read but will read when they are<br/>
&gt; ready, when it is something they are interested in, and when it is fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always enjoyed reading aloud to all my kids and that was probably<br/>
&gt; the best thing I could do with them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sat down and tried using phonics workbooks with my first son.  I<br/>
&gt; helped him sound out books that I thought were good ones.  He read,<br/>
&gt; but did not love it until he began reading computer stuff. From this I<br/>
&gt; learned that what I find an interesting read is not what my boys found<br/>
&gt; interesting. Also, this guy remembers what he hears much better than<br/>
&gt; I.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was a bit more laid back with my second son.  I did a little phonics<br/>
&gt; but started collecting Calvin and Hobbes which he loved and he would<br/>
&gt; sit for hours with those and that is where reading began for him.<br/>
&gt; Then, comic books and manga.  Now, he reads Chaim Potok, Isaac Asimov,<br/>
&gt; Tolkein, Dracula, and assorted things.  He picks up Scientific<br/>
&gt; American or National Geographic if he sees an article that interests<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My third is a daugher who I found trying to read Alphaphonics by her<br/>
&gt; night light one night.  She liked the funny sentences.  She liked<br/>
&gt; writing notes to me.  She liked word games.  Then, Calvin and Hobbes.<br/>
