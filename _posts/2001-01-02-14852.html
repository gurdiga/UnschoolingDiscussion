<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071292392">Hi all. Hope you all had a great holiday. Ours was nice but our 13 month<br/>
old came down with what appears to be a stomach flu on Saturday. He had<br/>
been acting sluggish all day and so I kept him close and nursed him more<br/>
than usual but he seemed comforted by it. Saturday night he began<br/>
vomiting and then came the diarreha.  He slept most of Sunday. Waking to<br/>
nurse and takes sips of juice as well.  He had a fever on Sunday up to<br/>
102.7 so I decided not give him anything and let this run it&#39;s course. I<br/>
camped out in bed with him all day nursing on demand and cleaning up<br/>
when he would vomit.<br/>
<br/>
He slept most of that night and by Monday morning was doing better. He<br/>
got out of our bed and played with some toys and smiled and giggled. He<br/>
looked better but tired and worn out from being sick. By the afternoon<br/>
I noticed he was not nursing much but was taking some fluids from a cup.<br/>
I was concerned as he was not eating still. No interest when offered<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime I put him to the breast he gags and appears like he is going to<br/>
vomit. He did nurse late last night while half asleep. I am not sure<br/>
honestly how long as I was rather sleepy myself. I would think it was a<br/>
good 5 mins and then he made this horrible gagging noise pulled off and<br/>
rolled over to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
This morning he woke up to eat some dry cereal and have some juice. His<br/>
coloring looks good and he appears stronger than yesterday. Still a bit<br/>
clingy but he looks good. No fever and when he drinks his juice or eats<br/>
some cereal or crackers he doesnt gag. He fell down and I picked him up<br/>
and went to nurse him like I normally do when he has a boo boo. He went<br/>
to nurse than gaged.<br/>
<br/>
I am engorged , in pain and feeling like this kid hates me at the<br/>
moment. ( I know that is not true but...) I did notice he has a new<br/>
molar comming in and wonder if that might be the trouble. You would<br/>
think after 5 kids I would have this down but I have never had one of my<br/>
kids suddenly stop nursing like this.  I am not sure if he is weaning or<br/>
if he thinks if he drinks his &quot;ni ni&quot; he will vomit again or if the<br/>
teething is causing this.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody had this happen to them??  Ideas???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Shelly</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481474577">You might want to do a search at LLLI for &#39;nursing <br/>
strike.&#39;  It&#39;s never happened to me apart from one <br/>
night when dd couldn&#39;t get to sleep, she nursed and <br/>
nursed to the point where she was &#39;gizened,&#39; I ended up <br/>
rubbing her back and singing while she fell asleep, it <br/>
took hours!  Think about the basic stuff, like <br/>
expressing to relieve pressure when engorged, look <br/>
after yourself, look at your diet, etc.  <br/>

Hasn&#39;t happened to me, but it does sound like a nursing strike. I think the<br/>
first thing I would do was make sure he&#39;s not in any pain when he&#39;s trying<br/>
to nurse (mouth sores, etc.). I&#39;ve read of kids striking for a week or two<br/>
and suddenly going right back to nursing like nothing has happened.<br/>
Hopefully this will be your case. Maybe walk around with your shirt off all<br/>
day? LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My thirteen month old also had a bug with similar symptoms.  He did <br/>
continue to nurse while he refused solid food, but vomitted (like a <br/>
fountain!) immediately after nursing.  This only happened a handful <br/>
of times.  He did not seem bothered by it at all and would usually <br/>
doze off afterwards.  His diapers were yellow and mucousy.  He hasn&#39;t <br/>
vomited at all this week but is still refusing most solid foods.  <br/>
Diapers are the same but he is active and spunky.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the vomitting in my little guy, could be due to the excessive <br/>
draining down the back of his throat.  At the same time my baby had <br/>
the sickies, I lost my voice for nearly a week.  While I couldn&#39;t <br/>
talk, I was constantly gagging from all the draining.  I knew how to <br/>
get it out but I guess my little guy didn&#39;t :-(<br/>
