<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129362488">I used to be just like you shared...I would clean for the weeks leading up to Christmas...bake the entire week of Christmas...and on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we had lot of company to tend to.  I never felt like I had a spare moment during the holidays.  I didn&#39;t make an official decision to stop doing this, but somehow I have adapted to a more simple lifestyle over the past three years or so.  Christmas Day was splendid -- we awoke, opened presents, started the turkey, then hubby, myself and our 4 year old climbed back into bed for a nap, while the older two (ages 12 and 14) had fun with their gifts and chatted online with friends and family far away about their goodies.  When we woke up for the second time, we headed over to my sister&#39;s home to exchange gifts, stayed for about 2 hours and then headed home where we tidied up and relaxed the rest of the evening and night.  <br/>
<br/>
Today has been a wonderfully lazy day as well....leftovers, movies, and jammies pretty much sums it up.  Oh, and &#39;warm&#39; chocolate as Mattie enjoys.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My two sisters&#39; families and mine get together around 11 am for brunch. <br/>
One of us brings fruit and muffins/bread, one brings a potato <br/>
casserole, and the one whose house it is at makes scrambled eggs. We <br/>
ask the young adult kids who live on their own (in their 20&#39;s) to bring <br/>
a half gallon of juice or milk. Somebody brings coffee and cream. <br/>
That&#39;s about it. Some years somebody gets a honeybaked ham. My sister&#39;s <br/>
in-laws are Mexican and always have tamales on Christmas Eve and most <br/>
years she has a whole bunch of those left from the night before.<br/>
<br/>
We put out all the food and people serve themselves - buffet style.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
We have a great time - we play games, watch family videos, talk, go for <br/>
a walk, and ended the day watching episodes of West Wing season 3, <br/>
which my sister had gotten as a gift.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never done a Christmas meal.  I think it&#39;s not worth it.  <br/>
<br/>
We did a little buffet the Sunday before Christmas for a card playing party <br/>
with some out-of-town visitors (and invited over the locals they would like to <br/>
hang out with).    I made food a few times over the weekend and let people <br/>
know.  I delivered food to Kirby where he was playing Halo II online a couple of <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
We hung out, talked, watched videos, messed with the firewood, had a few <br/>
guests in for short whiles, and nobody stressed about anything, but Holly had a <br/>
battery-operated sorting bank that quit working.  So I have to decide whether to <br/>
mess with sending it back or just give it a respectful burial-at-dumpster.<br/>

<br/>
Since I am nowhere near a gourmet cook, we generally order a fully cooked<br/>
meal from a market. Last year we used Gelson&#39;s in Los Angeles, which was a<br/>
little pricey (4 adults), but this year we are in Galveston and got a cooked<br/>
turkey dinner with sides, bread rolls and pies from Krogers (Ralphs chain)<br/>
for under $50.00. We were only three adults and Jayn eating and so we have<br/>
half a turkey and a bunch of other leftovers for sandwiches and lunches in<br/>
the days following. <br/>
<br/>
BTW my dh did all the work of reheating the foods both this year and last,<br/>
while Jayn and I set the table together. <br/>
<br/>
Next year my mother will be gone from this life. I have no idea whether my<br/>
FIL will want to spend the season with us, or his brother and SIL and their<br/>
family. Or he may choose to work over the holidays to free some young doctor<br/>
with kids from a shift in the ER, and escape sad memories. We may be living<br/>
in our current home, or someplace else. We may be in the USA, or traveling.<br/>
Next year will be the start of new traditions, in a sense free from the<br/>
obligations to various family members on both sides that have felt<br/>
increasingly limiting to us, to tell the truth. It&#39;s all new from now on.<br/>
<br/>
We traveled to Galveston, TX on the gulf coast, expecting the usual balmy<br/>
Christmas weather not unlike what we have experienced in Los Angeles. Every<br/>
10 or 12 years this part of the world gets a sprinkling of snow. This year<br/>
there has been several inches of snow on Christmas Eve. This has been the<br/>
most on the ground on record. To our amazement we had a white Christmas, the<br/>
first in my memory and my mother&#39;s last. <br/>
<br/>
I asked her if she could remember having a white Christmas at any time while<br/>
traveling in Europe when I was young - our childhoods in Australia feature<br/>
summer Christmases. Her answer revealed some confusion I think, since she<br/>
was talking about a school that she attended as a child, but I&#39;m thinking<br/>
she is possibly just transposing names, and it was while I was at some<br/>
school in Europe. I don&#39;t remember. I spent much of my childhood in Hong<br/>
Kong, another part of the world where snow is very rare.<br/>

snipped &lt;&lt;What are we teaching our kids - to run around like crazy and never<br/>
relax for a moment?  Does anyone else feel like I do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had times like that in the past and just don&#39;t do it anymore. Not worth<br/>
it for me or the family. Holidays, or any kind of event for us is sharing it<br/>
all together. That&#39;s what makes it fun.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas eve we have our own tradition of eating take out. This year it was<br/>
Chinese. Joe and the 2 younger girls cleaned up the kitchen while I wrapped<br/>
presents. The kids are showered early, Tara goes with her dads family for<br/>
the eve and comes home later. Joe and I and the 3 kids here bake cookies and<br/>
watch a movie. This year it was Elf. My pot of sauce gets made in the<br/>
evening for the next day and that&#39;s a sure sign, or smell that Christmas is<br/>
on it&#39;s way. We snack and enjoy the evening and the kids head to bed around<br/>
midnight. That&#39;s when Joe and I take out all the gifts and place them under<br/>
and around the tree.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas day doesn&#39;t start very early. I think this year it was around 9.<br/>
Joe goes and gets donuts while the kids run around waking everyone up. This<br/>
year the 3 younger ones were running around the house all excited and my<br/>
oldest stumbles out of her room, still sleepy because the kids woke her and<br/>
mumbles &quot;Ah, to be young again!!!!&quot; She&#39;s not quite yet 19!!! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
After opening the gifts the turkey gets put in. We spend about the next hour<br/>
taking the kids toys out of the impossible boxes they pack them in these<br/>
days. It&#39;s a day where we all sit around and play. I may stuff some<br/>
mushrooms and put the sauce on but mostly we all just relax. Some cousins<br/>
and other family come later in the afternoon and it&#39;s still all relaxed. I<br/>
make sure the food is all easy do ahead or not time consuming. I enjoy the<br/>
day just as much as everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I had our homeschooling group party here this year again. 15 adults and 23<br/>
kids. I enjoyed that party too. Some of us made some food and we ordered<br/>
some platters from the grocery store. All very easy. I&#39;m a good hostess, but<br/>
I always want to be a fun one too!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111399205">I&#39;m exhausted too, but boy is it a great EXHAUSTED feeling :o)<br/>
<br/>
I am beat from baking a zillion different kinds of goodies over the last <br/>
several days.  The wrapping of presents made my fingers tired.  The traveling to <br/>
see dh&#39;s family and my family, each a 3 hour drive each way from our house, <br/>
within 3 days of eachother, has left me feeling like I must permanently stretch <br/>
my legs.  <br/>
<br/>
But...we had a splendid Christmas with only the 4 of us.  We all enjoyed the <br/>
goodies while opening gifts early in the morning.  My fingers remembered the <br/>
tired feeling again when every toy seemed to be wired 50 different ways in <br/>
every package.  We went nowhere so I we all stretched out all day.  The phone was <br/>
our connection to all of our loved ones as we shared stories about the day <br/>
over and over again.  We all just got out of our pj&#39;s tonite and had bubble baths <br/>
to get into more pj&#39;s. Our boys, 6 and 3 are sleeping soundly, although I&#39;m <br/>
not sure how when the beds are shared with every new item from gameboys to <br/>
socks.  Hubby is reading the paper and I am happy to be typing this now but I am <br/>
beat from the whirlwind of activity from the last several days but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
trade a minute of it.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t make any huge dinner.  We got a bunch of different <br/>
snacks-cheeses, crackers, breads, sausages, veggies, dips.  That kinda thing and just <br/>
snacked all day.  Self serve.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe go for the Mickey D&#39;s or the snacks or have everyone bring a dish.  <br/>
Whatever it takes for you to get to enjoy it all too.  Don&#39;t waste time in the <br/>
kitchen, spend it with the kids and all the others.  You might be surprised that <br/>
informal is so appreciated.  I thought my mom would have a fit if we didn&#39;t <br/>
do some big dinner but she was relieved when I said that lets just have snacks <br/>
and stuff when we visit so we can REALLY visit.  Everyone loves a good meal <br/>
but life is too short to spend it in the kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays!!!!<br/>

&gt;like me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty tired, but don&#39;t feel like i went to *too* much trouble, <br/>
it helps because i have two sisters and we sort of all share the <br/>
responsibility for getting a meal on the table. (For some reason, <br/>
the men in the family, my brothers, think the food just <br/>
magically appears there.)<br/>
<br/>
We do Xmas eve for family-present opening, start late (maybe 7pm or <br/>
so, although people show up earlier and hang out)...we have a meat <br/>
tray and &quot;pickle&quot; (olive, cheese etc)tray for sandwiches, and lots <br/>
of homemade cookies. Christmas morning, santa came, and then dinner <br/>
was served around 3p. But we do a buffett, so it mostly involved <br/>
heating up the ham and the lasangna, opening cans of stuff and <br/>
heating it up, and then everyone serves themselves. <br/>
<br/>
The only real hard part was that i ended up staying up really late <br/>
thurs night making chocolate chip cookies (shouldve made the dough <br/>
earlier), and lasangna (which is better if it sits overnight at <br/>
least), and then stayed up really late friday night helping santa <br/>
wrap presents. Then saturday had to help my mom get ready (shower)<br/>
and clean a little. <br/>
<br/>
It helps if you have alot of family to chip in and help, have people <br/>
bring a dish, and have relaxed standards as far as cleaning <br/>
and &quot;perfection&quot; of the meal. We are *really* laid back here, and <br/>
yet my sister still frets about whether she&#39;s doing a good enough <br/>
job. Growing up my mom never sat down during a holiday dinner and <br/>
was always running around offering more food, or in the kitchen. Now <br/>
that she&#39;s in a wheelchair, she&#39;s enjoying having people wait on her <br/>
all the time. <br/>
<br/>
Seamus is off spending the week with his father, so i&#39;ve gone from <br/>
toy-fun-hysteria (was up last night at 3am combining liquids for his <br/>
SuperFuel Lab racer thing, putting together a Fire and Ice Dragon <br/>
set, and playing with the robosapien), to a really quiet and calm <br/>
house and a bed to myself tonight. <br/>

Everyone loves a good meal <br/>
but life is too short to spend it in the  kitchen.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;G&gt; And *I* thought life was too short to spend it anywhere  else! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Solstice we had a half-dozen or so for hot bean soup, bread, and  <br/>
marshmallows/s&#39;mores by the new fire pit out in the side yard.<br/>
 <br/>
German &quot;kalte Platte&quot; (cold cuts) for Christmas Eve.  <br/>
 <br/>
Christmas Day, we had twelve for dinner starting at noon. Italian. In my  <br/>
&quot;new&quot; dining room that I just re-did last week. Patrick brought an anti  <br/>
pasta---three trays of Italian meats and cheeses and pickles and veggies. Then  we sat <br/>
down for the pasta dish---angel hair pasta with a goat cheese sauce and  <br/>
shrimp. The main course was chicken picatta with ratatouille. Next was a  salad. <br/>
Several bottles of wine. Dessert: well, I made a cheesecake, Gillian  brought a <br/>
tart lemon sorbet, and Barbara brought a vanilla ice cream-custard. We  <br/>
finished dinner at about 4:30. &lt;g&gt; But I get into this cooking stuff!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve been eating left-overs since. We&#39;ll have 20-30 over on New Year&#39;s Day  <br/>
drop-in for ham, collards, hoppin&#39; Johns, and cornbread----all for good  luck <br/>
in the new year. Y&#39;all are welcome to come---after dark on Saturday!<br/>
 <br/>
Between now & then, Ben & I will celebrate 19 years of marriage on  the 28th. <br/>
While waiting for _Finding Neverland_ to start this afternoon, he  leaned <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298080822">We&#39;re at my dad&#39;s house in Tucson. We did a &quot;big&quot; Christmas meal, I guess - we had beef wellington, cheese frosted cauliflower, mashed potatoes, and &quot;heavenly carrots&quot; (carrots in brown sugar and butter). We got a Trader Joe&#39;s chocolate torte for dessert. Everyone got what they wanted, really. My dad took my grandma to church and then brought her over, my sister came over early and we did dinner together, and Rain alternated between helping with the cooking and chatting with her great grandma. She did the mashed potatoes herself...<br/>
<br/>
The beef was the only hard part. We started it and the whole oven started to smoke (leftover pizza drips, says my dad) so we had to stop, turn it off, take out the meat, over the windows and doors, and clean it off as best we could (later I demonstrated how his self-cleaning oven worked - he was widowed 3 years ago and it had been at least that long). Then we realized that my dad only had self-rising flour, instead of all-purpose, so my sister went on a quick trip to the grocery store. The crust part was difficult, and I had to make more crust mix as my sister tried to cover the meat with it... but we laughed a lot and it was kind of a fun bonding thing. Dinner was an hour late, but no one minded. My did served drinks and munchies, my grandma drank a few glasses of wine and told Rain lots of old stories, and even some new ones (she also forgot it was Christmas, which was a little worrisome - she&#39;s 91 and the nursing home looms). It was a communal effort, and even though I was nominally in charge of dinner, it didn&#39;t feel like a huge thing.<br/>
<br/>
I really think it could have been stressful, but we all have a pretty easy-going attitude. Rain doesn&#39;t eat red meat, but she was fine with the other stuff. I&#39;ve never cooked any beef that cost $13 a pound, so I was slightly worried that I would ruin $35 worth of meat, but it was really good.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we did my grandma&#39;s gifts with her (we opened ours earlier) and hung out. Later my dad drove her home and I did some dishes, and that evening my dad and I did the rest of the dishes, then drove to Winterhaven and walked around and looked at lights.<br/>
<br/>
It was a small get-together, really, because my brother is a TI and couldn&#39;t come home (although he called from San Antonio). We really had 5 different generations going - my grandma (91), my dad (61), me (36), my sister (24), and Rain (almost 12). Okay, 4 generations and a half-step in the middle. No small children, although my grandma needed pretty constant attention.<br/>
<br/>
Things are more stressful in the kitchen when my dad&#39;s girlfriend is around, because she doesn&#39;t take minor disasters in stride very well.<br/>

Wow!  I don&#39;t know if you all feel like me but I&#39;m  exhausted!??  I just <br/>

all over again as tons of folks came by for Xmas  visits, food, and drinks!!  <br/>

do?    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
My husband and I share the chores, and Will does some of them, too.   When <br/>
the older boys were home, we all cleaned the house (me giving them specific  <br/>
tasks I knew they were willing to do), and Charles and I shared the cooking. It  <br/>
seems like we all know what needs to be done to get ready for guests, and they <br/>
 all pitch in, knowing I&#39;m going to ask them to help, anyway.  <br/>
 <br/>
This year Charles happened to do most of the clean up while I sat in the  <br/>
living room with my parents and my son before he leaves for Iraq on the  10th.   <br/>
We shared the cooking as usual.  I made a list of  what we needed to make, and <br/>
we just got started.  In fact, when my dad  asked who to compliment about the <br/>
gravy, Charles and I had to think  back through what we did to figure out who <br/>
made it. We didn&#39;t plan it  that way or negotiate it.  It just happened.   <br/>
After dinner I was  more interested in being with the family and letting the <br/>
dishes wait, and he was  more interested in listening from the kitchen while <br/>
getting the dishes  done.  <br/>
 <br/>
One thing I know is true about me.  I don&#39;t have any ownership over  the <br/>
dishes!  I don&#39;t care who does them, and I don&#39;t care if the kitchen is  cleaned <br/>
up before I sit down to chat.  I&#39;d much rather spend my time with  my family <br/>
and doing other things than cleaning up.  Housework can  WAIT!  I know that <br/>
sometimes doing the dishes and putting the food away can  be a social event, too.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t work out that way this year.  <br/>
 <br/>
And I don&#39;t rush around all the time prior to Christmas getting things  <br/>
ready.  Will and I decorated the tree together, and the housework got done  <br/>
piecemeal.  I usually take one day before Christmas where I farm out the  kids (Will <br/>
is the only one left) for a play day or a day with Gram, and I spend  that day <br/>
wrapping presents, cleaning off my desk, taking me time, going in the  stores <br/>
Will hates to go in, or whatever.  It feels more like rushing if I  have to <br/>
do all that stuff while taking care of the kids.  So I save all the  tasks I <br/>
know I&#39;d rather do alone for whatever reason for that day.  <br/>
 <br/>
I say holidays are a family affair and the whole family should be  involved.  <br/>
Mom should let go of the ownership of it, and get dad at least  to pitch in.  <br/>
Certainly ask for help.<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I invite family over on a different day.  They like to see what the <br/>
kids get for Christmas, so we celebrate one day all by ourselves and <br/>
then have family over the next day.  <br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t celebrated Christmas yet because dh had to work Christmas <br/>
this year.  He&#39;s off the 28th -31st, so we&#39;re having our Christmas on <br/>
the 29th this year.  The kids don&#39;t mind at all...they look at it the <br/>
same way they look at it when we sometimes have a birthday party on a <br/>
day other than the actual birthday.  No big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
Our Christmas schedule this year looks like this: <br/>
24th-Christmas at dh&#39;s parents&#39; house<br/>
25th-Christmas at my parents&#39; house<br/>
26th-Christmas at dh&#39;s aunts&#39; house<br/>
27th-traveling to visit my grandma, uncle, aunt, and cousins (we&#39;re <br/>
leaving soon!)<br/>
28th-our Christmas eve at home<br/>
29th-our Christmas at home<br/>
30th-dh&#39;s parents and aunt coming to our house for a meal and to see <br/>
what the kids got<br/>
Jan 2-my parents coming to our house for a meal and to see what the <br/>
kids got.  <br/>
<br/>
So we do all the running around and all the cleaning the house and <br/>
making meals for company, but everything is spread out over a week <br/>
and a half. <br/>
<br/>
Also, after wrestling with the cleaning issue for a long time, I <br/>
decided to go ahead and hire someone to come help me clean once a <br/>
week, so I&#39;ve had help cleaning the house this month and it&#39;s made <br/>
Christmas cleaning a LOT less stressful.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699550828">Every year since the kids were babies we stay home (we&#39;re the only ones in the immediate family here that have kids).  Kids open presents; family trickles in starting around 10 or so.  Sister brings banana bread (I&#39;ve usually made a cranberry nut bread), brother brings egg nog.  Sometime around noon, hubby puts in a roast beef and pan roasted potatoes, my father brings rolls and pies, and we eat in the early afternoon.  Low stress, low pressure.  Nobody cooks all day, everyone helps clean up, and we sit around talking and munching cookies and chocolates and playing with the kids&#39; toys.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m with the others.  It&#39;s totally okay to cut back, especially on food <br/>
prep, as that is unlikely to be a kid&#39;s favorite part of Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
My friend with three kids (noq ages 7 to 11) said she had a better <br/>
holiday this year than in the past because the kids at this age were <br/>
much more helpful.  (Her husband only pitches in when nagged vigorously <br/>
and she gets tired from doing that!)  The kids did most of the <br/>
decorating, were very enthusiastic about sharing the food prep at both <br/>
Thanksgiving and Xmas, and (one final miracle &lt;g&gt;) when they did a Xmas <br/>
art project they set it up (by her suggestion) and cleaned it up by <br/>
themselves!<br/>
<br/>
So I just wanted to hold out hope that in a few short years you won&#39;t be <br/>
doing all this by yourself.  And if you can really stretch your <br/>
imagination, some day you&#39;ll have adult children and you&#39;ll want THEM to <br/>
do all the cooking so that you can spend the whole day adoring your <br/>
grandkids.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389357204">Well, thanks to all who responded.  When your daughter doesn&#39;t know you were in the house for the past two days, something has to give! Next year it is a prime rib roast put in the oven ahead of time with mashed potatoes and a veggie and NO MORE!  Xmas day will be PJ day and the day after family day - that will work well for us all.<br/>
<br/>
So, now my next task is to have that very difficult conversation with my Mother who buys my children sooooo many presents that their heads are spinning and I&#39;m frantic cleaning up wrapping paper and wondering how I&#39;m going to integrate all that stuff into my household.  Every year I tell her not so much and every year it is crazy.  My four are her only grandchildren and she doesn&#39;t see that I&#39;d prefer a big fat savings bond for their futures rather than toys that end up at good will in a short period of time.  Also, she and my husband are the ones that push for the big traditional family sit down dinner.  But, I&#39;m going to put my foot down and be unpopular for a while and hope my Mother honors my wishes.<br/>

Thanks for the comments,<br/>

&gt; complaining about the &quot;mess&quot; -when she is around i have to remind her to just leave <br/>
&gt; it-the kids have always loved it.<br/>
&gt; grace<br/>
&gt; who is still finding bits and pieces to pick up.........<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Us too.  I love wading through piles of paper and boxes!!!  It is SOOO <br/>
festive!  It&#39;s like more decorations.  Our 3 year old came out to me in the kitchen <br/>
yesterday with about 6 bows stuck to himself and later DH and I had quite a <br/>
laugh while our 6 year old ran around the house with a piece of wrapping paper <br/>
stuck to his rear end.  It was funny because it had been torn off with only a <br/>
pic of Santa&#39;s face left.  When we finally told him, he pulled it off and <br/>
giggled and then stuck it to his chest like a sticker.  FUN...<br/>

that a few times and Josh felt very, very let down. Why not ask her to <br/>
give some presents and then some cash so the kids (it should still be <br/>
their decision what to do with the cash) can use it for things they <br/>
wanted but did not get OR save it for some big thing they want but you <br/>
are not interested in spending your money on. That&#39;s how Josh got all <br/>
his game systems.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So do it at her or someone else&#39;s house. For that matter if its such a <br/>
big deal to hubby I would be suggesting that he might want to:<br/>
A. pitch in more<br/>
B. do without<br/>
C. take you to a nice Christmas day buffet<br/>
<br/>
I will admit that I was just exhausted on Christmas, we never made it to <br/>
Mass because I had fallen back asleep in front of the fireplace. Partly <br/>
due to the huge amount of wine I went through on Friday, spiced tea is <br/>
better with wine and I drank way to many, and also because I left too <br/>
many things till the last minute. Luckily we go to Mom and Dad&#39;s on <br/>
Christmas so even if I (well dh and I) was cooking, I did not have to <br/>
worry about cleaning the house. That last week (parties and working and <br/>
shopping and snow/sleet storms) before Xmas was hard and since I had to <br/>
work all day Sunday I ended up sleeping until 1pm yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with Tuck I always leave the dishes and clean-up till later. <br/>
Sometimes if I wait long enough dh will end up doing it.<br/>
Yes I&#39;m eeeebbiillll that way.....<br/>

out they don&#39;t take Thomas stuff back without a receipt! I don&#39;t know <br/>
if there are other categories like this, but it might be worth a call <br/>
first given how busy they are right now.<br/>
<br/>
But somehow we made it out of there paying $4.71 for two toys so I&#39;m <br/>
calling the trip a success.<br/>
