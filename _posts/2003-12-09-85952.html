<div id="ygrps-yiv-601554794">I think the question isn&#39;t so much can you be &quot;religious&quot; (which can <br/>
be broad)and unschool but can you believe in a set of absolute values <br/>
and one absolute way that decides whether people go to heaven and <br/>
hell and still unschool.  Can any caring parent who believes that not <br/>
believing in Jesus as Savior results in a person going to hell be <br/>
comfortable with their child not accepting Jesus as Savior?  If one <br/>
believed that was the only way to avoid eternal hell, wouldn&#39;t you <br/>
beg and plead with them to accept the right way?  <br/>

No, you wouldn&#39;t, you would keep the child in your fervent prayers and have <br/>
faith that the Holy Spirit will speak to their heart about their eternal <br/>
decisions.  Begging and pleading cannot bring someone to the Lord, truly, I don&#39;t <br/>
think.  It&#39;s all in God&#39;s time, not in the mothers or fathers or the preachers.  <br/>
If you were the nagging sort of mom you might beg and plead to complete this <br/>
&quot;ACT&quot; of turning your life over to Christ and to be SAVED but in those <br/>
instances I think a mother would (but thinking again, very well might NOT) realize it <br/>
was only an act to get the mother/father/preacher off their backs and not a <br/>
decision of free will because their heart was moved to be &quot;saved&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Much like with unschooling, one would live their life as an example of how <br/>
their children might live.  If the mother seems happy and joyous in her life, <br/>
the children are more likely to follow the example.  If she seems have crazed <br/>
and utterly restricted by her Covenants with her God, the child would probably <br/>
want no part of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably a good chance the child would reject all parent religious teachings <br/>
or at least explore other ones at some point, if nothing more than to explore <br/>
their own inner thoughts and feelings about such things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038495709">I am a born-again Christian. But I don&#39;t force my beliefs on my children; however this is the life that I lead. Sarah became a Christian when she was 5. She happily joins me in church, goes to Junior Church and reminds me to help her study for the AWANA Bible Club that she enjoys. Logan asked to be a Cubbie in AWANA, but he&#39;s not as into it right now as Sarah is. So I don&#39;t make him go, and I don&#39;t make him study. <br/>
<br/>
I can not make them become Christians. All I can do is live my life, and openly. If they choose a different religion or none at all there is nothing I can ultimately do about it. They&#39;ll know my prayer for them to become Christians, but if they don&#39;t, I won&#39;t love them any less. <br/>

 <br/>
Jesus didn&#39;t beg or plead for people to follow him. He asked specific people, and others also followed. But they all had the choice. We all still have that choice. <br/>
 <br/>
My husband was forced into attending church. He won&#39;t go. A person&#39;s attendance at church really has nothing to do with their faith. It&#39;s between him and God. He can worship and pray just as well outside of a church as he can within one. <br/>
 <br/>
I happen to like going to church, so I go. The children come with me when Paul is not home because I don&#39;t have a sitter. But they have the choice when he is home whether to go or not. <br/>

No, you wouldn&#39;t,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two things:  Let&#39;s talk about what WE do or think or what we can show by <br/>
evidence that others believe or think instead of using this kind of &quot;no you <br/>
would&#39;t&quot; verbiage.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is if people are using AOL 9.0, you need to compensate for <br/>
the glitch that doesn&#39;t separate your highlighted quote from the response you <br/>
give.<br/>
<br/>
Up above it was two different voices, but that&#39;s not apparent in the post.  <br/>
There have been several posts where the response came right in the same <br/>
paragraph, with no break, from the quote, and those are confusing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done it a couple of times when using Kirby&#39;s computer which has 9.0.   <br/>
If you&#39;re using that, add quotation marks of some sort &lt;&lt;maybe this kind&gt;&gt;  AND <br/>
most importantly, hit the return key at least twice before you start typing, <br/>
because otherwise there will be no space.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s bad enough for us to tell people what they SHOULD do without telling <br/>
them what they will or won&#39;t do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No, you wouldn&#39;t, you would keep the child in your fervent prayers and have <br/>
faith that....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t.<br/>
If Christians want to wrestle each other to the death, they need to go and <br/>
build their own yahoogroups colliseum.   You&#39;ll all go to heaven at the end, so <br/>
life or death doesn&#39;t matter, but we wouldn&#39;t be getting the blood on the rest <br/>
of the people on  this list.<br/>

True, but if one&#39;s religion prohibits honoring a child or respecting their <br/>
&quot;inborn urges,&quot; unschooling can prove unworkable.<br/>
<br/>
All honor flows upward (children honor adults but adults owe children <br/>
nothing) in some branches of Christianity, and their &quot;inborn urges&quot; are purely sinful.<br/>
<br/>
I can bring references if it would help, or people who doubt this could just <br/>
go to google and spend a few sad hours reading about the sinful nature of <br/>
young Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
