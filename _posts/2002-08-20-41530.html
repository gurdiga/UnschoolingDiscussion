&gt; I am having trouble deciding in general where one draws lines.  No matter how<br/>
&gt; much personal freedom one would like to give their children, it seems there<br/>
&gt; is always a point at which one has to think about what is too much.  My 12<br/>
&gt; year old is very strong willed and seems to enjoy being shocking at times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your son sounds like a good candidate for UNschooling. He hates his former<br/>
life at school and is searching for something new. So far, all he can<br/>
express are his regrets and dissatisfactions with his past. It can take a<br/>
while to overcome. He just got out of prison, remember. He doesn&#39;t really<br/>
know how to adjust to his newfound freedom.<br/>
<br/>
If you draw a line, I&#39;m betting he&#39;ll jump across it right away.<br/>
<br/>
Try to avoid talking to him as though he is a &quot;problem&quot; child. Keep the<br/>
conversation about things outside of personality. He needs love and<br/>
reassurance, not negative judgments about his &quot;nature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Music is a wonderful release and a vast outlet for expression. You can&#39;t<br/>
control the words he might write. Eminem was just such a kid -- middle class<br/>
who rejects his former life of abuse and neglect. If your son seems to<br/>
idolize him, it&#39;s probably worth finding out about that person, instead of<br/>
assuming that he is a bad person and a bad influence on your son. Most<br/>
successful musicians and other artists are worthy of great respect in many<br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
Give your son time, respect his choices, know that he will sometimes try to<br/>
shock you. He needs your attention. He will not be young for long. Go with<br/>
it if you can. Be his best friend. You really have no good alternative.<br/>

I have a friend who&#39;s a musician (among other things)--a great musician in <br/>
his own right.<br/>
<br/>
His boys go to a little private alternative school with a HUGE <br/>
anti-modern-media bias.  At their school, TV, video games, and popular music <br/>
are just bad.  <br/>
<br/>
One project they had was to do a presentation on someone or something from a <br/>
particular liimited list.  So the kid came home asking his dad to help him <br/>
think of good and original things to say since there would be duplicates and <br/>
overlap.  His dad talked to him about Eminem, helped him look stuff up, <br/>
listened to the music with him, and the report ended up being about self <br/>
reflection, freedom of expression, and that fact that Eminem was a good dad <br/>
to his daughter.<br/>
<br/>
NOT what the school expected, and it caused some ripples or waves, but the <br/>
boy learned a ton, and I hope some of the others at his school (regardless of <br/>
their age or confidence) did too.<br/>
<br/>
Asking a question but only accepting one pre-determined answer isn&#39;t really <br/>
asking an honest question.  I think children&#39;s interests should be encouraged <br/>
and accepted, even when they seem wrong and weird to the parent, as long as <br/>
the child isn&#39;t in danger or breaking the law.  (Unless it&#39;s taking tests <br/>
wrong.  Or staying out of school.  Or  helping wounded animals they&#39;re not <br/>
&quot;supposed&quot; to help.  Or other law breaking with thoughtful purpose.)<br/>
