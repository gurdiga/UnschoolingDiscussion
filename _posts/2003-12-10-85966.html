Respect for how families <br/>
approach these deeply personal subjects, it seems to me, would be an <br/>
important part of unschooling. Acknowledging that not every family will do it <br/>
like <br/>
yours. Some of us are not religious at all, some are, some have had good life <br/>
experiences, some deeply traumatic -- all of these things and more inform how <br/>
we <br/>
unschool and live.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agee more.  In response to &quot;Can religious people be unschoolers?&quot;  <br/>
Isn&#39;t &quot;religious&quot; a pretty broad term.  My dictionary defines it as <br/>
&quot;manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality.&quot;  Using this <br/>
definition, I think a lot of us might be more &quot;religious&quot; than we think. lol.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, some of used to joke years ago that we were becoming nuns in the Church <br/>
of John Holt. &lt;g&gt;  For a while there were a couple of places where religion <br/>
was the only legal reason to homeschool, so we grabbed that as &quot;religion.&quot;  But <br/>
it was a joke.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Claiming respect for things we don&#39;t really respect is only a part of <br/>
hypocricy and dishonesty.  I don&#39;t &quot;respect&quot; a family&#39;s right to spank, ground and <br/>
shame their kids into blubbering lumps of future crime and degradation.  Yes, <br/>
they have the legal right to do that, but I sure don&#39;t respect the way they <br/>
approach that deeply personal subject.<br/>

Yes.<br/>

I have enjoyed your transformation Sheila...many of your changes and questioning have paralleled my own, I just went through it a few years ago. I came to the conclusion that I am not a Christian, that there is no hell but that which we create for ourselves and that my spiritual self is better served by not being religious.:)<br/>

He seemed surprised that church folks were so open minded....I just said &quot;cool, I&#39;m glad you found some likeminded people&quot;, but I was thinking &quot;I told you so&quot;...snark, snark.<br/>
<br/>
I knew it was the church for me when Sierra informed her &quot;teacher&quot; (more like an adult friend that brings cool art stuff and hangs out with them) that she wanted to be a devil for Halloween and Judy whipped out a pair of red devil horns and said &quot;why don&#39;t you be a devil today?&quot;<br/>

*******************************************<br/>
<br/>
I have had the same experience with Unitarianism.  I started going by<br/>
myself, then one kid started, and eventually all 5 started asking on<br/>
Saturday night if I would get them up on Sunday morning so they can go to<br/>
church.<br/>
<br/>
Dh isn&#39;t as thrilled.  He is the lone conservative in the bunch and simply<br/>
doesn&#39;t spend to much time thinking on spiritual matters, although he<br/>
doesn&#39;t mind us doing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120736935">Thanks you all!  for the clarification on condoms and conversation.<br/>
Sorry for any doubt. I just really feel for all the children in the <br/>
messy situations, as I KNOW all of you do too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really happy for all the kids who get to grow up in your families <br/>
and for all the ways in which they will touch other peoples lives.<br/>
