<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; LOL!!! Brenda, that almost sounds too good to be true!! A brand new house to<br/>
&gt; clean and get in order. Let alone new people to cook for!!! I&#39;d just be too<br/>
&gt; afraid of what I&#39;d find when I got back. Unfortuntely the rest of my family<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t share in my enthusiasm to keep a neat house!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But Mary!!<br/>
<br/>
This would be great!  It would be fun for you, and think how much they&#39;d<br/>
appreciate you at home when you get back!  (And in the meantime, I&#39;d get a<br/>
clean house, too!)<br/>
<br/>
C&#39;mon, c&#39;mon.  When&#39;s the plane arriving?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
