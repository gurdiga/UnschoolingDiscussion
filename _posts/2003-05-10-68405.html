&lt;&lt; I&#39;m way behind on this list - but had to laugh a little at this <br/>
question --- the best answer I could think of was to stay on this list <br/>
- 300 emails to go.... and you all are posting faster than i can read!!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last time I was distracted from this list (didn&#39;t even leave town!) there <br/>
were 300 pieces of mail in just a couple of days.  I hope that doesn&#39;t happen <br/>
this time!<br/>
<br/>
I might check tomorrow morning but might not get to.  I fell asleep at the <br/>
sewing machine and decided that was too dangerous, so I came here to see if <br/>
there was e-mail from our host family (DOH!  there wasn&#39;t!  But you guys are <br/>
here).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s going to a prom in Los Alamos and I&#39;m going with him.  He&#39;s driving <br/>
(learner&#39;s permit, and I&#39;m along as the licensed driver sitting in the other <br/>
seat.  We&#39;ll spend the night with the girl&#39;s parents (friends from when the <br/>
kids were way younger, and both parents I&#39;ve known since before they were <br/>
married).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back Sunday afternoon, in case anyone&#39;s looking for me here or <br/>
elsewhere.  Thanks.<br/>
