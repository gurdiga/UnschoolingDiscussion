<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728960614">I might be standing for parliament at the next election, basically as <br/>
a &#39;family-first&#39; candidate.  Egads!  Was wondering if any of you folks <br/>
have ideas for education/family-friendly policies.  Not that I&#39;m <br/>
asking everyone else to do my thinking, but you might come up <br/>
with something I wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve thought of :-)<br/>
<br/>
I must be nuts!<br/>
