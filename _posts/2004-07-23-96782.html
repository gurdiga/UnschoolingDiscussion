&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all, who gets an antibiotic for chicken pox anyway?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My friend took her son to the ER when he had pox because he had a very large<br/>
swollen one in his eye and she was frightened about stories of blindness<br/>
caused by chicken pox in the eye.  The ER docs wanted her to give him oral<br/>
antibiotics and topical ones, despite all the warnings in general against<br/>
prophylactic antibiotics *especially* in the case of viruses.  She decided<br/>
to give him the eye drops only for the specific secondary infection.  When<br/>
she followed up with her regular family doc, the doc was very distressed to<br/>
hear about the ER recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t specifically site the source here, but it must have been<br/>
thinktwice.com or a vax book borrowed from a friend.<br/>
<br/>
I have read that many of the complications from pox have either to do with<br/>
an already immune compromised child, kids having close contact while<br/>
actively ill (once they break out, have them get their own space rather than<br/>
co-sleeping or hanging on the couch together all day) and parents freaking<br/>
out about fevers, going to ER and getting antibiotics before knowing hat the<br/>
problem is...making the virus worse?  Obviously I am posting this as a<br/>
jumping off point for some info to dig for and research.  I read it all over<br/>
2 1/2 years ago when deciding to expose my kids, and I felt comfortable<br/>
doing it after my research.<br/>
