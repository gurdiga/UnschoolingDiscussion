&gt; &gt; I can tell you that it&#39;s still quite a big holiday in Germany.  The <br/>
&gt;whole<br/>
&gt; &gt; country virtually shuts down for the 12 days of Christmas, and Twelfth<br/>
&gt;night<br/>
&gt; &gt; has religious significance, as the celebration of the coming of the wise<br/>
&gt; &gt; men, but it also is the last hurrah of Christmas before everybody goes<br/>
&gt;back<br/>
&gt; &gt; to work in earnest.  I was surprised last year (our first Christmas in<br/>
&gt; &gt; country) how big it was.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; brenda<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So do you live in Germany, Brenda? And if so, how do you homeschool? Unless<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re military, I know it&#39;s illegal. My db and sil live there and send the<br/>
&gt;kids to Catholic school, but they might hs if it were legal.<br/>
