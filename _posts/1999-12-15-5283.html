<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891070738">&lt;&lt; If you don&#39;t mind, if you refuse to allow them to make you<br/>
<br/>
feel less than the wonderful mom you are, they will leave you alone.   It&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
related to the sense of smell. If they smell your doubts, they&#39;ll take that<br/>
<br/>
as an opening cue. If they smell confidence, they&#39;ll leave you alone.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lisa, these words are absolute gems.  Also, people with lower <br/>
self-esteem/confidence seem to have a better sense of smell.  I view certain <br/>
people in my life almost as vultures hovering around waiting for me to falter <br/>
(well, that may be a bit extreme...) so they can swoop down and say, &quot;See?  I <br/>
told you so.&quot;  These are the people I need to avoid when I&#39;m feeling less <br/>
than confident myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Other people with an overly-developed sense of smell may not necessarily fit <br/>
the above category, but may just be fearful.  Grandparents, for instance, who <br/>
I think feel a lack of control and worry more when something is away from the <br/>
norm.  Their intentions may be good, but they obviously can do more harm by <br/>
hovering and hand-wringing.  Let&#39;s try to remember that when our children <br/>
have children (&quot;But darling, do you really think public school is a good <br/>
idea??  Little Tiffany could learn so much more at home...&quot;).<br/>
