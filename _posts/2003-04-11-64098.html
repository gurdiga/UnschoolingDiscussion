<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147344891">Someone went and read at the Christian/ADD thing which was sent to me because <br/>
I am a homeschooler.  I&#39;m guessing lots of you received it, too.  This is <br/>
current as of today, folks.   And why did I receive it?  Because someone <br/>
thinks that because I&#39;m a homeschooler, I&#39;m interested in &quot;Biblical <br/>
treatment&quot; of ADD, Tourettes, facial tics, other sin-based problems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 From here down isn&#39;t me writing.  It&#39;s either the reviewer or quotes from <br/>
the site. <br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
--------<br/>
<br/>
I went to the link for the online book in your garbage box.<br/>
<br/>
From the title I expected &quot;how to&quot;   but took looking at LOTS  of chapters<br/>
<br/>
to find the book&#39;s promise.   Pages on pages of general blathering and<br/>
<br/>
generalizations about society and &quot;history&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally got the &quot;how to&quot;  in Chapter 20...Questions and Answers.<br/>
<br/>
Look especially for the &quot;proper way to administer a spanking&quot; BLECH  as well<br/>
<br/>
as how a respondent beat the tics out her child lest he develop Tourettes<br/>
<br/>
Syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
In case you don&#39;t want to subject yourself I could not restrain myself from<br/>
<br/>
distilling a couple of the things I finally managed to pull up amidst all<br/>
<br/>
the &quot;psychology is stupid&quot;  wordiness.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It was six months after the eye blinking first started that I decided to<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>give it one last try - by correcting his purposeless behavior with the rod.<br/>
<br/>
I would feel extremely guilty if it did not work, because it would have<br/>
<br/>
meant that I had spanked my child for something that he could not help. On<br/>
<br/>
the other hand, I would feel much worse if I were to discover one day that I<br/>
<br/>
could have done something about it and did not. Weighing the two options, I<br/>
<br/>
decided that the former was preferable. I discussed it with my husband, who<br/>
<br/>
agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To our surprise the first spanking stopped the eye blinking completely for<br/>
<br/>
three hours. The second round stopped it for four months and the third<br/>
<br/>
forever.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It was only then that I realized that my son was on his way towards<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>developing true TS. Indeed, during the years to follow Gustav would on and<br/>
<br/>
off have tics, about six different ones in all: sniffing, tongue clicking,<br/>
<br/>
head jerking, nose twitching, etc. He got a hiding for each and every one.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it took one hiding to rid him of a new tic, sometimes two or<br/>
<br/>
three. The most difficult one to rid him of was eye rolling. He would roll<br/>
<br/>
his eyes so that one could only see the white. He has been without any tics<br/>
<br/>
since December 2001, and hopefully it will continue in this way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The explanation I gave to my son is that all sins have consequences. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The purpose, it must be repeated, is not to punish, but to drive a little<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of the sinfulness from the heart of the child. So, if the hiding succeeded<br/>
<br/>
in doing this, it was effective, if it did not, it was ineffective. Giving a<br/>
<br/>
child an ineffective hiding is like hitting a child for no purpose, and that<br/>
<br/>
is child abuse. It is therefore very important that the parent must make<br/>
<br/>
sure that the hiding is indeed effective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The parent should then make a mental note how many lashes had been hit,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and must then, at the next visit to the bathroom, hit more and hit harder.<br/>
<br/>
In this way the severity of the hiding must be stepped up until the child<br/>
<br/>
responds to the parent&#39;s embrace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Every parent can decide for himself or herself how long he or she wants<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the hiding to last. If you want it to last for two weeks, then hit hard<br/>
<br/>
enough and long enough to make it last for two weeks. If you want the hiding<br/>
<br/>
to last for two months, then you simply have to hit harder and longer to<br/>
<br/>
make the hiding last longer<br/>
<br/>
Discipline. A parent who really loves his or her child, will never repeat<br/>
<br/>
any instruction verbally, but will always repeat it in one way only and that<br/>
<br/>
is with a belt or a stick in the bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Obedience should be prompt, complete and unquestioned. Children should<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>learn that their parents mean what they say, and parents should expect their<br/>
<br/>
children to obey the first time they speak.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Unquestionable obedience means that the authority of the parent may not<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be questioned. If you have to reason and argue with your child in order to<br/>
<br/>
get obedience, you will soon find yourself frustrated and outwitted.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;And if a child is commanded to do something and he does so unwillingly,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fussing or whining, his attitude needs correction too.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And must NOT overlook the &quot;commercial&quot;  for the author&#39;s product and how any<br/>
<br/>
decreased success is the fault of the consumer :-) OR that allowing failure<br/>
<br/>
at the task will lead to unemployable adults!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The turning point for Heidi came in September 1997, after seeing a program<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on TV about Dr. Jan Strydom&#39;s work. She made an appointment to see Dr.<br/>
<br/>
Strydom in October 1997.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The consultation, which lasted two hours, changed our lives forever,&quot; says<br/>
<br/>
Heidi. &quot;Dr. Strydom taught us how to correct Hermann&#39;s behavior problems,<br/>
<br/>
and also recommended that we embark on the Audiblox program in order to<br/>
<br/>
improve Hermann&#39;s cognitive abilities.&quot;&gt;&gt;  (This is from following a link<br/>
<br/>
about &quot;another&quot;  child with Tourettes and his cure)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;An improvement was also noted in Hermann&#39;s IQ score. As stated, he scored<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>70 on 7 March 1997. When his IQ was re-assessed in November 1998, it was 84.<br/>
<br/>
On 13 June 1999, it was found to be 96.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Best of all,&quot; says Heidi, &quot;after following Dr. Strydom&#39;s advice, our<br/>
<br/>
aggressive and destructive child was turned into a loving child. He is still<br/>
<br/>
very active and a real chatterbox, but can now sit still and be dead quiet<br/>
<br/>
in situations where it is required of him. He can also be trusted to behave<br/>
<br/>
when left on his own. He goes to bed at normal hours, after watching one or<br/>
<br/>
two programs on TV - something he never did. He was simply too active. The<br/>
<br/>
obsessive-compulsive behavior, the continual swearing and stealing, the<br/>
<br/>
suicidal thoughts and bedwetting are long forgotten.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;Since 1979 I have been involved in helping children overcome learning<br/>
<br/>
problems, using a program called Audiblox. Audiblox is a system of cognitive<br/>
<br/>
exercises, aimed at the development of foundational skills. Of course the<br/>
<br/>
child&#39;s attitude does not change when he does Audiblox. If a child has a<br/>
<br/>
wrong attitude toward work, he will only achieve limited success on the<br/>
<br/>
program. It therefore often happens that parents contact me to ask, for<br/>
<br/>
example, whether they can cut down on the time they have to spend on<br/>
<br/>
Audiblox. They say that after some time on the program the child gets bored<br/>
<br/>
with it, because of the repetitive nature of the exercises. It is important<br/>
<br/>
to note that the level of difficulty of Audiblox can be increased<br/>
<br/>
indefinitely. The boredom is not related to lack of complexity but to<br/>
<br/>
routine, and is therefore merely a sign of a wrong attitude toward work.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the child is given the opportunity to learn how to deal with routine,<br/>
<br/>
it will make life impossible for him when later he has to enter the labor<br/>
<br/>
market. Just like he was bored by the Audiblox exercises, routine tasks at<br/>
<br/>
work will also bore him. The nurse, for example, will become bored to have<br/>
<br/>
to check the blood pressure of the same patient every day, and the teacher<br/>
<br/>
will be bored with having to follow the same syllabus year after year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The child, who wants a break every now and then during the course of an<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Audiblox lesson - purportedly to stretch his legs, or to fetch a cold drink<br/>
<br/>
from the fridge - will be the worker one day who will want to interrupt a<br/>
<br/>
meeting for a smoke break after every five minutes. The child who becomes<br/>
<br/>
stubborn and refuses to continue with the program, will become the rolling<br/>
<br/>
stone, moving from one job to the next as soon as he gets bored with a<br/>
<br/>
current job. One mother wrote, &quot;We have had a hard time with our son. He<br/>
<br/>
does not want to do his Audiblox and he gets very defiant in doing it.. He<br/>
<br/>
gets very stubborn and does not want to do it.&quot; This mother does not realize<br/>
<br/>
that she has the opportunity - and the duty - to save her son from having a<br/>
<br/>
very unhappy and unproductive work life later as an adult.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Sometimes parents report that the child&#39;s performance on Audiblox has<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>deteriorated; for example, whereas he succeeded in doing Sequencing exercise<br/>
<br/>
3 with eleven blocks at the start, he can now only manage seven. Such a<br/>
<br/>
child will probably later fritter away his time in the work place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Several parents have asked what to do if their child complains that his<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;arms get tired&quot; from doing the Arrows exercise. It is interesting to note<br/>
<br/>
in how many cases this complaint came from children who are obviously very<br/>
<br/>
able on the sports field! Such a child will most probably later be the<br/>
<br/>
worker who sleeps on the job, only to have his energy return when the<br/>
<br/>
workday is over&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
