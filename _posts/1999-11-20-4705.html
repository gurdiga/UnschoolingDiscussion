<div id="ygrps-yiv-997469220">During the Middle Ages, the royals and other upper class people frequently<br/>
hired private tutors to teach them about subjects in which they were<br/>
interested.  Those tutors were recognized experts in their fields.  Their<br/>
instruction was one-on-one; a splendid arrangement if you could afford it.<br/>
Sadly, only the privileged could.<br/>
<br/>
Today, such arrangements are more possible than ever before, yet relatively<br/>
few people take advantage of them.   What&#39;s truly amazing is that this<br/>
superior way of learning is often available for next to nothing.<br/>
Frequently, all it costs is a bit of curiosity and time out from a busy<br/>
schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, as a family, we went to the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry<br/>
(OMSI) (http://www.omsi.edu).  This is one of our favorite places, so much<br/>
so that we have been members since arriving in Oregon two years ago.<br/>
<br/>
One of the special events on yesterday&#39;s program was a demonstration on<br/>
skulls.  Even though the museum was packed with people, my daughter and I<br/>
were the only ones to attend this particular demonstration.  For nearly an<br/>
hour, we learned all about skulls from an enthusiastic and well-informed<br/>
graduate student in physical anthropology.  He led us through an exercise in<br/>
which we examined specific patterns on two skulls to determine which<br/>
belonged to a male and which to a female.  We learned how to tell the<br/>
difference between skulls of young people and those of the elderly.  We also<br/>
compared the human skull to a gorilla skull, noting the differences and why<br/>
those differences exist.  Our mentor answered our specific questions and<br/>
gave us additional information which further illuminated the concepts.<br/>
<br/>
It was complete intellectual stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
OMSI is just one example of a community resource which can bring eager<br/>
learners and enthusiastic mentors together.  There are zoos, art museums,<br/>
historical houses, history museums, wildlife preserves, special<br/>
exhibits--the list is endless.  At nearly every one of these, you can<br/>
usually find knowledgeable people (just like the Medieval tutors in their<br/>
day) who, more often than not, are hoping that someone stops long enough to<br/>
take an interest in their work and ask questions.  If you take advantage of<br/>
these opportunities, you may find (as we have) that some of  the best<br/>
learning available is either free or very inexpensive--a much better<br/>
arrangement than how it was during the Middle Ages!<br/>
