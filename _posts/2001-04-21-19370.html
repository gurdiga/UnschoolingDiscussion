I&#39;d like to recommend a book to you that was just published...   &quot;Christian Unschooling - Growing Your Child in the Freedom of Christ,&quot; by Teri Brown and Elissa Wahl.  I pre-ordered it and received my copy a week or so ago.  It is a wonderful source of encouragement, information, and inspiration.  Unschooling is often misunderstood by many Christians and it is sometimes hard to find other Christian unschoolers.  Teri also has a website...  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/">http://www.inspirit.com.au/unschooling/</a> and more info on the book can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.championpress.com/unschoolingmain.html.">http://www.championpress.com/unschoolingmain.html.</a><br/>
