<div id="ygrps-yiv-353778471">What my kids love to do is make their art supplies from the ground up so to<br/>
speak.  They get a real feel for things by making their own supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Some good directions for this can be found at<br/>

The other thing I do is keep my eyes open for clearance sales at local craft<br/>
stores (e.g., Michaels) and discount stores (e.g., Walmart).  You can often<br/>
pick up supplies you couldn&#39;t otherwise make at clearance prices.  Even if<br/>
it isn&#39;t something that you think you would be using right away, or<br/>
something that you haven&#39;t found a use for yet, the clearance stuff can make<br/>
great additions to a rainy day or anytime box ... you&#39;d be surprise what the<br/>
kids come up with all on their own.  Or maybe not.  We are unschoolers after<br/>
all.  LOL!<br/>

&gt; I am looking for ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My six year old loves to paint and draw.  How can I best help her with<br/>
&gt; this?  Any suggestions for affordable, quality art supplies, ie., paints<br/>
&gt; & brushes?<br/>
