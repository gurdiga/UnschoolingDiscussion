 </span></blockquote>My daughter is interested in a lot of aspects of movies and shows.  She was <br/>
wondering how your sisters got involved in this and made it good in <br/>
Hollywood.  She also is into film and set design, Do you know of any good <br/>
places she can go to learn more?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
