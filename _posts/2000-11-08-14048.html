<div id="ygrps-yiv-186528562">Hi Carol,<br/>
<br/>
I am coming out of lurkdom (is that a word? LOL) to suggest an idea for you.<br/>
My son is also very interested in video games. Why not research with him on<br/>
how they are designed and ask him to design a game. You never know what<br/>
could happen from there. :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   &gt;Anyway, my one problem with Jimmie is that he is totally <br/>
&gt;  &gt; addicted to video games.  We have a Nintendo that has been used in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt; moderation, but if I left it up to Jimmie, the Nintendo would be<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt;  &gt;24 hours a day.  When we go anywhere in the car, he&#39;s got his Game <br/>
&gt;  &gt;Boy with him, so this is something we battle every waking hour.<br/>
&gt; How <br/>
&gt;  &gt;do I teach him some moderation without insulting his choices?  I <br/>
&gt;  &gt;have to admit, I have wanted to say, &quot;Turn that silly box OFF and<br/>
&gt; do <br/>
&gt;  &gt;something that involves a BRAIN!!!&quot;  I have restrained myself so <br/>
&gt;  &gt;far, but I could snap at any minute.  How would the rest of you <br/>
&gt;  &gt;handle this?<br/>
