<div id="ygrps-yiv-386164926">Children learn what they see. When they are read to or read themselves, they<br/>
see grammer, the perceive the inflections, the way words work together,<br/>
sentence structure and all that goes. As they write, and read responses,<br/>
they learn that poor grammer may cause misunderstanding with their audience<br/>
so they change it. Some may go to an old grammer handbook many former<br/>
college attendees saved. I believe it is instinctive, after all they are<br/>
using it since they began to talk. Think about how children cdevelop spoken<br/>
language. &quot;Dat!&quot; with a pointing finger becomes &quot;Me want dat cook&quot; turns to<br/>
&quot;Can I have that cookie?&quot;<br/>
Written language develops the same way.<br/>
I encourage writting thank you notes, phone number lists, and grocery lists,<br/>
I buy the kids Journaling books, story starters and leave them where they<br/>
may find them andpick them up if they are interested.<br/>
But the biggest thing I &quot;do&quot; is use it myself and not worry about it. OF<br/>
COURSE they will get it, it is natural for the to want to learn and do their<br/>
personal best, as long as they are allowed the freedom and time to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700057528">My kids love MAD LIBS!!  If they need to know what something is they ask, I tell them.   After I tell them once or twice they get it and don&#39;t ask anymore.  Rarely when reading a book do I feel the need to identify parts of speech.  Much less diagram a sentence.  Have&#39;nt done that since high school and not sure why it was required then.  Overall my kids learn proper english by communicating with others and reading and being read to.  When they write things (cards, notes, stories) they usually ask me to read it through.  They WANT it to be right.  I suggest changes and most times explain why.  They often tend to remember that mistake next time.  What kid does not mispell things, or word a sentence badly?  It is all part of learning this crazy english language.  Only I think we are doing it the easy, natural way.  And yes my daughter can pass the State required test. Rebecca<br/>

mechanic to be able to name the parts of speech?  There are lots of <br/>
jobs that one only need to be able to communicate with the language, <br/>
not analyze it. So is it really necessay for everyone to learn it?<br/>
<br/>
OTOH - My interests are varied but I do have strong interest in <br/>
writing and editing.  For that, it is a huge benefit for me that the <br/>
parts of speech were drilled into me at a very young age.  I can now <br/>
write rapidly and well without having to stop and consider which form <br/>
of the verb is needed where.  I want my kids to learn this too, but <br/>
I&#39;m not going to force them to.  I may suggest and encourage, but if <br/>
they aren&#39;t interested, I won&#39;t force it.  Besides if they go through <br/>
with their long range plans, they won&#39;t need it anyway.<br/>

Mine have encountered these words in the Jump Start computer software,  and<br/>
we have a book which uses characters to &#39;show&#39; things about nouns,  verbs,<br/>
ajectives,  adverbs.   They have run across thes terms in a few games on the<br/>
back of cereal boxes...and just yesterday we got a sample of Ragu express<br/>

that kids need to learn.  When you divide the world into subjects and get <br/>

with the trust that you need to develop that your kids will learn what they <br/>

be, you&#39;ll find the words noun, or verb, or adjective.  Two people <br/>
play.  One asks the other for a noun and then an adjective and then a verb, <br/>
or whatever is asked for, and writes them in.  Then that person reads the <br/>
story back with the words inserted.  They can be quite hilarious.  I&#39;ve <br/>
found them on the web.  You fill out a form first with your chosen <br/>
words.  Then you get to see the story.  Searching for mad libs would find <br/>
you some to try.<br/>

am still stuck on what to show or prove he did by the<br/>
end of the year.  he shouldn&#39;t have to prove anything<br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

  i think it&#39;s because I was taught.  I worry about my<br/>
son&#39;s speech too. I don&#39;t know what you mean by<br/>
&quot;Logger talk&quot; , but my son is always making up voices.<br/>
 Sometime I wonder if he remembers what his own voice<br/>
is.  LOL<br/>
thanks again<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792833253">I shouldn&#39;t say drilled into me, because I LOVED every minute of it <br/>
and I still like diagramming sentences.  But, when I am writing, I can <br/>
place the right tense of a verb where it belongs without it being a <br/>
conscious thought.  But more importantly, when I am editing, it helps <br/>
me spot inconsistencies in tense.  Nothing irritates me more than <br/>
having the coherance of a book ruined by an author who is inconsistent <br/>
 with her verbs.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Grammer(nouns, <br/>
&gt; &gt; verbs, adj etc) ?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning &quot;the parts of speech&quot; is only a small part of grammar.<br/>
<br/>
There is no greater grammatical tool than being a native speaker who has been <br/>
encouraged to use language in the real world, who has the opportunity to hear <br/>
others speak well, in various situations, and who is surrounded by <br/>
language--in print, theatre, lyrics, jokes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Grammar, spelling, punctuation, and knowing when and how to paragraph are all <br/>
together are called &quot;the mechanics of writing.&quot;    (Those of you collecting <br/>
buzzwords for annual reports to states or school boards should keep that at <br/>
hand--&quot;the mechanics of writing,&quot; and also keep &quot;exposition&quot; to use.  <br/>
Expository writing is the factual sort of description, reporting, <br/>
comparison/contrast writing.  And if a child is writing rules to a game, call <br/>
that technical writing.  It is.)<br/>
<br/>
There are some books called &quot;The Transitive Vampire&quot; and &quot;The Well-Tempered <br/>
Sentence&quot; by Karen Elizabeth Gordon which go through such rules in a fun way. <br/>
 I use those, or Fowler&#39;s Modern English Useage when I want to look something <br/>
up.  The Harbrace College Handbook can probably be found used at just about <br/>
any used bookstore (as can Fowler&#39;s, maybe, and the older editions of <br/>
Fowler&#39;s are really fun for people interested in English).  <br/>
<br/>
But cheap and fun are the sarcastic lists of rules, each of which breaks its <br/>
own rule.  They go around as e-mail humor sometimes, so lots are on webpages. <br/>
 I quoted a really long one below, but here are links to some shorter <br/>
versions.  If you lose these, go to google.com and put in &quot;don&#39;t use no <br/>
double negatives never&quot; and you&#39;ll get lots of links.<br/>

<br/>
HUMOROUS GRAMMAR RULES<br/>
1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.<br/>
2. Never use a preposition to end a sentence with. Winston Churchill, <br/>
corrected on this error once, responded to the young man who corrected him by <br/>
saying &quot;Young man, that is the kind of impudence up with which I will not put!<br/>
3. And don&#39;t start a sentence with a conjunction.<br/>
4. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br/>
5. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They&#39;re old hat.)<br/>
6. Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.<br/>
7. Be more or less specific.<br/>
8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.<br/>
9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies endlessly over and over <br/>
again<br/>
10. No sentence fragments.<br/>
11. Contractions aren&#39;t always necessary and shouldn&#39;t be used to excess so <br/>
don’t.<br/>
12. Foreign words and phrases are not always apropos.<br/>
13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it&#39;s highly <br/>
superfluous and can be excessive<br/>
14. All generalizations are bad.<br/>
15. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br/>
16. Don&#39;t use no double negatives.<br/>
17. Avoid excessive use of ampersands & abbrevs., etc.<br/>
18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br/>
19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake (Unless they are as <br/>
good as gold).<br/>
20. The passive voice is to be ignored.<br/>
21. Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words, however, <br/>
should be enclosed in commas.<br/>
22. Never use a big word when substituting a diminutive one would suffice.<br/>
23. Don’t overuse exclamation points!!!<br/>
24. Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.<br/>
25. Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth earth-shaking <br/>
ideas<br/>
26. Use the apostrophe in it&#39;s proper place and omit it when its not needed <br/>
and use it correctly with words’ that show possession.<br/>
27. Don’t use too many quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, &quot;I hate <br/>
quotations.. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br/>
28. If you&#39;ve heard it once, you&#39;ve heard it a billion times: Resist <br/>
hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly. Besides, <br/>
hyperbole is always overdone, anyway.<br/>
29. Puns are for children, not groan readers.<br/>
30. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br/>
31. Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br/>
32. Who needs rhetorical questions? However, what if there were no rhetorical <br/>
questions?<br/>
33. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.<br/>
34. Avoid &quot;buzz-words&quot;; such integrated transitional scenarios complicate <br/>
simplistic matters<br/>
35. People don’t spell &quot;a lot&quot; correctly alot of the time.<br/>
36. Each person should use their possessive pronouns correctly<br/>
37. All grammar and spelling rules have exceptions (with a few exceptions)<br/>
....Morgan’s Law.<br/>
38. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.<br/>
39. The dash – a sometimes useful punctuation mark – can often be overused – <br/>
even though it’s a helpful tool some of the time.<br/>
40. Proofread carefully to make sure you don’t repeat repeat any words.<br/>
41. In writing, it’s important to remember that dangling sentences.<br/>
41. When numbering in a written document, check your numbering system <br/>
carefully.<br/>
<br/>
42. It is important to use italics for emphasis sparingly.<br/>
43. In good writing, for good reasons, under normal circumstances, whenever <br/>
you can, use prepositional phrases in limited numbers and with great caution.<br/>
44. Avoid going out on tangents unrelated to your subject -- not the subject <br/>
of a sentence -- that&#39;s another story (like the stories written by Ernest <br/>
Hemingway, who by the way wrote the great fisherman story The Old Man and the <br/>
Sea).<br/>
45. Complete sentences. Like rule 10.<br/>
46. Unless you&#39;re a righteous expert don&#39;t try to be too cool with slang to <br/>
which you&#39;re not hip.<br/>
47. If you must use slang, avoid out-of-date slang. Right on!<br/>
48. You&#39;ll look poorly if you misuse adverbs.<br/>
49. Use the ellipsis ( . . . ) to indicate missing . . . <br/>
50. Use brackets to indicate that you [ not Shakespeare, for example ] are <br/>
giving people [ in your class ] information so that they [ the people in your <br/>
class ] know about whom you are speaking. But do not use brackets when making <br/>
these references [ to other authors ] excessively.<br/>
51. Note: People just can&#39;t stomach too much use of the colon.<br/>
52. Between good grammar and bad grammar, good grammar is the best.<br/>
53. There are so many great grammar rules that I can&#39;t decide between them.<br/>
54. In English, unlike German, the verb early in the sentence, not later, <br/>
should be placed.<br/>
55. When you write sentences, shifting verb tense is bad.<br/>
<br/>
