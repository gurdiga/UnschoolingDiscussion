<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930124025">Dear Merilyn;<br/>
     I am glad to see that I am not the only mom who is wiiling to trust her<br/>
own expertise with her child. The doctors and I have been fighting about<br/>
Chris for two years. As I have said many times, I know he has a medical<br/>
problem but it cannot be as bad as the teachers have put on. Eventually the<br/>
docs just have to give in and try your suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
   The weird thing is that Chris is never at home the way he is at school.<br/>
He has weird ticks though (Your discription rung a bell for me.) He says<br/>
that there is a beeping noise in his head and it makes him &quot;talk out&quot;. He<br/>
makes these space age sound effects or animal noises. Its not really bad at<br/>
home, except at night when he is trying to go yo sleep. But his teacher says<br/>
he does it constantly at school. I hope this does not mean there is<br/>
something else they can &quot;diagnose&quot; him with. One teacher diagnosis in a life<br/>
time is enough&lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support. Taje Care.<br/>
<br/>
Brightest Blessings,<br/>

<br/>
Dear Virginia,<br/>
<br/>
I can somewhat relate to your description of your son.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
sent my daughter (who&#39;s almost 6) to school, and I self-diagnose her to<br/>
be ADHD based on the checklist that can be found on almost any ADD<br/>
website.  In addition, she has developed TICS, so I&#39;m self-diagnosing<br/>
her as having Tourettes.  She also has explosive outburts and blame<br/>
everybody for her problems.  I&#39;m looking into coping techniques from<br/>
&quot;The Explosive Child&quot;.  I joined a Tourette&#39;s list, because her tics<br/>
were so severe at one time, we panicked.  Sad to say, the majority of<br/>
the list members advocated medication --- this list is not a homeschool<br/>
list, so I don&#39;t think the members can relate to me very well.<br/>
That&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for a more homeschool-friendly list for<br/>
children with &quot;special needs or gifted&quot; (however you want to call it)<br/>
that doesn&#39;t immediately jump to meds as a quick-fix to all their<br/>
problems.<br/>
I also finished reading the book &quot;ADD - A different perception&quot; by Thom<br/>
Hartmann, and it&#39;s a very empowering book.  He criticises the public<br/>
school system for failing to deal with gifted children, whom the<br/>
teachers easily dismiss as &quot;problem&quot; children.  Another book that I<br/>
found empowering is Thomas Armstrong&#39;s &quot;In Their Own Way&quot; and &quot;The<br/>
Myth of ADD&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t believe in the school system anymore, and anything<br/>
that requires interaction with the school system, I avoid as much as<br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will find homeschooling a more satisfying and rewarding<br/>
experience for you and your son.   This list keeps people &quot;sane&quot;,<br/>
instead of other lists e.g. for special needs or whatever, which seems<br/>
to advocate that people with &quot;disorders&quot; are outcasts and needs meds<br/>
to function completely in society.  This is a very sad picture.<br/>
<br/>
Best Wishes,<br/>
Merilyn<br/>
