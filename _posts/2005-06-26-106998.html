<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516663704">This is most of an old   post (what wasn&#39;t reference to earlier stuff, in a <br/>
discussion about what was unschooling) by me.   I found it moving files from <br/>
one computer to another.<br/>

<br/>
Newer homeschoolers/unschoolers often have a vision of schoolwork in their <br/>
heads, and they&#39;re hoping for an alternate way to get that small set of <br/>
knowledge (which probably seems big from their point of view, at first) into their <br/>
kids.   <br/>
<br/>
Older homechoolers realize that the &quot;set of knowledge&quot; is as much as can be <br/>
gathered from interaction, experience and discussion in the whole world, for <br/>
the rest of one&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
So to the newer people here, since we&#39;re not talking about children and <br/>
math/English/science/history, we&#39;re not talking about unschooling.   But we ARE <br/>
talking about history.  Don&#39;t you expect people born in 1930 to be able to tell <br/>
you something about WWII?   Our kids will be called on by their grandkids to <br/>
tell them what they remember about the war that began in their childhoods.   It <br/>
won&#39;t be, I hope, &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything except people put flags on their <br/>
cars and my mom kept singing &#39;God Bless America.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And we ARE talking English, and political science.   How is a nation informed <br/>
and made supportive of a war?   Why will soldiers happily go to war?   Why <br/>
will the families back home happily accept it?   There are motivations in <br/>
historical movements.    &quot;Why?&quot; will lead to why when the kids are coming across the <br/>
history of Poland, of South Africa, of the Moors in medieval Spain, of the <br/>
Roman Empire.<br/>
<br/>
The sooner a family cuts loose from the school model where kids learn certain <br/>
things and parents consider they are &quot;through with school&quot; and don&#39;t have to <br/>
learn, the sooner unschooling will actually work instead of just being a model <br/>
which isn&#39;t quite fitting the family.<br/>
