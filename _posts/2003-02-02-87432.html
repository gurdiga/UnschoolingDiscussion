<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that describes us perfectly. We do a lot of driving to different <br/>
places and take lots of cool trips. It&#39;s not about having things in your <br/>
backyard--okay, it&#39;s not *only* about having things in your backyard. &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We live about 40 min. outside of DC, on the Western Shore of the Chesapeake <br/>
Bay. We have the best of both worlds, in my opinion. There are many great <br/>
museums and historical sites within a 3 hour drive, but much of the stuff <br/>
that we do on a daily basis is local. The Chesapeake is rich in fossils. We <br/>
can take a 2 mile hike in the woods to get to a great beach where we can go <br/>
fossil hunting and enjoy a beautiful day outside. We have nature walks <br/>
through cypress swamp lands nearby, and the beach and boardwalk are a half <br/>
mile drive from our home.<br/>
<br/>
In our backyard, we have a really great pond, stocked with comets and koi. <br/>
It attracts tons of frogs, dragonflies and the occasional box turtle. We <br/>
maintain bird feeders, which are such a joy! We get Carolina Chickadees, <br/>
Juncos, Cardinals, Blue Jays, Titmice, Nuthatches, House Wrens, House <br/>
Finches, Gold Finches, Downy Woodpeckers, Red Bellied Woodpeckers, Yellow <br/>
Shafted Flickers and the occasional Eastern Blue Bird. We back up against <br/>
deciduous woodlands and wetlands, and we occasionally see a Pileated <br/>
Woodpecker out there. Within a short drive there&#39;s a whole host of <br/>
different birds--water birds that are amazingly graceful to watch. Last <br/>
year, we watched a mating dance between two Yellow Shafted Flickers, and it <br/>
was very cool! I love my birds!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d give up all this nature to be closer to the city. Nature <br/>
is just too important to me. We drive, and enjoy it all!</div>

the shore line. That was truly a marvelous sight the first time I saw one <br/>
soaring in the wild!<br/>
<br/>
We have friends who live in Takoma Park--in the city, but with it&#39;s own <br/>
small town center. It&#39;s easy to be envious of them, too--being able to walk <br/>
down their main street or jump on a metro into the museums.<br/>
<br/>
Really, though, we&#39;re only about 45 minutes door to parking space for the <br/>
Smithsonian and about an hour and a quarter from Baltimore&#39;s Inner Harbor, <br/>
so it truly is an ideal location. We&#39;re about 4.5 hours from dh&#39;s family, <br/>
which is also pretty great. They have a shore house up in Jersey and live <br/>
on the train line to NYC. I&#39;m looking forward to doing the Statue of <br/>
Liberty this Spring.<br/>

I feel very lucky to live where we do; I would truly hate to leave.<br/>

only place that isn&#39;t 30 miles plus away is the grocery store and, even then, I <br/>
sometimes drive into the specialty store in Houston. lol  We are blessed with <br/>
a good library though and my ds loves to go and look at books and just hang <br/>
out and read.  I love to do this too so we have a great time.  We like checking <br/>
out PBS videos from the library as well and then coming home and watching them <br/>
with popcorn and a coke.  I have learned more history and geography since we <br/>
started homeschooling then I ever did in school or college.<br/>

<br/>
I live in Albuquerque.    There are lots of things to do.<br/>
<br/>
Families who have moved way out of town have kids who are frustrated at not <br/>
being able to get to town, and parents who are tired of the long drives. <br/>
<br/>
We looked many times for land or a house we liked, east of town, in the <br/>
mountains, before we had kids and when Kirby was little.   Now I am THRILLED that <br/>
we never found something we loved.   We did move to a bigger house in town.  We <br/>
can walk to Kinko&#39;s or Hollywood Video in two minutes.  We used to have a <br/>
grocery store that close but it closed.  We can walk to Lowe&#39;s (a big home <br/>
improvement store).   The city bus stops within view of our back yard.  Kirby has <br/>
had a job for three years at a gaming shop a mile from us.  He can walk if he <br/>
needs to.  We can decide to go to a movie twenty minutes before it starts.   <br/>
Holly can walk to friends&#39; houses.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not where &quot;suburbs&quot; in the isolated sense are a reality.  The only <br/>
thing I&#39;ve seen of that personally are the newer &quot;bedroom communities&quot; outside of <br/>
big cities in California.  They have restaurants and stores, but other things <br/>
are in the older cities.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, our choices in New Mexico are towns or country.<br/>

<br/>
I think the main thing is simply to do stuff you love doing, no matter where<br/>
you are.  We love animals and growing food.....but we actually live inside<br/>
the city limits of a small town that will be a suburb of San Antonio in a<br/>
few years.  We simply bring what we love with us.<br/>
<br/>
We sometimes go to museums but not often because of the drive.....We have to<br/>
limit our animals because we do have neighbors....But what we mainly do is<br/>
make the most of the things around us, the things that make where we live<br/>
great.  The kids go with me to all the stores....the owners know the kids<br/>
because it is a very small town and the kids often get an &quot;inside&quot; view into<br/>
things they wouldn&#39;t in a large city...  Our mailman knows us and lets the<br/>
kids help with the mail....We know the people who have the adult foster care<br/>
facility and when one of the ladies wanders off, my kids have been known to<br/>
very caringly show them back to safety.<br/>

but that was before kids. What we talked about was out in the boonies. And<br/>
even recently, Joe was still talking that way. But now that the kids are<br/>
older and really wanting to *do* things and have friends to do them with,<br/>
he&#39;s changed his mind. At least for now.<br/>
<br/>
We are not big walkers unless we are actually just taking a walk. We do<br/>
drive everywhere. Tara can be at school in 5 minutes and at work in less<br/>
than 15. If I&#39;m lucky to miss the red light at the intersection, I can be at<br/>
the shopping plaza in less than 5 minutes. I can grocery shop, go to Office<br/>
Depot, the movies, drug store, Bed, Bath and Beyond, (my new favorite store)<br/>
Burger King, Chili&#39;s and quite a few others. If I take the 15 minutes, I can<br/>
hit clothes, shoes, K Mart, Home Depot and many others. I completely stay<br/>
away from malls!!!<br/>
<br/>
We can do 2 different libraries within 10 minutes and if I take 20, we can<br/>
hit the big one at the community college. A favorite park is just 10 minutes<br/>
away. They have a water park there too.<br/>
<br/>
Museums, zoos and such will take a bit longer. Anywhere from a half hour to<br/>
a little over 1 hour. Still not bad at all. We love where we live. The<br/>
neighborhood couldn&#39;t be more diverse and friendly. I have all the comforts<br/>
of the town, even though we aren&#39;t actually near it, and still far enough<br/>
away not to feel cramped and hurried.<br/>

in here...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in Huntington Beach, which I guess would be considered a suburb <br/>
of Los Angeles. We travel up there (about 40 minutes depending on <br/>
traffic) whenever the kids want to go to the Natural History Museum, <br/>
which is usually the first Tuesday of the month when it is free :)<br/>
<br/>
We spend almost all of our time here in West Orange County. One of <br/>
the coolest things that we have discovered is a treasure hunting game <br/>
called geocaching. You hunt for caches (usually a tupperware <br/>
container filled with trinkets) with a GPS device. The reason that I <br/>
mention this is that I have lived in this area for my whole life, <br/>
with the exception of a year in Arizona. Geocaching with the kids has <br/>
taken me to places literally five minutes from my house, that I never <br/>
knew existed. Cool landmarks, hidden parks, awesome nature preserves. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that there are some neat places right where you live, just <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Everyone in my family (myself included) has fantasies about living out in a <br/>
small town about an hour out of the city.  We looked, longingly, at a place <br/>
about a month ago that would have been perfect for our dreams, but the reality of <br/>
it is that while I&#39;m unschooling Liam, easy and speedy access to the <br/>
conveniences of the city are simply more important.  At least, for him and for me.  I <br/>
know that every family is different, and this does not specifically address <br/>
the question of the original poster.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just that his interests are only going to be satisfied by being close <br/>
in.  Yes, we would develop other interests if we were in a small town <br/>
environment, but he&#39;s only got a year or so left until he goes off to college, and his <br/>
direction is pretty much set by now.<br/>
<br/>
Dreams of quiet country living will have to be deferred.  (I truly envy the <br/>
Chesapeake Bay poster, though -- was that danielle?  What an idyllic set-up <br/>
that is.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I work, however, with large numbers of homeschoolers from all around the <br/>
Houston Metroplex area, including many who live in small towns around the <br/>
periphery, and I would have to agree with the statement that it just takes a <br/>
willingness to drive for what is seen as truly important.  Of course, metropolitan <br/>
unschooling means a lot of driving, too -- and in traffic.  I&#39;m on the road a <br/>
great deal of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Point being, in some ways there isn&#39;t that big a difference between time <br/>
spent in the car for small town (suburb) or city families.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s a question of interests and of priorities. <br/>

originally posted the suburbs question.  My dd is only 1 and hates to travel so we <br/>
haven&#39;t yet taken my son to the zoo in Syracuse but we did visit the Bufflao <br/>
zoo last summer when visiting relatives.  Will be there again this summer for <br/>
a few weddings and are planning on checking out the aquarium and Natural Sci <br/>
Museum.<br/>
All the people who live where there is nice weather year round I envy. It&#39;s <br/>
only Jan & I&#39;m already sick of being inside.  Although today we did rearrange <br/>
our scrapbook supplies, do playdough, read books, play a game, play the piano, <br/>
sing songs, and hang paper snowflakes in the windows... not too bad.   But I&#39;d <br/>
love to have had warm weather instead.<br/>
I guess that it matters most what we want to do as to where we should live.   <br/>
We have enough yard to garden in and that we all enjoy in the summer..it will <br/>
have to do for now.  Those of you in Canada must really have a short growing <br/>
season!<br/>
In the suburbs, we are too far to walk to anything but the library, parks, <br/>
and stores are only 5-15 minutes away by car.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368265372">Because of the mess factor of playdough, Paul has always said it was &quot;not allowed in his house.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Since beginning to unschool I&#39;ve said to heck with that. The kids LIKE playdough, it&#39;s not really THAT expensive..you can MAKE it yourself if you really want to...and as long as we&#39;re in the kitchen with it and I make sure the mess is cleaned up...WHO CARES?! <br/>
<br/>
And now...I actually have a &quot;legal&quot; argument for playdough...with Megan&#39;s Early Intervention evaluation saying she has some gross/fine motor skills that are behind, playdough is good for working with to strengthen her hands and whatnot. I&#39;ve seen occupational therapists use it, so why not? Put that way, and Paul didn&#39;t have a problem with it. I bought quite a few shiny new packs of it for Christmas and the kids have had a blast with it and the cookie cutters I bought to go with them. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Homemade playdough used to be a staple in my house when my kids were <br/>
younger. It is easy and fun to make and homemade playdough can be a lot <br/>
more interesting than store-bought stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the recipe I usually use. To this add food coloring and any <br/>
kind of flavor extract - pineapple, chocolate, mint, vanilla, lemon, <br/>
etc.  Or add spices. You can make different textures - try oatmeal in <br/>
it &lt;G&gt;. Make it orange and put pumpkin pie spices in it for <br/>
Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Keep it in baggies.<br/>
<br/>
Play with more utensils than cookie cutters. Try legos &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
	• 	2 c Flour<br/>
	• 	2 c Water<br/>
	• 	1 c Salt<br/>
	• 	2 tb Cream of tartar<br/>
	• 	1 tb Oil<br/>
<br/>
Combine in a saucepan and heat until it forms a sort of stiff ball in <br/>
the pan. Then turn out onto newspapers and knead for a while as it <br/>
cools. Keep in baggies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833853093">To make the most vibrant colors I started using the Wiltons Icing <br/>
colors.  They are little bottles of colorant and you only need a <br/>
drop to give great color to a large natch of play dough.  Food <br/>
coloring nver gave me the depth the kids wanted.  We made Harry <br/>
Potter purple a few weeks back and Keirans favorite yellow a few <br/>
days ago.  I have never thought of adding the scents though!  My <br/>
kids are into smelling the candles at the store (of course <br/>
everything is yuck to them but they have to smell them all.  The <br/>
best baggies by far are the Ziploc bags with the acutal zippers.  <br/>
The kids can open and close it easily.  Last time we left the <br/>
playdough outside, I am not sure if anyone closed the bag.  My 5yo <br/>
brought in the playdough, in the closed ziploc and asked me to keep <br/>
it inside so it would last longer. <br/>
<br/>
 My kids enyoy mushing it around their action figures more <br/>
than &quot;typical&quot; playdough games like cookie cutters.  Amazingly, they <br/>
can spend hours just doing that and a new batch just brightens sup <br/>
the day!  We have a patio so it is great to let them play out there <br/>
till hearts content and not have to worry about it getting in <br/>
carpets and such.<br/>
<br/>
We bought the boys Nickelodean Goop for Christmas and they LOVED <br/>
it.  I always forget to buy the Borax to make my own, I even bought <br/>
a huge tub of glue all ready for it!  The Nick one came in science <br/>
beakers and had sparkles, etc.  HOURS and HOURS of play with that <br/>
stuff!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621951370">I forgot to mention that the wilton colors seem a bit pricy at <br/>
frist.  I think about $10-12 for a pack of 8-10.  BUT, you use so <br/>
little each time, it will last you for a really long time.  Much <br/>
cheaper than food coloring in the long run which I used tons of to <br/>
try and get a strong color.  This product make the loveliest colors <br/>
I have found, comparable to store bought.<br/>

*****************************************<br/>
<br/>
I use the basic recipe that was already posted.  For the fall, I simply<br/>
mixed about 2 tsp. total of the spices you put in pumpkin pie (cloves,<br/>
cinnamon, ginger) and squirted in red and yellow food coloring until it was<br/>
about the right color.<br/>
<br/>
I have also added about 10 drops of whatever essential oil sounds good to<br/>
me.<br/>
