<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532518718">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a dd who is intensely into Harry Potter, and I understand that<br/>
there are all kinds of literature from various countries woven throughout<br/>
the Harry Potter books.  Some are Norse legends.  So, I was curious what<br/>
your children are reading.  My daughter is 9, and I&#39;m looking for content<br/>
that would be appropriate for a 9yo&#39;s sensibilities although lately she<br/>
seems to be able to handle scary stuff, which most of history seems to<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ruth<br/>
<br/>
