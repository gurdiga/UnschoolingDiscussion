Sorry Sandra, but I&#39;m still going to use antibacterial hand soap after <br/>
using the toilet, changing a poopy diaper, handling raw meat or poultry, <br/>
taking a subway, etc. Am I leading the human race to a problem with <br/>
resistant bacteria?<br/>

I took Microbiology is college (I got a C and was, for the first time ever, <br/>
pleased with a grade because I KNEW I earned it. It was a tough class and <br/>
comparatively a C there would have been equal to an A in any other class - not that <br/>
it matters a whit) Anyhoo, I took Microbiology in college and we studied <br/>
sanitary habits, hand washing and Anti-bacterial soaps in detail. It&#39;s the ACTION <br/>
of handwashing, the running water, that removes bacteria. Soap acts simply as <br/>
a &quot;lifter&quot; of dirt. One can have a very similar effect just from rinsing and <br/>
rubbing.<br/>
So anti-bacterial soap is kinda like overkill (pardon the pun). The <br/>
anti-bacterial properties don&#39;t make too much difference since it doesn&#39;t stay on your <br/>
hands long enough to be effective. The only way that true anti-bacterial <br/>
effects are seen is through high heat sterilization.<br/>
I don&#39;t think I will ever put my hands into an autoclave for 30 minutes.<br/>
