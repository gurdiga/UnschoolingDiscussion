<div id="ygrps-yiv-91783181">I must not be that observant since I didn&#39;t recognize the name Marshall Brain - the author of &quot;The Teenager&#39;s Guide to the Real World&quot;.  I get emails from him every day!<br/>
<br/>
We get a free subscription to howstuffworks.com.  Leslie, if your kids liked his book, they may be interested in his website.  If I got the information on this site from this list, disregard this message.  <br/>

+ kids liked his book, they may be interested in his website.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes--they do like the website.  We also have the &quot;How Stuff Works&quot;<br/>
computer software and the &quot;How Stuff Works&quot; book.  (I think there&#39;s more<br/>
than one, but we just have the first.)  I didn&#39;t know he had an email list,<br/>
though...will look into that one.<br/>
