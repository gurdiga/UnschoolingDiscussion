<br/>
&gt; So help me let go of this need to want to take control and also the thoughts<br/>
&gt; that he ought to be &quot;doing&quot; more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He also did some math this morning with DH.  He thinks it&#39;s puzzles and he<br/>
&gt; did that for about 20 mins.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So some emotional support and support that this is normal and I&#39;ll get used<br/>
&gt; to this and the guilt will go away....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here it comes. Ready? :)<br/>
<br/>
Dawn: Get a life. No, I don&#39;t mean that in a nasty way. :) I mean I suggest<br/>
you quit standing over your son with a list of exciting things you&#39;d like<br/>
him to do right now, and get a list of exciting things you&#39;d like DAWN to do<br/>
right now, and do them. And when your son comes to you (eventually, he will<br/>
get hungry or bored or wonder where the heck you got to), invite him to join<br/>
you, and if he&#39;d rather do something else, worry then about striking the<br/>
balance between his needs and yours, his wants and yours.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, you&#39;re trying to drag him away from HIS real life, which is<br/>
watching the Magic School Bus for the third or thirty-third time in a day.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is not and should not be your entire life, or if it IS because<br/>
you love the whole of it so much you can&#39;t stop, then consider ways to<br/>
foster that without driving your son batty (contribute to or start a<br/>
homeschooling newsletter, think up a cool service for local homeschoolers,<br/>
answer a homeschooling help line, set up park days or event days, the<br/>
possibilities are endless).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been an issue for me for a bit. My son is 3, I&#39;m a single mom and <br/>
he&#39;s an only child. Now, we&#39;ve had some emotional stuff, family break up and <br/>
new home most obvious, so I&#39;m not trying to push any more independence than <br/>
what he feels comfortable right now. If he feels clingy, I hug him closer. <br/>
<br/>
I love the suggestion of trying things that interest me, and offering him to <br/>
help. I&#39;ve tried this with cooking, painting shelves, sewing, etc. And he <br/>
usually is very interested, then gets bored and wants to go to something <br/>
else, which I completely understand. The problem comes up when he say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
done&quot; and then wants me to stop too...in the middle of the shelves or the <br/>
half cooked meal (sewing could wait).<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At three, it&#39;s trickier than it is at four or five or six. You can start the<br/>
process of, &quot;That&#39;s fine, you can be done, but I need to just finish up this<br/>
part&quot; but it might not always go over well. :)<br/>
<br/>
But, the drill is, &quot;Okay, if you don&#39;t want to help me paint why don&#39;t<br/>
you... (play with your legos or go look at that book or... for a few minutes<br/>
while I get to a stopping point?<br/>
<br/>
And then I hope you&#39;ll tell me he still sleeps 12 hours a day so that you<br/>
can get to a good stopping point and you have time to finish the shelves on<br/>
your own. ;)<br/>
<br/>
For awhile, it&#39;s just a developmental thing -- as he gets older, he&#39;ll have<br/>
more sustained interest in HIS projects if not yours and will be more able<br/>
to do things on his own for a bit while you do what you need to. For now,<br/>
it&#39;s just the process of modeling to him that some things can&#39;t be stopped<br/>
on a dime, and some things can, and breathing deeply a lot when he doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand it in a REALLY loud way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

to be a night owl anyway. Thanks for all the suggestions, I&#39;ve done some of <br/>
that, I think I just wondered if it was a time of age thing or not. So it&#39;s <br/>
refreshing to hear that it is. I love the breathe thing too, we both seem to <br/>
use that in a *lot* of instances. :-)<br/>
