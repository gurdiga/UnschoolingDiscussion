<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096206313">Yesterday  at breakfast my 7yr old son turned to me and said quite out of the <br/>
blue&quot; Mom, naked mole rats are REALLY naked!&quot;<br/>
We enjoyed a real belly laugh, and both said they are indeed. Son finished <br/>
his breakfast and trotted off to build a fort behind the couch and play with <br/>
the toddler sister. This lasted all morning, with breaks to shoot sister <br/>
gently with Nerf ball blaster and then lie in the fort listening to a Lemony <br/>
Snicket book-on-tape. The snow fell copiously, I baked cookies, nursed the <br/>
toddler off to sleep on the couch, checked the volumes of e-mail and drank <br/>
chai tea. <br/>
When tape ended and baby woke, we went out and played in the snow for an  <br/>
hour.<br/>
During this day, I felt such peace and contentment that I realized I needed <br/>
nothing fancy or planned or in particular to go through our unschooling life. <br/>
Just us.<br/>
Enjoy!!!!!<br/>

about naked mole rats on the Kim Possible show.<br/>
