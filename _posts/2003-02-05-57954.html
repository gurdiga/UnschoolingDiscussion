<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918814622"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I am sure as <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my children age, I will offer more and more freedom as I have already done<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that in many areas of their lives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many people say that. Many find that since they have made their children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; decisions for them that when given the opportunity the children will<br/>
&gt; deliberately choose the things they weren&#39;t allowed before just because they<br/>
&gt; can. And as the children get older, the things they can choose are a lot<br/>
&gt; more dangerous than how much TV they should watch so there is rarely a good<br/>
&gt; later age to start until it&#39;s too late and their gone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joyce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is it, exactly. Time after time I have heard good, kind, thoughtful <br/>
parents who always did what they thought was best for their children <br/>
wonder where they went wrong when their older children made poor <br/>
choices. A child doesn&#39;t learn how to make good choices by having <br/>
someone else make them for him. A child learns how to make good choices <br/>
by making choices himself and learning from them.<br/>
<br/>
Another common thing I hear is older adults talk about how *their* <br/>
parents never really seemed to listen to them or to see their needs as <br/>
separate from the parents needs/wants. This leads to lifelong pain and <br/>
suffering. Our children our not just mirrors to reflect our parenting <br/>
glory. When they fuss, nag, shout, yell, scream, slam doors, cry and <br/>
tell us they are unhappy -- then they *are* unhappy and we need to <br/>
listen to them.<br/>
<br/>
This was posted on another list and don&#39;t think she&#39;d mind if I reposted <br/>
it here:<br/>
<br/>
On the left are the &quot;attitude&quot; statements that kids say and on the right <br/>
is what they are really trying to say:<br/>
<br/>
CHILDREN WANT THEIR WAY . JUST LIKE ADULTS DO!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not my boss. --- I&#39;d like a choice.<br/>
You can&#39;t make me. --- Can we talk about this?<br/>
I&#39;m telling Dad. --- Please listen to me.<br/>
You&#39;re not my friend. --- I&#39;d like a turn.<br/>
I hate you. --- I didn&#39;t like what you said.<br/>
I&#39;m not your slave. --- This doesn&#39;t seem fair.<br/>
You&#39;re mean. --- This is important to me-please listen.<br/>
Shut up. --- I need to take a break.<br/>
I&#39;ll do what I want. --- I need to try.<br/>
You&#39;re stupid. --- There are things I need you to understand.<br/>
You don&#39;t love me. --- I need attention.<br/>
Fine! --- I&#39;m feeling pushed.<br/>
You just don&#39;t understand. --- Please listen to my point of view.<br/>
Everyone else can. --- I don&#39;t want to be left out.<br/>
What are you going to do about it? --- I feel like I&#39;m capable and <br/>
responsible.<br/>
Mom says .. --- I&#39;m confused.<br/>
It&#39;s not fair. --- I feel left out.<br/>
You&#39;re being so old-fashioned. --- I&#39;m feeling pressured.<br/>
This is dumb. --- I don&#39;t know how.<br/>
I can&#39;t do it. --- Please help me.<br/>
I have rights. --- Please let me have a choice.<br/>
I don&#39;t care. --- I&#39;m scared.<br/>

&lt;&lt; When they fuss, nag, shout, yell, scream, slam doors, cry and <br/>

listen to them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Guess what?<br/>
<br/>
People who are regulars here won&#39;t be surprised.<br/>
Some of the new people won&#39;t believe it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t yell, scream, slam doors, cry or tell me they&#39;re unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they fuss and nag a little. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Holly&#39;s unhappy about something she&#39;ll say so, but she&#39;s happy with her <br/>
life and says so.<br/>
<br/>
When we first moved, Kirby was nine and unhappy to have moved, his dad was <br/>
working in another state and wasn&#39;t here much, Kirby hates changes and was <br/>
turning ten and eleven with younger siblings in the house.  One of his means <br/>
of expression was slamming his bedroom door.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually the frame slid in and the wood around the latch plate broke.  <br/>
Repairs weren&#39;t possible without squaring the frame again.  He went a while <br/>
without being able to latch his door.   <br/>
<br/>
He got older, realized he had broken his door himself over time, and when <br/>
Keith finally did get a chance to fix it and put a lock on it and all, Kirby <br/>
was careful (and had matured past the desire to slam, too).<br/>
<br/>
The other two haven&#39;t been slammers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I learned not to yell or slam doors or express too much <br/>
because it wasn&#39;t going to do any good.  I gave up on  some stuff, and just <br/>
watched the calendar until I was old enough to leave.  That&#39;s not good <br/>
behavior, that&#39;s going underground.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; When they fuss, nag, shout, yell, scream, slam doors, cry and <br/>
tell us they are unhappy -- then they *are* unhappy and we need to <br/>
listen to them. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people say &quot;Kids are just that way.&quot;  &quot;Kids will be kids.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Teens have to rebel and act out&quot; or whatever all phrases parents say to each <br/>
other which mean &quot;Let&#39;s ignore them and blame them or hormones for their <br/>
unhappiness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I cried myself to sleep lots of times, being disappointed, <br/>
in trouble, furious, scared, lonely, hating the dark...  <br/>
<br/>
My kids go to sleep happy.<br/>

never been a place of exile or punishment.<br/>
