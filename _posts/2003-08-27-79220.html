 </span></blockquote>Lists often seem like resource centers with people who have nothing else to<br/>
do but sit around eagerly awaiting questions to answer. But the majority of<br/>
people on the list are here because they take time out of their busy lives<br/>
to help other parents get to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re basically asking us to do your work for you of translating<br/>
unschooling into a schoolish environment. (I think.) Some might think that&#39;s<br/>
fun but that isn&#39;t why we take time out of our lives. Basically you&#39;ll have<br/>
to take what we&#39;re offering to parents and see what you can do with it to<br/>
suit your needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988002648">Cay&#39;s asking about typical unschooling days reminded me that I meant to<br/>
bring over something Betsy (ecsamhill) wrote on the Unschooling-101 list.<br/>
It&#39;s not about a typical day but about the aspect of being both involved in<br/>
our kids lives while also giving them the freedom to pursue what they need<br/>
to pursue. Too often when we try to describe it, people pick up one aspect<br/>
or the other: either we&#39;re with them all the time or we&#39;re totally hands off<br/>
waiting for them to tell us what they need. But it&#39;s neither. It&#39;s something<br/>
else entirely which Tom Peters seems to have captured. -- Joyce<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Tom Peters, who co-wrote the book In Search of Excellence, said that<br/>
&gt; companies that wanted to empower their workforce and excell needed to<br/>
&gt; have management structures that were simultaneously loose and tight.<br/>
&gt; Sounds contradictory, but I think there are parallels to unschooling,<br/>
&gt; which we sometimes talk about in such confusing ways.  It could be the<br/>
&gt; contradictions that make it confusing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In unschooling, parents have to be both &quot;hands on&quot; and &quot;hands off&quot;,<br/>
&gt; simultaneously.  On the &quot;hands on&quot; hand, parents have to be connected to<br/>
&gt; their children, involved with their lives, and also have to be engaged<br/>
&gt; and available.  But on the other hand (the hand that&#39;s &quot;off&quot;) parents<br/>
&gt; need to be confident, trusting, patient, and permissive.  By<br/>
&gt; &quot;permissive&quot; I mean they need to permit their children to be themselves,<br/>
&gt; rather than nudging them and nipping them too much towards being some<br/>
&gt; other type of more conventional or better paid person.<br/>
