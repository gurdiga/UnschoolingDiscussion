&gt; we live now out in the country, we could use about 2 dozen cats to keep up<br/>
&gt; with the mouse population. Our two do the best they can, but cannot keep up<br/>
&gt; with the mice. I have almost resigned myself to living with mice as it has<br/>
&gt; been so hard to get rid of them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get more cats, they&#39;re out there for free or cheap on other farms or in the<br/>
newspaper (harder to find at this time of year since most cats start coming<br/>
into season in the early spring, but wait until May through August and any<br/>
community is swimming with free kittens). A few of them won&#39;t kill (no<br/>
instinct) but most will, or will learn. And a terrier wouldn&#39;t be a bad bet,<br/>
either. Jack Russells are fantastic rat/mouse killers, and tireless, and<br/>
they kill for sport so they&#39;ll kill a lot. Staffordshire Bull Terriers (the<br/>
smallest of the so-called Pit Bull breeds) are great, too. Any of the<br/>
terriers, and many other breeds (one of the best rat and gopher killing dogs<br/>
I had was a female Border Collie).<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll always have mice in the country, it&#39;s a fact of life :) but you can<br/>
up the predator population for controlling them, and you don&#39;t have to breed<br/>
your own to do it, you can save some lives by adopting in others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254850517">Something else I&#39;ve learned from experience...As a general rule, if yo <br/>
want a good mousing cat, find a litter whose mama was an <br/>
indoor/outdoor cat.  Sadly, a lot of strictly indoor cats lose their <br/>
natural instincts. <br/>
