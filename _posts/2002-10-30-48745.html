&lt;&lt; That&#39;s when kids sniff inhalents of various<br/>
kinds, most often aerosol cans, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did that twice in high school.  We used something that was for numbing <br/>
skin.  I don&#39;t remember now what it was called.  It already had numbing stuff <br/>
in it though.  (Darn... what was that?  The can had green on it...)   The <br/>
effect lasted about a minute.  It was like anesthesia, but being awake.   <br/>
(Bactine, maybe, but maybe another fancier brand of that sort of thing.)<br/>
<br/>
I  had no idea that people did it habitually.  None of my friends did.  <br/>
<br/>
I heard later that my younger cousin (aforementioned younger abusive cousin <br/>
who lived with me) did it with one of our uncles--sniffing paint.  I have no <br/>
idea what kind of paint.  Spray paint?  Honestly I don&#39;t know.<br/>

Wow, You can huff Bactine??? There&#39;s something new I learned today!! I use <br/>
to get high off of spray paint but not because I wanted to. I was a display <br/>
person in a large dept. store and the room we had to make the dispalys in <br/>
had no windows. Made getting creative very easy!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a huge problem in the Canadian north.  I&#39;m not sure why there so much<br/>
more than elsewhere.  Kids get badly addicted to it, and lots of babies have<br/>
been born affected by it.  They&#39;ll sniff almost anything they can get their<br/>
hands on, gas, White Out,  nail polish remover, I&#39;m not sure what all else.<br/>
