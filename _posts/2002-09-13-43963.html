<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602620817">Hi, Folks!<br/>
<br/>
I just found out about the SOS conference in Columbia, S.C. in a few weeks <br/>
(October 11-13), and I&#39;m really excited about going!!!  My husband&#39;s not <br/>
going to be able to go, but Liam (7) and I raring to anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Although the price of the conference itself is extremely reasonable, the <br/>
room rates are a wee bit steep for us.  We are considering camping (which <br/>
would be a lot of fun, too), but it seems like there&#39;s going to be a lot of <br/>
fun stuff going on into the night at the conference that we would like not <br/>
to miss if we can.<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, we are wondering if anyone might be interested in <br/>
sharing a room with us.  That would make this whole thing a lot more doable <br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, although we drive an &#39;92 Toyota Corolla (it&#39;s a great, <br/>
comfortable car, though), we would be delighted to offer a ride to someone <br/>
would like to go and needs a ride!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Marji <br/>
