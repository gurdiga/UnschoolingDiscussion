problems in my back. I was on so many different meds and had a bout w/ <br/>
ulcerative colitis and then a problem was caught 2 weeks before they took my <br/>
one med off the market for killing people. Lovely. Right now I have a major <br/>
headache from my neck and my back is burning and killing me, I&#39;ll be up most <br/>
of the night. I refuse to take anything anymore though. I only wish I could <br/>
afford my therapies more than once a month. I would feel 100 times better w/ <br/>
weekly or more treatments for a period of time.<br/>
