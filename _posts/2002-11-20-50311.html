<div id="ygrps-yiv-67055729">My boys are 9 and 11 and love watching scary movies and shows.<br/>
They don&#39;t have bad dreams or let it bother them, so it&#39;s not a problem for<br/>
us.<br/>
DH and I also watch it with them, so we&#39;re always there to remind them that<br/>
it&#39;s just a movie or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
A classic movie that I watched when I was a teen and never tire of is<br/>
&quot;Poltergeist&quot;. There&#39;s also a part II and III, I think.<br/>
<br/>
We recently rented a movie from Blockbuster called &quot;Rose Red&quot; written by<br/>
Stephen King that was pretty good. It&#39;s specifically about a huge haunted<br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Others&quot; with Nicole Kidman is a great movie to rent and watch with kids<br/>
if they can tolerate a little scariness. It&#39;s not even violent.<br/>
<br/>
How about &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; with Bruce Willis? My kids loved that one.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever it&#39;s on, we like to watch &quot;World&#39;s Scariest Places&quot; on the Family<br/>
Channel, although the scenarios are getting a little typical and fake to us<br/>
now. There were just a bunch on right before Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest son had wanted to watch the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; for the<br/>
longest time and we held back because it was rated R and because of all the<br/>
prevalent cussing throughout the movie. It was recently on TV though (FX<br/>
maybe?) and it went through the editing process and had all the cussing<br/>
taken out. So we finally let our kids watch the movie that way - they were<br/>
thrilled. At the end, they said it wasn&#39;t a scary movie at all and didn&#39;t<br/>
know what the big deal about it was. But I think they&#39;ll think twice about<br/>
it whenever we go camping. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest movies like &quot;Creepshow&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;-the<br/>
movie, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and even &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; the movie and also<br/>
the old shows are great too.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, so many ghost and haunted house movies are rated R and you<br/>
may have to just let that slide a little bit, with your best judgement and<br/>
maybe previewing them. Also, take advantage of those scary movies that are<br/>
edited for TV which may take the edge off a rated R movie. Scan your local<br/>
tv guide movie listings to see whats on each week.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun getting good and scared - bwaa ha haaaa<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t kow if it&#39;s PG-13, but I just watched Truly, Madly, Deeply, and it&#39;s <br/>
about ghosts, and it&#39;s pretty uplifting, too!!<br/>
<br/>
There is a story about the ghost of a child, but doesn&#39;t show her. <br/>
And there&#39;s the nephew of the main character, a minor character.  No other <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756306456">Not sure why you are looking for PG 13 movies, whether it&#39;s the language or <br/>
just scare factor so I&#39;m not sure how these would be.<br/>
<br/>
Poltergeist in my opinion is a great movie, the first more so than the rest <br/>
that follows. The Others with Nicole Kidman was very good. Some like <br/>
Amityville Horror as a classic haunted house movie. The Shining is great <br/>
although much creepier than the previous ones. Sixth Sense I didn&#39;t like but <br/>
some say was great. 13 Ghosts I think it&#39;s called. Didn&#39;t see it though. One <br/>
of my favorites, which isn&#39;t scary at all was Beetlejuice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835269866">I don&#39;t have a movie idea, but I just learned of a web site where you can learn everything about the content of the movie before you watch it or let your kids watch it.  It&#39;s called www.screenit.com<br/>
It is a very helful website.<br/>
