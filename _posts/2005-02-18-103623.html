in my mind&#39;s picture of &quot;scaffolding&quot; it&#39;s the older, more <br/>
established facts that you have in your mind, upon which you hook new <br/>
facts. It supports the new thoughts, but is mostly open.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a principle of cognition/learning that says that one can only learn something that connects to something he already knows.  SO nothing ABSOLUTELY new and unrelated can stick.  It can hardly be perceived.  It has to have pre-existing connections.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know who said that, but after I read it in college, I never saw anything to make me doubt it, and lots to reinforce it in me.<br/>

and the teacher talked about creating memory hooks, a sort of <br/>
mnemonic system, to hang anything on. She called it a framework, and <br/>
I pictured scaffolding.<br/>
