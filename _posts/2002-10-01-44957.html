&lt;&lt; My sister doesn&#39;t feel that<br/>
not seeing this three year old is an option.  The little boy is sweet and<br/>
very nice to my niece, and he is starting to get upset that she is mean to<br/>
him.  Any advice?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My ideas, not necessarily in order of what&#39;s best:<br/>
<br/>
Coach the little boy to just discuss it with her.  Ask her &quot;Who DO you like?&quot;<br/>
Or he could say &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll like me better when you&#39;re older.&quot; <br/>
Or &quot;So do you want me to go home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The boy&#39;s mom could say directly and nicely to the little girl that that&#39;s a <br/>
sad thing to say and she wished the little girl wouldn&#39;t say that to her boy. <br/>
 (I would have done that way already, personally.)<br/>
<br/>
Your sister could pass that advice on to the other family.<br/>
<br/>
But from her point of view, she should coach her OWN daughter on what&#39;s okay <br/>
to say and what&#39;s NOT okay to say.   And she herself could apologize to the <br/>
boy (probably already does) and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry she says that. I hope she <br/>
won&#39;t always be this way.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Has she asked the girl what would make the situation better?<br/>
<br/>
If the mom has already declared the visits &quot;not an option,&quot; then maybe the <br/>
little girl is expressing her frustration with THAT.<br/>
<br/>
I think kids should have an option not to play with someone.  Anyone.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe not help, but maybe somewhere in there is the germ of something <br/>
useful.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems indelicate, and I&#39;m sorry, but is the mom maybe saying stuff<br/>
about the little boy that the three year old is picking up on?  <br/>
Sometimes other people&#39;s kids get on our nerves when our own don&#39;t. <br/>
Could she be saying anything that the little girl is just passing along? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably not it, so I&#39;d ask the little girl why she doesn&#39;t like<br/>
him because maybe she has a good reason.  Does she have to share things<br/>
that are important to her and she doesn&#39;t want to share?  Maybe the mom<br/>
could put those thing away while the little boy is there.  Maybe the<br/>
little girl just needs to be assured he&#39;s only visiting and not staying<br/>
and he won&#39;t take anything of hers away when he goes.  Maybe she doesn&#39;t<br/>
like sharing her mom?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934775448">All I can say is that I wouldn&#39;t like it if someone made me hang around with <br/>
someone else I didn&#39;t really like or want to be with.  If it&#39;s not an option to not <br/>
go to their house, then maybe let then play in different rooms or she can <br/>
bring her own toys, etc.  If they are being forced to play together, then the <br/>
hatred will only get worse and it will backfire.  Children need to feel that it is<br/>
ok to have these feelings.  There is no way for them not to say them out loud<br/>
because they don&#39;t know any other way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a friend who does this, although he is four.  He seems to do it to <br/>
get a rise out of whomever is the unliked one.  Mostly, that&#39;s my son.  But <br/>
my son doesn&#39;t really respond, I think he understands it&#39;s ok not to like his <br/>
friend sometimes too.  This boy gets a rise out of his mother instead.  Once, <br/>
I suggested we leave and he decided that wasn&#39;t a good idea.  I also told him <br/>
once that it was ok not to like my two, but that then he shouldn&#39;t ask to <br/>
play with them so often!  He smiled.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, the child was begging for a reaction, a negative attention is <br/>
better than no attention kind of thing.  That&#39;s my 2 cents anywya.<br/>
