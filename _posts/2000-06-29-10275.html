say &quot;I want to learn wordworking.&quot; The teacher, whose job it is to find a way for<br/>
the child to learn wordworking (or math, or whatever) will try to find an<br/>
appropriate mentor.  Then a formal contract will be drawn up between the 3 of<br/>
them.  The student contract might say, &quot;I agree to come on time to a lesson,<br/>
every other day for 2 hours, for the next 2 months, to listen carefully, to take<br/>
notes, to clean up after myself, etc., etc.&quot;  The mentor might say -- &quot;I agree to<br/>
mentor the student so that s/he will learn the following skills in the next two<br/>
months -- then a list of skills, or tools to be used, etc. etc.&quot;  The &quot;teacher&quot;<br/>
would contract to mediate any conflicts, to check in from time to time, and to<br/>
help evaluate at the end of the two month period.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, we aren&#39;t so formal, but we work based on a similar principle.<br/>
Just exposing a child to a subject area or something of interest may not<br/>
necessarily help her understand what kind of commitment -- time (both daily and<br/>
period of weeks, months, or years) and resources might be necessary to master<br/>
it.  So, to learn the violin for example, my daughter will agree to a certain<br/>
amount of weekly practice, to pay attention during lessons, to suggest music she<br/>
wishes to learn, etc.  We will agree to pay for the lessons, to get her to<br/>
lessons on time, to ask her (not too often!) how her practice is going and<br/>
whether the teacher&#39;s instructions are clear enough, and then to choose a time<br/>
(say 3 months or 6 months) to evaluate how the contract is working.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about the Sudbury contract (and I think it is okay to have formal<br/>
contracts even with the youngest children) is that kids immediately pick up on<br/>
the fact that their education is a two- or three-way deal, and that parents and<br/>
teachers have obligations just like they do.  The second thing I like about the<br/>
contract approach is that it helps children understand that many things are not<br/>
learned easily or instantly, and that this is okay!  Most important of all, they<br/>
learn that they can fulfill their own chosen knowledge quests by making the<br/>
necessary commitment to it, and that adults can be helpful in helping them figure<br/>
out what might be needed, but it is ultimately their own responsibility to take<br/>
charge of their education.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of examples of &quot;contracts&quot; (though I don&#39;t talk about them as such)<br/>
in my book.<br/>
