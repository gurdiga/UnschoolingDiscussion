<div id="ygrps-yiv-992769091">Here&#39;s a plug for nursing!!<br/>
<br/>
It is incredibly versitile. <br/>
<br/>
Nurses are the ones usually most directly working with patients and who can make a huge difference in how a patient feels.  <br/>
<br/>
The education is cheaper (and shorter, depending on what you want to do).  <br/>
<br/>
The hours are better and much more flexible (this depends of course on where you choose to work).  <br/>
<br/>
You *can* subcontract instead of being employed, (I do this on the side) in which case you are in total control of your own schedule (to the extent that work is available).<br/>
<br/>
You can even do travel nursing and work in various parts of the country (or even the world) while having your housing and travel expenses paid for you (I&#39;m thinking of going to Hawaii).  <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to fight with insurance companies or patients to get paid.  <br/>
<br/>
Nurses have much more power these days...to influence politics, medicine, research, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship between nurses and physicians is much better than it was years ago.  It is a collaborative relationship, not a subordinate relationship anymore.  Nurses have real input into patient treatment decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Nurses can get into all the same fields that doctors can. Nursing crosses all lines of the corporate world too.  Nurses are also business managers, malpractice attorneys, and legal consultants. <br/>
<br/>
Hospitals are competing for good nurses with very attractive sign on bonuses (up to $10,000) and benefits.<br/>

  &gt; I just thought it was an interesting comment on the cult of a pre-med <br/>
  &gt; discipline we faced growing up and children are still facing today.  Also, <br/>
  &gt; it <br/>
  &gt; was interesting to see how strongly cultures can push their children to <br/>
  &gt; succeed to a standard the children might not own.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Frankly if you talk to any practicing doctor today there is little reason to <br/>
  encourage your child to even THINK about being a doctor.  It&#39;s a constant <br/>
  game with insurance companies and trying to get paid, lots and LOTS of hours, <br/>
  huge students loans, unless of course you get scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
  If you as a parent were to examine the idea of what to &quot;encourage&quot; your child <br/>
  to be to earn the most money and have the most prestige it wouldn&#39;t be to <br/>
  become a doctor for sure!  <br/>
<br/>
  It would BE... A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE!!!!  But then of course that is <br/>
  considering they have any talent in that area, but as for anything else, I <br/>
  guess you would have to have some kind aptitude for whatever you do. <br/>
<br/>
  I have an older son who is an apprentice to a master carpenter.  He&#39;s doing <br/>
  what he loves.  He doesn&#39;t make much money, is often cold and wet while <br/>
  working or sunburned beyond belief but it makes him happy and isn&#39;t that all <br/>
  that matters?  Well mostly in this world anyway.<br/>

<br/>
One of the wealthiest, best paid people I know is a nurse anesthesist who <br/>
gradually came to be known as willing to travel.  She will be flown somewhere <br/>
to work a week, stay in nice places, be paid huge amounts of money, visit, <br/>
tour, eat in great restaurants at someone else&#39;s expense, and go home richer.<br/>
