&gt; Fishburn.  Marty and I have been Lawrence Fishburn fans since he was <br/>
&gt; Cowboy Curtis<br/>
&gt; on PeeWee&#39;s Playhouse, and we rooted for him in Searching for Bobby <br/>
&gt; Fisher,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too! I love Lawrence (doesen&#39;t he have a nickname?)--and especially <br/>
when he was Cowboy Curtis singing about &quot;There&#39;s all Kinds Of Flowers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I actually saw him recently, without a mob around him, but his bodyguard <br/>
had a fierce look on his face, so I let him be...(He&#39;s a bit chubbier <br/>
nowadays, but still cute).<br/>
