<div id="ygrps-yiv-549776432">Thanks Sandra and Joyce, I see what you&#39;re saying and will spend even <br/>
more time at your websites to grasp living &quot;unschooling&quot; better.  I <br/>
appreciate the time you all have given me.  My heart is to embrace <br/>
this and where the heart goes the mind will follow.<br/>
