&gt; Fundraising is ONLY okay in my mind if the product or service offered is <br/>
&gt; actually WORTH what is being charged AND if the people paying for it feel <br/>
&gt; like they are making a fully free choice.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, my partner Beth works for a Girl Scout council. The <br/>
Girl Scouts, as you probably know, are famous for cookie sales. As a result, <br/>
Beth is very sensitive to types of organiztion fundraising. She&#39;s an easy <br/>
touch for kids on sales (often actually buys GS cookies! from girls at <br/>
church!), but HATES it when kids stand outside of stores just asking for <br/>
money. She thinks they need to DO something for it. (It is against GS policy <br/>
to do that.)<br/>
<br/>
The GS cookies sale is considered as much program as fundraising, and when <br/>
done correctly the girls make plans, set goals, etc.<br/>
