&gt; math concept/activity books - she can do it from the first to the last<br/>
&gt; pages and satisfy her urge to do it that way - but would probably get a<br/>
&gt; lot more out of it than a regular geometry text - even Jacobs (which is<br/>
&gt; very cool). &quot;How Math Works&quot; is a good example. Or &quot;Joy of Mathematics&quot;<br/>
&gt; by Theoni Pappas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Will do. Probably will get one of those last two and the Jacobs. Anyone got<br/>
one for sale?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, Pam!<br/>

before the glazed look comes. I often ask my kids, &quot;Do you want the long<br/>
answer or the short answer?&quot; Really, if you pay attention, you will know<br/>
what&#39;s right. They will let you know.<br/>
