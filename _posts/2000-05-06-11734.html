I would have to agree with you also.  I didn&#39;t take it at all as a flame, <br/>
just someone frustrated over the situation many of us find ourselves in.<br/>
<br/>
We too would starve should my husband decide to stay home (or live in a <br/>
paper box!)  My husband has always said it is my decision to homeschool or <br/>
not, since he will not be the one who is staying home to do it.  Also, he is <br/>
the one who thinks unschooling a good idea and often works with our kids <br/>
when he is home at night.  I now find it necessary to find a job, so I will <br/>
probably be working at least three nights a week and he will be on &quot;2nd <br/>
shift&quot;.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I appreciate your persective and I reread the post, 
and it still seems to have quite an angry tone.&nbsp; My husband is very 
involved in the educational process of our children and has encouraged 
homeschooling from the very beginning.&nbsp; He was conveying his trust in me by 
agreeing to go along with whatever method I thought best since I am with the 
children more than he is able to be.&nbsp; He was also honest in his feelings of 
being just a bit uncomfortable with unschooling simply because he has very 
little knowledge of this method.&nbsp; &quot;Quizzing&quot; the children is something he 
has always done as far as taking an active interest in what each child is 
learning and the types of things they find interesting and inspiring.&nbsp; I 
feel strongly that that is a very healthy attitude to have.&nbsp; I also 
understand that there are fathers out there who are not at all interested in the 
educational processes of their children, but this is not what I conveyed in my 
message, and thus did not deserve such a harsh reply.&nbsp; As long as everyone 
decides to drop the subject here, I am willing to do the same.&nbsp; I do, 
however feel that I deserve an apology, whether it be public or 
private.</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075182172">This is a very interesting thread... i&#39;m not sure if we should stop <br/>
discussing it though... my husband has always been interested/involved in the <br/>
children&#39;s learning process... but it&#39;s because i am so interested and <br/>
involved in it...as i&#39;ve said, my son was homeschooled for 2 years in 1st and <br/>
2nd grade, my daughter is staying home this september (7th grade for her)... <br/>
the rest of the time they&#39;ve been in public school... i&#39;m the one that most <br/>
often initiates the &quot;is your homework done?  do you need help?  why don&#39;t you <br/>
get started now on the project that&#39;s 2 weeks away?&quot; kind of questions... we <br/>
both have always helped together with all projects... but honestly, he&#39;s not <br/>
the consistent one, i am... because i have the time and energy to do it being <br/>
a stay at home mom.... as homeschoolers for our son, we each took on <br/>
different subjects to work with him on... i&#39;m hoping that&#39;s how it will also <br/>
work that way with my daughter... if he weren&#39;t so involved, i&#39;d definitely <br/>
resent his wanting to quiz the kids... in fact, i&#39;d freak out most likely ... <br/>
lol ... right now, we&#39;re having discussion on how to go about homeschooling a <br/>
7th grader... we have VERY different opinions... but since i&#39;m the one who <br/>
will be doing 70% of it, i will ultimately choose how i do it when she&#39;s with <br/>
me... my husband is a housepainter with his own business and i go to school 2 <br/>
days a week and need other blocks of time for study... so for those times, my <br/>
daughter will be with him and he can do it his way... maybe it will turn into <br/>
a fun competition on who she learns more from ... lol... <br/>

&gt; is that it seems to me they are at work most of the time and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; actually participate in the daily dealing with kids who are unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
I think many husbands participate a lot in their children&#39;s homeshooling<br/>
education. One of the things that makes me like this lifestyle so much is<br/>
the family participation. There are some things that I specifically save for<br/>
when mydh gets home.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; He said he is ok with unschooling as long as I understand that he will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; quizzing the kids from time to time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Although I don&#39;t agree with actual quizzing (because I don&#39;t believe in it<br/>
period), I do think that husbands have a vested interest in their children&#39;s<br/>
education and that is why they ask.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; like they are the teachers and the wives have to prove to them what the<br/>
kids<br/>
are learning or she won&#39;t be able to go on with it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  If my kids were in school I would want him to be communicationg with the<br/>
teacher and asking the kids what they learned.<br/>
<br/>
  My husband is not one of those<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll quiz them to see if they are up to the level I think they should be<br/>
at,<br/>
&gt; even though I&#39;m not around them most of the day&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband is not like this either, but just because he works, I would be<br/>
concerned if he didn&#39;t want to know things about my kid&#39;s education.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I completely ignored him because I knew he<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be the one doing the research and reading the books etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very sad if my husband wasn&#39;t a major part of the descion making<br/>
on atopic such as where my child would go to school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If they<br/>
&gt; are that interested in what&#39;s going on then they will be the ones to stay<br/>
&gt; home and see on a daily basis what they are learning, without coming home<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &quot;quizzing&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said at the beginning of my post, I think they are interested. The<br/>
one&#39;s that don&#39;t ask are the ones with the issues.<br/>
Just my .02 cents of course. All IMHO...YMMV<br/>

anyone from giving an opinion.&nbsp; Instead, since it was MY post that started 
the disagreement, I posted that I was willing to stop the disagreement.&nbsp; 
And in fact, I had not posted anything else until now, despite the many other

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20210656">this is JMO- but i don&#39;t understand why someone would be shocked and <br/>
upset by the fact that father/parental/adult control in a childs <br/>
education, is not blanketly supported/embraces by an unschooling <br/>
discussion group.  imo dawn was expressing a fairly acceptible <br/>
unschooling position and therefore there is no victim (hence no need <br/>
for apology) simply meshell maybe be someone who is more of a relaxed <br/>
schooler than an unschooler.  not a big deal.  <br/>
<br/>
this groups is for discussion of unschooling and control is not a <br/>
topic which would normally find much support here because it is not <br/>
consistant w/ unschooling as a general rule.   as individuals we may <br/>
struggle w/ control issue and discuss these struggles and this would <br/>
fall under deschooling.  but unschooling is child-led therefore if <br/>
someone other than the child steps in and says &#39;do it my way&#39; or <br/>
&#39;learn what i think is important&#39;  in that moment they have moved away <br/>
from unschooling principles and toward another method of learning.  no <br/>
shame in that.  unschooling IS a challenge for parent and that always <br/>
the best choice for family harmony but that is a family issue. <br/>

<div><strong><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Console">Hi 
Dawn,</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Console">I do not feel insulted 
about your reply.&nbsp; Everyone has a right to their opinion.&nbsp; However, I 
must state that my DH wants what is best for our children also.&nbsp; True, he 
is not there every day and does not know what goes on and he does not know if 
the children are learning or not.&nbsp; If the situation were reversed, and I 
was the one supporting the family, I would probably react the same way. I would 
want to make sure the girls were learning what they need to in order to survive 
in this world.&nbsp; Men and Women think differently and sometimes what he 
thinks is important, may not be so important to me and vise-versa!&nbsp; He, 
being in the work place, knows a little more about that factor of life than 
I.&nbsp; He knows what the kids need to know in order to survive in the 
workplace.&nbsp; I have been a SAHM for 15 years and have no clue to that part 
of life!&nbsp;</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font color="#000000" face="Lucida Console">We make our decisions 
together, he definitely does not make all the decisions for me!&nbsp; This is 
something that affects everyone in the family.&nbsp; And the children are 
involved in our decision </font></strong><strong><font color="#000000"
 face="Lucida Console">making as well.&nbsp; The education of our children is 
something that is a little more important and worth fighting for.&nbsp; He 
chooses his fights well (after being married for 18 years!), and the kids 
education and future is a cause worth fighting for! As it is for me as 
well!&nbsp; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font color="#000000"
 face="Lucida Console"></font></strong><strong><font
 face="Lucida Console"></font></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><font face="Lucida Console"><font color="#000000">Jeez</font>, I just 
re-read that and it sounds like we fight all the time!&nbsp; We are actually 
best friends!&nbsp; And he is easing up a lot on the &quot;prove it to me&quot; 
attitude on the girls schooling!&nbsp; Our Children&#39;s future is a big 
responsibility and we only get one shot at it, so we want to make sure it is 
being done right!&nbsp; </font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font face="Lucida Console"></font></strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><font face="Lucida Console">He also has a lot of good ideas that I 
want to utilize in the unschooling education of our girls!&nbsp; I was laughing 
last night about something he said when we first started our homeschooling 
adventure.&nbsp; Most of his ideas that he gave me for &#39;lessons&#39; were all geared 
toward unschooling!&nbsp; For example, he had the girls pick the ripe butternut 
squash, weigh, and measure them, then he had them write down every step they had 
to do to accomplish the task from walking out the front door, putting on their 
shoes, how many steps to the garden to getting out the scales and weighing and 
measuring to putting everything back up.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t sound like much, but 
it taught them how to follow (and give) directions.&nbsp; Another good idea he 
had was to calculate all of the water (in square inches and gallons) in our fish 
aquarium minus the displacement of the gravel.&nbsp; So even though he is 
suspicious about their education, he is on the right track!&nbsp; It is me who 
insisted they use the workbooks!&nbsp; I just run out of ideas after the first 
month! I know, I probably haven&#39;t quite grasped the full idea of unschooling 
yet, but that is why I joined this list!</font></strong></div>

    &gt;&gt;<br><br>Hi all:<br><br>I&#39;ve been silent for a while, but when 
    something annoys me I have to say <br>something.&nbsp; What I love 
    (sarcastic tone) about these &quot;husbands/fathers/men of 
    <br>children&quot; is that it seems to me they are at work most of the time 
    and don&#39;t <br>actually participate in the daily dealing with kids who are 
    unschooled.&nbsp; It&#39;s <br>like they are the teachers and the wives have to 
    prove to them what the kids <br>are learning or she won&#39;t be able to go on 
    with it.<br><br>I have found in all things that the less someone knows about 
    a subject, such <br>as unschooling, the Libertarian Party, England, 
    astrologer.... you pick the <br>subject, the more opinions they have about 
    why it won&#39;t work or if you would <br>do.... then it would be like 
    school...<br><br>I just think that living outside of the box as I do with 
    this unschooling <br>situation is very misunderstood by others.&nbsp; My 
    husband is not one of those <br>&quot;I&#39;ll quiz them to see if they are up 
    to the level I think they should be at, <br>even though I&#39;m not around them 
    most of the day&quot; husband and when we were <br>looking at sending Zak to 
    Preschool.&nbsp; He said something like &quot;I want to make <br>sure it&#39;s 
    blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah (you fill in the blanks)&quot;&nbsp; 
    My <br>response was &quot;that&#39;s nice dear&quot;... I completely ignored him 
    because I knew he <br>wouldn&#39;t be the one doing the research and reading the 
    books etc.&nbsp; If they <br>are that interested in what&#39;s going on then 
    they will be the ones to stay <br>home and see on a daily basis what they 
    are learning, without coming home and <br>&quot;quizzing&quot; 
    them.<br><br>Hopefully those of you who are married to these 
    &quot;types&quot; won&#39;t get defensive <br>about their behaviour but if you 
    do, maybe that&#39;s something to look at....<br><br>Dawn F<br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>

    is a very interesting thread... i&#39;m not sure if we should stop

    interested and <br>involved in it...as i&#39;ve said, my son was homeschooled 
    for 2 years in 1st and <br>2nd grade, my daughter is staying home this 
    september (7th grade for her)... <br>the rest of the time they&#39;ve been in

    homework done?&nbsp; do you need help?&nbsp; why don&#39;t you <br>get started 
    now on the project that&#39;s 2 weeks away?&quot; kind of questions... we 
    <br>both have always helped together with all projects... but honestly, he&#39;s 
    not <br>the consistent one, i am... because i have the time and energy to do 
    it being <br>a stay at home mom.... as homeschoolers for our son, we each 
    took on <br>different subjects to work with him on... i&#39;m hoping that&#39;s how 
    it will also <br>work that way with my daughter... if he weren&#39;t so 
    involved, i&#39;d definitely <br>resent his wanting to quiz the kids... in fact, 
    i&#39;d freak out most likely ... <br>lol ... right now, we&#39;re having discussion 
    on how to go about homeschooling a <br>7th grader... we have VERY different 
    opinions... but since i&#39;m the one who <br>will be doing 70% of it, i will 
    ultimately choose how i do it when she&#39;s with <br>me... my husband is a 
    housepainter with his own business and i go to school 2 <br>days a week and 
    need other blocks of time for study... so for those times, my <br>daughter 
    will be with him and he can do it his way... maybe it will turn into <br>a

Sorry, my computer crashed when I was responding to your post in response to <br/>
mine and it was lost. (I hope I spelled you name correctly.) I&#39;m trying to <br/>
understand what I failed to communicate here. You said we shouldn&#39;t &quot;write <br/>
off others &quot;, but I clearly said that I delete **after** reading. I said so <br/>
in two different posts on this subject.<br/>
<br/>
You also said that no one was telling her what should offend her. I never <br/>
said they were. I simply stated that **I** wasn&#39;t going to. I never accused <br/>
anyone of anything. I just said that she could always delete posts that were <br/>
offensive, instead of giving up on the list. I didn&#39;t say anyone had called <br/>
posts &quot;life-changing&quot;. Those were my words and I didn&#39;t attribute them to <br/>
anyone else. Why am I failing to communicate that I am open to other ideas <br/>
and opinions, but I am also offended by some things and simply, at times, <br/>
simply delete them? Normally I do this when I recognize from previous posts <br/>
that the person is of a certain opinion and I agree to disagree.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m offended and will delete all future posts from you! (LOL) I am <br/>

I am sure that none of the replies are ment as a flame, and forgive us if we <br/>
sound that way.  Please be patient with us, as some of us have had, to say <br/>
the least, very bad experiences with men (so called dads) and therefore are a <br/>
little more assertive than others.  If you are lucky enough to have one of <br/>
those marriages where your dh makes decisions that are truly in the best <br/>
interest of your children, then count yourself very blessed.  In this day and <br/>
age of court room battles (and I know, as I have been through one that has <br/>
left scars on both my son and myself) and parental rights taking precedence <br/>
over children&#39;s rights, some of us tend to be cinical.  So, please forgive us <br/>
if we come across as flaming, and try to remember the rough road we have <br/>
traveled, for the sake and protection of our children. <br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Amy<br/>
