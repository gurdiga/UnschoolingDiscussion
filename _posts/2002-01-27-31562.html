<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110855020"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Commas and grammar are not insubstantial.<br/>
&gt;Priorities, my dear!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL and a &lt;&lt;&lt;big grin&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
on the flip side here, NY schools have stopped teaching grammar years <br/>
ago. Something about the ethnicity of the area and most people having <br/>
English as a second language - and therefore there are not really any <br/>
grammar rules that can be decided as which is right or wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I found this out when one of my employees told me she was teaching her <br/>
son grammar because the schools didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit shocked.. but then after spending quite some time in computer <br/>
geekland, I realized that talking to people from all around the world who <br/>
don&#39;t speak the language but write it solely to communicate to others are <br/>
struggling enough for a common ground - grammar would definately confuse <br/>
the issue even more.<br/>
<br/>
So along with forgetting most of what I&#39;ve learned in school, grammar <br/>
became very low on the priority list and finding a way to communicate <br/>
became high.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I were a writer for a publication, I&#39;d definately want some <br/>
editing!!! There&#39;s nothing like looking like what you say has no value <br/>
because of it being sloppily presented.<br/>
<br/>

when I started doing creative writing.  For someone who was drilled <br/>
and drilled and drilled in catholic school about how it is supposed <br/>
to be, that was difficult.  When I was 18 I also had some lessons to <br/>
learn about making assuptions about people based on their use of <br/>
language.  I learned that there were some really intelligent people <br/>
out there with very poor grammar.<br/>
