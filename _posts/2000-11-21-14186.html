I&#39;ll take a stab at that.&nbsp; I would probably consider that homeschooling
is failing my daughter if she never showed an interest in learning anything...
sort of like public schooling failures, you know?
<p>Are there kids that seem to thrive better in a formal school environment?&nbsp;

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064743526">There are the occasional stories of children being <br/>
withdrawn from school to hide signs of abuse, and I <br/>
consider the hot-housed ones, the Ruth lawrences of the <br/>
world, to be failures if they can only relate to the <br/>
academic (or whatever) world they&#39;ve been produced for. <br/>
On these grounds, maybe I could include those who home <br/>
educate on strong religious or cultural grounds, and <br/>
keep their children segregated from other parts of <br/>
society.  They&#39;re fit for their own society, but not <br/>
the world as a whole, though if that&#39;s good or bad, i&#39;m <br/>
not sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-174633811">Well, I haven&#39;t heard of any serial axe murderers, nor any NZ Prime<br/>
Ministers or Ministers of Finance - yet &lt;g&gt;. But even if there were, would<br/>
that mean unschooling was at fault? Can we blame *anything* solely on school<br/>
or unschooling or mothers or fathers or yellow underwear or lemonade or<br/>
rotton tomatos?<br/>
<br/>
All we can do is our best for our children. I believe that that means<br/>
allowing them them the freedom to make their own mistakes and learn from<br/>
them. Personally, I believe that the more freedom a person has as a child<br/>
(within the bounds of them not harming others), the less likely they are to<br/>
become bad / unhappy / unkind / anti-social / destrucive people. But then,<br/>
my definition of success is to do with lives filled with generous helpings<br/>
of happiness, kindness, creativity, love, joy etc. But I can&#39;t prove any of<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
If your definition of sucess and failure is to do with money / position /<br/>
power then of course there are unschooling failures. But I think I know you<br/>
better than that, Marianne.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, our children will have to define success for themselves. Many of<br/>
us have come through our childhoods with a parent&#39;s definition attached and<br/>
have had a dreadful struggle to redefine the concepts of success, and many<br/>
other concepts, for ourselves. Along with with this hard work there has also<br/>
been, for a great many of us, bitterness about what our parent/s /teacher/s<br/>
did to us. This is because we learnt to be ordered and defined and arranged<br/>
by these people, which meant they were to blame when things went wrong - it<br/>
was someone else&#39;s fault. Until we learn to throw away the blaming, we can&#39;t<br/>
reach peace or acceptance, nor can we take positive action.<br/>
<br/>
I hope, even though my children may chose paths that I would not have chosen<br/>
for them, that they will at least know that it is their own path, and that<br/>
they can choose to change paths at anytime, through their own thoughts and<br/>
actions. That they are responsible for themselves and their own actions,<br/>
thoughts and paths. I have made many mistakes with my children, but the<br/>
biggest mistakes have been when I have tried to make my children accept me<br/>
making decisions and choices for them, have tried to take responsibility<br/>
from them. Still, fortunately, they are all as stubborn as their mother &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s no &#39;proof&#39; - I think unschooling is really an act of faith.<br/>
It&#39;s a good thing to believe in, IMO. Feels right to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree, but I&#39;d go a little further...any parenting choice is really an act <br/>
of faith.  While we may base our decisions on studies, personal experience, <br/>
opinion of someone we trust, or some other criteria, it still comes down to a <br/>
feeling about which is right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741179804">In a message dated 00-11-21 18:41:21 EST, you write:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Having a conflict of oppinions with my daughter 16.  When you wirte a<br/>
 sentence refering to a chapter in a book like &quot;In Chapter 13 the<br/>

 And when did they change the typing rules & only put a single space after<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m going to answer without seeing the rest to see if you get a clean two out <br/>
of three (or better).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you capitalize chapter in Chapter 13, but if you say &quot;the thirteenth <br/>
chapter&quot; you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Word processors were *SUPPOSED* to always put a larger space after a period.  <br/>
They promised they would, and typists were told to just put one space, <br/>
because the program would adjust for it.  Well huh.  If they had, they&#39;d&#39;ve <br/>
put a larger space after Dr. and etc. and Mrs. and all kinds of other things <br/>
which can fall inside a sentence, so they abandoned their campaign promise.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you say &quot;grammar&quot; it turns on the &quot;get picky&quot; switch, so I wanted to say <br/>
(irritatingly, I&#39;m sure) that neither of those questions had to do with <br/>
grammar.  They are &quot;mechanics of writing&quot; questions.  Tadaa...    Editorial <br/>
stuff.<br/>

In Chapter 13, the character showed great respect to her mother.<br/>

 And when did they change the typing rules & only put a single space after<br/>
 periods?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is pretty new, within the last year.  I can&#39;t remember where I read it <br/>
or <br/>
where the information came from but I recall thinking, hey they can&#39;t do that!<br/>
I guess the article was about college students who might be marked down<br/>
on their papers for not properly spacing.  Obviously I still have a hard time<br/>
using only one space myself!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just got back online...in fact that was my first post since we moved.  Yes, <br/>
we did get moved, DH&#39;s job is going quite well (he still has a one hour each <br/>
way commute, but swears it&#39;s worth it to have us all together &lt;BG&gt;).  No more <br/>
problem with the kidney stones or anything else (except getting the new <br/>
insurance company to recognize it is a proper expense for them to cover).  He <br/>
found a great place for us in the Hazel Dell area of Vancouver, WA.  It even <br/>
has a ramp for my wheelchair, for those days I need it.  We have to fix the <br/>
fence so the dogs will stay in the yard and we&#39;ll probably be another year <br/>
getting all the boxes unpacked, but I&#39;m happy that the actual move is behind <br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking.  It&#39;s always nice to feel welcomed back.<br/>

my question.  I was tired & after proofing dd&#39;s paper this was driving me<br/>
crazy.  &quot;Grammar&quot; was the only thing my brain could come up with.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853966358">Ruth Lawrence is a famous home-edder in the UK, she was <br/>
the youngest undergrad and grad at Oxford (I think, <br/>
might have been Cambridge but I don&#39;t think so)  Very <br/>
hot-housed and very insular, now that she&#39;s trying to <br/>
find herself and a life a little away from academia, <br/>
her daddy&#39;s all lost and lonely.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s the reason I knew that home-ed was legal in this <br/>
country, though, she&#39;s from my town.<br/>
