&lt;&lt; Some random thoughts, unconnected to your particular post: I guess I <br/>
 see the TV/no TV thing as just a matter of choice. I know some folks <br/>
 think kids who don&#39;t have TV are deprived, but really they just have <br/>
 different things in their lives during that time when they&#39;d be <br/>
 watching the TV. It doesn&#39;t have to be a value judgement - better or <br/>
 worse - it&#39;s just different. So, some families choose to watch TV, <br/>
 and some choose to do different things.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I would be the kids that had tv&#39;s in their homes did not have <br/>
unlimited access and that&#39;s exactly why they wanted access to yours right off <br/>
the bat.<br/>
Secondly, lets turn your above phrase around a little, and apply it to books.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be a value judgement-better or worse-it&#39;s just different. <br/>
So, some families choose to own books and some choose to do different things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds lame when you think about not owning any books eh?<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t keep any one source of communication or information from my <br/>
children that is in my realm of control to provide.<br/>
<br/>
As a child who was raised without tv, I can tell you just how incredibly <br/>
addictive it is for most children that have it limited.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But where we <br/>
 live, you get nada on TV without cable, and cable would cost us about <br/>
 $50 a month,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most all cable companies have a basic package that doesn&#39;t cost much at all. <br/>
You don&#39;t get as many channels, but it&#39;s great to get good reception and <br/>
still a lot of good channels.<br/>
Ours is only 11.90 a month.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A quick internet search revealed that in our area it&#39;s over $30.00. <br/>
That&#39;s 3 flights in our plane. The kids don&#39;t ask for cable TV. They <br/>
ask to fly. Why would I want to pay for something our family doesn&#39;t <br/>
want, instead of paying for something they do?? Why are people so <br/>
uncomfortable with the idea that some people (including some kids) <br/>
prefer other things to TV?? Isn&#39;t unschooling about choice and <br/>
following people&#39;s interests? TV seems to be a big sticking point for <br/>
people, like it&#39;s something everyone *must* have. I see it as one <br/>
option that we might choose to have. Right now, we don&#39;t choose to <br/>
pay to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Even after we&#39;ve spent a week in a motel with cable TV, the kids have <br/>
not asked us to get cable at home. Even after we go to friend&#39;s <br/>
houses that have TV, the kids have not asked us to get it. The kids <br/>
are exposed to it, it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t let them watch it when <br/>
we&#39;re someplace with a TV. They know what one is, they just prefer <br/>
other things. My son got a real bike for his birthday, with gears and <br/>
handbrakes and everything. He is totally in love with it and has <br/>
named it &quot;Bluebell&quot;. Should we have foregone buying him that (which <br/>
cost 10 months worth of basic cable) in order to provide him with <br/>
something else (cable) that he doesn&#39;t want? <br/>
<br/>
And now, I&#39;ve got to go pack up a lunch. The sun is shining and the <br/>
skies are blue, and after our open HS gymnastics time, we&#39;re going <br/>
flying.<br/>

***Why are people so <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no big deal at your house Robin.<br/>
My family has other things to do besides TV too.   Just because there&#39;s<br/>
TV in the house doesn&#39;t mean people never chose to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
The sad and sticky point would be if you&#39;re kids were wishing they had a<br/>
TV and you were insisting they didn&#39;t need one.  You say that&#39;s not the<br/>
case, that your kids don&#39;t ask for TV, and if everyone&#39;s happy that&#39;s<br/>
cool.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a serious bummer if your kids wanted TV but felt they<br/>
couldn&#39;t ask because you&#39;ve made your feelings about it known strongly<br/>
and they think they wouldn&#39;t get one anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s not about a TV or an airplane or a box of rocks, it&#39;s about<br/>
parents controlling what kids get to do because the parents have decided<br/>
they know what&#39;s best.<br/>
<br/>
My uncle had a Super Cub for years and then also bought a Cessna 140.  He<br/>
used to take us flying, his runway was a cow pasture, and we thought it<br/>
was perfect joy to go flying with him. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it depends on where you live. Since the Northwest has about 3 <br/>
dependable months without rain, almost every race imaginable is <br/>
squeezed into that timeframe - July through September, with August <br/>
being the least rainy and therefore most popular. There&#39;s two races <br/>
in August I want to do (actually there&#39;s about six, but I&#39;ve picked <br/>
two), and they bracket the conference. I&#39;m also trying to start a <br/>
triathlon club and do some coaching as well, so it will be a busy <br/>
season this year! The other months of the year I can do whatever, but <br/>
I&#39;ve got 6 - 8 races squeezed into a few months time...<br/>
