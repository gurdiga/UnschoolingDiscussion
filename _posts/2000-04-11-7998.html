<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365002016">We are interested in getting to a chiropractor as well.  I had <br/>
terrible back problems (beginning with my first pregnancy) which I&#39;m <br/>
sure were made worse by my deliveries.  My DH has been hospitalized <br/>
for back pain before and suffers occassional flare ups.  <br/>
<br/>
Also my elder son (who was a very difficult delivery) has asthma, <br/>
multiple allergies and sensativities, hyperactivity, tantrums, mood <br/>
swings, etc and I have been told that many of these things can be <br/>
eased by chiropractic care and exacerbated by long term problems left <br/>
untreated.  I once had a &quot;reading&quot; done on his neck/spine at a fair, <br/>
just for fun.  They told me he would most likely have many problems <br/>
stemming from his misalignments, which got me thinking more about it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked our family physician for a reference to an allergist and a <br/>
chiropractor (we are new in the state) and was told flatly that he <br/>
&quot;does not give referrals to chiropractors&quot; and was never contacted <br/>
with an allergist reference.  Which is another irritation in a string <br/>
of dissappointments with this doc, who delivered out second son, and <br/>
sees all of us as well.  I would have much preferred our family <br/>
practioner to be an osteopath, but could find none in this small town.<br/>
<br/>
So what do you chiropractic savvy patients have in the way of advice <br/>
on our situation?  What should I look for in a chiropractor?  What <br/>
should services cost me, allowing for regional differences?  Would it <br/>
be beneficial to take my three year old to see one for treatment?  <br/>
Etc... <br/>
