  God bless you!  You have 3 children, 2 of them small,  heck yes, go with the flow . . . why make it unpleasant for yourself and them?  Soon enough you will have more time for things like that.  What is important is to enjoy what you can do with her.  I&#39;m sure someone else will have some plan of action for you, but for me, I say, dont worry too much.<br/>
  Sending you good wishes across the sea,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569406713">Hey Michelle!<br/>
Sounds like you have a case of what a friend of mine has <br/>
coined &quot;PUPD&quot;...you have all the symptoms! lol It is &quot;Periodic <br/>
Unschoolers Panic Disorder&quot;! This prognosis is good...the symptoms will <br/>
pass! :) It tends to rear it&#39;s ugly head often at the beginning of the <br/>
school year....as other children &quot;get down to some serious <br/>
learning&quot;....but stay in tune with what amazingly wonderful <br/>
opportunities which your kids are being given, and all will be well! <br/>
Each family is choosing a path, and your path is just a different one, <br/>
with awesome opportunities and advantages of its own!<br/>
<br/>
Relax, and enjoy your children....and the path of least resistance! :)<br/>

Hey...<br/>
Those little books are only souvenirs for mothers, you know.<br/>
And those children have been robbed of the joy of making a little  <br/>
book *just for fun,* just because they want to.  It wasn&#39;t their  <br/>
idea, and can&#39;t be their idea EVER if the mom had the idea first.<br/>

Toilet roll crafts aren&#39;t even souvenirs for moms.  They&#39;re trash  <br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t READ the works of Shakespeare anyway, even when the kids are  <br/>
older.  Watch DVDs.<br/>

<br/>
Holly mentioned just the other days that the fairies she made are up  <br/>
in the top of her closet.  If we have a Christmas tree this year, I  <br/>
want to ask her to put them on there.<br/>
<br/>
You can work fairies and toilet paper rolls and Shakespeare all  <br/>
together over the next few years, and for the rest of your life.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were that little, I felt like life was whizzing by  <br/>
sometimes, and sometimes like they would be babies forever.  It&#39;s  <br/>
confusing, that sleep-deprivation and worry.  I still remember.  But  <br/>
with mine 15 (16 on Friday), 18 and 21 (I just talked to him on the  <br/>
phone while he was walking to work, many hundreds of miles away), I  <br/>
have hours to work on my webpages and I can plant flowers, and read  <br/>
books.  Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
Oh. That wasn&#39;t your question. &lt;g&gt;  But it&#39;s part of your answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265284424">It is easy to be afraid. It is easy to look at the faces of your young children and be ovewhelmed by the seemingly insurmountable task of raising them to be adults who can function in whatever the world is like in a little more than a decade. But no approach to parenting will calm the doubting voices in your head. I imagine that the home-educators whose children are creating mini-books are using these study moments, these forced activities to address the same fears that you experience when you look at their children. And I don&#39;t know that unschooling, with 3 young children, will help you to feel strong. I say that, not because I don&#39;t believe that unschooling prepares a child for &quot;the adult world&quot;, but because unschooling is so much about helping your child to be who they are now that it is much harder to see it as some training ground for future success. <br/>
<br/>
Envy is an easy place to live. I can read about people&#39;s days over at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a> and feel like our days aren&#39;t so sparkly and filled with the glory of the moment. Well, I could but one of ours is there, so it would be silly to envy what I clearly experience :]. It is easy to know other families and look into the moments that the moms share when you get together and think about how amazing that sounds, or gee, I wish my children did that. And the best way I know to fight that kind of envy isn&#39;t to think about the lack of Shakespeare in your lives but to focus on the things that your lives are filled with. Making fairies is important work. Telling stories about fairies, sitting close and touching and sharing and laughing and loving. Those are the important things. Because now is what matters. Not 10 years from now. If you take care of this moment, this child, than they will grow up strong and engaging and enviable. <br/>

<br/>
right here is the source of your fear, you&#39;ve allowed yourself to take your eyes off of your children and put them on others. you should never let other people define your children (or yourself). we are each so unique.  comparing one to another is unhealthy and truly damages relationships. not everyone learns at the same pace nor in the same style. yes we can be similar in some areas but not in all. we are individuals, one of a kinds. if you allow the fear, it will overcome you.  define your child by who they are and you achieve that by discovering that along beside them.  <br/>

That has been my experience.  Kirby was promoted one step at work,  <br/>
having decided not to apply for the step above that.  He wanted to  <br/>
make sure he wasn&#39;t a manager who wasn&#39;t sure of  himself, so he has  <br/>

yes we all have a process and through it we compare yet it isn&#39;t (always) healthy. fear so easily creeps in. i agree there should be balance in everything we do. in a time of confusion and uncertainity comparing can be our enemy. balance is the key. use caution so you don&#39;t allow someone else to define you. there are alot of people who have an &quot;opinion&quot; that you cant afford.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t agree more. I don&#39;t care if my son Pat never reads a word of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528585150">It&#39;s been my experience, too. Now is what matters. Then the next now, <br/>
then the next.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Bronnie is 22 and just graduating from university. She <br/>
had a conventional schooling, but in her early years before she <br/>
started school and we were seldom out of each other&#39;s company - <br/>
virtually never in the first two years - all we did was whatever made <br/>
us happy. Sometimes we were busy, sometimes we were cruising along <br/>
nicely, sometimes we did nothing. Whenever we were home alone, I used <br/>
to say to her, &quot;Well, it&#39;s just you and me and nobody else, so I <br/>
guess we can do what we like!&quot; That&#39;s exactly the same with my son <br/>
Pat. Except he&#39;s almost a teenager not a &#39;preschooler&#39;. All we do is <br/>
whatever makes us happy. And that doesn&#39;t even mean doing things <br/>
together any more. At the moment, he&#39;s heavily into World of Warcraft <br/>
and plays for hours while I do other things and we just have an <br/>
occasional conversation. I know he&#39;s happy because his body language <br/>
shouts it out and, as I write, he&#39;s sitting across the room from me <br/>
humming a little tune to himself. That&#39;s priceless. I wouldn&#39;t swap <br/>
it for anything.<br/>
<br/>
I know maybe I make a big deal sometimes about the fact that I have a <br/>
conventionally educated academically successful daughter as well as <br/>
an, in effect, &#39;radically unschooled&#39; son (though I call it &#39;self-<br/>
educated under my supervision&#39;), but the point I would make here is <br/>
that the success my daughter has achieved on *her* chosen path is <br/>
without a doubt in my mind *founded* on those early years of her life <br/>
when she did whatever made her happy without any expectation that she <br/>
should meet some external or abstract standard of development or <br/>
achievement. Thus, I have every reason to believe that my son is also <br/>
becoming a &#39;successful adult&#39; in his own way.<br/>
<br/>
Research I&#39;ve read about recently, at Harvard and other places, backs <br/>
me up. It&#39;s been determined by people who allegedly know about these <br/>
things that being successful doesn&#39;t make us happy, as most people <br/>
seem to believe - it&#39;s happiness that makes us successful.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, &quot;go with the flow&quot; is not just an idle platitude. <br/>
It&#39;s what works. Taking one day at a time and making that day a <br/>
success in itself (however you choose to define &#39;success&#39;) is what <br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
My son is very good at that, as it happens. Occasionally, I&#39;ll have <br/>
my own moment of doubt and ask him if he&#39;s thought about what he&#39;d <br/>
like to be when he grows up, and he&#39;ll answer something like, &quot;Bob, <br/>
I&#39;m only interested in what I&#39;m doing now.&quot; And I&#39;ll say something <br/>
like, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s cool&quot; and get on with my life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a grand adventure alright. :)<br/>
