 </span></blockquote>I was born in 1967 to a knocked out Mom.   I have an alchoholic father.  I&#39;ve <br/>
never liked to drink in excess.  Only been &quot;drunk&quot;  2 or 3 times in my life, <br/>
those times were before I was 25.    I may have a cocktail occasionally, but <br/>
only one, because alchohol makes my face hot.   I hate the taste of beer, never <br/>
drank a whole one.   One of my sisters was kind of wild in college, but never <br/>
became an alcoholic.  My other sister&#39;s involvement with alcohol is just like <br/>
mine - minimal.    <br/>
<br/>
I must say though, I DO have an addictive personality.   I over eat.   I get <br/>
fixated on projects or hobbies and let everything else go.    I have had other <br/>
addictions that I really do not want to go into detail about.   Actually, <br/>
addictive behavior to &quot;things&quot; that are not physiologically addictive... hmmm, it <br/>
is sort of a contradiction of the term &quot;addictive&quot;.    But, I do know, even <br/>
if the addiction is purely psychological, it IS real.   It causes physical <br/>
symptoms and seems and can be painful on many levels for everyone involved.    I <br/>
think my dad is more physologically addicted to alcohol than physically.  I <br/>
think I inherited the &quot;addictive personality&quot; from my father.    <br/>
