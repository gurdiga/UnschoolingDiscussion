You have apparently not read enough economics to have understood the concepts <br/>
of public goods and positive/negative externalities and some of the causes <br/>
and solutions to market failure. Neither have most of the other people here, <br/>
so it is difficult for them to counter even some of the most simplistic <br/>
arguments, without the ability to draw upon and articulate those somewhat <br/>
more complex concepts. It doesn&#39;t make you right, it just makes it <br/>
frustrating and annoying to watch the process.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a good place to argue economics -  people  are not here because <br/>
they are interested in that. If I thought they were, I&#39;d jump in and provide <br/>
plenty of arguments, based on sound economic reasoning, for why it DOES make <br/>
sense, in a mixed economy, such as that of the United States, for some of our <br/>
tax dollars to be used for educating other people&#39;s children and for a number <br/>
of other purposes.<br/>
<br/>
However, like I said, people did not COME to this list to argue economics, <br/>
not even the economics of public school financing. A really good place for <br/>
that kind of argument, if you want to do it with other homeschoolers, is the <br/>
NHEN-Legislative yahoogroups list. <br/>
<br/>
Please EVERYONE ELSE WHO IS NOT INTERESTED --- the way list topics get <br/>
perpetuated is by people responding to them - you vote with your own posts &lt;G&gt;<br/>
. If you want these kinds of threads to die a natural death, stop responding <br/>
to them, no matter how difficult that may be. Those who ARE interested and <br/>
want to continue - please make the subject line clear so that the rest of us <br/>
can delete the messages more easily. Thank you.<br/>
