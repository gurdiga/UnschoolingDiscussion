<div id="ygrps-yiv-307453570">You supposed that my child had attended some kind of swimming class <br/>
or instruction - this has never been the case.  Each year we have <br/>
spent time in the water with her and her friends until she has re-<br/>
attained a level of confidence and ability where WE feel confident in <br/>
leaving her in the water whilst we watch from dry areas.  She has <br/>
never been to &quot;school&quot; in any of its conventional forms.  When my <br/>
daughter has learned something she is extremely proud to show it off <br/>
and tells everybody.  She would never be quiet about it because she <br/>
was worried what would be forced down her throat next! That concept <br/>
would be entirely alien to her.  (Though I accept that this was the <br/>
case with my own schooling and, all in all, with a forces family <br/>
always travelling, I attended about 15 different schools!)</div>

Why was this addressed to me by name?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t suppose anything about anyone.  I was just talking about the <br/>
principles involved.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about swimming lessons and kids, not about me or you.<br/>

AH!! I see you just joined the list 4/23.<br/>
It&#39;s too soon for you to be posting, and I think this illustrates part of the <br/>
reason for that policy.<br/>
<br/>
People need to try to keep to the topic as much as possible and not make <br/>
things personal.<br/>
