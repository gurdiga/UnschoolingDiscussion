Do you think they might be learning something a little possibly <br/>
negative from that?  I mean, if they know know you don&#39;t like the show <br/>
and they know you are watching it because the &quot;boys&quot; tell you to, are <br/>
they maybe picking up a subtle gender lesson that you may not want <br/>
them to?<br/>
<br/>
Wyndham used to want me to watch certain things with him.  I explained <br/>
that I didn&#39;t like that show and that I don&#39;t make him go to the <br/>
fabric store with me or do any of the things I do for fun that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like, so wouldn&#39;t it be fair if he extended me the same <br/>
courtesy?  Now, he doesn&#39;t ask me to watch Pokemon but does ask if I <br/>
WANT to watch Scooby with him.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I&#39;m just curious about your situatiion, maybe it isn&#39;t what <br/>
I took you to mean?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791872">Had to think about this for a minute. But to answer your question, nah, I don&#39;t think their learning anything negative. They enjoy watching the show. I don&#39;t really mind it too much. And they don&#39;t really &quot;tell&quot; me to watch. If I were not watching it, I would be on the computer, or doing dishes, reading a book, in other words, doing something by myself. At night when these shows are on, it is somewhat customary for us in our family to &quot;gather round the tv&quot;. Kind of like family tv time. I know for a fact DH appreciates me sitting next to him, sharing a few laughs or a few &quot;eeewwws&quot; after he has been away all day at work. Or if I&#39;m not sitting next to him, my youngest son is laying on me or next to me or having some physical contact with me. If I were not there watching, they would come to me at every commercial or after the show and tell me exactly what happened and all the details. They would be dissapointed that I hadn&#39;t shared in their excitement.<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t really any shows or programming that we don&#39;t see together. DH does not even like sports, in fact he hates watching it. Just another bonus for me! The kids don&#39;t really get into sports watching either. Though, when the Diamondbacks won the world series last year, we were faithfully watching for a while! As far as the kids shows, sometimes I do watch with them, sometimes not. If I&#39;m in the room while Spongebob Squarepants is on, I&#39;ll admit to laughing if I&#39;m following the story. That&#39;s a pretty funny show! I also like Doug, Hey Arnold!, Rugrats (occasionally), Wild Thornberries, Arthur, Zoom, and probably a few others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82143482">Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s funny that Frank ALWAYS paints something artsy, muralish on the  wall?  I like Laurie the best I think.  My 9yo d likes Vern.  We just watched him turn two little boys room into soccer heaven.  I want to know who dishes out the $1000.00 budget for each house?  The show or the home owners?  If it&#39;s the owners then they should have more of a say.  Don&#39;t you think?  Rebecca<br/>

and watch hours of it, just waiting to see what the<br/>
designers are going to think of next.  <br/>

My favorite horror was the fuschia spray painted<br/>
couch.  Yuck!<br/>

My daughter, 5, likes the home improvement shows on<br/>
the weekends and Animal Planet on the weekends.<br/>

&gt;  My girls and I both agree that each house should<br/>
&gt; have its own carpenter. Poor Ty and Amy.  It is kind<br/>
&gt; of funny that I know them by name, like they are<br/>
&gt; personal friends or something. As far as &#39;Trading<br/>
&gt; Spaces&quot; with a neighbor: we could not do it anyway<br/>
&gt; because we are renting this house.  Not sure the<br/>
&gt; owners would appreciate some of those wild designs. <br/>

&gt; Your girls are begging you to DO a Trading Spaces<br/>
&gt; show? Boy, I don&#39;t know that I would allow those so<br/>
&gt; called &quot;designers&quot; into my house to do what they<br/>
&gt; will. The neighbors usually have no say-so into what<br/>
&gt; really ends up happening. I will admit, sometimes<br/>
&gt; the make-over is really good and a real improvement.<br/>
&gt;  But other times, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?? Just saw<br/>
&gt; an episode on Sunday where they put real straw-hay<br/>
&gt; on the living room wall with a pink ceiling. Kind of<br/>
&gt; a joke IMO. How could anyone really live like that?<br/>
&gt; Even Page Davis had trouble with that one! Though<br/>
&gt; that &quot;Tye&quot; guy really has some huge demands put on<br/>
&gt; him sometimes (and is kinda cute!) It&#39;s fun to<br/>
&gt; watch.<br/>

&gt; I must jump in here and say my girls are &quot;addicted&quot; <br/>
&gt; to  TLC in the middle of the day.  Wedding story,<br/>
&gt; Dating story, especially Baby story and most of all<br/>
&gt; Trading Spaces.  They are begging me to &quot;Trade<br/>
&gt; Spaces&quot; with one of our neighbors. Too funny!! We<br/>
&gt; just have too much fun during the day don&#39;t you<br/>
&gt; think?!  <br/>
