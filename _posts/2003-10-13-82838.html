<div id="ygrps-yiv-434766409">On the ocarina subject again,<br/>
<br/>
thought I&#39;d share with you guys.   I found a site that has alot of tunes written out for the ocarinas.  Including the Zelda tunes.   <br/>
<br/>
I also found one here that can be painted on.  My 6 yr dd wants that one.    If you want to hear what some of theirs sound like,  it offers that too.<br/>
