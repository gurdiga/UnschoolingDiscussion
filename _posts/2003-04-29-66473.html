&lt;&lt; I didn&#39;t push or keep offering.  The panic was MINE alone.  She looked at <br/>
it <br/>
 shrugged, that was the end of it, EXCEPT for my panic that maybe it was the <br/>
 WRONG stuff. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But Glena, you offered something that when she REJECTED you felt the need to <br/>
give her the &quot;you&#39;re going to HAVE to have this some day&quot; lecture.<br/>
That is what you told us.<br/>
That is not the best way to foster a love of anything.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve told you over and over where you&#39;re still thinking schoolishly, but <br/>
you&#39;re refusing to see it.<br/>
You still think she needs to have X, Y, Z for her life. That isn&#39;t true.<br/>
You still think that there is an &quot;end result&quot; that we&#39;re all after, whether <br/>
it&#39;s using school or a &quot;better method&quot; (such as unschooling) but actually <br/>
there is NO end result in my world.<br/>
I am on a journey with some incredible human beings. I get to be a really <br/>
important part of their journey, especially right now. But their whole lives <br/>
are a big adventure and where on earth would the &quot;end result&quot; be measured.<br/>
At 18 when they are legal adults?<br/>
Upon marriage or having their own children, should they choose that route?<br/>
When they die?<br/>
Just when is it that a person &quot;turns out&quot;? I am not unschooling for some end <br/>
result.<br/>
I am unschooling because I believe each and every day should be lived for the <br/>
moment and in pursuit of passions, interests and living joyfully.<br/>
End results are schoolish thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690583098">***Isn&#39;t in the end the result/goal the same?  Happy productive citizens?<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
No.   Schools want productive citizens.  Unschoolers have joyful kids,<br/>
right now, this minute.  <br/>
<br/>
***but the goal is learning isn&#39;t it?***<br/>
<br/>
  What if the goal is the best *today* your child can have?     <br/>
<br/>
***It&#39;s about FOSTERING a LOVE of math. ***<br/>
<br/>
Why is it your job to foster a love of math in someone else?    Why do<br/>
you think she&#39;s not capable of fostering for herself what ever love she<br/>
discovers?<br/>
<br/>
*** I want her to have a love of all things <br/>
learning, ***<br/>
<br/>
You want?   You think this is something someone else has to give her?   <br/>
You think this is something someone else CAN give her?<br/>
<br/>
***No matter if it&#39;s poetry or algebra, art or geometry I want her to be<br/>
able to <br/>
embrace each part ***<br/>
<br/>
YOU WANT!   Stop, stop, stop with the &quot;I want&quot; and live with what your<br/>
daughter wants.   How can you even begin to see what she wants through<br/>
this frantic desperation?  <br/>
<br/>
The advice to think about things is good advice.    Your daughter is<br/>
young.   There is no crystal ball can tell you what she will need in five<br/>
years or ten years.   SHE will know what she needs when she needs it.  <br/>
You guessing for her is no different than the school guessing for her.   <br/>
<br/>
Glena, we get that you care about your daughter.    <br/>
You need to calm down and have some tea.   You need to ask your daughter<br/>
what she&#39;d like to do tomorrow and NOT ponder where it will take her or<br/>
how you can get her to do more of it.    You will never understand <br/>
natural learning if you insist on planning her learning.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296081574">I think one of the realities, not goals, of unschoolers is that by <br/>
living in the present rather than considering the present merely a <br/>
preface to the future which really counts, is that if something were to <br/>
happen to our children before they turn 18, they still would have lived. <br/>
We wouldn&#39;t have to be caught up in the woulda, coulda, shoulda and <br/>
guilt of only having prepared for a future which never will be.<br/>
