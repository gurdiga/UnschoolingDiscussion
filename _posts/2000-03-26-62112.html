<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145264153">I agree with so many of the views you expressed in your last post. I also<br/>
believe that TV has tons of dribble and the system of commercials promotes<br/>
rampant consumerism. BUT, here we are, living in this society. I&#39;d rather<br/>
make sure my kids have the skills they need to view things critically, so<br/>
that when I&#39;m not around they know how to see what&#39;s true and what&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
 I didn&#39;t have a tv myself for many years and didn&#39;t miss it a bit. Now I<br/>
watch quite a few shows and I&#39;m happy about that too. TV is just a tool and<br/>
you can use it to great advantage. I have seen my kids use tv as a<br/>
&quot;socializing, community-building and knowledge and resource gathering tool.&quot;<br/>
The values that you disagree with are all around us, not just on television.<br/>
I&#39;ve found that being able to talk with my kids about these messages is the<br/>
best way of combating them. Without meaning to be condescending, I have to<br/>
say that it is different when you have one four year old than when you have<br/>
more and/or older kids. When I had one four year old, we hardly ever watched<br/>
tv either. But someday (too soon!) you will not be around her all the time<br/>
and you will not be able to censor what she takes in.<br/>
<br/>
 I think it&#39;s a bit different if you don&#39;t own a tv or if you have a tv and<br/>
try to impose limitations on your kids. I see that you are open to having tv<br/>
in the future - and open-mindedness is something we&#39;re all shooting for.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping I made some kind of sense,<br/>
