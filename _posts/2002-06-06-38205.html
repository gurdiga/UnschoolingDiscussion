<br/>
I&#39;m with you, definitely. I&#39;m 67 and have only contempt for such arrogance<br/>
and selfishness. <br/>
<br/>
He seems to want to &quot;celebrate&quot; himself, not his family, and especially not<br/>
the children. The planning is rude. I feel sure that you are not the only<br/>
one who is offended... what? -- your kids are not good enough to enjoy a<br/>
meal with your fatherinlaw&#39;s friends? Someone should convince (perhaps his<br/>
wife) him to include the children. If that cannot be done, and you must<br/>
attend, then in order to spare the children the indignity of being used and<br/>
snubbed, leave them home, give them a special activity that they would like<br/>
(with supervision as required) and go to the party and come home the same<br/>
night. Don&#39;t stay for the night.<br/>
<br/>
Barring that, I also like your idea of joining your kids for the evening<br/>
instead of staying at the adult-only affair. It is sure to be a bore.<br/>
