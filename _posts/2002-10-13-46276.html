I thought we were debating the bible from a Christian perspective.  I was <br/>
thinking of the New Testament... God coming in the form of Jesus.<br/>
Even according to the Old Testament (or the Torah) he *did* appear to Moses and <br/>
others, did he not?  Wouldn&#39;t he have to take on some form in order to do <br/>
that?<br/>
If he can appear to some, why not appear to all?  That would certainly convert <br/>
nonbelievers and settle religious disputes, would it not?  I&#39;m not really <br/>
looking for an answer.  It just seems to me that if the Judeo-Christian God <br/>
existed he would pop in now and then and not just sit back and observe all our <br/>
bumbling confusion which at times leads to disastrous results.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200750332">The descriptions of G-d in the Torah are allegorical and always taken so by Jewish scholars.   I can&#39;t debate, and perhaps you have missed this, my apologies, from a non-Jewish point of view because I am Jewish,  thus, I haven&#39;t thoroughly studied creationism from the Chrstian world view.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think that G-d pops in more than once and awhile...but not necessarily the way you think.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017013317">There have been lots of posts during the last few days on the topic <br/>
of bible questions.  Here are two; the first deals with the existence <br/>
of God, and the second deals with the age of the earth.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If he can appear to some, why not appear to all?  That would <br/>
&gt;certainly convert nonbelievers and settle religious disputes, would <br/>
&gt;it not?...It just seems to me that if the Judeo-Christian God <br/>
&gt;existed he would pop in now and then and not just sit back and <br/>
&gt;observe all our bumbling confusion which at times leads to <br/>
&gt;disastrous results.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;If there is such evidence for a young earth, why wouldn&#39;t the <br/>
&gt;scientists at least try to compromise in their thinking some to <br/>
&gt;maybe come to a reasonable conclusion...It would be nice, whether <br/>
&gt;people believe in the bible or not, that we could come to at least a <br/>
&gt;conclusion about our earth itself...instead of having two totally <br/>
&gt;different scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While some posters are supporting a certain position, others are <br/>
looking for answers. One poster, for example, mentioned that her son <br/>
is asking about the origins of the human race.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to research questions like this.  I will point to books <br/>
or web sites so you can read other opinions on various topics and <br/>
pass them on to your kids.  Is anyone interested in more information <br/>
on questions like this?<br/>
  1. Does God exist?<br/>
  2. Can creation be studied from a scientific viewpoint?<br/>
  3. How old is the earth?<br/>
  4. How does evolution explain these major areas:  origin of the <br/>
universe, origin of life, evolution of species, evolution within <br/>
species?<br/>
  5. What is the meaning of life?  Well, that one needs a whole new <br/>
Yahoo group, right? <br/>
<br/>
If you post here, I will answer here (hopefully we will stick to the <br/>
topic of unschooling).  If you e-mail me, I will research and answer <br/>
you privately by e-mail.<br/>
