This was my thought.  They can&#39;t deny the child access to food, has a counter <br/>
suit been filed?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081262193">I certainly don&#39;t know laws, but I would think that accountability lies with<br/>
the teacher who started this whole thing by not allowing a child to eat.  I<br/>
can&#39;t believe that can be legal, I would think, after having worked in<br/>
public schools, & know how important &quot;due process&quot; is that refusing to allow<br/>
a child to eat is correct.<br/>
