<div id="ygrps-yiv-208690467">I can understand that it would be easy and natural to love an adopted <br/>
child. However, I am not sure my 7 yo  boy would agree (unless we adopted <br/>
another 7yo boy who liked everything he liked!) Then again, I guess that <br/>
would be no different than if he had a sibling by birth with all the <br/>
rivalry that goes on there. Beyond that, my concerns are related to the <br/>
attitude of adoption authorities to homeschooling; is it a plus or minus in <br/>
their eyes? How does one find a compatible agency? My age is a factor here <br/>
too, since I am almost too old for an infant adoption (almost 41) unless I <br/>
go to an international adoption (which is not necessarily a problem). Then <br/>
there is the cost! I wonder how many children still wait for a home because <br/>
the cost of adoption is fairly high.<br/>
Well, I&#39;m just thinking out loud here. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your response!<br/>

&gt;My eldest son was adopted.  I didnt home school him.  I hadnt heard<br/>
&gt;of h/s then. He was 6months old when came to into my life.  I loved<br/>
&gt;him from the first time i set eyes on him.  I gave birth to 4<br/>
&gt;children after Tommy.  I love them all equaly.<br/>
&gt;Once you adopt a child.  That child is yours just as if you had given<br/>
&gt;birth - so I cant see h/s being any different to h/s your own child.<br/>
&gt;Sorry...I am presuming the laws are the same in USA.<br/>

Hi Olivia. Age and marital status (and coming up with the adoption fee) is<br/>
much more important to adoption agencies and and powers that be than<br/>
homeschooling. You&#39;re right that you&#39;d probably have an easier time with an<br/>
international adoption. It&#39;s really the current laws that keep children in<br/>
perpetual foster care that keeps them unadopted, rather than the cost. And<br/>
gone are the days when there were so many healthy newborn babies<br/>
relinquished that the doctors and agencies would call a-parents and beg them<br/>
to take another. Now it&#39;s difficult to get a healthy newborn, especially if<br/>
you want him/her to resemble you.<br/>
<br/>
Around here there&#39;s always some free seminars and meetings about<br/>
international adoptions (along with follow up support groups) My neighbor<br/>
adopted a 6 mo old from India, now a very handsome 10 year old. They still<br/>
get together with other families who adopted from India every year for a<br/>
cultural exchange and catching up.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I don&#39;t sound too hopeless about domestic adoptions. In general, you<br/>
can adopt, but the wait might be too much. Also, there&#39;s still the<br/>
possiblity that the birthparents could change their mind about relinquishing<br/>
after you have the baby home...international adoptions are less &quot;chancy&quot;<br/>
that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-456076324">Hi Valerie:<br/>
<br/>
I am not discouraged; I think your post was very honest and realistic. I am <br/>
not so firm about having an infant. Actually, given our age and the age of <br/>
my son, I think bringing a slightly older child (toddler age) into our home <br/>
may be a better fit. (The one thing I would miss in not having an infant <br/>
would be the chance to nurse and carry a child again.) But you are right <br/>
about the red tape involved in domestic adoptions. It angers me that <br/>
children wait for a loving home because of legal limitations. I think I <br/>
will try to attend a seminar on international adoption. I need to find out <br/>
the exact cost and the length of the wait.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-110881155">Hi Julie:<br/>
<br/>
I was poking around on the Internet again last night and I came across one <br/>
agency&#39;s fee for an adoption from China: it was over $10,000, with the <br/>
travel fees and all. How can one put a monetary value on a life? We can <br/>
afford the daily care of another child, but the up-front cost is so high. <br/>
Maybe I&#39;ve been reading and thinking too much about simplifying our life, <br/>
but I hate how the pursuit of money rules our society! (I&#39;m stomping on <br/>
that box I&#39;m standing on now because I&#39;m mad... I hope this thing isn&#39;t <br/>
made of cheap cardboard or I&#39;ll be falling through it! LOL)<br/>

The images you are sending are just too funny : ) I thought the cost might be <br/>
that high.  What a shame, that leaves tons of good parents out of the loop.  <br/>
I mean really, who can just reach in their pocket and pull out $10,000 .<br/>
