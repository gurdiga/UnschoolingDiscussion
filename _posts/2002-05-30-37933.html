parents find support for living/working/dealing with issues of kids who have <br/>
a certain set of traits. <br/>
<br/>
But - I&#39;m wondering -- how does knowing that this set of traits is called ADD <br/>
help you to know WHY a kid is doing the things he does. We don&#39;t know what <br/>
causes ADD, do we? Clinically? So it doesn&#39;t really provide any explanation <br/>
of why, does it?  It seems like circular reasoning. The diagnosis is MADE <br/>
based on the existence of a large number of a certain set of personality <br/>
traits and then the diagnosis is used to explain why the person has those <br/>
traits?<br/>

<br/>
The preliminary diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
The final diagnosis is dependent on the person&#39;s response to ritalin (or <br/>
other stimulants).<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Magnusson, my doctor for a long time and an unusually honest doctor, in <br/>
my experience,  says that if ritalin doesn&#39;t help the person, then the <br/>
preliminary diagnosis is withdrawn.   She says the difference betwen &quot;ADD&quot; <br/>
and &quot;ADD-like symptoms&quot; is the effect of the drug.<br/>
<br/>
That is quite a pharmaceutical carts-before-horses moment.<br/>
