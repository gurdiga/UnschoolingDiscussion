<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045020055">Hi, LOL. I am the one who wrote, she reached out to me and said, &quot;we <br/>
need to support each other because we are homeschooling&quot;. Besides <br/>
telling her that I can&#39;t sign a statement of faith and I won&#39;t <br/>
belong to the group, I also told her that I grew up in a crappy home <br/>
and my role models my entire school life were my homosexual PE <br/>
teachers and they encouraged us girls in sports and kept me out of <br/>
trouble so I have nothing against homosexuals. As a Catholic <br/>
homeschooler she still opened her heart to me. There is a lot more <br/>
to, &quot;we homeschooled and we became friends&quot;. Did I sign a statement <br/>
of faith that I believed something I didn&#39;t? NO. I couldn&#39;t hang <br/>
with that group. Did she reach out and make the connection because I <br/>
was a homeschooler? Yes. Did she have a bunch of girls like me? Yes <br/>
(I had one). Did she have an infant die days after it&#39;s birth? Yes. <br/>
(happened to me just a few years prior to meeting her so the <br/>
connection was a gift, that she would share her pain with me and <br/>
know mine was even a bigger gift). She was an incredibly gracious <br/>
person and I didn&#39;t need to believe everything she did nor did I <br/>
need to brain wash her into thinking my way. I was desperate for <br/>
some connection because I was homeschooling with no one else. When I <br/>
first started homeschooling 7 years ago I was just insecure about <br/>
all of it. Not anymore!! You all kept me connected too. Will I open <br/>
my heart to you because you homeschool? You betcha! Will I open it <br/>
so wide to be harmed/fooled/brainwashed? Nah! Sue</div>

they&#39;re also homeschoolers.  They don&#39;t owe us anything simply  <br/>
because we&#39;re homeschoolers.<br/>

(Substitute &quot;unschooler&quot; in there if you want, and the facts remain  <br/>
the same.)<br/>

group must have some homogeneity.<br/>
<br/>
Groups have suffered grief over what kinds of snacks to have, whether  <br/>
water pistols are okay, wether kids can play-fight, whether Harry  <br/>
Potters name can be uttered, whether people spank (or won&#39;t spank) or  <br/>
shame (or refuse to &quot;control&quot;) or whether kids can have a soda or  <br/>
whether kids have to wear shoes.  Before I was homeschooling but I  <br/>
was in a mother/toddler field trip co-op called &quot;Moms with Something  <br/>
Extra,&quot; there were tussles over all of the above, and people would  <br/>
leave, or choose their field trips based on who had organized them  <br/>
(and so presumably would be &quot;in control&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t respect the beliefs of people who spank their children and  <br/>
tell them they&#39;ll go to heaven while other kids burn for eternity,  <br/>
and they don&#39;t respect that I let my kids play video games, watch  <br/>
South Park and wear t-shirts with &quot;corporate&quot; art on them.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a group where people don&#39;t have those problems, cool.<br/>

If your philosophy is right, and you can simply accept ANY other  <br/>

<br/>
So you think the statement of faith groups should drop that  <br/>
requirement and just let anyone be in their group and not feel  <br/>
threatened by Harry Potter clubs or discussions of what was on the  <br/>
Simpsons?<br/>
<br/>
-=-To have the privilege of knowing those different from ourselves  <br/>

<br/>
Are you broadminded enough to be accepting of the statement of faith  <br/>
people?  Do you think mothers who spank know what is best for their  <br/>
particular families?  Do you think mothers who send children to bed  <br/>
without dinner because they didn&#39;t finish their  <br/>
&quot;schoolwork&quot; (assigned by mom in homeschooling, or by a teacher at  <br/>
school) knows what is best for her particular family?<br/>
<br/>
-=-.  I have learned from my  friends<br/>
that each mother seems to know what is best for her particular family  <br/>
and if<br/>
you respect the person as an individual you will not try to change  <br/>
them or let<br/>
them change you.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is disturbing to me, really.<br/>
Do you think mothers who drink themselves to unconsciousness a few  <br/>
times a week and leave the children with a wakeful stepfather or  <br/>
&quot;mom&#39;s boyfriend&quot; know what is best for their particular families?<br/>
I don&#39;t WANT to be that broadminded, personally.<br/>
<br/>
Do you draw the line at the self selected unschooling group for the  <br/>
statement about mothers knowing best?<br/>
<br/>
The same way a fundamentalist Christian group wants to protect their  <br/>
children from what they see as evil influences (which can be no more  <br/>
satanic than girls wearing shorts or boys with long hair), I want to  <br/>
protect my children from parents who are cruel to their children and  <br/>
swat them and make them sit in a hot car while other children are  <br/>
playing.  I didn&#39;t even want them to SEE that &quot;godly&quot; behavior when  <br/>
they were little, and so I couldn&#39;t begin to associate our family  <br/>
with those groups.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Respecting all people equally&quot; is the same as respecting nobody  <br/>
whatsoever.<br/>
Being &quot;completely nonjudgmental&quot; is the same as not knowing better  <br/>
from worse.<br/>
And I&#39;ve found many who coo about how wonderful it is to be  <br/>
nonjudgmental, and turns out they really hate judgmental people. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
So those who claim to accept everything are some of the first to get  <br/>
mad at me for saying &quot;Really?  Have you really thought about what  <br/>
you&#39;re saying?&quot;  They can&#39;t accept that!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your priority and identity are in being &quot;non judgmental&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;tolerant,&quot; that can be a big problem.<br/>
<br/>
If you make your priority peace for your children, then you will have  <br/>
to judge what adds more to peace, and what detracts from it.   You  <br/>
won&#39;t be able to tolerate dangerous or scary things.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness requires judgment.   Using good judgment isn&#39;t &quot;being  <br/>
judgmental.&quot;   Without judgment there can be no mindful thought.<br/>
Without choosing what to tolerate and what to reject, you can&#39;t make  <br/>
any choices at all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have read and reread a lot of books on mindfulness. I have attended<br/>
many talks on mindfulness. I have practiced mindfulness to the best of<br/>
my ability in structured and unstructured settings as well as in my<br/>
daily life. I have never read or heard this opinion about how<br/>
mindfulness functions. <br/>
<br/>
I understand minfulness as a state of mind that does not judge, just<br/>
is aware of what is in the present moment, be it my own judmental<br/>
thoughts or reactive feelings.<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned about being judgmental of others.  <br/>
<br/>
And I agree that I<br/>
need to use my judgment to make choices. But I would want my judgment<br/>
to come out of mindfulness - my awareness of my feelings and<br/>
reactions; and not the other way around as the quote seems to suggest. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Without judgment there can be no mindful thought.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would say that mindful thought comes out of awareness of ones<br/>
feelings and reactions and out of wisdom. Is wisdom judgment? I don&#39;t<br/>
see myself as particularly wise, but my hunch is that wisdom goes<br/>
beyond judgment to something deeper. Perhaps it&#39;s that part of us that<br/>
has compassion for others as well as ourselves and doesn&#39;t feel the<br/>
need to change or persuade others to see things our way.<br/>
<br/>
I can also use my mindful awareness of my reactive judgment to<br/>
question these initial reactions and feelings. Do I really need a<br/>
friend who agrees with everything I do and with all my views? Or can I<br/>
accept a friend whose religious beliefs are not accepting of some<br/>
aspects of my life (as long as they do not harm my children, my family<br/>
life, my self-acceptance)and remain her friend? Can I generate that<br/>
kind of non-resistance and patience and not-knowing (how things will<br/>
work out in the long run) and confidence? Or do I need to feel in<br/>
control and keep looking for friends that will make me feel safe? Safe<br/>
in the sense that my limits and comfort levels are not stretched or<br/>
questioned...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Without choosing what to tolerate and what to reject, you can&#39;t make  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I don&#39;t make choices on purpose. I purposefully try to stay<br/>
on that unsteady ground of not knowing, not making decisions. I have<br/>
noticed that my judgment of what to tolerate and what to reject<br/>
changes over time as my understanding of myself and others changes. I<br/>
am not so sure any more that I have all the answers or that there are<br/>
such things as final answers. So I pause and mindfully observe my<br/>
judgment and not act. And I wait.I suppose waiting is a choice, too.<br/>
So here I go again in spirals of paradoxes, lol. <br/>

<br/>
If all things are equal, you could&#39;ve shot up and gone to a bar  <br/>

<br/>
Feelings and reactions involve judgments, don&#39;t they?  Whether you  <br/>
are drawn toward something or repulsed doesn&#39;t even necessarily take  <br/>
conscious thought, but it&#39;s making choices throughout the day that  <br/>
gets you where you want to be concerning children&#39;s happiness,  <br/>
availability of food, etc.<br/>

<br/>
Some of the people who are least involved in trying to change the way  <br/>
others live are monks—Buddhist monks, or Christian monks.  But what  <br/>
do THEY do?  They move into walled compounds and let some other  <br/>
person tell them how to live.  So there&#39;s a core of hypocrisy in  <br/>
that, I think.  Once one is safely separated from the people they  <br/>
wish would change, it&#39;s easy to say &quot;Live and let live.&quot;  Once one is  <br/>
in an unschooling group full of La Leche League leaders, heck YES  <br/>
it&#39;s easy to say &quot;We all respect one another.&quot;   You&#39;ve already  <br/>
eliminated most of the rest of the world.<br/>
<br/>
The babysitting co-op I was in when Kirby was little had a minor  <br/>
blowup about one mom who didn&#39;t live the way she talked about  <br/>
living.  Her bathroom was full of visible, easily accessible  <br/>
cleansers and medications on low, open shelves (kind of surprising  <br/>
that anyone would keep them lower than sink level, or not in a  <br/>
cabinet) and she swatted her kids if they insisted she pay attention  <br/>
to them when she was talking to adults.  The swat came only after she  <br/>
would try ignoring them and gesturing them away.  One couldn&#39;t even  <br/>
get into that co-op without the approval of the La Leche League based  <br/>
membership.   Still...  we didn&#39;t all really respect everyone else&#39;s  <br/>
choices.  People were worried about leaving their kids at her house.   <br/>
&quot;Being nonjudgmental&quot; in that case would have been &quot;being a bad mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yet you didn&#39;t join the statement of faith group.  Somewhere in there  <br/>
you judged something.<br/>
<br/>
People will brag about good judgment and being non-judgmental without  <br/>
seeing any conflict. &lt;g&gt;  Probably because a lot of the talking and  <br/>
writing people do is done in phrases they lift and rearrange.   <br/>
Thinking as clearly as possible about word choices changed a lot of  <br/>
things for me in my life.  I could live with a dialog made up of  <br/>
phrases people have used on me, but I chose, consciously and  <br/>
meaningfully and intentionally, not to parent Kirby with the voices  <br/>
of my mom and grandmothers, and everything else in my life was  <br/>
affected by that choice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202903765"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of the people who are least involved in trying to change the way  <br/>
&gt; others live are monksBuddhist monks, or Christian monks.  But what  <br/>
&gt; do THEY do?  They move into walled compounds and let some other  <br/>
&gt; person tell them how to live.  So there&#39;s a core of hypocrisy in  <br/>
&gt; that, I think.  Once one is safely separated from the people they  <br/>
&gt; wish would change, it&#39;s easy to say &quot;Live and let live.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not so. My husband was a buddhist monk in a secluded jungle monastery<br/>
in Thailand. He was there in order to examine and change his life not<br/>
to change others. There is no hypocrisy in that, just a personal<br/>
decision to follow a certain path with faith and awareness. This path<br/>
consisted of other people telling him how to live while he was there.<br/>
Not how to live in the sense of what life is all about, but in the<br/>
sense of what tools and methods were used in this monastery and for<br/>
what purposes. There was no wish that other people would change. And<br/>
there was also no safe separation. The community of monks still<br/>
afforded plenty of interaction of variety of characters. Daily visits<br/>
from villagers and daily walks to beg for food offered other<br/>
interactions. And as anyone who has ever been on an extended retreat<br/>
knows, separation from other people and the usual activities of life,<br/>
are not &quot;safe&quot;. They actually put you face to face with yourself. It<br/>
is not about &quot;letting live&quot;, it is about honesty, courage to truly see<br/>
what&#39;s going on, patience and faith that you can handle it and really<br/>
to see yourself instead of hiding behind other people and activites.<br/>
No hypocrisy in this at all.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Yet you didn&#39;t join the statement of faith group.  Somewhere in there  <br/>
&gt; you judged something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh I never said I don&#39;t judge. I said I am concerned about judging<br/>
others and that I attempt to question my feelings, reactions, and<br/>
judgments.<br/>
I was never invited to &quot;join the statement of faith group.&quot; I think<br/>
you might have me mixed up with another person here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; People will brag about good judgment and being non-judgmental without  <br/>
&gt; seeing any conflict. &lt;g&gt;  Probably because a lot of the talking and  <br/>
&gt; writing people do is done in phrases they lift and rearrange.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree. As I said, I prefer mindful awareness of my feelings and<br/>
reactions and judgments together with careful questioning of these to<br/>
judging habitually and reactively. I never said that I am<br/>
non-judgmental. I am more realistic about myself than that :)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thinking as clearly as possible about word choices changed a lot of  <br/>
&gt; things for me in my life.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>May be examining the words minfulness, good judgment, non-judgmental,<br/>
tolerance, respect would be helpful here. As someone here mentioned,<br/>
the term &quot;being tolerated&quot; does not feel as good as &quot;being respected.&quot;<br/>
I think that I was using these as if they were the same thing. I can<br/>
see now that there is a difference.<br/>

in cities, and people come for sit-in&#39;s or learning of some kind.<br/>
Monks are usually interacting with all sorts of people. Even the very<br/>
secluded monks in &quot;winter, spring, summer, fall&quot; (fabulous movie)<br/>
shared their herbal knowledge with visitors.<br/>
<br/>
There is a place called &quot;Great Tree Zen Temple&quot; up here in the<br/>

at some time in the future and people in the building were blithely  <br/>
going on about their business, the compassionate thing would be to  <br/>
try to get them to understand and get out of the building. Would it  <br/>

your friend was trying to do. She doesn&#39;t just believe you will go to  <br/>
hell, she knows it, and she was trying to get you out of the  <br/>
collapsing building.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s other psychology at work for many people though. It&#39;s hard  <br/>
growing in the understanding of a belief surrounded by people who are  <br/>
certain a different belief is right.<br/>
<br/>
(New unschoolers living in School-At-Homer (D&#39;Oh!) Land understand  <br/>
that!)<br/>
<br/>
It can result it angry and fearful behavior as people try to hold  <br/>
tight to what they&#39;re certain is right, and keep other ideas out that  <br/>
might confuse. It&#39;s like building a fortress in hostile territory. It  <br/>
also accounts for the anger and fear school-at-schoolers sometimes  <br/>

I&#39;m wrong and I&#39;m torturing myself (and my children) and making all  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve tried not to make big definite statements to my kids about  <br/>
&quot;never&quot; and &quot;always,&quot; in part because of all that.  I didn&#39;t badmouth  <br/>
school when they were little, except to answer their questions, and I  <br/>
always tried to say &quot;Some kids like [whatever it was] and some kids  <br/>
don&#39;t,&quot; and some kids find lots of friends at school, but others  <br/>
don&#39;t.  Like that.<br/>
<br/>
Around me, though, were parents making all kinds of dire predictions  <br/>
and threats about how vital school was and that homeschoolers would  <br/>
never get a job, or that homeschooling was the only way and school  <br/>
was out to destroy children so the kids HAD to do the &#39;schoolwork&#39;  <br/>
the parents were assigning, or else they&#39;d have to go back to school,  <br/>
or that the kids HAD to do the reading lessons the parents were  <br/>
assigning, or they would turn out like Holly Dodd, unable to read at  <br/>
the age of ten.<br/>
<br/>
In those cases, tensions were high, and the tensions were created by  <br/>
the parents making such narrow and absolute (and ultimately  <br/>
threatening) statements.<br/>
<br/>
Had they balanced a little more lightly in their stance so that  <br/>
motion one way or the other hadn&#39;t toppled them (or more literally,  <br/>
made them look like liars or indecisive parents), they could have  <br/>
more easily accepted it when Holly read so well so quickly once she  <br/>
did read.<br/>
<br/>
It took conscious thought for me to make my children my priority.  It  <br/>
would have been simple, from examples all around me in real life,  <br/>
media, political chit-chat, for me to focus on career, or money, or  <br/>
house-as-investment, any of which would have made the kids small  <br/>
parts of MY life, heirs in the wings who needed to be persuaded not  <br/>
to mar my investment property, not to need me during business hours,  <br/>
and ALL those things that are commonly accepted by some-to-many others.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really help that others are using my kids as good examples or  <br/>
bad examples, but I can continue to examine my own statements and  <br/>
messages to them and try to make sure I&#39;m not using other people&#39;s  <br/>
kids as good or bad examples, but rather helping them see the range  <br/>
of life with its upsides and downsides.   It&#39;s not as easy as it  <br/>
might seem, and for me it does take conscious decision-making  <br/>
thought.  Sometimes I get into a flow and don&#39;t consciously think for  <br/>
a while, but it&#39;s moments or hours, not days.<br/>
