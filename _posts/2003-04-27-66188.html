&lt;&lt; &quot;Behaving As If The God In All Life Mattered&quot;, by MacHaelle Small Wright<br/>
 I found it on Amazon. IT is a little &quot;out there&quot; for some folks,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I&#39;ll check into it. I hear about how &quot;out there&quot; I am from my co-workers all <br/>
the time...so I guess another strangeness won&#39;t much matter.<br/>
At Unity there is a lot of talk about everything being part of the whole, the <br/>
God in all of us and so on...so maybe it won&#39;t be too &quot;out there&quot; for me? I <br/>
like hearing about new ideas either way.<br/>

And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The author talks about her own childhood, and the traumas she faced. Then she <br/>
talks about her spiritual awakening and awareness of the spirituality of all <br/>
life on earth. Not my usual stuff, but it really spoke to me. I have a thing <br/>
going on with my horse, and with dogs in general. I think from the sounds of <br/>
it you may like it. It is not so well written, but is interesting.<br/>
