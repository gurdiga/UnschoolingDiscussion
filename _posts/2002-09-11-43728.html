<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812328856">we did that alot in high school. you just mix the kool aid and water without <br/>
the sugar and pour it on your hair. the lighter you hair the better the color <br/>
will be.my hair has always been dark red and i used purple to tint it and it <br/>
worked great, my friend was a blond and died hers every color in the rainbow. <br/>
it will wash out but as b4 the lighter your hair the longer it will take <br/>
because you will have more color.<br/>

out once it&#39;s in. Especially red.<br/>

you&#39;re still on dialup. We&#39;ve used Special Effects, from www.goodgoth.com<br/>
or www.amphigory.com.  Rain has done blue, green, and pink, but I don&#39;t<br/>
remember the exact shades.<br/>
<br/>
I did my hair black for a few years (it&#39;s naturally somewhere between<br/>
dark blonde and light brown). It looked cool, very Irish, but upkeep was<br/>
a hassle.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have dyed my oldest son&#39;s hair twice in the past year.  At the end of<br/>
december I braided his hair into many braids, bleached and dyed the ends<br/>
red, blue, green and purple.  A few weeks ago, I bleached all of his hair<br/>
and dyed it all fire engine red.  I used some dye that is available here in<br/>
Canada.  I have recently heard of a place to get dye that will last better,<br/>
it might be fudge.<br/>
If your daughter has dark hair you will have to bleach it first or the<br/>
colours just don&#39;t show up much.<br/>
I have used koolaid to dye yarn with lots of success.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225420214">I have done it! It only really works on very blond hair. Make a paste<br/>
with a little water and leave it on as long as you can stand it. It<br/>
fades away slowly but can work well. Hope that helps, Jane :-)<br/>
 <br/>
P.S. When my boys were little they thought Kool-Aid was hair dye and<br/>
were shocked to see a person mixing it up and feeding it to their kids.<br/>
LOL <br/>

is very dark brown so I do lighten it first in order to acheive the <br/>
bright purple or pink that I&#39;m after. Most crazy colours are like that <br/>
unfortunately.<br/>
Yesterday I dyed my hair blue-black. Haven&#39;t decided if I like it yet. <br/>
I&#39;m pale anyway and I&#39;m wondering if it makes me look ill but then, <br/>
who cares :-)<br/>
