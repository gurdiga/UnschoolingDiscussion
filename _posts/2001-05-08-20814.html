<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791071328">Hi Everyone,<br/>
We are headed off to the porch to snuggle up and read more of Pippi<br/>
Longstocking. (is she a true unschooler or what?  LOL)  The kids are<br/>
loving it!!<br/>
We also just recently read Owls in The Family following someone&#39;s on<br/>
this lists recommendation.  They loved it too.<br/>
So, what books has everyone been reading, reading out loud ect....  My<br/>
kids are aged 4-8, but age doesn&#39;t matter.  I always like to hear what<br/>
everyone is reading and enjoying.<br/>
Oh yeah, we also just read The Lion Witch and Wardrobe.  I was a little<br/>
uncertain as the younger ones are very sensitive, and scare very easily,<br/>
but they enjoyed it too.<br/>
Thanks for sharing....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478123842">You&#39;ve been busy bees!  Sounds like fun!<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the age difference doesn&#39;t matter.  They<br/>
get different things from the material, but they all<br/>
benefit from the practice of being read to.  I<br/>
remember reading &#39;Wind and the Willow&#39; to my son when<br/>
he was five, and I *knew* he didn&#39;t understand most of<br/>
what he was hearing, but he wanted me to read it.  I<br/>
asked him why, and he said &#39;The words sound so pretty<br/>
when you are reading them, I just like to listen to<br/>
them&#39;.  Well!  So he soaked up the rhythm and flow and<br/>
musicality of good writing... certainly nothing to be<br/>
sneezed at there!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are doing a wonderful job of enriching<br/>
your children&#39;s lives...<br/>

How I miss those times.  Snuggled in bed reading to my dd (and my dd -<br/>
