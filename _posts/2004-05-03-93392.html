Self-doubt, I think, is probably an inevitable part of the unschooling <br/>

Ya think?<br/>

To me it&#39;s become more about the LACK of doubt----in myself and my children, <br/>
certainly. <br/>
<br/>
Doubt in *others* &lt;g&gt;, most definitely!<br/>

I&#39;ve found more conviction and self-reflection and inspiration in the <br/>
unschooling process. Little to no self-doubt.<br/>
