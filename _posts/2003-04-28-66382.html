&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whoa did I miss something?  Is this going to be the LAST  SC conference?  <br/>
&gt; We weren&#39;t planning on attending this year because Brogan is still pretty <br/>
&gt; young (3) but I was planning on going in the next year or so.  Is it really <br/>
&gt; the last one?  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I wasn&#39;t planning to have one THIS year, but I felt that I really needed to <br/>
&quot;finish&quot; last year&#39;s conference---Sandra was my Keynote Speaker but fell and <br/>
broke her leg on the way to her Keynote Speech Friday afternoon. No one got <br/>
to hear her except for brief visits in her hospital room (and she was <br/>
morphined out of many of those!). I feel I owe Sandra and all the attendees <br/>
for last year.<br/>
<br/>
A conference is EXTREMELY labor intensive. And I have no one to help. It&#39;s <br/>
just &quot;me&quot;. The hours it kept me from my husband and children last year were <br/>
---- countless!  I won&#39;t say it won&#39;t ever happen again, &#39;cause it MIGHT. But <br/>
it&#39;s not in the plans. I hope to be moving to NC next year; I&#39;d like to put <br/>
my time towards building our house and planning the farm. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d truly recommend coming THIS year. If it happens again in the future, you <br/>
can say you&#39;ve already been! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think GWS is doing theirs anymore. Are they? I think we&#39;re *it* <br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see you in August!<br/>

delighted to have been able to be in the same room with someone who has had <br/>
such a profound and wonderful effect on my life and my son&#39;s life, in <br/>
addition to having an incredible effect on, I believe, the Unschooling <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027296254">I&#39;ve been reading along for a while and thought I would pipe up and <br/>
ask who besides Sandra will I get to meet in Columbia in August. <br/>
I&#39;ll be helping Kelly with the raffle and whatever she finds for me <br/>
to do. Needless to say, I am tickled as hell! I wish I had known <br/>
about this conference last year. <br/>
<br/>
My son, Pete and I will coming from NC. It will be a huge event for <br/>
us, because even though I&#39;ve unschooled him from birth, I still find <br/>
myself offering him a text or workbook to pull some explanations out <br/>
of when I can&#39;t answer his math questions. He hasn&#39;t wanted to write <br/>
and I was hoping for some enlightenment there soon. He does worry <br/>
that he&#39;s stupid because he doesn&#39;t do public school work but really <br/>
I see him making great progress with very little formal learning. <br/>
The teen years are looming though and I need reasurance about our <br/>
direction. <br/>
<br/>
We do quite a bit of community service and volunteering. Our biggest <br/>
issue is the lack of like-minded folks; we do live in the sticks <br/>
amongst the conservative. I have just joined a new statewide online <br/>
group called HOME ALLIANCE of North Carolina or HA-NC. I&#39;m thinking <br/>
one person here in this group is also in NC. We are throwing around <br/>
ideas on a conference for NC next spring.<br/>
<br/>
I very much enjoy the directness here. My take on the dialog is <br/>
this: if you&#39;re not willing to accept what people say or if you <br/>
won&#39;t express what you think as you do in real life....you are being <br/>
false in your intent on any online group. In real life, I can be <br/>
much too direct and like making decisions quickly. Sometimes that <br/>
backfires because I also am NOT a deep thinker, and at times all but <br/>
the plainest language goes over my head. So I try to be careful <br/>
online; facial expression, body language, and tone aren&#39;t here for <br/>
us to use...I think that brings on misunderstanding and argument. <br/>
It&#39;s also easy to not complete a thought on a busy day and be <br/>
misunderstood about THAT. So I read more and speak less. Sara</div>

Hi, Sara --<br/>
<br/>
What you described is okay.  There are no forbidden resources.  It&#39;s<br/>
just forbidden, in unschooling, to shackle the child TO the resource and<br/>
make him use it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**He hasn&#39;t wanted to write <br/>
and I was hoping for some enlightenment there soon.**<br/>
<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t write at all.  I mean he can&#39;t even form all of the<br/>
letters of the alphabet without hints.  I think his fine motor skills<br/>
are just &quot;late&quot; compared to school standards.  This is scary for me, but<br/>
he hates being &quot;noodged&quot;, so I know it would be counterproductive.  (As<br/>
well as immoral, un-unschooling-y, and probably fattening &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

frustrated very quickly.  I have gotten rid of handwriting books.  I <br/>
make gentle offers to write things.  Occasionally, he will write or <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shannon, There were a few people who came to the conference solo last <br/>
year.  Obviously, it&#39;s best if the whole family can go, but if you can at <br/>
all manage to do it, you should come, even if it means just you and the <br/>
baby being there.  You will get sooooo much out of it that the benefits far <br/>
outweigh the bummerness of leaving your son and husband home.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I say this is that most of us do not live in unschooling <br/>
communities, and it can be really tough to do something that is as fringe <br/>
as unschooling when you&#39;re the only one in your area doing it.  Okay, well, <br/>
it may not be tough to *do* it, but it can be tough to deal with the doubts <br/>
and concerns and all that when you are feeling like an oddball.  But at the <br/>
conference, you are in a community and you are not on the fringe!  You&#39;ll <br/>
be able to bring that sense of community home with you and it will benefit <br/>
you long after the conference has ended.  You&#39;ll have a sense of <br/>
comradeship that you didn&#39;t have before, and you&#39;ll be able to see living, <br/>
breathing, functioning unschooling families comprised of younger children <br/>
and older children, treating each other with respect and joy.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
how it is where you live, but that kind of thing is pretty rare in my neck <br/>
of the woods.  Being in the midst of so many unschoolers really helped me <br/>
to feel a kinship with people whom I had never even met, and helped me see <br/>
what this whole thing can really look like.  It helped me believe in myself!<br/>
<br/>
And, no, Kelly Lovejoy is not paying me!<br/>
<br/>
Since you have the support of your husband, I hope you will <br/>
reconsider.  It&#39;ll be the best $$ you could have spent on (Invested in) <br/>
your unschooling lifestyle!<br/>

  Hi all, I&#39;m going to SC conference this year. I had someone who was <br/>

  rooms have two large beds, queen I think. Would anyone be interested <br/>

  comfortably but we both snore some...allergies! We will be staying <br/>

  staying Friday through Sunday. Email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cheeps4u@...">cheeps4u@...</a>  Sara<br/>

<br/>
It may not be the &quot;point&quot; of the conference---the family &quot;thang&quot; is big---but <br/>
there are a lot of &quot;just moms&quot; coming. It&#39;s wonderful to connect with others <br/>
from this list and put names to faces. To get meet virtual friends IRL.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned before that the reason I put it together in the first place <br/>
was totally selfish---I just wanted to meet all these guys! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll reconsider! I&#39;d like to meet YOU too!<br/>
