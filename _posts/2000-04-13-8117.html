my daughters are 10 and 7 and we have had a similar experience...  i think <br/>
yours is a great question.  i think at an earlier age my 10yo had a better <br/>
handle on it but as she has become exposed more and more to other <br/>
school-at-home homeschoolers she sees the contrast...  she would be more <br/>
comfortable to complain to them (along with them) &quot;i have to do such and <br/>
such&quot;  or &quot;my mom makes me do ____&quot; etc.  --shared complaining seems to be <br/>
part of building the friendship!  since she doesnt have much to go on that <br/>
route, it moves to the chore requirements, junkfood rules, computer <br/>
restrictions, etc.  i&#39;m not saying this is a big part of the relationship, <br/>
just that the kids are learning about other households by sharing their <br/>
stories, and of course at this age, out-doing the last story is part of the <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
to try to answer your question, you may first realize that it is your problem <br/>
and share it with her that way.  (if you really are uncomfortable w/her <br/>
current answer.)  like how you mentioned to her that people dont always <br/>
understand, so how bout we use this answer when people ask (if you can find a <br/>
suitable answer.)  for eg., i have a friend who had named their school so <br/>
that when people at the grocery store asked what school they went to they <br/>
would just say, &quot;oak tree academy&quot; or whatever and the conversation would <br/>
end.  rather than saying &quot;oh, we homeschool&quot; and be willing to go where that <br/>
takes you.<br/>
<br/>
it is a personal thing!  i would rather (most days) invite the homeschooling <br/>
conversation, but i definitely could see that there is sometimes reason NOT <br/>
to invite it.<br/>
<br/>
i would tend to want to follow up on a comment like &quot;i dont see how it works, <br/>
either&quot; from my daughter!  just because it would make me feel better to <br/>
convince her that she does really know that she is learning and progressing <br/>
beautifully!  i would want her to have that confidence.  but maybe this isnt <br/>
what she meant.  i can understand this bugging you, though.  did you just let <br/>
it lie when she said that?<br/>
