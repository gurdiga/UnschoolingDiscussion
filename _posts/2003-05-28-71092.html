<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144134587">Arrived back from the UK yesterday having had a wonderful time at Hesfes despite it beinga bit chilly at night and a bit rainy on the last days. Luckily my tent doesn&#39;t leak and lots of alcohol kept me<br/>
warm ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The talks were good. Went to one by Roland Meighn, UK&#39;s leading expert on education (Leeds University I think). He does not have a high opinion of exams and degrees at all, presenting research that all<br/>
exams are subjective and affect self-esteem. He also outlinied the effect that the schools type of education has on kids, the &#39;You will do it MY way and then we will test to make sure you learned what<br/>
we deemd you should&#39; model.<br/>
<br/>
Kids put on a grand parade at the end of Hesfes. Our lot (Gloucs HE group) made a dragon. Unfortunately, the Gloucs HE group had all headed for the pub to get out of the rain, failed to notice when it<br/>
stopped and assumed that everything startes late at Hesfes anyway.....so we arrive back and find the parade already finished. Ho hum. So our kids did a solo parade. Nowt like 6 kids under a dragon<br/>
costume, especially when the tail end threw a tantrum cos the head end was walking too fast. The tail stomped off and had to be placated before the draogon could continue ;-)<br/>
The bands were excellent. All ages welcome (Hesfes is nnon-agiest which is a refreshing change from HS groups in Virginia). We also did a &#39;Curry and Queen&#39; night. Lots of home made curries and lots of<br/>
Queen on the CD player.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait for Hesfes necxt year. It was wonderful to be among so many autonomous home-educators, the majority of whom have respect for their kids and follow non-coercive parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Best unpack I spose. DH says we canmove back to the UK as soon as he finds a job so maybe I&#39;ll be back in time for Hesfes 2 in the Autumn :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t wait for Hesfes necxt year. It was wonderful to be among so many <br/>
autonomous home-educators, the majority of whom have respect for their kids and <br/>
follow non-coercive parenting. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re back!<br/>
<br/>
While you were gone I spoke with my friend in London, of the family I visited <br/>
in East Yorkshire.  They&#39;ve decided two things which matter here.  They&#39;re <br/>
staying in England, and she&#39;s planning to homeschool her son who&#39;s three (or <br/>
possibly four, Holly would know but she&#39;s asleep).  <br/>
<br/>
They homeschooled their oldest a bit when she was little, but the kid <br/>
preferred school.  Under their circumstances then, I understand why!  She was living <br/>
really new the flagship hippie school of the district, which had been open <br/>
classroom, which hosted the first &quot;family schools,&quot; which is the place <br/>
alternative teachers want to be.  So it wasn&#39;t a fair representative sample of public <br/>
school. &lt;g&gt;   When they moved to England she wanted to try the local schools and <br/>
has really loved it, as a challenge, as an experience nobody back home will <br/>
have had, and it&#39;s always helped that she didn&#39;t HAVE to go, but I&#39;ll tell you, <br/>
she loves the uniforms, she lives the lunches, she loves the exotic games the <br/>
kids play and the little traditions that are foreign to Americans.  And she&#39;s <br/>
been admitted into some more special midschool (whatever their terms for <br/>
just-past-elementary) in London she had to test into so she&#39;s in school-experience <br/>
heaven and likes the friends she&#39;s made there.<br/>
<br/>
There are two other children, though, who have no American experience, for <br/>
whom it will  NOT be exotic and spa-like to go to the nearest school.  One was <br/>
born in January.  One moved there as an infant.<br/>
<br/>
I told her about Hesfes before it was over, so she might even have gone out <br/>
to check it out.  We have done MUCH weird camping together.  She&#39;s definitely <br/>
equipped and able to do that.<br/>
