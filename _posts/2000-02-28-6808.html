&gt;The following is taken from a Nepalese Good Luck Mantra. You&#39;ll find it to be worth reading and worth sharing. Do NOT keep this message. The mantra must leave your hands within 96 hours. You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is true, even if you are not superstitious. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIFE <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;1. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully. <br/>
&gt;2. Memorize your favorite poem. <br/>
&gt;3. Don&#39;t believe all you hear, spend all you have, or loaf all you want. <br/>
&gt;4. When you say &quot;I love you,&quot; mean it. <br/>
&gt;5. When you say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; look the person in the eye. <br/>
&gt;6. Be engaged at least six months before you get married. <br/>
&gt;7. Believe in love at first sight. <br/>
&gt;8. Never laugh at anyone&#39;s dreams. People who don&#39;t have dreams don&#39;t have much. <br/>
&gt;9. Love deeply and passionately. You may get hurt, but it&#39;s the only way to live life completely. <br/>
&gt;10. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling. <br/>
&gt;11. Don&#39;t judge people by their relatives, or by the life they were born into. <br/>
&gt;12. Teach yourself to speak slowly but think quickly. <br/>
&gt;13. When someone asks you a question you don&#39;t want to answer, smile and ask, Why do you want to know?&quot; <br/>
&gt;14. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk. <br/>
&gt;15. Call your mother. <br/>
&gt;16. Say, &quot;bless you&quot; when you hear someone sneeze. <br/>
&gt;17. When you lose, don&#39;t lose the lesson. <br/>
&gt;18. Follow the three Rs &quot;Respect for self, Respect for others, and Responsibility for all your actions.&quot; <br/>
&gt;19. Don&#39;t let a little dispute injure a great friendship. <br/>
&gt;20. When you realize you make a mistake, take immediate steps to <br/>
&gt;correct it. <br/>
&gt;21. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in <br/>
&gt;your voice. <br/>
&gt;23. Spend some time alone. <br/>
&gt;24. Open your arms to change, but don&#39;t let go of your values. <br/>
&gt;25. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer. <br/>
&gt;26. Read more books. Television is not a substitute. <br/>
&gt;27. Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older and think back, you&#39;ll be able to enjoy it a second time <br/>
&gt;28. Trust in God but lock your car. <br/>
&gt;29. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life. Do all you can to create a tranquil, harmonious home. <br/>
&gt;30. In disagreements with loved ones, deal with only the current <br/>
&gt;situation. Don&#39;t bring up the past. <br/>
&gt;31. Don&#39;t just listen to what someone is saying. Listen to why <br/>
&gt;they are saying it. <br/>
&gt;32. Share your knowledge. It&#39;s a way to achieve immortality. <br/>
&gt;33. Be gentle with the earth. <br/>
&gt;34. Pray or meditate. There&#39;s immeasurable power in it. <br/>
&gt;35. Never interrupt when you are being flattered. <br/>
&gt;36. Mind your own business. <br/>
&gt;37. Don&#39;t trust anyone who doesn&#39;t close his/her eyes when you kiss. <br/>
&gt;38. Once a year, go someplace you&#39;ve never been before. <br/>
&gt;39. If you make a lot of money, put it to use helping others <br/>
&gt;while you are living. It is wealth&#39;s greatest satisfaction. <br/>
&gt;40. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful <br/>
&gt;stroke of luck. <br/>
&gt;41. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly. <br/>
&gt;42. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other. <br/>
&gt;43. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it. <br/>
&gt;44. Live with the knowledge that your character is your destiny. <br/>
&gt;45. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;SEND THIS MANTRA E-MAIL TO AT LEAST 5 PEOPLE AND YOUR LIFE WILL IMPROVE. <br/>
&gt;0-4 People: Your life will improve slightly. <br/>
&gt;5-9 People: Your life will improve to your liking. <br/>
&gt;10-14 People: You will have at least 5 surprises in the next 3 <br/>
&gt;weeks. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
