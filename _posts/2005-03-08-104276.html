<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082952010">&lt;&lt;Letting kids decide to &quot;do nothing&quot; (though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;nothing&quot;)<br/>
isn&#39;t good unschooling. Providing more choices for them, and more input and<br/>
more opportunity is the duty of anyone who wants to say &quot;I&#39;m unschooling.&quot;<br/>
It truly does need to be a &quot;doing,&quot; an action, a life lived purposefully<br/>
and richly, not just a hiding-out from school. It SHOULD be so rich that<br/>
anyone who <br/>
hears stories is impressed and understands it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Back in the fall, my kids wanted to start doing more community service. I<br/>
found stories on the internet about kids doing wonderful things, and it<br/>
appealed to them.  They wanted to really DO something useful/helpful/etc. <br/>
So, together, we came up with monthly ideas and tried to figure out who&#39;d<br/>
do it with us. (And we also chose things that if no one joined us, we&#39;d be<br/>
ok with that). Initially, we plugged them into the 4H calendar for the year<br/>
(they were thrilled to have someone take the ball and run with it - and,<br/>
later I discovered that saying we&#39;re *with* 4H, opens a lot of doors for<br/>
donations around here...) <br/>
<br/>
After we planned out some stuff, we discovered a national group of<br/>
homeschoolers doing community services: HEARTS. And we started coordinating<br/>
our efforts with them - and even started our own little North Texas HEARTS<br/>
group.  (It&#39;s blended with the 4H-ers, but it&#39;s all kids interested in<br/>
community service.) <br/>
Here&#39;s the link to the HEARTS group - if you think you&#39;d like to get<br/>
involved with that: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.h-e-a-r-t-s.org">http://www.h-e-a-r-t-s.org</a>  <br/>
 <br/>
But the things my kids have done so far:<br/>
     September- Habitat for Humanity<br/>
     October - Teens Make a Difference Day<br/>
     November - Highway Cleanup & Hats for the Homeless<br/>
     December - Salvation Army handouts for Christmas (Toys for Tots, etc.)<br/>
    January - Soup Kitchen at the shelter on New Year&#39;s Eve<br/>
     February - Valentines for nursing home<br/>
     March - Project Linus (blanket making)<br/>
                   Rivers & Streams...trail maintenance<br/>
     April (anticipated) - Special Olympics<br/>
                    National Trash Off Day - highway cleanup<br/>
     May (anticipated) - Relay for Life...all-night team relay walk for<br/>
cancer awareness<br/>
 <br/>
My point in listing all this out is that *for us* this is how our kids are<br/>
involved in the community. Not just bystander or audience stuff...which<br/>
they do plenty of. But ACTIVE involvement. Kids want to make a difference -<br/>
adults do too (if they&#39;re not too tired &lt;g&gt;)  It&#39;s so rewarding when you<br/>
have some project and 17 kids of multiple ages show up simply because they<br/>
want to help. It&#39;s rewarding to me as a parent, and it&#39;s rewarding to the<br/>
kids to know that they CAN make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
So... less focus on schoolish subjects, more focus on the kids having the<br/>
same thing as what makes a full rich adult life. <br/>
 <br/>
Just something that&#39;s working for us....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629585710">Just wanted to mention one more thing about this, because I really think<br/>
it&#39;s a great starting place. This month&#39;s HEARTS project is to make<br/>
blankets for the needy through an organization called Project Linus. You<br/>
can easily find a contact in your community by going to their website: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.projectlinus.org/chapter.htm">http://www.projectlinus.org/chapter.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t even have to have sewing skills to make these blankets. The only<br/>
requirement is that they&#39;re handmade and that they&#39;re new. We&#39;ve made<br/>
crib-sized polarfleece blankets (about a yard of fabric) by simply sitting<br/>
on the couch, fringing and knotting the edges. Peaceful. Calm. And still<br/>
actively helping others.<br/>
<br/>
In case you&#39;re thinking of a way to get more involved.... :-)<br/>

<br/>
- Don&#39;t ban the video games/computer... involve yourself with them<br/>
- Engage the child in a conversation about what he&#39;d like to learn. <br/>
Then help him find it. <br/>
- Look for interesting options in your community<br/>
- Set up a movie marathon that might be interesting to both you and <br/>
your son<br/>
- Ask for help in the garden, or whatever your Spring hobby might be<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;i have a daughter who wants to do 4h but can&#39;t seem to get them <br/>
to work with us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A chronic problem in 4H is lack of 4H project leaders. Leaders are <br/>
just parents that want to take on a particular topic (usually their <br/>
child is interested in that particular one) and then opens it up to <br/>
others.  Here&#39;s what I&#39;d do to connect with 4H:<br/>
<br/>
- Ask to be on their mailing list...you&#39;ll get a monthly newsletter<br/>
- Ask when/where the local community clubs meet. (Community clubs <br/>
aren&#39;t centered around a particular project, but instead do a <br/>
variety of things together)<br/>
- Go to visit each of the clubs whose time/dates/locations work for <br/>
you.<br/>
- When you sign up (it&#39;s free), look at the list of projects <br/>
available. Many are specific to times of the year. A few are year <br/>
round. Your county newsletter should have a calendar in the <br/>
newsletter. Call and go over it with your Extension Agent. Just tell <br/>
them that you&#39;re trying to figure this all out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and have anouther son who wants to do charity work but can&#39;t seem <br/>
to find anything in our area. i live in illinois in jersey county. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You might have to set something up yourself. How old is your son? <br/>
What interests him?<br/>
If he likes dogs... offer to walk them at the Humane Society<br/>
If he likes books... offer to help shelve books at the library<br/>
If he likes to get outside... offer to help at the local nature <br/>
center<br/>
Go the HEARTS website and talk to others on their list about doing <br/>
more community service. Play around on the website and see what&#39;s <br/>
going on that might work for you:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327536663">I just wanted to point out that helping a neighbor in need is also a service<br/>
to the community.  Sometimes this gets overlooked, but it can be very<br/>
rewarding to help a neighbor and get to know them a little better. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I used to read stories of homeschoolers who were doing all these wonderful<br/>
volunteer things and I&#39;d kind of feel bad because as much as I wanted to do<br/>
something similar, nothing seemed to fit for us.  My kids don&#39;t enjoy<br/>
meeting lots of new people and we work best when we aren&#39;t on a schedule.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But helping a neighbor is very flexible and the kids didn&#39;t find it<br/>
stressful because they already knew the person.  The neighbor we help is a<br/>
single woman who owns a horse farm.  There is always work to be done and<br/>
she&#39;s always in need of some kind of help, no matter when we go there.  We<br/>
started helping her out over a year ago and although we didn&#39;t do it to get<br/>
something out of it, it worked out that when we decided to get a horse, she<br/>
was more than willing to barter our services for board for our horse because<br/>
she already knew we could do the work.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone is looking to do volunteer work but nothing is working out,<br/>
sometimes there is someone right in your neighborhood that could use the<br/>
help.  Maybe someone&#39;s house needs painting or their dog needs walking or<br/>
they could use some home cooked food now and then.  <br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
My stinkin&#39; husband. Not really, I do love him, and he can see things my  way <br/>
a lot.  :)  But sometimes...<br/>
 <br/>
We lived next to this really old couple, retired preacher who was always  <br/>
inviting us to church.  Sweet as anything.  The man slipped on ice and  hit his <br/>
head and eventually died.  His wife was bent over from osteoporosis  and could <br/>
still drive but I knew it was a strain to get her trash can up to  the top of <br/>
her long sloping driveway every week.  We hardly ever spoke with  her before <br/>
he died, but I took to knocking every once in a while during his  <br/>
hospitalization, which started January 1st, to see how they were doing.  I  spoke to her so <br/>
seldom that I didn&#39;t even know until way after Christmas that he  had passed <br/>
on my son&#39;s birthday in November.  <br/>
 <br/>
But I had begun, right after he fell, to take her trash can to the  curb for <br/>
her when I was taking mine, and then I would remind my husband or  my son to <br/>
take her&#39;s down when they were bringing ours in.  The first time  I did that my <br/>
husband was astonished that I would presume to do such a  thing!  He refused <br/>
to do it that first time, so I did it and then had a  week to argue with him <br/>
about why it should be done without even being asked by  her to do it.  <br/>
 <br/>
She didn&#39;t know for months that I was the one who had been doing it,  <br/>
although I think she assumed so.  She rarely spent time in the front of her  house so <br/>
she never saw me doing it.  But when we did chance to speak on  occasion, she <br/>
thanked me.  Will was too little to pull the full one up the  driveway, so he <br/>
became in charge of rolling it empty back down.  He  didn&#39;t need convincing.  <br/>
Occasionally Charles would do it if he thought  about it, but he was never <br/>
comfortable.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then we sold the house and moved away.  The people who bought the  house had <br/>
2 teenage sons and so I told them about the trash can and the  situation, and <br/>
I hope they did it for her, too, without being asked.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was such a simple, convenient good thing to do for someone else.   It <br/>
didn&#39;t take anything at all from my life, and it gave Will a sense of  thinking of <br/>
others, too.  It was very rewarding for both of us.  I&#39;m  still a little oh, <br/>
I dunno, peeved is too strong a word--but peeved at my  husband for not being <br/>
instantly willing to help someone in need with such a  small, small thing.  <br/>
