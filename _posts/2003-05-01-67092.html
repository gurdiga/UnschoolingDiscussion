We like The Black Stallion. It&#39;s quite different to the book but beautifully<br/>
filmed.<br/>
I thought the first Lord of the Rings movie was great but was disappointed<br/>
at the second which strayed way too much from the book for this fan!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Princess Bride, done by Rob Reiner<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something from a transcript of his commentary on the DVD version:<br/>
<br/>
I read this book when I was about 25 years old, The Princess Bride, &#39;cause I <br/>
had been a huge fan of William Goldman&#39;s. My father gave me the book because <br/>
Bill Goldman had given it to him. They had become friends when Bill Goldman <br/>
wrote a book about Broadway called The Season, which looked at a particular <br/>
season on Broadway and all the plays that had opened.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had a play that opened called Something Different. And Bill Goldman <br/>
devoted a chapter in his book to that play. And they became friends. And he <br/>
gave this to my dad, back I think when it first came out in the early &#39;70s, <br/>
and said, what do you think about making a movie out of this? And my dad <br/>
said, well, he wasn&#39;t really a, you know, he didn&#39;t really, hadn&#39;t read it. <br/>
But he gave me the book and said, you know, do you want to read it?<br/>
<br/>
I read it and at the time it was the favorite book of my life that I&#39;d ever <br/>
read at that point and probably to this point. And so then, years later, when <br/>
I was thinking about making movies, I went back and reread it, and it again <br/>
spoke like to me. It was like as if Bill, Bill Goldman had been in my head, <br/>
and had written something that was inside my head. So I went to him and met <br/>
with him and he said, this is, this is the favorite book I&#39;ve ever written in <br/>
my life. I want it on my tombstone. Uh, what are you gonna do with it? And I <br/>
was shaking in my boots thinking, you know, he was gonna, you know, really <br/>
criticize it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s Robin Wright, by the way, the most beautiful, you know, [laughs] <br/>
she&#39;s incredibly beautiful and we had to find the most beautiful girl in all <br/>
the land and I think we found it with her, who can, not only was beautiful, <br/>
but acted and did a wonderful British accent and was the perfect embodiment <br/>
of The Princess Bride.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, Bill Goldman was totally, you know, challenging me as to whether <br/>
or not I could pull this off. And when I told him that I basically wanted to <br/>
honor his book and be as faithful as possible, he agreed to let me do it. At <br/>
that time, I had only made Spinal Tap. That was the only picture I had made <br/>
and I actually had finished The Sure Thing, but it hadn&#39;t come out yet. And <br/>
he saw those two pictures and then he agreed to let me, to let me do it.<br/>
<br/>
So I got a chance to work with my favorite writer and he entrusted his, his <br/>
favorite book to me. And I was very grateful that he did that.</div>

TOO much like the book...almost chapter by chapter!  The only big difference <br/>
is that Stanley doesn&#39;t look at all like he is described in the book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841158530">I think I may be one of the very few folks who read Forrest Gump before it <br/>
was a movie.   The  reasons I think I am in the minority in that regard is <br/>
because I bought the book out of  $1.00 bargain bin, and I had never heard of <br/>
it before I read it.   That was the GREATEST book.   After I read it, I told <br/>
lots of folks about it, and no one ever said.. &quot;oh yeah, I read that book <br/>
too&quot;    A year or so after I read the book, I heard it was going to be made <br/>
into a movie.. I was shocked, because I thought it was such an &quot;unknown&quot; book <br/>
and author.   Of coure, the movie, Forrest Gump, was also great.  Although, <br/>
it was very different from the book.  Forrest Gump was one of the few movies <br/>
that was so different from the book that I still liked in it&#39;s own right.  FG <br/>
the movie was kind of like what Mary said about White Oleander.  It was <br/>
probably a lot better to folks who had not read the book because then you <br/>
didnt compare the movie to the book.     For folks who havent read the book.. <br/>
I HIGHLY recommend it.  Its so much &quot;more stuff&quot; than the movie.   <br/>

years ago and it was wonderful. Also I love the Pride and Prejudice with<br/>

perhaps I am off the topic.<br/>

He was so adorable in What a Girl Wants. <br/>

I have to rent Pride again.    <br/>

&gt; I liked Speilberg&#39;s job on Color Purple... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Casey and I just watched Tuck Everlasting and I thought they did a <br/>
really good job with it. Same for Holes. I was glad that Louis Sachar <br/>
wrote the screenplay. <br/>
<br/>
The only movie I&#39;ve ever liked better than the book was One Flew Over <br/>
The Cuckoo&#39;s Nest, and I&#39;m a big Ken Kesey fan. The movie just took <br/>
the story one step further and with awesome character development <br/>
IMHO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-373472018">OH! that reminds me :) I really liked *The World According to Garp*  It&#39;s<br/>
exactly as you explain FG, great book, great movie, but I&#39;ve never been sure<br/>
if I would call it a great adaptation..<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I *hated* that movie.  It seemed *so* anti-male.  We actually stayed<br/>
to the end, thinking it had to get better.  It didn&#39;t.  Different strokes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049099567">Oh, I loved Pride and Prejudice too! And speaking  of Colin Firth, what<br/>
about Bridget Jones&#39; Diary. I loved that. Don&#39;t know how it compared to<br/>
Helen Fieldings book, haven&#39;t read that yet.<br/>
