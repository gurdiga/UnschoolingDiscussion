human animal simply cannot stay still for any length of time.  We are <br/>
programmed to be actively doing SOMETHING.  That very drive leads us to find <br/>
solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  You&#39;re making progress!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, Linda, I am right there with you! Its so easy to forget what your own <br/>
dreams are when you spend so much time doing for every one else.The book <br/>
Simple Abundance is good for this stuff-it really inspired me. When I was <br/>
pregnant with Jenny I made a list of all these things I wanted to do while I <br/>
wasn&#39;t working as much, but I bet I haven&#39;t done any of them in 3 years. I <br/>
do remember that learning to play the piano was one of them, and I just got <br/>
one, so that is pretty likely to happen now! I think I will make another <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should both make one, and then we can support each other to stay <br/>
with it, and to take the time for ourselves to find our own passions.<br/>
