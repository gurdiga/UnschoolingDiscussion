  How did you come to this faulty conclusion?<br/>
<br/>
  ** Because throughout this discussion I haven&#39;t heard anyone here yet agree that parents have the right to make their own choices, which was my whole point to my original post. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Seems that if you think an adults right to hit a child is equal to a child&#39;s <br/>
  right to enjoy safety, you DON&#39;T have the level of respect for children that <br/>
  is being advocated here.<br/>
<br/>
  Let me go on......<br/>
  Your son has a vision problem that prevents him from owning a game boy?<br/>
  I have a hard time with that. Could you tell us specifically what the ailment <br/>
  or problem is that would make it impossible for him to EVER play a gameboy <br/>
  but make other video games alright?<br/>
<br/>
  ** Why? So more arguements can clog up the list? So more comments can be made about it not helping anyone with unschooling or that I must be lying? ::sigh:: I hate feeling this way. I don&#39;t have the medical name for it here, but when he was two, first one, and then both his eyes started pulling inward. The pediatric opthomologist said that the muscles on the outside of his eyes were not strong enough to keep his eyes centered. We did the glasses and alternating patches, and a lot of eye excercises for about 6 mths, but they kept getting worse, and he was almost cross-eyed. He had to have surgery to shorten the muscles at age 3. At his follow-up visits it was determined that one eye is weaker than the other and was not responding as well to the surgery, so more patches and glasses and exercises were needed. At this time, they gave me a list of things he should do and should not do. On that list of &quot;should not&#39;s&quot; were things like reading, playing with small toys exclusively, doing any kind of handwriting or paper or book work, and playing hand-held games like gameboys or etch-a-sketch or anything like that - because his strong eye would focus on things like that while his weak eye would not. Things like TV were ok if he sat far enough back because the screen was big enough to require both his eyes to function together. We followed all of this, and at his one-year followup visit, we got to get rid of the glasses and patches, and got the go-ahead for the reading and writing, but not for the hand-held games. Now, his eye is weakening again, and his eye visit should have been several months ago but is scheduled for Nov. 8th. I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s weakening because of all the reading he&#39;s been doing since he learned how to read about 9 mths ago, and I have no idea what we&#39;re going to do if they say he can&#39;t read as much. I&#39;m hoping that glasses will fix it, but we&#39;ve always known there was the possibility that more surgery may be necessary. And, yes, I went ahead and gave the long version so that it won&#39;t &quot;look like I&#39;m making it up as I go&quot; if anyone wants more details. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Was it simply one doctor&#39;s opinion that you are willing to live by?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ** It was his pediatrician&#39;s opinion and the pediatric opthomoligist&#39;s, plus I could easily see myself that the eye was weaker. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Or is <br/>
  this a real live problem that would truly damage him?<br/>
<br/>
  ** For sure. We&#39;re trying to avoid more surgery, and hopefully glasses. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with glasses, but I don&#39;t want him having to slow down or worry about them while playing if he doesn&#39;t have to. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Respect for a child in my book means problem solving ways to get them the <br/>
  items they need/want.<br/>
  When he was at the store, asking for a gameboy, or any other item, was the <br/>
  answer &quot;You really want that, don&#39;t you? Let&#39;s think of a way to make it <br/>
  work, because I don&#39;t have the money right now&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  ** Yes, that is basically how we do things. If the woman hadn&#39;t showed up, we probably would have ended up comparing the gameboy games that are available to the playstation games to see which ones we could get the same thing in, and perhaps making plans to check the flea market for one or adding it to his Christmas list or helping him call his Gramma and Nana to see if one of them wanted to get it for him or helping him call other relatives to see if they had jobs he could do to earn the money for it himself. <br/>

  Helping children have access to this world is respect. Not above mine <br/>
  (although with young children you damn well better be able to put your own <br/>
  needs on hold a lot of the time) but then, if I want something, I don&#39;t have <br/>
  to ask someone bigger than I for said item.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600718244">I couldn&#39;t find very much more than the diagnosis and treatment plan that he did online, but I did find some people who had children with the same problems. Some of them chose to not get the surgery done, and kept on with the glasses/patch/excercise regimen, and a few tried a chiropractor. Their children ended up with &quot;learning disabilities&quot; (diagnosed by schools of course) because they had a lot of trouble reading and seeing things on paper, then had to have the surgery by around age 9/10 anyway. I was hoping that by going ahead with it when he was so young, that he wouldn&#39;t remember it much. It worked from that perspective, all he remembers about it was that his eyes burned when he cried for a few days. <br/>
