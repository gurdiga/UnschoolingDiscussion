<div id="ygrps-yiv-2059168782">Hi Everyone,<br/>
     I haven&#39;t posted on here for quite a while but I was hoping someone <br/>
might have information on this.  We are unschooling our 5 kids, currently <br/>
living in California, and planning on moving.  We&#39;ve lived in Minnesota <br/>
before and had planned on moving back but lately we&#39;ve become very interested <br/>
in New Brunswick.  I am wondering whether anyone here might know what the <br/>
laws are about U.S. citizens buying homes in Canada and living in them as <br/>
their primary residence.  We would not need a work permit because we would <br/>
have enough from the sale of this home to buy a home there without a mortgage <br/>
and my husband has an income from his Air Force retirement.  <br/>
     Has anyone on here done anything like this or known anyone who did?  <br/>
Also, does anyone know what the homeschooling laws are in New Brunswick?  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
    Lucy</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506112941">Hi Lucy;<br/>
<br/>
Just letting you know your decision to move to New Brunswick would not<br/>
be a totally unique one.  You&#39;d probably find yourself in good company<br/>
with many of your compatriots about.  I&#39;m originally from Nova Scotia;<br/>
the neighbouring, right-next-door, Maritime province to New Brunswick<br/>
and I can tell you there are literally thousands of Americans buying<br/>
property along the pristine coastline and in the clean interior<br/>
towns/cities.  We had property along the Nova Scotia coast and our<br/>
neighbours all around seemed to be from across America.  There are TONS<br/>
of Hollywood celebrities who own property in the Maritimes as well<br/>
though I cannot tell you how much they are actually living there.  They<br/>
appreciate the change of scene, the calm, the obvious beauty of the<br/>
landscape, and the privacy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m relatively new to this whole internet scenario, but one government<br/>
of Canada site that might be helpful for you is:<br/>
<br/>
cicnet.ci.gc.ca/<br/>
<br/>
Hope it works and answers some of your questions!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; that maybe we could go as students and then take classes toward something<br/>
&gt; that they might accept for the occupation list.  Also, we could become fluent<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

province<br/>
in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; we could make it on my husband&#39;s retirement income.  It seems like it would<br/>
&gt; be better for us to keep the jobs free for others who need them, and we would<br/>
&gt; still contribute to the economy by buying things and paying taxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d think that would be great. No problem!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I wish<br/>
&gt; they had a category for people like us to immigrate.  The main things that<br/>
&gt; worry me about not being permanent residents are that at some point, our kids<br/>
&gt; might have to leave because they couldn&#39;t work there, which would be sad<br/>
&gt; because they would feel like it was their home, and also, the health<br/>
&gt; insurance issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really know nothing about this, but I know another person from Europe<br/>
who, once <br/>
here, wanted to stay.  If he were self-supporting, his status would have<br/>
changed<br/>
dramatically after a threshold of something like 4 to 5 years.  I am not<br/>
sure, <br/>
but he might even have been granted full citizenship after that.<br/>
<br/>

and still dream of again living by the sea.  Fredericton&#39;s lovely!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your quest!<br/>
