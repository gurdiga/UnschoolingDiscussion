<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why?<br/>
&gt; The label shouldn&#39;t matter so much as what you know about yourself in your <br/>
&gt; heart.<br/>
&gt; Why would calling oneself an unschooler be so important even if you aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; unschooling?<br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t change who you are, what your views are or anything about you to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; not be able to use a label.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

school at the moment.<br/>
