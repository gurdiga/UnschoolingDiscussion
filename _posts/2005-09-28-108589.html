<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851289930">I just wanted to chime in here.  When we decided to unschool our dtr, <br/>
we had already purchased her curriculum like Saxon and other <br/>
textbooks.  I auctioned them off on ebay and got a good price for all <br/>
of the stuff.  If your interested in getting some of your money back, <br/>
email me and I can share with you some ideas.<br/>
