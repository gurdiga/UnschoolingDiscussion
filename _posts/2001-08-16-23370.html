<div id="ygrps-yiv-807593894">In the 1970&#39;s they manufactured some women&#39;s urinals--they looked a lot like <br/>
toilets, but not a big round seat, more a trough.  You were supposed to use <br/>
them facing the wall, and not quite sit down, just squat over it.  <br/>
<br/>
They had them at the University of New Mexico in some of the classroom <br/>
buildlings.  They would be in a stall just like a toilet, and without any <br/>
diagrams or instructions, so except for word of mouth we wouldn&#39;t have known <br/>
what the heck they were, and people avoided using them, I guess (I did, <br/>
because I&#39;d never seen how it was supposed to go), and they were eventually <br/>
phased out.<br/>
<br/>
As to Indian men squatting on American toilets (and women too, I suppose <br/>
maybe), they (some of them/sometimes) squat to work on stuff too--instead of <br/>
sitting at tables to fix something, or sitting butt-down, they squat in a <br/>
position I can&#39;t keep anymore at all, and they are used to.  To sit around <br/>
and talk and smoke and eat in some traditional Indian houses, there&#39;s a <br/>
squat.  That&#39;s the position the mom was in when she was having the babies <br/>
poop between her feet.   It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t ever sit on the floor; the <br/>
do.  And they sit on chairs.  But they have another option we don&#39;t have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726949393">A neighbor growing up had spent so much time in POW camps during the Vietnam War, that when he spent anytime just standing around talking to you he would squat. He said he felt more comfortable in that position than standing, sitting whatever. At least that was his story.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>squatting is a wonderful position for birthing as well. the position really <br/>
opens up the pelvis in a way no other position can. i birthed my son in a <br/>
squat position with my sister and s.o. each in a headlock under my arms. :-)<br/>
<br/>
to prep for my homebirth i was supposed to practice squatting. i wish i would <br/>
have been squatting before pregnancy. i looked hilarious trying to balance <br/>
down into a squat at 6 mos.<br/>
<br/>
i now try to squat whenever i can, esp once a month when i get cramps. it <br/>
really helps.<br/>
