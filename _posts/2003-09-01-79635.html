If it had a hyphen in it (Unschooling-Discussion) it will bounce and the only <br/>
way to get it through is to cut and paste and mail to <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There are several things which were mailed to this list earlier this evening <br/>
which haven&#39;t come through.  I hope it will shake loose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing Yahoo is sludged up somehow. My website is a geocities site and <br/>
I&#39;ve had a hard time getting pages to open.  Sometimes they do, and sometimes <br/>
they don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531691106">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
The list is still here. The name has been changed -- remove the &quot;dash&quot; that used to be between Unschooling and Discussion so the list name is now <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussion@yahoogroups.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joyce and Sandra and I have sent a lovely thank you to Helen and hello to the list, as new owners, but it seems to have disappeared into the cyberfog for now.<br/>
<br/>
This is a big list - I&#39;m guessing that updating a name change takes a while longer for big lists like this.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody should change their favorite places/bookmarks, address books, and rules or filters and mailboxes/folders as necessary to reflect the new list name.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that -- carry on.......<br/>
<br/>
