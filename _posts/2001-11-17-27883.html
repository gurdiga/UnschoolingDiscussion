<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205499169">hi there,<br/>
<br/>
de-lurking for a bit to say that there are alot of<br/>
folks who have food<br/>
allergies/problems/reactions/addictions out there.<br/>
Some know or suspect their problems, and are working<br/>
on it. Some deny everything in themselves and others.<br/>
<br/>
The main way to deal with anything that&#39;s bothering<br/>
you is to be open to listening to your own experiences<br/>
with it, whether anyone else agrees with you or not.<br/>
By that I mean that if everytime you have milk you get<br/>
stuffed up, digestive pain, and asthma trouble, but if<br/>
you avoid milk you feel fine, then it is real and true<br/>
for you. It really doesn&#39;t matter what anyone else<br/>
swears is true, or if they think you&#39;re a weak minded<br/>
fool. The fact is for you it is true that you<br/>
personally will be better to avoid milk. <br/>
<br/>
I used to think that was hogwash until I actually<br/>
listened to my own body and got rid of dairy. Now I<br/>
can see so many others who suffer like I did, but also<br/>
deny the possibility because they&#39;ve been brainwashed<br/>
that dairy is the food of the gods or something.<br/>
They&#39;ll put tubes surgically in their infant&#39;s ears<br/>
(to stop the frequent ear infections that just<br/>
happened to start about the same time that the baby<br/>
went on milk),or have their own sinus scraped rather<br/>
than try giving up dairy.<br/>
<br/>
Wheat makes me feel drugged, yet it is the basis for<br/>
most of the American diet. I wonder how many others<br/>
feel like I do, but haven&#39;t isolated the cause.<br/>
They&#39;re so used to it they don&#39;t even see the<br/>
connection. If you mention it though, they think your<br/>
certifiable.<br/>
<br/>
If everytime I see my kids eat dairy they get sick, is<br/>
it child abuse to let them eat whatever they want to?<br/>
I think it is wise to help them learn the connection<br/>
between the chemicals they ingest, and the reactions<br/>
of their body.<br/>
<br/>
There is no food that is so sacred or important that<br/>
is is not possible that it causes a person trouble.<br/>
Wheat and dairy are the basics of the American diet.<br/>
If you have any doubt about that just try to avoid<br/>
them for a month, and see how you feel. If they are<br/>
not addictive, then why is it so hard to give them up?<br/>
I think the addiction to &quot;comfort foods&quot; (mood<br/>
altering foods) is one reason for the obesity<br/>
epidemic. Hard to get enough of the drug that is<br/>
killing you.<br/>
<br/>
Health is not about what foods are eaten by everybody<br/>
else, it is about how you treat your own body and<br/>
listen to how you feel, not to everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
So I must have missed what the point was about not<br/>
wanting to control what your kids eat. I do try to<br/>
control what my kids eat by only buying things for the<br/>
house that are good for them personally. No foods that<br/>
I&#39;d have to say no to. No junk, no &quot;treats&quot;, no candy.<br/>
Why have it in the house then complain that that&#39;s all<br/>
they want to eat? Demonstrate that we all can control<br/>
what we eat by only buying good stuff for ourselves.<br/>
If I take my health and theirs seriously they do too. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t control how much, when, or how, they eat. It&#39;s<br/>
all healthy stuff so I don&#39;t care when or what. I do<br/>
care where because it&#39;s easier to get the table clean<br/>
than the bed, and I care a little about how because I<br/>
want them to know about table manners in a general<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the parts of this post that are critical of<br/>
other&#39;s decisions, but if they made you mad then take<br/>
a look at the food that you hold sacred and ask<br/>
yourself if you can live without it. It your answer is<br/>
no than you are addicted, and it is possibly causing<br/>
you problems. Try to be scientific about it and test<br/>
the theory. Avoid it for a month or two then re-test.<br/>
Try it with your kids. Use it as another unschooling<br/>
&quot;lesson&quot; about body chemistry and food families.<br/>
<br/>
For people who object to my use of the word addiction,<br/>
can you truthfully call it anything else? Is<br/>
alcoholism just a habit? Is smoking only something the<br/>
smoker enjoys but feels no real physical cravings for?<br/>
Im talking about real addiction here to chemicals the<br/>
brain needs that it gets from certain foods. Chocolate<br/>
is a good example that honest folks can relate to,<br/>
very calming for many. Why is dairy (ice cream, pizza,<br/>
macaroni and cheese, buttered popcorn) such a favorite<br/>
food for so many? It affects the brain.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta run,<br/>
<br/>
let me know what you think, won&#39;t you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999808183">&lt;&lt;  If they are<br/>

<br/>
But you could say that about water and sleep and being with other people.<br/>
It would be hard for me to give up being with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is<br/>
alcoholism just a habit? Is smoking only something the<br/>
smoker enjoys but feels no real physical cravings for?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody at my house smokes.  I bought cheap bourbon yesterday to make a fruit <br/>
cake.  I had a margarita last month.  No addictions.<br/>
<br/>
Beans and tortillas are super-common here.  I don&#39;t think people are addicted <br/>
to them, I just think they&#39;re cheap and common local comfort foods.  <br/>
<br/>
All humans eat some kind of bread.  Have we been bread addicts for a <br/>
thousands of years?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe addiction is too strong a word to use for every single thing people <br/>
like and need.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Up to here, I agreed with you, and the addiction factor is certainly there <br/>
for a lot of people.  But another reason that it&#39;s hard to give them up is <br/>
that it&#39;s so hard to find anything to eat (especially away from home) that <br/>
doesn&#39;t have one or both in them.<br/>

because I&#39;ve done just that.  There was no difference in my health that I <br/>
could see.  (Actually I went off a lot more things than that, and I was <br/>
actually hoping that there *would* be a difference.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956722076">Hi Tia,<br/>
<br/>
I agree that wheat and dairy are very hard to avoid at first when <br/>
trying to eat out. I have good luck with plain salads (bring your own <br/>
dressing), plain baked potatoes (I really like ketchup on mine), and <br/>
tostadas. Asian and Indian foods are also often tasty and safe for me. <br/>
I was wondering how long you avoided wheat and dairy, and why you went <br/>
back. I understand how tiring it is to go against the norm. <br/>

other things for a couple of months.  I was looking for fibromyalgia <br/>
relief, which I didn&#39;t find on that path.  If I had noticed a difference in <br/>
the way I felt, I would have continued.  As it was, it wasn&#39;t worth it.<br/>
