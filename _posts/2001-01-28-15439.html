<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am concerned from a neurological perspective, he does have some neuro<br/>
&gt;problems as it is and I didn&#39;t want to add to that situation.  He does have<br/>
&gt;a great attention span, he plays very well by himself, and is highly<br/>
&gt;creative in his play.  I have no idea if things would have been different<br/>
&gt;with more electronic media exposure or not.  Sometimes I think we&#39;re the<br/>
&gt;only homeschoolers around who limit this, nice to know we&#39;re not alone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do limit these things as well. We don&#39;t watch TV (moved it to the<br/>
basement where hubby occasionally uses it to view sports), and don&#39;t own any<br/>
playstations or video games. My kids have their own computer and an<br/>
assortment of programs and I don&#39;t put any time limits on that, but we do<br/>
have a general rhythm to our day where the time is semi-limited anyways<br/>
because of other activities (we get up,  have breakfast, do chores, then<br/>
circle time, then we&#39;re usually out of the house until my daughter&#39;s nap<br/>
time, which is usually when my son and I do things he&#39;s wanted to do like<br/>
crafts or games, and then sometimes he uses the computer while I&#39;m getting<br/>
her down or up from her nap, then it&#39;s in to dinner time and daddy&#39;s home<br/>
and we do family stuff).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I truly believe in unschooling - that is, letting our kids<br/>
direct their own learning. But I also believe that I do need to set some<br/>
limits in our children&#39;s lives and in our home. We don&#39;t have a ton, but we<br/>
do have some. Chores need to be done, food eaten needs to be fairly balanced<br/>
and nutritious, and we don&#39;t play games (computer or otherwise) that involve<br/>
shooting guns, or taking of life (we&#39;re also vegetarian and pacifist). My<br/>
son was fairly appalled at the store today when we walked past a video game<br/>
called &quot;Deer Hunter&quot; complete with fake gun you could aim at Bambi and blast<br/>
away. We try to discuss our reasons for not spending a ton of money on<br/>
consumer goods as well - that each thing we buy has to be manufactured and<br/>
trucked and then disposed of when its no longer working. So in general we<br/>
don&#39;t buy much in the way of new toys/books/clothes, but try to find thrift<br/>
store stuff or make our own. We tend not to go into stores very often where<br/>
we will have to walk past big displays of mass-marketed goods and electronic<br/>
devices.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this will all get much more complicated as my kids get older<br/>
(They&#39;re 4.5 and 16 months now) and they have their own money, etc. At that<br/>
point, I hope that the values we&#39;ve discussed so far rub off. Between now<br/>
and then, we&#39;ll have to do a lot of thinking about what we do and do not<br/>
want to let into our household and lives, how much control we have or want<br/>
to exert over this with respect to our kids, etc. etc..<br/>

good to read your post<br/>
our days are much the same <br/>
dd Emily is 4 (10-18-96) and ds Ethan is 19 months (8-16-99)<br/>
we are always traveling the road of less consumerism and damage<br/>
it is sometimes very hard and i do wonder what will happen when they are<br/>
older<br/>
the pressures are already there and we try to avoid them but I know we<br/>
can&#39;t just continue this way<br/>
<br/>
in peace<br/>
