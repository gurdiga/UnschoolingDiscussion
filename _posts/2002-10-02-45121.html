<div id="ygrps-yiv-435963836"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My &#39;baby&#39; will be 2 in a couple of weeks and it&#39;s on my mind that although<br/>
&gt; she&#39;s &#39;only&#39; two, she&#39;s already two!!!! I can&#39;t imagine not having a little<br/>
&gt; one around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back when we lived in Montana, and my son&#39;s age was counted in weeks, there<br/>
was a woman at church who always sat in the back pew, and always wanted to<br/>
hold Tim.  Her own &quot;baby&quot; was 2 and she missed that cuddly baby age.  I<br/>
still wish I had a picture of it, because the woman was Andie MacDowell, and<br/>
her baby, Sarah Margaret, is now 8.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my little, tiny, brush with fame.<br/>
