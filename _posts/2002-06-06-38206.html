<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494860119"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Yes, I agree with many here who say Ritalin is overprescribed and that ADD<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t apply in an unschooling life. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am glad that we can agree on this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Again, to me those things were<br/>
&gt;irrelevant. WHat really bothered me was someone deliberately violated a<br/>
&gt;parent&#39;s wishes and decisions.<br/>

case before.  Suggesting it again does not make it true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want to let you all know that when I responded to the orginal post with<br/>
&gt;the concerns of children on ritalin going cold turkey, I was only coming from<br/>
&gt;this standpoint. Be it ritalin, or any prescribed medication meant for <br/>
&gt;children<br/>
&gt;on the standpoint of calming, anxiety or antidepressant etc...<br/>
&gt;The uncle that wrote the post, gave no clue  how the children stopped <br/>
&gt;medication<br/>
&gt;Except that he used the term cold turkey in<br/>
&gt;his post.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As has been explained by me and other people in other replies already, cold<br/>
turkey is not an issue with Ritalin and most other psychocactive<br/>
substances.  In fact there&#39;s only a very few that have any serious side<br/>
effects resultant from going cold-turkey off them.<br/>
<br/>
And even then, a lot of the &quot;cold-turkey&quot; side effects are no more<br/>
dangerous than the side effects of staying on the drug.<br/>
<br/>
Before you comment further about the dangers of cold-turkey recission of<br/>
ANY drug, I would strongly suggest that you read the complete list of the<br/>
side effects of Ritalin and the other chemicals the schools are pumping our<br/>
young boys full of, and then do an objective comparison of the &quot;on the<br/>
drug&quot; effects vs. the &quot;coming off the drug&quot; effects.  It might just open<br/>
your eyes.<br/>

I fully realize that there are some here who believe a passive session of<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We all have different posting styles, we just have to get used to it. &lt;bwg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This is the first time I have posted on this particular subject. Although I <br/>
think TV is good, that is another subject. I do agree with Marc when he talks <br/>
about giving children, who have energy for three, lots of opportunity for <br/>
expending it. When Jack was three, we were having a terrible time with him. <br/>
He was always goooing! (at the time, I didn&#39;t realize that this is just how <br/>
boys are.) At his regular check up I spoke to his doctor about this, and he <br/>
(without talking to or observing Jack for any length of time.) wrote a script <br/>
for Adderall 5mg 1 tab each morning and 1 at noon (for ADHD) and another <br/>
script for Clonidine 0.1mg 1 tab each evening before bed (an *adult <br/>
medication* that relaxes and dilates blood vessels resulting in lowered blood <br/>
pressure. Treating hypertension.) so Jack could relax and sleep! <br/>
<br/>
I loved Jack&#39;s doctor, his dad was my pediatrician, his brother is my regular <br/>
doctor and is married to my cousin. So before this and another incident six <br/>
months later involving a severe case of appendicitis misdiagnosed as a bad <br/>
case of the flu, I never questioned him! (resulting in Darin and I being <br/>
questioned at the hospital, in the middle of the night, about whether or not <br/>
we were child abusers! If we hadn&#39;t brought him in when we did, he would have <br/>
died in a few hours. AND he almost died on the OR table and twice in the next <br/>
two days. He stayed for 18 days and had to have another operation 5 days <br/>
later to remove 6 inches of bowel that became infected.) We kept Jack on <br/>
these meds for two months. During that time he became withdrawn, developed a <br/>
facial tic, constantly licked his lips and his hands shook. It broke my heart <br/>
to see my baby like this, but I trusted the doctor. <br/>
<br/>
Now I am not saying that there is no such thing as ADD/ADHD, but I do believe <br/>
that giving the child the freedom to learn while standing up and walking <br/>
around (whatever helps) is best. I also believe that activity was/is the <br/>
answer to all of Jacks energy. During the day, we go to swimming lessons and <br/>
play at our park for at least two hours in the afternoon. The kids take their <br/>
bikes out every day too. Each evening when Darin gets home, he and Jack go <br/>
outside and clean up the yard, wrestle around and walk the dogs. Both kids <br/>
also have evening and Saturday ballgames two or three times a week. (in the <br/>
spring and summer) When they go visit their grandparents in Oklahoma, my Mom <br/>
keeps them busy too. She takes them to the OKC zoo, to the omni-plex and the <br/>
hands on science museum. They have bikes at her house and they ride all over. <br/>
My Dad takes them walking on the nature trails with his dog, fishing, and <br/>
teaches them gun safety. The little boy who I used to be at my wits end with, <br/>
now sleeps peacefully all night and isn&#39;t bouncing off the walls all day. He <br/>
can sit for a story and *most of the time* helps around the house. <br/>
Ironically, when he went to school this past year, he showed no signs of <br/>
ADD/ADHD. His teacher said he sat still during lessons, played nice... All <br/>
the things that are revered in public school. <br/>
<br/>
Although I know there are children who have ADD/ADHD, I seriously doubt that <br/>
Jack ever had it. I believe that if his doctor had taken the time to visit <br/>
with Jack, he would have (maybe?) told me I was overreacting. I also believe <br/>
that if I had taken the time to read about, and talk to other parents with <br/>
children diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, I would have seen that Jack didn&#39;t fit the <br/>
picture.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons learned with children are often the hardest. In some ways I am glad <br/>
this all happened, it gives me empathy with those who struggle with this <br/>
every day. It also opened my eyes regarding my own needs as a parent. I <br/>
really loosened up after all was said and done. This is when I learned that <br/>
if something isn&#39;t going to matter in 10 minutes, then it just isn&#39;t worth <br/>
worrying about at all.<br/>
Just my 15 cents. ~Nancy<br/>

Everything we do is a substitute for something else we could be doing.<br/>
Hiking in the woods or looking for bugs might be a substitute for<br/>
painting a picture or baking cookies, but that doesn&#39;t make hiking in<br/>
the woods wrong.  It&#39;s just the choice for the moment. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering the same kinds of things.  And wondering whether Marc isn&#39;t <br/>
heavy on Gardner&#39;s nature intelligence, and lighter on visual and musical, <br/>
perhaps.  Because all the bugs in the world you can find and watch life <br/>
cycles on will not bring you pictures of Nepal, nor opera, nor Shakespeare.  <br/>
Yet on TV there are also bugs!<br/>
<br/>
I know someone who disparages and rejects books with pictures.  TRULY isn&#39;t <br/>
interested in picture books.  Because... because she learns from written word <br/>
only, and pictures irritate her. She is not at all a visual learner.  But <br/>
instead of saying &quot;Some people are visual learners,&quot; she says people who need <br/>
pictures aren&#39;t as smart as she is.<br/>

them.<br/>
And I realized your comment about &quot;marching their little butts around&quot;<br/>
was facetious, but I&#39;ve just become more aware in recent years of an<br/>
unconscious attitude that children are second class citizens.  I make<br/>
comments like yours myself at times, and then I try to imagine saying<br/>
the same thing in the same way about a respected adult, or hearing my<br/>
husband saying it about me.  It&#39;s an eye-opening exercise.<br/>
Imagine a husband saying to his friends about his wife &quot;I marched her<br/>
little butt all over creation today and she *had* to keep up.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is interesting.  I have a few questions if you don&#39;t mind...<br/>
Do you feel the same way about other non-physically active pastimes-<br/>
like reading for example?  In other words, would you say &quot;reading is not<br/>
a good substitute for anything that involves physical activity&quot;?   I was<br/>
shamed for reading too much as a child and told I should be out<br/>
&quot;playing.&quot;<br/>

Also, what about watching tv while simultaneously doing something else?<br/>
We&#39;ve watched tv while folding laundry, while playing with legos or<br/>
other building toys, while drawing pictures, while having a conversation<br/>
about what&#39;s on the tv, etc.  Some people even exercise while they watch<br/>
tv.  Watching tv doesn&#39;t automatically equal inactivity.<br/>
