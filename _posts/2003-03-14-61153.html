<div id="ygrps-yiv-170093414">About 11:30 am this morning, just as I was about to jump in the <br/>
shower before a day of grocery shopping and errand running, the phone <br/>
rang to inquire if I&#39;d be able to substitute teach for the afternoon. <br/>
I was told that the teacher had suddenly gotten sick and needed to go <br/>
home.  Since we really need the income right now, are in deep debt <br/>
due to market losses and having to live on savings for a year, I <br/>
said, sure, and told them I would be there as soon as I as could get <br/>
showered and dressed. <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;sick&quot; teacher was still there when I arrived. Turns out she had <br/>
a very strange sickness, hopefully nothing contagious. I would call <br/>
it &quot;Post Traumatic Stress Disorder&quot; after being assaulted by a <br/>
student. Nice of the school to grossly misrepresent the situation to <br/>
me. While the teacher was trying to scrape up lesson plans and <br/>
whatever she could for me to do with her kids for the rest of the day <br/>
she literally started to collapse. Other teachers came to her rescue <br/>
and walked her out as they pulled together some worksheet packets for <br/>
me to give the kids. <br/>
<br/>
The class was quite obviously riled, very difficult to settle them <br/>
down for the rest of the afternoon. One young man started off <br/>
punching another student hard with a closed fist in the shoulder <br/>
while they were standing at the pencil sharpener. I sent him to the <br/>
office. Then another young man slapped another student hard, but <br/>
open-fisted, on the top of his head. Others ranged from just <br/>
bouncing off the walls, to angry and showing it any way they could.  <br/>
I mean, what do you expect after what they had apparently witnessed? <br/>
<br/>
The assistant principal came in early, after the first kid punched <br/>
another kid, and spent about 20 minutes trying to settle the class <br/>
down. And other teachers kept popping in on me to see if I needed <br/>
any help. However no one ever said a word to me about the assault. <br/>
About the time I had just about settled the class and they were <br/>
quietly working the assistant principal popped in to warn me that <br/>
they were going to have a fire drill. He supervised sending the kids <br/>
to their lockers to get jackets, because it was cold outside, and <br/>
showed me where I was to exit the building, what we were to do <br/>
outside. Yuppers. Just what we needed. You can imagine how easy it <br/>
was to settle them back down after all that! <br/>
<br/>
Just another day in PS. Don&#39;t you all just wish that your kids were <br/>
there? If any of you are still thinking about sending your kids to <br/>
public school, please read this again. I still don&#39;t know exactly <br/>
what happened, but about the only learning that took place was that<br/>
some kids learned how to create a big scene at school, and others <br/>
followed suit and learned how to get plenty of negative attention. <br/>
There was a cop in the building when I arrived, but no one told me if <br/>
the kid who assaulted the teacher had used a weapon, or not. By the <br/>
way, I think I forgot to mention that this was a fourth grade class. <br/>
Cute little tykes!<br/>

Yikes!  I had read the whole thing picturing fifteen year olds!<br/>
<br/>
That will add a few more years to my resolution NOT to go back to teach no <br/>

However some of us unschooling moms choose to keep teaching now and <br/>
then to keep our credentials legit so that (in our state) we can do <br/>
portfolio assessments for other unschooling families.  Here we must <br/>
be state certified to sign these pieces of paper.  It also gives me <br/>
plenty of inside information to give families who are thinking about <br/>
home education, but not sure they want to try it. <br/>
<br/>
I recommend that anyone who is thinking of sending their kids to <br/>
school and who can meet the requirements for subbing, do so.  This is <br/>
especially good if you move around from school to school, to see lots <br/>
of variations.  I guarantee that you will have no doubts about home <br/>
educating after a few such forays into public education.  I don&#39;t do <br/>
it often, but enough to keep my credentials active, and enough to <br/>
pull us through when finances are thinner than usual.  <br/>
<br/>
Next week I start a contract job, so I won&#39;t be subbing anymore this <br/>
year, most likely.  The contract job will give me another chapter in <br/>
my book, I am sure.  I will be correcting proficiency tests from <br/>
various states around the country.  Should be more new from the <br/>
trenches, though a different set of trenches, from this interesting <br/>
work experience.<br/>

I know.  I&#39;ve thought about teaching music if I go back.  Not English.  <br/>
Regardless of what&#39;s true and fair, nobody gets mad at the teacher if a kid <br/>
can&#39;t sing well.  But if a 9th grade teacher gets a kid who can hardly read <br/>
and who hates the world and all humans in it (understandably so), at the end <br/>
of 9th grade their parents will be angry with the teacher because he hasn&#39;t <br/>
gone from 3rd grade reading level to 10th grade in his small sliver of that <br/>
year with 130 students.   Too much pressure on English teachers.  Too much <br/>
using English for the class in which such matters as insurance, annuals, <br/>
federal reporting forms, etc. are done because everybody has an English class.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I  get nearly nostalgic and think &quot;I could do that.  That was a <br/>
good thing to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Subbing has never been easy or civilized.  I think that must be one of the <br/>
hardest jobs in the world.   <br/>

But really interesting!  Especially after 30 years of being away from <br/>
public schools.   And especially from an unschooling mama&#39;s point of <br/>
view.  I never fit in the first place, got fired a lot, rocked the <br/>
boat a lot, got in trouble for it.  But everything looks very <br/>
different 30 unschooling years later, to be sure.  I now know better <br/>

and I am happy to say I am proud of it!<br/>

<br/>
That sounds just awful.  I couldn&#39;t believe it when you said it was 4th grade!  Please tell me more.  (You can write me privately since I know this list is for unschooling) <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:litlrooh@...">litlrooh@...</a> <br/>

My older two are planning to return to school next year, 9th and 6th grade.  But to be quite honest, I really don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be there long.<br/>
<br/>
All 3 of my kids are very anti-people telling them what to do...LOL  (and I&#39;m GLAD).  All 3 of them say that school is stupid.  They just want to &quot;check it out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest who is 7 spent a day with her friend and they &quot;did school&quot;.  Actually what they did sounded really fun aned I thought she&#39;d come home and say &quot;I wish *you* would do that&quot;.  But my daughter said she didn&#39;t really enjoy it because she didn&#39;t really want to do it but the friend told her she HAS to. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591180208">ME TOO!!! I taught for a few years and was not very happy at all. I<br/>
taught at a couple of different private schools and at each one got in<br/>
trouble for things like putting things on the wall children had written<br/>
that had spelling mistakes, or letting my class get a little too noisy<br/>
while working on projects. I hated it. I did find a good fit after a<br/>
while - but now that I learn about homeschooling and unschooling, I too<br/>
understand why I had such a hard time with some of those places.<br/>
