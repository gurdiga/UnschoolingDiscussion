too much for a child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1641848529">the only thing we have noticed about her chocolate allergy is that it is <br/>
worse in the spring so easter is always the worst reaction time. i&#39;ll keep <br/>
an eye out for the types of chocolate and see if it makes a differnece.<br/>
i know about the bee allergy. usually the first bee sting doesn&#39;t cause a <br/>
sever reaction but the second does. it is a good idea to have a epi pin <br/>
though. i had never thought of having one around just in case.<br/>

<br/>
In Canada you no longer need a prescription to buy an epi-pen. Maybe <br/>
ask your doc or pharmacist if you can buy one over the counter now. <br/>
We&#39;re far out in the wilderness a lot so we do carry epi-pens with <br/>
our first aid gear.<br/>
