<div id="ygrps-yiv-802022858">I have to make a persuasive Public Relations speech at Toastmasters  on Thursday.  I would LOVE suggestions/help with appealing to others� self-interest using fact and emotion surrounding Unschooling/Homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
It�s mostly about acknowledging the opposing view & citing experts.  I�m thinking there�s lots in David Albert�s new book, but wondering if there is any other bits I could use.<br/>
<br/>
Thx! in advance<br/>

PS. One person in the audience is adamantly opposed to HS. Adamantly!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have to make a persuasive Public Relations speech at Toastmasters  on <br/>
Thursday.  I would LOVE suggestions/help with appealing to others’ self-interest <br/>
using fact and emotion surrounding Unschooling/Homeschooling.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might be only disarming and not persuading (to your worst critic) but <br/>
maybe you could work in that one of the most uncomfortable things about <br/>
homeschooling, from the outside, is that it causes people to examine their own childhood <br/>
experiences, and most people have very painful childhood experiences and so <br/>
they resist ANYTHING that would cause that sort of self reflection.<br/>
<br/>
Your anti-homeschooling guy can stew in that or not, but it might be at least <br/>
enough to stun him momentarily.<br/>
<br/>
And I think it&#39;s profoundly true, too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
