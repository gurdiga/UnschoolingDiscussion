<div id="ygrps-yiv-971992492">at a used curriculum sale? <br/>
<br/>
5 chapter books (8-12 yr old range for me to read aloud)<br/>
Usborne puzzle books math, spelling, grammar<br/>
Braids & Bows<br/>
Timon & Pumba video<br/>
Compound word wrap ups (the 6 yr old who doesn&#39;t read begged for these, I can <br/>
<br/>
see that I need to get him some ability appropriate ones for him-in fact all<br/>
the kids think they are pretty cool)<br/>
Power Glide -German (9 yr old dd wants to learn German - was so excited that<br/>
I purchased this for her!)<br/>
Math work book (9 yr old wants some harder math problems)<br/>
Usborne how to make simple crafts<br/>
Rocks & Minerals (yes mom I really need this book I promise I&#39;ll use it &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
Clutters Last Stand & 365 Easy Ground Meat recipes (for me!)<br/>
<br/>
As we were leaving we hit a burger joint for lunch and we ate outside.  The <br/>
boys got to run around a bit and my dd and I talked about our purchases.<br/>
She told me what a cool mom I am, and she said its not just because you<br/>
buy me stuff! So I said why am I cool?  Because I don&#39;t force them to learn<br/>
things. Because she knows that if she doesn&#39;t want to learn German after<br/>
all she can quit at anytime.  She knows that not all moms would feel <br/>
the same way.  We feel quite lucky to have each other ; )<br/>
