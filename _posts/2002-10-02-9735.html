What does &quot;Krelboyne&quot; mean? <br/>
The 1960 film &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot; featured a socially inept lead<br/>
character named &quot;Seymour Krelboined.&quot; <br/>
The story was later adapted for an off-Broadway musical, (entitled<br/>
&quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;) in which the main character&#39;s surname was<br/>
changed to &quot;Krelborn.&quot; The 1986 movie of the same name is based upon this<br/>
version. <br/>
The term &quot;Krelboyne&quot; (used to describe the members of Malcolm&#39;s school<br/>
class) is a deliberate combination of &quot;Krelboined&quot; and &quot;Krelborn.&quot; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, Nancy started it!  <br/>
I typed in Krelboin and got Malcolm, spelling, Krelboyne, then did a<br/>
search on that spelling and got the site I posted the link to, among<br/>
others.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still learning all the wonders of Google.  <br/>
