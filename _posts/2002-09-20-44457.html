&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know off of the top of my head if you can order a single issue<br/>
 when it&#39;s the current issue.  But I think you can order back issues. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can order back issues for around $6.<br/>
I think it&#39;s a good one to subscribe to also!!<br/>
Sandra has a regular column now. Very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299808577">Thanks, I ordered a subscription a few days ago and a back issue as <br/>
well.  I just got confirmation today that it went through ...I had <br/>
trouble ordering because I have an apo address.  Hopefully I&#39;ll get <br/>
them.  <br/>
