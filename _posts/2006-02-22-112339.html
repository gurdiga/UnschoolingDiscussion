I&#39;m glad that the information helped you. I&#39;ve also been in contact <br/>
with Susan, and she and her website have been very valuable tools for <br/>
our family.<br/>

WRONG, and untrue.<br/>
<br/>
A parent cannot decide how a child will feel.<br/>
A parent&#39;s guess about a child&#39;s feelings could be absolutely and  <br/>
totally off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I meant when I said it was for her to decide is that SHE knows <br/>
her child, intamately and personally, which NOBODY ELSE on this board <br/>
can say. SHE would know better than the rest of us whether or not it <br/>
would be beneficial for her child, regardless of the opinions of the <br/>
rest of the people on the boards.<br/>

dyslexia - Sandra and Lynn&quot;<br/>
but rather make your comments into the group, addressed to all.<br/>
<br/>
Parents have claimed for years to speak for their children, and tell  <br/>
people how their children felt, and &quot;He&#39;s sorry&quot; (or &quot;you&#39;ll be  <br/>
sorry&quot;) and on and on.  Parents have traditionally told children how  <br/>
they feel, how they should feel, and denied their exressions of how  <br/>
they feel.<br/>
<br/>
That is going on all around us, on all sides, and past, present and  <br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d prefer it not be advocated on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think something was left out of that sentence, but I think I still  <br/>
get the gist of it.  And I still disagree.<br/>
There are parents who seem POSITIVE that they know their children and  <br/>
no one else does, yet they do some pretty horrendous things to them.<br/>
<br/>
All the statements on this page were made by parents of children.   <br/>
The statements were made in writing, in public:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet</a><br/>
Can you look at that and say that it&#39;s up to each of them to decide  <br/>
whether their children will react as they&#39;ve claimed?<br/>
<br/>
-=-SHE would know better than the rest of us whether or not it<br/>

rest of the people on the boards.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe so and maybe not.<br/>
Some people are better at interpersonal understanding than others.   <br/>
Some are oblivious for one reason or another.  Some want to believe  <br/>
what they believe so much that they will ignore any evidence to the  <br/>
contrary.<br/>
