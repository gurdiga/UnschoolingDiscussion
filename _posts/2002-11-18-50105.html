<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277360688">Gosh, I haven&#39;t checked in and read for a while.  But it is so nice <br/>
to know the group is here ...as if I might click on the link one day <br/>
and it would all be gone ;)  My only support for unschooling right <br/>
now is this group...lots of homeschoolers in Okinawa...not <br/>
unschoolers.  Anyway, my intentions of this post...I read and <br/>
article in HEM about placemats and it made me laugh because I <br/>
suddenly remembered all those great plastic placemats I had as a kid <br/>
and have never thought of them for mine.  I found a site with the <br/>
comedic name painless learning and ordered a bunch of different <br/>
placemats.  I know we will probably use them for anything but <br/>
placemats!  I just thought it was a neat way to explore.  I know my <br/>
kids will love them ...for everything.  Does anyone else use them?  <br/>
And not for keeping the table clean?  We are all hanging in here <br/>
with the unschooling.  Some days it is difficult because as so many <br/>
have said before it feels like we didn&#39;t do anything...but a closer <br/>
look at our day and I know it isn&#39;t true.  I sent in a letter to the <br/>
school denying services and most it, past the first sentence, was my <br/>
feelings on the way I was received at the IEP meeting.  No comment <br/>
from the principal...although I ran into one of the members of the <br/>
team and she apologized over and over about the miscommunication.  I <br/>
said that telling me a once per week visit to the school for spec. <br/>
services would be babysitting was a clear message.  She just <br/>
mentioned that the principal did use poor choice of words and can be <br/>
too blunt at times...on and on.  The worst thing I keep coming up <br/>
against with people is the socializatin thing.  I&#39;m not asking for <br/>
anyone&#39;s opinions here yet they seem to keep giving them to me as <br/>
soon as they hear I homeschool.  It starts by them asking my <br/>
children where they go to school and then it starts...it is usually <br/>
something like &quot;well as long as they are getting enough <br/>
socialization then...I guess it is good.&quot;  Ugghhh!  I didn&#39;t ask.  <br/>
One parent debated with me how her child&#39;s teacher told her that <br/>
hsing was not good because kids are not socialized enough...yet they <br/>
can&#39;t give you an example of interaction with a hsed kid who showed <br/>
signs of social ineptness!  Ok - I&#39;ll stop rambling...I&#39;ve just not <br/>
posted in so long and it is nice to rant every now and then.  <br/>

That makes me laugh...I&#39;ve actually thought of asking them to say, <br/>
when asked &quot;what school do you go to?&quot;...The World school and you?  <br/>
Maybe that will stop the questions :)<br/>
