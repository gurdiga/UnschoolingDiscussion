&gt;.  I have tried every type of Algebra book that I can find (public<br/>
&gt;&gt;school books, Abeka, Saxon, and Principles From Patterns by Making Math<br/>
&gt;&gt;Meaningful), and in the two years of &quot;high school&quot; that he has done at<br/>
&gt;home,<br/>
&gt;&gt;he has not yet finished even 1/2 of any algebra book.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tami, I went all the way thru highschool and never took one ounce of algebra<br/>
&gt;or preAlgebra, and I am a fine functioning human! I did take buisness math,<br/>
&gt;and that helped, I just didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t GET it! so maybe he just<br/>
&gt;feels overwhelmed by not understanding it, acting bored or not interested<br/>
&gt;sometimes can be a good sign that someone just can&#39;t relate to it in any way<br/>
&gt;shape or form, and that was me!, taxes do the same thing to me!<br/>

I must second this.  I have never been a math oriented person, and did as<br/>
little as possible of it in my ill fated school career.  I never even<br/>
memorized my times tables.  Yet I can still manage to balance my checkbook,<br/>
figure out sales tax and tips, calculate interest, count money and make<br/>
change, and calculate growth for my kids&#39; mutual funds.  My Husband helps<br/>
me where I falter, as he is a VERY math and science oriented Mechanical<br/>
Engineer.  I have been helping him to improve his vocabulary, spelling and<br/>
sentance structure, and business letter writing forms which all need a lot<br/>
of work.<br/>

    These remarks really do make me feel better.  I think I always felt this <br/>
way in my heart, but hearing other people say it really helps!<br/>
