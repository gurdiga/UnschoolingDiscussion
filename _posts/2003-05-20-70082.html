<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121359931">**Do &quot;they&quot;  (meaning teenagers) just go ahead and do what &quot;they&quot; want<br/>
regardless of what &quot;you&quot; (as parents) think?***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about this but in the meantime, I want to add that it isn&#39;t <br/>
just peer pressure.  They also have internal pressures and conflicts to deal <br/>
with as well.  I think somehow many of us forget that it isn&#39;t just young <br/>
children that forego what they &#39;should&#39; be doing for what they &#39;want&#39; to be <br/>
doing for many reasons.  Teens do this.  Adults do it as well.  In the sahm <br/>
and homeschooling circles, I am aware of many women who aren&#39;t in good <br/>
marriages and accept certain levels of behavior and neglect by their <br/>
husbands in order to stay at home that otherwise they wouldn&#39;t accept.  Some <br/>
are worse than others.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that viewing this in an us vs. them frame of mind is somewhat <br/>
flawed.  Perhaps seeing that they make mistakes will cast a different light. <br/>
  If we see that our children make mistakes and in doing so are given an <br/>
opportunity for growth and understanding, then we can approach the subject <br/>
in a different manner, perhaps avoiding the possibile feelings of anger, <br/>
resentment and guilt on both &#39;sides&#39; and allowing the opportunity for <br/>
thought provoking discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in hearing what others have to say....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240778532">This is so good, Jennifer, so TRUE.<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s expectations for their kids are so high - that they NEVER <br/>
make any mistakes, especially never make any big mistakes. And - <br/>
sometimes we are so arrogant, too, in thinking that we even KNOW that <br/>
some decisions are mistakes. That is something I had to learn - that I <br/>
really may not know - may NOT have better insight than my 18 yo about <br/>
her OWN life.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of things I&#39;ve discovered -- first, teens and young <br/>
adults push back when they feel pushed - they can&#39;t seem to help it, <br/>
and, second, they don&#39;t always act like they are really seriously <br/>
considering their parents&#39; opinions even when they are.<br/>
<br/>
So -- it is time to offer advice but not insist that they even LISTEN <br/>
to it, much less take it. EVEN when it is solicited - they might push <br/>
against it - but that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t considering it or don&#39;t <br/>
care what parents think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599648029">I never have understood the naked thing.  My little ones (4, 3, 2...well, <br/>
almost 3 and almost 2) run around naked all the time.  My family thinks they <br/>
should be punished for it.  Makes no sense to me whatsoever.  They don&#39;t do <br/>
it in public!  Um, well, ok, maybe Ethan did at McD&#39;s the other day but <br/>
ANYWAY &lt;bwg&gt;!<br/>
<br/>
I was raised to think nudity was a BAD thing.  I still don&#39;t feel <br/>
comfortable being naked in front of my own husband, not even by myself!  <br/>
It&#39;s a huge problem that I work on daily and has nothing to do with my &#39;body <br/>
image&#39; other than I was always told naked=bad.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids have gone through stages of wanting to be naked.  Some much more <br/>
than others.  Hannah, my 4.5 yr old rarely ever gets dressed if we are <br/>
spending the day at home.  We (the people living under this roof) don&#39;t even <br/>
notice it anymore.  I think most kids come to a stage where they become <br/>
&#39;aware&#39; of the social aspect of nudity and start to want to be in clothes in <br/>
front of others.  Nicholette just turned 7 and she still feels comfortable <br/>
being naked around me and the kids but not around my husband.  She&#39;ll run <br/>
around after her shower without clothes on but generally it doesn&#39;t last <br/>
very long.  Maybe an hour or so at most.  The older they get, the less they <br/>
want to be naked.<br/>
<br/>
But then there&#39;s Hannah who may never wear clothes unless we tie her down <br/>
and lock them on! :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad my kids don&#39;t feel the way I used to.  I&#39;m glad we have given them <br/>
an environment that doesn&#39;t stigmatize nude bodies as sexual beings only.<br/>
<br/>
Funky side note:  I think breastfeeding openly has helped to establish that <br/>
environment as well.  They don&#39;t go &quot;OOOOO Boobies!&quot; like so many kids do.  <br/>
Just another body part, no less amazing than the nose on their face!  I like <br/>
that!<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;What an excellent post.  It reminded me of how &quot;sexual&quot; people make<br/>
things.  My now 4 yo has always run around in a diaper and then<br/>
underwear.  Up until he turned 4  he would pretty much take of his<br/>
clothes and run around comfortably in his underwear.  My dh&#39;s family<br/>
and especially the kids ranging from younger than him to grown up<br/>
always had to comment.  They kept trying to kncikname him something<br/>
to do with being *naked*.  The kid wasn&#39;t *naked* and we never<br/>
thought twice about it.<br/>
