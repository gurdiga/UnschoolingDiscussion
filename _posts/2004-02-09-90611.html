<br/>
I thought I read it in Teach Your Own, but I can&#39;t find it back now.  I&#39;d <br/>
like to use it for a sig file, and I thought someone here might know it from <br/>
frequent use.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825741616">&quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns. Therefore, we do not need <br/>
to motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying. <br/>
We do not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they <br/>
are learning. What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as <br/>
much of the world as we can into the school and classroom; give <br/>
children as much help and guidance as they ask for; listen respectfully <br/>
when they feel like talking; and then get out of the way. We can trust <br/>
them to do the rest.&quot; - John Holt in &quot;How Children Learn&quot;</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you -- I haven&#39;t read How Children Learn yet, so I must have read this <br/>
re-quoted somewhere.  I hope you didn&#39;t go to too much trouble to look it up, <br/>
but I&#39;m glad you posted the whole thing -- I think Holt has such a nice rhythm <br/>
to his writing (the content and the style, if that makes sense).<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

time -- might be time to dig it out again.  Thanks for the quote!<br/>

He&#39;s writing conversationally, in his own voice, instead of using stilted <br/>
expositional jargon-filled teacherese.   It sounds like a guy writing you a <br/>
letter, not like reading a textbook about learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Holt always gives me the same feeling that Mr. Rogers did/does.  <br/>
That I matter, that I can do it, that he cares about my kids, that <br/>
if we were in a room together he would want to hear my thoughts, <br/>
that it is important to really listen to children and to give them <br/>
real information about the real world and real answers to their <br/>
questions, NOT dumbed down twaddle so that they will leave us alone <br/>
to do our important grown-up work.<br/>
<br/>
Just something good, healing, and right about both men&#39;s writings.  <br/>
If Dr. Sears was my first step toward gentle parenting, I guess Holt <br/>
and Rogers were my first steps to respectful parenting.</div>

with preconceived notions, but learned from observation.  And solid, because as <br/>
open as he was, he was also rigorous and careful . . . and right! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I just read &#39;Teach Your Own&#39;, my first Holt book. I had o keep putting it down to get up and pace because he started so many thoughts and ideas in me. Gatto was sort of like that for me  but his style was more an interesting lecture than a conversation. I didn&#39;t respond quite as much...and then he had his axe to grind about TV.<br/>
