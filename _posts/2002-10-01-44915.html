 </span></blockquote>Growing up, we always had Golden Retrievers and Yellow Labs. Both very smart, <br/>
loving, loyal dogs. Right now, my Dad has a Yellow Lab named Andy. Andy goes <br/>
to work with my Dad every day. He stays in the shop while my Dad is <br/>
supervising the guys loading the bauxite ore into the trucks, and when the <br/>
trucks are gone to the ships, Andy gets to run on the piles. He sits in the <br/>
bed of my Dad&#39;s truck and *guards* it, and when my Dad is at his house, Andy <br/>
tries to be a lap dog! When my Dad flies home on the weekends to be with my <br/>
Mom, Andy gets the run of the backyard. He loves the kids and tumbles around <br/>
the yard with them when they visit my folks. <br/>
When I was growing up, my dog was a Golden Retriever named Sam. He used to go <br/>
swimming with me and helped me with the cattle. Sam would even ride with me <br/>
in the tractor! He died playing fetch with my Dad and me when he was 13 years <br/>
old. He went out to get the ball I had thrown into the field, caught it, and <br/>
collapsed. Dad even tried mouth to mouth all the way to the vet. Sam was our <br/>
absolute favorite dog over the years. After he died, my Mom scanned a picture <br/>
of him, and made a crosstitch pattern. It is in an oak frame with Sam&#39;s chain <br/>
looped beneath. We took down a family portrait and hung Sam&#39;s there instead. <br/>
(we are that much of a dog loving family) <br/>
We don&#39;t have a big enough yard for a large dog, and I never thought I would <br/>
like a small dog. But I found Maggie one day at an auction, she was the runt, <br/>
and doesn&#39;t have that typical Boston flat nose. All her littermates were <br/>
being sold for hundreds of dollars and nobody wanted this (ugly by Boston <br/>
standards) puppy. I picked her up and the lady said I could have her if I <br/>
promised to love her even if she was ugly! Next to Sam, she is the best dog I <br/>
have ever had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207851723">Basset Hound.<br/>
<br/>
They are superior dogs, imho, great with children...sloppy though, but if you have a lot of room for the dog and it will be spending a lot of time outdoors, the sloppiness problem will decrease.<br/>
<br/>
They are great with other animals, gentle, fun loving, a bit on the lazy side, but if you play with them they&#39;ll play with you.  They&#39;ve got a great loud bark, but they aren&#39;t  yappy...if you are talking about sound.  Depends on the dog, but Caesar basically barks to get in and barks to play.  He is really the neighborhood dog.  He&#39;ll sit outside the whole day and play with everyone who comes by to pet him.  I identify myself as Caesar&#39;s owner, or describe him and people will instantly know who I am.   Neither the mail carrier or UPS fears him, but walk in and give us whatever.  By and large  they are very sweet animals.  <br/>
<br/>
Caesar will spend the whole time upstairs until the girls wake, waiting for them to get up.  Just sleeping up there with them unless the need is very great.   They are good guard dogs  in the sense that they have acute hearing and react quickly if they think something is amiss, however I don&#39;t know that they would attack a robber.   I joke Caesar  would show them the jewels...but he would jump and lick the guy to death, so we are okay.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

I have to say I am terribly partial to English Mastiffs.  This breed <br/>
may be a little too big for your tastes, but they are great on farms <br/>
and very loyal to families, especially children.  They need to be <br/>
with people and do well in cars (although they shake them a bit :)  <br/>
Mastiffs are always in need of rescue.  There are rescue <br/>
organizations set up in many states.  They are called the gentle <br/>
giants and that they are!  Good luck dog hunting.  By the way, the <br/>
akc site does have a kids page which gives tips on taking care of <br/>
dogs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044020224">I know a lot of people don&#39;t like them, but I love chows and malamutes. They both fit your criteria. I would be leery of getting a full-grown dog of either of these breeds, but if you could find a half-grown one, it would be perfect. They are both very loyal and protective, smart, love kids, they only bark (or in the malamute&#39;s case &quot;talk&quot;) when alerting you to someone/something or when you play with them, they both love riding in cars, love to run outside but can be happy inside for overnights or short bits of time, they&#39;ll get along with other dogs that &quot;belong&quot; in their space but will keep strange dogs away. They usually like cats too, but sometimes you&#39;ll find a chow that doesn&#39;t. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699494629">You just can&#39;t go wrong with a lab...<br/>
any lab mix is a good pick.<br/>
Lab/shepard is usually the best of both.<br/>
Bound to see some Jack Russells if you go to a shelter...they are the <br/>
popular-gotta get one breed- of the moment. on every commericial and tv <br/>
show...<br/>
they are high maintemence- they have to be busy- they are a working <br/>
breed. so, people buy them, then dump them when they can&#39;t handle the <br/>
energy. JRTs are known as &#39;Big dogs in a small body&#39;. No yapping, no <br/>
fear OF ANYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that , I will add that they  are extrememly loyal, <br/>
extremely easy to care for- little hair, very sturdy and rugged and <br/>
MASSIVELY intelligent. Having always had labs in the past. I must admit <br/>
to being pleased at the (much) lower cost of having a smaller dog.<br/>
We rescued ours from a cousin whose daughter thought she could keep the <br/>
puppy in her dorm room.... bawhaahahahahahah<br/>
we have plenty of room in the yard, we are home all day.. homeschoolers <br/>
are made to order owners for Jack Russels!<br/>
The &#39;tricks&#39; my kids have taught this dog are hysterical!<br/>
I am even thinking of getting a 2nd one... I can&#39;t believe I just typed <br/>
that..<br/>

Have fun, Dar!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571808489">Hi!<br/>
  I never thought I would post about a dog, since I am more of a cat-lover, <br/>
but I&#39;d like to mention our mini dachshund. He is very loving and definitely <br/>
a dog who loves attention from people. He does bark a little at passing birds <br/>
or strangers but is very friendly. He seems to think that he&#39;s a lot bigger <br/>
than his actual 10lbs! (He also licks people obsessively!) <br/>
