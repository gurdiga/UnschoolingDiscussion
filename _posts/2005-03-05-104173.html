<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210669763">The negativity of the &quot;Not how unscholing works&quot; subject line was bothering <br/>
me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Found this this morning, a couple of older things  I saved:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
JUST ADD LIGHT AND STIR<br/>
<br/>
If you want unschooling to work just <br/>
because you stick the curriculum under the couch, <br/>
it won&#39;t! Get the world swirling around you <br/>
(first) and your children (second) so there are <br/>
sounds, sights, smells, tastes and textures for <br/>
them to process and build their internal model of <br/>
the universe from. GET MOVING, mentally and <br/>
physically. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THIS WAS THE PARENT WRITING of the article on disposable checklists, but this <br/>
isnâ€™t that, and it has some unmined good stuff for later writings.<br/>

&lt;&lt; How did you get comfortable with not racing around and<br/>
&quot;providing&quot; entertainment for your children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gradually!<br/>
<br/>
I still provide entertainment for my children (and they provide things for <br/>
the rest of the family too, because (shhh...) they think that&#39;s just how <br/>
people in families are!  They don&#39;t associate it with unschooling directly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He&#39;s only interested in<br/>
standing them up and already I&#39;m thinking of chess tournaments&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Find a diagram of the board set up and leave it available.  He can copy that <br/>
pattern or not, but he&#39;ll realize there is a pattern.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s cool when the chess pieces on the chart don&#39;t look exactly like his <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe check out a book on chess pieces or history of game boards.  Not on <br/>
chess strategy at all, but on gaming history so he can see the history of the <br/>
pieces and the different forms.  Or if you&#39;re near a games shop, wander by <br/>
and look at different chess sets on display.  it will be like a teeny chess <br/>
museum.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be done at any one moment, just incorporate his interest <br/>
in chess pieces into your daily considerations until the time when he knows <br/>
more about it than you do (unless you&#39;re a whiz, and then sorry for the <br/>
assumption that you weren&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
One way for moms who love to checklist their days to provide without managing <br/>
is to go afield of verbal presentation.  Go through a list of the senses.  <br/>
And if each day you try to provide something interesting to taste, touch, <br/>
hear, see and smell, his day will be more full than flat.  Too many families <br/>
stop at things to hear and see. (Because school stops there, I guess.)<br/>
<br/>
But you don&#39;t have to do this until he&#39;s 17.  You can do it until you&#39;re <br/>
confident that he&#39;s filled with experiences to cross-reference at his own <br/>
leisure (in dreams, in fantasies, in future incidents which remind him of <br/>
those, etc.) and you feel satisfied that you&#39;re not a slacker.<br/>
<br/>
If just &quot;the five sense&quot; seems a lame checklist and you want four dimensional <br/>
instead of three, maybe each day work into conversation something about the <br/>
past and something about the future.  (I can hardly imagine a day without <br/>
those coming up naturally in my own family, but in case you&#39;re not really <br/>
talkative or something, it&#39;s something for the checklist.)  If it comes up <br/>
naturally in conversation you could say &quot;They didnt&#39; even have chainsaws <br/>
until... [whenever little gasoline engines were common, or whatever the <br/>
seminal technological feature is] and would have had to do all this with a <br/>
hand saw, or an axe.  (That&#39;s if you cut firewood with a chainsaw, not if <br/>
you&#39;re sitting around working a jigsaw puzzle of tiger cubs in the forest.)  <br/>
Or you could say &quot;How long do you think we will have these dishes?  When too  <br/>
many are broken, what kind should we get next?&quot; (if you have a girl with <br/>
those sorts of interests).  Various kinds of mind-casting conversations into <br/>
the past (personal past or technological past or cultural past or planetary <br/>
past) or into the future (tomorrow, next year, next century) help kids build <br/>
their internal model of the universe.  I know I&#39;ve used that phrase half a <br/>
dozen times talking about unschooling, but I think it&#39;s one of the coolest <br/>
ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
At school, there is a model of knowledge which they&#39;re hoping to insert into <br/>
each child&#39;s head.  And it has things that are dumb and arbitrary.  Like that <br/>
the history of England is way more important than the history of China (in <br/>
English speaking countries, there&#39;s a lot of justification for that, but <br/>
still, let me run my imperfect little thang here), and that there are some <br/>
authors EVERYBODY has to know, and others that are TOTALLY optional, <br/>
marginal, don&#39;t even brag if you&#39;ve read them.  And that some historical <br/>
cultures are hugely more important than others.  And some science is FACT and <br/>
some is marginal &quot;whatever,&quot; not appearing in this book.<br/>
<br/>
School kids don&#39;t know the world is a million times bigger than school&#39;s <br/>
version of it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids are also making a model of the universe inside them, but <br/>
they&#39;re making it their own way, and they&#39;re not valuing the school-bits over <br/>
the bits that their model has which are unique to them and their own personal <br/>
interests and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the main reason I think that an unschooler&#39;s checklist should look <br/>
more like the five senses and past/future than like science, history, <br/>
language, math, maybe-music-art-physical education.   Because that model is <br/>
prescriptive and limiting.  And the other is descriptive and unlimited.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779882316">-=-=-=-=-You have never read any long-years-experienced unschooler say that the schools should be abolished and everyone should unschool. The thousands of hours of writing that&#39;s been put in here, unschooling.com and various other places has  stressed that it takes a LOT of change and awareness on the part of the parents  to do this.  And it takes deschooling on the part of the child and of the  parents.  It&#39;s not easy.  It&#39;s not something just anyone can do.   And half-assed isn&#39;t good enough.  -=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, *I* have said that schools should be abolished and all kids should unschool! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I also know that it&#39;s absolutely impossible---for the reasons Sandra gave above.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard. Hard work. I do believe that *all* children are capable of unschooling. It&#39;s the parents that are the problem. Parents, society, and the huge, raging locomotive that is public education. <br/>
<br/>
Won&#39;t happen. Can&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
*Should* happen?     Uh huh! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097473003">-=-=-=-If I say &quot;Hey, I&#39;m sure it will be fabulous&quot;, he makes a skeptical face.   And I think it&#39;s reasonable for him to be skeptical.  It&#39;s not clear to me how to get past that.  When to try to sway him and when to fully accept his decision without argument.-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be careful of actually *saying*, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m sure it will be fabulous!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I might say, &quot;Yeah---it might be really lame. Hard to know if we don&#39;t go....&quot; &lt;g&gt; &quot;If it&#39;s fabulous, we can stay and know that we made the right decision and we won&#39;t regret having missed it. If it IS lame, we can leave and pick up sushi.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Generally mine won&#39;t miss the possibility for sushi! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But mine have had years of learning to trust when I suggest something that might be fabulous. And they can also trust that we&#39;ll leave if it IS lame. <br/>
<br/>
Trust. Trust. Trust!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t this the truth!!  I am still new to<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling(less than a year), but each week that<br/>
passes, I am so glad of the decision to pull my 14 yo son out of school! <br/>
<br/>
Just this week alone I have heard these statements during<br/>
conversations with a cousin and a close friend:  &quot;A GED is not worth<br/>
the paper it is printed on.&quot; - huh? why is that???  And, &quot;If your son<br/>
doesn&#39;t learn how to force himself to get through classes he doesn&#39;t<br/>
like now, then how will he be successful in college?  Again..huh?  <br/>
 <br/>
Obviously, both of these people are suffering from public education<br/>
brainwashing.  They both don&#39;t really get why I&#39;ve decided to<br/>
homeschool, even though I&#39;ve tried to explain. And they both have high<br/>
school-aged kids as well, and believe the experience is great. I feel<br/>
sad for them, because this unschooling path that we are on has made<br/>
such a difference in my previously sullen, negative son.  He is still<br/>
deschooling, but is slowly becoming more like his old playful, funny<br/>
self that he used to be before school damaged his spirit.<br/>
<br/>
And on the subject of public high school...has anyone seen the movie<br/>
&quot;Mean Girls?&quot;  Someone told me it was kind of funny, so I checked it<br/>
out and couldn&#39;t believe what I saw!  <br/>
<br/>
The main character lived in Africa with her parents and was<br/>
homeschooled her whole life - until her parents returned to the US to<br/>
teach at a university, and put their daughter in a public HS.  Things<br/>
went downhill from there!  Everything that we hate about public HS,<br/>
she had to deal with: cliques, pretending to be dumb to get a guy&#39;s<br/>
attention, not wearing the &quot;right&quot; clothes, the &quot;us against the<br/>
adults&quot; mentality, pressure to party, the mean, manipulative behavior<br/>
of peers, and on and on.  It was horrible - and she was miserable and<br/>
confused, but her parents kept her there.  And the worst part was, she<br/>
went thru all of this angst, just to discover that she wanted to be<br/>
the person she was before she started public school!  <br/>
<br/>
What torture for her - and for me to watch (but of course I couldn&#39;t<br/>
turn it off - I needed to see how things were going end!). I didn&#39;t<br/>
get it- we are supposed to be so happy at the end because she &quot;learned<br/>
her lesson&quot;  and learned how to be herself again?   I think it was<br/>
supposed to make HS look like such a character-building time, but in<br/>
my opinion, it showed how horrible HS really is, and that the girl&#39;s<br/>
real character was developed because she had all those previous years<br/>
of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Any lingering doubts I still may have had about pulling my son out are<br/>
completely gone now!  How can that public education experience be<br/>
preferable to letting our children find their own path in a more<br/>
positive and encouraging environment?!<br/>
<br/>
Just my recent observations... and proof that unschooling has been an<br/>
eye-opening experience for me as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866806968">I have just become a volunteer tutor for GED classes here in my town.  There<br/>
is a professional teacher who is also volunteering and she told me that two<br/>
thirds of high school graduates would fail a GED.  And after looking at the<br/>
prep book and what they have to know, I was horrified at the expectations<br/>
(or lack thereof) that public school students are supposed to meet.  One of<br/>
my sutdents has a diploma from Haiti where she grew up, but she feels she<br/>
has something to &quot;prove&quot;, so she is studying to take the GED in English.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824184278">-=-=-=-=-I was perplexed by what sounded like some bashing of parents. I have been wondering if I should even remain a member but thought to stick it out longer to get a better -=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Jenn, it&#39;s a really good idea to hang around and read a lot to get the feel of a list (any list). There are a lot of different personalities here. Sometimes we come across as real bitches, but if you were to go back a read the archives for a few months, you could get a feel for who we really are.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes someone comes in and disrupts the list to the nth degree, and we all band together to keep the list true to its goal and purpose. Often we come across as difficult and a bit...ummmm....even nasty.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a file, &quot;Shit on Kelly/compliments&quot; in which I stored all the hate mail and fan mail I received. More fan mail than hate mail, but---boy, were there some doozies! &lt;g&gt; One (and she knows who she is! &lt;g&gt;) wrote me BOTH! After she got to &quot;know&quot; me virtually, she realized I wasn&#39;t so bad! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let the strong personalities scare you: these are the cream of the crop in understanding and explaining unschooling that you&#39;ll find anywhere!<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;how to&quot;---well, it looks different in each and every family. We (my family) DO spend a lot of money on travel, because that&#39;s what we, as a family, value. But there are plenty of folks who spend big money on electronics or books or art or critters or ---BACK HOES (or whatever that was up for discussion a few weeks ago! ???Road grader???) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, your most valuable unschooling &quot;tool&quot; is completely and totally FREE. It&#39;s YOU and your voice. Talk with your kids. Ask questions. Answer questions. Ask their opinions. Create with them. BE with them. Do WITH them. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s cool that you get the &quot;why&quot;---most people have more trouble with that! The &quot;how&quot;---well, you have to figure that out for your own family---and each child may be different----and different from YOU! The &quot;how&quot; varies so much that it&#39;s hard----no! *impossible* to pinpoint.<br/>
<br/>
The more you do it, the easier it gets. I promise! &lt;g&gt; And reading about how others do it can help a lot. And don&#39;t think you must provide something every minute of every day. Solitude and down time and daydreaming and veging out are all acceptable and important!<br/>
<br/>
Stick around: you may find you *like* us!<br/>
