&lt;&lt; I understand now about not putting restrictions on foods; however, we DO <br/>
<br/>
have a budget.  So I am wondering how does one say &quot;no&quot; to buying food so <br/>
<br/>
that one does not rack up a huge bill of sugary foods while not making it <br/>
<br/>
like the sugary foods are &quot;off limits?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lest visions of sugarplums are crowding your head, I will use another area to <br/>
illustrate.<br/>
<br/>
Someone kinda snippily jumped on Pam Sorooshian (I think it was) once, when <br/>
Pam had said she let her kids play video games all they wanted.  The response <br/>
was something like &quot;I can&#39;t afford to buy all the video games in the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Uh... <br/>
Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
That was a non-sequitor.<br/>
<br/>
So with food.  You don&#39;t have to buy the whole grocery store to loosen up on <br/>
rules and regulations regarding the ingestion of foodstuffs within the <br/>
confines of your home.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to the store, I ask my kids if there&#39;s something they want.  <br/>
Usually they say no.   Sometimes they&#39;ll name something they&#39;ve had a craving for.  <br/>
Recent requests were some jelly other than grape, bananas, <br/>
whatever-those-nuts-are-in-that-candy (filberts, I said, and we found them in the shell at Wild <br/>
Oats), Malt-o-Meal, and cranberry juice.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has asked for candy or cookies.  I asked for Oreos a couple of weeks <br/>
ago and Keith brought oreos with chocolate inside.  I didn&#39;t care.  Holly <br/>
didn&#39;t like them and asked if we could get regular ones next time.  So I bought <br/>
regular ones.  That&#39;s been over a week.  I&#39;ve eaten a dozen of them.  I wish I <br/>
hadn&#39;t.  I put eight out on a plate of snacky stuff during Marty&#39;s birthday <br/>
pizza dinner the other night and they went (along with four large pizzas, two cans <br/>
of pineapple chunks, two cans of olives, a bowl of pistachios, a chocolate <br/>
orange which had been in the bowl with the Oreos, and 1/3 of a small birthday <br/>
cake.  They didn&#39;t want cake.  They were full of pizza.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody came and said &quot;Do you have more Oreos?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I did.<br/>
<br/>
Still do.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids are with you at the store, they can get the same thrill of <br/>
choosing just for you letting them choose which fruit and vegetables to get, which <br/>
juice to get, what cereal.  You could ask if they want to pick something, or <br/>
you could cruise the canned fruit aisle, or dried fruit in bags, or something <br/>
new and different to them.  But why would you say &quot;You can have any and <br/>
everything you want&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If they ask for something you can&#39;t afford, you could ask if there&#39;s <br/>
something they&#39;re willing to put back, or you could say &quot;Okay, let&#39;s put that on the <br/>
list for next time.&quot;  When next time comes, they might say &quot;never mind&quot; or they <br/>
might say &quot;YES!  thanks for remembering.&quot;<br/>

healthy snack for you and giving it to your child so they can purchase what<br/>
they would like? If they get to pick something every time they go, even just<br/>
one thing, I wouldn&#39;t think it would make that much of a dent in the budget<br/>
and still give some freedom for a little kid snack of their choice.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I have finally found the solution for Jayn wanting to run away from me in<br/>
the grocery store. I ask her to go and choose some lemons or tomatoes or<br/>
something nearby. It helps that since the strike we have been shopping in<br/>
Trader Joe&#39;s that is both smaller and cheaper, with fewer choices (eg no<br/>
endless racks of nasty candies - just a few good quality ones). Last time<br/>
she couldn&#39;t see the lemons so &quot;took off&quot; to find an attendant to help her.<br/>
She is pretty cute so the guys are usually really sweet to her, then she<br/>
brings the stuff to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101943425">Why couldn&#39;t you and the kids come up with a plan for meals for the week <br/>
or two weeks or whatever. Then based on that plan, shop. In my house, <br/>
each person gets a treat of their choice. Half the time it&#39;s sugary <br/>
foods, the other half it&#39;s strange things like brocoli or grape <br/>
tomatoes. I don&#39;t really keep track. The kids also know that items on <br/>
sale are more liekly to be purchased and items that come with a coupon <br/>
are more likely to be purchased. THere are no fast rules, just <br/>
guidelines respecting everyone&#39;s choices, needs, wants. .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095970832">What I started doing is going grocery shopping without the children.<br/>
<br/>
I found that when I took the children with me, we would inevitably end up<br/>
with all sorts of junk food in the cart, mainly because the children would<br/>
fall for the pretty packaging, characters on the box, etc.  It was a total<br/>
impulse buy on the part of the children.  It wasn&#39;t something they wanted<br/>
before they saw it in the store.<br/>
<br/>
Every once in awhile, I&#39;ll surprise them by bringing home something like<br/>
that, especially if it&#39;s on sale.  And then it&#39;s a treat.<br/>

Removing limits isn&#39;t about removing real limits. It&#39;s about recognizing and<br/>
eliminating the arbitrary limits that we impose because of fear and to make<br/>
life more convenient for mom.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;All sorts&quot;?  If you let them pick a thing, that would be just a few things, <br/>
but in addition, if you get to the point where you&#39;re not so concerned with <br/>
separating food into good and &quot;junk&quot; and the kids get to the point that they <br/>
really trust that they will have food when they&#39;re hungry and that the kitchen <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;The House of NO,&quot; I think you&#39;ll find them as happy to have strawberries <br/>
as fruit roll-ups.<br/>
<br/>
Going to the store without children sometimes can be glorious for a mom of <br/>
several little children.  I remember letting other people cut in front of me <br/>
while I read the magazines at the rack, stalling before going home, feeling the <br/>
quiet and the stillness of not having another human hanging off of me.<br/>
<br/>
But never taking children to the store is depriving them of a LOT of learning <br/>
opportunity.  I think going to new and different stores just for the new <br/>
stimuli is one of the easiest unschooling tools a family can use.   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Every once in awhile, I&#39;ll surprise them by bringing home something like<br/>
<br/>
that, especially if it&#39;s on sale.  And then it&#39;s a treat.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;junk&quot; equals &quot;treat,&quot; children will crave those things.   If they only <br/>
occasionally have access to candy or whatever it is &quot;junk&quot; meant above, they <br/>
will dream about it and eat it as fast and as much as possible when it&#39;s there.  <br/>
&quot;Treat&quot; is good!  It&#39;s reward.  It&#39;s happy.<br/>
<br/>
If that candy is just another thing on the shelf, and it will be there later, <br/>
you might find them letting it get dusty, eventually, but that won&#39;t happen <br/>
until some time AFTER the parents can get over the food prejudices and <br/>
deprivations and requirements so many of us grew up with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909122699">We do once a month shopping. And weekly quick trips to the store. I <br/>
have a list and a meal plan, because our budget is tight. Everyone <br/>
adds to the list. Meal ideas and individual needs and wants. Then we <br/>
tally it all up and make adjustments.Everyones needs and wants are <br/>
equal.  <br/>
Because the Sams Club and Walmart are 120 miles away we usually all <br/>
go. The kids make a day out of it. Checking out toys and video <br/>
games. Some of them help me fill our list. They like to ride on top <br/>
of the big cart.They budget and tell me what the best deal is.  <br/>
Last time we went to shop it was very very cold.. -20. I hate to <br/>
drive in cold or icy roads, but we needed to shop desperately. The <br/>
three boys did not want to go. We live in the country and with them <br/>
being 12 and under I would not be okay with leaving them for at <br/>
minimum 6 hours.  So hubby volunteered to do the shopping. lol.. He <br/>
never does the shopping. He and 8 y.o. daughter did it. They had a <br/>
great time.  Ashton advised on anything David was unsure of. <br/>
David came home very tired and with a great respect for shopping.. <br/>
SO you can learn at any age.. lol..<br/>

<br/>
I LOVE shopping with my kids!  Without them, shopping is...boring.  They&#39;re usually the one&#39;s that find all of the cool new stuff.  And my youngest is my bargain shopper...he scans the shelves looking for the best buy on something we need or want.  I usually spend MORE if he&#39;s not with me, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned having to buy junk food when the kids are along.  I think you have to expect that.  Junk food is fun!  A little bit mixed in with everything else won&#39;t hurt anything.  <br/>
<br/>
I mean, come on, everyone needs a little junk food every now and then.  ;-)<br/>

shopping, so it doesn&#39;t stress me. I adore taking the kids and making a <br/>
learning adventure out of it. Btw, did you know there&#39;s a whole body of research <br/>

notice what&#39;s going on with product placement, displays, et cetera. It&#39;s <br/>
called the Science of Shopping, I think, by Paco Underhill. Fascinating stuff!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447221716">Forgive me if I came off as being snippily....not at all my intent.  Let&#39;s <br/>
just say that this is a new concept for me, and I am sure that I am asking <br/>
obvious questions here.  However, sometimes I tend to overthink what I am <br/>
doing with my children and am not always certain how to present things to <br/>
them.  This is why I come to you experienced ladies to ensure that I am on <br/>
the right track.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, my son ate icecream for breakfast and got a stomachache at the <br/>
park later.  So we went shopping and got the makings for a lovely dinner, <br/>
whereupon he decided to eat half the box of cookies that he had chosen <br/>
instead.  I breathed and let it go.  This morning he woke up and noticed the <br/>
cookies left on the table.  He said, &quot;Huh...there are still cookies left <br/>
there,&quot; and then went on playing.  We then ate a good breakfast.  The <br/>
cookies seem to have become a moot point now.<br/>
<br/>
As for the TV restrictions, I told my son that he could now watch TV <br/>
whenever that he wanted.  He said, &quot;Really??!!&quot;  The first morning he woke <br/>
up and watched his PBS shows until 2pm.  He said to me with a very peaceful <br/>
expression on his face, &quot;Thank you Mama for just letting me have quiet <br/>
time.&quot;  The next day or so they watched TV more than usual.  Yesterday they <br/>
woke up and the thought never crossed their minds - they played Star <br/>
Wars/Ninja Turtle games all day, and today it is the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I am seeing the light.<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I understand now about not putting restrictions on foods; however, we DO<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;have a budget.  So I am wondering how does one say &quot;no&quot; to buying food so<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;that one does not rack up a huge bill of sugary foods while not making it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;like the sugary foods are &quot;off limits?&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lest visions of sugarplums are crowding your head, I will use another area <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;illustrate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Someone kinda snippily jumped on Pam Sorooshian (I think it was) once, when<br/>
&gt;Pam had said she let her kids play video games all they wanted.  The <br/>
&gt;response<br/>
&gt;was something like &quot;I can&#39;t afford to buy all the video games in the <br/>
&gt;world.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uh...<br/>
&gt;Yeah.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That was a non-sequitor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So with food.  You don&#39;t have to buy the whole grocery store to loosen up <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;rules and regulations regarding the ingestion of foodstuffs within the<br/>
&gt;confines of your home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I go to the store, I ask my kids if there&#39;s something they want.<br/>
&gt;Usually they say no.   Sometimes they&#39;ll name something they&#39;ve had a <br/>
&gt;craving for.<br/>
&gt;Recent requests were some jelly other than grape, bananas,<br/>
&gt;whatever-those-nuts-are-in-that-candy (filberts, I said, and we found them <br/>
&gt;in the shell at Wild<br/>
&gt;Oats), Malt-o-Meal, and cranberry juice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nobody has asked for candy or cookies.  I asked for Oreos a couple of weeks<br/>
&gt;ago and Keith brought oreos with chocolate inside.  I didn&#39;t care.  Holly<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t like them and asked if we could get regular ones next time.  So I <br/>
&gt;bought<br/>
&gt;regular ones.  That&#39;s been over a week.  I&#39;ve eaten a dozen of them.  I <br/>
&gt;wish I<br/>
&gt;hadn&#39;t.  I put eight out on a plate of snacky stuff during Marty&#39;s birthday<br/>
&gt;pizza dinner the other night and they went (along with four large pizzas, <br/>
&gt;two cans<br/>
&gt;of pineapple chunks, two cans of olives, a bowl of pistachios, a chocolate<br/>
&gt;orange which had been in the bowl with the Oreos, and 1/3 of a small <br/>
&gt;birthday<br/>
&gt;cake.  They didn&#39;t want cake.  They were full of pizza.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nobody came and said &quot;Do you have more Oreos?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I did.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Still do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If the kids are with you at the store, they can get the same thrill of<br/>
&gt;choosing just for you letting them choose which fruit and vegetables to <br/>
&gt;get, which<br/>
&gt;juice to get, what cereal.  You could ask if they want to pick something, <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;you could cruise the canned fruit aisle, or dried fruit in bags, or <br/>
&gt;something<br/>
&gt;new and different to them.  But why would you say &quot;You can have any and<br/>
&gt;everything you want&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If they ask for something you can&#39;t afford, you could ask if there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;something they&#39;re willing to put back, or you could say &quot;Okay, let&#39;s put <br/>
&gt;that on the<br/>
&gt;list for next time.&quot;  When next time comes, they might say &quot;never mind&quot; or <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;might say &quot;YES!  thanks for remembering.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We also have a very low food budget, and for a long time, I used this as an <br/>
excuse for not changing our way of eating.  Now that I&#39;m letting the kids eat <br/>
what they want when they want, I&#39;m find not spending more on food.  I think <br/>
this is due to 2 things. First when I buy more sugary foods, more fruit, more <br/>
meat (our food budget is really low and these are the things I always had to <br/>
restrict!) these foods are usually replacing other foods.  If the kids want <br/>
&quot;poptarts&quot;, I don&#39;t buy cereal.  I use the things they want to replace other things <br/>
that would usually be on our grocery list.  Also we now waste less food.  I <br/>
think this is funny because I always use to be worried about having enough food <br/>
and making sure all the kids were eating enough and would make them clear <br/>
their plates.  Now they don&#39;t throw out as much food because everything they take <br/>
they want.  I don&#39;t make casseroles for dinner any more, and I don&#39;t need all <br/>
that stuff.  Everything has pretty much evened out.  We don&#39;t spend any more <br/>
money, and we&#39;re all relaxed and happier.<br/>

Erika :) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, yes, balance  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like the suggestion of going by yourself to the store - but only at <br/>
the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
As you are on your way out to go to the store, casually ask each one <br/>
(sorry don&#39;t remember the number or ages of your children) what they <br/>
need from the store. <br/>
<br/>
(If yours are like mine were, the first time you do this they will <br/>
look at you with surprise/shock and say &quot;Really?&quot; or something like <br/>
that.)<br/>
<br/>
Calmly write it on your list or say OK and then buy the items.<br/>
<br/>
(When I did this, the first time I asked I only got one response from <br/>
each one - dd was probably 10yo and ds 16yo - items were shark bites <br/>
and Cinnamon Toast Crunch)<br/>
<br/>
When you get home, steel yourself  (dare I say &quot;bite your tongue&quot;  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) to not say anything negative when they eat it. If you have to <br/>
comment, brightly say &quot;Glad you enjoyed it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(My kids did wolf the stuff down - in my opinion &lt;g&gt; - but when it <br/>
was gone, I&#39;d just calmly say &quot;If you need more, add it to the list <br/>
and I&#39;ll pick it up next time&quot; rather than &quot;WHAT - it&#39;s gone <br/>
already?&quot; or some other unhelpful comment.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Repeat this each time you go to the store. Don&#39;t make a big deal out <br/>
of it - maybe say it like you would to dh. Be sure not to make <br/>
negative comments, either when they name their items or when they eat <br/>
them (very important if you want to hurry the process!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
(As I kept doing this, their lists got longer as they were better <br/>
prepared to answer  &lt;g&gt;.  Oh, I also had a running shopping list <br/>
going so they could add stuff to it.  The longest their lists ever <br/>
got was maybe 5 items each)<br/>
<br/>
Soon, (sooner if you don&#39;t make any negative comments) they&#39;ll start <br/>
adding stuff-you-consider-better to their list.<br/>
<br/>
(Here it was satsumas, avacados, cheese, deli meat)<br/>
<br/>
After a relatively short time  - TaaDaaa -  &quot;treats&quot; won&#39;t be as big <br/>
a deal to them, you won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re busting your budget when <br/>
the occasional request for a candy bar comes in, you can enjoy taking <br/>
your children to the store again, and (most important) your children <br/>
will be listening to their bodies to decide what their needs are.<br/>

holidays for healthier cooking ideas for me and DH (we are getting old  fast, and <br/>
starting to feel it!) and the children came to show me different things they&#39;d <br/>
found. <br/>
<br/>
       Then Dd13 saw one book in my section that caused her to put back her <br/>
other possible choices and pony up the purchase price out of her own pocket -- <br/>
&quot;The Gallery of Regrettable Foods&quot; complete with reproduced photographs and ad <br/>
copy from the last millennium, and some wry commentary.<br/>
<br/>
       If you, or your mom or grandmom, ever made casseroles from magazine <br/>
recipes or Better Homes and Gardens cookbooks, you might remember some of these <br/>
dishes all too well. It was a real education for Dd -- and all her friends. <br/>
They&#39;ve had no end of fun with it, and her dad and I got some yucks from it and <br/>
a chance to tell some stories. Forget rock n roll, casseroles seem to be the <br/>
memory&#39;s Great Equalizer among those of us reaching a certain, ahem, age.  JJ<br/>

My oldest can not handle sugar well and NO dairy allowed (or beef) for my<br/>

After a relatively short time  - TaaDaaa -  &quot;treats&quot; won&#39;t be as big <br/>
a deal to them, you won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re busting your budget when <br/>
the occasional request for a candy bar comes in, you can enjoy taking <br/>
your children to the store again, and (most important) your children <br/>
will be listening to their bodies to decide what their needs are.<br/>

falls into that category for you kids?  Many times honey can be substituted <br/>
in for sugar in homemade treats.<br/>

  ========================================================================<br/>
We&#39;re just heading down the allergy/sensitivity road as well because my 3 yo has similar kinds of rages. We&#39;re doing the Feingold, chocolate, dairy and soy (though there&#39;s some soy in the buttery spread that I have).  After 3 days, I&#39;ve noticed a tremendous difference.  He&#39;s gone from 5-7 major meltdowns a day that can last anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to maybe one or two blips that last a minute or two and can be defused using some of the typical techniques--snuggling, expressing his feelings, humor. This to me is a *major* improvement in our days. We can spend time as a family and play games instead of my girls (dd6 and dd5) having to play by themselves while I try to walk on eggshells and deal with my Sam.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still learning to modify our meals, but yesterday we made oatmeal cookies and waffles with maples syrup. I&#39;m going to pick up some peanut butter so I can make some peanut butter cookies. With the Feingold, it&#39;s not the sugar but the additives, and I know corn syrup can be really bad while all-natural cane sugar can be fine. There are lots of substitutions I can make, and much of it is just a matter of cooking from scratch. I&#39;ve been baking bread every day in the bread machine, things like that.  It&#39;s not really that big a deal, and the kids get to bake more frequently than we used to. I&#39;m new to this, so I&#39;m not really sure what you mean when you say that your kids can&#39;t have sugar or beef. Even the Feingold diet says sugar itself is rarely the cause of hyperactivity--have you checked this out? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve done your research, but if you gave me more details, I might be able to offer some more suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really trying to look at it in terms of substitution and availability. The key is to allow the kids to make as many of their own choices as they can and to offer as large a range of choices as possible so that they can really exercise that choice. If Sam can&#39;t have Oreos or Fruitloops, yeah that&#39;s a tough break, but he can have lots of other treats. I&#39;m trying to figure out what kinds of treats I *can* have available for him rather than dwelling on all the stuff that we can&#39;t have. For instance, he can&#39;t have Lays potato chips, but he can have Kettle potato chips, so those are down in the snack cart. I&#39;m going to be making as many cookies as I can. They may not be the same cookies that are in all the fancy packaging at the store, but they&#39;re still good and still a treat. If your kids can&#39;t have sugar or one kind of sugar, can they have honey or all-natural maple syrup as a sweetener? See what I&#39;m saying? The treats may not be the same in my house as in someone else&#39;s, but the point is that there are treats available for them to freely choose over other things like carrots or fruit. <br/>
