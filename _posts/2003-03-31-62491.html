<br/>
The Mind at Work<br/>
<br/>
I would be against trying to cram knowledge into the heads of children<br/>
even if we could agree on what knowledge to cram and could be sure that,<br/>
once crammed in, it would stay in. Even then, I would trust the child to<br/>
direct his own learning. For it seems to me a fact that, in our struggle to<br/>
make sense out of life, the things we most need to learn are the things<br/>
we most want to learn. To put this another way, curiosity is hardly ever<br/>
idle. What we want to know, we want to know for a reason. The reason is<br/>
that there is a hole, a gap, an empty space in our understanding of<br/>
things, our mental model of the world. We feel that gap like a hole in a<br/>
tooth and want to fill it up. It makes us ask How? When? Why? While the<br/>
gap is there, we are in tension, in suspense. Listen to the anxiety in a<br/>
person&#39;s voice when he says, &quot;This doesn&#39;t make sense!&quot; When the gap in<br/>
our understanding is filled, we feel pleasure, satisfaction, relief. Things<br/>
make sense again - or at any rate, they make more sense than they did.<br/>
<br/>
When we learn this way, for these reasons, we learn both rapidly and<br/>
permanently. The person who really needs to know something does not<br/>
need to be told many times, drilled, tested. Once is enough. The new piece<br/>
of knowledge fits into the gap ready for it, like a missing piece in a jigsaw<br/>
puzzle. Once in place, it is held in, it can&#39;t fall out. We don&#39;t forget the<br/>
things that make the world a more reasonable or interesting place for us,<br/>
that make our mental model more complete and accurate. Now, if it were<br/>
possible for us to look into the minds of children and see what gaps in<br/>
their mental models most needed filling, a good case could be made for<br/>
giving them the information needed to fill them. But this is not possible.<br/>
We cannot find out what children&#39;s mental models are like, where they are<br/>
distorted, where incomplete. We cannot make direct contact with a<br/>
child&#39;s understanding of the world. Why not? First, because to a very<br/>
considerable extent he is unaware of much of his own understanding. <br/>
Secondly, because he hasn&#39;t the skill to put his understanding into words,<br/>
least of all words that he could be sure would mean to us what they<br/>
meant to him. Thirdly, because we haven&#39;t time. Words are not only a<br/>
clumsy and ambiguous means of communication, they are extraordinarily<br/>
slow. To describe only a very small part of his understanding of the world,<br/>
a man will write a book that takes days to read.<br/>

Unschoolers of Memphis<br/>
<br/>
On a sunny Tuesday afternoon in April, 14 children and five mothers wind<br/>
their way down stone steps and around budding trees, blue woodland phlox<br/>
and yellow wood poppies to the cedar gazebo at Lichterman Nature<br/>
Center in Memphis, Tennessee. They meet here monthly on the third<br/>
Tuesday — a free admission day — to listen to stories told by alternating<br/>
moms and to observe the changing seasons. The outing is planned for<br/>
young children but today includes two teens.<br/>
<br/>
Two-year-old Zoe squeals her delight at riding on the shoulders of one of<br/>
them, Loren, 14. From the gazebo, a few of the bigger boys wander off<br/>
to explore trails while the others settle noisily on the wood floor. Then all<br/>
listen intently as Lynn Carroll-Rivera, mother of three of the children,<br/>
leads songs about spring, teaches a finger game and then tells a story<br/>
about a caterpillar-turned-butterfly who searches for friends. Ravi, age<br/>
five, claps his approval for everything. Next it’s snack time, and as the<br/>
families share the food they’ve brought before hiking to the lake, Carroll-<br/>
Rivera nurses her youngest, 19-month-old Evan.<br/>
<br/>
In many ways today’s outing is school as usual – or &quot;unschool&quot; as usual —<br/>
for these Tennessee families. They’re using free local resources, learning<br/>
from nature, sharing their talents, linking age groups, providing loosely<br/>
structured activities and giving children choices. They are members of<br/>
the Unschoolers of Memphis, a support group that welcomes home<br/>
schoolers of any religion, race, ethnic background or sexual orientation.<br/>
They and about 20 other families come together in large and small<br/>
groups, sometimes several times a week, to learn together. <br/>

Children Learn What They Live<br/>
<br/>
By Dorothy Law Nolte<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with criticism,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to condemn.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with hostility,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to fight.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with ridicule,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to be shy.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with shame,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to feel guilty.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with encouragement,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn confidence.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with tolerance,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to be patient.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with praise,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with acceptance,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to love.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with approval,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to like themselves.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with honesty,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn truthfulness.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with security,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn to have faith in themselves and others.<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with friendliness,<br/>
<br/>
                They learn the world is a nice place in which to live.<br/>

Ideas Come First<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was reading to Eric (who is almost 8) from Bedknob and<br/>
Broomstick. I usually quit at the end of a chapter but decided to end on<br/>
page 124. He said I should put in a bookmark. I said I would remember the<br/>
page number, page 124.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was quiet for a few minutes - we were in his bed and I thought he was<br/>
falling asleep. Then he said, &quot;Did you notice something funny about that<br/>
number, 124? The 2 is two times the 1 and the 4 is two times the 2.&quot; He<br/>
though a bit more and said, &quot;The next number would be 8, then 16, then<br/>
32, then 64, then (a slight hesitation) 128.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought this was the end of it but he added 256 and 512. We have never<br/>
done any math curriculum with him, just everyday math and fun with<br/>
numbers stuff, mostly out loud, because I like that kind of thing and he<br/>
has a natural ability.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another example is from Simon, age 3.5. He was saying words out loud<br/>
and said some that rhymed. He didn&#39;t know the word &quot;rhyme&quot; but was<br/>
getting the concept. He said, &quot;Cat and bat, they&#39;re the same. No, they<br/>
have the same letter.&quot; So I said, the word you want is rhyme. Cat and bat<br/>
rhyme. So now all week he has been finding words that rhyme.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really like the way they figure things out first, or are introduced to the<br/>
thing first, then find or are given names for it. It seemed so often in<br/>
school we were given names for things (&quot;Class, today we are going to<br/>
start Fractions&quot;) and then were taught them, more or less.<br/>

Frogwatch<br/>
<br/>
In recent years, scientists have noticed a disturbing trend among frog<br/>
and toad populations. Throughout the world, amphibians are disappearing<br/>
at an alarming rate. Because frogs have porous skin, they are especially<br/>
sensitive to changes in their environment. They are among the first to<br/>
suffer the consequences of human-caused threats, such as pollution, non-<br/>
native species introduction, impacts from agricultural and development<br/>
projects and increased ultraviolet radiation. As an indicator of greater<br/>
ecosystem health, amphibian population decline raises many concerns<br/>
about the long-term health of our environment.<br/>
<br/>
You can help scientists learn more about trends in U.S. amphibian<br/>
populations by participating in Frogwatch USA. Anyone can participate;<br/>
all you need is an interest in frogs and toads. Volunteers learn about the<br/>
life cycles and calls of local frogs, monitor frogs and toads in local<br/>
wetland areas and submit frog data via the Frogwatch USA website. <br/>

The Last Word<br/>
<br/>
When one learns to trust, to quit fearing the future, fearing that children<br/>
may fail or what others think, it opens the door to a deeper peace and<br/>
joy. When joy is the motivation for behavior, unschooling becomes second<br/>
nature.<br/>
