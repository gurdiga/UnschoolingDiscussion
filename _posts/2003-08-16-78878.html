<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813897684"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I understand what you are saying here, but we both know the reality<br/>
&gt; of the situation is that many religious &quot;unschooling&quot; families do<br/>
&gt; indeed coerce their children in one way or another when it comes to<br/>
&gt; religious matters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This does happen.  Before I go any further, please do realize that I agree<br/>
with you on this point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Somebody posted earlier the Holt dictum of &quot;if<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no question, there&#39;s no teaching&quot;--so what do we call it when<br/>
&gt; parents takes it upon themselves to teach their children the Ten<br/>
&gt; Commandments or the Five Pillars before the children are mature<br/>
&gt; enough to seriously wonder about morality laws for themselves?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand the &quot;no question, no teaching&quot; concept.  But as you point out,<br/>
it&#39;s got a flaw, and that&#39;s the period before children are old enough to do<br/>
the questioning.  I suspect that John Holt was well wise enough to know<br/>
that, and figured that the concept would obviously be applied to the<br/>
appropriate point in a child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps an agnostic might think that the whole mess of faith is far<br/>
complicated to even get into with a young child, and would ignore the whole<br/>
thing until their child is old enough to really consider the issues.  But as<br/>
a person of faith, I don&#39;t see including my child in living my faith as<br/>
coercion.  As I agreed with you above, some people *do* coerce.  Some people<br/>
ignore it completely.  But there&#39;s a non-coercive grey area between those<br/>
two!<br/>
<br/>
I read to my son before he was old enough to ask me to read or not read.  I<br/>
cleaned my house the way I clean, cooked meals the way I like to eat, and in<br/>
general lived my life the way I liked it before he was old enough to have<br/>
opinions on how I live.<br/>
<br/>
I also live my faith in front of him.  I took him to church, in part because<br/>
yes, of course I hoped that he would come to love the ritual and ceremony,<br/>
and come to believe in my God.  I also took him to church because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
leave my child at home in his crib on Sunday mornings!  Like anything else,<br/>
he participates in my life.<br/>
<br/>
Living breeds curiosity.  Far before he was old enough to &quot;seriously wonder<br/>
about morality laws&quot;, he wanted to say the words of the prayers with the<br/>
congregation.  And so he learned them.  Is that indoctrination?  No more<br/>
than him learning to sing the songs I sing, walk the way his daddy walks,<br/>
and eat with a fork.   He&#39;s sharing our lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parents who fervently argue that children should have the freedom to<br/>
&gt; do what they want with their own free time will still think nothing<br/>
&gt; of requiring their children to attend church once a week.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that I think Tim&#39;s old enough yet to consider morality laws<br/>
much (he&#39;s 7), but he doesn&#39;t like church as much these days.  That&#39;s okay,<br/>
he brings a book or paper and pencils.  I don&#39;t like going to the McDonalds<br/>
Playland, either, so I bring a book there.  We have a balance; we try to do<br/>
things we enjoy together, but it&#39;s not always going to happen.  And he&#39;s<br/>
still to young to stay alone.  Is it indoctrination that he must come to<br/>
church with me?  Not in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; From my atheistic viewpoint, I don&#39;t think there should be a<br/>
&gt; religious exception to the &quot;no coercion&quot; rule of unschooling. If a<br/>
&gt; mathematician who insists that his child study an arithmetic book<br/>
&gt; cannot be said to be truly unschooling, then neither can the theist<br/>
&gt; who insists that his child study a holy book. Both are equally guilty<br/>
&gt; in my eyes of coercing the child and meddling with his intellectual<br/>
&gt; freedom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But is the mathmatician who taught his children to play number games with<br/>
him coercing if this is fun for them, together?  Is the person of faith who<br/>
tells Bible stories using character voices and making animal noises<br/>
coercing?  There&#39;s so much grey.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re only speaking of the truly forceful, coercive behaviours that<br/>
exist, and I had the wrong impression.  Please forgive my passion on the<br/>
subject, if I have misunderstood you.  It sounded a bit as though you felt<br/>
that children shouldn&#39;t be subjected to any of thise faith stuff until<br/>
they&#39;re old enough to ask for it.  Obviously, I disagree.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s coercive at all.  It&#39;s  the continuum concept <br/>
idea.  Parents doing their thing and kids joining along naturally.  I <br/>
do know that some parents do more than just living their faith <br/>
naturally.  They get into the &quot;what should I do&quot; parenting style.  I <br/>
used to be like this in almost every area of parenting!  It happens <br/>
when someone wants very much to be the best possible parent but <br/>
doesn&#39;t know how and doesn&#39;t know how to trust her instincts.  She <br/>
then goes out and reads all the advice that all the mainstream <br/>
experts give and tries to do it ALL.  Buy all the right toys and <br/>
books for proper development.  Make sure they get the right amount of <br/>
each food group.  Make sure they have the right amount of <br/>
socialization.  The right amount of doctor visits.  Read to them for <br/>
no less than 20 minutes each night.  Follow a bedtime routine.  I did <br/>
it all.  And because I was so concerned about their relationship with <br/>
God, I thought I had to put extra effort into all the church stuff.   <br/>
I even went as far as rearranging her sleeping schedules so that she <br/>
could go to Sunday evening services.  She used to fall asleep around <br/>
6 in the evening and I got her to take extra naps in the afternoon so <br/>
that she would stay up until 8.  I thought it was important that she <br/>
learn to go to every service, and she wasn&#39;t even a year old yet!  I <br/>
let her cry in the nursery because she &quot;needed to learn to be away <br/>
from me&quot;.  My intentions were really good.  But MAN was I offbase!  <br/>

poeple can&#39;t help but at least passively coerce their children into <br/>
their chosen faith sometimes, even if they don&#39;t mean to. But as I <br/>
just explained in a previous post, that&#39;s just like me passively <br/>
coercing my children into not liking Barney by consciously keeping <br/>
them away from it when they were young. I wouldn&#39;t stop them from <br/>
turning it on themselves, but the very fact that I instead turned on <br/>
Sesame Street during that first year of life probably skewed their <br/>
taste a little bit. Grey areas, like you said. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known many &quot;Christian unschoolers&quot; who limit and censor their <br/>
child&#39;s activities based upon Scripture, essentially forcing their <br/>
child into compliance with the parents&#39; chosen faith and hampering <br/>
the child&#39;s freedom to strike his own spiritual path. That was really <br/>
more of the type of hypocrisy that I was originally referring to. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It sounded a bit as though you felt that children shouldn&#39;t be <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I actually AM of the opinion that children at least should not <br/>
be fed creation stories (and I use that term to mean anything from <br/>
Biblical creation to evolution or whatever) until they ask for it. A <br/>
human will naturally at some point start to wonder about the big <br/>
questions on his own, where we came from and how the earth started <br/>
and all that stuff--offering answers to those questions before your <br/>
child is mature enough to ask them for himself is sort of tainting <br/>
the spiritual path, so to speak. (Just my heathen atheist opinion! <br/>
Agree to disagree, LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a quote from my good friend Henry Lindner:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I say never force children to learn anything outside of their <br/>
necessary duties in the family and home. The child can see and <br/>
understand the need for these tasks.  He cannot see the need to learn <br/>
who George Washington is and what he did, and he will not until he is <br/>
much older and begins to wonder how his society got to be what it <br/>
is.  To force him/her to learn such answers before he can even ask <br/>
the questions is to forever prevent him from ever having any <br/>
curiosity regarding the subject.  To associate knowledge with <br/>
coercion in your child&#39;s mind is one of the worst things you can do <br/>
to him.  Coercion prevents and perverts the child&#39;s <br/>
emotional/intellectual growth. All meaningful learning is the child&#39;s <br/>
own accomplishment. It is initiated and directed by their own <br/>
curiosity.&quot;<br/>
from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~hhlindner/Writings/Natlearn.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~hhlindner/Writings/Natlearn.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
He uses George Washington in this example, but you can just as <br/>
easilty substitute Jesus or Allah or Buddha or whatver you&#39;d like <br/>
instead, it&#39;s the same concept in my eyes.  <br/>

<br/>
Coercion isn&#39;t the same as exposure and &quot;indoctrination,&quot; the word used <br/>
earlier, is a heck of a word.  If Brenda takes Tim to church with her twice a week, <br/>
that doesn&#39;t prove indoctrination.   If she presses him into every class, <br/>
summer camp or workshop she could on the history and future of her faith, maybe.  <br/>
If when he said &quot;Well what do the Presbyterians believe that&#39;s different?&quot; <br/>
she said &quot;Shut up about those stinking Presbyterian devils.  Don&#39;t even ask, and <br/>
if they look at you don&#39;t make eye contact,&quot; NOW we&#39;re talking <br/>
indoctrination!!<br/>
<br/>
I grew up going to a Baptist church in a VERY Catholic town.  I know what <br/>
they told us, and I also know what the catholics were told about the Baptist <br/>
church.  THAT was some indoctrination with threat of hell on both sides for nosing <br/>
around the others.<br/>
<br/>
Indoctrination involves some fear and hatred of outside others.<br/>
If an unschooling family always says &quot;When you&#39;re older you can choose,&quot; and <br/>
they mean it, I don&#39;t see that as indoctrination.   If the parents eat a lot <br/>
of chicken but don&#39;t mind that the kid chooses beef or vegetarian stuff, <br/>
they&#39;re just doing what they do.  If the parents never serve chicken without a <br/>
side-dish of vitriol against beef and against vegetarians, that&#39;s indoctrination.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought indoctrination was something different from what Sandra described.  <br/>
I thought I must be wrong all these years, so I looked it up, in several <br/>
places.  None of the definitions of indoctrination involved fear or hatred of <br/>
outside others.<br/>
<br/>
What I found was what I thought indoctrination was, instilling beliefs or <br/>
doctrines.  Here are some other definitions, none regarding hate or fear.<br/>
<br/>
tr.v. in·doc·tri·nat·ed, in·doc·tri·nat·ing, in·doc·tri·nates <br/>
To instruct in a body of doctrine or principles. <br/>
To imbue with a partisan or ideological point of view: a generation of <br/>
children who had been indoctrinated against the values of their parents    <br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
indoctrination<br/>
<br/>
&#92;In*doc`tri*na&quot;tion&#92;, n. The act of indoctrinating, or the condition of being <br/>
indoctrinated; instruction in the rudiments and principles of any science or <br/>
system of belief; information. --Sir T. Browne.<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
indoctrination<br/>
<br/>
n : teaching someone to accept doctrines uncritically<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    <br/>
While some thing&#39;s one might be getting &quot;indoctrinated&quot; into might involve <br/>
teaching about fear or hatred it isn&#39;t the purpose of indoctrination to instill <br/>
fear or hatred, just instill the &quot;doctrines&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess white supremacist indoctrination&#39;s could very likely instill fear and <br/>
hatred and some others too, but probably a very equal number of things one is <br/>
indoctrinated into most likely would not.<br/>

In the case of religion, it&#39;s one thing to be open-mindedly religious, but <br/>
very few religions are in the business of open-mindedness, and their definitions <br/>

In unschooling discussions, exposure to things is not &quot;indoctrination.&quot;<br/>
So what indoctrination are you recommending that will make unschooling easier <br/>

Or are you just arguing for the sake of arguing?<br/>

someone else. Indoctrination doesn&#39;t describe a condition that&#39;s happened<br/>
inadvertently.<br/>
<br/>
*Why* is this being done to someone?<br/>
<br/>
Why does someone want to teach &quot;someone to accept doctrines uncritically&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Why does someone want &quot;To imbue with a partisan or ideological point of<br/>

<br/>
Someone may indoctrinate for what they feel are positive reasons -- so the<br/>
child can join Jesus, or so the child can learn well in school, for instance<br/>
-- but it won&#39;t be done without fear. (Even if they don&#39;t acknowledge that<br/>
fear.)<br/>
<br/>
It can also be done for power reasons, to control more people.<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of an example of indoctrination that doesn&#39;t have fear that<br/>
something dreadful might happen if the person doesn&#39;t have the knowledge or<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a need to control people by controlling their knowledge?<br/>

used it, LOL!!! And my response to that was something like &quot;IF the <br/>
parent is coercing the child with rewards and punishments, then I <br/>
consider that to be indoctrination.&quot; I never said that any parent who <br/>
keeps a Bible on their shelf is guilty of indoctrination--other <br/>
posters have sort of misread our posts and gone off on this whole <br/>
indoctrination tangent now. <br/>
<br/>
So, let me specifically state it again for the record, I do think <br/>
there is a difference between a parent who simply reads Bible stories <br/>
to their children, and one who uses bribes and threats (i.e., rewards <br/>
and punishments) to obtain religious adherence from a child. Examples <br/>
of this would be, a child who chooses not go to Church services being <br/>
grounded, or a child getting a gold star for every Bible verse she<br/>
memorizes. <br/>
<br/>
The first example of passively reading Bible stories to your child <br/>
may or may not be considered passive coercion, which is what some <br/>
people are currently debating; I do hold that the later examples are <br/>
indeed forms of indoctrination, because they are using extrinsic <br/>
motivators to stifle a child&#39;s intrinsic motivation to find his own <br/>
spritual path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408548199">LOL Look at Glena whipping out the dictionary definition <br/>
for &quot;indoctrination&quot;, I love it! You go girl! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, this brings up an interesting thing about language--<br/>
the difference between denotation and connotation. Words <br/>
can have essentially equal defintions (synonyms!), but markedly <br/>
different connotations. &quot;Overweight&quot; and &quot;fat&quot; have the same <br/>
denotations, but different connotations--one is considered &quot;meaner&quot; <br/>
than the other, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Indoctrination&quot; is one of those words that has gotten a negative <br/>
connoation attached to it. That&#39;s normal language evolution at work <br/>
there. Meanings of words naturally change over time due to historical <br/>
and cultural influences, and good dictionaries (the kind that are <br/>
descriptive rather than prescriptive in their definitions) will keep <br/>
up with these changes in their revised editions.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, over at Dictionary.com, there is no defintion for the <br/>
word &quot;unschooling&quot;, and only this defintion for the word &quot;unschooled&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
un·schooled adj. <br/>
1. Not educated or instructed; having little or no formal schooling. <br/>
2. Not the result of training; natural: &quot;an artist of unschooled <br/>

&gt; unschooling easier and better for anyone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pardon me, but what are you talking about?? I just went back and <br/>
reread her post, and nowhere did she even remotely mention <br/>
recommending an indoctrination that would make unschooling easier, or <br/>
whatever it is that you are trying to accuse her of having said. She <br/>
seemed to be posing a purely semantical question, the way that I read <br/>
it anyway, and I answered her in kind with a little rant about <br/>
denotation versus connotation in language.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or are you just arguing for the sake of arguing?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think she was doing that at all, but regardless, there&#39;s <br/>
nothing inherently wrong with arguing with the sake of arguing. I <br/>
enjoy arguing for the sake of arguing sometimes--it&#39;s good mental <br/>
exercise. 8-)<br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, YOU are quite the master arguing for the sake of arguing <br/>
arguer. I think this post of yours is a prime example of that. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Deniz<br/>
(equally guilty of arguing just for argument&#39;s sake sometimes, LOL. I <br/>
like singing just for singing&#39;s sake too!!)</div>

If it doesn&#39;t lead people to a better understanding of unschooling, I see a <br/>
problem with it happening on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Argue for the sake of arguing all you want at your house anytime.  By private <br/>
e-mail ANYtime!  But people come here to learn more about unschooling, and <br/>
arguments which veer away from that are disruptive.  Disruption of the list is a <br/>
waste of time and energy, and unless we just want a list full of people <br/>
arguing for the sake of arguing, it&#39;s important to veer TOWARD unschooling, rather <br/>
than swirl away from it constantly.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Why* is this being done to someone?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hopefully, because they asked!  If it&#39;s done without their agreement, that&#39;s <br/>
coersion, right?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why does someone want to teach &quot;someone to accept doctrines uncritically&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s easier to learn something if your own messy ideas are out of the <br/>
way first.  Not the way I like to do it, but I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s value.  To put <br/>
aside the preconceived notions and understand something &quot;as it is&quot;.  I think <br/>
that sometimes that is the only way to truly comprehend something.  <br/>
<br/>
After you comprehend something, the critical questions can enlarge your <br/>
understanding, but in the beginning, those critical questions can subvert your <br/>
understanding, instead. <br/>
<br/>
 I know that&#39;s not a great argument for unschooling, but I think it&#39;s true.  <br/>
Isn&#39;t that why we think it&#39;s great when people read the list for a while, get <br/>
an understanding of what&#39;s going on first, before they jump in?  Maybe suspend <br/>
their ideas for a while and absorb ours, and they&#39;ll better understand than <br/>
if they started arguing right away?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why does someone want &quot;To imbue with a partisan or ideological point of<br/>
view&quot;?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In religion in particular, it&#39;s because there is a belief system, dogma, <br/>
things that are true and right within that religion, and things that are not.  If <br/>
I ,a libertarian dem, want to understand republicanism, I can&#39;t do it without <br/>
looking at if from their ideological pov.  There are things I need to &quot;accept <br/>
as correct&quot; before I can go further into their ideology.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It can also be done for power reasons, to control more people.<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of an example of indoctrination that doesn&#39;t have fear that<br/>
something dreadful might happen if the person doesn&#39;t have the knowledge or<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a need to control people by controlling their knowledge?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, when people choose to learn all about a certain religion, aren&#39;t they <br/>
purposely letting themselves be indoctrinated?  Aren&#39;t they learning about an <br/>
entire system of belief, and don&#39;t they have to suspend their own beliefs while <br/>
they do so?  Is that controlling their knowledge, or is that just a method of <br/>
absorbing a different pov?  <br/>
<br/>
The difference I see is that you are assuming a person of power to be <br/>
coercing another person...but indoctrination seems to me to be a complete immersion <br/>
in any complete belief system, and that can be done by choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t people here being indoctrinated in the process of unschooling?  Aren&#39;t <br/>
we purposely learning an entire system of belief, and aren&#39;t we sometimes <br/>
putting aside some of our own beliefs and opinions about things in order to <br/>
understand unschooling better?  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I just see it more as an immersion into a subject, but not <br/>
necessarily a brainwashing.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To instruct in a body of doctrine or principles. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That first definition.  Your kid wants to learn Judiasm.  What would the <br/>
rabbi do?  Indoctrinate, teach a body of doctrine.  <br/>
<br/>
The connotation of the word does trigger the cults and fundies of the world, <br/>
where power and coercion are used TO indoctrinate. <br/>
<br/>
Whew.  I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m &quot;arguing&quot; this side of the conversation.  But this <br/>
is just way too interesting!  LOL  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here we&#39;re getting into judgement and discernment, and making clear that <br/>
difference  would probably be useful here.  <br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re discerning, deciding on a basis of judgement, yes, but not assigning <br/>
that preference as having inherant value, then we don&#39;t have to be *against* <br/>
it&#39;s opposite.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand your point, but your whole post is based on the fact that you <br/>
have to hate somebody to love another, and that&#39;s just not true!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;it&#39;s one thing to be open-mindedly religious, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible.  You either are of the same belief as the <br/>
dogma of your religion,  or you are not that religion, you&#39;re a spiritual person <br/>
on a path that has similarities to that religion.  You can be open-mindedly <br/>
spirtual, no dogma, that&#39;s different.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;very few religions are in the business of open-mindedness, and their <br/>
definitions <br/>
of other religions are frequently of the basest kinds of judgements. That <br/>
means hatred &gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
This may be a mistake that many people make, but that doesn&#39;t mean that all <br/>
religious people are this way.  Some people are so comfortable with their <br/>
religion they have no need to hate those who are of another religion.    It&#39;s <br/>
called religious tolerance.  <br/>
<br/>
 It happens.  There&#39;s a whole website about it.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/">http://www.religioustolerance.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;n : teaching someone to accept doctrines uncritically&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Uncritically&quot; means &quot;without thinking.&quot;<br/>
It means &quot;trust me.&quot;<br/>
It means &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re SURE this is right and the other stuff is <br/>
wrong.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is very often true.  But as I explained in my other post, teaching and <br/>
learning something so inflexible as religion, does have at it&#39;s base things <br/>
like faith, grace, etc, and you just can&#39;t understand some religions without <br/>
suspending disbelief, without putting aside critical, rational thinking and <br/>
questioning.  It&#39;s just part of the process.  Now, some people can&#39;t and won&#39;t do <br/>
this, and that&#39;s why we have agnostics and athiests.  :-) <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In unschooling discussions, exposure to things is not &quot;indoctrination.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure it is.  Just not the nasty brainwashing, coersive connotation.  <br/>
<br/>
When your kid sits down to read a science book, they&#39;re interested in being <br/>
indoctrinated into the system of understanding that is called science.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t understand what some of the basis&#39; are, they&#39;re not going to have as <br/>
full of an understanding as they would otherwise.  But when they&#39;re exposed <br/>
enough to science, they become indoctrinated, or immersed in the systems and <br/>
terminology of science.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So what indoctrination are you recommending that will make unschooling <br/>
easier <br/>
and better for anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Any kind the kid wants works for me.  <br/>

&gt; to the question of whether creation stories are crap or not. You<br/>
&gt; should know the answer to that if I admitted to you that I&#39;m an<br/>
&gt; atheist. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t asking for your personal opinion of creation stories.  I was<br/>
pointing out the flaw in your comments.  So, once again, how does your<br/>
opinion on religion help me (or anybody else, for that matter) unschool?  It<br/>
sounded like you were telling people that it would be better for unschoolers<br/>
(in general) to not teach children any of &quot;that crap&quot; until they ask.  That<br/>
might be true for your kids, if that&#39;s how you feel about it.  But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it worth telling the rest of us.  Or, if you feel the need to<br/>
tell the rest of us, tell it as a story about your family.  Not as advice<br/>
for how we should all unschool.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, why is it that with some people, every time you disagree with<br/>
&gt; them about one particular point or another, they assume that you<br/>
&gt; either<br/>
&gt; a. must not &quot;get&quot; the unschooling concept<br/>
&gt; b. don&#39;t have kids of your own<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not &quot;some people&quot;, I&#39;m Brenda.  And need not get defensive.  You may go<br/>
back and read my posts; I neither said nor implied that you didn&#39;t get<br/>
unschooling.  I didn&#39;t assume you don&#39;t have kids, I asked if you do.  I had<br/>
a reason for asking.  Thank you for answering.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; c. are only talking about theoretical/hypothetical situations (and if<br/>
&gt; you do indeed happen to be doing just that, that is useless)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t &quot;assume&quot; that you were talking about theory, I asked.  There&#39;s a<br/>
big difference.  Breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Theory isn&#39;t useless.  But it&#39;s courteous to call a spade as spade.  If my<br/>
child is sick, I want tried-and-true advice.  It can come from the medical<br/>
establishment, it can come from the homeopath, it can come from other<br/>
parents.  But I want to know what will WORK.  The last thing I&#39;d want is an<br/>
untested theory.  Theory is fine.  But please tell me that&#39;s what you&#39;re<br/>
selling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a. I am an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s nice.  We&#39;re not here to judge each other.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; b. I have kids. Two beautiful children so far, probably will be<br/>
&gt; having more soon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Congratulations.  How old are they?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; c1. Yes, I HAVE heard very young children ask deeply profound<br/>
&gt; questions about life, the universe, and everything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So have I.  But I&#39;ve also heard those same young children regularly ask much<br/>
more simple questions, and in general find that children prefer that you<br/>
answer the question.  Just the question.  Now, my son will occasionally tell<br/>
me he wants the &quot;whole story&quot;.  But generally, long, philosophical answers<br/>
are not what he&#39;s asking for.  Like all children, he&#39;s often fishing for<br/>
information (who was George Washington?) not seeking a discussion of the<br/>
history of America.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; c2. I find nothing wrong with exploring theoreticals and<br/>
&gt; hypotheticals, they can be very useful tools when not used too<br/>
&gt; randomly. Imagining different possibilities, testing out<br/>
&gt; logical arguments to see if lead to an illogical conclusion, thinking<br/>
&gt; ahead about future events, etc...it&#39;s all good to me. That&#39;s fine if<br/>
&gt; you personally aren&#39;t interested in theoreticals...I am.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m interested in theory, but not the way you&#39;re going about it.  As far as<br/>
this list goes, I&#39;m interested in real people&#39;s lives and their experience<br/>
unschooling.  As I attempted to explain above, *advice* based on<br/>
theoreticals is worthless.  Tell me if you have actually lived this.  And<br/>
don&#39;t try to tell me how to live if you have never been there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure anyone who&#39;s been on this list for more than a few months knows<br/>
that my son is seven years old.  That&#39;s because I try HARD to include his<br/>
age in my comments.  To someone who has a five year old, my experiences may<br/>
yield something useful.  But the parent of a twelve year old won&#39;t<br/>
necessarily find my comments useful.  Age does make a difference.  I greatly<br/>
appreciate advice from some of the more experienced unschoolers on this<br/>
list, because I know that they have stood where I&#39;m standing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; your friend (and you, me thinks) has great expectations of<br/>
&gt;&gt; children&#39;s interest in philosophical questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re right, we do. Guilty as charged.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how has that expectation played out in your own children&#39;s lives?  Are<br/>
they old enough to bear up your theories?  I am neither a mathmetician nor a<br/>
scientist, but I do remember (from school, no less) that not all theories<br/>
turn out to be true.<br/>
<br/>
So, how old are your children?  Have you found that as they grow older, they<br/>
are starting to ask probing questions, or are they still two years old and<br/>
asking, &quot;What&#39;s that&quot; more often than not?  Tell us stories about how your<br/>
theories play out in real life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So you&#39;re using the word indoctrinate to describe a step in understanding<br/>
and not an end in itself.<br/>
<br/>
But I think if we were to describe the process of learning about unschooling<br/>
(or anything) as &quot;First you need to indoctrinate yourself and then you can<br/>
ask questions,&quot; that it would give many people the wrong image to work<br/>
towards.<br/>
<br/>
The first part of learning is often gathering *data* uncritically. That&#39;s<br/>
not accepting the truth of any principles uncritically. Once there&#39;s enough<br/>
data, then people can start to see patterns and draw conclusions about why<br/>
those patterns exist.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t see gathering data as:<br/>
<br/>
To instruct in a body of doctrine or principles.<br/>
To imbue with a partisan or ideological point of view<br/>
Instruction in the rudiments and principles of any science or system of<br/>
belief<br/>
Teaching someone to accept doctrines uncritically<br/>
<br/>
since data isn&#39;t principles or doctines.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Isn&#39;t that why we think it&#39;s great when people read the list for a while, get<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still see that as gathering data so people have something to base<br/>
conclusions about how they should behave on.<br/>
<br/>
To me &quot;instruct in a body of doctrine or principles&quot; is akin to memorizing<br/>
them. There are no unschooling principles to memorize.<br/>
<br/>
There *are* though principles that we do accept as true because we&#39;ve<br/>
*already* done the critical examination and have come to those conclusions.<br/>
The list and message board exist as places to explore what life is like when<br/>
those unschooling principles are accepted as true.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that people can&#39;t question whether children do learn all they need<br/>
to learn by living life, or whether conventional parenting is better than<br/>
mindful parenting, but they need to do so softly so it doesn&#39;t stop the list<br/>
from serving the needs of those who accept the unschooling principles and<br/>
signed on to work towards unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As an analogy, many priests wouldn&#39;t discourage and might even encourage<br/>
someone who wants to question the divinity of Christ. But the priest (and<br/>
parishoners) wouldn&#39;t want the person interupting the church services to get<br/>
the priest to prove the divinity of Christ. The service exists to serve the<br/>
vast majority who already accept the divinity of Christ. The priest probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to spend hours a day in private discussing the divinity of<br/>
Christ. The priest would expect the person to do the majority of the work on<br/>
their own and to use the priest to help clarify some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Though understanding the foundation of a particular religion&#39;s dogma can be<br/>
helpful to people, I think they can also work just fine for people who don&#39;t<br/>
want to question, who just want to believe.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooling will work for those who just want to accept. I<br/>
think people need to understand why it works in order to decide how to make<br/>
it work in their families.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Why does someone want &quot;To imbue with a partisan or ideological point of<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Almost. You need to accept as correct *from their point of view*. And then<br/>
work to understand their point of view in order to understand why they<br/>
believe what they believe.<br/>
<br/>
It does mean turning off your own point of view and preconceived notions in<br/>
order to understand. But it doesn&#39;t mean letting your own understanding go.<br/>
<br/>
I find that process fascinting and have tried to describe it to some people<br/>
who are fighting what we&#39;re saying. Some people seem to naturally resist<br/>
taking on that temporary set of beliefs and temporary point of view and<br/>
temporary new truths. But I find it fascinating -- and very helpful -- to<br/>
try to understand why people believe what they believe. I find<br/>
fundamentalist Christian thinking fascinating. I&#39;ve been able to better<br/>
understand why they believe what they do by trying on their point of view.<br/>
But I&#39;m not in the least bit &quot;indoctrinated&quot; into their beliefs. My own<br/>
beliefs haven&#39;t changed at all just because I&#39;ve tried on theirs.<br/>
<br/>
To me indoctrination is done *to* someone. It is done to meet *the<br/>
indoctrinator&#39;s* needs. The people being indoctrinated may feel it&#39;s meeting<br/>
their needs. They may even want the indoctrination. But to me the big<br/>
difference between indoctrination and learning is that the indoctrinator has<br/>
a driving need to get someone (or many someones) to believe. And whether<br/>
they understand or not is irrelevant (and perhaps dangerous to the<br/>
indoctrinator&#39;s goals.)<br/>
<br/>
Being indoctrinated and learning something they want to learn may look and<br/>
feel similar to the people drawing in the information. But there is no<br/>
pressure from the people handing out the information for anyone to<br/>
understand. No one offering advice has anything big to gain whether there<br/>
are 100 people or 10,000 people here who understand -- not just believe --<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but indoctrination seems to me to be a complete immersion<br/>
&gt; in any complete belief system, and that can be done by choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe that&#39;s where connotation and denotation come in. I think there are<br/>
words that describe that immersive learning -- like &quot;learning&quot; ;-) -- but<br/>
people need a word that describes learning when the person handing out the<br/>
information has a vested interest in the learner believing them. Not just in<br/>
learning what they&#39;re teaching, but in believing what they&#39;re being taught<br/>
and disbelieving contradictory modes of thought. The needs of that type of<br/>
teacher are different than the needs of the teacher who leaves it up to the<br/>
student to believe or not believe, to understand or not understand.<br/>
<br/>
Indoctrination serves that word need and that&#39;s how it&#39;s very often used.<br/>

the words of some fundamentalist who have come to accept that, devastating<br/>

child believe. Most fundamentalists aren&#39;t that comfortable. To many people,<br/>
believing, regardless of the method of getting someone to believe, is way<br/>
more important than examining and questioning. That the parents believe is<br/>
enough. Questioning can to lead to useless and mistaken doubt so it isn&#39;t a<br/>
chance they see worth taking for their child.<br/>

Most people whose religion have horrible consequences for the nonbeliever<br/>
are *not* religiously tolerant. They don&#39;t have that luxury.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When your kid sits down to read a science book, they&#39;re interested in being<br/>
&gt; indoctrinated into the system of understanding that is called science.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How is that different than learning? If you&#39;re using a special word to<br/>
describe the process, then there must be some important difference from<br/>
learning that you&#39;re trying to help people understand.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that we can argue the definition of indoctrinate, but will<br/>
using that word help someone unschool or understand unschooling better? Will<br/>
describing the learning process a kid might do when immersing themselves in<br/>
a subject as indoctrination help someone better understand unschooling and<br/>
how to go about it? Or will it make it more confusing to many people? Will<br/>
describing the learning process people need to do in order to get<br/>
unschooling, make it easier to understand the process if it&#39;s described as<br/>
indoctrination? Or more difficult for some people?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;In unschooling discussions, exposure to things is not &quot;indoctrination.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So why use a word when helping people to unschool that some might interpret<br/>
as the &quot;nasty brainwashing, coersive&quot; kind? Clarity is important. We&#39;re<br/>
trying to help people unschool, not make it more difficult by using words<br/>

wasn&#39;t interested in being indoctrinated into the system of understanding that is <br/>

Anyway, I can&#39;t indoctrinate myself, and a book can&#39;t indoctrinate me.  <br/>
Someone with a mind and a will would have to do the indoctrination.  <br/>

some second-generation homeschoolers here. I&#39;d definitely be willing <br/>
to bet that out of 1200 people, not everyone went to U.S. public <br/>

to private schools here may not in fact know all of the specific <br/>
horrors of the PS system that those of us who did suffer through it <br/>
know all too well.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, we&#39;ve read books, but we don&#39;t all read the same books, and <br/>
I for one certainly don&#39;t know every single author out there and <br/>
always appreciate getting a tip on a new &quot;find&quot; that I hadn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
In the absence of a more specific group description, it seems that <br/>
certain people feel they have the right to dictate what is and is <br/>
not &quot;on-topic&quot;. I personally think that unschooling is simply living <br/>
life, and therefore anything and everything that one thinks and <br/>
learns is a relevant thing to discuss. But that&#39;s just my opinion, <br/>
and I&#39;m in no more of a position to dictate such things either <br/>

Language and algebra are interesting.  Long tirades about school are less <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re another one who is insisting that we should all just stick <br/>

 <br/>
And who says that I&#39;m trying to dispense advice for how &quot;everyone&quot; <br/>
should unschool? That&#39;s not my goal at all. I really am in no <br/>
position to offer useful advice to deeply religious unschoolers, <br/>
because I fundamentally disagree with them on so many issues that <br/>
you&#39;re right, my &quot;advice&quot; is probably pretty worthless to them. I&#39;m a <br/>
philosopher, and I have my own opinions that you are free to agree or <br/>
disagree with as you see fit. I&#39;m always happy to ponder, discuss, <br/>
debate, and argue with anyone about anything, but I&#39;m not a guidance <br/>
counselor. I can only show others the paths that I have chosen to <br/>
take and explain why I chose those paths and share whatever knowledge <br/>
I have that helped me come to those conclusions, and hope that all of <br/>
that enlightens and inspires some others too; I don&#39;t expect everyone <br/>
to agree with me though, or even care about what I have to say, LOL.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not &quot;some people&quot;, I&#39;m Brenda.  And need not get defensive.  <br/>
&gt; You may go back and read my posts; I neither said nor implied that <br/>
&gt; you didn&#39;t get unschooling.  I didn&#39;t assume you don&#39;t have kids, I <br/>
&gt; asked if you do.  I had a reason for asking.  Thank you for <br/>
&gt; answering.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reason I said &quot;some people&quot; is precisely because my rant was NOT <br/>
directed specifically at you. I know that you personally didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; <br/>
a, b, AND c, LOL...that rant was based on my observations of the list <br/>
as a whole, and was based upon comments made by several different <br/>
people to several different other people, not just you to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I didn&#39;t &quot;assume&quot; that you were talking about theory, I asked.  <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a big difference.  Breathe.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, you didn&#39;t merely innocently ask &quot;are you talking about theory?&quot;--<br/>
you specifically colored that question by adding &quot;because what you&#39;re <br/>
talking about here sounds like theory, not real life.&quot; You seemed to <br/>
be implying that if you were not all-out assuming, you were certainly <br/>
at least leaning towards one opinion over another, quite different <br/>
than asking a question with no preconceived notions about the answer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; a. I am an unschooler.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s nice.  We&#39;re not here to judge each other.<br/>

I&#39;ve been a lurker long enough to have witnessed many, many, MANY <br/>
instances of various members of this group judging various other <br/>
members of this group, on a quite regular basis.<br/>

Sometimes I really get the feeling that you just skim through <br/>

who have kids who want to go to/go back to public school, or who are <br/>
having doubts about unschooling and are thinking about putting their <br/>

them, hearing &quot;long tirades about school&quot; will help them to finally <br/>
get off that fence and realize once and for all how horrible the PS <br/>
system is. <br/>
<br/>
You seem to be willing to help only those who have already made a <br/>
full-on commitment to unschool, and less tolerant of those who are <br/>
still having doubts or haven&#39;t dove in wholeheatedly yet. It&#39;s easy <br/>

&gt; topics tie in with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Again, that&#39;s just your opinion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You seem to be willing to help only those who have already made a <br/>
<br/>
full-on commitment to unschool,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it&#39;s an unschooling list.  Not a <br/>
vaguely-thinking-about-homeschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s easy <br/>
<br/>
to preach to a choir&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have no interest in teaching the music to non-singers who didn&#39;t even come <br/>
into the church.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;it much harder to &quot;meet people where they are&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and help them get over their doubts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably so.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m meeting people on an unschooling list.  Those who don&#39;t come here, I <br/>
don&#39;t hunt them down.  I get e-mail from people with all KINDS of problems, and I <br/>
try to point them toward places where they can get more than one opinion <br/>
regarding their particular &quot;place&quot; and concern.  I never send anyone to this list <br/>
who isn&#39;t really interested in unschooling.  There are many more general places <br/>
to send them.<br/>
