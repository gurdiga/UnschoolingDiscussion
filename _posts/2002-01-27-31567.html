<div id="ygrps-yiv-65358164">Oh, Dawn!<br/>
PLEASE run to your library and get Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn!<br/>
Perhaps the short term result is that you and the Suzuki lady get to control<br/>
your son&#39;s behavior....but in the long run his love of playing an instrument<br/>
will be damaged!<br/>
        While you&#39;re at the library,  check out John Holt&#39;s Learning All the<br/>
Time and read his comments on the Suzuki music program in the U.S.A.<br/>
Susan....about ready to make a comeback after my e-sabbatical.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little afraid to put my 2 cents in here, but what the heck!  My son is<br/>
in<br/>
a Suzuki piano program, and it is incredibly rewards based.  I was a bit<br/>
concerned at first, but have decided that if it works, it works.  His<br/>
teacher<br/>
assigns certain pieces to practice on a take home sheet.  He gets a check<br/>
mark<br/>
for each day that he practices each piece.  When he reaches 100 check marks<br/>
(usually every other week if he is diligent), he gets a candy bar or<br/>
something<br/>
else from her drawer full of dollar store treasures.  He is also assigned a<br/>
&quot;candy bar piece&quot; from time to time, and earns a trip to the wonderful<br/>
drawer<br/>
of treasures for playing it flawlessly.  This keeps his practicing.  He has<br/>
discovered in the course of his five months of lessons that there is an<br/>
additional reward of learning to play well, but I&#39;m sure that without the<br/>
incentives, the practicing would stop or slow down.  This system is geared<br/>
toward the five and six year old students. Certainly there is some way to<br/>
tailor this to an older child if you really would like to encourage her to<br/>
practice.  So many check marks gets a video rental or a trip to the mall, or<br/>
whatever else works for you.  There is incentive to practice but no<br/>
punishment<br/>
for not practicing.  It is like the poker chip game we used to play with our<br/>
son when he was four and going through an &quot;unruly&quot; phase.  :o)  Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You know...I think that being able to play music by ear is so much<br/>
&gt; more important (not sure if that is the right word, but it is the only<br/>
&gt; one coming to me right now) then reading music. Anyone can be taught to<br/>
&gt; read music. It is the ear to hear the pitches and the feeling that is<br/>
&gt; important.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s a balance.  Too many people (especially classically-trained<br/>
musicians) never learn to hear and play by ear.<br/>
<br/>
But if you can only play things that you&#39;ve heard (that somebody else has<br/>
already played), then you miss something, too.<br/>

I don&#39;t know,  I guess for me, I have the CD, I&#39;ve really enjoyed it, because I am not familiar with that music.  And then it has opened my mind to different kinds.   I want to look into those old songs and hear the traditional ones too.   Even if it just exposes this music to others who havn&#39;t ever heard it,  isn&#39;t that good?  I just love the song with the people walking to the water,  to me its just beautiful.<br/>

And aren&#39;t those interpretations just artists putting their own creative spin on things?<br/>

<br/>
Sure, I suppose.  Kirby went ape-crazy for that music, and I said &quot;I know <br/>
that stuff.&quot;  He liked me better, for a while. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Walking to the water...<br/>
The song is Down TO the river to pray, not &quot;down IN the river...&quot; and it <br/>
makes a difference.  Maybe only to me. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And aren&#39;t those interpretations just artists putting their own creative <br/>
spin on things?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure. <br/>
<br/>
I like (and collect, just kinda casually) versions of the traditional piece <br/>
of art of the guardian angel and the children on the bridge.  It&#39;s not often <br/>
JUST the same, but that&#39;s one piece that has been passed on for a long time, <br/>
painters making them as gifts for their children, or relatives, and making <br/>
the kids look like particular kids, or whatever.  The angel changes.  The <br/>
bridge changes.  The background changes.  But there is such a far as would be <br/>
TOO far from being still &quot;it,&quot; still being the identifying motif.<br/>
<br/>
Same with folk music.  Yes, there&#39;s a range of acceptable variation, but <br/>
there&#39;s also an out-of-bounds.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I understand your point, but I guess I am also glad that it has come to me <br/>
in this way, which is better than it not ever coming to me at all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree, but still wish they had taken a moment in those meetings to say <br/>
&quot;This will be some people&#39;s first introduction to this old-timey music.  <br/>
Since we love it ourselves, don&#39;t we want to make it a priority that they get <br/>
the best possible samples?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90987979">We also love the soundtrack to &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot;. Along with the <br/>
movie, which we all (kids included) thought was hillarious! The kids sing <br/>
along with all the songs. My favorite ones on the album are of Allison Crause <br/>
(sp?). I love the traditional way she sings and plays the violin (fiddle). We <br/>
(dh and I both) come from very musical families. My dh more so however, his <br/>
sister has one of the most beautiful voices the world would ever hear. Only <br/>
she hasn&#39;t shared her gift with the rest of the world (which we all feel that <br/>
she is letting it down, by not sharing). Our daughter Caila (11 1/2) loves to <br/>
sing. She will sing just about every chance she gets. She also sings very <br/>
well for her age, not just saying that because I am her proud mama. My <br/>
children listen to all kinds of music, from just about anything you can think <br/>
of. Some of it I can&#39;t stand, but will not keep it from my children (unless <br/>
of course I disapprove of what the lyrics are). I want my kids to have the <br/>
same thrill of hearing a new song from someone they really like, or hearing <br/>
some new type of music they have never heard before. We all share in the joy <br/>
of music. We are thinking about either buying or renting some instruments for <br/>
them to learn to play. Even if they don&#39;t stick with it, at least they tried <br/>
something new.<br/>
  Shellie, third year homeschooler, thinking about unschooling......kind of <br/>
scared of it though. However, sadly my dd wants to go to jr high for 7th <br/>
grade....dh wants me to let her, I said ok. But felt pressured to do so. I <br/>
know that I should allow her the freedom to try it, but I am scared of all <br/>
the things that are going on in ele., jr high, and highschool.</div>

they wanted to capture the &quot;feeling&quot;.<br/>

&gt; with both cello and horn that the only time I practice is when I&#39;ve got<br/>
&gt; something coming up, a chamber group or orchestra rehearsal or whatever.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s because there&#39;s very little music written for either instrument<br/>
&gt; *alone*.  I could be working on solo accompanied music.  I have a friend who<br/>
&gt; plays piano really well.  But I just don&#39;t.<br/>

Play anything that&#39;s lying around.  Hymns, songs, musicals, whatever.  But<br/>
if you feel the need for &quot;proper&quot; unaccompanied cello music, I have a pile<br/>
about a foot high.  Email me off list sometime and tell me what you like,<br/>
and I can make some suggestions.  There really is scads of stuff, and a fair<br/>
amount of it is really nice without being stunningly hard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, I&#39;ll take you up on it.  Thanks.  The only stuff I know about is the<br/>
Bach Suites.  I like baroque, classic, romantic, most anything but the<br/>
really weird modern stuff.  Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t gotten comfortable with<br/>
tenor clef yet, and that leaves out a lot.  And while I can read treble clef<br/>
just fine, I have trouble playing much up that high on the cello.  Bring on<br/>
the suggestions!<br/>
