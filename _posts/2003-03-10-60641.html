<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I met a young man, Jeff Chandler, at a<br/>
workshop on counseling conscientious objecters. He<br/>
received detention for hanging posters in his high<br/>
school, Olean High School. The posters, copied on<br/>
regular copy paper, had a peace sign in the middle<br/>
with messages surrounding it: pro-peace, anti-war,<br/>
give peace a chance, etc.  Jeff had asked teachers if<br/>
they objected to him hanging posters near their rooms<br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
The administration of the school has given Jeff<br/>
detention for hanging the posters. You can call or<br/>
write the school at the following addresses/numbers:<br/>
Olean High School <br/>
410 West Sullivan Street<br/>
Olean NY 14760<br/>
Principal:<br/>
Barbara Lias<br/>
716-375-8012<br/>
<br/>
Vice Principal:<br/>
Jeffrey Andreano (I believe this is the guy who<br/>
punished Jeff with detention)<br/>
716-375-8028<br/>
<br/>
Jeff is asking that people complain that his rights<br/>
have been infringed, not that they demand that he be<br/>
released from detention. He is looking forward to<br/>
sitting in the detention hall making more posters.<br/>
<br/>
At the same meeting, I met a teen from Newfield High<br/>
School who will be serving detention for his<br/>
participation in the walk-out last week. Newfield has<br/>
assigned detention to all students who were involved.<br/>
<br/>
Pass this on, please. Students have virtually no<br/>
rights in public schools. Time to change that.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012927071">Does the school have a rule that you cannot hang posters? Or just<br/>
certain types of posters? The situation sounds bizarre.<br/>
