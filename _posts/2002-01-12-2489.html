<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980054906">OK, I have a question for you. I want to<br/>
rewrite something that is in the<br/>
Program for the Southern California/Nevada<br/>
LLL Conference.   This is what it says now...<br/>
<br/>
DISCREET BREASTFEEDING<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that we share the Hilton<br/>
Hotel with others who may not be<br/>
as familiar with breastfeeding children as we<br/>
are.  Pay extra attention to<br/>
modesty as a gesture of respect for others<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
At the meeting yesterday, I noted that when I<br/>
read the above at my first<br/>
conference I was offended at people telling<br/>
me how to breastfeed.  We<br/>
discussed and the decision was made that we<br/>
shoudl change the heading to<br/>
something diferent, like &quot;respectful behavior<br/>
or something like that.  I don&#39;t<br/>
like that either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the idea would be to say something<br/>
like...<br/>
<br/>
Please remember that as a Conference Attendee<br/>
you represent LLL to others in<br/>
the hotel who may have limited or no<br/>
knowledge of LLL and breastfeeding.  Let<br/>
us all show our best sides, da da da da,<br/>
nurse discreetly, da da da da, keep<br/>
our kids from running and screaming down the<br/>
hotel isles da da da da, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Please?  I don&#39;t like this at<br/>
all.  I&#39;d rather not put anything in, but it<br/>
is not I who makes these decisions.  So tell<br/>
me what you think and I will have some<br/>
ammunition to take with me to tomorrow&#39;s<br/>
meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

I think that says it pretty succinctly.<br/>

The second sentence could be tightened up.  I don&#39;t think it should be <br/>
considered a &quot;gesture&quot; of respect, but should be ACTUAL respect for others&#39; <br/>

&lt;&lt; But Sandra, don&#39;t you find this comment, this<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
I nursed three babies in public, for many years, and never flashed tit at <br/>
anyone.  No reason to. I had nursing clothes and blankets and more often than <br/>
not people didn&#39;t even know the baby was nursing, just thought it was <br/>
sleeping or snuggling.<br/>
<br/>
Since it&#39;s easy to be modest, why can&#39;t people do it?  Since there are more <br/>
people who will be disturbed than won&#39;t if women are flopping boobs our in a <br/>
hotel lobby, those people have a right to their peace.  <br/>
<br/>
There will be rooms in/of the conference which are not public, where there <br/>
are lectures and workshops and such, where everyone there is LLL, and then it <br/>
won&#39;t matter.  <br/>
<br/>
It will do nothing to promote breastfeeding in public for people to be <br/>
blatantly blatant about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s not always easy, first off. You said you nursed babies - maybe<br/>
it&#39;s when the kids get beyond baby that it&#39;s harder, I don&#39;t know. Cacie<br/>
hated having anything over her head from the first, so that wasn&#39;t gonna<br/>
happen. I think for women with very large or very small breasts, it can<br/>
be harder.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; It will do nothing to promote breastfeeding in public for people to <br/>
&gt; be  blatantly blatant about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone wants women stripping to the waist to nurse in<br/>
public. OTOH, sometimes the toddler is wiggly, and some midruff shows.<br/>
Sometimes the preschooler pops off to say hi to a friend, and for a few<br/>
second your nipple is out in plain view. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s being<br/>
&quot;blatant&quot; so much as not being &quot;discreet&quot;. I&#39;m discreet when I pull my<br/>
underwear up in public, or tell someone she has broccoli between her<br/>
teeth. Those things are kind of embarrassing. Nursing my kid is  not. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Joylyn, too, that it&#39;s kind of insulting to be told<br/>
something like this - sort of feeds right into the stereotype that LLLers<br/>
are lacto-maniacs who love to expose their boobs everywhere. I&#39;m sure<br/>
they exist, although I&#39;ve never met one and I&#39;ve hung with a LLL crowd<br/>
since the seventies, on and off... I don&#39;t know anyone who is out to make<br/>
others feel *un*comfortable, but my comfort and my child&#39;s is more<br/>
important than some fuddy duddy getting upset because he glimpsed my<br/>
areola., IMNSHO.<br/>
<br/>
There was a time when women were told to &quot;discreetly&quot; cover their ankles<br/>
and wrists at all times, too...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really into &quot;promoting&quot; stuff. I just do it.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve nursed two and three year olds.  And by the time they&#39;re that old you <br/>
can tell them that if you&#39;re going to do it at that particular place and time <br/>
you&#39;re going to need to be covered up some.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know anyone who is out to make<br/>

areola., IMNSHO.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is to you and your child, but if he&#39;s rented an expensive hotel room he <br/>
has a right to some peace.   And the difference between &quot;fuddy duddy&quot; and <br/>
righteous zeal is which side of the eyes you&#39;re on, probably.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There was a time when women were told to &quot;discreetly&quot; cover their ankles<br/>

<br/>
So do you think we&#39;re building up to nekkid twats?  <br/>
Is it just the slippery slope?  <br/>
<br/>
(If not, I don&#39;t see real the connection between ankles and boobs.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really think the issue may be that many moms feel so surrounded by LLL and<br/>
acceptance that they really don&#39;t realize there are other, unrelated, people<br/>
in the hotel who may not be used to the openness women feel at their local<br/>
meetings.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the point the original phrasing made clearly, and I do think <br/>
some moms will need the reminder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999684761">All of you have written so many good thoughts.  Thank you.  I think I&#39;m<br/>
probably more confused then ever about my feelings on this.  I&#39;d read<br/>
each post and say &#39;yeah, that&#39;s right.&quot; And then I&#39;d read the next post,<br/>
which would completely disagree witht he prior one, and I&#39;d say &#39;no,<br/>
that&#39;s right.&quot;  sigh.  Not sure what the right answer is, but I do<br/>
believe that what ever it is, it is certainly worth bringing it up for<br/>
discussion at the Conference meeting tomorrow.  Thank you all for your<br/>
wisdom.  And if you get this note tonight or first thing in the am, and<br/>
want ot write more, please do.  The meeting isn&#39;t until 10:00 am<br/>
California time, and also the program book doesn&#39;t go to print until<br/>
March, so there is still plenty of time to hash this issue out.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I&#39;d get good and varied opinions here. Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
At a conference, there are conference rooms (which aren&#39;t public) and hotel <br/>
rooms (ditto), and I would rather carry a screaming toddler a few hundred <br/>
yards to nurse than to just roll over and let him do what isn&#39;t good for the <br/>
breastfeeding-in-public cause.  <br/>
<br/>
Most two year olds aren&#39;t too young to understand &quot;Okay, IF&quot; or &quot;IF then...&quot;<br/>
They forget pretty soon, but it&#39;s possible to use humor and smiling sweetness <br/>
and make it work.  Sometimes all it involves is changing to another chair or <br/>
changing angles 90 degrees, away from the main flow of human traffic.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Janene doesn&#39;t like to be discreet.  I say &quot;we&#39;re in public&quot;  and<br/>
&gt; she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; still try to pull my entire breast out, pull my shirt way up, etc.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember specifically one day a few months ago when I told her<br/>
&gt; &quot;we&#39;re in<br/>
&gt; &gt; public honey, let me do it&quot; and she did. Later when we were at home<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; was nursing and she pushed my shirt up to my neck and I pulled it<br/>
&gt; down a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bit and she said &quot;mommy, we are NOT in public now.&quot;  OK....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both my kids weaned themselves at about one year; I can&#39;t imagine what<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; like to have a child who has *words* for it...  &quot;Mummy dear, I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; a bit<br/>
&gt; of titty now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s not exactly like that, although it can.  With Lexie we used<br/>
the word cuzzle, which is a code word. most talking kids have a code<br/>
word. She&#39;d ask to cuzzle and most people had no clue what that meant.<br/>
But it is very sweet to have a child that has words for it.  children<br/>
that can and do talk about breastfeeding are very clear that it&#39;s<br/>
important to them, and much of the talk is about this.  Lexie weaned at<br/>
just under age 6 and she clearly remembers breastfeeding.  The see<br/>
breasts as for children.  They nurse their dolls, they have little<br/>
concept of bottles, and when bottles are being used, they always contain<br/>
juice or pumped milk.  There are so many reasons to nurse toddlers and<br/>
big kids, I&#39;ve nursed Lexie through four surgeries.  She healed faster,<br/>
and easier.  And she didn&#39;t have to fast as long before surgery as<br/>
breastmilk is a clear fluid.  And often, with my girls, when they are<br/>
nursing is the only time I can talk without constant negotiation.<br/>
Nursing also calms the toddler tantrum and soothes every hurt, and is my<br/>
insurance for good nutrition.  Anyway, you can&#39;t imagine what it is like<br/>
to have children who ask for nursing, and I can&#39;t imagine weaning a baby<br/>
at such a young age.<br/>

about 3 1/2yo and quite capable of waiting a few minutes, he was a <br/>

Beakman like on &quot;Beakman&#39;s World&quot;??  Maybe he&#39;s a chemist, not a linguist.<br/>
<br/>
The OED has some tittle/tiddle stuff about trifling with people, gossiping, <br/>
tittle-tattle, which might be some of the prejudice against &quot;tattling&quot;--not <br/>
philosophical, but because the word itself has such a negative connotation, <br/>
it cannot be redeemed until it&#39;s renamed.  One &quot;tittle&quot; mentions tickling but <br/>
they say it&#39;s probably not from the Latin.  But it was the late 16th century, <br/>
I think, before it showed up, and Latin was the second language of lots of <br/>
Europeans for a good while before that.  Anyone studying theology, law, <br/>
medicine or philosophy knew it.  <br/>

&gt;ask for BA HUGGY DYES (that&#39;s what she called nursing and breasts).<br/>
&gt;Nobody else knew what she was talking about.  Allison is 2 1/2 now<br/>
&gt;and says, &quot;Mommy, I want ehhh ehhh ehhh.&quot;  Again, nobody except<br/>
&gt;the family knows what she is talking about.  Most of the verbal kids<br/>
&gt;I know who are still nursing, make up their own words for it and I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;NEVER heard of a nursling asking to nurse, saying anything like<br/>
&gt;&quot;Mummy dear, I&#39;d like a bit of  titty.&quot;   The closest thing I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt;is &quot;Mommy, I want to nurse.&quot;  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve EVER heard a kid<br/>
&gt;call it &quot;titty&quot; in fact.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it depends a great deal on what the parents start calling it when <br/>
the child is pre-verbal.  If the mother asks, &quot;Do you want to nurse?&quot; the <br/>
child will probably call it that.  If the mother calls it booby or titty, <br/>
that&#39;s the word the child will use (or try to use, which is where some of <br/>
the great kid sayings come from.)<br/>
