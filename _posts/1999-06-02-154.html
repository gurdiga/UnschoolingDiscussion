    I get this all the time!  Usually it is my 7 yod who is with me and she <br/>
immediately tells them we homeschool.  Sometimes we get some very negative <br/>
reactions, but usually the people are nice about it, but you can tell they <br/>
think we&#39;re weird.  If I also have my 10 yos, and my 13 yos and 17 yos with <br/>
me, it is alot worse, especially since my 17 yos is much taller than I am.  I <br/>
think they accept my homeschooling my youngest child, much more easily than <br/>
they do my teenagers.<br/>
     I am with you.  That story was scary.  It reminded me of the <br/>
mistreatment of the Jewish people during the holocaust also!  I sure hope <br/>
things won&#39;t get this bad!<br/>

     It sure does!  If they ask something that my kids don&#39;t know, I just say <br/>
that we haven&#39;t covered that yet.  If it is a stranger, I try to change the <br/>
subject and go on.  In my case, my family seems to do most of this.  <br/>
Sometimes they ask questions when I am not around, so they can put my kids on <br/>
the spot.  Then they come back to me and complain about the things I haven&#39;t <br/>
covered yet.  They have even jumped all over my kids, saying that they should <br/>
have learned that by now!  It makes me so mad!  Usually, I have just taken it <br/>
quietly, without really defending ourselves, but lately I have politely asked <br/>
them to quit quizing my kids.  I ask them if they feel like they need to quiz <br/>
public school kids like that.  The problem is that my relatives get mad and <br/>

That must be frustrating, I am happy to say that I don&#39;t get that from my <br/>
family, they are supportive or else they know better then to question me! <br/>
But, if my family did have that attitude, I think I would answer them that I <br/>
was indeed happy that they care about my kids, but quizzing them to try to <br/>
find out what they Don&#39;t know so that they could have something to fuss <br/>
about, would NOT be my idea of showing love and concern.  However, if that is <br/>
what their idea of love and concern is, then I would be happy to show my love <br/>
and concern for their children, as I certainly love their kids as much as <br/>
they love mine.  Course, if the ones that are doing that don&#39;t have kids, I <br/>
would have to leave out the last part!!<br/>

from my in laws. I hate it and have no problem letting people know when<br/>
they are bugging my kids. I simple tell them that our kids don&#39;t do<br/>
tricks.<br/>
I&#39;ve had comments about pacifiers and thumb sucking and diaper wearing<br/>

My MIL is a retired school teacher and she is supportive of my homeschooling <br/>
the kids, however, she does tend to quiz them when I am not around.  One day <br/>
she came up to me and said that my 9 yo dd should know her multiplication <br/>
tables and that she needed to work on them.  I told her that I did not <br/>
believe in memorizing them (she is a retired highschool math teacher).  I <br/>
told her that I felt it was more important for Sarah to understand what <br/>
multiplication was and how to figure out the answer and that eventually she <br/>
would have them memorized just from repetition.  My FIL was in the room and <br/>
he has a Ph.D. in physics.  He came to my rescue and completely agreed with <br/>
me.  I thought that was great.  He said some of the best mathematicians still <br/>
didn&#39;t have them memorized.  He said learning math theory and the language of <br/>
math was far more important.  By the way he is better at advanced math than <br/>
my MIL.  So she had to back down.<br/>

     I know how you feel.  Is he your oldest child?  If so, that is why that <br/>
is the question that everybody asks him.  My three older children get quized <br/>
on spelling, geography, history--you name it, but my daughter only gets asked <br/>
if she is reading yet.  That seems to be the big mark for people that know <br/>
you homeschool, as if since your child is not reading yet, then you are <br/>
failing in homeschooling.  No-one stops and does that to public school kids <br/>
however,  Instead if a child in public school isn&#39;t reading by 2nd or 3rd <br/>
grade, then they assume the child is having reading problems-they sure don&#39;t <br/>
blame the parents.  Although, I don&#39;t think that those children should be <br/>
labelled as having learning difficulties (that label will follow them through <br/>
life), I also don&#39;t like the double standards being followed.  If it is not <br/>
the parents fault if you have a nonreader in public school, why do they <br/>
automatically blame the parent if the child homeschools?<br/>
     The other problem, of course, is that you don&#39;t run into people that <br/>
believe in the public school system, that have read John Holt or believes in <br/>
letting a child learn to read in their own time.  Instead they assume that <br/>
all children should learn to read in first grade, because the public school <br/>
system teaches it then.  Automatically, they expect the same of <br/>
homeschoolers.  It doesn&#39;t do any good to talk about why, or bring up John <br/>
Holts ideas, you just end up getting stranger looks than they already give <br/>
you for homeschooling.  LOL<br/>
It is a never ending battle!<br/>

have pulled away because of it.<br/>

Most of them have grown kids with kids of their own (none are homeschooling, <br/>

Abeka.  My parents approve of their homeschooling because my sister in law <br/>
went to college planning to be a teacher.<br/>
They have even fixed up a school room in their home.  It has a big teachers <br/>
desk that faces her &quot;students&quot; desk and comes complete with a black board and <br/>
a flag for saying the Pledge to Allegiance in the morning.  My parents think <br/>
it is great!).  Unfortunately, none of those remarks are helping yet.  They <br/>
may back off for a while, all in a huff that I even got upset at them, but <br/>
then in a few weeks they are back to their old behavior.  LOL<br/>
There is just no winning the situation!<br/>

I hope I don&#39;t offend anyone (assuming I won&#39;t since this is, afterall, an <br/>

 desk that faces her &quot;students&quot; desk and comes complete with a black board <br/>
and <br/>
 a flag for saying the Pledge to Allegiance in the morning. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Tami,<br/>
LOL!  Not that the situation is funny, but,  I did the exact same thing when <br/>
I started out 6 years ago!  Went to toys R Us and got the little desks, and <br/>
got the Konos curriculum,  the whole nine yards, yep, had the flag too.  That <br/>
lasted about 2 months and I was bonkers!!!  I could not handle Konos, no way <br/>
could I do Abecka.  <br/>
Everyone is different in how they interact with their families,  I have <br/>
always been the black sheep of mine,  I walk my walk, and do my thing, and <br/>
don&#39;t give a rats behind if anyone including and especially my family likes <br/>
it or not.  They tend to not mess with me and we get along fine,  but that is <br/>
me, not you and you have to find your way as you go and grow.  But, rest <br/>
assured, you have lots of friends here that you can scream kick and generally <br/>
ventilate to!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; My MIL is a retired school teacher and she is supportive of my <br/>
homeschooling <br/>
 the kids, however, she does tend to quiz them when I am not around.  One day <br/>
 she came up to me and said that my 9 yo dd should know her multiplication <br/>
 tables and that she needed to work on them.  I told her that I did not <br/>
 believe in memorizing them (she is a retired highschool math teacher).  I <br/>
 told her that I felt it was more important for Sarah to understand what <br/>
 multiplication was and how to figure out the answer and that eventually she <br/>
 would have them memorized just from repetition.  My FIL was in the room and <br/>
 he has a Ph.D. in physics.  He came to my rescue and completely agreed with <br/>
 me.  I thought that was great.  He said some of the best mathematicians <br/>
still <br/>
 didn&#39;t have them memorized.  He said learning math theory and the language <br/>
of <br/>
 math was far more important. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

     That is great!  I wish my father had come to my rescue, unfortunately he <br/>
agrees with my mother.  They also get on me about teaching multipication <br/>
facts, and they hate it that I don&#39;t believe in it!  My mother taught 4th <br/>
grade, and my dad taught junior high math!  Oh well, I guess I will just have <br/>
to learn how to handle my parents! *sigh*<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sorry to hear this about your family.  That must be so hard.  But I am <br/>

 to hear that your husband is giving you so much support.  Just hang in there <br/>

     Thanks, I need that.  As I said in an earlier post, there aren&#39;t any <br/>
unschoolers (at least any that I have met) around my area.  One reason that I <br/>
am having a tough time believing in what I do, is that I feel so alone.This <br/>

(They send over TONS of stuff fromt their school district, constantly...)  I <br/>
have asked them to be involved in my children&#39;s education, in areas of their <br/>
own expertise.  SO - my mil now comes once a week and teaches the younger 2 <br/>
accordian (they love it) and she teaches my oldest dd violin (who also loves <br/>
it).  Her forte is music...  I always tell her how much I appreciate it, how <br/>
their math skills have improved dramatically since starting music lessons, <br/>
etc...  She feels like at least they are getting SOME education, harumph. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My fil is way into guns and knives and collecting.  He taught my military - <br/>
minded son how to take care of a gun, gun safety, shooting and aiming, etc.  <br/>
He has talked to him about the history of some guns, which has led to my son <br/>
learning about some other countries, and THEIR weaponry.  Currently he is <br/>
fascinated by medieval times and THEIR weaponry...  I know, I hate guns too <br/>
--- wouldn&#39;t have one in my house.  BUT this passion of fil&#39;s has led to a <br/>
well rounded education for my son....<br/>

     I had a friend who suggested that I try that with my parents, so I went <br/>
to them and asked them how they felt about it.  My mom decided that she <br/>
wanted to teach them history, while my dad said that he wanted to teach them <br/>
math.  So I took them over and we tried to start doing this.  Well, my dad <br/>
only harped on how much my kids should already know and that I wasn&#39;t making <br/>
them spend enough hours per week on their math books.  My mother was upset <br/>
about us not doing &quot;state&quot; history yet with my (then) 4th grader (as 4th <br/>
grade here is the year they learn all about our state history).  Then they <br/>
wanted to know how much we pulled out spelling books and English books as she <br/>
wasn&#39;t happy with their spelling and grammar skills while they wrote her <br/>
reports.  Then she went on to gripe about how my 4th grader should be doing <br/>
cursive by now, and by the way, what textbooks do we use for science?  I <br/>
tried to calmly explain (again!) that we don&#39;t use textbooks, and the only <br/>
ones I had for them was for math.  This is course, brought on alot of <br/>
yelling, since they have given me tons of public school textbooks for all <br/>
grades and subjects.  I had to admit that yes, we still have them, but they <br/>
are put away in a closet and we don&#39;t use them.!  My parents were furious, my <br/>
kids crying and begging me not to make them go to grandmas and grandpas <br/>
anymore, which just made my parents more angry, as they blamed that on me as <br/>
well (Couldn&#39;t they see that their attitude about my kids and school work <br/>
were pushing them away?).  I just had to quit, I couldn&#39;t handle it.  <br/>
Needless to say, my kids are not being taught anything by their grandparents <br/>
any more.<br/>
     Do you know what the really tough thing is about all of this?  <br/>
Regardless of how upset I get on the way they treat me and the kids, I really <br/>
love them!  When I am feeling this way, or admitting to other people what I <br/>
am going through, I feel guilty!  I feel like I am being disrespectful about <br/>
my parents!..  However, I tried being respectful for 35 years, and they used <br/>
it to control my life.  I tried to pull away, nicely, but they wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
go.  So finally, I made it clear that I want to control my own life, and they <br/>
get mad and I feel guilty!  I don&#39;t get it!<br/>

See, now here is the method I would have used...<br/>
<br/>
Mom - we are going to XYZ museum today, and they have a great exhibit on <br/>
Ancient Egyptian History - could you come along and share with us stuff you <br/>
might know that the museum doesn&#39;t have listed??  Dad, How did they use math <br/>
in those days?  Did they have calculators or something?  <br/>
<br/>
Incorporate them INTO the learning, but still do the learning YOUR way... <br/>
does that make sense??<br/>
