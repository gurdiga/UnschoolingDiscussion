Okay.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I was seeing it in person in the  70&#39;s, I didn&#39;t see anything but <br/>
kids going to head start classes, and parents ignoring them a year earlier <br/>
than they would have done otherwise.<br/>

<br/>
Besides, there could have been other ways to help these children besides<br/>
sending them to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111203714">the thing I remember about Head start (my being a single mom when <br/>
Jason was little qualified him, and he did attend Head Start) 1) it <br/>
was run by some pretty cool people, who were interested in seeing me <br/>
get on my feet, though not a lot of classes or other offered to me <br/>
and 2) it was so politically correct it drove me and the teachers <br/>
nuts. e.g. in the winter, when they went and played in the snow, and <br/>
wanted to make snowmen, the teachers were instructed to correct the <br/>
children so they were making &quot;snow people.&quot; *Sigh* I think even the <br/>
director of that Head Start was just following protocol as handed <br/>
down from above.<br/>
<br/>
Educating kids at any age, with Federal money (and Federal <br/>
regulations) is a BAD idea.<br/>
