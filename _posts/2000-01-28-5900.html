<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170421280">I think that Rodale Press through their Organic Book Club still have the<br/>
book available.  Book clubs are my biggest vice &lt;g&gt;  I just got this copy<br/>
within the last couple of years because my old copy was &quot;borrowed&quot; and<br/>
seems to have found another home.<br/>

&gt; Square foot Gardening was out of print a couple of yrs ago so if you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t get it you might have to try Amazon or someone like that to search<br/>
&gt; out a copy for you.<br/>
&gt; I have a beat up copy floating around the house somewhere and it is a<br/>
&gt; treasure!<br/>
&gt; It was a very popular book so libraries may still have it.<br/>

&gt; Rodale does publish that, it is &quot;Square Foot Gardening&quot; and is written by<br/>
&gt; Mel Bartholomew.  He use to (don&#39;t know if he still does) have a television<br/>
&gt; show that he did this on.  the kidlets like this book because of the<br/>
&gt; diagrams and easy to follow steps.  they also like the one about what<br/>
&gt; plants like to grow together, &quot;Carrots Love&quot; something or another.<br/>
