<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442903249">Games, games, games!  There is sooo much math in games.  You can even change <br/>
how you take turns, to get more math in there!<br/>
<br/>
Example:  I recently noticed that my daughter could add two number easily, <br/>
but not a string of numbers.  I got out candyland (she&#39;s 6) and four dice.  <br/>
We played as usual, except for each of our first turns we used one die.  On <br/>
our second turns we used two, on the third three, on the fourth four.  We <br/>
rotated like this, and by the end, she had it.  (It also made for a very <br/>
fast game!)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the unschooling part (at least for me):<br/>
<br/>
She wanted to do it.  Shw had fun.  She didn&#39;t express a desire to stop, but <br/>
played anyway because I forced her.  For me, unschooling is presenting <br/>
stuff, saying &quot;hey, look at this!&quot;  and then seeing if she&#39;s interested.  If <br/>
not, we&#39;re done, if she is we keep going until she&#39;s done.  It&#39;s about her <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be working.  We stared &quot;officially&quot; homeschooling in August, but <br/>
she didn&#39;t know until November.  She begs me to let her play addition games <br/>
on the computer.  Of course, she does seem to like numbers.  But anyway, if <br/>
you find engaging, interesting ways to present the math without pressure, <br/>
it&#39;s actually pretty fun and the kids like it.  It&#39;s the worksheets most <br/>
people could live without, not the math.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Tupelo,<br/>
<br/>
Did you pull out Candyland with the intention to use the game to <br/>
teach your daughter math; or did you pull out Candyland to have fun <br/>
with your daughter?  There is a difference, and kids know it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not *learning in disguise*.  It&#39;s not unschooling <br/>
because you used a game instead of a workbook.  It&#39;s unschooling when <br/>
you play a game with your daughter because you enjoy her company, and <br/>
you answer her questions, and interact with her according to *her* <br/>
need and desire, not according to your disguised agenda (which is to <br/>
teach her something).<br/>
<br/>
I hope that doesn&#39;t sound harsh.  I really don&#39;t mean to be...it&#39;s <br/>
just that it took me a while to understand the difference, and I <br/>
thought maybe I could help you understand it, too.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She wanted to do it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Was it her idea to play Candyland, or did you pull out the game <br/>
thinking to yourself that there&#39;s a lot of math in games.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s about her <br/>
&gt; choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Choices are funny things.  If someone offers you icecream and gives <br/>
you a *choice* of chocolate or vanilla, how much of a choice is <br/>
that?  The person offering the icecream is still controlling your <br/>
choice.  What if you&#39;re really a Rocky Road or Cherry Chocolate Chip <br/>
kind of person?  You might *choose* the chocolate to be polite, but <br/>
in your heart you really want Cherry Chocolate Chip.  I think kids <br/>
are like that; most kids want to please their parents, and so they <br/>
might make a *choice* simply because they&#39;re asked to choose.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling is not *learning in disguise*.  It&#39;s not unschooling <br/>
because you used a game instead of a workbook.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it can be at first, but if it&#39;s not disguised well it will backfire.<br/>
<br/>
If the parents can REALLY concentrate on changing what they believe about <br/>
what is &quot;important learning&quot; and what is &quot;trivia,&quot; or what is &quot;good use of <br/>
time&quot; and what is &quot;just playing,&quot; then if the parents need to use games at <br/>
first to help them see how learning works all the time, the games will be <br/>
better for they dyad, for the family, than not playing the games.<br/>
<br/>
Once unschooling works (if the mom can get it to work, and it IS work, and <br/>
it&#39;s HER work), she won&#39;t feel obligated to choose an &quot;educational game&quot; <br/>
(says so on the box) over &quot;just trivia&quot; or &quot;just chance&quot; <br/>
(probability/math/statistics abound in those &quot;just chance&quot; games) or &quot;just <br/>
strategy&quot; (WHAT!??).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s unschooling when <br/>
you play a game with your daughter because you enjoy her company, and <br/>
you answer her questions, and interact with her according to *her* <br/>
need and desire, not according to your disguised agenda (which is to <br/>
teach her something).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Debbie as regards experienced, established unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For someone newer to it who isn&#39;t quite convinced or committed, they might <br/>
need to start where they are *BUT they need to be quiet about it* and have <br/>
the plan of moving on away from that when they (the mom) &quot;get it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The learning curve is steepest for the mom, when unschooling is coming on.<br/>
<br/>
And as to &quot;start where you are,&quot; I much prefer &quot;start where you&#39;re not.&quot;<br/>
For my personal tastes, I like bold, brave new unschoolers who will see where <br/>
they are and choose to be in a better place.  <br/>
<br/>
For every baby step, it&#39;s a little more &quot;schooling&quot; to be undone, a little <br/>
more unreasonable motherly expectation to overcome.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Choices are funny things.  If someone offers you icecream and gives <br/>
you a *choice* of chocolate or vanilla, how much of a choice is <br/>
that?  The person offering the icecream is still controlling your <br/>
choice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And what if you didn&#39;t want ice cream at all whatsoever?<br/>
Then you either &quot;choose&quot; to go along to make the person happy,<br/>
or you&#39;re &quot;uncooperative.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My children choose to do these things&quot; might be in the category of &quot;my <br/>
children chose vanilla.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unless you are one of my boys.  LOL.  Sometimes I say, in jest, to my husband <br/>
&quot;I wish we had never made the choice to let them choose&quot; then we laugh and go <br/>
back to it.  Giving your children the right to make choices for themselves is <br/>
something you can never take back.  You give them a &quot;right&quot; and they know <br/>
they will always have this.  My sons would never take chocolate if that is <br/>
not what they want.  They would let me know what they really want then insist <br/>
on looking at the ice cream list at the shop and deciding for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that wasn&#39;t&#39; the best way to put it because I guess if I really wanted <br/>
to take that &quot;right&quot; away from them I could.  There would be repercussions <br/>
and it would have a horrible effect on our family but I guess I technically <br/>
could take their choices away.<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes outsiders think that the way I parent is &quot;the easy way out&quot; <br/>
but I really think it is the harder road.  I force myself (and they force me) <br/>
to treat my children like any other person... if I want my way it is about <br/>
compromise.  I can&#39;t just say &quot;do it because I say so.&quot;  That is not good <br/>
enough.  I have to talk with them, discuss the whys and make compromises so <br/>
everyone is happy.  It is about dialogue and takes a lot of effort.  I think <br/>
that society has programmed us that children do what parents want them to.  <br/>
And if you start out from when they are infants maybe that works.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway my brain is foggy this morning.  Yes, morning, we just got out of bed. <br/>
 (ahh one of the joys of unschooling) Not sure how I got out on this tangent <br/>
so far.  LOL.  But I was thinking about this last night when my youngest (5) <br/>
said he was hungry and I said &quot;do you want popcorn or graham crackers&quot; he <br/>
said &quot;neither, I am going to go look in the kitchen.&quot;  I looked at Jackson <br/>
and said &quot; I should learn not to make those kinds of suggestions because he <br/>
always wants &#39;something else&#39;&quot;.  LOL Then I followed him upstairs and helped <br/>
him get out a bowl of cereal.  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084677583">My youngest daughter has always liked Monopoly Jr.  I&#39;ve always found it a<br/>
bit boring, because there is no choice.  You roll the dice and do what the<br/>
square says.  She wanted to play the other day, but we had to get the dice<br/>
out of another game set.  So we had two black and two white.  I suggested<br/>
that we each roll two dice, then choose which one we prefer to use.  (roll a<br/>
2 and a 5, choose to move 2 or 5).  She thought that was a good idea, so we<br/>
did it.  It was the most interesting game of M jr that I&#39;ve ever played.  We<br/>
often change the rules of games, but we have discussed the difference<br/>
between all players agreeing at the beginning to the new rules and that<br/>
sometimes you will play with people who want to follow the &quot;proper&quot; rules.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028031914">The  two Holly stories I brought in yesterday probably seem too foreign, too <br/>
cool, too unlikely, for new unschoolers.   <br/>
<br/>
Looking for some old notes for a speech I&#39;m doing Friday, I found this little <br/>
bit, from six or seven years ago, and thought it would be good to share here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We  have a compost pile, and it&#39;s kind of amazing how it seems at first that <br/>
the food and leaves and sticks and banana peels and dog poop will never do <br/>
anything but sit there looking like garbage, but when I stop watching it, it <br/>
turns to solid black, rich dirt!   I can&#39;t find any parts of the elements of <br/>
which it&#39;s made.     It&#39;s kind of like that with my kids.  It took me a few <br/>
years to quit watching them and trust that it would compost. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All that living and being and thinking and comparing turns to some very solid <br/>
knowledge.  But it happens inside them.  It takes time and it takes <br/>
non-interference.  And it takes input, sunshine, water, lots of quiet, some <br/>
activity, some turning and stirring... &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you!<br/>
 Despite lurking for a few weeks now, I still do not get what the fuss <br/>
is all about.  Instead of excluding material which might help you or <br/>
your child why not include it all?   My home is full of books including <br/>
texts books.  Text books, by the way were originally created as <br/>
reference books ( a few hundred years ago ), so why not use them as <br/>
such.  Or Readers!  They were invented to gather a bunch of short <br/>
stories together, so that the child would not need to carry an entire <br/>
library with him.  Beside a few generations ago, children did not always <br/>
have access to a library.  So if you have a few of them too, don&#39;t trow <br/>
them in the fire place.<br/>
  And what about classes?  If that&#39;s your source of information at the <br/>
moment on a particular subject does that make you less of an unschoolers <br/>
all of sudden?  I disagree.  My sons are gone to their music classes <br/>
right now.   Their knowledge is way over my head.  We are fortunate to <br/>
have found a gem of a teacher.  The youngest wanted to learn blues <br/>
pieces.  She found some for him to learn.  The oldest got into Jazz, <br/>
Classical  , Pop, and some pieces, I don&#39;t know what category they would <br/>
fall into, over the years.  She&#39;s their sources of musical info, and she <br/>
keeps telling me that they are also.<br/>
<br/>
When I was going to school (many moons ago)  adult would say so-and-so <br/>
can&#39;t learn.  I remember thinking : &quot; This is impossible.  You live you <br/>
learn.  Unless you&#39;re dead you can&#39;t help learning.  May be you even <br/>
learn after death too, I just don&#39;t have experience on that.&quot;  Later I <br/>
realized they meant that so-and-so didn&#39;t learned what they  wanted them <br/>
to learn.  Well, that&#39;s different.  They wanted to control the 5 W&#39;s <br/>
concerning some informations they were passing to us.  And so-and-so <br/>
wasn&#39;t re-acting, as they wanted, at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
To me the difference between &quot;Schooling &quot; and &quot;Unschooling&quot; is a mind <br/>
set, an attitude, a life style approach to learning.  Schooling happened <br/>
in institution, where a person (the teacher) decide how you get access <br/>
to information.  Schools depend on a system of punishments and rewards, <br/>
on conformity and lack of personal choices.    Unschooling is using the <br/>
whole world  (very inclusive, less segregated)  to learn what ever, when <br/>
ever, how ever, why ever, with who ever you chose.  Choices are involve. <br/>
Children are born unschoolers.   I found this list useful to remind ME <br/>
to return to the unschooling child I was, and trust my sons to blossom <br/>
freely .<br/>
<br/>
There also seemed to be confusion between controlling and influencing ? <br/>
  Take reading for instance, for years I would find books I thought <br/>
might interest them ( so did the 11 grand-parents and grand- relatives <br/>
in my sons&#39; lives... ).  Sometimes they would get into one or another. <br/>
 Sometimes it didn&#39;t catch any of them, only me, or not even me.  Now, <br/>
 They read books and say: &quot; Momm , you should read this... (or)  You <br/>
should propose it to your reading club.&quot;    I could not make them read <br/>
something, or learn something.  Learning is something you do personally. <br/>
 But when I sit back, I can see how our own personal learning have been <br/>
intertwined over the years.  Yet, to take the weaver analogy, today all <br/>
five of us are a different weaving.  I don&#39;t want to control what they <br/>
learn, but we can&#39;t help influence each others learning.   We live <br/>
together after all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, enough coals in the fire for one day.<br/>

<br/>
A few hundred years ago, that might have been true.  But school text books <br/>
are created for school-teaching.  I doubt you have any two hundred year old <br/>
reference books, and if you did they wouldn&#39;t be much use to you or your kids <br/>
except as information about what it was like 200 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not making your kids go to classes, that&#39;s one thing.  Some <br/>
families REQUIRE each child to take a music class and a sport and whatever <br/>
all.  That&#39;s not unschooling, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Having textbooks is no big deal.  Making kids use them is.<br/>
When a parent thinks the best math learning opportunity in her house is in a <br/>
math textbook, that&#39;s a problem IF she wants to understand unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Thank you!<br/>
Despite lurking for a few weeks now, I still do not get what the fuss<br/>
is all about.  Instead of excluding material which might help you or<br/>
your child why not include it all?   My home is full of books including<br/>
texts books.  Text books, by the way were originally created as<br/>
reference books ( a few hundred years ago ), so why not use them as<br/>
such.  Or Readers!  They were invented to gather a bunch of short<br/>
stories together, so that the child would not need to carry an entire<br/>
library with him.  Beside a few generations ago, children did not always<br/>
have access to a library.  So if you have a few of them too, don&#39;t trow<br/>
them in the fire place.<br/>
And what about classes?  If that&#39;s your source of information at the<br/>
moment on a particular subject does that make you less of an unschoolers<br/>
all of sudden?  I disagree.  My sons are gone to their music classes<br/>
right now.   Their knowledge is way over my head.  We are fortunate to<br/>
have found a gem of a teacher.  The youngest wanted to learn blues<br/>
pieces.  She found some for him to learn.  The oldest got into Jazz,<br/>
Classical  , Pop, and some pieces, I don&#39;t know what category they would<br/>
fall into, over the years.  She&#39;s their sources of musical info, and she<br/>
keeps telling me that they are also.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you are saying and don&#39;t see where anyone here would have <br/>
a problem with it either. So why are you thinking that an unschooler can&#39;t <br/>
have textbooks in their homes? Why can&#39;t an unschooler take a class? Have <br/>
you read the archives and seen some of the discussions here? We recently had <br/>
one about reading programs and such. It&#39;s just a matter of what the child <br/>
enjoys. It&#39;s a matter of how it&#39;s presented. Saying to a child, &quot;Let&#39;s play <br/>
Candyland for awhile&quot; is different from saying, &quot;Do you want to play a game, <br/>
which one would you like to play?&quot; It may not seem like that much of a big <br/>
deal but it will make a difference in the long run if you look at everything <br/>
in that way. Is it a choice for the child or parent?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have school books here. We have a reading program here. We have <br/>
worksheets and workbooks available. My children have access to classes. It&#39;s <br/>
all just a matter of what they want to choose to do though. Just because I <br/>
have it here doesn&#39;t mean they have to use it. That&#39;s the difference. Me <br/>
thinking they should use a tool and them wanting to.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I actually do agree with this. At least so far. &lt;bg&gt; Some others may come up <br/>
with something to have me change my mind.<br/>
<br/>
The woman who got me into unschooling, in my opinion at the time was very <br/>
radical. This was years ago before I realized there were others out there! <br/>
She was totally trusting and respectful of her children. She unschooled them <br/>
all their lives in a few different states. Her oldest, when she was about 16 <br/>
wanted to enroll in Clon Lara. Now what I understand about it is they send <br/>
you work that has to be finished. Kind of like a mail order school program. <br/>
Maybe less restrictive. Anyway, with the way her mom handled it all, I saw <br/>
it as unschooling too. It was something her daughter wanted to do and <br/>
actually found the school herself. It was handled the same way they handled <br/>
everything else. It was all child decided. The daughter wanted the diploma <br/>
she got at the end and I think she just wanted to see if she could do it. I <br/>
think she was enrolled for 2 years until she finished.<br/>
<br/>
I also consider Tara now as being unschooled. It&#39;s not just the fact that <br/>
she has the option to quit school anytime she wants. She also has the option <br/>
when to go or not and whether she wants to follow the rules or not. Now if <br/>
she decided she wanted all this and I made her be on time, go every day, do <br/>
the work, wear the uniform all because she&#39;s the one that &quot;wanted&quot; this, it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the same. She has the option for all the rules that go along <br/>
with the school. She bends them, believe me, but knows the consequences are <br/>
her own to handle. She doesn&#39;t get any hassle from me. I really don&#39;t mind <br/>
if she pushes the limit of her uniforms. I don&#39;t mind if she doesn&#39;t do all <br/>
the homework. I don&#39;t mind if she skips a day or is late. It&#39;s all her <br/>
choice and she decides if the consequences are worth the bending of the <br/>
rules or not. She knows she isn&#39;t going to get in trouble here.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a great kid. Never in trouble. She&#39;s trustworthy and lets me know what <br/>
she&#39;s doing. She misses a day of school here and there. She makes it up in <br/>
her work because she likes seeing her do good by school standards. She&#39;s had <br/>
detention once for smacking some kid. I offered to go to school in her <br/>
behalf because I thought they were wrong and she asked me not to. She <br/>
handles this all with her own agenda. She does well as far as grades. She <br/>
works 5 days a week at Old Navy. She saves money, she spends money. She&#39;s <br/>
rarely home later than 1:00 a.m. even though she has no curfew. Since I&#39;ve <br/>
looked at her differently, in an unschooling way, if you will, things in her <br/>
life have been better than ever. For her and for us because of her <br/>
happiness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889548413">Mary,<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree.  You might recall my son was talking about going back to high school next year.<br/>
<br/>
He told me yesterday he &quot;kind of wants to go&quot; but &quot;doesn&#39;t want to do all the work it would take to prepare to go&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get a chance yet to tell him that he doesn&#39;t have to and that he can just go and do what he wants on his own terms.  I really don&#39;t care if they think he isn&#39;t &quot;prepared&quot; anymore. I don&#39;t even care if he never does the homework or snores through the classes.<br/>
<br/>
His attitude toward school is that it is stupid but he wants to be with his friends.  I figure it he feels that way, he&#39;ll come home before he gets into trouble over it.  I think he just wants to decide if its worth it to be with his friends and I don&#39;t think it will take long for him to decide.<br/>

A child that goes to school by choice has a very different experience from a <br/>
child that has no choice. On that I will agree.<br/>
But Unschooling means NOT schooling. And a child that goes to school is <br/>
schooling. Period.<br/>
People diluting the definition of unschooling is NOT going to help people <br/>
understand it better. Going to school can not, by definition, be unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473847880">My middle daughter decided that she wanted to go back to school when she was 14. She had been out of school for almost 2 years. She said she wanted to go back for the &quot;socialization&quot;. On what would have been her fourth day back, she said, &quot;Mom, do I have to go back?&quot; I said &quot;No.&quot; She said &quot;Good, because school is so stupid.&quot; She told me later that there really is no socialization because the teachers won&#39;t let you talk to your friends in class, you can&#39;t talk to your friends in between classes because you&#39;re too busy rushing to your locker and you can&#39;t talk to your friends at lunch because you only get a few minutes to eat. She said it was pointless. And she said that &quot;home ec&quot; in particular was a &quot;joke&quot;. She said they had a quiz to name kitchen utensils (spatula, wooden spoon, whisk, etc.) She said &quot;Didn&#39;t we learn this stuff like when we were 3?&quot; lol. She never went back. She met a nice guy, got married and is having a baby any day now. She plans on homeschooling her kids. I don&#39;t know about unschooling. After I took her out of school (she was in 7th grade), she kept asking me when I was going to give her schoolwork to do. I tried to explain about decompressing, but she would say, &quot;Mom!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656178080">on 2/26/03 4:50 PM, Lucie Caunter at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lucie.caunter@...">lucie.caunter@...</a> wrote:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I still do not get what the fuss<br/>
&gt; is all about.  Instead of excluding material which might help you or<br/>
&gt; your child why not include it all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Mary. No one would disagree with what you&#39;re saying. But it<br/>
isn&#39;t the actions that make something unschooling or not, it&#39;s the<br/>
motivations. And that&#39;s what the fuss is about.<br/>
<br/>
If a *parent* sees a resource as a means of moving the child from where he<br/>
is to where the parent wants him to be, then it&#39;s not unschooling. If the<br/>
parents sees something as a way of helping the child get from where he is to<br/>
where the *child* wants to be then it&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It can get a bit gray depending on the parents&#39; and children&#39;s understanding<br/>
of learning too. If someone is taking a class because it appeals to them<br/>
then it&#39;s unschooling. If someone is taking a class because they think it&#39;s<br/>
the only way to learn something properly then their thinking may be closing<br/>
in or skewing away from unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
(Sometimes a class *is* the only decent option, like martial arts for<br/>
example. But an art class can provide *aspects* of learning about art (like<br/>
seeing how others interpret the same assignment, hearing how someone else<br/>
views what you&#39;re doing) that learning in other ways don&#39;t provide as well.)<br/>
<br/>
No one can really tell *why* someone is doing something based purely on what<br/>
they&#39;re doing. If unschooling were describable and definable purely through<br/>
what people do, it would be easy to explain and get! We could just give<br/>
people a formula. But it isn&#39;t. It depends lots on what&#39;s going on inside of<br/>
someone which is why we need so many words to talk about it!<br/>

&gt; understand it better. Going to school can not, by definition, be <br/>
&gt; unschooling<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with this statement.  However, I consider us an unschooling <br/>
family, not just that my children are unschoolers but as a family we are an <br/>
unschooling family.  Our family philosophy is that we learn what we need to <br/>
learn to do what we are doing right now, and what interests us right now.  <br/>
When we renovated our bathroom we read and talked with people about how to do <br/>
this and we, even as adults, were unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I do not have children in public or private school so have <br/>
no experience with that scenario, but if I did I would still consider us an <br/>
unschooling family that happened to have a &quot;schooling&quot; (for lack of a better <br/>
word) child.  The family as a whole still holds to the same philosophy, that <br/>
we trust our children as we trust each other to make the right choices for <br/>
themselves at any given moment.  If our child felt that there was something <br/>
in &quot;school&quot; that he needed (what I can&#39;t imagine, LOL) I would still consider <br/>
us an unschooling family and that the child had made the choice to be a <br/>
&quot;schooler&quot;.  This would be just a part of his lifelong journey.  I certainly <br/>
wouldn&#39;t call him an unschooler as an individual at that particular moment <br/>
though.<br/>

That is why I love this list and a couple of other lists I am on.  The <br/>
discussion focuses on the &quot;why&quot; and not just on the &quot;what&#39;.  Sometimes it is <br/>
easier to talk about the &quot;whats&quot; but if you really get down to the philosophy <br/>

It was a nice story. Congratulations on the coming attraction. I would love <br/>
for my children to also want to homeschool. As a grandma, knowing how I was <br/>

First of all I don&#39;t call my oldest an unschooler. In my mind I think she is <br/>
but only because I know how we are with it and how she is with school and <br/>
the reasons behind it. To me, unschooling is so much more than just &quot;not <br/>
going to school.&quot; But I do know that we are still an unschooling family. It <br/>
was a choice Tara made. Just as if she would want to take music lessons, <br/>
foreign language lessons or do unit studies because she liked them.<br/>
<br/>
Her going to school is for her reasons. Her choices. She knows you can learn <br/>
lots elsewhere. She sees that every day here. She likes the teachers and the <br/>
socialization. In her school, she actually does socialize an awful lot. More <br/>
so than when she was younger. The teachers are more like buddies than <br/>
anything else. She likes pushing the limits on something most people don&#39;t <br/>
question. She likes the grades and the work that accompanies it. She isn&#39;t <br/>
finding it hard. She&#39;s actually taking AP classes for college credit and <br/>
doing well. She hates tests and doesn&#39;t do well on them and she&#39;s fine with <br/>
that. So I don&#39;t see where she&#39;s trapped into the &quot;doing good&quot; mentality of <br/>
schools. She doesn&#39;t care what they think, she cares what she thinks.<br/>
<br/>
So we do unschool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a post just about that and the computer crashed before it got sent. I<br/>
agree that if a child goes to school just for social stuff, band, sports,<br/>
and sees the teachers, tests and textbooks as just a hoop to jump through to<br/>
get to the stuff they want, then they&#39;re unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But it can be confusing to newbies to say so. (Just mentioning that as<br/>
something we should be aware of, not to keep anyone from talking about it.)<br/>
Saying a child choosing to go to school is unschooling will get interpretted<br/>
as whatever a child chooses to do is unschooling as long as the child has<br/>
&quot;freely&quot; chosen it.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, it&#39;s the motivations, not the actions that define unschooling.<br/>
If a child is certain they need a teacher to learn something, then they<br/>
aren&#39;t making that decision based on unschooling principles but on fear<br/>
instilled by society.<br/>
