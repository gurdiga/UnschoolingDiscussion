<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776323271"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;For one thing, for all the Christians make noise about Satan, he only exists <br/>
 </span></blockquote>within the framework of THEIR RELIGION.  For non Christians there is no such <br/>
thing as Satan.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Its that time of year again on other mailing lists where the folks who think Halloween is a celebration of all things satanic are having a field day. It seems to escape their notice (and they refuse to pay attention when you mention it) that the Druids/Celts/whatevers would not be worshipping Satan on that date since they (as far as we know, not much is not known about them) would not have &quot;known&quot; Satan as he exits, as Sandra points out, in a Judeo-Christian beleif system.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I have my own belif that some of the anti-Halloween stuff is really anti-Catholic stuff (ala Chick tracts) in disquise...they just don&#39;t want to admit it. JMHO and really just a feeling I get.<br/>

Judeo-Christian beleif system. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;real Christians&quot; (using their term, tongue-in-cheek) really and truly <br/>
believe that everything they believe is real, and literal, nothing <br/>
figurative, nothing allegorical.  There IS one God, and Jesus is the only <br/>
way.  Period.  If that&#39;s true, there IS a Satan, because God said so.  And he <br/>
is SO real and smart and sneaky that anyone who believes anything except <br/>
&quot;true christianity&quot; believes it because Satan has lured them into a false <br/>
sense of security.  Satan told people that Buddhism was just as good as <br/>
christianity.  Satan told people the world was older than carbon-dated <br/>
dinosaurs.  Satan did EVERY BAD THING ever done.  <br/>
<br/>
So just because we don&#39;t believe in Satan doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t exist.  <br/>
It&#39;s just more evidence of his power.<br/>
<br/>
I paid a lot of attention in church.  I&#39;m not joking or exaggerating here at <br/>
all.<br/>
