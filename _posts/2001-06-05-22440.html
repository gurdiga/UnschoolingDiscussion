This interview with Edgar Steele, Joann McGuckin&#39;s atty.<br/>
was just aired (9:50pm pacific) on the Roger Fredinburg<br/>
radio show: (I&#39;m transcribing as I go...no grammar/spelling<br/>
police, PLEASE!)S=Edgar Steele, F=Roger Fredinburg.<br/>
<br/>
S: I was her lawyer until Friday morning when the local<br/>
authorities cut off all contact between me and my client.<br/>
<br/>
F: Is that what happened?<br/>
<br/>
S: And it was demanded that I communicate with them in<br/>
writing through the court appointed attorney.<br/>
<br/>
F: We have the attorney in exile, Edgar Steele. First and<br/>
foremost the information is that you were fired by Joann<br/>
McGuckin, true or false?<br/>
<br/>
S: False.<br/>
<br/>
F: How does the state remove a lawyer from representation?<br/>
<br/>
S:The STATE does not remove a lawyer from<br/>
reperesentation..... I withdrew ... They refused to let me<br/>
talk to her.....I said I gotta talk to her in person. They<br/>
said, well you&#39;re not the lawyer, and I said but I AM. They<br/>
said no, this other guy is.......I said he is the criminal<br/>
defense lawyer, I am her personal civil lawyer....people DO<br/>
have more than one lawyer for things in life. They said,<br/>
sorry, we are under orders of the Bonner County prosecuting<br/>
attorney, Phil Robinson, to NOT allow you to talk to her.<br/>
<br/>
F: Well, that&#39;s just plainly idiotic! So what&#39;s his phone<br/>
number so people can call him and tell him what an idiot he<br/>
is tomorrow??I&#39;m Serious!(laughter from Mr. Steele) S: Oh,<br/>
I LOVE it!.....I&#39;m not going to subscribe to that, of<br/>
course (faciously).<br/>
<br/>
F: You can&#39;t, no, let me do it. Let me call him an idiot!<br/>
You&#39;re an idiot, PHIL!<br/>
<br/>
S: His phone number is 208-263-6714.<br/>
<br/>
S:You see this was at the time the standoff was still going<br/>
on. Now, I could of gone into court, I could have gotten an<br/>
order and I could have forced them to produce my client,<br/>
Joann McGuckin, in person. But, I felt that was non<br/>
productive, given the sensitivity of the situation at the<br/>
time. And I still think that was appropriate, however,<br/>
given the representation that she wanted to communicate to<br/>
me only in writing and ONLY through the court appointed<br/>
attorney, according to bar ethics rules, I had to comply<br/>
with that even though she hadn&#39;t personally told me. I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to do that. She hired me and by God, she was<br/>
the one I was going to talk to. I wasn&#39;t going to open my<br/>
files to this guy, I wasn&#39;t going to take orders from this<br/>
guy.<br/>
<br/>
F: NO! Oh, I&#39;m with you 100% on this, Edgar, that&#39; good<br/>
representation......<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about the child abuse garbage that Joann has<br/>
been accused of, any reality, any truth there?<br/>
<br/>
S: I think you charactarized it just right. I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s any reality to it at all. Consider the following:<br/>
The kids were spirited out of that house Saturday night,<br/>
taken directly to the hospital and the word that came out<br/>
of the hospital was that they were quote&quot; in good<br/>
condition&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
F: Did they force vaccinations or anything on those kids<br/>
that had otherwise been disallowed by their family?<br/>
<br/>
S: They haven&#39;t announced that, but, what do you think??F:<br/>
I think that probabaly they did.<br/>
<br/>
S: If they were in good condition after 5 days being hold<br/>
up in the bathroom , WHICH is where they WERE, because they<br/>
were convinced that any moment the storm troopers were<br/>
going to break in and kill them. The same way that they<br/>
thought their mother was already dead! SO, AFTER 5 days of<br/>
THAT, they are in good shape..clearly...what WAS the felony<br/>
injury to these children for which she was originally<br/>
arrested??S: It&#39;s not real clear, but it appears that it&#39;s<br/>
the oldest daughter, Erina (sp??)who had returned from out<br/>
of town, was somewhat estranged from the family,and<br/>
contacted the local authorities.....they were on the outs<br/>
because they considered that she had abandoned them because<br/>
she left home just as the father was really sinking into<br/>
the final part of his illness.<br/>
<br/>
F:...So, we need you the MOST, and YOU&#39;RE gone!<br/>
<br/>
F: The property. Who bought it?<br/>
<br/>
S: It was bought in May 25, 1999, by Bonner County for<br/>
$8700.00 in back taxes. A year and 3 months later, Bonner<br/>
County then sold it to some people with the last name<br/>
Korengutt(CHECK SPELLING!), who we have not been able to<br/>
track down.<br/>
<br/>
F: I called JT Deihl&#39;s office several times, he refuses to<br/>
return my calls. What do you know about him?<br/>
<br/>
S: YOU TOO!! He won&#39;t talk to me either.<br/>
<br/>
F: It looks to me like there was a little , uh, of &quot;help my<br/>
friends make money&quot; deal goin&#39; on here, but I can&#39;t prove<br/>
it until I find the evidence.<br/>
<br/>
S: Yea, it would be inappropriate to speculate in that<br/>
regard, however, it stinks to high heaven.<br/>
<br/>
F: Did the McGuckins own the property?<br/>
<br/>
S: Yes, free and clear, worth half million dollars,<br/>
minimum, it&#39;s gorgeous property.<br/>
<br/>
F: So, we KNOW what the motivation is, we just have to find<br/>
the evidence. How about redemption laws in Idaho?<br/>
<br/>
S: Idaho has a one year redemption law. It&#39;s cut off once<br/>
the county vends the property, so it was cut off when they<br/>
sold it to these Korengutts. However, my staff and my<br/>
lawyers and investigators have been booking on this, even<br/>
over the weekends since I&#39;ve been in exile as the lawyer,<br/>
and we&#39;ve identified a number of points upon which we feel<br/>
we can not only file a lawsuit but survive demurers<br/>
(sp!!)and we think that there is a reasonable chance of<br/>
success in undoing this sale.<br/>
<br/>
F: Have you looked at the federal law?<br/>
<br/>
S: ..There are federal statutes, I think the most<br/>
interesting one regards the violation of her CIVIL RIGHTS.<br/>
<br/>
F: My focus would be to generate revenue by using the<br/>
national show and asking people to donate to the trust<br/>
fund, if the money was going to be used for something we<br/>
could all be sure of.<br/>
<br/>
S: Well, the money&#39;s been coming in, my wife added it up<br/>
tonight, comes out like $2500.00 that came in over the last<br/>
2 days and my prime motivation in calling you up was to say<br/>
THANK YOU for publicising it and to thank your listeners<br/>
for being so kind. AND I want to guarantee you, I will<br/>
PERSONALLY see, with my last dying breath that every penny<br/>
of this goes to JoAnn. There will NOT be any of this paid<br/>
EVER to any lawyer or ANY court, as long as I breathe.<br/>
