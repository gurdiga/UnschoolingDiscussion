Subject: My response to HONDA<br/>
<br/>
There are many reasons to be concerned about the HONDA bill. Perhaps <br/>
first and foremost is the fact that this bill opens the door to <br/>
federal regulation of homeschooling and creates the potential for <br/>
additional legislation and increased regulation. Once passed, this <br/>
bill becomes law. And once it is law the agencies responsible for <br/>
enforcing compliance with the law will write regulations based on <br/>
their interpretations of it; those regulations will be written by <br/>
people who may or may not have a good understanding of homeschooling, <br/>
but they&#39;ll be regulations with the force of law behind them. The <br/>
potential for conflict and years of working to clarify intent is <br/>
tremendous.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship between homeschoolers and the state differs from <br/>
state to state and is the result of many years of citizen involvement <br/>
with the  legislative process. While some states still have difficult <br/>
situations, in many others years of hard work by homeschoolers would <br/>
stand to be undermined by this bill. In some states there are strong <br/>
support groups in place to act as watchdogs and oversee what might <br/>
happen as a result of this bill. But what will happen in those states <br/>
without cohesive homeschool support groups?<br/>
<br/>
The claim in Sec. 2 that homeschooling is &quot;an effective means for <br/>
young people to achieve success on standardized tests&quot; is downright <br/>
foolish. What purpose could possibly be served by linking <br/>
homeschooling with standardized testing in federal legislation?<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, this is a poorly written omnibus bill which messes with <br/>
multiple issues such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education <br/>
Act (IDEA), the Internal Revenue Code and federal tax issues, child <br/>
labor laws, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), a <br/>
federal scholarship program and more - but addresses them as they <br/>
specifically relate to homeschoolers. These are issues which - if <br/>
addressed at all - should be more broadly addressed, and should <br/>
guarantee equal rights and services for everyone rather than asking <br/>
for special favors specifically for homeschoolers. We do not need <br/>
these issues addressed in our name, because we do not need to become <br/>
a special interest group in the eyes of federal legislators.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s an even larger question to ask, and that is: Why the move <br/>
to strengthen the power of the federal government over what has <br/>
always been a state concern? Constitutionally, education is the <br/>
province of the states, and bills like this one force a conflict <br/>
between the federal government and state governments.<br/>
<br/>
Whose long-range purposes are really being served with this bill?<br/>

Hello,<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve posted this message before on this board so please<br/>
bare with me if I have.<br/>
<br/>
 We live in New York State and my sons are home schooled.  The high school<br/>
varsity baseball coach is trying to recruit them for his team. As far as I<br/>
know they are not eligible to play on high school teams. However, I found<br/>
the information below on the Home School Legal Defense Association&#39;s website<br/>
and now I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re eligible or not. Can someone clear this up<br/>
for me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 What I&#39;m really trying to find out is where I can find the information<br/>
from the report that states that a:<br/>
  &quot;bona fide student, enrolled during the first 15 days of such semester,<br/>
is registered in the equivalent of three regular courses, is meeting the<br/>
physical education requirement, and has been in regular attendance 80<br/>
percent of the school time.&quot; can play interscholastic sports on the public<br/>
school team. I cannot find it in the NYS education laws anywhere. Maybe I&#39;m<br/>
looking in all the wrong places.<br/>
<br/>
 I tried to email HSLDA but unless you&#39;re a member you can&#39;t email them.<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve contacted NYS non-public school about this report but I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
conflicting answers. Before I go to our superintendent regarding this I<br/>
would like to have the information from the NYS ed. laws myself. I&#39;ve even<br/>
contacted New York State Public High School Athletic Assoc. but they haven&#39;t<br/>
replied yet.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks again. Any help would be appreciated.<br/>

Subject: Homeschoolers in Bowie, MD?<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I know I have been pretty quiet on this list so let me<br/>
re-introduce myself.  I am a hs mom of 3.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
homeschooling over a year, almost two and using the<br/>
Calvert curriculum.  I am concerned about my kids<br/>
having friends besides their brothers and sister.  I<br/>
have been having a hard time finding other<br/>
homeschoolers in the area.  I know &quot;socialization&quot; is<br/>
always in the backs of homeschoolers&#39; minds, but it<br/>
can be a real fear for some, especially the not very<br/>
outgoing people. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there are any other homeschoolers<br/>
in Bowie?  I was also wondering if there are any<br/>
special homeschooling days at the ice rink, gym, etc. <br/>
If not, do you want to try and start one?  <br/>
<br/>
In the fall, when school goes back in session, I was<br/>
thinking on starting up a Park day, get-together day,<br/>
etc.  Let me know if anyone is interested.  You can<br/>
email me privately or on list if you would like.<br/>
<br/>
If you have nay other ideas, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
=====<br/>

Show me, and I may not remember.<br/>
Involve me, and I&#39;ll understand.<br/>

Two questions at the heart of the issue are: First, how much<br/>
authority should the government have over what some consider a<br/>
private issue? And second, who has the ultimate responsibility for<br/>
ensuring home-schooled students meet their potential?<br/>

My question: Is this a common attitude or an anomaly amongst<br/>
homeschoolers?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got to type and run but I wanted to say that I don&#39;t think government<br/>
should have the final word.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;It is better to tolerate that rare instance of a parent&#39;s refusing to let<br/>
his child be educated, than to shock the common feelings by a forcible<br/>
transportation and education of the infant against the will of his father.&quot;<br/>

And, since when is it anyone&#39;s responsibility to ensure anyone meets his or<br/>
her &#39;potential?&#39;  That word plagued me throughout my school &#39;career&#39; because<br/>
I never measured up to it.  From whatever test I was given in 1st grade<br/>
until I got the diploma I was hounded by people wanting me to work up to my<br/>
wretched potential (the anomaly was poor grades contrasted against excellent<br/>
standardized test scores).  I didn&#39;t make &#39;them&#39; happy and &#39;they&#39; certainly<br/>
didn&#39;t make me happy.  Enforced meeting of a &quot;potential?&quot;  Pah!<br/>

Subject: Re: Living up to ones potential<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve alaways hated that phrase -- living up to your potential -- along with<br/>
its comanion word -- underachiever.  These are some of the most destructive<br/>
and abusive phrases used on children -- and they can have a lifelong impact!<br/>
I was labeled an underachiever almost as soon as I started school.  I<br/>
constantly heard that I was not living up to my potential, that my test<br/>
scores indicated that I should be working a year ort two above grade level.<br/>
None of my teachers was bright enough to realize that I was a year younger<br/>
than all my classmates -- I started school when I was 4 -- and therefore<br/>
automatically working above grade level.  My fourth grade teacher gave me<br/>
C&#39;s on all my math papers -- I got all the problems correct but she said I<br/>
was able to do sixth grade work so it wasn&#39;t fair to give me the same grade<br/>
as the other kids in the class -- for the same work.  I was -- of course --<br/>
never given the opportunity to do 6th grade work that year -- but......  An<br/>
honors math teacher at the highschool in our neighborhood -- we know him<br/>
well -- uses the same book and assignments for his honors classes as for his<br/>
regular classes -- but gives the honors students one letter grade lower --<br/>
hurting their chances to get into college.  It all just drives me crazy.<br/>
