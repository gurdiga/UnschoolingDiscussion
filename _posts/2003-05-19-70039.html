<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287941492">Yipppeee! This has been our first year at unschooling. We went for our<br/>
first homeschool assessment and everything went very well! The woman<br/>
actually said I had too much information and kept very good records of<br/>
what my two boys and I had done for unschooling. I am  SO relieved that<br/>
the process went so well. <br/>
When I first wrote in to this group it was with a sad heart. My 15 year<br/>
old has dyslexia and being at public school had caused a mood disorder.<br/>
He has learned more in the passed few months than he did the last 4<br/>
years at public school. I am so happy. We are all so happy. He is calm<br/>
95% of the time. He is able to learn and enjoy it at the same time. I am<br/>
so grateful for this site. It was what I had prayed for and was guided<br/>
to, I believe. Thank you. Michele<br/>

I got that my first couple of years of hsing (I&#39;ve slipped through <br/>
the cracks and haven&#39;t been visited in 4 years).<br/>
I had so much to show the HS evaluator.  He told me I was doing more <br/>
than needed.  Hah!  We were just living.  <br/>
I thought about it.  A regular school teacher would only have to show <br/>
maybe 5 or 6 references in different subjects to seem sufficient.<br/>
I had atleast 25 different things to show this guy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305694892">Oh Michele -- I got chills reading this. For some reason I am REALLY  <br/>
touched by the stories of teenagers who are so unhappy and miserable  <br/>
and troubled in school and I&#39;m just so thrilled when I hear of parents  <br/>
getting their kids OUT and things getting better!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and kudos to you for being brave and taking charge!!!<br/>
