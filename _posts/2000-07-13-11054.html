<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174026302">Hi Tia!<br/>
<br/>
I can only comment on the Fibromyalgia and cold weather...Symptoms are<br/>
appreciably lessened in cooler climes.  Heat can kill you!  I know this<br/>
because despite our sometimes baking-hot summers (we&#39;re currently<br/>
enjoying 90 degree temps), our winters can be fowl.  It sometimes can<br/>
get to 40 below...and my husband and others I know who suffer from<br/>
Fibromyalgia are much more comfortable.  No one likes it THAT cold, but<br/>
anything below zero is usually an improvement.<br/>

&gt; DH is applying for 3 jobs in Alaska.   (We NEED a job, I might add...almost a<br/>

&gt; Inlet, the other two are rotational on the north slope.  I anticipate that<br/>

&gt; (or not) any suggestions on what to expect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand the homeschool laws are quite favorable in AK.  We&#39;ve wanted to<br/>
&gt; move there for over 20 years and it appears to be a real possibility this<br/>
&gt; time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What can you tell me about actual living conditions?  What to look out for<br/>
&gt; and what to look forward to?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a medical condition...FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome).  If anyone has<br/>
&gt; first hand experience on how living in very cold weather affects them or<br/>
&gt; someone they know with FMS, that would be very helpful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cost of living...I understand is high...?  Is housing hard to find?  I would<br/>
&gt; assume homes are pretty well insulated against the cold?  We would have to<br/>
&gt; rent, if that makes any difference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure there are zillions of questions I should ask, but beyond these, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know where to start!  so, any information is helpful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Yesterday, the eletric co had a pole go down around<br/>
the corner from my house. We were w/o for 1.5 hrs in<br/>
the mid afternoon. My house temp rose 15-20 degrees in<br/>
that time and didn&#39;t cool off till well after sundown<br/>
last night. I keep the a.c. between 70 and 75<br/>
otherwise I break a sweat sitting on the couch. Of<br/>
course being pg doesn&#39;t help but still.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just wanted to know before I inform you about<br/>
humidity. I have lived here since I was 4yo. I have<br/>
been to AZ and I would prefer 109 in AZ to 85 in humid<br/>
Houston any day. When I was there once and did not<br/>
break a sweat the whole time and we had to walk<br/>
everywhere we went. I was on a church trip there as a<br/>
youth and had traveled by bus. If we wanted to go<br/>
anywhere the group wasn&#39;t going we walked. I was<br/>
amazed when I looked up at temp on the bank and it was<br/>
102. Here in Houston at 85 you walk outside and it is<br/>
like walking into a sauna literaly. You walk outside<br/>
and there is instantly moistur on your skin. Many days<br/>
we have humidity in the 80-90%. I guess if you go to<br/>
your gym and walk into the dry sauna and then walk<br/>
into the wet sauna you can get a pretty accurate idea<br/>
of the difference between dry 109 and humid 85.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m getting off my tirant now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16670189">Hi There!<br/>
<br/>
We are not currently in Alaska right now but I was born and raised in Alaska <br/>
so I figured I just HAD to answer this one!!! &lt;big grin because she LOVES to <br/>
talk about AK&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;One job is on Cook<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Inlet, the other two are rotational on the north slope.  I anticipate that<br/>
&gt;both north slope jobs would have him going alone and flying home during <br/>
&gt;time<br/>
&gt;off.  Having never been there or done this sort of thing, I&#39;d be interested<br/>
&gt;if anyone has info on whether that is typically how things are done and if <br/>
&gt;so<br/>
&gt;(or not) any suggestions on what to expect.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not sure how that kind of employment works but from what I understand <br/>
that is VERY common in Alaska and the pay is GREAT!   However Jobs like that <br/>
are also usually seasonal so SAVE SOME MONEY!  My DH&#39;s little Brother works <br/>
for VECO which is an oil company.  He spends a month on the slope then a <br/>
week at home and goes back up but that is how he choses to do it, Im not <br/>
sure that that is the regular way it goes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I understand the homeschool laws are quite favorable in AK.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes!!  AK has some of the best homeschooling laws I have seen.   You are <br/>
free to homeschool your child in AK however you see fit. NO STRINGS <br/>
ATTATCHED.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;What can you tell me about actual living conditions?  What to look out for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and what to look forward to?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as living conditions go, I lived in some pretty crappy places right <br/>
after hubby and I got married and I was never COLD.  Most houses are VERY <br/>
well insulated.   If you live in the lower half of the state the cold isn&#39;t <br/>
really that bad as it is a DRY cold instead of a Wet cold that gets you to <br/>
your bones.  The weather in my hometown (Wasilla) can get pretty cold but <br/>
buy a good coat and some snow boots and you will be just fine. (Gloves would <br/>
be a good idea too) Alaska has become very commercialized in the past decade <br/>
so you can also get anything you need there.  In fact I found more shopping <br/>
opportunities there than I did after moving stateside!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I have a medical condition...FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome)&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really do not know anything about this but my Mom  works in the medical <br/>
field in AK and I could ask her if she knows anything about how the weather <br/>
might affect that if you want me to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Cost of living...I understand is high...? &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in some cases the cost of living is high but I have found that it is <br/>
not extravigantly higher except for housing prices.   I had a one room <br/>
apartment in AK that was $625.00  a month in rent in AK, but had a 3 bedroom <br/>
in Arkansas for $350.00   However that is why you make more money in AK to <br/>
compensate for that.   For Grocery stores ect.  I really didn&#39;t  notice too <br/>
much of a difference in prices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Is housing hard to find?  I would<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;assume homes are pretty well insulated against the cold?  We would have to<br/>
&gt;rent, if that makes any difference.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like I said earlier, the houses are very well insulated with most having <br/>
good heaters.  I would reccomend AGAINST a trailer if you were considering <br/>
it.  They seem to have a lot of fires in trailers.   Anyway, The economy is <br/>
booming in AK right now so finding a place to live should be an easy task.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I&#39;m sure there are zillions of questions I should ask,&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ask away!!   You may e-mail me personally at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HollyAtch@...">HollyAtch@...</a> if you <br/>
want to.  I will be more than happy to answer any and all of your AK  <br/>
questions because I love talking about my home state!!!<br/>
