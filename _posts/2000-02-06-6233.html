You mentioned looking for books that are good learning books, but not<br/>
textbooks... I have a huge collection of books from Dorling-Kindersley (DK).<br/>
You might not recognize the name, but you&#39;d recognize the books in the<br/>
store. They are filled with wonderful photographs, lots of facts, and are<br/>
very interesting! As for &quot;quick question answers&quot; - I have their<br/>
encyclopedia. I own Encarta on CD, and always said I&#39;d never purchase an<br/>
encyclopedia in print after they came out with update-able CDs, but I bought<br/>
this one - it has so many great photographs, and whenever we look something<br/>
up, we end up stopping at another dozen pages along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, books I am reading myself - I have always been a big Michael<br/>
Crichton fan, and after finishing &quot;Timeline&quot; earlier than expected on a<br/>
recent trip, I picked up a book of his called &quot;Travels&quot; - stories about the<br/>
places he has traveled. Very interesting and well written!  I just started<br/>
John Grisham&#39;s &quot;Brethren&quot; too.  I am also reading &quot;Seasons of a Mother&#39;s<br/>
Heart,&quot; by Sally Clarkson (great book for anyone who is a mother, a<br/>
Christian and/or a homeschooler).  I&#39;m about to read &quot;Carolinas & Georgia&quot;<br/>
by Frommer&#39;s, since I&#39;m going to Myrtle Beach for a week on Feb. 19.  Next<br/>
on my list are &quot;Honey, Are You Listening? - How Attention Deficit Disorder<br/>
Could Be Affecting Your Marriage,&quot; by Dr. Rick Fowler & Jerilyn Fowler, and<br/>
&quot;Watch It Made in the USA - a Visitor&#39;s Guide to the Companies That Make<br/>
Your Favorite Products,&quot; by Bruce Brumberg & Karen Axelrod.  My daughter and<br/>
I are also reading the second Harry Potter book together (by J.K. Rowling).<br/>
<br/>
One last item - my family and I just got back from a 2-week trip to Arizona.<br/>
I always keep a travel journal when we travel, for family memories, as well<br/>
as our homeschooling portfolio.  It&#39;s 44 pages in Microsoft Word - if you&#39;re<br/>
interested, I could either post it to the whole group, or email it to<br/>
individuals.  Let me know if you&#39;d like to read it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree totally about joining a museum did that out west in AZ and had<br/>
&gt; &gt; learning adventures no amount of money could replace!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Volunteering is really the untapped education resource.  Many people after<br/>
&gt; tiring of extortionate tuition bills may find their way to this free and<br/>
&gt; amazing resource which in some cases may be superior to sitting in class<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; taking tests.<br/>

&gt;   &lt;&lt; So IS this what &quot;we&quot; are doing?  Keeping the needs<br/>
&gt;   of our children upfront and foremost..allowing them<br/>
&gt;   to develop at their pace...providing quidance, love<br/>
&gt;   support...I understand that some parents don&#39;t take<br/>
&gt;   the role of a parent as seriously as I/we  do..so does<br/>
&gt;   that make me someone who can be labeled as one who<br/>
&gt;   believes in &quot;attachment parenting&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yes these all sound good!  Most people when they speak<br/>
&gt;   of attachment parenting, they are talking about a lifestyle term that<br/>
&gt;   was coined by Dr. Bill and Martha Sears, pediatrician, La Leche<br/>
&gt;   League Leader and parents to eight children.  Many people think<br/>
&gt;   of AP (attachment parenting) as natural parenting, and often this<br/>
&gt;   type of parenting can be found in non-industrialized cultures and<br/>
&gt;   considered the norm.  Most Americans practicing AP start from<br/>
&gt;   birth, looking to birth their children in the gentle environment,<br/>
&gt;   breastfeeding and sleep sharing, and carrying your baby/child in<br/>
&gt;   a sling or in arms.  Crying it out and physical punishment<br/>
&gt;   are not considered AP.  You do not have to have done all of the<br/>
&gt;   above practices to be AP I believe, (example; some women may not have<br/>
had<br/>
&gt;   all the correct information or support to breastfeed their child, but<br/>
practice<br/>
&gt;   other attachment/bonding practices).  In turn these practices help you<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   your child become in tune with each other, so you can better parent etc.<br/>
&gt;   There are tons of sites on the<br/>
&gt;   web where you can learn more about this.  Hope this helps! ps. I think<br/>
that<br/>
&gt;   homeschooling/unschooling is a very natural progression from and early<br/>
&gt;   APing lifestyle.<br/>

&gt; Thank you for the info.  I subscribed, but looking at the zone map, I had<br/>
&gt; a difficult time telling if I am in zone 8 or 9.  I am in southern<br/>
California,<br/>
&gt; Riverside county/Corona specifically.  Is anyone in this area who knows<br/>
&gt; there gardening zones?  thanks!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had to blink and read again when I saw this, cos I&#39;ve gone through this<br/>
last year, I think I&#39;m on the way over it, but it remains to be seem :-)  I<br/>
knew moving would be difficult, since the house was not my choice and would<br/>
not have been my choice, but I was not prepared for the depths of depression<br/>
I went in last year, mostly, if not all, house-related.  Took me a while to<br/>
figure out that I was grieving!  Thanks for affirming my self-diagnosis!!<br/>

&gt;   Hi Sandi<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &lt;cut&gt; everyone seemed fine.  Our discussions over the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for<br/>
them<br/>
&gt;   &gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has<br/>
wanted for<br/>
&gt;   always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and<br/>
it<br/>
&gt;   emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a<br/>
major<br/>
&gt;   grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left<br/>
behind. The<br/>
&gt;   2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it<br/>
better -<br/>
&gt;   perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>
&gt;   &gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>
&gt;   &gt; choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so<br/>
many<br/>
&gt;   areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our<br/>
children<br/>
&gt;   choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow<br/>
children<br/>
&gt;   &gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>
&gt;   &gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the<br/>
swing<br/>
&gt;   rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Carol<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have an Iain M Banks novel sitting on the office windowsill waiting to<br/>
be read :-)  I bought it for Father&#39;s Day (or birthday, can&#39;t remember which<br/>
:-) ) last year, and dh loved it, but I&#39;ve yet to read it :-)  I need to<br/>
start reading breastfeeding and ap-type books again, since my LLL<br/>
application is getting a kick up the bottom now &lt;g&gt;  I have a second-hand<br/>
copy of a book on gardening with mulch, rather than compost, which I like, I<br/>
think it&#39;s called the No Work Garden, or something like that!  (On the side<br/>
topic of gardening, I got the phone number today of someone local who<br/>
supplies mushroom compost for gardens, will be phoning them on Monday...)<br/>
The last book I read was A Little Princess, I think, oh, hang on, no it was<br/>
a Terry Pratchett Discworld novel from the library!  Anything else?  Don&#39;t<br/>
think so!  99.9% of our books are packed up in boxes in the garage or at my<br/>
mother&#39;s since moving last year, so when I get them out again, I may be<br/>
reading some more.  Will probably re-read Lord of the Rings before the first<br/>
film comes out.  OK, that&#39;s me done (for now &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

&gt;   I&#39;m willing to bet that another thing we all have in common, is that we<br/>
&gt;   are all avid readers.  After the discussion of Amelia Peabody, I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt;   to hear more.  What else do you like to read?  Favorite authors ect..<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m reading my first Amelia Peabody.  Just started it.  I can tell I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;   like it already.<br/>
&gt;   Here are some of my favorites.<br/>
&gt;   For mystery (my favorite) I love Ruth Rendell.  She has an Inspector<br/>
&gt;   Wexford series as well as others.  I also like Martha Grimes.  She too<br/>
&gt;   has a series with the same characters.    I also love to read the Emily<br/>
&gt;   Pollifax series.  Why can&#39;t I think of the author??<br/>
&gt;   I think outside of mystery I really love May Sarton.  I think she has<br/>
&gt;   one called &quot;Full Circle&quot;.<br/>
&gt;   Right now I&#39;m reading a book by the Dali Lama or rather a phd and him<br/>
&gt;   called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;.  It is wonderful.  I love his philosophy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   So, what are all of you reading?<br/>
&gt;   Ann<br/>

&gt;   Another Anne McCaffrey fan!  I have all the books on Pern, and a couple<br/>
of the Rowan series, can&#39;t remember the exact titles right now.  I like<br/>
David Eddings&#39; stuff too.  Not a fantasy nut at all!!<br/>

&gt;   &gt;I LOOOOOOVE that book!  DH and I read it together.  I have the utmost<br/>
&gt;   respect for him.  I was fortunate enough to meet him in person and talk<br/>
&gt;   with him, and he exudes such a magical aura.  He has a presence that can<br/>
be<br/>
&gt;   felt and really affects you when you are near him.  He truly is &quot;an<br/>
&gt;   elightened being.&quot;<br/>

&gt;   Oops!  and I forgot!  What books do I like to read.  I really enjoy<br/>
fiction<br/>
&gt;   as a way to de-stress and escape for me.  I love Anne McCaffrey, David<br/>
&gt;   Brin, Orson Scott Card, Anne Rice, Jean M. Auel, and R. A. Salvatore for<br/>
&gt;   starters.  Of course I am always Unschooling, so I read any number of<br/>
other<br/>
&gt;   spiritual, parenting, psychology, comparative religious, and adoption<br/>
books<br/>
&gt;   (just right now.)<br/>

&gt; I am on an anthropological quest as I am dealing with those negative folks<br/>
who worry about my kids missing out on all that &quot;socialization&quot; they get in<br/>
school.<br/>
&gt; Do you guys  feel that our society over values or emphasizes this value to<br/>
an extreme degree not natural for all esp. in an institutional setting?<br/>
&gt; Up here in  New England they are penalized for even being a minute late<br/>
getting in the classroom. I think we may always be late to things we just<br/>
don&#39;t enjoy but even getting to work on time is not something my DH is good<br/>
at even though he likes going to work most days. I look forward to not<br/>
having to be on time for school every morning. Am I teaching negative values<br/>
or just that being on time isn&#39;t as important as sense of self? Socializing<br/>
by being silent and still in a group setting as in the military is also<br/>
against my core beliefs. I am sure all cultures have their peer pressures. I<br/>
am happy that in this day and age we don&#39;t have to give in to any peer<br/>
pressure of any kind  and really know freedom is there something wrong with<br/>
this that I am missing?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The type of socialization you mentioned is valuable in my opinion,<br/>
especially if the following are all you want your kids to be about:  being<br/>
popular, egotisical, getting into the right college, driving an expensive<br/>
car, getting a high paying yes man job, marrying into the right family,<br/>
knowing all the right people, avoiding the wrong people like the plague,<br/>
keeping up with the Joneses and so on and so on until they retire right<br/>
before they die from the stress and then realize they don&#39;t have a clue who<br/>
they are and just spend the rest of their days in front of the TV set.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not me, and not you guys, or you probably wouldn&#39;t be on this list  :)<br/>

&gt; Sorry, it just came out!   LOL<br/>

&gt; &gt; It seems a lot of people think a better school is more strict, &quot;has<br/>
&gt; &gt; higher standards&quot;.  I met a mom who is very proud that her kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; kindergarten class is so strict bc the children know what the rules<br/>
&gt; &gt; are????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i went to a b-day party for a 4 yo recently,  all the other kids there met<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; daycare,  we were the only homeschoolers.  i found the dynamic between the<br/>
&gt; parents and kids really distant, not without love but without closeness.<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; parent would stand back and say things like &#39;now uses your words&#39; and the<br/>
&gt; kids would be fighting over the toys.  it was odd to me (not the fighting<br/>
&gt; part:),  the kids do their thing and the parents do theirs and &#39;never the<br/>
&gt; &#39;twain shall meet&#39; just bridged by a bit of vocalization.  it made me<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; that people keep themselves so busy so they don&#39;t have to see what&#39;s<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; happening and if something bad happens they have a good excuse - they were<br/>
&gt; too busy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i have a thing about controlling kids.  boundaries are great but control<br/>
is a<br/>
&gt; different story.  i didn&#39;t give birth to prove to the world i can spawn<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; greatest person that ever lived (though rene&#39; (4) informed me last night<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; he wants to become &#39;a legend&#39; -i&#39;m not completely convinced he clearly<br/>
&gt; understands what that is &lt;lol&gt;) or the most obedient or the kid with the<br/>
best<br/>
&gt; manners or any other of their silly accolades.  i did gave birth to<br/>
&gt; experience the joy of watching a person develop and find happiness in<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; everyday life and to be of whatever assistance i am able.  i believe<br/>
&gt; compassion and good manners are very helpful but only if it is done with<br/>
&gt; sincerity not coercion.  this is my problem with schools.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i would be interested in how others step out of the way of their kids and<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; pass on all the issue based in social conformity.  from what i&#39;ve seen<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; of the greatest injustices perpetrated against kids is in the name of<br/>
social<br/>
&gt; conformity.  my son is out spoken - for the good or the bad - i make sure<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; knows his voice carries weight.  i also let him know when he&#39;s driving me<br/>
&gt; nuts with his incessant talking.   i do not use the word &#39;incessant&#39;<br/>
lightly<br/>
&gt; - he will talk to anyone anytime for as long as they will sit there.  i<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; not even count the number of picnics of total strangers (more often than<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; adult only) he has invited himself to.  he just parks himself without ever<br/>
&gt; questioning whether he would be wanted, in his mind of course they would<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to hear what he has to say:)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i am not embarrassed by anything he does.  at first i was tempted to feel<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; was a reflection of me and i would be judged by other because of his<br/>
&gt; behavior,  but you know so what.  i know people judge,  their thoughts are<br/>
&gt; so &#39;loud&#39; you can&#39;t help but know.  what i&#39;ve found is,  trying to control<br/>
&gt; (the use of rules) kids or anyone,  sets you up for a power struggle then<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; have to ask yourself &#39;is this really the kind of relationship i want?&#39; and<br/>
&#39;<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t this just what i have with my parents (or any other person trying to<br/>
&gt; have power of you)?&#39;  for me the answers are no and yes respectively.  so<br/>
i<br/>
&gt; accept that i&#39;m breaking with all my &#39;role models&#39; and that leaves me with<br/>
&gt; always (at least for now:) having to know why i do what i do and making<br/>
&gt; conscious choices so i don&#39;t fall back into repeating what was done to me<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; i must afford this right to my kids.  now that i&#39;ve been able to make the<br/>
&gt; transition i feel life doesn&#39;t need to be scheduled or planned or have a<br/>
&gt; curriculum to succeed and prosper and be happy but just conscious and<br/>
sincere<br/>
&gt; involvement is needed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; the other thing i wanted to touch on is that there has been a lot of<br/>
&gt; discussion about waldorf, which to be honest i only lightly touched on as<br/>
far<br/>
&gt; as reading the emails.  it&#39;s not a big interest of mine though they do<br/>
&gt; provide nice products albeit a bit expensive but very good quality.   i<br/>
&gt; looked into becoming a waldorf teacher when i lived in northern cal.  but<br/>
&gt; backed away.  for me it&#39;s too structured and imposes a reality on to the<br/>
&gt; environment rather than allowing one to develop of it&#39;s own accord.   i&#39;m<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; as well read on the specific differences between these philosophies<br/>
because i<br/>
&gt; make mine up as i go and find i&#39;m much happier doing it that way.   it&#39;s<br/>
hard<br/>
&gt; for me to conform to even the alternative methods and this is why i&#39;m on<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; list because for me unschooling is more of a philosophical base and<br/>
methods<br/>
&gt; such as waldorf are more of a structure you &#39;live&#39; in.  just some thoughts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;  I also know two hs families who live right next to a school.  They use<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; i looked into becoming a waldorf teacher when i lived in northern cal.<br/>
but backed away.  for me it&#39;s too structured and imposes a reality on to the<br/>
environment rather than allowing one to develop of it&#39;s own accord.   i&#39;m<br/>
not as well read on the specific differences between these philosophies<br/>
because i make mine up as i go and find i&#39;m much happier doing it that way.<br/>
it&#39;s hard for me to conform to even the alternative methods and this is why<br/>
i&#39;m on this list because for me unschooling is more of a philosophical base<br/>
and methods such as waldorf are more of a structure you &#39;live&#39; in.  just<br/>
some thoughts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Susan I am in agreement with you too about the structure of the Waldorf<br/>
way I just like to borrow from what I have appreciated about them esp. their<br/>
books and art. I would have preferred to become a Waldorf teacher as opposed<br/>
to a regular elem. teacher in the olden days because I would have liked to<br/>
further develop that artist that I was ( I realize I still can blossom at<br/>
home along side my own children) I think lots of parents have trouble out<br/>
there in Waldorf land and still have to worry about the &quot;waldorf police&quot; who<br/>
have in some cases literally gone after them! I had a bad experience looking<br/>
into being a teacher at Antioch was totally dissed by the woman who ran the<br/>
program and I was over the age of 35 at the time I looked into it.<br/>
&gt; I have also gone to Hampshire College a great place for nonconforming<br/>
&#39;unschoolers&quot; if you can afford it. I think they give scholarships nowadays.<br/>
I had trouble with the drug culture that was there but hopefully those days<br/>
are gone.<br/>
&gt; Tell us more about your son he sounds so vibrant and full of self esteem!<br/>

&gt; Hi all....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ( hey Lyn ;-))<br/>
&gt;  I just want to introduce myself here....<br/>
&gt;  My name is Joshua and I have two boys going on 6 and 8 who &quot;unschool&quot;<br/>
&gt; as near as I can tell.  I am the &quot;stay at home parent&quot;, as my wife works<br/>
full time. We withdrew our boys form school over the Christmas break, so we<br/>
are only a month into this.<br/>
&gt;  Of course I have been going through questions about to what extent to<br/>
utilize curriculum materials etc. and how to structure our &quot;schooldays&quot;.  My<br/>
wife would be much happier I think if we created an in home replica of a<br/>
school classroom and followed a good curriculum, but it is just what I<br/>
desire for us.  Intuitively I have always known learning didnt need to be<br/>
confined to &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
&gt;  I didn&#39;t know it was called &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I am happy to find lots of<br/>
other people &quot;out there&quot; educationg their children at home by just living<br/>
full inquisitive lives.<br/>
&gt;  I look forward to having such a lorge list of experienced people to glean<br/>

&gt; Subject: We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We Want Our Children to Be Suckers!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes.  That&#39;s right.  We hope our children become real suckers.  And we<br/>
also<br/>
&gt; want them to be suck-sessful adults.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We derived our non-traditional definition of sucker from Henry David<br/>
Thoreau<br/>
&gt; &#39;s words in his classic Walden.  He wrote that he &quot;...went to the woods to<br/>
&gt; live deliberately...to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A sucker single-mindedly goes after that marrow.  A sucker hungers for<br/>
&gt; knowledge.  A sucker notes the changes of seasons, the migration of birds,<br/>
&gt; the budding of flowers, the artistry of the morning dew.  A sucker is as<br/>
&gt; comfortable with the technology of the present as the wisdom of the ages.<br/>
A<br/>
&gt; sucker is deeply moved in the face of human triumph or tragedy.  A sucker<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; all there, fully awake, completely embracing all that life has to offer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sound like a worthy goal for children?  We think so.  Here are three steps<br/>
&gt; to help children learn to be suckers:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Be a sucker yourself<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Model a passion for learning.  Be open-minded.  Try new things all of the<br/>
&gt; time.  Focus on stockpiling experiences rather than material objects.<br/>
&gt; Travel slowly, stopping and lingering along the way.  Chat with the people<br/>
&gt; you meet.  Savor your food.  Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.  Pick the minds of<br/>
&gt; people who know the ropes.  Enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Become adept at<br/>
&gt; looking through telescopes, microscopes, and just under your nose.  When<br/>
&gt; your children see how much fun you&#39;re having, nothing will stop them from<br/>
&gt; joining in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Give children time and space<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Overscheduling our children&#39;s lives may make them into &quot;successes&quot; in the<br/>
&gt; eyes of the world, but it won&#39;t help them to be suckers. For that you&#39;ve<br/>
got<br/>
&gt; to leave them alone.  Let them build their play forts, play their street<br/>
&gt; games, and experiment in the kitchen.  Encourage creativity.  Expose them<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the very best in life and let them choose what they want.  Give them the<br/>
&gt; tinder and matches, but let them light their own fires of passion.  The<br/>
&gt; ability to suck the marrow out of life comes slowly over many years.  So<br/>
don<br/>
&gt; &#39;t expect immediate, quantifiable results.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Seek inspiration from other suckers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mandy and I place our faith in the premise that &quot;a sucker is born every<br/>
&gt; minute.&quot;  We believe that everyone can be a sucker, but too many get lured<br/>
&gt; away from that. They may be led to believe that happiness has to do with<br/>
&gt; money, status, or position.  Far too often those pursuits engulf lives,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; distract would-be suckers from the path.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On a positive note, you can find real suckers everywhere.  They are the<br/>
ones<br/>
&gt; who are involved and active.  They are multi-faceted people, always<br/>
&gt; learning, always growing, always changing.  Such people need to be  your<br/>
&gt; lifelines.  You can also read about great suckers in history; people who<br/>
did<br/>
&gt; extraordinary things, who were committed to living each day to the<br/>
fullest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The lifelong quest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Suck-sess has to do with cutting through the veneer of life and getting at<br/>
&gt; its essence.  It has to do with throwing out agendas and living<br/>
&gt; spontaneously.   It&#39;s about bringing our exterior world in harmony with<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; interior.  It&#39;s about reducing our baggage.  It&#39;s about getting wrapped up<br/>
&gt; in the ecstasy of the moment rather than postponing happiness for a later<br/>
&gt; date.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a nutshell, suck-sess is the nectar of life.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re so<br/>
intent<br/>
&gt; on teaching our children how to be real suckers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: thanks for the warm welcome<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s see...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once I read about unschooling in the &quot;Homeschooling book of Answers&quot;...I<br/>
knew<br/>
&gt; that was the route for us...It was kinda hard to imagine exactly what or<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; to teach my children...in fact when I looked at the home idea of home<br/>
&gt; schooling, choosing curriculums, setting up &#39;academic learning&#39; time...I<br/>
felt<br/>
&gt; kida overwhelmed...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then I got into the Unschooling Handbook...what the author said makes so<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; sense...I already instill alot of trust in my boys to figure things out on<br/>
&gt; their own and to be able to make choices that further thier own<br/>
interests...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also I experienced a sense of relief with the idea that I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; and buy a curriculum...I have made some plans to create a more learning<br/>
&gt; encouraged environment in my den/home office space...I keep my sewing<br/>
machine<br/>
&gt; there but soon that will be moved to my bedroom...(it was in my bedroom<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; I lived in a two bedroom apt...)  I am moving a sofa and loveseat to the<br/>
den<br/>
&gt; and adding some bookshelves...and I wanted to get some books that are more<br/>
&gt; like reference books rite now...such as a basic math book...that can help<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; and the boys understand what we are learning...not so much a text<br/>
book...but<br/>
&gt; like a how to book...if that makes sense and I also want to get a book on<br/>
&gt; grammar that explains all the &#39;rules&#39; so that we can understand them...I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; one a while back when I did alot of writing and aspired to be a sci fi and<br/>
&gt; fantasy author (I have some great ideas)...now I got the APA manual on how<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; write journal articles related to the medical and nursing fields (a<br/>
&gt; requirement for college)  now I just want something basic that is easy to<br/>
&gt; understand that can answer on the spot questions...as for science and<br/>
social<br/>
&gt; studies and other educational &#39;requirements&#39;...well I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; is any one book we should have so I plan on acquiring whatever seems<br/>
&gt; interesting at the time...there are some field trips planned in the near<br/>
&gt; future (especially around paydays) to several of the local bookstores...(w<br/>
ink)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far the hardest thing has been sharing my computer with the boys...but<br/>
&gt; since I have a laptop as well as a pc...that isn&#39;t as hard as I thought it<br/>
&gt; would be...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am having fun and wish that I had gotten the inspiration for this<br/>
desision<br/>
&gt; a year or so ago...but as I place my faith in God...God brings into our<br/>
life<br/>
&gt; what we need when we need it...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This afternoon...the boys again asked...&quot;When does homeschool start?&quot;  so<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; asked<br/>
&gt; what is homeschool and we talked about all the things we did in the last<br/>
few<br/>
&gt; days that helped us to learn something new and exciting...I happened to<br/>
pick<br/>
&gt; up a couple of grade appropriate &#39;curriculum&#39; work books at costco and let<br/>
&gt; them know that anytime they felt a need to sit down and do &#39;class work&#39;<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; were welcome to...we laughed at that...then they promptly went outside to<br/>
&gt; play with friends...it is so nice to have the wieght of ps off our<br/>
&gt; shoulders...and I feel like I am getting some quality time with them...I<br/>
&gt; always felt that I was competing with ps for thier time...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This letter must be all over the place...I am just excited about<br/>
unschooling<br/>
&gt; and having a forum to share our experiences!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lhiza<br/>

&gt; John,,,,<br/>
&gt; that was great,,,a wonderful twist on &#39;sucker&#39;, and very true to what a<br/>
&#39;true<br/>
&gt; sucker&#39; is--one who puts the emphasis on what can i get out of this<br/>
&gt; experience, but not in a superficial way,,or in a me thing,,,,but in a<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; deep need to know for the sake of knowing and nothing else kind of way.  I<br/>
&gt; loved it.  Thanks for touching that part.<br/>
