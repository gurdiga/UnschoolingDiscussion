<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549190032"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t think this woman is a bad mom.  I actually like her.  she<br/>
&gt; funny and easy to talk to.  I do know that she doesn&#39;t enjoy being<br/>
&gt; with her kids, without having *something* to do.  She has told me<br/>
&gt; that, they drive her crazy if they aren&#39;t doing an activity or have a<br/>
&gt; friend over.<br/>
&gt; Joanna<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know,  I wonder if the not enjoying being with her children could be<br/>
correlated with the number of outside activities they are involved in.  What<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of is my oldest dd.....who almost only &#39;acts out&#39;  or allows<br/>
her negative emotions,  whining, etc.  out at home...or with our family<br/>
members.  I&#39;m wondering if the kids are less enjoyable since the time they<br/>
do get with mom is time they need to &#39;let loose&#39; ...making it more<br/>
stressful.<br/>
    And I do wonder if it&#39;s some type of escapism...from herself,  from<br/>
them,  from &#39;being&#39; instead of always &#39;doing.<br/>
    I know several people who tend to have what I consider extremely<br/>
scheduled lives for themselves and their children.  Is it due to some<br/>
external social pressure?  And I do think that moms that do this usually<br/>
believe that what they are doing is &#39;best&#39; for themselves and children....so<br/>
thay wouldn&#39;t be &#39;bad&#39;;  but I wonder,   could they be mis-informed.  I<br/>
suppose it all comes down to the attitude about it....is the mom at peace<br/>
with herself and her choices?  Do she and her children thrive on this?  Do<br/>
they seem happy and growing in healthy family relationships?<br/>
    I have a neighbor-friend who tends to keep things<br/>
activity-oriented....almost always a play date or organized activity.....one<br/>
of her reasons is to keep the children out of the house a lot because her<br/>
*disabled* spouse has very little patience with them and their messes and<br/>
noise, etc.<br/>
Gotta go for now,<br/>
