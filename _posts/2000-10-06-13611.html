<div id="ygrps-yiv-17559298">We get Cricket, Spider, Ladybug, Ranger Rick and Highlights. The kids (ds, 3 <br/>
and 7) ignore ALL of them. They much prefer books, even the ones we read <br/>
over and over. I truck the magazines to the library magazine exchange and <br/>
leave them there. In fact, if I were looking for a magazine, I would take <br/>
the kids to the library and see what they like... if anything!<br/>
