<div id="ygrps-yiv-836849306">-=-I&#39;ve been noticing that it&#39;s making me more honest with myself.-=-<br/>

don&#39;t stand up to the light very well-=-<br/>
<br/>
And that is mindfulness.  Hear yourself thinking.  Feel yourself feeling.  <br/>
Examine what you think you know without justifying every thought you have.  Try <br/>
to turn off the many voices in your head and see things quietly.<br/>
