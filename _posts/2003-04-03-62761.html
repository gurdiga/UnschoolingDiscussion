<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071993487">Ugh, it&#39;s late! I should paste now! This is to benefit a 10 year old girl who has brain cancer.  Just for this morning, I am<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;         going to step over the laundry,<br/>
&gt;         and pick you up and take you to the park to<br/>
&gt;         play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this morning, I will<br/>
&gt;         leave the dishes in the sink,<br/>
&gt;         and let you teach me how to put that puzzle<br/>
&gt;         of yours together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this afternoon, I will<br/>
&gt;         unplug the telephone and<br/>
&gt;         keep the computer off, and sit with you in the<br/>
&gt;         backyard and blow bubbles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this afternoon, I will<br/>
&gt;         not yell once, not even a<br/>
&gt;         tiny grumble when<br/>
&gt;         you scream and whine for the ice<br/>
&gt;         cream truck, and I will buy you one if<br/>
&gt;         he comes by.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this afternoon, I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;         worry about what you are<br/>
&gt;         going to be when you grow up, or second guess<br/>
&gt;         every decision I have made<br/>
&gt;         where you are concerned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this afternoon, I will let<br/>
&gt;         you help me bake cookies, and I won&#39;t<br/>
&gt;         stand over you trying to fix them.<br/>
&gt;         Just for this afternoon, I will take<br/>
&gt;         us to McDonald&#39;s and buy us both a<br/>
&gt;         Happy Meal so you can have both toys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this evening, I will hold<br/>
&gt;         you in my arms and tell you a story<br/>
&gt;         about how you were born and how<br/>
&gt;         much I love you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this evening, I will let<br/>
&gt;         you splash in the tub and<br/>
&gt;         not get angry.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this evening, I will let<br/>
&gt;         you stay up late while we sit on the<br/>
&gt;         porch and count all the stars.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Just for this evening, I will<br/>
&gt;         snuggle beside you for hours,<br/>
&gt;         and miss my favorite TV shows.<br/>
&gt;         Just for this evening when I run<br/>
&gt;         my finger through your hair<br/>
&gt;         as you pray, I will simply be grate! ful that God<br/>
&gt;         has given me the greatest gift ever<br/>
&gt;         given.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         I will think about the mothers<br/>
&gt;         And fathers who are searching<br/>
&gt;         for their missing children,<br/>
&gt;         the mothers and fathers who are<br/>
&gt;         visiting their children&#39;s graves<br/>
&gt;         instead of their bedrooms, and mothers and<br/>
&gt;         fathers who are in hospital rooms watching<br/>
&gt;         their children suffer senselessly, and screaming inside that they<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;         handle it anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         And when I kiss you good night I<br/>
&gt;         will hold you a little tighter, a<br/>
&gt;         little longer. It is then, that I will<br/>
&gt;         thank God for you, and ask<br/>
&gt;         him for nothing, except one more day.............<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;          Hi. I am a 29 year old father.  Me and my wife have had a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wonderful<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; life together. God blessed us with a child too. Our daughter&#39;s name is<br/>

This is what it meant to me last night when I read it. I was on the computer in our bedroom and my 10 year old had just fallen asleep in our bed reading Artemis Fowl (a new book we are reading together) I could hear sleep take over her in her breathe and I just felt this overwhelming urge to hold her, keep her with me, protect her and love her. The poem was a reminder for me of such a great gift that I have and how fortunate I am that she is healthy and the other two are healthy too. Peace, Kelli<br/>
