<div id="ygrps-yiv-727411339">I was listening to a rock station (which might help with IDing this song) and a song came up I don&#39;t know the title or artist for. I THINK it&#39;s about the HMS Bounty from the captain&#39;s viewpoint. <br/>
  <br/>
The beginning is &quot;Everybody, listen to me/and return me my ship! I&#39;m your captain! I&#39;m your captain!&quot; <br/>
   <br/>
  He talks about being sick, and about a stranger having his hand around his throat and asking God to take the stranger (Death?) from his ship. Somewhere in there is something about taking me or returning me to my homeport. <br/>
   <br/>
  At the end I think there&#39;s a flute in the background and it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m getting closer to my home! I&#39;m getting closer to my home!&quot; repeated a few times. <br/>
   <br/>
  If anyone can help me to ID this song, I&#39;d appreciate it! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313388233">Thanks Ren! Someone on another list also found it for me! Looking over the lyrics I&#39;m not sure where I thought I&#39;d heard &quot;bounty&quot; at but then again, trying to listen closely AND drive and with 3 kids chattering at me LOL :-) <br/>
   <br/>
  To explain a little, Sarah has been asking me about song lyrics quite often. I realized there are many songs I&#39;m so used to hearing that I don&#39;t LISTEN to them so I&#39;ve been making a conscious effort to listen to the lyrics of songs, and this came up and I wondered if it was about the HMS Bounty, realized I don&#39;t even know much more than that an infamous mutany occured on a ship by the name of HMS Bounty! So I&#39;m off to look it up anyways, even if this song doesn&#39;t actually relate. <br/>
