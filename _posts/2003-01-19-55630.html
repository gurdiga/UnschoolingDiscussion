Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

<br/>
I have been so happy to see the pa-unschoolers site get more and <br/>
more &quot;unschooly&quot; lately.  It used to be that I didn&#39;t go there much <br/>
because it was more ecclectic/relaxed homeschooling, and the radical <br/>
unschooling ideas were sometimes not very popular!  But that&#39;s been <br/>
slowly changing, and I&#39;m very, very pleased!  Thanks!<br/>
