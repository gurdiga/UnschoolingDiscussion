<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303420794"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Those thorns can make picking a challenge.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mil had an ancient leather jacket and gloves that she wore for picking<br/>
blackberries.  Maybe you can find something like that at a thrift shop?<br/>
<br/>
We use to pick blackberries behind the Schucks near 6th ave and Pearl. <br/>
My brother lives in Gig Harbor and had some of the hugest and sweetest<br/>
blackberries I&#39;d ever tasted, but he ended up bulldozing them away.<br/>
<br/>
And didn&#39;t Tom Robbins write some story about a Seattle of the future<br/>
where blackberry vines have overtaken just about everything?<br/>

berries!</div>

**Hi Mary Ellen. That&#39;s all shopping center now. And the bushes by the<br/>
freeway were bulldozed. But you can still pick wonderful berries at the<br/>
Nature Center (formerly Snake Lake) near S 19th and Tyler. (this is in<br/>
Tacoma WA for those who wonder) Of course, if I let my neighbor&#39;s berries<br/>
grow over my fence I have them in my own backyard. And in some places, wild<br/>
strawberries still pop up. Huckleberries, too. :) (my fav are blueberries,<br/>
though)<br/>

**Now this I can believe. Nothing but blackberry bushes and coffee houses as<br/>
far as the eye can see...<br/>
