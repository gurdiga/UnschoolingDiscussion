<div id="ygrps-yiv-387505415">Michael,  <br/>
<br/>
May I respectfully point out the following?<br/>
<br/>
Grocery clerks and managers, baggers, Walmart greeters, waiters, <br/>
waitresses, cooks, chefs, gas station attendants, autoshop <br/>
employees, paint shop employees, corner store owners/employees, <br/>
store clerks, store managers, police officers, firemen, ambulance <br/>
drivers, mailmen, garbage truck drivers, utility workers, city <br/>
employees, contstruction men,  the US MILITARY enlisted and some <br/>
enlisted that become officers, self employeed business owners, etc. <br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about you, but most of those people are public <br/>
highschool graduates. If my children choose one of those professions <br/>
and it makes them happy great, if they choose to be self-employed <br/>
all the better.  Another way you could look at this whole <br/>
unschooling issue is the following:  I care and love my children <br/>
more than you or anyone else, other than dh, in this whole entire <br/>
world.  I want what is best for my children, do you think I&#39;d be <br/>
unschooling if I thought for a second that they&#39;d end up street <br/>
bums?  To look at it in that perspective maybe can help shed some <br/>
light.  <br/>
<br/>
The harsh reality is that most welfare recipients and people in this <br/>
country who are below poverty and/or poor were public schooled, not <br/>
unschooled or homeschooled.  The reality is that most people in this <br/>
country were public schooled and hold down average jobs and make <br/>
money just enough to make it from paycheck to paycheck.  The reality <br/>
is also that some people are making so much money they don&#39;t have to <br/>
worry about a thing, yet are some of the most sorry people you&#39;d <br/>
ever meet. <br/>
<br/>
I read a study the other day that said 64% of highschoolers go onto <br/>
college....33% drop out after 2 years, meaning that over 67% of <br/>
Americans did not go to college.  I meet a lot of happy people who <br/>
didn&#39;t go to college in all walks of life, and have met college <br/>
graduates who are miserable and vice/versa.  <br/>
<br/>
