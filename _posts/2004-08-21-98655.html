SOmething I&#39;ve noticed about JC&#39;s movies. He films mostly in CHina using <br/>
native companies. When He is speaking to another Chinese Character, they film in <br/>
Chines and later dub English in. When he is speaking to an English speaking <br/>
character, they speak English.<br/>
BUT!<br/>
They tweak the soundtrack so that the words and their lips are still slightly <br/>
off. Cracks me up everytime.<br/>

I once was propmaster for a Taiwanese company shooting a film in Los Angeles<br/>
starring a Chinese-American teen boy band who lived in obscurity here in LA<br/>
but were bigger than the Backstreet Boys in Taiwan - mob scenes of teenage<br/>
girls wherever they went there. It was an extraordinary experience of<br/>
culture clashing and different ways of working. However the relevance to<br/>
this topic is that not recording live sound - dialogue or effects or room<br/>
tone or anything - is the &quot;way it is done&quot; generally in Asia. On that movie<br/>
everyone just spoke their native tongue - either Mandarin (I think) or<br/>
English - making for some odd scenes. I&#39;ll tell the whole story to anyone<br/>
who is interested in funny &quot;behind the scenes&quot; stuff if I ever see you. The<br/>
movie, which seemed appallingly bad to all of us local workers, was<br/>
evidently the biggest hit in Taiwan of that particular summer.<br/>
