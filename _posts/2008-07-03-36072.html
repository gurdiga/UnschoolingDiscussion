<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041275589">I have checked the archives and couldn&#39;t find what I was looking for. I&#39;ve<br/>
also googled and found lots of worksheet type things which will only hold<br/>
her attention for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest seems to be bored so I am looking for some new activities for<br/>
her to do. She has a short attention span (as do most her age I think) so<br/>
something that doesn&#39;t take long to set up/take down would be great. No<br/>
cost/low cost would be great as well.<br/>
<br/>
Some of her favorite activities include &quot;making messes&quot;, lol. I don&#39;t really<br/>
think of them as messes. She likes to play in water. Loves to play in flour.<br/>
Likes to dump things on the floor (especially marbles & the colored<br/>
pencils). We are looking into getting a &quot;water table&quot; or something like it<br/>
(we are thinking maybe a regular sandbox would be cheaper), but that has to<br/>
wait until next Thursday (not sure they would let us take a sandbox on the<br/>
bus, lol).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m looking for lots of ideas of things to do with her. My brain<br/>
seems to not want to think right now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401930538">play doh & cookie cutters<br/>
non-hardening clay <br/>
<br/>
bright colored paper to color on - we have neon paper that my niece likes<br/>
various coloring mediums - chalk; pencils, gel pens, markers, crayons (they make different crayons like glitter, neon, etc,)<br/>
They make paper punches that punch out small designs - for example a heart.<br/>
scissors and glue (they make glitter glue)<br/>
a stapler<br/>
a hole punch<br/>
<br/>
sidewalk / driveway chalk<br/>
a huge tub of water and things like spoons, cups, meat baster, eye dropper, measuring cups, <br/>
squirt guns / squirt bottles<br/>
<br/>
sing and dance videos or cd&#39;s of music - my 3 yr old nephew loves to dance when I put on the Disney Tarzan cd of music - free would be finding a great radio station to dance to.<br/>
<br/>
shaving cream on a table top is fun to mess in - get a can from the dollar store.<br/>
various size balls to play with - Koosh balls are great for indoor.<br/>
finger paints<br/>
paint with a paint brush<br/>
water color paints - you can color on white paper with a white crayon and then paint over it with water color paints and the paint does not stick where you colored.<br/>
<br/>
small sessions of activities like hopping - hop on one foot, switch, hop with both feet;  run to the back of the yard and back, time her (if she wants) to see how long she can do such and such or how long it takes to do something like run to the back of the yard, stand on one foot, stand and play catch with the Koosh, how many hops does it take to get to this place - count for her/with her, etc. throw a ball/Koosh/bean bag/folded up socks into a laundry basket.<br/>
<br/>
gather up boxes and make things.  We&#39;ve made a sail boat, a race car, etc with boxes large enough for Zac to sit in when he was that age.  I remember a 12 pack soda (coke) box being an engine on something we made.   He has also made forts and buildings large enough for his GI Joes.  If you have a Sam&#39;s Club or Costco&#39;s near by or possibly other stores might let you have their boxes for free.<br/>
<br/>
how about a board and some nails and a hammer ?<br/>
<br/>
we used to love to make &quot;mud pies&quot; as children - all it took was something to make it in (usually our wagon), dirt, water and available items like sticks, leaves, rocks, and Zac also loved to build with mud, sticks, rocks, etc. he would build channels, damns, water falls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It really is hard to make a list because I have no idea what would grab her interest but maybe this list will help jump start your creative juices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039634483">My first thought was corn starch and water!!!  That&#39;s pretty <br/>
inexpensive.<br/>
<br/>
And craft dough made from white bread and glue.  VERY messy while <br/>
making and ends up with a lovely texture, nice enough to do rose <br/>
petals!  And it air dries.  The recipe I used years ago called for <br/>
glycerin which I don&#39;t keep around.  I substituted dish liquid.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I haven&#39;t tried yet is rose beads, which sound really <br/>
cool.  But I&#39;ve made magazine beads (where you roll a strip with <br/>
glue) and those are great.<br/>
<br/>
I remember stepping on soda cans when I was little so they squish <br/>
around your shoes and you can &quot;tap&quot; dance.  Also making &quot;stilts&quot; out <br/>
of cans and string.<br/>
<br/>
Cat&#39;s cradle.<br/>
<br/>
collect all your crayon bits and pieces, sort by general color and <br/>
then melt and make into new crayons.  You can use the wilton molds to <br/>
make some really fun ones that are nice and chunky to hold.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could lay out a bedsheet when she&#39;s going to do a craft <br/>
project to catch all the odds and ends.  Then just get out the <br/>
construction paper, the colors the scissors and tape and see what <br/>
happens!?!?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349107396">My boys loved a large lid filled with rice.  We used this instead of a sand<br/>
box.  It lived in the kitchen with funnels and all sorts of things.  When<br/>
they were done, we&#39;d have fun with the brooms and &#39;clean&#39; up.  Usually it<br/>
was clean enough to just put all the rice back into the box.<br/>
<br/>
I used to put water in our recyclable tubs and things and then freeze them.<br/>
We&#39;d go outside on the patio and draw or make things with the ice.  This<br/>
cooled them down on the days that were hot.<br/>
<br/>
We have window markers that draw on all our windows and the sliding glass<br/>
door.<br/>
<br/>
We used cardboard and golf tees as our board and nails.  This was great with<br/>
shoe boxes, too!<br/>
<br/>
We made tons of confetti with paper.  The loved cutting things.<br/>
<br/>
We played &#39;family ball&#39; with the squish balls intended for the pool.  This<br/>
is where you put as many balls on the floor as you have and roll them as<br/>
fast as you can back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
We also play sock snowball fights.  As it sounds, we get all our socks,<br/>
separate each individual sock and roll it into a ball.  Then we divide them<br/>
and use the bed as the &#39;fort&#39; in between us and throw them to our heart&#39;s<br/>
content.  Then when it was over, we&#39;d open a drawer in the dresser and play<br/>
&#39;basketball&#39; to put them all away.<br/>
<br/>
At this age, I washed little &#39;real&#39; clothing as the boys were always in<br/>
dress-up stuff.  I converted old clothing (some mine) into costumes like<br/>
Robin Hood and capes out of old material or sheets.  Hats were a hit too.<br/>
<br/>
We had a sheet in the living room to make an instant cave to play in and<br/>
read in.  A dining chair was used as the door to crawl under.<br/>
<br/>
We spent a lot of time in the tub.  They make great tub toys that hold the<br/>
color tablets, some bubbles if they wanted and they make color crayons that<br/>
can be used on the bathtub walls.  Sometimes just &#39;washing&#39; the walls with<br/>
the bubbles and a washcloth was enough to keep them occupied for hours!<br/>
<br/>
Anything that&#39;s easy to stack then knock over was fun.  We have soft blocks<br/>
that they loved to do this with.  I&#39;d build a &#39;structure&#39; as fast as I could<br/>
on my right, then as they were running I would build one as fast as I could<br/>
on my left.  This kept them running around for a bit!<br/>
<br/>
We loved just adventuring, too.  We&#39;d get all our stuff (flashlights, a<br/>
bucket to carry our stuff in, magnifying glass, map [usually something we<br/>
drew with the necessary &#39;x&#39; on it]) and headed out.  We&#39;d make up the<br/>
mission as we went along and often it changed many times during the walk.<br/>
We&#39;d save a space on our deck that was to display all our &#39;treasure&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The boys enjoyed blowing bubbles and more so - they enjoyed chasing bubbles<br/>
that were blown.  This was great in the park or outside in the grass.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find something fun!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also try waxed paper and aluminum foil, for art projects.  A pencil  <br/>
on aluminum foil can be very cool.  Also the foil put on top of  <br/>
something carved, or even coins.  But over a patterned metal platter,  <br/>
or pottery with a pattern, and press down the aluminum.  Then it can  <br/>
be made into a ball.  Then it can be put in the recycling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Waxed paper is also cool with a pencil or colored pencils, and there  <br/>
are ways to layer leaves and flower petals between the layers and  <br/>
iron them between sheets of paper (so the wax doesn&#39;t get on the iron  <br/>
or ironing board).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Paper towels and food coloring.  You can make kind of tie-dye designs  <br/>
with little cups of food coloring, fold the towel, dip different  <br/>
corners in different colors, unfold it carefully and let it dry.  You  <br/>
can use those for wrapping paper (or tissue inside a box when a gift  <br/>
is being wrapped).<br/>
<br/>
All of those take a lot of adult interaction, but that&#39;s a good  <br/>
thing.  Instead of looking for things she can do without you, look  <br/>
for things you can do with her.<br/>

<br/>
Ohhh you just gave me a nice memory!  When Chamille was about 5/6 we<br/>
acquired a bunch of big boxes, big enough to sit in.  She made a train<br/>
out of them and attatched them altogether and put all of her special<br/>
stuffed animal friends in it, with her biggest bear being the engineer<br/>
with a special engineer (mr. bubble) hat.  That thing was played with<br/>
for months, it went inside and outside.  The neighbor kids loved it!  We<br/>
lived in a big house at the time, so it lived anywhere it wanted to and<br/>
lasted a good long time!<br/>
<br/>
Margaux (6) has loved loads of hands on messy stuff.  Almost everything<br/>
eventually involves more than just her hands by the time it&#39;s all done. <br/>
I keep large squares of cardboard to lay out to do large scale painting<br/>
with hands and feet, or the cornstarch and water stuff, or the playdough<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Things we keep as staple supplies are cotton balls, cornstarch, food<br/>
coloring, flour, salt, koolaid, large tempera paints/poster paints,<br/>
loads of paper, many things to paint with, rubber stamps and ink, yarn,<br/>
anything that seems like it might be fun and interesting, like those<br/>
water soluble packing peanuts, etc.  We also have a messy art book that<br/>
has recipes that use common ingredients.  Margaux pulls that out when<br/>
she is looking for physical stimulus activities.<br/>
<br/>
Fort building is a fun and lasting activity to occupy a kid for many<br/>
many hours.  We&#39;ve even gone so far as to put the tent up in the living<br/>
room, or even the yard in the summer for outside play.</div>

She could have a cardboard house with stained-glass windows (back up  <br/>
to the crayon-shavings-in-waxed-paper)!  And an aluminum-foil-wad  <br/>
doorknob!   Make a hole in the door and pull through a long fan- <br/>
folded piece of foil, and then wad up the ends that stick through for  <br/>
doorknobs!!<br/>
<br/>
(and send photos if you do these things!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209916893">We used to dump stuff in the bathtub for the girls to play with/in.  <br/>
You can buy finger paints, but we used to buy powdered tempera paint  <br/>
and mix it with a little liquid soap and water. A favorite was instant  <br/>
pudding. Cornstarch was good. They had a big bag full of bathtub toys  <br/>
that were really mostly kitchen utensils, plastic food, fast food  <br/>
toys, beach toys, etc. Egg beaters, whisks, sifters, funnels, basters  <br/>
- those I remember as being especially fun.<br/>
<br/>
Playdough made at home is WAY cooler than store-bought. Google for a  <br/>
recipe - but be creative. Add oatmeal. Or high fiber cereal like Fiber  <br/>
One or rice - for weird consistencies.  Add pineapple or chocolate or  <br/>
mint flavorings. Add bits of herbs and spices. You can use the  <br/>
coloring that is used by cake decorators to get more vivid colors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103743792">You guys have already listed most things Id list. I asked my resident expert on 5 year old activities what she would suggest. <br/>
   <br/>
  She says you have to make snowcones, do cannon balls onto the air matress , sugar painting ( glue on the paper then sprinkle colored sugar on ) , bicycle painting...<br/>
   <br/>
  my 9 year was the &quot;bicycle washer&quot; and squirted paint on her tires and she rode her bike over a big piece of cardboard making colorful tracks. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192692648">One thing my daughter has really enjoyed is her art table.  We have a<br/>
large low table covered with a wipeable table cloth and a low<br/>
bookshelf next to it with more books and art supplies.   It is in the<br/>
living room/kitchen/dining room area  (all open & connected) so it is<br/>
right in the center of everything.<br/>
<br/>
The art table has plain paper, construction paper, scissors, glue,<br/>
glue sticks, crayons, markers, rubber stamps, pipe cleaners, popsicle<br/>
sticks, origami, tape, a stapler, lots of non-messy paints (dot-art<br/>
paints and another set that is like roll on deodorant), coloring<br/>
books,  writing books for practicing letters, yarn, poofy balls for<br/>
art projects, stickers, clay, noodles, playfoam and probably a few<br/>
other things.  We also have paints (water color and tempra), pastels,<br/>
glitter glue, and playdough available upon request.  She LOVES it.<br/>
<br/>
We had most of those things around before we had an art table, but<br/>
putting them all together for her like this made a huge difference in<br/>
how she used them and how often she used them.  One of the things that<br/>
she really wanted for her birthday earlier this week was to get new<br/>
supplies for the art table.  She helped me shop for new art supplies<br/>
and she was very happy when I reorganized the table and added a few<br/>
new things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some things I plan to add:<br/>
aluminum foil<br/>
feathers<br/>
pine cones & other things we collect outside<br/>
paper plates<br/>
colored pencils<br/>
colored tape (she has had this in the past and loved it - huge &quot;spider<br/>
web&quot; in the living room!)<br/>
<br/>
I loved all the project ideas - a great reminder of some old favorites<br/>
and some great new things that we haven&#39;t tried yet.  I&#39;m looking<br/>
forward to it :)<br/>

&gt; Likes to dump things on the floor (especially marbles & the colored<br/>

<br/>
let the kid slowly learn to manage their his own free time by making/experimenting things around the house. also remember that you cannot make the child happy all the times by providing things in their hands... they need to figure out things on their own to occupy themselves.<br/>

Coffee pot filters work really well for this too.  Eye droppers are fun to use for this.<br/>

Blow up a balloon and &quot;keep it in the air&quot;  great indoor activity.<br/>
<br/>
Balloon volleyball is fun - set up a net (sheet or large towel works great) one person on each side of the &quot;net&quot; and hit the balloon back and forth.  OR you could bat the balloon back and forth between you two without a &quot;net&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Balloon punch balls - it&#39;s a thick balloon with a rubber band.  You hold onto the rubber band and rhythmically punch it back and forth - those are cheap and at most stores like groceries and Wal-Mart;k-mart;target types.<br/>
<br/>
Zac loved making balloon &quot;things&quot; like animals, hats, etc.  We had a book that gave picture instructions, and the skinny balloons with the little hand pump - because you really cannot blow them up with your mouth.  The instruction book was great in that it was a launching off place.<br/>
<br/>
Take a large straw and attach gift wrap ribbons of various widths and lengths to it with a stapler or anything else you have for a stick/wand/something to attach the ribbons to. Running with the streamers/ribbons and waving them around.<br/>
<br/>
go for a &quot;walk&quot; and hunt for neat things to glue onto paper;  make rock creatures - a pet rock perhaps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542594970">-=-water toys kept in a place where it is easy to clean up later.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We had a plastic bin for water toys, and would leave it in the tub  <br/>
until they were dry and then put it under the sink.  That was helpful  <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
The art table ideas are making ME want to go and play with paper and  <br/>
glue and dye.   I did want to remind moms whose children are  new to  <br/>
this and who are considering these things for the first time of this:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make it your child&#39;s responsibility to keep the area clean.   <br/>
You clean it up.  Maybe, if you make it fun, your child will want to  <br/>
help.  But part of unschooling is providing space and materials for  <br/>
learning to take place.<br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;You can use these things if you clean it up,&quot; you might  <br/>
as well say &quot;You can use this, but the result will be me being angry  <br/>
and you being in trouble.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Small children are capable of taking things off a shelf long before  <br/>
they&#39;re able to put them back.  They are able to color long before  <br/>
they can manage to put crayons back in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Make it your job to clean the area up, not theirs.  The results down  <br/>
the line will be wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was unloading a very full dishwasher to load it up with  <br/>
two sinks&#39; worth of dishes.  I asked Holly if she would help, and  <br/>
pulled out the silverware tray.  She was putting that away and I was  <br/>
putting away the other stuff, and I turned around and she and her  <br/>
boyfriend were finishing off the whole rest of the inside.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s from a &quot;Clean it up yourself&quot; family, and when I&#39;ve gone in  <br/>
where he is and offered to pick up his dishes, or brought him and  <br/>
Holly food, he acts surprised and embarrassed and grateful--out of  <br/>
proportion to what I&#39;m doing, which is picking up dishes from where  <br/>
people have eaten.  He&#39;s not used to it.  But my kids come and get my  <br/>
dishes too, or if they pass by where I am they often ask if I need  <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Generosity will have a payback, a few years back.<br/>
Selfishness and control will too, but you won&#39;t like that one.<br/>

really enjoyed it. I will have to post pics!<br/>

All of those take a lot of adult interaction, but that&#39;s a good<br/>

for things you can do with her.<br/>

Just wanted to be clear that I was looking for things to do with her. In my<br/>

 Which reminds me that my boys (3 and 9) love to paint outdoors with  <br/>
tempura/poster paints. They have used brushes (they love the cheap, foam kind  with <br/>
the wooden handles) to paint the porch, the &quot;walls&quot; (hip high to an  adult) of <br/>
the porch, the windows, the storm door. If the rain could get in  to them, it <br/>
would have come off in the rain, but I never washed it off. I like  it. They <br/>
have often taken squirt-bottles of paint and made patterns on the  driveway, <br/>
sidewalk and porch (oh, and each other and themselves! LOL) in  fantastic, <br/>
beautiful colors and patterns, smearing and stamping with their feet  and hands. <br/>
One was so fantastic, I took pictures, knowing it would wash away in  the rain <br/>
and wishing there was some way I could keep my sidewalk painted like  that <br/>
forever. I loved it!! Here&#39;s a link to the blog post where I put the  pictures: <br/>

Wyl is in the process (several days now) of making a volcano in the back  <br/>
yard. He&#39;s dug out quite a pit and built up the sides with mud and is planning  <br/>
on getting a lot of baking soda and vinegar to make it erupt. I&#39;m not sure it  <br/>
will work as he has it at the moment, but we&#39;re working to find the best way <br/>
to  make it *erupt*.<br/>
 <br/>
Waterplay outside the &quot;norm&quot; is always a big hit here. The boys like  digging <br/>
a hole in their digging area and filling it with the hose. If there is a  <br/>
flat, sort of paved or hard (or truly paved) surface, it is fun to let the water  <br/>
trickle from the hose at the top and find different things in the yard to <br/>
change  or dam the flow of water. Squeezing the hose flat in the middle so the <br/>
water  flow stops is fun, too-especially experimenting with fast-slow release to <br/>
see  how that effects the water pressure and flow. Puddles are fun. We like <br/>
to play  in the rain when it isn&#39;t thunderstorming.<br/>

We had a great sandbox at our old house, just a dug-out place against  <br/>
a cinderblock wall, one railroad tie by two, with two or three tons  <br/>
of sand (we added more after a while).  We fastened a sheet to the  <br/>
fence and staked it out for a shade sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
The most fun thing was a little like a volcano.  We would put the  <br/>
hose on low, and bury the end.  Eventually the water breaks through.   <br/>
So we&#39;d try to bury the &quot;spring,&quot; and keep it buried, and the water  <br/>
would break through somewhere else.  It&#39;s pretty exciting, with  <br/>
little kids, and I still feel the excitement of the memories myself.<br/>
