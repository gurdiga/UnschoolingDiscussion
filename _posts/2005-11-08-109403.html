<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373345148">&quot;I want him to learn how to read because it will allow him to do more<br/>
of the things he wants to do: learn about science and do science<br/>
experiments, play games on the computer that have instructions that<br/>
you have to read, read books that he is interested in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Man somehow survived for millions of years and made great progress <br/>
without books or reading.  Much science is learned by touching, <br/>
feeling, exploring, finding things out on accident, etc...that is what <br/>
makes science fun. Look at George Washington Carver.  He didn&#39;t know <br/>
how to read or write as a child but his curiousity had him doing <br/>
experiments with nature long before he stepped foot into a school.<br/>
<br/>
Are you not willing to do science experiments with him? Have you <br/>
inadvertantly made him think that having fun with science is only <br/>
something that can happen as a reward for learning to read?  Why can&#39;t <br/>
you read him the instructions?  Perhaps an older sibling would enjoy <br/>
doing some fun experiments. <br/>
<br/>
We made a chocolate volcano with no directions required, it was my <br/>
son&#39;s idea.  What about you making some oobleck and letting him have <br/>
fun, or baking cookies or things like that? We had more fun with our <br/>
own volcano made up with thoughts and criticical thinking of how that <br/>
chocolate would ooze out of the top, than the baking soda/vinegar <br/>
volcano or prepackaged electric volcano.  <br/>
