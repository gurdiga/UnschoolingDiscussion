&gt; Subject: Re: Health Insurance for An Unschooler who is about to turn 20<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a about to turn 20 year old who is not sure<br/>
&gt; what direction he wishes to go, right now he is into<br/>
&gt; writing music, which is okay by me after having a<br/>
&gt; terrible career in the school system.  (I took him out<br/>
&gt; at the age of 17).  My husband&#39;s company will not<br/>
&gt; cover him under their insurance plan because I have no<br/>
&gt; documentation stating he is enrolled in a &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions would be very helpful.<br/>

Apply for UNhealth insurance under our UNhealthy Lifestyle Program.<br/>
Go to www.badforyou.org/unschool/unclean/undocumented/lost souls<br/>
<br/>
There are special rates for composers who are turned off almost everything,<br/>
and supersaver accounts for those with no particular direction to their<br/>
lives. Buy two policies, get three free, they&#39;re that good. And sign up for<br/>
the  baddest ex-husband contest : Winner gets a week in Newark, NJ runner up<br/>
gets two weeks.     ?^)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, I would advise against insurance for anything, especially<br/>
for the health of a 20yo. Buying insurance is Betting Against Yourself.<br/>
Better to spend the dough on healthy food, exercise, and things that make<br/>
your kid happy. He&#39;ll live long enough to save far more than the policy<br/>
cost.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was 20, the day before my first final of my senior year, I was run<br/>
over by a car which collapsed both lungs and broke several bones. Though<br/>
jogging had probably been helpful in saving me, neither that nor the other<br/>
things would have saved the several thousands of dollars in emergency room<br/>
care, 2 weeks of ICU care and 2 additional weeks in the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
20 yos are probably lower-risk for diseases that healthy food, exercise and<br/>
so on would prevent, but higher-risk for doing things to themselves that<br/>
could cost thousands and thousands of dollars.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is a gamble.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with that.  I would add, though, especially if money is <br/>
tight, that it isn&#39;t a bad idea to put 10 bucks a week or whatever <br/>
you can afford into a jar so at least you have something in case of <br/>
an emergency.  It could be a medical emergency like an auto accident <br/>
or a household emergency like your furnace shutting down in the <br/>
middle of January, but it is nice to have a little something extra on <br/>
hand just in case. <br/>
