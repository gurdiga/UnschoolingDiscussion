<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593359074">This morning, while reading the newspaper and drinking coffee and waiting for <br/>
my kids to wake up, I saw the parade of parents and children trekking down <br/>
for the first day of public school.  Catholic schools started yesterday, but my <br/>
neighbors drive instead of walking, so it&#39;s less of a spectacle.<br/>
<br/>
I realized this would have been Nathan&#39;s first day of school - he turned five <br/>
a few weeks ago, before the birthday cutoff.  He would have been one of the <br/>
youngest in his class.  Most of his friends were born after the cutoff.  <br/>
<br/>
He also would have had to get up early, eat breakfast right away instead of <br/>
an hour into his day when he gets hungry, gotten out of his pjs before <br/>
breakfast and then gone to sit in a classroom for an hour.  When would he have had <br/>
time to draw and cut out the unicorn he decided to make this morning while I made <br/>
muffins?  How would he have learned to make four legs and struggled with the <br/>
proportions of a side view of a unicorn?  When would he have played with his <br/>
gears set and talked to me a mile a minute about the wind tunnel he played in <br/>
at the children&#39;s museum yesterday?<br/>
<br/>
And my just turned four year old daughter would have had to have her sleep <br/>
disrupted to accompany us to the grade school.  She slept until 9.  They sleep <br/>
when they are tired and eat when they are hungry.  How can you change that <br/>
midstream?  It would have been an ugly morning of rushing, dressing, indigestion, <br/>
anxiety and probably a good dose of yelling.  And what about when the baby <br/>
comes in January?  What if he&#39;s nursing when it&#39;s time to leave for school?  How <br/>
in the world to people cope with this nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
And these are only the scheduling concerns, not the mind controlling, <br/>
behavior modification concerns I have about school in general.  They don&#39;t know they <br/>
aren&#39;t supposed to learn about the orbits of the earth, sun and moon until the <br/>
second or third grade!  To think I answered their question when they asked, <br/>
we got to the computer and googled some really cool images!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy we are home!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864001717">Excellent Post!!!<br/>
<br/>
My 15 year old has a good friend whose handwriting is so lovely. She <br/>
knows how to do all these graceful serifs and curlicues and such in <br/>
all of her letters...but she has about a 1.7 gpa, because she has <br/>
perfected her &quot;fonts&quot; during class time, doing something quiet at her <br/>
desk so as not to be disruptive in her boredom, because her classes <br/>
mean nothing to her.<br/>
<br/>
Your post, about your boy making the unicorn, reminded me of all the <br/>
hours my daughter&#39;s friend has spent practicing handwriting and <br/>
failing her classes...how much better for her it would be if she <br/>
could just practice her handwriting AND WHATEVER ELSE SHE WANTS <br/>
instead of wasting her time sitting at a desk...<br/>
<br/>
And it reminded me of how blessed my kids are, too. 1:30...at the <br/>
local school, they&#39;re sitting in their desks, some of them practicing <br/>
their fancy writing, some of them drawing pics of fighter jets, some <br/>
of them staring out the window...my kids are making cookies, in <br/>
preparation for putting together homemade ice cream sandwiches.<br/>
<br/>
it is a blessing to be home!<br/>

He got on a school bus at 8:30am and is arriving home about now. He&#39;s 5. My <br/>
friend is very proud of how easily he left her because he&#39;s been in preschool <br/>
for the past 2 years, though she is a little upset that he refused to kiss her <br/>
goodbye in front of the other kids. <br/>
  We visited another homeschool family and then went out for ice cream.<br/>

cluefinders, and our first SIMS game...can&#39;t wait to get started!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a question about SIMS....we were going to buy one at the store (it was <br/>
a sixpack with the sim city classic game in it) and he said unless we have <br/>
the original, we can&#39;t play it.  He said no one sells it anymore either.  But <br/>
when I looked at the pack it said that one of them was the original.  So I <br/>
bought it anyway.  Did this guy know what he&#39;s talking about?  We haven&#39;t tried it <br/>
yet, been so busy with other stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You need the original SIMS game to play the expansions, but that&#39;s a<br/>
different game than Sim Safari, Sim Ant, Sim Mall, etc. The SIMS is a<br/>
neighborhood simulation with lots of different families. The original SIMS<br/>
is still being made.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten lots of the Sim games from the library and all of them are<br/>
immediately playable from just the disc they come on.<br/>

This guy didn&#39;t know what he was talking about. You only have to have the <br/>
original IF you are buying an expansion pack. So if you want an expansion pack <br/>
for say SIM Theme Park then you do have to have the original SIM Theme Park, but <br/>
just to buy any SIM game you don&#39;t have to have THE original SIM game to <br/>
play. That only applies to expansion packs. <br/>
