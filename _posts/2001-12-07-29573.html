 </span></blockquote>Have you read the Babysitter Club books? I like them because they&#39;re about a <br/>
group of strong girls with different skills and interests,and personalities, <br/>
who capably start their own successful business.  They really care about the <br/>
children they babysit for. And the biggest thing stressed in all the books is <br/>
that they are close friends.<br/>
<br/>
Read a couple. Talk to your daughter about why she likes the books. Ask her <br/>
who her favorite characters are and why.  If she likes to draw, she may <br/>
admire Claudia, who is an artist. Whatever, you&#39;ll get some good insight into <br/>
your daughter, and may appreciate the books more.  Enjoy!<br/>

enjoy.  I think I would just bring home a pile of various kinds of books <br/>
from the library each week and let her know that she&#39;s welcome to choose <br/>
any or none of them to read.  Chances are, something on the cover of one of <br/>
them will spark her interest.  You might want to show her the blurb that&#39;s <br/>
either on the back or the inside front cover  of most novels that tells <br/>
something about the book.  Those blurbs are *meant* to hook the reader.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
