This is the site I messed up the other story with; sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I had cut and pasted something, but I&#39;m not going to.  It&#39;s mostly visual <br/>
anyway.  It&#39;s an ever-growing collection of English-language material from <br/>
Japan.  Some is funny translation, but most is product packaging where they <br/>
just thought English names would be cooler.  And some are t-shirts, and some <br/>
of those are shocking.<br/>

(&#39;specially since they goof around on the internet all afternoon when I&#39;m at<br/>
work!)  They showed me some of their favorites.<br/>
