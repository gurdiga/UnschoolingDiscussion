<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787524605"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; A woman in my community teaches Spanish to children in her home.  We took<br/>
 </span></blockquote>one session a year ago in preparation for a trip to Mexico.  It was<br/>
definitely too schoolish for me, but there are lots of people out there who<br/>
want that sort of experience.  She started out with one class, word spread,<br/>
and she is not quite busy.  The thing I liked best about her class is that<br/>
she wanted the parents to stay.  Not all did though, as it wasn&#39;t required.<br/>
She used Risas and Sonrisas.  The program incorporates lots of games.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a single mum unschooling in a tiny community in BC doing that.  She<br/>
also does a bunch of other stuff to make ends meet because there aren&#39;t<br/>
enough people nearby to teach Spanish to.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
