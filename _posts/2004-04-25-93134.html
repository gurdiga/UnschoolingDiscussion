<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956836402">Our 7 y.o. is planning a party (that actually is true of her<br/>
most of the time, LOL).  She has in mind a game that is<br/>
essentially Bingo, but with words she has chosen rather than<br/>
numbers or pre-themed &quot;educational&quot; mess.  I think part of her<br/>
plan is to let the person who Bingo&#39;s first do some sort of<br/>
Madlib activity for an extra prize.<br/>
<br/>
My problem comes in with generating the cards.  I was sure that<br/>
I would find a Bingo card generator on-line somewhere, but no<br/>
luck yet.  I could hand write/table type the 40 cards that I<br/>
suspect this venture requires for maximum fun.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you have in your bag of tricks an on-line Bingo card<br/>
generator, I would be very grateful for the link.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990296304">Thank you!  It&#39;s perfect; I knew it had to exist, but Googling<br/>
just kept sending me off to on-line gambling, no mater how much<br/>
I excluded.  I thank you and my daughter thanks you!<br/>
