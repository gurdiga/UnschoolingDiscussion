<div id="ygrps-yiv-948386388">AHA!!!  One of these.  I&#39;m pretty sure it was the second set, Oskar & Jack.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a TV show on PBS (Nova maybe?) years ago, and the twins I&#39;m <br/>
thinking about both kept their desks exactly the same way, and their closets <br/>
too.   And when interviewed one said it&#39;s because his mom was such a slob and <br/>
he never wanted to be keep house like she did, and the other said it was <br/>
because his mom was so neat and taught him how to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
n Anecdotal twin stories - MZs - 2 boys separated at approximately 1 month, <br/>
adopted by working class families, in Ohio, both named Jim by their adoptive <br/>
families.  When they were reunited as adults the following &quot;coincidences&quot; <br/>
were noted: both developed sinus headaches at age ten, which later became <br/>
migraines, they used the same words to describe their pain. They had <br/>
identical pulse rates and blood pressure. They both held clerical positions <br/>
and liked to do woodworking as a hobby. They both volunteered on police <br/>
forces, enjoyed Florida vacations, married and divorced women named Linda, <br/>
had dogs named Toy, and drove Chevrolets.<br/>
<br/>
n Oskar and Jack - Born in Trinidad. Mother, a German, took Oskar back to G <br/>
w/ her and raised him as a Catholic. He grew up to be a Nazi (youth group). <br/>
His brother, Jack, was raised by the dad in the Carribean and raised as a <br/>
Jew, spent some of his adolescence in Isreal on a kibbutz.  When they were <br/>
reunited, Jack was living in CA and O in G. When they met bqueurs, tended to <br/>
fall asleep while watching TV, kept rubber bands on their wrists, thought it <br/>
was funny to sneeze in a crowd of people, flushed the toilet before using it, <br/>
and read magazines from cover to cover<br/>
