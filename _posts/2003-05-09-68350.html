 </span></blockquote>Usually, we like to live at home...unless we&#39;re up-country, then we like to <br/>
live at camp... (at least until the yurt&#39;s up when I think the yurt&#39;ll be <br/>
our favorite place to live.)  I mean, it&#39;s where all our dishes and <br/>
utensils and beds are.  It&#39;s pretty handy and all to have everything right <br/>
there.<br/>
If we&#39;re traveling, we like to live in a hotel, because of the comfy beds, <br/>
cable TV and the soda vending machines.<br/>
We don&#39;t like campgrounds much - sticks and such under the sleeping bags!  Ugh!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885321020">LOL.  When we had a family of three, we enjoyed living on a semi <br/>
truck for awhile.  We haven&#39;t tried it since I was about six months <br/>
pregnant with the second baby.  It might be a little cramped with <br/>
four people, but it sure would be great for unschooling.<br/>

&gt; Where, in everyone&#39;s opinion, is the best place to live as an unschooling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>family? And why?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re talking about towns, Eugene, Oregon is probably up there. We have<br/>
to test 3 times during the &quot;school years&quot; (3rd grade is the first test, and<br/>
two others after that) but hopefully the Oregon legislature is going to<br/>
change that to no testing soon. Other than that, there seems to be a fair<br/>
number of unschoolers and relaxed homeschoolers here, a good local<br/>
homeschooling group with lots of activities and cool parents to hang out<br/>
with, lots of involved dads (which seems to be the rule in this town in<br/>
general, we always see dads at playgrounds and on bike paths), great access<br/>
to camping, beach, mountains, etc. and a fair number of cultural events for<br/>
a town our size (130,000). Eugeneans use their public library more than<br/>
residents of any other city in America, and we just completed a brand-new<br/>
3-story library.<br/>
Other things I like about the town are the generally relaxed atmosphere and<br/>
the fact that all types of people fit in here, and kids seem to be fairly<br/>
welcome and respected. Eugene is a quirky town and I like the quirks. The<br/>
guy who does Tai Chi while bicycling through town, the guy who has been<br/>
selling Frog Joke Books for twenty years out of a little wagon, the 80 year<br/>
old woman who wears a tall Uncle Sam hat and a paisley dress and dances<br/>
through downtown. People seem to be taken here at more or less face value.<br/>
When my 3 year old dyed her hair purple this year, she got lots of<br/>
compliments, for instance. When my 6 year old approached a guy who runs a<br/>
local gardening store, the man answered all his questions and invited him to<br/>
come back and he&#39;d show him how to propagate plants. It&#39;s just a friendly<br/>
kind of place. Also very environmental, which appeals to me. Hundreds of<br/>
miles of bike paths and trails and tons of people bicycle here. People bring<br/>
their own canvas bags to the grocery store, and stores advertise that they<br/>
use wind or solar power for their electricity. A local bicycle store gives<br/>
away a pound of tofu if you buy a new set of bicycle tires (which is a joke<br/>
on a much bigger car tire chain in the west that gives away free beef with a<br/>
set of car tires).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s my pitch for Eugene today. We really love it here. It could<br/>
have a tad more sunshine in the spring and fall, and colder weather in the<br/>
winter (I&#39;d prefer snow to rain), but that&#39;s my only improvements I&#39;d make.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139403068">Yes, that is what I was asking. Since we are military and have contemplated getting out, I started wondering what places would be the best for an unschooling lifestyle. If we get out of the military, it will be a few years from now though. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be in the states though. Anybody know anything about New Zealand?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129716946"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;Anybody know anything about New Zealand?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My friends just moved there at the start of the year.  So far, they <br/>
are very happy there.  They have mentioned that the people are <br/>
extremely friendly.  You feel comfortable just letting your kids run <br/>
around, barefoot and happy.  They visited for 6 weeks first and <br/>
traveled around in RV--doesn&#39;t that sound yummy!!!  She said every <br/>
where they went people talked to them and made them feel welcome.  I <br/>
guess the best adverstising is that when they went to visit they were <br/>
not planning to make a move like that for about a year, they ended up <br/>
moving about 2-3 months later!  I told my husband that we ARE GOING <br/>
there sometime in the next few years as we have an open invite.  <br/>
&lt;hmmmm&gt; Just dreaming about next years tax returns already!  I did <br/>
see a large homeschooling site for them listed somewhere, but can&#39;t <br/>
remember.  It may have even been on yahoo??<br/>

 </span></blockquote>New Zealand was, for many many years, my dream home.  It is the most <br/>
successful socialist country in the world.  Because it&#39;s an island, many <br/>
*American* items are very expensive, as they&#39;re imported.  Now that LOTR <br/>
spurred our interest farther, I&#39;m terrified of the volcanoes while completely <br/>
awed of the landscape the volcanoes have created there.  <br/>
<br/>
I dunno... having survived a *big* earthquake, natural disasters scare the <br/>
you-know-what right out of me :(  <br/>
So now I&#39;ll put in my plug for western South Dakota, Eastern Wyoming [depends <br/>
on how you want to live] ... this is really the most beautiful place on the <br/>
planet.  You soon realize why the First Peoples held this area sacred.  It is <br/>
a blessing to be so near the Black Hills and I am excited to finally learn <br/>
about my father&#39;s family and TRUE history and make history by carrying on the <br/>
stories to my children.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to my first sweat this evening, it&#39;s a Mother&#39;s Day prayer and I&#39;ll <br/>
be thinking of all of you &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
