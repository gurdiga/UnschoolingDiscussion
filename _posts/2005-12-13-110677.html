Just curious.  What does this word picninny mean to you?<br/>
 <br/>
Add an &quot;a&quot; between the first two syllables and it has a racist, derogatory  <br/>
meaning in my area and I was wondering if this was a different word, different  <br/>
spelling or different meaning.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>

           that&#39;s probably because a lot of people on here are very <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862882377">Well, the event is 10 years old.  I can&#39;t imagine getting all ninny-<br/>
fied today over a little tip of finger.  The point of telling the <br/>
story was to illustrate natural consequences, right?  I &quot;get&quot; the <br/>
concept of natural consquences, so I didn&#39;t need the illustration, <br/>
but that archaic word that I haven&#39;t heard in decades jumped right <br/>
out at me.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say you were being racist or using a racial slur.  I was <br/>
asking if there was another meaning that I didn&#39;t know about.  Since <br/>
it seems that there is no other definition than the racial one, I <br/>
suppose it&#39;s in your best interest not to use it in public, whether <br/>
you mean it racially or not.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the Blitzkrieg definition. Definately fits my brains at <br/>
times lol. <br/>
<br/>
The story related to unschooling because the original posting was <br/>
about children who were on a rocker, rocking it and the mothers were <br/>
allowing them to be thier shiny selves while carefully watching over <br/>
them. The story brought back to mind what happened to my son and I <br/>
wanted to share it. <br/>

And Clement Moore even screwed that up and named his reindeer Donder instead of Donner! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
And also keeping in the season--Narnia opens with with the Blitzkrieg (I wasn&#39;t quite expecting that <br/>
and had to briefly explain why the movie was opening with bombing airplanes! &lt;bwg&gt;). <br/>

<br/>
Well we are very excited to see it, and what is interesting is that Jayn has<br/>
already seen a movie that opens with the Blitzkrieg and has the children&#39;s<br/>
trains in it - &quot;Return to Neverland&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever we go to the movies Jayn and I end up going in and out a few times<br/>
in scary moments. It makes me long for the old days when you could<br/>
apparently just stay and see the movie again if you wanted to. That would be<br/>
an absolute boon to Jayn.<br/>

Well we  are very excited to see it, and what is interesting is that Jayn  has<br/>
already seen a movie that opens with the Blitzkrieg and has the  children&#39;s<br/>
trains in it - &quot;Return to  Neverland&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
And the Peter Pan sequel opens with the Blitzkrieg, too, I think.   What was <br/>
the name of that movie?  The one where Wendy is all grown up  and it&#39;s about <br/>
her daughter?  Can&#39;t remember.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I always associated the term Blitzkrieg with the bombing of London  <br/>
by the Germans.  I know it has a literal meaning, but when I think of the  word <br/>
I think of London automatically.<br/>

Albuquerque is the big city here.  It&#39;s several times larger than the  <br/>
next-biggest cities of Santa Fe, Las Cruces, Roswell, Farmington...<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Espanola and it was frustrating that some little thing  <br/>
would make the news (all stations we got originated in Albuquerque)  <br/>
and a really cool big or horrible thing from around us wouldn&#39;t.    <br/>
They would report the weather in detail for Albuquerque; ours got two  <br/>
numbers.   High school sports in Albuquerque got reported; ours only  <br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I live in Albuquerque, I understand it entirely.  There are  <br/>
time constraints, and if one is doing TV, film is all.  Photos aren&#39;t  <br/>
so great--that could be the newspaper.  And in those days (60&#39;s,  <br/>
70&#39;s) there was no easy way to get even photos quickly from a little  <br/>
town to the city, and it was no one&#39;s paid-for responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
In the 1940&#39;s there wasn&#39;t even any TV.  Newspaper and magazines were  <br/>
it.  People in Coventry and Ely and wherever all else who had  <br/>
dramatic news had other things on their minds than sending someone to  <br/>
London with photos and details, I&#39;m guessing--even sticking the info  <br/>
in a packet on a train wasn&#39;t as important as trying to keep children  <br/>

In the U.S. it&#39;s only fairly lately that we didn&#39;t hear more about  <br/>
New York, Los Angeles and Washington than anywhere else, but  <br/>
comparing the populations of those areas to other cities helps it  <br/>
make sense.  They&#39;re the ones with the newsrooms and reporters too.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845159372">I&#39;m really talking about now. History seems to be centred on London, <br/>
so does tourism. Coventry wasn&#39;t a small place and is right next to <br/>
Britain&#39;s second largest city. It was hot by over  We&#39;re not a very <br/>
big country geographicaly and it wasn&#39;t that long ago that a lot of <br/>
newspapers had a Manchester edition.<br/>
<br/>
Even the national weather leaves a big hole where the Midlands is, <br/>
we don&#39;t even have temperature here. :P Yet the Midlands has the <br/>
second largest city and industry is concentrated here.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like you only hearing about Albaquerque it&#39;s more like <br/>
everyone where you are only hearing about stuff in Washington on the <br/>
main news. We have local news but it doesn&#39;t tend to deal with big <br/>
issues it&#39;s more like &#39;man bites donkey&#39; or &#39;new shopping centre <br/>
built&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
There is still a snobbery here about the north and south with the <br/>
south assuming we&#39;re all uncultured idiots and the midlands doesn&#39;t <br/>
even exist in some peoples&#39; minds. It does affect policy. We are <br/>
also governed from centrally, whereas as far as I can see seperate <br/>
states in the US have more autonomy than here. All government is <br/>
from London with only tweaking done locally.<br/>

Although I live in a small town, because of the things you mentioned, I  hear <br/>
much more about my town on the local news than I did growing up.  High  <br/>
school sports are covered as if they were college teams.  <br/>
 <br/>
I remember growing up and being excited if they even mentioned the town of  <br/>
Redfield on TV.  (I don&#39;t live in Redfield anymore.)  It usually meant  someone <br/>
from Redfield won a contest or was on the news for some other reason, or  a <br/>
tornado hit it or something like that.  But it was exciting!<br/>

  Not that what you have to say isn&#39;t important, it is really just your wording I find funny. Last year (when the kids and I were with Darin on his truck), if we were on a turnpike (pay to use, or toll road) they would usually have the weather posted at the tolls. One Sunday, we were entering the Ohio turnpike, Darin noticed that the weather wasn&#39;t posted. He asked the worker what the weather was like along the road and she answered; &quot;I don&#39;t know, Ohio doesn&#39;t get weather on Sundays.&quot; (There happened to be a huge snow storm we had to drive into) Not so funny, but funny in her (and your) choice of words. ;o)<br/>
