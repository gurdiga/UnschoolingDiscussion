<br/>
I do not want to give up on this yet.  I am committed to removing the harsh chemicals from our home.  But the dirty dishes are a bit embarrassing, I do not wish to hand-wash as I am overwhelmed with ill-health and the needs of three severely allergic children.  I do not know how much longer my husband will hold out on this issue as it is my commitment not his.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Annette<br/>

We rinse first if necessary, and the children are beginning to do much of this.  They are 4,6,and 8 yo.  Part of the problem is that we generate so many dishes daily due to our diet.  We have only one sink, not divided.  I&#39;ve tried placing a liner in part and then still having access to the drain and disposal, but my husband doesn&#39;t get this concept, and places dishes in the part that&#39;s clear so I can get to the drain.  My husband does the dishwasher loading in the evenings and then puts them away in the morning.  He does not rinse much.  He also will put the dishes away dirty!  We do use the shortest wash cycle and the air dry.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a specific recipe or formula for your dishwashing?  <br/>
Thanks,  Annette<br/>

We have two sinks, but I filter water in one of them, and wash in <br/>
the other.  I also don&#39;t fill the sink up with water and cover the <br/>
dishes.  I don&#39;t like trying to get dishes clean using water that is full <br/>
of food, grease, etc.  I keep the water running in a small stream....I <br/>
guess you could turn it off in-between, but it&#39;s a lot of trouble....and <br/>
the drain open.  I have two shaker bottles and two squirt bottles.  <br/>
One shaker has salt, the other shaker has baking soda.  One quirt <br/>
bottle has vinegar, the other has lemon juice.  They sit beside the <br/>
sink, ready to be used when needed.  I use a stiff boar-bristle brush <br/>
with a long handle, and a soft sponge.  If something is greasy, I <br/>
start out with lemon juice.  I squirt some on, and use the scrubber <br/>
sponge to spread it around and wash off the grease.  If there is <br/>
stuck on food, I will then probably sprinkle on some salt and scrub <br/>
it around, loosening up the food.  It&#39;s really hard to describe which <br/>
one to use on which kind of dirty dish, you really just have to <br/>
experiment with them.  But I find it an easy way to get the dishes <br/>
clean.  Oh, sometimes I will put both vinegar and baking soda in a <br/>
dish with something really stuck on, and get that natural scrubbing <br/>
bubbles action.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every dishwasher I have ever had, the instruction manuel said you <br/>
had to rinse the dishes first.  In the first home we ever had, I didn&#39;t <br/>
read the instruction manual, and shortly after we moved in there, <br/>
the dishwasher started leaking water out into the floor.  We called <br/>
a repairman, who promptly pulled out the trap in the bottom of the <br/>
dishwasher, which was full of food.  He told me it was imperative to <br/>
rinse the dishes first, because the food particles can stop up the <br/>
drain which empties the water out of the dishwasher.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I am only going by personal experience and what the <br/>
instruction book said.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, there is something very satisfying about washing them by <br/>
hand, having the water running over your hands, using natural <br/>
materials....I&#39;ve tried to get my kids to understand that anything <br/>
can be a spiritual experience if you think of it in that way.  I know, <br/>
you are probably laughing right now thinking about washing dishes <br/>
as a spiritual experience.  But sometimes, the only way I can <br/>
make myself do something I really don&#39;t want to do is to give it <br/>
special meaning, and find something about it I can appreciate and <br/>
enjoy.  <br/>

Angela - Well . . .  about the good dishwasher  . . . I&#39;ll take your dishwasher when you are done with it!  We moved to a suburb of D.C. when my spouse was in the military, and we did not know how long we would be here.  We were also in sticker shock about prices.  We have a rental home in a good neighborhood.  The landlord wishes to put no money into it. We have 40 yo linoleum and kitchen cabinets.  The dishwasher is the cheapest available.  There is no place for any pieces of food to collect or drain.  I&#39;ve read the instructions which direct us to clean out the water spray openings if we notice the dishes aren&#39;t getting clean as it may mean food has clogged them since there is no place for the food to go!  We would buy a house, but the prices have risen exponentially in recent months.  <br/>

The table and chair washing activities were often used to help the child focus, relax, and &quot;spend some time alone&quot; inside themselves while surrounded by others.  My oldest dd&#39;s first M-directress would even take up a table washing exercise when she wanted to refocus.  After she mentioned this to me, I noticed that I also can enjoy cleaning, even dishes, for the peaceful, even spiritual effect it has.  <br/>

<br/>
&gt; I do not believe this to be true.  Modern dishwashers use very little<br/>
water<br/>
&gt; and if your water is hot from your oil burner before it goes into your<br/>
&gt; dishwasher, it uses very little electricity.  Also if you buy a good<br/>
&gt; dishwasher, you do not need to rinse the dishes before it washes them.<br/>
The<br/>
&gt; only thing my dishwasher doens&#39; t get off dishes is cream of wheat.  I may<br/>
&gt; look it up for you later to see how much electricity and water it uses,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; right now I am wiped out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Angela (who loves her dishwasher)<br/>
&gt;     It doesn&#39;t take any longer to wash than<br/>
&gt;   it does to rinse (I&#39;ve timed myself).  Also, how old are your<br/>
&gt;   children?  They can start taking some of the responsibility of<br/>
&gt;   washing, so it doesn&#39;t all fall on you.  Also, if you have each person<br/>
&gt;   wash their own dish, silverware, and glass and put them in the<br/>
&gt;   drainer after they are done eating, there is virtually nothing to clean<br/>
&gt;   up.  Also, dishwashers use more water, electricity, and gas than<br/>
&gt;   regular dish washing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504547112">These are the stats for my dishwasher, a KitchenAid Quiet Scrub.<br/>
It uses between 4 and 8 gallons of water depending on which cycle you use.<br/>
If you use light china, it uses 4 gallons.  If you use Normal, it uses 6<br/>
gallons.  If you use potscrubber, it uses 8 gallons.  My dishwasher has a<br/>
food grinder in the bottom that grinds up any food that makes it&#39;s way to<br/>
the bottom of the dishwasher therefore no food sticks on the dishes.<br/>
<br/>
When I spoke with a representative, she said if you have an electric hot<br/>
water heater, you use approx. $55 a year in electricity for an average<br/>
family.  If you have a gas hot water heater, it uses approx. $35<br/>
annually.(This does include heating the water, which you have to do anyway<br/>
to wash by hand)  My hot water is heated off our oil burner and uses quite a<br/>
bit less energy than both electricity and gas. (at current prices)  I<br/>
challenge any of you who do dishes by hand to to the same amount of dishes<br/>
that fit into my dishwasher by hand and keep track of the water you use.<br/>
Rinsing takes a lot of water, esp. if you leave it running while you do the<br/>
dishes.  8 gallons might sound like a lot, but it isn&#39;t if you are standing<br/>
there doing dishes.<br/>
<br/>
It still takes electricity or some energy source to heat the water you wash<br/>
dishes with.  And I generally use the light china cycle on my dishwasher.<br/>
(only uses 4 gallons)<br/>

water<br/>
&gt; &gt;and if your water is hot from your oil burner before it goes into your<br/>
&gt; &gt;dishwasher, it uses very little electricity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is true. I used to be an &quot;Ecoteam&quot; participant and leader with the<br/>
GAP<br/>
&gt; (Global Action Plan) ecoteams project. One of the things that GAP has done<br/>
&gt; is to research which changes people can make that make a difference in<br/>
&gt; energy consumption, waste, etc. I remember that in the booklet I had, they<br/>
&gt; said that if you fully load the average dishwasher, it is more energy and<br/>
&gt; water efficient to use the dishwasher than to wash the dishes by hand.<br/>
&gt; Incidentally, if anyone is interested in finding out more about the<br/>
Ecoteams<br/>
&gt; program, I highly recommend it. Info at:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036721048">Well, been there and done that as we used to have a gray water system.<br/>
Personally, with a family of 6 we used between 6 and 7 gallons of water, on<br/>
an average per day doing 2 loads of dishes.  It was one of the kidlets<br/>
projects.  When I personally did the dishes, I used less than 5.  Hubby used<br/>
the most, so I tend to keep him out of the kitchen &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The amount of water used and the source for heating water aside, dishwashers<br/>
still use energy (electricity) that isn&#39;t used when dishes are done by hand<br/>
unless you are living at the local university and have one powered by a<br/>
bicycle.  Generally speaking they use harsher chemical based detergents<br/>
(unless one is using organic/natural earth friendly stuff) that are more<br/>
expensive which again runs the total cost both to the environment and the<br/>
budget up.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; These are the stats for my dishwasher, a KitchenAid Quiet Scrub.<br/>
&gt; It uses between 4 and 8 gallons of water depending on which cycle you use.<br/>
&gt; If you use light china, it uses 4 gallons.  If you use Normal, it uses 6<br/>
&gt; gallons.  If you use potscrubber, it uses 8 gallons.  My dishwasher has a<br/>
&gt; food grinder in the bottom that grinds up any food that makes it&#39;s way to<br/>
&gt; the bottom of the dishwasher therefore no food sticks on the dishes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I spoke with a representative, she said if you have an electric hot<br/>
&gt; water heater, you use approx. $55 a year in electricity for an average<br/>
&gt; family.  If you have a gas hot water heater, it uses approx. $35<br/>
&gt; annually.(This does include heating the water, which you have to do anyway<br/>
&gt; to wash by hand)  My hot water is heated off our oil burner and uses quite<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; bit less energy than both electricity and gas. (at current prices)  I<br/>
&gt; challenge any of you who do dishes by hand to to the same amount of dishes<br/>
&gt; that fit into my dishwasher by hand and keep track of the water you use.<br/>
&gt; Rinsing takes a lot of water, esp. if you leave it running while you do<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; dishes.  8 gallons might sound like a lot, but it isn&#39;t if you are<br/>
standing<br/>
&gt; there doing dishes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It still takes electricity or some energy source to heat the water you<br/>
wash<br/>
&gt; dishes with.  And I generally use the light china cycle on my dishwasher.<br/>
&gt; (only uses 4 gallons)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Your dishwasher uses between 1800 and 2400 watts per hour of electricity<br/>
&gt;   which is energy that you wouldn&#39;t be using if you washed by hand.  The<br/>
&gt;   average dishwasher (according to the Tampa water department) uses 15<br/>
&gt; gallons<br/>
&gt;   of water with water saving models using around 10.  The average for<br/>
&gt;   handwashing is 5 - 7 gallons.<br/>

hooked up to the dishwasher, *doing the dishes*!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only person on this list who does not own a dishwasher?<br/>
