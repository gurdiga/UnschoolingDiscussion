 </span></blockquote>I just couldn&#39;t resist the opening... and I&#39;ve been meaning to post for a<br/>
while, since I asked for dog input a couple of weeks ago and then<br/>
disappeared. I did really appreciate everyone&#39;s posts, and I had great<br/>
fun researching different dog breeds online, and reading about everyone&#39;s<br/>
wonderful canine companions. Thanks you all...<br/>
<br/>
Julie sent a post right about Nana, the border collie who had wandered up<br/>
to her porch a few months ago and needed a new place to live. We emailed<br/>
back and forth a few times, and Nana arrived at the Sacramento airport<br/>
last Tuesdays. Yes, we have a DOG! <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s had a pretty rough life before finding Julie, and was pretty<br/>
freaked out by the long trip and new environment. She&#39;s feeling more<br/>
comfortable now, though. She comes to Rain and me for petting sometimes,<br/>
and she really loves our cats and rats. She watches both of them for a<br/>
long, long time, slowly edging closer and closer. Our cats are old and<br/>
fat and cranky and not a lot of fun (at least by Nana&#39;s standards - they<br/>
won&#39;t play herding games) so they sit until she gets too close and then<br/>
yowl, which makes her jump back ... and then they start the process all<br/>
over again. She&#39;s slowly exploring the farm - she generally sticks close<br/>
to our house and is still scared of the three farm dogs (they&#39;re all big<br/>
and a bit dopey, I think eventually they&#39;re make friends) so we generally<br/>
put them inside when we let her out. The farmers have been harvesting the<br/>
cotton from the fields right around us, so there&#39;s been a lot of loud<br/>
machinery out there - once that&#39;s done it will be peaceful again. She&#39;s<br/>
scared when people come visit, all except for our 3 yr old friend Ellie,<br/>
which was pretty cool - with Ellie she wagged her tail and came up to be<br/>
petted. <br/>
<br/>
So, we&#39;re happy :-) She also has a new Jerry Bears collar and a tag with<br/>
Nana Quinlan on it, and our phone number. We&#39;re looking forward to<br/>
watching her blossom as she gets more comfortable.<br/>

This is a wonderful story and I&#39;m thinking you and Julie are pretty<br/>
wonderful people for making a difference in the life of Nana.  <br/>
I&#39;m glad you let us know how it all worked out.  <br/>
