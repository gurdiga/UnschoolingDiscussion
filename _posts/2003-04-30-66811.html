<div id="ygrps-yiv-377859905">when I posted here in Jan/Feb for a week or so, there were a few <br/>
posts from (someone) from the archives, about a nervous mom whose <br/>
kids did so much TV and video, and the struggles she was having to <br/>
trust that they&#39;d eventually get over it.<br/>
<br/>
CAn someone point me to those posts? I saw them end of Jan, early <br/>
Feb, but they were from archives. Or articles about nervous parents <br/>
who watch their kids in front of the TV and video games, who got over <br/>
it. Or, links about the blossoming of the kids when they finished <br/>
deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
SOMETHING to help me keep my tongue behind my teeth as Robby veges <br/>
out. :) my hubby, too.<br/>
<br/>
thanks, Heidi who is off to read that article again, on deschooling.</div>

threads.  It almost always turns into video and games.<br/>

<br/>
I did a search on this board for TV and Video Games and came across a <br/>
couple of good discussions. I&#39;ll hit unschooling.com and do a search <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,HeidiC<br/>
<br/>
p.s. is there another HeidiC running around in the unschooling online <br/>
community? I saw someone who looked JUST LIKE ME L at &quot;Learning for <br/>
Life&quot; board while lurking there.<br/>
