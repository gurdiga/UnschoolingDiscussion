&lt;&lt; , but after reading what you all have to say on the matter, I think I will <br/>
 ignore her request for more information and keep the second letter for <br/>
myself <br/>
 as something to read when I need to vent to myself &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, I&#39;m kinda glad you decided that.<br/>
My thinking was more along the lines that you&#39;d be giving them power by <br/>
aqiescing to their request. There are times we need to stand up for what we <br/>
believe, loudly and strongly...this was not one of them imo.<br/>
They had no right to ask for anything further and by giving them anything <br/>
more it just makes them in control still. yk?<br/>
I think your letter was great though!!! <br/>
