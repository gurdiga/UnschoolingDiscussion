addresses)...<br/>

There is a homeschooler info night at the Mt. Pleasant library tonight at <br/>
6:30.  Some of the people who unschool will be there and I thought I&#39;d let <br/>
you know.  It&#39;s open to anyone, not for one particular group, and I&#39;ll be <br/>
there with my two girls.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can come,<br/>
