<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731232465">Hi,<br/>
   some thistle down can be quite uniform in its release. They shoot up up <br/>
into the air one by one very suddenly. It&#39;s not perfectly uniform but it&#39;s <br/>
more uniform than say a Dandelion as Dandelion seeds are much lighter.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you can &#39;see&#39; what I mean but the seed catches the wind and <br/>
shoots up. It may be only a few seeds go but they do seem to fly upwards. I <br/>
guess they have to get a certain wind velocity to carry them.<br/>
