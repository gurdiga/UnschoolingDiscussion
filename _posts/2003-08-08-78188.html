<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082931436">Wow, way ahead of you there!  I was in the hospital a month last year <br/>
for that very problem.  I have had a lot of bumps on my path here.  I&#39;m <br/>
just starting to feel like I can actively parent.  My adrenals are <br/>
shot, my liver is trying to play catch up, had surgery while I was <br/>
pregnant with Crispin, had to quit nursing at 8 weeks, been driving to <br/>
the farm every week for over a year to get raw milk to make his formula <br/>
from scratch so I don&#39;t have to feed him Nastie.  I still consider it <br/>
whining, but I do come from a fair amount of crap to whine about.  <br/>
Mostly got it resolved now - I mean I feel close to normal.  It&#39;s <br/>
mostly tweaking the hormones at this point and I think I found the <br/>
right person to help me with that finally.  I knew it was that from the <br/>
very beginning, but the stupid docs kept telling me I was bi-polar and <br/>
my thyroid was fine!  I never asked *once* about my stupid thyroid!  <br/>
They just listened with closed ears, cost me my nursing relationship <br/>
and a year of parenting.<br/>
Wow!  Sorry!  you guys seem to have hit some chords that are helping me <br/>
vent anew.  Hope you don&#39;t mind.  Your honesty is refreshing and I&#39;m <br/>
finding it very helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501806597">hi heather!<br/>
<br/>
wow, i really relate to *so much* of what you&#39;ve written in recent <br/>
messages. woo, have you got a lot on your plate! <br/>
<br/>
regarding this bit about the liver and adrenals, and depression-or-<br/>
something-like-it in general, here are some of the things that help <br/>
me (when i can muster up the determination to actually *do* them):<br/>
<br/>
-start each day with a *full liter* of tepid water spiked with the <br/>
juice of half a fresh lemon. drink all the water, all at once, first <br/>
thing every morning on an empty stomach. it then takes about 20 <br/>
minutes to flush out your system. this is a little thing but it makes <br/>
a really big difference.<br/>
<br/>
-drink 2-3 cups roasted dandelion root tea daily to support the <br/>
liver. the flavor is closer to coffee than &quot;tea&quot;. (no caffeine, <br/>
though.) eat more fresh fruits & vegetables, less simple carbs.<br/>
<br/>
-hatha yoga classes. (emphasis on *class*, not just a video, <br/>
especially for beginners. i&#39;m a former iyengar yoga teacher and feel <br/>
it&#39;s very important to have proper personalized guidance to attain <br/>
maximum benefit from yogasana and to avoid strain or injury.) <br/>
<br/>
-acupuncture. i can&#39;t tell you what a difference this makes for me! <br/>
it lifts my mood, keeps my head clearer and gives me more energy. my <br/>
health insurance actually covers a huge chunk of the cost, too! <br/>
during the 8 weeks that i was neither pregnant nor breastfeeding in <br/>
the last 5 years, my L.Ac. put me on adrenal-supportive herbs that <br/>
helped me tremendously. (massage is also fantastic, and some health <br/>
insurance plans cover that too! boy, would i love to start one day <br/>
each week with a massage!)<br/>
<br/>
-sharing the weight. my mother-in-law just moved in with us 3 weeks <br/>
ago. before then, we had no family locally, and all of our friends <br/>
were moving out-of-state one after another. i&#39;d spent the better part <br/>
of 5 years with no babysitter, no &quot;dates&quot; with hubby, no helping hand <br/>
around the house unless hubby was available and little social <br/>
interaction. (we&#39;re a one-vehicle family and it for the last year <br/>
hasn&#39;t been practical for me to take hubby to work so i can have the <br/>
van. it&#39;s been a rough year!) MIL&#39;s living with us is a temporary <br/>
arrangement, just until she gets her own place in this area (which is <br/>
well in the works). so she won&#39;t always be here to wash my dishes <br/>
every night, but she will be just across town when i need an extra <br/>
hand or a little &quot;me time&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
what *didn&#39;t* help me, oddly enough, is counseling. maybe i had a bad <br/>
counselor or just didn&#39;t really need it, but it was such a huge waste <br/>
of my time and money.<br/>
<br/>
if you can give your depression a name that will allow the energy to <br/>
move outward (eg, &quot;anger&quot;), that can help tremendously too. i&#39;ve <br/>
decided to face the fact that i&#39;m absolutely furious about a lot of <br/>
things in my past and present situations. my acupuncturist (who is a <br/>
trained jungian analyst) said i should wear a lot of red. well, i had <br/>
almost no red whatsoever in my wardrobe so i did some shopping, and i <br/>
must say i&#39;m very glad i did! it&#39;s subtle, but color therapy does <br/>
make a noticeable difference.<br/>
<br/>
it also helps me to get creative. make stuff. draw, paint, write, <br/>
make origami mobiles, whatever. this can be interesting with the kids <br/>
around, as i really prefer to have my own creative space. so i either <br/>
give them a project or their own, or wait until they are busy or <br/>
asleep to dive into my creative work.<br/>
<br/>
well, i hope some of that inspires you. and if not, just know that <br/>
someone else out there understands the sort of thing you&#39;re going <br/>
through, and is sending pleasant thoughts & &quot;vibes&quot; your way. :)<br/>
<br/>
you mentioned hormones needing tweaking. are you estrogen dominant? <br/>
i&#39;ve been meaning to get to a local ND recommended by my L.Ac. to get <br/>
my hormone levels tested and see about getting myself on a good <br/>
progesterone cream. i get the impression that&#39;s the sort of thing you <br/>
were referring to. if you try it, would you let me know your <br/>
experience? i&#39;ve heard a lot of praises about natural progesterone <br/>
cream and am really intrigued.<br/>
<br/>
take care!<br/>
