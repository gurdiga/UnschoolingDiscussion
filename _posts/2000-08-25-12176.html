we attended this conference, which was this past May, my dh became an adamant <br/>
unschooler.  Something clicked.  He came away telling me that kids shouldn&#39;t <br/>
even think about academics until they&#39;re twelve, that the body of knowledge <br/>
is changing so rapidly we can&#39;t possibly to hope to learn what we need to <br/>
know in school or even homeschooling with a curriculum, that our kids will <br/>
learn what they need to when they need to -- period!.  I accused him of being <br/>
a pod person (a la Invasion of the Body Snatchers).  This is the man who <br/>
three years ago told me that there would be no gaps in the education of his <br/>
children, that it would be my job to research all the available curriculum <br/>
packages, to choose the one that was the most rigorous and comprehensive, and <br/>
that cost was no object.  Zack was 4, going on 5, at the time.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL.  Were you a debater in school?<br/>
<br/>
My husband observed after the last unschooling conference that we went to <br/>
that homeschooling, the research into it, the websites, the books, the <br/>
conferences, the support groups, are overwhelmingly feminine in nature.  <br/>
That&#39;s completely understandable since moms are the primary homeschoolers.  <br/>
He sees in talking with other hs dads, that there is often the attitude that <br/>
homeschooling is the mom&#39;s job, and that the dad may have some concerns about <br/>
it, but if she&#39;s willing to commit to it, he&#39;s willing to &quot;give it a try&quot;.  <br/>
But, they often take a wait and see attitude.  Then, as time progresses, and <br/>
the dad sees that the children and mom are happy, productive people, that the <br/>
kids are learning and they won&#39;t be social misfits, he &quot;comes around&quot; and <br/>
becomes an advocate.  <br/>
<br/>
This happened with my husband, too.  But wouldn&#39;t it be so much more <br/>
productive if we could bring these guys around sooner?  We could save so much <br/>
emotional energy if we didn&#39;t have to deal with our job--homeschooling--and <br/>
with our partner&#39;s doubts, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your husband has de-schooled. Isn&#39;t it great how it works! When I started <br/>
out I had all these wonderful plans for unit studies that I thought would be <br/>
fun, and interesting, and could incorporate all the usual school subjects <br/>
into one topic. It didn&#39;t take me long to find out that what sounded fun and <br/>
interesting to me might sound dumb and boring to the kids. Or, more likely, <br/>
it would appeal to one kid, but not the others. So, after a few months of <br/>
trying to force people to participate in all my carefully planned fun, I <br/>
began my own de-schooling too.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though, after two years, it seems that the kids would like to do some <br/>
of the things that I threw out. Now that they are truly free to learn what <br/>
they want, they do want to learn. Now they will put the effort into it, and <br/>
seem to be able to appreciate each others contributions and interests. So, <br/>
we may do a unit. This time, however, it won&#39;t be me planning it all out and <br/>
telling them what they are to do.<br/>
<br/>
School starts in our district tomorrow. We traditionally have breakfast in <br/>
our garden and watch the bus pass by. We celebrate our freedom and do a <br/>
little thinking and talking about where we want to go with school this year <br/>
and what we would like to do. When they went to school I always video taped <br/>
them on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first day <br/>
went. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of <br/>
school when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a wonderful <br/>
family that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats interrupting <br/>
each other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference there <br/>
is now.<br/>

relief when you see it.  When my nephew started first grade a couple of weeks <br/>
ago (August 4th -- can you believe school starts that early here in the <br/>
Dallas area?)  I wanted to shake my sister-in-law and tell her to wake up!  <br/>
My nephew is an extremely active boy, and I will be so surprised if he <br/>
actually fits into the classroom.  Time will tell.<br/>
