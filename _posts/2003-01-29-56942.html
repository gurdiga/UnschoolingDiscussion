<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080441200">I have been processing the recent discussions<br/>
on the list, no I haven&#39;t felt comfortable<br/>
about the recent discussions.<br/>
But I am only a member not the moderator.<br/>
<br/>
I homeschooled for 2 years, my son went back<br/>
to PS, and quite suddenly, here I am back to<br/>
homeschooling. <br/>
In the beginning this group became my guide.<br/>
Although Sandra doesn&#39;t remember me, she was the one<br/>
person that I was able to present my questions to,<br/>
I would IM her, and she was always willing to give<br/>
her time to me. One night I IM&#39;d her in tears as I <br/>
had just returned from a homeschool picnic and felt<br/>
totally not fitting the pattern of the homeschool parents that <br/>
were in attendance. I was also cornered, and yes, I also brought<br/>
up unschooling.<br/>
She was a godsend.<br/>
The first thing I did when deciding to re-homeschool was to  rejoin this <br/>
group. I needed<br/>
the support and felt like I was with people that understood<br/>
my decision, and how important my child&#39;s future was to me.<br/>
<br/>
I will be honest and let you all know that I was in a very<br/>
abusive marriage, there wasn&#39;t a day that I wasn&#39;t walking<br/>
on pins and needles, I was called every name in the book,<br/>
I was spoken to with the words that have been mentioned<br/>
in the posts. There were nights that I thought I wouldn&#39;t live<br/>
through his rages, and times I literally had to fight for my life.<br/>
<br/>
Time has healed a lot of that, my hopes are that no one here<br/>
even has had to go through any of it, ever. The words in print brought<br/>
a lot of it back for me.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a post to ridicule anyone, I don&#39;t want anything except<br/>
for you to hear me. I will give myself a few days to think about<br/>
leaving this group. Thank you all for giving me the strength to fight<br/>
for my son when I needed strength, the support when I felt I was on shaky <br/>
ground<br/>
and enabling me to let me child know he can be anything he wants to be.<br/>
Thank you Joyce, Sandra and members.<br/>
<br/>

I did remember some of it, and I said so in an instant message a couple of <br/>
days ago.<br/>
<br/>
But remembering IMs isn&#39;t the same as knowing a person really closely.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry the things we were lightly discussing brought up painful memories <br/>
for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084972045">Hi Linda L. - I swear regularly, but not around people it bothers, even<br/>
though I&#39;ve never understood WHY it bothers them.  In your case, I can<br/>
definitely understand why it would bother you.  I&#39;m the same way about<br/>
yelling - when people yell I can feel swept back to my childhood in a<br/>
very overwhelming way.  It must be very difficult for you.  ~Rue<br/>
