The British Medical Journal<br/>
December 24, 1949<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a curious fact that one of the operations most commonly performed in <br/>
this country is also accorded the least critical consideration.  In order to <br/>
this country is also accorded the least critical consideration.  In order to <br/>
decide whether a child&#39;s foreskin should be ablated, the normal anatomy and <br/>
function of the structure at different ages should be understood; the danger <br/>
of conserving the foreskin must then be weighed against the hazards of the <br/>
operation, the mortality and the after-effects of which must be known.  The <br/>
intention of this paper is to marshal the facts required by those concerned <br/>
with deciding the fate of the child&#39;s foreskin.<br/>
-----<br/>
Male circumcision, often associated with analogous sexual mutilations of the <br/>
female, such as clitoric circumcision and infibulation, is practised over a <br/>
wide area of the world by one-sixth the population.  Over the Near East, <br/>
patchily thoughout tribal Africa, amongst the Moslem peoples of India and of <br/>
South-East Asia, and amongst the Australasian aborigines circumcision has <br/>
been regularly practised for as long as we can tell.  The earliest Egyptian <br/>
nummies (2300 B.C.) were circumcised, and wall paintings to be seen in Egypt <br/>
show it was customary several thousand years earlier still.<br/>
-----<br/>
The Younger Child<br/>
The prepuce is still in the course of developing at the time of birth, and <br/>
the fact that its separation is usually still incomplete renders the normal <br/>
prepuce of the newborn non-retractable.  (It will be seen that preputial <br/>
&#39;adhesions&#39; is an inapposite term to apply to the incompletely separated <br/>
prepuce, suggesting as it does that the prepuce and glans were formerly <br/>
separate structures.)  The age at which complete separation of the prepuce <br/>
with full retractability spontaneously occurs, varies up to five years.<br/>
Function of the Prepuce<br/>
It is often stated that the prepuce is a vestigial structure devoid of <br/>
function.  However, it seems to be no accident that during the years when in <br/>
child is incontinent the glans is completely clothed the the prepuce, for, <br/>
deprived of this protection, the glans becomes susceptible to injury from <br/>
contact with sodden clothes or diapers.  Meatal ulcer is almost confined to <br/>
circumcised male infants, and is only occasionally seen in the uncircumcised <br/>
child when the prepuce happens to be unusually lax and the glans consequently <br/>
exposed.  <br/>
<br/>
Amongst the Western nations the circumcision of infants is a common practice <br/>
only with the English speaking peoples.  It is, for the most part, not the <br/>
custom in continental Europe or Scandinavia, or in South America.<br/>
-----<br/>
Circumcision, like any other operation, is subject to the risks of <br/>
haemorrhage and sepsis, and, where a general anaesthetic is employed, to the <br/>
risk of anaisthetic death.<br/>
<br/>
About 16 deaths in children under five years occur each year from <br/>
circumcision.  In most of the fatalities which have come to my notice death <br/>
has occurred for no apparent reason under anaesthesia, but haemorrhage and <br/>
infection have sometimes proved fatal.<br/>
-----<br/>
Since in the newborn infant the prepuce is nearly always non-retractable, <br/>
remaining so generally for much of the first year at least, and since this <br/>
normal non-retractability is not due to tightness of the prepuce relative to <br/>
the glans but to incomplete separation of these two structures, it follows <br/>
that phimosis (which implies a pathological constriction of the prepuce) <br/>
cannot properly be applied to the infant.  Further, the commonly performed <br/>
manipulation known as &#39;stretching the foreskin&#39; by forcibly opening sinus <br/>
forceps inserted in the preputial orifice cannot be justified on anatomical <br/>
grounds, besides being painful and traumatizing.  In spite of the fact that <br/>
the preputial orifice often appears minute-the so-called pin-hole meatus-its <br/>
effective lumen, when tested by noting whether or not a good stream of urine <br/>
is passed is almost invariably found to be adequate.<br/>
<br/>
Infants with umbilical or inguinal hernia are particularly liable to suffer <br/>
circumcision on account of &#39;phimosis&#39;, but if this simple test is applied, <br/>
rarely will any obstruction to the urinary flow be found present.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally the preputial orifice is imperfectly related to the external <br/>
meatus, so that the urinary stream balloons out the subpreputial space; this <br/>
can be easily remedied by gently separating the prepuce from the glans in the <br/>
region of the meatus by means of a probe.  True phimosis cauring urinary <br/>
obstruction is exceedingly rare: in the cases I have seen in which this <br/>
diagnosis has been made, simple separation of the prepuce has shown that <br/>
there was no constriction of the preputial tributable to operation rather <br/>
than to any pathological orifice.<br/>
-----<br/>
Through ignorance of the anatomy of the prepuce in infancy, mothers and <br/>
nurses are often instructed to draw the child&#39;s foreskin back regularly, on <br/>
the supposition that stretching of the foreskin is what is required.  I have <br/>
on three occasions seen young boys with a paraphimosis caused by mothers or <br/>
nurses who have obediently carried out such instructions; for, although the <br/>
size of the prepuce does allow the glans to be delivered, the fit is often a <br/>
close one and slight swelling of the glans, such as may result from forceful <br/>
efforts at retraction, may make its reduction difficult.<br/>
-----<br/>
Summary<br/>
The development of the prepuce is incomplete in the newborn male child, and <br/>
separation from the glans, rendering it retractable, does not usually occur <br/>
until some time between 9 months and 3 years.  True phimosis is extremely <br/>
rare in infancy.<br/>
<br/>
During the first year or two of life, when the infant is incontinent, the <br/>
prepuce fulfils an essential function in protecting the glans.  Its removal <br/>
predisposes to meatal ulceration.<br/>
<br/>
The many and varied reasons commonly advanced for circumcising infants are <br/>
critically examined.  None are convincing.<br/>
<br/>
In the light of these facts a conservative attitude towards the prepuce is <br/>
proposed, and a routine for its hygiene is suggested.  If adopted this would <br/>
eliminate the vast majority of the tens of thousands of circumcision <br/>
operations performed anually in this country, along with their yearly toll of <br/>
some 16 child deaths.<br/>
