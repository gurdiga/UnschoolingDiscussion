<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812179758">==No one sits around  discussing whether the fussy baby needs to nurse *right now* or not  <br/>
<br/>
and then decide &quot;no&quot; &lt;g&gt;.==<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest was a baby and it was bedtime and my middle son wanted a book, I would ask him if he wanted me to read the book or nurse the baby first. He always said I should nurse the baby and he&#39;d wait because he didn&#39;t want to hear the baby cry. Even now when we go to bed sometimes he tells me to give his little brother milk even if little brother doesn&#39;t ask for it.<br/>

As he &quot;always said&quot; nurse, that&#39;s an easy story to tell.  If he had  <br/>
said &quot;read the book first,&quot; then what?<br/>
