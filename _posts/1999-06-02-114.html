<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621451913">Same with me. I tend to do most of my stuff at night as well. Mostly I read<br/>
in the morning or early afternoon, and mostly sleep in the late afternoon!<br/>
*smile* I stay up until about midnight or one in the morning, and get up<br/>
around eight or nine. I used to feel guilty (when I first started<br/>
unschooling) for staying up till two in the morning and sleeping until ten<br/>
(my sister was worse -- she&#39;d sleep until one in the afternoon!), but now<br/>
I&#39;m fine with it. I mean, I get things done! :) ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
