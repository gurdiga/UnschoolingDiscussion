<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696281779">&lt;&lt;  The parents  have to go through training classes when the child gets<br/>
in. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Training for what? Is this some sort of indoctrination?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Laura<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The original Head Start program took kids from REALLY impoverished<br/>
(deprived of strength, resources, etc) families and then also taught the<br/>
parents nutrition, job, and parenting skills.  Their fantastic results<br/>
have been taken out of context to make people believe that all very young<br/>
children would benefit from regular, organized programs outside the home<br/>
(like preschool and extended kindergarten.)  Along the same lines, the<br/>
founder of Montessori worked with children who were considered incapable<br/>
of learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And, this being America, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll soon come up with a new<br/>
 </span></blockquote>prescription drug or perhaps evening courses and certification programs<br/>
in<br/>
order to shore up any slight weakening which may occur in the<br/>
child-mother<br/>
bond.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It sounds like they didn&#39;t want to admit this could be a problem! <br/>
Reminds me of the one this past summer (was it a book?) that found peers<br/>
to be a greater influence than parents.  Gee, could this be because<br/>
children enrolled in school and numerous activities rarely see their<br/>
parents?  Oh, I forgot about all that quality time spent in the car<br/>
driving to and from all those activities!<br/>

Thanks.  I needed that.<br/>
