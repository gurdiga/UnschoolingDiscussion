<div id="ygrps-yiv-824166679">Steffan Heuer is a writer for the Industry Standard (www.thestandard.com),<br/>
working on a story about how the Internet has affected and is being used for<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He is interested in getting responses from as many homeschoolers as possible<br/>
for the following questions:<br/>
<br/>
-- How has homeschooling changed since the rise of the Net, a) for the<br/>
parents<br/>
who are teaching AND b) the kids on the other hand: upsides and downsides of<br/>
the medium<br/>
<br/>
-- How are specific families using the technology -- you pointed out how<br/>
connected your family is, but I&#39;m not sure whether that&#39;s common or an<br/>
exception. (I told him that we probably weren&#39;t typical with 3 desktops, a<br/>
laptop and a handheld all on a 100MBPS network, all with internet access and<br/>
individual e-mail accounts for the kids)<br/>
<br/>
-- Has the Net convinced parents to embrace homeschooling and why?<br/>
<br/>
-- How do parents and children communicate using the Net: to what extent do<br/>
they use chat, message boards, email etc.?<br/>
<br/>
-- What does that mean for the contested issue of socialization through<br/>
homeschooling vs. attending a regular school?<br/>
<br/>
-- Economic factors: Does the Internet help make homeschooling most<br/>
cost-efficient or do families tend to buy/outsource more teaching in terms<br/>
of<br/>
buying curriculum packages etc, online, signing their children up for<br/>
distance-learning schools etc.?<br/>
<br/>
