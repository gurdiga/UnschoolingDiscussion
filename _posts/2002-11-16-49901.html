<div id="ygrps-yiv-624054102">I can probably be a little more specific!<br/>
Being adopted is something I have always been. I have always had brown hair, <br/>
liked purple, eaten well, and been adopted.<br/>
Healthy knowledgeable adoptive parents (Which are who I will refer to in this <br/>
email as abusiveness comes from both types of parents and I&#39;m not addressing <br/>
that) are not going to hide something like adoption, it&#39;s just a simple <br/>
factor in the family dynamics. Not a big deal or a bad thing.<br/>
I think that people who don&#39;t have experience with adoption think of it as <br/>
something &quot;less than&quot; or a second choice. Adoption is a good thing! It is a <br/>
blessing for many people, both adults and children alike.<br/>
I have always been told that I was extra special because I was adopted. One <br/>
woman loved me so much she put aside her own feelings to offer me a better <br/>
life, another woman loved me so much that she looked for me and found me, <br/>
giving me that better life.<br/>
My mother is my mother, the fact that her DNA is not the basis of my DNA is a <br/>
technicality.<br/>
Now, that said, I do wish that the laws were different in MD when I was born <br/>
as I have no knowledge of my biological family medical  history which worries <br/>
me.<br/>
My husband was adopted too, we always make jokes about being brother and <br/>
sister.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  But biological children who are repeatedly told by strangers how<br/>
much they don&#39;t look like one or more parents may develop a suspicion<br/>
that they are adopted and that no one has been straight with them.  That<br/>
was the situation that I thought called for reassurance.<br/>

comments, why not just respond with a polite &quot;Does that bother you? [that <br/>
they don&#39;t look like me]<br/>
I also think that many children at some point wonder if they aren&#39;t adopted. <br/>
I think that many of us here on the list have thought at least once in our <br/>
lives, &quot;These people are nuts, I must be adopted&quot; LOL<br/>
As to it being a &quot;reassurance&quot; that they aren&#39;t adopted, there is an <br/>
implication that adoption is bad.<br/>

Static medical history from the time you were born wouldn&#39;t be all that much <br/>
help to you anyway. Current medical history would be much better. Your bio <br/>
parents were probably both still young at the time of your birth, and *their* <br/>
parents relatively young, as well. Things have changed thirty odd years down <br/>
the road.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope! Bio dad was Korean war vet, lost a leg.<br/>
Bio mom was in her early thirties, conceived while seperated from husband <br/>
(not bio-dad) who upon reconciling, refused to raise the child of that union. <br/>
Can&#39;t say I blame him. She had 5 other children and worked as a secretary. <br/>
Rather difficult to raise 6 children on that kind of salary. The reason that <br/>
the health has me wondering is because it is believed that she passed away <br/>
from cancer (unknown type) about 2 years ago. <br/>
I should probably just start with a check-up.<br/>
