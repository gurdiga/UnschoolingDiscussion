<br/>
It&#39;s not about honesty.  We&#39;re not there to see you or to hear you grumbling <br/>
instead of washing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I learned all this chore-choice thing from people at www.unschooling.com and <br/>
some of them explained it better.   But knowing you could choose not to do <br/>
dishes does make it a choice.  You could use paper plates.  You could try to make <br/>
one of the kids do it (and that will involve negative side issues you might <br/>
want to choose to avoid).<br/>
<br/>
You could buy new dishes at a garage sale and throw your old ones away if <br/>
you&#39;re just tired of looking at them.  That might make doing dishes more fun.<br/>
<br/>
I never had a dishwasher in my whole life until I was pregnant with Marty.  <br/>
For my birthday I got a birthday card from my husband that said I could have <br/>
the major appliance of my choice.  I didn&#39;t have a microwave either.  I chose a <br/>
dishwasher.  Knowing I had considered a microwave, Keith&#39;s parents gave us one <br/>
for Christmas, and then Marty was born January 14.  <br/>
<br/>
So until 15 years ago,  I had washed dishes by hand my whole life. <br/>
<br/>
I made games with them, and patterns, and used the time to think or to sing <br/>
songs I was trying to learn.<br/>
<br/>
We live where dishes are best left to dry themselves, so I rarely dried and <br/>
put them away.  Putting them away when they were dry was another set of games <br/>
and contests with myself.  Sorting silverware in my hand, twirling them into <br/>
the right order without putting them down or changing hands.  Stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I got new &quot;silverware&quot; (stainless), service for 12.  VERY very <br/>
cool, and that&#39;s making doing dishes fun again.  I washed them all by hand and <br/>
admired them all.  I totally rearranged the drawer and sorted what to give away <br/>
and what to keep.  It was FUN.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Or <br/>
can&#39;t it be OK for me to be less-than-joyful about some things with the full <br/>
knowledge that I chose to, for instance, eat, and will probably be a little <br/>
happier with a cleaner sink? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re all choices whether you&#39;re joyful about them or not.  They&#39;re not <br/>
have-tos.  You know where the door is.  You could throw the dishes out the window <br/>
and walk out the door, but you have chosen to hang out and re-use those <br/>
dishes.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But it&#39;s not <br/>
going to make me joyful in the short-term while I&#39;m doing the darn things. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What could make you more joyful?  Are they &quot;the darn things&quot;?  Why?<br/>
I like my dishes.  Even the Rubbermaid plastic plates I collect from <br/>
thriftstores because they stack so nicely and they&#39;re easy to use and wash.  Sometimes <br/>
we use &quot;the real plates,&quot; but they&#39;re heavy and dangerous.  I was in an <br/>
emergency room with a friend who had been mugged once.  A woman was in next to us <br/>
who dropped a dinner plate on her foot and it had broken and cut her badly.  So <br/>
95 cent used plastic it is.  A choice based on factors and so on.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe dishes make other people joyful. Maybe that&#39;s why they think I shou<br/>
ld <br/>
be joyful while doing dishes. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The other way around.  They remember what it was like not to be joyful, and <br/>
they&#39;re willing to tell you how they slightly tweaked their thinking to keep <br/>
the same old dishes from being those darned things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-OK then -- maybe some people need help in being more joyful and some of us <br/>
don&#39;t and are happy finding joy where we do but not every second of the day <br/>
and <br/>
this advice is for others on the list and doesn&#39;t apply to me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ideas being hung out for the taking are just for whoever wants to take them <br/>
and try them on.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are happy being unhappy.  Some people foster their unhappiness.  <br/>
Some people cut their arms with razor blades at school and dye their hair <br/>
black and paint their nails black and stew in the suckitude of the world.   I&#39;ve <br/>
never known any unschoolers to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are happy almost all the time.  I think it&#39;s worth looking at.<br/>
<br/>
Some might choose to be halfway happy, but why?   Attachment to martyrdom?  <br/>
&quot;Acceptance&quot; that the world&#39;s not all that cool?<br/>
<br/>
My world&#39;s pretty cool.  It has become gradually cooler since I had kids and <br/>
have tried to figure out how to make THEIR worlds cooler.  Mine got the side <br/>
benefit of what I learned about how to help keep them happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a big wide area between &quot;not resentful&quot; and &quot;outright joyful.&quot;<br/>
You and me, Nance, are probably down there having to work at being one <br/>
step away from the resentful edge.<br/>
<br/>
When I talk to math anxious parents I try to get them to at LEAST adopt <br/>
a &quot;do no harm&quot; attitude, which means they do have to keep their own <br/>
anxieties in check enough to think clearly about what they want to pass <br/>
on to their kids.  What I wish for them is joy, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that for a lot of parents that asking them to be &quot;joyful&quot; <br/>
about math is asking them to take too big a first step JUST like asking <br/>
me to be actually outright joyful about doing dishes is just <br/>
inconceivable to me.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m working on simply doing it. Going through the motions. Faking <br/>
the attitude that I really &quot;don&#39;t mind&quot; doing the housework. I&#39;m also <br/>
doing things to make it have at least some value beyond just the <br/>
cleaner house (which is nice - but has never been a big enough payoff <br/>
for me, in the past). I started listening to audible books while doing <br/>
housework and that has made it much less onerous and easier for me to <br/>
take one little tiny step out of the &quot;I HATE this&quot; resentment corner <br/>
where I had been hanging out for years &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it for years. But I recently made this <br/>
connection between what I&#39;m promoting all the time to math-hating <br/>
parents (joyful math) and this idea of doing housework joyfully and <br/>
suddenly it hit me that the advice WAS for me.<br/>

<br/>
Ah, dishes. <br/>
<br/>
I lived in a little cabin in Alaska that had no plumbing.  I didn&#39;t have<br/>
a well either so our water came from a community well a few miles away.  <br/>
Dishes involved heating water on the wood stove for washing and rinsing. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, when I turn on a water faucet it seems like magic the hot<br/>
water is right there, just like that. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m easily impressed. <br/>
<br/>
I have a window above my kitchen sink where I hung the wind chime Dylan<br/>
gave me for mothers day a few years ago.   I have a bird feeder on the<br/>
garden fence post I can see when I&#39;m standing at the sink and in the<br/>
summer, my little herb garden grows and blooms there.  I have a tall and<br/>
twirly copper sprinkler there looks like a cat jumping for a bird.  I<br/>
have plants in my windowsill.  Some of Dylan&#39;s rocks are there, shiny<br/>
obsidian and smoky quartz.  <br/>
<br/>
I turn on Asian Groove or Keb Mo&#39; or someone and pour myself a little<br/>
wine.  I light a candle.  I like the way the hot water feels and I like<br/>
the way the dish soap smells.  I like all the colors in the bubbles.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad gave me my dishes, Franciscan Ware, and I still think they&#39;re so<br/>
pretty - especially the cups and saucers.  When I wash them I think about<br/>
the day my dad and I saw them at the store and how he surprised me with<br/>
them later for my birthday.   Before I had those I collected mismatched<br/>
stoneware and have all kinds of assorted bowls and plates and mugs and<br/>
whatnots.  When I wash my pitcher I think about when I found it at the<br/>
Renaissance fair in Anchorage twenty years ago and who I was with and<br/>
what they might be doing now.  I have a few pieces of Polish pottery that<br/>
are so beautiful I don&#39;t know how I lived before I had them. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I love the way glass and ceramic dries almost instantly if you&#39;ve rinsed<br/>
it in really hot water.  <br/>
<br/>
I get all that, plus I get to do something nice and useful for my<br/>
family.&lt;g&gt;  I put the herb garden just there on purpose, and the bird<br/>
feeder, the pretty sprinkler, the wind chimes, the kitchen plants.  I buy<br/>
little candles on sale when I find the kind I like.  I planned and saved<br/>
for a cd player for my kitchen .  I&#39;m not just doing dishes I&#39;m<br/>
reflecting on the good things in my life.   <br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was little if he was cranky and nothing seemed to help I would<br/>
make a bath for him and he&#39;d come out after awhile feeling happy and<br/>
warm.   Dish doing is my attitude adjustment.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a chef. I&#39;ll cook you a 12 course meal. Don&#39;t ask me to do the <br/>
dishes as well. I HAVE TO CHOOSE TO DO IT THOUGH ... heh heh. No, <br/>
really, if you saw how small my kitchen is, you&#39;d probably die of a <br/>
heart attack. I wash while I&#39;m cooking away because I have very limited <br/>
counter & sink space. I do not enjoy in a whistly way like Mark. He <br/>
loves doing dishes in the morning. It&#39;s his way of waking up. It&#39;s like <br/>
a working meditation for him (I sometimes feel he should have been a <br/>
Zen Buddist monk). Am I going to bitch to him about the dishes while <br/>
I&#39;m cooking because someone else has to clean? No. It&#39;s just not <br/>
practical. There is little space for 2 in the kitchen. I&#39;d rather do it <br/>
while cooking. So practicality wins over whining.<br/>
<br/>
Some time ago I was doing the dishes after dinner, a rarity. Mark was <br/>
not around for some reason. The pile was high, he was coming home late, <br/>
so I just dragged my feet to the sink. Then a thought crept in my mind. <br/>
How lucky I am that I have a husband and partner. That we complement <br/>
each other on our neurosae. That we have someone to rely upon. I have <br/>
so many single-mother neighbors here, with 1-2-4 kids to take care of <br/>
and full-time jobs. When we all see each other at the playground, we <br/>
all bitch about the same stuff: schedules, housework, chores. Then <br/>
reality strikes. Not doing the dishes while Mark was not around seems <br/>
just inconsequential. These women have lives much harder and <br/>
complicated than I. What they have to go through actually makes my <br/>
&#39;choice&#39; a privilege.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I am grateful to my single-mom neighbors. My whining <br/>
has diminished exponentially through the years.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I never really thought about why doing dishes doesn&#39;t bother me much. Just<br/>
thought I had a thing for housework. I really enjoy keeping a neat clean<br/>
house and aside from changing sheets, never grumble about any of it. So I<br/>
thought the dish thing was the same. I never had a dish washer in my life up<br/>
until 3 years ago. If I use it 6 times in a year, that&#39;s a lot. But with<br/>
reading your post, I realized what keeps me joyful doing the dishes and when<br/>
it does start to get to me a bit. I find late night washing irritates me<br/>
when something dirty is still in the sink. It&#39;s because the kids aren&#39;t up<br/>
or out and about. When I&#39;m standing at my sink, I have a large open window<br/>
into the playroom. That&#39;s where all the games and most of the toys are as<br/>
well as the tv and playstation. During the day, at least one body is usually<br/>
in there. What better way for me to enjoy dishwashing then to see my<br/>
beautiful offspring enjoying life. Or to see my husband taking out his<br/>
frustrations on playstation. And in the daylight, I open the blinds and have<br/>
a wonderful view of the pool. Cats sitting on the ledge watching lizards and<br/>
birds fly about. Sometimes sitting on the counter watching me and the water<br/>
and sponge move all about. So it&#39;s only late at night, when kids are<br/>
sleeping or playing in their rooms and cats have no lizards to watch and the<br/>
pool is too dark to see that I think crap!!!! dishes again?<br/>

I found apple scented dish detergent, CBC radio and the kids being exiled to the living room make dish washing very joy filled. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020778225">I just discovered how nice it is to wash floors with essential oils <br/>
in the water last week!  I was having company and I smelled something <br/>
funny in the diningroom and couldn&#39;t figure out what it was, so I put <br/>
some cinnamon essential oils in my water and thought maybe I could <br/>
mask the smell.  I got all excited when I started cleaning--I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe how great it smelled!  I got all excited and called <br/>
my daughter into the room to smell my rag.  She liked it too. :)  You <br/>
can smell the scent for hours after you clean.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured out what the smell was.  The boys caught a frog in the yard <br/>
over the summer and put him in a bucket. We feed him every day and <br/>
he&#39;s still living but we don&#39;t change his water very often.   I <br/>
finally realized that when I changed the water the bad smell went <br/>
away. ;)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433798020">Do something you enjoy doing WHILE you&#39;re cleaning.  If you&#39;re a music lover, put on a CD and sing along.  If you like movies, let it play while you clean around it.  If you love talking to your kids, talk to them while you clean.  Whatever it is, figure out a way to incorporate it into the cleaning.  I know it sounds a little...crazy, but it really can help take the &#39;chore&#39; out of cleaning.  <br/>
<br/>
I DO enjoy cleaning (not as much as I used to, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nuther story) so I clean as I&#39;m doing other things all the time.  A lot of times there is no conscious thought behind it.  It&#39;s almost like a relfex for me, lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing on cleaning...try not to compare your house with other people&#39;s clean houses, or especially not to the houses you see on TV commercials.  There&#39;s a good chance the other people&#39;s houses and the one&#39;s on TV are not unschooler&#39;s, and like most everything else, not many things in the &#39;normal&#39; world compare to an unschooling lifestyle.  Maybe the people with the immaculate houses don&#39;t spend much time with their kids.  There may be some that barely know their kids at all.  Some people have all day to clean while their kids are in school.  Some people have cleaning services that do it for them.  The point is, don&#39;t compare your house to one that exists in another dimension.  <br/>
<br/>
A clean house is nice, but it doesn&#39;t need to be at the top of the list of priorities.  We unschoolers get a lot of other &#39;perks&#39; from our lifestyle that most people will never experience.  <br/>

<br/>
  I finally clued into that this fall. I couldn&#39;t figure out why my house looked so good last fall but was no longer manageable for more than a few hours this fall. Then it clicked. My son is a rampaging two year old and unschooling has meant a huge shift in my attidtude to toys. For example, the livingroom was my room last year and any toys were out of site. This year, with so many toys and books and ME excitedly adding to the cache any chance I get (has anyone else noticed this shift of thinking? Toys are no longer clutter but exciting fun) I&#39;ve had to spread toys, crafts, blocks, whatever around the whole house.<br/>
  If it&#39;s a mess, oh well. I know it will get cleaned sooner or later.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; helps.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I use essential oils, water, vinegar and baking soda for all our<br/>
cleaning needs.  We have lemon and grapefruit scented toilets, pine scented<br/>
floors, and sage scented cabinets.<br/>
<br/>
Housework used to be a problem around here until very recently when I took<br/>
the advice of some of the wise women on this list.  With 5 kids and lots of<br/>
activities and running around, the house was NEVER clean, barely liveable.<br/>
I always felt like I was cleaning as fast as I could just to keep our heads<br/>
above the clutter.  We happen to live in a large, ramshackle house so no one<br/>
walks to put anything away.  They just set it on the nearest flat surface. I<br/>
could never get the clutter put away so I could really clean.<br/>
<br/>
I started doing just one room per day.  The first time I went through each<br/>
room, it took the entire day per room.  But since then, I can clean the room<br/>
in about 15 minutes and feel that I have truly accomplished something.  Then<br/>
I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m drowning and &quot;go banshee&quot; on the kids and dh (thanks<br/>
for the description Sandra.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255973057">Since we never really had assigned chores, I&#39;m not sure if there is a period<br/>
of dechoring!!! Funny word. But I do know that even now, we still have<br/>
periods where certain people seem to be doing more than others. But for us,<br/>
that works out well and evens itself all out. Maybe as the kids get older,<br/>
it will even out more too. The youngest are 8, 7 and 3. There were also<br/>
times where it seemed like no one but my husband and I were concerned with<br/>
how the house looked. We just went about cleaning as we always did.<br/>
Sometimes when something got really bad for me, I would just talk to the<br/>
kids about how it was important for me to have something look a certain way.<br/>
I would explain it so they could understand like if something of their&#39;s<br/>
wasn&#39;t the way they always like it to be. They got it and now they really<br/>
understand how taking care of something they see as no big deal will make<br/>
mommy really happy. But they aren&#39;t mind readers and don&#39;t actually *see*<br/>
what I do. Talking about specifics helps as opposed to &quot;the playroom is a<br/>
mess and I can&#39;t stand it anymore and need it cleaned up.&quot; Saying &quot; I would<br/>
really like the floor to be picked up so I can walk without stepping on<br/>
anything and breaking it would be nice.&quot; So I would compromise by just<br/>
having the floor neat and all the stuff on the table or counters or on<br/>
shelves and the kids wouldn&#39;t feel so put out by cleaning up everything. And<br/>
as I say it, I start picking stuff up too. I have always had 1 or 2 kids<br/>
pitch in. I learn to not put my anality (is that a word?) on to my kids.<br/>
They just don&#39;t see and feel the same about neatness like I do. That&#39;s fine<br/>
and just as I give for their way, they give to mine. It will take awhile and<br/>
I feel like it&#39;s very important to not grumble while the wait is on.<br/>
Grumbling will just make them see it&#39;s awful work they won&#39;t even want to do<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Start small with things that are really important to all and go from there.<br/>
It will get better!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16865017">&lt;&lt; How do we make this transition work?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the transition from any controlled environment to an uncontrolled<br/>
one is hard at best....why do you think there is such a high recidivism rate<br/>
at prisons &lt;grin&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
The kids obviously don&#39;t feel yet that you are comfortable with &quot;no&quot; as an<br/>
answer and are enjoying their freedom while it lasts.  We have a goal at our<br/>
house that each of us lives in complete freedom as long as it doesn&#39;t cause<br/>
harm.  Note this is a goal and we don&#39;t always reach it, but we do try.<br/>
<br/>
So when something comes up, like people not cleaning up after themselves, we<br/>
sit down and talk about it.  Not in a &quot;You little snot, I can&#39;t believe you<br/>
expect me to clean up after you.&quot;  But in a gentle, loving &quot;this is how I<br/>
feel when I see messes left around&quot; kind of thing.  We talk about how our<br/>
actions have consequences, not only for ourselves but for others and the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
I think gentle reminders are likely to simply be a part of mothering.  Let&#39;s<br/>
face it.  The kids are simply not as invested in picking up as you are.<br/>
They have other things on their minds.<br/>
<br/>
I also try to treat our home, as &quot;OUR home&quot;, not MY house.  If I were at my<br/>
mom&#39;s and I saw a mess in the living room, I would pick it up just to help<br/>
out my mom.  I try to do the same things for the kids.  I help them where I<br/>
can because I love them and it models helpful behavior to them.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that was absolutely NOT helpful for us during the transition was<br/>
for me to go into the living room where all the kids are doing something and<br/>
say &quot;Would you guys go clean your rooms up?  I can&#39;t even walk in there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What was helpful was to ask a child individually, when they were between<br/>
activities (you know, that pass through the kitchen to see what everybody is<br/>
doing thing that kids do) if that individual child would help me do<br/>
something, asked in a kind, fun, gentle way.  Like &quot;Hey Zach, I was having<br/>
trouble finding a book to read to Danny in y&#39;all&#39;s room last night.  I was<br/>
gonna organize things in there so you can find them easier.  Would you like<br/>
to help me?&quot;  I get the occassional &quot;no&quot; but most of the kids enjoy alone<br/>
time with mom and they know straightening up won&#39;t take but a minute.<br/>
<br/>
 An important note on this I think, is then to take what they want to do<br/>
about helping very serious.  Example:  If Zach wants to put his underwear on<br/>
the bookshelves rather than in a drawer, I respect that and help him do it.<br/>
<br/>
Julie S.---who in real life would be thrilled if Zach showed any interest in<br/>
his underwear at all<br/>

&lt;&lt; How do we make this transition work? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Three months wasn&#39;t enough for unschooling to start working, was it?  I&#39;m <br/>
guessing there&#39;s a &quot;deschooling&quot; kind of time on everything like that.   Three <br/>
months is only one season.  And some kids will change sooner or in different <br/>
ways than others.   But if you don&#39;t go that direction you can never get that <br/>
direction and you&#39;ll spend the rest of your life trying to make people do things <br/>
they don&#39;t want to do.<br/>
<br/>
So if it we somehow could actually know and tell you it was going to take <br/>
five years, would you go back to the old way?<br/>
<br/>
-=-One child was overheard by another mom on the phone to<br/>
say to a friend, &quot;oops, I spilled my smoothie all over<br/>
the counter.  Oh well, someone else will clean it up&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And did you have a serious talk with that child?  It&#39;s one thing not to <br/>
require public chores of people (cleaning up after others, doing their dad&#39;s <br/>
laundry for him) but quite a whole foreign different thing to give a child the <br/>
impression that she&#39;s not responsible for even her own messes.<br/>
<br/>
If it were one of mine I would say that only AFTER she had cleaned other <br/>
people&#39;s messes up sweetly and quietly for a long time do they start to clean up <br/>
after her.   (And I&#39;d say that to moms too.  Some moms have done little to no <br/>
quiet and sweet cleaning.  They&#39;ve done a lot of grumbling and muttering <br/>
cleaning and then they send their family the bill in one way or another.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now, if asked, they will do things, begrudgingly,<br/>
because it has always been expected.  And even though<br/>
they have the option now of saying &quot;no&quot; when asked,<br/>
they usually don&#39;t because it was drilled into them as<br/>
small children that &quot;no&quot; was not an acceptable choice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Given that, three months is like an hour. Probably a happy hour.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;DH doesn&#39;t have faith that this unchoring will work&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Neither do you, it seems, if you&#39;re tapping your foot at three months and <br/>
saying &quot;When is this going to work?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m guessing that somehow in some way you gave your kids a speech and <br/>
said &quot;From now on...&quot; and maybe something you said gave them the idea in some <br/>
carts-before-horses way that if they leave a mess for someone else to clean (even <br/>
if it&#39;s a sudden discrete mess they individually and specifically made) you <br/>
said something I would never have said.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Have I just not given this enough time?  Are they<br/>
still dechoring?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the term &quot;dechoring&quot; or &quot;choring&quot; or &quot;chore.&quot;<br/>
Are you living well together as a group?  Does it involve freedom and choices <br/>
and helping and cooperation?  It&#39;s not something you can do behind your <br/>
husband&#39;s back.   And maybe it&#39;s not something you can do altogether all at once.  <br/>
Maybe more discussions with the kids about what you would like to see happen <br/>
would help.  You could say &quot;If it seems there are other ways to go about this, <br/>
we can do other things, but because your dad doesn&#39;t believe it can work, we <br/>
need to figure out an intermediary phase (or something).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;ve had adult housemates, we&#39;ve asked them to do things.  &quot;Would you <br/>
be willing to make breakfast Saturday when we have company?&quot; or &quot;Could you fix <br/>
that light fixture when you get a chance?&quot; or &quot;Could you change the laundry <br/>
when it&#39;s done?&quot;  But I wouldn&#39;t have &quot;given them chores&quot; and insisted they did <br/>
it all the time.  And I wouldn&#39;t have said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING <br/>
around here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it wasn&#39;t anything you said.  Maybe it&#39;s just their experimentation to <br/>
see if you&#39;ve just gone crazy and will regain your sanity soon and it will all <br/>
be over.  So maybe they have no faith that this will work either, and they&#39;re <br/>
enjoying what they think might just be a lull.<br/>

<br/>
This is really helpful. For a bit over a month I&#39;ve just been cleaning <br/>
up. Not asking for help much - just when it was REALLy obviously <br/>
somebody else&#39;s mess (Roya and Rosie doing collagging on the living <br/>
room floor leaving piles and piles of paper scraps) and even then just <br/>
asking them to do it while I cheerfully am cleaning up something right <br/>
there with them. With the kitchen clean, I&#39;m shopping better - for <br/>
foods they want more. Cooking more, less fast food. With the dining <br/>
room/living room clean, there is room for them to drag out projects to <br/>
do, games to play, etc. Everybody is hanging out more together. I&#39;ve <br/>
been buying scented candles and burning them a lot - house smells nice. <br/>
Everybody is happier. I&#39;m doing more housework, but not a LOT more. It <br/>
is taking a small effort, still, for me to just get myself up to do it <br/>
- not sit around or run out the door with it undone. But the payoff has <br/>
been pretty clear to all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed the kids are unloading the dishwasher and reloading it <br/>
without being asked - every few days. I&#39;m doing it 10 times for anybody <br/>
else doing it 1 time, but still --<br/>
<br/>
I can see they are making an effort and it is because they like the <br/>
more cleaned-up house, not because I&#39;m nagging or &quot;bansheeing&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our house is still a mess. Too much stuff, too disorganized. Kids can&#39;t <br/>
even walk in their rooms - Rosie can&#39;t sleep in her own bed it is so <br/>
piled up with stuff. But just keeping the dishes done and clutter out <br/>
of the main living areas has been a big improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Its only been a month. And the one discouraging part has been that when <br/>
I&#39;m gone for a day they don&#39;t take care of the clutter or dishes and I <br/>
have a pretty big mess to have to deal with when I get home. I&#39;m hoping <br/>
that&#39;ll change, too.<br/>

rinsed. Scraped, of course. Rinsed out pots. (*Not* scrubbed. Just swirled<br/>
water around to get rid of heavy stuff.) I&#39;ve never had a problem. Even with<br/>
old dishwashers. Sometimes a pot won&#39;t come clean and I just leave it there<br/>
for the dishwasher to try again ;-) If a second trip through doesn&#39;t clean<br/>
it or I need the space for new dirty stuff, I&#39;ll scrub it.<br/>

&gt; Three months wasn&#39;t enough for unschooling to start<br/>
&gt; working, was it?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but it was close, I think, for the older children.<br/>
 The youngest has never been schooled at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; guessing there&#39;s a &quot;deschooling&quot; kind of time on<br/>
&gt; everything like that.   Three <br/>
&gt; months is only one season.  And some kids will<br/>
&gt; change sooner or in different <br/>
&gt; ways than others.   But if you don&#39;t go that<br/>
&gt; direction you can never get that <br/>
&gt; direction and you&#39;ll spend the rest of your life<br/>
&gt; trying to make people do things <br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t want to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if it we somehow could actually know and tell you<br/>
&gt; it was going to take <br/>
&gt; five years, would you go back to the old way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, never would.  This is really the way I want to<br/>
see our family moving.  I was pretty much thinking I<br/>
hadn&#39;t given it enough time, but I was also thinking<br/>
that maybe I was going about it the wrong way as well.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if there were suggestions as to how to<br/>
approach the children about helping out without it<br/>
seeming like I was &quot;telling&quot; them they &quot;have to&quot;.  It<br/>
is very hard to not have them interpret any request as<br/>
a &quot;have to&quot;, and understanding that it is my fault<br/>
they think like that, I still want some help around<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
When I said we &quot;dropped assigned chores three months<br/>
ago&quot; I didn&#39;t mean I had just suddenly stopped all<br/>
assigned chores (like letting go of the rope, as<br/>
Sandra mentioned).  Three months ago was really the<br/>
end of the slowly letting go which began last summer. <br/>
My DH still hasn&#39;t completely let go, especially when<br/>
the level of grime reaches beyond his tolerance level;<br/>
then he starts barking a bit.<br/>
<br/>
It just seems like as I eased up, I also took on the<br/>
jobs so that the same level of clean and tidy was<br/>
maintained.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that was deceitful though, to them and to DH.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-One child was overheard by another mom on the<br/>
&gt; phone to<br/>
&gt; say to a friend, &quot;oops, I spilled my smoothie all<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; the counter.  Oh well, someone else will clean it<br/>
&gt; up&quot;.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And did you have a serious talk with that child? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes!  I was NOT pleased at the prospect of cleaning<br/>
dried sticky fruit puree all off the counter.  And the<br/>
child did clean it up quite contritely.  Perhaps there<br/>
was showing off a bit for the friend on the phone, and<br/>
just bad timing for the mom to pick up the extension<br/>
at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (And I&#39;d say that to moms too.  Some<br/>
&gt; moms have done little to no <br/>
&gt; quiet and sweet cleaning.  They&#39;ve done a lot of<br/>
&gt; grumbling and muttering <br/>
&gt; cleaning and then they send their family the bill in<br/>
&gt; one way or another.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OUCH!  That one hits way close to home! LOL!  I am<br/>
sure I have &quot;sent them the bill&quot; many times, whether I<br/>
realized it or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given that, three months is like an hour. Probably a<br/>
&gt; happy hour.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;DH doesn&#39;t have faith that this unchoring will<br/>
&gt; work&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Neither do you, it seems, if you&#39;re tapping your<br/>
&gt; foot at three months and <br/>
&gt; saying &quot;When is this going to work?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is something to consider.  Perhaps I don&#39;t have<br/>
as much confidence as I claim to.  Although I am<br/>
really looking for first signs that it is working,<br/>
rather than a full-blown smoothly running household. <br/>
Upon reflection I do see some things happening, just<br/>
with the oldest, such as the bedroom being picked up<br/>
or personal laundry being done without being asked.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m guessing that somehow in some way you gave<br/>
&gt; your kids a speech and <br/>
&gt; said &quot;From now on...&quot; and maybe something you said<br/>
&gt; gave them the idea in some <br/>
&gt; carts-before-horses way that if they leave a mess<br/>
&gt; for someone else to clean (even <br/>
&gt; if it&#39;s a sudden discrete mess they individually and<br/>
&gt; specifically made) you <br/>
&gt; said something I would never have said.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if it was a speech, but it could have<br/>
been.  I *do* have that tendency, to make<br/>
proclamations and declarations.  <br/>
<br/>
It was way back in the summer, when we decided that<br/>
freedom was desireable.  We had a discussion about how<br/>
it might look to not have assigned chores, and how if<br/>
everyone just cleaned up after themselves and each<br/>
other, we wouldn&#39;t have to have weekly or monthly<br/>
chores.<br/>
<br/>
But it was just one discussion during the summer, and<br/>
perhaps it needs to be revisited to see how well it is<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like the term &quot;dechoring&quot; or &quot;choring&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &quot;chore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For lack of brain power this morning, that is all I<br/>
could come up with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you living well together as a group?  Does it<br/>
&gt; involve freedom and choices <br/>
&gt; and helping and cooperation?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see progress in that direction, but so much further<br/>
from my &quot;ideal&quot; in my head.  Maybe I am thinking we<br/>
will turn into &quot;Surviving the Applewhites&quot; or<br/>
something.  I guess I need to get a real view of *our*<br/>
household and how it will look here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not something you<br/>
&gt; can do behind your <br/>
&gt; husband&#39;s back.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oooh.  I never thought of it as going behind his back,<br/>
but more of trying to keep his stress level down after<br/>
a long days&#39; work.  Perhaps you&#39;re right,<br/>
though...maybe I am being sneaky instead of helpful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And maybe it&#39;s not something you<br/>
&gt; can do altogether all at once.  <br/>
&gt; Maybe more discussions with the kids about what you<br/>
&gt; would like to see happen <br/>
&gt; would help.  You could say &quot;If it seems there are<br/>
&gt; other ways to go about this, <br/>
&gt; we can do other things, but because your dad doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe it can work, we <br/>
&gt; need to figure out an intermediary phase (or<br/>
&gt; something).&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When we&#39;ve had adult housemates, we&#39;ve asked them to<br/>
&gt; do things.  &quot;Would you <br/>
&gt; be willing to make breakfast Saturday when we have<br/>
&gt; company?&quot; or &quot;Could you fix <br/>
&gt; that light fixture when you get a chance?&quot; or &quot;Could<br/>
&gt; you change the laundry <br/>
&gt; when it&#39;s done?&quot;  But I wouldn&#39;t have &quot;given them<br/>
&gt; chores&quot; and insisted they did <br/>
&gt; it all the time.  And I wouldn&#39;t have said, &quot;You<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING <br/>
&gt; around here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I expected them to be so happy about not<br/>
having assigned chores that had to be done whether<br/>
they had a free moment or not that they would gladly<br/>
just pitch in wherever help was needed, which i see<br/>
now is unrealistic.  They just don&#39;t &quot;see&quot; what needs<br/>
doing unless I point it out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe it wasn&#39;t anything you said.  Maybe it&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; their experimentation to <br/>
&gt; see if you&#39;ve just gone crazy and will regain your<br/>
&gt; sanity soon and it will all <br/>
&gt; be over.  So maybe they have no faith that this will<br/>
&gt; work either, and they&#39;re <br/>
&gt; enjoying what they think might just be a lull.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m really enjoying being the cool mom and the fun<br/>
mom, and being free...really free...to let go of<br/>
self-imposed rules and regulations.  The kids&#39; friends<br/>
think my kids have the perfect life, and can&#39;t<br/>
understand why their own parents don&#39;t relax even a<br/>
little bit.  <br/>
<br/>
I think my kids are a bit stunned too.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned during the dishes discussion how she<br/>
collects beautiful plates, not necessarily matched<br/>
sets.  I was the one stunned.  I couldn&#39;t believe I<br/>
had always thought dishes should match.  What FUN!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, that empowerment thing is snowballing, though,<br/>
and rolling down the hill faster and faster, sucking<br/>
up different areas of my life.  The brilliant hues are<br/>
incredible!  I don&#39;t want the kids and DH to get left<br/>
behind, but how the heck do ya control it!? LOL!<br/>

<br/>
Once in a while I express my enthusiasm to one of them.<br/>
I&#39;ll say &quot;I am SO GLAD we are able to get along so well even though we have <br/>
teens,&quot; or &quot;I am really happy with the way that [whatever] went.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It  has helped immensely each time my husband has reason to be around other <br/>
kids our kids&#39; ages.  When they were little he would sometimes say he thought <br/>
maybe they should be doing this or that better or quicker or that they seemed <br/>
irresponsible, and I would say &quot;Compared to WHAT!?&quot; and he was just comparing <br/>
them to his perception of what he thought his mom&#39;s fantasy idea was, or some <br/>
convoluted unreal thing.  So I made it a point to try to get him where he could <br/>
see other kids, or get other kids to our house and once he saw his own kids <br/>
in the company of others their age, he was more impressed with them and he <br/>
backed way off.<br/>
<br/>
Now I can tell quite often how proud and impressed he is with them himself <br/>
without my coaching.   They&#39;re not the kind of kids it&#39;s worth going on a talk <br/>
show to brag up.  They&#39;re not curing cancer or building computers or selling <br/>
paintings or anything.  But they made solid eye contact with anyone, and they <br/>
think of something helpful and clever to do or say in appropriate situations.   <br/>
