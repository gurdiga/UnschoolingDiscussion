<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365589195">After reading the posts on this thread, I wanted to offer a couple of <br/>
experiences for consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with a nutrition conscious mother and was raised vegetarian <br/>
for 10 years. I went ten years without eating any sugar, too. My mother <br/>
never required us to eat her way. She simply shared information she <br/>
found with me. I had asthma and so did my brother. We both stopped <br/>
having asthma problems when she changed our eating habits in the home. <br/>
I felt different eating correctly so I took her values to heart.<br/>
<br/>
If I went to the ice cream shop with a friend, I got a banana. My <br/>
friends thought I was weird.<br/>
<br/>
I believed that eating right would ensure good health and was morally <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
My parents split up at the end of high school. My brother, sister and I <br/>
all &quot;fell off the nutrition wagon&quot; at that point. I continued to not <br/>
eat meat for four more years, but I did stop worrying about <br/>
preservatives and additives in everything and ate some sugar. My sibs <br/>
started smoking, eating junk food, drinking and my brother&#39;s asthma <br/>
returned full force.<br/>
<br/>
A broken home had more to do with our eating habits than all those <br/>
years of nutritional teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, I have resisted that level of nutrition consciousness. <br/>
I&#39;ve known too many nutritional anorexics, and too many nutty adults <br/>
who live life as though food were the central issue for living. And <br/>
amazingly, so often the nutrition conscious are the ones who talk about <br/>
all their health issues while others at McDonald&#39;s seem blissfully <br/>
unaware...<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t afford the organic lifestyle. So I do the best I can with the <br/>
basics. And you know what? We&#39;re healthy. We eat supermarket foods and <br/>
I cook real stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My kids eat more junk than I did growing up, but they don&#39;t have asthma <br/>
either. And they don&#39;t prefer junk to my cooking.<br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t want to reproduce in my family from growing up was the <br/>
idea that there is a standard or an ideal that ensures health and <br/>
wholeness. My family had idealized eating.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, food is just a normal part of our lives and a tasty one when I <br/>
take the time to make food we love. We talk about nutrition the same <br/>
way we talk about the books we read or the purchases we want to make. <br/>
It&#39;s not enshrined as the key to happiness and health.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as advertising goes... my kids watch cartoons solid for <br/>
three hours every Saturday. I can&#39;t think of the last time they asked <br/>
me to buy anything based on advertising. I know it probably happens in <br/>
some homes, but they just don&#39;t feel deprived...<br/>
<br/>
My two cents,<br/>
