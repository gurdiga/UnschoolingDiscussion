<br/>
 I was a teacher for three years in private schools, and Luz was a certified<br/>
public school teacher with the usual content-free Masters degree. Both of us<br/>
know it is a &quot;frustrating system&quot; and that the only thing keeping it going<br/>
is money -- not &quot;doing it for the children.&quot; Unschooling is purely &quot;for the<br/>
children,&quot; it doesn&#39;t pay a dime.<br/>
<br/>
(shall we compare our dedication to the children? My total pay for all three<br/>
years full time teaching was: first year 0, second year $2k, third year $3k<br/>
= total $5k)<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I both feel well qualified to assess the teaching trade and, like<br/>
Frank Smith, we feel free to &quot;malign&quot; bad teaching and unwanted teaching and<br/>
unnecessary teaching, when we encounter them, because of the damage they do.<br/>
We also would applaud good teaching, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what Pam said about Frank Smith:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He said he was against the damage schools do but that<br/>
&gt;homeschooling parents could do damage too and maybe it would be even worse<br/>
&gt;because homeschooled kids wouldn&#39;t have other kids to complain to.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I believe he is saying is that it&#39;s the &quot;schooling&quot; that is damaging,<br/>
whether it&#39;s done in schools or at home. I take that as an endorsement of<br/>
unschooling -- the absence of schooling. Smith&#39;s other objection seems to be<br/>
that homeschooled kids sometimes don&#39;t have enough friends, so I repeat my<br/>
suggestion that parents have an obligation to help their children find<br/>
friends, if only to complain to.  :^)<br/>
<br/>
Over two thousand years ago, Socrates told us that if someone started<br/>
charging money for teaching the youth things that are well known to<br/>
virtually every adult in the society, it would be fraud. Today, that fraud<br/>
is well established in our country. Schooling has been taken over and<br/>
adulterated by government for political purposes and enforced by laws of<br/>
compulsion. <br/>

You said the school system was seamless and ALL is just done for the money <br/>
and never for the kids.   If you had never made such extreme statements <br/>
people wouldn&#39;t be unhappy with the posts.  <br/>
<br/>
If you ever worked for nothing, you can&#39;t say all OTHER teachers taught for <br/>
money, not for the good of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My first year&#39;s salary was $6,800 but that was before the big inflation, and <br/>
before salaries went to starting at $22,000 and suchlike.  Texas paid a lot <br/>
(meaning over $24,000 for starting) before other places in the southwest did, <br/>
it seemed.  Still, if people don&#39;t care anything about kids they usually can <br/>
find a MUCH easier job and one that pays more, working in some state office <br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith spoke eloquently, and he was talking about how people learn and <br/>
about the ease and joy with which interesting things are learned.  There was <br/>
a contrast implied and in the background, but it wasn&#39;t an overtly <br/>
school-bashing talk at all.  It dealt with interests and curiosity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Frank Smith is not writing to a list full of unschoolers. His audience is<br/>
people involved in schooling. He&#39;s trying to convince teachers and those<br/>
concerned about changing schools -- *not* parents considering homeschooling<br/>
-- that schooling methods based on drill and kill and testing are flawed and<br/>
harmful.<br/>
<br/>
(And I wouldn&#39;t characterize Frank Smith&#39;s presentation in his Book of<br/>
Learning and Forgetting (I didn&#39;t even know the other existed) as maligning<br/>
teaching but as cogent argument against rote learning. He respects the fact<br/>
that his audience is concerned and cares about children and teaching and<br/>
schools.)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your purpose in maligning schools *here* to *this* audience of<br/>
unschoolers and those wanting to move towards unschooling? How is your<br/>
purpose compatible with the list&#39;s description at Yahoo?<br/>
<br/>
People do share their *personal* experiences with school. It&#39;s part of the<br/>
process of letting go. They&#39;ll get sympathy and support and the sharing of<br/>
similar personal experiences. It&#39;s the first step for some. (Some skip right<br/>
over it.)<br/>
<br/>
One of the purposes of this list -- maybe the primary purpose -- is to help<br/>
people find the answer to &quot;So, where do I go from here?&quot; What is your<br/>
purpose in repeatedly directing the spotlight back to that first step and<br/>
back behind where people came from? How is it helping people move forward?<br/>
<br/>
Your reponses, lack of responses to many direct questions, and behavior seem<br/>
to indicate that you don&#39;t understand the purpose of this list. Considering<br/>
your writing on unschooling I find that incredibly difficult to believe so<br/>
the next logical conclusion is that you don&#39;t *respect* the purpose of this<br/>
list. That you think it should serve some other purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Why? Explain it to me. Explain *something* to me. *Don&#39;t* tell me why you<br/>
think schools need maligned. I get it. (About a 100 posts ago. I am equally<br/>
not dumb.) Tell me why you think *this* audience needs to focus so heavily<br/>
on schools. Tell me how it helps someone move onward to something completely<br/>
new.<br/>
