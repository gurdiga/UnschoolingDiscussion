<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959552985">I was asked a question by a new unschooler with another connection to me, and here&#39;s my last response:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
** There&#39;s a group of moms [in that part of the world] who do a kind of splinter sect (as it were... &quot;sect&quot; is a bad word for it...) of unschooling, and they use the terms &quot;consensual&quot; a lot, and &quot;autonomy.&quot; I bet their kids are fine, but the terms are problematical for the way I (and many who hang out with me) discuss it. So it&#39;s a philosophical difference. If you meet up with that group, please consider looking further afield for other information too, because I think part of what they&#39;re doing is defending some of the parenting practices that I have seen cause unschooling to fail in other families.<br/>
<br/>
** Here&#39;s a piece of humor for you to consider. As with much humor, it&#39;s also dead-on for real.<br/>

<br/>
** One phrase from that page is &quot;Neglect disguised as freedom&quot; and kind of in response to that occasional condition, that group. . .seems (to me, sometimes) to practice &quot;Control disguised as consent.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
For people on this list who are new to those ideas, another link is <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>
<br/>
I think finding that balance is probably the hardest thing.  It&#39;s easy to make an extreme charicature of &quot;being an unschooler&quot; rather than finding a way to live unschooling.   Someone recently assured us she was &quot;doing it,&quot; but having someone else say &quot;that&#39;s it, you&#39;re balanced on that bicycle&quot; is worthless if the bicycle falls over.  There&#39;s doing, and there&#39;s being, and there&#39;s &quot;it,&quot; and the reason this list exists and thrives is that those ideas (doing, being, &quot;it&quot;) live in the realm of philosophy, of the examination of ideas, of the weeding out of error and fallacy.<br/>
<br/>
Half of me says &quot;bummer&quot; and half of me says &quot;cool!&quot; and so at the balance point of those two, we continue to discuss unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213183630">I think the balance point between neglect and control is the parent(s)<br/>
seeing more choice for themselves. And then extending that knowledge and<br/>
practice for their children is how to avoid the neglect/control extremes<br/>
when unschooling. Stated broadly.<br/>
<br/>
More specifically, looking closely at how choice and decision-making work<br/>
can go a long way toward greater and greater clarity. There&#39;s always more! I<br/>
learn more everyday about that.It is amazing to me the range of choice one<br/>
may have and not even realize it!<br/>
<br/>
I would even go so far as to say that for me, the above is central to<br/>
getting &quot;it.&quot; And from what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s central for many others too.<br/>
