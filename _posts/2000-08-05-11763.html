<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415604138">&lt;&lt; I appreciate your persective and I reread the post, and it still seems to <br/>
have quite an angry tone.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Meschell:<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of re-reading my post you could actually ask me directly what <br/>
my feelings were.  (not said in an angry way)  I&#39;m not sure how you get angry <br/>
tone when I actually wrote the words &quot;sarcastic tone&quot;.  Maybe being sarcastic <br/>
is a British thing that some Americans really don&#39;t understand.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are comfortable living with someone who you give control to over you <br/>
life then there&#39;s really no need to be defensive is there?  I absolutely <br/>
believe there is a power greater than myself and my belief in God or whatever <br/>
I chose to call that &quot;thing&quot; has nothing to do with the relationship between <br/>
a husband and a wife. IMHO<br/>
<br/>
I think in this country (being the USA) it&#39;s called Freedom of Speech and <br/>
it&#39;s part of the Constitution and I was exercising my right. Of course this <br/>
is the Internet governed by other rules and so they may not apply.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to apologize for my belief system, as I&#39;m sure you would not <br/>
apologize for your religious beliefs.  I know what annoys me about father&#39;s <br/>
who want control and it&#39;s up to others to take a look at themselves if it <br/>
bothers them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I get this in digest form now and I see from the digest I&#39;ve received <br/>
there are lots of &quot;Father&#39;s who want control&quot; answers so I&#39;ll go and see if <br/>
someone else has taken offense and is defensive about what I say.  In <br/>
psychology being defensive is all about something going on inside of a person <br/>
that strikes a nerve and it brings up things to think about.<br/>
