<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994369904">I just saw an old neighbor lady whos child was the same age as mine.<br/>
They moved a few years back.<br/>
I remembered that she told me how her son Johnny learned the<br/>
alpahbet. <br/>
She tied him in a chair until he learned it. <br/>
She said there was no excuse a child couldn&#39;t learn.<br/>

A chilling memory to say the least.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-667654715">Isn&#39;t that the true. We have some &#39;friends&#39; (or perhaps I should say<br/>
acquaintances) who pride themselves on how strict they are as parents.<br/>
We know them through church and they really don&#39;t have any friends. It&#39;s<br/>
easy to see why because they&#39;re quite obnoxious. Somehow they&#39;ve decided<br/>
we&#39;re their friends though. My husband is pretty tolerant and<br/>
non-judgmental towards people, and so I think that is one of the ways<br/>
they&#39;ve wormed their way into our lives. We had them over for dinner<br/>
once and all the kids were eating at the kitchen table while the adults<br/>
took their plates and sat in the living room. The mother went back into<br/>
the kitchen after a while and bopped their kids on the head&#39;s for no<br/>
reason at all and then sat there and proceeded to give it to them until<br/>
they cleaned their plates totally. My daughter (who is almost 5) was<br/>
really shocked at how this woman was acting towards these children. She<br/>
has a real keen sense of fairness and of how people should be treated. I<br/>
could see her wheels just turning while this woman was basically on the<br/>
war path with their kids. The adults had dished up the kids food and my<br/>
daughter said, &quot;In our house we don&#39;t have to eat it all if we&#39;re full.&quot;<br/>
The woman was quite taken back and basically told my daughter she ought<br/>
to use good manners. My daughter retorted, &quot;If you&#39;re the one who gave<br/>
them too much food why should they have to eat more?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I could hear this going on in the kitchen and purposely didn&#39;t go in.<br/>
When the woman came back into the living room she said to me, &quot;Your<br/>
daughter took exception to me making my children eat all the food on<br/>
their plates.&quot; I just smiled and said, &quot;She sure knows how to bring up a<br/>
good argument, doesn&#39;t she?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That was about the end of the conversation...and the dinner was a rather<br/>
short one too (thank goodness). I was happy to see my daughter isn&#39;t<br/>
afraid to talk to someone like that about such ridiculous behavior. She<br/>
wasn&#39;t rude, but quite matter of fact in her observance that this woman<br/>
was being ridiculous. I loved it.<br/>
 <br/>
I watch those kids and feel really sad for them. They&#39;re not bad kids -<br/>
but they sure have a tight rein on them. One day though I know it will<br/>
backfire on those parents. You can&#39;t hold a child down so tight for so<br/>
long and treat them so disrespectfully without it coming back to bite<br/>
you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548992655">I&#39;m so glad you mentioned that because I was just thinking about that today.<br/>
<br/>
What *is* wrong with being both a parent and a friend?  What is *that* all about!?<br/>
<br/>
WHY did I ever think that was right?<br/>
<br/>
And, I agree totally about the commercials.  I&#39;ll be darned if I&#39;m going to invade my kids&#39; privacy like that.  I don&#39;t need to.  They tell me all kinds of stuff that most parents would find shocking.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so sorry for kids today.  This society is so anti-kid its like a crime to be under 18.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My Mom made us sit at the table until we ate everything. If bedtime came we <br/>
went to bed and got up to the same food for breakfast.  That was part of what <br/>
started us down our path.  My DH and I discussed all those issues before we <br/>
had children and we decided, he grew up under similar circumstances, that we <br/>
would never do that to our children they would have the choice about what, <br/>
when, where and how much food to eat.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when my oldest was about 6 months old and we started to introduce <br/>
foods into his diet, he clamped his mouth shut after the first spoonful and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t open it.  That was the first and last time we spoon fed him.  LOL.  <br/>
Same thing happened with my youngest.  After that they fed themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
My DH&#39;s brother and brother&#39;s wife have a young one.  We went to visit and it <br/>
was so funny to watch them feed that baby.  Shovel it in and fast.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think he even had time to taste the food, we all sat and watched in <br/>
amazement.  They were always in a hurry but that was incredible.  They are of <br/>
the &quot;clean your plate&quot; club.<br/>

Aaahaaa!<br/>

I always thought I was *on the fringe* because I never spoon fed my <br/>
kids.  When they showed an interest in food, demonstrating by trying <br/>
to snatch food off my plate or out of my mouth &lt;g&gt;, I would give them <br/>
soft bits of food to pick up and eat on their own.  Gradually, they <br/>
learned to use a spoon for carrying food to their mouth...after <br/>
learning that the spoon wasn&#39;t a comfortable fit in their ear or <br/>
their nostril.<br/>
<br/>
Getting together with other moms was often a bewildering experience <br/>
for me; what I thought was normal and natural was *different* in <br/>
their eyes.<br/>

I&#39;ve had lots of problems with Tara but chalk it up to divorce, how <br/>

I&#39;ve been fairly even with how I&#39;ve treated her even though we <br/>

sometimes I worry that they too will tell me things that they will <br/>

<br/>
I think the definition of &quot;problems&quot; would be a factor.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are still really open with me.  <br/>
<br/>
In a family that would be really appalled if a boy had ever peeked at a dirty <br/>
magazine or if a kid went to a concert and took a toke of a passing pipe, <br/>
those would be huge problems.  For me, they wouldn&#39;t be huge problems.  And <br/>
because of that, my kids still talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
I always know where they are or who they&#39;re with (if not both, or sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s once removed--I call the friend who DOES know).  I&#39;ve never been unable <br/>
to find them.  Kirby never misses work or karate.  Marty is sweet and <br/>
helpful.  They&#39;re 16 and 14.  <br/>
<br/>
I think because we&#39;ve never had punishments they&#39;ve never had the motivation <br/>
to lie, because there&#39;s not a line they can&#39;t cross.  Questions and concerns <br/>
are handled with discussion, and I don&#39;t &#39;discuss&#39; them to death.<br/>

<br/>
Yes indeed and ultimately that mom is setting her son up for the real<br/>
probability of abuse throughout his life. This child may be learning not to<br/>
trust his own instincts about *body boundaries* (which I believe is a<br/>
natural part of development). How will he know what to say &quot;NO&quot; to?<br/>
If his natural instinct is being compromised someone at some point is going<br/>
to have to teach him what didn&#39;t develop. All too often, especially with<br/>
people with disabilities, it&#39;s our State or Federal penal systems. This kind<br/>
of thing is so troubling to me.<br/>

independent and sometimes think they are way more capable than they <br/>
really are. They often have come to highly value eccentricity and <br/>
sometimes they kind of force it or go awfully far with it. They are <br/>
very very tolerant and accepting - sometimes this translates into <br/>
gullible and easy to take advantage of. They tend to be very idealistic <br/>
and sometimes impractical.<br/>
<br/>
All of these traits are also pretty wonderful, too, and they tend to be <br/>
incredibly caring (mixed in with some normal levels of <br/>
self-centeredness) and kind and  self-examining and deep-thinking <br/>
people. I enjoy them a LOT.<br/>

admit that it can be disconcerting.<br/>

They are not immune to trying out drugs, alcohol, sex, fast driving, <br/>

they make pretty seriously and they talk about it and analyze the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720517539"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My Mom made us sit at the table until we ate everything. If bedtime<br/>
 </span></blockquote>came we <br/>
went to bed and got up to the same food for breakfast.&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
My parents did this too.  And my favorite rule - you have to eat seconds<br/>
at every meal whether you want them or not.  Why?  I never could figure<br/>
that out.  I&#39;d say I was happy with one serving and they&#39;d say, &quot;You<br/>
have to have seconds.  It&#39;s *dinner*.&quot;  Like somehow that makes sense.<br/>
And on the weekends they&#39;d give us each 12 pancakes for breakfast and<br/>
load us in the car to drive an hour to Pittsburgh to walk around the<br/>
mall.  After the 12 pancakes my stomach would feel like a rock and then<br/>
on the car ride I&#39;d start feeling carsick, which lasted all day while I<br/>
was supposed to be thankful that I got to walk around a mall.  Then I<br/>
was supposed to eat seconds at the next meal.  To this day, just the<br/>
thought of pancakes hurts my stomach.<br/>
 <br/>
My brother has a weight problem.  I have a weight problem.  So do my<br/>
parents.  I literally don&#39;t know when I&#39;ve eaten too much.  If there&#39;s<br/>
still food, I keep eating.  I&#39;ve been known to keep eating until I have<br/>
to literally go lie down, I was so stuffed.  But I didn&#39;t realize from<br/>
the feeling in my stomach I was too full.  I usually don&#39;t realize until<br/>
I&#39;m lightheaded.<br/>
 <br/>
So, of course, I&#39;ve decided my kids can eat what they want, when they<br/>
want, and how much they want.  Which my parents think is a ridiculous<br/>
way to raise children.  It means I buy &quot;special&quot; foods that my kids like<br/>
so they don&#39;t have to eat meals my husband and I like that they don&#39;t.<br/>
I don&#39;t see what&#39;s ridiculous about letting a kid say he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
chili or chicken wings.  When my father once tried to force (cajole) him<br/>
to eat something spicy, I said, &quot;That can give children acid burns.&quot;<br/>
That shut him up fast, and he spent the rest of the meal pondering and<br/>
muttering, wondering if it was true.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not,<br/>
but if it feels to the kid like his mouth is on fire, he shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to eat it.  Geez.<br/>
 <br/>
I could really write a book, but I&#39;ll stop now.  :-)<br/>

dieting or eating constantly to never experience hunger. I am currently <br/>

 It&#39;s not a new concept, but I gave it a new term: Undieting. I am even <br/>
trying to get a new email list going, and here is the description(LOL at the <br/>
Keywords, inspired by unschooling) <br/>
<br/>
&quot;This page is for learning how to reject the diet mentality. Undieting <br/>
implies no longer being a slave to diets,   the diet industry, and anything <br/>
that has a disclaimer &quot;results not typical&quot; after showing how thin and <br/>
beautiful you can be with their product or plan. This list focuses on eating <br/>
by biological hunger and satiety cues, not by someone else telling you how <br/>
control the food because you can&#39;t be trusted. The power to eat like a <br/>
&quot;normal person&quot; is within you. We will unlock your potential to become a free <br/>
eater by exploring the many methods of conquering compulsive overeating. <br/>
KEYWORDS: undieting, undiet, natural eating, hunger-led eating &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think UN is my favorite word (or prefix anyway). I participate in a <br/>
tightwad aol community and my tag line is &quot;unschooling, undebting, <br/>
undieting&quot;. Undebting because I stopped running up credit cards and have <br/>
finally paid them all off, debt free except for mortgage and used Volvo loan. <br/>

the parents don&#39;t know about I think it is that the parents trust the kids to <br/>
make decisions for themselves, if the parents know about it or not.  And I <br/>
think everyone, parent or child, makes good and not so good choices.  And <br/>
probably a lot more to be said on this subject but I just got up and am a <br/>
little foggy right now.  LOL<br/>

watch my responses to my kids feelings, I always thought it was my job to <br/>
analyze and make suggestions and whatnot. How much do I hate it when my hubby <br/>
does that to me, and minimizes my feelings? DUH. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705519779"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So, of course, I&#39;ve decided my kids can eat what they want, when they<br/>
&gt; want, and how much they want.  Which my parents think is a ridiculous<br/>
&gt; way to raise children.  It means I buy &quot;special&quot; foods that my kids like<br/>
&gt; so they don&#39;t have to eat meals my husband and I like that they don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had never heard of forcing seconds, why not just put more on the first <br/>
serving?  My parents were a product of their time too.  We were forced to eat <br/>
vegetables, limited sugars, constantly on a diet and we all have weight <br/>
problems.  My mother weighed exactly 104 pounds every day, and somehow I <br/>
remember knowing this at the age of 5!  I told my kindergarden teacher.<br/>
<br/>
So, you&#39;d think they would be more argumentative over how my children eat, <br/>
but they aren&#39;t.  My two are the youngest of 6 grandchildren, they&#39;ve seen <br/>
the food battles from my sister&#39;s and brother&#39;s kids.  We have no food <br/>
battles, my parents enjoy a nice quiet dinner with adult conversation.  The <br/>
kids eat if they are hungry, eat what they want and then go play.  No <br/>
whining, no fuss, no begging, no bribery of broccoli for cookies.  It&#39;s the <br/>
one area my parents feel we are doing well with raising our kids.<br/>
<br/>
I still overeat at my mother&#39;s house.  I&#39;ll be 39 in a few weeks.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I know quite a few unschooled teens and some are opinionated and <br/>
independent and sometimes think they are way more capable than they <br/>
really are. They often have come to highly value eccentricity and <br/>
sometimes they kind of force it or go awfully far with it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know some of that California crowd from conferences there.  They&#39;re more <br/>
flamboyant and self-conscious (not thinking of the best word for what I&#39;m <br/>
thinking) than those I know in New Mexico.  The kids here seem calmer and <br/>
more conservative socially (not in a Republican kind of way, but in a less <br/>
dyed-hair and loud kind of way) than some I&#39;m thinking of.  Then again, when <br/>
I see them, there&#39;s company, and when I see them there are often lots of <br/>
other kids and you can get the festive exceptional behavior.    The local <br/>
kids I see when they&#39;re audience-free.<br/>
<br/>
What both those samples have in common, in my mind, is confidence and <br/>
thoughtfulness, consideration for younger kids and the ability to communicate <br/>
with adults without the eye-aversion or fear/disdain I see in schooled kids <br/>
of their age.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414601673">One thing that amazed me when I taught school (and formed how I talk to<br/>
my children now) is how disrespectfully parents talk to their children.<br/>
If your FIL did that to another adult he wouldn&#39;t have friends or<br/>
acquaintances or family who spent any time with him for very long!! It&#39;s<br/>
amazing that somehow people think because children are smaller human<br/>
beings than them, that they can talk to them and treat them like that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I think the definition of &quot;problems&quot; would be a factor.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are still really open with me.<br/>
<br/>
In a family that would be really appalled if a boy had ever peeked at a <br/>
dirty magazine or if a kid went to a concert and took a toke of a passing <br/>
pipe, those would be huge problems.  For me, they wouldn&#39;t be huge problems. <br/>
  And because of that, my kids still talk to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand what you are saying and I totally agree. None of those things <br/>
would be a big deal to me either. And I really want to know that even the <br/>
teenage years can be as wonderful as the younger ones. I don&#39;t want to hear <br/>
problem stuff. I guess for me it would be if I found out my child was lying <br/>
to me about things. I just see so many homeschoolers here still go through <br/>
all the junk a lot of teenagers do that are in school. I really haven&#39;t seen <br/>
a lot of them do better. Now I also know homeschoolers that seem like really <br/>
great kids with no issues like some, at least it seems that way.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is that I generally don&#39;t have any doubts or <br/>
questions at all that unschooling is the best way to go. But at the same <br/>
time, when I think of my 3 youngest hitting the teen years, I can&#39;t help but <br/>
wonder if things will be so different for them then what I went through <br/>
before. I know the circumstances are very different and I&#39;m counting on <br/>
being right. Maybe I just have some guilt left over from thinking I knew my <br/>
child and being totally wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, being that you talk so much about your children, I feel like I <br/>
almost know them. Every time I get to wondering, I think of you and your <br/>
kids and hope my situation will be similar.<br/>
