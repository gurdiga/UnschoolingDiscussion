<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810990722">I don&#39;t have a sling, probably bc they make my husband nervous.  He<br/>
won&#39;t let me get one bc he thinks they look like the baby&#39;s going to<br/>
fall out.  I&#39;ve never used one, but I do have a front carrier that<br/>
criss-crosses in back and a backpack.  We use the carrier when we go<br/>
places where we don&#39;t want to push around a stroller.  I like dad to<br/>
carry her bc he&#39;s stronger and my back usually hurts after 5 min., but 9<br/>
times out of 10 mom ends up with her bc she is happier and more content<br/>
with me.  Usually right after she&#39;s eaten and sleepy he can get away<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have that happen?  That the baby is not so content with<br/>
dad?  With our first daughter, it upset him and he felt bad that she<br/>
would cry when he held her.  Well, I should not say that.  He could hold<br/>
her without her crying, but if she started crying, he couldn&#39;t soothe<br/>
her.  But when he handed her to me, she would instantly stop crying.<br/>
Like I said it hurt his feelings, but now with this one, who does the<br/>
same thing, it kind of makes him mad. He doesn&#39;t act on it and it&#39;s not<br/>
really anger, he just really wishes that he could comfort his crying<br/>
daughter also.  He understands but it still hurts.<br/>
<br/>
Although,  now our first is such a daddy&#39;s girl, it&#39;s not even funny!!!<br/>
She loves mom, but when dad walks in the room her face lights up like a<br/>
Christmas tree!  So, I guess I had my time and now it&#39;s his.  It<br/>
eventually balances out, I guess.<br/>

i believe little girls go in cylcles with prefering one gender parent over the other.  I believe little boys do this,  too,  though the cycles probably differ.  It&#39;s been my experience,  anyway,  with 8 yrs. parenting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly, the stereotype of daddy&#39;s little girl didn&#39;t just appear out of<br/>
thin air.  :)<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I had one child that didn&#39;t like his daddy for the first 6 months of<br/>
his life.  It was my dh&#39;s first child too.  Matt was velcroed to my body and<br/>
than after 6 months or so he would let dad do a few things.  At 18 months<br/>
life turned a corner and dad was great.  :)  But just wait, there might<br/>
arrive a baby that likes dad better first. My last child was like that.  She<br/>
NEVER let me rock her, or sing to her, or much of anything.  I knew she was<br/>
going to be my last child too.  Dad got to do most everything with her.<br/>
<br/>
Balanced, everything eventually gets there. :)<br/>

    All four of my kids did this!  My husband was also hurt a little by it at <br/>
first, but when he discovered how much they &quot;suddenly&quot; liked daddy at about 2 <br/>
years old, he got used to it.  Each of my kids had a turning point, around 2, <br/>
where they wanted to go everywhere with daddy!  (Even the boys did this)  <br/>
Now, I have to admit, that he was still a little hurt even with our last <br/>
child, about them not wanting him as a baby, but he would usually just tease <br/>
me and say that my time was coming, when they would just want him.  And he <br/>
would be right!!  Their special time with daddy just comes when they are <br/>
older.  When they are babies, they like that nurturing time with mom!  :-)<br/>

2 they would cry every time he left...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801631340">Actually I had made the decision when my wife and I were first married.  My<br/>
son came along about 8 years later.  I had started as a computer sales<br/>
person for a Computerland store back in 1984, worked there 3 months and then<br/>
they went broke.  So, with my vast :-) amount of computer knowledge I<br/>
started my own company.  At first I had offices and traveled all around the<br/>
country.  It was okay for that time in my life.  But soon after my son was<br/>
born, I remembered my promise to work out of the house so I could be there<br/>
for him.  So I closed my office and moved into the house.  I have been there<br/>
ever since.  I have grown from being a computer salesman to a software<br/>
engineer and that really helps.  I have also steadfastly remained free and<br/>
independent so I did not get sucked into a big company with all those sticky<br/>
rules lie: You have to show up for work.<br/>
<br/>
It was an enormous financial and professional struggle for years (my wife is<br/>
a SAHM and does not bring in income).  So many times I just wanted to go to<br/>
work for someone else and get that pay check each week.  There were so many<br/>
times when we would struggle with buying more groceries or paying the rent.<br/>
But now I am make very good money programming (from home) for a fortune 500<br/>
company.  It is on an outsourcing basis so they have not particular claim on<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
So I am very lucky and I know it.  But this luck came from years of work,<br/>
learning, struggle and an overriding commitment to my family.<br/>
