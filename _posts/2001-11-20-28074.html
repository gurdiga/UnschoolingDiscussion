<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577891228"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Maybe because as children <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t see that it wasn&#39;t all about them but really about their <br/>
&gt; parents<br/>
&gt; and their parents issues?<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think this is, at least, part of it.  Some environments are less<br/>
healthy than others and I think it can be hard for children to separate<br/>
themselves from their parents, emotionally.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother was very controlling.  She also used food as a reward,  (woof!)<br/>
as comfort, and the lack of food as a punishment.  She was a &quot;clean your<br/>
plate or else&quot;  mom.<br/>
None of us have food issues like weight problems or bingeing, but we all<br/>
still like our comfort foods.  <br/>
My dad was a ( insert anything you like here ) aholic, when I say jump,<br/>
you ask how far on the way up, dad.  <br/>
We all fit into the normal category.  We all left home as soon as<br/>
possible.  My sister got married, secretly, and moved out on her 18th<br/>
birthday, leaving my mom a note.  <br/>
We all turned out ok.  How, I don&#39;t know.&lt;g&gt;   It came out all right for<br/>
all of us, but childhood was terrible.  None of my siblings had more than<br/>
one child and several made the choice not to have any.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe somehow, somewhere we got the message that our parents problems<br/>
didn&#39;t have to be ours forever.  Leaving home meant leaving those issues<br/>
behind.<br/>
I still hope for something better for kids than having to live for the<br/>
day they can leave.<br/>
But it&#39;s an interesting topic,  and I still blame my mom for everything.<br/>
