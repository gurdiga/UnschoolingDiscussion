&lt;&lt; Count me almost in on the 3 boy list.  My triplets are almost three  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   So exciting that you will be homeschooling. Sometimes my boards and lists <br/>
make me miss the East coast. I am originally from PA. All the people I could <br/>
have met live and in person. :o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; This drove me nuts, as I took on homeschooling my son with full <br/>
 responsibility,<br/>
 not on a whim........<br/>
 Bottom line here is that I am so tired of the school, and the damage that<br/>
 they are capable of. The anxiety it produces, makes me work even harder<br/>
 and strengthens me belief&#39;s that I have made the right choice. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
        Big reason we are hsing. We know for certain Zoe would be labeled and <br/>
her spirit broken. As Zoe puts it &quot;I have ants in my pants today Mom, and I <br/>
just can&#39;t get them out!&quot;.  Congratulations Linda on a decision well made.<br/>
