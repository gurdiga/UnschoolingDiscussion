of MS but that was caused by the dentist not my diet and lifestyle.<br/>
Perhaps it doesn&#39;t count cos we are brits living in the US and <br/>
haven&#39;t yet sampled junk food?<br/>
I think some people here would be more healthy if they didn&#39;t go to <br/>
the docs every five minutes for antibiotics. I feel another rant <br/>
coming on...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I think that saying &quot;almost no one in .... [the] U.S. is healthy&quot; is <br/>
a gross generalization that is just not true, I also think that many <br/>
Americans tend to accept low-level poor health (like hypertension and high <br/>
cholesterol, arthritis, and other chronic problems caused by obesity, lack <br/>
of exercise and good air, and poor diet) as being okay.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>
the exact numbers are, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if only very few people <br/>
were in their best condition.  I think people accept feeling tired and <br/>
run-down all the time as the cost of long work days, etc., and they may <br/>
think they are in good enough health.  They may forget that the vitality <br/>
they felt in their teens (if they did) can and should continue for a long, <br/>
long time at least into middle age and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, rant over.  I&#39;ll shut up now.<br/>

Yes, I mean healthy in the sense that their bodies are working at <br/>
their *optimum* level. I&#39;d say easily less than 1% of people I know <br/>
or have met or seen are *healthy*. <br/>
<br/>
The health club I used to go to did Body Age testing, where they <br/>
tested your body fat, evaluated your diet, put you on a treadmill and <br/>
ramped it up until you fell apart, tested your VO2Max (oxygen use), <br/>
etc. and then they told you what your actual bodily age was - as <br/>
opposed to the number of years you&#39;ve lived on the planet. <br/>
Surprisingly, even most people who were tested there (people who had <br/>
bothered to go to a health club and be active in the first place) had <br/>
a bodily age *above* their chronological age. Often well above.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say healthy means that if someone asked you to climb a mountain <br/>
tomorrow, you could do it. You could walk 20 miles if you needed to. <br/>
Healthy means being able to do anything a body your age should be <br/>
able to do. It means not getting every cold that comes along. It <br/>
means getting up every morning and feeling vital and alive. I heard a <br/>
woman, a healthy-looking woman, at the gym yesterday telling her <br/>
friend that every morning she had to have two cups of caffeine and <br/>
three ibuprofin or the stress she&#39;s under gives her a monster <br/>
headache. *every day*. That&#39;s not healthy. Out of a friend&#39;s 6 <br/>
siblings (all in their 30&#39;s or early 40&#39;s), one has had a heart <br/>
attack, two already have diabetes, all are out of shape and <br/>
overweight. That&#39;s not healthy. But they&#39;re very typical Americans. <br/>
<br/>
I know that not all things to do with health are necessarily in our <br/>
control. My body happens to just make thyroid cysts for no apparent <br/>
reason. Is this something congenital, or something caused by the <br/>
pesticides, fumes, etc. on our earth? A holdover from the diet sodas <br/>
I used to drink? I have no idea. People get cancers or diseases, or <br/>
are born with problems. These things happen. But overall, even people <br/>
free from diseases or afflictions or congenital problems are, for the <br/>
most part, not healthy. If Americans overall were healthy, the diet <br/>
industry wouldn&#39;t be a multi-billion dollar industry, there wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be an entire 50-foot-long aisle in the supermarket filled with <br/>
antacids, cold remedies, aspirin, ibuprofen, acetominophen, etc. <br/>
<br/>
How many of us could get up at 5:00 in the morning, milk three cows, <br/>
carry the pails of milk back to the house, churn the cream into <br/>
butter, split the firewood, walk 6 miles to town to get the supplies <br/>
you need to sew all the dresses for your family for the next year? <br/>
That&#39;s what my great-grandma did. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d guess that my definition of healthy is maybe more rigorous than <br/>
what many people consider healthy. I&#39;m not talking about just &quot;not <br/>
sick&quot; though, but optimum health. So yes, almost no-one.<br/>

Well we have 6 healthy people here. 7 if you count my mom who at 76 is going <br/>
very strong. She looks great too. My husband has a bad back but that&#39;s from <br/>
2 major car accidents. Aside from that, we are very healthy. Of course we <br/>
stay away from Dr.&#39;s but not poptarts and blue gatorade!!!!<br/>

Okay, we still have 7 here who fit your bill. IF, we get one cold a year, <br/>
that&#39;s a lot. Even my oldest who goes to school, never gets sick. Maybe once <br/>
every few years with a cold. And if we do get a bug, it&#39;s passed us in a few <br/>
days, really. As far as climbing a mountain, I wouldn&#39;t want to chance it as <br/>
I&#39;ve had no training and that&#39;s not the kind of thing one just does. But <br/>
walking a mountain trail or something, no problem. And it&#39;s not something we <br/>
do, but we could if we had to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty much what your great grandma had to do. I remember my grandma <br/>
walking all over the place well in her 70&#39;s when she was offered rides. She <br/>
didn&#39;t take them because that&#39;s not what she was use to. She walked <br/>
everywhere and far too. If we had to live like that or wanted to, yes we <br/>
could do that too. It would be a matter of time and getting use to it, but <br/>
our bodies could handle it I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
As far as saying most people aren&#39;t healthy in this country, I would a gree <br/>
that a lot aren&#39;t. But I couldn&#39;t say most as I don&#39;t know most people.<br/>
