My 14 y.o. son dyed his hair blue to match his graduation gown from 8th grade <br/>
this year... he paid for it himself - 50bucks... the blue was gorgeous... i <br/>
figured it was a good compromise... he wanted a tongue ring... i told him &quot;no <br/>
permanent body changes til you&#39;re 18&quot;.... just tell the grandparents that it <br/>
could have been a &quot;RAGE&quot; tattoo...marilyn manson piercings or something <br/>
worse... it grows out for god&#39;s sake... my son&#39;s is now just tipped with a <br/>
lovely shade of greenish white... <br/>

 </span></blockquote>yep!  Simply put your arm around dd, smile sweetly and say something like <br/>
&quot;gotta love her!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s picture taking time, call her into the pics with everyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
Been there, done that.  We have a conservative family and I&#39;ve got a son with <br/>
pierced, ear and tongue, long hair and a tattoo on the back of his neck, <br/>
smokes/drinks and isn&#39;t always as careful with his language in public setting <br/>
as I&#39;d like.  His wife also has pierced tongue.  But, hey, they have loads of <br/>
great qualities.  If the g&#39;parents don&#39;t want to get off their soapbox long <br/>
enough to recognize that, it&#39;s the g&#39;parents&#39; loss.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmmm...how about telling them to mind their own business, and ask them how her hair color affects their life in any way.  I mean really, talk about having a hissie over something so small and inconsequential.  Do they love her less now?  I mean, be serious.  Sorry for the cynicism, but I am so disgusted by the lack of respect to young people and their rights from the older generations.<br/>

I don&#39;t have any advice to share, but good luck to you.  And BRAVO!  I have <br/>
said for years that when my girls get older they can do whatever they want <br/>
to their hair INCLUDING dying it pink! My hope with that is that if I let <br/>
them express themselves freely in that way maybe, MAYBE they won&#39;t go off <br/>
the deep end and try other not-so-safe things (like drugs, ect.)<br/>
