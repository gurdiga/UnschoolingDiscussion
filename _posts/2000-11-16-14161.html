I dont *make* my dd do the work books.  I do have 2 lying around - i <br/>
math and one english - I like her to do a page of math per week - but <br/>
dont force it - the books are there if she WANTS to do them.  I also <br/>
have a folder with *fun* things and *brain* things that are there if <br/>
she wants them.  We have lots of games from scrabble to snakes and <br/>
ladders.  Paints - celetape - pen and penciles - boxes and cartons of <br/>
all sizes - knitting wool - key board - guitar - computer games - <br/>
science kit - baking ingredients - you name it....  <br/>
<br/>
To you all.  Thankyou for your help - and thank you to those who have <br/>
children like mine!!!!!<br/>
