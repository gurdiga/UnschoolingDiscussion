<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067643203">Hi everybody,                                                                 <br/>
                                                      I pressed the wrong key <br/>
and my letter got sent without finishing the question. Any way, I have an <br/>
eight year old son that asks a lot of questions which is great BUT lately <br/>
every time I answer his question he comes back with NO that I&#39;m wrong and <br/>
answers it himself but wrong. This is driving me crazy! Has anybody else had <br/>
their kids doing this to them? And how did you handle it.                     <br/>
                        Thanks, Lori                                          <br/>

<br/>
You could say &quot;Then why did you ask?&quot;<br/>
You could ask &quot;How do you know that?&quot; (in a neutral tone of voice) and see <br/>
whether his &quot;wrong&quot; answers are based on speculation, or a misunderstanding <br/>
of something he heard or saw, or what.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll grow out of it.  Marty used to say &quot;ACtually, mom...&quot; lots and lots of <br/>
times and the dispute some answer or account of mine.  It was almost just a <br/>
habit with him.<br/>
<br/>
You could, after the two answers are &#39;on the table,&#39; say &quot;Okay, let&#39;s look it <br/>
up and see which of us is right.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;ll pass. Smile and enjoy his developing self-confidence. Practice <br/>
saying, &quot;Ahhh,&quot; in a noncommittal way. Others will correct him, you don&#39;t <br/>
need to do that - he&#39;ll figure whateveritis out later - it is not important <br/>
that his information is accurate, right now. He&#39;s just playing with the <br/>
whole idea of him having his OWN knowledge and the realization that you <br/>
could be wrong and so on. If you can say things like, &quot;Gosh, you know so <br/>
much,&quot; without sounding sarcastic, that would be a nice thing to say to him.<br/>

Hi, Pam --<br/>
<br/>
I like &quot;Ah&quot;, and I&#39;m going to add that to my repertoire.  It sounds so<br/>
much more professorial than &quot;Huh?&quot; and &quot;Um...&quot;, which is how I sometimes<br/>
respond to my son&#39;s pronouncements of truth that don&#39;t ring true to me.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes say &quot;How did you figure that out?&quot; <br/>

I told Marty, when he was in that phase, that he needed not to be a <br/>
bullshitter and if he was just going to make stuff up pretty soon people <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have faith in his word, and since I didn&#39;t want him to have to undo <br/>
a bad reputation I wanted him to start ONLY saying things he could back with <br/>
fact, starting right then.<br/>
<br/>
He took it okay. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971474486">Hey, Sandra.  I&#39;m probably not that nice.  In my case my 8 year old,<br/>
this year and last year, was expressing his ideas about how the world<br/>
works.  He was telling me his &quot;theories&quot; which he thought might be true.<br/>
 Some of them make my head spin.  Others made me wrinkle my forehead in<br/>
confusion.  But it wasn&#39;t a teenage BSing thing that he was doing.  That<br/>
might have gotten a less sweet response<br/>
