and sleep, sleep, sleep!! &gt;&gt;<br/>

You might want to try some colloidal silver, as well.  It&#39;s a natural <br/>
antibiotic.  You should be able to find it at your local health food store <br/>
and they should be able to tell you how to use it, etc.  Hope that helps too.<br/>

&lt;&lt;sounds like mumps or tonsilitis. Could be trep...its<br/>

<br/>
&gt;I disagree.  The right natural remedies are out there<br/>
&gt;for basically everything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forgive me for lumping these together, but I am on<br/>
digest now and this is the most expedient way to<br/>
address all of these at once.  I&#39;m with you Vic, there<br/>
is an herbal remedy for just about everything, but in<br/>
our chemically driven society it is sometimes hard to<br/>
find the right ones.  I am taking colloidal Silver,<br/>
the rememdy I mentioned yesterday, for this throat<br/>
infection.  I began taking it late yesterday morning,<br/>
and I am feeling worlds better.  Not feverish and<br/>
achey anymore, and the swelling in my throat has gone<br/>
way down, as has the pain.  My throat still hurts<br/>
some, but it is more tollerable now, like a bad sore<br/>
throat, and I am able to control it with extra<br/>
strength tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
I had to get up this morning at 3:30, after having<br/>
slept a good portion of yesterday and all night last<br/>
night I was all slept out!  After bothering my hubby<br/>
for as long as I felt I resonably could (grin), I got<br/>
up and started some homemade soup in the crock pot. <br/>
Plenty of onions and whole garlic cloves.  That should<br/>
fix me up!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for your good wishes.  I am sure<br/>
they played a part too!<br/>

     I have had great experiences with colloidal silver, including getting <br/>
rid of a urinary tract infection...used this and cranberry extract plus drank <br/>
pure cranberry juice diluted with just water.  <br/>
     I&#39;ve also warded off flus that everyone else was getting by starting on <br/>
the colloidal silver right away before getting sick.  It&#39;s good for fighting <br/>
bacteria, viruses, and fungal infections.<br/>
