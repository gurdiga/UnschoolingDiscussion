<div id="ygrps-yiv-91590689">I was wondering if anyone was familiar with the 3D Gamemaker and DarkBASIC software programs for game making. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.darkbasic.com/">http://www.darkbasic.com/</a><br/>

My boys are wanting these programs to get started on creating their own games.  Does anyone have any opinions or advice about these or any other game making programs?<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

3D gamemaker is user friendly for the beginnier.  If you get darkbasick, get the beginner one unless your kids are familiar with computer language.<br/>
<br/>
Regular Darkbasic is harder to use because you have to learn some of the language.<br/>

The darkbasic I&#39;m looking at says it&#39;s suitable for ages 8 and up.  Does that sound like the right one?  I only see darkbasic and darkbasic professional....is the professional one the one you are referring to as &quot;regular&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Also...one other question.  Once you create the games can they be saved to a CD and then played off of that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716625910">We&#39;ve never burned one, but thats because our burner has never worked right, in fact, my whole system is on the fritz and its going in for repairs tomorrow (I&#39;ll be going no mail then).<br/>
<br/>
As for which product.  The one I got was the &quot;flagship&quot;.  On the front page of darkbasic.com there is reference to one for beginners, or at least there used to be.<br/>
<br/>
If in doubt, I&#39;d contact the company and find out.<br/>
