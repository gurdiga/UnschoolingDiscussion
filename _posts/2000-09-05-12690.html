This person moving to NC should contact Lisa Carpenter at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jaydsee@...">jaydsee@...</a>.<br/>
She&#39;s in Gastonia and VERY close to the places mentioned. Also, she should<br/>
join <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NCSecularNetwork@egroups.com">NCSecularNetwork@egroups.com</a>, owned by Diana (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Diana1422@...">Diana1422@...</a>) and<br/>
ask to get on her list. Diana&#39;s is mostly an informative list rather than a<br/>
chatty one but she could make connnections to people in her locale via<br/>
Diana&#39;s list. Also, Diana&#39;s organized a zoo trip to Asheboro on 9-29-00,<br/>
10:30 at the North American Entrance. Call the zoo to make your free<br/>
homeschool reservations and meet us there. Nobody knows anybody...(except a<br/>
few)... it&#39;s a group composed of people on the NCSecular list.<br/>
Anyhow.... Lisa is her best bet at making an unschooling connection in that<br/>
part of the state. I&#39;m too far away from her to get together very often :(.<br/>
Don&#39;t let your friend get confused about Lisa... she owns the NCLoop list,<br/>
which has IMHO been taken over by mostly fundies :( but Lisa is NOT like<br/>
that (a fundie, that is).  I can&#39;t explain why she puts up with all that<br/>
stuff except to say she&#39;s very open and inclusive :-).<br/>
Good luck to your friend. She can contact me anytime she&#39;d like for info.<br/>
Pass my address onto her....<br/>
