<div id="ygrps-yiv-105018706">You know, the first few days I was on this list, I didn&#39;t get ANYTHING.  When I posted to ask why, I was told that it was brand new and no-one was here yet!  Tee hee...Imagine that, me an old timer at 27.  :-)  I have seen plenty of heated topics come and go, and the latest one shall too.  <br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful resource this list has been for me, and I love you all for your many and diverse contributions.  How wonderful that we do NOT all agree on every topic, so that we may learn from and be enriched by each other&#39;s diversity.  Drink deeply and be refreshed!  But don&#39;t gorge yourself or you will get sick!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079336251">You know, it never ceases to amaze me how well the diverse and LARGE population of this list gets along.  It is one of the best behaved and well integrated lists I have ever seen, from a wide range of types of lists.  I think you all deserve a hand for the tolerance, honesty, acceptance and maturity I have witnessed over the life of this list, without getting overly serious with ourselves.<br/>

though, I think that has something to do with it: we unschoolers don&#39;t have <br/>
to be mature ALL the time!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067260045">I know I have added fuel to the fire at times on this list. Sometimes, who I <br/>
show up as here is not my best. Sometimes it is. I guess I can only be who I <br/>
am at any given moment. If I have hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, I do apologize. I <br/>
don&#39;t think it has been my intention to do so, but possibly I speak without <br/>
really thinking about the effect of my words sometimes. I do not apologize <br/>
for stating my beliefs about various things . . . that would be very contrary <br/>
to who I am as an unschooler and just as a human be-ing.<br/>
<br/>
I do not always agree with Sandra, and have no probelm saying so, but I like <br/>
most others, really respect her and what she has to say about unschooling. I <br/>
don&#39;t like the quibbling either, and sometimes I get sucked right down into <br/>
it.  I do believe that most of the time Sandra stays focused on ideas and <br/>
unschooling. . . probably 99 percent of the time. Anyway, I didn&#39;t mean this <br/>
to be a focus on her, but rather on my part in it all. I think I get caught <br/>
up in trying to get others to &quot;see&quot; how they are interacting in the whole <br/>
drama/situation. . . it really is not my job though. It is a mirror to me <br/>
though and it shows me something I need to work on, which is really all <br/>
anyone can do. . . stop focusing on others and focus on the work within. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789630433">Hi ~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have time to read everything, but sigh........I finally found a <br/>
homeschool home, this list is REAL.....and so are the people.......I feel like I <br/>
could say what I&#39;m REALLY thinking.....now if I can find time.  It also is <br/>
confirming my conviction that Unschool really is magical. Being patient, and not <br/>
pushing, and letting them find their way by their heart.....amazing.  Not that I <br/>
do that now.....I&#39;m still trying to deschool myself...but it is my final <br/>
goal.  Just to relax, and know everything is going to be okay. To realize, these <br/>
incredible boys of mine, have incredible dreams in their heads, and to allow <br/>
them to follow that, is the greatest gift of all. Anyway, continue talking about <br/>
the doables, and the styles and ideas of homeschool....and overweight <br/>
children &lt;I&#39;m trying to relax on that one, too&gt; and our dreams....... it&#39;s good to be <br/>
in a real world.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks~<br/>
Michelle<br/>
p.s. Do any of you belong to a local homeschool support group?  How <br/>
supportive are they with unschool?<br/>
