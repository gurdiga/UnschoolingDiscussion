&lt;&lt; He&#39;s been out of school only over the summer, I gather?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes only over the summer.  Mostly he has spent the summer playing with the <br/>
neighborhood kids, and had just recently wrote several songs.  He really did <br/>
not &quot;write&quot; music to them they are mostly about the words.   It should be <br/>
interesting to see what happens when his friends go back to public school and <br/>
he doesn&#39;t.  He was literally begging me to take him out of school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Let him <br/>
know what you think and why you think it--vulgar lyrics, violence, etc., <br/>
but give him the freedom to make his own choices. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I let him know how I feel about the language he uses, and he has no trouble <br/>
with being free..it is not really a matter of giving him the choice... he has <br/>
always kind of done what he  wanted to and been willing to face the <br/>
consequences.  He is exhibiting more control as he has grown older.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; You want to make sure, though, <br/>
that in distancing yourself from music you dislike and disapprove of, <br/>
you don&#39;t dislike or disapprove of him. Sharing some of it together may <br/>
lead to some important communication. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have shared some of this ... I let him download several Eminem  songs and I <br/>
listened and let him keep one or two and deleted the rest...which he resented <br/>
but they were just awful.  He does play music in his room and not to the <br/>
point where it is disturbing to others.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa&#39;s comments:<br/>
&lt;&lt; And, buy him a guitar, keyboard, drum, or whatever instruments he is<br/>
interested in today.  You also might help him (if he wants the help) to<br/>
become healthier in his body.  Maybe a few long walks talking to you<br/>
might help him formulate his musical ideas and help him trim his body<br/>
(FOR HIMSELF, not for others). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lisa all the questions you suggested in the rest of your reply were really <br/>
good questions.  He has access to both a guitar and a full digital piano.  As <br/>
far as his body image.  He just spent an entire week with the cross country <br/>
team  at his brothers high school up in the Sierras running up and down hills <br/>
and camping in the Giant Sequoias(running camp).  The first thing he did when <br/>
he got home was to run weigh himself and came out literally crying because he <br/>
had gained two pounds.  I talked with him about all the variations in weight <br/>
that could occur in any given day  but it did not seem to make him feel any <br/>
better.  I have also talked to him about food choices which is ultimately up <br/>
to him.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It seems to me that <br/>
through your son&#39;s songwriting, he is taking you into his confidence; this <br/>
is a gift. &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;m not sure if this is coming across they way I mean it to. <br/>
I just want <br/>
to say that if you can accept his feelings (the good, the bad, and the <br/>
ugly), you have a chance to be of help to him when the going gets tough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know it is a gift.  He holds back nothing.  You are absolutely right... and <br/>
your post has helped me see that I could ask better questions and gain more <br/>
insight as to what he might be feeling, and look beyond the initial shock of <br/>
the language.<br/>
<br/>
Tuck comments:<br/>
&lt;&lt; My now 17 yo has always trended towards the distasteful or disgusting in <br/>
choices of music, comedy, movies. There was a time (at about 12!) when <br/>
he would say or do the most embarrassing things to get a laugh or a <br/>
reaction. He&#39;s a brilliant and creative person, but I was just <br/>
horrified at some of the ideas he would come up with. Sometimes he was <br/>
parrotting other people, too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
boy can I relate to this<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We had long talks about other people&#39;s perceptions; about how no one <br/>
should be able to control what he thinks or how he expresses himself; <br/>
about free speech; about appropriateness of time and place; about the <br/>
meaning of disgusting or distasteful; about self-control and <br/>
impulsiveness. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad to see this written out.  When these things happen and I am in a <br/>
state of shock I just go blank and all i can think is how could this little <br/>
12 year old say these things.  This really helps! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We came to an agreement. I helped him determine what would be <br/>
considered out-of-bounds in &quot;polite company&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a great idea too. Thank you so much for your all  suggestions and <br/>
feedback I really appreciate it.<br/>

 I hope this post is not too confusing.  It was a nightmare to sort out all <br/>
the replies the way it turned out.  Here is the original post I sent <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; I am having trouble deciding in general where one draws lines. No matter <br/>
how <br/>
much personal freedom one would like to give their children, it seems there <br/>
is always a point at which one has to think about what is too much. My 12 <br/>
year old is very strong willed and seems to enjoy being shocking at times. He <br/>
is also very angry. How do I tell him that though we are supposed to have <br/>
freedom of speech I do not want him to listen to say &quot;Eminem&quot; or some of <br/>
the other rap artists that use very strong and sexual language? Obviously, I <br/>
can tell him, it is a retorical question really. It is difficult to ban <br/>
such things because I cannot stop his being exposed to them. He has decided <br/>
recently to explore song writing and has produced a couple of songs I just <br/>
plain find disturbing. One is about some person finding his girlfriend in <br/>
bed with another guy, and the other is about how life sucks, repleat with <br/>
really strong language. I asked him if it bothered him that other people <br/>
might really be put off by his choice of language and he says he couldn&#39;t <br/>
care less about that...Says it is aimed at all those kids that have made fun <br/>
of him. (he is slightly overweight and hates it, partly why he is not going <br/>
back to PS as usual anymore)<br/>
I am not sure what I am asking here really except that I find myself not <br/>
knowing what to say to him or how to react to this brand of creativity. I <br/>
can understand the acting out of anger but gee I would hate to be raising <br/>
another Eminem. What would you do? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just remembered something else about this time in our lives.  When my <br/>
son was 12, his little brother was only 3.  There was no way I would be <br/>
happy about hearing even the most benign profanity coming out of my 3 <br/>
yo&#39;s mouth.  Besides the &quot;Gram test&quot;, this was something I was <br/>
absolutely adamant about--and that if the baby said something off-color, <br/>
I would know exactly where to find the person who taught it to him, or <br/>
said it in front of him, and there would be serious consequences.<br/>
<br/>
So, another way I helped him determine what was appropriate was to ask <br/>
him if he would like to hear that said by his baby brother.  I think <br/>
this helped more than the Gram test, because he truly does love his <br/>
brother, and had an appreciation for his innocence.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I flat out refused to buy any music for him that I found <br/>
objectionable.  He could certainly buy it for himself if he had money, <br/>
but since he wasn&#39;t willing to work for much money, he rarely had enough <br/>
to buy CDs.  That was my form of &quot;censoring&quot; what he listened to, in the <br/>
same way I&#39;ve never purchased a toy gun. (Yet, there have always been <br/>
toy guns here!)  I&#39;ve never censored his music choice since he started <br/>
working for money at 14.  I simply require that he not expose his now 8 <br/>
yo brother to (most) of it.  :)  He does like a lot of cool music.  He <br/>
turned me on to Dave Matthews, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
I worried, too...what kind of kid was I raising?  It&#39;s just better that <br/>
he can be home and explore that side of things where he can get guidance <br/>
and feedback that isn&#39;t necessarily agreeable with the ideas in the <br/>
music.  I think, at least for my son, it&#39;s a phase.  Both of my older <br/>
boys have gone (are going) through it.  But they&#39;re also kind and <br/>
sensitive and don&#39;t hate women, nor are they racists (two of the reasons <br/>
I despise Eminem).  And I think they will grow through to be good men as <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad I could help.  :)<br/>

He&#39;ll listen to them anyway.<br/>
&quot;Cleaning Out My Closet&quot; plays on the radio many times a day. It is an<br/>
extremely strong and dark song.<br/>
This way, when he has questions about the emotions being expressed and<br/>
actions being sung about, he&#39;ll know not to ask you.<br/>
Listen to them with him. Break the songs down, look at the Lyric books that<br/>
come with CD&#39;s (or on the net)<br/>
Talk about the pain and anger, where it is coming from, what in Eminem&#39;s<br/>
life may have brought these issues up. Somewhere in there. your son&#39;s anger<br/>
will be talked about and maybe he&#39;ll work through it and you&#39;ll both come to<br/>
a better understanding of his feelings.<br/>

<br/>
There were rock&#39;n&#39;roll songs when I was a kid which adults considered &quot;just <br/>
awful&quot; and looking back, they were wrong.  It was awful to them, and <br/>
innocuous to us, and lame in distant retrospect.<br/>
<br/>
I will remind people which songs were considered soul-destroying and <br/>
life-robbing:<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s Spend the Night Together by the Rolling Stones<br/>
Louie Louie by the Kingsmen  (lyrics below)<br/>
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds by the Beatles<br/>
Under the Boardwalk by the Drifters<br/>
<br/>
something by the Animals used to piss moms off, I forget which one.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot; by Manfred Mann (written by Bob Dylan, also recorded by <br/>
the Grateful Dead)<br/>
<br/>
I Think We&#39;re Alone Now (by whoever the heck that was... have to go look it <br/>
up)<br/>
<br/>
......Tommy James and the Shondells<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YES, I know the lyrics now are worse and horrible for parents.<br/>
<br/>
Buy headphones.<br/>
<br/>
Because forbidding popular culture creates fascination with popular culture <br/>
and resentment of mom.<br/>

days we sailed the sea. Me think of girl constantly. On the ship, I dream she <br/>
there. I smell the rose in her hair. Louie Louie, me gotta go. Me see <br/>
