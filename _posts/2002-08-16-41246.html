 Bob,  and others :-),  have you read any of C.S. Lewis? . Lewis uses  logic, similar to the above,  to explain Christianity - not  necessarily religion - in his book &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;. Lewis was C of E and definitely not Fundamentalist. His book is  a compilation of his understandings as a Christian, using logic and clear simple terms..Leonie<br/>
