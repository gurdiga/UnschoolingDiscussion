<div id="ygrps-yiv-566971332">--Speaking of my FIL, though not an unschooler himself, he’s still about  the<br/>
“unschooliest” guy I’ve ever known, and he’s a big fly-fishing guy.   He’d <br/>
be<br/>
thrilled to take anyone who wanted to go on a side trip to the San  Juan for<br/>
fly-fishing and back country camping.  He’s also a New Mexico  history book<br/>
in his own right, not to mention a master furniture maker with a  fully<br/>
equipped shop just down the road from Old Town.  Think of the,  what do you<br/>
call them—funshop-- opportunities?<br/>
<br/>
Seeing local furniture-making would be a fantastic thing to offer  <br/>
out-of-towners!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=--- And, lest we forget, Frontier cinnamon rolls!  I think we could  fit<br/>
about, oh, several hundred or so in our van!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
At Sandia Prep (where Holly and I were on Tuesday) they have a nice  <br/>
cafeteria,and one of the menu items is Frontier rolls!  (For non-locals,  Frontier <br/>
Restaurant is a place across from the university that&#39;s been there  since the <br/>
60&#39;s, and has a butter-drenched cinnamon roll that&#39;s unlike anything  I&#39;ve had <br/>
anywhere else ever.)  <br/>
 <br/>
And Mo Palmer, our old next door neighbor (still lives next door to our old  <br/>
house) was the city&#39;s photo archivist for years and years, until she went to  <br/>
teach New Mexico history at Sandia Prep.  I bet she would come and give a  <br/>
walking tour of Old Town for the conference.<br/>
