<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425287338">I find inspiration in the strangest places &lt;g&gt;... I&#39;m reading Stephen <br/>
King&#39;s _On Writing: a memoir of the craft_.  Before I finished 100 <br/>
pages, I found a few places where external attitudes changed his life.  <br/>
Granted, he was not unschooled by any definition and probably has no <br/>
idea what that term means... still these paragraphs really spoke to me.  <br/>
Substitute the principles of &quot;parenting&quot; or &quot;unschooling&quot; where he <br/>
speaks of writing...<br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
[after his second venture into writing for pay at his school, he is <br/>
called *again* into the principal&#39;s office...]<br/>
    &quot;&quot;What I don&#39;t understand, Stevie,&quot; she said, &quot;is why you&#39;d write <br/>
junk like this in the first place.  You&#39;re talented.  Why do you want to <br/>
waste your abilities?&quot;... She waited for me to answer -- to her credit <br/>
the question was not entirely rhetorical -- but I had no good answer to <br/>
give.  I was ashamed.  I have spent a good many years since -- too many <br/>
I think -- being ashamed about what I write.  I think I was forty before <br/>
I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever <br/>
published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her <br/>
God-given talent.  If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I <br/>
suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that&#39;s all.  <br/>
I&#39;m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.&quot; <br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
    &quot;My wife made a crucial difference during those two years I spent <br/>
teaching at Hampden (and washing sheets at New Franklin Laundry during <br/>
summer vacation).  If she had suggested that the time I spent writing <br/>
stories on the front porch of our rented house on Pond Street or in the <br/>
laundry room of our rented trailer on Klatt Road in Hermon was wasted <br/>
time, I think a lot of the heart would have gone out of me.  Tabby never <br/>
voiced a single doubt, however.  Her support was a constant, one of the <br/>
few things I could take as a given. And whenever I see a first novel <br/>
dedicated to a wife (or husband), I smile and think, /There&#39;s someone <br/>
who knows/.  Writing is a lonely job.  Having someone who believes in <br/>
you makes a lot of difference.  They don&#39;t have to make speeches.  Just <br/>
believing is usually enough.&quot; <br/>
=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
    &quot;You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, <br/>
hopefulness, or even despair -- the sense that you can never completely <br/>
put on a page what&#39;s in your mind and heart.  You can come to the act <br/>
with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and <br/>
take down names.  You can come to it because you want a girl to marry <br/>
you or because you want to change the world.  Come to it any way but <br/>
lightly.  Let me say it again: */you must not come lightly to the blank <br/>
page/*. <br/>
    I&#39;m not asking you to come reverently or unquestioningly; I&#39;m not <br/>
asking you to be politically correct or cast aside your sense of humor <br/>
(please God you have one).  This isn&#39;t a popularity contest, it&#39;s not <br/>
the moral Olympics, and it&#39;s not church.  But it&#39;s /writing/, damn it, <br/>
not washing the car or putting on eyeliner.  If you can take it <br/>
seriously, we can do business.  If you can&#39;t or won&#39;t, it&#39;s time for you <br/>
to close the book and do something else. <br/>
    Wash the car, maybe.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
[diana again]<br/>
This last one really struck me when you replace the writing concepts <br/>
with unschooling ones -- take your whole kid seriously, take your job as <br/>
parent/life coach seriously... if you can&#39;t or won&#39;t, send those kids to <br/>
school.  I don&#39;t want my kids to have memories of me that sound like <br/>
Stephen&#39;s interaction with his principal, I want to create LOTS of <br/>
memories like the ones he has of his wife&#39;s constant support of his <br/>
dreams/who he Is.  This *isn&#39;t* something to be done half-assed.  We and <br/>
our children deserve more. <br/>

Hi, Diana --<br/>
<br/>
I think I recall, that like many many writers and creative people, Stephen King had an extended period out of school as a child, due to illness.  It would make sense to most all of us that of course being in school is terrible preparation for becoming a creative person, and being out of school is much better.<br/>
