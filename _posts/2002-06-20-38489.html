<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506740361">Hi,<br/>
I am fairly new to the digest... have been lurking about a month or so, <br/>
trying to get a feel for &quot;you&quot;.<br/>
We live in the Des Moines, Iowa area.  (I noticed there is a Des Moines, WA <br/>
:-)<br/>
We have two kids ages 9 (boy) and 3 (girl).<br/>
<br/>
I am a public school teacher.  (Thus, we keep ours at home.. :-)<br/>
I found the comment interesting about children getting along better with <br/>
public kids.  We have found just the opposite with our son.  He can&#39;t stand <br/>
so many of the public kids rude language and lack of manners.  Not to say <br/>
that kids staying home don&#39;t have that too, but we must train them, right?<br/>
<br/>
A question?<br/>
Any one have a remedy for constipation and irregularity for our 3 yr. old <br/>
daughter?<br/>
She eats like a bird too.  We&#39;ve tried pears; she gets burned out on them.<br/>
Applesauce seems to constipate her.. odd huh?<br/>
Any ideas would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the neat ideas and suggestions.<br/>
I love the hula hoop &quot;game&quot;  :-)<br/>
I need to try that one with myself and in the school classroom.  (I use some <br/>
unschooling approaches at school too.)<br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First; No, you don&#39;t have to &quot;train&quot; them. As for the constipation she <br/>
probably won&#39;t like the prune juice from Gerber, but try a jar of baby plums. <br/>
Yes, applesauce will constipate!!! As for eating like a bird, feed her like a <br/>
bird. Example meal served at our house: Oven fried chicken, peas, biscuits, <br/>
peach cobbler. When Moly was tiny I would give her two or three small bites <br/>
of chicken, a tablespoon or two of peas and half of a biscuit. Then maybe 45 <br/>
minutes to an hour later I would give her a couple tablespoons full of <br/>
cobbler. I fed her like this all day long, every two hours or so I would <br/>
offer a small chunk of cheese, a handful of grapes, maybe some cereal.  1/4 <br/>
of a p.b.&j sandwich or grilled cheese for lunch. This gave her the <br/>
opportunity to try new foods in small amounts and not overwhelm her with too <br/>
much food. Remember a small child&#39;s stomach is not much bigger than your <br/>
thumb (maybe just smaller than the palm of their hands) so how much can <br/>
really fit in there? If Darin would dish up her plate, her little eyes would <br/>
get so big and she would just pick. He learned quickly that her tummy was <br/>
saying NO WAY is all that going to get down here! Good Luck!<br/>

There&#39;s a Des Moines, New Mexico.  So I hear.  It&#39;s near Capulin.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
been there either.<br/>

Kirby did not like to poop.  Not one bit.   Hated it and so just tried not to <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing totally fixed that.  <br/>
<br/>
Lettuce wrapped around something fun, celery (sliced small), bran muffins, <br/>
grapes.  Helped some, but he was NOT a medicine taking guy and not much of an <br/>
eater.<br/>
