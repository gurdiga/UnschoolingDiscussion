<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710780496">A little more about the neighbor situation....<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe he doens&#39;t know how because he&#39;s not seen it done, or he&#39;s just<br/>
not <br/>
good at it, or he hates school and school books so much he can&#39;t stand to<br/>
look at <br/>
them for one second he doesn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That was exactly my point. His mother though, insists he is lazy and<br/>
careless.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was thinking that this kid missing an assignment or two just might be<br/>
the example he needs to live through in order to discover it&#39;s important<br/>
to keep up with things well.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds vindictive.  Traditionally punitive and anti-child.&gt;&gt;&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
Nope. I&#39;m FAR from anti-child OR vindictive. This kid has never<br/>
experienced that balling up papers in  your locker results in lost stuff<br/>
and suffered grades. It&#39;s not a connection his brain makes. I was<br/>
thinking it was possible that be allowed to make this connection might be<br/>
the very thing that gives him that &quot;aha&quot; moment. Or maybe not. The point<br/>
is, right now, he doens&#39;t get it and mom is spinning her wheels.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Or maybe he doens&#39;t care at all<br/>
and they both need to face that. But her doing it for him, in order to<br/>
keep him from facing any sorrow (and ruining his afternoon fun) isn&#39;t<br/>
resulting in anything but a continuance of frustration on her part. She&#39;s<br/>
getting madder and he&#39;s getting messier. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;re madder than she is, if she laughed, and she did it <br/>
voluntarily.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a little bugged she is so blind to what she&#39;s really doing. She also<br/>
laughed about how she kept him up to 11:30, pulled his hair, and kept him<br/>
from having supper until all those balled up papers were in his organizer<br/>
and all assignments done. To her, mising an assignment is worse than a<br/>
night like that with Mom. She thinks she&#39;s doing him a favor....but what<br/>
she&#39;s doing is *not* going to result in him becoming a neat person. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe he doesn&#39;t care.  <br/>
Maybe she DOES want him to have unruined afternoon fun and lack of<br/>
sorrow.  <br/>
School is sorrow enough.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He doesn&#39;t care about school and yes, it is sorrow for him. He asks to be<br/>
kept home and she&#39;s debating it. However, I don&#39;t always support her on<br/>
that. She&#39;s so controlling of everything that they do that I doubt they&#39;d<br/>
be happier at home. And he got his ruined afternoon, but not in her eyes.<br/>
To her, she was saving him an &quot;F&quot;. When she was young, that was her worst<br/>
fear. He could care less about grades.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And clean dishes to eat from are important to me. My family isn&#39;t<br/>
old enough to clean thier own, or I&#39;d just wash my own and let them work<br/>
out for themselves what was important to them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Would you want them to get old enough to just wash their own and never<br/>
wash <br/>
yours or the rest of the family&#39;s?  Generosity will gain more generosity<br/>
than <br/>
measuring and scheduling and drawing lines can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my kids are too busy to get to something they typically care for<br/>
themselves, and I have a minute, I have absolutely no problem helping<br/>
them out. Right now, they like clean rooms but don&#39;t like to clean them<br/>
themselves. They know I&#39;ve offered to come in once a week and help them<br/>
pick it up. I&#39;m here to help. I do believe that attitude will lead to<br/>
having adults that will help. They do it now...laundry will get cycled<br/>
without me asking and volunteers will crop up here and there for floors<br/>
or dishes. It&#39;s very random but they are young. My comment above was<br/>
speaking of the future...when we are a house full of near adults, I<br/>
really don&#39;t think any one person will in charge of one complete job,<br/>
like the dishes, unless we as a family decided on such a thing. I do it<br/>
now because it&#39;s my job as mom. When they are grown, they may prefer me<br/>
to spend my energy in other helping ways, and take care of their own<br/>
dishes themselves. We will find something that works. But it won&#39;t be<br/>
because we arent&#39; generous enough to one another.<br/>
