<div id="ygrps-yiv-711063464">***If he really wants the school experience for the <br/>
reasons you mentioned, that shouldn&#39;t include stress on the part of the <br/>
parent over him being at &quot;grade level&quot;.***<br/>
<br/>
I think the parent is more stressed that *her child* is stressed over not being at &quot;grade level.&quot;  The thing is, it&#39;s not a matter of being slightly &quot;behind&quot; (according to the school&#39;s definition of grade level), it&#39;s a matter of being *years* behind in his understanding of math and grammar and pretty basic concepts.<br/>
Now, mind you, I don&#39;t believe in that whole grade level perspective and don&#39;t think it applies to real life at all, but it unfortunately does apply to life in school, so if a child is deciding to go to school it&#39;s something to address.<br/>
<br/>
***Sounds like the mother is using the convenient scapegoat of unschooling when <br/>
she may not have fully trusted it in the first place.***<br/>
<br/>
Well, she&#39;s not blaming unschooling since she didn&#39;t really identify with that philosophy anyway.  I don&#39;t even think she&#39;s looking for a scapegoat, actually.<br/>
She&#39;s just having some misguided regrets, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing is bringing me back to contemplating the difference between educational neglect and unschooling.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that the difference between unschooling and mere lack of curriculum is that with unschooling the parents are more proactive about exposing their kids to lots of things and having a rich enough environment and enough communication between parents and children that the children will end up culturally literate anyway.  I&#39;m thinking that mabye the problem wasn&#39;t lack of curriculum and formal &quot;lessons&quot; (as the detractors will say) but actually lack of effective strewing and communication.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me think about this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, this group has a pretty good handle on grammar. And I supposed we <br/>
all use proper grammar (or close) when talking with our children. I <br/>
occasionally &quot;listen in&quot; on some school-at-homer (doh!) groups. Their grammar <br/>
is regularly horrendous---and I mean REALLY bad!. OK, so if they&#39;re TEACHING <br/>
their children THEIR own grammar (hell, if they&#39;re just TALKING daily), how <br/>
are the kids supposed to have any concept of what&#39;s correct?---and what&#39;ll be <br/>
the consequences if they do go to school?<br/>
<br/>
Math? Hard to say on an email list! &lt;g&gt; But basic concepts? I think that when <br/>
the moms are busy teaching---and they&#39;re wrong, then the children are being <br/>
&quot;taught&quot; what&#39;s wrong. When a child is LEARNING, he&#39;s more capable of finding <br/>
the RIGHT ways to do things and learning &quot;right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Was that clear? ;-/ <br/>

Horrible, I mean, horrible.  (I&#39;m not that great a writer, either.)  I <br/>
attribute it to laziness most of the time.  It&#39;s something I need to work on. <br/>
