<div id="ygrps-yiv-120255959">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am curious about the &quot;regular&quot; price for this book.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the Barnes and Noble web page and found the book listed<br/>
as Reg price of $16.95, but through the site I can order it for<br/>
a 20% discount = $13.56.<br/>
<br/>
Is this  a reasonable price???     I already looked in my local<br/>
used-book store, but they didn&#39;t have it.<br/>

sorry I double clicked the last time and sent that last email without a <br/>
response.<br/>
Anyhow, I think $13.56 is a good price, except you have to pay $3.95 <br/>
shipping, so I would wait until they offer a coupon (and I can post it to the <br/>
list, I have a<br/>
friend who sends me these).  Or you could try calling the bookstores in your<br/>
area.  I know some bookstores regularly offer discounts on all their books.<br/>
ps. I didnt&#39; check Amazon, but again you would have shipping charges there <br/>
too.<br/>
