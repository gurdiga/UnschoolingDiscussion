&lt;&lt;  There are at least two colleges in Hancock/Houghton <br/>
<br/>
area and they get many many feet of snow.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That Houghton was my maternal grandmother&#39;s name.   <br/>
She said her dad had run away from his relatives in Michigan.  They were <br/>
rich, and owned a lumber company, she said, and there was a town named after them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I was grown that I discovered it was no little town. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet they don&#39;t know what happened to that wayward Houghton.  His name was <br/>
Wyman, and he moved to Texas and married Lucinda Jane Brooks.   (Just in case <br/>
any LDS geneologists  or Michigan historians are in the crowd. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I just looked it up (thinking all those names were sufficiently unique <br/>
to come up) and some of that&#39;s on an online site, but they have the wrong mom <br/>
for my grandmother.   Wyman remarried and the two girls were by Lucinda Jane <br/>
Brooks.<br/>

Correction:  grandfather.  Joseph went to Texas.  Wyman was born there, it <br/>
seems.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people ran away to Texas in the 19th century, huh?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A little -- you&#39;ll be close to Houghton, a college town (Michigan <br/>
Tech).  The UP is pretty isolated from the Lower Peninsula, but I <br/>
hear Houghton has some things to offer.  You&#39;ll be on the Keewanau <br/>
Peninsula, jutting into Lake Superior, which I&#39;m told is wild and <br/>
beautiful.  You&#39;ll have some serious winters, though the lake effect <br/>
will keep things a little warmer than they could be -- lots and lots <br/>
of snow, though.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;ll be not too far from Marquette, where a good friend of mine <br/>
lives.  Maybe when I go up to visit her, we can meet!<br/>

<br/>
The good news -- you do get a fair amount of sun (unlike us in West <br/>
Michigan -- it&#39;s usually gray because of cloud cover from Lake <br/>
Michigan).  My friend in Marquette is winter gardening -- cool.<br/>
