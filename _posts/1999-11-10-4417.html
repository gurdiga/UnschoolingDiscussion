<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;to be a greater influence than parents.  Gee, could this be because<br/>
&gt;children enrolled in school and numerous activities rarely see their<br/>
&gt;parents?  Oh, I forgot about all that quality time spent in the car<br/>
&gt;driving to and from all those activities!<br/>
&gt;Mary Ellen<br/>
&gt;Thanks.  I needed that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think we have had the discussion before onthis list abuot schooling for<br/>
young children causing peer dependence and a drift from the family?  At any<br/>
rate, you end up with kids who do not have a strong connection to their<br/>
immediate families and who spend more time every day with their peers,<br/>
therefor having more emoitonal dependence upon the approval of their peers.<br/>
<br/>
I recently watched a program created by Wash. state first lady Mrs. Gov.<br/>
Locke about education in China.  She has a young child and is a Chinese<br/>
American, so she took a group of educators from various fields (day care,<br/>
PS, Elemenatary, Private Primary, Music teachers, etc) from Wash. state on<br/>
a tour of Chinese educational facilities, etc.  Not only were the schools<br/>
larger and had longer hours, but they were more strict.  50+ kids in a<br/>
class (even 5 year olds) all reciting in unison, sitting with their hands<br/>
folded in their desks, in their starched uniforms, etc.  They also focused<br/>
on more arts and sciences as required subjects and expected (and got) much<br/>
more from much younger children than we do in the US.  This is all cultural<br/>
of course.  The large population necessitaites larger groups, and the<br/>
primary cultural concern with raising competitive workers pushes parents to<br/>
push their children.  Kids are expected to be in after school programs, in<br/>
or outside of school, that push arts and music, everything from classical<br/>
Chinese instruments and calligraphy to modern western forms like jazz, tap,<br/>
ballroom danicing, saxaphone and piano.  When having kindergarteners paint,<br/>
a teacher paints a picture and puts it on the board, and the children must<br/>
emmulate it as closely as possible.  50+ 5 year olds all painting the same<br/>
picture.  <br/>
<br/>
That is the public schools, private schools have higher expectations.  The<br/>
state runs kindergarten boarding schools, which function much like private<br/>
schools here, in that the families must pay more money to send their<br/>
children there.  Kindergarten in China is from age 3 to age 8.  The<br/>
children (3 and up) attend all week and go home with their parents on the<br/>
weekends.  They sleep in rooms crowded with little beds (literally wall to<br/>
wall, you could roll across the room on the beds) and have a heavy class<br/>
schedule including academics, calasthenic (sp?) drills, music and arts, and<br/>
scheduled &quot;free play&quot; time.  Talk about peer dependence and severing the<br/>
parental child bond!  The kids are kept in line in all the schools by the<br/>
threat of being shamed in front of their peers and &quot;losing face&quot; in front<br/>
of the teachers.<br/>
<br/>
The key and goal for China is to have a cohesive, cooperative force of<br/>
workers who are accomplised in various skills and can compete in the<br/>
competitive world market.  It puts things really in perspective when you<br/>
look at two important facts.  1) Family is of Primary importance to the<br/>
Chinese, who revere their elders and cherise their children, and 2) The<br/>
Chinese are only by law allowed to have one child.  These parents are<br/>
sacrificing their time with their only child in order to help them &quot;get<br/>
ahead&quot; early.  They would most likely laugh at our concerns with autonomy<br/>
and self direction, spiritual growth and emotional wholeness.  They would<br/>
probably feel sorry for our children because they would think they would<br/>
not be on the cutting edge and would not keep up in the rat race.  <br/>
<br/>
However, it has been my experience that no matter what age kids learn<br/>
thngs, it all evens out according to ability and inclination when they get<br/>
to be adults.  As long as they have ample opportunites to be exposed to<br/>
art, literature and sciences, as well as more basic skills, and are in a<br/>
supportive and healthy environment, kids will take what they want and leave<br/>
the rest.  This is regardless of whether they are in IS, boarding school,<br/>
Homeschooled, etc.  Can you tell by someone&#39;s handwriting how early they<br/>
learned to read and write as a child?  Does preschool music class show in<br/>
the adult?  Does a good GPA in gradeschool mean anything in your adult life?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just thought this discussion on bonding was in the realm of the<br/>
program I watched and I wanted to share.<br/>

    This sounds like a program for assembly line conformists. I immediately <br/>
thought that it is a good thing that Hitler did not know of this. How sad.<br/>
