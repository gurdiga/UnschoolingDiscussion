<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043861805">Just a reminder:<br/>
<br/>
Any communication by list owners  or moderators to individuals about <br/>
their adherence or non-adherence to the list posting policies will be <br/>
done on an individual basis and privately and NOT on the list.<br/>
<br/>
New list members are on moderation when they first subscribe, so we can <br/>
catch their posts and ask for them to be revised. People who don&#39;t <br/>
follow the posting policies will also be put on moderation so that we <br/>
can catch disruptive posts before they are made public. We don&#39;t <br/>
moderate everybody on the entire list, so we can&#39;t promise that nobody <br/>
will ever post anything that violates the posting policies. If they do, <br/>
we will communicate with them offlist.<br/>
<br/>
It is up to each individual to ask themselves if they are contributing <br/>
to the usefulness of the list to those who are trying to better <br/>
understand unschooling. Sometimes a topic can be sort of &quot;beaten to <br/>
death&quot; - it may have been useful for a while, but at some point <br/>
everything useful that can be said about it has been said and people <br/>
are simply digging in their heels and not listening to each other, in <br/>
full defensive mode. If one feels they&#39;ve moved into that mode, that&#39;s <br/>
the time to just stop. The time will be different for different people. <br/>
When its time, it can help to just let somebody else have the last <br/>
word. Talk, instead, about something that has greater usefulness to the <br/>
list.<br/>
