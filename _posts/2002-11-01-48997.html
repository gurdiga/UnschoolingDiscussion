&lt;&lt;  I believe whole heartedly that my boys(age 5 yrs) can and will learn <br/>
without having curriculums to follow, and without me formally teaching them <br/>
everything. But, I don&#39;t really get how the whole picture goes together. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gradually.<br/>
Imperceptibly sometimes.<br/>
Lumpily, in fits and starts.<br/>
<br/>
You can think of an unschooling month as a month of Sundays (unless you have <br/>
really structured Sundays, in which case substitute a month of Saturdays).<br/>
You can think of it as the best summer vacation days you can ever remember, <br/>
without end.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you set up or &quot;stage&quot; things, then see if they get interested in <br/>
something, and then find more info and/or activities to relate to that <br/>
subject? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, sort of, but not regularly or intentionally.   I might leave <br/>
magnets out.  But I&#39;m not hoping to trigger anyone to be a physicist or <br/>
chemist or electronics engineer.  I put the castle blocks out from time to <br/>
time, but I don&#39;t aim for medieval history or structural engineering.<br/>
<br/>
If I do notice something sparks that sparkle, though, I&#39;ll put another <br/>
similar thing in the path within a day or a week if it&#39;s easy to do and if I <br/>
remember.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or, do you just kind of go about your day with your interests and let them <br/>
discover things on their own and ask you questions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, and sometimes I ask them questions.  I go about OUR day with OUR <br/>
interests.  Sometimes it flows together, and sometimes it granulates apart.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; but I guess it just doesn&#39;t seem like we have enough excitement around <br/>
here. I am worried that I somehow need more to spur their curiosity?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not every day has to be exciting.  But SOME days should be exciting.  <br/>
Sometimes it will be something you planned, and sometimes excitement will be <br/>
thrust upon you when you least expect it.<br/>
<br/>
Be loose enough that if a wave comes you can ride it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They really seem bored at times. I keep thinking, how can they be bored <br/>
already, they are only 5! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why should older people be bored more easily than younger ones?  I would <br/>
think that the more able to do and be independently, the less need for <br/>
boredom.<br/>
<br/>
What I think about boredom (and I thought about it a long time) is here:<br/>

When you&#39;ve read that if you like it any, click on the &quot;other articles&quot; link <br/>

I think lots of that will be helpful.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I really thought that I had a handle on what unschooling is. The definitions <br/>
&gt; I see here totally resonate with me. And everything I have read, I feel <br/>
&gt; comfortable with. However, I am struggling on what it &quot;looks&quot; like IRL, if <br/>
&gt; that makes any sense. Do you &quot;plan&quot; any learning? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t say that I &quot;plan&quot; any learning. But, then again, I do. I do go out <br/>
of my way to make sure they have the tools to be able to interact when we go <br/>
somewhere. Both my kids like to help cook (Moly is really taking off and is <br/>
doing a lot of things on her own.) before we go to the store, I make a list. <br/>
Usually the day before we go, I tell the kids. I also remind them if there is <br/>
anything they are wanting to fix, they need to look up the recipe, check for <br/>
needed ingredients, and add to the list. I also give them their own money. So <br/>
right there, they have learned planning, research skills, cooking, nutrition, <br/>
money skills, shopping savvy... The thing is, though, I don&#39;t think of a trip <br/>
to the store like that. I can break it down here, but I don&#39;t go about my day <br/>
thinking of ways to help my kids learn a specific subject. I think that is <br/>
where the hang-ups start. We start thinking too much about what they should <br/>
know, right now, and how can we set up a situation to make that happen. <br/>
Instead of just letting it happen in its own time. That isn&#39;t to say that I <br/>
don&#39;t plan something&#39;s, I said above that I do. I plan things because that is <br/>
me, I&#39;m a planner with lists all over. But I don&#39;t make set up situations, or <br/>
plan a trip to the grocery store just so the kids will learn all the things <br/>
above. I don&#39;t set up the check out time as a math lesson on money. I don&#39;t <br/>
set up the produce aisle as a lesson in nutrition. <br/>
<br/>
I believe whole heartedly that my boys(age 5 yrs) can and will learn without <br/>
having <br/>

&gt; kind of go about your day with your interests and let them discover things <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do and I don&#39;t. When I set Jack up in Karate lessons, my motive wasn&#39;t to <br/>
get him into karate, or even see if he liked karate. My motive was this, &quot;my <br/>
little guy looks bored sometimes, and then he starts running around, picking <br/>
on his sister, and this house is too small...&quot; Then the parks and rec. <br/>
catalogue came one day and I was looking through it and saw something&#39;s I <br/>
thought would be fun, so I gave it to the kids and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you guys <br/>
pick out something fun to do.&quot; Jack picked Karate and Moly picked an acting <br/>
class. (which because of low enrollment got canceled and because she wasn&#39;t <br/>
the right age or right grade she couldn&#39;t join the other classes. Is <br/>
childhood age discrimination allowed?) So now they are both in Karate and <br/>
both love it. I didn&#39;t pick the class, they did. I saw a need for a better <br/>
outlet for their energy and gave them the tools to do it. <br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t mean that I would just sit around eating bon-bons and not have to be <br/>
present <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; , but I guess it just doesn&#39;t seem like we have enough excitement around <br/>

&gt; really seem bored at times. I keep thinking, how can they be bored already, <br/>
&gt; they are only 5! I hope this question is clear. <br/>
&gt; Can anyone help me understand? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if you have noticed a need to fill &quot;boredom,&quot; (which I do believe is okay <br/>
to be and have at times in your life). Then give the kids better things to <br/>
work with and play with. Hand them the parks and rec. catalogue, rotate some <br/>
new/old toys in and out. Move the crayons and paper to a more accessible <br/>
location. Leave the entertainment section of the newspaper out, or read it <br/>
out loud to them. Help them be participants in life instead of just tagging <br/>
along beside you. Give them money to spend when they are at the store, let <br/>
them see you making the grocery list and ask them if there is anything they <br/>
need so you can put it on the list. But don&#39;t make it fake. Ask them just <br/>
like you ask any adult. &quot;Honey, I&#39;m going to the store later, do you need <br/>
anything?&quot; Darin usually says deodorant or a new toothbrush and sometimes he <br/>
says &quot;Yeah, get me some of those things you got that one time with the....&quot; &lt;<br/>
g&gt; My best advice is to not try too hard. Just include them in your life. <br/>
Don&#39;t make them do a book report. Listen to them when they come to you and <br/>
tell you all about this new character who put a kink in the hero&#39;s plans. <br/>
