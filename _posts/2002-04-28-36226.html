<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605949555">(see also, perhaps first: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tcs.ac/Articles/WhatIf.html">http://www.tcs.ac/Articles/WhatIf.html</a> )<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve discovered a general answer for how to solve what if questions<br/>
where a child is doing something the parent sees as horrible.  It&#39;s<br/>
actually quite simple.  All that&#39;s required is *explaining* the child&#39;s<br/>
behavior.  What is the child trying to accomplish?  Why does ey want to do<br/>
[horrible thing X]?  This lends itself to many simple solutions.  How else<br/>
could child accomplish eir goal?  Let me use an example to illustrate.  Ben<br/>
is 4 years old, and his mother, Olivia, has taken him to a toy store where<br/>
he is playing with toys.  Olivia wishes to leave a 4pm, with Ben, to go to<br/>
the airport to meet her spouse and drive him home.  So:  What if Ben doesn&#39;<br/>
t want to leave at 4pm?<br/>
<br/>
At this point most parents would assert that &quot;whiny children can&#39;t always<br/>
have their way,&quot; and carry Ben, kicking and screaming, to the car, where<br/>
they strap him in (reminiscent of mental institutes who tie up their<br/>
patients) and drive off.  Coercing children is so common that kicking and<br/>
screaming do not seem to alarm parents.  These behaviors, last resorts to<br/>
alert parent eir behavior is problematic, and even attempts to physically<br/>
stop or hurt parent, amazingly, do not set off warning bells that something<br/>
is going wrong.  Of course, something is very wrong.  So, let us apply my<br/>
general solution.  Explain why Ben wants to stay.<br/>
<br/>
*Olivia forgot to tell Ben in advance that they would be leaving.  He is<br/>
playing with a toy and suddenly is whisked off in an instant.  Ben simply<br/>
needed some advanced warning of when they would leave.  Alternately, Olivia<br/>
told Ben they would be leaving at 4pm, but didn&#39;t give any useful warnings,<br/>
such as reminding Ben at 3:30, 3:45, 3:50, and 3:55.*<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is Olivia&#39;s fault.  How would she like it if she were involved<br/>
in some great project and, without warning, she was forced to stop?  Not at<br/>
all!  Projects are important for everyone, and disrupting projects is quite<br/>
harmful to the learning process.  The solution is that Ben needs a warning<br/>
before they go, so Olivia should simply tell him that they need to go as<br/>
soon as possible, and then wait for Ben to finish his current project.<br/>
Father can wait.  If Ben is going to need a significant amount of time,<br/>
Olivia can call father and explain the situation.  Then he can take a taxi<br/>
home if he wants.<br/>
<br/>
*Olivia did not forget to give Ben warnings.  But Ben misjudged the time<br/>
and is in the middle of a project at 4pm.  Olivia wants to go, and feels<br/>
she has done nothing wrong.  Now what?*<br/>
<br/>
Again, let Ben finish his project.  Did he choose to have a rigid<br/>
appointment his calendar?  No.  Even if he &quot;agreed&quot; at the time, he didn&#39;t<br/>
mean it, or understand what it would entail.  Olivia should not force rigid<br/>
schedules on her son.  As before, she can call and tell father, and he can<br/>
take a cab if necessary (or wait, or call a friend to pick him up, or any<br/>
number of other solutions).<br/>
<br/>
*Ben really likes a certain toy.*<br/>
<br/>
Well, buy the toy and take it with you.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben just wants his way.*<br/>
<br/>
Life is not a zero-sum game.  Families shouldn&#39;t be parents against<br/>
children, mother against son.  If this explanation is actually true, and I<br/>
doubt it is, it must be because Ben has by systematically coerced for much<br/>
of his life, denied his wants, and taught (by living it out) that life is a<br/>
battle for each person to try to force eir way.  The solution is to never,<br/>
ever initiate force against one&#39;s child, and to explain that life is not a<br/>
zero-sum game.  If Ben hates Olivia, finding a CP will be very hard.  This<br/>
is all the more reason to use TCS in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
*Isn&#39;t this letting the child coerce the parent?  Don&#39;t parents have<br/>
rights?  Why is Ben allowed to violate Olivia&#39;s rights?*<br/>
<br/>
This objection has false premises.  Olivia is thinking &quot;I want to leave,<br/>
but I can&#39;t because of Ben, so he is coercing me to not leave.&quot;  But she is<br/>
wrong.  She could leave.  And Ben could stay where he is.  Everyone has a<br/>
right to determine where to be.  If she was with a friend, this is what<br/>
would happen.  Attentive readers are probably now screaming at me that<br/>
Olivia can&#39;t leave Ben behind.  Well, they&#39;re right, but this is hardly Ben<br/>
&#39;s doing.  What Olivia is actually resenting is her own parental<br/>
obligations that she created of her own free will by having a child.  To<br/>
blame Ben for her own obligations, taken on by choice, is unfair.  So no,<br/>
Ben is not coercing Olivia; she is simply resenting her past choices.  This<br/>
is her own personal problem, and she is obligated to keep it from Ben as<br/>
best she can.  She should sort it out herself (and with any friend who<br/>
wants to listen or help).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New situation.  Ben is hitting another child, Sue, with a baseball bat.  (I<br/>
know this sounds crazy, but I was recently asked exactly this.)  Well, now<br/>
what?  Explain it!<br/>
<br/>
*Coercion damage.*<br/>
<br/>
Practice TCS.  Figure out what entrenched theory is causing the hitting (in<br/>
other words, get a more detailed explanation).  Now rationally criticize<br/>
this theory and offer some alternatives so that Ben can improve his<br/>
worldview.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben likes hitting things with baseball bats.*<br/>
<br/>
Well, get him something else to hit, like a sandbag.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben likes hitting noisy things with baseball bats.*<br/>
<br/>
Get a sandbag and an audiocassette with appropriate sounds.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben likes hitting noisy things that move with baseball bats.*<br/>
<br/>
Find or build an appropriate toy/structure.  Or maybe suggest that baseball<br/>
(or t-ball) is much more fun, and let Ben try that.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben is mad at Sue.*<br/>
<br/>
Why is Ben mad at Sue?  A better explanation is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben is mad at Sue because Sue took Ben&#39;s toy truck.*<br/>
<br/>
Get Ben&#39;s truck back.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben is mad at Sue because she has cooties.*<br/>
<br/>
Explain that cooties don&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben is mad at Sue because she is ugly.*<br/>
<br/>
Explain that initiating force is wrong.  Offer Ben some pretty pictures to<br/>
look at.  Explain that Sue can&#39;t control her appearance.  Explain that<br/>
hitting Sue with a baseball bat does not make her pretty.  Try to find<br/>
pretty friends for Ben.<br/>
<br/>
*Ben is mad at Sue because she called him stupid.*<br/>
<br/>
Explain to Ben that Sue is mean and wrong.  Explain that hitting her with<br/>
the bat doesn&#39;t solve the problem.  Ask Sue not to insult Ben anymore.  If<br/>
she does, keep her away from Ben.  Compliment Ben so he feels better.<br/>
<br/>
*General form: Sue caused Ben distress.*<br/>
<br/>
Solve *that* problem, and Ben won&#39;t want to hit Sue anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many what if questions, prima facie, seem impossible to solve without<br/>
coercion.  *Oh my God, Ben is hitting Sue, I better grab him and lock him<br/>
in his room!*  might be a typical response.  And, if the only information<br/>
available is &quot;Ben is hitting Sue,&quot; then I think the problem may not be<br/>
soluble.  However, a little more information, in the form of an explanation<br/>
of the [objectionable behavior X] will render the question near trivial.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938509054">If anyone finds the TCS discussions annoying, you&#39;ve got a delete button :-)<br/>
<br/>
Reading and debating the TCS style of thinking helped me a lot in developing<br/>
my unschooling philosophy so I think it can be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be helpful to those who don&#39;t want the list to become a TCS<br/>
discussion list, to label any TCS viewpoints as TCS (just tack a TCS onto<br/>
the subject for instance) so those who are getting something out of that<br/>
view point can continue, but those who aren&#39;t can easily delete them.<br/>
<br/>
That way you wouldn&#39;t be forcing the TCS ideas on those who don&#39;t want them.<br/>
It could be a win-win situation :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how this works. And all thoughts on this are welcome.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Explain that cooties don&#39;t exist. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cooties do too exist. It&#39;s a word for lice.  <br/>
Better to tell her that it&#39;s rude to play &quot;cooties&quot; in a tag-game kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;*Ben is mad at Sue because she is ugly.*<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s disgusting to me.  <br/>
Sue&#39;s appearance shouldn&#39;t be a cause for Ben to be rude and insulting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
*Ben is mad at Sue because she called him stupid.*<br/>
<br/>
Explain to Ben that Sue is mean and wrong.  Explain that hitting her with<br/>
the bat doesn&#39;t solve the problem.  Ask Sue not to insult Ben anymore.  If<br/>
she does, keep her away from Ben.  Compliment Ben so he feels better.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that parental behavior keeps up, a LOT of people are going to think Ben is <br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
Telling a child that someone else is &quot;mean and wrong&quot; could pretty easily <br/>
justify somene else telling a child he is &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The parent who tells stupid and mean Sue not to insult poor innocent Ben <br/>
anymore isn&#39;t doing the world any really big favors.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Explain that hitting her with<br/>
the bat doesn&#39;t solve the problem.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Explain that hitting her with the bat is assault and could be considered <br/>
attempted murder when he&#39;s older and that reform schools and prisons are way <br/>
more real than TCS is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;*General form: Sue caused Ben distress.*<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Solve *that* problem, and Ben won&#39;t want to hit Sue anymore.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Glaring truth:  Ben is distressed when he isn&#39;t coddled, and isn&#39;t being <br/>
given tools to get along in the world.   Sue did not *cause* Ben&#39;s distress.<br/>
<br/>
TCS seems to me a &quot;method&quot; for families who are greatly lacking in the <br/>
interpersonal/intrapersonal skills departments.   <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to keep sharing my life in public, because I have some very <br/>
well-adjusted kids who have learned some amazing things without coercion (I&#39;m <br/>
speaking English here, not using the jargon of a small group with a theory <br/>
and no evidence), without &quot;being taught&quot; in any traditional way, who are <br/>
learning all about life and living it even while they&#39;re little, who are <br/>
trusted and trusting and thoughtful.   <br/>
<br/>
I will also occasionally be rebuked and insulted by people who have bought a <br/>
theory and will repeat the rhetoric without offering any actual evidence that <br/>
it is or has worked with real people in any longterm way.<br/>
<br/>
And others will read all that and some of it will affect their lives and most <br/>
won&#39;t, and I will continue to share what I know in an open and honest way, <br/>
and others will occasionally come by to pick at it and suggest off-the-wall <br/>
methods which imply that unschoolers don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247491283">*Ben is mad at Sue because she called him stupid.*<br/>
<br/>
Explain to Ben that Sue is mean and wrong.  Explain<br/>
that hitting her with<br/>
the bat doesn&#39;t solve the problem.  Ask Sue not to<br/>
insult Ben anymore.  If<br/>
she does, keep her away from Ben.  Compliment Ben so<br/>

<br/>
*General form: Sue caused Ben distress.*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a serious queston in regards to this situation.<br/>
 The Statement here &quot; Explain to Ben That Sue is mean<br/>
and wrong&quot; sounds that it is ok to call Sue names. <br/>
Sue could have had a reason for calling Ben stupid. <br/>
He could of pulled her hair or he just showed up.  Yes<br/>
she did cause ben distress, but he obviously caused<br/>
hers as well. Iwould think a parent would approach him<br/>
and tell him that sue was angry and she hurt your<br/>
feelings. Instead of stating that hitting her doesn&#39;t<br/>
solve the problem how about stating it doesn&#39;t change<br/>
what happened. It&#39;s ok to be angry but we cannot beat<br/>
sue just because he is angry.<br/>
<br/>
Am i thinking still in TCS mentality of handiling the<br/>
situation?  I am really curious.  I do understand that<br/>
the example where just examples of possible answers.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330499252">For those who just joined, TCS (Taking Children Seriously) is a parenting<br/>
philosophy separate from unschooling. You can understand unschooling fine<br/>
without reading a bit about it. (The webpage for TCS is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tcs.ac/)">http://www.tcs.ac/)</a><br/>
<br/>
If you find the TCS discussions annoying, try the delete button :-)<br/>
<br/>
From my experience if no one responds to a conversation, it goes away. (But<br/>
that would be induction and apparently Hume showed that doesn&#39;t work.)<br/>
<br/>
Reading and debating the TCS style of thinking helped me a lot in developing<br/>
my unschooling philosophy so I think it can be valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be helpful to those who don&#39;t want the list to become a TCS<br/>
discussion list, to label any TCS viewpoints as TCS (just tack a TCS onto<br/>
the subject for instance) so those who are getting something out of that<br/>
view point can continue, but those who aren&#39;t can easily delete them.<br/>
<br/>
That way you wouldn&#39;t be forcing the TCS ideas on those who don&#39;t want them.<br/>
It could be a win-win situation :-)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll see how this works. And all thoughts on this are welcome.<br/>
