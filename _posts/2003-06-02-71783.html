<div id="ygrps-yiv-327262030">&lt;&lt;They were also the ones testing me with shock value to see how I would <br/>
respond.  I responded in with my own version of shock value to let them know <br/>
I was not at all surprised by their questions, that their questions were <br/>
totally normal, and that I had answers to those questions that I would <br/>
freely share. Since we were all using shock value humor to get the <br/>
conversation started, nobody was embarrassed.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  This reminds me.  I haven&#39;t been on much lately what with looking for a <br/>
house and trying to live with no ac and 100+ degree weather (ALREADY...UGH) <br/>
but I wanted to follow up with my boys and girls thread which ties in with <br/>
this one.<br/>
<br/>
Haleigh and Scott are still talking on the phone.  Actually haven&#39;t in a <br/>
couple of days now that I think about it.  Of course at first, they were on <br/>
the phone non-stop, a million times a day. :)  Things are already slowing <br/>
down as I expected.<br/>
<br/>
Haleigh and I were talking in the car one day, just the two of us and she <br/>
brought him up.  She was saying something about one of the camp counselors <br/>
calling him her boyfriend and that lead into a discussion about kissing, <br/>
holding hands, sex, etc.  She started to get really uncomfortable so I <br/>
lightened the subject up with a lot of humor and she felt more relaxed so we <br/>
kept talking.  At one point we were discussing them sleeping alone in the <br/>
shed together and I talked to her about boys, in general, putting the moves <br/>
on girls when they aren&#39;t ready and how things can get out of hand so fast <br/>
that you don&#39;t even *want* to say no anymore.  I shared some of my past <br/>
experiences with her and regrets and mistakes I made.  We were laughing <br/>
lightly and really having a great bonding moment.  Then I pop off and say <br/>
something along the lines of &#39;hormones and penises make boys crazy&#39; and I <br/>
thought she was going to fall out of the car!  She died laughing and I made <br/>
a quick recover that there are girls out there like that too and went on to <br/>
explain.  She was totally and completely shocked that I said that.  Her face <br/>
was bright red and she kept saying MOOOUUUUMMMM!!!!!  It was so funny! LOL  <br/>
It was nice though, that we were able to be so open with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the shock value conversations are the ones they really remember.  <br/>
Those &#39;motherly&#39; toned speeches just flow through the ears like wind, but <br/>
say a funny and they don&#39;t forget!  I think it also helps to drive home the <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone for their responses to my &#39;boys and girls&#39; post.  I <br/>
feel soooo much better about it all now.  It was our first boy experience <br/>
and it has been smooth sailing and really opened the doors to lots of great <br/>
talks that we&#39;ve had a million times but now have new meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!!!<br/>
<br/>

<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>

Ok, I&#39;ll share my little story too.  I might have shared before, but here goes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, my 14 year old and his 13/14 year old friends came up to me and asked me if I was prepared for the future.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure what they were getting at, until they whipped out packaged condoms from their pockets and yelled &quot;WE ARE!!!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They thought they were going to embarass me LOL.  Right off the cuff I said &quot;well, you DO know they only work when you *wear* them, right?&quot; .<br/>
<br/>
Peals of laughter followed LOL.  With the awkward moment out of the way, we then went on to discuss the fact that condoms can and do break (all brands), the subject of unwanted pregnancy, and the transmission of diseases like AIDS and Hep B and C.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t entirely sure I had handled the first part very well, but when they were then receptive to good information, I figured it was worth it.<br/>

Don&#39;t all of us remember the boys in high school having them rubbers in<br/>
their wallets so long you could see the outline from the outside of the<br/>
leather???? No way in hell I would want to rely on one of those!!!!!!<br/>

dirty words--they know you are taking it seriously somehow and not babying<br/>
them.  Not sure why that works, but it always did with me when my &quot;grown<br/>
ups&quot; did it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because it includes the grown up in the categories being discussed?<br/>
It&#39;s not all about what your kids are doing but about what human beings are<br/>

I think maybe its because they know you are treating them as adults themselves, first by not shying away from the subject, but also not making an issue out of how they approached it.<br/>
