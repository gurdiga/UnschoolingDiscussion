<div id="ygrps-yiv-265585795">I live near Albany, NY and the conference is not too far from here.  I am <br/>
considering attending this year but have never attended a homeschool conference <br/>
before and am wondering if the Live & Learn Conference is always in the same <br/>
place or does it move around the country?  My son is not yet school age and I&#39;m <br/>
trying to decide if I should go this year while it is close by before I lose <br/>
my chance at having it only a few hours away.  I am also thinking of going to <br/>
the New England Homeschool & Family Learning Conference (not strictly <br/>
unschooling), has anyone been to this before?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amanda<br/>

<br/>
Even a conference that stays in one places will eventually and sometimes <br/>
unexpectedly have its last year.   I wouldn&#39;t wait.<br/>
<br/>
But that conference was in South Carolina the last two years, it&#39;s in Boston <br/>
for one big show, and last I heard, talk was of St. Louis in 2005.  <br/>

You will lose your chance, most likely, and going now could make your life <br/>
TONS easier and more peaceful no matter how old your child is.<br/>

  I&#39;m also thinking about making the drive up, and trying to convince some of my local unschooling group to head up there too. I&#39;m trying to decide between going by myself or talking my family into coming. Dh would not be into it, but I&#39;m wondering how many little children might be attending. Mine are 6, 5 and 3.5, so I&#39;m just not sure that they would get much out of it, you know?  It could be fun to just road trip with some of the other moms here. What would you all suggest?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483406313">Hi Danielle - My kids, who were 6 and 10 last summer, had an amazing<br/>
time at the conference.  They didn&#39;t want to come home.  There were lots<br/>
of kids under six.  The funshops were, well, fun &lt;G&gt;, the pool was<br/>
always full, the kids hung out in each others&#39; rooms, and there was a<br/>
toy room set up as well.  My husband thought it was kind of oxymoronic<br/>
to have a conference about unschooling, but ended up having a good time<br/>
too.  It was a fun family vacation for all of us, and we can&#39;t wait to<br/>
go this year.  ~Rue<br/>

minute decision but only a 5 hour drive for us.  It was a life changing weekend for <br/>
our family from the moment Kelly found us and welcomed us after we registered <br/>
to my 13 year old daughter leaning over to me during one of Sandra&#39;s <br/>
presentations and saying...&quot;I feel like I belong here&quot;<br/>
to our drive home on Sunday night playing with our &quot;thinking sticks&quot;.   That <br/>
weekend is still with me and we are already planning for this year&#39;s trip.  <br/>
We&#39;re in Florida....and Boston is quite a trek but I would find a way to make it <br/>
happen even if it was in Oregon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The kids would have fun, but you&#39;ll get a lot more out of it if you can <br/>
make it without them and not have to be keeping an eye on them. That&#39;s <br/>
what I&#39;d do. Then, later, if there are conferences near you, the kids <br/>
will LOVE to go and make other unschooling friends and the connections <br/>
will mean a lot to them. Even a 6 and 5 yo would make friends this year <br/>
and have a lot of fun- but, still, I&#39;d take the chance to go on my own <br/>
if I still had such young kids. And this is the PERFECT time for you to <br/>
go - when your kids have just entered the school age zone &lt;G&gt;. On the <br/>
other hand - its a great place for husbands to see unschooled kids - <br/>
talk to other husbands, see some speakers, etc. So that&#39;s a <br/>
consideration, too.<br/>

again.  They will get tons out of it.  Tons of fun, tons of friends.  And <br/>
remember this is not a homeschooling conference, it is an unschooling conference. <br/>
Totally different feel, totally different energy.<br/>

<br/>
Well it there is irony in standing up and lecturing about learning in other <br/>
ways than formal and traditional, that&#39;s for SURE! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the advantage of being there is more in the way of a happening than of a <br/>
conference.    The information is not so much in the information presented as <br/>
in the experience of being around so many unschoolers in one place and just to <br/>
see how different everything can be: the elevator, the restaurant, the pool, <br/>
the talent show, the conversations in the hallway... all different.<br/>
<br/>
Not different like a different planet, but everything just a different <br/>
texture and flavor.<br/>

When we went last year, Jayn was 3.5 and she still talks about the hotel<br/>
where she met Heather (Shyrley&#39;s daughter). It is true that I missed a<br/>
couple of sessions, and spent less time just talking in groups than I would<br/>
have without Jayn there. However it was great for her to play and meet<br/>
others also. With my DH, James attending, we did as we always do, and<br/>
switched out who was supervising Jayn. This worked very well. Road tripping<br/>
with Mom&#39;s would probably be fantastic. OTOH I really loved seeing the<br/>
children, as well as the Moms. I say to you find any way of going in any<br/>
combination - some people bring only some of their children, some bring all,<br/>
others none. My DH attended the father&#39;s meeting (in the Sports Bar) and<br/>
apparently there were plenty of questioning dads who were given a lot to<br/>
think about. I don&#39;t know exactly what, since there was a vow of secrecy<br/>
taken.<br/>
