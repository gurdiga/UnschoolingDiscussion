&gt; towards what is best for their religious and political agenda<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just in case anyone was skeptical about the above statement, apparently<br/>
HSLDA has proposed federal legislation, HR 2732/S 1562, the Homeschool<br/>
Non-Discrimination Act. The title sure sounds like it&#39;s working for all of<br/>
us, but if you read at the New Jersey Homeschool Association you&#39;ll see that<br/>
they&#39;re saying what I was saying. I don&#39;t know NJHA&#39;s bias but they&#39;re<br/>
saying this independently of the people here.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Home Education Magazine, the National Home Education Network, and the New<br/>
&gt;&gt; Jersey Homeschool Association, along with scores of other networking and<br/>
&gt;&gt; support groups across the United States, are angry that HSLDA would do this:<br/>
&gt;&gt; introduce legislation with far-reaching consequences and not bother to<br/>
&gt;&gt; warnlet alone consultthe majority of American homeschoolers who don¹t<br/>
&gt;&gt; belong to HSLDA.<br/>

There&#39;s more information about the bill and better links at:<br/>

you click on Newsletter in the menu to the left it will tell you how to<br/>

<br/>
I won&#39;t say this list isn&#39;t the place to discuss this bill but I will point<br/>
out there are much better places, places where people who enjoy politics<br/>
like to hang out:<br/>
<br/>
HEM-Networking (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEM-Networking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">HEM-Networking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>) or<br/>
AHA-PolitcalAction (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AHA-PoliticalAction-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">AHA-PoliticalAction-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also Unschooling-Politics (though I don&#39;t know how active the list<br/>
is)<br/>
