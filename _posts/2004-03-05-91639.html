<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875333448">Quo Vadis is a week-long gathering for people interested in creating <br/>
strong, supportive community for adult unschoolers and self-educators. <br/>
We work to empower those dedicated to lifelong learning by facilitating <br/>
an event that cultivates, sustains, and unites individual <br/>
self-educators and their allies.<br/>
<br/>
Quo Vadis strives to provide younger adults with practical help and <br/>
support; self-educators in general with an opportunity to meet, <br/>
network, and share; and anyone interested, a positive example of <br/>
self-education and cooperation in action - a place where people can <br/>
dream big, work hard, and learn much.<br/>
<br/>
The first week of Quo Vadis was in the late spring of 2001. Forty-two <br/>
autodidacts gathered in the mountains of Oregon for a week of playing <br/>
in the sun, brainstorming, sharing knowledge and ideas, and envisioning <br/>
the future of self-education. Now, with two years under our belts, we <br/>
are diving into the third annual Quo Vadis. This year&#39;s gathering takes <br/>
place June 20th through June 26th at Camp Lane, just outside of Eugene, <br/>
Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a self-educator, autodidact, unschooler, homeschooler, life <br/>
long learner, or an average everyday Joe who thinks this all sounds <br/>
fascinating, we would love to get an application from you! Call <br/>
yourself what you like, but come to Quo Vadis to discuss, practice and <br/>
experience education with others who see it as a lifelong process <br/>
larger than schooling. We are an adult gathering, but we don&#39;t turn <br/>
anyone away on the basis of age alone.<br/>
<br/>
