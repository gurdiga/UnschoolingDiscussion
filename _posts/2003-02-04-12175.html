<div id="ygrps-yiv-682414701"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The moss never dies here!!  Even during nearly 3<br/>
&gt;months of summer heat and lack of rain is just sits<br/>
&gt;in the cracks of the pavement, brown but not dead.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most of the moss here never gets brown at all.  Of<br/>
course, we have a lot of different kinds of moss. <br/>
Leafy, lettucy moss; long, hairy moss; fluffy fuzzy <br/>
moss;  light, dark, or in between moss.  That&#39;s just<br/>
what grows on the trees.  On the rocks and on the<br/>
ground there is moss with tiny blossoms, springy moss,<br/>
spongy moss, and clover-like moss.  Sometimes the moss<br/>
on the ground gets brown when it is in the full sun<br/>
all summer, but not if it is in the woods, or in the<br/>
shade.<br/>
