<div id="ygrps-yiv-104939955">***The duration of captivity seems to continue into adulthood for some<br/>
people.<br/>
I wonder what makes the difference in those of us who reject school?***<br/>
<br/>
I have wondered this.<br/>
I watch my son go about his day and he is such a different kind of child<br/>
than I was or his dad was.  He&#39;s sure he has rights and is not afraid to<br/>
stand up and demand them.  He thinks about the world in way&#39;s none of my<br/>
friends did when I was ten.  There is something so completely different<br/>
about him.  <br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t remember much about school.  I can&#39;t recall teachers<br/>
names until the fourth grade and some (most) after that are missing.  I<br/>
left school at the end of my freshman year and my mother says my<br/>
accounting teacher, Mr. Johnson came to the house several times  to see<br/>
me but I have no recollection of that.   <br/>
<br/>
I apparently never bonded with my captors.&lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t know the reason. <br/>
I have a friend who suffered in school, suffered to please the teachers<br/>
and get everything just right.  She&#39;s smart and her own children have had<br/>
problems in school and she wouldn&#39;t dream of taking them out.    She was<br/>
so much smarter than I was in school, and so invested in it and she had<br/>
ulcers by the end of high school and she never wanted her kids to go<br/>
through the same thing, but tomorrow she&#39;ll get them out of bed and send<br/>
them and never think about alternatives. <br/>
<br/>
Did we have parents who&#39;d been in war and talked about rights and abuse? <br/>
Did we have older siblings who talked about all the things wrong with<br/>
school?  Were we just never wired for the herd mentality?   Did we all<br/>
ask too many questions there were no good answers for?   <br/>
<br/>
I remember looking at Dylan when he was born and thinking nothing would<br/>
ever be good enough for him.  Maybe when I really thought about school I<br/>
wondered what life could be if we just bypassed all that foolishness.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why some people see school as necessary and others don&#39;t. <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just the willingness to think beyond what we&#39;re told to think.<br/>
  &quot;Why&quot;  and &quot;Why not&quot; are a bigger part of some lives than others.  <br/>
<br/>
A palm reader once told me I was from another planet, maybe that&#39;s it!<br/>
<br/>
Get a government grant Nancy, and do a study and prove once and for all<br/>
that people who reject school are more highly evolved. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I see Holly being analytical about the world in ways we didn&#39;t have <br/>
permission to be when we were her age.  We didn&#39;t have the resources to be.  <br/>
The freedom to be.  We were &quot;too little.&quot;  She&#39;s never had &quot;little&quot; enforced <br/>
on her.  <br/>
<br/>
In the same day (moment!) that she can talk to adults about real things, <br/>
relationships, emotion, motivaton, she can also be doing really little kid <br/>
things.  Dolls, stuffed-animal plays, swinging high enough to make the swing <br/>
legs come up (we didn&#39;t anchor it when we moved from the other house, and <br/>
with just her on it it hasn&#39;t mattered).<br/>
<br/>
She not only doesn&#39;t feel too little, she doesn&#39;t feel too big.  She can <br/>
watch The Green Mile and Elmo&#39;s World in the same day.   TeleTubbies and <br/>
Friends, and not be self-conscious or off balance.<br/>
<br/>
I played school to have fun and do well.  I did both.  I had friends smarter <br/>
than I was who thought doing well wasn&#39;t fun.  So they had fun and did not <br/>
&quot;do well.&quot;  In retrospect I think they were smarter more than one way.  I was <br/>
like a cat doing tricks, and they were like smarter cats who refused to do <br/>
tricks.<br/>

<br/>
At night Dylan chooses a little stuffed animal to sleep with, wraps it<br/>
tenderly in the bundle of quilt and afghan he&#39;s had since he was a baby<br/>
and talks kindly to it.  &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind being wrapped up, I hope<br/>
I don&#39;t squish you, you can squeak if you need something...&quot;  He kisses<br/>
it tenderly and snuggles it down beside him and then, this happened last<br/>
night, he said, &quot;I want to go to the public meeting on the EPA river<br/>

Ok.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

His world is so much bigger than mine was and so much more full of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871236272">I have thought about this topic.  I sort of hang out with a group of<br/>
people who have preschoolers.  Most are sending their kids to<br/>
kindergarten.  I am Homeschooling my 8 year old and 4 year old this<br/>
year.  It is a belief now among some of the moms that I am turning my<br/>
back on society and the public.  All of these moms are middle class.<br/>
They all participate in the PTA.  Their children probably without<br/>
exception are going to be successful in the system.    But there are<br/>
different ways of measuring success.  I believe like John Lennon did,<br/>
that success means that you are enjoying what you are doing with full<br/>
satisfaction, that you are happy with yourself and others.  But a lot of<br/>
society see success as money and material gain equates happiness.<br/>
Probably a third of the kids in public school do not succeed in the<br/>
system.  The have terms and labels put on their heads; troubled,<br/>
learning disabled, ADHD (that is a big one).  These parents are going to<br/>
have fruitful kids, they don&#39;t have problems with status quo beliefs.<br/>
They<br/>

that shirt, and he did and the other boy put it on and was also<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890447951">Thanks for the thoughts on this Nancy. I always enjoy your posts immensely.<br/>
<br/>
Part of what totally convinced me to homeschool was the year Trevor spent in <br/>
Kindergarten....I suppose that is true for many people. But what convinced me <br/>
was not how lousy the school was. I didn&#39;t think he had a bad experience at <br/>
the time, it wasn&#39;t until later that he opened up about all the hurt that <br/>
year caused.<br/>
My &quot;aha&quot; moment was after I had volunteered on the PDC (program delivery <br/>
council) the PTA and in the classroom all year. It just hit me one day that <br/>
if all this immense amount of time and energy I was spending at a school and <br/>
on lots of other kids could be given to just my son, what an amazing thing <br/>
that would be.<br/>
It was in that moment, of realizing I COULD just focus all that energy on <br/>
him, that homeschooling suddenly was very possible and seemed the only option.<br/>
I am writing this in response to the person you answered about how parents <br/>
should volunteer and work in the schools rather than homeschooling.<br/>
What if all those parents spent the time and energy on their own family, <br/>
rather than a screwed up system? Wow, talk about a revolution.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-273033352">Suspensions can be a big problem in some schools. Lots of kids that are<br/>
suspended end up home with no one around to care for them. Many live in<br/>
low-income areas and end up hanging out with gangs and getting into more<br/>
trouble. My mom (a teacher in CA) fights against suspending her kids as she<br/>
knows it&#39;s going to create more problems for the kids. Many of hers are<br/>
better off in school than at home and often beg to stay there -- even thru<br/>
holidays!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490905729">Sorry, I could finish that one.  I think that the more people who guide<br/>
their kids and for many Homeschooling is the answer and for others it is<br/>
not, the better the world will be.  I am beginning to think that<br/>
education in all levels of government is turning into a Enron or World<br/>
dot com and the waste is incredible.  Lsia<br/>

 <br/>
I have thought about this topic.  I sort of hang out with a group of<br/>
people who have preschoolers.  Most are sending their kids to<br/>
kindergarten.  I am Homeschooling my 8 year old and 4 year old this<br/>
year.  It is a belief now among some of the moms that I am turning my<br/>
back on society and the public.  All of these moms are middle class.<br/>
They all participate in the PTA.  Their children probably without<br/>
exception are going to be successful in the system.    But there are<br/>
different ways of measuring success.  I believe like John Lennon did,<br/>
that success means that you are enjoying what you are doing with full<br/>
satisfaction, that you are happy with yourself and others.  But a lot of<br/>
society see success as money and material gain equates happiness.<br/>
Probably a third of the kids in public school do not succeed in the<br/>
system.  The have terms and labels put on their heads; troubled,<br/>
learning disabled, ADHD (that is a big one).  These parents are going to<br/>
have fruitful kids, they don&#39;t have problems with status quo beliefs.<br/>
They<br/>

<br/>
This is something else I&#39;ve noticed lately.  <br/>
Used to be when people asked me about homeshooling there were always the<br/>
questions about education and socialization.  <br/>
Now it seems to have been proven in the minds of a lot of people that<br/>
homeschooling isn&#39;t hurting the children, so a shift has taken place and<br/>
now homeschooling hurts schools and therefor society.  <br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s one interesting thing.  Last night I talked to my friend in<br/>
Arkansas who is just beginning his first year teaching.  There is a<br/>
former homeschooler in his class and his observation was that the boy is<br/>
lacking social skills.  He says he&#39;s shy and not swirling at the center<br/>
of his peers attention.  <br/>
But he commented on another boy whom he really likes, who&#39;s very smart,<br/>
etc, etc, and laughed that this boy tells other kids to shut up and got<br/>
into a little trouble for shoving another kid around.  <br/>
I asked him as gently as I could not to confuse social and anti social,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think he got it.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I guess there are many reasons people have for home schooling <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; children, however, the practice seems to be moving from an <br/>
&gt; occasional<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing to something that threatens the public school system.  There <br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; no question that everybody will not be able or want to home school<br/>
&gt; &gt; their children.  Our country became great and will remain great<br/>
&gt; &gt; because all of the public are educated in the public school <br/>
&gt; system..<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not to have a public school system would result in our living in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; country  with countless uneducated masses.  The public school <br/>
&gt; system<br/>
&gt; &gt; is being left with those parents who are disengaged from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; education of their children while those of us who care about<br/>
&gt; &gt; education are withdrawing our support.  Lots of time and effort <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; put into home schooling... How much better our public school <br/>
&gt; system<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be if you parents would put even a small percentage of that<br/>
&gt; &gt; time into volunteering your help, opinions and concerns with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; public school system.  Just think about that.......<br/>
