    Where exactly? Where you able to get to the Brunch we had in Columbus?<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t remember everyone. There were several new to me people. I&#39;m in<br/>
the northend of Columbus. I&#39;ve been considering starting an unschoolers<br/>
group but don&#39;t what to do it alone. Summers not exactly the best time to<br/>
start a group. Maybe August. We&#39;ll see, I can&#39;t promise anything. ;-)<br/>
    Do you know about the Inches group? There are several open minded people<br/>
that attend that meeting. It&#39;s monday, June 2nd, at the Worthington Library<br/>
at 7pm. It&#39;s inclusive not all unschoolers but the best, IMO, group around.<br/>
If you&#39;re close enough to Columbus try to get there. Ang comes in from<br/>
Pataskala when she can. Several on the UNO list come. I hope that helps and<br/>
I hope to see you there.<br/>

&gt; I forget if you said where you live.  Maybe someone here can help you find<br/>
&gt; one.  If there isn&#39;t one, maybe you could start one.  It only takes 2<br/>
&gt; families to start. Tia****<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t said where I live until now.  I live in Northcentral Ohio.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; joined the Ohio Schoolers Yahoo list.  So far there isn&#39;t anyone really close,<br/>
&gt; like in the town I live in.  I&#39;m considering putting a sign up at the library<br/>
&gt; or someplace like that, but we&#39;re still getting adjusted to the move.  Maybe I<br/>
&gt; should just buy myself some pompoms and jump in with both feet.  LOL<br/>

We just moved to Wooster.  I think Columbus is a solid 1.5 hour drive.  Columbus sounds like homeschooling nirvana to me, compared to Akron (our former residence).  There are a few people on the UNO list who are relatively close to Wooster, but not here in town.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a curriculum fair/used book sale at a church here in town next weekend.  Part of me wants to go to see if I&#39;ll run into anyone unschoolish; part of me figures if I&#39;m going to find unschoolers that won&#39;t be the place!  LOL<br/>

    You&#39;re right, I doubt you&#39;ll find unschoolers at a curr. fair. How about<br/>
posting something, maybe a play date at a park, at the health food store,<br/>
LLL, or library. Try that. I wish you luck. Wish I could help you more.<br/>
