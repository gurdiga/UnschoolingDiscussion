<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313237399">Well, all the feedback on home-ed I&#39;ve had was from my mum, who seems to think that since the &#39;world&#39; (ie society) we live in is competitive, that everyone should be competitive.  Yet she allowed me the freedom as a small child to not go to playgroup or nursery when I didn&#39;t want to go, but couldn&#39;t see that that was a viable option as I was growing up, even though there was a very high-profile case of a local home educated girl gaining a place at Oxford aged 8 or 12 or something nuts.  So I told her what I was trying to do any why, generally speaking regarding the kids&#39; freedom to choose.  Which is OK.  One thing that bugged me was that she used to ask constantly about my neice, dh&#39;s sister&#39;s child, whom I&#39;m ok with but not the world&#39;s expert, you know?  As if her own grandchildren weren&#39;t interesting enough!  (sorry, I&#39;m in rant mode and tired, too!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, yes I bet it&#39;s really tough when they don&#39;t agree with what you&#39;re doing, but that&#39;s part of what I find difficult to understand with my mum.  Is it part of a grandparent&#39;s job description to make the parents&#39; life more difficult?  I&#39;m not blaming her, I know she has her own issues that are still hanging over her head, (the thread on emotional roots of auto-immune disease were very interesting from this p.o.v., anyone got any links on this subject?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to clog up the list with ranting!<br/>

  we live over the stream and through the woods from my in-laws--a definite mixed blessing.  We&#39;ve had to be very clear in setting boundaries, and clear with the kids. We&#39;ve had the kids drilled in what they&#39;re learning, subtle and not-so-subtle sabotaging our homeschooling.Whenever I tell them about something our kids are doing, they always talk about the other grandkids, whom they seldom see and seldom speak to.  But we do the best we can and carry on.<br/>

    hmmm.  I live in the same village as my mum, and the next-but-one village from dh&#39;s parents.  Today, we walked to the library, the park, my mum&#39;s for lunch, the &#39;swings-and-slides,&#39; and home.  The girls are very tired :-)  It&#39;s nice to have this convenience, and when we lived in the next village from here, 3 from the in-laws, I said it was good that we were close enough to visit without having to stay the night :-)  But I still find my mum&#39;s attitudes drive me nuts.  She&#39;s relaxed about some things, house-type stuff, but then she&#39;s drilling my kids in competitiveness, choosing teams when there are game programmes on the telly and putting down whoever chose the losing team, can you credit?  She doesn&#39;t mind that my kids don&#39;t ask or say please, but then she acts like a martyr while she&#39;s doing stuff.  She laughs when I try to tell them what I expect, and she tells me things I don&#39;t need them to hear, while they are there, like how they behaved, or whether they used the toilet!  This seems linked with the thread on balance to me, the trust and understanding are there with her, but not the authority, or so it seems to me.  It&#39;s really frustrating, but I can&#39;t find the words to tell her, and I don&#39;t want to while the girls are there, and we never seem to see each other when they are not.  <br/>

    Moving isn&#39;t an option for us, we have a successful business with a lot of local clients, and we just moved last year anyhow.  This situation is nothing like being under threat of court orders, The best of luck with that, and if you can&#39;t move out of the state, I&#39;d move as far as possible inside the state :-)<br/>

      &gt;....i highly recommend, if your family is not supportive, creating large<br/>
      and inconvenient distances, even if it&#39;s &gt;to the farthest corner of the<br/>
      state you live in, because it seems that out of site out of mind has some<br/>
      truth to &gt;it.  jmo. <br/>
<br/>
      best of luck, <br/>

      I totally agree.  This is absolutely true.  We are so much happier living<br/>
      two states away from my family.  It is close enough that the Grandparents<br/>
      can visit a couple of times a year when the weather is good for driving,<br/>
      but far enough that they are not all preoccupied with every little aspect<br/>
      of our lives and are not coming over all the time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hi,<br/>
<br/>
i would recommend that you read no contest: the case against<br/>
competition  by alfie kohn.  here&#39;s a quote from the jacket:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;contrary to the myths with which we have been raised,  kohn shows that<br/>
competition is not an inevitable part of human nature.  it does not<br/>
motivate us to do our best (in fact,  our workplace and schools are in<br/>
trouble because they value  competitiveness instead of excellence).<br/>
rather than building character, competition sabotages and ruins<br/>
relationships.   it even warps recreation by turning the playing field<br/>
into a battle field.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
i have not gotten to this book, it&#39;s still waiting on the shelf along<br/>
with many others:) but i did read punished by rewards:  the trouble with<br/>
gold stars, incentive plans, a&#39;s, praise, and other bribes by the same<br/>
author and it really helped hone  my understanding and knowledge of the<br/>
subject and clarified what i already felt to be true.<br/>
<br/>
many years ago i met this man, who was born and raised in thailand, and<br/>
he told me that when they catch crabs they never needed to put a lid on<br/>
the baskets because the crabs on the bottom always kept the ones on top<br/>
from escaping by just pulling them back down.  ever since i heard this<br/>
story i use it as a metaphor for all those fearful people who try to<br/>
undermine my basic beliefs.   i found 2 things that really help keep me<br/>
from loosing my center, it you will:<br/>
<br/>
one: be happy and sure footed - it&#39;s like a natural immunity &lt;g&gt;- at<br/>
first the person, who is trying to knock you off course or sway you to<br/>
their conviction,  may become more aggressive but if you hold fast they<br/>
eventually will go away. (this has been my 1st hand experience on many<br/>
occasions:)<br/>
two:  gain knowledge and solidify your beliefs. i have found that many<br/>
people - particularly those who try and interfere in another&#39;s life -<br/>
often have but a superficial knowledge of the stance they are pushing.<br/>
so if you can back up your beliefs and develop a strong base and<br/>
understand why you believe what you believe they will generally leave<br/>
you alone.<br/>
<br/>
 Is it part of a grandparent&#39;s job description to make the parents&#39; life<br/>
more difficult?<br/>
<br/>
i honestly don&#39;t think it has to be this way and i hope, if and when, i<br/>
become a mother in law and/or grandparent i will not push myself or my<br/>
beliefs onto the kids and grand kids.  why is it so hard for some people<br/>
to be supportive especially when the other person&#39;s beliefs are<br/>
different than their own?  if someone is happy or moving toward<br/>
happiness more power to them even if the way they get there looks<br/>
different from my own way.  if someone is disregarding your choices and<br/>
undermining your authority i would have to touch upon what i brought up<br/>
in the &#39;keeping balance&#39; thread : balance within yourself trust,<br/>
understanding and authority:  trust in your choices, understand why you<br/>
believe what you believe and take authority over your life (set up<br/>
boundaries)  and don&#39;t hand it over to you mum just because she steals<br/>
every time you turn around.  this would be an excellent &#39;role modeling&#39;<br/>
of what the true freedoms of adulthood is about.  i am in this process<br/>
myself now and feel there is no greater gift to give your kids.  and the<br/>
add bonus is that you&#39;ve taken a very frustrating situation and turned<br/>
it around.  you will find some happiness and all that energy that was<br/>
being drained away by this situation will be there to use for other<br/>
things.  jmo.<br/>
