<div id="ygrps-yiv-500414136">All the discussions regarding allowances, spending, etc. has been <br/>
very interesting, and very reminiscent of all the things we went <br/>
through before settling in on what I believe will be a more-or-less <br/>
permanent solution.  (one can hope ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read *all* the responses....just don&#39;t have the time....so <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this particular concept has been discussed or not.  <br/>
But for what it&#39;s worth...<br/>
<br/>
We figured out, over a period of time, approximately how much we <br/>
were spending on our child&#39;s wants....toys, video games and <br/>
equipment, special snacks, etc.  It turned out to be quite a hefty <br/>
chunk of money!<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of fretting over every expenditure, whether or not we <br/>
were really spending *too* much on him, and not giving him a good <br/>
experience as far as the value of money, etc., we decided to give <br/>
him a rather large allowance, since we were spending that much <br/>
anyway, and let him learn by experience how to budget his money.<br/>
<br/>
At first, it was kind of awful, because the money went right through <br/>
his fingers, and it was gone when he wanted something later in the <br/>
week, and he was used to us buying whatever he needed.<br/>
<br/>
But with consistency, he learned to be patient and wait for &#39;payday&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
But then there came a time when he *had* to have &#39;EyeToy&#39; (a <br/>
wonderful interactive video game than engages the entire body!)  And <br/>
since we (the &#39;bank&#39;) thought that would be a really good <br/>
expenditure, we &#39;loaned&#39; him the money, wrote up a contract where he <br/>
could pay back a certain amount each week.  But one of the <br/>
stipulations of the contract was that he would also put aside a <br/>
certain amount each week into &#39;savings&#39;, in case he ran up against <br/>
this same problem in the future and needed something his budget <br/>
couldn&#39;t handle.<br/>
<br/>
We all sat down together with the contract I had written, and <br/>
discussed what it all means, and showed him what all the different <br/>
columns in the ledger I had made were for, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I watched as he literally sort of &#39;puffed up&#39; with pride....that he <br/>
has some power in all of this, and that he has decisions to make, <br/>
and that his decisions will be respected, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We all signed and dated the contract, after making sure everyone <br/>
understood what it all meant.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting thing has happened since we began this almost two <br/>
months ago.  He has become *very* generous.  He wants to spend some <br/>
of his money on mom and dad.  <br/>
<br/>
At first, I had a problem with this, because I didn&#39;t want him <br/>
spending his money on us.  But after some thought, I graciously <br/>
accepted his gifts to me with much pleasure, knowing that generosity <br/>
is also a very valuable life lesson.  Learning to &#39;budget&#39; our <br/>
generosity is something that has to be considered.  We can become <br/>
generous to a fault, which can also get us into a lot of trouble.<br/>
<br/>
This began to lead into discussions of other areas of generosity.  <br/>
Generosity of time spent together, generosity of affections, and so <br/>
much more. <br/>
<br/>
It just seems that once we got the &#39;money monster&#39; (speaking of <br/>
the &#39;monster&#39; of money management ;o) under control, our lives have <br/>
become so much more pleasant!</div>
