<div id="ygrps-yiv-497140314">I know, I know, I should wait a week before posting, but I&#39;ve read <br/>
all of the previous debate on Ritalin... (can I get a waiver? :)<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sharon, and I&#39;ve worked for over two years as a <br/>
houseparent for boys with &quot;behavioral disabilities&quot; (covers the <br/>
gamut from ADD/ADHD to schizophrenia and autism).  I&#39;m currently <br/>
studying substance abuse in college, and pyschology is one of my <br/>
major fascinations.<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve seen, read and researched, ADD/ADHD *is* a real <br/>
disease -- but it doesn&#39;t affect nearly the population that is <br/>
currently believed.  Recent research at Duke University suggests <br/>
that perhaps ADD is caused by low serotonin levels in the brain (not <br/>
dopamine, as previously thought). (<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Beyond your mood, serotonin helps control the flow of thoughts and <br/>
information in your brain, a little like a a cop directing traffic <br/>
at a busy intersection. When the serotonin system is strong and <br/>
active, thoughts flow in a fairly orderly, coherent manner. If <br/>
serotonin levels greatly drop, thoughts become more scattered and <br/>
unfocussed. Memory and concentration begin to suffer. Many a person <br/>
under severe stress knows this feeling of &#39;thoughts racing through <br/>
your head, out of control&#39;.&quot; (from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thedea.org/yourbrain.html)">http://thedea.org/yourbrain.html)</a>  (Does this sound familiar?)<br/>
<br/>
The danger of using Ritalin to medicate ADD is that, yes, it raises <br/>
the serotonin levels, but it also raises dopamine levels.  *That&#39;s* <br/>
the main effect of a stimulant, the &quot;buzz&quot; that everybody knows.  <br/>
This is why Ritalin abuse is so prevalent in middle- and high-<br/>
schools: It gives a high very similar to cocaine when snorted.<br/>
<br/>
Consequently, long-term Ritalin use has shown similar side-effects <br/>
as long-term cocaine use.  In &#39;small&#39; doses, though, researchers <br/>
hope that ritalin usage won&#39;t become overly addicting.  (Liverpool, <br/>
England, has been experimenting with giving low doses of heroin to <br/>
long term addicts -- so they can maintain living without withdrawal, <br/>
but the dosage *isn&#39;t enough to get high.*  It&#39;s sort of the same <br/>
idea, and it often works.)<br/>
<br/>
Some people with ADD without Ritalin end up self-medicating (as <br/>
someone mentioned) to make up for their serotonin level deficiency.  <br/>
They end up on cocaine or meth.  The studies that show Ritalin users <br/>
more likely to end up abusing these two drugs aren&#39;t much good: it&#39;s <br/>
correlational research.  The fact is that people with ADD/ADHD are <br/>
more likely to abuse these drugs.  Just because many of them are <br/>
currently on Ritalin doesn&#39;t mean that Ritalin leads into coke <br/>
addiction.  Those people are missing some chemical in their brains, <br/>
and they do what they can to make up for it.<br/>
<br/>
The moral of the story: some people REALLY have ADD/ADHD.  They&#39;re <br/>
not just seven-year-old boys who have been asked to sit too long at <br/>
a desk and read &quot;Spot Runs.&quot;  For some of them, Ritalin may be the <br/>
best current choice, but it does have bad side effects.  Other, <br/>
better drugs are coming as understanding grows.  The choice is then <br/>
left to the parents and the kids: wait for those better drugs, or <br/>
work with what we currently have?<br/>

something wrong with them. That they aren&#39;t functioning &quot;up to <br/>
standards.&quot; It seems that the more people with these low serotonin <br/>
levels are made to conform and work/learn in a certain way, the more <br/>
symptoms there are. No? Maybe the answer must also address the <br/>
underlying social causes as well as the chemical imbalances in the <br/>
brain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915458767">Speaking as someone with ADD, I know it exists.<br/>
However, it wouldn&#39;t be considered half the problem<br/>
that it is if it wasn&#39;t for societal mores and<br/>
constraints...public education being one of the worst<br/>
situations for those with ADD.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t look at it as a disability or anything, it<br/>
is simply the way I am; I&#39;m not MEANT to be a quiet<br/>
desk job detail oriented person. It&#39;s not even what is<br/>
most important in life.<br/>

Perhaps a better choice for unschoolers is to work WITHOUT the drugs and help <br/>
the kids figure out ways to function with the biochemistry they have.<br/>
