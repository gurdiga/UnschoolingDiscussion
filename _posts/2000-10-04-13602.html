<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458599477">Hello all!  I was wondering if any of you (actually your children) get <br/>
magazine subscriptions and if so, which are your favorite.  <br/>
<br/>
My nieces are Christian homeschoolers ages 5 and 7 and I would love to get <br/>
each of them their own magazine subscription but there are sooo many  to <br/>
choose from.<br/>
<br/>
I always get good info. from this group and would love to hear any Do&#39;s or Do <br/>
Not&#39;s!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589946114">We subscribe to American Girl, Kids Discover, National Geographic World, and<br/>
Muse.  I think a 5 and 7 yo girl would enjoy American Girl and Nat&#39;l Geo<br/>
World most.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250606060">We are getting a sample of Highlights new Puzzle magazine. My kids love those.<br/>
Ladybug/Cricket are nice, but very expensive.  I have a stack of old <br/>
Highlights<br/>
in the garage I haven&#39;t even brought out yet, but remember liking them as a <br/>
kid.<br/>
Also have a bunch of Ranger Rick and My Big Backyard stashed away also. We<br/>
really haven&#39;t gotten into them yet either.<br/>

Stay as far away as possible from the Disney magazines. I am not anti-Disney <br/>
at all, but the children&#39;s magazines are awful. My daughter had a <br/>
subscription and I couldn&#39;t wait for it to expire. The magazine is basically <br/>
a promotional vehicle for the Disney related TV shows, movies, and pop <br/>
groups. It is filled with advertisements for expensive toys as well.<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked at Cricket and the other magazines published by the same <br/>
company? No advertisements and lots of fun stories and poems. National <br/>
Geographic also makes a nice magazine for the younger set.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-134207655">We just started getting a new magazine called Explore.<br/>
 It&#39;s kind of expensive, but I really like it, because<br/>
it doesn&#39;t have all the ads, plus some of the articles<br/>
are a little meatier than I usually see in kid&#39;s<br/>
magazines.<br/>
You can check it out at www.exploremagazine.com<br/>
