<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097453973">Man, wander off for a water balloon fight and some sidewalk art and WHAM,<br/>
four hundred messages about Fundamentalist Christians AND spanking.<br/>
<br/>
***What exactly is it that is hurting the &quot;other&quot; unschoolers or the<br/>
children?  ***<br/>
<br/>
First, you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a Fundamentalist unschooler.  <br/>
There&#39;s a lot of writing on the web, and I think someone even posted a<br/>
link explaining why unschooling goes against God.<br/>
<br/>
So how do they hurt homeschooling?   They&#39;ll tell you they&#39;re working for<br/>
homeschooling freedoms and have devised a huge scare campaign about how<br/>
the government wants to take away their rights.   They want to comply<br/>
with the law so perfectly no one suspects what&#39;s going on in their homes.<br/>
   They&#39;ve actively worked in some areas to require annual testing for<br/>
homeschoolers as long as the testing in NO way suggests they&#39;d have to<br/>
teach to the standard in Science and History. <br/>
<br/>
Worse, something no one has talked about, as far as I could tell, the<br/>
kids in these homes are eventually going to talk about what<br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; is like.    They are eventually going to be adults and<br/>
not all of them will stay on the path their parents have so brutally set<br/>
before them.   When they come forward about the kind of home life they<br/>
had, it&#39;s going to raise questions about the well being and safety of<br/>
kids kept home, and with good reason.   There have already been a few<br/>
ugly glimpses of what&#39;s going on in these kinds of families.<br/>
<br/>
How does it hurt children?<br/>
Happily in the backs of Christian homeschooling magazines they advertise<br/>
&quot;The Rod&quot;, a weapon for use against children.   The logo is a smiley face<br/>
and they proudly state, &quot;cushioned grip for comfort!&quot;   I don&#39;t know<br/>
about you, but I&#39;m sure relieved the user will feel no discomfort while<br/>
whipping their child.<br/>
You can find articles on the web about how to choose the best whipping<br/>
tools in plumbing and hardware stores, when to start whipping and for<br/>
what reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
They tell their kids there are demons who want to get them and they&#39;re<br/>
everywhere.   They&#39;re on fruit juice labels, in toys, on the TV, in the<br/>
little boy next door and in the necklace their little girl liked at the<br/>
store. <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t take their kids to doctors because they&#39;re afraid of the<br/>
questions that will be asked.<br/>
In Wyoming last year they pushed for and passed a bill which says it&#39;s ok<br/>
for parents to bruise their children.<br/>
<br/>
They think they will choose who their daughters will marry.   <br/>
<br/>
They spank little boys for touching themselves and make them pray to not<br/>
be so bad and dirty.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure physical, mental and emotional abuse is harmful to<br/>
children.   I don&#39;t understand why anyone would spend one minute<br/>
defending this type of thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I usually just read everything and lurk in corners but I have to agree with <br/>
the no spanking thread.  Spanking is control, pure and simple.  It&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
bigger and stronger than you and I can make you do whatever I want&quot;. <br/>
If we hit an adult it&#39;s a punishable offense, people who beat animals are <br/>
jailed, hitting a child is somehow excusable?  I don&#39;t think so!<br/>
 <br/>
Hitting teaches the child that physical force is ok.  How will you deal with <br/>
your child when he hits another over a toy?  YOU&#39;VE taught him that behavior. <br/>
 How do you exlain to him that hitting is ok for you but if HE does it HE&#39;LL <br/>
get hit because it&#39;s unacceptable for him!<br/>
<br/>
Everytime you resort to hitting you diminish the very essence of who your <br/>
child is.  Our children are not animals that need to be trained.  Any parent <br/>
who expects or demands complete obedience and uses spanking to attain that <br/>
obedience needs to get a handle on their OWN emotions and feelings.<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re very derisive of some of the things children are supposed to be <br/>
learning, and they are the living proof of some of the fears of the <br/>
detractors of homeschooling.  They DO want to isolate their children and give <br/>
them a skewed version of life.  There are scads of Christian books, <br/>
biographies written from a Christian point of view (no huge foul there), <br/>
science books written to support the Bible (starts to get questionable, in my <br/>
mind), history books with just flat out falsehood and with a framework of the <br/>
future written in which isn&#39;t supported by writings of the time, but just by <br/>
the time-travel wishes of the authors.  There is at least one Christian piano <br/>
lessons course, and for a while there were advertisements for a Christian <br/>
Bible.  And by Christian, I mean fundamentalist Christian.  I saw some of the <br/>
definitions in a review once, and I REALLY wish I had bought one.  &quot;Saved&quot; <br/>
was defined the regular ways AND as being born again.  Various things were <br/>
defined straight up as &quot;a sin against God in which...&quot; and that way.  Other <br/>
religions were defined in the worst possible light.   It was a dictionary for <br/>
fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers to use which would keep them from <br/>
being exposed to other people&#39;s definitions of words.<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
<br/>
Cultural awareness and political correctness are hooted down HARD by the <br/>
Christian Homescooling movement.  They don&#39;t want to teach their children <br/>
compassion and acceptance of other cultures.  Not even compassion and <br/>
awareness of other religious denominations.<br/>
<br/>
And health and sex ed?  FORGET it.  Many of them define flirting and dating <br/>
right up there with adultery, and only allow arranged marriages or *maybe* <br/>
courtship.<br/>
<br/>
One curriculum has separate tracks for girls and boys, so that the girls are <br/>
not even given the same Christian Education the boys are, but are taught to <br/>
be Christian wives and mothers, to be good wives of boys whose education is <br/>
superior to theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what people against homeschooling think is going on with <br/>
homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
If they say it is happening, they will be telling the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Those kids are taught to fear other information as coming from Satan, so how <br/>
will they be rescued from that subgroup?  And it is NOT a small group.   <br/>
<br/>
They teach their kids to laugh at science and make fun of it.  They teach <br/>
them that science is just another religion, with no basis but that Satan is <br/>
trying to tempt good Christians (them) to doubt God&#39;s word.   If fossils seem <br/>
older than 6000 years, that&#39;s because Satan MADE them seem older.  (Or <br/>
there&#39;s another theory, that God set that out as a test, and good Christians <br/>
will know not to go there.)<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make me want to send my kids to school, but it does make me feel <br/>
pretty resentful when people hear we&#39;re homeschooling and a vision of those <br/>
isolationist liars comes to their minds and I have to defend myself, again.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They spank little boys for touching themselves and make them pray to not<br/>
be so bad and dirty.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m pretty sure physical, mental and emotional abuse is harmful to<br/>
children.   I don&#39;t understand why anyone would spend one minute<br/>
defending this type of thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And many have guns, and have told their children the godless heathens &quot;out <br/>
there&quot; are lying in wait to get them.   That&#39;s more minor, but will <br/>
eventually play out at that edge where young men start to doubt what they <br/>
were told, but have nothing yet to replace it with.<br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been a lot of years since my parents have set foot in a church, but<br/>
my dad still makes fun of science.  When I was a kid, he told me that<br/>
dinosaurs never existed and that scientists made them up by putting<br/>
pigs&#39; bones together.  He said carbon dating is completely invalid and<br/>
that it dates things which are alive as being millions of years old.  He<br/>
also doesn&#39;t believe there is any danger to the environment.  Really.<br/>
He thinks it&#39;s all a bunch of liberal crap from people who want him to<br/>
stop driving his minivan and eating beef.  Everytime I see him, he&#39;s<br/>
making a comment about some idiot environmentalist he&#39;s heard on NPR and<br/>
how ridiculous their theories are.  He might not still attend church,<br/>
but he still believes the earth is only six thousand years old and that<br/>
humans have the God-given right to do whatever they want to it, and that<br/>
Jesus is going to swoop down at any minute and make it all better.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;True story. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pat Farenga of Growing Without Schooling spoke at a state homeschooling <br/>
convention in North Carolina.  I hope I&#39;m telling this just right.  It was at <br/>
least four years ago.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, a thousand out of two thousand (half of a huge lecture hall) <br/>
people walked out on him when he said it was crucial in unschooling for <br/>
children to be able to say they weren&#39;t interested in something right at that <br/>
moment.   (I don&#39;t have the quote, but it was about kids needing to able to <br/>
say no.)<br/>
<br/>
And when he was unloading books from John Holt&#39;s Book and Music (before they <br/>
sold their stuff to FUN Books) at the vendor&#39;s table which was part of his <br/>
compensation for speaking, one of the conference organizers came by, and some <br/>
books were picked back up and put back in his box.  I wish I could remember <br/>
the titles, but I think there were two (maybe three) and they had to do with <br/>
the rights of children, children as whole people, like that.   He wasn&#39;t <br/>
allowed to display or sell them.<br/>
<br/>
Although it wasn&#39;t advertised as a Christian conference, but as a state <br/>
homeschooling conference, it was entirely run and dictated by Christian <br/>
leadership.   <br/>
<br/>
Pat was being treated like a boy himself!  Not an unschooled boy, but a bad <br/>
Christian boy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040996990">Bravo!! I know that when it hits the pocketbook - it can hurt!! We&#39;ve been asked to give talks about American Indian history, however, it has to be from a Christian viewpoint - that the millions that died, the enslavements; the genocide was all worth it because the Europeans brought Jesus. I simply tell those groups that I will not change history to suit them.

many skirts and long hair and not a stitch of make-up.. That is usually how <br/>
you can easily identify the strong fundamentalist Christian women around <br/>
here.  They look like they walked off the Mayflower.    <br/>
<br/>
Anna had  friend who was a in a fundy family.   As soon as the girl got away <br/>
from her mother ( like a sleepover or play date at a friends house) the first <br/>
thing she done was to change out of her long skirt into some borrowed clothes <br/>
from her friends..   Her hair was so long and straggly.. split ends and dried <br/>
out.   Every time Anna got a hair cut, this girl would beg her not to.. beg <br/>
her to grow it out.  It made Anna feel bad because her friend just wanted <br/>
someone to be like her.. But, Anna still got her hair cut.   One time this <br/>
girl got in trouble at school ( she had a TERRIBLE temper).. and she cried <br/>
and told her friends that she would probably have to get baptized again <br/>
because she had sinned so badly.<br/>
<br/>
  The little girl loved to come to our house.. She would often tell Anna how <br/>
beautful she thought I was.. LOL. Yeah, right, I am 5&#39;3&quot; tall and weigh 250 <br/>
pounds.. But, I style my hair if I want to, I wear make-up if I want to, and <br/>
I might get dressed up in a short skirt, hose and heels.  Her mother is a <br/>
lovely 5&#39;1&quot; and barely weighs 100 pounds.. She is naturally very beautiful <br/>
with long ( of course) black hair and shining brown eyes and a wonderful <br/>
smile.  But you wont see her with anything more than a ponytail for a <br/>
&quot;hairstyle&quot;  NO make-up, and no hemline above her knees. She downplays her <br/>
beauty, even tries to hide it. And, she &quot;trains&quot; her daughter to do the same. <br/>
  Funny thing, when her daughter gets the chance, she puts on the most racy <br/>
outfits she can find and flirts with the boys like mad.. Imagine that :-)<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, I know all about fundamentalists.  I KNOW them.  I know that the mother <br/>
of this family beat her 15 year old son with a belt buckle and she broke all <br/>
of his collectibles because he was &quot;idolizing&quot; them. Yes, its horrible.  But, <br/>
its not a true depiction of Christians in general.<br/>

But we are trying to change it Pam with HA-NC, but we need all the help that people like you, and others who are tired of all that, can give us. Thoughts, ideas, some free time ect...<br/>
<br/>
HA-NC is promoting diversity and knowledge for it&#39;s members much like NHEN is. We don&#39;t want to be seen as preferring any one way, so that everyone feels welcome to join. <br/>
<br/>
But just know there are a couple of unschoolers on the board {I am 1}. So we are very happy to include unschooling as part of knowledge we want to pass along, and welcome all religious beliefs or lack there of.<br/>
