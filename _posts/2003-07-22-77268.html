<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; .  I knew a couple of kids growing up that professionally <br/>
&gt; modeled and were in commercials.  None of them went to a modeling school but <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; instead took ballet or some sort of dance class to help with poise, grace, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; posture.  A couple also took acting classes and were in drama at school.  <br/>
&gt; They <br/>
&gt; were told often as kids how photogenic they were and that they should model, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so their parents spent a hefty amount of money getting pictures done by a <br/>
&gt; photographer that KNOWS what he&#39;s doing (you&#39;d need to find one that knows <br/>
&gt; how to <br/>
&gt; put a portfolio together and has done it for a while) and they sent one or 2 <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; pages of photos to real agencies and just waited. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cameron was told this OFTEN as well. We briefly looked into modelling when he <br/>
was 13. The schools won&#39;t accept BOYS over the age of five! Go figure!<br/>
<br/>
But we have several friends in advertising. They said to get a great <br/>
photographer---put your several hundred dollars into HIS work---and then just send the <br/>
portfolio to every ad agency in the state. The ad agencies prefer to work <br/>
with individuals because they are (generally) less pushy than the modelling <br/>
agencies/schools AND because the agencies/schools charge more (they need their <br/>
percentage too). Plus, that they LIKE homeschoolers because most shoots don&#39;t <br/>
happen after three or on weekends! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Barbizon will take boys any age.  My daughter is a model for them.  Some <br/>
parts are good, some are not so good, like with everything in life that is outside <br/>
our doors.<br/>
<br/>
I know they have places on the East Coast, I&#39;m not sure if they are <br/>
nationwide but I would expect so.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck, it IS a lot of work but if your child loves it, you will not <br/>
mind at all.  All the driving and schlepping is worth it when you see how happy <br/>
it makes them.<br/>
