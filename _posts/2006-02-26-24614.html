&gt; I was into the fourth line of what you wrote below before I knew it  <br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t building up to &quot;But this time you&#39;ve gone too far; you suck!&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was relieved. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***LOL! OMG I would never write to someone I don&#39;t even know...&quot;YOU <br/>
SUCK!&quot;..... even if I thought so. :o) but I might say something like..... Gee, you&#39;re a <br/>
reeeeal pain in the ........  no, just kidding I wouldn&#39;t even say that <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
 I always enjoy everything you write. I do get many chuckles and I appreciate <br/>
that in a person. I sometimes will forward things to my dh so he can be <br/>
enlightened also. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
The &quot;Fallacies&quot; page is a funny one. We are sort of new to unschooling, heck, <br/>
we&#39;re new to hs&#39;ing too. I can&#39;t believe how far we have come though. I am <br/>
soooo happy to see our dd&#39;s start to relax and enjoy all that life has to offer <br/>
them. It&#39;s amazing how much happier our life has become. Not that it was real <br/>
bad or anything, it&#39;s just better than ever! So much more peaceful! Our oldest <br/>
used have acne all the time and she was only 11. We pulled them out of ps a <br/>
little over a year ago, she&#39;s 12 now. A few months ago she said &quot;Hey Mom! I <br/>
don&#39;t really have acne any more! I&#39;ve been noticing it since I left school! Man I <br/>
LOVE this unschooling stuff!&quot; Ahhhh..... no more forced learning, degrading <br/>
teachers, bullies, grades, begging to get a drink of water or simply go to the <br/>
bathroom etc.!<br/>
<br/>
 From, another fan of &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; &lt;BG!&gt; My dh and I rented that on our <br/>
first date 18 yrs ago:o) Our daughters are getting the accent down pretty good <br/>
these days, they take after their Dad sooo much. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
