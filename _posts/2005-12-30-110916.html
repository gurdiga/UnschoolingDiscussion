Subject: Couple mommy  questions....<br/>
&lt;&lt;For the last few weeks, Conner (12 months old) has been  so incredibly <br/>
clingy<br/>
that if I am not holding him or sitting on the floor  with him he screams. I<br/>
can&#39;t get anything done. Also, if one of the other  boys sits in my lap he<br/>
screams and tears and pulls their hair and skin until  they get up. I cannot<br/>
even read a book sitting by him or he will scream and  climb on me until I<br/>
put it down.  Even if one of the other boys touches  one of his toys he<br/>
screams bloody murder until they stop touching it.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

I  would say at 12mo it&#39;s just a stage OR he&#39;s not feeling well. Sorta <br/>
learning his  place OR he may be ill like it seems half the country was over the <br/>
holiday. If  you do happen to speak to the other boys about being careful near <br/>
the baby try  to do it so the baby doesn&#39;t pick up the signals. <br/>
He&#39;s only 12 months and he  is still an infant. Maybe he is teething or has <br/>
gas. I have a 22 mo old BF&#39;ing  lil guy who has been doing the same and I&quot;know&quot; <br/>
he is sick bc he sleeps next to  me. One night he ran a nasty fever but since <br/>
then he has been gassy ,clingy and  grumpy.<br/>
I would try to work through it with him and explain to your other  boys that <br/>
he is not feeling well or needs mommy right now. Which ever you feel  it is...<br/>

&lt;&lt;Conner  will NOT use a sippy cup, straw cup or anything else. We have tried<br/>
several  different brands. I don&#39;t want to take his bottle away, but I would<br/>
like him  to use a cup during awake times. Suggestions? I do eventually want<br/>
to wean  him off his bottle, but I have to get him to take a cup first! He<br/>
simply  won&#39;t do it and I don&#39;t want to force him or anything.  I guess I  was<br/>
just hoping he would want to use a cup.Kim  Flowers&gt;&gt;<br/>

After 4 kids I learned its best to wait until the child is  ready. Pushing <br/>
stuff can actually suppress and delay. You say you have older  boys. I suspect <br/>
they are using sippys. If so then all you need to do is wait.  Your lil 12 mo <br/>
old with begin to want their cups and when he does that is your  cue. Like <br/>
unschooling waiting for your cue goes further than keeping up with  June Cleaver <br/>
at the playground or toddler group. People like that won&#39;t be  unschooling so <br/>
you may want to look around now. Maybe I am wrong maybe you  pediatrician <br/>
suggested it. Ignore it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3 yr old who still loves  his bottle. Honestly I think it&#39;s bc I <br/>
stopped BF&#39;ing too soon. I thought he  wanted to stop but I have learned with my <br/>
4th that there are certain weeks that  Bf&#39;ing slows I took that as weaning. <br/>
Darn.... There is a need and clinging to  you is getting him through it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I wonder what meds caused you to  stop BF&#39;ing. I know it&#39;s not for <br/>
this list but I&#39;ll just say this in the event  you have another. There are many <br/>
options to stopping BF&#39;ing for meds. I was told  countless times to stop <br/>
BF&#39;ing to take BP meds and cholesterol lowering drugs.  No one told me that BF&#39;ing <br/>
and diet changes was just as good if not better  overall for myself and my <br/>
baby.<br/>
I can&#39;t think of a group that I can  suggest other than a pregnancy group <br/>
that supports a parents choice to continue  a bottle after 12 months. Many are <br/>
mainstream and welcoming to all.    <br/>
You can look at it this way... The longer your child is on the baba the more  <br/>
milk he will get. So you know... sippy cups are just as damaging (actually <br/>
more)  to the teeth. Resting teeth on a nipple is better for the teeth than on a <br/>
 plastic cup. Look at the cups you&#39;ll see the teeth  marks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899216613">Kim - I know Sandra has already brought this up, but I really think you need to have this kid looked at by your family doctor.  Take your baby in and tell your doc that this is not normal for this kid.  Something is up!   And he needs to be seen by someone who is going to check him over top to bottom.   Any decent doctor is going to take that very seriously.<br/>
    I can even relate a similar episode when my ds was a toddler.  He started pitching a fit when his little Thomas the Tank Engine tapes would end.   Strange to get so wound up over something so trivial--all ya have to do is put in another one or rewind!   He was even able to do those things himself.  At the time I was a nurse and I remember thinking how nursing home patients would start doing something weird and it would turn out to be a urinary tract infection or something.  So I took him to our family doc and he had pneumonia!!  He hadn&#39;t even coughed!  <br/>
    So...Don&#39;t take it for granted that it isn&#39;t something physical making him so miserable.  He is too young to be able to communicate to you what is wrong.  Besides, he is wreaking havoc with your ability to care for your other boys.  Action is required!   <br/>

&gt; These are things that I haven&#39;t experienced with such extremity before with<br/>
&gt; my other kids.....<br/>
&gt;   I know he isn&#39;t sick or not feeling well.  He<br/>
&gt; is  a completely different baby when he is sick or teething.  I mean this is<br/>
&gt; so incredibly extreme.  The other boys went through clingy stages, but not<br/>
&gt; like this. </span></blockquote></div>
