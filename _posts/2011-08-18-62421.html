<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041188072">I wanted to add a comment about that article and disconnecting while on<br/>
vacation.  I was disappointed when I read it that he didn&#39;t really address<br/>
the main issue, which is that when we are on vacation it can be good to<br/>
disconnect from our daily lives.  It really has nothing to do with the<br/>
technology.  He used technology to enhance his connectedness with his<br/>
family.  However, he missed a rich opportunity to discuss, his temptations<br/>
to check his email while he was looking up stories and history and star<br/>
charts.  Therein lies the rub and he skipped over the difficult part.<br/>
<br/>
This is the part that I struggle with every day ­ not getting sucked into<br/>
the computer to the detriment of interaction with my kids.  As I ponder my<br/>
upcoming vacation, I ponder whether to take my laptop or not ­ can I use<br/>
technology to enhance our time together or will I use it to escape the<br/>
connection with my family.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s subjective, though.  What you think is the main issue, or what can be good, might not have suited his vacation at all.  Some people&#39;s vacations have directly to do with hobbies or conferences or work-related things.  <br/>

<br/>
What about a book?  A cellphone?  Hotel room with a TV? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve kept a computer with me almost all the time, when I&#39;ve been out of town, because that&#39;s the way I talk to my kids, to my husband.  It&#39;s the way I could still sell books even though I was not home where the books were.  Keith and Holly sent them.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to think of it as an all or nothing situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539098342">If you see it as a choice and not &quot;being sucked up&quot; by technology maybe it will help you.<br/>
I can sit here all day if I choose to or I can get up and go connect with my children.<br/>
See it as a choice you make every moment.<br/>
My son is into games and his computer ( youtube  and other stuff) but when we go somewhere fun for him<br/>
he has no trouble letting go of it. He even has an Iphone ( used as an Ipod touch ) that he got for his birthday<br/>
and I have always taken it for him when we go somewhere and he has seldom used it.<br/>
I do love to read on my computer so I have started downloading  books ( are they still called book on tape?) to my Iphone and <br/>
<br/>
I can go all day listening to them and doing stuff like mowing, gardening, cleaning, laundry.<br/>
It really helps me. They are also easy to stop when using the headphones.<br/>
I have taken my laptop to getaways and I do have an Iphone and I find that I  use them  a little and only to check stuff quick.<br/>
|It has always been an asset and never something that stopped me from enjoying  where I was.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it can, although especially when Mo was younger it helped to bring a lot of her &quot;daily life&quot; along when we were travelling, and work in plenty of time for her to do her normal sort of everyday things - like watch as much tv as she wanted. On vacation, she&#39;s more likely to spend most of a day &quot;just&quot; watching tv, as a way to decompress from travelling or visiting. <br/>
