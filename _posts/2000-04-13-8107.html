 </span></blockquote>Every night at bedtime I spend time with each of my kids (3 of &#39;em) <br/>
individually.  The oldest and the youngest go to ps but the middle one is <br/>
homeschooled (this one is 9 yrs old).  Some days he wants me to introduce <br/>
worksheets and school stuff to do and some days he&#39;s done in 5  minutes with <br/>
whatever I suggest.  I try to go with the flow (and it is hard work for me <br/>
sometimes).  The other night we got into the discussion of the other two <br/>
being in school and I don&#39;t remember exactly what was being said but he asked <br/>
me, &quot;Is that how come you don&#39;t teach me anything?&quot;  It kind of floored me.  <br/>
I said he is learning all the time and he just doesn&#39;t know it.  His question <br/>
stayed with me over the days and I kept asking myself &quot;Is he learning?&quot; over <br/>
and over.  Then I realized how much he does.  He is way more comfortable with <br/>
reading than he ever was at school though I don&#39;t think he doesn&#39;t realizes <br/>
it.  He goes to work with my boyfriend out on a route where he helps checks <br/>
things in, how to talk with customers and prices things.   He runs out with <br/>
me on photography road trips (a hobby of mine) and I explain to him the <br/>
beauty I see in simple things and how contrast of colors can be so beautiful. <br/>
 He learns a lot about pet care from cleaning cages, water, feeding and trips <br/>
to the vet.  He&#39;s my little calculator when we go grocery shopping and keep a <br/>
running total to $250.    The other day he became obsessed with recycling <br/>
with a trip to the recycle center which also led to a great discussion on <br/>
&quot;halfs&quot; since he got half of the money for helping me smash cans.  After I <br/>
thought of just these few things I put my mind to rest.  So far when people <br/>
ask what he&#39;s doing home he says, &quot;I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;  but sometimes he seems <br/>
to say it in an embarrassed way I noticed.  I guess I console myself by <br/>
letting go and trusting (thanks my &#39;new age&#39; childhood upbringing) and by <br/>
hoping that as an adult he&#39;ll see how much he&#39;s learned.  I wish I could give <br/>
this one of mine a good dose of self-confidence.  His self-esteem has risen <br/>
greatly since I took him out of ps last Sept but but I wish he believed <br/>
himself more.  I hope with more time here at home, he will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144807346">I look at this from another view point. That my kids never have days off<br/>
because they&#39;re learning all the time. I remember reading in GWS once about<br/>
a mother who realized this when her daughter asked her an astronomy question<br/>
at 9 pm on a July night. She thought to herself &quot;should I wait until 9 am on<br/>
a Tuesday in Oct. to answer this? Of course not&quot; I guess this was her<br/>
lightbulb moment. I remember taking this to heart and think of it in my<br/>
times of doubt.<br/>

&gt;  Anyway, I&#39;d love some feedback on this- what do you tell your children<br/>
&gt;  about your homeschooling methods?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember one time at the grocery store when the checker asked if my dd<br/>
&gt; was in school and she said no we homeschool.  The checker said to dd &quot;oh<br/>
&gt; your mom teaches you?&quot;  and dd said &quot;no my mom doesn&#39;t teach me anything&quot;<br/>
&gt; LOL, talk about a cringing moment.  My children have never been to school,<br/>
&gt; so they don&#39;t know that there  are different hsing methods.  What I<br/>
explained<br/>
&gt; to my children how school was and what they actually did there and then<br/>
&gt; explained to her that we learn from the world around us and from reading<br/>
&gt; books and playiing and doing things, she really picked up on it right<br/>
away.<br/>
&gt; She was almost 5 at the time.  She will now tell you that you don&#39;t have<br/>
to go<br/>
&gt; to school to learn things, but by going places and doing things and<br/>
exploring.<br/>
&gt; Every evening my kids ask me if tomorrow is a day off (meaning are we<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; anywhere, be it fun/park/or just running errands).  Tonight they asked me<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I said yes, tomorrow is but on Sunday we have a fun nature walk planned<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; some of our friends.  They were all excited and wished it were tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; After<br/>
&gt; a moment, my dd asks me&quot;mom, do kids who go to school get a day off on<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; birthdays?&quot;  I said &quot;no they don&#39;t&quot; and you should have seen and heard her<br/>
&gt; expression!!  &quot;They don&#39;t ?!?!  I don&#39;t ever want to go to school!!&quot;  She<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; just incredulous!  She said do they get any days off?  I told her yes they<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; went on to explain that there are 7 days in a week and on Monday when our<br/>
&gt; secretary is here, kids go to school every day for five days including<br/>
Friday<br/>
&gt; when we go to the Farmers Market, but that the next day, tomorrow ,<br/>
Saturday,<br/>
&gt; would be their day off and that they would have two days off together<br/>
before<br/>
&gt; they would go back to school. (I also threw in that they would have to do<br/>
&gt; schoolwork on their days off too &lt;eg&gt;) Oh and when dad comes home from<br/>
&gt; work and says what did you do today, they often say play, but if they<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember, he chimes in for them and says did you play today?!  I guess he<br/>
&gt; sees the value in play and just being a kid too!!<br/>
