<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315290042">I&#39;ve always been basically an un-schooler but with my first I was more worried about not giving him the information he might need. To compromise I insisted that he keep a daily journal and we did the Kumon math program. When he decided he wanted to go to school at 14, grade 9 level, he had no problem. He lasted for 20 credits worth, but now that he has enough friends, he&#39;d rather work for money.<br/>

  Hey all, Jacli here :)<br/>
<br/>
  Okay, here goes my plea for help:   We are both<br/>
  non-religious, I have<br/>
  very strong pagan leanings.  I am a very vehemently<br/>
  inclined UNschooler.<br/>
  My husband is an sweet, but slightly anal retentive<br/>
  overachiever who insists on <br/>
  workbook type curriculum so he can track our dd&#39;s progress.<br/>
  We tried compromising<br/>
  by getting the Life Pac series of workbooks (as recommended<br/>
  by a homeschooling <br/>
  friend in NH).  <br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s killing me.  Every other paragraph lists a scripture<br/>
  and this stuff is so jam packed <br/>
  with dogma even the child is a-moanin!  (For ex. in a<br/>
  chapter on hygiene in the Health<br/>
  book they spent 4 pages examining a chapter in Ephesians<br/>
  that talks about obeying<br/>
  your parents.)<br/>
<br/>
  I hope I have not offended anyone with this but the fact is<br/>
  I&#39;m not looking for bible<br/>
  classes. I would gleefully go back to ordering from<br/>
  Carolina, but dh is also right that<br/>
  the cost is AMAZING.  I just want something that helps her<br/>
  focus on getting the job done, learning<br/>
  about health, provoking discussions and more learning and<br/>
  giving dh the workbook<br/>
  type recording he is looking for. Is this just too tall an<br/>
  order?  <br/>
<br/>
  Any suggestions or thoughts?  Anybody?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks, Jacli<br/>

&gt;Stanley Milgram&#39;s Obedience<br/>
&gt;to Authority, which describes the horrifying &gt;results of experiments used to<br/>
&gt;see how far people will go in obeying, would &gt;help him start to question this<br/>
&gt;goal.<br/>
<br/>
I am soooooooo pleased to see this book referenced.   It made a big impact on me<br/>
years ago.    Some of it was dry reading and I was always amused by their<br/>
assumptions of what would have happened had the &quot;victims&quot; been women or children<br/>
(I  *think* the experiments were indeed run that way later with the horrifying<br/>
conclusion that most were even MORE willing to inflict pain on those),  but I<br/>
thought the commentary  was very revealing.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to get professor friends to incorporate it in their classes but to<br/>
little avail.    Did it finally become popular?   Is it still around?<br/>
<br/>

P.S.:  How Children Fail has ALWAYS been my favorite of JHs books.   Instance<br/>
after instance of observations  of  what &quot;really&quot;  goes on..... </span></blockquote></div>
