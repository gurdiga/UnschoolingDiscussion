<div id="ygrps-yiv-938106224">OK, for Key Lime Crepes (which I first had for breakfast one balmy morning<br/>
in Key West, mmmmmm......), I just use a recipe for Key Lime Pie, this is<br/>
one:<br/>
<br/>
4 whole, large eggs - separated<br/>
14 oz condensed milk (note: I use condensed Goat&#39;s milk as we have dairy<br/>
allergies and it works fine too)<br/>
1/2 cup key lime juice<br/>
2 teaspoons sugar<br/>
1/3 teaspoon cream of tartar<br/>
<br/>
Beat the yolks in a bowl until thick. Add condensed milk and beat until<br/>
blended. Add lime juice slowly, mixing well.<br/>
<br/>
Then I chill this, and make crepes (you can use any crepes recipe):<br/>
<br/>
1/2 cup milk<br/>
1/3 cup flour<br/>
1 egg<br/>
a tiny pinch of salt<br/>
11/2 - 2 tablespoons butter<br/>
8 inch skillet<br/>
(4 servings)<br/>
<br/>
Put milk in bowl - add the flour, sift it in if possible- Beat with whisk<br/>
until milk and flour are well blended. Break egg into bowl, add salt. Beat<br/>
thoroughly until well mix .Put 1/2 teaspoon butter in skillet - heat medium<br/>
low. Pour 2 tablespoons batter into center of pan. Lift pan and tip in<br/>
several directions in a see saw motion to spread evenly on bottom of pan.<br/>
Cook until set - light brown.<br/>
<br/>
Roll up some filling in the crepes, top with whipped cream or topping....<br/>
enjoy!<br/>
