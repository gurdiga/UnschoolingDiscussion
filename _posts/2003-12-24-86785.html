<div id="ygrps-yiv-3256320">In a message dated 12/23/03 11:04:53 PM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joylyn@...">joylyn@...</a> writes:<br/>

&lt;&lt;  You really wouldn&#39;t want them to sugar <br/>
coat the answer just to not offend insecure people? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Clearly she did, and after a little flurry of insults on the side, she has <br/>
left the list.<br/>
<br/>
But Joylyn, what you wrote was beautiful and calm, and just as you were once <br/>
an undecided lurker, there are dozens to hundreds who will read your words and <br/>
see the peace and confidence you exude when you&#39;re talking about loving <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
There are trade-offs in life, and there are trade-offs in deciding how to <br/>
keep an e-mail list peaceful.  There&#39;s more learning for some people when it&#39;s <br/>
heated up.  Some people fritz out when there&#39;s disagreement and they shut down <br/>
(for reasons of personal history or their own stress-responses).   So if the <br/>
list is too peaceful it&#39;s boring, and if it&#39;s too confrontational some people <br/>
complain of too much mail.<br/>
<br/>
We have several moderators, and some will let messages through that others <br/>
would have rejected and vice versa.  That&#39;s fine with the list owners.  A couple <br/>
of people have complained and said all the moderators must agree, or they&#39;ve <br/>
said &quot;Oh HUH&quot; to one moderator because another allowed something the first one <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have.    We don&#39;t have to agree.  We just all need to care about <br/>
keeping the list useful for a large number of people.  We can&#39;t have a list that <br/>
every person loves equally, because different people want different things.  <br/>
One person who left expressed disappointment because we were talking about <br/>
parenting instead of about homeschooling resources.<br/>
<br/>
The best UNschooling resource any family can have involves good parenting.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not apologetic to people who say &quot;I came here to be told I was a good <br/>
mom, not to be criticized.&quot;  As Joylyn wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;[I]t would be very <br/>
silly for me to say &quot;good job for sending your son to his room&quot; when I <br/>
don&#39;t feel that way. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say &quot;good job&quot; to moms who want us to tell them that punishing their <br/>
bad kids is a good idea, but to suggest that they might be a factor in that <br/>
behavior or unhappiness is a STUPID idea, and we&#39;re just mean to suggest that <br/>
they look at themselves.<br/>
<br/>
La Leche League with all their radical attachment parenting ideas probably <br/>
gave me the main kernel of what became unschooling for me.  They said &quot;You and <br/>
your baby are partners.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When a parent and a child are adversaries, whether about nursing, what to <br/>
wear, when to sleep, what to eat, how to play, what to think, up and through <br/>
&quot;school years&quot; and young adulthood, we end up seeing all the problems in some of <br/>
the worst families where parents try to control the children to become some <br/>
vision of an idea child of thirty years before.   Instead of living on the <br/>
cutting edge of now, they try to rein their kids in so that they specifically do NOT <br/>
live now, they live in a past fashion for a fantasy future.<br/>
<br/>
That will be &quot;affirmed&quot; by many non-thinking people, agencies, businesses, <br/>
magazine covers, back-to-school ads, etc.    That will not, though, lead to <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
