<div id="ygrps-yiv-109192914">My sister in law called me today (my brother&#39;s wife)<br/>
and asked me to help her convince her dad to take her<br/>
little brother Charlie out of school.  He is 13 and in<br/>
eigth grade and is a wiz at computer programming and<br/>
games, and a bookworm.  He is failing every class in<br/>
school, had been labeled (and medicated) as ADHD for<br/>
many years, although he is not medicated now.  He has<br/>
terrible people skills and is sobbing and screaming in<br/>
frustration with school.  <br/>
<br/>
Charlie says it&#39;s not fair that he has to take all<br/>
this stuff that has nothing to do with what he wants<br/>
to do with his life, computer programming.  His father<br/>
is a single dad, and Charlie&#39;s mother died of cancer<br/>
about 2 years ago.  His father is very traditional and<br/>
&quot;old school.&quot;  Please I need your advice to help me<br/>
help this kid!  Anyone and everyone with ideas to get<br/>
this kid out of school let me know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957394885">Hi.  So I am having a little freak out with the unschooling and whether my<br/>
kids will ever learn the basics in math, reading, and writing.  Learned<br/>
yesterday my wife is pregnant with #5.  The kids were to be with their<br/>
grandparents this past weekend for 3 days, giving us some alone time, only<br/>
to be returned home the very next day, within 24 hours.  I&#39;m angry but<br/>
that&#39;s another issue I know how to deal with spiritualality.  The same<br/>
grandpa was telling our kids in these 24 hours they should be in school.<br/>
More anger.  He&#39;s one of the most controlling people I know.  2 of his 3<br/>
kids are highly dysfunctional (3 kids with 3 different woman)(not wife).<br/>
These events in the past 24 hours made me feel vulnerable last night.  I&#39;m<br/>
cool this morning.  Can I support 5 kids - yes I can.  Is unschooling the<br/>
right thing - hell yes it is.  Just need some a little support.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451990784"><p>This morning I heard something on the radio about college remedial programs. Across the US, half of all high-school graduates who apply to college need some kind of remediation. That seems bonkers - a massive indictment of public education. <br><br>My daughter is 12 and writes as well as many adults. No-one ever taught her that. She writes a lot and enjoys it. She&#39;s very aware of turns of phrase and pacing what makes for a good story. She doesn&#39;t know her multiplication tables, though, and sometimes says she&#39;s bad a math. I&#39;m not sure where she picked up that idea - probably from other kids - but even if she continues to think so, she won&#39;t be much different from lots and lots of kids who went through public school with nightly math homework. <br><br>School doesn&#39;t guarantee what kids will learn or know when they reach 18 - much less at 30. </p><p><br><blockquote><span title="ireply"> </span></blockquote></p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; The same<br>  grandpa was telling our kids in these 24 hours they should be in school.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br><br>Do your kids like him? Do they enjoy staying with him? If not, don&#39;t send them to stay with him. If they want contact, make it neutral territory - parks and family restaurants, zoos and Chuck-E-Cheese. <br><br>If they ask why grandpa thinks they should be in school, you could tell them that he&#39;s old - when he was a kid, there was no internet, hardly any tv even. Depending on how old he is, books might have been still mostly hardcover - expensive luxuries.&nbsp;There weren&#39;t as many good ways to learn back then. <br><br>---Meredith<br class="ygrps-yiv-451990784yui-cursor"></p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363285606">You rock.  I love having our children home.  I was the biggest failure in<br/>
school there ever was and now live a very successful life with everything I<br/>
ever wanted, especially my children home, far away from school.  Hated<br/>
school.  Hated every aspect.  Drank, drugs, homelessness, jails, you name<br/>
it, to drown out school&#39;s pressures and my parents voices.  Grateful for all<br/>
of it because it makes enjoying the good in my life so easy.  Thanks for the<br/>
unschooling.  Keep rocking!<br/>

-=-School doesn&#39;t guarantee what kids will learn or know when they reach 18<br/>
- much less at 30.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
School creates failures.  Guarantees failures.  For every A there&#39;s an F.<br/>
Half the children in school are below average.  Literally.  The &quot;C&quot; that<br/>
some kids (in American grading system) get is *called* average, but it&#39;s<br/>
below average.  The &quot;average&quot; falls between the B&#39;s and the C&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
School guarantees to start telling children when they&#39;re very young that<br/>
they&#39;re behind, and that if they study hard they can catch up, but it&#39;s not<br/>
true.  There is planned, scheduled, pre-determined failure.  Lots of it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are not good reasons to discuss school here.  I&#39;m going to leave this<br/>
steaming pile of school poo as a warning, for a while, not to think about<br/>
the alleged glory of school.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Few people realize what a competition school is, and that it is a lie that<br/>
&quot;if you work hard you can get an A.&quot;  10 to 15% MIGHT get A&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Those problems don&#39;t come up with unschooling.  Can&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
