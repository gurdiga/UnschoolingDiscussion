<h4>One of the Wechts</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286070889">This may have already been discussed, but this helped us this past year.<br/>
Occasionally and privately, I asked my two sons, then 16 and 12, if they would go separately to their rooms for a few minutes (20max) quiet time.<br/>
That gave the house that quiet feel and my then 8yo daughter would go to sleep.  She loves being with her brothers and is always afraid that she will miss something.  The 12 yo would sometimes go to sleep too : )<br/>
The oldest, who is a night owl and always has been, didn&#39;t. <br/>
If they both decided to do something together after she was asleep, they would keep the noise down.  Painting warhammer figures in the basement is one of their favorite activities.<br/>
If the big kids in your house would appreciate some time without the little ones around, they might been really happy to do this, both for you and for their own reasons : )<br/>
<br/>
I should point our that this was usually around midnight.<br/>

This is a really good idea! And so simple, I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t think of it on my own.  My daughters fall asleep pretty fast once their tucked into bed, so this will probably work for us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

I discussed this idea with my boys (13 and 9) and they agreed that it was a good idea.  So last night we tried it and the girls went to sleep at a decent time (and so did I!). This was a really great idea. Thank you!<br/>
