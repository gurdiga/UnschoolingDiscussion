<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019409694">I cannot make it to this year&#39;s conference in SC.  <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering about the &quot;program&quot; from last year&#39;s conference that lists for $4.00.  It says &quot;all speaker&#39;s notes&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is that a word for word transcript of the talks that were given?<br/>

Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
