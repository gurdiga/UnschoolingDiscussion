<div id="ygrps-yiv-578188456">Greetings everyone,<br/>
<br/>
We are in the second year of SECULAR homeschooling in NC (yes, <br/>
the &quot;structured, bible-belt driven state), and I am starting to lean <br/>
towards unschooling.  I have two wonderful daughters; one in <br/>
particular is profoundly gifted, with millions of questions and <br/>
insatiable curiosity ---- as well as energy!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to learning from all of you;  I am a structured <br/>
person myself, and am a little shaky at the outset of this adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Connie O&#39;Donnell<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of stuff to structure without trying to structure your <br/>
children&#39;s learning!  You could structure the HECK out of laundry and your <br/>
own hobbies and schedule and the garage or store room! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It would probably be to your advantage and your daughter&#39;s HUGE advantage if <br/>
you never again mention or even think &quot;profoundly gifted.&quot;  There isn&#39;t a <br/>
good exit from that room.  That label does people no more good than <br/>
&quot;profoundly disabled&quot; or any other label, and does harm parents seem never to <br/>
accept any responsibilty for. <br/>
<br/>
Just let her be her, and if she hit the high part of a learning curve early, <br/>
don&#39;t expect her to cure cancer on the moon.  It&#39;s too much pressure, and <br/>
spoils relationships.<br/>
<br/>
People with four-foot-tall seven year olds don&#39;t say &quot;He&#39;s profoundly tall, <br/>
so we&#39;re planning on basketball because his main strength is his height, and <br/>
we have to raise him as a tall child.&quot;  My friend Karen was taller than <br/>
everyone else in 4th grade, taller than the teacher, and that was about as <br/>
tall as she ever got.  5&#39;2&quot;  That was it.  Most of us are taller than she is <br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
Same happens with reading levels, same happens with &quot;getting math&quot; early, and <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Prodigy&quot; is not a fun thing to be.<br/>
Human is a GOOD thing.<br/>
Person-by-name is the best.  My daughter is Holly.  Some things she&#39;s great <br/>
at, some she&#39;s not as interested in or as good at.  She&#39;s Holly.<br/>

<br/>
Oh sure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should put it on the website instead of writing it over every time I <br/>
want to say why I object to giftedness labels.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that many of those who label their children &quot;gifted&quot; then <br/>
want to know whether I or my children are &quot;gifted.&quot;  I assume they want to <br/>
snort if they think I&#39;m not (figuring I know nothing about it and am just <br/>
jealous) or pay twice as much attention if they think I am (assuming, maybe, <br/>
that I MUST know, then, and being gifted would be worth listening to).<br/>
<br/>
And that right there is proof of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can score phenomenally high on SATs and be tone deaf, clumsy, lacking <br/>
in simple everyday logic, and unable to tell a frustrated tone of voice from <br/>
a patient and doofy tone of voice. Someone can be really wonderfully <br/>
intuitive, observant, a star ballerina, professional musician, award-winning <br/>
athlete, and score like a retard on the SATs.<br/>
<br/>
I have two male friends who have seven of Gardner&#39;s intelligences.  Neither <br/>
of them has the nature thing, so I won&#39;t say &quot;eight.&quot;  Both of them, jocks, <br/>
writers, math/engineering whizzes (one&#39;s a systems analyst and one a computer <br/>
tech of some sort).  Both are self aware, philosophical, and good with <br/>
interpersonal relations.  Both are musicians.  Both do very well in <br/>
scholastic pursuits formal and home-for-fun.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them brags it up.  They also are modest!  <br/>
<br/>
Were they &quot;gifted&quot; in school?<br/>
<br/>
What would it matter now that they&#39;re in their 30&#39;s if they were or not?<br/>
