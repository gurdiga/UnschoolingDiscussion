<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387513367">Hi!  I certainly don&#39;t want to add to anyone&#39;s feelings of guilt (guilt in<br/>
motherhood is like an epidemic) but speaking as one who has very strong<br/>
feelings about the damage television does to very young children<br/>
(especially),  I strongly encourage that everyone take a look at these two<br/>
websites  especially www.truceteachers.org &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.truceteachers.org">http://www.truceteachers.org</a>&gt;<br/>
(TRUCE stands for Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children&#39;s Entertainment).  <br/>
<br/>
Please remember that children under 5 are not able to make a strong<br/>
distinction between fantasy and reality-inappropriate programming can be<br/>
incredibly damaging.  If for some reason you need to use the tv as a baby<br/>
sitter, please be discerning about what is age appropriate.  I find with my<br/>
daughter, that when I am sick or something and unable to keep up with her<br/>
and I plant her infront of sesame street videos a little too much-then she<br/>
falls into a pattern acting &quot;addicted&quot; to the screen.  But most of the time,<br/>
she won&#39;t even look at a one of her educational videos for weeks at a time.<br/>
And then she is totally uninterested and wanders away after half an hour.   <br/>
<br/>
Please remember-you are the adult.  If you are uncomfortable about the<br/>
amount of television your child is watching-and especially it&#39;s content.<br/>
You can do something about it.  Put the tv in the garage for a month and see<br/>
how life changes.  I promise it will be for the better.  And you may find<br/>
that nobody misses it.<br/>

&gt; (TRUCE stands for Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children&#39;s Entertainment).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me it looks like they have strong opinions and are willing to grasp at<br/>
anything that will support those opinions, like picking and choosing what<br/>
scientific findings to present as &quot;facts&quot; and ignoring anything counter to<br/>
their position.<br/>
<br/>
From their &quot;Facts about Children, Media and Violence&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
 Children average 35 hours per week of screen time including TV, video<br/>
games and videos.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s sufficiently appalling to rally around. But think about it. That&#39;s an<br/>
average of 5 hours a day everyday of the year. And since it&#39;s an average<br/>
presumably some kids are doing more to make up for those who are doing less.<br/>
Most kids are in school and have homework and, if our town is typical,<br/>
they&#39;re *way* overscheduled with afterschool activities. So how are they<br/>
managing to squeeze in those 35 hours? They&#39;re either pigging out on the<br/>
weekends and over the summer, or some kids are doing nothing but TV watching<br/>
and video game playing!<br/>
<br/>
So the question is -- *if* those are accurate statistics and I&#39;m having a<br/>
tough time figuring out how it&#39;s possible -- why? Are kids using video as a<br/>
relaxant (as adults often do) from the stress of school? If that&#39;s so, how<br/>
does that apply to unschooled kids? Do they have nothing else in their lives<br/>
that&#39;s more interesting? Are they disconnected to their parents and<br/>
families?<br/>
<br/>
If kids are watching that much TV, is TV the cause or is TV the symptom of<br/>
something else entirely?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re a TV watching family and eat dinner while watching a movie. My<br/>
daughter often watches cartoons and can watch as much as she wants whenever<br/>
she wants. She does go on binges watching a lot of TV where she might make<br/>
35 hours in a week. And she goes on binges where she doesn&#39;t watch TV or<br/>
play video games or get on the computer. But as an average over a year? Not<br/>
even close.<br/>
<br/>
 Heavy TV viewers are less imaginative, more aggressive, and have poorer<br/>
concentration.<br/>
<br/>
I would question that on a number of levels. First I&#39;d question that it&#39;s a<br/>
&quot;fact&quot; and not a conclusion. And poorer concentration? If they&#39;re doing<br/>
*anything* heavily, then they&#39;re concentrating. I suspect whoever came up<br/>
with the study means they can&#39;t concentrate on boring school work. Perhaps<br/>
because they&#39;re visual learners? Perhaps because they&#39;ve realized the<br/>
meaninglessness of school and are using TV as an escape so they don&#39;t *want*<br/>
to concentrate on something they&#39;ve concluded is meaningless?<br/>
<br/>
Again, is TV the cause of this or a symptom? Are they agressive because of<br/>
their lives and find TV a satisfying outlet?<br/>
<br/>
 Viewing media violence can make children more aggressive, fearful,<br/>
disrespectful and insensitive to the effects of violence.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who watch TV with their families? Who have a parent who is available to<br/>
do things?<br/>
<br/>
The problem with all studies is they study schooled kids. The researchers<br/>
aren&#39;t aware of how huge an impact that school has on kids&#39; lives. And even<br/>
if they were aware it&#39;s not a factor that can be easily eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
 Children&#39;s TV has 5 times as many acts of violence per hour as adult TV<br/>
(26 vs 5).<br/>
<br/>
It would be interesting how they counted acts of violence. Is Wiley Coyote<br/>
getting blown up by his own inventions and stupidity violence?<br/>
<br/>
Kids are wired differently than adults and most need actions to understand.<br/>
They also think getting bopped on the head or having paint dumped on someone<br/>
is funny. It&#39;s hard to have a superhero rescuing people unless there&#39;s some<br/>
threat going on. Do kids watch action because that&#39;s what programmers are<br/>
feeding them or because that&#39;s how they make sense of the world? Kids games<br/>
are action oriented and some are &quot;violent&quot; (involving contact). (Not that I<br/>
don&#39;t think programmers wouldn&#39;t take advantage of the kids&#39; need for action<br/>
and program for maximum action to draw as many kids as possible. I think<br/>
insisting stations supply so many hours of educational programming per day<br/>
is a good thing.)<br/>
<br/>
The misuse of science is a pet peeve of mine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please remember that children under 5 are not able to make a strong<br/>

&gt; incredibly damaging.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a more appropriate warning to parents who aren&#39;t attuned to their<br/>
kids, who are separated from their kids because of work and school. It&#39;s<br/>
kind of hard not to be aware of what a child is getting from TV when we are<br/>
living right beside them. Sometimes kids get scared. Spiders or action<br/>
figures or picture books can scare kids. Sometimes kids get the idea they<br/>
can fly. But part of unschooling is providing them a safe place for their<br/>
fantasies and fears.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431638239">&lt;&lt; Do kids watch action because that&#39;s what programmers are<br/>
<br/>
feeding them or because that&#39;s how they make sense of the world?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or because the &quot;non-action&quot; dramas that some adults love are in NO way of <br/>
interest to kids?  Why would a four year old boy watch Casablanca?  It&#39;s <br/>
people talking.  And they&#39;re talking about things that aren&#39;t even happening <br/>
onscreen.  Comparing all the chick flicks, past and present, to all the <br/>
cartoons and saying &quot;more violent&quot; about cartoons is not scientifically <br/>
valid.   It&#39;s comparing apples and 2x4&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
kind of hard not to be aware of what a child is getting from TV when we are<br/>
<br/>
living right beside them. Sometimes kids get scared. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend my age told me of sneaking up behind his dad&#39;s chair, when he was <br/>
little, and watching Frankenstein, the old Boris Karloff one, when it was on <br/>
TV one night.  The dad said &quot;GO TO BED.&quot;  But he stayed and watched and it <br/>
scared him badly.  He didn&#39;t know it from a news show.<br/>
<br/>
Now his dad was a sadistic violent kind of guy, but IF (just if) since the <br/>
kid had already seen some of it, the dad (who was watching it) could have <br/>
invited said kid to sit on his lap, and he could have told him it was an all <br/>
made-up story, that no such thing could really happen, and talk about <br/>
movie-making and make-up, it could have been a really nice session between <br/>
them, and the fright would have dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
The model of a school kid zoning out in front of a TV for five hours and then <br/>
not having studied his social studies which in turn inconveniences his <br/>
teacher is a world away from my kids watching The Tick with me, and <br/>
discussing literary references, or parodies of other movies and characters.<br/>
<br/>
The report of the ideas of teachers about the effects of TV ring like <br/>
duct-tape bells.  I see my own kids, and others I know, who can turn the TV <br/>
on when they want, and I see them turning it off as often as they turn it on. <br/>
 I see them learning, and asking intelligent questions, and NOT being average <br/>
or lowest common denominator kinds of people, but interesting, thoughtful, <br/>
funny, bright people.  They live without shame and fear, while some other <br/>
families who hope to save their children from some incidental fears or ill <br/>
effects of TV do themselves bring shame and fear into the family situation.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t getting shame and fear from me, and neither are they getting <br/>
it from the TV.  I&#39;m not having to be dishonest about the horrors and evils <br/>
of TV, I&#39;m not having to shame them for even having thought to have wanted <br/>
some of it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes there&#39;s some junk on TV.  There&#39;s junk at the candy counter too.  There&#39;s <br/>
junk in books too.  There&#39;s junk on the internet too.  My kids don&#39;t dig <br/>
through the trash, they don&#39;t hunt up junk, they don&#39;t eat crap.  WHY?  <br/>
Because it&#39;s not good.  Given a choice between something good and something <br/>
stupid, why would they choose &quot;stupid&quot;?  (Although when the Simpsons had <br/>
Judge Judy jokes this week, Marty was able to tell me which parts indicated <br/>
Judge Judy which ways, because I haven&#39;t seen her but he has.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048952556">I have a two year old who is CONSTANTLY watching videos.  He picks <br/>
out the video he wants from the shelf, puts it in the vcr and presses <br/>
play.  When it&#39;s over, he can hit eject and take it out of the vcr.  <br/>
We have two tvs with vcrs and often he has a video going in two <br/>
different rooms.  Sometimes I worry that he&#39;s watching too much.  On <br/>
the other hand, maybe there&#39;s something that he&#39;s especially gifted <br/>
with that he&#39;s trying to develop through all his putting videos in <br/>
and out of vcrs.  He does the same thing with computer games. He <br/>
knows which button will hit and what will happen if he puts a game in <br/>
and closes it again.  I had to teach him NOT to turn my computer off <br/>
and on because for awhile he was getting a kick out of that and it <br/>
wasn&#39;t very good for my computer. :)  He loves to sit and watch his <br/>
older brothers and sisters play computer games and although he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have the skill to use a mouse yet, he sometimes tries and I <br/>
bet it won&#39;t be long until he can use one.  It&#39;s also amazing that he <br/>
seems to know which video or computer cd he is going to be playing, <br/>
even if they aren&#39;t with their cases.  Perhaps he&#39;s recognizing the <br/>
letters or the colors and associating them with a particular story?  <br/>
<br/>
So I do think that a true unschooler wouldn&#39;t limit tv/video watching <br/>
as long as the child is being responsible in doing chores.  As a <br/>
Christian, I also feel that God wants me to make sure that they don&#39;t <br/>
watch anything that contradicts God&#39;s Word or is not honoring to <br/>
Him.  My kids know that there are certain tv shows they simply aren&#39;t <br/>
allowed to watch.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929752425">I really like what a lot of you have to say on this<br/>
thread (Sandra, Julie, Pam, etc.). I have gone through<br/>
various different levels of paranoia concerning my<br/>
dd&#39;s TV watching (which gets linked into &quot;she&#39;s not<br/>
doing enough &#39;educational&#39; stuff&quot;). I seem to go<br/>
through this when I&#39;m in a transition phase of my life<br/>
and am not feeling very stable/strong in myself. I<br/>
also go through this when I am lacking unschooling<br/>
support (which is why I find this list a necessary<br/>
part of my family&#39;s wellbeing!). I don&#39;t limit TV<br/>
watching in our home (I have in the past and it just<br/>
made the TV a SUPER attractive object!). But I do use<br/>
distraction if I can&#39;t stand the noise of the TV<br/>
anymore! I find that more often than not if I make a<br/>
few suggestions of alternative things to do,<br/>
especially if it involves me doing it with her, she is<br/>
only too eager to turn the box off. But I also finds<br/>
that she gets play inspiration from her videos. We<br/>
don&#39;t have regular TV at the moment  - no cable and<br/>
aerial not working (okay, so I&#39;m not rushing to get it<br/>
fixed either) - so she&#39;s watching less right now<br/>
naturally. IMO she uses videos (and books, and movies)<br/>
to give her ideas for themes to play in her<br/>
imagination games. I notice she seems to need the<br/>
input when we haven&#39;t seen friends for a few days  and<br/>
I think maybe because she&#39;s an only child ( it&#39;s just<br/>
her and I ) and sometimes the ideas just dry up and<br/>
she needs fresh stimulus. I also don&#39;t regulate her<br/>
food intake, but she does! A couple of days ago I got<br/>
out some left-over apple crumble to have for breakfast<br/>
and she told me (in a very superior tone!) that SHE<br/>
was going to have PROPER food for breakfast, and asked<br/>
me to make her some scrambled eggs. I ate MY apple<br/>
crumble anyway! I&#39;ve gone on a bit but I&#39;ve been<br/>
following this very interestedly and had to contribute<br/>
my 2  cents on this one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028130934">OK, timidly entering the TV fray, understanding (I think) everyone&#39;s position. I<br/>
can compare and contrast the TV debate with the food debate and find some<br/>
similarities.<br/>
<br/>
In our family we don&#39;t have TV. Not &quot;we have TV but don&#39;t let the children watch<br/>
it,&quot; and not &quot;we only allow the kids educational or pre-defined  videos.&quot; Not<br/>
even &quot;when we had kids we got rid of the TV to protect them from it.&quot; No. We<br/>
just don&#39;t have TV. It&#39;s a non-issue for us most of the time, unless we&#39;re going<br/>
to wait while the car is fixed and there&#39;s a TV and another customer watching<br/>
it. We really don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting story, though. My 3-year-old had gone with me to a friend&#39;s house<br/>
and the other kids went back to the bedroom to watch some show. Later he told<br/>
me, &quot;Mom! I watched TV!&quot; He had that look kids get when they&#39;re watching for the<br/>
reaction. I said, &quot;Did you like it?&quot; and he said no, he hadn&#39;t and he&#39;d wanted<br/>
to go play with some stuff but the other kids tried to make him stay.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s no telling. We may someday get a TV, but I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t be<br/>
the center of the living room decor.<br/>

We just moved from a 2-bedroom house to a larger one. We did need the extra <br/>
space but I had a friend who thought it was child abuse to make my kids share <br/>
a room. In her words, &quot;If you can&#39;t afford a room for each kid, then you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326061880">We only have two bedrooms - one for us (and just recently our 1 yo) <br/>
and one for the kids - bunk beds for the older two and a cot for the <br/>
youngest.  They sleep fine!<br/>

&gt; You can get really cool bunk beds that are double beds on the top <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; double beds on the bottom.  You should be able to have 3 more <br/>
without <br/>
&gt; having to think about moving. <br/>

Where is it written that kids need their own room?  I&#39;m sure that the <br/>
millions of people around the world who only have a one room house <br/>
(or none at all) would love to hear that!  There are worse forms of <br/>
child abuse than not having your own room.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest *wanted* the youngest to move in with them &quot;so we&#39;re all <br/>
cosy and together!&quot;  Perhaps its what you&#39;re used to.  I grew up in a <br/>
two bedroom house and shared with my brother (who eventually moved <br/>
into and moved out from the caravan out the front when he was 13 or <br/>
so). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440101701">Well, then I guess I&#39;m being abused too because my husband wants to<br/>
share our bedroom.  The nerve of him taking a wife when he couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford to give me my own room!<br/>

&gt; I had a friend who thought it was child abuse to make my kids share<br/>
&gt; a room. In her words, &quot;If you can&#39;t afford a room for each kid, then you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t afford the kids!&quot; Sheesh.<br/>

spare.<br/>

abuse.<br/>
