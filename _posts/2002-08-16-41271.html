&lt;&lt; By the way, they did clean up the blueberries - to a point, there are <br/>
still stains I can&#39;t seem to get out... but only after me yelling - and I <br/>
hate to do that.... yelling is the worst - and it seems so hard sometimes to <br/>
not yell in these circumstances.....  It&#39;s hard to imagine anyone else here <br/>
as a &quot;yelling, unschooler&quot;....<br/>

I am a natural yeller. Sounds ridiculous, but I have fought long and hard to <br/>
overcome my tendency to raise my voice when under stress.<br/>
I do pretty good most of the time now, but smashed blueberries might have got <br/>
me upset....hard to say what all of the circumstances surrounding it was.<br/>
I ask my kids to eat at the table, not a hard and fast rule, but just <br/>
something I ask for to help me keep things from getting trashed.<br/>
I do think young children need a lot of supervision and when you can&#39;t give <br/>
it things can get out of hand. Unschooling does not mean letting them do <br/>
whatever they want....although when I advocate letting children choose it <br/>
probably sounds like that.<br/>
I think a huge part of it is being there with them,  explaining why smashed <br/>
blueberries will ruin the carpet and asking them how we could avoid that.<br/>
Keeping art supplies available is great, but you better take into account the <br/>
developmental stage of each child and what they can handle.<br/>
I want them to get me for things beyond their developmental abilities. I need <br/>
to be with them, available, but also guiding them.<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean give them access to whatever you&#39;ve got and turn <br/>
them loose. Understanding child development is crucial to being an effective <br/>
parent in my opinion.  Blueberries are probably not the best thing to leave <br/>
out when you&#39;re in the shower. Or maybe they could all come in the bathroom <br/>
and eat them while you&#39;re washing? I personally, would have waited. Waited <br/>
until they were done eating them to shower, or if they didn&#39;t care, waited to <br/>
feed them blueberries until I was done showering.<br/>
Art supplies that they can handle should be available, others should be only <br/>
where the older kids can get to them.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t let my baby boy dabble with things. I do. But I <br/>
want to be the one getting it out and giving him access while in a high chair <br/>
or safely in my lap.<br/>
yk?  I think it&#39;s easy to read here and think everyone is just turning their <br/>
kids loose. Remember there are a lot of older kids being discussed here that <br/>
can have access equally to parents.<br/>
But there are little ones not ready for access to the entire household. You <br/>
could make yourself crazy trying to be &quot;free&quot; and creative.<br/>
I think you&#39;re on the right track, but just try to remember that age matters <br/>
and access at young ages is hugely different than at older ages.<br/>
I hope I&#39;m not assuming too much.....maybe I&#39;m totally off the mark. But <br/>
that&#39;s the feel I get from your post.<br/>
Don&#39;t feel bad about losing it, or do feel bad and then let it go.  No one <br/>
here is a perfect parent, I bet most of us have yelled. I do it more than I&#39;d <br/>
like for sure.<br/>
But that&#39;s what I love about this forum. It&#39;s my touchstone for gentle <br/>
parenting, a reminder to not do the things that may come easily (yelling),  <br/>
but to do better.<br/>
Most of the time it&#39;s something that we, as parents, need to do different.<br/>
Hindsights great that way isn&#39;t it? I usually can see after the fact, that if <br/>
I had done something different the event wouldn&#39;t have happened that stressed <br/>
me out in the first place.<br/>
