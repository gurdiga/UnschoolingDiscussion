<br/>
Husband: My husband had a breakthrough last night. I&#39;ve been talking about <br/>
homeschooling with him in the same way that I talked about extended <br/>
breastfeeding. That is, I never come out with a banner and say &quot;THIS IS WHAT <br/>
I BELIEVE SHOULD BE DONE!&quot; I just sort of say &quot;Hmm, I&#39;ve been wondering...&quot; <br/>
and &quot;Well I&#39;m not sure but...&quot; etc to sort of ease him into it with <br/>
information and thoughts, since he&#39;s very traditional-minded. He&#39;s been <br/>
great so far -- still nursing at age 2.25 and he&#39;s very supportive of my <br/>
homeschool efforts/ideas. ANYWAY, I had been talking about the whole <br/>
&#39;socialization&#39; issue and I know I&#39;ve said a few times about how school <br/>
socialization stinks anyway -- in the same room with the same people every <br/>
single day and you get in TROUBLE for talking! :) And last night he told <br/>
*ME* that he felt like the things I do with Benny will make him much more <br/>
interesting to himself and others than putting him in preschool, and went on <br/>
to say how as he grows up he will meet more people, learn to seek <br/>
answers/info from more diverse sources... I mean you all know the deal -- <br/>
but it was just so funny and so good to hear it actually coming from him. <br/>
And of course I wasn&#39;t like, &quot;Okay, based on your new belief in homeschool, <br/>
I will now pull a 40 page contract from my hip pocket and request that you <br/>
sign away our child&#39;s future into the hands of HOMESCHOOL INC&quot; *cackle* I <br/>
just said, &quot;OH, that&#39;s interesting. I think I agree.&quot; Heh heh. Baby steps. <br/>
Baby steps.<br/>
<br/>
Potty: Potty training? Child has no interest, except when older playmates <br/>
are here using the potty. Then he&#39;ll sit on it, or they take turns sitting <br/>
on it, etc. I don&#39;t *care* I mean I really don&#39;t, but should I be, like, <br/>
reading him a book about potties or something? Can someone recommend a good <br/>
one? I didn&#39;t potty train until I was 3 or so -- I went to Montessori in a <br/>
diaper and in two days was potty trained by the other kids. Of course, Benny <br/>
isn&#39;t going to Montessori... do I need to have another kid model it for him <br/>
more often? Or should I just let it go? I feel like if he had an older <br/>
sibling he&#39;d be using the potty now.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say it is something you try... Get interested in things! :) In school I hated reading, I have hated it for years, but once I began to unschool myself and let my creativity explode, I have been devouring books like there is no tomorrow :) Now I try new and different things all the time, and sometimes the boys get interested, sometimes they don&#39;t...  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do anything, just let him do it. He learned to walk, and talk and I promise he won&#39;t go off into the adult world wearing diapers &lt;g&gt; Really though, just let him do it in his own time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My third was 3 1/2-4  before he was using the potty regularly.<br/>
I really don&#39;t think he felt the signals until that time.<br/>
My 1st and 3rd both took a while to use the potty regularly and they <br/>
both have night time dryness problems.  My 2nd and 4th both pretty <br/>
much just started using the potty around 2 and neither wet the bed.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry, if it doesn&#39;t bother you.  I admit getting really <br/>
tired of poopy diapers and definately nudged in the direction of the <br/>
potty.  We got &quot;Once Upon a Potty&quot;(book,doll and video) from my SIL, <br/>
but I don&#39;t think it really did any good.  Though they loved the <br/>
video.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>None of mine were reliably using the toilet before they were 3 - 3 1/2.  My <br/>
daughter actually trained herself just before age 2.  ( I just talked about <br/>
how she&#39;d want to use the toilet when she was a bigger girl.)  Then we <br/>
moved.  Six months later, she just about had it and we moved again.<br/>
