&gt; You&#39;re right - there are so many sex offenders out there - especially<br/>
&gt; considering more are never convicted and so you&#39;d never be able to know<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; hiring - and it would be a false sense of security to think you&#39;re ever<br/>
&gt; really safe - and I also agree that there are a lot of things that are<br/>
&gt; lumped into that category that I personally would not feel was a threat to<br/>
&gt; children. My own concern with this issue would lean more toward them NOT<br/>
&gt; sending their employees to a free program on how to spot pedophiles. That<br/>
&gt; one I don&#39;t understand. But again - Patti said she couldn&#39;t find any info<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; why people boycott Disney - I was listing what I found. It&#39;s not all stuff<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; believe - I&#39;m not a Disney boycotter.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not defending &#39;sex offenders&#39; or Disney, but I am thinking critically<br/>
&gt; about the statement I quoted.<br/>

My parents were caught having sex in the back of their own station wagon when <br/>
I was a young teen.  They had a house full of kids, so they &quot;went parking.&quot;  <br/>
Unfortunately, they did it on Indian land.  As they were married, it wasn&#39;t as <br/>
bad.   They were just sent away.  It would&#39;ve been public indecency, though, <br/>
pants-down as they were.   They might&#39;ve been just offenders within Santa <br/>
Clara Pueblo, or maybe because of that it would be a literal federal offense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recently did traffic school, and learned that in CA it is legal to be<br/>
naked while in your vehicle, even if you&#39;re visible.<br/>
<br/>
But, it is illegal to throw anything out of your vehicle unless it is hay,<br/>
feathers, and some other third thing I don&#39;t recall.  Food can&#39;t be thrown.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing what odd laws get discussed in a joking traffic school.<br/>

***************************<br/>
I can vouch for this!  Many moons ago when I worked at a large PD in  CA, we <br/>
had to enter F.I. (field interview) cards into the computer.  F.I.  cards were <br/>
what the officers filled out when someone had been found in a  somewhat <br/>
strange or potentially violent situation, but they weren&#39;t&#39; breaking  the law.  We <br/>
used to read the weird ones to each other to break the  monotony.<br/>
 <br/>
One of our &quot;favorites&quot; was when a man was found naked in his car (except  for <br/>
a washrag covering his privates).  He had a d**do on the seat next  to him.  <br/>
I can&#39;t remember what his excuse was, but it was something to the  effect that <br/>
he was just waiting for a friend or watching traffic...???<br/>
