I just wanted you to know how wonderful this makes me feel!<br/>
<br/>
People have written before how much the conferences have meant to them, but <br/>
WOW! does it touch my heart that it&#39;s changed your *daughter&#39;s* life so much!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for that bright spot in my day!<br/>

Although, we are fairly new unschoolers, my 14 year old daughter, Brenna, has <br/>
been doing very &quot;cool&quot; things since we came home from last years Unschooling <br/>
Conference.  She went with us loaded down with her academic books from a <br/>
homeschooling co-op which included<br/>
Anatomy and Phisiology, Geometry, and World History.  She truly came home a <br/>
changed child.  She quit the co-op and those textbooks are gathering dust . <br/>
She <br/>
read Grace Llewlyns &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;,  made a quilt with <br/>
quilting pieces from the conference raffle, started sculpting,  became very <br/>
involved <br/>
in photography, planted strawberry corn, which is in pots all over our house, <br/>
in preparation for a small green house she is designing,  went back to <br/>
writing <br/>
poetry(which is all over her bedroom floor), decided to direct a play this <br/>
spring and has found the play and a facility as well as a group of <br/>
homeschoolers <br/>
to act in it, became interested in vegetarian cooking and made a wonderful <br/>
dinner for us all last night.  She and I took a wheel building class and <br/>
learned <br/>
to throw pots that we gave friends and family for Christmas gifts.  I <br/>
continue to just be in awe of her enthusiasm, energy and the joy she brings <br/>
to her <br/>
days.  She has always been very self-directed and has homeschooled since she <br/>
was <br/>
8 but her energies went into &quot;school-like&quot; pursuits.  There was very little <br/>
of the joyfulness evident that I now see in her every day.<br/>
<br/>
This morning , she has discovered boxes of pictures that I never got into <br/>
albums and is working on a scrapbook  of her life so far.  She is also <br/>
involved <br/>
in community theatre and enjoys public speaking.<br/>
<br/>
Brenna asked if you could e-mail her as she would love to be involved in any <br/>
way at the Live and Learn Conference this year.  We will definitely be there. <br/>
 <br/>
After the changes in our lives from last year, I wouldn&#39;t miss it for <br/>
anything.<br/>

(who now even drives around with unschooling bumper stickers in our extremely <br/>
conservative and religious homeschool community)<br/>
