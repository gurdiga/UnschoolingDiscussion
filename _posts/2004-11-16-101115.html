Anyone  here who doubts that should order some back issues of Home School <br/>
Digest  or The Old Schoolhouse.   They WANT their children separate, they  <br/>
WANT them <br/>
to think that everything outside their protected little world is  the <br/>
imminent <br/>
destruction by and of Satan and that the children&#39;s only  salvation is <br/>
isolation.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Or you can come visit me for a few weeks.  There are lots of  homeschoolers <br/>
here that won&#39;t let their children play with mine.  <br/>
