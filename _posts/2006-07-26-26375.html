<div id="ygrps-yiv-89200171">Desperately seeking opinions on the subject of attending high school!<br/>
<br/>
My almost fifteen year old daughter has just brought up that she <br/>
would like to attend school come September. In fact she was quite <br/>
nervous to bring it up to me because she knows that I will do my <br/>
best to discourage her. I don&#39;t mean to, but I can&#39;t seem to help <br/>
thinking that high school is the last thing that she needs right <br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
Am I crazy to want to find ANY other option? Of course I realize <br/>
that if this is what she really wants then that&#39;s what we&#39;ll have to <br/>
sort out (and I told her so) but what I guess I really want is an <br/>
unschooling perspective on where to go from here.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to think that without a high school diploma she&#39;ll never <br/>
be able to get a job, and no amount of me telling her that&#39;s not <br/>
true will convince her otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any and all advise<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577246866">My 15yo daughter wants to go to high school this year as well.  I am supporting her decision the same way I did when she wanted to do gymnastics or learn to play the piano.  Of course, I realize that the reason my 15yo wants to go to school is because that is where the 17yo boys are.....educational issues are rather irrelevant in this particular case.<br/>
<br/>
I called the school to see what was involved.  We talked about how her math computation skills might need some work.  She is spending this summer working with a tutor once a week (The tutor is thrilled with the fact that Adriane isn&#39;t afraid of math and understands the concepts already, just needs to &quot;math language&quot; to put to it).<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t think it is fair to try to talk her out of it.  I did talk to her about which responsibilities I was willing to take on to support her and which ones I wasn&#39;t.  I am not driving back and forth to school for example, she will have to take the bus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1968628140">Not having a high school diploma didn&#39;t keep my always unschooled daughter <br/>
out of college, AND she got her first paid job BECAUSE she was unschooled - her <br/>
dance studio needed someone to cover the afternoon classes of a teacher going <br/>
on maternity leave, none of the regular teachers were available for that time <br/>
and the older assistants were in school. She&#39;s been employed by them ever <br/>
since.<br/>

She&#39;s never been to school and wants to try it because she thinks it&#39;s<br/>
going to be fun.  It was recommended to me that I have her read or at<br/>

even more against her going to school.  I really do want it to be her<br/>
decision to be home, but I can&#39;t get over the fact that there are<br/>
negative things that will happen to her and the special person she is<br/>
and the great mind she has if she goes to school.  Things that she<br/>
won&#39;t even realize are happening.  I know there are ways for me to<br/>
help negate  these forces, but she&#39;ll be under their control for 6<br/>
continuous hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
I still wonder, should a 12-yr-old, (who is actually a little young<br/>
for 12) with all her innocence and enthusiastic expectations for a TV<br/>
show school experience, and who doesn&#39;t quite understand the reality<br/>
of school make this huge decision ? Or should I as the most trusted<br/>

the information of what you think about school into her head? That&#39;s  <br/>
what they do in school: they decide what they want kids to know and  <br/>
they tell them rather than let them experience and figure it out for  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My then 7 yo tried out 2nd grade. She lasted 2 months. She can  <br/>
confidently state what she doesn&#39;t like about school from her own  <br/>
experience. She *owns* that information because it was acquired by  <br/>
living it.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s quite a harsh and defeatist way to look at it.  For one thing,  <br/>
if it got really bad she could go to the office between classes and  <br/>
call you to come get her.<br/>
<br/>
Schools WISH the kids were &quot;under their control.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is she under YOUR control at home?<br/>
<br/>
If she has a mind of her own and is making a choice, she&#39;s  <br/>
controlling the situation.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s not allowed to make a choice, you&#39;re controlling her.<br/>
<br/>
People can be persuasive without being controlling, unless the person  <br/>
they&#39;re persuading really has no preferences whatsoever, and if she  <br/>
has no preferences, then any situation is as good as another (until  <br/>
she develops preferences).<br/>

<br/>
How huge a decision is it?  She can come home after a few days if she  <br/>

Maybe so.  Probably.  But is it a decision between really rich and  <br/>

happening there, there are people, there&#39;s laughter.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-You can certainly give your opinion too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How could a chile make an informed decision without information?  If  <br/>
the parent&#39;s &quot;opinion&quot; is propaganda and manipulation, the child  <br/>
still won&#39;t be making a well informed decision, though.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then you hope they don&#39;t like it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they DO like it, because it&#39;s better than home, it would be more  <br/>
generous and loving for the parent to be glad the child likes it.<br/>
<br/>
To hope a child is unhappy seems cruel to me.  It seems antagonistic  <br/>
and not partnerly.<br/>
<br/>
Discovering the child&#39;s concerns and answering those (can unschooled  <br/>
teens get into college?  can I make friends without going to school?)  <br/>
seems like the best course.  Any parent who doesn&#39;t already know  <br/>
those answers and isn&#39;t moving in a direction that will give kids  <br/>
exposure and options could be doing better at unschooling.<br/>

  I would make home something extra special. Make it some place NO ONE <br/>
would want to leave! Why is school so interesting? Is your home not <br/>
that interesting? Why not? What can you do to make home more alluring <br/>
than school? Do it! Make a schedule of events (anyone wondering what <br/>
*I* am up to??? &lt;G&gt;) ---make a schedule monthly of cool places to go, <br/>
fun things to do---an Unschooling Syllabus! Make home seem like a <br/>
better place to be.<br/>
<br/>
  And let her go. You DO have to trust her to make the best decision <br/>
*for her*!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852918142">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Our son went to public school when he was 5. It was his decision and  <br/>
though he was scared, I supported him. It lasted 5 months. He hated  <br/>
it. I had spent many days inside the class room when he decided to  <br/>
leave as I really thought he&#39;d like it. Long story short, he didn&#39;t  <br/>
just not like it, he HATED public school and was bored out of his  <br/>
mind. Because I was very involved and spend a lot of time in the  <br/>
classroom. By the way, I HIGHLY recommend every parent should check  <br/>
out what goes on behind those doors whose children attend PS. I was  <br/>
the only parent there (no surprise to me) and could clearly see why  <br/>
our son was son unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
We refer to PS &quot;free daycare&quot; as that was our experience. Life at  <br/>
home was much more exciting and our son has been home and unschooled  <br/>
ever since.<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting and a learning experience and really enlightened  <br/>
us to what goes on in that particular school&#39;s classrooms, but made  <br/>
us even more happy unschooling and trusting in our child&#39;s process.<br/>
<br/>
Not all schools are alike. I loved school up until the 6th grade and  <br/>
then we moved. That was the end of my PS &quot;career&quot;. I unschooled until  <br/>
17 and got my G.E.D. with no problem. Funny, I just found a copy of  <br/>
it all these years later the other day while filing personal papers.  <br/>
I&#39;ve never EVER needed it once. Not once in all these years (I&#39;m 42)  <br/>
have I ever been asked to present either my G.E.D. or proof of my  <br/>
degree in Art when applying for employment. I could have put down  <br/>
anything probably and gotten away with it. I wouldn&#39;t, but it&#39;s fun  <br/>
to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you in whatever your daughter and your family decides!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333880492">Dear Stefani,<br/>
<br/>
A dear friend of mine shared her experience in this situation: Her story <br/>
gave our family an opportunity to explore this important issue and helped to <br/>
firm my resolve, in the event I am in a similar situation. She told me that <br/>
it was no different that if her daughter wanted to experiment with drugs (or <br/>
other potentially harmful activities). She explored, with her daughter, what <br/>
the attraction was; she also expressed her feelings of responsibility, as a <br/>
parent (and therefore authority) to support choices that &#39;mom&#39; felt <br/>
comfortable with supporting. It turned out that the daughter was longing for <br/>
the recognition of the milestone: the gown, the limo, the party and all the <br/>
associated fun and glamour. When &#39;mom&#39; stated that all those things could <br/>
still happen and that &#39;mom&#39; (as authority) would not support attending <br/>
highschool the greatest pressure was off. I don&#39;t know if there was much <br/>
residual stuff, but perhaps we might hear from &#39;mom&#39; soon...<br/>
<br/>
I also know that the daughter has been quite employed (at least as much as <br/>
she wanted to be employed) since that time.<br/>

<br/>
Moms as authorities can say no to all KINDS of things.  That&#39;s the  <br/>
rule.  Moms can say no.<br/>
<br/>
But what if you are trying to live by principles and not by rules?   <br/>
Authority changes then.<br/>
<br/>
If the principle involves safety, the daughter and mom together can  <br/>
work to overcome and satisfy the MOM&#39;s safety concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Any list list can tell the mom to do what she wants to because she&#39;s  <br/>
the authority, but how can we help the mom see from the child&#39;s point  <br/>
of view and maintain a whole different kind of relationship with her  <br/>
daughter?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know if there was much<br/>

<br/>
Mom might never know.  It might be something the daughter keeps to  <br/>
herself (among other things, if her relationship with her mom is one  <br/>
of &quot;the authority&quot; and the powerless child).<br/>
<br/>
It might not seem important, but it can make all the difference in  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-458521426">All I meant is that you trust the child to make the decision,but you know that you are ultimately in control of the situation and can take the child out of the situation.  Children do not always make the best choices.  You trust them to make the decision, but they may make a mistake and put themself in a bad situation.  I don&#39;t agree that school is the same as drugs, but if they did make a choice that was dangerous-you can remove them from that situation. <br/>

That last statement seems contradictory to the second one.<br/>

-=- I think you have to let them know that you trust them to make the <br/>

<br/>
Maybe so. Probably. But is it a decision between really rich and <br/>
vibrant unschooling in an ideal home, or is it that school is more <br/>
interesting that whatever&#39;s going on at home?<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are driven to want school because there are things <br/>
happening there, there are people, there&#39;s laughter.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can certainly give your opinion too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How could a chile make an informed decision without information? If <br/>
the parent&#39;s &quot;opinion&quot; is propaganda and manipulation, the child <br/>
still won&#39;t be making a well informed decision, though.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then you hope they don&#39;t like it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they DO like it, because it&#39;s better than home, it would be more <br/>
generous and loving for the parent to be glad the child likes it.<br/>
<br/>
To hope a child is unhappy seems cruel to me. It seems antagonistic <br/>
and not partnerly.<br/>
<br/>
Discovering the child&#39;s concerns and answering those (can unschooled <br/>
teens get into college? can I make friends without going to school?) <br/>
seems like the best course. Any parent who doesn&#39;t already know <br/>
those answers and isn&#39;t moving in a direction that will give kids <br/>
exposure and options could be doing better at unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-854344230">I didn&#39;t see the original question but here is my 2 cents...<br/>
<br/>
My girls had never been to school, and both were curious.  Last sept <br/>
they went, because as a single mom it was one way of handling child <br/>
care, etc.  It was HELL for Lexie, she stuck with it because we couldn&#39;t <br/>
figure out child care.  It was OK for Janene.  Lexie was 5th grade, <br/>
Janene 2nd.  We found a way out, back to unschooling, after 2 1/2 <br/>
months, and Lexie, as we were walking out of the school, announced, <br/>
rather loudly and with spirit &quot; I will not ever go back into formal <br/>
learning until I begin college.&quot;  A few minutes later she asked how old <br/>
she would have to be to take a political science class at a junior <br/>
college.  She was not turned off of education but public school holds no <br/>
more interest. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is what your child will do... experience it and decide it&#39;s <br/>
not for them.<br/>

&gt; as a<br/>

&gt; all the<br/>
&gt; associated fun and glamour. When &#39;mom&#39; stated that all those things could<br/>

&gt; highschool the greatest pressure was off. I don&#39;t know if there was much<br/>
&gt; residual stuff, but perhaps we might hear from &#39;mom&#39; soon...<br/>

that she should know our beliefs about school.  Isn&#39;t that part of the<br/>
information she needs to decide?  School certainly isn&#39;t going to tell<br/>
her what they&#39;re up to. ;)  I should add that she still hasn&#39;t<br/>
decided, but is leaning towards going.<br/>
 <br/>
When I had previously posted that my dd was weighing the pros and cons<br/>
of going to school on Unschooling Basics Pam wrote:<br/>
   &quot;She needs more information about the negatives of school. Could    you<br/>
    have her read a bit about school - such as an essay or two from,<br/>
    &quot;Dumbing Us Down?&quot; Or the first few chapters of, &quot;The Teenage<br/>
    Liberation Handbook?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Those books teach us that school is bad. All I&#39;m trying to do is to<br/>
counter the positive, false images she gets from all of her favorite<br/>
TV shows that show school as a fun, social place. <br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a difference between &quot;putting information into her head&quot;<br/>
and giving her valuable information.  I know what that difference is.<br/>
 Conveying the information in a way that it would be meaningful to her<br/>
is where I&#39;m stuck.  I&#39;m trying hard to not sound anti school when I<br/>
talk with her, but she&#39;s aware we&#39;d like for her to stay home.   <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh at the &quot;oncoming train&quot; quote from Sandra. Silly, but I<br/>
admit I DO feel like it&#39;s an oncoming train.  She is just so precious<br/>
to us and I worry that we didn&#39;t do enough to prepare her to resist<br/>
the pressures she&#39;ll face.<br/>
<br/>
So, if she does go to school because she has decided to, are we still<br/>
considered unschoolers?<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, dh and I have been really busy trying to make her life fun and<br/>
exciting, but she does like ALOT of activity and stimulation.</div>

<br/>
Please, please, try to disentangle the language you use on this list  <br/>
from school-speak.<br/>
<br/>
Those books don&#39;t teach us anything.  Those books present information  <br/>
and we need to read it and think.  We might learn things we didn&#39;t  <br/>
know, and we might add to things we knew something about, and we  <br/>
might see some things in those books and think &quot;That doesn&#39;t seem  <br/>
quite true to me,&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s not my experience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you rather teach her that school is bad? -=-<br/>
<br/>
In answer to that question you wrote &quot;Well, yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those who really intend to teach and defend teaching and feel that  <br/>
they are being taught about unschooling by books are looking the  <br/>
wrong direction to see unschooling clearly.  Turn and look away from  <br/>
the teaching, teaching, teaching at the quiet, limitless world  <br/>
outside of teacherville.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
There are some other ways to look at school, and choice, and choice  <br/>
is very, very important.  What the school is &quot;up to&quot; will not have  <br/>
the same effect on someone who is there by choice as it does on those  <br/>
whose parents are in collusion with the administration to keep their  <br/>
children in there despite the children&#39;s preferences, wishes or needs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-All I&#39;m trying to do is to<br/>

TV shows that show school as a fun, social place. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can be a fun, social place.<br/>
If it&#39;s not, school is probably a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, there&#39;s a difference between &quot;putting information into her  <br/>
head&quot;<br/>
and giving her valuable information. I know what that difference is.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the difference is.  She needs to bring valuable  <br/>
information in herself, not have it given to her or put into her.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m trying hard to not sound anti school when I<br/>
talk with her, but she&#39;s aware we&#39;d like for her to stay home. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Liking for her to stay home is one thing.  Is it always home?   Do  <br/>
you get out and do wonderful things on days when other kids are in  <br/>
school?  Have you taken her out of town to see things people her age  <br/>
don&#39;t usually get to see?  Is every day something to remember?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/nest">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>
but more importantly, please read<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-She is just so precious<br/>
to us and I worry that we didn&#39;t do enough to prepare her to resist<br/>
the pressures she&#39;ll face.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know for sure what kinds of pressures she will face.   You  <br/>
don&#39;t know for sure how long she&#39;ll be there.  If the relationship  <br/>
with you is good and open, she will probably talk to you about what  <br/>
happens there, whereas most of the other kids at school learned years  <br/>
ago not to take it home, not to tell any adults, just cope or stuff  <br/>
it down.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, if she does go to school because she has decided to, are we still<br/>
considered unschoolers?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some might, some won&#39;t.  What does it matter?  You don&#39;t get an  <br/>
unschooler discount at Burger King or anything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-BTW, dh and I have been really busy trying to make her life fun and<br/>

<br/>
She is entitled to a lot of activity and stimulation.  Maybe you  <br/>
could aim it more toward making all your shared lives more fun and  <br/>
exciting, instead of aiming it at her.  Some families seem to look  <br/>
for kid things to do instead of family things to do, and that can be  <br/>
a problem.<br/>

did it, and we came out of the experience with knowledge and skills we <br/>
otherwise would not have.  And I&#39;ll tell you, Janene did not learn to <br/>
read in school, in fact, I can&#39;t think of one typically educational <br/>
thing my children and I learned from that experience, but it was <br/>
certainly a valuable experience all around.  School did not destroy my <br/>
children, it did not destroy our life, it did not change how we think as <br/>
unschoolers.  I would not undo that time period, it was a good <br/>
experience and only cemented our feelings about education and life and <br/>
unschooling.  Do I want my children to go to school again?  No, I really <br/>
don&#39;t, but it may be that Janene will go to school this year, in <br/>
September.  I will do what I can to make the experience a good one for <br/>
her, we will continue to unschool through it all, and school will simply <br/>
be a place she hangs out while mom has to work.  I am trying to get her <br/>
into an alternative charter school, but if I can&#39;t do that, she will go <br/>
to a traditional school.  This is simply where we are right now in our <br/>
lives, in a few more years my children will be old enough for this not <br/>
to be an issue. But anyway, back to the original point, I just simply <br/>
have given up the idea to be the ideal anything, to be the ideal radical <br/>
unschooler, to be the ideal mommy, to be the ideal teacher.  Instead, <br/>
I&#39;m doing the best I can. I&#39;ve given up caring what other people think.<br/>
<br/>
I should say that Lexie had been talking of going to school for years.  <br/>
Each time we discussed it, pros and cons, and she would put it off, <br/>
saying maybe she would go the next year.  I always let her make the <br/>
decisions.  As a public school teacher, she knew I had real insight to <br/>
the school situation, but I always talked about the positives as well as <br/>
the negatives.  Janene also was very curious, but had also decided not <br/>
to go.  When as a family we decided that we would try school as an <br/>
answer to that problem, they both had mixed feelings but were excited to <br/>
see what it was all about.  Lexie left school gladly, it was very much a <br/>
negative experience for her.  Janene was OK with it, and will be OK with <br/>
going back. <br/>
<br/>
I do agree that children who know--well Sandra said choice, my kids <br/>
didn&#39;t really have a choice, but they knew I backed their every second.  <br/>
They could tell me everything, and KNOW, in their hearts, that I would <br/>
do what I could for them.  That gave them far more power than most kids, <br/>
over their situation.  And as we went through the experience, they also <br/>
knew that I would take them out if they really wanted it.  This power <br/>
was so important to them.  Most kids don&#39;t know there is another <br/>
option.  I teach those kids every day.  They are so brainwashed into the <br/>
process they think has to happen--grades K-12, in the proper order, <br/>
taking classes in the proper order, with every step dictated, every test <br/>
mandatory, that they don&#39;t see, don&#39;t understand, that it&#39;s all a sham.  <br/>
That there are other things they can do instead of following the &quot;steps&quot; <br/>
dictated by the school.  My kids know they can choose different paths.  <br/>
So for them, their time in school was different.  It was easier.  Lexie <br/>
would come home and laugh at the things adult staff had said or done, <br/>
because she saw the world in a different light.  It was interesting for <br/>
her to understand this, and also to hear her talk about it.  She gained <br/>
insight into the kids that weren&#39;t homeschooled and their thinking.  It <br/>
was enlightening to her and she talked  about how that experience helped <br/>
her to understand other children better. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m rambling, but I guess my main idea is that school wasn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily bad for my kids, and they came out of it educated.  Not in <br/>
the way the school would think, but not in a bad way either.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS, i just asked Lexie if she learned anything in school, clarifying it <br/>
with the words &quot;as in what the school wanted you to learn.&quot;  She said <br/>
&quot;as in the lessons?&quot;  I said yes and she thought for a long time... then <br/>
said &quot;I learned how to spell awesome.&quot;  After much more quiet thought, <br/>
she said &quot;I learned about the local Native Americans, the ones who used <br/>
to live around here.  We learned th is in two days.  But I can&#39;t <br/>
remember what I learned about them now, although I did take the test and <br/>
I did pass it.&quot;  She was quiet for a minute and then said &quot;I learned <br/>
about exponents, that I remember, it was interesting and I was good at <br/>
it.&quot; <br/>

Stefani, where do you live?  Are there other unschoolers around you?  At <br/>
the HSC Conference in a month, in Sacramento California, there are <br/>
always young adults who were homeschooled, many unschooled, who always <br/>
inspire me with their words and lives.  Spending lots of time with teen <br/>

my children will never have any problems finding a job or going to <br/>

agree it is.  But if you asked a holistic healer, she or he would have a <br/>
different opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Schooled parents HAVE to buy into the myth that diplomas will be the <br/>
answer to everything.  What choice do they have?  If they stop believing <br/>
that, then their children are wasting time in school. <br/>
<br/>
Many years ago someone explained to me that parents who were spanked as <br/>
children have to go on spanking as parents themselves.  IF they say that <br/>
spanking is wrong, then they are admitting that what their parents, whom <br/>
they love and trust, were wrong.  Many people cannot admit that their <br/>
parents would make such a wrong choice, a choice that physically and <br/>
emotionally hurt them as children and as adults, and a choice that they <br/>
are making and that perpetuates that violence on their own children.  So <br/>
they go on living the lie, hurting their own children...<br/>
<br/>
School is like that.  There is a myth that in order to be successful one <br/>
must go through the process--k-12, all the right classes, college prep, <br/>
standardized tests, scoring high, sports or other activities, etc.  then <br/>
college...  If this is all wrong, then the parents wasted their own time <br/>
in school, as their children are wasting theirs now...<br/>
<br/>
Years ago I realized that many students were being taught math, the same <br/>
math, over and over.  It was as though if we repeat a thing often enough <br/>
students who were not cognitively ready to get something would get it <br/>
anyway.  Instead, we have a lot of students who have no understanding of <br/>
math failing at higher math.  Those millions of problems they did as <br/>
children did not help them gain understanding.  It was just busy work <br/>
and memorization.  Years ago I took kids who had failed at math for <br/>
years and in two or three months taught them basic math--1st grade <br/>
through 9th grade math, without them doing hundreds of practice <br/>
problems.  I learned that if a student was ready to learn something, it <br/>
could be learned quick, without all those practice problems.  The next <br/>
step in my thinking was that if people just waited until a student was <br/>
ready to learn something and wanting to learn it, and had a reason to do <br/>
so, then maybe all that practice was unnecessary.  So, this led me to <br/>
realize--all those problems I did, every day, hundreds a week, every <br/>
week, for every grade, for 12 years--that was unnecessary.  A waste of <br/>
my time!  It was hard to admit that. <br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my point is that these parents, and their children, MUST buy <br/>
into the idea that school, graduation, college, graduation, etc. are the <br/>
ONLY way to success.  For them to accept their are alternatives that <br/>
would be less difficult for their children would make all they have done <br/>
and all their children have done, and will do, a waste of time, is too <br/>
much for them to comprehend. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; &gt; Maybe school *does* seem like a better option!&gt;I&#39;m not sure what to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>say to that because obviously that is not all that she does, and <br/>
certainly we are involved in activities with the whole family as well as <br/>
unschooling stuff when my husband is atwork.<br/>
<br/>
See, I think this bothers me...<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t unschool from 9-5.  We unschool all the time.  24 hours a day, <br/>
365 days a week.  Unschooling is how we live, it is our life.  That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t screw it up occasionally, I&#39;m still human and <br/>
learning and growing, but we live unschooling, we dont&#39; do it during <br/>
school hours. <br/>
<br/>
Have you asked your daughter what things she wants to do?  Helped her <br/>
find an interest and helped her follow up on it? <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could consider that your thinking is a little overly &quot;all  <br/>
or nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
School is really good for some kids - it gets them away from  <br/>
alcoholic parents, abusive parents, disgusting living conditions,  <br/>
and, sometimes, boring home lives. It gets them in the company of a  <br/>
lot of other kids so they have a better chance of finding friends. It  <br/>
sometimes puts them in contact with adults who mentor them in small  <br/>
or big ways. Sometimes it gives them opportunities to learn about  <br/>
things the parents would never have thought of offering - playing the  <br/>
French horn, being a flag girl with the marching band, who knows  <br/>
what? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your opinion will carry more weight if your child believes you are  <br/>
being as objective as possible - weighing all the pros and cons, not  <br/>
offering just one side in order to make your case.<br/>
<br/>
Also - if you make her argue or resist your wishes in order to go,  <br/>
she&#39;ll have something to prove and might try to stick it out long  <br/>
after she would have wanted to come home, otherwise.<br/>

Even if your state doesn&#39;t allow you to issue a diploma yourself, you  <br/>
can sign up with a private school such as Clonlara or, even better,  <br/>
