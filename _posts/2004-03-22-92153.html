<div id="ygrps-yiv-525134917"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;We discussed that Ted Neely is an actor, that they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wouldn&#39;t actually injure their actor, that Judas wasn&#39;t really hanged<br/>
(seeing him<br/>
step back on the bus was reassuring &lt;g&gt;), and that being aware of what you<br/>
can<br/>
personally handle is important.&lt;&lt;<br/>
If he liked Ted Neely he can listen to him in a recent show called<br/>
&quot;Rasputin&quot; where he plays the title role.  (I saw it at the Grand opera<br/>
house in Wilmington DE)  An excellent show (and I&#39;d say that even if my<br/>
brother Shane Gosdis weren&#39;t in it!) :)  Seriously, though the music is<br/>
great and the story touches on an extremely interesting time in Russian<br/>
History.  There&#39;s no video yet but There&#39;s a CD and a web site.<br/>
