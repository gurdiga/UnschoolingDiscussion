Digest # 2145 began a useful discussion, IMO: On unschooling,<br/>
Liza Sabater wrote &gt;&gt;&gt;This is about parents more than about kids, I<br/>
think...&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I strongly agree. Luz and I unschooled our son and send a newsletter (just<br/>
ask for it -- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nedvare@...">nedvare@...</a> ) about unschooling, and have long said that<br/>
it&#39;s the parents who need to know that they are the ones who need to   UN-<br/>
learn what they think about how children become educated. Most adults cannot<br/>
imagine a life without schooling, so when they consider homeschooling, most<br/>
of them believe that it means doing school at home.<br/>
<br/>
Children do not need to go through that change of thinking -- they simply<br/>
need to be allowed to continue what they&#39;ve been doing since they were born,<br/>
which is learning at an incredible pace how the world around them works.<br/>
From our Unschooling experience with our son, now 23, academic basics are<br/>
learned simply by being alive and involved in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
The introduction to our info packet, written by Luz, is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
What is Unschooling?<br/>
 Unschooling is trusting the learner to be in charge of his or her own<br/>
learning. It is not a method of instruction we use on our children, but a<br/>
process we adults go through to unlearn the lessons and undo the effects of<br/>
our  years of schooling.<br/>
 Schooling taught us that learning only happens in a certain place and time,<br/>
under the direction and/or force of a teacher.<br/>
 Unschooling ourselves restores our child-like curiosity. It encourages us<br/>
to trust that we are all learning all the time and that we are the experts<br/>
when it comes to choosing what, when, how, where, how much and with whom we<br/>
learn.<br/>
 Schooling taught us that our interests were unimportant, disruptive, a<br/>
waste of time, just play, not ³the real world.²<br/>
 Unschooling frees us to follow our interests wherever they lead.<br/>
