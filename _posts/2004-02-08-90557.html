<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214837655">It was just one of those days when everything goes right.  I thought <br/>
I&#39;d share. :) <br/>
<br/>
Last night Matt and Luke and I read all the library books they had <br/>
taken out.  One of them was a glow in the dark Thomas book that we <br/>
read in the closet, turning the light on to read the words and then <br/>
turning the lights off to see the stuff glow.  We ended up playing in <br/>
the closet in the dark for awhile then. <br/>
<br/>
One of the other books we read (also a Thomas book, lol) had pictures <br/>
of animals on it.  It said &quot;ZOO&quot; at the top of the page, and although <br/>
the animals pictured were all animals that could be found in a zoo, <br/>
none of the animals were pictured as being in a zoo.  Matt said to <br/>
me, &quot;Why does that say zoo?&quot;  And I just looked at him for a minute,  <br/>
because he DOESN&#39;T KNOW HOW TO READ!  I hadn&#39;t read that word to him <br/>
at all, we had just been looking at the animals. I asked him how he <br/>
knew that said zoo, and he said that in Putt Putt goes to the zoo <br/>
(computer game), they say, &quot;zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo&quot; over and over again <br/>
and flash the word on the screen.  <br/>
<br/>
Then when we ran out of books to read, Matt looked for some of our <br/>
books to read from our shelves.  This is cool for me to see, because <br/>
he didn&#39;t use to like to be read to much.  We went through most of an <br/>
I SPY book and then played connect four for awhile.  Then I <br/>
remembered that I had a Christmas I Spy book that I hadn&#39;t given them <br/>
at Christmas time (oops!) and got that out.  We did a page of that, <br/>
and then went to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning, Alisha discovered the Christmas I Spy and she started <br/>
looking at that, which caused some fighting because Matt had wanted <br/>
to finish doing it with me today.  I got him interested in finishing <br/>
the other I Spy book we had started, and then I thought how cool it <br/>
would be to make our own I spy books.  The kids loved the idea, so we <br/>
set to work on our I Spy creations.<br/>
<br/>
We took some time to clean off the top of the Thomas table, which had <br/>
been really messy.  Then we set up a cool track layout, with the <br/>
round house, engine wash, train station, water pump, and other <br/>
pieces.  Then we put engines on the track and hid little toys through <br/>
out it.  We took pictures on our digital camera and are going to head <br/>
off to Wal-mart in a few minutes to get the picture blown up to 8X10 <br/>
size.  Matt&#39;s I Spy says, &quot; I spy 2 marbles, a tire and a yellow <br/>
screw.  A black hot rod car and a number 2.  A coin from <br/>
Chuckecheese, scissors, a crayon, a lego,and 2 keys.  <br/>
<br/>
Alisha arranged stuffed animals on her bed and we hid little stuff, <br/>
much of it stuff from her Barbies or dolls, throughout them.   One of <br/>
hers says, &quot;I Spy 5 bobby pins, roses, and smokey the bear.  One of <br/>
Snow White&#39;s Dwarves, a hat, and a chair.  A watering Can, a marker, <br/>
a shovel, a shoe.  7 jacks and scooby doo.  The other says, &quot;I spy a <br/>
fancy dress and 4 lady bugs, a soccer ball, a pumpkin, and 2 mugs.  A <br/>
hanger, a bracelet, 2 dominos.  And one of the animals has a bee on <br/>
his nose!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 We made French toast for supper, and it was really fun because dh <br/>
and the boys pitched in without me asking them to.  Dh washed the <br/>
electric skillet which I had dirtied this morning and hadn&#39;t washed <br/>
yet.  The boys set the table together, Luke measured the vanilla and <br/>
cinnamon for the french toast, and the boys each soaked some bread <br/>
and put them on the skillet.  <br/>
<br/>
Now we&#39;re headed to Wal-mart (I&#39;m going to make the pictures while <br/>
Randy helps Alisha find a new basketball, which she needs because she <br/>
just signed up for basketball and has her first practice on <br/>
Wednesday).  When we get back, Matt wants to make an I Spy on his bed <br/>
with his stuffed animals and he also wants to make cookies.  Not sure <br/>
if we&#39;ll have time to do both of those tonight. Maybe!  But if not, <br/>
we&#39;ll have something to look forward to doing first thing in the <br/>
morning.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043183678"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;What are Look Alike Books?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**Here&#39;s a description from Amazon.com:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Come along! Jump aboard! Grab hold of my hand. / We&#39;re crossing the<br/>
border into Look-Alike Land.&quot; So invites the opening lines of Joan<br/>
Steiner&#39;s Look-Alikes, a three-dimensional miniature metropolis that&#39;s<br/>
meticulously, ingeniously crafted out of everyday objects from<br/>
mousetraps to milk bones. At first glance, a fancy hotel lobby seems<br/>
just that, but take a closer look and you&#39;ll see a sofa made of gloves.<br/>
In a sunny street scene, a building fa√ßade is laden with crackers,<br/>
crayons form fence posts, and the tree is shaded by a stalk of broccoli.<br/>
Children and adults alike will love poring over each picture, most of<br/>
which contain more than 100 objects cleverly arranged to delight and<br/>
deceive. &quot;<br/>
 <br/>
They are really well done and lots of fun.  If you search for Look Alike<br/>
at Amazon they&#39;ll be the first thing that comes up.  ~Rue<br/>
