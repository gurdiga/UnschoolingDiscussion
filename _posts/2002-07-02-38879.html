<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109308497">&lt;&lt;And it seemed like she should be involved in setting up and cleaning up if<br/>
she wanted to paint.  She chose not to paint.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the paraphrase, Joyce.  But I wonder....sometimes clean up isn&#39;t<br/>
about what mom wants or what her standards are, sometimes its about safety<br/>
of younger members of the house.  Things are getting better for us now with<br/>
Michelle hitting 3 soon (the most dangerous thing she does now is color on<br/>
the walls), but for awhile there with 3 kids under 5 and then the bigger<br/>
kids too, I simply didn&#39;t have time to clean up everything and make sure<br/>
everybody was safe.<br/>
<br/>
After I came in from helping Adriane do something with her goats to find<br/>
then 2 year old Michelle cutting holes in the recliner with scissors that<br/>
had been left out, it became the responsibility of who got them out to put<br/>
them away.<br/>
<br/>
After I walked into the kitchen to find then 2 yo Daniel using a buck knife<br/>
to saw through the leg on the kitchen chair, it became Zach&#39;s responsibility<br/>
to keep his knife put away when not using it.<br/>
<br/>
We have a quite large, roomy (if rather ramshackle) home that is wonderful<br/>
for a large family but the downside is that I can&#39;t be everywhere at all<br/>
times.  We have had numerous and varied discussions about how to work<br/>
together on this.  Personal responsibility is what is working well for us<br/>
currently.<br/>

<br/>
If there are no toddlers, mom insisting that art must be cleaned up &quot;because<br/>
we&#39;re supposed to&quot; isn&#39;t really understandable in terms of &quot;must&quot;. It *is*<br/>
just the way mom wants it. What will happen if it isn&#39;t cleaned up? The<br/>
house will be messy? And?<br/>
<br/>
But if there are toddlers, mom saying to the older kids &quot;If the scissors are<br/>
left out, Little Dimitri might find them and slice up the curtains,&quot; or &quot;If<br/>
the markers are left out Little Annika might color all over your trading<br/>
cards&quot; is perfectly understandable. They might still forget! But at least<br/>
they understand the reasoning behind it. There are real understandble<br/>
potential consequences to not cleaning up.<br/>
