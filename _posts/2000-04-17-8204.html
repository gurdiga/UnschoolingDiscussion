<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094223500">Commenting on the thread of the &#39;shy&#39; child.  I personally don&#39;t like the <br/>
term &#39;shy&#39;.  In my experience, a &#39;shy&#39; person is generally an introvert.  <br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with being an introvert.  But it can be important for <br/>
introverts to learn the skills that allow comfortable social interactions, <br/>
just as it can be important for extroverts to learn skills to allow them to <br/>
be comfortable by themselves or in very small groups.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the term &#39;shy&#39; because there&#39;s a sense of there being something <br/>
wrong with the child, when the only thing wrong is assuming all people should <br/>
be equally comfortable with strangers and large groups.  OTOH, if I think of <br/>
&#39;skills&#39; rather than &#39;something&#39;s wrong with the child&#39;, then I can focus on <br/>
easy ways to learn those skills, rather than forcing my child to act <br/>
extroverted when in fact she&#39;s an introvert.  My focus would be in helping <br/>
her feel confident rather than making her fit someone else&#39;s definition of <br/>
extroverted.<br/>
