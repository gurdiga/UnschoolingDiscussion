<div id="ygrps-yiv-188586371">I&#39;m still recovering a bit, so this won&#39;t be long, but I wanted to mention  a <br/>
few quick things about the Live and Learn Conference in Peabody, MA.<br/>
 <br/>
It was amazing! Very cool people everywhere you looked -- 573 of  them!!!!!!!<br/>
 <br/>
Lots of connections made, great speakers, a fun raffle (thanks to Kelly  <br/>
Lovejoy), and relatively few glitches. I got to hang out with Barbara  Sher!<br/>
 <br/>
240 people went on the WHale Watches, and no one missed the boat! (There  <br/>
was, however, some vomiting. Let&#39;s see, take lots of kids from home, have them  <br/>
stay up late and eat unfamiliar food and sleep in a strange place, then at the  <br/>
end put them in a boat on the Atlantic. What WAS I thinking??!!)  However,  <br/>
we saw whales, and that was COOL!<br/>
 <br/>
I think people had a good time, and the hotel was very happy to have  us.<br/>

This is great that we left them with a good impression of us.  And, <br/>
yes, we did have fun.  <br/>

Here&#39;s another one of those things that make you go &quot;HUH&quot;:  Take two kids<br/>
who are on a boat in the Atlantic after being in a strange place, eating<br/>
unfamiliar food and getting no sleep, who say they feel sick......THEN<br/>
listen to the advice of a well-meaning stranger who says it&#39;s not as &quot;wavy&quot;<br/>
upstairs, and send them up there.  WHAT was I thinking?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marjorie<br/>
P.S.  Sorry to anyone who got splashed, and thanks to Erika for cleaning up<br/>
upstairs while I got them downstairs and resting, and thanks to the people<br/>
who brought them water and gum.  In the confusion I don&#39;t even remember who<br/>
did what.</div>

LOL!  I was downstairs for most of the ride, and was VERY surprised at how much more &#39;wavy&#39; it is upstairs!<br/>
