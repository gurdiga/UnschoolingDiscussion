	By Melanie Shimokawa<br/>
<br/>
Mook, my two year old son, goes through phases of obsession.  Just after<br/>
his second birthday, the &quot;thing&quot; was bulldozers, cranes, power shovels,<br/>
dump trucks, etc.  Every time we would pass by a construction site, he<br/>
would go wild, pointing at the various machines and telling everyone in<br/>
the world what they were.  So we got him a couple books about heavy<br/>
machinery - perhaps a little more advanced than for a two year old, but<br/>
he liked the pictures.  Those were his favorite books, and he would ask<br/>
me or Daddy to read them to him day after day after day, several times a<br/>
day.  He soon had the books memorized word for word.  He figured out<br/>
just by looking at some of the words that c-r-a-n-e spelled crane, etc. <br/>
Aside from learning to recognize certain words, he also learned<br/>
everything there was to know about those machines, except, of course,<br/>
how to operate one.  He delighted construction workers with his<br/>
knowledge of their equipment, and actually got to sit in a power shovel<br/>
once.  <br/>
<br/>
After about three or four months, he got tired of heavy machines.  I<br/>
guess he figured he had learned everything there was for a two year old<br/>
to learn about them.  Or maybe his next obsession was more fascinating<br/>
than the first.  Trains.  By now, he knew his letters from a computer<br/>
program, and what they sounded like.  So, by the same method, when he<br/>
learned to recognize the names of trains, he was able to sound them out,<br/>
and taught himself to read, not only the words in his book, but words in<br/>
other places as well.<br/>
<br/>
A few months later, dinosaurs took over, and he can always be heard<br/>
singing dinosaur songs, or reading dinosaur books.  He still can not<br/>
read fluently.  That will come with time.  But he built his own<br/>
foundation and a love for reading.  Not because he was forced, but<br/>
because he was allowed.  He still doesn*t know what 1+1 is, and I don*t<br/>
care to teach him right now.  But his knowledge of heavy machines and<br/>
trains is amazing.<br/>

baby daughter.  i got to visit with them recently and my bil was surprised to <br/>
hear (from me, bc of you!) that homeschooling &quot;could be done&quot; in japan.   any <br/>
comment from you on the ins and outs of it there?  i would love to pass on <br/>

daycare.  i told them i had the impression it was more than that...<br/>
