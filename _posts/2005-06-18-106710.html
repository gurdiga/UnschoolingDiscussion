<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639595808">I hope nobody minds me asking these questions but it seems like the place to <br/>
ask.......<br/>
<br/>
What are your thoughts on nervous tics (twitches) in children?<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel or find in your experience that these ailments affect children <br/>
only in dysfunctional homes, or those in happy homes as well? <br/>
I&#39;m especially curious about children who have been unschooled all their <br/>
life......if this occurs.<br/>
<br/>
My theory is no to the latter and yes to the former (hope I got that right!) <br/>
but I can&#39;t be sure because I haven&#39;t ever found anyone in a &quot;happy&quot; family <br/>
who has them. That also adds to my suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a very stifling, chaotic (ie: yelling/hitting/turmoil), <br/>
manipulative home. I see some of my cousins with tics and my family says it&#39;s <br/>
genetic.........but the BEHAVIOR is what&#39;s handed down from one generation to the next <br/>
so it&#39;s hard to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
I ask this because it&#39;s been on my mind lately due to being around a troubled <br/>
young cousin (who reminds me of myself as a teen) and I look at my precious <br/>
daughter and hope she does not have to endure the torture of body wracking <br/>
twitches as I did. I pray that it&#39;s not genetic and that happiness will prevent it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, asthma.........<br/>
your thoughts?<br/>
I think it&#39;s a little bit trickier to determine since there are things like <br/>
vaccines (mercury in my childhood), food allergies perhaps undetected, <br/>
pollutants in the environment to factor in but........<br/>
I&#39;ve always seen asthma in suffocating households like mine (and don&#39;t know <br/>
others who have it well enough to know their background).<br/>
<br/>
Any input would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for reading!<br/>
<br/>

You probably should look for another cause besides a dysfunctional  family.  <br/>
Tourette Syndrome is one tic disorder that IS genetic, and can  cause the type <br/>
of &quot;body-wracking&quot; tics you describe.  <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
My son developed tics when he was 7 or 8. He was in school (and a happy  <br/>
home) at the time.  For totally different reasons we pulled him out of  school and <br/>
he was unschooled, and his tics didn&#39;t go away.  I think it&#39;s a  myth that <br/>
dysfunctional homes cause tics.  Not saying it can&#39;t happen--just  saying that <br/>
there are more logical explanations.<br/>
 <br/>
Asthma--it&#39;s an disease. Nothing about the way children are treated by  their <br/>
parents causes it.  You mentioned environmental factors.  I&#39;d go  with those.<br/>

<br/>
Well, my son was a shirt-chewer and before that a thumb-sucker.  Do you mean something like that, or something even more nervous?<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, thumb-sucking is common, and sucking is a natural soothing method for children.  I&#39;ve known a couple of shirt-chewers, so it doesn&#39;t seem too far out to me.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to say, &quot;sure it happens in happy homes&quot;, but then I remembered that the last year of shirt chewing here overlapped with when my husband lost his job and we moved.  (But there was some chewing prior to that.)  I believe that unhappy homes with tension and nagging, especially nagging about the nervous habit, can make the nervous habit stronger or longer.)<br/>

re: asthma, there has been some unusual research that if the maternal grandmother smokes when pregnant, she can damage her daughters eggs (before she is born) and increase the risk of grandchildren having asthma.<br/>
<br/>
But it is also possible to go to far in blaming disease on parenting styles.  Remember autism used to be considered the mother&#39;s fault.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594099355">Hi Amy<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about asthma, but I&#39;ve experienced tics, when we went through <br/>
an extremely stressful time a couple of years ago. I know what the stress <br/>
felt like. It felt like hot glue being poured over my neck and head, and the <br/>
glue containing a hundred bees that were buzzing and struggling. I developed <br/>
a tic in my neck, so that I did these little shrugs. It was pretty awful, <br/>
and it went away when I let go of having to solve every single smidgen of <br/>
the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you won&#39;t need to worry about your kids, if they aren&#39;t in a bad, <br/>
stressful environment, which is what your childhood home sounds like. <br/>
Chaotic? yeah, that could bring stress. If you&#39;re not raising your kids in a <br/>
chaotic house, they might not ever be twitchy or have tics. My kids haven&#39;t <br/>
ever had twitches or tics, and we&#39;ve only been unschooling for three years, <br/>
but our house is mostly relaxed and not chaotic in a bad way.<br/>

==========<br/>
 <br/>
While I don&#39;t know the whole answer I did want to make the reminder that  <br/>
happiness helps LOTS of physical situations, from the flu to cancer.   Unhappy, <br/>
scared people who feel unsafe and aren&#39;t so sure they WANT to live are  less <br/>
likely to get well than people who are hopeful and calm and  cheery.   I think <br/>
that&#39;s proven nine ways from Sunday (but maybe it&#39;s  an evil plot perpetrated <br/>
by floral shops).<br/>
 <br/>
My friend with the worst facial tics I&#39;ve ever seen had them get worse over  <br/>
time, and her life was a BUNDLE of stress, and she never seemed to find or <br/>
want  to find stress-reducing tools.  She seemed to enjoy the frustration and  <br/>
martyrdom and sorrow.  Things were dark in her life and hopeless and she  kind <br/>
of enjoyed that scramble from the bottom, to stay just out of the  crocodiles&#39; <br/>
mouths without much desire to climb all the way up to the top of the  jungle&#39;s <br/>
canopy and let the sun hit her.   She was unmarried,  childless, and bought <br/>
fully into all the angst and emotion of her  relatives.    Not healthy.  Tic <br/>
got worse and worse.   (Anecdotal only, but with enough dozens or hundreds of <br/>
anecdotes, you get  &quot;data.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=-Also, asthma.........<br/>
your thoughts?<br/>
.....<br/>
I&#39;ve always seen asthma in suffocating households like mine (and don&#39;t know  <br/>
others who have it well enough to know their background).-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Two asthma stories close enough to me that I&#39;ve held the inhaler and been  <br/>
watching for symptoms and emergency need.   Both the least-favored  child from <br/>
stress-filled suffocating households. Doesn&#39;t prove anything except  I&#39;m 51, <br/>
have been paying attention, and have no stories to refute your  ideas.<br/>

 <br/>
I think it&#39;s a condition, not a disease.  It&#39;s not contagious, and it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t go away.  Condition.<br/>
 <br/>
If stress can bring on an asthma attack, and the problem with asthma is the  <br/>
attacks, the the way children are treated CAN bring on attacks.<br/>
 <br/>
Someone can have a bad heart, but if he never has a heart attack, it&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;under control.&quot;  Someone can have asthma but if she can figure out how to  avoid <br/>
the attacks, it&#39;s &quot;under control.&quot;  <br/>

Muscle tics, I think she meant.  Facial twitches.  <br/>

Marty and Holly both sucked the center front of t-shirts.  I think  Holly did <br/>
it because Marty did and she&#39;s always thought he was super-cool.  &lt;g&gt;  I just <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
What she described sounded more to me like the kind of tics one gets with a  <br/>
neurological tic disorder.  She used the term &quot;body-wracking&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;genetic&quot;--both of which can apply to Tourette Syndrome and other tic  disorders.  It&#39;s <br/>
illogical that homelife doesn&#39;t have an effect--but I&#39;d  rule out known <br/>
disorders, too.  It&#39;s not like the homelife is going to  change just on her say-so <br/>
anyway.  If it&#39;s a known disorder, and her house  is happy and  peaceful, it&#39;s <br/>
wise to know if it&#39;s TS or something like  it--because dysfunctional home is <br/>
already ruled out.  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
If stress can bring on an asthma attack, and the problem with asthma is  the  <br/>
attacks, the the way children are treated CAN bring on  attacks.<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
But it&#39;s not the only thing that brings on attacks--so don&#39;t automatically  <br/>
assume, in your peaceful and happy home, that your children will get asthma in  <br/>
the absence of the condition.  <br/>
 <br/>
A person with a bad heart has heart &quot;disease&quot;, even without a heart  attack.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993541592">Sorry for the confusion.....<br/>
<br/>
I meant facial/body tics (like blinking, grimacing, shrugging, body jerks <br/>
etc.) and vocal tics (not cursing).<br/>
I was never diagnosed with Tourette&#39;s and I had been to lots of doctors.<br/>
<br/>
It has resolved itself pretty much but sometimes when I&#39;m under stress it <br/>
returns slightly in a much more subdued manner (neck cracking and such).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been really interesting reading all of your feedback!<br/>
I appreciate the responses and look forward to reading any more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800574052">Hi Amy:  My name is Renee and I am 42.  I have had a head tremor since I was 27.  It gets worse<br/>
when I&#39;m under any kind of stress.  I&#39;ve been to numerous Dr.&#39;s and they have only been able to<br/>
diagnose me with Dystonia (which means tremor).  At about the age of 4 we noticed our youngest son<br/>
was starting to have a sort of tick.  It was most prominent when he was playing video games.  I<br/>
took him to a pediatric neurologist and he assured me he would grow out of it.  Well I was sure he<br/>
had what I have.  It got better and then when he was around 12-13 we noticed it again.  He&#39;s now<br/>
15 and it seems to have gone away.  <br/>
<br/>
I never understood because they told me that my tremor is inherited but they assured me his is<br/>
not.  Right now he is without it and I pray if it&#39;s God&#39;s will he never has it again.  <br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you,<br/>

I meant  facial/body tics (like blinking, grimacing, shrugging, body jerks <br/>
etc.)  and vocal tics (not cursing).<br/>
I was never diagnosed with Tourette&#39;s and I  had been to lots of doctors.<br/>
<br/>

Sounds just like Tourette Syndrome to me.  Blinking is usually the  first tic <br/>
that develops.  One has to have developed two motor tics and one  vocal tic <br/>
(not at the same time) to be considered TS.  Lots of doctors  don&#39;t know the <br/>
criteria, and they assume that a cursing tic is one of the  markers.  Very few <br/>
people with TS have a vocal tic that requires  cursing--it&#39;s just a stereotype <br/>
fostered by the media.  The book &quot;Icy  Sparks&quot; is about a girl with TS, and <br/>
the way it is described in the book is  totally outside my experience and <br/>
reading about folks with the disorder,  although it can appear that way to people <br/>
who don&#39;t understand it.  The  author clearly didn&#39;t understand it.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not a bad, horrible thing to have TS.  It&#39;s just nice to know it  has a <br/>
name when looking for ways to adapt.  And it&#39;s highly genetic, so if  it runs <br/>
in your family, it runs in your family--whether or not there are bad  family <br/>
dynamics.  It can get worse around puberty and then taper off during  <br/>
adulthood.  It&#39;s a lifelong condition, though.  My 20 yo son with  TS says he has very <br/>
few bothersome tics now (I haven&#39;t seen him in some  time, but last time I did <br/>
he was scrunching his nose a lot).  <br/>
 <br/>
The thing that concerns me the most about my son having TS is the possible  <br/>
comorbid development of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which happens to a <br/>
number  of people with TS.  Having severe OCD is not a happy way to live.  <br/>

It seems  like a lot of theorizing in the absence<br/>
of data going on - unless I missed  a post or two - perfectly possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was a theoretical question in the first place, so that&#39;s fine.<br/>
It&#39;s all we can really do on a list like this is share data and  <br/>
possibilities and ideas.<br/>
