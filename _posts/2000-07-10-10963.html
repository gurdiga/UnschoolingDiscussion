<div id="ygrps-yiv-192947419">I just got back from spending the day at Jury Duty, that lovely American <br/>
thing they don&#39;t tell you about when you are emmigrating to the US.  It was <br/>
quite interesting actually and gave me a lot of time to catch up on my <br/>
reading... Steve took the day off work and become househubbie and SAHD for <br/>
the day and he and both kids loved it.  Zak still had his playdate and that <br/>
was even more exciting for him.<br/>
<br/>
While there I read &quot;Deschooling our Lives&quot; edited by Matt Hern... I was <br/>
tempted to turn the cover back so no one could see the title but instead held <br/>
open the book proudly.  The man sitting next to me asked if it was some sort <br/>
of new school that was starting in Tucson.  Where to begin explaining.  I <br/>
said &quot;no it&#39;s about a form of homeschooling&quot;  He said &quot;oh my sister <br/>
homeschools her kids, they love it and seem to be doing great&quot; so we then got <br/>
into this conversation about the difference between homeschooling and <br/>
unschooling.  What a pleasure it was...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure many of you have read this book (if not all)... I just loved it and <br/>
didn&#39;t even get to start reading &quot;The Unschooling Handbook&quot; again as planned.<br/>
<br/>
Off to have a bath with the kids as they seem to not miss me at the moment <br/>
and I&#39;d like my presense felt!!<br/>
