&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve had this experience as well, and I don&#39;t disagree. However, in my <br/>
personal life I&#39;ve begun to wonder if this doesn&#39;t add up to eletism in some <br/>
ways. I know that sometimes newcomers come along who are great, naturals at the <br/>
subject at hand.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re really good, they move to the front of the line and people listen <br/>
to their ideas.<br/>
<br/>
With the combo of consensus and cult of personality (kind of), if the people <br/>
who have earned status in the group by their own work and usefulness think the <br/>
newcomer has a good idea, that&#39;s double points for the newcomer.<br/>
<br/>
But if someone new had to earn the respect of over 50% of individuals in the <br/>
group to even be heard, that wouldn&#39;t be as clear and good for me (for my <br/>
tastes) as being immediately useful (by having a usefully good idea) is.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone comes here with a great suggestion and posts it, it&#39;s great the <br/>
moment someone reads it and thinks &quot;Wow! That will make my life better!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here we don&#39;t even need consensus.  It&#39;s a big potluck, and if I put down <br/>
brownies with cashews, anyone who picks one up and eats it has GOT IT!<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes to our potluck just to put a turd in the lemonade, lots of <br/>
people will object.   That&#39;s not useful.<br/>
<br/>
Me: -=-With consensus, only good ideas are even heard, and a great idea just <br/>
jumps up and moves people.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Elitism in what way?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Elitism&quot; meaning what, in either that sample context or in the context of a <br/>
list like this?<br/>
