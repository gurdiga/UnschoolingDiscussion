<div id="ygrps-yiv-627313313">&lt;&lt; Nothing came up for the 17th but I tried the 18th and found them.  This<br/>
<br/>
would be a fun wedding to attend. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry!!! I just glanced at the weekend, but sure enough (and <br/>
unnaturally) the wedding was on Sunday.  I&#39;m such a dope to give bad info to so many <br/>
people.  VERY sorry.<br/>
<br/>
