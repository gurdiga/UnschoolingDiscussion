<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286462119">Has anyone used or heard of others who have used the Teach Your Baby to<br/>
Read  program as promoted by Glenn Doman?  I have a friend whoo is<br/>
really into it.  On the one hand it sounds perfect for unschoolers (in<br/>
that if the window is there, why not teach them to read really early adn<br/>
then you can totally step back and let them have at the world of the<br/>
written word) and on the other it flies in the face of so much that I<br/>
believe and have read in John Holt and Joseph Chilton Peirce and even<br/>
Rudolph Steiner (these guys seem to think that developmentally kids are<br/>
not ready in terms of brain development to take on reading before the<br/>
age of at least 7 and maybe not until 10+).  Just wondering what the<br/>
group thinks of the idea of there being this window in which kids can<br/>
really learn reading very early with out much &quot;teaching&quot; (just showing<br/>
them the words and saying what it is).  I followed some of the early<br/>
reading posts and it sounds like this is more or less how some of the<br/>
very early readers did it (the grandfather with the 2nd grade education<br/>
writing the words in his stories for the child to see).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the earlier posts in relation to my latest anxiety about my<br/>
10yo still not reading.  It was so helpful to hear once again relax,<br/>
trust and get out of her way!  It is so hard to keep the faith sometimes<br/>
and your gentle reminders were just what I needed.  I may nbeed them<br/>
again in a few months when I have another bout of doubt!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472415432">Hi! I know, I&#39;m new and I&#39;ve got a story about everything:) But my <br/>
mom used that program on my sister and me. I remember growing up in a <br/>
house where everything had a lable on it. The ironing board <br/>
said &quot;ironing board&quot; the refrigerator said &quot;refrigerator&quot; and so on. <br/>
My mom, who has a masters in education and one in library science and <br/>
a PhD in Systems analysis, did not want us to be ruined by the school <br/>
system so she made sure we were reading before we got there. I do not <br/>
ever remember learning to read. Both my sister and I are bibliophiles <br/>
to the max. I got in trouble when the Kindergarten teacher took us to <br/>
the library and I took out The Black Stallion. She made me read the <br/>
first page out loud in front of everyone. So I did. So... I can tell <br/>
you that the program does work ...for some people. <br/>
   I do not use the same method with my children. I do have large <br/>
print things around for them to look at and we read out loud a lot, <br/>
and write together if they want to but I don&#39;t have to save them from <br/>
being ruined in public school so I do not push it at all. I have one <br/>
son who learned to read at 9, and one who is getting it at 10. My <br/>
mom, who does agree with homeschooling in general and unschooling in <br/>
particular (she gets on my case if I fall into structure traps), <br/>
cannot see why I do not just do it the way she did. I would say that <br/>
if you do it like a game and they enjoy it and you don&#39;t mind the <br/>
idea of them making fun of you when they are grown up ( my sister and <br/>
I do that to our mom ) then go for it. Just don&#39;t make it a chore for <br/>
them or you!!<br/>

so, then why would an adult need to teach a child to read before they have<br/>

They do learn to read.  Wonderfully, naturally, happily.<br/>

<br/>
This society emphasizes the connection between learning and reading way too<br/>
much. If you eliminate school, then there&#39;s little reason for young children<br/>
to read. (Unless they want to, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
What we need more than early readers, is an appreciation of how children<br/>
learn in *other* ways and how, especially, young children learn. Fantasy<br/>
play, hands on, full body movements are all things that little kids are<br/>
generally really good at that adults are generally less good at. But we tend<br/>
to judge the quality of children&#39;s learning by how well they are doing what<br/>
adults do well. If we used the same logic and judged adults by how well they<br/>
were using childlike learning tools, they&#39;d all be sent off for remedial<br/>
work in play ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A child can&#39;t &quot;be taught&quot; to read before he or she is able to read.  Period.  <br/>
You  can&#39;t teach a child before he&#39;s ready to get it any more than you can <br/>
teach an eight month old to walk if his natural walking-time is going to be <br/>
twelve or fourteen months.<br/>
<br/>
We could write here &#39;Why not teach him to walk really early and then you can <br/>
totally step back and not have to carry him around anymore&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
But moms SHOULD carry their kids around, even after they can walk.  And they <br/>
SHOULD talk to their kids and show them pictures and read to them even after <br/>
they can read, no matter how old they are when they learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
There is vastly more information outside of books than inside.  Why settle <br/>
for a book when the real world is at hand?  Why settle for a book describing <br/>
the Mississippi river in words when you can see video of journeys up and down <br/>
the Mississippi, of cities on it, of River Boats, and of the fish and plants <br/>
in the river, and of how it freezes in Minneapolis, and...  some things <br/>
aren&#39;t in books.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d like to add a few comments to Sandra&#39;s:  Children can be taught <br/>
to recognize words, but the comprehension needed to understand the <br/>
words is usually not developed in very young children.  Comprehension <br/>
skills are built as a child grows and develops, through experiences <br/>
and interaction with people and his environment.<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;hot&quot; can be recognized by a young child, but unless the <br/>
child has an understanding of what &quot;hot&quot; is or means, the recognition <br/>
is just a parrot-like ability.  If a child recognizes a word, can <br/>
they recognize and know it outside the context in which it was <br/>
learned?  A child may be able to recognize a string of words in a <br/>
sentence, and *read* them aloud, but still have no comprehension of <br/>
the complete thought or meaning of those words. <br/>
<br/>
Recognizing words and understanding the meaning of the words are two <br/>
different things.<br/>

words is usually not developed in very young children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s that and also the problem of &quot;reading&quot; a few selected words being <br/>
transferred to reading any and all words.<br/>
<br/>
Different children decode language different ways, and until they come to the <br/>
point where they are (as an individual intellect) ready to do that decoding, <br/>
whatever method the parent chooses might be the entirely wrong thing, and it <br/>
could end up interfering with their child&#39;s own personal understanding.<br/>
<br/>
That probably sounds stupid to newer homeschoolers, or to someone who hasn&#39;t <br/>
yet really seen a child grasp something difficult and multi-facetted.<br/>
<br/>
For a tiny analogy, someone told about shoe-tying in something I read last <br/>
night (so either on this list, or the two others I&#39;m on, or at <br/>
www.unschooling.com, I don&#39;t know where).  The kid tried to learn, the <br/>
parents tried to teach, then there was a period of velcro, and without the <br/>
parents knowing, the child learned to tie her next pair of laced shoes.  The <br/>
toddler brother knew she could tie them, but the parents didn&#39;t until they <br/>
saw them tied!<br/>
<br/>
Tying shoes requires a few things.  The ability to remember a series of <br/>
motions, the fine-motor coordination to hold the laces between various <br/>
combinations of fingers and still manipulate them, the strength to do all <br/>
that, the spatial reasoning to figure out how long a loop to stick where and <br/>
how hard to pull to keep from pulling the whole loop through, or from having <br/>
a piece hanging down to trip on.  <br/>
<br/>
Some kids cannot do all those things.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids happen to be shown a series of tricks or motions or a little rhyme <br/>
just at the time when they ARE capable of remembering.  Some find the desire <br/>
to tie a bow even when they themselves have velcro or elastic pull-on shoes, <br/>
and they&#39;ll ask or watch and figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Same with reading, but there are vastly more components.<br/>
<br/>
You can frustrate a child to tears by trying to &quot;teach&quot; her to tie shoes <br/>
before she physically or mentally CAN tie shoes.  You can make a child feel <br/>
stupid by pressing her to the failure point.  You can make a child feel a <br/>
burden if you insist on tie-up shoes for a child who can&#39;t tie her own, and <br/>
then you roughly and grumpily tie her shoes for her every day (or several <br/>
times a day) indicating verbally or non-verbally that you cannot understand <br/>
why she can&#39;t learn to tie her own.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what parents risk doing when they &quot;teach reading.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you wait until the child is asking and WANTS to read, and answer just <br/>
single little questions, but continue being willing to read to her (and to <br/>
tie her shoes when you&#39;re in a hurry or when she&#39;s hungry or tired), you <br/>
build something vastly more important than her skills.  You build create a <br/>
relationship full of trust and love and peace and patience.<br/>
<br/>
Without that relationship, unschooling and learning won&#39;t be as joyous as <br/>
they could be, and if you&#39;re not going to have joy in your relationship with <br/>
your child, what&#39;s the point of having them home?  <br/>
<br/>
Radical, maybe, but workable too.<br/>

Everything he has learned has so obviously been on his own schedule and no <br/>
one elses. Jon and I have often wondred how he can possibly learn certain <br/>
things without ever practicing first (like riding a bike) but he does.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not that he can just *do* things. He tried learning to ride a <br/>
2-wheeler bike at 5/6 at my suggestion. Not a disaster, but also did not <br/>
happen. We left it completely alone for a year. One day he came to me and <br/>
said &quot;okay I&#39;ve thought about it enough now, I&#39;m going to go teach myself <br/>
the 2-wheeler.&quot; About 15 minutes later he called me out to watch him ride <br/>
away. He swears that he learns by watching and thinking, even physical <br/>
things. I believe him!<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m practicing patience (waiting to exhale?) about his writing. Or <br/>
should I say lack of writing? Although he&#39;s been doing some chatting online <br/>
(wonderful!) lately, he still finds it almost painful to try to write with <br/>
pen in hand. He has always avoided it like the plague. Not a problem, I am <br/>
his joyful scribe when necessary, but I&#39;m thinking it will work itself out <br/>
like other roadblocks he has encountered.<br/>
<br/>
We got a form to fill out last week so he could do some volunteer work. I <br/>
offered to fill it out for him, he said &quot;no, I can do it once we get home.&quot; <br/>
Huh?! It&#39;s not due till tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait to see if it works like the <br/>
bike riding and he just fills the form out. Of course if it doesn&#39;t, all is <br/>
still well. I&#39;ll happily fill it out and drive him down to volunteer. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557745335">There are potential risks in too-early reading instruction. We don&#39;t <br/>
really understand the brain&#39;s development well enough to play around <br/>
with it like that. What might be okay for one baby might be damaging <br/>
(neurologically) to another. It is thought that the massive increase in <br/>
reading disabilities among American schoolchildren might be a direct <br/>
result of pushing down the reading curriculum into early grades, <br/>
kindergarten, and preschool.<br/>
<br/>
There are clearly some advantages to later reading - after years of <br/>
close observation it is very obvious to me that kids who began reading <br/>
for themselves a bit later than other kids have superior listening <br/>
skills and a better sense of the many other ways to take in information.<br/>
<br/>
I think that for some people the baby early-reading stuff gives them a <br/>
way to interact with their babies  (flashcards, etc.) - and that they <br/>
just kind of feel the need for something structured for some reason. <br/>
But tying that to reading instruction is a bad idea, imo, because one <br/>
thing we do know is that we adults can REALLY mess up a child&#39;s natural <br/>
desire and ability to read. Why risk it?<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in the opposite point of view - that we are all <br/>
&quot;degeniusing&quot; our kids by not exposing them to systematic formal <br/>
learning processes before the age of 3, have a look at this <br/>
homeschooling-related website: <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/forbidden_area/early.html">http://www.geocities.com/forbidden_area/early.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One thing not addressed there is another reason I also think it is <br/>
risky to engage in the early learning stuff  - that is because it <br/>
promotes the idea of our babies as products that we are developing. It <br/>
is pretty difficult in some communities to avoid buying into that, to <br/>
some degree, and &quot;building better babies&quot; is a bad start.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216107890">Me too, these days. I never was any good at penmanship (got an &quot;N&quot; - <br/>
needs to improve - pretty much every report card).<br/>
<br/>
I got WAY better suddenly, at about 35 years old - it just clicked and <br/>
my handwriting got nice and even and pretty and smooth and it was easy <br/>
to write. (too bad that happened AFTER all those years of college and <br/>

<br/>
Now it is harder for me to write because it just hurts my hands - which <br/>
are much more used to typing on a keyboard than holding a pen.<br/>

So I have a cute little iBook - it fits in a bag that I use as a purse <br/>

My handwriting still is the pits. And I&#39;m 45. You still think I have time to<br/>
click?<br/>
<br/>
My handwriting story goes like this:<br/>
In first grade we were obliged to write our name and address until such a<br/>
time as the teacher, tyrant that she was, deemed our handwriting (printing<br/>
actually) sufficient.  I was with the crowd who didn&#39;t get it right the<br/>
first few times. I was with the crowd who didn&#39;t get it right after 10 or 15<br/>
times. I was with the crowd that was still writing it in January,  March,<br/>
and finally I was with just my self, writing the same lines, having my paper<br/>
held up and the teacher showing it off with a BIG FAT F, as obsolutely<br/>
horrible.  Talk about shame and embarrassment! <br/>
<br/>
If I had been less of a stubborn girl, perhaps she would have reined me in;<br/>
but I gave as much as she did, and in the end I know my handwriting stunk.<br/>
All my letters were practiacally engraved into the desk, I wrote so hard and<br/>
black.  And of course my handwriting didn&#39;t get any better.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, when I was in fifth or sixth grade my grandmother offered my sister<br/>
and I a gift if we could get an A in handwriting. My sister always had nice<br/>
handwriting. I was getting D&#39;s or worse. But I worked hard, and got a B.  I<br/>
was so heartbroken.  Worse still, my sister got an A, but my grandmother<br/>
didn&#39;t come through on her part of the bargin.<br/>
<br/>
What is with adults anyway?  <br/>

 <br/>
Me too, these days. I never was any good at penmanship (got an &quot;N&quot; - <br/>
needs to improve - pretty much every report card).<br/>
<br/>
I got WAY better suddenly, at about 35 years old - it just clicked and <br/>
my handwriting got nice and even and pretty and smooth and it was easy <br/>
to write. (too bad that happened AFTER all those years of college and <br/>
grad school).<br/>
<br/>
Now it is harder for me to write because it just hurts my hands - which <br/>
are much more used to typing on a keyboard than holding a pen.<br/>
<br/>
So I have a cute little iBook - it fits in a bag that I use as a purse <br/>
- and I don&#39;t use pen or pencil much anymore. But I &quot;write&quot; a lot!!!<br/>

snip&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;the idea of there being this window in which kids can<br/>
really learn reading very early with out much &quot;teaching&quot; (just showing<br/>

then the majority of young children in America would be reading on their<br/>
own.  We are surrounded by words and kids see them and hear them read all<br/>
the time.  Signs, picture books, labels on food, movie titles, etc.  Why<br/>
aren&#39;t they all reading?  Because most of them aren&#39;t ready.  Therefore, I<br/>
would suggest there is not a window for very early reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286590045">Hi! I am new to this list but had to chime in here. My ten year old and I struggled (she is my first of three) with riding a bike. I was so hung up on the &quot;norms&quot; and watching all of the other kids in the neighborhood ride away on their bikes. I gave up trying to teach her at age 8 and put the bike away. Last summer she decided it was time to bring the bike out and learn. She taught herself and is enjoying the bike like crazy now. I cant believe what I learn from her everyday. If only I had known this earlier, the struggles I could have prevented. I feel so badly for my first child because the other children benefit so much from the mistakes I make with the first!

Just bought Heather a proper bike (as opposed too Crappy Bikes R Us one). Can&#39;t wait till she&#39;s strong enough to come on all day rides with me. I&#39;ve been teaching her road safety in the neighbourhood.<br/>
She&#39;s still a bit nervous and tends to swerve in towards the kerb when she hears a car. Unfortunately our neighbourhood isa  dead end. the only way in and out is the 6 lane super-fast Rt 7 with<br/>
sub-standard width lanes. There are, of course, no sidewalks either....<br/>
I cycle up and down it reguarly but I don&#39;t want to take a 10 yo out on it.<br/>
Anyhow, thats a problem for next week. This weeks task is finding a cycle helemt that will fit on her head with her dreadlocks. VA law states people under 14 must wear a  lid. Didn&#39;t have too back home.<br/>

kids are coming with me. Then I have to get out the polluto-mobile.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. We talked about this. My dad just really has this thing about how school <br/>
taught him discipline. He is a very disciplined guy (retired air force reserves)<br/>
and was a perpetual student...worked his way through his electrical engineering  <br/>
degree, went back and got his industrial engineering masters, almost got his PhD<br/>
(finished the class work, but not the dissertation). Later got his CPA. He has told<br/>
me that he can see how smart Jason is and has no doubt that he will learn things<br/>
easily that interest him. But he is concerned because he sees that there are certain<br/>
things (like writing and math drills) that are not &quot;fun&quot; but are necessary. I tried <br/>
to explain that if they are necessary then Jason will see a need to learn them when<br/>
he needs them. He just does not see it and it bothers him that I do not &quot;make&quot; Jason<br/>
do things (not just school work...he thinks that I let him &quot;get away&quot; with a lot of things).<br/>
<br/>
I just realized the other day that part of the problem is that my dad has no idea what I am<br/>
doing as far as &quot;school&quot;. He asked Jason what he was studying, places he had gone etc <br/>
and Jason did not understand what he wanted to know (since we do not &quot;do&quot; school). I have<br/>
decided to send a monthly (or so) email to both my parents and my ILs (who are very accepting of<br/>
what we are doing so far) detailing all the great things that Jason has been learning and<br/>
doing (books we are reading, his current interests, some of the experiments he loves to do etc). <br/>
I figure that it should not be too hard as it is just *so* cool all the neat stuff he is into.<br/>
And it will probably put my dad&#39;s fears to rest. He asks me what we are doing when we talk, but<br/>
often I can&#39;t think of any specific thing off the top of my head (mainly because we are just<br/>
living life, not doing school!).<br/>

disciplined, then why isn&#39;t everyone disciplined?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it more likely, since only some people come out of school disciplined,<br/>
that being disciplined is part of his personality? School didn&#39;t provide the<br/>
opportunity to become disciplined, but the opportunity to do something that<br/>
he got satisfaction out of: gaining new skills through hard work. The<br/>
satisfaction didn&#39;t grow from nothing by being made to do something. The<br/>
desire was already there. School just provided the opportunity to satisfy<br/>
it.<br/>
