<div id="ygrps-yiv-308686218">Had to share today&#39;s experience :)<br/>
  <br/>
  It was a small thing..but yet a &quot;milestone&quot; for ME!  <br/>
I watched my 6 yr old daughter leave the house and go with her brother to the <br/>
library,which is right by our house.<br/>
  <br/>
  The MILESTONE is.....She wore the outfit she had on and I didn&#39;t say a <br/>
thing!  <br/>
It was a LONG sleeve, cranberry colored, VELVET top and skirt..in 80 DEGREE, <br/>
HUMID weather!  (It was a cute outfit for the right season! &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)<br/>
  <br/>
   But you know, she felt beautiful and loved what she had on...and so be it!<br/>
<br/>
  I honestly think..if I hadn&#39;t been unschooling...and learning to really <br/>
trust my children and go with what&#39;s in their hearts, I never would have allowed <br/>
her to leave the house unless she changed her clothes. <br/>
  <br/>
  It feels so good....this wonderful FREEDOM ....it&#39;s hard to express...yet <br/>
it affects every single part of my life.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve learned so much from this list..and still learning &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks !<br/>

Hooray for you! :o)<br/>

When my (now 20 year old) daughter was small (about 6) she had an old gray <br/>
flannel skirt with a pink poodle on it that she wanted to wear EVERY DAY.  I&#39;d <br/>
try to wash it and she&#39;d pull it out of the dirty clothes hamper and put it on <br/>
whenever we&#39;d go someplace.  She loved that skirt for close to a year.  <br/>
<br/>
Then her sister (2 years younger) fell in love with it and I went through the <br/>
same thing with her.  Plus she&#39;d always want to wear these little red patent <br/>
leather shoes with it, and a non-matching top.  I&#39;m so glad I let them wear it <br/>
without fussing.  I can still picture that tiny little girl rummaging through <br/>
the clothes hamper!<br/>

costume--zips up, with a dragon face head--kind of<br/>
like fuzzy pajammas.  She wears this often everywhere<br/>
for weeks on end, with me washing it at night so it<br/>
can be ready for the next day.  I have been amazed<br/>

lets their kids do that...&quot;  It has renewed my faith<br/>
in humanity ;)<br/>

Marty had a tiger suit.  Didn&#39;t have the head part, just the zip-up <br/>
tiger-print body.  He wore it summer and winter for a year or so, when he was three.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443551213">For some reason my two year old has a fascination with wearing his  <br/>
8yo brother&#39;s shoes.  As soon as he gets home he takes off his and <br/>
puts on his brother&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day we went to Home Depot and he walked all over the store <br/>
with his big brother&#39;s shoes. It was hilarious!  And lots of people <br/>
thought so too.  <br/>
<br/>
Some couldn&#39;t seem to figure out what was wrong with that picture! <br/>
They knew something was off but couldn&#39;t put their finger on it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238549839">Our friend&#39;s 6.5 year old son had lived in a Red Power Ranger&#39;s outfit<br/>
for the past couple of years. I hadn&#39;t seen in lately, but this<br/>
weekend, he presented it to my 4 year old Becky, whose favorite color<br/>
is red :-)<br/>
<br/>
It was quite an ordeal... he came to her, bearing the folded suit in<br/>
both arms, and quite firmly said, &quot;I&#39;ve gotten too big to wear this,<br/>
so now I want it to be yours. You can have it. To KEEP.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She was thrilled, and has been running around for four days now,<br/>
crossing her arms and them throwing them out like lightening,<br/>
hollering, &quot;POWER MORPH... T-REXXXXX!&quot;<br/>

Maybe you should consider packing it up and giving it back to him someday.  <br/>
When he&#39;s 18, or has a baby or something. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend&#39;s dad made her a kid-sized medieval knight&#39;s helm.  When it was too <br/>
small for her, she gave it to us for Kirby to wear. NO WAY.   My dad was <br/>
already dead at that time, and I had known her parents since before she was born.<br/>
<br/>
Last year we gave it back to her as a college graduation gift.  She&#39;s 23 or <br/>
so.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad used to make lots of armor and doesn&#39;t so much anymore.  I&#39;m glad we <br/>
didnt&#39; let kids bang it up and let it get rusty.<br/>

There&#39;s nothing more adorable than a 2 yo walking around in too-big cowboy  <br/>
boots and shorts.<br/>
