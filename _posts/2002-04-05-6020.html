&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever seen a bluebird. <br/>
  Are they more common in other parts of the countr &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess so. We get bluebirds regularly from April through June...I guess they <br/>
just pass through on their way north. The Eastern Bluebirds are what we get <br/>
here in Pensacola...pretty little things. They have a rust colored breast, <br/>
which surprised me when we moved here. I&#39;d pictured them all blue I guess!<br/>
They&#39;re really great to see, a very intense blue against the landscape.<br/>
We also have some wonderful water fowl....Great Blue Herons and of course <br/>
oodles of Pelicans.<br/>
We&#39;ve seen an Indigo Bunting (that is one incredible bird), loads of <br/>
cardinals, snowy white egrets, Eastern Chickadees, a few Grosbeaks with red, <br/>
white and black ( can&#39;t remember the name), Red bellied woodpeckers, etc....<br/>
Lately I&#39;m hearing an owl behind the house....really cool.<br/>
It sounds like a jungle here in the morning because of all the birds!! VERY <br/>
loud.<br/>
I love watching birds, we have feeders spread around the house.<br/>
It&#39;s especially endearing to watch Sierra following Daddy around to fill them <br/>
all up.<br/>
He&#39;s the big birder in the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-966619935">Just HAD to jump in on the pet topic!!  We have a mini-poodle/pug mix.  Looks <br/>
kind of like a Cairn Terrier.  His name is Archie.  Very needy.  Wants to be <br/>
my ankle bone!!  Jumpy like a JR and talks in moans, whines, and barks quite <br/>
a bit.  Our other dog is the *greatest*.  Baxter is a medium-sized Boston <br/>
Terrier.  They come in small, med, and lg.  Small is about 10-12 pounds.  Med <br/>
= around 15 pounds, and  Lg = about 20 lbs.  He&#39;s sweet, very trainable, and <br/>
the perfect lap size.  The buggy eyes bother some folks, but I just love him. <br/>
 DH is allergic to cats and most fluffy dogs.  If we ever do get a bigger <br/>
dog, I am hoping for a Weimaraner or a Boxer.  I&#39;d also go for a snake, <br/>
iguana, or parrot.<br/>
<br/>
Oldest DD wants a turtle, horse, hamster, ferret, rabbit...anything that is <br/>
&quot;just mine&quot;.  Younger DD just wants a mouse (those &quot;fancy mice&quot; are sooo <br/>
cute, but I am afraid they&#39;d be stepped on or worse) or hamster.  I am sure <br/>
when they get older, we will be having more than our share of pets.<br/>
