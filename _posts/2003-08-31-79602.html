&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] Digest Number 3958<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Real life, kids don&#39;t make contracts.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lots of kids sign contracts.  Emancipated minors have the right to<br/>
&gt; sign contracts.  More kids would seek emancipated minor status if<br/>
&gt; they knew they could make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>99.9% of kids (a statistic I just handily made up, but probably fairly<br/>
accurate) DO NOT sign contracts. A handful of emancipated minors who have<br/>
been judged competent to make their own decisions doesn&#39;t change the<br/>
applicability of Sandra&#39;s post.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t understand what is wrong with letting<br/>
&gt; kids be responsible for their own actions.   If I signed a contract<br/>
&gt; specifying that I promised to do something, I would do it, because I<br/>
&gt; believe it is unethical to not fulfill a contractual agreement that I<br/>
&gt; freely entered into.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great. But that&#39;s you. You can talk to your children about your ethics. You<br/>
can model your ethics. But they are still your ethics and not theirs, and<br/>
attempting to force them to BE theirs isn&#39;t the way to produce an ethical<br/>
human being.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Now what is a child learning when he is<br/>
&gt; allowed to make a choice but not allowed to experience the<br/>
&gt; consequences of that choice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Consequences are interesting things. There are natural consequences in life<br/>
(blow in a dog&#39;s face long enough, he&#39;ll probably bite you) and imposed<br/>
consequences (try to quit badminton lessons and Mom forces you to keep<br/>
going). Kids (and adults) learn from either type, but WHAT they learn is<br/>
different. With the first, they learn one thing that will make a dog bite<br/>
and will probably see the sense in avoiding it. In the second, they learn<br/>
that if they make a mistake their parent will not help them out of it, and<br/>
they learn something entirely different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If your child asks you if he can paint a picture, and you say yes,<br/>
&gt; but specify that he has to clean up the mess when he is done, are you<br/>
&gt; going to then clean up the mess for him because when it&#39;s time to do<br/>
&gt; the actual work of clean up, he wines about having to do his part,<br/>
&gt; which was stated beforehand?  Or would you say yes to his<br/>
&gt; request to paint without making him responsible in any way for the<br/>
&gt; clean-up?  When you and your child make this agreement about the<br/>
&gt; paint, that is a contract.  Your child gets the privilege of painting<br/>
&gt; in return for fulfilling his responsibility to clean up.  We involve<br/>
&gt; our children in contracts all the time, we just don&#39;t make them sign<br/>
&gt; on the dotted line.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of us also help with the clean up, or kindly clean up for them if they<br/>
say afterwards, &quot;I&#39;m too tired.&quot; Our family helps each other. This morning,<br/>
as I was cleaning rabbit cages and trying to cope with a dozen cheerfully<br/>
leaping 5 week old bunnies, I asked for help from my daughter (who was busy<br/>
doing something else) and she gave that help, very willingly. Later, her<br/>
sister needed assistance with a paint bottle. I helped her. Sometime after<br/>
that, my oldest (8) came to me and said, &quot;Next time you wash dishes will you<br/>
show me how? I want to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of badgering each other to fulfill our contractual obligations,<br/>
we&#39;re just nice to each other as a matter of policy. Works for us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>sign<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on the dotted line.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s where I see the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Painting is something wholly worth doing whether the child <br/>
cleans it up or not. To set up painting time as something only to <br/>
be done if the child is willing to clean it up will either create a liar <br/>
(a child who paints but doesn&#39;t clean up after saying he or she <br/>
would) or more oftne than not, a non-painting child. Kids don&#39;t <br/>
like clean up. It overwhelms them. There is the wshing of <br/>
brushes, the throwing away of papers, the putting caps back on <br/>
finicky paint bottles, the wiping of the table, the hanging of <br/>
pictures to dry out of the way, the stacking of extrra papers neatly <br/>
in a cabinet...<br/>
<br/>
We forget how naturally all this organization and clean up comes <br/>
to us adults. My boys wouldn&#39;t play with Legos if I required them <br/>
to clean them all up. It feels like too big a burden. But I think Lego <br/>
playing is imminently more important than scooping hundreds of <br/>
tiny plastic pieces up so I always help them to do it. And you <br/>
know what? I am better at cleaning them up than they are.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t make clean up contracts (even with my teens). I want <br/>
them to create, I want them to play and I want them to feel free to <br/>
use the tools in our house. when the messes rise to an <br/>
unacceptable level for my peace of mind, I dig in to clean what <br/>
bugs me most and I ask for help. I don&#39;t guilt (usually, unless I&#39;m <br/>
in the middle of PMS &lt;g&gt;) but I say my needs clearly and ask for <br/>
when someone might be free to help. I often get good <br/>
responses for that. I may even say: &quot;Hey I see all your dolls and <br/>
their clothing on the couches. Can you collect them and I&#39;ll put <br/>
them away?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I try to think of it as pitching in together. Have I ever been <br/>
resentful of how messy it&#39;s gotten at times? Of course. But I try to <br/>
remember my philosophical beliefs first. That always helps me.<br/>

<br/>
It is overwhelming. Even for adults at times. I have homeschooling friends<br/>
who do very little art/craft because they hate having to clean up<br/>
afterwards. We get together every couple of weeks with a few families and<br/>
it&#39;s great, not only because we have a lot of fun but because it is easier<br/>
to clean up when there are 3 or 4 mums helping out.<br/>

We have a lego blanket. It makes it easier to keep track of all the little<br/>
pieces and to put it away you simply each take a corner and pour it into the<br/>
crate. It also means that if the boys don&#39;t clean up, it takes only a few<br/>

You know how you hear something and smack your head and think &quot;now why<br/>
didn&#39;t I think of doing that?&quot; Well I just had one of those moments. A lego<br/>
blanket!!!! Would work great when the kids take out not only those but<br/>
marbles and links and beads, etc. Can&#39;t wait to try it out and I bet the<br/>
kids will get a kick out of it.  Thanks.<br/>

bucket full at a time(you know, the squarish buckets legos come in) <br/>
and is super for quick lego clean up<br/>

the floor, like a lego throw rug!  That describes my son&#39;s room with his <br/>

blanketing the floor.<br/>

Yesterday he (now 5) cleaned his room for the first time.  He was really <br/>
proud of himself and I was proud of him.  He wanted to thank me for getting him <br/>
the helicopter spiderman thing he had wanted from Target.  What a sweetheart!<br/>

I just turned our TV room into a play room.  It&#39;s really cool and <br/>
nice to have most of the toys in one area.  The kids really like it.<br/>
I organized everything, and am having a hard time watching my well <br/>
organized room get messed up! LOL <br/>
 Actually, I just go in every couple of days and reorganize.  The <br/>
kids help or not.   <br/>
And, I was joking about it being MY room.<br/>
Though after going to Ikea(if anyone has been there, you&#39;ll know what <br/>
I mean) and buying cute storage bins and little colorful rugs that <br/>
look like bugs, and dressing it up to be a fun looking room, I am <br/>
having a little trouble letting go of ownership of the place.<br/>
My rational side knows better though. ;-)<br/>

The way I handled toys that the kids would share but some of them wanted to <br/>
know whose it REALLY was, I would say &quot;This one&#39;s mine, but you can play with <br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As they got older, some of them naturally &quot;became&quot; the property of the kid <br/>
who had liked it most or longest.  Some are still mine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has all the Ninja Turtles he ever had, but we had a deal that the troll <br/>
turtles were mine.  Two reasons:  I bought them when he would rather have had <br/>
something else (because I knew someday he would be glad to have them) and I <br/>
wanted him to take especially good care of them.  It worked.  They&#39;re his now.  <br/>
But the atmosphere of them being mine helped him remember not to lose them <br/>
under the bed and get their hair all ruined.<br/>
<br/>
If that room stays yours, it will be easier for you to ask for help to get it <br/>
straightened up!<br/>

I know what you mean. We just did up the boy&#39;s room. It&#39;s a beautiful deep<br/>
blue and has framed prints of Marvel comic characters up on the walls. Mark<br/>
keeps going in there and looking around. I know he&#39;d love to swap rooms with<br/>
boys and put our bed right underneath Wolverine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
