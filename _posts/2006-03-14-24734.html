<div id="ygrps-yiv-193774157">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Dawn.  I have 3 kids, 7 yo dd, 5 yo dd and a 2.5 yo ds and a baby on the way in about 8 weeks!  :-)   I think I&#39;ve read all of John Holts books and really, really like his philosophy.  I&#39;ve also read alot of Sandra Dodds articles - for support and encouragement mostly!  I&#39;ve always felt play was important and I&#39;ve always felt learning is best when it is learner directed.  It amazes me what my kids learn when I don&#39;t interfere!!  <br/>
<br/>
Looking very forward to getting to know everyone here and for support and encouragement!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>
