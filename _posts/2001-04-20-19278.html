<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692501846">We don&#39;t watch commercial tv.  The only thing we have<br/>
watched in the last few months is some of the Stanley<br/>
Cup playoff games on ESPN, Playhouse Disney in the<br/>
morning for the kids, or Nick Jr.  On some occassions<br/>
we enjoy catching shows on A&E, The History Channel,<br/>
Animal Planet, Discovery and The Learning Channel. <br/>
Most of the time if we, or they, want to watch tv, we<br/>
put in videos.  That gives us a lot more control of<br/>
what they are watching, which I think at their age is<br/>
important, and leaves out the ads, which I think are<br/>
really bad.  <br/>
<br/>
We are getting rid of cable pretty soon, as it is a<br/>
lot of money we are spending for a service that we<br/>
hardly utilize.  Since our tv is in the big family<br/>
room in the basement, that menas we probably will not<br/>
get any reception of channels after the cable is gone.<br/>
