<div>Home Schoolers No. 1 On College-entrance Test <br><br>By Andrea Billups: 
The Washington Times)&nbsp;&nbsp; (August 22, 2000)<br><br>Home-schooled 
students have scored higher than their traditionally educated <br>peers on the 
ACT, one of the nation&#39;s two major college-entrance exams, for <br>the third 
consecutive year.<br><br>While the average ACT assessment score was 21 
nationally, home-educated <br>students scored an average of 22.8&nbsp; yet 
another academic benchmark that has <br>given the movement increasing 
credibility and attention.<br><br><br>&quot;Parents are doing a great job of 
educating their own children,&quot; said J. <br>Michael Smith, president of the Home 
School Legal Defense Association in <br>Purcellville, Va.&nbsp; &quot;This explains 
why many highly selective colleges are <br>recruiting their complement of home 
schoolers.&quot;<br><br>Mr. Smith called 2000 a &quot;banner year&quot; for home schoolers, 
citing their <br>first-, second- and third-place finishes in the Scripps-Howard 
National <br>Spelling Bee and their second-place finish in the National 
Geography Bee <br>sponsored by the National Geographic Society.<br><br>The 
number of home schoolers taking the ACT this year, 4,593, represents a 41 
<br>percent increase over last year, ACT officials said.<br><br>Across the 
nation, a record 1,065,138 high school students took the 2000 ACT <br>exam, 
which includes curriculum-based achievement tests in English, <br>mathematics, 
reading and science. The tests measure achievement, as well as <br>preparation 
and readiness for college course work. The scale for scores is 1 <br>to 
36.<br><br>Traditionally schooled students scored 21 in 1998 and 1999.&nbsp; In 
those two <br>years, home-schooled students scored 22.8 and 
22.7.<br><br>Nationwide, ACT scores have remained constant for the last four 
years, but <br>the past decade marks the first time that scores have risen 
consistently, ACT <br>officials said.<br><br>&quot;We haven&#39;t seen a decline in the 
national average since 1989,&quot; said Richard <br>L. Ferguson, president of ACT 
Inc., formerly known as the American College <br>Testing 
assessments.<br><br>Average composite scores for girls remained steady this year 
at 20.9; <br>composite scores for boys rose to 21.2 from 21.1 in 1999.&nbsp; 
Overall, minority <br>students scored slightly higher on this year&#39;s ACT 
exam.<br><br>New Hampshire (22.5) and Oregon (22.7) posted the highest 2000 ACT 
scores. <br>The lowest were earned by students from Mississippi (18.7) and the 
District <br>of Columbia (17.8.)<br><br>The ACT, much like the more popular SAT 
test, the other major <br>college-entrance exam, is used not only for 
admissions, but for making <br>decisions on scholarships and course 
placements.<br><br>ACT officials said this year&#39;s results showed that students 
were taking more <br>rigorous course work in preparation for 
college.<br><br>&quot;Ten years ago, fewer than half the graduates reported taking 
what we call <br>&#39;core curriculum,&#39; &quot; Mr. Ferguson said. &quot;This year&#39;s graduates 
set a new <br>record in core-course participation, with slightly more than 63 
percent <br>reporting that they took a full complement of courses.&quot;<br><br>While 
students today are better prepared for college, they are not following <br>labor 
forecasts when making career choices, said ACT officials, who noted the 
<br>number of students interested in computer careers continues to 
lag.<br><br>In 1999, 4.5 percent of test-takers reported interest in technology 
careers, <br>while in 2000 that figure rose to just over 5 
percent.<br><br>&quot;These small increases suggest that more students are realizing 
that the <br>computer field offers significant opportunity, but the situation 
remains <br>little changed,&quot; Mr. Ferguson said. &quot;<br><br>Results from the 2000 
SAT exam will be released Aug. 29. A spokeswoman from <br>the College Board, 
which administers the SAT, said a question on home <br>schooling was recently 
added to the student information section of the 
exam.<br>******************************************************************************<br>********************<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Home Schooling<br><br>On the SAT, home-schooled students averaged 1,083 points 
last year —&nbsp; 67 <br>points above the national average —&nbsp; according to 
the Wall Street Journal.&nbsp; <br>On the 10 SAT2 achievement tests most 
frequently taken by home-schooled <br>students, they surpassed the national 
average on nine of them. This <br>performance is all the more impressive when we 
note that the average family <br>income of these families is between $40,000 and 
$50,000, compared with the <br>national median of $50,000 to 
$60,000.<br>(Source: FRC)<br><br><br></div>
