&gt; Thought the word lovers might like this. We got a grinder (sub to<br/>
&gt; most of the US I think) and the bag it came in was labeled:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hero * Torpedo * Grinder * Hoagie * Submarine<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just trying to communicate with everyone :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know grinder is used in Boston. And hoagie in Pittsburgh. Not sure<br/>
&gt; where the others are used.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s cool that the US isn&#39;t totally homogenous.<br/>

&quot;Hoagies and Grinders,<br/>
Hoagies and Grinders<br/>
Navy beans, navy beans<br/>
Meatloaf sandwich!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then that great line with &quot;Sloppy Joes, Slop-Sloppy Joes, yeah!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing just how many connections, how much learning we soak up, from<br/>
music.  My kids didn&#39;t know what hoagies or grinders were.  I&#39;m not<br/>
real sure how *I* know (living in south eastern VA for most of my<br/>
life)...maybe my friend who moved to VA from NY told me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that song is funny, if you&#39;ve never heard it.  Fairly tame,<br/>
too, for an Adam Sandler song!  :-)<br/>
