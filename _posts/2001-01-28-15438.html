get one or two messages per day instead of 40-50, and many are set to <br/>
read on the web only, and I don&#39;t read them unless something comes up <br/>
that I want to pay attention to, mostly politics relating to <br/>
homeschooling and such. When I&#39;m not going to be paying attention for <br/>
a few days I set all my lists to &quot;no mail,&quot; then I use the search <br/>
feature out at the eGroups (now Yahoo!) site to go back and check on <br/>
the ones I want to catch up with when I turn the lists back to &quot;send <br/>
mail.&quot; I only actually follow about 20 lists full-time, which is <br/>
manageable since it&#39;s a large part of my job as managing editor of <br/>
Home Education Magazine. I use lists to discuss issues with my <br/>
editors, columnists, writers, reviewers, advertisers, printers, other <br/>
publishers, and so forth. And to keep in touch with my far-flung <br/>
family, to catch up on analysis of the day&#39;s news from my favorite <br/>
commentators, travel bargains, reviews of new movies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m a *very* fast reader, too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; applied to cutting and pasting. Keep the pasted <br/>
quote shorter than your response. IOW, don&#39;t cut and past a whole email to then <br/>
reply with only 3 sentances.<br/>
Highlighting the quoted sections either with &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; or something similar is <br/>
helpful to the reader also.<br/>
I hate to sound picky but when a reader is on digest, it can become very <br/>
confusing when trying to pick out the new from the huge amount of quotes. There&#39;s <br/>
a way to change your settings so that when you reply, your email will only <br/>
include the sections you&#39;ve personally highlighted rather than the entire text, <br/>
headers and all.<br/>
