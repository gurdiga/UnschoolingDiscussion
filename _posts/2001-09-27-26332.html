<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842176946">&lt;&lt;tell you about our karate school&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it sounds like a wonderful concept, but in reality, it would drive<br/>
my little pea sized brain nuts. At home, we always have people coming and<br/>
going, joining in or not, whatever and it doesn&#39;t make one whit of<br/>
difference to me.  And I think if I was doing this class just for fun or<br/>
even just for altruistic reasons and if we learned something, great, it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t bother me at all.  But the deal is, if I want to spend my time with<br/>
kids rolling around on the floor, &quot;I&quot; could do that at home.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m doing this for very selfish reasons, not just to hang out with<br/>
folks.  I&#39;m trying to grow me some sparring partners and I freely admit that<br/>
I am saying &quot;I want this, this and this to happen&quot; and that I am controlling<br/>
the situation to some extent.  I need them to get to a certain level so I<br/>
(she said selfishly) can play and not just be fixing foot positions, etc..<br/>
I started the class because I couldn&#39;t find a school in the area that was<br/>
very &quot;old school&quot; karate and I wanted one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266915628"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  I&#39;m trying to grow me some sparring partners and ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;G&gt; It has taken awhile for my son&#39;s instructor to grow some sparring<br/>
partners.  He loves it now that some of the bigger kids and adults are<br/>
getting to be a real challenge.  <br/>
I concede that you won&#39;t find a physically challenging sparring partner<br/>
in a six year old beginner.  ( unless you consider laughing your ass off<br/>
to be a workout!)  <br/>
<br/>
As the mom of a nine year old who believes himself to be equal to any<br/>
person or task, I have a problem with age limits ( just ask him how he<br/>
feels about not being old enough to vote!)   As the teacher in your own<br/>
school I expect you&#39;ll do what ever you want.   I still think it&#39;s great<br/>
your teaching even if I wish I could change your mind about those floor<br/>
rollers!  ( after all you&#39;ll still need sparring partners in ten or<br/>
twelve years! ) (Too long?)<br/>
