<div id="ygrps-yiv-231649018">Hi,<br/>
I am new to this list.  I have been unschooling my 3<br/>
girls ages 14,12 and 10 for 4 years.  I let them lead<br/>
the way most times but sometimes I introduce things to<br/>
them.   None of them are anywhere near their public<br/>
school counterparts in math and some other subjects<br/>
like spelling.  My oldest dd wants to go to the<br/>
military and college for the medical field, My<br/>
question is this,how do I make sure that she can<br/>
achieve what she so much wants to achieve while<br/>
unschooling? I am feeling the time crunch as she is 14<br/>
now and I don&#39;t want to mess things up for her or her<br/>
sisters, whatever they might choose. <br/>
 Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Vickie<br/>

Welcome to the list, Vickie. I&#39;m Todd, been married to my one & only <br/>
soul-mate Ren for 10 yrs. We unschool our 2 (10 & 7), actually we just live <br/>
our lives and don&#39;t really think much about &quot;how&quot; we&#39;re living it. Does <br/>
that make sense? Anyway, just wanted to say, &quot;HI&quot;, and hope you enjoy the list.<br/>

I would just sit down and discuss those things that he would *need* to go <br/>
college, and then him take it from there. As long as he gets accomplished <br/>
what he wants eventually, in my opinion, whether it&#39;s at 18 or much older, <br/>
it is still up to him in the long-run to get it done. We just need to be <br/>
advisors when the questions come, and then let go of the outcome.<br/>

<br/>
Half of the kids (or more) at school aren&#39;t up on math and spelling.<br/>
<br/>
Does she go to websites to look at military recruitment stuff?  Does she play <br/>
around with some of the medical/anatomy websites online?  That would be <br/>
reading that could turn into writing, which could help with spelling.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s still young even to worry about math, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a quote that goes around (and if anyone knows who said it, pass THAT <br/>
on!) that is everything that is taught in the public schools can be learned <br/>
in 18 months, if you wait until you&#39;re 15.  Whatever would be kinda difficult <br/>
for her to understand this year will be much easier for her to understand two <br/>
years from now.<br/>
<br/>
Medical school is full of people who are older than 21, so she doesn&#39;t need t<br/>
o be in a hurry to &quot;fit in,&quot; and if she does military training first she <br/>
might come to something she&#39;s truly interested in that she hasn&#39;t thought of <br/>
yet.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe.  I heard it earlier I think, than I ever read one of his books, but it <br/>
might have come from something he had said in a speech earlier.  I think I <br/>
heard it when I was on Prodigy, but maybe early AOL days, so that would be... <br/>
 1992 or 1993?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the clue, though!</div>
