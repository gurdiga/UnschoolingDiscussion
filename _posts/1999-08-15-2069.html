&lt;&lt;  Different ability levels exist.  All measured by humans and <br/>
 therefore not measured perfectly.  But the system is not able, imo, to deal <br/>
 adequately with the high-level academic needs of some kids and kills them <br/>
off <br/>
 in the process.<br/>
 <br/>
 If a child &quot;levels off&quot; or &quot;evens out&quot; from neglect, this child has been <br/>
 misserved. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Friends of mine have a 12-year-old daughter.  When she entered first grade, <br/>
she could already do long division.  At the first parent-teacher conference, <br/>
the teacher told my friends, &quot;Your daughter is very advanced compared to the <br/>
other children in the class.  But don&#39;t worry, she&#39;ll level off with them by <br/>
the end of the year.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, they were furious and she&#39;s been in private schools ever <br/>
since.  I guess sometimes it&#39;s not neglect - it&#39;s an intention to level kids <br/>
off.<br/>

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (or maybe not!)  <br/>
WHAT was this teacher thinking???  Was she trying to make the parents feel <br/>
GOOD about this?  Did she consider the child&#39;s advanced skills to be a <br/>
DISadvantage???<br/>
Unbelievable!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have no idea what she was thinking.  This particular friend of mine is in <br/>
my art class with me and I have a whole list of unbelievable ps stories from <br/>
her and other friends there (though for some reason she&#39;s the only person in <br/>
our group who actually pulled her child from ps).  Somehow the others treat <br/>
it as some sort of necessary evil.  I mean, they can relate the stories with <br/>
the appropriate level of disbelief and horror, but figure it&#39;s just a bad <br/>
teacher and their child will just have to deal with it until next year, when <br/>
hopefully they get a better teacher.  It&#39;s an interesting example of &quot;learned <br/>
helplessness.&quot;<br/>
