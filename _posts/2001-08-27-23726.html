<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747984397">Hello,<br/>
  My husband and family were all of the &quot;ok, we will give you a year to<br/>
prove what you can do&quot;I tend to be more of an unschooler, but to start,<br/>
things were more structured, because my husband was nervous about this<br/>
choice. I did actual papers as a routine, and tested after the first year,<br/>
so he could see the results. Although, I never purchased a packaged<br/>
curriculum, we picked up math workbooks, and reading books. Then, I ordered<br/>
an iowa test and spent a week teaching to the test.<br/>
The test results in the areas that were structured daily, math and reading<br/>
were the lowest scores on the test, but they were still acceptable. The<br/>
areas I never attempted to teach were off the charts. The entire time we<br/>
were doing the test, I was annoyed at wasting our time, but I just did it to<br/>
prove that my daughter can learn at home to a skeptic.<br/>
I guess my point is that to me it was very important to homeschool, and I<br/>
had to compromise for the benefit of my husband, but now, year three, he<br/>
seems to be much more relaxed about the entire thing. He still occasionally<br/>
wonders about our decision,but he is satisfied that they are learning, and<br/>
now we both have more of an unschooling philosophy. Also, he is the first to<br/>
defend our homeschool decision when people question it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your husband would feel more comfortable with a curriculum, maybe you<br/>
could look for a loosely structured,little time consuming one, ie., FIVE IN<br/>
A ROW-read classic stories available at the library-then the author gives<br/>
suggestions how to apply the story to the different subjects.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163821732">five in a row is great &quot;curriculum&quot; it uses simple stories and creative ideas to &quot;teach&quot; math, science, history ect.<br/>
we love it <br/>
and consider it the only acceptable unschooling curriculum because if the children are very interested in a place, or time period, or subject we can look it up in one of the five in a row books and get a book from the library and start &quot;learning&quot;<br/>
it also proves to be a good &quot;resource&quot; for skeptics because the family that writes it are long time teachers.<br/>
even the bible lessons are included along with great map skills<br/>
every year I loosely go over the manual and choose a few for reading aloud.<br/>
