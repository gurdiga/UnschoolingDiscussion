<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216365705">When I was 18 to 22 I (& I went to public school until<br/>
I was 17) I had long periods of angst like this. also<br/>
my mom had thrown me out so I had to work for a<br/>
living. I had clinical deppression off & on for years.<br/>
 I read a book called The Psychology of Nothingness by<br/>
William J. Kraft. this is a great book, don&#39;t know if<br/>
it is still in print, but it is all about these<br/>
transitional phases of feelings of &quot;nothingness&quot; all<br/>
people go through. Also read The Courage to Be and<br/>
other existential psychology.<br/>
(so I got an M.A. in Psych age 26 no clue whatsoever<br/>
what to do next as my university prof dad had prepared<br/>
me to be a professional student with no clue about the<br/>
real world, so I became a stripper wherein I learned<br/>
everything I did not learn in public school. from that<br/>
world I became a single mom and hence an unschooler on<br/>
this list. Buddhism has a concept called the theory of<br/>
dependent origination: from one set of circumstances<br/>
another arises, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Short Version: The more you embrace the feelings of<br/>
nothingness and despair the more quickly you move<br/>
through them to the other side.<br/>
<br/>
My still deschooling 12 year old boy still expresses<br/>
some of this stuff. Right now he spends most of his<br/>
time in fantasy game chat rooms. I read his posts and<br/>
say something good about them. They ARE very creative.<br/>
when he tells me he is worthless, etc., I tell him I<br/>
know how he feels, (THIS EMPATHY IS CRUCIAL, otherwise<br/>
he just tunes me out) but i also contradict him, and<br/>
tell him he is not worthless. then I suggest a bike<br/>
ride or something physical outdoors for us to do<br/>
together. if he says no at first, I keep at him till<br/>
he agrees. He ALWAYS cheers up after some outdoor<br/>
exercise with Mom.<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, I am preparing him 6 years in advance for<br/>
the reality that I will not be able to continue to<br/>
support him completely after the age of 18. Wish me<br/>
luck.)<br/>

 <br/>
What makes that &quot;the reality&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
Why 18?  You could stop supporting him sooner.  You could stop  supporting <br/>
him now.<br/>
 <br/>
What magical thing will happen at 18?<br/>
