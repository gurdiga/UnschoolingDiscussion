I can relate to this!  I always dreamed of having a house FULL of kids (I <br/>
read Cheaper By The Dozen about a million times).  Lupus and lack of $$$ <br/>
forced me to change my plans.  I have to remind myself that 3 is plenty, and <br/>
that someday I&#39;ll get my hands on some grandbabies!  I hope my sons marry <br/>
baby-crazy women!  As for my daughter, I hope my feelings wear off on her and <br/>
spur her to have lots of beautiful fat babies for me to love.<br/>

we live in a cape with 2 br&#39;s up & 2 down, but we use the big 1 d-stairs as a <br/>
playroom & the litle 1 d-stairs as an office/computer room. so at night we <br/>
have my 8 & 5 yo boys & 11/2 yr old daughter in with us on futon on floor & <br/>
my 13 yo son sleeps alone across the hall while we are all squished in my <br/>
room! LOL!<br/>
