<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709699864">Stephanie,  Wow!  Thank God you are out of there.  You must be such a strong <br/>
woman to have left that situation.  And what a wonderful mom you are to do <br/>
whatever you had to to protect your children!  I am sooo happy that you now <br/>
have happiness in your life and you are sharing your experiences with other <br/>
people.  I am sending you another HUG!   jackie</div>

            You have been through so much--I&#39;m sure more than many of us can <br/>
even imagine.  You are a survivor-- and I bet that by opening up that part of <br/>
your life to others you will be able to help someone else who is in a very <br/>
bad situation.  I think you are very brave, and I just want to say that you <br/>
have my utmost respect.             Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-972542614">Stephanie, I just read this and had not gone through<br/>
all my mail before I sent previous e-mail. I had no<br/>
idea you had gone through so much pain. I was angry<br/>
when I read in your other e-mail that your DH wasn&#39;t<br/>
sure you should nurse, because that is why woman have<br/>
breasts and although I still feel that way I would<br/>
have been way more supportive had I read this post<br/>
first. Sorry<br/>
Jill<br/>

&gt; cleverly dangled from the<br/>
&gt; wall with my husband&#39;s hand on my throat. My breasts<br/>
&gt; were his, as well as<br/>
&gt; all of my body. If I wanted to keep the Da** baby I<br/>
&gt; would feed the F***er<br/>
&gt; formula or let it starve. Then again, since I<br/>
&gt; decided not to terminate the<br/>
&gt; pregnancy to start, it was another item on his list<br/>
&gt; of my faults. When I<br/>
&gt; left, I felt that most of life was my fault, and I<br/>
&gt; was to blame for anything<br/>
&gt; that was bad. The cereal fell off a shelf at the<br/>
&gt; store I worked for, and<br/>
&gt; amongst tears, I was apologizing to my manager for<br/>
&gt; it being my fault. He was<br/>
&gt; more upset over it than I. Since it was my life, and<br/>
&gt; his just happening to<br/>
&gt; be there. Does that make sense?<br/>
