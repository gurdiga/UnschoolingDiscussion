That&#39;s a good list.  Many years ago I wanted to do a kind of <br/>
questionnaire/checklist/aptitude test so people could come to it in a self-service way and see <br/>
if they were suited to unschooling.  When I brought it up, people (even peole <br/>
who really liked me, and maybe especially those) said &quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;     Their <br/>
thinking was to help everyone on the assumption they all had the potential to be <br/>
unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think they&#39;re right, and sometimes I don&#39;t think so.  <br/>
<br/>
If we were offering chat and resources about owning small yachts, might we <br/>
not eliminate some people up front by asking if they lived anywhere near an <br/>
ocean, how they were with motion sickness, whether they could swim, how was their <br/>
spatial reasoning, and did they have millions of dollars.   LOTS of people own <br/>
small yachts.  It&#39;s not an impossible goal/hobby/pursuit.  It takes a lot of <br/>
time to make it worth it.  Jackie Kennedy needed to actually want to go <br/>
sailing with her family, and to plan, organize it and get it together on the morning <br/>
of the trip.  Maybe they had others to clean up afterwards, but there were <br/>
still sunburns and other booboos to deal with when they got home.  The Kennedies <br/>
knew others who could advise them on what to buy and where to dock it and all <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
Is unschooling at least as involved as yacht ownership?  It can be a heck of <br/>
a lot cheaper, but it takes way more time and has a greater demand of self <br/>
reflection and relationship building.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would have been better to make it a secret back room instead of all <br/>
upfront where we get criticized and misunderstood.  Maybe it should have only <br/>
been for people who got almost there on their own, and then asked for the last <br/>
secret info.  Probably not, but the level of skepticism and insult and <br/>
nonsense does get old sometimes.   The reason it&#39;s not flaring up so much on this <br/>
list anymore is that we keep new members on moderation until it seems they are <br/>
sincere and calm and non-reactionary.  We&#39;ve elminated the &quot;what kind of <br/>
neglectful insanity are you promoting?&quot; fringe.  Sometimes, maybe, that makes the <br/>
list too bland.   And just as with real life, some people like football and some <br/>
people like ice dance.  So either way, some readers wish the list were some <br/>
*other* level of excitement or depth or spirituality or practicality.   Lately <br/>
some of the feedback from people who&#39;ve left the list as been that they wanted <br/>
a &#39;how to,&#39; and more directly useful information to get started, but we were <br/>
just talking about why.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why&quot; is pretty big.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe add that to the list, although at first it seems useless:<br/>
<br/>
-=-  * ability and desire to figure out WHY unschooling is important and can <br/>
work<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi, I am new to this group and have been reading for a couple of weeks. <br/>
After this post I will probably go back to lurking for some time. :)<br/>
When I signed on and began reading I came in the middle of posts that had <br/>
been continuing for a bit and may have misunderstood their premise. As a <br/>
newbie to the list AND to homeschooling and unschooling, I was perplexed by <br/>
what sounded like some bashing of parents. I have been wondering if I should <br/>
even remain a member but thought to stick it out longer to get a better <br/>
feel.<br/>
<br/>
The comments, from this latest response by Sandra, have helped me realize <br/>
that I am still somewhat clueless, lol, but starting to understand why some <br/>
of the posts have sounded harsh. I am a single mother of two (daughter is 10 <br/>
and son is 3). I just withdrew my daughter from school two weeks ago and we <br/>
are trying to &quot;gain our footing&quot;. I am not skeptical of the *why*. It makes <br/>
perfect sense that a child (anyone) can learn better when they are <br/>
interested than forced. I remember leaving the PS system believing I was <br/>
stupid and then 10 years later I was/am soaking up as much information as I <br/>
can, about various topics.<br/>
<br/>
Certain areas of our lives have always been &quot;unschooled&quot;...no limits to TV, <br/>
the computer, movies, computer games, playing in general. Recently I began a <br/>
process called Overcoming Overeating (I have an eating disorder) and learned <br/>
about eating what I want, when I want and how much I want. Never to diet <br/>
again, as diets do not work. This is something my children do now too. The <br/>
rest of our lives have been pretty structured though. There has been a lot <br/>
of yelling, threatening and power struggles. I have stopped the threatening <br/>
and working on the yelling (still happens occasionally as I learn to stop), <br/>
therefore the power struggles are pretty non inexistent. Suffice, this is <br/>
all to say that I don&#39;t come to unschooling having practiced it all our <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
I have been skeptical as to whether or not *I* can unschool. Specifically <br/>
because of severely limited funds (hopefully not for to long) and using the <br/>
public transit system....more so the money. When I first started researching <br/>
about homeschooling I continually read about families and their exciting <br/>
adventures...day trips, vacations, etc. It led me to believe that these type <br/>
of outings were the gist of homeschooling. I hope that is not correct. I <br/>
have recently read about typical days of unschooling on Sandra&#39;s site and <br/>
they have given me a sense of calm.<br/>
<br/>
I am still not confident yet but hopeful and will continue to look within <br/>
myself, question my &quot;capabilities&quot; and willingness and &quot;review&quot; our life for <br/>
signs of richness (being a bit silly there). A &quot;how to&quot; list was exactly <br/>
what I would love. As to *why*....well why not? It makes perfect sense to <br/>
this newbie. :)<br/>
Now I will return to my lurking mode. Thanks for listening.<br/>

fears and the fuel they provide for me to overcome them is exactly the <br/>
reason I *can* unschool.  Deschooling is a far longer process than <br/>
unschooling -- not for the kids, but for the parents: we&#39;ve got far more <br/>
school-think to overcome, to avoid passing down to the next generation. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We live on a meager budget and still find funds for the priorities.  I <br/>
got a zoo membership and children&#39;s museum membership for my birthday -- <br/>
I did the leg work to find reciprocal memberships for FAR less than our <br/>
local fees (got both for less than one), filled out the paperwork and <br/>
handed them over to the first person to ask what I wanted &lt;bg&gt;  The kids <br/>
are in an art class because I asked for a scholarship, Hannah will use <br/>
yet another scholarship to play basketball this summer.  Our homeschool <br/>
group has a membership card with great discounts around town, including <br/>
$2/game bowling w/free shoe rental and 10% off at our favorite art <br/>
supply store.  Never underestimate the value of the free, already doing <br/>
it anyway-type of adventures awaiting you, like the grocery store, the <br/>
bank, the cool downtown stores you&#39;ve yet to visit. &lt;bg&gt;  We do eat lots <br/>
of peanut butter sandwiches on our vacations; seeing the ocean, the <br/>
Grammas, a hotel full of unschoolers -- all worth the sacrifice it takes <br/>
to get there :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There were times when I, too, would have loved a checklist of some <br/>
sort... but that would be just one more thing to feel pressured about <br/>
&quot;am I doing unschooing the prescribed way?&quot; syndrome :)  The glory of <br/>
unschooling is the absence of &quot;how-to s&quot; and &quot;have-to s&quot; and the <br/>
embracing of the &quot;why nots,&quot; saying YES to what brings joy to our own <br/>
individual peoples and ourselves by providing it :)  Confidence and <br/>
success are measured very differently over here &lt;g&gt; and you&#39;ll find both <br/>
in the most unusual, uncommon places - JOY being the benchmark :)  where <br/>
else will you find that kind of reinforcement??? <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps quell a few fears!  Welcome to the adventure :) diana<br/>
