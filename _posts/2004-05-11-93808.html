<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138737175">I could use some input on the movie &quot;mean girls&quot; and on the general <br/>
topic of innocent pre-teens wanting to watch sexually heavy movies. <br/>
<br/>
I was discussing this with some online friends and someone posted a <br/>
review of the movie Mean Girls and its sexual content.  So I guess my <br/>
first question, for those of you who&#39;ve seen it...just how sexual is <br/>
it?  For a innocent 11 year old who hasn&#39;t been exposed to much <br/>
sexuality in movies before, is it a lot to throw at her at once?  <br/>
<br/>
Examples of some things I&#39;ve been told about the movie: <br/>
-Regina states that she was half a virgin when she met Aaron. <br/>
-A male student tells another that something (presumably sexual) only <br/>
counts &quot;if you saw nipple.&quot; <br/>
-An instructor in a sex-ed class tells his students not to have sex <br/>
in the missionary position or standing up (stating that they&#39;ll die) <br/>
and then tells everyone to take a rubber (he has a container of <br/>
them). <br/>
-We hear a breakdown of the various student cliques in the cafeteria, <br/>
including that of the &quot;sexually active band geeks.&quot; <br/>
-Regina matter-of-factly asks Cady if she wants to have sex with a <br/>
guy who&#39;s joined them at school and Cady says, &quot;No thank you.&quot; <br/>
-Regina calls another girl&#39;s mother and acts as if she&#39;s from Planned <br/>
Parenthood regarding the girl (to get her in trouble). <br/>
-We hear that Regina&#39;s mom had a &quot;boob job&quot; (as the camera focuses on <br/>
her chest) and that they&#39;re as hard as rocks (Cady reacts to the feel <br/>
of them when the mom hugs her). The mom doesn&#39;t then realize that the <br/>
small family dog is biting on her clothed nipple. <br/>
-Comments are made about a girl still being a virgin and another <br/>
being a &quot;dyke.&quot; <br/>
-Janis tells Cady that she smells like a &quot;baby prostitute.&quot; <br/>
-A sex-ed instructor tells his students that they&#39;ll have urges and <br/>
want to take off their clothes, but that they&#39;ll then get Chlamydia. <br/>
<br/>
My almost 11 year old daughter REALLY wants to see it. We generally <br/>
watch movies on dvd instead of in the theatres, so we won&#39;t go and <br/>
watch it right now, but it will be out on dvd before long I&#39;m sure.  <br/>
<br/>
My concern isn&#39;t that I want to be a prude and keep her from seeing <br/>
sexual stuff.  I want to be open and honest and all that when it <br/>
comes to sexuality.  I don&#39;t want to not let her watch it.  As a <br/>
matter of fact, not letting her watch something she wants to watch <br/>
isn&#39;t even an option.  She knows the basics about sex but is still <br/>
fairly innocent.  She saw Freaky Friday and loved the actress (same <br/>
one as is in this movie) and saw Mean GIrls advertised and just <br/>
thinks it looks awesome.  Plus it&#39;s about a homeschooled girl.  She <br/>
won&#39;t forget about wanting to watch this, she REALLY wants it.  She <br/>
wants to buy it and she&#39;ll probably watch it several times.  <br/>
<br/>
But the stuff I posted above...Wow, she doesn&#39;t know much about any <br/>
of that at all.  Maybe she&#39;s curious, maybe she&#39;s ready to start <br/>
hearing about some of that, and that&#39;s cool...but all that thrown <br/>
together in one movie?  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s my oldest, so it&#39;s my first time dealing with sexual stuff.  <br/>
Any advice? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552075417">All of the things you mentioned are in the movie, but I can honestly say I didn&#39;t really remember those things until you wrote them down out of context :o).<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of sexual inuendo and satire.  There is no nudity that I recall.  But the movie is primarily about &quot;fitting in&quot; vs &quot;being true to yourself&quot;, not about sex.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<br/>
I think you should take her.  Holly&#39;s seen it and wants to see it again.<br/>
<br/>
The movie is NOT &quot;about sex.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also think you should stop reading shoddy lists like the one that <br/>
&quot;reviewed&quot; that movie in such a stupid and clinical way.  <br/>
<br/>
The movie is about homeschooling and morality and truth and justice, not <br/>
about condoms.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I could use some input on the movie &quot;mean girls&quot; and on the general <br/>
<br/>
topic of innocent pre-teens wanting to watch sexually heavy movies. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a &quot;sexually heavy movie,&quot; and pre-teens who watch movies in which <br/>
characters discuss or have sex will not watch what they don&#39;t want to watch.  <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, this movie is sweet, and the autopsy some uptight person did to <br/>
make that list is more violent than anything I&#39;ve seen in movies for quite a <br/>
while.  Every joke you see that was listed on that page will be ruined for you <br/>
because it has been presented as a potentially offensive bit of **SEXUALITY**  <br/>
(let us have reverb and ominous background music).    <br/>
<br/>
-=-For a innocent 11 year old who hasn&#39;t been exposed to much <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
-=-we won&#39;t go and <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I would take her.  It&#39;s PG, not R.  <br/>
By the time it&#39;s on DVD it won&#39;t be as cool to have seen it as it is now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She knows the basics about sex but is still <br/>
<br/>
fairly innocent.  She saw Freaky Friday and loved the actress (same <br/>
<br/>
one as is in this movie) and saw Mean GIrls advertised and just <br/>
<br/>
thinks it looks awesome.  Plus it&#39;s about a homeschooled girl. -=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s right.  It is awesome.  It&#39;s a hoot.  And there was little to no <br/>
slapstick, there was no &quot;humorous&quot; destruction of property (smashing stuff, not even <br/>
pie in the face).  Pianos in the swimming pool and guitars broken, or dishes <br/>
smashed bother me WAY more than sexual innuendo.  There were a couple of <br/>
scenes where I suspected there would be some property flying, but it didn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
But the stuff I posted above...Wow, she doesn&#39;t know much about any <br/>
<br/>
of that at all.  Maybe she&#39;s curious, maybe she&#39;s ready to start <br/>
<br/>
hearing about some of that, and that&#39;s cool...but all that thrown <br/>
<br/>
together in one movie? -=--<br/>
<br/>
The things you posted, not one of them is necessary to the plot.  If she <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand something, it will just go by and she won&#39;t need it explained <br/>
to understand the story or the characters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me, personally, I hate to see people hiding from the world when they can <br/>
learn more by being in it.  Not you, but all those lists of homeschoolers who <br/>
trade judgmental, negative movie reviews instead of lightening up and being <br/>
open and happy.<br/>

<br/>
That was my initial reaction, but then I started thinking about it <br/>
and wondering if maybe it was as bad as they made it out to be.  I <br/>
started panicing that maybe it would be so sexual that it would be <br/>
traumatic for her.   That&#39;s what I get for doubting my gut instinct! <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a great movie! <br/>

<br/>
Well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a great movie in the Spartacus, Ben Hur,  When <br/>
Harry Met Sally kind of way, but for what it is, it&#39;s pretty darned entertaining.  <br/>
  There are some very excellent gags and dialog, and Kirby&#39;s favorite bit in <br/>
the movie is what her dad says (a two-part set-up joke.  VERY very funny, and <br/>
there are things there that only unschoolers can truly appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to be so &quot;in the know&quot; on a movie, because even more than my kids <br/>
and their friends who first saw it and told me about it from their <br/>
perspective as homeschooled teens, I had been in high school, a girl, welcome in several <br/>
cliques, and been a teacher!<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of jokes stirred the personal parts of me. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
