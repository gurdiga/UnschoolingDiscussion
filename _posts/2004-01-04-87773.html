********************************************************<br/>
Wendy - with 7 kids still at home, a farm and lambing season around the <br/>
corner, I am never able to keep up either.  As much as I want to read every email <br/>
(and there are many people that ARE able to keep up and read it all) I just <br/>
HAVE to delete a good part of it.  For instance:  There&#39;s a thread on potty <br/>
training...I read a few but I don&#39;t have any children potty training, so I delete <br/>
them all (sorry guys!)  Also, if a thread turns into an argument, unless it&#39;s <br/>
something I believe passionately about and feel I have something more to add, I <br/>
delete it.  I don&#39;t have the time, energy, or mental capacity (LOL) to deal <br/>
with all the negativity...I&#39;m a foster mom and HAVE to keep my mind positive to <br/>
deal with the kid&#39;s daily problems.  <br/>
<br/>
I tend to read everything to do with older child parenting, keeping peace and <br/>
harmony in our lives, new or effective &quot;school&quot; stuff (DVD&#39;s, games, toys, <br/>
artsy stuff).  <br/>
<br/>
The downside, is that TOO OFTEN people don&#39;t change the thread title, and the <br/>
conversation will be completely different from the title, and unfortunately I <br/>
miss some really good stuff.  I have to take a deep breath and just put other <br/>
priorities first and hope the conversation will touch on the same good stuff <br/>
again someday in the future!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I also dropped out of a few other email lists so I could keep up better with <br/>
this one.  I&#39;m still part of an adoption preservation list, a no-spanking <br/>
list, and a tiny WV homeschool list.  I don&#39;t even go to AOL homeschooling sites <br/>
anymore, I just don&#39;t have time and there&#39;s too many people I clash <br/>
personality/spiritually-wise with there.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am guilty of this and I apologize. I do read all the posts and just <br/>
read them in the order they arrive in my mailbox, so I don&#39;t even look <br/>
at the subject lines.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I know there are people who really are using subject lines to <br/>
decide what to read and what to delete, I&#39;ll try to do better and ask <br/>
the other moderators and owners to try to pay attention and help get <br/>
subject lines changed for you.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I&#39;ve found receiving only digests to be a good way to <br/>
handle heavy-traffic email lists. Although I read everything on this <br/>
list, I&#39;ve been on digest on many other active lists. I skim the <br/>
digests for topics of interest to me and I find it easier to delete <br/>
several days worth of digests, maybe 6 of them, then to delete that <br/>
many emails - which would be more like 150 of them. Doesn&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; as <br/>
hard that way &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love all the chit-chat and friendly banter that<br/>
takes place, and feel like I am getting to know a few<br/>
people, so sometimes it isn&#39;t a big deal, and I don&#39;t<br/>
usually skip.  Sorting by subject does help, though,<br/>
to see what people have already responded, and many<br/>
times I don&#39;t need to respond at all by then :-)<br/>
<br/>
And when I don&#39;t have a lot of time, but want to read,<br/>
I sort by subject line and skip the things like<br/>
potty-training that don&#39;t apply right now, and just<br/>
figure when I have a slow day, I will go back to the<br/>
archives and read those posts.<br/>
