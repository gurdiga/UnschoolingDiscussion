<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340342052">Hello friends,<br/>
<br/>
My 5 and 7 year old are at it again. The 7 year old is so cold to her <br/>
brother. I&#39;m so sad to watch this. Example 1:<br/>
<br/>
7 year old has a blast with court friends while brother is at baseball <br/>
practice. 7 year old now is planning to have club meetings when ever brother <br/>
is at practice, so &quot;Riley isn&#39;t here&quot;. Other court friends really like <br/>
Riley. Sister, however is planning a life without including him. Not a <br/>
biggy, but bothersome, premeditated.<br/>
<br/>
Example 2: 17 year old, 7 year old and 5 year old playing a game. 17 year <br/>
old it first, 7 year old it next, big fight because 5 year old asks to be <br/>
it, but 7 and 17 year old tell him he can&#39;t because you have to be able to <br/>
spell to be it. 5 year old rage fit through the house. I am having a 4-H <br/>
meeting going on. I ask 7 and 17 year old why he can not be it and they <br/>
continue to say you have to spell. Haven&#39;t I taught my daughter, 7, to <br/>
pretend and have fun. It does not matter what the rules are, a 5 year old <br/>
can and should be it next in a cooperative situation. I&#39;m floored, feeling <br/>
like I handled myself poorly. I do not feel either my daughter or our friend <br/>
understood how cold they were by simply insisting a certain level of mastery <br/>
to be considered it.<br/>
<br/>
Now my question, how can I politely show how cold the girls were without <br/>
tearing them down. I keep having these situations where 1 kid is really <br/>
hurting another and I feel totally unable to help them see the problem <br/>
without hurting them. I want to yell at my daughter for being so cruel. She <br/>
is cold almost all the time to her brother. I want to force her to sit in <br/>
her room and not play outside with her friends. I&#39;m holding back, yet inside <br/>
it really hurts to watch her. She is absolutely wonderful with her baby <br/>
sister. So any ideas. I have read Siblings without Rivelry, any other <br/>
resources or wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
These family dynamics are what shakes my confidence about homeschooling. How <br/>
can I keep two people together most of the day everyday who treat eachother <br/>
horribly? My 7 year old tends to need the most attention. She also likes to <br/>
be the one making plans. It is her way or else much of the time. I&#39;m lossing <br/>
sleep about the attitude towards her brother. Yuck. Also I&#39;m running low on <br/>
Ashley energy since she tends to put her brother down so much. She corrects <br/>
him constantly, even though I have repeatedly asked her to stop. She seems <br/>
to get enjoyment by putting him below her. I keep looking into the family <br/>
dynamics wondering am I modelling this? is Tim, my hubby? Why is she so cold <br/>
to him? I&#39;m thinking of building a TeePee, maybe a big group project will <br/>
help us out of this harsh place.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; Now my question, how can I politely show how cold the girls were without <br/>

<br/>
Some mom-messages which have sunk in here (but we did start early): <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You need to find a way to do something that can include everybody.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want to yell at my daughter for being so cruel. She <br/>
is cold almost all the time to her brother. I want to force her to sit in <br/>
her room and not play outside with her friends.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The things you want to do are things she seems to have been doing.  Is it <br/>
possible that you&#39;ve yelled and forced before, and she&#39;s just passing it on?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; She corrects <br/>
him constantly, even though I have repeatedly asked her to stop. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would TELL mine to stop.  I have sometimes had to tell one of my kids that <br/>
it is my job as a mom to see that ALL my kids are safe from meanness, <br/>
especially in their own home, from ANYONE, and that means them too.  I&#39;ve <br/>
said if we had company treating one of them that way that I would ask them to <br/>
leave.  I can&#39;t ask my own kids to leave, but I can tell them that that <br/>
behavior is NOT allowed in my house toward any of my children by ANYone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told them in a more humorous but just as effective fashion &quot;If you want <br/>
to be mean to Kirby, you grow up, rent an apartment and invite him over.  If <br/>
he comes over, you be mean to him there.  He might not come back.  He might <br/>
leave.  But don&#39;t do it in MY house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Holly wants to hit Marty, we tell her &quot;Wait until you&#39;re 18.&quot;  The <br/>
running joke is that Marty is NOT coming to her 18th birthday party!    <br/>
Sometimes when he does something that frustrates her he&#39;ll say, kinda to the <br/>
sky, &quot;On November 2, when I&#39;m 21, I think I&#39;ll be in Europe&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s humor, but there&#39;s  a serious reality behind telling them &quot;When it&#39;s <br/>
YOUR house you can decide to be mean IF they&#39;ll come and visit.  But not <br/>
here, not now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby and Marty were younger and Kirby would be mean and exclude Marty, <br/>
I would do something extra cool with  or for Marty, which Kirby could not get <br/>
in on even if he wanted to.  I would just plainly say, &quot;Marty didn&#39;t get to <br/>
play with you guys, so I&#39;m taking him to lunch,&quot; or whatever.  Kirby <br/>
understood, and didn&#39;t really get mad, and Marty felt compensated.  And there <br/>
were times when Kirby was nice.  Sometimes because I bribed him to be nice, <br/>
but having BEEN nice and had it work out, it was easier for him the next <br/>
time.  And Marty DID sometimes bug him on purpose (still does sometimes).  <br/>
But as they get older, there are more and more times when Kirby&#39;s totally <br/>
willing to have Marty in on whatever the older guys are doing.  It was <br/>
gradual, and not something I could force or enforce.  But the message that I <br/>
didn&#39;t want any of my kids to be made unhappy in their own home was constant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember 7 as being a pretty literal year for a lot of kids. That was<br/>
the year that &quot;following the rules&quot; in games became important, that was<br/>
the year it was really hard for my daughter to handle a 5 year old<br/>
&quot;goalie&quot; picking up a ball while outside the goal box, and that was the<br/>
only year they actually made goal boxes. I&#39;m assuming that, if one<br/>
followed the rules of the game, &quot;it needed to spell, and 5 yr old<br/>
couldn&#39;t. You can say that rules don&#39;t matter, but maybe to her they<br/>
do... I think to a lot of 7 yr olds they do. Maybe that game isn&#39;t a good<br/>
one for playing in a group that includes 5 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming 17 yr old was supposed to be supervising kids while you ran<br/>
the meeting? I would be much more concerned about 17 yr old&#39;s lack of<br/>
skills in dealing with the situation. There are a lot of other options -<br/>
playing a round of another game where 5 yr old could really be &quot;it&quot;,<br/>
playing with the 5 and 17 yr olds on a team as &quot;it&quot;, and probably more,<br/>
depending on the rules of the game... most 17 yr olds I know would be<br/>
able to think of some.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always relate to the older kid more easily, because I am one... it&#39;s<br/>
hard sometimes to have to slow down and include someone whose skills<br/>
aren&#39;t where yours are. It&#39;s hard when it feels one-sided, when you&#39;re<br/>
always adapting for him and he never has to slow down and wait for you. I<br/>
think often we expect a lot from older kids, and somehow the older one<br/>
always seems so much older and bigger and wiser, and then the younger kid<br/>
gets there and suddenly 7 seems so little...<br/>
<br/>
I can see both kids&#39; POVs. It&#39;s hard to get left out because you&#39;re<br/>
littler and can&#39;t do something yet, it&#39;s hard to have to adapt and change<br/>
what you really want to do because someone else can&#39;t keep up. I guess I<br/>
would try to keep *both* kids&#39; needs in mind. It sounds like you have a<br/>
good handle on what your son is needing and not getting, but it&#39;s harder<br/>
for you to hear what your daughter is needing and not getting. Maybe it<br/>
would help to differentiate activities at the beginning - our homeschool<br/>
group had a &quot;you can&#39;t say you can&#39;t play&quot; rule, so Cacie was used to<br/>
adapting games there for all different levels of skill - it was<br/>
frustrating sometimes, but it worked out. OTOH, there were times that<br/>
were clearly big-kid times, like the group&#39;s Writer&#39;s Workshop, and kids<br/>
who weren&#39;t reading and writing had a brief time to share their dictated<br/>
pieces but were otherwise not included.... and that was okay. <br/>
<br/>
I would think that playing together when you&#39;re trying to lead a meeting<br/>
would be an &quot;everyone&#39;s included&quot; time, and maybe making that clear from <br/>
the get-go would help. As far as clubs - some &quot;clubs&quot; Cacie did at 7 were<br/>
inclusive, and included little brothers (the weird things for sale one<br/>
was inclusive, ASAIK it was mostly about making signs to sell things like<br/>
&quot;wee-wees&quot;), but some didn&#39;t. The club where they talked breathily about<br/>
saving the environment and the lovely fields of wildflowers was private,<br/>
because I think they were exploring some deeper ideas and wanted to have<br/>
long, drawn-out conversations, and didn&#39;t want the little guys bouncing<br/>
around asking if they could all play Speed Racer now. Actually, chosing<br/>
to have a meeting while 5 yr old had another activity going on sounds<br/>
pretty thoughtful, rather than chosing to have meeting while he was<br/>
around but not including him...<br/>
<br/>
I guess it sounds to me like your daughter is really trying to<br/>
individuate, to get some space of her own. Perhaps part of correcting him<br/>
and putting him down is a desire to make it clear that she is growing up,<br/>
that she is different than the way she was (and he is) at 5. Maybe some<br/>
special activities for her would help, things that only she can do, so<br/>
that she feels more secure about where she is... I think that would help<br/>
her to be able to see her brother as less of a threat, and then be kinder<br/>
to him. I liked baking cookies for my brother in my Easy Bake Oven when I<br/>
was 7 and he was 5... he couldn&#39;t bake them himself, that was something<br/>
only I was able to do, so I baked and fed him, and we were both happy. I<br/>
was also the only kid allowed to use my dad&#39;s record player, because I<br/>
had much better fine-motor skills... so if my mom was busy, I could offer<br/>
to play records for him, and we would dance... he was happy because I was<br/>
including him and it was fun, and I was happy because I had a more<br/>
&quot;adult&quot; role in the whole process. I guess it would have been a problem<br/>
if I had been mean about it (&quot;I can touch the record player and you<br/>
can&#39;t&quot;) but I never was, somehow, and I imagine that if I had, my mom<br/>
would have decided to come and hang out with us for a while and put on<br/>
records for him, which wouldn&#39;t have given me what I wanted / needed. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really what it&#39;s about, I think. What is everyone needing that he<br/>
isn&#39;t getting?<br/>

<br/>
I have said this also.....but not always in the tone I should.<br/>
My two older boys love to play legos and having a four yo sister with them <br/>
just isn&#39;t much fun. She definitely doesn&#39;t play the same way they <br/>
like....but she adores her older brothers and legos.<br/>
So I&#39;ve asked them to give me a &quot;heads up&quot; when they want to be left alone so <br/>
I have time to adjust my activities to do something cool with her.<br/>
They still don&#39;t always let me know and often she is left out. It&#39;s very <br/>
frustrating.<br/>
But as we dialogue about how it would feel to be the only one left out and <br/>
how to adjust to accomodate everyone, it keeps getting better.<br/>
I really love your thoughts on taking the child that got left out, to do <br/>
something really neat away from the house Sandra.<br/>
This would really work well here I think, because the boys love getting out, <br/>
so they&#39;d probably see very quick that it&#39;s beneficial to us all to include <br/>
her, and they&#39;re old enough for me to leave alone long enough to go do <br/>
something with her.<br/>
Thanks for some more useful thoughts on the sibling rivalry issues!!<br/>
