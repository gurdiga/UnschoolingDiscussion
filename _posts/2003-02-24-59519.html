<div id="ygrps-yiv-527039934">Hi,<br/>
I was  about to add to the conversation, when I realised I had not <br/>
introduce myself to this list.  I, Lucie have three sons who have never <br/>
been to school.  The first two are sixteen and are very different <br/>
learners.  They started reading quite naturally.  And  I have little <br/>
clue how it happened.  One day, we were driving looking for a certain <br/>
street and discussing how we would teach the twins to read ( didn&#39;t <br/>
grasp unschooling  then) when the twins interupted us, to tell us we had <br/>
pass the street we were looking for. &quot; How do you know?&quot; , I asked them. <br/>
 &quot;We read the sign to pass the time&quot;, they answered.  WE litterally <br/>
didn&#39;t realised they had learned to read.<br/>
<br/>
The third son is 10.  He was a late reader ( 9) and  still has <br/>
difficulty with reading.  He could recognised whole words when he was <br/>
three, but could not break the  phonic code until later.   Computor <br/>
programs like civ III  were great motivator.  So I became aware of the <br/>
process he went through.  First,   he stated to group the syllable and <br/>
associated them with sounds. His confidence was shaky at first but <br/>
eventually  reading  made sense.  Now he wants to read to me , to gain <br/>
speed...  He never wanted to read younger picture books , only chapter <br/>
books.  And now, he joined a book club!<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m in Ottawa too.  Would you e-mail me personally if you have time to give me a bit of info.  My son is just 2 1/2 but I want to know what is out there for unschoolers in the region.<br/>
