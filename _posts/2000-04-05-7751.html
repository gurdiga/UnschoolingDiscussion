<div id="ygrps-yiv-838695580">The Association of Educational Publishers (EdPress) has published an<br/>
article in EP Online, the Association&#39;s electronic newsletter, about<br/>
homeschooling. We offer one short quote here:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The experience of homeschooling is as much about adults uncovering the<br/>
shimmering, infinite quality of learning itself as it is about kids<br/>
absorbing knowledge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is one you&#39;ll want to read for yourself!<br/>
