 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad to see this topic here, even if it is a bit off the path from<br/>
Unschooling. Life&#39;s lessons and the world economy, our impact on others,<br/>
etc. are all a part of what we are trying to bring to our children&#39;s lives.<br/>
If I had thought about it, I should have contacted you John, we were in<br/>
Portland for Thanksgiving after spending a lovely time at Timberline Lodge<br/>
on Wednesday (what a beautiful place!), and we spent Friday at OMSI before<br/>
going to the tree lighting in Pioneer square. Maybe next year we will join<br/>
you for the Buy Nothing Day, though we did have fun at OMSI.<br/>
IMHO, the day-after-Thanksgiving sales are usually a crock anyways - maybe<br/>
one or two items are really on sale, and the rest are marked down from<br/>
already-overinflated prices. If you really want to save money, shop the day<br/>
after Christmas. That&#39;s when the stores have decided they&#39;ve wrung all the<br/>
money out of consumers that they can for the holiday season, and cut their<br/>
losses. :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for us, we just plain old don&#39;t do the mall shopping thing at ALL. It<br/>
drives me up a tree, I guess I&#39;m one of those shopping-challenged women,<br/>
LOL! For Christmas, we give hand-made gifts. We might include the<br/>
fire-started pinecones, this year, that&#39;s a great idea! We&#39;re giving some<br/>
jars of jam we canned earlier this year, some beeswax rolled candles,<br/>
home-made cookies and fudge, and a homemade ornament. We also give animals<br/>
from Heifer Project ( www.heifer.org ).<br/>
<br/>
So John, thanks for continuing to share your unconventional ideas, I always<br/>
find them interesting to read. I was especially interested in your essay on<br/>
jobs. My husband started his own business doing aircraft detailing (or as he<br/>
says, he&#39;s a &quot;glorified janitor&quot;) and we&#39;ve found it gives us tons of<br/>
flexibility, time, and the ability for him to be his own boss, and it pays<br/>
well. My step-brother similarly has his own business cleaning range-hoods<br/>
for big restaurants. He travels all over the country, makes tons of money,<br/>
and loves it. There are tons of niche-markets in the cleaning industry that<br/>
are lucrative and not very time-intensive. It&#39;s great for people to know the<br/>
range of possibilities out there!<br/>
