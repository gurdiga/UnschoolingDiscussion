      <h2>School behavior and environment predicts later violence</h2>
      <p>NEW YORK, Mar 30 (Reuters Health) -- Children with academic or 
      behavioral problems in middle school are more likely to behave violently 5 
      years later, according to a new study that looked at predictors of 
      adolescent violence. 
      <p>``Three characteristics measured during grade 7 consistently foretold 
      the occurrence of violence by the end of the high school years: doing 
      poorly in school, early deviant behavior, and being male,&#39;&#39; write Drs. 
      Phyllis L. Ellickson and Kimberly A. McGuigan, from the RAND Institute in 
      Santa Monica, California. 
      <p>The researchers collected data from more than 4,300 students in 
      California and Oregon schools. The participants, drawn from a broad range 
      of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds, completed questionnaires 
      during 7th grade and again during 12th grade. The questionnaires were 
      analyzed to see what factors predicted violent behavior 5 years later. 
      <p>Students who engaged in behaviors such as stealing, cheating in school, 
      and skipping classes were more likely to behave violently in 12th grade. 
      So, too, students doing poorly in school or who had poor self-esteem. 
      Attending several different elementary schools, and attending middle 
      schools where drug use was more common were both predictive of later 
      violence.

      </td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>Overall, boys were 
      more likely to behave violently than girls, but the authors report some 
      interesting gender differences. Poor grades predicted relational violence 
      (directed at family or friends) for girls, but it predicted ``predatory&#39;&#39; 
      violence for boys -- such as gang fights, use of weapons, and violence 
      used to ``get something.&#39;&#39; 
      <p>Low self-esteem and living in poorer neighborhoods predicted violence 
      only for girls, while moving frequently during childhood and being offered 
      drugs in school were predictive only for boys. 
      <p>Unexpectedly, the investigators found that for boys, living in a 
      nuclear family increased the likelihood of later violence, and middle 
      school rebelliousness decreased it. 
      <p>``Because early deviance and poor grades provide useful warning signals 
      of later violence, these results suggest that violence prevention programs 
      aimed at younger adolescents should include efforts to prevent or reduce 
      troublesome behavior in school and poor academic performance,&#39;&#39; Ellickson 
      and McGuigan conclude. They add, ``Such efforts should begin in elementary 
      school.&#39;&#39; 
      <p>The researchers also noted that their findings suggest that &#39;&#39;programs 
      aimed at preventing drug use may yield an added violence-reduction 
      bonus.&#39;&#39; They called for further research to determine if this is actually 
      the case. SOURCE: American Journal of Public Health 2000;90:566-572. </p></td></tr></tbody></table></font></div></html></div>
