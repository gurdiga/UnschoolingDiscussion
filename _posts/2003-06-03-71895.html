<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741443603">Hi.  My name is Kris and I live just outside of Key West.  I have 2 boys ages <br/>
6 & 8.  Apparently, I have been unschooling them their whole lives.  I have <br/>
purchased about a kajillion dollars worth of curriculum over the years, and <br/>
yet, I can&#39;t bring myself to make my boys sit still and learn what I feel they <br/>
should know.  So... we continue to let life be our guide.  I am coming up on <br/>
evaluation time for my older son... my youngest is still not registered.  I have <br/>
*some* work to show, but not a whole lot.  I really just need to feel *normal* <br/>
about how we do things around here, so that is why I have joined your email <br/>
list.  Just thought I&#39;d introduce myself... okay... now back to who is and <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;do-able&quot;   : )    ~Kris<br/>

This list will make you feel normal (sort of...are we normal???).  Anyway <br/>
maybe some of the others who live in Florida can offer some suggestions on this <br/>
topic. Ren are you out there?<br/>

Hi Kris and welcome. You&#39;ve definitely come in during one of the most <br/>
*ahem* interesting conversations I&#39;ve seen here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good for you! :o) All those kajillion dollar curriculums will not <br/>
help your boys learn more than life will. Sitting still is <br/>
overemphasized and overrated in my book. Kids need freedom to move <br/>
and explore and ask questions. That&#39;s where the real learning takes <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
Is there something that you think &quot;they should know&quot; that you&#39;re <br/>
concerned specificlly about?<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Well unschooling is the norm here. So consider yourself normal, I <br/>
guess. &lt;g&gt; If you want to feel extra, really, especially good normal, <br/>
consider coming up for the SOS Live and Learn Unschooling Conference <br/>
in August. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/events.html">http://www.schoolsoutsupport.org/events.html</a><br/>

Welcome Kris. You came at a good time!!!! I live in FL, just outside of Ft.<br/>
Lauderdale and although my kids are registered with a private school option,<br/>
I know many who do the evaluations. Some are very relaxed and it&#39;s not hard<br/>
to get by. First off I should say put all your curriculum crap on E Bay and<br/>
make some money back!!! Next, if you belong to a support group, ask around<br/>
for an evaluator who is familiar with unschooling or at least very relaxed.<br/>
Then stock your portfolio full of pcitures from the photo albums of things<br/>
you did. Don&#39;t date anything if you can help it. Makes for better looking<br/>
with no gaps. The put in a bunch of pictures your son drew and anything with<br/>
letters or numbers or words on it. Doesn&#39;t have to lool schooly and workbook<br/>
like, just in English! If he does anything like building or puzzles or even<br/>
making things out of playdough, take a picture of that too. Once you get<br/>
started, you can pack so much into it, it will look like you&#39;ve been saving<br/>
for years!!!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
