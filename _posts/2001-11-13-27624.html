<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133109931">Hi all, I was up at 4 a.m. and decidedi t was a good time to read the<br/>
get-back-to-sleep idea. They were great and wrote them all down...esp. the<br/>
onions...and i suppose that is one way to clear the bed so that I have no<br/>
competitions for the sheets. I am a single mom but often will have dogs<br/>
and/or my girls in my bed.<br/>
I really don&#39;t mind them being there at all though.<br/>
Thanks for all the great ideas. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the early morning waking comes with the age and the territory<br/>
(things on our minds that we can&#39;t erase). <br/>
<br/>
Life is complicated. Sometimes I would like to know where the &#39;off&#39; switch<br/>
is when I am ruminating in the wee hours and chewing my emotional cud. <br/>
