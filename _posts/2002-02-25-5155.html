<div id="ygrps-yiv-487664258">Hi all. I just got back to the Land-o-the-Olympics and I&#39;m back online! :o) <br/>
Hope I didn&#39;t miss anything too interesting. I hate scrolling through <br/>
archives.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky enough to meet a couple of terrific unschoolers while I was in <br/>
Florida. My first IRL visit with online friends.<br/>
<br/>
Our hostess was Angela Nordstrom who posts over at the unschooling.com <br/>
message boards. Great fun was had by all and Casey has yet another penpal <br/>
and new friend, Abby. (How many penpals can one kid have?)<br/>
<br/>
I also got to hang out with Sharon of the Swamp, who drove hours to  get <br/>
there! She and her son, Roy, even brought rabbits for the hostess (live ones <br/>
for pets), and Conor and Roy got to commiserate over older folks who think <br/>
their long hair and ponytails means that they are girls. Grrrr. They also <br/>
got to shoot BB guns and a compound bow and arrow.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could meet all of you in IRL. Maybe that should be my goal for the <br/>
upcoming years. I&#39;ve just never had a gathering where everything went so <br/>
smoothly and felt so together and at ease from moment one. I love <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
