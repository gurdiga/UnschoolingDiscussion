I had a vbg on reading your post! Only with my dh it<br/>
was cow milk! Now both my DDs have never drank cow<br/>
milk and I watch the cheese and buy organic from my<br/>
co-op,but he only wanted cow milk for his cereal which<br/>
he had everyday. Well my DDs, so well versed now on<br/>
why one should not drink cow milk( we are not baby<br/>
cows is one!) that one day when we were out of cow<br/>
milk he tried the Rice Milk and then said he would use<br/>
it and we haven&#39;t bought cows milk since! I read once<br/>
that it takes three weeks to change a taste habit and<br/>
its been over three weeks for him and he loves Rice<br/>
milk now!<br/>

&gt; skeptic!!!  <br/>
&gt; (kinda reinforcing his comments) when he would have<br/>
&gt; a fast food burger and<br/>
&gt; would be complaining about how sluggish he felt,<br/>
&gt; kinda gentle reminders. <br/>
&gt; Then when we had an organic beef burger on homemade<br/>
&gt; organic rolls, after<br/>
&gt; dinner he suggested that we go out and do somemore<br/>
&gt; gardening and I kinda<br/>
&gt; mentioned that he wasn&#39;t feeling sluggish, &quot;Gee your<br/>
&gt; full of spit and<br/>
&gt; vinegar, not like after &quot;x&quot; burgers.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, after a while he jumped on the bandwagon and<br/>
&gt; is now reading labels<br/>
&gt; and telling the kidlets all about it (and they very<br/>
&gt; sensibly nod their head<br/>
&gt; up and down never letting on that I &quot;brainwashed&quot;<br/>
&gt; them months ago &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I figured slow was better as it allowed time for<br/>
&gt; everyone else to adjust<br/>
&gt; and now, instead of food fights, I have an army of<br/>
&gt; label readers and folks<br/>
&gt; chomping on the bit for organic goodies.<br/>
