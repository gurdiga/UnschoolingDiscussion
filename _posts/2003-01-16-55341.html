<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For me it&#39;s not really the sound of it.  It&#39;s the feel of it in the air, and<br/>
&gt; then against my bones.  It goes straight to  nervous system, bypassing ears.<br/>
&gt; Headphones don&#39;t help.  Only nitrous oxide helps.  If it weren&#39;t for the<br/>
&gt; expense and danger and unwillingness of the dentist, I&#39;d have general<br/>
&gt; anesthesia every time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t find an army dentist that does nitrous.  Grrrr.  So they prescribe<br/>
valium for me.  But that means I can&#39;t get my teeth cleaned when my husband<br/>
isn&#39;t around, because they insist I have a family member present to escort<br/>
me and Tim isn&#39;t old enough yet.  I can&#39;t see why not.  I live all of 5<br/>
minutes walk from the dentist.  Tim knows the way home.  What else would I<br/>
need?  Sheesh.<br/>

understanding in explaining everything. I&#39;m only getting a numbing gel and <br/>
then a needle. I can&#39;t even think about it. Stick a needle anywhere but in <br/>
my head!! I&#39;m having this done in quarters instead of doing half my mouth at <br/>
a time. Just can&#39;t fathom any more that that.<br/>

I&#39;m intrigued.<br/>

Mind you, I&#39;ll have to read it from behind a cushion. I am a real dentist phobic and wont even go for check-ups.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476168688">Hi Shyrley<br/>
<br/>
sometimes plaque builds up under the gum line, and hardens into <br/>
tartar. This causes the gum to separate from the root of the tooth, <br/>
and can actually cause bone loss. I&#39;ve been at the threshold of that <br/>
happening, when I had it done the first time about ten years ago. And <br/>
now am having it done again, because there are a few places in my gum <br/>
line where the gum has separated. This produces pockets, where...oh, <br/>
this really is GROSS...well, bacteria gather, plaque, tartar, damage. <br/>
Planing takes the tartar off, so the gum can heal and adhere to the <br/>
tooth again. They do it with this little ultra sound thingy that has <br/>
a high pitch squeal worse than the drill.<br/>
<br/>
I just slap the earphones on and watch the TV overhead...cool <br/>
dentist. TV&#39;s in every exam station!<br/>

I don&#39;t know if they had headphones. Might not be going anyway. They left a <br/>
message saying my appt. is for 8:00 a.m. I never make an appt. before 11:00. <br/>
It was suppose to be at noon.<br/>
