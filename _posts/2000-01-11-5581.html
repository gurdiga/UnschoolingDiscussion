<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022889867"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What does anyone know about Michaelmass?<br/>
&gt;  Where can I find out more about it on the web?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Michaelmas Day is 29th September. In England, at least, it is one of the <br/>
quarter days (as featured in Thomas Hardy etc.)  when tenant  farmers in <br/>
England have to pay the rent for their farms.  It is  the feast day of St. <br/>
Michael and all Angels, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
The other quarter days are:-<br/>
       Lady Day - 25th March<br/>
       Midsummer Day, and Christmas Day.<br/>
<br/>
Conventionally, it is spelled with only one -s, so if you try a web search <br/>
for &quot;Michaelmas&quot;, you might find more.<br/>
