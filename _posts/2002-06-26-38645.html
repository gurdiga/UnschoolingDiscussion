Hello!<br/>
<br/>
This e-mail is to announce the existence of Quo Vadis Magazine!<br/>
<br/>
Well... theoretical existence, the first issue is still in the works.<br/>
<br/>
The idea for this Magazine started at the Quo Vadis Gathering for<br/>
Self-Educating Adults, at Camp Myrtlewood in early June of this year.<br/>
Originally my idea was for a newsletter of sorts for the Not Back To School<br/>
Camp (NBTSC) and Quo Vadis gathering (QV-G) community, but soon it outgrew<br/>
that.  First of all I realized that I want to include much more than just<br/>
that small community, I want this publication to be by and for any<br/>
self-educators, autodidacts, life-long learners, etc, who are interested in<br/>
it.  I want this publication to help build a community of life-long<br/>
learning, far beyond just NBTSC/QV-G.  Secondly I realized that<br/>
&quot;Newsletter&quot; wasn&#39;t going to cut it -- I want articles and stories and<br/>
poetry!  I realized that what I was really thinking of was more of a<br/>
magazine.  I expect it will be a fairly freeform magazine, because I&#39;m not<br/>
interested in sticking to a set idea of what a &quot;magazine&quot; is, I&#39;m<br/>
interested in creating a forum for this community to communicate with,<br/>
entertain, and inspire each other.<br/>
<br/>
So, to give you a very brief overview, this magazine will contain articles,<br/>
stories, poetry, reviews, resource sharing, announcements, shameless<br/>
self-promotion, and whatever y&#39;all dream up.  The idea is to interest,<br/>
inspire, and collaborate with each other on just about anything.  One thing<br/>
I want to see a lot of is articles written about topics you find absolutely<br/>
fascinating, written to inspire other people to get fascinated about said<br/>
topics.<br/>
<br/>
For more information, check out http://www.nbtsc.org/wiki/QVMagazine  (soon<br/>
to be http://magazine.quovadis-gathering.org, but NOT YET!)<br/>
<br/>
Now for the important point:<br/>
<br/>
***I need contributions!***<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get the first issue of QVM up by mid August, i.e., before this<br/>
year&#39;s NBTSC.  However, I need some time to compile the issue, and if I get<br/>
enough stuff to make an issue sooner than that, it&#39;ll happen sooner, so<br/>
SEND ME CONTRIBUTIONS!!<br/>
<br/>
This magazine can&#39;t happen without you!  Check out the link above, see what<br/>
you think, and then send me writing contributions.  I may have some theme<br/>
issues, but I also plan to have some fairly chaotic issues with a random<br/>
spattering of different topics and subjects covered, so send me anything<br/>
that -you- are passionate about.  (I of course reserve the right to publish<br/>
or not publish anything, entirely based on my own whim.)  Also, this being<br/>
a free publication and all, I&#39;m not gonna pay anyone for contributions, as<br/>
far as I&#39;m concerned the writing is yours, and when you send it to me<br/>
that&#39;s permission for me to publish it, on the internet and as paper copies.<br/>
<br/>
As I foresee it, the idea is that this will be an on-line magazine, and I<br/>
will keep an e-mail notification list to let people know when a new issue<br/>
is up.  (I plan to use -this- e-mail list for the notification list, so<br/>
please tell me if you would like to be taken off.)  For people who can&#39;t<br/>
get on-line, I will send people paper copies if they need them, for a small<br/>
fee, but I want to have this mostly be an on-line magazine, for three<br/>
reasons: Postage, paper use, and work for me.  Note: I plan to have the<br/>
magazine available in an easily printable format, and will happily allow<br/>
anyone to print as many copy&#39;s as they wish.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing: Tell people about this!  If you know people who you think<br/>
would be interested in this, tell them about it!  (and if you have their<br/>
e-mail handy, send it to me and I&#39;ll put them on the list!)<br/>
<br/>
To contact me, e-mail me at zakarria@...<br/>
<br/>
Please, PLEASE contact me if you want any of the following:<br/>
<br/>
To send me writing contributions.<br/>
To be taken off this list and never hear from me again.<br/>
To tell me somebody you know would just -love- this and they should be on<br/>
my list.<br/>
