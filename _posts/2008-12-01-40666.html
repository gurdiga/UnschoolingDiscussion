<div id="ygrps-yiv-120550249">Responding to the earlier post with a game question made me think about<br/>
how wonderful it is to give games for Christmas and the holidays.  A<br/>
game is something that can be shared and played by many people, bringing<br/>
families and friends together for quality time.  I thought I would make<br/>
a few posts over the next week or so and introduce some of the lesser<br/>
known, but still very popular games that make great gifts for anybody.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may have already heard of or even played the board game<br/>
TICKET TO RIDE.  Produced by Days of Wonder, Ticket to Ride is a very<br/>
high-quality and all around appealing game, both visually and<br/>
thematically.  See the game here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/9209</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ticket to Ride - 2-5 players, ages 8 and up.  Play time 45 min-1 hour.<br/>
<br/>
The board is a map of the United States, and each player receives a<br/>
stash of colored plastic trains.  The goal is to earn the most points by<br/>
completing Destination Tickets (designated routes from one point to<br/>
another).  Each destination ticket has a point value. Complete multiple<br/>
destination tickets for more points, but have any incomplete tickets<br/>
when the game ends and those points are deducted.  Destination Tickets<br/>
are given out at the beginning of the game.<br/>
<br/>
On a player&#39;s turn they can choose to do ONE of 3 things:<br/>
1) Draw 2 cards - either from the face down draw deck, or from a layout<br/>
of 5 face up cards (replenshed when drawn).  The cards can be any color.<br/>
2) Play a meld of same colored cards to claim a route.  A route is from<br/>
one city to another.  For each colored section of a route, the player<br/>
must play one matching colored card.  They place one of their trains on<br/>
each of the colored sections.<br/>
3) Draw 3 destinations tickets, and must choose to keep at least one.<br/>
<br/>
Points are earned for each route that is claimed by a player, depending<br/>
on the length of the route, and by completing destination tickets.<br/>
<br/>
The game ends when one player runs out of their colored trains.<br/>
<br/>
So that is the bare bones of it!  Every person I have introduced this<br/>
game to has loved it.  In gaming lingo, this game is considered a<br/>
&quot;gateway&quot; game, meaning it&#39;s a step up from the more usual and common<br/>
games (Monopoly, etc) and introduces people to the lesser known<br/>
Euro-style games.  (Definition of Eurogame:<br/>

&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sodaklady.wordpress.com/what-is-a-euro-game/">http://sodaklady.wordpress.com/what-is-a-euro-game/</a>&gt; )<br/>
<br/>
Priced a little higher than games you find at the local stores and only<br/>
obtainable through specialty stores or online retailers, this game is<br/>
worth every penny.   I haven&#39;t even seen my copy for some time now<br/>
because it&#39;s always being borrowed by friends or family members.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll post another game introduction in a couple of days, and will focus<br/>
on something a little more budget-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY GAMING!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378904239">Jennifer,<br/>
I&#39;m going to save your reviews in the games section of my site!<br/>
<br/>
Another idea:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Five Crowns is on sale on Amazon for under $10.  I&#39;ve paid $12 to 15  <br/>
for sets happily over the years, for gifts and to replace ours when  <br/>
they get old and less slick.  We&#39;re on our third set.  I love that game.<br/>

like a very geographically and logically productive obsession.<br/>

In addition to the game Jennifer described, there&#39;s a 1910 Expansion  <br/>
set for that one, and other sets whose game boards are Europe,  <br/>
Switzerland, and Nordic Countries.<br/>

yeah.  grrrrr.  we used to play that with our kids, from the time they were little - just verbally.  we&#39;d make up all sorts of torurous choices.  as far as i know that book and that game didn&#39;t exist at that time.  we missed the boat!  should have &quot;invented&#39; it!<br/>

Well...<br/>
It was already invented.  People have marketed all kinds of games  <br/>
that were already invented. &lt;g&gt;  It doesn&#39;t make them better.<br/>
<br/>
Not worth &quot;grrr&quot;ing about, because the important thing about being  <br/>
with  kids is to be peaceful and joyful with them.  Let childless  <br/>
people design and market games.  Some people are childless by choice  <br/>
and some (very sadly) wish they had children and didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have children should play happy games with them!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711003414">We play Would You Rather all the time!  I didn&#39;t know it was a board game.  It is always fun on car trips, but we play it at dinner sometimes too.<br/>
<br/>
We also also play &quot;Silly Signs&quot; where we pretend to see silly signs (&quot;Lasagna must be eaten with chopsticks&quot;, for example).<br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;Thinking Game&quot; where someone thinks of something and gives clues for the other players (sort of like Twenty Questions, I guess).<br/>
<br/>
A new one is the &quot;Animal Game&quot; where someone thinks of an animal and the other player(s) have to come up with ten things they know about that animal.  Five seemed too easy and ten is an easy number to keep track of on fingers.<br/>
<br/>
We used to spend lots of time in the car driving places, so we made up lots of car games.  When Megan was younger she liked me to call out a color or number I saw and then she&#39;d see if she could find the same one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063196361">We play &quot;Word Charades&quot;. We think of a movie, tv show or book title and say <br/>
descriptive clues until someone gets the answer. The trick is to make the <br/>
clues cryptic enough that the title isn&#39;t an immediate snap. It&#39;s a great <br/>
car game - the hardest part is thinking up a new title that Jayn has a <br/>
chance at being familiar with when it&#39;s my turn.<br/>

We used to play a game like it in the car (especially on road trips) when the kids were small. We got the game a couple of years ago, but don&#39;t really like to use the board. We just have the cards in the car for &#39;fresh&#39; ideas. It&#39;s great for that!<br/>
