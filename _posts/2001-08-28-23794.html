<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815903082">Well, now that we have the recipe sharing list going, would anyone be<br/>
interested in having a book sharing list going too?<br/>
Nothing fancy, but when you&#39;ve read a good book yourself, or read one to<br/>
your kids, or your kids have read a good one you could type in the name<br/>
and author and send.<br/>
What does everyone think?<br/>
Or would people rather just do it on the unschooling list?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Ann<br/>
Another list, please.  Some of us older Mamma&#39;s would<br/>
never get through listing books! We are talking<br/>
thousands.  It is a good idea, but I prefer to opt<br/>
out. If a particularly special book comes along<br/>
related to a topic (or not) or if someone is compelled<br/>
to share an enlightening book experience, that is<br/>
different!<br/>
Thanks, Sharon<br/>
<br/>

I think book sharing is a great idea.  Is there a database on the website that could be set up to share books for those that want too.  While others who would before not to don&#39;t have to bother.  Bonnie who loves books and always wants to hear about a good one!<br/>
