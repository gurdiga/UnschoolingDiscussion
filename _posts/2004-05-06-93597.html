&lt;&lt;  LOL - I think of it in reverse! Real life has limitations that only <br/>
games can ignore, which is what makes it real life, more like a game the more <br/>
we <br/>
eliminate its limitations. And real life never includes everybody. Real life <br/>
is the clubs we&#39;re in and clubs we&#39;re not. . .   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The definition of a game (a game as opposed to &quot;just playing&quot;) is that there <br/>
are restrictions and limitations and the players see how well they can do <br/>
within those artificial restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
Even &quot;let&#39;s play cops and robbers&quot; has implied rules, and kids will point out <br/>
quickly when one cheats.   There aren&#39;t jetplanes in cops and robbers, for <br/>
instance.  There&#39;s probably not time travel, unless they state upfront they&#39;re <br/>
playing within the restraints and realities of a certain novel or movie or <br/>
they&#39;ve made something up.   But without other pre-set conditions, cops and <br/>
robbers involves someone snagging a treasure, &quot;the good guys&quot; chase them, find them, <br/>
get it back, with some &quot;bang bang&quot; possibly involved, and maybe a jail from <br/>
which they can escape which adds the element of tag and a base.  But kids don&#39;t <br/>
need to discuss the rules in advance, they just need to know who&#39;s who and <br/>
they go.  Simplest version is just nothing but chase in the first place, but you <br/>
can &quot;arrest&quot; people or shoot them.<br/>
<br/>
Playing a game with cards is very limited as compared with what could be done <br/>
with cards in the real world.  You could clip them to a bike frame so they <br/>
make noise in the spokes or learn to throw them great distances with accuracy, <br/>
or use them folded up to keep a table from rocking or you could eat them or <br/>
start fires with them or tape them together or put them all over a w Game, rules.<br/>
