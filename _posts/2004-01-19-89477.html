I had permission to play the organ at my church any time, and once when we <br/>
were old enough to drive my best friend and I were out and bored and I wanted <br/>
to <br/>
show her the organ.  It wasn&#39;t &quot;church time&quot; and I tried to explain to her <br/>
that it was just a building, not sanctified like the Catholic church.  I <br/>
finally <br/>
convinced her to come in but she was nervous as a cat, and kept looking over <br/>
her shoulder the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
I traded Bibles with her once so we could see what the differences were.  <br/>
About ten minutes later she was at the door saying her mom said we had to <br/>
trade <br/>
back right away.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
