<h4>Betsy</h4>
<p><small><time>13 Aug 2003, at 11:09am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432830208">**Anybody going to the HSC Conference in Sacramento this weekend?  I <br/>
know Betsy, Pam S. and Pam H. are.  With me that&#39;s 3 Pams.  Anyone else? <br/>
  And can we have an unschooling get together?  Maybe past midnight......**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to get some &quot;hang time&quot; with fellow unschoolers at the <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not at my brightest and loveliest after midnight. &lt;g&gt;  The one thing <br/>
that I excelled at in school was being the first kid to fall asleep at <br/>
every slumber party.  What about dinner or after the last session on <br/>
Saturday and before dinner?<br/>
<br/>
I plan to go to the &quot;technology&quot; session at 8:30 am Saturday.  (Hi, <br/>
Dan!)  If anyone else is there, please say &quot;hi&quot;. I hear the name tag <br/>
text is going to be bigger this year, which is great, &#39;cause it&#39;s a <br/>
little embarassing to be caught staring at women&#39;s chests throughout the <br/>
day, even if the reason is trying to decipher their names. (Dan, if you <br/>
get &quot;busted&quot;, feel free to borrow my &quot;alibi&quot;. &lt;eg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy, still with the immature jokes!<br/>
<br/>
**I am!  With Elizabeth who is not on this list but should be as she <br/>
also unschools.  We&#39;ll be sharing a room.  Please look for us.**<br/>
<br/>
Great!  Will do so.</div>
