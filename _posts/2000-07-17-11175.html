chicken products at all, Pizza Hut may not be the best choice...<br/>

Pizza Hut:<br/>
&quot;The regular pizza sauce contains beef base, whey, cheese solids (which is<br/>
made with animal enzymes), buttermilk powder, nonfat milk solids, and MSG.<br/>
The Cavatini, meatless, and bread stick sauces contains beef base, beef<br/>
flavor, meat type flavor, natural flavor, and MSG. No further information<br/>
was available on these ingredients. The Zesty pizza sauce contains chicken<br/>
fat and two types of cheeses (made with enzymes). The sauce, which is<br/>
served with the spaghetti marinara with meat, contains precooked sausage<br/>
(composed of pork and beef), beef, chicken stock, chicken fat, and nonfat<br/>
dry milk. All the pasta at Pizza Hut is vegan.&quot;<br/>
