<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041253357">Ok, I&#39;ve waded through a bunch of digest versions of this egroup, and now I&#39;m <br/>
jumpin&#39; in on this &quot;Christian unschooling&quot; &quot;Bob Jones&quot; discussion.<br/>
<br/>
1) A statement of faith is a list of doctrine/religious beliefs which a <br/>
person chooses to follow or not follow.  Usually this is a document which serves as <br/>
a basis or the basis for a house of worship.  There IS freedom of religion <br/>
and if a person chooses to do this, FINE!!! That&#39;s their American God-given <br/>
right.  This is not being &quot;intolerant&quot;.  This is a choice.  What a person does <br/>
with that choice IS another issue in itself.  Some religions are extremely <br/>
legalistic, others are extremely liberal.<br/>
<br/>
2) &quot;Christian&quot; is a term or label for one who follows the person and <br/>
teachings of Jesus Christ.  This is a religious choice.  Remember, freedom of <br/>
religion.<br/>
<br/>
3) A person has the choice of how to conduct one&#39;s attitudes, personality, <br/>
lifestyle.  A person also has the choice of how to react to different attitudes, <br/>
personality, and lifestyles.  Therefore, the &quot;fence&quot; has both sides.  Both <br/>
sides go overboard on religious and unschooling, to a point.<br/>
<br/>
4) Why don&#39;t we all just settle and worship &quot;God?&quot; Because the 1 and only 1 <br/>
major factor is different--the belief in the individual religions concerning <br/>
the personhood, humanity, and authenticity of Jesus Christ.  This belief <br/>
literally spans the spectrum of total belief in who He said He was, and those who do <br/>
not believe He was who He professed to be, and all those in between.  The 2 <br/>
ends of the spectrum cannot mix--belief wise, the definition of &quot;God&quot; is exactly <br/>
the opposite from each other.  Whew, glad to get that typed out.<br/>
<br/>
4) I believe strongly that home education families CAN bind together, unite <br/>
and do stuff together.  I&#39;ve personally have seen this happen here in Missouri. <br/>
 The religious basis is NOT used as the basis for the organization structure. <br/>
 Yes, we have all types of families who participate. Yes, the families talk <br/>
to each other on all topics.  What keeps us together??  We&#39;re checking out the <br/>
awesome world and gaining knowledge and using it however we choose within our <br/>
own families.  The parents have a deep quest for knowledge and this eager <br/>
anticipation is from &quot;ideas&quot; from our kids, and we all dig together and glean what <br/>
we can.  We facilitate and model &quot;learning&quot; on the topics/issues, whatever <br/>
our kids want to dig into!!! Our kids thirst after deeper learning environments <br/>
and than they thrive in directions we never thought would&#39;ve ever enter into <br/>
our minds, as adults :)  We watch them grow and develop into lifelong learners <br/>
persuing their goals in life.<br/>
<br/>
5) Yes, I hold strong religious, &quot;Christian&quot; personal beliefs.  Yes, if <br/>
asked, I&#39;ll share.  I&#39;ll also shut up.  I won&#39;t apologize if my lifestyle is <br/>
different.  One thing for sure, I am having the time of my life as a home educator.  <br/>
I&#39;ve met so many families who share the same educational philosophy--the <br/>
lifelong learning of unschooling.  Do I have an educational &quot;plan&quot; for my kids? <br/>
Yep, they are going to be encouraged to pursue their goals, and their critical <br/>
thinking minds.  I am looked upon as either totally &quot;right on&quot; or &quot;nuts&quot; by my <br/>
peers.  I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m not hurting anyone, that&#39;s their problem.  I&#39;m not <br/>
going to be bothered by such childish tactics.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;ve made personal religious choices, and I&#39;ll live by my <br/>
convictions.  <br/>
<br/>
In some beliefs this involves dress, schooling type, and curriculum choices. <br/>
If you want to make a religious choice, that&#39;s your choice!  Unschooling is a <br/>
lifestyle, not a religious belief.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 1) A statement of faith is a list of doctrine/religious beliefs which a<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In fundamentalist Christian homeschooling groups statements of faith are<br/>
used to clearly lay out what beliefs the members of the group hold. They are<br/>
also a message to those who don&#39;t hold those beliefs that their acceptance<br/>
into the group very probably won&#39;t be as all encompassing as those who do<br/>
hold the beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
That practice is something people should be aware of. People should also be<br/>
aware of *why* the groups choose to set themselves up that way. And it&#39;s not<br/>
because they want everyone who homeschools to be all one big happy family.<br/>
<br/>
Would you feel comfortable signing a statement of faith that said you<br/>
believed we are all reincarnated until we reach Enlightenment and are<br/>
welcomed into the heavens with Buddha?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and if a person chooses to do this, FINE!!! That&#39;s their American God-given<br/>
&gt; right.  This is not being &quot;intolerant&quot;.  This is a choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re reading more into what&#39;s being discussed. The discussion<br/>
isn&#39;t aimed at convincing anyone that fundmenatlist Christians don&#39;t have a<br/>
right separate from the rest of us, or run exclusive groups, or believe in<br/>
things that many people disagree with. They do have the right.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s being discussed is the extent and existence of this very large group<br/>
of homeschoolers that is practically invisible to many homeschoolers,<br/>
especially unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The negative experiences with the Christian support groups that people are<br/>
expressing are, I believe, in response to the idea that the label is<br/>
creating a division between secular homeschoolers and Christian<br/>
homeschoolers. But in fact it&#39;s the Christian Homeschoolers themselves who<br/>
*want* the division. The experiences, I believe, were meant to illustrate<br/>
that Christian Homeschoolers want to be separate from the rest of us, not in<br/>
how wrong and hurtful the groups are for existing or that they should not be<br/>
allowed to exist.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 2) &quot;Christian&quot; is a term or label for one who follows the person and<br/>
&gt; teachings of Jesus Christ.  This is a religious choice.  Remember, freedom of<br/>
&gt; religion.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends who is defining Christianity. Yours is a very inclusive definition.<br/>
Many Christians define Christianity more narrowly. It&#39;s their right to do<br/>
so. But in terms of being able to express informed opinions about<br/>
homeschoolers as a group, it&#39;s useful to be aware that there is a large<br/>
chunk of Christians who are homeschooling who don&#39;t agree with your<br/>
definition. Their definition excludes a goodly chunk of people who consider<br/>
themselves Christian.<br/>
<br/>
That is both reality and their right to do so. And people should be aware of<br/>
that reality or the opinions they express about homeschooling in general --<br/>
often from an unschooling point of view -- can be very very wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) Why don&#39;t we all just settle and worship &quot;God?&quot; Because the 1 and only 1<br/>
&gt; major factor is different--the belief in the individual religions concerning<br/>
&gt; the personhood, humanity, and authenticity of Jesus Christ.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, that&#39;s very very wrong. There are few mainstream Christian faiths that<br/>
question whether Jesus was son of God or that he existed. Some admit that we<br/>
can&#39;t know about the son of God aspect and allow individuals to doubt.<br/>
(United Church of Christ comes to mind, but even within the UCC individual<br/>
churches can be very different in their doctrine.)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re talking about something else, I&#39;m totally missing the point. But<br/>
if I&#39;ve understood, your information about the doctrine of Christianity<br/>
beyond your own set of beliefs is way off.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 4) I believe strongly that home education families CAN bind together, unite<br/>
&gt; and do stuff together.  I&#39;ve personally have seen this happen here in<br/>
&gt; Missouri. <br/>
&gt; The religious basis is NOT used as the basis for the organization structure.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems you&#39;re saying that those of us who aren&#39;t fundamentalist Christians<br/>
are the ones who are desiring the separation from the Christian groups and<br/>
we&#39;re causing the rifts.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s different in your little pocket of Missouri. But you also say<br/>
you&#39;re a Christian which is perhaps like a white person commenting on the<br/>
state of race relations. Does your group have Pagans and Buddhists and<br/>
families with same sex partners and Asians and Hispanics and African<br/>
Americans? And what do they honestly say about how included they feel?<br/>
<br/>
There are many areas of the country where very specific Christian beliefs<br/>
are used as a determining factor on who the families in the group should<br/>
allow into the group. They *choose* to do this because they *don&#39;t* want to<br/>
&quot;bind together, unite and do stuff together.&quot; They want to make sure they<br/>
are only uniting with those whose beliefs match theirs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s their right to do so and I understand why they want it that way. Heck,<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to mix with a group of White Separatist Movement<br/>
homeschoolers (should such a group exist).<br/>
<br/>
People should be aware that fundamentalist Christians who don&#39;t want to mix<br/>
with unschoolers and people who aren&#39;t their brand of Christianity. People<br/>
should also be aware of *why* they want to limit who their children are<br/>
exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I won&#39;t apologize if my lifestyle is different.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one&#39;s asking anyone to apologize for their beliefs. We&#39;re presenting<br/>
information about the homeschooling movement that many people, including<br/>
you, don&#39;t seem to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s asking the fundamentlists to stop doing what they&#39;re doing. But<br/>
people should be aware that fundamentalist Christian Homeschoolers exist and<br/>
what their beliefs are and what their goals for homeschooling are because<br/>
they are a large politically active group. The legislation they may push for<br/>
-- that may on the surface seem to be good -- could hamper how we as<br/>
unschoolers can homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t care about the unschoolers&#39; need to have freedom to help their<br/>
children learn in anyway that&#39;s best for them. Their goal is to have as<br/>
little government interference as possible. Which sounds good! But they --<br/>
since the core who are pushing their political agenda -- are school at<br/>
homers. And they are willing to allow legislation -- even encourage<br/>
legislation -- that requires some formal assessment. They recognize that<br/>
tests or the like -- since they know they can get their kids to do well on<br/>
tests -- will keep the government from looking into what they&#39;re doing.<br/>

<br/>
Nobody is saying they can&#39;t! We&#39;re saying that the type of Christians WE are talking about wouldn&#39;t DARE hang out with the likes of a Pagan or a Buddhist or an atheist or.....<br/>
I run an inclusive group. I know exactly how home/unschoolers of all faiths and backgrounds can come together for mutual support. But the Christians in our group are not the type of Christians we&#39;re talking about here. Those folks have shown up occasionally and never, ever come back after they see our kids playing Yu-gi-oh, talking about certain movies and figure out that we have atheist and Pagan members.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re preaching to the choir. We KNOW that homeschoolers can come together, we also know that there is a brand of homeschooler called &quot;Christian homeschoolers&quot; that want nothing to do with a truly inclusive group.<br/>
The local very organized, very powerful homeschooling support group is Christian based. Their statement of faith weeds out even semi-liberal Christians with the very first item...&quot;I believe that the Bible is the INFALLIBLE word of God, blah, blah, blah&quot;<br/>
Not exactly inclusive.<br/>
It IS intolerant.<br/>
<br/>
I go as far as to say you can&#39;t truly unschool if you&#39;re children aren&#39;t allowed to form their own beliefs. But that&#39;s me.<br/>

<br/>
If you think those &quot;sides&quot; are of equal weight, you haven&#39;t looked into what <br/>
we&#39;re writing about.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Yes, we have all types of families who participate. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you have the kinds of families we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
There are families whose reason for homeschooling is to keep away from people <br/>
who aren&#39;t of their religion (their very narrow definition of their religion, <br/>
which is the purpose for the statement of faith HOMESCHOOL groups--you talked <br/>
about church statements of faith, which is not the same thing).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;re checking out the <br/>
awesome world and gaining knowledge and using it however we choose within our <br/>
own families. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The families I&#39;m talking about don&#39;t check out &quot;the awesome world.&quot;  They <br/>
only check out the Bible and things written and spoken by people in their groups.<br/>
<br/>
Do you doubt those groups exist?<br/>
Did you look at any of the links I sent yesterday?<br/>
Do you not WANT to know?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The parents have a deep quest for knowledge and this eager <br/>
anticipation is from &quot;ideas&quot; from our kids, and we all dig together and glean <br/>
what <br/>
we can.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I could find sites saying kids &quot;ideas&quot; are worthless, only what the parents <br/>
tell them to think is of value.  Those are the people who are speaking for <br/>
unschoolers in general, working to change laws and to take over the government.  <br/>
Do I think they&#39;ll succeed in the latter?   No.  They&#39;ve already succeeded in <br/>
the former in some states.  Do I think it&#39;s embarrassing and frustrating that <br/>
they&#39;re speaking for all homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Also embarrassed there are people on an unschooling list who COULD be <br/>
learning from the world around them who prefer to say LA LA LA LA you can&#39;t make me <br/>
know this.  LA LA LA LA I&#39;m not looking at those websites.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Our kids thirst after deeper learning environments <br/>
and than they thrive in directions we never thought would&#39;ve ever enter into <br/>
our minds, as adults :)  We watch them grow and develop into lifelong <br/>
learners <br/>
persuing their goals in life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure lots of homeschoolers do.  That doesn&#39;t change the fact that lots don&#39;t <br/>
and don&#39;t WANT to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve met so many families who share the same educational philosophy--the <br/>
lifelong learning of unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met unschoolers too.<br/>
<br/>
What does that have to do with the Christian Homeschooling Movement which <br/>
remains staunchly critical of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do I have an educational &quot;plan&quot; for my kids? <br/>
Yep, they are going to be encouraged to pursue their goals, and their <br/>
critical <br/>
thinking minds. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;re obviously not one of the members of that Christian Homeschooling <br/>
Movement.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A statement of faith is a list of doctrine/religious beliefs which a <br/>
person chooses to follow or not follow.  Usually this is a document which <br/>
serves as <br/>
a basis or the basis for a house of worship.  There IS freedom of religion <br/>
and if a person chooses to do this, FINE!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This statement entirely misses the point of the discussion.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
I doubt you have the kinds of families we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, all types.  One day, I would actually like to meet you Sandra.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
There are families whose reason for homeschooling is to keep away from people <br/>
<br/>
who aren&#39;t of their religion (their very narrow definition of their religion, <br/>
<br/>
which is the purpose for the statement of faith HOMESCHOOL groups--you talked <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yep, met these folks too.  They are an interesting bunch to &quot;explore&quot; with, <br/>
especially down in the Missouri caves!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
The families I&#39;m talking about don&#39;t check out &quot;the awesome world.&quot;  They <br/>
only check out the Bible and things written and spoken by people in their <br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
Do you doubt those groups exist?<br/>
Did you look at any of the links I sent yesterday?<br/>
Do you not WANT to know?<br/>
<br/>
I understand exactly whom you are referring to.  I do not doubt in the <br/>
slightest about their existence.  I&#39;ve met them.  Again, quite interesting people to <br/>
meet.  They liked the visiting the synagogue trip.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
What do you think &quot;secular&quot; means?<br/>
I&#39;m guessing because you wrote this, that your current group is not <br/>
&quot;secular.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I understand what &quot;secular&quot; means.  That is what was so odd about getting <br/>
banned from that group.  When I joined it, I &quot;assumed&quot; unschoolers might be more <br/>
prevalant (? on spelling) in a &quot;secular&quot; group!!! Surprise, surprise, need I <br/>
say more!!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even refer to &quot;secular&quot; or &quot;christian&quot; in FIELD TRIPS!!!.  We&#39;re <br/>
simply home educators and home education families. Just a bunch of Kids (ages <br/>
preborn-?)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
&lt;&lt;The bottom line is &quot;sin&quot; is a term used in religion.  It is not an <br/>
educational methodology, such as &quot;unschooling is sin&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The article which was referred to that listed &quot;unschooling as sin&quot;.  I <br/>
totally disagreed with that statement.  The author is mixing a religious term with <br/>
an &quot;educational method&quot;.  There is no way &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;sin&quot; can be used <br/>
in the same phrase!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
&lt;I <br/>
They&#39;re teaching <br/>
revisionist and particularly written-for-Christians history and science.<br/>
<br/>
What do we, unschoolers, care what anybody chooses for their &quot;teaching <br/>
tools&quot;?? Let them, isn&#39;t that part of freedom to home education!!!  The issue I <br/>
don&#39;t want is when the govt sticks its head in and says &quot;be under a certain <br/>
curriculum/umbrella or don&#39;t home educate&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
HSLDA completely agrees that the govt should NOT have any say about what <br/>
curriculum is used within home education families.  HSLDA only asks that each <br/>
family have a &quot;plan&quot;.  I personally spoke, in person, with the attorney who <br/>
represents Missouri concerning this &quot;plan&quot;.  The bottom line, if anything happens <br/>
and we call them for representation, we need to give them whatever we can that <br/>
&quot;proves&quot; our kid has received their home education.  Its simply giving them <br/>
&quot;evidence&quot; that they can show a judge, if need be, to BACK off and get out of our <br/>
HOME EDUCATION.  They know what &quot;unschooling&quot; is.  They also give full credit <br/>
to Mr. Holt and unschoolers for &quot;spearheading&quot; the home education movement.  <br/>
<br/>
Please do not get on the tangent about the cons of HSLDA.  Believe me, I&#39;ve <br/>
read many a links, ect.  I remember awhile back, Sandra there was an <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; guide for use if you needed it to show the state as part of recordkeeping. <br/>
 This is what we basically developed and showed HSLDA, and that was fine.  It <br/>
was sketchy, but it was an outline of the main goals.  Bottom line, if we <br/>
need them to represent them, they want &quot;something&quot; to show that judge.<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
That doesn&#39;t change the fact that lots don&#39;t <br/>
and don&#39;t WANT to.<br/>
<br/>
I understand this fact concerning a portion of the Christian Homeschooling <br/>
Group.  They have made this choice.  How in the world does this affect <br/>
unschoolers?? Unschoolers are brave enough to stand on their own 2 feet and continue <br/>
their journey.  Some unschoolers have chosen they do not want to join groups <br/>
that require these statements.  If they wanted to, and they tried, when they knew <br/>
they would not be accepted, why join?  Find another group.  What&#39;s the deal?? <br/>
I&#39;m confused on this one.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I know I missed a few in those long posts.  Not intentional.  No, I was <br/>
not ignoring you all, I get the digest version.  Just the opposite, I enjoy a <br/>
healthy dose of communication.<br/>

you&#39;re using to support your position are irrelevant to the discussion I&#39;m<br/>
having.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion I&#39;m still having is passing on information about a political<br/>
movement within homeschooling that is invisible to many unschoolers and that<br/>
it is important to be aware of for 2 reasons: 1) so people can be aware that<br/>
not all people who seem to be working for homeschooling rights -- like HSLDA<br/>
-- are working towards what is best for all homeschoolers. They are working<br/>
towards what is best for their religious and political agenda, 2) so people<br/>
can offer informed opinions on the broad spectrum of what the word<br/>
homeschooling encompasses.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be arguing that divisions between people are wrong. No one here<br/>
is supporting *creating* division or keeping separate from other<br/>
homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
You seem to be arguing that not all fundamentalist Christians want to be<br/>
separate. No one here has said that.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be arguing that informing people of a political movement will<br/>
serve to further divide us when we should be trying to work together. Well,<br/>
1) I know the Christian Homeschooling movement doesn&#39;t want to work *with*<br/>
me. But they do want me to believe they&#39;re working *for* me. 2) They want<br/>
the division to protect themselves. Why would I force a desire for working<br/>
together towards a common goal on them? That would be rude.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What kind of wrongdoings are you referring to?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important for people to recognize the *effects* the Christian<br/>
Homeschool movement could have on their own ability to homeschool. I would<br/>
label Christian Homeschoolers manipulating wording in political activities<br/>
so that it implies they&#39;re representing all homeschoolers as wrong doing.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;d clearly represent their political actions as *only* representing<br/>
the Christian Homeschooling movement, then -- other than helping people<br/>
understand the breadth of practices that the word homeschooling encompasses<br/>
-- there&#39;d be little reason to discuss them.<br/>
<br/>
People often need a place to vent their frustrations with homeschooling<br/>
groups they thought were inclusive but turned out to exclusivistic (is that<br/>
a word?) Christian. It&#39;s sad that people get hurt but exclusive groups have<br/>
a right to exist. Being informed is the best cure. So people can avoid such<br/>
groups in the first place or at least go in knowing that their intent is to<br/>
exclude.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I understand what &quot;secular&quot; means.  That is what was so odd about getting<br/>
&gt; banned from that group.  When I joined it, I &quot;assumed&quot; unschoolers might be<br/>
&gt; more <br/>
&gt; prevalant (? on spelling) in a &quot;secular&quot; group!!! Surprise, surprise, need I<br/>
&gt; say more!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So it seems you don&#39;t know what secular means. Secular means not religiously<br/>
based. It says nothing about homeschooling style or how else they might<br/>
decide to separate themselves from other homeschooling groups.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand an inclusive group should be inclusive of styles as well<br/>
as race and religion. If it isn&#39;t, then the people running are ignorant<br/>
about the breadth of styles that homeschooling encompasses and are perhaps<br/>
assuming homeschooling is only the range they&#39;re familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t even refer to &quot;secular&quot; or &quot;christian&quot; in FIELD TRIPS!!!.  We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; simply home educators and home education families. Just a bunch of Kids (ages<br/>
&gt; preborn-?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good for you!<br/>
<br/>
But what does that have to do with the discussion about the existence of a<br/>
politically motivated Christian Homeschooling movement?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The article which was referred to that listed &quot;unschooling as sin&quot;.  I<br/>
&gt; totally disagreed with that statement.  The author is mixing a religious term<br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; an &quot;educational method&quot;.  There is no way &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;sin&quot; can be used<br/>
&gt; in the same phrase!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is irrelevant whether you agree or not. The person who wrote it does<br/>
agree and is part of a political group of people who also agree. People<br/>
exist in large numbers who agree with the statement regardless of whether<br/>
you agree or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do we, unschoolers, care what anybody chooses for their &quot;teaching<br/>
&gt; tools&quot;?? Let them, isn&#39;t that part of freedom to home education!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then you missed the point of why Sandra mentioned the types of science and<br/>
history they teach. She isn&#39;t bringing it up because it&#39;s wrong for them to<br/>
do what they do. She brought it up because it&#39;s *why* they don&#39;t want the<br/>
government to look closely at what they do. I&#39;d also add in that they want<br/>
to limit how far the government can look at what they do because they want<br/>
to be able to parent in ways that the general population would frown on.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t understand the goals of a group and why they&#39;re doing what<br/>
they&#39;re doing then it&#39;s harder to see the ramifications of legislation they<br/>
may try to get passed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The issue <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want is when the govt sticks its head in and says &quot;be under a certain<br/>
&gt; curriculum/umbrella or don&#39;t home educate&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most people would willing to back legislation that ensures that freedom.<br/>
Most people don&#39;t like to be politically involved. They like to support<br/>
fellow homeschoolers who will doing the boring dull work for them. But they<br/>
should be aware that there are agendas homeschooling rights that are driving<br/>
homeschooling legislation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; HSLDA completely agrees that the govt should NOT have any say about what<br/>
&gt; curriculum is used within home education families.  HSLDA only asks that each<br/>
&gt; family have a &quot;plan&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On their application it says that the person signing it agrees:<br/>
<br/>
To exercise diligence in teaching our children in a responsible way.<br/>
To use a clearly organized program of education to instruct our children.<br/>
To keep records of each child&#39;s educational progress.<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
That all the information presented on this form to be best of our knowledge<br/>
is true and accurate.<br/>
<br/>
The first is vague and could be interpreted in whatever way HSLDA wants. It<br/>
would be a stretch for the second to describe unschooling. The third is<br/>
doable if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Could an unschooler claim that it&#39;s true and accurate to describe<br/>
unschooling as a &quot;clearly organized program&quot;? If HSLDA deems that your case<br/>
would harm their goal of keeping out government intrusion they can point to<br/>
that clause and say you misrepresented yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I personally spoke, in person, with the attorney who<br/>
&gt; represents Missouri concerning this &quot;plan&quot;.  The bottom line, if anything<br/>
&gt; happens <br/>
&gt; and we call them for representation, we need to give them whatever we can that<br/>
&gt; &quot;proves&quot; our kid has received their home education.  Its simply giving them<br/>
&gt; &quot;evidence&quot; that they can show a judge, if need be, to BACK off and get out of<br/>
&gt; our <br/>
&gt; HOME EDUCATION.  They know what &quot;unschooling&quot; is.  They also give full credit<br/>
&gt; to Mr. Holt and unschoolers for &quot;spearheading&quot; the home education movement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They also state clearly somewhere that they can pick and choose who to<br/>
represent. HSLDA is not legal insurance. They will choose which cases will<br/>
further their own agenda. They will decide how to present a case that will<br/>
help their political movement the most which may conflict with the needs of<br/>
the client.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Please do not get on the tangent about the cons of HSLDA.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t see how HSLDA ties in and that their political agenda is the<br/>
same political agenda driving the Christian Homeschooling movement, then you<br/>
aren&#39;t understanding what the discussion is about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bottom line, if we<br/>
&gt; need them to represent them, they want &quot;something&quot; to show that judge.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously they want paper work to create a case from. But if your style of<br/>
homeschooling would hurt their agenda then they can decline to represent<br/>
you. They have no interest in helping unschoolers have an easier time<br/>
homeschooling. They only care about keeping the government out of the<br/>
families who hold the same views as they do. If your case would help them<br/>
further that, then they&#39;d represent you. But if it hurt their goals, they&#39;d<br/>
refuse.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I understand this fact concerning a portion of the Christian Homeschooling<br/>
&gt; Group.  They have made this choice.  How in the world does this affect<br/>
&gt; unschoolers??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Big money behind a big political movement that extends far beyond<br/>
homeschooling. Homeschooling is just the intersection between our lives and<br/>
theirs that we happen to be aware of. But there are lots of groups promoting<br/>
&quot;family values&quot; that are also part of the political movement. The wording of<br/>
petitions against the UN Children&#39;s Rights is designed to appeal to people<br/>
beyond fundamentalist Christianity so they can tap voting power that&#39;s<br/>
greater than their numbers. They&#39;re savvy, heavily funded, and well<br/>
organized. The opposing stance isn&#39;t. So which stance holds sway?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschoolers are brave enough to stand on their own 2 feet and<br/>
&gt; continue <br/>
&gt; their journey.  Some unschoolers have chosen they do not want to join groups<br/>
&gt; that require these statements.  If they wanted to, and they tried, when they<br/>
&gt; knew <br/>
&gt; they would not be accepted, why join?  Find another group.  What&#39;s the deal??<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m confused on this one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people join perfectly fine groups that then turn Statement of Faith.<br/>
<br/>
Some people assume that any homeschooling group is all inclusive and it<br/>
takes time to pick up the clues. Even a statement of faith may seem<br/>
innocuous.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t have a choice about groups and being beginners they want<br/>
others to help them. Most people, sadly -- and I think school plays a big<br/>
part -- are used to leaning on others to point them in the right direction.<br/>
Most people aren&#39;t used to seeing a problem -- lack of support for<br/>
unschooling -- and creating a solution -- creating their own group.<br/>
<br/>
People should drop out of groups that don&#39;t suit them. They should start<br/>
their own.<br/>
<br/>
But we can offer at least compassion (and help on starting their own groups)<br/>
when they are burned by something that they didn&#39;t even realize could get<br/>
hot.<br/>

I had to read this twice. The Christian right always maintains tht <br/>
is is the *other* side that is heavily-funded, orgbanzied and savvy <br/>
while the Christina right is asleep to their duty to God and not <br/>
generous enough in their pocketbooks or active enough <br/>
politically. Wonder which is truer?<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed your whole post Joyce. What&#39;s amazing to me is that <br/>
there is anyone who homeschools who *isn&#39;t* aware of the <br/>
Christian fundamentalist homeschooling world. <br/>
<br/>
The other day, I rec&#39;d an invitation to hear a &quot;well-known&quot; speaker <br/>
(never heard of him) defend our right to spank our children and <br/>
how the government is interfering with that right. He plans to <br/>
provide humorous situations that resulted from spanking in <br/>
families and cite statistics proving that spanked children are <br/>
better-behaved than those who aren&#39;t. Finally, he plans to explain <br/>
how the government is opposing our freedom to parent as we <br/>
wish. He&#39;s been on national TV shows where people are <br/>
stunned by his radical approach to parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I rec&#39;d this flyer at a homeschool co-op that is deliberately <br/>
inclusive of all Christian faiths, though not inclusive of all faiths. <br/>
The leadership didn&#39;t see a problem with the distribution of this <br/>
flyer to all the constituents (not realizing that not every Christian <br/>
spanks). But I&#39;ve been around this form of homeschooling my <br/>
entier homeschooling life so it wasn&#39;t so shocking as it was a <br/>
reminder that that part of homeschooling is alive and well and <br/>
often, dominant.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I am not stating that one is bigger than the other, just that both sides <br/>

outspoken on this issue.  Neither are without their wrongdoings. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the politics of homeschooling in the English speaking world, what <br/>
would you say are the &quot;wrongdoings&quot; of unschoolers?  Of secular homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The article which was referred to that listed &quot;unschooling as sin&quot;.  I <br/>
<br/>
totally disagreed with that statement.  The author is mixing a religious term <br/>
with <br/>
<br/>
an &quot;educational method&quot;.  There is no way &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;sin&quot; can be used <br/>
<br/>
in the same phrase!!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have done it, and explained their reasoning with Bible <br/>
references.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They&#39;re teaching <br/>
<br/>
revisionist and particularly written-for-Christians history and science.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do we, unschoolers, care what anybody chooses for their &quot;teaching <br/>
<br/>
tools&quot;?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As to teaching, I don&#39;t much care.<br/>
<br/>
As to politics, they make us look stupid.  (They make themselves look stupid, <br/>
and other homeschoolers by extension.)<br/>
<br/>
As to the social ramificatons, my children will grow up and live side by <br/>
sidewith people who have been fed a pack of lies their whole lives, AND part of <br/>
the package is that anyone who disputes anything they&#39;ve been taught is speaking <br/>
with the voice of Satan to test their faith and tempt their soul.  But that&#39;s <br/>
not what we&#39;ve been talking about here at all.  We&#39;ve been talking about the <br/>
politics of homes schooling, and the realities.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;HSLDA completely agrees that the govt should NOT have any say about what <br/>
<br/>
curriculum is used within home education families. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  As long as they&#39;re using a curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The bottom line, if anything happens <br/>
<br/>
and we call them for representation, we need to give them whatever we can <br/>
that <br/>
<br/>
&quot;proves&quot; our kid has received their home education. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t represent unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; They know what &quot;unschooling&quot; is.  They also give full credit <br/>
<br/>
to Mr. Holt and unschoolers for &quot;spearheading&quot; the home education movement.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cite something to prove this statement, please.<br/>
Quote something, show us a website, or something.  Because what I&#39;ve seen in <br/>
writing from them is that Christian Homeschoolers made homeschooling legal in <br/>
every state.  It&#39;s a lie, but they tell it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Please do not get on the tangent about the cons of HSLDA. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s central, not tangential.  It&#39;s at the core of what all homeschoolers <br/>
need to have at least a passing awareness of, if they intend to speak for <br/>
homeschooelrs in general at any level.  And it helps just for their own awareness so <br/>
when they&#39;re in a rough conversation about homeschooling they&#39;re not caught <br/>
deer-in-the-headlights.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I remember awhile back, Sandra there was an <br/>
<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; guide for use if you needed it to show the state as part of <br/>
recordkeeping.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you mean Carol Narigon&#39;s sample for the state of Ohio.  It&#39;s here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a><br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt HSLDA would think much of it.   And it wasn&#39;t for <br/>
recordkeeping, it was for showing the state what a family intended to &quot;cover.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This is what we basically developed and showed HSLDA, and that was fine.  <br/>
It <br/>
<br/>
was sketchy, but it was an outline of the main goals.  Bottom line, if we <br/>
<br/>
need them to represent them, they want &quot;something&quot; to show that judge.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So are you signed up with HSLDA?  Is that why you&#39;re trying to get people not <br/>
to look at it, not to discuss it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How in the world does this affect <br/>
<br/>
unschoolers?? Unschoolers are brave enough to stand on their own 2 feet and <br/>
continue <br/>
<br/>
their journey. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been trying to tell you how it affects unschoolers and ALL <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Spc in Mo, how long have you been an unschooler, if you are an unschooler?<br/>
How old are your children?<br/>

Can you use &quot;sin&quot; and adultery in the same sentence? &quot;Sin&quot; and murder? <br/>
&quot;Sin&quot; and dishonesty? Unschooling is like adultery in some people&#39;s <br/>

commands of God in regard to how to be married/how to raise children.<br/>
