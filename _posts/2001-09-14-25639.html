<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555401086">Hello,<br/>
  Sorry Bridget, not trying to pick on you but...the following is not<br/>
Sanda&#39;s fault. If someone is scared about posting, that is FEAR that is<br/>
stopping them. I don&#39;t think Sandra&#39;s intention is to belittle people, and I<br/>
don&#39;t think she or anyone should compromise her unschooling opinions.<br/>
Sorry, fearful person, do I know you?<br/>
Wendy<br/>
And I know at leaast one person who said she won&#39;t post much of anything<br/>
here even when she has a question or comment because she fears she will<br/>
be &#39;eaten alive&#39;  by Sandra and those who went right after me.<br/>
I&#39;m sure Sandra has helped lots of people.  I&#39;m also sure she has pushed<br/>
some away without even knowing it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You may be right.  Communism believes all are equal...not just white, male<br/>
landowners.<br/>
<br/>
May I direct you to the Progressive Labor Party (www.plp.org).  The<br/>
organization works against racism, sexism, actually believes that being a<br/>
housewife and raising children is for the greater good, sees children as the<br/>
future of society, and that it should be seen as any other profession<br/>
working for the greater good of society.<br/>
