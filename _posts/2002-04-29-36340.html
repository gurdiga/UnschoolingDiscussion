 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not offended by the subject . . . I just think it&#39;s FUNNY.  <br/>
<br/>
I also like reading the posts . . . irritating, funny, or no.  However, if <br/>
you dislike the posts on this subject that bear my name as the author, I <br/>
would not mind in the slightest if they were deleted without review or <br/>
comment.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the &quot;TCS people&quot; (which is what you called them, and which label <br/>
also bemused me) might very well be that previously unidentified group of <br/>
people to which Lynda referred not so very long ago.  But, that&#39;s a whole <br/>
&#39;nother subject . . . <br/>
<br/>
Kate Davis, who is thinking about either offering to pay $10.00, in addition <br/>
to that offered by Sandra, to stop this thread, or taking Sandra up on the <br/>
offer, pocketing the $10.00, and declining to post anything further on this <br/>
subject (no matter how much she might like to)<br/>
