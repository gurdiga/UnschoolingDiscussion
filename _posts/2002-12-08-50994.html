<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796671549">BOSTON - A little-noticed provision in a new federal education law is <br/>
requiring high schools to hand over to military recruiters some key <br/>
information about its juniors and seniors:<br/>
name, address and phone number.<br/>
<br/>
The Pentagon says the information will help it recruit young people to defend <br/>
their country. But the new law disturbs parents and administrators in some <br/>
liberal communities that aren&#39;t exactly gung-ho about the armed forces.<br/>
<br/>
Some say the law violates students&#39; privacy and creates a moral dilemma over <br/>
the military&#39;s &#39;&#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39;&#39; policy on gays.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;I find it appalling that the school is sending out letters to do the job of <br/>
the military,&#39;&#39; said Amy Lang, the parent of a student at Cambridge Rindge <br/>
and Latin School, where Coke was once banned in a protest against the soda <br/>
giant&#39;s investments in apartheid South Africa. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s clearly an invasion of <br/>
my daughter&#39;s privacy.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The No Child Left Behind law, signed last January, pumps billions into <br/>
education but also gives military recruiters access to the names, addresses <br/>
and phone numbers of students in 22,000 schools. The law also says that <br/>
schools must give the military the same access to their campuses that <br/>
businesses and college recruiters enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
School systems that fail to comply could lose federal money. The measure also <br/>
applies to private schools receiving federal funding. But Quaker schools and <br/>
others that have a religious objection to military service can get out of the <br/>
requirement.<br/>
<br/>
Students and parents who oppose the law can keep their information from being <br/>
turned over to the military, but they must sign and return an &#39;&#39;opt-out&#39;&#39; <br/>
form.<br/>
<br/>
The Boston school system, which has 7,500 juniors and seniors, included the <br/>
opt-out notice in a take-home student handbook, but fewer than a dozen <br/>
parents opted out.<br/>
<br/>
So far, 95 percent of the nation&#39;s schools are in compliance, said Pentagon <br/>
spokeswoman Maj. Sandra Troeber. She would not identify the other schools. <br/>
But Education Department spokesman Dan Langan said that the current focus is <br/>
on cooperation and that no schools have been sanctioned.<br/>
<br/>
Federal law already requires men to register with the Selective Service <br/>
within 30 days of turning 18. The new law, however, enables the Pentagon to <br/>
reach potential recruits when they are 15 or 16.<br/>
<br/>
In New York City, Daniel Alterman was taken aback when his 15-year-old son, a <br/>
junior at Stuyvesant High, received a recruitment letter.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;Parents are in the dark,&#39;&#39; Alterman said. &#39;&#39;It freaked me out. I didn&#39;t <br/>
sign up to support the military effort.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Alterman said after he opted out, his son received another letter, this one <br/>
promoting scholarships. &#39;&#39;It was very seductive. They didn&#39;t say anything <br/>
about risk to personal safety,&#39;&#39; Alterman said.<br/>
<br/>
Among those objecting to the new requirements is the New York City chapter of <br/>
the American Civil Liberties Union. Executive director Donna Lieberman said <br/>
that the opt-out provision is inadequate and that schools should be doing <br/>
more to protect students&#39; privacy.<br/>
<br/>
In a letter last month, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Education <br/>
Secretary Rod Paige reminded high school administrators of their duty, and <br/>
cited &#39;&#39;the excellent educational opportunities the military affords, as well <br/>
as an environment that encourages the development of strong character and <br/>
leadership skills.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The Pentagon said better access to students could also hold down the rising <br/>
costs of recruitment. Over the past decade, the cost per recruit has nearly <br/>
doubled from $6,500 to $11,600.<br/>
<br/>
Before the law, military recruiters could meet with students in Cambridge and <br/>
Northampton on campus only if the student sought them out, and then only at a <br/>
meeting attended by a guidance counselor. But Cambridge held a military <br/>
career fair at the high school a month ago.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;It&#39;s a vast departure from the way we&#39;ve done business,&#39;&#39; said Donna <br/>
Harlan, an associate superintendent in the Northampton school system. &#39;&#39;We <br/>
are not in the business of giving lists of names of kids to anybody. That was <br/>
tough. The issue was if we were to receive federal or state money, we had to <br/>
comply with the law.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
The law also spelled the end of a 6-year ban on military recruiting on campus <br/>
in Portland, Ore. After contending that the &#39;&#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39;&#39; policy <br/>
discriminates against gays, the school system now gives recruiters a shot at <br/>
its 16,000 students.<br/>
<br/>
In Massachusetts, Framingham High senior April Middleton decided over lunch <br/>
recently that maybe the military is in her future after talking with Army <br/>
National Guard Sgt. Louis Perrin, a recruiter who visited the cafeteria.<br/>
<br/>
Middleton, 18, said she plans to enlist after she graduates, and the prospect <br/>
of war has not scared her off. &#39;&#39;Sometimes you&#39;ve got to make sacrifices,&#39;&#39; <br/>
she said.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, however, recruiters battle hostility.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;One teacher said we were trying to brainwash kids. All we were doing was <br/>
handing out pencils,&#39;&#39; Perrin said. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re not trying to invade anybody&#39;s <br/>
privacy. We&#39;re just trying to protect their freedoms.&#39;&#39;<br/>
