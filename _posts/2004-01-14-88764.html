<div id="ygrps-yiv-276896539">A few quotes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CONDITION:  If the designated condition is met, the Script Commands up to the <br/>
Condition End will be executed.  If the condition is not met, they will be <br/>
passed by.<br/>
<br/>
TO END:  This command takes you to the Script Branch End when the conditions <br/>
within a Repeat or Sort script branch are fulfilled.  In the in-game example, <br/>
&quot;To End&quot; is entered after the correct password is given.<br/>
<br/>
Two small paragraphs from page 49 of 150 pages of the &quot;Strategy Guide&quot; for <br/>
the Playstation II game RPG Maker II.<br/>
<br/>
This is what Marty wanted for his birthday.  He turns 15 tomorrow.  We&#39;re <br/>
giving it to him tonight, because the whole family will be home.<br/>
<br/>
The whole book is about script commands, and substituting variables for <br/>
attributes, and all manner of computer-programming and logic stuff.  He could take <br/>
a college course to learn those terms, but I doubt he&#39;ll come across any he <br/>
doesn&#39;t already know and if he does he&#39;ll figure them out in practical ways, as <br/>
he goes, and when/if he needs to know them for a project or a job, there <br/>
they&#39;ll be.  And they won&#39;t be in his head as memorized definitions, but as 3-D <br/>
pictures with histories and pasts, failures and successes.   <br/>
<br/>
He figured RPG Maker out (the first version) very painstakingly over many <br/>
months of trial and error.  This one will be  much easier because it&#39;s the &quot;new <br/>
improved&quot; version &lt;g&gt; and because the strategy book shows &quot;screenshots&quot; <br/>
(pictures of what he will be seeing at that point in the instructions or options, as <br/>
he builds his game) and has tips and clarifications for the little 50 page <br/>
booklet that comes with the game.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to talk him into wanting a different game, when we were discussing <br/>
this before Christmas.  We&#39;re lucky with Marty.  We can discuss a bunch of stuff <br/>
before Christmas, and decide from that what to wait for his birthday to do.  <br/>
RPG Maker II seemed to be too dry and technical and difficult.  I thought he <br/>
should get some merry four-player game.<br/>
<br/>
He said he LIKES figuring out the little details of designing the games and <br/>
worlds and characters.  <br/>
<br/>
So there it is.   Another example of the depths &quot;playing&quot; can reach. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
(And the reading level of that sort of technical writing is nothing to scoff <br/>
at either.)<br/>
