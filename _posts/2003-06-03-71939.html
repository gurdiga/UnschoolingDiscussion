<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145463385">The whole mirror thing makes for great pictures, too.  I sat my little 6 month old in front of a big mirror and snapped off dozens of pictures (digital) of her grinning at herself, talking to herself, flapping her arms, touching her own hand, and looking at the camera *through* the mirror.  It made for some interesting photos to send home to the grandmas<br/>

Lars took a really cool picture of himself in the car, using the little<br/>
mirror on the visor above the passenger seat.  I was surprised at how well<br/>
it turned out.<br/>
