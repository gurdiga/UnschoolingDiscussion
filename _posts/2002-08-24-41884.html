<div id="ygrps-yiv-923793285"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So we stay here in PA, crappy laws and all.  Of course my son is only six,<br/>
&gt; and we don&#39;t have to report him until he&#39;s eight.  I REALLY hope we have a<br/>
&gt; new, less restrictive law in place by then.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary J,<br/>
<br/>
But if you don&#39;t have a better law by then, you&#39;ll still stay in PA because<br/>
you have strong ties there.  That&#39;s nice for me to hear.  I have to agree<br/>
with (someone) who commented that most of the responses to the posts about<br/>
PA truency laws were suggestions to move to a more tolerant state.  Great,<br/>
if that works for you.  But not everyone has that choice.<br/>
<br/>
I knew my husband&#39;s job would move us around a lot when I married him; I<br/>
can&#39;t say I really considered how it would affect my homeschooling.  But<br/>
someday we could concievably end up in PA (there is an army post there). On<br/>
the positive side, I recall that I&#39;ve seen written somewhere<br/>
(unschooling.com?) that unschooling *is* legal in every state.  It seems to<br/>
take a lot more work in some places to make our &quot;brand&quot; of homeschooling<br/>
look the way the state wants it to look, but it&#39;s possible, right?  Someone<br/>
please correct me if I&#39;m wrong; it truly matters to me.<br/>

portfolio to make themselves look the way the state wants it to <br/>
look.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year I was very relaxed for half of the year and totally <br/>
unschooled for the other half.  I was able to come up with all kinds <br/>
of stuff to &quot;prove&quot; myself.  Photocopies of Top Secret Adventures, <br/>
brochures from places we visited, an extensive book list, a photocopy <br/>
of a letter she wrote to a penpal, etc.  I&#39;m sure any unschooler <br/>
could learn to speak &quot;educationese&quot; and make up an impressive <br/>
portfolio.  <br/>
<br/>
It really isn&#39;t a big deal UNLESS you get a superintendent who wants <br/>
to make your life miserable.  However, it is one more thing to worry <br/>
about.  All year I have to keep in mind that we are going to be <br/>
needing this and when I see something that looks like it would be <br/>
good for a subject in a portfolio, I make sure to photocopy it so I <br/>
have it.  <br/>

variations from base to base? They don&#39;t adhere to the regulations in the<br/>
state the base is in, do they?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t have any of these kind of requirements here in Utah, but I keep a <br/>
scrapbook for each of my kids anyway. At first I did it because it helped me <br/>
to see the learning and progress. After awhile, though, it just sort of <br/>
became a fun way to keep track of some of the really cool things we get to <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
This year&#39;s scrapbook is filled with theater programs, pictures they&#39;ve <br/>
drawn, things they&#39;ve written, brochures from museums and zoos, photos of <br/>
fun activities and mementos of the several unschooling road trips we&#39;ve been <br/>
on. The kids and I really enjoy looking back over them. And if I ever doubt <br/>
that they&#39;re learning and growing and always gaining new skills, all I have <br/>
to do is look at last year&#39;s book.<br/>
<br/>
