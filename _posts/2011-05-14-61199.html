<div id="ygrps-yiv-692125281">Toontown is less reading heavy, I don&#39;t know about keyboard use though. If he <br/>
likes the Lego series, there&#39;s Lego Batman and Lego Indiana Jones and newly <br/>
released Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. Simon used to sit on my lap and work <br/>
through games like Heroes of Might and Magic. I&#39;d read the text and he&#39;d control <br/>
the players. And Linnaea was playing World of Warcraft when she was 5 or maybe <br/>
4. She liked me to play her character and get lots of money so that she could go <br/>
buy pets. She had a stream of cats behind  her and Jill Parmer helped me to get <br/>
her a gopher once back when we had a U.S. account. The game, for her, was <br/>
nothing like the game for me. But she had fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801690433">Adventure Quest is a single player RPG, somewhat similar to WoW.  Most of<br/>
the reading can be skipped (that&#39;s how my son played it when he was<br/>
younger).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10155693">My 4.5 yr old is currently LOVING the Little Big Planet games.  His older brother (6) likes playing through levels, but Z particularly loves playing with the level-creation part of the game.  He builds amazing structures, makes sackbots with crazy costumes, plays with gravity and lighting and music, and it&#39;s super amazing fun.  Highly recommend.<br/>
<br/>
Other games he likes are<br/>
- Lego Batman<br/>
- Lego Clone Wars<br/>
- Lego Indiana Jones<br/>
- Castle Crashers<br/>
- Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn (wii)<br/>
<br/>
On the computer he gravitates to:<br/>
- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.poissonrouge.com/">http://www.poissonrouge.com/</a><br/>
- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://boowakwala.uptoten.com/">http://boowakwala.uptoten.com/</a><br/>

- and sites associated with tv shows he likes<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, rereading your request and thinking about computer games that would be more epic. I wonder if your son would like:<br/>
- Lego Universe<br/>
- Robloxx<br/>
- Kung Fu Panda World<br/>
- Club Penguin<br/>
- Poptropica<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064720007">My son will be five in September. He loves the Lego games. He recently got a newer Star Wars game (Clone Wars) and he&#39;s very excited about the new Pirates of the Caribbean. We also have Harry Potter and Batman.<br/>
<br/>
One other game my kids enjoy is Worms. DH originally played the DOS version in the mid-90s, LOL. We have a much newer version on the iPod and the XBox. It&#39;s a turn-based game where you try to blow up your opponent&#39;s worms. There&#39;s a fair amount of strategy involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694896558">Thanks so much for the great suggestions. He chose to bring home Lego Batman<br/>
from the game store this weekend and has been pretty immersed in that for a<br/>
few days. He and my husband set up a character for him on World of Warcraft<br/>
and he has been exploring that a bit also. Little Big Planet looks<br/>
absolutely amazing! I wish that we had a PS3 or that it was made for the<br/>
xbox or ds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
