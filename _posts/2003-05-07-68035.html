 </span></blockquote>I think we are getting a GREAT deal for JP&#39;s karate class.  Although, I do <br/>
not know what level his instructor is ( brown, black belt, etc)   He is a <br/>
very nice man.  Very &quot;formal&quot; karate stuff, ( yessir, no sir, all that stuff) <br/>
 But, he does a great job with the kids, he is very aware and attentive to <br/>
what each student needs to work on.  He kind of reminds me of a vietnam vet <br/>
hippie type dude.  very cool.  :-).  Anyway, back to the fees.  This fella <br/>
offers a 2 week free trial at the beginning of every summer to homeschoolers <br/>
to see if they would like to sign up for the summer class.   About 30 folks <br/>
signed up for the trial, about 20 showed up, and only 4 stayed. ( I have no <br/>
idea why, I guess it was not thier cuppa tea)  He already had about a dozen <br/>
students.    He has class 3 times a week MWF, for an hour (1:30-2:30)  They <br/>
hold class at the local boys and girls club at the Salvation Army rec center. <br/>
 I was shocked when he told me the monthly fee.  I was expecting it to be a <br/>
lot, since he offered  a free trial to get us hooked.. lol.   We had to pay a <br/>
yearly fee of $10 to use the rec center.  The instructor charges $27/month <br/>
for the class.  I was expecting something well over $50.    I do know they <br/>
have tests, because JP was talking about them  They have some yellow and <br/>
orange belts in the class.   <br/>
<br/>
I have been SOO lucky in finding wonderful folks and programs for my kids <br/>
interests that  I can not help them learn ( not to the extent they want to <br/>
learn)   I barter french  &quot;time&quot; with a lady for Anna.  Her daughter comes <br/>
over and takes guitar  from my Dh.  Anna&#39;s piano lessons are only $10 per <br/>
week for a 45 min lesson.  We paid $27.50 for that length of lesson for <br/>
Landon about 5 years ago!!.   And now, JP&#39;s karate class turns out to be very <br/>
affordable too.  The resources are out there, you just have to network and <br/>
LOOK!<br/>

Yeah the kid rates here are around $30 a month, but adults are way more and <br/>
Kirby has had the honor of being considered an adult (for rates purposes) <br/>
since he turned 15.  Almost $500 a  year.  Cheaper than paying monthly.  So <br/>
it goes.  I&#39;m glad he still loves that school.  Otherwise he might be our <br/>
total couch potato.<br/>
<br/>
(Not totally, because he&#39;s doing SCA medieval armored combat, but only <br/>
lately.)<br/>
