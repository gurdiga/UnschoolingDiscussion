<div id="ygrps-yiv-581510129">Off to Target:<br/>
<br/>
I think you handle it like you would if dh needed to do something in which<br/>
he needed you to come along.  He would probably ask something like &quot;Hey<br/>
Dawn, I need to go to Target today and I need you to come along because of<br/>
such and such.  What is your plan today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So with Zac, how about &quot;Hey Zach later today I need to drop this stuff off<br/>
at Target and since Mom is working, I need you to come with me.  Do you<br/>
think morning or afternoon would be better?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say Zac really isn&#39;t too interested in Target, dh might respond with<br/>
&quot;Well, there is a park around the corner from the store.  How about we pack<br/>
a lunch and have a picnic on the way back?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the key is trying to deal with Zac the way you would a friend, not a<br/>
servant.  I continue to work daily on this.....today isn&#39;t a good day<br/>
:(   But I know what my goal is and I am having more good days than bad.<br/>

errand is just an errand.  And doesn&#39;t require a trip to the park to make it <br/>

I&#39;m confused, why not make it palatable?  Why not turn *your* errand<br/>
into something fun for the *child*?  Might as well make as much as<br/>
possible win-win, right?  If your child wants to do something that<br/>
doesn&#39;t really interest you, do you bring along a book or a snack or<br/>
your journal or something to make it a little better for you?  Why not<br/>
offer this same courtesy to children?  Seriously wondering,<br/>
