shower, &quot;Hey Robert, grab my panties out of my bag please!!!&quot; He said he waited <br/>
for a good five minutes and then walked out in his towel to find his brother and <br/>
their 2 cousins holding their bellies with laughter. Phil asked what they <br/>
were laughing about and why the hell didn&#39;t Rob bring him his drawers? Robert <br/>
fell back onto his bed and held up Phil&#39;s underwear and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you mean <br/>
your panties?&quot;<br/>

Before our boys were born, we had Christopher and five girls in the house.  <br/>
He was severely outnumbered!  He often called his underwear his &#39;panties&#39; <br/>
just from hearing us say it so much and I tend to call his unders panties <br/>
too, just makes life easier I guess.<br/>
<br/>
When Ethan came along he couldn&#39;t wait for him to start wearing underwear so <br/>
he wouldn&#39;t have to call them panties anymore, on purpose or by accident.  <br/>
Ethan just turned three and we also now have Caeleb who is 2 but neither are <br/>
out of diapers yet.  Funny thing is, Ethan and Caeleb both call them <br/>
panties!!  Poor Chris is fighting a losing battle!<br/>
