 </span></blockquote>My experience is the opposite.  When children realize that adults have<br/>
been lying to them about the easter bunny and Santa Claus,  they<br/>
inevitably wonder what else they have been lied to about.  Some become<br/>
cynical -- which is harder to undo than is creating a sense of the<br/>
miraculous.  (I&#39;d be quite willing to bet -- if Quakers didn&#39;t have a<br/>
testimony against gambling -- that more Christians have been unmade that<br/>
way than made.) We choose to celebrate the mysterious (the writing of<br/>
the Mozart Requiem or the painting the Sistine Chapel) or the miraculous<br/>
(the original creation of life from inorganic matter)<br/>
<br/>
The bigger challenge for me has always been making sure children are in<br/>
charge of their own fantasy play -- in our culture, Santa Claus and the<br/>
Easter Bunny are just one step removed from Barbie and G.I. Joe.  We<br/>
know that our kids can do better, A LOT better, than this if we just<br/>
give them the opportunity.<br/>

be happy to share it for anyone who asks as a Word attachment for anyone<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013060031">My family doesn&#39;t do Halloween either.  Everything that is done on Halloween,<br/>
from bobbing for apples to wearing costumes, stems from pagan rituals.  Even<br/>
making a jack-o-lantern.  Our church holds a Hallelujah Night which gives the<br/>
families in our church an alternative.My kids love it.  No costumes, but lots of<br/>
games, singing, and FOOD!<br/>
<br/>
And about the santa thing.  I have a friend of mine who honestly doesn&#39;t let<br/>
anything into his family&#39;s house that has anything to do with santa.  He thinks<br/>
it&#39;s a little peculiar that the letters from Santa also spell satan. :-)<br/>
Anyway, we aren&#39;t that strict but we don&#39;t do santa, fairies or bunnies either.<br/>
I believe my kids need to center their lives around the true meanings behind the<br/>
holidays.  Not fairy tale myths or falsehoods.  Like you said it&#39;s just like<br/>
lying.<br/>
<br/>
But that is the way my family is, not everyone celebrates that way and that&#39;s<br/>
cool.  Everyone has their own view points. Mine just happens to be right!  Just<br/>
kidding!  I&#39;m trying to put a joke in here or there!!  Just to lighten things up<br/>
a little.<br/>

 i have had a disadvantage there i think and am sooo glad that the religion <br/>
that is my own has plenty of it to ignite those other senses besides <br/>
intellectual...  it is easy to just &quot;be practical&quot; for me, but if that is our <br/>
focus we sure miss out on a lot...  honesty is important but it is not about <br/>
that.  if we look deeper than face value and literalism-- we can see that we <br/>
can share the &quot;embodiment of&quot; or &quot;spirit of&quot; without literally saying &quot;sorry <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, and in my personal experience, the opposite is true.  Adults<br/>
can very easily understand play acting, and can make easy distinctions<br/>
between what is real and what is not.  Play acting does not make me more<br/>
cynical.  But this is much more difficult for children.  (I think you<br/>
are covering for them, thinking that since it has no such effect upon<br/>
you as an adult, it is unlikely to have such an effect on kids.)<br/>
<br/>
But this isn&#39;t the real issue anyway.  The important aspect is how we<br/>
can co-create stories, myths, rituals, meaning with our kids, so that we<br/>
can grow together as families.  The Santa Claus thing, taken by itself<br/>
is static -- it doesn&#39;t change, except that the kids&#39; expectations for<br/>
larger presents grow.  If we can find ways to use Santa Claus in a way<br/>
which nurtures a child&#39;s natural sense of good will -- the Santa Claus<br/>
within -- then it can become very powerful indeed.  But the fact that<br/>
Santa comes with so much baggage attached makes it that much more<br/>
difficutlt.<br/>

I knew a mother that told her son about Santa and the easter bunny.  One day,<br/>
when he was about 4 or so, he heard that they weren&#39;t real and wanted an answer<br/>
out of mommy.  She told him that Santa was just a story and all of the good stuff<br/>
about the giving spirit.  But the question he came back with left her<br/>
speechless!  He asked her, &quot;Then is Jesus real?&quot;  She realized that, as most<br/>
children can&#39;t, her son couldn&#39;t differentiate between real and make-believe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553408479">In our family our six year old insisted on knowing what the Easter Bunny was all<br/>
about.  She was asked what she thought and she said that she thought that Mama was<br/>
doing it.  This was confirmed and my daughter chortled with laughter she thought it<br/>
was wonderful that mama was going around the house doing all this Easter stuff.  She<br/>
thought it was funny too.  No resentment or upset re: being &quot;lied&quot; to.  She saw it<br/>
for what it was,  an attempt on the parents part to delight their children with a<br/>
magical play (which for us has little religious significance).  We have talked a<br/>
little bit about the many world religions which have their god figure either die or<br/>
be killed, and who then comes back to life.  She is only moderately interested.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t try to &quot;trick&quot; the children about Santa (who we have bring gifts every<br/>
Christmas) but as they have grown up the older one finally asked point blank about<br/>
Santa because she already had reasoned that it didn&#39;t really make sense.  She wasn&#39;t<br/>
disappointed as we merely confirmed what she knew.  She then participated in the<br/>
fiction with her sister.<br/>
<br/>
We answer the questions with &quot;What do you think?&quot;  and leave it at that unless they<br/>
get to the point blank stage where they want confirmation or denial of their<br/>
opinion.  I used to worry about it but am reassured by how the kids have responded.<br/>
They really sense the intention of this kind of myth/game/play/theatre/ and because<br/>
we do not try to &quot;convince&quot; them of the &quot;reality&quot; of the myth they don&#39;t seem to feel<br/>
conflicted about it.  Our love for them shines through it all.<br/>

&gt; A true story:<br/>
&gt; I knew a mother that told her son about Santa and the easter bunny.  One day,<br/>
&gt; when he was about 4 or so, he heard that they weren&#39;t real and wanted an answer<br/>
&gt; out of mommy.  She told him that Santa was just a story and all of the good stuff<br/>
&gt; about the giving spirit.  But the question he came back with left her<br/>
&gt; speechless!  He asked her, &quot;Then is Jesus real?&quot;  She realized that, as most<br/>
&gt; children can&#39;t, her son couldn&#39;t differentiate between real and make-believe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just something more to add to the conversation.<br/>
&gt; Living for Him,<br/>
&gt; Faith<br/>
