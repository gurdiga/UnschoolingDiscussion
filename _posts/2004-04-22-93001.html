<div id="ygrps-yiv-450889500">Hi,<br/>
I think I should ost this since fittingly everyone has been on the <br/>
subject of sparks. I was getting a pedicure last night and a teacher <br/>
was on the side of me of course we talked LOL....................I <br/>
was explaining to my son that she was a teacher and that I told her <br/>
that we home school because I just don&#39;t tell anyone that we <br/>
unschool. So my son piped up last night andsaid &quot;Mom you don&#39;t even <br/>
do any school with me&quot; also I would like to add he said it with <br/>
sarcasim LOL....................... Anyway as I am writing I&#39;m <br/>
finding my own answer. I need to tell him about unschooling. I think <br/>
I haven&#39;t is because I don&#39;t want him just telling anyone because he <br/>
is so honest and I&#39;m still trying to explain to him that just <br/>
because someone asks doesn&#39;t mean we need to share ALL of our <br/>
information LOL...................................... <br/>
<br/>
Also I was the person some time ago that was going to go back to <br/>
work and have to put my son into school because I couldn&#39;t see any <br/>
other way(child care). Well I have come to realize that I have seen <br/>
and felt the effects of unschooling over time and I couldn&#39;t do it <br/>
because it goes against the very grain of my soul. <br/>
<br/>
So....... back to my little wonderful boy I said &quot;well honey you <br/>
learn things all the time but if you would like to sit at the table <br/>
like they do at school with workbooks and go over things over and <br/>
over I will if it maks you happy.&quot; his reply was a firm and assured <br/>
NO !!!!!! So as I am writing this I am realizing I need to be <br/>
upfront with my son and explain to him. It&#39;s amazing how in the <br/>
short time that he went to school he already has it ingrained into <br/>
him what learning is !<br/>
