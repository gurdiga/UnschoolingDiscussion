&lt;&lt;  Try reminding yourself that you&#39;re lucky to be <br/>
interrupted by your active, healthy, inquisitive, energetic kids. I <br/>
don&#39;t mean this as a criticism - not saying you should not complain <br/>
because others have it worse, or anything like that. I&#39;m saying to try, <br/>
specifically, to say say specific words to yourself at the moment that <br/>
you&#39;re being stressed by the kids&#39; behavior. Right then, at that <br/>
moment, say to yourself, &quot;I have healthy, inquisitive, <br/>
energetic....kids.&quot; Self-talk is important. Use it to get yourself over <br/>
the rougher times - don&#39;t allow it to make rough times even rougher. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This helped me a lot when Marty was peeing the bed even when he was big, 8.  <br/>
I cleaned up after him, or bought disposable small-adult sized diapers, and I <br/>
thought loving thoughts.  And I reminded myself that some people have children <br/>
who have to be changed in the bed all day and night their whole lives.  I <br/>
have a friend who became quadraplegic at the age of 24, sliding on snow, on an <br/>
innertube in the mountains.   I have helped take care of her.  Cathether.  Bowel <br/>
program.  Feeding by hand.<br/>
<br/>
All Marty needed was supplies and encouragement and time.<br/>
Marty could get up and sit on the toilet just fine.  <br/>
He could get up and take a shower.  <br/>
All I had to do was furnish diapers and do some extra laundry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could have worked up a HUGE frustration and anger and resentment storm and <br/>
shamed him and blamed him and felt sorry for myself about having a big boy who <br/>
peed his bed.<br/>
<br/>
My attitude made a massive difference in my life and his, and his brother&#39;s, <br/>
his sister&#39;s and his dad&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It will make a difference in Marty&#39;s future wife&#39;s life, and his children if <br/>
any, whether or not they&#39;re late to sleep dry all night.<br/>
<br/>
And it was a concious choice on my part.<br/>
<br/>
Someone left this list lately, and specifically complained about my having <br/>
suggested people be glad they don&#39;t have kids who are disabled.   I think it&#39;s <br/>
healthy and wonderful to see the blessings in our lives, and the joys, and the <br/>
benefits.   <br/>
<br/>
Someone at unschooling.com was trying to talk herself out of being more <br/>
gentle and present with her children because she had one who had died.  She was <br/>
afraid she was being too soft, I guess.  So what?  She DID have a child die.  <br/>
That SHOULD change her life.<br/>
<br/>
Being appreciative and loving shouldn&#39;t be things to be ashamed of, but I <br/>
know why they are.  Because we are generally of an overall couple of cultures <br/>
which have taught hard work and deprivation as virtues.   People from other <br/>
cultures have been branded lazy by the predominant cultures, and so people tend <br/>
toward seeing success as being the ideal, and emotional comfort as NOT ideal.<br/>
<br/>
An unhappy mother will not create happy children or a happy home.<br/>
A mother who clings to her frustrations self-righteously and criticizes those <br/>
who try to help her soften and relax is not moving toward more happiness.<br/>

This is so, so true. When we were coming back from New Hampshire two weeks<br/>
ago, we got caught in a massive traffic jam because of torrential downpours<br/>
in NY/ NJ. We were stuck on the Cross Bronx Expressway for 4.5 hours trying<br/>
to cross the bridge into North Jersey. What should have been a 4.5 to 5 hour<br/>
trip total, turned into an 11 hour drive!<br/>
<br/>
All I kept thinking was &quot;We are together and safe. We were not in an<br/>
accident; the van is not totalled and no one is hurt. We are all healthy.&quot; I<br/>
can&#39;t tell you what a difference that made, and I really believe that my<br/>
attitude and mental state kept the kids calm and happy even though dh was<br/>
getting visibly stressed out. Of course, the VCR in the van helped a bit,<br/>
too! ;) I just kept passing out snacks, refilling waters and helping the<br/>
kids pee in a bucket when they had to, which we just poured out the window.<br/>
All the kids just took it in stride, which is pretty amazing, considering<br/>
they&#39;re 7, 5 and 4 and strapped in a carseat for 11 hours straight. I said<br/>
to dh after we pulled up at the inlaws for the night, &quot;Our kids are angels.<br/>
I don&#39;t ever want to hear anything else!&quot;<br/>

My father is an adolescent psychiatrist. When he&#39;d come home from work  <br/>
(dealing with crazy teens and craizier parents!), my mother would start in on  how <br/>
horrible we (my brother and I ) had been ALL DAY. My father would take one  <br/>
look at us, give us each a big hug,  and tell her that she had NO idea how  <br/>
wonderful we were! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perspective!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
