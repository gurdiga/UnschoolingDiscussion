<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435514504">&lt;&lt; I have tried the no set bedtime &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m climbing onto the biggest rock I can see here and trying to make a <br/>
speech, but I can&#39;t whistle loud, and nobody has to listen to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think (I could be wrong) that the recent idea that unschooling requires <br/>
&quot;the no set bedtime&quot; came from some things I&#39;ve written over the years.   If <br/>
so I&#39;d like to clarify some things.  If not, where did it come from?<br/>
<br/>
Our lack of bedtimes came before our homeschooling.<br/>
Our trust that people DO need to eat good food and DO need to sleep and DO <br/>
need to be with their parents came from earlier times of La Leche League and <br/>
reading Mothering Magazine, and observing our kids with the idea that they <br/>
come into the world with instinctive knowledge which can continue to work if <br/>
people don&#39;t snuff it.  (The example of the dad telling his daughter &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
not thirsty&quot; is a frightening and good example.  My mom used to tell me <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re not hungry,&quot; lots of times.   I have never even told my kids &quot;You <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be hungry.&quot;  Hungry is hungry, one way or another.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about bedtimes.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about chores.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about TV.<br/>
<br/>
But a parent who insists on arbitrary (IMPORTANT term in this, &quot;arbitrary&quot;) <br/>
rules is lacking a crucial component of the understanding it takes to be a <br/>
really good unschooling parent, and a family in which children are told what <br/>
is good, and what they like, and what is stupid, and what will make or break <br/>
their future families/jobs/homes is NOT in a good unschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
What do I mean by &quot;good&quot;?  Sustainable, emotionally.  Sound, interpersonally. <br/>
 Honest.  Open.<br/>
<br/>
Whether a child is awake or asleep can matter for learning, but sleep is <br/>
important!<br/>
Whether a child goes to sleep happy to be in the bed is FAR more important in <br/>
the overall averaging scheme of things than what time it is that he goes to <br/>
sleep happy.<br/>
<br/>
If happiness is a goal, unschooling can follow.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is a goal and unhappy measures are taken to try to ensure that <br/>
unschooling can thrive, and families are fighting about the unhappy changes, <br/>
that is NOT a path to unschooling.  It&#39;s a sideroad with a huge row of rubbly <br/>
boulders between it and the peaceful unschooling place a family needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
Several people have said &quot;Since I announced &#39;no more bedtime,&#39;...&quot; and then <br/>
told us of various weird reactions.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestions I was making were never &quot;Let them stay awake forever,&quot; but <br/>
&quot;Ask yourself WHY you are saying 8:00 is &#39;bedtime.&#39;  Ask yourself WHY bedtime <br/>
might be so crucial.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so it seems some people have not really thought about it, and have made a <br/>
new arbitrary rule (based on things they kind of understood, maybe, from <br/>
here).   And anytime a person comes back in here and says &quot;Okay, I bought $40 <br/>
worth of junk food and they&#39;re eating it.  Now what?&quot;  they have made a step <br/>
without understanding where they were going with it.<br/>
<br/>
Is it the fault of the information providers?  Did we &quot;fail to teach&quot;?  <br/>
Is it the fault of the learners?  They want a magic quickie curriculum to <br/>
learn to become an unschooling family?   <br/>
<br/>
The principles behind giving people choices are what makes those choices <br/>
work.  <br/>
The options without understanding, the freedoms without the underpinnings of <br/>
purpose and belief, are just more weird rules.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437484125">I think in our case we had a child who was told he had a bed time and <br/>
attended &quot;school&quot; and had all the rules that we now in this day do not feel <br/>
was in his best interest.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is when Sally meets Harry, one changes and the other is slower to <br/>
take on the same belief it will and does cause time for discussion.  We get <br/>
bits and pieces of life from other people. When we make some of those choices <br/>
some follow and others make it a power struggle but miss the positive changes <br/>
that are happening.<br/>
<br/>
If Harry comes home late he gets bits and pieces but not the full movie. All <br/>
families come from different places in their lives. Stress adds to these and <br/>
make the change over slower and often leads to the one step forward two steps <br/>
back spiral.<br/>
<br/>
In our case I dont think what time our son went to bed was so much the issue <br/>
with DH it was more that when our son stayed up later he often left the tv on <br/>
all night.  Money issues again........ My husband has asked repeatedly for <br/>
our son to please turn off his light and tv before he sleeps but it never <br/>
happened. The struggle between father and son is why I finally announced that <br/>
we are Unschooling even though we had been doing this all along.<br/>
<br/>
I came to the conclusion that my DH needed examples of the positive impact of <br/>
Unschooling. That he (and I gave examples) often falls into the have to do&#39;s. <br/>
 <br/>
So I asked why does this need to be done now, because your parents made =you <br/>
do that? It is ok to shake the bad stuff and be happy you know.<br/>
<br/>
So what I am saying is that we are two adults making major changes to our <br/>
lives and beliefs.  We did not meet and instantly Unschool. We are late <br/>
bloomers.<br/>
I feel strongly about Unschooling because I know it has changed us all for <br/>
the better. Our relationship as a couple and a family. We are all closer.<br/>
<br/>
But I also know that there may be things that pop up along the way that we <br/>
need to deal with, to me they are all part of our growth.<br/>

Our routine is almost identical to yours but goes on between 11pm and 2 am.<br/>
I am usually the first up in the morning and use that as my time until the<br/>
kids start getting up around 10 am.  I will usually ask the older kids to go<br/>

 </span></blockquote>happy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pipe in here with what &quot;bedtime&quot; looks like in our home.  <br/>
My kids are 10, 8, and 4, and my husband works nights.  I&#39;ve learned <br/>
from experience that the &quot;let them drop where they are&quot; approach <br/>
doesn&#39;t work for my kids, particularly when they&#39;re little.  But <br/>
then neither do inflexible bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my latest &quot;routine. &quot; When my youngest is getting sleepy I <br/>
start a subtle segue (sp?) into bedtime-related stuff.  A warm bath, <br/>
a snack (usually while in the tub), and picture book selecting.  I <br/>
usually ask my older two to watch a movie or something else quiet at <br/>
this point.  My 4yo and I then brush teeth and get in bed to read a <br/>
stack of books with a soft light.  I pick some of the books, and he <br/>
picks some- and the ones I pick are soothing, sleepy type books and <br/>
I read in a quiet voice.  Then I turn out the light and rub his back <br/>
and talk in a soothing way about the things we did that day and the <br/>
things we&#39;ll do the next day.  This is a cozy time for us, and he <br/>
falls asleep happily and quickly.<br/>
With the older two I then make Nighty Nite tea for us all and we <br/>
read from our latest novel.  I tell them ahead of time when I&#39;ll be <br/>
ready so they can finish or pause what they&#39;re doing.  Usually after <br/>
this reading session my middle son is happy to be tucked into his <br/>
bed, sometimes with his gameboy but usually with the lights out and <br/>
a quick backrub.  He&#39;s always been my early bird.<br/>
My oldest (night owl since birth) then retreats to his room where <br/>
he&#39;s free to do whatever he wants as long as it&#39;s reasonably quiet.  <br/>
Usually he reads Calvin and Hobbes, plays gameboy or if he&#39;s really <br/>
tired listens to an audiobook with the lights out in bed until he <br/>
falls asleep.  If he doesn&#39;t want to sleep by himself he drags his <br/>
blanket and pillow into my room and reads a book alongside me until <br/>
he falls asleep.  <br/>
So I *do* have a bedtime routine that we&#39;re all happy with, and the <br/>
kids don&#39;t mind it because they know it isn&#39;t arbitrary, nor carved <br/>
in stone, and they know that if they&#39;re not ready for sleep they are <br/>
free to do something else quiet until they are.  This all occurs <br/>
between 8 and 10 usually, which gives me some much needed peace and <br/>
quiet since if anyone&#39;s still up after that time it&#39;s my mostly self-<br/>
sufficient oldest.<br/>
<br/>
Works for us. :-)<br/>

For s&g&#39;s I decided to pipe in too :-)<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 4.5 and 22months. When I notice that Avery is getting ready for bed and wants to nurce, this is how he falls asleep, we ask Jaiden if he&#39;ll go play quietly in his room until Avery&#39;s asleep. Sometimes Jaiden askes Jason to come in and play or read to him. Sometimes he just goes to sleep, or reads and plays by himself. Once Avery is asleep, Jaiden can get up if he wants, we all try to be quite so Avery can sleep. If Jaiden gets up we watch movies, or read, or play games...all the stuff thats hard to do with a toddler running around. <br/>

capable of it.  They seem to wake up early no matter what time they <br/>
go to bed!<br/>
They *could* stay awake all night if they wanted to after our little <br/>
routine, but they don&#39;t choose to... I think it&#39;s because the <br/>
stillness, snuggling and reading gets them into a cozy, sleepy mood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s close to how it works around here. Except that I&#39;d say that by<br/>
responding to their cues since they were infants with no enforced bedtimes,<br/>
they have a very good idea of when they are tired. It&#39;s not like my son<br/>
plays around until he drops of exhaustion. Usually at some point, he&#39;ll say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m tired, I want to go to bed now.&quot; He knows his own body&#39;s cues and<br/>
responds to them. Boy that really throws some adults for a loop to hear a<br/>
kid say that too! And he really is tired when he says he is. He&#39;s asleep<br/>
within minutes of hitting the pillow. No fiddling around asking for glasses<br/>
of water and more stories because he can do all that ahead of time until<br/>
he&#39;s tired. There&#39;s nothing to postpone, sleep is welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were infants and young toddlers, they usually fell asleep<br/>
nursing. Sometimes asked for a story first. My daughter still nurses to<br/>
sleep. That makes bedtimes with infants/toddlers pretty much a snap, and<br/>
bedtime is something that they always associate with a pleasant, close time.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly the same here.<br/>
<br/>
They haven&#39;t had to learn to read themselves to sleep because someone said <br/>
&quot;bedtime.&quot;  They haven&#39;t had to learn ANY tricks for inducing sleep when <br/>
they&#39;re not sleepy.  They do real things until they&#39;re sleepy, and then they <br/>
happily get into bed and happily go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, when they were little it wasn&#39;t that way exactly.  <br/>
They nursed to sleep, or were read to sleep, or listened to music with mom in <br/>
a dark room while a younger baby nursed to sleep, or lay next to mom playing <br/>
with something or looking at a book, but they were never stuck in a room <br/>
alone and told to go to sleep.<br/>

&lt;&lt; With the older two I then make Nighty Nite tea for us all and we <br/>
<br/>
read from our latest novel.  I tell them ahead of time when I&#39;ll be <br/>
<br/>
ready so they can finish or pause what they&#39;re doing.  Usually after <br/>
<br/>
this reading session my middle son is happy to be tucked into his <br/>
<br/>
bed &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would be too.  I wouldn&#39;t mind being a kid at the home of some of the moms <br/>
here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532475993">&lt;&lt; I have tried the no set bedtime &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To Sandra&#39;s excellent post on this, I&#39;d just add that whether or not<br/>
dispensing with bedtimes &quot;works&quot; depends a lot on giving the kids enough<br/>
time to really understand what it means to feel sleepy. If for your entire<br/>
life, you are told when to go to bed, then you probably don&#39;t really know<br/>
what it feels like to be playing or working on something and feel sleepy and<br/>
recognize that it&#39;s time to go to bed now before you get *really* tired. I<br/>
think most people go through this learning process in college--staying up<br/>
very late, getting up and feeling too tired to function in class, etc. It<br/>
might take them years by that point to realize what time *they* need to go<br/>
to sleep in order for their bodies to feel good and rested. But even with<br/>
kids, it might take weeks or months of the kids going a bit crazy one way or<br/>
another for them to discover their own personal sleepy point.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s a very different thing for a child who has always been able to<br/>
determine their own bedtime and can therefore read their own body&#39;s sleep<br/>
cues. Whenever people come and post &quot;I&#39;ve tried not having a bedtime&quot;, the<br/>
first thing I wonder is &quot;for how long?&quot; If you haven&#39;t given it the weeks or<br/>
months it might take, and go back to enforced bedtimes again, the kids might<br/>
just have to go through it when they are old enough to move out on their<br/>
own. That can even be dangerous. We&#39;ve all probably seen the studies about<br/>
sleep deprivation and auto accidents, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;ve just won a lifelong battle with insomnia. After 37 years,<br/>
I&#39;ve *finally* gotten to the point where I can lay my body down when it<br/>
feels tired and drop off to sleep. My mom tells the (to her) &quot;humorous&quot;<br/>
story of how I used to scream so loud in my crib that my parents had to<br/>
sleep in the dining room (of a one-bedroom apartment). I know she was<br/>
probably following Dr. Spock and doing what she felt was best for me, but<br/>
there have been many, many sleepless midnights when I wondered if I could&#39;ve<br/>
learned what tired and sleepy felt as a child, maybe I wouldn&#39;t be still<br/>
reading a book trying to get myself to sleep in the middle of the night.<br/>

 Exactly the same here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They haven&#39;t had to learn to read themselves to sleep because <br/>
someone said <br/>
&gt; &quot;bedtime.&quot;  They haven&#39;t had to learn ANY tricks for inducing sleep <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re not sleepy.  They do real things until they&#39;re sleepy, and <br/>
then they <br/>
&gt; happily get into bed and happily go to sleep.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But on the other hand, when they were little it wasn&#39;t that way <br/>
exactly.  <br/>
&gt; They nursed to sleep, or were read to sleep, or listened to music <br/>
with mom in <br/>
&gt; a dark room while a younger baby nursed to sleep, or lay next to <br/>
mom playing <br/>
&gt; with something or looking at a book, but they were never stuck in a <br/>
room <br/>
&gt; alone and told to go to sleep.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we do here, also. My youngest(almost 2) is learning how <br/>
to fall asleep without nursing. We have been cosleeping since my <br/>
second (almost 4) daughter was born. I regret forcing my oldest 10yo <br/>
daughter to sleep in her crib alone crying. So now most of the time <br/>
she sleeps in my room too. At this age, she still doesn&#39;t want to be <br/>
alone in her room. And it is okay, since everyone else(except dh God <br/>
love him) sleeps in my room. One of these days I will have my bed and <br/>
my body back to myself, and maybe I&#39;ll let dh come back LOL<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally there are times when they start letting me know they <br/>
want to go to bed before I am ready, but most nights we just all <br/>
migrate to the dark quiet bedroom together, and one by one we nod <br/>
off. Last night the one who is learning not to nurse to sleep took a <br/>
long time, kicking and thrashing, and getting up and moving around, <br/>
and playing and talking to me, while I was in a half coma. Rough <br/>
night LOL<br/>

&gt; responds to them. Boy that really throws some adults for a loop to hear a<br/>
&gt; kid say that too! And he really is tired when he says he is. He&#39;s asleep<br/>
&gt; within minutes of hitting the pillow. No fiddling around asking for glasses<br/>
&gt; of water and more stories because he can do all that ahead of time until<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s tired. There&#39;s nothing to postpone, sleep is welcomed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the kids were infants and young toddlers, they usually fell asleep<br/>
&gt; nursing. Sometimes asked for a story first. My daughter still nurses to<br/>
&gt; sleep. That makes bedtimes with infants/toddlers pretty much a snap, and<br/>
&gt; bedtime is something that they always associate with a pleasant, close time<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is how it is for us too.  But if my oldest (8yo) isn&#39;t quite ready for <br/>
bed when we are and doesn&#39;t want to be up alone in the house, he has a light <br/>
and cozy chair at the foot of the bed and he will sit and read or draw until <br/>
he is ready.  Then turns off the light and comes to bed.<br/>

<br/>
Same with food choices,<br/>
same with television,<br/>
same with even just doing interesting things on their own if they&#39;ve been in <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while for them to get past the &quot;Oooh!  I can eat cake!  I can <br/>
watch cartoons!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really, really happy that our kids had the latitude to eat when they were <br/>
hungry and sleep with they were tired from before they could remember, <br/>
because it makes their other decision making all easier too.<br/>
<br/>
Just as their learning to read on their own makes it a cinch for them to <br/>
calmly KNOW they can learn fancy math when they need to, or how to lay out a <br/>
business letter, or whatever it might be, having had decision making power <br/>
over when to sleep and when to eat makes it easier for them to be confident <br/>
in their judgment on other things, like who to be romantic with, who to trust <br/>
to drive them around, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Because they&#39;re not desperate, their decision making is not reactionary.<br/>
