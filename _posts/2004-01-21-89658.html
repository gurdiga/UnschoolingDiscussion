Credit, I don&#39;t know why.  But a few of us that were labeled gifted could <br/>
choose what we wanted to do for the year for that one period.  Although much of <br/>
the work was done after school etc.  We could choose from anything and then <br/>
submit a form with an explanation of the topic and direction we were taking it.  <br/>
They would search out a mentor for us that was not a faculty member.  That <br/>
mentor would grade us however they chose.  It was so much fun.  I chose to <br/>
transcribe a favorite choral number to be performed by a band that I chose.  And <br/>
worked with a choral director from the community that I so respected.  It was, by <br/>

It was so nice to be able to submerge yourself into something that you loved, <br/>
even though it was only one class.<br/>
