I asked my son (the rabid, uh I mean avid sports fan) about this.  He said <br/>
there is an age requirement to play football in the NFL.  Just last year someone <br/>
sued to be eligible for the draft on the basis of age discrimination.  He <br/>
lost his lawsuit.  He says there is no actual requirement that you EVER play <br/>
college football, BUT... if you get out of high school a superstar, you&#39;re not <br/>
going to sit around waiting for the magical age in two or three years in order to <br/>
enter the NFL draft.<br/>
<br/>
He says he thinks it&#39;s a good thing,  bodies need to mature, they&#39;d be killed <br/>
in their first game, as in broken necks and backs... of course, he&#39;s a <br/>
baseball player, who could draft right out of high school.<br/>
<br/>
But truthfully I can see there is more potential for injury in football than <br/>
in basketball or baseball or some of the other sports.  But even if you are 22 <br/>
or 32 football is still the same game right?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband backs up what Glena&#39;s son said. There isn&#39;t a college requirement<br/>
but there are restrictions for NFL (can&#39;t be less than 3 years out of high<br/>
school -- not sure what they&#39;d do about homeschoolers!).<br/>
<br/>
He said Eric Swann of the Arizona Cardinals played semi-pro football instead<br/>
of college.<br/>
<br/>
Just as an aside, he said the NFL will say the age restriction is about<br/>
protecting young bodies that aren&#39;t ready for the rigors of pro football,<br/>
but that in reality the NFL wants to protect the college system that<br/>
develops their players for them. The NFL doesn&#39;t have a minor league system<br/>
like hockey and baseball so college is essentially their minor league.<br/>

Actually I think it&#39;s now about a specific age, I believe he told me you have <br/>
to be 21, because that is what the kid sued based on last year.  Age <br/>
discrimination, they wouldn&#39;t allow him to be drafted because he wasn&#39;t old enough.  <br/>
This was a kid that was suspended from college play because of a criminal <br/>
charge of falsifying a police report to indicate more items were stolen from his <br/>
vehicle than he actually had, or something to that effect.  My son, the fount of <br/>
knowledge on this subject, and who gave it ALL to me yesterday, is still <br/>
sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
So if he couldn&#39;t stay in school and play football, well he COULD stay in <br/>
school, just not play football, he wanted to be drafted, teams were interested, <br/>
his coach was interested in getting him drafted.  But it didn&#39;t happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556178274">I guess I was just trying to lightheartedly note that here was a profession<br/>
virtually requiring college, but not requiring any degree at the end of it.<br/>
College as a means to an end. I suppose a homeschooler interested in being a<br/>
pro-footballer would be desirous of attending a college with a good football<br/>
team.<br/>
