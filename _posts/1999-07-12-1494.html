My thought is that 7 is too young to really learn about the Holocaust.  I <br/>
think it would just be scary without being informative. As important an area <br/>
as it is for everyone to know about, 7 is too young.<br/>
<br/>
Except maybe as part of a discussion of freedoms we enjoy that people have <br/>
fought for, or something equally tame and positive.   <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my 2 cents.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Recently, my 11yo asked me about ethnic cleansing(with regards to Kosovo). <br/>
This led us into discussing lots of things:including our values, right and <br/>
wrong, differences. How lack of respect for differences can escalate, <br/>
conflict resolution etc. She asked about other times in history when people <br/>
did this to other people. This has been an ongoing discussion, initiated by  <br/>
my dd.<br/>
  My 7 yo left the room. She&#39;s not ready to talk about this stuff. But she <br/>
lives our values as part of our family.<br/>
