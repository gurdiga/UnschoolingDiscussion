<div id="ygrps-yiv-247305357">I just picked up Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong.  Loewen suggests that schools err by trying to teach students as many facts as possible about history, rather than studying fewer topics in depth.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teachers do not have to know everything to facilitate independent student learning.  They can act as informed reference librarians, directing children to books, maps, and people who can answer their questions about history.&quot;  <br/>
