Welcome Nicole,<br/>
I&#39;m Amy, unschooling, AP mom to girls ages 7, 4, and 2. We live in MA with<br/>
my dh Keith, our dog and 2 cats. One terrific parenting book is Everyday<br/>
Blessings: The Inner Work Of Mindful Parenting by Myla and Jon Kabat-Zinn.<br/>
It talks about really being there for your kids and parenting &quot;in the<br/>
moment&quot;. I also recomend anything by Dr. Sears and anything on attachment<br/>
parenting.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just subscribed about a week ago, and have been lurking... thought it<br/>
&gt; was about time I introduced myself. My name is Nicole, I&#39;m 29 and<br/>
&gt; pregnant with my first, due in about 3 weeks! My boyfriend (or<br/>
&gt; &quot;baby-daddy&quot; in talk-show lingo) Terry and I live in rural Kentucky.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While Terry is more traditional about things, I tend to research and<br/>
&gt; look for the best alternative... which is usually NOT the way &quot;most<br/>
&gt; people&quot; do things. At least not the people we know. For instance, I find<br/>
&gt; a vegetarian lifestyle the best way to live, for my own health and<br/>
&gt; karma. Terry likes to grill burgers and hotdogs. I have decided on<br/>
&gt; homebirth with a trained midwife as the best way to go - and although<br/>
&gt; Terry still thinks it&#39;d be &quot;safer&quot; to have the baby in the hospital, he<br/>
&gt; is going along with me on this one. Homeschooling/unschooling sounds<br/>
&gt; like a terrific idea to me, although I was not quite as poisoned by<br/>
&gt; public school as most folks have been... I went to &quot;alternative&quot; schools<br/>
&gt; in Kansas grades K-6, where kids are given more autonomy and<br/>
&gt; resposibility and learn stuff outside the 3 R&#39;s (i.e. we had a garden<br/>
&gt; and a class in geology, made papier mache volcanoes, etc.).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize now that the stuff I learned because I took it upon myself -<br/>
&gt; outside of school - is the stuff I still know and use today. Stuff that<br/>
&gt; was drilled into my head in high school and college, I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; anymore and could give a rat&#39;s butt. ~:^ )  I did have some meaningful<br/>
&gt; social interaction in school, and a few really terrific teachers, but<br/>
&gt; was not involved in much extracurricular activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Terry had a traditional ps education, and says his parents never had any<br/>
&gt; interest in his schooling at all - didn&#39;t care whether he did his<br/>
&gt; homework, etc. He has a phobic aversion to reading, whereas I am a<br/>
&gt; compulsive reader! Anyway, we&#39;ve been lightly discussing the<br/>
&gt; homeschooling topic, and he seems to be open to it, though not to the<br/>
&gt; extent that I&#39;d like. One thing that helps is the dubious quality of the<br/>
&gt; public schools around here, and the fact that they&#39;ll hire anyone off<br/>
&gt; the street to be a teacher because they&#39;re desperate. Another thing is<br/>
&gt; that he thinks I&#39;d be an excellent teacher (he thinks I ought to get one<br/>
&gt; of those jobs - no thanks!), and so well suited to educating our<br/>
&gt; daughter. I touched on the philosophy of unschooling (vs.<br/>
&gt; homeschooling), but he&#39;s one that takes his knowledge a little bite at a<br/>
&gt; time, so we&#39;ll see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to hear more on the discipline topic, please. The Aletha Solter<br/>
&gt; excerpts make sense, but how do her ideas work in the real world?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How about a recommended reading list? Not just for educating but for<br/>
&gt; parenting in general. I need something to take to the small-town<br/>
&gt; library, see if I can challenge them a bit to find what I want to read.<br/>
&gt; ~:^ )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks y&#39;all!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nicole, you&#39;re so cute!  If somebody had told me when I was pregnant (8+ <br/>
years ago) with my first that 5 years later I&#39;d be homeschooling (let alone <br/>
unschooling), I&#39;ve have drawn up the committment papers.  In fact, I hadn&#39;t <br/>
even heard of homeschooling until about a year before that.  I still remember <br/>
my first words to that homeschooling mom, &quot;Is that LEGAL?&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487136447">Hi and welcome Nicole;<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and very best wishes to you and &quot;baby daddy&quot; and baby! <br/>
I&#39;m up TOO early with my soon- to-be 2 year old (on Sept.<br/>
25th...September is a nice month for a baby...not too hot, not too<br/>
cold!) and in my sleep deprived state wanted to tell you about a good,<br/>
basic, all-purpose parenting book you may be interested in:  &quot;Creative<br/>
Parenting&quot; by Dr. William Sears.  It&#39;s a good starter.  So is &quot;The<br/>
Womanly Art of Breast-Feeding&quot; as a lot of issues are covered in that<br/>
book in addition to breast-feeding.  Keep us posted on the birth etc.<br/>
and good luck with all your research!<br/>
