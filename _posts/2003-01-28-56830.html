***Doctors carves letters into womens uterus.***<br/>
<br/>
When my dad was going in for cancer treatment his radiologist got in<br/>
trouble and was eventually fired because he tattooed (that temporary<br/>
tattooing for radiation treatment) a smiley face on a woman&#39;s breast.<br/>
He had been in trouble at the cancer center before for harassing nurses. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it happens more often than we&#39;d like to think. <br/>
<br/>
On that same page, (of the link to the Dr. story ) on the left, under<br/>
weird news there&#39;s a story about boys who killed their mother.<br/>
Here&#39;s a snip<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
--Bautista&#39;s neighbors at the Mission Grove Gardens apartment complex,<br/>
where the family rented a two-bedroom unit for about $1,000 a month, said<br/>
the mother was heard late at night screaming at her younger boy to do his<br/>
chores. <br/>
Neighbors had noticed the home had recently become quieter. <br/>
&quot;It was weird that the screaming just stopped,&quot; Derek Fernandez, 26, told<br/>
The Times. ---<br/>

utmost respect to their patients.  Its just a personal thing for ME.  I <br/>
wouldnt care .. Its an organ .. an organ that is useless to me or anyone else <br/>
at that point ( the point of hysterectomy, I mean).   My understanding was <br/>
the the Dr&#39;s mark the organs for identification at the lab. Whether its <br/>
initials or some other mark wouldnt matter to me.  Most like, when it gets to <br/>
lab, its gonna be chopped up anyway.   But, like I said.. thats just me.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615558281">There is something very wrong with a doctor taking time out of performing a<br/>
necessary surgery to have a bit of fun, especially when acting upon a part<br/>
of the body not yet removed.  Anethesia is dangerous, and to prolong the<br/>
surgery by even a few minutes is wrong.  I don&#39;t know the medical<br/>
consequences if he had slipped in the preformance of this little act...but<br/>
it certainly isn&#39;t respectful of the woman, nor does it show much common<br/>
sense.  <br/>
<br/>
If afterward he had marked it, even then it shows disrespect, but this was<br/>
while the uterus was inside her.... The fact that no one was hurt physically<br/>
doesn&#39;t alter the fact that it prolonged the surgery, even by a few minutes,<br/>
unnecessarily. <br/>
<br/>
Loss of companionship? That is a little weird.... <br/>

Many Dr.&#39;s are under a great amount of pressure and it can weigh heavily on <br/>
them emotionally as well. What some Dr.&#39;s do to not get caught up in the day <br/>

difference is that most patients don&#39;t know about it. If they or you did, <br/>
you would be mortified at times. He should have kept his little joke to <br/>
himself, that was his mistake.<br/>

article<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The lawsuit says the tape clearly shows the doctor use a <br/>
cauterizing <br/>
&gt; instrument to carve the letters into her uterus before removing it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw this on the news too..   Heres my take..  They took it out!.. <br/>
ITS <br/>
&gt; GONE.. out of her body.. KAPUT, NO MORE.. Why does she care if he <br/>
marked <br/>
&gt; it????  She didnt feel it.. its not &quot;still a part of her&quot;   I <br/>
woulnt give a <br/>
&gt; rats ass if he carved a smiley face on any part of my body that was <br/>
being <br/>

Usually just sutures like someone else mentioned.  Usually just one at the <br/>

  ***Doctors carves letters into womens uterus.***<br/>
<br/>
  When my dad was going in for cancer treatment his radiologist got in<br/>
  trouble and was eventually fired because he tattooed (that temporary<br/>
  tattooing for radiation treatment) a smiley face on a woman&#39;s breast.<br/>
  He had been in trouble at the cancer center before for harassing nurses. <br/>
<br/>
  Maybe it happens more often than we&#39;d like to think. <br/>
<br/>
  On that same page, (of the link to the Dr. story ) on the left, under<br/>
  weird news there&#39;s a story about boys who killed their mother.<br/>
  Here&#39;s a snip<br/>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
  --Bautista&#39;s neighbors at the Mission Grove Gardens apartment complex,<br/>
  where the family rented a two-bedroom unit for about $1,000 a month, said<br/>
  the mother was heard late at night screaming at her younger boy to do his<br/>
  chores. <br/>
  Neighbors had noticed the home had recently become quieter. <br/>
  &quot;It was weird that the screaming just stopped,&quot; Derek Fernandez, 26, told<br/>
  The Times. ---<br/>
