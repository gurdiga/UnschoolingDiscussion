<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370898236">Well, like someone else said (was it the other Nancy?) things will probably <br/>
be slow on here this weekend, so I&#39;ll throw out what&#39;s going on at our house.<br/>
<br/>
Public (government) school starts this coming Tuesday.  Our plans, so far, <br/>
have been to keep EVERYONE out...our biological kids, our adopted son, our <br/>
foster kids.  It would be the first time homeschooling for the last 3.  <br/>
<br/>
At the last minute, our foster boy&#39;s caseworker said, &quot;No, they can&#39;t be <br/>
homeschooled until the adoption is final.&quot;  The reasoning, I suspect, is that <br/>
because they are foster kids, if they are abused and not in school, no one would <br/>
know.  Other reasoning I guess is liability,...if they don&#39;t learn anything, or <br/>
fall behind, the state could be held liable for not ensuring their continuing <br/>
education.  <br/>
<br/>
So now we will be a house divided, which I HATE....means I&#39;ll be getting up <br/>
at 6:00 am to get the boys on the bus, then wasting my evenings doing mindless <br/>
homework.  I really, really dread this.   <br/>
<br/>
The only other thing I have been up against, is that my 12 yo daughter, who <br/>
was in public school last year, really wants to go back.  She forgets the tears <br/>
and crying at having to get up so early, the agony of doing all that <br/>
homework, never being able to go anywhere (we have friends who sell their wares at <br/>
fairs and art shows and she had to decline going to many states and Canada <br/>
because of this.)  My husband, believe it or not, has put his foot down and forbid <br/>
anyone from going back, because the attitudes and stress were unbearable to the <br/>
family, and whether they realize it or not, to the kids too.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys will be coming out of school soon enough, once their adoption is <br/>
final, probably a couple of months.  But if anyone would like to offer <br/>
suggestions of easing my daughter back into homeschooling (which will be really <br/>
different because she has only been schooled at home, not unschooled) PLEASE send them <br/>
quickly my way.  She was somewhat accepting and looking forward to a lot of <br/>
things until 2 of her public school friends came back from vacation and started <br/>
touting all the wonderful things going on this year and how much she will <br/>
miss out on.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom is coming to West Virginia for a month, and I am thinking of asking <br/>
her to take Kelsey back to Texas with her for a couple of weeks as a treat and <br/>
an eyeopener (she definately couldn&#39;t do that if she were in school)  Any other <br/>
ideas?<br/>

Nancy B.:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had several in our area dealing with this same issue this <br/>
year.  Others have offered some good suggestions.  Like finding out <br/>
what it is she feels she will be missing.  In some cases it was stuff <br/>
like shopping for back-to-school clothes, or buying school supplies, <br/>
or getting to see friends.  So the parents and child figured out ways <br/>
to fulfill those things without having to go back to school.<br/>
<br/>
One parent had her child do a list of things they were upset about <br/>
missing at school, and things they would miss at home if they went <br/>
back to school, and they had a discussion, comparing everything, plus <br/>
coming up with some concrete ways to deal with the missed things, <br/>
like more ways to socialize with friends.  Guess what?  Sleeping in <br/>
won, hands down, and the child elected to stay home.  <br/>
<br/>
If they miss back-to-school shopping you can have them make up their <br/>
own list of back-to-school things they might like to go shopping <br/>
for:  craft items, fabric to sew some clothes, books they have been <br/>
wanting to read, notebooks and pens and pencils and folders (all the <br/>
stuff they have on sale this time of year), a backpack.  And maybe <br/>
she can plan some kind of special event to commemorate Not-Going-Back-<br/>
To-School.  A picnic or special field trip, perhaps?  We do an annual <br/>
trip to a corn maize for one of our favorite Not-Going-Back-To-School <br/>
events, for example.  Some do a camping trip to a nearby park area.  <br/>
She could then make it on a weekend and invite her friends, both <br/>
schooled and unschooled.  We are doing that next weekend, with a <br/>
group campsite and reservations for the high and low ropes course, <br/>
too.  The teens are really looking forward to this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure others have lots of ideas, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Several good suggestions from Norma.  Another thing is to point out that<br/>
many kids have always looked forward to the start of school.  I always did.<br/>
It was a time of new beginnings, yet another chance to do well.  Maybe I&#39;d<br/>
get a good teacher (or teachrs) that year, and it would be more fun.<br/>
September has always felt more like new years than January for me.  But the<br/>
reality sets in after a few weeks.  Those same kids who are looking forward<br/>
to the start of school today are just as likely to be dreading Mondays soon.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I told my son when he mentioned that this or that friend enjoyed<br/>
school was that the friend doesn&#39;t have a choice about whether to go to<br/>
school.  He only has a choice as to whether or not to enjoy it.  In that<br/>
case, he&#39;s smart to try to enjoy it.  That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he&#39;d<br/>
like it if he had a choice about going.<br/>

We went to the local fair this week.  Walking thru the expo building, adults <br/>
felt compelled to talk *school* with my kids while giving them a free balloon. <br/>
 When asked about going to school, Hannah said, we don&#39;t go to school.  Oh, <br/>
the man says, you homeschool?  No, she replies, actually we unschool.  At his <br/>
confused look, she clarified, we don&#39;t *do* school.  Another time, when asked <br/>
what grade she is in, she replied, If I went to school, I suppose I&#39;d be a 2nd <br/>
grader.  As if this were not entertaining enough, at the *No Drugs* booth, my <br/>
kids were quick to comment on the fact the woman was drinking coke and giving <br/>

I&#39;m a lurker too, but your daughter sounds like mine.  She went thru a period of wanting to go to school, and when I asked her why it was the lunchbox, backpack, lunch and recess!  Now she&#39;s older she understands that she has a lot more &quot;recess&quot; than schooled kids and we just buy a new backpack and take advantage of the sales for the supplies.  She hasn&#39;t asked in a long time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Things are a little better today.  We went to Walmart and I got her ears <br/>
pierced for her (which she&#39;s been wanting for a long time) and she picked out some <br/>
cool gel pens, some notebooks, stationary, etc.  We agreed together we&#39;re <br/>
gonna come back in a few days when school has started and all the prices are <br/>
slashed.  I promised her I&#39;d do whatever it takes for her to get to see her old <br/>
friends from school.  She&#39;s having a birthday party in a couple of weeks.  Also, <br/>
for years we&#39;ve been wanting to have a big Halloween party, so now we may do <br/>
that this year, especially since Halloween is on a Friday Night.  She loves <br/>
planning stuff like that, sending invitations, decorating, etc.  We might even <br/>
put together a haunted house!  <br/>
<br/>
Today in the car, I was talking about my ongoing problems with rashes on my <br/>
hand, and how I will probably quit gardening next year to prevent it, but <br/>
instead put my time into the sheep and goats, milking them and making butter, <br/>
cheese, etc.  She perked up and said, &quot;mommy, I know how to milk, I can help!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So, I think we&#39;ll be OK.  I think the first day of &quot;school&quot; we&#39;ll go to the <br/>
mall and exchange a couple of things, get some cool craft stuff, whatever she <br/>
wants (hey, since we&#39;re unschooling this year, I don&#39;t have to come up with <br/>
hundreds of dollars for curriculum!) and we&#39;ll eat out.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41554704">&lt;&lt;&lt;Ah! A week away from peace and quiet! (in town, not at home!)<br/>
<br/>
diana,&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  I so agree with you!!  Yippy!  I think of the commercial of the Dad in the office supply store dancing with the shopping cart looking completely ecstatic.  He was shopping for school supplies for his moppy looking kids.  <br/>
<br/>
That was me when I entered the Staples store and asked the clerk why they were so busy(it was 2:00 on a Tuesday)  She looked at me, and then at my four kids, and said (in a are you retarded? tone) &quot;School starts next week&quot; you could hear the &quot;Duh&quot; ringing in the air.  I smiled and said &quot;Oh Ya! Alex your friends will be back at school soon.&quot;  Big smile on my face :-D The poor clerk looked so confused.  Alex told her &quot;We&#39;re going to the cabin at the lake for September&quot;  Thinking it would help her understand. He added &quot;Well we waited to have our holidays for when my friends were stuck in school so they wouldn&#39;t miss me so much.&quot;  She still didn&#39;t get it.  &quot;We homeschool so we&#39;re free to holiday when we want.&quot;  She replied with a mystified &quot;Oh. Yaw. Ok sure&quot;  and we walked off.  Tee Hee.  I get my kids to ourselves for the days, it&#39;s so grand.<br/>
<br/>
So our days will be quieter here in town and the Lake will be empty of noisy freaky kids who act insane now that they are free for two months.  Last year when we went there we had a few run ins with a gang of 7-9 yearolds that were reeking havoc in a big way.  Very scary.  It was like they had no idea how to think for themselves and so followed whatever nutty idea came to mind.<br/>
