<div id="ygrps-yiv-238794109">Can everyone please say prayers, good thoughts, etc. for the children of my <br/>
neighborhood?  An 11 year old girl was nearly abducted at gunpoint today <br/>
here.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mary-NY<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I really do not feel that it is &quot;punishment&quot; to tell your son or <br/>
&gt;daughter<br/>
&gt;that they need to pick something up, or sweep the floor before they watch <br/>
&gt;tv<br/>
&gt;or play with their legos. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is if you say &quot;You didn&#39;t get your socks in the laundry, so you can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;watch your favorite show tomorrow.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;Hey, I am right in there with them doing it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s the difference.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;I think it has to do with respect for one another.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Me too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unfortunately that doesn&#39;t mean the same to everyone who uses it.  There <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;people who say &quot;I respect my children so much I will force them to go to<br/>
&gt;school, play soccer and learn piano whether they want to or not.&quot; Or &quot;I<br/>
&gt;respect my children so I spank them if they&#39;re bad.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Behaviors are easier to discuss than thought and intent are.<br/>
