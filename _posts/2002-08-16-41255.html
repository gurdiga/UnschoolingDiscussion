<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007072789">Question on how you unschool your teens in preparation for college.  I<br/>
know, I know, college is overrated and unnecessary in some people&#39;s<br/>
opinion (mine included) but I have a 14 yr old son who is thinking at<br/>
this moment that he wants to go.  I don&#39;t want him four years down the<br/>
road unprepared because of my inability to help him plan.<br/>
<br/>
What can I be doing now, in a relaxed fashion, to help him?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe by helping him see college not as an entry to a career but as one of<br/>
many tools to help him explore his interests.<br/>
<br/>
He might enjoy taking community college classes now or in a few years. That<br/>
will give him a taste of college -- and help put college into perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Read some stories of unschoolers who didn&#39;t conventionally prepare for<br/>
college. (Anyone have some links?)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps rather than helping him plan a route, help him find out what<br/>
rerequisites are required for using that particular tool. Then he can keep<br/>
that in mind as he goes along.<br/>
<br/>
And of course help him researching his options too. If he decides he wants<br/>
to learn Algebra, you can ask here or at the message boards at<br/>

learn algebra both formally and informally.<br/>
