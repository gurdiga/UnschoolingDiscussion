<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797385636">Well Wow! What a group!  My email bin is way too full!<br/>
After less than a week I need to say...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m too old to worry about the WEANING thing. Nursed all three of <br/>
mine but not as long as I would have liked.  (My baby just turned 7 <br/>
yesterday... sniff).<br/>
<br/>
She is easily FRUSTRATED and don&#39;t you dare offer to help because it <br/>
makes it worse!!  (That is a whole separate post.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 39<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember many cute words from my little ones right now but I <br/>
remember the same &quot;fruck&quot; issue.   My 10 year old just gave me the <br/>
giggles with the name Penelope (rhymes with Cantaloupe right?)<br/>
<br/>
We have a habit of a few nicknames  It started with the oldest<br/>
being &quot;Care Bear&quot; He is 14 and I will occasionally still call him <br/>
that. (Guess I had better ask if he minds.)<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 kids so I don&#39;t get many comments.  They are boy, boy, girl <br/>
so we did get &quot;Trying for a girl this time&quot; or &quot;Finally got that <br/>
girl&quot;.  I reply truthfully &quot;nope, we wanted 3 from the beginning and <br/>
that is what we are glad to have period.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And finally what really jerked me out of lurking...<br/>
<br/>
Noah...<br/>
This is the story that started my quest for a different God (at the <br/>
tender age of 6).  I wanted no part of a God that would drown all of <br/>
those animals. (Notice I did not have too much sympathy for the <br/>
people at the time). <br/>
I too have a very questioning nature and a God who lets (or causes) <br/>
bad things to happen because &quot;his ways are know only to him&quot; etc etc <br/>
ranks right up there with the parental &quot;because I said so&quot; to put it <br/>
mildy.  OR on a lighter side as Cosby quoted &quot;I brought you into this <br/>
world and I can take you out.&quot;<br/>
I have watched many make the same species, numbers, size comments <br/>
that always bothered me and I will add.  The whole world covered with <br/>
water?  Was it salt or fresh??  Not all creatures would be happy<br/>
if it was one or the other. <br/>
I don&#39;t expect or need any explanation. I caution all to be careful <br/>
how they share this story (and similar hell-fire and brimstone <br/>
stories) with children. <br/>
<br/>
So now I will sign off and say that I have many questions and <br/>
concerns for other posts in the near future.  I look forward to the <br/>
words of wisdom, jokes and even the debates to come.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely<br/>
