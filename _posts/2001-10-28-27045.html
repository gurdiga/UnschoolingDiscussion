<div id="ygrps-yiv-770189907">I thought I&#39;d clear up my statement. When I said worst in OUR history, I<br/>
meant on American soil. Obviousley the hideous act of dropping the bombs on<br/>
Japan killed and injured many more.<br/>
<br/>
I am patriotic and I have enjoyed the resurgence of patriotism. The US is<br/>
not perfect, just as no person is perfect. Politics get messy and we must<br/>
blend many different beliefs and priorities into a system for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I have a muslim friend from Pakistan and he tells me that the people there<br/>
believe we are like our TV. And even if we do not behave like out TV, we<br/>
watch it. To them it is no better than porn. To tell them that not all<br/>
americans watch TV, means nothing, the majority do. The problems we have<br/>
with the Al-Queda aren&#39;t going away thru kindness, in their hearts they<br/>
don&#39;t want our tainted money, they take it so their children can eat.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well...I am unsure of my point. I think I am rambling. This beautiful<br/>
bunch of people here are not the group I want to debate. :) hehehe... I am<br/>
sure I&#39;d lose for lack of eloquent words. :)<br/>
