<div id="ygrps-yiv-305650088">10. Be sensitive to your child&#39;s interest level. Don&#39;t push  <br/>
activities that your child isn&#39;t interested in pursuing. Don&#39;t let  <br/>
YOUR interests dictate your child&#39;s opportunities. If your child  <br/>
wants a pet, be realistic and don&#39;t demand promises that the child  <br/>
will take sole care for it. Plant to care for it yourself when the  <br/>
interest wanes. Do it cheerfully. Model the joy of caring for  <br/>
animals. Model kindness and helpfulness. Help a child by organizing  <br/>
their toys so they are easy to care for. Plan to care for them  <br/>
yourself much of the time, but invite your child&#39;s help in ways that  <br/>
are appealing. If YOU act like you hate organizing and cleaning, why  <br/>
would your child want to do it? Always openly enjoy the results of  <br/>
caring for your possessions�take note of the extra space to play in,  <br/>
the ease of finding things you want, how nice it is to reach into a  <br/>
cupboard and find clean dishes. Enjoy housework together and don&#39;t  <br/>
make it a battle.<br/>
