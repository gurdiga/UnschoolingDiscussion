<div id="ygrps-yiv-201379115">I&#39;ve been following the discussion about letting go of the demands <br/>
we make on our children with great interest, and have been making a <br/>
point to ask for help more often as opposed to giving directions.  <br/>
Also been working on patience levels and discussing my efforts with <br/>
my daughter a bit so she understands why I&#39;m changing course <br/>
rapidly.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday she said two things to show me it&#39;s working, and that <br/>
she&#39;s hearing and wants to help the process.  I wanted to share. <br/>
<br/>
We need to pull up our kitchen floor, and as I was folding laundry <br/>
she wanted me to play with her.  I told her as soon as I finished <br/>
working I would, and that if she wanted she could help me pull up <br/>
the floor.  &quot;Only if I want to?&quot; she asked.  I said yes, that if she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to she could play instead, and she said, &quot;Oh, good.  I <br/>
only wanted to help if I didn&#39;t have to unless I wanted to.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Later she came into the room where I was working and said, &quot;I have <br/>
three special stickers Mommy.  I&#39;m going to tell you about them.  On <br/>
this hand is a heart, because you should always love your children.  <br/>
On this hand is a flower, because you should always smell flowers <br/>
before you pick them. (Nobody&#39;s ever said this to her as far as I <br/>
know.)  And on my forehead is a smiley face, because you should <br/>
always smile at your children, even when you&#39;re angry.&quot;  Afully good <br/>
parenting advice, I thought!<br/>
