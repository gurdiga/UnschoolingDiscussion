OOmmmmmm . . . . (picture me in lotus position :) ).<br/>
<br/>
Sanity?  No. Not around here.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are hsing, I think that&#39;s a long way from the sane, normal way to <br/>
go. So  . .. <br/>
<br/>
Mess is good.  Cleaning up is good.  Putting things UP and asking mom to get <br/>
them down when needed at least alerts me to a pending project.  Paint and <br/>
other art supplies are UP in a cabinet, but there is a box of less messy <br/>
art/craft stuff in a few rooms.  Boxes are good.  Even if stuff is dumped in <br/>
the box, it&#39;s up off the middle of the living room floor.  Outside is good!!  <br/>
We don&#39;t have pretty outdoor furniture, but when a neighbor is getting rid of <br/>
some old table, that can be a project table until the weather destroys it.  <br/>
It&#39;s not Martha Stewart but I don&#39;t worry about the furniture that way.  And <br/>
we have tile floors -- that&#39;s what hubby does -- so that helps.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
