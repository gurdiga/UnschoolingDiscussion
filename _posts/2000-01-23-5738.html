<div id="ygrps-yiv-998176992">&lt;&lt;What do you do to turn<br/>
down the outside volume so that you can hear your own inner<br/>
voice? I appreciate anyone&#39;s input on not allowing other<br/>
people&#39;s expectations dictate their lives, educational choices<br/>
or philosophies.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I meditate every day (well, almost every day).  I have meditated (just a<br/>
simple sit down by myself with closed eyes breathing and repeating<br/>
a simple phrase when my dd and dh are asleep) ever since the summer I read<br/>
The Art of Education by Linda Dobson and Shelter for the Spririt by<br/>
Victoria Moran.  They both recommend daily meditating so that outside<br/>
energies dissipate and you can hear your own thoughts.  It really helps<br/>
me.  I&#39;m not a religious person, so this meditating is a way of praying, a<br/>
way of ending the day, a way of returning to myself.  And I&#39;m less fiesty<br/>
and less likely to end up in an argument I can&#39;t win.  <br/>
