<div id="ygrps-yiv-364832737">I&#39;m struggling to help my 7 year old look after our things, and especially finding it hard to handle it when he breaks things.<br/>
<br/>
He isn&#39;t particularly careful and plays with toys with gusto.  New toys often get broken within a week.<br/>
<br/>
In particular I&#39;m feeling upset about electronic breakages.  We got my 7 year old and 4 year old an Innotab for christmas.  It broke after 6 months.  We talked with our son about treating our belongings carefully (again).<br/>
<br/>
We replaced it with a Google Nexus as we got a good deal on the preorder.  They both loved it, played lots of games, watched Netflix, youtube etc.  Then the screen got smashed when he was watching it in bed.  They&#39;d had it for a couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so frustrated about it.  We are not well off and don&#39;t have the money for another replacement.  Fixing the screen will cost almost as much as buying a new one.  Our insurance covers it but there&#39;s a £100 excess.  I&#39;m sad for my 4 year old, that another thing that was hers too has been broken.  I&#39;m sad for my 7 year old, and really cross at the same time.  I have an unproductive stream of consciousness about it (he&#39;s ungrateful, he doesn&#39;t deserve anything nice if he breaks things so frequently) and I need some help to change this.  It&#39;s really affecting how I&#39;m being with him at the moment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t a matter of not understanding. It&#39;s how his brain is wired. He isn&#39;t *yet* able to be aware of what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s so focused on the game or something else that&#39;s going on that he&#39;s oblivious to his environment.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible he&#39;ll always be somewhat oblivious but he will get better as he gets older and his brain develops more. You can&#39;t rush this any more than you can rush walking. You can, though, in the meantime, make him feel a failure at being the child you wish he was.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to fix him, fix the environment. Be more present. *You* be the keeper of the things you don&#39;t want broken. Let him know you now realize that he can&#39;t *yet* be aware enough not to be rough with it. And you&#39;d like to help it last.<br/>
<br/>
Buy sturdier toys. Get more big muscle movement in during the day. Shop at Goodwill and yard sales. When you&#39;re shopping ask him if he thinks something is sturdy enough to last a good long while. Point out any weaknesses you notice. Ask his opinion about them. And if the toy doesn&#39;t last, be his partner in that decisions making process. You can say &quot;I guess it wasn&#39;t sturdy enough. We&#39;ll have to do more checking and testing next time.<br/>

<br/>
That would be charity shops and carboot sales.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that there will be unbreakable screens (or less breakable screens) on some tablet computers soon (maybe there already are).  <br/>
<br/>
Beds seem soft, but then they&#39;re flexible, and something solid can be broken by an elbow or by rolling over on it.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby used to break video game controllers.  I think he broke three or four of them, and they were $30 apiece which for us, at the time, was a lot of money.  I got angry, the first few times, and then realized they were fragile things and he was exuberant and easily frustrated.  When Marty broke them, it was when he was older, and he just wore them out by careful but constant use.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids are different.  People are different.<br/>
<br/>
We have pop-up books that lasted through many viewings.  Some kids break them the first day.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to know your child&#39;s actual abilities and traits, rather than wondering what a seven- or four-year-old child can/should/will do.<br/>
<br/>
This jumped out at me, though:<br/>
-=- I&#39;m sad for my 4 year old, that another thing that was hers too has been broken-=-<br/>
<br/>
Shared valuables is a disaster waiting to happen.  <br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something valuable, let it be yours.  Then you get to graciously allow its use, on your terms, and politely take it back and put it up in a safe place  when people are done, or getting rough.<br/>

Just yesterday he hit a tree with his new gator. Luckily it did not break anything because this time they got one with super protection thingies that really protect it! <br/>

His Iphone I bought an Otter Box cover that has a hard case and a rubber case around it plus a screen protection. So far so good. He has gotten better with cel phones. We used to replace one every few months. <br/>
<br/>
Can you find some things that help him like that. THe other thing I always did,still do is take care of the stuff for them and help them with reminders. <br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s keyboards get trashed every six months. It just happens. Since I have stepped over my laptop twice and broken the screen twice , and I am careful, I understand that stuff happens so even my Iphone has an Otter box cover just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Electronics  break easy. <br/>
<br/>
I also get replacement plans when I buy electronics. All of our gaming systems and computers have those replacements protection plans. It has been great and I have used them!! They have paid off for me. <br/>
Is there something like that you can purchase for their electronics?<br/>

It doesn&#39;t protect the screen but makes it much easier for our little ones to handle and spot (ie not drop or loose beneath a blanket) and offers bounce protection...so far so good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115741069">I must say I can understand the frustration, because I have gone through<br/>
it. Although not with electronics, with other newly bought toys that get<br/>
broken within a day or just a few. I do feel sometimes like just getting<br/>
nothing else for them, but I kno that isn&#39;t the right way to do things...<br/>
so I have &quot;replaced&quot; the time instead of the &quot;toy&quot;. Since we no longer have<br/>
x, what would you like to do during this time? We could play soccer<br/>
outside, or go for a bike ride, perhaps a hike, or even a simple tv time<br/>
can do. Not sure if your family watches youtube, but now with verizon you<br/>
can watch them on the tv which requires no ipad, or computer. I also do<br/>
spend a bit extra on toys to get a better quality. I try to buy the wooded<br/>
version most of the time (which they actually love even more) and it helps.<br/>
So, although I am pretty new to the unschooling and can&#39;t give you huge<br/>
examples from years of experience I can say that choosing to use the &quot;time&quot;<br/>
for something else has helped us a lot. It helps the budget, me by not<br/>
getting angry &quot;again&quot; and the fact that they get to do something else,<br/>
excites them.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m the clumsy one in our home.  I&#39;ve broken most of the glasses that have been broken, even the ones I really liked.  As hard as I try, and as careful as I am, a couple glasses, bowls or plates every year still seem to slip (secretly, I think they jump) out of my hand and break.  When this does happen, I still hear the criticism I used to get as a young person running it&#39;s recording in my mind.  It&#39;s a series of frustrated put-downs that continue to make my shoulders slump in disappointment at myself.  <br/>
<br/>
My clumsiness was worse when my body was growing.  There was a year where I grew several inches.  My arm lengths were no longer predictable.  Many nights at the dinner table I would reach for my glass of milk, only to miss my target and knock it over.  The reaction was always the same - intense and frustrated.  A flurry of cleaning ensued.  A barrage of the same statements and rhetorical questions were loudly shared.  I felt at a total loss as to what the heck was &quot;wrong&quot; with me, and wondered why I was built so awkwardly.  Eventually, I started eating by myself at a tv table downstairs.  I did so until I moved out on my own. <br/>
<br/>
I can completely understand my parents&#39; exasperation at having the milk fly across the table many a dinner.  But, upon seeing this unfortunate affliction of mine repeated over and over, why would they insist on putting out fabric table cloths and nice quilted place mats?  Weren&#39;t there covered cups available then?  Couldn&#39;t there have been *some* humour or understanding?  You see where I&#39;m going...The being upset with me wasn&#39;t remedying the situation.  It didn&#39;t -it *couldn&#39;t* - stop the girl with the growing arms from underestimating her span and sending the milk for a spill!  Problem solving would have made all the difference, not only to my self esteem, but likely to the quality of the remainder of our dinners as well.</div>

<br/>
Very nicely put.<br/>
<br/>
I am still unhappy about a (very rare) outing to a restaurant once, with another family.  I got chocolate milk, and was VERY excited about that!  But I spilled. it.  The waitress quickly offered to bring me another one, but my mom wouldn&#39;t let her.  She said no, that I had spilled it and so I wasn&#39;t going to get any.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember the waitress hesitating, like she was going to insist, or argue.  She felt sorry for me.<br/>

Probably less expensive to budget replacement screens.<br/>
Adam Daniel dropped his iPad this summer, and I poked around the internet and found an inexpensive replacement source.  It might still be in my search history...<br/>

dishes with me.  I thought that this was amazing fun!<br/>
However, I had a beautiful set of collectible antique stoneware dishes that<br/>
would often end up chipped or broken.  My mother and I painstakingly<br/>
collected these dishes and they were special to me.  Every time one of them<br/>
was damaged, a little part of my heart broke...<br/>
<br/>
So, I packed them all up carefully and put them into special &#39;china<br/>
vaults&#39;.  I went out and bought a bunch of mismatched porcelain from the<br/>
local thrift stores and big box stores.  So whenever one broke (breaks), I<br/>
could just smile and say, &quot;Oops, let&#39;s clean it up!&quot; with no emotional<br/>
attachment.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that every time I would express my sadness about a broken dish,<br/>
my children took it to heart and it hurt them.  I realized that my<br/>
relationship with my children was more important than my desire to use a<br/>
particular set of dishes.<br/>
