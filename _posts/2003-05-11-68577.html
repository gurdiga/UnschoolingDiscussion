I&#39;d love to know what&#39;s on your personal/spiritual growth bookshelf!  Would <br/>
you mind sharing?  Your insight amazes me!<br/>

Let&#39;s see, the most basic of books for me is the Tao Te Ching. (I use <br/>
the Jane English translation.) I get something new each time I look <br/>
there. I also have some books interpreting the Tao such as The Tao of <br/>
Pooh by Hoff (pretty simple) and Embarking on The Way by Solala <br/>
Towler (a little more in-depth.)<br/>
<br/>
I love to read anything from The Dalai Lama and especially like a <br/>
simple little book of his called The Dalai Lama&#39;s Book of Wisdom. I <br/>
also have one called The Art of Happiness that I haven&#39;t finished yet.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a great book on mindful parenting called Everday Blessings by <br/>
Jon and Myla Kabat-Zinn. Their descriptions of mindfullness at work <br/>
in our lives and our parenting has been very helpful to me.<br/>
<br/>
My most recent read and my current favorite is The Power of NOW by <br/>
Eckhardt Tolle. Wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
