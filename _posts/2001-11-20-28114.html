<div id="ygrps-yiv-660612943">We just got home from what was supposed to be a quick errand, but along the <br/>
way we had a car accident.  It was nothing serious, and neither me nor my son <br/>
was hurt. A car cut me off, and I braked and swerved to avoid an accident, <br/>
hitting  high curb on the side. I blew both right tires, destroyed a steel <br/>
wheel. The other car drove off.<br/>
<br/>
It sucks...money is tight right now anyway because we&#39;ve recently bought a <br/>
house, etc. --But we&#39;re okay.  And someone once told me that a problem you <br/>
can throw money at and make it go away is not a very interesting problem.  <br/>
But, if you have any to spare---I could use sympathy.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934586768">Take a hot bath, drink some tea and relax tonight.  Jenni says try <br/>
some vodka in your tea!  I hope you find some cheap tires!  I lucked <br/>
into some when I needed them so I hope you do too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031160759">Glad you are ok, please keep in mind that sometimes being hurt from auto <br/>
accident<br/>
doesn&#39;t show up right away.<br/>
Please...keep watch over both of you.<br/>
you have my sympathies.<br/>
