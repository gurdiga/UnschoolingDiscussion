<div id="ygrps-yiv-170008425">Thanks to everyone who responded by e-mail on through the loop to help me<br/>
with record-keeping and curriculum description.  I think what I&#39;m most<br/>
lacking in at this point is confidence and experience.  I also have a fear<br/>
of how my efforts will be discredited by DH and the court system if DH<br/>
questions our unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently learned about the Santa Fe Home Study Program, and am<br/>
wondering if any of you are familiar with them or have ever used them.  It<br/>
may be just the ticket for me.  They will collect my log entries and<br/>
translate them into class credits quarterly based upon hours.  They will<br/>
also provide support in helping to translate the day&#39;s activities into the<br/>
logbook entries.  I figure I could probably benefit by doing this with them<br/>
for a year.  Then I&#39;d probably have enough confidence and experience to go<br/>
it on my own, although I may benefit legally from a sustained relationship<br/>
with them.  Any input appreciated, Thanks, Annette</div>
