western culture.  Children are a part of the process and are allowed to<br/>
participate in the open grieving and emotional processes of death with the<br/>
rest of the family/social group.  They understand that death (of people or<br/>
animals) is a part of the natural cycle and the natural completion of the<br/>
life cycle.  It is not something shunned or unmentionable, but something<br/>
that just happens, like birth or illness or breathing.  It is a part of life.<br/>

peaceful, natural experience.It was truly awesome to be there when the woman <br/>
who brought me into the world left.  <br/>
