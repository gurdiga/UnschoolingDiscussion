What a wonderful idea, the healing circle!  I think I may do some little <br/>
ceremony with my son, after our adoption is complete (my hubby is adopting my <br/>
son-the evil ex signed over his parental rights when I started going after <br/>
money).  What a wonderfully sensitive mom you must be!  Want to adopt a 36 <br/>
yo?  :)<br/>
<br/>
The healing cirlce would be especially great since my son has decided to <br/>
explore wiccans.  He is a wonderfully inquisitive boy, I really love <br/>
following his lead!<br/>

took a class together, checked out some websites, got a whole lot of new <br/>

Homeschool takes some different turns, doesn&#39;t it? I totally love the way we <br/>

Thank you for sharing your story with us.  I have a 12 yo stepson who we <br/>
will be homeschooling in the fall.  I am wondering how his &quot;mother&quot; will <br/>
react when we inform her of our family&#39;s decision.  We have joint <br/>
residential custody, but she has never been involved in his education <br/>
before.  It should be interesting.  I&#39;ve been wondering what the legal <br/>
ramifications could be if she gives us a hard time.  How much say does <br/>
someone have if they have joint non-residential custody?  Anyone know?<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi Amy,<br/>
&gt;Seems like a long time ago now - about 9 years! - that my son&#39;s father, <br/>
&gt;Ted,<br/>
&gt;decided to file for divorce. We&#39;d been living separately for over 4 years; <br/>
&gt;my son<br/>
&gt;was 5. The two had seen each other for a total of about  - oh, I&#39;d say 8 to <br/>
&gt;12<br/>
&gt;hours in those four years. Ted wanted joint custody because he &quot;wasn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;sure&quot;<br/>
&gt;about &quot;this homeschooling thing&quot;. He lived 300 miles away, and didn&#39;t want <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;take over the parenting or anything, he just wanted to be able to make <br/>
&gt;decisions<br/>
&gt;about how &quot;his son&quot; should live! He&#39;d pay for the divorce and everything, I<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t have to worry about that. He&#39;d take care of it all as soon as he got <br/>
&gt;back<br/>
&gt;from his trip to Hawaii. (Nice of him!) Well, as you can imagine, the next <br/>
&gt;day I<br/>
&gt;went out and got myself a lawyer and filed for divorce on my terms. His <br/>
&gt;case was<br/>
&gt;a lost cause from the start, and though the lawyers tried to screw us <br/>
&gt;around and<br/>
&gt;make it take a lot longer than it should have, and I ended up with a lot <br/>
&gt;less in<br/>
&gt;child support than I think I should have, I have sole custody of my son, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;we&#39;ve been homeschooling ever since.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ted never was able to handle the responsiblilty of fatherhood, and the 6 or <br/>
&gt;7<br/>
&gt;years of his life before my son finally divorced his dad were filled with <br/>
&gt;lies<br/>
&gt;and broken promises on Ted&#39;s part, and heartbreak, anger, hatred, guilt, <br/>
&gt;fear and<br/>
&gt;nightmares for my son. Finally, I don&#39;t remember if JL was 6 or 7, at <br/>
&gt;midnight on<br/>
&gt;New Years Eve, we had a healing circle that included a &quot;funeral&quot; ceremony <br/>
&gt;for the<br/>
&gt;father that JL never had, and a snuffing of his father&#39;s candle. This part <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;JL&#39;s inclusion, and it turned out to be crucial to the ceremony. In fact it <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt;to be (rather gleefully) snuffed three times before it was really &quot;done&quot;. <br/>
&gt;After<br/>
&gt;that the intensity went out of his feelings about his father, and they <br/>
&gt;gradually<br/>
&gt;just faded away. Now, at 14, he has no particular feelings toward his <br/>
&gt;father (not<br/>
&gt;conscious ones anyway), and there has been almost no contact for years (a <br/>
&gt;30<br/>
&gt;second birthday phone call 2 or 3 years ago).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A legally simple situation; his demand for joint custody was laughable. I <br/>
&gt;hope<br/>
&gt;all goes well in the situation you are thinking of.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: New to the list<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi!  I am new to the list, my name is Amy, and I am the proud mom of one <br/>
&gt;son.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  My ds is 7 1/2 yo, and we are unschoolers.  I also run an award winning<br/>
&gt; &gt; In-Home Daycare for children, lead a 4-H group, and have started a local<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschooling support group.  Of course, I could not do all of this <br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt; &gt; the support of my wonderful hubby, he is the best.  My son is an <br/>
&gt;Active/Alert<br/>
&gt; &gt; child, which is sort of a combination of traits from ADD, ADHD, and ODD.<br/>
&gt; &gt; These children are very bright, but will defy you to the ends of the <br/>
&gt;earth.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Essentially their main problem is that they have hyper-sensitive sensory<br/>
&gt; &gt; perceptions, and therefore feel overwhelmed most of the time.  This in <br/>
&gt;turn<br/>
&gt; &gt; creates a fearful child, who tries to control this fear by controlling<br/>
&gt; &gt; his/her environment (clear as mud?)  Anyway, I really look forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; exchanging ideas and stories with all of you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I do have one request:  If any of you have been involved in a custody <br/>
&gt;issue<br/>
&gt; &gt; with an ex-spouse (that involved homeschooling), and if you don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt; &gt; sharing your story with other homeschoolers, would you please email me<br/>
&gt; &gt; privately?  Thanks so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Best wishes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Amy Aponte<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

My son is 7 1/2, and ALL BOY!  He has an active/alert personality (know <br/>
anyone who sells running shoes cheap:0) ?)   He really loves to explore <br/>
anything and everything, like taking apart the fish tank!  :0)  Hope he does <br/>
not decide to take apart the cat, to see how she works!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Could you please let me know what happens?  I am collecting info on legal <br/>
cases when they involve homeschooling.  You can send it directly to me, and <br/>
also let me know if you can give permission to have your story, should you <br/>
become involved in a legal battle over the homeschooling,  published on a <br/>
legal site for homeschoolers.  We can use aliases if you prefer.  <br/>
