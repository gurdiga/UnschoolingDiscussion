<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123900569">Hi All,<br/>
  Yesterday was a warm but rainy day. The natives were getting restless so I <br/>
decided to take a walk. Two of my children dd 2 and dd 6 happily agreed to <br/>
come with me. While taking a walk in the rain we came to a grated sewer drain. We <br/>
stood there for quite a while watching the water flow in from two drains then <br/>
go out one larger one. We became entranced. My six year old then became VERY <br/>
excited and asked numerous questions about the creation of the sewer system, <br/>
who invented it, when, where, why, etc.... I answered as much as I knew, then <br/>
when Dad came home he in turn did the same (thankfully he&#39;s much more <br/>
knowledgeable on the subject). She was FAIRLY content but would like more info in books <br/>
or videos. I found a few of each from our local library but still not enough. <br/>
(I actually found one video for the actual sewer system in our area!!) She <br/>
has always been interested in architecture in various degrees but now has a new <br/>
found excitement to explore unknown territories in her world. <br/>
   Any suggestions will be appreciated!!! Thanks in advance.<br/>
                                     Kimberly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361451527">I have a friend in England who&#39;s working on a PhD in medieval archeology, so <br/>
I sent her these questions and I hope she&#39;ll send ideas.  But in the meantime, <br/>
maybe look into the history of some major cities.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know of any cities that had sewer systems in history/antiquity which <br/>
have been mapped and documented well?  Just even the names of cities you know <br/>
had sewers would help.<br/>
<br/>
Paris, famously.<br/>
<br/>
Rome.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s that little ditch in the road in Cambridge?  Was that originally for <br/>
drainage and street-cleaning purposes?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks Sandra!! We took your suggestion and looked into a few major <br/>
cities with historical sewer systems. We&#39;ve learned a lot!! I must <br/>
admit,I wasn&#39;t as eager as my little one when this investigation <br/>
began but I now find myself VERY fasinated and looking forward to <br/>
learning more. Please, keep me posted if your friend should send any <br/>
information as well.<br/>
