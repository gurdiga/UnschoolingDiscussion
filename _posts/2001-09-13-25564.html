<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996738916">And lets define &quot;those who are UNABLE to care for themselves.  All I see is a whole society that is dependent on social programs.  I see welfare sure was a great &quot;socialist&quot; success.......all social programs do is breed laziness and dependence.....but then again, that is what the Democrats in this country want, for us to be dependent on them.  Because only when you have dependence can you start a dictatorship.  Sure they have communist ideas but we can&#39;t be naive enough to believe that there would not be some sort of dictator at the throne.  While I can see some of the good points in the communists theories, it has proven over and over again that it cannot work......perhaps its just human nature that gets in the way, but ultimately people have the desire to do and be more.<br/>

  &lt;&lt;Marx called religion the &quot;opium of the masses&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  And I would agree.  I just think there is a tremendous difference between religion (the church) and Christianity (the teachings of Christ).<br/>
<br/>
  As far as Christianity and capitalism go, how can one be a pure capitalist (supply and demand, etc.) and be merciful to those less fortunate who are unable to provide for themselves.  You have to turn to some kind of socialism which is where the U.S. appears to be moving.<br/>
