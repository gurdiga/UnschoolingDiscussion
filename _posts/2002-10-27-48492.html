<div id="ygrps-yiv-691677697">I admit it! I am a huge ER fan. Last night I was watching Ocean&#39;s 11 and <br/>
remembered that the actor that played Basher looked like the guest star to be <br/>
on ER this Thursday. So I (of course) googled it. I put in NBC ER and Don <br/>
Cheadle. One of the things that came up was an article about the recent ER <br/>
episode&#39;s dealing with a small pox outbreak. It talked about how major <br/>
pharmaceutical companies are helping the Homeland Health by donating vaccines <br/>
so the government will have enough to vaccinate every person in the US in the <br/>
event of a major outbreak.  &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homelandhealth.com/news/media/newsreleases/2002-05-16.146.phtml&quot;">http://www.homelandhealth.com/news/media/newsreleases/2002-05-16.146.phtml&quot;</a>&gt;Homeland Health - Tonight NBC&#39;s &quot;ER&quot; Features <br/>
Fictional Account of a Smallpox Outbreak&lt;/A&gt; <br/>
 www. homelandhealth.com/news/media/newsreleases/2002-05-16.146.phtml <br/>
<br/>
At the top of the page there are links that say *Health for &gt; consumers <br/>
*Health for &gt; Health Care Professionals *Health for &gt; Media and *Health for &gt; <br/>
Our Government Does anyone else find it a bit unnerving that not only is <br/>
there an office called Homeland Security (or whatever it is called) but also, <br/>
a subsidiary called Homeland Health? Or am I just being paranoid?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well it isn&#39;t a subsidiary. If you go to the Who We Are page<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homelandhealth.com/about/who.phtml)">http://www.homelandhealth.com/about/who.phtml)</a> it&#39;s an association of<br/>
American pharmaceutical companies in partnership with the government. And<br/>
despite the number of Who We Are&#39;s I clicked on from the links I followed, I<br/>
still don&#39;t know who they are. At least the US Dept of Health and Human<br/>
Services is prominently mentioned. (Though one could probably guess at many<br/>
of the corporations from the neatly categorized press releases looking like<br/>
independent reporting.)<br/>
<br/>
Personally I worry more about big business than I do about government. I can<br/>
see understaffed underfunded government agencies as being more vulnerable to<br/>
an offer of &quot;free&quot; help from corporations with deep pockets -- and a sharp<br/>
eye on potential profits -- than I do from government. Corporations can<br/>
afford to hire the biggest and brightest manipulators to spin things to<br/>
their advantage -- to make more money to hire even better manipulators to<br/>
make more money. The government is small potatoes in that respect.<br/>
<br/>
Not that the government doesn&#39;t give me the heebie geebies too. Not many<br/>
corporations have the power to drop a nuclear bomb on someone or make laws<br/>
about how someone can go about homeschooling :-/ The Office of Homeland<br/>

Joint Statement by Presidents Bush and Heston Declaring America Safe Again<br/>
for Recreational Assault Weapon Strafing:<br/>
&quot;Late last week saw the arrest of two colored muslamoids who had been<br/>
gunning down innocent Christians all around Washington DC. As a result,<br/>
plenty of ignorant liberals have been bellyaching some garbage about how<br/>
guns can hurt people. Even worse, suddenly it&#39;s taboo to be brandishing your<br/>
heavy artillery at the local playground...&quot;<br/>

Okay.  I know I just told people not to go there, and I&#39;m not rescinding that <br/>
recommendation for anyone who is Christian or kind-hearted or squeamish.   <br/>
But it&#39;s looking like a service of &quot;Landover Baptist Church,&quot; which is a <br/>

Yep, Sandra is right (regarding articles and ads alike).<br/>
