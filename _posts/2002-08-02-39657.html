<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899843824">Hi guys<br/>
Just wanted to share this touching email and thank everyone who took the <br/>
time to answer my 13yo concerns about unschooling.<br/>
Love Joz<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I received this from a good friend who had a choice to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;make. It said that I had a choice to make, too. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;chosen. Now it&#39;s your turn to choose.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The story goes that some time ago a man punished his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;5-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of expensive gold<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became even more<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;upset when the child pasted the gold paper so as to decorate<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless, the little<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;girl brought the gift box to her father the next morning and<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;said, &quot;This is for you, Daddy.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The father was embarrassed by his earlier over reaction,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;but his anger flared again when he found the box was<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;empty. He spoke to her in a harsh manner, &quot;Don&#39;t you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;know, young lady, when you give someone a present there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;supposed to be something inside the package?&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and said, &quot;Oh, Daddy, it&#39;s not empty. I blew kisses into<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it until it was full.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The father was crushed. He fell on his knees and put his<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;arms around his little girl, and he begged her to<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;forgive him for his unnecessary anger.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;An accident took the life of the child only a short time<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;later and it is told that the father kept that gold box<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;by his bed for all the years of his life. And whenever<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;he was discouraged or faced difficult problems he would<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;open the box and take out an imaginary kiss and remember<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the love of the child who had put it there.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;In a very real sense, each of us as human beings have<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;been given a golden box filled with unconditional love<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and kisses from our children, family, and friends.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;And the possessions that do not cost money are worth far<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;more than all the &quot;things&quot; money can only buy.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;You now have two choices ... you can:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;1. Pass this on to your friends, or<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;2. Delete it and act like it didn&#39;t touch your heart.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;As you can see, I took choice No. 1.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Friends are like angels who lift us to our feet when our<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wings have trouble remembering how to fly.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br/>
