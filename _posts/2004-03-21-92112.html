<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687261551">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
Just curious - is anybody planning to go to the Rethinking Education Conference in Dallas over Memorial Day?  We&#39;re visiting my folks in Hurst - so we&#39;re going to &quot;take a break&quot; and go to the conference for the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning to go to Live & Learn too....<br/>
