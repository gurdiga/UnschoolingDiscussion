<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220908398">Well, no -- I am Canadian.  I eat my biscuits with jam or jelly too!  Biscuits and gravy is more a regional thing (Southern US in origin).  Lorna Doone was famous as the heroine of a novel where her whole family were robber-baron-y type thieves, but she was pure in heart and won the love of a good man ... come to find out she was &quot;adopted&quot; (that is, stolen away in infancy) .... I have no idea if the cookie was named after her or not!    Debi<br/>
