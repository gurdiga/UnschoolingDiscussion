going to inconvenience somebody, because I know that it bothers me <br/>
for somebody to come in and start doing something that interferes <br/>
with what I&#39;m already doing.  So, if I was going to paint, and there <br/>
were other people present, I WOULD ask if my painting bothered them <br/>
before I started.   Like, if I&#39;m getting ready to set the table and <br/>
my kids start getting out paint, I&#39;m going to tell them that what <br/>
they are about to do is going to interfere with what I&#39;m doing, and <br/>
that they should have asked first before getting it out. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that doesn&#39;t seem to bother the rest of my family, because <br/>
nobody ever asks to help me clean up, even if they were involved in <br/>
making the mess.  Unless I ASK them to help clean up, they don&#39;t.   <br/>
It doesn&#39;t bother them to stand there and watch me clean up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I see dropping the class for lack of interest as being responsible.  That is <br/>
one possible option for him.  The teacher/leader gets paid one way or the <br/>
other and probably doesn&#39;t care too much if the child attends or not.  I think the <br/>
child is being responsible.  I would not sit there in a class that I didn&#39;t <br/>
find interesting.  <br/>

<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts on the subject.  I am sure others have more <br/>
profound things to say.  My mind is a little foggy this morning/afternoon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Age will change that. My daughter, at 12, is seeing things that need done<br/>
and doing them. Last year she&#39;s ask if I&#39;d noticed she&#39;d cleaned the sink.<br/>
Before that it was &quot;The sink doesn&#39;t look dirty to me.&quot; ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It helps to step back and look at the atmosphere you&#39;re creating<br/>
objectively. If you do something and expect people to help and are<br/>
resentfully doing it alone, that negative energy seeps out and drives people<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Think about your husband angrily cleaning up something that seems foolish to<br/>
clean up.<br/>
<br/>
Think about him cleaning up something that seems foolish but he&#39;s doing it<br/>
joyfully and asks if you&#39;d like to help or just spend time with him.<br/>
<br/>
Which scenario would you be more likely to join in?<br/>
<br/>
If we expect our kids to do something because if they don&#39;t we&#39;ll be angry<br/>
we&#39;re teaching them that they bear the burden of responsibility for our<br/>
feelings and should set aside their own needs to tend to ours.<br/>
<br/>
If we see the lives we create for them as a gift and invite them joyfully to<br/>
join us (or not!) the whole family is more joyful.<br/>
<br/>
If we want them to treat our needs with respect, then we need to treat their<br/>
needs with respect too. Most parents would get mad at that and say they<br/>
absolutely treat their children&#39;s needs with respect. But if they were to<br/>
observe themselves objectively they&#39;d find that they were picking and<br/>
choosing which needs to respect. They&#39;d be judging what they child needed in<br/>
order to decide if they really needed it and whether to take that need<br/>
seriously or not.<br/>
<br/>
If we want them to treat our needs -- all our needs, especially the needs<br/>
they don&#39;t understand and seem foolish to them -- with respect, we need to<br/>
do the same for them. If they say that finishing a level on a video game or<br/>
seeing the end of a cartoon is important, we have to trust that it is<br/>
important. (And it helps to be involved enough in their lives to understand<br/>
what it means to them too.)<br/>

&gt; that they should have asked first before getting it out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would turn that around. Rather than demanding that they respect my needs,<br/>
I&#39;d respect their need to paint and help them find a better place to set up<br/>
so that both our needs could be met.<br/>
<br/>
I find it really helps to turn my seemingly reasonable reaction around and<br/>
try to hear it coming from my daughter. If I were inadvertently setting up a<br/>
project in the middle of where she was about to build a fort, would I want<br/>
to hear &quot;I was about to build a fort there. You should have asked first<br/>
before doing that.&quot; Or would I rather hear &quot;I was about to build a fort<br/>
there. Can I help you move to another spot?&quot;<br/>
