&lt;&lt; I guess really just trying to get them to &quot;sit down and do their work&quot; <br/>
when <br/>
they want to be doing something else - going outside and playing or watching <br/>
TV or whatever. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you let them play and watch TV, they&#39;ll be learning still, they&#39;ll be <br/>
happier, and you&#39;ll be happier.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It almost always seems to turn into a struggle and even <br/>
then, usually somebody will end up crying/mad during the course of trying to <br/>
&quot;get it all done.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very clear signals!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It seems like the days where I try to get them to do some <br/>
work are always our worst. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
FLAMING 20-foot-high signal!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s really what is getting me to consider <br/>
unschooling, not wanting to make learning a big fight and something to shy <br/>
away from.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, too late on them learning that learning is a big fight and something to <br/>
shy away from.<br/>
<br/>
Not too late to recover and unschool!<br/>
<br/>
Every moment you spend trying to make them &quot;sit down and do their work&quot; will <br/>
have to be undone, so the sooner you stop the sooner you stop the crying, <br/>
fighting, shying away, anger, and burning desire to do something else.<br/>
<br/>
It seems you have been mistaken about what &quot;their work&quot; is, and what YOUR <br/>
work should be.  Building a good relationship with them will overshadow any <br/>
&quot;benefit&quot; of the us vs. them situation you&#39;re in now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for all of your thoughts and advice, yet again, Sandra!  : )  I think <br/>
I really am going to try to get to the HSC convention in August to hear you <br/>
speak!  Just from not having the pressure for this past week I can already <br/>
see the change in my kids, subtle but there.  My older two boys actually got <br/>
two &quot;educational&quot; books at the library -- one about the fifty states and one <br/>
about space that they&#39;ve been reading through and they&#39;ve all been spending <br/>
more time playing outside and just seem a little happier to me.  Maybe I&#39;m <br/>
just noticing things they&#39;d be doing anyway, having high hopes for <br/>
unschooling, but I have noticed it!  My 10 y/o continues to say how he wants <br/>
to do workbooks, etc. but he hasn&#39;t touched one this week and they&#39;ve all <br/>
been readily available to him!  LOL<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for all of the encouragement!<br/>
