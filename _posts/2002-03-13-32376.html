<div id="ygrps-yiv-569170454">&lt;&lt;I need daily help&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I need my kids to pitch in daily.  I don&#39;t consider it help because I do<br/>
consider the things they do their responsibility.  As a family, we are all<br/>
in this together.  My kids (5 of them) know I need them to pitch in because<br/>
we talk about it, about what each would be willing to do, what they see as<br/>
their responsibilities, etc..  Of course, with the younger kids, they need<br/>
reminders and modeling.  But my oldest, at 11, is pretty much<br/>
self-sufficient.  She cleans after herself, her animals, etc. with very<br/>
little interference from me at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think the &quot;trust kids&quot; part doesn&#39;t come in simply thinking the kids will<br/>
magically vacuum their room daily or whatever.  But it comes in when we talk<br/>
with our kids about needs and desires and listen to what they have to say.<br/>
To trust them to come up with solutions.<br/>
