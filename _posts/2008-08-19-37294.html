In regard to our grammar discussion, I should intactify my verb, and  <br/>
say &quot;I love when people brag up Pam Sorooshian,&quot; but in e-mail  <br/>
subjects, the important part will fall right off if it&#39;s too far down  <br/>
the line.<br/>
<br/>
Below is a blog post from &quot;The New Unschooler&quot; here:<br/>

Great Advice For Talking To Relatives<br/>
<br/>
There are so many things I want to tell you about the HSC Learning  <br/>
Without Limits Conference but I&#39;m going to pace myself and tell you  <br/>
about it a little at a time. I will tell you that I was buzzing with  <br/>
excitement the entire weekend. I made some new friends, learned some  <br/>
new things, and my feeling that unschooling is the right path for us  <br/>
was absolutely, 100% confirmed (again and again).<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m going to share the most important nugget of wisdom I found  <br/>
amidst the gold mine of information at the conference. It came from  <br/>
Pam Soorooshian.<br/>
<br/>
On the last day of the conference I cornered Pam in the hallway  <br/>
outside the ballroom where we&#39;d just watched a fabulous slide show of  <br/>
photos from the weekend. I&#39;d been dying to ask here one particular  <br/>
question and hadn&#39;t found the opportunity yet.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to know was this: &quot;How should I respond to my mother-in- <br/>
law when she says that if Jerry doesn&#39;t have to do some things he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do now, he&#39;ll never learn to do the things in life  <br/>
that none of us really want to do, but need to get done nonetheless?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Warren&#39;s mom has mentioned her concern about this a few times and I  <br/>
could never really answer her because I guess a small part of me  <br/>
wondered the same thing. I suspected that, just like the rest of us,  <br/>
he would do some things he didn&#39;t really want to do because he&#39;d have  <br/>
a conflicting need that would trump his desire to avoid the  <br/>
unappealing chore. For example, even though I hate washing dishes, I  <br/>
do wash them because I hate having dishes piled on my counter even  <br/>
more than I hate washing dishes. Pam confirmed that this was true.<br/>
<br/>
Then she asked, &quot;Do you really want him doing things he doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow. When you put it that way I guess I&#39;d have to say no. Not at all.  <br/>
Pam pointed out that she has three girls and she definitely does not  <br/>
want her girls feeling obliged to do things they aren&#39;t comfortable  <br/>
with. That put a whole new twist on the question.<br/>
<br/>
She suggested asking my mother-in-law, &quot;What is your real concern?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not being capable of doing things he doesn&#39;t want to do&quot; is very  <br/>
general. Is she worried that he won&#39;t wash his dishes or clean his  <br/>
house as an adult? That one I can handle.<br/>
<br/>
Or is she worried that he won&#39;t have the tenacity to reach his goals?  <br/>
I have to admit, I&#39;ve asked myself this question, too.<br/>
<br/>
Pam pointed out that most of us want our children to find meaningful  <br/>
work that they love so they won&#39;t have to do things they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to do--like go to a job they hate. Yes, they may need to, say, take a  <br/>
job they aren&#39;t crazy about as a stepping stone to the job of their  <br/>
dreams, but that&#39;s about seeing the big picture and goal setting-- <br/>
it&#39;s not being able to do unappealing activities.<br/>
<br/>
Does Jerry see the big picture? Yes, he does. Most of the time. And  <br/>
when he&#39;s unable to see the whole thing Warren and I are there to  <br/>
fill in the gaps. Is he able to set goals? Pam said he probably does  <br/>
it all the time with video games. And he does. That&#39;s what video  <br/>
games are, right? You set a goal to beat the game and you work at  <br/>
each level, beating them one by one, until you&#39;ve reached it. Are  <br/>
video game goals the only goals he&#39;s interested in at the moment? No,  <br/>
but video games do feature prominently in most of them. He wants to  <br/>
design video games and thanks to a program we discovered this weekend  <br/>
(more about that later!) he&#39;s well on his way. He wants to build a  <br/>
gaming computer and we&#39;re darn close to reaching that one (we&#39;ll  <br/>
start as soon as we get back home). He wants to beat all four Guitar  <br/>
Heroes. He does know how to reach goals but they&#39;re his own goals for  <br/>
himself. Not mine.<br/>
<br/>
So that tidbit was one of the best things about the conference. I&#39;ll  <br/>
get to the rest later.<br/>
<br/>
On the homecoming front, Jerry and I were supposed to be driving home  <br/>
today but Weird Al Yankovic is playing tonight at the State Fair so  <br/>
it looks like we&#39;ll be staying one more night--Jerry can&#39;t stand the  <br/>
thought of missing it.<br/>
<br/>
I never in my life expected to find myself at a Weird Al concert. Ever.</div>

I agree, it was a great conference! I was working at the conference this year so I only made it to a few sessions, but one of those was Pam&#39;s session on unschooling teens.�She had a great analogy about�the difference in how people see�spending money on video games�verses algebra text books, and how it shouldn&#39;t be�any different (of course there was much more to it than that).�It was really enjoyable. I love seeing her speak :-)<br/>
The best part of the conference for me was the after hours, late night chats with everyone. Saturday night we had a great one with a great group of people (including Pam). It&#39;s so nice to have a whole group of unschoolers to talk to and bounce ideas around with<br/>
