<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165630077">I&#39;m new to this list and I really couldn&#39;t help but to put my two cents in. <br/>
If you want to learn ask. If you don&#39;t like the response or you are not <br/>
willing to open your eyes then maybe you should explore other methods. Sit <br/>
back and learn from what other people post here and visit Sandra&#39;s site, it <br/>
is wonderful! I can&#39;t begin to tell you how much I&#39;ve learned here and how <br/>
much it has changed our family.<br/>

PS. Our son is 13 and learning more now (on his own) than he did with 11 <br/>
years of school. <br/>
&lt;&lt; Why am I posting? Gee..to LEARN something from those<br/>
<br/>
here such as I requested in my initial posting and<br/>
<br/>
have received?!  &gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533289632">A wreck? I live in Connecticut on the Mass border and I know of plenty in <br/>
Mass that are not a wreck. Moving away is only running away. How is that <br/>
being strong?<br/>
