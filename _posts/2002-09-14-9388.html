&gt; have a recommendation as to which are better/best? <br/>
&gt; Particularly ones which deal with wildlife in the US,<br/>
&gt; but doesn&#39;t have to be exclusively US.  I have just<br/>
&gt; seen some which hardly deal with US wildlife at all,<br/>
&gt; and living in the country with deer and bears and such<br/>
&gt; as we do, it would be nice for the boys to get a<br/>
&gt; magazine that sometimes deal with the animals that are<br/>
&gt; our neighbors.<br/>
