 </span></blockquote>Uhm, this is me, sad to say.  The only upside being that I&#39;m starting to<br/>
recognize it and acknowledge to my family that it&#39;s my issue and not theirs.<br/>
<br/>
We are having some landlord issues and needed to crisis clean day before<br/>
yesterday.  I was giving my seven year old orders and explaining how<br/>
important it was.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is not one of Mom&#39;s crazy bits!  I swear, this time it&#39;s real.&quot;  Funny<br/>
in retrospect, but ugh.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m getting better!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m with you Kelly! I throw tantrums too. I know the lingo of positive discipline and respect for kids and manage to practice it much of the time but my mom planted that martyr seed deep (And I nurtured it, can&#39;t blame her completely). The one that tells me I never have a free moment, my husband never helps, the kids don&#39;t respect me. That the world revolves around me and is out to get me. Ugh.<br/>
    I raged at my daughter last night and you know what the worst thing is, the thing that made me really work at correcting this? I didn&#39;t feel bad about it. Honestly it feels good to lash out at the kids. I hear other moms talk about how bad they feel right after they&#39;ve spanked their kids and I don&#39;t relate. It&#39;s in moments of reflection, like on this list that I hate what I&#39;ve down. Actually, I guess I do feel guilt, it&#39;s just slow to come. I could see myself becoming an abuser (or staying one, I was not as bad with my rage as some parents I knew but I don&#39;t think it takes much to mark a child) though and so I turned to attachment parenting (thank God for breastfeeding, I credit a lot of my good parenting to that experience), positive discipline and now unschooling. <br/>
    Anyhow...not sure why I made this long confession. I think in part because I&#39;d been talking about non-spanking and such and feeling a bit like a fraud because it&#39;s been such a struggle to stop. And all you cool, nifty parents who seem to have your acts together (I know it just seems that way ;) ) and here I am trying to tread water at times. But thanks, because I&#39;m learning alot here.<br/>
   I love this list.<br/>

<br/>
I know that &quot;never have a free moment&quot; feeling.  Lately I&#39;ve been <br/>
trying to remember that when I&#39;m with my kids it really is *my* <br/>
moment too.  It&#39;s easy for me to think, &quot;As soon as I&#39;m finished <br/>
doing THEIR thing with them, I&#39;ll get back to doing MY thing&quot;. I&#39;m <br/>
trying not to differentiate between my moments and their moments so <br/>
much, so I keep reminding myself that when I&#39;m doing something with <br/>
them, it is something that I&#39;m doing for them AND for me.  I&#39;ve <br/>
always wanted to have kids and I&#39;ve been blessed with three of them, <br/>
so when I&#39;m doing stuff with or for them, I&#39;m really doing what I&#39;ve <br/>
always wanted to do.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been saying (to myself) stuff like, &quot;I GET to go play a game <br/>
with him now&quot; or &quot;I GET to go make him lunch&quot; or &quot;I GET to organize <br/>
their toys now&quot;. <br/>

I remember nudging myself to think that way too, just a few years ago (after <br/>

Marty&#39;s hogging all the atmosphere&quot; thoughts, it helped me to think &quot;Marty is SO <br/>
cool, and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s here instead of at school, and I&#39;m glad he likes me <br/>
enough to share his stories with me.&quot; (or show me his stuff or ask me for help or <br/>
whatever it was)<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays I&#39;m impatient with Holly sometimes, but I remind myself that she&#39;s <br/>
needy in ways I miss Kirby and Marty being, so I take a deep breath and give <br/>
her enough attention for all three of them.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s one reason youngest kids get so much more attention.  (Plus the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008206688">The other day on the phone, when I was in a stinky mood, my mom <br/>
said &quot;well, get yourself out of your bad mood. You need to be sending <br/>
those kids to school so you have more daytime hours to yourself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hello? It&#39;s hanging with my kids that I LIKE about my daytime hours. <br/>
My crankiness that day came from a sink full of dishes AGAIN, and me <br/>
just coming home from running errands and faced with all these <br/>
FREAKING dirty dishes!!! arghhh...not having my kids around <br/>
ferpetesakes. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tantrumed a couple of times, way back when. My poor oldest kid. <br/>
His dad and I divorced when he was six months old, and I had no self-<br/>
control. When the stress got too high, BOOM, I&#39;d blow my top. But <br/>
haven&#39;t freaked out AT THE KIDS in ages. I broke a wooden cutting <br/>
board by slamming it down on the counter top, when I couldn&#39;t find my <br/>
kitchen shears (they&#39;d been borrowed and not returned) but the kids <br/>
weren&#39;t here to witness that nonsense. Thank God.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, in this thread about tantruming, either ourselves or our <br/>
parents...is alcoholism or drug use part of these lives? My dad was <br/>
the &quot;town drunk&quot; as I was growing up and I know my mom&#39;s stress had <br/>
its roots in that. <br/>

<br/>
the &quot;town drunk&quot; as I was growing up and I know my mom&#39;s stress had <br/>
<br/>
its roots in that.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My mom was an alcoholic, and I definitely had the adult-child-of traits, <br/>
though I&#39;m not an alcoholic, and I rarely ever drink.   Before Kirby was born, two <br/>
friends of mine had me where I couldn&#39;t get away (the first of my two broken <br/>
legs, much worse than the recent one, and I was on a kind of traction frame <br/>
and they had come to take care of me against my WAILING objections while Keith <br/>
drove 200 miles for a job interview), and they both also being adult children <br/>
of alcoholics, brought me literature, and when I could get up and into a car, <br/>
one of them took me to meetings.  <br/>
<br/>
I went to meetings for four years.  When the meeting dissolved, Marty was <br/>
about six months old, and I was MUCH much better.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the first time I didn&#39;t have a tantrum at all, and calmly dealt <br/>
with something that before I would have pulled a Donald Duck about:<br/>
<br/>
I was late to be somewhere, and had given Kirby a bath in a baby bathtub on <br/>
the kitchen table.  He was clean and dressed and ready to go, and I picked the <br/>
bathtub up to turn and pour the water in the kitchen sink, ONE step away, and <br/>
it bent and the water went ALL over the floor.   <br/>
<br/>
I just looked at it, and thought &quot;Well the floor needed mopping anyway,&quot; <br/>
threw my boxful of rags on top of it, sopped up the worst part, put the rags in <br/>
the bathtub, and went where I needed to go, without so much as saying &quot;shit&quot; or <br/>
whimpering.<br/>
<br/>
And it felt pretty good.   Though I was 32 or 33, I felt like a mature <br/>
grownup person instead of a miserable victim.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was saved most of my rage-life.  Keith had a few years of it before we <br/>
had kids, so he KNOWS I&#39;m better and he seems to appreciate it.<br/>

************************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I herd the same the past couple of weeks. I am 17 weeks pregnant now and have <br/>
not been feeling well.  It was suggested that I was stressing that I had a <br/>
baby on the way and worried that I couldn&#39;t handle all four at home.  Wrong! <br/>
Turns out my ill feelings and easy to get worked up was part of the pregnancy but <br/>
also a possible heart condition that up set me the more I got upset. <br/>
<br/>
Hard to explain but when something adds a little stress or physical energy I <br/>
have been getting chest pressure, burning, labored breathing, numb arms and <br/>
left arm ache.  I ended up being admitted in the hospital last week but my <br/>
family still says awe its just panic attacks or anxiety and I should send the kids <br/>
to school! <br/>
<br/>
I told them my cholesterol and trigliserides (sp) are high and I have been <br/>
told I may have a minor block in my Subclaven but they just dont listen. Its <br/>
just sad... My Mom isn&#39;t even talking to me because her husband an Xray tech says <br/>
there is nothing wrong with me.<br/>
Someday I will accept my Mother for who she is but for now it is hard to see <br/>
how she can be so rotten.  She wont even tell me our family medical history.<br/>
Sorry this is off topic but brought it to mind this am. Laura<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893328725">I&#39;ve been to ACOA meetings a couple different times in my life, and <br/>
always came away from them knowing how much worse my life could have <br/>
been. My dad was a drunk (he is alive still, but doesn&#39;t drink any <br/>
more) but a happy drunk, a fall-down-on-the-sidewalk-outside-the-<br/>
house drunk, but not violent. Never missed a day&#39;s work. He&#39;d come <br/>
home plastered, then get up the next morning and go to work. We lived <br/>
in a nicer neighborhood, not a dive, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When I would go to ACOA meetings, I&#39;d hear horror stories, like being <br/>
locked in the closet or beat with a belt, and say to myself &quot;What am <br/>
I DOING here? I need to get OVER it. My life wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the worst things had to do with unpredictability, more than <br/>
violence. Is dad coming home drunk or sober tonight? Is mom going to <br/>
freak out or give him the cold shoulder, this time? Is dad going to <br/>
be lovey-dovey and all free with his emotions, or ignore us and turn <br/>
on the TV, or get ticked at mom for not being a House Keeper?<br/>
<br/>
Strange how a moderately unpleasant upbringing could produce such <br/>
inner angst in me...<br/>
<br/>
well, it&#39;s changing. It started changing long before I ever heard of <br/>
unschooling, but the list here helps me day to day, and I&#39;m confident <br/>
my kids have it better than I had it, and I pray that they improve <br/>
upon my methods for their kids.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Neither in my family. I think my mom was just resentful and angry. She has always told me about the opportunities she&#39;s missed in life. She was (and is) very much the classic martyr where the house would be clean if not for us, things would run smoothly if not for us and when things work it&#39;s only because she&#39;s managed to pull it together. At the same time of course she was wonderful and layed the foundations for unschooling in me (she just told me she was a fan of John Holts from waaay back). She recognizes much of what she did in the past that was wrong but does little to change it now. I think too she doesn&#39;t really trust us to make decisions, as she&#39;s always told us what to do. I was doing laundry at her house the other day, cleaned the lint trap and left the lint on a shelf. There&#39;s no garbage in that room so I&#39;d planned to take it up when I was done all my laundry. 20 mins later she was ranting about the lint and how no one ever puts it in the garbage. I don&#39;t think it would occur to her to take a moment and trust that I would clean it up when I was done. <br/>
      So my battles have been to take that moment when somethings not done and trust that it will be. Also, to make housework a joy in this house (It&#39;s been shocking to realize I enjoy much of it) and not a burden to resent. I had to realize that when I create burdens for myself its the family that has to bear the weight of it. <br/>
      So no drugs or drinking but...I think my mother&#39;s addiction was her rage. And I think I caught it, I&#39;m by no means over it but I&#39;m much, much better than I was even a year ago. And it is an addiction, it feels good and lets you selfishly wallow in self pity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861430619">Mom was a clean-aholic. Child of an abusive alcoholic mother and grandmother. <br/>
She complained about us helping but when we tried she would go behind us and <br/>
clean again. Later as I got older I would watch her go after my little sister <br/>
if she was mad at me or my step father in a rage and sling her around the <br/>
room. It was scary and she made it like punishment to the person who complained.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive to me and sexually to my Mom. <br/>
He cheated on her and they divorced when I was 9. I remember my mom having a <br/>
miscarriage right in front of us after my dad walked out that day.  I was sad <br/>
that he left even though he only beat me and put me in the hospital for <br/>
dehydration and bowel blockage due to emotional stress.<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t joined the Marines I would prob not have done as well as I have.  <br/>
I am now closer to my Dad as my Mom would rather gossip about me than get to <br/>
know me for who I am. Just this weekend I was told that she was complaining <br/>
about me and my so-called heart concern.  She is online everyday and never says <br/>
hello. She calls when she needs something that&#39;s all. I am the closest of her <br/>
children being 20 min away from her and she hasn&#39;t come to my home in a year.<br/>
<br/>
When she was married in September (the weekend of my sons birthday) I sewed <br/>
her purse, helped set up the hall and was here at her disposal when she needed <br/>
to call.  I feel like a doormat.<br/>
Maybe am grumpy today I dont know....... I know I need to walk away for a <br/>
while for my own health and my families but It is so hard to see such treatment <br/>
and not understand it.<br/>

put ANYthing aWAY around here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But my mom got in the habit of saying &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; about <br/>
things. Like I&#39;d leave my drinking glass on the (very cluttered <br/>
already) counter top and she&#39;d say &quot;What&#39;s WRONG with you? You never <br/>
put anything away&quot; Hearing that every day, you wonder what really IS <br/>
wrong with you...<br/>
<br/>
that, plus giving a person a job to do, then taking it away and doing <br/>
it herself...with a little sigh of exasperation...when you weren&#39;t <br/>
doing it to her satisfaction; these are not violent things, but are <br/>
quite damaging. At age 16, I believed that I was incapable of doing <br/>
anything right. <br/>
<br/>
Like Sandra, part of what I &quot;got&quot; from her, was what not to do. I <br/>
still am &quot;becoming my mother&quot; in many ways, but my brother and sister <br/>
don&#39;t hesitate to say &quot;Okay, SHEEEEELA&quot; (my mom&#39;s name) and I chill. <br/>
LOL ANYthing but become my MOTHER! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never gotten on any of my kids&#39; about overeating. I look at my <br/>
15 year old, with her cute, curvaceous figure, and realize when I was <br/>
that size and that weight, my mom said it every day &quot;You need to lose <br/>
some weight&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Never said &quot;What is WRONG with you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Never taken a job away from any kid, once they started it. Might not <br/>
ASK them, if I want it done quickly, mind you...but once they&#39;re <br/>
rolling along, using whatever means...I bite my tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Never expected them to clean up when I&#39;m not...and so forth. <br/>

You know, one of the ironic things about my faith (Christian) is that <br/>
I am called to be a servant. It is a main precept of Christianity, <br/>
and yet, when the opportunity arises in the form of folding laundry <br/>
or sweeping the floor...grouse, grumble, martyrdom...I have to keep <br/>
it in the front of my mind. I can do it with joy, or with resentment. <br/>
Choose joy!<br/>

Plastic disposable bowls for cereal in the morning, paper plates for<br/>

  LOL Heidi, Yup I am...according to Pat Buchanan. That&#39;s what he called Canada after we decided to sit out the war on Iraq. I like it so I throw it around occasionally. ;)<br/>
<br/>
  But boy, does your mom ever sound like mine. As I said, my mom has her wonderful side to but there&#39;s a big blind spot when it comes to some of her parenting...And her continued treatment of us at times. We can be wonderfully close and great friends at times but when shes in a sour mood everyone is the enemy and everyone suffers.<br/>
      I also know what you mean about taking jobs away. Gosh, why did mom ever expect us to pitch in when what we did was never good enough? And the weight...except she never commented on our weight but I always heard about how heavy SHE was (and how stupid on occasion) and her dialogue to herself became how I thought I should talk to myself at times. there&#39;s also the fact that, &quot;Have you lost weight?&quot; is always to be interpretted as, &quot;you look really good.&quot; I hate that compliment. Oh well, I have to remember that as I dig these old complaints up I have to file them away under &quot;change this&quot; instead of just stewing over them. :)<br/>

just sad... My Mom isn&#39;t even talking to me because her husband an Xray <br/>

there is nothing wrong with me.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heart attacks and other heart problems are underdiagnosed in women <br/>
because the symptoms are different from what the average man has.  (Most <br/>
of us know that, and I would hope anyone who works in a hospital, even <br/>
an X-ray tech would know that.)  Being dismissive of the symptoms you <br/>
described is dangerous.  Speak up for yourself and don&#39;t let the <br/>
naysayers dominate your thinking, ok?<br/>
<br/>
Grrrrr.  Why is this man being so dismissive?  Is he afraid &quot;his&quot; wife <br/>

accepted finally that Cait will never go to high school and that &quot;having fun&quot; <br/>
all day or doing &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; is OK (or else he&#39;s just stopped asking <br/>
about it).<br/>
<br/>
BUT and isn&#39;t there always a BUT... he is forever more saying &quot;John take out <br/>
the garbage&quot;.  Which promptly gets ignored or John will answer him and say OK, <br/>
I will, but never does.  He&#39;s asked me many times how the garbage gets <br/>
emptied when he&#39;s not here.  I&#39;ve told him repeatedly that because it is no one in <br/>
particulars job, someone just does it, and most likely it is JOHN.  He&#39;s <br/>
exasperated by that fact and once even accused me of having some magical power over <br/>
the children that he does not possess.  Once he said I was doing &quot;IT&quot; to make <br/>
him seem like he had no control in the house.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I think he is finally seeing that no one, including children like to be <br/>
told what to do and when.  That pitching in with no expectations gets the most <br/>
help if you really need it.<br/>
<br/>
Life is so much more pleasant without the demands and angry voices, for <br/>
EVERYONE, especially the children.<br/>

It helped to point out to him that if he comes home opens the pantry and sees <br/>
a full trash can and it&#39;s important to HIM that it go out that very minute, <br/>
well maybe HE should be the one to go ahead and do it, he didn&#39;t like being <br/>
TOLD for HIM to do it, even though he was the one standing over it yelling about <br/>
it.  It didn&#39;t take long for him to come around after I started using that <br/>
tactic.  Once it&#39;s pointed out how silly it seems to call for someone to leave <br/>
whatever THEY are doing to come take care of a problem you could handle in maybe <br/>
two minutes... then it made sense to him.<br/>

me and Irene (three years younger) too, like she didn&#39;t have any idea what to <br/>

Whoever told you that is not your friend.  <br/>
<br/>
What you wrote reminds me of something.  My brother made a snide comment <br/>
about me to my mother once, and instead of just glossing over it for my sake, my <br/>
mother passed the comment on to me like she was enjoying the joke.<br/>
<br/>
That is not good motherly behavior.  My mom&#39;s an alcoholic, too.  Our <br/>
relationship is relatively fine, but I try to look at some of her comments and <br/>
actions in the broad daylight, instead of cloaked in the dynamics of my childhood.  <br/>
<br/>
When I speak to one grown son about the other, it is always with the intent <br/>
of fostering understanding and relationship between them, not helping spread <br/>
hurt feelings around.  (They get along pretty well, considering the rough time <br/>
the younger one is having with being 19 right now.)  I wish my mother would do <br/>
the same.<br/>

but she never officially told the police (wonder why). Needless to say I had my <br/>
sister for the summer so she could get herself together or be free who knows?<br/>
Anyone who knows my Mom (not family) wouldn&#39;t believe she would be such a way.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom has been telling stories about me since I was little. A friend of the <br/>
family who only speaks to me tells me she doesn&#39;t know how I am still <br/>
alive...... Guess there is more stuff I dont know but at this point I dont want to <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Whine over--I do apologize for my complaining today.  I think my goal in life <br/>
is just to be loved.  I work much to hard at that with my Mom sometimes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535587190">&lt;&lt;Maybe she&#39;s just embarrassed because she doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
My own family history is full of bunk, so I hesitate to share either version <br/>
one or version two of granny.  She did have diabetes and went blind; autopsy <br/>
says not diabetes (says my mom, who isn&#39;t a reliable reporter).   So I say <br/>
&quot;maybe diabetes, heard not.&quot;  <br/>

No, she knows.  She knows it all. She was a CNA for a while and took care of <br/>
them both. She is just being impossible. When I was admitted last week she <br/>
didn&#39;t care. When my sister miscarried she didn&#39;t even call her. <br/>
Her new husband called me a hypocrite and a hypochondriac last week. He says <br/>
he works in the Xray department and only 10% have actual heart issues the <br/>
other 90 % are fakers. Though he has a many medical issues himself (he&#39;s maybe <br/>
50). Hmmm...  I asked him last night if big differences in my right and left arms <br/>
was normal and he insisted i did my BP wrong. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see a doc when I have babies that&#39;s all. My Mom isn&#39;t calling because of <br/>
him. Give her a man and its all over. When she met my little sisters dad in the <br/>
80&#39;s she left us a note and told us to pack our bags that DCYS was coming. All <br/>
I did was baby-sit my little sister I was a good kid. Needless to say we ran <br/>
away for a week and that&#39;s when I was raped by my sisters (now known) sex <br/>
offending husband and later beaten by my dad. I was 13 I think.  When she fails <br/>
she tosses her kids like trash.<br/>
I will never be like her that&#39;s an agreement my older sister and I made. So <br/>
far so good but I am defiantly wanting to understand her and have her <br/>
understand me.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Doc&#39;s and dismissing women this is so true! If not for the <br/>
womansheart.org web site I would not be pushing them. Today I went to a cardiologist <br/>
and ended up with the one I insisted that I didn&#39;t want and he suggested that <br/>
I am panicking because I have a baby on the way. NOT!<br/>
 He is putting an incident monitor on me but not till Monday? So when i <br/>
&quot;feel&quot; palpitations I am to push the button.  I can deal with palpitations not left <br/>
arm pain and burning!  That&#39;s ok I have a second opinion set up at the major <br/>
medical center they told me not to expect much from the docs here.<br/>
