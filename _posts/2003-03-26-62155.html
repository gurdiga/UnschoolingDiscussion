<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053243589">You know, &quot;thank you&quot; seems so understated when I try to express my <br/>
gratefulness for all the posts regarding TV lately.  I have a 5yod <br/>
who has loved tv from the time she was just an infant.  When <br/>
she was about 7 months old and in her jumpy-seat (you know, the ones <br/>
that attach to a doorway threshold) she would jump and spin like you <br/>
wouldn&#39;t believe to Barney&#39;s opening song, and she would watch it the <br/>
whole way through.  <br/>
<br/>
To try to make this long story short, I started feeling like I should <br/>
limit her tv viewing because she would sit and watch it for hours, <br/>
even as a 1yo.  (And I was always beside her watching it also, <br/>
singing along...I think I am the only mom I know who really actually <br/>
loved the Teletubbies...my husband and I would even watch it on <br/>
Friday nights after she had gone to bed...boy, did I just admit <br/>
that?)  Anyway, I would go through periods of limiting, and for one <br/>
reason or another, I would slack off and she would be watching it <br/>
more and more.  Then I would get concerned again and step back in <br/>
with my restrictions.  But as many of you have pointed out, there was <br/>
no way for her to know if she was going to be able to watch what she <br/>
wanted today, or if mom was going to tell her she needed to turn it <br/>
off, so she just watched and watched and watched...<br/>
<br/>
Then two things happened that slapped me in the face about it.  One <br/>
night, my mom and dad took her to visit her great-grandparents, and <br/>
on the way she asked a question that would make any grandparent sit <br/>
up and listen:  &quot;Do you know what the worst thing that my parents do <br/>
is?&quot;  Let me tell you, they were about to jump out of their seats <br/>
waiting to hear the answer to that one.  Then she sadly said, &quot;Every <br/>
night after I go to bed, they watch tv ALL night.&quot;  When I heard this <br/>
story I first thought, well if that is the worst we do, we aren&#39;t <br/>
doing too bad.  But then it set in how hypocritical I was being, and <br/>
hypocrisy is the one thing that I despise the MOST in the world.<br/>
<br/>
So I started letting her watch more tv.  But I still was trying to <br/>
impose on what she could and couldn&#39;t watch.  I kept &quot;encouraging&quot; <br/>
her to watch things like Dora and Liberty Kids because she <br/>
could &quot;learn&quot; from them.  Finally, she had had enough one day and she <br/>
just looked at me with sad eyes and said, &quot;Well I think I am just <br/>
fine the way I am, with what I know and what I don&#39;t know.&quot;  <br/>
Hmmm...And you know what, she is right.  She is an extremely smart <br/>
little girl, and I wasn&#39;t giving her the credit she deserved.  Shame <br/>
on me.<br/>
<br/>
So I am proud to say that the tv has been on almost continually for <br/>
the last couple of weeks, and yes, she has been a couch potato, but <br/>
she is so happy!  She comes to me and says, &quot;Mommy, I do learn stuff <br/>
from the Goofy movie.  I learn how not to act, like the boys on the <br/>
other skateboard team.  That is rude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I think it is good for her to see kids acting rudely on <br/>
tv, because she CAN be a passive viewer and see how acting that way <br/>
affects the other person.  If she were IN the situation, it would be <br/>
MUCH harder to separate how something she or her friends were doing <br/>
that might be hurtful to another child.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as ads, I too was worried about the constant bombardment <br/>
of toys and such.  But as I was watching with her one day, I noticed <br/>
how there must have been at least 25 commercials during that period <br/>
(maybe more) and only once did she say, &quot;Hey mom, that&#39;s cool!  Can I <br/>
have that?&quot;  So yes, I believe it does expose them to all kinds <br/>
of &quot;neat&quot; things, but I also believe they have the ability to discern <br/>
which of those things really appeal to them.  (Plus it helps me with <br/>
her birthday list for next month!)  And I always think it funny how <br/>
she mutes the tv when the Hooked on Phonics commercial comes on (over <br/>
and over and over again.)  It drives her nuts.  But this has led to <br/>
great conversations regarding marketing and target audiences and such.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, thanks for all the posts (and thanks for reading this <br/>
novel to the end.)  Everything finally feels right.  <br/>
