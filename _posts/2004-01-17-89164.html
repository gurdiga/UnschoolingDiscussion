<div id="ygrps-yiv-1182031295">&quot;Why do males all like power tools?  lol&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think people in general like power tools! I do anyway.<br/>
Our society has made little girls intimidated by items like that (in the past, still evident though) but I think most people are pretty drawn to a machine that can turn a piece of wood into a useful, interesting item. Or the way a reciprocal saw can demolish most anything...that&#39;s cool stuff!!<br/>
