 Has anyone cautioned you about reading the 4th book before you read it to<br/>
 your son?  It was, IMO, much darker than the previous books and it scared my<br/>
 10 year old a LOT.  She had to ask me to stop for a couple of nights.  Just<br/>
 thought I would mention this.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know my kids read the Harry Potter books aloud and loved all four books. <br/>
But I must say that with the 4th book my 10 yr. old lost interest and stopped <br/>
listening. He never mentioned it scaring him but maybe that was part of it. <br/>
My then 16, 14, and 12 yr. olds loved it though. As the Harry Potter books go <br/>
on they seem to be for an older audience.<br/>

<div><tt>I guess this is where you have to know your kids... my then-8yo loved 
#4 and proclaimed it her favorite book of the series.&nbsp; She devoured it in 
about 3 days.&nbsp; We received #4 on tape for a Christmas present and she has 
listened to all 12 tapes at least twice now. And now she is so thrilled that she 
finally has found some friends who have read HP, too.&nbsp; None of the other 
homeschoolers she knows have read them (parents object to the books), but we 
have new neighbors who aren&#39;t homeschoolers whose kids are as wild about Harry 
as she is and who spend countless hours acting out HP stories with 
her.</tt></div>

 </span></blockquote>Check your library.  We got them from ours once.  Mine do not quite have an <br/>
interest in Harry yet, but I have read all 4.  The tapes are really good <br/>
too if you can get your hands on them.  I know I had to wait to get them <br/>
from our library, but it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are looking to buy them, check ebay or half.com for some good <br/>
prices.<br/>
