<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826871016">We go out to a tree farm in early December each year and cut down our Yule tree....then, we have dinner at a little restaurant/ice cream shop in a small college town on the way home. After a few days, we put up the tree and the rest of our Yule decorations. Before Christmas, we escape to a very rural cabin in the woods for the week taking our Yule gifts with us to be opened on the winter solstice. The cabin has a tiny kitchen, several bedrooms and a living room with fireplace....there is no television but we bring a stereo for music. We even leave the computer at home &lt;G&gt;! We hike and play games and read and talk and enjoy the fact that we have left the hectic Christmas frenzy of others far behind. On Christmas day, we drive into a nearby village to have dinner at the local Chinese restaurant which is open because, like us, they don&#39;t celebrate Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
This tradition began for us when we got together years ago because my dh grew up jewish and I was raised catholic...we didn&#39;t want to celebrate both holidays and we didn&#39;t want to struggle about which far-away extended family we travelled to visit at a time of year that we didn&#39;t want to be travelling during anyway. Now, his family goes to the Carribean for the winter and mine visits us in January and we have a true holiday from stress.<br/>
