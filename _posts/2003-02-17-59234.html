&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; Kate<br/>
&gt;&gt; who&#39;s children are eating their ice cream and smearing it on themselves<br/>
&gt;&gt; while taking a bath. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When Holly was sick with a sore throat last month she was taking a bath when<br/>
&gt; I got home from the store.  I had bought juice and juice pops and push-ups<br/>
&gt; (sherbet in a tube), and I offered her a push-up while she was in the<br/>
&gt; bathtub.  She just lit up.   It&#39;s nice to make a happy moment with so little<br/>
&gt; effort.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ice cream in the bathtub (or the wading pool, weather permitting) was my<br/>
sanity-saver until the girls became reliable about not inadvertantly (or,<br/>
sigh, I admit, advertantly &lt;g&gt;) smearing the stuff on every possible<br/>
household surface.<br/>
<br/>
So every time I heard, &quot;Are there any push ups?&quot; and I&#39;d chirp, &quot;Sure! How<br/>
about I fill the bathtub up, too!?&quot; I *could* claim I was being cool, but I<br/>
was really just keeping the terror out of my voice at the thought of 2 year<br/>
old Mikey (native American name: Paints With Ice Cream) loose in the house<br/>
with a push-up. ;)<br/>
