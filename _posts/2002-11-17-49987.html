&lt;&lt; I think it would be interesting to study this question by putting<br/>
location detectors on parents and kids and tracking the distance between<br/>
them throughout the day and night.  Then the statistics could be<br/>
adjusted for age of kids and size of house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our house is 3600 square feet.  Holly is sitting one foot from me.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was hard asleep.  TOTALLY asleep.  Peacefully asleep.  And when <br/>
I&#39;m asleep, I don&#39;t have a broken leg.<br/>
<br/>
Holly woke me up saying, &quot;Can I practice my fiddle now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Does it have to be in here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You SAID I could!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah.  Did I mention it was 10:30?<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Can&#39;t you do it upstairs, or in the library, or in Keith&#39;s room?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dad&#39;s asleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I WAS ASLEEP TOO!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But you just now SAID I could!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Last I remember you and Keith  were watching Music Man and I was asleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just fifteen minutes ago I said I wanted to check my e-mail and then <br/>
practice, and you said okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well I must have talked in my sleep!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yelling and crying.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I was too awake to sleep again, and she was too upset to want to <br/>
practice.  But I was trying to go back to sleep.  And then she said &quot;Is it <br/>
okay if I watch Saturday Night Live in here?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She has a television in her room.  We had just had a screaming fight about my <br/>
need to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I said okay.  Because I felt so bad about yelling at her.  And I fell asleep <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Is that closeness?  In a location-tester way, absolutely! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
And she WANTED to be where I was. <br/>
I just wanted to be where my broken leg wasn&#39;t, which is really asleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674707099">Yes,,,we have had nights like that,    we just built and the house is about that size , we are now finding out that you really don&#39;t need several bedrooms--we all end up sleeping together,  we don&#39;t need several bathrooms--they all like the master bath.  And as far as the basement playroom..its much more fun to dance and sing where I am..,    <br/>
 <br/>
I think we need to downsize,,,,,maybe we&#39;ll like it when the kids are teenagers,  or the kids will like it anyway.<br/>
