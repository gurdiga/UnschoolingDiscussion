<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068449927">One of my earliest memories is cutting clay with a sharp paring knife.  I was in my high chair and my grandmother was sitting right by me.  I don&#39;t remember having cut myself.<br/>
<br/>
Jonathan (5 and fascinated with ANY blade) has been using sharp knives for over a year.  He has not cut himself yet.  My first instinct/knee-jerk reaction was to say no but couldn&#39;t justify it so I said yes with some requests.<br/>
<br/>
We have guidelines/rules/principles, ie; I have to be near him in case there is an accident.  Call them what you will, he and I talk about them and he knows they are something I insist on to keep him safe.  He understands why I ask for these things and doesn&#39;t seem to feel they are arbitrary.  I think of them as an agreement between a boy who knows I worry and a mom who tries to say no as little as possible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand completely.  That is how I would describe those kinds of <br/>
situations in our home too.    We don&#39;t have guns, so that is a non-issue.  We do <br/>
have knives, and all sorts of other things kids can get hurt with ( tools, <br/>
machinery, etc).  They can use them as long as there is an adult available to <br/>
supervise.   (when they are too young to manage them safely alone)     <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968353532">Jayn was almost three when she got hold of a small mat knife and was<br/>
pretending to pick a lock on the bedroom door. I don&#39;t know why she<br/>
wanted to play that particular game. We had talked about being careful<br/>
with scissors and sharp things before. I came upon her and was a little<br/>
alarmed about it, and said something about being very careful. She gave<br/>
me a withering look and said in a tone as if it were beyond obvious, &quot;I<br/>
am being careful&quot;. <br/>
