<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Given an unlimited<br/>
&gt; amount of money she&#39;s &quot;rescue&quot; every cat stuffed animal she came across. Not<br/>
&gt; to play with but to rescue from not being owned. (There&#39;s a big TV size box<br/>
&gt; overflowing with *just* cats and that&#39;s not counting the Beanies.) (And yes<br/>
&gt; she has real cats, 2 kittens, and we&#39;re fostering a mom and 5 kittens for<br/>
&gt; the shelter.) There&#39;s a Beanie Baby cat bought over the weekend that was<br/>
&gt; carried around for a day and now sits abandoned on my computer desk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If she were focused on one thing, that would be fine. There are 5 big boxes<br/>
&gt; of stuffed animals. (Lots of handmedowns, gifts, yard sales so not all full<br/>
&gt; priced.) Pokemon cards. Beanies. (I could go on.) She &quot;rescues&quot; pens run<br/>
&gt; over by cars. (She says she loves living next to the high school because you<br/>
&gt; can find so many pens! ;-) Rocks. Soda bottles. Bottle caps. (I could go on<br/>
&gt; with this too.) She is mildly interested in collecting, as in gathering<br/>
&gt; things together to admire their likenesses and differences, but right now<br/>
&gt; the primary drive is just to get stuff into the house and away from being<br/>
&gt; &quot;lost&quot; in the greater world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Probably a psychologist would have field day with this, thinking she was<br/>
&gt; playing out feelings of fear of abandonment or something. But I do<br/>
&gt; understand the feelings that prompt it because I had the same feelings as a<br/>
&gt; child, and well into adulthood. She personifies *everything*. Everything,<br/>
&gt; even rusty springs and perhaps even candy wrappers (that she won&#39;t throw<br/>
&gt; away but will allow me to though perhaps she feels a twinge ;-), has a soul<br/>
&gt; that needs someone to care for it. Which is really sweet! But expensive and<br/>
&gt; a storage nightmare ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She wants things she can interact with. Furbies, robots, Gigapets, video<br/>
&gt; games but very few of them come close to meeting the need she&#39;s trying to<br/>
&gt; meet. What she *really* wants is a holodeck ;-) And all the money in the<br/>
&gt; world spent on things that are sort of like that won&#39;t be satisfying.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, yes, she has friends. But what she needs from friends is fellow actors<br/>
&gt; in her fantasies. It&#39;s a rare kid who can fulfill that and she has only 4<br/>
&gt; who meet that and none are close by. There&#39;s one girl in town who plays<br/>
&gt; Pokemon and video games and they have loads of fun when they&#39;re playing and<br/>
&gt; she always declares she&#39;s going to play with her more often, but doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel like playing when I ask if she&#39;d like to call. And she doesn&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; why.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only thing that comes close to being satisfying are her imaginary<br/>
&gt; friends and writing and drawing comic books so it&#39;s fortunate her artistic<br/>
&gt; talent allows that to be as satisfying for her as it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So that&#39;s where we&#39;re coming from. I&#39;m usually too self-centered to see my<br/>
&gt; own situation clearly, and really can only understand me when I can tell<br/>
&gt; someone else where they&#39;re going wrong in the same situation ;-) Any ideas?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joyce, I have to tell you that your daughter sounds charming and wonderful!  <br/>
It sounds like the usual math pages, and things like that are too concrete <br/>
for this magical child. There must be ways of feeding into her rich fantasy <br/>
life to get math concepts, etc....I am not a mathematician, but maybe some of <br/>
the more advanced stuff would be more interesting to her than boring old <br/>
arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
Would your daughter enjoy some little faeries? I make these fun little <br/>
faeries, and would love to send her some.<br/>
<br/>
I have a twelve year old son who still plays with his tribes of Beanies, and <br/>
has 17 squirrels living in his curly hair. (Actually, right now, eleven of <br/>
them are just making it to base camp to prepare for a summit attempt on <br/>
Everest.) I have conversations with many of the squirrels, as does my <br/>
partner. There is much speaking in interesting voices in this house. Julian&#39;s <br/>
squirrels (also a badger, and a few others) are very real, and the magic of <br/>
Julian is that you can absolutely believe in the squirrels AND not question <br/>
his (or your own) sanity. The sanity of some of these animals is <br/>
questionable, however...there&#39;s a badger that thinks it&#39;s a squirrel, a <br/>
squirrel that thinks it&#39;s a pigeon...many of these poor critters seem to have <br/>
some sort of benign mental illness.<br/>
<br/>
Julian also is obsessed with rubber bands. He has a fantasy of someday <br/>
getting a job at Staples so he can enjoy the employee discount. It&#39;s an <br/>
interesting approach to collecting, because if we ever actually NEED a rubber <br/>
band he&#39;s quite generous with them. (If anyone has a plethora of rubber bands <br/>
in their home that they&#39;d like to get rid of, I know a kid who would be <br/>
ecstatic to receive them.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when I picture this kid in middle school, I sigh in relief that we <br/>
discovered homeschooling before it became an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, who figures that when you have one of these wierd kids it&#39;s best to <br/>
lighten up and go along for the ride.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792090421">Thanks for sharing this, y&#39;all. My Ansley talks to EVERYTHING. In fact,<br/>
the only time he isn&#39;t talking is when he&#39;s asleep. He&#39;s always trying<br/>
to pull me into his fantasy worlds. I think next time, I&#39;ll go...<br/>

For three months his left arm has been a dragon who must be politely<br/>
asked before performing any tasks.  &quot;Would you please help me brush my<br/>
hair?&quot;  <br/>
We often set the table for guests we never see and who are not human.  <br/>
He rescues everything, especially dryer sheets and six pack rings.<br/>
He has the richest, most colorful imagination of anyone I know and I<br/>
think he&#39;s perfect.<br/>

I agree with Kathryn, your daughter sounds charming!  <br/>
And your son too, Kathryn!  Squirrels!  I love this!<br/>
I think we&#39;re very lucky.<br/>
