<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212138078">I recently found some great info. on retaining a permit and license <br/>
for my 15 year old son on HSC web site.  But, does anyone else have <br/>
some recomendations concerning this?  We live in CA.  Can I get the <br/>
study material for his permit from them, or do I need to buy it on my <br/>
own?  Will the DMV only give this info out in May to our private <br/>
school? And why do I always hear about 30 hours required behind the <br/>
wheel before testing for a license, and on the web site they state <br/>
that all one needs is 6?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987817579">The six hours is training behind the wheel prior to a permit being issued.<br/>
A lot of folks use driving schools for that 6 hours behind the wheel.  THEN,<br/>
during the 6 months after they get the permit they have to do another 30<br/>
hours with their parents or an adult before they can get their actual<br/>
license.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385861797">Hi there, I dont think that I caught what state you are in....I am in Texas.  Here we have what they call Hardship licenses.  Kids can get them at 13 if they can pass the test and afford the insurance.  They have to prove a hordship...ill parent, of a parent that can not drive, or does not have a license.  I got one of these when I was 14..didn&#39;t have a car though:{  As far as the teaching goes, most of it you can teach them yourself, but for the book part, We can get a study book from the local DMV that is the same one I used in drivers-ed... I know this because I had to retake my test after 11 yrs of driveing, due to a suspended lisence, which was a joke too, and I failed!! I failed the stupid test...I did fine on all of the things that are relevant to driving, it was the drug and alchohle laws and &quot;minor&#39; laws(under 21)  I am was over 21 and I had no idea what the maximum fine was if you are am inor cought with alchohl while driving..While this is important, it is also real!<br/>
ly anal...So I failed the thing and they gave me a book, and inside were all of the answers!<br/>
Son&#39;t know if any of this helped,<br/>
