<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825378675">Hi ~<br/>
 I love  unschooling ...even though it&#39;s only been a few months. It has been <br/>
wonderful and I love the changes we have made to just &quot;living life&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I have a very small concern though &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
  My ds (7) is writing thank you notes for Christmas gifts .His handwriting <br/>
is horrible (compared to a few months ago).  He doesn&#39;t even care. <br/>
And he doesn&#39;t even want to TRY spelling any words at all ( even words that <br/>
he&#39;s known all along).  <br/>
  I have changed my ways , ( since unschooling) and have told him how to <br/>
spell something when he has asks, instead of making him sound it out.<br/>
And it seems he&#39;s lazy about it now.<br/>
  <br/>
  I feel that if people took the time and money to buy him a gift, he can at <br/>
least write something legible to show his appreciation.<br/>
  I know it is said that boys take longer to write well, but my son&#39;s <br/>
handwriting has been outstanding  even last year.<br/>
It seems it&#39;s more about attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Opinions welcome...as always :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565625007">I&#39;m a newbie, so hello and I hope I get the tone right :)<br/>
<br/>
In a non-TCS though fairly non-coercive childhood, one of the worst <br/>
chores of the year(for everyone, including both parents) was to write <br/>
thank you letters to relatives for the money they had sent at <br/>
Christmas time. One had to invent &#39;suitable&#39; things one wanted to do <br/>
with the money that would not offend the sensibilities of the noble <br/>
benefactors (!) and one had to present these thanks, together with <br/>
suitably edited highlights of the year&#39;s festivities (rudely <br/>
interrupted by writing of said letter), in legible handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
20-odd years later...<br/>
<br/>
I still go through this charade with the relevant (and now very <br/>
ancient) relatives. My younger brother, who hated writing these <br/>
letters and hated writing legibly even more, stopped writing thank <br/>
you letters. He no longer gets the Â£20 notes, but nor does he have <br/>
the ghastly chore to do.<br/>
<br/>
If attempts at finding an alternative non-coercive solution have <br/>
failed (would they not accept a phone call instead? How about if he <br/>
made them some fudge as a return gift? He could write a letter on the <br/>
computer and work out how to mail merge personal greetings to each <br/>
relative?) and your son thinks that lack of treasury notes is a small <br/>
price to pay for the FREEDOM of not having one&#39;s spelling and <br/>
handwriting scrutinised by elderly relatives who are more interested <br/>
in style than content, then that&#39;s his decision (and one I heartily <br/>
applaud)!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541882623">Hi Marcia - As far as his handwriting goes, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.<br/>
He might just be thrilled not to &#39;have&#39; to write a certain way.  I think<br/>
our handwriting develops into whatever it&#39;s going to be regardless of<br/>
how/if we&#39;re taught to do it a certain way. <br/>
 <br/>
Is his heart into the idea of sending a thank you?  If so, I&#39;d give him<br/>
some other options besides writing them - maybe a drawing of him with<br/>
his toy, or him with the gift-giver.  Maybe type it out on the computer<br/>
with him and he can sign it.  He could send a photo of himself with the<br/>
present, or just a picture of him with a word bubble saying &#39;thanks&#39;.<br/>
You guys are crafty - I&#39;m sure you can think of some other ideas :0).<br/>
 <br/>
If his heart&#39;s not in it, I don&#39;t see much point in &#39;making&#39; him say<br/>
thank you.  At times when my kids have not been interested in sending a<br/>
thank you note I have sent one myself.  I&#39;ve asked them if they&#39;d like<br/>
to sign it or decorate the envelope, but if they didn&#39;t want to that was<br/>
fine.  ~Rue<br/>

doesn&#39;t actually appreciate the gifts. Then you could talk about manners, <br/>
and if he still doesn&#39;t care, model them for him.<br/>

<br/>
You stated that it has only been a few months that you have been unschooling<br/>
so several things pop out to me that might explain what is going on with<br/>
your son.<br/>
<br/>
(1) Perhaps he was having to work harder than you were aware to have<br/>
outstanding handwriting at 7 yo and without &quot;constant&quot; practice his skills<br/>
slipped.  If this is the case, he will improve when his fine motor skills<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Perhaps your son doesn&#39;t trust that you won&#39;t MAKE him do things in a<br/>
particular way, so he is enjoying his freedom while he can.  If this is the<br/>
case, he will not improve at all as long as you have a &#39;thing&#39; about the<br/>
illegible writing of a 7yo.<br/>
<br/>
(3) Perhaps your son understands unschooling better than his mom &lt;grin&gt; and<br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel that thank you notes written nicely are a big deal.  In this<br/>
case, you might talk with him about how he feels about the person that sent<br/>
him the gift, how he feels receiving a gift, how he feels when people like<br/>
the gifts he has given.....Most importantly, ask him how HE would like to<br/>
express his gratitude to the person.  Perhaps he would like to draw them a<br/>
picture, or send them some cookies, or give them a big hug and tell them in<br/>
person next time he sees them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1013385780">My 18 yo son has the worst handwriting.  It doesn&#39;t matter though <br/>
because everthing he needs to write, he just does on computer- <br/>
especially his college papers. Poeple expect it and want it.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, he is very interested in alphabets both real and <br/>
fantasy; Hobbish, Elvish, Cyrillic.  He has a whole collection and <br/>
writes with them making each letter with care (except English).  His <br/>
love notes to his girl friend are always in Elvish. :-)<br/>
