  &gt;I consider that while they are IN school, there is no way they can be<br/>
  &gt;unschoolers. They can leave and go BACK to unschooling, but even if they are<br/>
  &gt;there for band or football, they still have rules, requirements and<br/>
  &gt;expectations that are the antithesis of unschooling. Zachary went back to<br/>
  &gt;school for whatever reasons. He is not CURRENTLY unschooling, but he could<br/>
  &gt;if he left school.<br/>

  About three hours drive from here is the Albany Free School. Its a <br/>
  wonderful place where kids of all ages mix together. There is no <br/>
  cirriculum. There are no classes unless a kid wants to learn something <br/>
  specific.<br/>
<br/>
  There are rules. One can&#39;t hit another kid without it going to a meeting <br/>
  on the consequences. One is not allowed to destroy another&#39;s creation, <br/>
  etc.<br/>
<br/>
  They are in all rights of New York State, a school.<br/>
<br/>
  The children there are prolly unschooled more than a good portions of <br/>
  children who stay at home to do the exact same thing.<br/>
<br/>
  Its whose AGENDA is being followed that determines the name of the game.<br/>
