&lt;&lt; Butting in here- what I gather from all of Sandra&#39;s posts is not that<br/>
she is arguing to be right, rather she is opening her mind to discuss<br/>

willing to bet Sandra would have been open to the possibility of WRONG. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The reason I&#39;m so often right is that I run my ideas and knowledge up against <br/>
other ideas and knowledge all the time, and if I find something better or <br/>
that seems more useable, workable or otherwise &quot;right,&quot; it becomes mine.  I&#39;m <br/>
learning from other people all the time.  Maybe that&#39;s why when it seems <br/>
someone has an unworkable or baseless idea I&#39;m surprised if they seem <br/>
unwilling to consider input from me or others about it.<br/>
<br/>
My husband taught me a cool thing, years ago.  I used to get really <br/>
frustrated when I was in my 20&#39;s when people would make what seemed <br/>
mysterious assumptions about my abilities or motives or something, and he <br/>
said, &quot;People assume that you are like they are.&quot;   I forget to recite that <br/>
to myself sometimes, but it has shown itself to be true over and over again, <br/>
and so it stays in the &#39;things I believe&#39; set.<br/>

<div>Let me preface this with a disclaimer.&nbsp; This is not a personal attack 
on anyone, it is a question of equity.&nbsp; The discussion in question really 
took off when a piece of gossip with racial undertones was used as an 
example.</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As to the balance, several sites have been given 
including one which clearly showed that another example used was still in the 
testing phase and that the latest research <font face="Times New Roman"
 size="3">(</font><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/fead6.htm"><font
 face="Times New Roman"
 size="3">http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/fead6.htm</font></a><font
 face="Times New Roman" size="3">) found &quot;the response was not statistically 
significant.&quot;</font><br></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Several of the responses have had nothing to do 
with the discussion simply a let&#39;s take sides sort of posts.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, here is my question (again which I expect to 
get no actual response to), why can an opinion/theory/gossip/urban 
legend&nbsp;(which is precisely what the statement about c-sections was) be 
stated without any references/bibliography/documentation and/or links, as were 
all&nbsp;the points of the original discussion.&nbsp; Then if someone disagrees 
with&nbsp;any of the&nbsp;points, even when they provide links and quotes from 
folks*** who lived through part of the span in history inwhich the subject of 
the discussion took place, do people persist in saying that no links or sources 
have been given.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The fact remains that bloodletting was deadly and 
that the current medical practices of bloodletting are discussing apples and 
oranges.&nbsp; Bloodletting does not cure hemorrages, it does not cure sore 
throats, it does not cure the plague and diseases aren&#39;t caused by humors and 
getting rid of the humors by perging, starving, vomitting and bloodletting are 
going to cure any of those diseases.&nbsp; Now, if someone can find me a site 
that says that the illnesses they were trying to cure by that method are now 
being cured by bloodletting, then we are talking apples to apples, oranges to 
oranges.&nbsp; The use of leeches NOW is not for bloodletting but rather for 
increasing blood flow.&nbsp; Again apples and oranges.&nbsp; The only thing that 
is used for the same reason now as it was then is maggots.&nbsp; Maggots were 
allowed to eat the dead flesh and they have been found to be an&nbsp;good 
resource and&nbsp;documented by the medical community&nbsp;resource 
for&nbsp;removing gangrene and narcrotic flesh.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore maggots comes under &quot;was o.k., then was 
yukky and unacceptable and now is o.k.&quot;&nbsp; Apples to apples.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Lynda</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">***I can&#39;t find the post with the comment about my 
spelling (please note that I have a slightly lopsided grin and a twinkle in my 
eye as I say this) of the gentleman&#39;s name.&nbsp; Yes he was the Frenchman and 
no he isn&#39;t someone new.&nbsp; I hold out my hands to the spelling police (again 
I am grinning here!) and throw myself on the mercy of the court.&nbsp; I plead 
being language-challenged due to a French teacher in 8th grade who was from 
Mexico, lived in East LA and spoke French with a Spanish/East LA accent.&nbsp; 
Being determined to learn French, I again took a class in 9th grade.&nbsp; New 
teacher.&nbsp; Yippee, a French teacher with a French name.&nbsp; ~~sigh~~&nbsp; 
Well, French parents who had immigrated to Ireland and then lived in the 
Bronx.&nbsp; I will leave to your immagination his accent.&nbsp; I am now able 
to read a little French but couldn&#39;t spell it or speak it if my life depended on 
it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, I for one will not be upset if someone corrects 
me if my French leaves a bit to be desired.&nbsp; O.K., so it leaves a whole lot 
to be desired &lt;g&gt;</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451677460">In a message dated 4/16/01 10:50:37 AM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lurine@...">lurine@...</a> writes:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So, here is my question (again which I expect to get no actual response <br/>
to) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is already challenging.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;why can an opinion/theory/gossip/urban legend (which is precisely what the <br/>
statement about c-sections was) be stated without any <br/>
references/bibliography/documentation and/or links, as were all the points of <br/>
the original discussion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The point of the original was that some ideas which are considered unworthy <br/>
of consideration, wacko, dangerous, racist, goofy, unscientific or wrong are <br/>
sometimes later found to have been not so crazy after all.  And some things <br/>
which are considered Good and Right are later found to have been not so good <br/>
and not so right.<br/>
<br/>
Antibiotics.<br/>
Milk being good for everyone.<br/>
Baby formula (i.e. evaporated milk and sugar) being as good as breast milk.<br/>
<br/>
It would not be racist to suggest that African Americans are more likely to <br/>
be lactose intolerant than northern Europeans.  It would be insanely <br/>
&quot;politically correct&quot; to treat everyone exactly the same, medically, <br/>
regardless of genetic liklihoods.  To test all of Iceland for sickle cell <br/>
anemia, or Mexico for Tay-Sachs would be a misuse of medical testing.  Would <br/>
it be racist to screen FIRST before checking only those with a possibility of <br/>
having the disease?  My friend Carol lost a baby from having amniocentesis to <br/>
check for Tay-Sachs or Epstein Barr or something which she could only have <br/>
had if she AND her husband were Eastern European Jews.  Her husband is Irish <br/>
Catholic.   They tested her anyway.  Someday amnio will be seen as a horror <br/>
foisted upon many women against their wills, but right now it&#39;s not.  The <br/>
doctor told her it was a one in a million chance that it was the amnio that <br/>
caused that miscarriage.  Let&#39;s see... the miscarriage started within about <br/>
20 hours of the amnio, and the statistics I&#39;ve seen are between 1 in 100 and <br/>
1 in 300 (180/200 are most quoted) on ANY amniocentesis causing loss of <br/>
pregnancy.  Those were the stats last I knew, when I was involved with <br/>
cesarean prevention.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes he was the Frenchman and no he isn&#39;t someone new. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But he wasn&#39;t a medical guy either.  We could quote Shakespeare for period <br/>
quotes, but as he was writing characters who aid all KINDS of things <br/>
Shakespeare himself didn&#39;t necessarily believe to be true, quoting <br/>
Shakespeare to prove some sort of point wouldn&#39;t work.  Same.  That&#39;s why I <br/>
was asking context.  Was it a letter to someone about medicine?  Or was it a <br/>
character in a play?  Or a political essay in which he was being figurative?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581731718">Epstein-Barr is a virus, blood tests are done for evidence of EPB<br/>
antibodies.  It can cause glandular fever in teens and is associated with<br/>
infectious mononucleosis and CFS.<br/>
<br/>
Tay-Sachs on the other hand is something they test for with an amnio.  It is<br/>
a genetic condition in which the body stores waste products in the cells or<br/>
tissues and the build up causes damage which results in the cell/tissues&#39;s<br/>
loss of ability to function properly.  There are a whole family of these<br/>
diseases known as the NTSAD family and sometimes when doctors are testing<br/>
for something in that family, the only one that people pick up on from the<br/>
list is the Tay-Sachs because that one they&#39;ve heard of.  I mean, how many<br/>
folks have heard of  Fabry, Gaucher, Niemann-Pick, Canavan, Sandhoff,<br/>
Krabbe, Wolman, Hurler or for that matter, Asparylglucosaminuria and that&#39;s<br/>
the short list.<br/>
<br/>
As to genetics and it taking both, that only applies to the child having the<br/>
active disease, not to the child being a carrier.  The woman could very<br/>
easily have the disease or carry the disease, her husband would not be a<br/>
factor in that.  And, being Catholic has absolutely nothing to do with<br/>
whether or not one could be a carrier.  To be a Jew is to be from an ethnic<br/>
group and does not mean that one is Jewish in religion.  Where one is from<br/>
does not guarantee that is what one&#39;s complete ancestry is either.  A real<br/>
good example of that is a group of Africans who have the same genetic coding<br/>
(Jewish Y-chromosome, not the European or African Y-chromosome) as a certain<br/>
sect of Jewish rabbis.  As long as blood testing and genetic testing has<br/>
been around it was thought and then tested for and only this one group of<br/>
rabbis was found to have this one specific variant of the Jewish<br/>
Y-chromosome.  Now a very small population of Africans have been found that<br/>
not only have practiced a form of Judiasm for hundreds of years but have<br/>
this specific Jewish Y-chromosome.<br/>
<br/>
While amnios are done as a relatively safe procedure, orders for them aren&#39;t<br/>
handed out like the ones for ultrasounds.  Knowing the age of the woman<br/>
would have some bearing on this discussion, however we don&#39;t have that.<br/>
<br/>
It is common knowledge that anyone suffering a loss, be it miscarriage or<br/>
any other type of loss, looks for a reason and frequently looks for an<br/>
outside force to blame.  The amnio is an easy target.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good example of why everyone should take forms home and read them<br/>
carefully before signing them.  The amnio consent forms are suppose to list<br/>
all the possible side effects and the possibility of miscarriage.  She<br/>
should also have been given discharge orders which detailed what she should<br/>
be doing, what she should look for and what she should do it she had any<br/>
symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
Since none of us have first hand knowledge of what her doctor did, we&#39;ll<br/>
never know if he did completely inform her and this is simply the result of<br/>
grief induced tramatic hysteria where everything is exaggerated or if he<br/>
should be slapped with a malpractice suit.  We also don&#39;t really know if she<br/>
had an amnio or CVS, whether it was before 14 weeks (more risky, 5-7% chance<br/>
of miscarriage) or after 14 weeks (1% chance of miscarriage).  Lots of<br/>
unknowns.<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;Someday amnio will be seen as a horror foisted upon many women<br/>
against their wills&quot;  I doubt that it will as it has saved far too many<br/>
lives that would not have been saved without the knowledge gained with its<br/>
use.  And, as Robin stated, it is hardly against their will, it is a choice<br/>
and it is also their choice not to make it an informed one.<br/>

counted in the miscarraige risk...  and there are doctors out there <br/>
who take an ultrasound, then trust that the baby hasn&#39;t moved <br/>
since, and do the amnio up to half an hour later (saw this on a <br/>
documentary before anyone shouts &#39;references!!&#39;)  instead of doing <br/>
a &#39;live&#39; ultrasound while they&#39;re doing the amnio...  on the <br/>
programme there were babies where you could visibly see the <br/>
damage done, one in a leg and another in the brain.  Not only <br/>
unnecessary, but much worse than Downs Syndrome would have <br/>
been.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re probably much safer in the hands of someone competent, <br/>
including miscarriage rates (because of this type of malpractice.)<br/>

I do.  She was over 35.   And it wasn&#39;t a discussion.  It was an example.  A <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is common knowledge that anyone suffering a loss, be it miscarriage or<br/>

<br/>
If 1 in 200 is ADMITTEDLY (even by mainstream stats) causing &quot;a loss&quot; then <br/>
it&#39;s not just an easy target---if one in 200 people who got in a car, or ate <br/>
a banana, DIED, cars and bananas would be illegal.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Since none of us have first hand knowledge of what her doctor did, we&#39;ll<br/>
never know if he did completely inform her and this is simply the result of<br/>

<br/>
I was getting the play by play two or three times a day during the week that <br/>
this happened, and during, and after the miscarriage.  How about you drop it, <br/>
because I&#39;m getting really grumpy now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As to &quot;Someday amnio will be seen as a horror foisted upon many women<br/>
against their wills&quot;  I doubt that it will as it has saved far too many<br/>

and it is also their choice not to make it an informed one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I stand by my statement.  There are tons of problems.  When Marty was born <br/>
the woman in the room with me had decided NOT to abort her Down Syndrome baby <br/>
even though the geneticist and nurses and doctor had all pressured her to.  <br/>
The baby was NOT Down Syndrome.  Had she aborted when they advised her to, I <br/>
don&#39;t think they would have said &quot;oops&quot; to her in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Women getting amnios are the test cases.  They see the test results, the get <br/>
the pathology on the abortions, they don&#39;t report that stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Another woman in town was told &quot;girl&quot; for sure, and got all girl stuff, <br/>
decorated girl style, had a boy.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not reliable, not safe, and not being honestly recorded (Carol&#39;s <br/>
didn&#39;t go on stats; the doctor denied the relationship) why are they still <br/>
being done? <br/>
<br/>
