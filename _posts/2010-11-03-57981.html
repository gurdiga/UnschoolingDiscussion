<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966958698">I haven&#39;t had much luck hearing back from Amazon sellers who have the Zoombinis games for sale, and it seems like they all may be for older operating systems.  Does anyone know which, if any, are compatible with mac&#39;s running OSX?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977561394">Zoombinis version 2 works on our Mac.  Holly&#39;s not where I am or I  <br/>
would ask her to review how well it worked.  You need to have the game  <br/>
uploaded AND put the disk in each time.  I have the computer with me,  <br/>
but the disk is back home.  But the icon says Zoombinis I V2<br/>
<br/>
Our old copy didn&#39;t work anymore after Mac 10 came along.<br/>
