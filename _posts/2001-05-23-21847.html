Does anyone here know about medical treatment of elderly patients?  I don&#39;t <br/>
mean the actual medicine part but the rude, condescending, waste her time <br/>
because she&#39;s old, who cares if we ever cure this because what&#39;s she possibly <br/>
doing in her life that&#39;s important anyway, part??  <br/>
<br/>
We just went through/are going thru some of this with a medical situation my <br/>
Mom is dealing with and I would appreciate any insights or hints on websites <br/>
to check for elderly medical patients&#39; rights&gt;&gt;<br/>

 Most hospitals have Patients&#39; Bill of Rights.  My mother spent a lot of time in medical institutions before she died, and I was appalled at how she was addressed by people almost young enough to be MY child.<br/>
So we became her advocates--many health care centers also have patient advocates.  If you want, you can email me privately and I can tell you more. btw--one of my former paid professional jobs was as an advocate in a hospital.<br/>
