<div id="ygrps-yiv-580358770">That&#39;s really cool!  We&#39;ve always enjoyed the holograms at our Science<br/>
Centre.  Thanks for passing it along.  I&#39;ve put it on my growing list of<br/>
cool things to get for Christmas.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
Oh!  yeah, rings look pretty in it.  I can see how someone would&#39;ve thought <br/>
it more suited to a ring of power than a pink pig. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve experimented with lots of little things, and some are too hard and <br/>
might scratch the surface, but this is SO fun that I told the kids not to worry.  <br/>
If this one gets too messed up we can get another someday.    If the thing is <br/>
any bigger than about 1&quot; square, it distorts.  And that&#39;s fun to experiment <br/>
with too, with HOW it distorts.<br/>
