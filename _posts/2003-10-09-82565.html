<div id="ygrps-yiv-484898305">Ok, I have a question.  IÂ’ve always been interested in this method.  But<br/>
never read the book.  I guess I thought it would be beyond my reach.  Tell<br/>
me some of the subtle cues you look for and ways you deal with their<br/>
elimination in the bed at night and in the car.  How often do the go at<br/>
night?  And how often do you pull the car over?  Oh, and how often do you<br/>
miss their cues?<br/>
