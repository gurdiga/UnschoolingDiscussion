&lt;&lt;  Gee, could this be because<br/>
 children enrolled in school and numerous activities rarely see their<br/>
 parents?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    My son and I had a conversation about school today, he does not miss <br/>
school but misses his friends. He says he would go  back for that reason but <br/>
I wonder.  I think it&#39;s just that he hasn&#39;t been around them for a while the <br/>
memory appears brighter than the friendships actually were. I wish he could <br/>
relate it to the experience he had with some kids from another neighborhood <br/>
this summer. They were/are his friends but he was able to see just how far <br/>
friendship goes at times. He will again someday play with the boys across the <br/>
way but he will be a little more cautious. Right now the tried and true <br/>
friends he has around the corner appear a bit boring. Why do we always want <br/>
that which we cannot have?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253185731">I have one very extroverted daughter and make a point to arrange time for<br/>
her with friends, especially her homeschooled friends.  Then I remind her<br/>
that if she were in school she couldn&#39;t have a friend over to play all<br/>
day long.  <br/>

Thanks.  I needed that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983054147">Last night while waiting for a movie, we ended up watching part of George <br/>
Carlin. We all know that he has a truly different perspective on life, and we <br/>
(dh and I) caught the part about children. <br/>
    He was saying that today&#39;s children are overstimulated, and that they <br/>
have lost most their sense of family in the process. He said that while <br/>
rushing Johnny from school to soccer to boy scouts, and then home to bed, day <br/>
in and day out, has become the norm. It is not good for the children. <br/>
    (Please note, I am not quoting Mr. Carlin. 2 reasons...He &quot;colors&quot; his <br/>
vocab, and it was well after midnight. I just wanted to stay up to start <br/>
taping a movie.) <br/>
    Children today become desensitized to the world around them. This is part <br/>
of the reason that I chose to homeschool. <br/>
    We do boy - and girl - scouts, but in our home. We have a one on one <br/>
program that will incorporate homeschooling right into both! Other than that, <br/>
ds will play soccer, but we will not spend the day rushing and losing that <br/>
family sense. <br/>
    Just my 2 cents... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994629257">Hooray for you!   I know for me,  we work to not overschedule our children,<br/>
and educating them from home helps tremendously!  It&#39;s sometimes tough when<br/>
many neighbors think your crazy and depriving your children of opportunities<br/>
and other such bunk.<br/>
I support you in giving your children the gift of childhood!<br/>
