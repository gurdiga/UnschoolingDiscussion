<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873360056">The other day someone close asked me &quot;what if the kids do not fit in&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
So I said well that is a good question but I really do not feel that the<br/>
purpose of life is to &quot;fit in&quot;. So then this person asked &quot;what about low<br/>
self esteem that comes from not having specific goals and a structured<br/>
education.?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I said low self esteem comes from not being respected by parents, for<br/>
wanting to follow one&#39;s own heart and that self esteem has nothing to do<br/>
with structured education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then the next question was &quot;what about growing up and making money which is<br/>
a must?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I said &quot;yeah what about it?&quot; However since this persons matters I had to<br/>
explain how looking at life from the experience of the moment in the present<br/>
is what matters.<br/>
<br/>
Then a certain line from Sandra&#39;s book Moving a Puddle came to my mind &quot;<br/>
everything counts&quot; and that  she mentions in one of the essays how it is<br/>
important to watch the children be a poet, artists, musician... for the<br/>
moment  and not for future careers.<br/>
<br/>
My son Ishaan will turn 5 next month and he always tells a story while<br/>
drawing. So he draws a ship, then he draws a dragon who is breathing fire,<br/>
then a castle, some whales, the sea, cannons and guns, pirates all of it on<br/>
a single large sheet. Saw I see not &#39;how well he is drawing&quot; but &quot;wow he is<br/>
like a graphic artist and a story teller for that moment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now till recently he would sketch only a sailing ship or a dragon or a train<br/>
or a submarine. But all separately. But now all that is on the same space<br/>
and with a story woven around the drawings......I feel that is pretty<br/>
cool.....<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 9 and one day she is a office assistant, another day she puts<br/>
up shop signs on her door indicating that she is a designer selling clothes,<br/>
some day she is a beautician and a hair dresser. Sometimes she watches dance<br/>
shows on TV and dances along trying very earnestly to copy the steps.<br/>
Sometimes she spends whole day surfing You Tube for music videos, or plays<br/>
dress up and make over games on the net. And that is cool.<br/>
<br/>
So I tell this person watch the children with eyes and heart that are in the<br/>
present moment and not with binoculars that are always looking at some<br/>
unknown distant future.......<br/>
<br/>
Then this person says well they have fixed ideas and ask questions. So I<br/>
said &quot;no they do not have fixed ideas, they simply have questions which need<br/>
answering. It is the adult who has the fixed ideas and is being<br/>
judgmental.....and that is why the resistance from within to answer those<br/>
questions.....&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Many parents do overlook their own child in 2011 (or whenever) trying to squint at 2021, and imagining a 2021 based on 1991.   It&#39;s just totally chaos and the child wonders what the parent might be looking at or thinking about.   They THINK they&#39;re thinking about their child, but they&#39;re ignoring him, in that moment.<br/>

<br/>
I find that an interesting place to explore.  It&#39;s neat to discuss what people generally believe, what I&#39;ve observed, what I haven&#39;t observed.  <br/>

You just sealed it for me Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
You have limited scope of what is &#39;make believe&#39;, what is &#39;magic&#39; and what,<br/>
to you, &#39;is or is not&#39;. Great for you. But who made you an authority on such<br/>
a topic? You&#39;re an influence in unschooling. To some an authority. But<br/>
there&#39;s a big world out there, and just because YOU have not interacted with<br/>
a gnome, or a fey, or whatever doesn&#39;t mean it does not exist nor does it<br/>
not have a place in another families scope of unschooling. I&#39;m understanding<br/>
here that this is a lifestyle. If I choose to unschool, I will not be<br/>
extracting my belief, from experience, of creatures such as this in the<br/>
lives my my children. They are free to choose what to believe... and<br/>
sometimes it actually  does take the experience to believe... but I digress.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these things have no place in your world, but they have a place in<br/>
other peoples worlds. Especially those who have seen into a different realm<br/>
and know, beyond a doubt, that these things exist.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not the place for such a discussion, but I cannot stay on a<br/>
list where someone so nastily smacks down another mothers loving way of<br/>
interacting with her child. Julie... Yes, how can we possibly know what a<br/>
gnome is up to when we aren&#39;t watching. And Sandra - I doubt she was talking<br/>
about garden statuary as you so snidely commented.<br/>
<br/>
I think I can explore unschooling elsewhere. Maybe a gnome will leave a<br/>
webpage open when I&#39;m not looking. Or drop a book onto my path. Scoff if you<br/>
like. That&#39;s fine. I won&#39;t be on the list to see it, respond, or even care.<br/>

know.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The most correct answer cannot be &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; One could simply lead the<br/>
child to some resources, like internet, CDs, stories, pictures, books. More<br/>
appropriate and definitely the right approach would be to say &quot;I have never<br/>
thought about this earlier but hey wow let us see if we can find an answer<br/>
to that question.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is true that I do not have all the answers but by saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;<br/>
one  has simply closed shut a door to some fascinating interaction with<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Gnomes. Santa Claus, Fairies, Dwarfs or immortality is not the issue out<br/>
here. The crux is to encourage and feed the inquiring mind.<br/>
<br/>
Gourika my 9 year old often asks esoteric and spiritual questions. It is my<br/>
privilege to always try and encourage that train of thought.<br/>
<br/>
Ishaan used to ask a lot about Dragons. So instead of saying &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;,<br/>
we just went into resources. Pictures, myths, stories, movies, books,<br/>
drawings etc. And today he has figured out on his own that Dragons are<br/>
&#39;mythical&#39; creatures....But boy oh boy what all we learnt on the way has<br/>
been truly amazing.<br/>
<br/>
He learnt about China, Japan, Scotland, England. About Knights and swords<br/>
and legends.<br/>
<br/>
You surely need to re-think this &quot;i don&#39;t Know&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Correct answer? As in &quot;this will be on the test&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Its worth thinking about why you want a single correct answer, like that. More than that, its worth thinking about why your child is asking you a question in the first place. Doling out single, correct answers, including &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; can shut down conversation and erode a relationship. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an idea that some parents have that a sense of wonder is something that needs to be promoted and encouraged - and that can turn into a kind of closet curriculum for parents, as if children can be taught to wonder by being given vague answers, regardless of what the child is looking for. In that sense &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; can become as dogmatic as &quot;this is The Truth&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Trust that your kids already have a sense of wonder and excitement about the world. You don&#39;t need to push it along! And you don&#39;t need to define it in your own terms. Maybe its exciting *to you* to wonder at the potential for beyond the rainbow, but your child isn&#39;t you - he may rather wonder at the physics of refraction itself and find all the stuff about magic misses the beautiful paradox of the photon. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The world gets bigger and bigger, more and more open.  I was taught in fact and limits, and now each question reveals an assumption with a jello-like foundation.  Fun to explore.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
Fun for you. Maybe fun for your child - but that&#39;s the question, isn&#39;t it. Are you letting your own ideas about what&#39;s important get in the way of what your child would rather explore? Are you letting your closet-curriculum of mysteries get in the way of someone looking for data?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be one thing or another, fact Or fiction - and maybe that&#39;s what Julie means. Recently Mo and I have been reading a fantasy series about dragon riders set in a facsimilie of ancient Egypt. As a result of that, she&#39;s been curious about real Egypt, so we&#39;ve been looking through books and websites and talking about what&#39;s known and not-known, about archeology and history, alphabets and customs... and in the last couple weeks about politics and democracy since Egypt has been in the news in exciting ways. So learning is swirling around, in and out of fact and fiction and the gray area that is &quot;history&quot; - and there&#39;s a Lot of that gray area in Egypt! There&#39;s a lot of &quot;no-one really knows for sure, but...&quot;. A lot of wondering to be done. And, at the same time, there&#39;s a chance to see how wondering fades into true fiction. I&#39;m not pretending that maybe there used to be dragons in Egypt - but knowing that part is pretend doesn&#39;t make the stories less fun, or the people we&#39;re reading about less wonderful. It doesn&#39;t automatically make the world smaller to say a fantasy isn&#39;t real - it can make our human capacity for imagining all the more miraculous. <br/>

Our conversations and activities don&#39;t end in &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I don&#39;t need him to have a particular quotient of wonder on display.  I do enjoy talking with him, especially because his questions often cause me to stop, ponder, reframe, and recognize my assumptions. <br/>
<br/>
I have been enjoying realizing the wiggly nature of the word &quot;know,&quot; exploring what it means to know.  This certainly affects my interactions with others, but I do not recommend an I Don&#39;t Know Curriculum of Wonder and Delight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291247175"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Trust that your kids already have a sense of wonder and excitement about the world. You don&#39;t need to push it along! And you don&#39;t need to define it in your own terms. Maybe its exciting *to you* to wonder at the potential for beyond the rainbow, but your child isn&#39;t you - he may rather wonder at the physics of refraction itself and find all the stuff about magic misses the beautiful paradox of the photon.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s that. And there&#39;s also the experience that many parents have<br/>
by the time a child gets older and outgrows the Magic Only world of<br/>
very young childhood (maybe never delves that deeply into magical<br/>
thinking even as a toddler). What if the child says things similar to<br/>
what Sandra just said as well as other things. --That&#39;s not real! or<br/>
that&#39;s a crushing dead bore.. ugh.--<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone has the same interests, including parents and their<br/>
children. I had many interests that my parents didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t<br/>
like. They have interests I don&#39;t have. We share some interests, like<br/>
astronomy and biology but then our differing interests take us down<br/>
separate paths even within those shared interests.<br/>
<br/>
And we veer away from sharing interests when disagreements are taken<br/>
as personal affronts and rejection. Children aren&#39;t trying to offend<br/>
their parents by having different interests and many of those<br/>
interests may stay under the radar as a result of trying not to<br/>
offend.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the kind of thing that stops the learning from happening.<br/>
Because if a parent can&#39;t go there with their child, then their child<br/>
can&#39;t go there.<br/>

That doesn&#39;t seem right.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you&#39;re talking about really young children, children can have lots of interests their parents don&#39;t share.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about relationships and trust, though.  If a parent isn&#39;t trustworthy, and if a parent isn&#39;t being a partner and a guide to help a child become more at home in the real world, unschooling won&#39;t work as well as otherwise.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t mean in terms of personally taking up those interests but<br/>
discouraging them and not listening ---then it might be very hard for<br/>
the children to get the resources in order to go after their<br/>
interests. In my case, it was a matter of waiting until I could do<br/>
things for myself as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they can find their own way in spite of a parent being turned<br/>
off to what they&#39;re interested in. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what<br/>
unschooling ideally does though. The idea is to at least be alert for<br/>
new interests in the first place. And to expect a certain amount of<br/>
curiosity about things the parent has little or no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
For instance if a child is interested in blackholes and the parent<br/>
doesn&#39;t believe in blackholes, there&#39;s some way for the child to look<br/>
at the idea and decide some things about blackholes rather than being<br/>
pushed off from looking at the idea themselves. If a parent doesn&#39;t<br/>
think the child is talking about blackholes, like Meredith described a<br/>
child wanting to know about how light works ... but maybe the parent<br/>
is onto something else they prefer instead of being open to the child.<br/>

I also know for a fact that gnomes are not real and I would never tell my child otherwise. However, I would not dissuade him from creative play in which he has gnomes doing things.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994519469">***It doesn&#39;t have to be one thing or another, fact Or fiction - and maybe <br/>
that&#39;s what Julie means. Recently Mo and I have been reading a fantasy series <br/>
about dragon riders set in a facsimilie of ancient Egypt. As a result of that, <br/>
she&#39;s been curious about real Egypt, so we&#39;ve been looking through books and <br/>
websites and talking about what&#39;s known and not-known, about archeology and <br/>
history, alphabets and customs...***<br/>
<br/>
Margaux is a huge HUGE Xena Warrior Princess fan!  She&#39;s seen all the episodes <br/>
many times over.  At one point she asked if giants were real, or if cyclops were <br/>
real.  Other than giants, like really big people like Andre the Giant, I wasn&#39;t <br/>
sure where the idea of giants came from so I looked it up.  I found some <br/>
fascinating and compelling arguments that suggested that for real giants <br/>
existed, like Goliath from the biblical stories.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true and <br/>
neither does Margaux.  It&#39;s something someone somewhere thought believable and <br/>
researched and compiled information about online.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux neither came away fully believing in giants, nor completely <br/>
disbelieving.  She found exactly what I found, that some people believe they <br/>
existed in the past and why they believe it.  If a real giant existed in the <br/>
here and now, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d be in a movie or a PBS documentary, or <br/>
possibly making mayhem for some of us small people!<br/>

I agree learning shouldn&#39;t be about filling a child with facts. It&#39;s  <br/>
not about memorizing the right answers.<br/>
<br/>
And parents shouldn&#39;t be afraid to say &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; to a child&#39;s  <br/>
question. But the follow up to that is offering to look it up. Either  <br/>
together or you can do it and bring back the answer. Or do it later  <br/>
when you get the chance.<br/>
<br/>
Again, &quot;What does the child want?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This child. This time. The answer to that question won&#39;t always be the  <br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>

You&#39;re defining &quot;know&quot; too narrowly and it might get in between you  <br/>

A more fanciful answer might be &quot;It&#39;s fun to imagine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, always, what does the child want to know? Typing in &quot;Santa&quot; into  <br/>

<br/>
Garden gnomes are real, but they&#39;re not going to come to life.<br/>
IF there are &quot;real gnomes&quot; they&#39;re already alive.<br/>
Those garden figurines people steal and take on vacation for photo opportunities are not gnomes really.  They are garden decorations.<br/>
<br/>
Just as with video games, the phenomena of children knowing something is fantasy and moms thinking (or claiming to think) that it&#39;s &quot;violence&quot; or whatever, there can be flaws in the mother&#39;s lack of clarity of thought and direct observation. <br/>
<br/>
For unschooling to remain strong and valid, moms need to try to be the adult in the sense that they not let their own imagination carry the parent/child team into places that are no longer &quot;educational&quot; or logical or realistic.  Being playful is great.  Claiming or wishing to disregard reality is not nearly as great.<br/>

<br/>
When I was little I liked thinking my stuffed animals came alive at night or when I wasn&#39;t there.    The real, live cats sometimes didn&#39;t want to snuggle, so having a toy cat that snuggled anytime I wanted was great!   But thinking it also had some other more interesting, fulfilling life was nice too. &lt;g.&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to check with anyone to confirm or deny my idea.   I was happy to think what I wanted.  <br/>
<br/>
I think most children don&#39;t need adult validation of their fantasy play.  Playing along with kids can be sweet and fun.   But when a child asks a question of someone he trusts he should get a reasoned answer.    <br/>
<br/>
For one thing, gnomes are scary.  If kid was asking because he was nervous that the creepy little thing might sneak into his room at night and eat him, it&#39;d be nicer for his mom to tell him the truth.  <br/>
<br/>
For another, fun and fantasy play can still happen when parents are truthful and honesty.  But as Sandra pointed out a parents reliability and credibility is not going to last long if she can&#39;t tell the truth. <br/>
<br/>
It is a fact that a garden gnome cannot come to life.  Neither can a bird bath or a fence post.  Why not say so, if asked?   <br/>
<br/>
I know there are people who think that if a thing can&#39;t be entirely disproved there is some possibility, however small, that it might be true.  They&#39;re agnostic about gnomes.     But there are such things as reason and probability.    <br/>

<br/>
When I was in India, a girl asked me about zombies.  She was in the 9/10 yr old range, give or take.  There was a disconnect in the conversation for a while.  I was answering from the movie and literature version of zombies.  She was thinking maybe they were actually walking around in the US, but not in India.  I&#39;m really glad I figured that out.  I told her what I knew off the top of my head (and briefly) about a belief that at one time over 100 years ago, there was some sort of voodoo drug that would make people seem dead but still be alive, or that could be used to enslave people, but I thought even that might not be really true, and the other stories had grown from that.    She was visibly relieved that it was an element of fantasy story-telling and movie-making.<br/>
<br/>
Someone made a list of qualifying statements in this thread (I looked but didn&#39;t find it), like &quot;People believe...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Kirby asked, when he was young, who was the first person on this planet.  I said &quot;Some people say...&quot; and gave him the 25 word version of Adam and Eve, and &quot;some people say we gradually evolved from monkeys&quot; and briefly described that. He was too young for the differentiation between monkeys and apes.    I said monkeys but we don&#39;t need to discuss that now 20+ years later.   <br/>
<br/>
He immediately asked which one I thought was right, and I said I used to believe one and now I believed the other.<br/>
<br/>
Without time for me to breathe or think, he asked which one I thought now.<br/>
<br/>
Had he been older, I probably would&#39;ve gone into a variety of creation myths.  Had google been around, I probably would have.  But I told him people have lots of old stories to try to explain things they don&#39;t know, and that scientists kept finding evidence of pre-historic people.  That was enough for him.<br/>
<br/>
Adam and Eve are real and not fantasy, because they&#39;re a concept that&#39;s been written about, painted, sculpted, analyzed and employed to inspire and shame.  Some people believe they&#39;re as real as anyone&#39;s dead ancestors might have been.<br/>
<br/>
My best example for the meaning of &quot;real&quot; is people asking whether the swords people use for SCA combat &quot;are real.&quot;   They&#39;re not imaginary.  People aren&#39;t hitting each other with air guitars out there.  They are not &quot;real swords&quot; in that they&#39;re not made of sharpened steel.   They ARE real bats with handles, made of rattan covered in fibre tape or duct tape (often both), perhaps padded on the end with foam or rubber inside tape, and sometimes not.   THAT is real.  I&#39;ve seen real bruises on Kirby, Marty and Keith (and dozens of others who pulled clothing up or down to show me a particularly glorious bruise, and always knew which of their friends had done it to them, and what they might want to do next time in terms of better armor or greater defensive moves to avoid another one in the same place).<br/>
<br/>
Yard gnomes are real like rattan swords are real.<br/>

<br/>
I assume this is generally the nature of unschooling parents.  I assume that they are flexible, not stiff and unrelenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-994647657">Different children want different things of course, but when my young son (5) asks something like &#39;are dragons real?&#39;, what he wants is my real opinion. <br/>
He might well respond by saying that *he* thinks they are, but he definitely wants to know what I really think. &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39; would be very unsatisfying for him, and untrue- in so far as human beings can attain knowledge about things outside their direct experience at all, I do know there are no dragons. <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that I squash his fantasy if he runs up to me and says &#39;there is a dragon living in the garden!&#39;. And when I really don&#39;t know then I say so.<br/>
All this &#39;what can we really know about the world anyway, all we know is what we can experience&#39; stuff can be fun for grown-ups, but I think the world is mysterious and confusing enough for small children, without parents getting all philosophical on them in response to a simple question.<br/>
