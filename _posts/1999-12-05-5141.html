<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253496886">Hi Charlotte,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the list! I have an 11 year old boy also. What kinds of things is<br/>
he doing for math? One thing my son has enjoyed is a math club which meets<br/>
once a month. Another homeschooling mom hosts the meeting at her home, and<br/>
about 10-15 children show up, ranging in age from about 7-13. They are doing<br/>
activities from the Reader&#39;s Digest book &quot;How Math Works.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
