<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838707251">Hey, now there is an excellent example.  When you make your Italian food, do<br/>
you claim to &quot;be&quot; Italian and set out to sell your Italian cooking as<br/>
authentic?  Well, unless you are, of course. &lt;g&gt;  In which case this example<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
I cook Italian.  Learned from a grandmother-in-law who immigrated from<br/>
Tuscany.  Pretty authentic, or so Noni and the other folks from the &quot;old<br/>
country&quot; have told me.  But, although I&#39;m married to one (well, honesty must<br/>
prevail, two but just not at the same time &lt;g&gt;) and have the dark hair and<br/>
olive complexion I don&#39;t claim to &quot;be&quot; Italian.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, pondering Molto Betsy or Molto Lynda.  Naaaa, just doesn&#39;t have that<br/>
ring to it &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; OK, I won&#39;t serve my version of Italian food if the pope comes to visit.<br/>
&gt; But, I think I should still be able to make my favorite inauthentic<br/>
lasagne<br/>
&gt; recipe in my own home.<br/>
