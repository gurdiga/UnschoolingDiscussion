more diverse languages. I&#39;ve traveled all over and in most countries people <br/>
are, at the least, bilingual. Americans have a very narrow view, I hear <br/>
comments like *If your gonna live here, speak the language.* How sad that <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377036835">Exactly, Nancy.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m excited that we might get to take a Norwegian class here in our town! <br/>
To me its sad that the traditions of old Norway are disappearing.  I have a goal of learning alot of the old arts and recipes so my daughters can keep up the traditions.  I know I&#39;m American, but I still enjoy those things and I think its fun to share these things with my children and hopefully my grandchildren.<br/>
We are hopefully going to make a bunad, the old religious dresses.  I just have to bone up on my sewing skills.  I can do lots of things with my needle and thread but I have a heck of a time with a darn machine!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I did think of saying that but whenever I say something that might <br/>
be construed to be unflattering towards the US people jusmp all <br/>
over me cos I&#39;m foreign. So I didn&#39;t.<br/>
The English aren&#39;t much better at languages but they are at least <br/>
aware that there are other ones. I remeber helping an American <br/>
couple in France who were moaning that they couldn&#39;t understand <br/>
the hotel manager even when he spoke English. It was deeply <br/>
embaressing watching this couple so I stepped in and translated <br/>
for them. The guy then turned to me and said &#39;these Europeans <br/>
should be grateful for us winning the war, they are lucky they&#39;re not <br/>
all speaking German now&#39;<br/>
I resisted the urge to poke him in the eye and just gave him false <br/>
directions to the Arc de Triomphe. For some reason he thought <br/>
that because I was English I would be on his side, failing obviously <br/>
to realise that the English are European too.<br/>
<br/>

father, who traveled all over, who speaks I don&#39;t know how many languages, <br/>
say we would all be speaking the *mother tongue* or *imperial Japanese* and <br/>
we would all be blonde blue eyed, skinny, and I won&#39;t repeat the rest but <br/>
lets just say it has to do with slurs on Asian features. So its not even an <br/>
American who doesn&#39;t know other languages thing. Its more of a bad winner <br/>
thing. Its like people feel the need to constantly remind the world that the <br/>
US won the war. And its not just W.W.II either. I have heard people say to my <br/>
favorite waitress at my fav. restaurant things like *Bet your ole queenie <br/>
over there is still sore she doesn&#39;t own us any more.* (as if the <br/>
Revolutionary war happened just last year) I really get a kick out of her <br/>
telling people she is Australian. One guy asked if it wasn&#39;t the same thing. <br/>
I have heard people make rude comments to German people and every single <br/>
Vietnam Vet I know calls just about every person of Asian descent a lovely <br/>
little name. I see the same thing happening with people who have been in many <br/>
of the middle-eastern countries. There is a constant measuring stick <br/>
Americans hold up to the rest of the world. I am sure if there was a locker <br/>
room with a man from every country, the American man would be the first to <br/>
whip it out and call *Biggest* Then there would be an arm wrestling contest. <br/>
But the American would win that by default only because he insulted all the <br/>
other men so much that they all left. <br/>
