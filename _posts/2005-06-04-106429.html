<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849103100">Heads up!  A free education opportunity awaits you this August.<br/>
<br/>
*************************************************<br/>
<br/>
The Red Planet is about to be spectacular!<br/>
<br/>
This month  and next, Earth is catching up with Mars in an encounter that <br/>
will culminate  in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded <br/>
history. The  next time Mars may come this close is in 2287. Due to the way <br/>
Jupiter&#39;s  gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its orbit, astronomers can <br/>
only be certain  that Mars has not come this close to Earth in the Last <br/>
5,000 years, but it  may be as long as 60,000 years before it happens again.<br/>
<br/>
The encounter  will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within <br/>
34,649,589 miles of  Earth and will be (next to the moon) the brightest <br/>
object in the night sky.  It will attain a magnitude of -2.9 and will <br/>
appear 25.11 arc seconds wide.  At a modest 75-power magnification<br/>
<br/>
Mars will look as large as the full  moon to the naked eye. Mars will be <br/>
easy to spot. At the beginning of August  it will rise in the east at <br/>
10p.m. and reach its azimuth at about 3  a.m.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of August when the two planets are closest, Mars will  rise at <br/>
nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12:30a.m. <br/>
That&#39;s  pretty convenient to see something that no human being has seen in <br/>
recorded history. So, mark your calendar at the beginning of August to see <br/>
Mars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the  month.<br/>
<br/>
Share this with your children and grandchildren.<br/>

NO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN!<br/>
