<div id="ygrps-yiv-134660215">This was forwarded to me from another list.  I think this is just <br/>
beautiful.<br/>
In Brooklyn, New York, Chush is a school that caters to learning <br/>
disabled children.  Some children remain in Chush <br/>
for their entire school <br/>
career, while others can be mainstreamed into conventional schools. <br/>
At a Chush fundraising dinner, the father of a Chush <br/>
child delivered a speech <br/>
that would never be forgotten by all who attended.  <br/>
<br/>
 After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he cried <br/>
out, &quot;Where is the perfection in my <br/>
son Shaya?  Everything God does is done with perfection.  But my <br/>
child cannot understand things as other children do.  My <br/>
child cannot remember <br/>
facts and figures as other children do.  Where is <br/>
God&#39;s perfection? <br/>
<br/>
The audience was shocked by the question, pained by the <br/>
father&#39;s anguish and <br/>
stilled by the piercing query.  &quot;I believe,&quot; the father <br/>
answered, &quot;that when God brings a child like this into the world, <br/>
the  perfection that he seeks is <br/>
in the way people react to this child.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
He then told the following story <br/>
about his son Shaya:  <br/>
<br/>
One afternoon, Shaya and his father walked past a park where some <br/>
boys Shaya knew were playing baseball.  Shaya asked, &quot;Do you think <br/>
they will let me play?&quot; Shaya&#39;s father knew that his son was not at <br/>
all athletic and that most boys would not want him on their team.  <br/>
But Shaya&#39;s father understood that if his son was chosen to play it <br/>
would give him a comfortable sense of <br/>
belonging. Shaya&#39;s father approached one of the boys <br/>
in the field and asked if Shaya could play. The boy looked around for <br/>
guidance from his teammates.  <br/>
<br/>
 Getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said &quot;We are <br/>
losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning.  I <br/>
guess he can be on our <br/>
team and we&#39;ll try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Shaya&#39;s father was ecstatic as Shaya smiled broadly.  Shaya was told <br/>
to put on a glove and <br/>
go out to play short center field.  In the bottom of the eighth <br/>
inning, Shaya&#39;s team scored a few runs but was still behind <br/>
by three. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shaya&#39;s team scored <br/>
again and now with two outs and the bases loaded with the potential <br/>
winning run on base.<br/>
<br/>
Shaya was scheduled to be up.  Would the team actually let Shaya bat <br/>
at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game?  <br/>
Surpassingly, Shaya <br/>
was given the bat.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone knew that it was all but impossible because Shaya didn&#39;t <br/>
even know how to hold the bat properly, let alone hit with it.  <br/>
However as Shaya stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few <br/>
steps to lob the ball in softly so Shaya should at least be able to <br/>
make contact. The first pitch <br/>
came and Shaya swung clumsily and missed.  One of Shaya&#39;s teammates <br/>
came up to Shaya and together they held the bat and faced the pitcher <br/>
waiting for <br/>
the next pitch.  The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss <br/>
the ball softly toward Shaya.  As the pitch came in, Shaya and his <br/>
teammate swung at the ball and together they hit a slow ground ball <br/>
to the pitcher. <br/>
<br/>
The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown <br/>
the ball to the first baseman.  Shaya would have been out and that <br/>
would have ended the game.  Instead, the pitcher took the ball and <br/>
threw <br/>
it on a high arc to right field, far beyond reach of the first <br/>
baseman.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone started yelling, &quot;Shaya, run to first.  Run to first.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Never in his life had Shaya <br/>
run to first.  He scampered down the baseline wide-eyed and <br/>
startled.  By the time he reached first base, the right fielder <br/>
had the ball.  He could have thrown he ball to the second baseman who <br/>
would tag out Shaya, who was still running.  <br/>
<br/>
But the right fielder understood <br/>
what the pitcher&#39;s intentions were, so he threw the ball high and far <br/>
over the third baseman&#39;s  head.  Everyone yelled, &quot;Run to second, run <br/>
to <br/>
second.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Shaya ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously <br/>
circled the bases <br/>
towards home.  As Shaya reached second base, the <br/>
opposing short stop ran to <br/>
him, turned him in the direction of third base and shouted, &quot;Run to <br/>
third.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
As Shaya rounded third, the boys from both teams ran <br/>
behind him screaming, <br/>
&quot;Shaya run home.&quot;  Shaya ran home, stepped on home plate and all 18 <br/>
boys lifted him on their shoulders and made him the hero, as if he <br/>
had just hit a <br/>
&quot;grand slam&quot; and won the game for his team. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;That day,&quot; said the father softly with tears now rolling down his <br/>
face, &quot;those 18 boys reached their level of God&#39;s perfection.&quot;</div>
