<div id="ygrps-yiv-4688820">I have posted info on several e-lists about John Taylor Gatto&#39;s <br/>
wonderful headliner article in the September issue of Harper&#39;s <br/>
Magazine in which he concisely and beautifully tells the world what <br/>
is so terribly wrong with compulsory schooling. Meanwhile I received <br/>
this message back from David Albert, a good friend of JTG&#39;s and an <br/>
excellent writer and advocate of self-directed learning:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;David Albert wrote:<br/>
&lt;&gt;I spoke with John on Tuesday (he was very excited.) He notes <br/>
however that the teachers unions are launching a massive letter <br/>
writing campaign.<br/>
<br/>
So, if folks read it and like it, they are urged to write to Harpers <br/>
saying so. Consider yourself urged. :-)<br/>

they found were shoes, beautiful shoes.&quot; -- Imelda Marcos&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE, EVERYONE, IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO READ THIS AT YOUR LIBRARY, <br/>
OR BETTER YET TO BUY A COPY FOR YOURSELF, SEND A LETTER OFF TO <br/>
HARPER&#39;S. LET&#39;S SHOW THE TEACHER&#39;S UNION THAT HOME EDUCATORS CAN BE <br/>
UNITED, TOO! WE CAN BE UNITED FOR THE FREEDOM TO EDUCATE OUR <br/>
CHILDREN OUTSIDE THE KIND OF PHILOSOPHY THAT GATTO DESCRIBES SO WELL <br/>
IN HIS ARTICLE AND IN HIS BOOKS.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my original post about the Harper&#39;s article:<br/>
&lt;&gt;Get yourself to the newstand or the library and get a copy of <br/>
Gatto&#39;s featured article in the September issue of Harper&#39;s, <br/>
titled &quot;Against School: How Public Education Cripples Our Kids, And <br/>
Why.&quot; I just picked this up tonight and it is a slam, bang, <br/>
magnificent manifesto on all that is wrong with contemporary <br/>
compulsory schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a quote from the end of the article to tease you: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;School trains children to be employees and consumers; teach you own <br/>
to be leaders and adventurers. School trains children to obey <br/>
reflexively; teach your own to think critically and independently. <br/>
Well-schooled kids have a low threshold for boredom; help your own to <br/>
develop an inner life so that they&#39;ll never be bored. Urge them to <br/>
take on the serious material, the grown up material, in history, <br/>
literature, philosophy, music, art, economics, theology -- all the <br/>
stuff schoolteachers know well enough to avoid. Challenge your kids <br/>
with plenty of solitude so that they can learn to enjoy their own <br/>
company, to conduct inner dialogues. Well-schooled people are <br/>
conditioned to dread being alone, and they seek constant <br/>
companionship through the TV, the computer, the cell phone, and <br/>
through shallow friendships quickly acquired and quickly abandoned. <br/>
Your children should have a more meaningful life, and they can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope that inspires you to read this article. And if you want more <br/>
JTG you can read his wonderful books. For more on John Taylor Gatto <br/>

&quot;Experts and an expert culture always call for more experts. Experts <br/>
also have a tendency to cartelize themselves by <br/>
creating &#39;institutional barricades&#39; - for example proclaiming <br/>
themselves gatekeepers, as well as self-selecting themselves. <br/>
Finally, experts control knowledge production, as they decide what <br/>
valid and legitimate knowledge is, and how its acquisition is <br/>
sanctioned.&quot; - Ivan Illich of DESCHOOLING SOCIETY&lt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1445669811">You can get a copy of this article free from the EBSCOhost Web <br/>
database for periodicals to which most libraries subscribe.  I was <br/>
able to access it via my home computer through our library system&#39;s <br/>
web site.  If you don&#39;t know how to do this (I didn&#39;t) phone or visit <br/>
your library and they will usually be happy to help you.  It was very <br/>
easy.<br/>
