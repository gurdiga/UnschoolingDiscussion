 </span></blockquote>This doesn&#39;t exactly pertain to your problem, but I&#39;m reminded of when I<br/>
was a child in school. People (usually my mom) would ask &quot;what did you<br/>
learn/do in school today&quot; and I would answer &quot;nothing&quot;. Even if we had a<br/>
good day, or did something interesting, I would have the same answer. I<br/>
think I felt like I was being put on the spot with the question. But<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed a lot of children are like that when they are asked things<br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, good luck explaining unschooling to your kids :-) <br/>
