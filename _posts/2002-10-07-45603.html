<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408506114">Just something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately, and would like some <br/>
opinions/experiences of others.<br/>

I &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, the revised edition where John added further <br/>
comment, and at one point, he details how he would try little tricks to <br/>
try to subtly correct children&#39;s speech (i.e. if the child said &quot;I breaked <br/>
it&quot;, he would repeat back at them &quot;You broke it?  Oh, ..&lt;whatever&gt;&quot;.)  His <br/>
revised comment was that he should not have done this.  Well, every day my <br/>
daughter makes mistakes like this, which, when you think about it, are <br/>
quite logical (by what logical explanation is &quot;took&quot; is the past tense of <br/>
&quot;take&quot;?), but incorrect.  I&#39;ve been resisting the impulse to directly <br/>
correct her, but she doesn&#39;t seem to be picking up on the correct past <br/>
tense of words, even though we use them correctly.  What do most of you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398495048">With my oldest, he picked up on the correct way to say things just by listening to other people talking. With my second son, though, I finally had to start correcting him so I, and other people, could figure out what he was saying. A typical sentence from him would be &quot;me wanted that was gone, purple thing now, he said no, it were over there&quot;. Now how many people could translate that into &quot;I wanted it, but it&#39;s gone, so I want the purple thing now, but Brett said no because it wasn&#39;t over there&quot;??? LOL So my opinion would be that it depends on the child!<br/>

of words, even though we use them correctly.  What do most of you do?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With my mom being a school teacher, (ex now) I remember growing up always <br/>
being corrected in my grammer. I absolutely hated it. I guess maybe that&#39;s <br/>
why I don&#39;t do it to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
I just let them go, if they ask, I answer. Something cute was when Joseph <br/>
was little, he made up a word, amn&#39;t. As in &quot;I am not dong that.&quot; It made <br/>
sense to me that he used it and Sierra being 13 months right behind him, <br/>
picked it up too. I thought it was rather cute and it didn&#39;t really bother <br/>
me that it wasn&#39;t a real word. It was to them. Sadly, I hardly ever hear <br/>
that word anymore. (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
Once in awhile, Joseph (7) or Sierra (6) will say something and look at me <br/>
after they use a word, almost knowing it doesn&#39;t sound right. That&#39;s when <br/>
I&#39;ll give them the right one. Only one I can think of right now is saying <br/>
heared instead of heard. Other than that, I let it go and as of now, see no <br/>
problem in them using words that don&#39;t always go. Once in a while one will <br/>
come up, but&#39;s what the big deal? JMO<br/>

He &quot;made it up&quot; according to rules, and it&#39;s not his sole creation.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen it in print.  It&#39;s not his alone.<br/>
<br/>
Kids go through a stage where the things they said before that were &quot;right&quot; <br/>
are replaced with things their parents consider &quot;wrong,&quot; and then they go <br/>
back to &quot;right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;wrong&quot; stage proves that they&#39;ve learned the rules and patterns.  The <br/>
second right phase proves they&#39;ve learned that English ignores rules and <br/>
patterns a lot, and they&#39;re learning the exceptions.<br/>

Man does one have to really watch wording on this list sometimes. Okay he <br/>
made it up to us because we had never read it or heard it used before. And <br/>
was it really necessary to say what we thought was so darned cute isn&#39;t his <br/>

It WAS cute! <br/>
He DID create it (by following rules).<br/>
<br/>
But you stated it wasn&#39;t a real word, and it is a real word.  (I didn&#39;t quote <br/>
the whole post.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth being careful how you say things everywhere in your whole life.  <br/>
This list isn&#39;t an exception to conditions prevalent in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
I figured there would be people here interested in research on children&#39;s <br/>
linguistic development.  Lots of kids will say &quot;men&quot;  and &quot;mice&quot; from hearing <br/>
them,  and later will say &quot;mans&quot; and &quot;mouses&quot; (because they&#39;ve picked up on <br/>
the patterns) and go back to men and mice in a year or two.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s healthy and good, and cute and fun.<br/>
Things CAN be both and all that.<br/>

they say. Kids really do say the darndest things don&#39;t they?<br/>
I&#39;m reading the stories and can almost hear the kids myself.<br/>
<br/>
Alyssa, almost two, has some trouble with certain words that just come out <br/>
so cute. Joseph is DoDo, Sierra is RaRa, Tara comes out as plain as day. <br/>
When she wants to say yes, it comes out like rah. I guess for yeah. She kind <br/>
of sounds like Scooby Doo sometimes!<br/>
Yet poophead comes out just as clear as a bell. I have my 16 year old to <br/>
thank for that. She also taught her turd. I tell Tara sometimes I think I <br/>
have 2 two year olds in the house!!!!! Lately Tara has taken to teaching <br/>
Alyssa the song Copacabana. Not exactly one of my favorites, especially when <br/>
you hear Tara sing it!!! She sings the lines and Alyssa repeats the last <br/>
word of each one. As goofy as I find the song, you can&#39;t help but laugh!!!<br/>

My son (three) is doing something unusual and cute too.  When he <br/>
wants two of something, he asks for dose.  I don&#39;t know where it came <br/>
from.  No one in our family or anyone we know speaks Spanish.  We <br/>
don&#39;t live in a Spanish speaking area.  The only thing I can think is <br/>
that he picked it up from tv, like maybe one of those pbs shows.  We <br/>
don&#39;t have Spanish tv here either.  &quot;Me want dose&quot;. <br/>

unschooling since birth though back then we didn&#39;t even know what it was <br/>
called.  We do a lot of things with our time, but at the moment my two <br/>
older boys are sorting through hundreds of drawings (maybe a month&#39;s worth) <br/>
to decide which they will keep, and Simon has gone next door to give one of <br/>
his drawings to his best friend, Dave, who is 67.  Dave will probably give <br/>
him a candy in return :-) We are lucky to have good neighbours on all sides.<br/>

family. One day my Mom was relining the pantry shelves with shelf paper and <br/>
she said she had to go get more shelf paper at the store. She left and came <br/>
home to a shelf covered in panty liners! My little sister was so proud of <br/>
herself! She told Mom that she found the pantry liners in the bathroom. So <br/>
now we call shelf paper pantry liner and panty liners pantry liners. &lt;g&gt; Poor <br/>
Darin was so confused the day he saw me write pantry liners on the grocery <br/>
list. He got to the store and searched all over and even asked a clerk. He <br/>
called me and told me he couldn&#39;t find them. When I told him what I needed, <br/>
he groaned and flat out refused to buy them. He was so embarrassed. <br/>

Liam at nearly 8 still has wonderful Liam-isms, but they are rapidly fading <br/>
away.  He only just lost his first tooth a couple of weeks ago.  He had <br/>
heard plenty about the tooth fairy (not from me!), and I was all set to do <br/>
the deed, but he told me that his first tooth was too special and that he <br/>
wanted to save it.  He&#39;s a heart-breaker!<br/>

That story is too funny! <br/>
It reminded me of one time in the car with my son(then 8), daughter and her friend.  My son asked me what a condom was.  I hesitated.......and then, being the open-minded, ask me anything kind of mom I am, I gave a brief, matter of fact description of what a condom is and what it is used for.  He gave me a very confused look so I asked him why he had wanted to know.....and he said &quot;cause Rayne (the friend) is going to one this weekend&quot;......????<br/>
It took me about a minute to realize that he meant condo....  I remembered that my friend and her daughter were going to another friend&#39;s condominium to visit for the weekend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585476074">I hope everyone is writing down these cute little things that their kids are <br/>
saying. At least if your memory is anything like mine. I must admit I don&#39;t <br/>
write everything down but some are a must.<br/>
<br/>
Every Halloween, I still remember when Joseph was about 4 and would look at <br/>
a house and if it was decorated would dub that house as &quot;trick or <br/>
treatable.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007540026"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My son (three) is doing something unusual and cute too.  When he<br/>
&gt; wants two of something, he asks for dose.  I don&#39;t know where it came<br/>
&gt; from.  No one in our family or anyone we know speaks Spanish.  We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t live in a Spanish speaking area.  The only thing I can think is<br/>
&gt; that he picked it up from tv, like maybe one of those pbs shows.  We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have Spanish tv here either.  &quot;Me want dose&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe he is trying to say &quot;those&quot;?  Very cute of him!<br/>
<br/>
My two year old daughter thinks in terms of balls.  She absolutely loves<br/>
balls.  So an apple is an &quot;ap-ball&quot; a bubble is a &quot;bub-ball&quot;.  I love<br/>
hearing these cute little words.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; home to a shelf covered in panty liners! My little sister was so proud of <br/>
&gt; herself! She told Mom that she found the pantry liners in the bathroom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ROTFLMAO!!!!!! That is just too cute. I can just picture what that must <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; looked like. Did anyone get a picture???<br/>

package of maxi-pads, and calling, &quot;Look, Mommy, do you need some diapers?&quot;<br/>
