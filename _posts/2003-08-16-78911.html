 </span></blockquote>Great post!  I loved it.  It&#39;s a perfect example of how all people have <br/>
abilities and gifts that are valued, in our households, at least.  <br/>
Now, let&#39;s work on the rest of the world!!  <br/>
<br/>
And, because he doesn&#39;t spend an inordinate amt of time improving his reading <br/>
skills, he has the time to spend on his true talents and loves. I love that <br/>
about unschooling, and it reminds of something I read long ago, maybe somebody <br/>
will remember where this comes from.  I read so much I can never remember <br/>
sources!!<br/>
<br/>
People have different capabilities to reach certain levels of mastery in <br/>
various subjects. At a certain point, the work required to reach the next level of <br/>
mastery becomes exponentially greater, and for some people, that is not a <br/>
hard reach, as they have the ability to comprehend large batches of that kind of <br/>
info at a time,  and for others, the time and energy involved would be <br/>
incredibly large to improve a small amount of skills or knowledge.   <br/>
<br/>
For example, a friend of mine has taken the GED four or five times since she <br/>
dropped out of school.  She has studied and gone to classes for years now, but <br/>
each time she takes the test, she only improves by a few points, still not <br/>
passing.  For her, the skills that she must develop to pass take her an <br/>
extraordinary amount of time and effort to develop.  <br/>
<br/>
That girl has saved my ass quite a few times in life. lol  We&#39;ve known each <br/>
other since about 5th grade, and she is street smart in ways I have never even <br/>
tried to understand.  My mind just doesn&#39;t work that way, and it&#39;s so funny <br/>
when she tries to explain something to me, it&#39;s the same as when I am teaching <br/>
her how to diagram sentences, blank looks and confused questions.  We just have <br/>
radically different ways of being in the world.  She&#39;s told me before, for <br/>
such a smart girl, you sure are stupid.  ;-) <br/>
<br/>
We help each other out when we can, but most of the time we give up, it just <br/>
takes too much time and energy to explain.  But she is teaching me to be less <br/>
niave, and I am teaching her how to write essays.  lol We both want to learn <br/>
those things, but it&#39;s just difficult because we&#39;ve reached a learning plateau <br/>
on them.  It&#39;s almost like we reached a barrier to the rest of that subject, <br/>
and we have to force our brains to look at things in an &quot;unnatural&quot; way for us <br/>
to comprehend them.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Ethan, for example, knows that in order to get to the next level in <br/>
reading, he would have to work extraordinarily hard to do so, and it&#39;s not worth it <br/>
to him.  And you would just have to do too much to your own brain to <br/>
comprehend the VCR.  The point is, if you WANT to, you can, but it would mean spending <br/>
a long time on a learning plateau first, before the understanding would come. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I love this idea, and I love that it explains why &quot;well rounded education&quot; <br/>
can really only go so far.  When people reach these learning plateaus, it&#39;s <br/>
ridiculous to expect students to work thru them.  You can only do so when YOU <br/>
REALLY WANT TO.  There has to be an incredible amt of motivation and passion <br/>
behind it for it to happen eventually.  <br/>
<br/>
About my friend, she&#39;s taking the damn test again soon.  She feels she has <br/>
to.  I can&#39;t talk her out of it, and so I&#39;m helping her as best I can. I <br/>
understand her well enough that I can explain things in a way that&#39;s not as hard for <br/>
her to process, and she&#39;s improving.  She gets frustrated with how slow the <br/>
going is, and of course, when I first started explaining learning plateaus, she <br/>
had no idea what I&#39;m talking about, but she&#39;s starting to understand that too. <br/>
 She&#39;s not as hard on herself anymore.  She doesn&#39;t call herself stupid <br/>
anymore, either.  Hooray!!!  <br/>

These are the weird differences which are explained pretty wonderfully by <br/>
Howard Gardner in Frames of Mind, and at multiple intelligences websites various <br/>
places.  Anyone have a favorite one?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES.. yes.. exactly.. .. to your whole post..   I have found many things in <br/>
my life that are not worth the time and effort for me to master.    There are <br/>
lots of places and things where I will take the shortest route and the easiest <br/>
most convenient solution.  I do not want to spend the time and energy to learn <br/>
how a car ( or anything mechanical ) works.  If my Dh or Ethan was not here <br/>
to do maintenance on them.. I would hire someone.    I know lots of folks who <br/>
will go out and buy cake or cookies because they don&#39;t want to learn how to <br/>
bake from scratch.  I wouldn&#39;t do it unless I absolutely HAD to.. lol  I have had <br/>
people say, .. uhhm, , you SEWED those curtains???     They are thinking, <br/>
&quot;girl, you are crazy to spend $20 on fabric and 4 hours of your time to make <br/>
those curtains yourself when you could have bought some for $25.&quot;       I think <br/>
some folks are whacked for spending all hot summer in their garden, planting, <br/>
hoeing, weeding, harvesting vegetables.  Then, they prepare, can or freeze the <br/>
goods for later use.. when they could buy 3 cans of beans for $1.. :-)  OH, now <br/>
don&#39;t get me wrong.. Boy, I will eat those homegrown beans right up YUMM. .. <br/>
But, I dont want to learn how, or spend the time to do it myself.     <br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that as unschoolers ( adults and children!) we have the freedom <br/>
to chose what we spend our time on, and the joy of pursuing only what we <br/>
REALLY want to learn.    <br/>

what I&#39;m talking about!!  lol<br/>
<br/>
Well, here&#39;s one who sews her own curtains, but would also LOVE a vegetable <br/>
garden and a canning kit, lol  <br/>

<br/>
I love to bake too.  But there are certain things I buy, as well.  See how <br/>
that works! lol  <br/>
<br/>
( Do you bake pies?  Have any hints for a decent pie crust? My family&#39;s <br/>
getting sick of not eating the crust because it&#39;s so bad, hehehe.  Maybe I should <br/>
just buy them frozen.  See, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to learn, I&#39;ve just <br/>
reached a learning plateau! )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL.. I can&#39;t back pie crusts either!   Or decent biscuits.   My mom and <br/>
Grandma are both excellent pie crust and biscuit bakers..  I buy the frozen ones <br/>
too.  There has to be something &quot;special&quot; to baking pie crusts and biscuits...  <br/>
But, I have several dishes  with which I can &quot;outcook&quot; my mom and my Grandma. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
About the gardening and canning.. Anna saw a canning starter kit at the <br/>
grocery store.. Actually, I think it was geared for making jam/jelly/preserves.. <br/>
She immediately became interested in making some type of canned fruit.    I <br/>
didn&#39;t buy the pre packaged kit thingy, because it was just a marketing ploy.. <br/>
lol.. You could easily buy all the components seperatly for a lot less $$..   I <br/>
promised her we would buy some canning supplies.and make some jelly or <br/>
something.    We are going to look some ideas/recipes up online.   So,  even my &quot;non <br/>
interest&quot; in canning does not deter my children from pursuing it.    OH, I <br/>
remember my MOST favorite thing my mom used to make was strawberry freezer jam.. <br/>
That is fairly simple to make and.. OMG.. WONDERFUL on those homemade biscuits. <br/>
 MMMM, now thinking about that makes me consider taking another stab at <br/>
conquering the biscuit challange. lol.. OR, I could just call Moma and ask her to <br/>
make me some :-)<br/>

No, but it&#39;s like &quot;topping out,&quot; and if someone has gotten as far as they&#39;re <br/>
going to get in one or another hobby/pursuit, is it better for others to push <br/>
and pressure or to leave them alone?  Maybe it&#39;s a plateau with yet a higher <br/>
level to be obtained later, someday, maybe.  Maybe it a plateau that&#39;s their <br/>
highest ever in that field.   I&#39;d let it go either way.<br/>

Ah, biscuits, I just made some last nite, very good!!!  So I can make those, <br/>
hehe, but I think you&#39;ve got something there.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if what made this biscuit so good and easy would also help with pie <br/>
crusts...Shortening, not butter.  Something about butter having too much <br/>
water.  Now European butter has a higher fat content and less water, I just heard <br/>
about it, but it&#39;s hard to find.  <br/>
<br/>
Wanna try those biscuits? I&#39;ll send the recipe off list.....And to anyone <br/>
else who wants em, post to me off list, they were SO GOOD.  <br/>
