<div id="ygrps-yiv-260299325">i am actually the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
i almost always prefer to read fiction.  non-fiction is just too much of<br/>
what i already have - usually.  also, non-fiction (at least the non-fiction<br/>
i have been exposed) is way to big of a downer.  i am so into happy endings.<br/>

&gt; This is sure me too.  I even got to a point where I couldn&#39;t stand to read<br/>
&gt; fiction, because I felt life is too short, there&#39;s too much &quot;real&quot;<br/>
interesting<br/>
&gt; stuff out there I want to read before I die!<br/>

&gt; You&#39;ve touched on a pet peeve  here. :) I used to have people who would<br/>
come into the bookstore who proudly told me they never read fiction. My<br/>
response was a quote from somewhere, &quot;Non-fiction has the facts but fiction<br/>
holds the truth&quot;. A good history book can tell you lots about WW11 Germany<br/>
but Jerry Kosinski&#39;s The Painted Bird will take you inside and shake you up<br/>
like nothing else. That all said I&#39;ve been devoured historical stuff lately<br/>
and ignoring my fiction shelves.:)<br/>
