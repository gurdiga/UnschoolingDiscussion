<div id="ygrps-yiv-625856002">Hi Marji,<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already received wonderful answers.  I only wanted to add that often<br/>
that &#39;perfectionistic&#39; attitude comes with boys and boys who are gifted.<br/>
Something about the testosterone/competition thing built into them, no<br/>
doubt.  My 7 year old is my 3rd child and thinks he should be able to do<br/>
all my 13 and 16 year old children do.  He actually is at the same level as<br/>
my 13 year old in many concrete subjects like math, science, etc.  My 16<br/>
year old was complaining that he isn&#39;t finished with algebra yet so he<br/>
could be helping her!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing this just to let you know that he will learn sensitivity and<br/>
compassion for himself and others... it just takes time and some litte boys<br/>
come into the world with that wonderful drive to accomplish much and be<br/>
great.  I am thankful that we are able to direct that energy a bit into<br/>
positive and worthwhile avenues (as opposed to anti-social ones).  I would<br/>
presume your son, Liam, may be a bit eccentric because he is highly<br/>
intelligent and demanding of himself as a person.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Elaine</div>
