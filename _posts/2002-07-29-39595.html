<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921588301">If your kids love baseball -- you might enjoy this website for the <br/>
Exploratorium in San Francisco.  There is a section on the science of <br/>
baseball.   It&#39;s one of our favorites!<br/>

&gt; them?  lol.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s started a collection of McFarlane baseball figures (famous<br/>
&gt; players).  They&#39;re mostly limited editions, so he&#39;s got a catcher, a<br/>
&gt; batter, and a pitcher.  We have a homemade Lego table that just happens<br/>
&gt; to have a green felt floor.  As soon as he gets his room cleaned up<br/>
&gt; today, we&#39;re digging that out and are going to paint a diamond on it.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure he will spend hours dreaming up baseball scenarios with those<br/>
&gt; three players, until they come out with a few fielders and shortstop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He and his father took a baseball trip to St. Louis last year, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; planning one for them on the sly for opening day next year.  He&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; in quite a few major league parks.  Way more than I or his brothers had<br/>
&gt; ever been to before they were 9. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We just spent about 2 hours in the JC Penney outlet looking for a<br/>
&gt; baseball (only) blanket/comforter/duvet to go with the Arizona<br/>
&gt; Diamondbacks sheets he found on clearance.  At Wal-Mart after that, he<br/>
&gt; spent 15 minutes talking to the guy with the airbrush t-shirt stand how<br/>
&gt; much it would cost to airbrush a giant baseball on a comforter, because<br/>
&gt; we couldn&#39;t find anything appropriate to fit his bed. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His oldest brother helped him paint real infield lines on the grass in<br/>
&gt; the front yard, and since I mowed it all off, it&#39;s time to repaint.<br/>
&gt; This time, he says, they won&#39;t forget the batters box!  Our new<br/>
&gt; lanscaping even has a dugout (a bench) along the 3rd base line!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can see, he doesn&#39;t really *need* another outlet for this<br/>
&gt; baseball obsession, but I&#39;ll keep the models in mind in case he runs out<br/>
&gt; of ideas!  lol.  Thanks.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;The great thing about baseball is he will actually read books about <br/>
&gt; it!  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Some unschooling friends of mine got so far into baseball that they <br/>
&gt; started<br/>
&gt; &gt;making to-scale models of famous baseball stadiums.  Wonder if he&#39;d <br/>
&gt; enjoy that.<br/>
