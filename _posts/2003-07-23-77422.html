<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970161753">Jeva, how dare you come on this list and then go to RUL and attack <br/>
Sandra like that. You come on here talking about peaceful parenting<br/>
or  <br/>
whatever it was you were going on and on about and then go and do <br/>
that? From what I saw, Sandra was not even on list for a while, why <br/>
attack her personally? Why single her out? Are you jealous? <br/>
<br/>
People have been short and flippy with me but to go on a public <br/>
unschooling list and talk about someone like that is just so immature.<br/>
Sandra may be short when she is tired of hearing something over and <br/>
over, sometimes I agree, sometimes I don&#39;t BUT I have a lot of<br/>
respect for her and all that she does to help parents and children. <br/>
She isone person on this list that you can count on to help if you<br/>
are <br/>
having a problem unschooling or even life in general.<br/>
<br/>
And just for the record, you made a complete ass out of yourself on <br/>
RUL. Someone posted there last week about not liking Sandra and some <br/>
guy on the list stuck up for Sandra and the conversation dropped. So <br/>
there seems to be more on that list that care for Sandra than dislike <br/>
or maybe they weren&#39;t up to playing gossip games, I don&#39;t know. Seems <br/>
to me that you have a problem and maybe you should keep it to <br/>
yourself.<br/>
