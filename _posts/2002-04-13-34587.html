<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160320755">Perhaps the new message should tell people what the moderators do, that is,<br/>
you don&#39;t censor, but are there to referee or whatever you&#39;d like to call<br/>
it! :-) Another list I&#39;m on had a message from the moderator today that said<br/>
a discussion seemed to be going in a direction other than homeschooling and<br/>
she had pulled the messages and was asking the participants to take it<br/>
offline. I would have been extremely annoyed had I been one of those<br/>
posters, and would not want to post on a list that heavily moderated.<br/>
