<div id="ygrps-yiv-512680173">This is something I&#39;ve never understood....How did this ever become an<br/>
issue? Granted I was never a boy scout so I don&#39;t know, but I have a hard<br/>
time envisioning this. Is there a badge for having sex with a girl for the<br/>
first time? Is that in the handbook? Or is it simply because it is a<br/>
Christian organization, therefore any rule in the Bible must be followed by<br/>
everyone? If that is the case, why pick on homosexuality? You&#39;ll notice it&#39;s<br/>
not in the 10 Commandments. There&#39;s barely a mention of it at all (I can<br/>
only think of 3 times).  Most important to me, Jesus Christ himself never<br/>
said a word about it. He spoke of love, compassion and The Golden Rule. Why<br/>
has this &quot;sin&quot; become more important than things like resting on the Sabbath<br/>
(which _is_ in the 10 Commandments)?  If they are going to be so nosy about<br/>
what their members and leaders do you&#39;d think they&#39;d care if someone had an<br/>
affair, or coveted their neighbor&#39;s car, or ever lied.<br/>

They have every right to include or exclude whomever they please as a private organization.  The main outrage has been based on the fact that many people were in the scouts, involved with the scouts or supporting the scouts (like corporations, on a large scale) who are now either among the excluded group or friends/family/supporters of the excluded group.  Put yourself (generic you, not anyone in particilar) in that situation, and how would you feel?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069231709">I like your point too Valerie, Nanci, and all others who responded in like.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, as a heterosexual women, will NEVER again support  (i.e. time,<br/>
funds, or interest) the Boy Scout organization because of their hatred<br/>
to the gay community.  They may chose who they want in their organzation<br/>
but I think they will be surprised at just how many people they have lost.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-479503566">They aren&#39;t a Christian organization but they do put forth &quot;Christian<br/>
values.&quot;  They also have Buddhist chapters and others that aren&#39;t<br/>
christian.<br/>
<br/>
This all came about because a leader decided to not play by the &quot;don&#39;t ask<br/>
don&#39;t tell rules.&quot;  Some of the parents didn&#39;t want him as a leader for<br/>
their boys.  He sued.  They don&#39;t screen for this, they never made a big<br/>
deal over it but they refused to buckle under to this guy&#39;s demands.  There<br/>
are gay leaders now, there are gay members now but they don&#39;t flaunt it.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t care one iota what the leaders are.  I do, however, feel<br/>
the organization has a right to set their own rules.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my position would be clearer if I explained that my cousin is gay, he<br/>
is a troop leader and he has never had a problem with either their policy<br/>
or the kids/parents in his troop.  He doesn&#39;t flaunt his sexual preferences<br/>
and he thinks it is silly to make a production out of one&#39;s sexual<br/>
preferences.  One of his comments comes to mind each time I hear about<br/>
these different things, &quot;I don&#39;t understand why everyone in the community<br/>
has to make a production.  I never see heterosexual day parades or people<br/>
standing up in a room proclaiming they are heterosexual.  Sex belongs in<br/>
the bedroom, period!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483175861">The quote is my cousin&#39;s opinion.  He is rather, hmmm, how to say this in a<br/>
slightly pc manner, ah, different &lt;g&gt; and probably one of the funniest<br/>
people I know, particularly when he really isn&#39;t trying to be.  He is gay<br/>
but doesn&#39;t believe that to be &quot;out of the closet&quot; one has to go to the<br/>
extreme and become a hollywood stereotype and, as he puts it, &quot;swish.&quot;  He<br/>
likes to keep his sex life private and said he wishes everyone else would<br/>
also.  And that includes one of his favorite gripes,  heterosexuals kids<br/>
who &quot;just about do the dirty&quot; in the middle of the mall as he phrases it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138277184">Amy, I don&#39;t know where you get your information, but it simply is not<br/>
correct!  Danny has been openly gay for about 30 years now and everyone in<br/>
town knows he is gay.  However, unlike the person who started this whole<br/>
bruhaha, he doesn&#39;t, as he puts it &quot;swish&quot; or &quot;counsel&quot; kids about how they<br/>
might have leanings toward the gay lifestyle.  He doesn&#39;t spend time at his<br/>
troop meetings telling them about his lifestyle, which is something else<br/>
this other person did.  He goes about his business in a professional<br/>
manner.  All the parents are aware of his life style and were given the<br/>
option of having their sons in another troop.  None in 15 years have made<br/>
that choose!<br/>
<br/>
Further, contrary to what some seem to want to believe, other folks with<br/>
questionable standards and morals have been removed from &quot;scoutdom.&quot;  One<br/>
in Colorado was caught with another man&#39;s wife in a &quot;swingers&quot; club and he<br/>
was bounced.  Another turned out to have a questionable record (child abuse<br/>
and possible molesting) and he was removed.  I know of several other cases<br/>
and they ended with the same decision, out the door!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504876226">This happens frequently but doesn&#39;t get the press because it isn&#39;t a big pc<br/>
issue at the moment.  Leaders and scouts have been stripped of all the<br/>
honors they have ever acquired for those types of actions--every merit<br/>
badge, everything.  These don&#39;t get the press and when I asked some folks<br/>
at a major newspaper, &quot;why not,&quot; I was told, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t make a splash.&quot;<br/>

Germany.  No campfire, no 4H.  I live in the middle of nowhere as far as<br/>
army bases are concerned.  &lt;sigh&gt;  Personally, I think my son would enjoy<br/>
the girl scouts a lot -- one of my friends is running it and they have a lot<br/>
of cool things going on.  But I don&#39;t think that idea is going to work.....<br/>

programs (baseball leagues, TOPS, on and on).  I don&#39;t see why the Army <br/>
would keep you from doing such a thing as Camp Fire or 4-H.  I realize <br/>
you might have to get some sort of approval, but do you think they&#39;d <br/>
really turn you down?<br/>

4-H is a function of county extension agencies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks a LOT for this info.  I did call around a bit and found out while<br/>
supposedly there is going to be a 4-H club here, nobody seems to know who&#39;s<br/>
running it or any other details, like who I&#39;d call for information.  So I<br/>
need to poke around more.  But I really appreciate knowing it&#39;s out there,<br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I did, in the end, register my son for scouts.  And yea, I got roped into<br/>
co-leading the den.  But I get a little more input into how it looks that<br/>
way, too.  We&#39;ll see how it goes.  I still have my doubts and concerns, but<br/>
I&#39;ve had to invest $4 at this point, so it seems worth a try.<br/>
