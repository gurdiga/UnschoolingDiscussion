&lt;&lt; When kids can have free-access to a wide<br/>
variety of food, including vegetables, fruit, nuts, meats, grains and<br/>
honey, they don&#39;t miss sugar.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious why sugar is prohibited. I assume it&#39;s for the obvious reasons, <br/>
the same reasons anyone would ban or limit sugar, until I get to the part <br/>
that honey is ok. Honey and sugar are the SAME as far as the body&#39;s <br/>
concerned. So I&#39;m just curious if what sugar does to the body, is the reason <br/>
why your family abstains from sugar (because if it is, then you need to stop <br/>
eating honey too), or if it&#39;s a totally different reason (like that it <br/>
*sounds* better that honey comes from bees, and sugar is processed first). <br/>
BTW, my mom (too?) thought honey was somehow &quot;better&quot; for you than sugar when <br/>
we were growing up, so I had mostly honey, and rarely sugar, but now people <br/>
know there&#39;s really no difference (as far as what it does in/to your body) <br/>
between the two.   Lara..........</div>
