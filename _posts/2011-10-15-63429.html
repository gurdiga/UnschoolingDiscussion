Is this about finding local dentists or about policies and research about children&#39;s dental care or what?  Please be more specific.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079192083">Sorry.<br/>
we have visited the dentist recently and i have been told that 2 of my children need dental work...extractions and fillings on baby teeth.  i am reluctant and they are anxious.  the dentist had a terrible &quot;bed side manner&quot; and i said to her that i felt condemend by her remarks that it was all the fault of a bad diet and asked her if there could be other factors....she was reluctant to admit this could be the case.<br/>
i remember a couple of years ago a yahoo group was set up and it was hosted by a dentist who offered advice on other options and treatments available.<br/>
thanks<br/>

I am no longer a member and do not know how good they still are.<br/>
My son was 3 when I joined them 7 years ago. Lots of great information and alternative to  mainstream dentistry plus new<br/>
