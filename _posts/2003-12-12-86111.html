 </span></blockquote>   But that&#39;s a name worth waiting for. So what did you call him in <br/>
the meantime? When I was PG w/#2, #1 wanted to name the baby. She <br/>
had a whole lineup of original names: stupid train, stupid <br/>
lightpost, stupid ___ (fill in the blank with any non-sentient <br/>
object). I nixed them all. Finally, she offered &quot;Shoo lie lou,&quot; from <br/>
a song. We agreed to call #2 that until birth, when we&#39;d see who it <br/>
was, and then decide on a permanent name. Funny: after the birth, <br/>
the midwife was filling out the birth record papers and asked how we <br/>
spelled shoo lie lou. She thought that&#39;s what we were calling the <br/>
baby for real! Said she&#39;d heard plenty more unusual. :-)<br/>
*************<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve told this story here. I have acquaintances who couldn&#39;t <br/>
come up with a name. It had been about six weeks, and they ran into a friend, <br/>
who admired the baby girl and asked her name. Stan replied, &quot;None yet.&quot; The <br/>
woman said, &quot;Nunyet? That&#39;s unusual. Is it ethnic?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They named her Jennifer VERY quickly after.<br/>

I have a niece who named her dog Dono for the same reason. People <br/>
asked what the dog&#39;s name was and she always replied &quot;Don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>

didn&#39;t get thought about!!<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until he was about 2 I suddenly thought &#39;gosh, I have a<br/>
third child&#39; :-)<br/>

Heather has been going through a book on plants. She thought Kudzu<br/>
sounded nice, or millet. Rhodri suggested Mushroom and Bryn wants her<br/>
named after his cat.<br/>

Now, where did I put the passports....<br/>

outside town and paints cool pictures. In fact, we have a signed <br/>
Mushroom in our entrway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

SC. In fact, I told a friend here that I felt like I follwed you <br/>
around like a puppy or something. I really enjoyed talking with you. <br/>
You are incredibly funny! :o)<br/>
