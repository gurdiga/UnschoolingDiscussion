<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610030830">data conforms to opinion in regards to its presentation<br/>
the cup is 1/2 full<br/>
the cup is half empty<br/>
both are opinions, in this case both are accurate<br/>
often times differing opinions  can both be accurate in my view, <br/>
<br/>
editorial, documentary whatever, Michael Moore, Fox, CNN, its all presented to us- to argue regarding opinion or data would be semantics I think?<br/>
<br/>
please excuse my hasty comment to your reply to me Sandra, it seems perhaps I am a bit defensive,<br/>
I turned off the computer and it kept bothering me, I couldnt believe your comment upset me, why did it?<br/>
Im not sure, anyways, <br/>
Im pretty familiar with the whole tv argument, several sides of it anyways, I think the data and opinions, shows and commercials are like the glass of water, its all in how you see it <br/>
for me its about choice and the ability to choose what works best for me, and my kids, but when I said I dont watch anything else doesnty mean my kids dont, they see it everywhere...media is entrenched in our society, <br/>
<br/>
I think consciousness may be key,<br/>
I think if you are conscious when you watch(or type or eat or whatever) then you retain a clearer ability to choose and perceive objectively, but how many of us really remain conscious when watching tv?  Its like getting a massage, and I prefer to choose who I allow to massage my brain,<br/>

<br/>
I remain conscious when I watch TV.  I&#39;m pretty sure my kids do too, since they have so many things to say about what they watch on TV.<br/>
<br/>
Dh, well, he has trained himself to fall asleep on the couch with the TV so loud that I can hear the dialogue from another room.  He doesn&#39;t seem to notice when I or the girls tiptoe out, slip the remote out of his hand, and lower the volume.  So I guess you are right that some people do not remain conscious while watching TV. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

falling sound asleep during movies. Did it last night. I do it often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679743263">Ted Ringer&#39;s Secret School of Writing is an online writing course.<br/>
<br/>
If you liked Natalie Goldberg&#39;s &quot;Writing Down the Bones,&quot; then Secret <br/>
School might be something you&#39;d really enjoy. Ted studied and taught <br/>
with Natalie Goldberg in New Mexico. He has some of his poetry in the <br/>
&quot;Magnetic Poetry Book of Poetry&quot; and has published a novel called,&quot;Get <br/>
Outta Town.&quot;<br/>

My 18 yo loved Secret School a couple of years ago and just reminded me <br/>
of it because she decided to re-enroll.<br/>
