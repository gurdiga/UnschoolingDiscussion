<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114099343">Jean Liedloff has some interesting things to say about the possible cause of<br/>
our modern woes (everything from drug addiction to various forms of mental<br/>
illness to a craving for scary amusement park rides) in her book, The<br/>
Continuum Concept.<br/>
<br/>
This was an early work that underlies a lot of whats been popularized by<br/>
others as attachment parenting. Liedloff compares the babyhoods of the<br/>
Yequana tribespeople in Venezuela (she lived amongst them for a couple of<br/>
years) with the babyhoods most of us modern folks lived through. Ive found<br/>
the book helpful in questioning a lot of the givens of this society,<br/>
though I do think there are some other explanations for certain behavior,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Im writing a book on my experiences with attachment parenting / the<br/>
continuum concept, unschooling and baby sign language. Its mostly made up<br/>
of poems, drawings and journal entries, but will include a resource list and<br/>
how-to tips. Im probably going to have to unsubscribe soon for a while, in<br/>
order to finish the book. If anybody wants to receive an email when its<br/>
available, send me a note privately, at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ElsaHaas@...">ElsaHaas@...</a><br/>
