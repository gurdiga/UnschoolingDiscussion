&lt;&lt; My wife and I have been looking into Clonlara. Do any of you have any<br/>
 experience with them that you could share with us. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Kyle and Paula,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is our first year with Clonlara and with home schooling.  They have <br/>
been an enormous support and we are planning on continuing.  They do have an <br/>
unschooling bent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the midst of a lot of things here  and am not online too much.  My <br/>
husband&#39;s sister passed away last week and I have a serious, and of yet, <br/>
undiagnosed problem with my leg.  If you have specific questions which I <br/>
might attempt to answer, please e-mail me and I&#39;ll do my best.<br/>
