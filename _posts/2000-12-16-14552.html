<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951841572">Hi, I&#39;m Kara Bauer. I&#39;m a sah, bf&#39;ing, ap&#39;ing, hs&#39;ing momma to Drew <br/>
(2.5+) and Derek (15 mon)- they are the light of my life.<br/>
We have only recently found unschooling. I knew I wanted to <br/>
homeschool, but we meet other homeschoolers who were unschooling, and <br/>
at first I didn&#39;t believe. But then everytime I tried to teach Drew <br/>
something, he would balk, and fight it with everything he had and we <br/>
would both end up frusterated. So then we started just letting him do <br/>
what he wanted and he is learning all kinds of new things. Now Derek <br/>
is starting to pick up books and tell me what the objects are and I <br/>
just sit back in amazement!<br/>
It&#39;s nice to meet you all,<br/>
Kara</div>
