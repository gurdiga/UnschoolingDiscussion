<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok, but if I weren&#39;t a Bible literalist, how would I know what to<br/>
&gt; believe?  How would I know if I should believe in heaven or God at<br/>
&gt; all?  And would I even be able to call myself a Christian anymore,<br/>
&gt; because what would I know to be true about Christ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You call yourself a Christian because you believe Jesus to be the Christ,<br/>
the son of God.  That&#39;s all you need to know to be true about Christ to be<br/>
Christian, and many people are faithful Christians without believing every<br/>
word of the Bible to be literally true.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways that we receive information about the world.  Not all of<br/>
it is from writing and books, some things you know because you have felt<br/>
them.  There is nothing written that tells you that you are in love with<br/>
another person; you simply know that because of how you feel.  In this way,<br/>
if you have felt God&#39;s love, then you have certainty in your heart about<br/>
what you believe.<br/>
<br/>
Part of unschooling is letting our children learn by experience.  They can&#39;t<br/>
read about fire being hot and understand without having experienced its<br/>
heat.  No matter how many times we tell them about it, they won&#39;t get it.<br/>
If you have experienced God&#39;s presence in worship or prayer, then that<br/>
confirms what you believe.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I don&#39;t take scripture to be literal, I still learn a lot about God<br/>
from what the Bible tells me.  Here&#39;s a non-bibilcal example of that: the<br/>
story of George Washington chopping down the cherry tree and admitting to<br/>
his father that he did it.  This is not believed to be an historic event,<br/>
but it does reveal him as a man of integrity.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, one of the great scripture scholars, Raymond Brown, wrote the<br/>
following in reference to the two differing versions of the story of the<br/>
Nativity found in Matthew and Luke&#39;s gospels:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our Christmas pageants usually combine the two stories, but when biblical<br/>
scholars attempt to reconcile the conflicting material they can&#39;t.  We might<br/>
do better to recognize that the Holy Spirit was content to give us two<br/>
different accounts and that the way to interpret them faithfully is to treat<br/>
them separately.  Not try to force a harmony out of some mistaken notion<br/>
that if scripture is inspired it has to be historical as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I like that last sentence.<br/>
