<div id="ygrps-yiv-235850341">How have you dealt with this? Especially with the Internet and a <br/>
family computer... (Btw, the safe guards don&#39;t really work for <br/>
people who know how to get around them so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll <br/>
use that method.)<br/>
<br/>
At this time we&#39;ve simply made it clear that we know the intrigue <br/>
is normal but we don&#39;t want it on our computers at home. But <br/>
how would we enforce that anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that you CAN &quot;enforce&quot; that. It&#39;s all about talk and trust.<br/>
<br/>
What really burns ME up is the AOL and MSN commercials that say to trust <br/>
THEM. The &quot;parents&quot; have NO trust AT ALL in their children! And they imply <br/>
that all children are completely untrustworthy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot is going to depend how curious they are to begin with. Some people are<br/>
more naturally hormonally charged and thus more curious than others.<br/>
<br/>
And think about it this way: Boys tend to be more visual. Girls tend to be<br/>
more verbal. Girls can read bodice busters to get their curiosity<br/>
satisified. But boys get their curiosity blocked because there isn&#39;t any<br/>
acceptable &quot;pornography&quot; for boys.<br/>
<br/>
Are pictures of naked women or even people having sex worse than reading<br/>
about 16 yos being raped repeatedly and then falling in love with their<br/>
massively muscled, large membered rapists? (If you&#39;ve never read one the sex<br/>
is *very* graphic. Flowery language, but nothing is left to the imagination.<br/>
It&#39;s how *I* figured out the details about sex that no one felt I needed to<br/>
know at 15 ;-) They didn&#39;t lead to anything other than more books until I<br/>
met my future husband at 22.) And any girl can pick one up at any age<br/>
without most people even batting an eye. But boys don&#39;t have anything even<br/>
close to that.<br/>
<br/>
If you say no, you&#39;re creating a forbidden fruit situation.<br/>
<br/>
When we forbid something they really want and that stops them from<br/>
mentioning it, then it feels like we&#39;ve stopped them from wanting it. But<br/>
what we&#39;ve done is told them they can&#39;t be honest about what they need with<br/>
us. So they&#39;ll go to someone else or somewhere else. Perhaps someone or<br/>
somewhere we&#39;d rather they didn&#39;t go to.<br/>
