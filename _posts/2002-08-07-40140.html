<div id="ygrps-yiv-108361826">&lt;&lt;only if I know where it came from&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids started raising goats for 4-H.  I have been horrified to find out<br/>
how the animals are treated.  Goats are browsers, enjoying leaves, bark, all<br/>
kinds of weeds and grains.<br/>
<br/>
In order to &quot;win&quot; at the shows, the kids are encouraged to only feed their<br/>
goats concentrated pellets, nothing else, which give the animals &quot;grain<br/>
overload&quot; and must be vaccinated against.  Animals are kept in small pens so<br/>
intestinal worm overload becomes a problem so in with another chemical to<br/>
kill the worms.<br/>
<br/>
To build muscle, the goats are placed on a track and chased by a dog or a<br/>
person on a four-wheeler.  I was sick about it but glad to know that dd<br/>
would rather not win than to purposefully terrify her animals.<br/>
<br/>
We raise our animals as holistically as possible.  We don&#39;t always win but<br/>
at least I can look at myself in the mirror.<br/>
