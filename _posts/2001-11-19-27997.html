<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045457969">For those who have been looking for an option when it comes to soft drinks<br/>
and can&#39;t or don&#39;t choose to go the refined sugar or chemical way, Hanson&#39;s<br/>
now has a dye-free diet soda out that is made with stefia (is that spelled<br/>
right?).  Voila, no chemicals (aspertame or sacharine), no red, yellow or<br/>
blue dyes, no sodium, no preservatives AND it has passed the kidlet taste<br/>
test!<br/>
<br/>
Youngest discovered it this evening when we were deciding what to buy for<br/>
our &quot;home theater (vcr and rented movies &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
