<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822609519">Hi Family and Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to pass on this link to an article on our daughter, Rebekah, who just won the Northeast Regional Debate Championship held last Saturday at Bristol Community College.  For those that don&#39;t know Rebekah, she was homeschooled from age 9 until she was 16 when she entered BCC to study American Sign Language and Deaf Culture.  We are very proud of her and wanted to pass on this great article!!  Thank you!<br/>
