<br/>
You could try for an enlightened self-interest approach, maybe.  Tell him he <br/>
will get his way more if he allows other people to feel, sometimes, that <br/>
they&#39;re getting their way.  <br/>
<br/>
I have two stories.   One is Kirby, who is often the most sparkly, <br/>
knowledgeable and verbal guy in a conversation.  After noting a few times <br/>
that one person or another was feeling unable to get into the exchange, I got <br/>
a chance to be alone with Kirby (driving him to karate) and said I thing X <br/>
was uncomfortable yesterday, because the conversation was moving so fast and <br/>
so focussed on you.  Maybe part of being a good host is trying to draw <br/>
everyone into the conversation.  You&#39;re so interesting it&#39;s hard for them to <br/>
compete.  Don&#39;t hog the air.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One other time I just said &quot;Don&#39;t breathe more than your share of the air&quot; <br/>
and he backed down from the spotlight and listened to the others.<br/>
<br/>
The other story is older, but involves a club&#39;s politics.  I learned this <br/>
trick on my own, and have passed it on to others with good results.  When <br/>
clubs or projects are running by consensus and group effort, it can happen <br/>
that one person is getting his way a lot, not because he&#39;s a bully, but <br/>
because his ideas are good and workable.  Still, no matter how workable, <br/>
there is an overlay in this society of taking turns and sharing, and <br/>
equality.  So at some point someone will say &quot;Well, Mark (to use a real <br/>
example &lt;g&gt;) has gotten his way the last five times, so let&#39;s let Kathryn (to <br/>
use a similar real name from the early situations) run it her way this time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It appeases Kathryn, but is it good for the group?  <br/>
<br/>
And they won&#39;t really SAY &quot;You&#39;ve maxed out your quota of influence, so your <br/>
ideas will be rejected until you&#39;re back to acceptable levels.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So the way for that person to get the good ideas accepted is to plant them in <br/>
other people.  Either give them away so they can be presented by others who <br/>
know they were your ideas but who will accept credit just for the sake of <br/>
getting the idea accepted, or putting it into the mind of a more selfish, <br/>
susceptible, needy person who WANTS to have his way, and just needed a good <br/>
idea to run with.  <br/>
<br/>
This can work two ways with a battering-ram of a kid.  You can teach him that <br/>
trick.  Or you can use that trick on him.  If he&#39;s not going to take your <br/>
advice one more time, get someone else to drop a factoid or suggestion or a <br/>
&quot;y&#39;know...&quot; his way.  If they come from various places, he can&#39;t &quot;ignore <br/>
mom.&quot;  And when he&#39;s old enough to KNOW he wants his own way and to be <br/>
analytical about it, you could say &quot;If you want to go to the movie you want <br/>
to go to, convince one of the other kids to want to go to it and to propose <br/>
it as HIS choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A criticism of this is that it&#39;s teaching a child to be manipulative, but <br/>
manipulation by another name is...  management.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s already BEING manipulative, teaching him to do it gently and <br/>
unselfishly and convincing him (honestly) that it will up his stock and <br/>
popularity is a kindness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440209253">Okay, I have lifted the TV restrictions and the kids are watching lots and lots of TV/videos as I expected they would. I am having trouble not feeling guilty.  I guess I feel like I am not doing anything and I am not used to feeling this way.<br/>
<br/>
 Sandra has talked about strewing their path with interesting things which I try to do but I don&#39;t know whether to ask if they would like to play a game or do a puzzle etc instead of watching TV or just let them be for a few months to get used to the freedom of having the TV available. <br/>
<br/>
What can I do to alleviate feeling like I am not doing enough for them? Hmmm, I suppose I could do more with them even if it means watching The Magic School Bus for the tenth time. Aargh!<br/>

or do a puzzle etc instead of watching TV or just let them be for a few <br/>
months to get used to the freedom of having the TV available.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d do some of both, but I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Do you want to do a puzzle instead <br/>
of watching TV?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe get a puzzle out on a table in another room and just lay the pieces <br/>
out.  See who bites.  If nobody, put it back up later, or work the border and <br/>
leave it easy for people to wander by and add to, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be scheduled or agreed to in advance or done all in one <br/>
pass.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What can I do to alleviate feeling like I am not doing enough for them? <br/>
Hmmm, I suppose I could do more with them even if it means watching The Magic <br/>
School Bus for the tenth time. Aargh!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What about finding something you do want to watch that they would want to wat<br/>
ch too?  If they&#39;re liking a particular Magic Schoolbus, can you find <br/>
something that&#39;s related to the topic?   And casually set it out or print <br/>
something out and tape it inside the bathroom door where you know they&#39;ll be <br/>
sitting sometime soon?<br/>
<br/>
If in some connect-the-dots fashion you find another point or two related to <br/>
what they&#39;re doing, you&#39;ll be where they are to some degree and maybe not <br/>
feel too guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Probably they&#39;ll lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
What about adding things to where they are?  Even if they&#39;re obsessed with <br/>
the repetition of one video, what about bringing Lego or food or laundry to <br/>
fold or something into that room?<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are really liking a movie and there&#39;s a good soundtrack, I try <br/>
to get one.  Sometimes I find them used at thriftstores.  That&#39;s how I got <br/>
Stand By Me on a cassette.  And I cycle those around.  Sometimes in the car, <br/>
sometimes in Holly&#39;s room, sometimes back in the closet for a year or two.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Let them go...how long has it been so far? Still offer other alternatives<br/>
but do not put pressure on them to *not* choose tv (that was the mistake<br/>
I made when giving up food restrictions...he had the ultimate choice but <br/>
I was still making his choice seem like the &quot;bad&quot; one. One way to help<br/>
with this (also helps you to see the benefit of tv) is to watch it with<br/>
them. Then you are interacting and enjoying it with them. I remember<br/>
feeling guilty when I watched with them (thinking that if they were watching<br/>
tv I should be cleaning or something). Now I realize that it is time well<br/>
spent enjoying something fun with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t forget you can do both? Lots of times I out a puzzle or game and <br/>
leave the tv while we play. SOmetimes we just play and ignore the tv, sometimes <br/>
they start playing and then something catches their interest on the tv and <br/>
we stop. Now that we have de-tved the boys often are finding their own things<br/>
to do while the tv is on (gone are the days of being glued to the tube!). And<br/>
I have also found that if what is on is not that interesting, they have absolutely<br/>
no problem with me turning it off. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there! It is also good that spring is coming...I have found that as the <br/>
weather gets nicer they are watching less (their choice which is nice!). Seems <br/>
natural that way.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there. It can be hard at first letting go of that tv is evil thing...but speaking<br/>
as one who has been there it is worth letting go. :o)<br/>

conversation at the same time.  I can&#39;t do anything that requires any <br/>
concentration at all while watching a show.  I can fold laundry and <br/>
straighten up, but I can&#39;t put a puzzle together.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids do all kinds of things at the same time they&#39;re watching tv!  <br/>
My daughter can actually read a book and watch a tv show at the same <br/>
time, and take them both in.  That amazes me.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she&#39;ll ask me to play a game with her while she watches a <br/>
tv show.  I&#39;ll play the game with her but more often than not I have <br/>
no idea what is happening on the tv show, because my concentration is <br/>
on one thing at a time.  Either the game or the tv, but not both at <br/>
once!  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if maybe it&#39;s because she has unlimited tv that she can do <br/>
that.  Or maybe it&#39;s just a difference in the way our brains work. <br/>

<br/>
Try to find your own passion.  Try new things. You will be modeling behavior <br/>

NOT at all trying to be cantankerous or get any debate started, this is <br/>
merely a question that I&#39;m hoping someone can answer for me to help me be a <br/>
better unschooling mom.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, the question, several days ago I asked how I could expose my daughter to <br/>
some learning adventures, something she might find fun and even be math <br/>
related ( I got some really GOOD ideas and thanks to those of you who helped <br/>
me out), but I also got told I was WRONG, totally wrong for buying a computer <br/>
game and leaving it for my daughter to play or not play, no expectations.  <br/>
That I shouldn&#39;t even be sending her links that I think are interesting, too <br/>
much pressure, too many expectations, not unschooling, were the remarks that <br/>
I got in response.<br/>
<br/>
Which is it?  Do we OFFER things we think our children might find interesting <br/>
or do we just wait for them to come to US with their questions about <br/>
something, then find out interesting things to do with their inquiry?<br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank whoever sent the idea about the zoombini computer games. <br/>
 Cait has had great fun with it for a few days now.  She doesn&#39;t even have a <br/>
clue it&#39;s anything but about FUN and that&#39;s so wonderful to me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me clarify the unschooling principal <br/>
of either offering a child an opportunity or waiting for the child to ask for <br/>
one.<br/>

<br/>
We definitely should be making things available. But maybe ask yourself are<br/>
you offering it because it&#39;s something they might be interested in or<br/>
because you think it would be a good way of getting them from where they are<br/>
to where you think they should be?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think in your case the advice was *because* your daughter had expressed a<br/>
disinterest in math.  She didn&#39;t want to do it.  The suggestions people are<br/>
giving in the TV question are more or less neutral things, just some<br/>
alternatives to TV.  If math had never been an issue with your daughter, it<br/>
would have been fine to leave the CD around (assuming you have the money to<br/>
buy CDs that might not get used.  I would get it from the library first, but<br/>
maybe your library doesn&#39;t have them.)<br/>

to do math.  It wasn&#39;t because she was totally interested in Geometry and you <br/>
were trying to find something to help her with her questions.  Weren&#39;t you <br/>
trying to get her interested in math to help her with medical school?  I was <br/>
thinking it wasn&#39;t her idea at all, the math I mean.  Getting a Math CD ROM <br/>
isn&#39;t in itself a bad thing to do as long as she has the option to put it <br/>
aside and never look at it.  It goes with all the other CD ROMs.  If I am <br/>
mixing you up with someone else please fill me in.  I think a lot has to do <br/>
with the whys you are doing things, not always the whats.  Was the math CD <br/>
ROM and book done to offer her something you really believe she is into or <br/>
interested in at the time? Something interesting and fun.<br/>

for.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we&#39;re going to the park, Wednesday we&#39;re meeting Bob and Sue at the <br/>
art place. Thursday I&#39;m going to plant some tomatoes. Friday we&#39;re going to <br/>
the beach---whatever<br/>

awaiting the next &quot;event&quot; as opposed to (while they&#39;re really into playing <br/>
Leggos or watching TV) saying, &quot;OK, who wants to go to the museum?&quot; If they <br/>
know YOU&#39;re going today at 10:00, it&#39;s easier to &quot;get in the mood&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan always likes to hear what&#39;s planned (or not) for tomorrow when I&#39;m <br/>
tucking him in at night. Sometimes we don&#39;t make our plans until he&#39;s going <br/>
to bed---as he brushes his teeth or after reading. Most are made in advance, <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Not that we don&#39;t do many things on the spur of the moment, but it&#39;s often <br/>
easier to get everyone out the door when they know what&#39;s happening a few <br/>
days before.<br/>

learn math? Or because it&#39;ll be something she&#39;d enjoy? Is it because it&#39;s &quot;ed<br/>

least bit pressured to &quot;perform&quot;?<br/>

If your daughter has an interest in medicine, surround her with related <br/>
things to pick up WHEN she wants to. (Microscope, Gray&#39;s Anatomy, <br/>
Candy-striping) But be willing to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. There should be no <br/>

Depends.  What did you find?  How are you offering it?  What are your <br/>
expectations?<br/>
It is neither just one thing nor the other, and in any division of the world <br/>
into JUST two things, you&#39;re creating a probably false dichotomy.  Somewhere <br/>
is the right place between the extreme positions, and where YOUR right place <br/>
is depends on your own personal priorities.<br/>

I offer things to my kids, and they ask me questions, and I find them <br/>

<br/>
As an unschooling parent, I always make sure to supply whatever I can to my<br/>
children when they show an interest in something. Whether that&#39;s books,<br/>
movies, games, trips or conversation, etc. That&#39;s all based on their<br/>
interests. Aside from that, I also find things that come up that may just<br/>
interest them also, without them thinking about it. Just like I would say,<br/>
&quot;hey there&#39;s a new movie coming out about______, do you want to go and see<br/>
it?&quot; I would also ask if they are interested in swimming class or baseball<br/>
or whatever. The decision is always there. Sometimes they come up with<br/>
things and sometimes I do. If I get a notion that it&#39;s a beautiful day for<br/>
the park, I&#39;ll ask. If they want to go, we&#39;re there. If not, we stay put. I<br/>
never push, in any way, any of the above mentioned issues. Not movies,<br/>
sports ,math, reading or anything. But I see asking to go to the park or<br/>
swimming as much different than asking if we could do some math today.<br/>
<br/>
The flack you got about your daughter had to do with math. YOU are, or were<br/>
convinced that she HAS to have math to do what she wants. She wasn&#39;t<br/>
interested at all. Not when you suggested computer programs, not when you<br/>
suggested to google it. She seemed to be saying no to you about math on more<br/>
than one occasion. You even said you had to go on about how she needed it.<br/>
That&#39;s the difference in what the others are talking about here. As long as<br/>
no one says, &quot;you really NEED to go to the park with me or you NEED to stop<br/>
watching tv or even why don&#39;t you stop doing that and find something else to<br/>
do for awhile&quot; then suggesting when an interest could be there is great.<br/>
It&#39;s pushing when no interest exists that is harmful.<br/>

We have a really old house with a 80sqm living area recently added on to the<br/>

My daughter can actually read a book and watch a tv show at the same <br/>

<br/>
I have always read better when the tv or radio is on. It&#39;s like I have to have something to block out to really get into what I&#39;m reading. I used to beg my mom to let me have the tv on to do my homework, she never would, I was never able to finish my homework. I just couldn&#39;t concentrate on it, my mind would wonder and the next thing I knew it was hours later and I hadn&#39;t gotten anything done.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My question was sort of two fold about the math.  I, personally, was <br/>
concerned that I might not be opening enough doors for her to have a love of <br/>
math like some of the children here have.  Obviously at some point SOMETHING <br/>
interested them enough to nurture the desire and love of math.  I was looking <br/>
for something that might foster that love and learning.<br/>
<br/>
I was concerned as a parent that by my just shrugging off her not picking up <br/>
anything &quot;mathy&quot; on her own to look at that I might be doing a disservice to <br/>
her later in life if she at some point (i.e., college) needed to be <br/>
knowledgeable about it.  I didn&#39;t want her to HATE it when it became a <br/>
necessity IF it does.<br/>
<br/>
I got some great answers about that and it more than reassured me that she <br/>
can easily pick it up when she truly needs it and is motivated to have it in <br/>
her life.<br/>
<br/>
But the part about sending her links or purchasing a computer program and <br/>
leaving them around I thought I understood where things NOT to do.  Just wait <br/>
until she actually asks about something or shows an interest THEN offer <br/>
whatever you can.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone just said that park day or a movie is different than math.  <br/>
But I WANT it to be no different, I don&#39;t want her to think of math as <br/>
something other than another cool learning experience and something to be <br/>
explored.  That was really the root of the questioning and I didn&#39;t know how <br/>
to go about that and if I were really doing her any favors by just ignoring <br/>
her &quot;educational needs&quot;.  You all soothed my soul on that issue and I&#39;m <br/>
completely comfortable with her finding it in her own time.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the zoombini games, I played them myself, she saw them and she began <br/>
to play along.  So she enjoyed that for a bit.  I&#39;m not sure how long it will <br/>
last.  But I was torn at that thought too.  Was I purchasing something and <br/>
laying it by the computer without her asking for it something I shouldn&#39;t do?<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn&#39;t an exposure, experience with math be just as much an adventure as a <br/>
beautiful day in the park?  Maybe I&#39;m just wishing and hoping and it really <br/>
can&#39;t be that way.<br/>
<br/>
So the short answer is expose them to as much as possible if they don&#39;t show <br/>
an interest in it then they don&#39;t but it&#39;s ok as long as you don&#39;t ask them <br/>
if they want to do ___________?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the helpful advice you have offered.<br/>

&lt;&lt; ( I got some really GOOD ideas and thanks to those of you who helped <br/>
 me out), but I also got told I was WRONG, totally wrong for buying a <br/>
computer <br/>
 game and leaving it for my daughter to play or not play, no expectations.  <br/>
 That I shouldn&#39;t even be sending her links that I think are interesting, too <br/>
 much pressure, too many expectations, not unschooling, were the remarks that <br/>
 I got in response. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not true at ALL.<br/>
We said that we DO send our kids links and buy interesting games and such, <br/>
but NOT after they&#39;ve expressed no interest in said topic.<br/>
You were sending links and trying to GET your dd interested in something she <br/>
clearly did not want.<br/>
We were advising against that and instead focusing on the things she IS <br/>
interested in.<br/>
Huge difference.<br/>
I don&#39;t see how on earth you came to the above conclusion.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>But I guess it seemed like a catch 22 to me.  How would she/I KNOW if she <br/>
were interested in anything that was great fun and involved math if even I <br/>
didn&#39;t know what that might be?<br/>
<br/>
She has never said I hate algebra, I don&#39;t want to do it, I&#39;m not interested. <br/>
 I think maybe once again I wasn&#39;t clear.<br/>
<br/>
It was MY FEARS that I wasn&#39;t doing enough to expose her to any higher math.  <br/>
That I was AFRAID it was up to me to introduce her and I wasn&#39;t really <br/>
because I didn&#39;t know a way to incorporate it into daily stuff.  I said I had <br/>
bought an Algebra CD Rom and she hadn&#39;t picked it up, but she hadn&#39;t said she <br/>
didn&#39;t like it either.  For all I know she hadn&#39;t even noticed it.<br/>
<br/>
I was really looking for assurance that I didn&#39;t NEED to do anything about <br/>
bringing up the algebra and to know what others did that helped their <br/>
children foster a love of math.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like unschooling if you never heard of it, how do you know you want it?  <br/>
If you never tried Godiva chocolate ice cream and no one mentioned it, you <br/>
would be really missing out.  (if you like chocolate ice cream of course, but <br/>
if you never tried it, you might not even know you DO like it)<br/>
<br/>
But I do get the idea of not pushing any one particular thing if they are not <br/>
interested.  I didn&#39;t/don&#39;t.  That was what I was worried about.  Could it be <br/>
a good thing if I just let it go as I had been doing.  I got the reassurances <br/>
that I needed that math is not this great mystery that must be learned in <br/>
layers throughout the learning years.  I was reassured I was NOT neglecting <br/>
what she could/might need in a few short years for college.<br/>
<br/>
I also got some great websites and ideas for really fun things to introduce, <br/>
THANKS.<br/>
<br/>
I might actually get better at this one day, although I think it&#39;s working <br/>
pretty well already.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think you are referring to something I said. It was going on the<br/>
assunption that most children love the movies or park. From what you<br/>
described, your daughter was not liking math and was not interested in<br/>
having to like it. You said she needed it, she knew you said she needed and<br/>
she still wasn&#39;t interested. If my child said they really didn&#39;t like to go<br/>
to the park, I wouldn&#39;t drive by once a week saying look how much fun<br/>
everyone is having. I wouldn&#39;t tell them that as a child, they really should<br/>
like the park and I wouldn&#39;t ask them, even once a week if they wanted to<br/>
go. I&#39;m not saying you did all those things but I&#39;m stressing the point so<br/>
you see the difference.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t stress needing math, the child will find it abundantly every<br/>
day in whatever it is she is interested in at the moment. Pointing it out<br/>
makes it all back fire. I mean pointing it out before they find it. Once<br/>
they enjoy it so much in their interest, you can say, see, that&#39;s math!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814751974"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Ok, the question, several days ago I asked how I could expose my daughter <br/>
&gt;&gt;to some learning adventures, something she might find fun and even be math <br/>
&gt;&gt;related ( I got some really GOOD ideas and thanks to those of you who <br/>
&gt;&gt;helped me out), but I also got told I was WRONG, totally wrong for buying <br/>
&gt;&gt;a computer game and leaving it for my daughter to play or not play, no <br/>
&gt;&gt;expectations.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was a different scenario completely than the current situation. If I <br/>
remember, Glena, you had declared that your daughter &quot;needed&quot; to learn math <br/>
and you were looking for ways to get her interested. People here were <br/>
pointing out that that isn&#39;t the best way to get to an unschooling frame of <br/>
mind. We need to let go of the idea that our kids &quot;need&quot; to learn school <br/>
defined subjects on a timetable. The idea was that you should take the math <br/>
pressure off completely and help your daughter explore other things that she <br/>
is interested in right now. So the difference was in your intent.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Which is it?  Do we OFFER things we think our children might find <br/>
&gt;&gt;interesting or do we just wait for them to come to US with their questions <br/>
&gt;&gt;about something, then find out interesting things to do with their <br/>
&gt;&gt;inquiry?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both. But getting rid of *our* schooly expectations is always the first <br/>
step. Always work towards engaging your child&#39;s mind, not fufilling a <br/>
perceived future need.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me clarify the unschooling <br/>
&gt;&gt;principal of either offering a child an opportunity or waiting for the <br/>
&gt;&gt;child to ask for one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not an either/or situation. Think in terms of fun and engaging, and <br/>
forget about terms like math and science. If fun and engaging are the goals <br/>
of the day, then strew, suggest and join in. :o)<br/>

math CAN be learned when one is ready and I&#39;m not going to cause her to hate <br/>
