<div id="ygrps-yiv-699103792">&lt;&lt; Would you agree that boys have something inside them<br/>
 that makes them aggressive and rowdy that most girls<br/>
 just don&#39;t have. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  Some boys are naturally more aggressive and rowdy than some girls,<br/>
but some boys are naturally calm and quiet and some girls are aggressive<br/>
and rowdy.  I heard once that a Native American tribe had 6 words for<br/>
gender, compared to our 2 (male & female).  However, we will probably<br/>
never determine how much of male vs female is nature vs nurture, because<br/>
studies have shown that it is common for people to treat boys and girls<br/>
differently from birth, and even in the womb.  So any study of children<br/>
that proves inherent differences will be flawed, because those children<br/>
will have already been affected by nurture.  Even if you treat your boy<br/>
and girl identically, others whom they interact with will not.<br/>
