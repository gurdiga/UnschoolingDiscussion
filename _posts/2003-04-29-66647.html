&lt;&lt; It&#39;s not that it doesn&#39;t make sense, its that many of the ideas seem <br/>
contradictory to ME.  Then I ask about them, when I ask why this and not <br/>
this, no one really gives an answer, they get defensive and just say I don&#39;t <br/>
get it! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not being defensive.  We are openly and repeatedly writing things we <br/>
have written before for YOUR benefit, we&#39;re responding to YOU, and you&#39;re not <br/>
being gracious or courteous or showing any appreciation for the gift you&#39;re <br/>
being given.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how you can show that you really want to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
Do not ever again, not even once say &quot;I get it.&quot;<br/>
Not even when and if you eventually get it.  (You haven&#39;t yet.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ever again, not even a little, tell us that asking questions is the way <br/>
to learn.<br/>
It only helps if you&#39;re being still and listening to the answers and then <br/>
going out and doing what the answers recommended that you do.<br/>
