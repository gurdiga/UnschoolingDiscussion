<div id="ygrps-yiv-487260197">How long? About a year. Unfortunatly, I didn&#39;t understand her learning<br/>
style. I tried Saxon at first with wrap-ups for practice. Then I noticed<br/>
she could answer the &quot;harder&quot; questions but would fail miserably in<br/>
drill. We went to the library and she picked out an &quot;I Love Math&quot; series<br/>
book....she would pick and chose. <br/>
She also likes the Math &quot;trick&quot; books. They are fairly reasonable at<br/>
Book Close-outs. She also likes to draw using rulers/protractor/compass.<br/>
In other words, if I had just let her &quot;unschool&quot; and follow her natural<br/>
ability (to start with) it probably would have been an immediate change!<br/>
