<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Well at least you bought it and you aren&#39;t renting! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico there&#39;s a tradition of painting the bottom half of a room a <br/>
different color, or just repainting that part, and sometimes up and around a <br/>
door.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s common in plastered-house cultures or not.   But maybe <br/>
you could do that.  Paint over where they&#39;ve torn, in some artistic-sense <br/>
way, with an edge between the paint and the wallpaper they can&#39;t get to.  <br/>
<br/>
They make corner-keeper things out of plastic, like molding for corners.  <br/>
Maybe you could get some of that for the kitchen corner.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe save all your cardboard boxes that have corrugated cardboard with a <br/>
glossy-printed outside paper, and let them peel and peel and peel!  <br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s rats like to peel cardboard. <br/>
I like to peel cardboard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-362705872">Your kids are so young, probably too young to really be able to <br/>
resist doing something as fun as peeling wallpaper for the sake of <br/>
some nebulous goal like &quot;keeping the house looking nice&quot;. I&#39;m with <br/>
the person who said they&#39;d help peel it all off and then paint. but <br/>
then, I&#39;m not a wallpaper person either :-) Short of doing that, it&#39;s <br/>
like anything else at this age that you don&#39;t want them to get into, <br/>
you either have to find a way to make it impossible or you have to <br/>
supervise them while they&#39;re around it. They&#39;re not at the ages, and <br/>
might not be for awhile, where you can expect their impulse control <br/>
to stop them from it. You might also think about offering some <br/>
similar sensory experiences as distractions. My daughter really likes <br/>
me to put Elmer&#39;s glue on her hands and then she can peel it off. <br/>
Tearing paper into strips is also fun, or peeling cardboard apart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985499265">Ripped wallpaper *can* be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s just a small tear, use thin elmers glue (don&#39;t gob it on!) and <br/>
smooth the edges.  If it&#39;s vinyl wallpaper, sometimes you can tape the <br/>
ripped edges together while the glue is drying - but if it&#39;s thinner or <br/>
less-scrubbable wallpaper, the tape will peel off the top layer of paper, <br/>
making a bigger mess.  Be careful.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a big piece of wallpaper that was peeled and you don&#39;t have spare <br/>
samples of the wallpaper out in the garage to repair the full strip, then <br/>
you have to do a little more.  Smooth the scrap so it doesn&#39;t <br/>
curl.  Thin-elmers the entire back of the scrap and paste it carefully back <br/>
on the wall.  If you&#39;re lucky, the wallpaper will be colored and the scrap <br/>
edges will show white.  This is where you get crafty.<br/>
<br/>
When the scrap is dried and adhered to the wall (a couple of days?), grab a <br/>
(watercolor) marker with a very fine tip (get some nice ones!) and <br/>
color-match.  If you don&#39;t have quite the right color, go a little <br/>
lighter.  Lightly color in that white edge.  The secret is to do a good job <br/>
color matching the paper!<br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful paperhanger who showed me that bacon-saving <br/>
technique.  He carries a whole pallette of different watercolor <br/>
artist-quality markers.  I&#39;ve repaired kid-dings in all of my wallpaper&#39;d <br/>
rooms.  Honestly, you can&#39;t pick out the damage.<br/>
<br/>
Take your time and relax.  Think of it as an arts and crafts project!  (grin)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209930635">If it is worth fixing...if the paper is coming up that easily, and was already peeling off in lots of places, perhaps it has come to the end of it&#39;s useful life. What about using it as a drawing board and then pulling it up. Of course if it then sticks you have to steam it off or risk dammage to the wall. <br/>
<br/>
Of course that is home decorating instead of gentle parenting advice. ;) With Jayn painting on the wall and cupboards in the bathroom, I decided the conflict wasn&#39;t worth it. I clean it periodically, and we will repaint before we move (renters). However I did ask her to restrict her painting to the one place - the bathroom - and not to paint on the unfinished wood, explaining why. So far she has been so happy to paint in one place, that she has not gone anywhere else. Also she loves to help me clean, scrubbing with a nail brush and rinsing with a wet cloth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had a couple similar situations... most recently, the paint in a <br/>
place we lived prior peeled off in sheets.  I ended up peeling right <br/>
along with the kids.  It&#39;s very addictive.  All was well in the <br/>
end.  The former paintjob was still there.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
As for wallpaper- we owned a house some years ago in VA.  We had a <br/>
blast peeling the wallpaper... then we repainted.  The kids had a <br/>
whole wall with which they could do anything they wanted.  Give them <br/>
some paint and paintbrushes and let them go nuts.  Maybe they could <br/>
even paint over and update every few months... I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
Fortunately, you don&#39;t like the wallpaper anyway, do what you can to <br/>
make it fun.  Once it&#39;s gone there won&#39;t be anything to peel?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-56306172">I&#39;ve peeled a lot of wallpaper in my time.  Sometimes, but not <br/>
always, a strong solution of either vinegar or fabric softener will <br/>
help.  As far as repainting, when my kids were really little (well <br/>
littler) and we were renting they were happy to paint water onto the <br/>
walls with a small brush -- it&#39;s &quot;magic paint&quot; that turns the same <br/>
color as whatever you paint it. <br/>

we moved in.  Dark paneling and bright, vivid, eye-watering blue wallpaper,<br/>
bathtub, sink, toilet and tile.  Dh about barfed.<br/>
<br/>
When we took off the wallpaper and paneling, the walls had no texture.  Dh<br/>
got the texture you put on ceilings and we slathered the walls with it with<br/>
a trowel.  Then we painted the walls a creamy yellow and sponged on a misty<br/>
green.  It is a lovely room.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I saw something really cool in a decorating magazine, i *think* it <br/>
was Martha Stewart but not sure. I got the mag at Home Depot a week <br/>
or two ago. You can get lots and lots of pegboard (i think thats what <br/>
its called...like you&#39;d find tools hanging on in a garage), paint it <br/>
cool funky colors, or whatever color goes with the room, and cover <br/>
the walls (or part of a wall)with it. They showed a kitchen, and had <br/>
baskets hanging on the pegboard to hold kitchen supplies, food like <br/>
onions or potatoes, etc. The one in the bathroom had baskets hanging <br/>
to hold towels and a mesh bag with bath toys. The coolest one was for <br/>
a family room, and they displayed kids&#39; artwork on it. All <br/>
changeable, very versatile and would hide an ugly wall. I can&#39;t wait <br/>
to to this when i get my own place. And you can always take it down <br/>
if you get sick of it. <br/>
<br/>
Just an idea! I never wouldve been able to have wallpaper when Seamus <br/>
was a toddler. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380929310">I&#39;m with all those who&#39;ve said peel it and paint instead. My kids are little<br/>
(6, 5 and 4) and my father in law thought I was nuts 3 years ago when I<br/>
refused to paint my walls with anything less than satin. But let me tell you<br/>
how easy those walls are to wipe down! Flat doesn&#39;t wipe at all. Satin picks<br/>
up the light and reflects it nicely, making the room appear a bit bigger,<br/>
though it does reveal imperfections more readily because of this.<br/>
<br/>
Why do the walls need to be textured? I&#39;m not sure what this really means.<br/>
Lots of plaster walls had no texture--the &quot;orange peel&quot; texture of walls in<br/>
newer houses is a pretty new thing. Or maybe it&#39;s a regional thing?<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I&#39;m totally anti-wallpaper unless you have some major problems<br/>
that need to be covered up. There are just so many really neat things that<br/>
can be done with paint these days. Check out the faux rough plaster finishes<br/>
if you&#39;re looking for some texture--those are pretty cool, especially when<br/>
done in Mediterranean colors.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In our house, the texture in the walls helps enormously with <br/>
acoustical dampening. We have high ceilings and an open floor plan. <br/>
The house tends to be noisy as it is, but the guy who built our house <br/>
says it&#39;s nothing like what it was like before they put the texture <br/>
on the walls, it absorbs a lot of noise. Unfortunately, ours is very <br/>
rough and also takes the skin off of our elbows on a regular basis. <br/>
You don&#39;t want to fall against one of our walls! It&#39;s also nearly <br/>
impossible to hammer a nail through, so there aren&#39;t many pictures <br/>
hanging up at our house, which is a bummer. If it was my decision, <br/>
I&#39;d have texture, but not one so rough!<br/>

&quot;The walls they are a-peeling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People do have the grooming instinct, and it&#39;s one of those <br/>
socially-incorrect instincts we try to extinguish.   My kids are good at finding ticks or scabs <br/>
on dogs and cats.  Holly likes to scratch my back and have hers scratched.  <br/>
She likes to paint her fingernails and then chip the polish back off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499619980">While I agree with much of what is being said here, I feel like I should <br/>
chime in on one point that bothers me.  I&#39;m all for having the kids help me <br/>
repair the damage, and I understand and agree that there is nothing wrong <br/>
with *their* reasons for what they did.  However, as much as I want to <br/>
believe that allowing them complete freedom to explore their wallpaper <br/>
peeling is this great project we can all go on together, when exactly do <br/>
they understand respect for other people&#39;s property?  I mean afterall, I <br/>
didn&#39;t like the wallpaper to begin with, right?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say this were someone else&#39;s home we were visiting?  In my home, when <br/>
the kids draw on the walls I can grab the Mr. Clean eraser and we can clean <br/>
it off together.  My family or friends probably won&#39;t feel like it&#39;s okay if <br/>
my kids do that in their homes.  This has actually happened before with a <br/>
marker at Grandma&#39;s house.  I&#39;m sorry but at some point there does come a <br/>
time when it&#39;s NOT ok for the kids to do whatever they wish in the name of <br/>
artistic expression, instinct or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
When I hear answers like this I have to wonder if these are just ideals that <br/>
some people here hold or things you actually practice in your home???  At <br/>
what point does it become important to you that you not have to choose <br/>
between having your walls look like shit and dad getting mad or spending <br/>
money to replace wallpaper or paint that you may or may not have on a <br/>
recurring basis?<br/>
<br/>
Some of the answers I&#39;ve read to this thread seem a bit lofty to me and <br/>
frankly, I have a hard time believing them, which is why I&#39;m asking thse <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem having my kids help me replace the wallpaper or paint the <br/>
wall, etc.  I do think there is something odd about just encouraging them to <br/>
tear up the walls in the entire house just because I don&#39;t like the <br/>
wallpaper and they think it&#39;s fun, interesting or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that they started this whole mess because there were a few places <br/>
where the wallpaper was bubbling away from the wall.  Chloe&#39;s only 19 months <br/>
old!  Then the boys see what fun it is and there ya go.  But I also know <br/>
that given a very similar situation, there is a very strong likelyhood that <br/>
the kids will now do this somehwere else.  It&#39;s happened before with drawing <br/>
on walls and pulling books off shelves.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that regardless of how I feel about the wallpaper...and I <br/>
DO hate it...we just bought this house two months ago and I want a house <br/>
that looks nice.  So does my husband, so do my older girls.  Is it really <br/>
okay (for those of you who said as much) with you to continue to buy <br/>
wallpaper?  Is it really okay with you if they tear things up in your house <br/>
because they like to peel things?  I mean, what if we were talking about a <br/>
child popping holes in the wall with a hammer because he likes to and he has <br/>
seen you hammering nails into the fence and decides he can try that out on <br/>
your living room wall...or your dinner plates, or your tv???<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really confused.<br/>

The reason I&#39;d have to texture the walls is there is nothing under the paper <br/>
but drywall paper.  Looks like a paper sack from the grocery store.  It <br/>
would be like putting up paper sacks and trying to paint them.  When they <br/>
had this house built they never painted, just put up wallpaper.  I&#39;m <br/>
definitely getting rid of it and painting but its going to be a huge job!<br/>
<br/>
I do like the stucco(?) idea for my kitchen.  I love the old world/tuscan <br/>
look that is so popular right now.  Not sure about my bathroom.  I may <br/>
actually end up repapering it and bathing the kids upstairs.  I really loved <br/>
the way my bathroom looks, even with the paper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935688380">I&#39;m trying to be sympathetic, honestly!  I just don&#39;t want my kids tearing <br/>
up the walls! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I think the only reason I haven&#39;t lost it is that I can think of several <br/>
examples of things I do like scratching at cradle cap or scratching off <br/>
those little pin dot scabs on my son&#39; head.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is while I understand, and I do, I also don&#39;t want this to be a <br/>
continual problem.  We&#39;ve been dealing with this for over a year now.  In <br/>
our last house (rented) they pulled the paper of their room and the kitchen. <br/>
  We put up wallpaper in their room SEVEN times.  (border actually).  I had <br/>
no choice because it was a rental.  When we moved out in April, they charged <br/>
us $796.49 to replace the kitchen paper!!  I kid you not!  So this isn&#39;t <br/>
just a one time thing and it&#39;s not cute anymore.  I like the idea of <br/>
offering the something they can tear up.  I&#39;ll have to try that.  Totally <br/>
forgot about the glue thing, too.  I used to LOVE to peel glue off my hands. <br/>
  Still do if I spill a little! :)<br/>

Jen - honestly, it has never mattered to me to have a really nice house.   We <br/>
built our house ourselves, and purposely bought most of the fixtures used, or <br/>
made them ourselves with rough wood or scraps.  There&#39;s almost nothing new in <br/>
our home, I shop at garage sales or out of the paper, and I accept things <br/>
people give me gladly.  I made up my mind a LONG time ago when we bought a brand <br/>
new couch and 2 days later my 1 year old (now 18) drew all over it with <br/>
crayon, that there will be a day when my house will be very clean, very neat, and <br/>
possibly a little more stylish (though I don&#39;t really care), but that time is <br/>
not now while I&#39;ve got kids in the home.  This attitude has helped tremendously <br/>
since we started doing foster care.  I&#39;d rather do my best to have it clean, <br/>
somewhat organized, and comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
Years ago I was good friends with a very conservative Mennonite family, and <br/>
ever since then, I&#39;ve never cared much about &quot;things&quot; or appearances.  Their <br/>
home was so plain, their furniture was old, but it was comfortable and clean.  I <br/>
admire St. Francis a lot, too, and his simplicity, and wish I could live my <br/>
life more like he did.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone in our home purposely destroyed something that belonged to someone <br/>
else, we would expect them to replace it, or fix it, as best they <br/>
can,...that&#39;s just kindness and caring.  We talk about how it makes each other feel when <br/>
we don&#39;t take care of something that belongs to someone else.  I guess if <br/>
someone punched a hole in a wall, I&#39;d have them patch it.  One of our kids tore <br/>
the side off a mattress, and I had them sew it back up with a needle and thread. <br/>
 I have a few keepsakes from my grandparents and parents that I keep put up.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know how to do that with a wall though!  I think I&#39;d get rid of the <br/>
wallpaper and put up washable paint.<br/>

I think you tend to get the &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;loftier&quot; answers suggested <br/>
because the people who had the lower answers, for example those who <br/>
&quot;lost it&quot; when their kids messed up walls are not proud of themselves <br/>
won&#39;t probably recommend that path to others.  And that&#39;s <br/>
understandable.  Thus, the answers that are posted ARE &quot;better than <br/>
average&quot; or higher or loftier than, say, run of the mill parenting.  <br/>
We&#39;re all trying to be better.  And it&#39;s natural for the posts here to <br/>
be skewed towards the better answers.<br/>

<br/>
PS<br/>
** Is it really<br/>

<br/>
Go back and read the responses again.  I think most people suggested <br/>
that you replace the wallpaper with something like paint that would be <br/>
less tempting for little fingers to destroy.<br/>
<br/>
** I mean, what if we were talking about a<br/>

<br/>
That wasn&#39;t the question that you posted.  Let&#39;s stay away from the <br/>

They have sometimes kicked a wall or opened a door too hard and made a <br/>
doorknob dent or accidentally done some damage here in our house.<br/>
<br/>
Picking at loose wallpaper is something that even some adults will do.<br/>
I know few to none who would do it at someone else&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-some people here hold or things you actually practice in your home???  At <br/>
what point does it become important to you that you not have to choose <br/>
between having your walls look like shit and dad getting mad or spending <br/>
money to replace wallpaper or paint that you may or may not have on a <br/>
recurring basis?-=-<br/>
<br/>
When we were looking at houses to buy when we outgrew the old one, I nixed <br/>
immediately the one with the 12&quot; wooden baseboards and the stencilled walls.  <br/>
And the one with 3/4&quot; carpet.  No.   I had/have no interest in having a house <br/>
that&#39;s so nice that an accidental mark on the wall is a disaster.  We&#39;re trying <br/>
to spend our days here with playdoh and rock&#39;n&#39;roll and drinking juice and <br/>
soda.  <br/>
<br/>
Our house isn&#39;t just a place to meet at the end of the day.  It&#39;s the all <br/>
day, all life site.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some of the answers I&#39;ve read to this thread seem a bit lofty to me and <br/>
frankly, I have a hard time believing them, which is why I&#39;m asking thse <br/>
questions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The damage was already  them and making them feel better, or thinking of how <br/>
to repair it in such a way that they don&#39;t continue to peel it (which is what <br/>
my suggestions involved--ways to seal off the edges with molding or paint).<br/>
<br/>
-=- I do think there is something odd about just encouraging them to <br/>
tear up the walls in the entire house just because I don&#39;t like the <br/>
wallpaper and they think it&#39;s fun, interesting or whatever.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The wallpaper in our bathroom is sad and not well.  One place, I just <br/>
box-taped it back.  When we decide to undo it, it would be WAY more fun to let Holly <br/>
tear it off gleefully than to take it off in somber, business-like fashion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The bottom line is that regardless of how I feel about the wallpaper...and <br/>
I <br/>
DO hate it...we just bought this house two months ago and I want a house <br/>
that looks nice.  So does my husband, so do my older girls. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The question was for gentle help.   So people answered in favor of the <br/>
children rather than of the wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it really okay with you if they tear things up in your house <br/>
because they like to peel things? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I made a suggestion about finding them other things to peel.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I mean, what if we were talking about a <br/>
child popping holes in the wall with a hammer because he likes to and he has <br/>
seen you hammering nails into the fence and decides he can try that out on <br/>
your living room wall...or your dinner plates, or your tv???-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a child wanted to use a hammer, wouldn&#39;t you give him a safe opportunity <br/>
to do so?<br/>
<br/>
Should the children have been better supervised?  Should the wallpaper be <br/>
stablilzed as soon as possible, if you want to keep it?  Then do that.  That&#39;s <br/>
not a parenting question, it&#39;s a wall finishing question, and you were given <br/>
several suggestions about that too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m really confused.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not consensus.  It&#39;s brainstorming.  <br/>
Not all answers are equally valid or even equally serious, in brainstorming.<br/>
Take what you need and leave the rest.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Jen - honestly, it has never mattered to me to have a really nice house.  <br/>

Magic tournament where he works.     One is altogether new here; the others are <br/>
repeats.<br/>
<br/>
That boy came through about five minutes ago and said &quot;You have a really nice <br/>
house!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I looked over at him, over the pile of stuff on the counter, over the two <br/>
chairs nearest me (one with an unfinished upholstery repair on the back and an <br/>
ice cream maker in the seat, the other with a pile of airling itinerary <br/>
printouts and circles and arrows).  I noticed this morning that the couch downstairs <br/>
is like a big sculpture of partially sorted and folded laundry, with a couple <br/>
of basket-shaped dumps piled on top artsily.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Thanks.  We really like it.  We tried to have a kid house, where the <br/>
kids could be comfortable.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
He said he liked the confusion of the various levels.  I do too.<br/>
<br/>
Our house isn&#39;t &quot;nice&quot; but it struck a visiting kid as a nice place to be.   <br/>
That&#39;s more important to me than most other things in life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you got the responses you did because you said you didn&#39;t like the<br/>
wallpaper and it sounds like the damage has already been done. People did<br/>
suggest corner protectors and how to paste it back on.<br/>
<br/>
When we were at my aunt&#39;s house with my then 4 yo (or so) daughter, another<br/>
child came by. There was a bit of the wallpaper torn. The other girl wanted<br/>
to pull at it. My daughter wanted to smooth it out and stick it back down<br/>
the way it was supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Was that because her mom let her rip wallpaper at home? Because I taught<br/>
mine not to?<br/>
<br/>
No. Different personalities. Different desires.<br/>
<br/>
If Betsy (and lots and lots of other people undoubtedly! ;-) couldn&#39;t resist<br/>
picking as an adult, is it reasonable to expect to be able to (gently) teach<br/>
a child to supress a desire to pick?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll need to watch them when they&#39;re at homes with wallpaper and say no.<br/>
And say no to writing on walls at other people&#39;s houses. They&#39;ll eventually<br/>
get it that there are different behaviors for home and away.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter used to eat sprawled across the kitchen table. She never did it<br/>
at anyone else&#39;s home. She never did it at a restaurant. And she eventually<br/>
outgrew it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe pulling off all the wallpaper will give them their lifetime fill of<br/>
picking and they won&#39;t pick at their kids&#39; cradle cap ;-)<br/>
