<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229890584">My personal impression of my role as an unschooling parent is to provide <br/>
opportunities for as many fun and interesting things I can, to provide <br/>
unconditional love, encouragement, support and safety and stability. To bite <br/>
my lip when I want to tell my son he&#39;s doing it wrong or going the wrong <br/>
direction. To stop my hand when I want to put it in his project to shape it <br/>
to what I &#39;know&#39; is better. To offer any and all truth, information and <br/>
knowledge to him when he asks for it. This, to me, is based on the basic <br/>
belief that if a person is given the room, opportunity and support to grow <br/>
and learn, he/she will naturally want to grow, learn and change to improve <br/>
and further his/her life. If I, as an adult, personally trust in myself, I <br/>
can get life-changing ideas from experts, amateurs, ants, sesame street, etc. <br/>
Learning is endless. But if I feel like someone or something outside of <br/>
myself has all the &#39;right&#39; answers, my growth may depend on that source.<br/>
<br/>
To me, allowing this freedom is to respect my son in his own growth and <br/>
process. I would like to extend that respect to everyone that I interact <br/>
with. I think the philosophy that someone may not know if it I don&#39;t tell <br/>
them is arrogant and flawed. If I have a truth, and someone wants it, it&#39;s <br/>
wrong imo to withhold it. But if I have a truth, and I want someone else to <br/>
have it when they didn&#39;t ask, it&#39;s arrogant and controlling. And it&#39;s <br/>
assuming that without the great wise and powerful &#39;me&#39;, they wouldn&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the &#39;tell it like it is&#39; philosophy is great, when someone is asking <br/>
for it.  When I want someone to tell me straight out, I ask straight out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just spouting some thoughts here.  I just don&#39;t understand why we respect <br/>
our kids to do the right thing for themselves if we encourage them to trust <br/>
themselves and provide access to everything, but in relating to other adults, <br/>
we need to tell someone who didn&#39;t ask that they&#39;re doing it wrong because <br/>
otherwise they might never know.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a balance between sickly sweet and cold hard truth. I also <br/>
think that just because someone knows a lot about a certain topic, such as <br/>
unschooling, doesn&#39;t mean that they know the best way to convey new ideas to <br/>
people. Or the best way to introduce wholly different lifestyles to someone <br/>
without insulting their ability to think for themselves or trust themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a lot about the human body, massage, movement and nutrition.  <br/>
But it took me awhile (and I&#39;m still learning) to realize that just pushing <br/>
this truth onto everyone isn&#39;t always effective. And many counselors I&#39;ve <br/>
talked to have told me that there is a definite process to self change, and <br/>
to rush that process is damaging. To just walk up and tell someone that <br/>
they&#39;re repeating a self defeating habit and here&#39;s what they need to do <br/>
different, when they didn&#39;t ask and most likely aren&#39;t ready, can be more <br/>
harmful than good. It can cause defensiveness and loss of self trust and may <br/>
even cause them cling even stronger to the self defeating behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was Rumi who said &#39;Follow people who are searching for the truth, <br/>
run from those who have found it.&quot;<br/>

After one has recognized a bad physical habit, what do<br/>

the end of the world or anything, but irritating<br/>
sometimes. Just wondering what you would recommend.  I<br/>
broke the fingernail biting habit years ago on my own.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point. There is also a difference between being on a learning journey <br/>
and sharing any points found along the way with any who come to want them, <br/>
and coming to a plateau to stand at and dispense truth from that place, <br/>
seeming to be disconnected from the journey that got them there and lacking <br/>
understanding and compassion for those still getting to that plateau and <br/>
beyond.<br/>

belief patterns. I have smoked, drank, bit my nails, picked at scabs, bit my <br/>
lips, etc. For me they are nervous &#39;self-picking&#39; habits I acquired from <br/>
childhood. I grew up in a very critical environment, not knowing where the <br/>
next criticism might come from, and never feeling safe to just relax and be <br/>
myself and know that all would be well. When I do these things now, I&#39;m <br/>
feeling tense, unsure of myself, not liking myself, not trusting or loving <br/>
myself, and sometimes from having been around others who are judging and <br/>
criticizing me. For me, the cure isn&#39;t to just force myself to stop (which <br/>
btw usually sends me to just redirect it into another habit), but to change <br/>
at a deeper level. This is why I believe that telling someone, &#39;you&#39;re doing <br/>
this, it&#39;s causing this and you need to stop&#39; is ineffective. I know that <br/>
picking at my nails til they bleed is wrong and hurts me, but finding out <br/>
&#39;why&#39; I do it and trying to comfort the need to do it is more effective.<br/>

P.s. Sharon, thanks so much for the shoe patterns. My computer was weird but <br/>
I was finally able to download them. Thanks for taking the time to send that <br/>
out.<br/>
