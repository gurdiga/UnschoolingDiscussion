<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, have you asked any questions? Did they not get answered? Perhaps some of <br/>
the other members of this list *were* learning something from the phonics <br/>
discussion, disagreements and all. You&#39;ll get more from any list the more <br/>
you participate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;........i wnat to echange ideas.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so let&#39;s start exchanging ideas. What&#39;s going on in your unschooling <br/>
home today Denise?<br/>
<br/>
In my home Conor spent much of the day learning about spelling. But don&#39;t <br/>
tell him that. He thinks he was just typing in commands, and chatting with <br/>
other gamers during an online game. He had many spelling questions that came <br/>
up though, so I made sure I was right there to help.<br/>
<br/>
Casey decided she wanted to earn every try-it badge that she hadn&#39;t already <br/>
earned in her Brownie book. She and I have worked through 14 badges between <br/>
yesterday and today. We also all visited the Park City Art Fest and finished <br/>
reading Artemis Fowl together. After I finish this, I&#39;m off to try and get <br/>
some child-sized help in cleaning some very stinky animal cages.  &lt;PU&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yes i have abandonment issues.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure how this relates to this list. No one is going to abandon you <br/>
or tell you to leave. But if you come to an unschooling list, this one in <br/>
particular, unschooling and all its nuances will be discussed. It&#39;s not to <br/>
insult or degrade or embarrass any one poster. It&#39;s a discussion meant to <br/>
enlighten us all. So please jump in and give us your ideas. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;yes im sensitive! AND DAMN PROUD OF IT!!!!!! Denise in Bflo.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
What&#39;s going on in your unschooling home today? I shared a little of mine a <br/>
few posts back. How&#39;s it going with you? How many kids do you have? How old <br/>
are they? Do you have any specific concerns? Have you or the kids read any <br/>
good books? Gone anyplace interesting? Made any cool crafts? How about <br/>
science experiments? How&#39;s the unschooling life going?<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

P.S. If you are responding to a particular post, it helps to leave a little <br/>
of the post in your reply. For me at least, it helps wit the flow of my <br/>
reading and understanding. :o)<br/>

intentionally) But, Denise in Bflo., I have a hard time reading posts like <br/>
this one. You replied to someone asking about delete options, with a post <br/>
full of exclamation points, words in all caps, arrows, and statements about <br/>
church, freedom, and abandonment issues. Again, not tying to be mean, but <br/>
posts like this are hard to read, and I like to be able to read (and <br/>
understand) everyone&#39;s posts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on in your unschooling <br/>
&gt; home today Denise?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not Denise .... BUT, we&#39;ve got lots going on in<br/>
our unschooling home today.<br/>
<br/>
We just got two puppies (I must have been temporarily<br/>
insane...) and are in the midst of puppy training.<br/>
Andrew, who is 12, really, really, really wanted these<br/>
pups, and has taken on much of the responsibility for<br/>
training them. <br/>
<br/>
Today, we&#39;re working on &quot;how puppy thinking is<br/>
different than people thinking&quot; and how puppies can&#39;t<br/>
understand why you&#39;re cross with them 15 minutes after<br/>
they&#39;ve peed in their crate, and how we have to make a<br/>
big deal about how wonderful it is that they pee in<br/>
the yard WHILE they are peeing in the yard or they&#39;ll<br/>
think you&#39;re praising them for chasing a grasshopper a<br/>
few minutes later ....<br/>
<br/>
And in other potty matters ... Will, who&#39;s 21 months<br/>
old, all of a sudden is very interested in talking<br/>
about the potty and his diapers and what&#39;s in them ...<br/>
could be all the talk about puppy pee ... so maybe<br/>
he&#39;s starting to become interested in potty training<br/>
(a cautiously optimistic hurray!!!).<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re discussing the Cuban missile crisis, because<br/>
Andrew wondered why you can&#39;t buy Cuban cigars in the<br/>
U.S.<br/>
<br/>
And, we&#39;re replacing the beam that&#39;s holding the front<br/>
porch up, so we&#39;re all carpenter apprentices to my<br/>
husband today.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it so far.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you&#39;re all having a wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>
Shelly<br/>

<br/>
I LOVE King of the Hill - I especially love the relationship between Bobby <br/>
and Hank - talk about a kid who isn&#39;t a good match for his parent!!! But Hank <br/>
tries so hard to always do the right thing by Bobby even when it goes so <br/>
against his own nature!! <br/>

Butthead. <br/>
<br/>
I just googled it and evidently Daria (another MTV<br/>
cartoon, I believe), also is a spin-off character from<br/>
Beavis and Butthead.<br/>
<br/>
Shelly, who is grateful that her son was never<br/>
interested in Beavis and Butthead...<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe so ... although the rest of my family really<br/>
likes it. I prefer Futurama, especially Bender.<br/>
Smart-alek humor is my favorite... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I liked Futurama better too. <br/>
It&#39;s a Simpson&#39;s spin-off / clone.<br/>
