&lt;&lt; Should we welcome in and coddle frothing antagonists? I don&#39;t think so. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so either, it would be absolutely ridiculous to do!!! I think <br/>
there&#39;s a difference (a very very big difference that may look to some people <br/>
like no difference at all) in not coddling someone who is lost in their ways so <br/>
they hear you, and not coddling someone who is lost in their ways so they <br/>
shut down. One is hearing and growing and learning, the other certainly isn&#39;t, <br/>
neither is being coddled.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Some people have an earnest desire to learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and in the above, I happen to only be talking about the ones that do!!<br/>

where it has this list suggested, that this list isn&#39;t for debating whether <br/>
unschooling is the way to go, and that those who get their feelings hurt easily <br/>
should try another list???<br/>
