is the main page but you&#39;ll have to click around to see any examples.  <br/>
But you can order!<br/>
<br/>
That page has a picture of a kind of thing my kids like to build.<br/>
<br/>
The site doesn&#39;t have the greatest illustrations, but if your kids like Lego, <br/>
they would not be disappointed in Ramagon at all!  The prices are a bit lower <br/>
than Discovery Toys&#39; price (the sets aren&#39;t the same, and maybe a bit <br/>
smaller, though, and you probably don&#39;t get any big guarantee, but the&#39;re not <br/>
easily breakable).<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s August!  Back-To-School time!!<br/>
All that money you didn&#39;t have to spend on crayons, scissors, glue, a pink <br/>
eraser, a ruler, spiral notebooks, three-ring binder (and two replacements <br/>
before the year&#39;s over), book covers, protractor and compass, lunch box, new <br/>
jacket, locker stuff (lock, mirror, cool magnetic pen holder)--that can go <br/>
toward Ramagon!<br/>
<br/>
And your kids will like it so much you&#39;ll be ready to buy them some more at <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
That site made me think of ordering Marty some more.  He does marvelous <br/>
things with it, and the sets we have are many years old.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000496400">Oh dear Sandra...I definitely don&#39;t need any encouragement to spend money on<br/>
cool things....  Ha, ha......!<br/>
But thanks for giving me another way to tell my dh why I bought something else!<br/>
;)<br/>
Lets see a set of Ramagon, and a set of Lego Mindstorm.....well, who needs food<br/>
for the month.  I need to lose lots of weight anyway!  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-642862204">On the radio this morning:<br/>
<br/>
DJ:  &quot;Well, are you getting ready for school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Listener:  &quot;Yes, we&#39;ve gone school shopping all last week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DJ:  &quot;What did you spend?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Listener:  &quot;Well, we spent $100 for school supplies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DJ:  &quot;How many children do you have?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Listener:  &quot;One.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DJ:  &quot;Wow, we only spent that for three children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Listener: &quot;Well $40 of that was what she has to take to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DJ:  &quot;What about clothes?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Listener:  &quot;Well, we&#39;ve spent $600 so far.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DJ:  &quot;Well, what do you think about uniforms . . . .&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And on and on and I sat there with a big grin thinking, &quot;teehee, we don&#39;t<br/>
have to play keep up with the Jones! and our kids are sooooo much happier!&quot;<br/>
