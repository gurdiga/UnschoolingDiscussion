<div id="ygrps-yiv-854838349">For some reason, my post did not come through went I emailed it, so <br/>
I am reposting it here instead and hopefully this will work....<br/>
<br/>
Sheila,<br/>
 <br/>
I do not know if this will help any, but I can tell you of mine and <br/>
boys experience of this very thing that just happened the other <br/>
night.<br/>
 <br/>
We were over at my MIL&#39;s house on Saturday night celebrating <br/>
Mother&#39;s Day a day early, and my BIL had on this rather &quot;sexually <br/>
heavy&quot; movie (Bull Durham) that was on the satellite dish in my MIL <br/>
home. We were all watching it, yes even my 7 and 6 yo, along with my <br/>
13 yo sons. Watching it for them anyway only lasted 3 minutes, <br/>
literally, because I was secretly timing it on my watch as my <br/>
own &quot;experiment&quot; to see what would happen. <br/>
 <br/>
Now mind you, I said nothing, nor did anyone else in the room say <br/>
anything about them watching it.....it was my 13 yo ds who took the <br/>
lead, as he felt uncomfortable watching it (I mean my 13 yo ds got <br/>
uncomfortable just last night when during Everwood when <br/>
the &quot;pregnancy&quot; issue came up and he excused himself to go to the <br/>
bathroom), I could tell, but I said nothing. I just sat back and let <br/>
the situation unfold. My 13 yo ds turned to my 7 yo and said &quot;Do you <br/>
want to go play Dr. Mario in Uncle Rob&#39;s room?&quot; and my 7 yo <br/>
said &quot;sure&quot; and off they went. Then about 5 minutes later my 6 yo, <br/>
who was immersed in his gameboy anyway, and was not even watching <br/>
the movie, he uses the TV sometimes just for background noise, he <br/>
turned to my dh and said, &quot;I am going to go see what Chris and <br/>
Matthew are up to&quot; and he left the room.<br/>
 <br/>
I was SO proud of them. They self-regulated without me having to say <br/>
a word. This was not the first time that my boys have self-<br/>
regulated, they do it all the time. It just happened to be the first <br/>
time that they did it in front of my MIL and BIL.<br/>
So, this was a MAJOR triumph for me, I felt, as my MIL STILL after <br/>
all this time, with all of the research I have given her, and the <br/>
talks we have had, and her seeing how much my children are learning <br/>
hearing it from my own children&#39;s mouths (she spent almost 3 hours, <br/>
no joke, on the phone with my 7 yo ds just last week, because he <br/>
wanted to talk to her, it was his choice because he wanted to tell <br/>
her all about what he has been doing and it took him almost 3 hours <br/>
to tell her!and this is coming from a what she calls my ds &quot;an <br/>
introverted child&quot;), she is still very skeptical of the whole <br/>
unschooling issue, but of course, does not say anything to me <br/>
personally, she tells my dh her &quot;worries&quot; (oh brother!). At least I <br/>
do not have to hear her complain! :)<br/>
 <br/>
So after the boys all left the room, a few minutes later,  I made a <br/>
point of saying out loud to my dh in front of my BIL and MIL &quot;Honey, <br/>
did you notice how the boys all self-regulated and left the room <br/>
because they felt uncomfortable about our movie choice?&quot;. 1,2,3,4,5 <br/>
points for me and my boys! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Alot of times too, I will be watching something and it will have <br/>
puns and inuendos in them that my children just do not get unless I <br/>
point them out to them. Sometimes I will depending on if they are <br/>
really watching it with me or  sometimes not, if they are just in <br/>
the room with their gameboys or on the computer, or writing or <br/>
drawing, and not really paying attention to whatever I am watching. <br/>
When I do though, it opens up a dialog for my children to expression <br/>
their view points on the matter at hand and for whatever else may <br/>
come out of that conversation.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, my 13 yo ds is getting better at &quot;catching on&quot; than my other <br/>
two, but not always. There are still things that go &quot;over his head <br/>
and out the window&quot; as my mother would say. My feeling on that is if <br/>
they are ready for it, then they will hear it and they will get it <br/>
OR they will ask about it, like.....&quot;I did not get what so and so <br/>
said Mom, what does that mean&quot; Ergo I would stop the video and <br/>
explain it then. Sometimes all they want is a quick on their own <br/>
level response, and sometimes they want to hear more and take to <br/>
another level, which I am gladly to do either because I strongly <br/>
believe that if they are ready to ask the question, then they are <br/>
ready to hear the answer, whatever, the equivalent of that answer <br/>
they seek is for them at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted to share this with you Sheila,  to let you know that even <br/>
though your 11 yo dd wants to see it, maybe she too will self-<br/>
regulate and not &quot;hear&quot; per se the puns and inuendos. And if she <br/>
does, it could open up a dialog with the two of you regarding it.  <br/>
It could also set the stage for a talk, if she asks, and or if you <br/>
choose to bring up the subject by asking her if she has any <br/>
questions about what she is seeing, surrounding the subject of sex. <br/>
I do not know how comfortable you are with it, but personally, I <br/>
would rather be the one who is comfortable with it and give my <br/>
children the information that my children ask for and about, as much <br/>
as they ask for, no matter what the topic. Sometimes we have to be <br/>
willing to drop our fears and uncomfortablities, in order to provide <br/>
our children with the knowledge they seek.<br/>
 <br/>
Knowledge is empowering, and hiding that knowledge from them will <br/>
only, in my humble opinion, serve to make sex, alcohol, drugs or <br/>
whatever &quot;bad thing we want to protect them from&quot;, more enticing and <br/>
make them want to do it even more. The more they know, the more <br/>
informative of a choice they can make. And the more trust you place <br/>
in your child, the more likely they are to make what we would see as <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; choice.<br/>
 <br/>
Just my 2 cents! :) Hope it helps! :)<br/>

&quot;For no matter where knowledge and learning come from - no matter<br/>
what shape, size, or dimension it assumes - it still is what it is,<br/>
knowledge and learning. Therefore knowledge and learning should<br/>
always be embraced.&quot; ~ unknown<br/>

Subject: young, innocent kids wanting to watch sexually heavy movies<br/>
 <br/>
I could use some input on the movie &quot;mean girls&quot; and on the general<br/>
topic of innocent pre-teens wanting to watch sexually heavy movies.<br/>
 <br/>
I was discussing this with some online friends and someone posted a<br/>
review of the movie Mean Girls and its sexual content.  So I guess my<br/>
first question, for those of you who&#39;ve seen it...just how sexual is<br/>
it?  For a innocent 11 year old who hasn&#39;t been exposed to much<br/>
sexuality in movies before, is it a lot to throw at her at once?<br/>
 <br/>
Examples of some things I&#39;ve been told about the movie:<br/>
-Regina states that she was half a virgin when she met Aaron.<br/>
-A male student tells another that something (presumably sexual) only<br/>
counts &quot;if you saw nipple.&quot;<br/>
-An instructor in a sex-ed class tells his students not to have sex<br/>
in the missionary position or standing up (stating that they&#39;ll die)<br/>
and then tells everyone to take a rubber (he has a container of<br/>
them).<br/>
-We hear a breakdown of the various student cliques in the cafeteria,<br/>
including that of the &quot;sexually active band geeks.&quot;<br/>
-Regina matter-of-factly asks Cady if she wants to have sex with a<br/>
guy who&#39;s joined them at school and Cady says, &quot;No thank you.&quot;<br/>
-Regina calls another girl&#39;s mother and acts as if she&#39;s from Planned<br/>
Parenthood regarding the girl (to get her in trouble).<br/>
-We hear that Regina&#39;s mom had a &quot;boob job&quot; (as the camera focuses on<br/>
her chest) and that they&#39;re as hard as rocks (Cady reacts to the feel<br/>
of them when the mom hugs her). The mom doesn&#39;t then realize that the<br/>
small family dog is biting on her clothed nipple.<br/>
-Comments are made about a girl still being a virgin and another<br/>
being a &quot;dyke.&quot;<br/>
-Janis tells Cady that she smells like a &quot;baby prostitute.&quot;<br/>
-A sex-ed instructor tells his students that they&#39;ll have urges and<br/>
want to take off their clothes, but that they&#39;ll then get Chlamydia.<br/>
 <br/>
My almost 11 year old daughter REALLY wants to see it. We generally<br/>
watch movies on dvd instead of in the theatres, so we won&#39;t go and<br/>
watch it right now, but it will be out on dvd before long I&#39;m sure.<br/>
 <br/>
My concern isn&#39;t that I want to be a prude and keep her from seeing<br/>
sexual stuff.  I want to be open and honest and all that when it<br/>
comes to sexuality.  I don&#39;t want to not let her watch it.  As a<br/>
matter of fact, not letting her watch something she wants to watch<br/>
isn&#39;t even an option.  She knows the basics about sex but is still<br/>
fairly innocent.  She saw Freaky Friday and loved the actress (same<br/>
one as is in this movie) and saw Mean GIrls advertised and just<br/>
thinks it looks awesome.  Plus it&#39;s about a homeschooled girl.  She<br/>
won&#39;t forget about wanting to watch this, she REALLY wants it.  She<br/>
wants to buy it and she&#39;ll probably watch it several times.<br/>
 <br/>
But the stuff I posted above...Wow, she doesn&#39;t know much about any<br/>
of that at all.  Maybe she&#39;s curious, maybe she&#39;s ready to start<br/>
hearing about some of that, and that&#39;s cool...but all that thrown<br/>
together in one movie?<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s my oldest, so it&#39;s my first time dealing with sexual stuff.<br/>
Any advice?<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d rather play Dr. Mario than see Kevin Costner ANYtime.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to start there and move to something that&#39;s a few steps removed, so <br/>
nobody needs to defend or explain anything.  Discuss the ideas all you want <br/>
to, but it&#39;s not about one family.  Sheila wrote lots of great things, I&#39;m just <br/>
jumping off from one bit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I made a <br/>
<br/>
point of saying out loud to my dh in front of my BIL and MIL &quot;Honey, <br/>
<br/>
did you notice how the boys all self-regulated and left the room <br/>
<br/>
because they felt uncomfortable about our movie choice?&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope now you can move past the idea of it being a &quot;regulation&quot; or that <br/>
they&#39;ve &quot;self regulated.&quot;   When my children choose vegetables over cookies, <br/>
they&#39;re not &quot;regulating.&quot;  We haven&#39;t declared one thing better than another, and <br/>
through all that it has been proven in and by their lives that children will <br/>
choose a balanced life in the absence of regulations.  It&#39;s not that the <br/>
children themselves came up with the rules and then regulated themselves.  It&#39;s a <br/>
natural balance and natural preference.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that you&#39;re in the phase of trying to overcome outside <br/>
criticism and skepticism, but for your own soul and the continuuing success of the <br/>
kids&#39; growth into making their own decisions, try to consider why &quot;self <br/>
regulating&quot; as a concept could be in your way.  Or could put you in their way.<br/>
<br/>
If in your mind not watching Bull Durham is better than watching it (in the <br/>
long run, even at home without relatives there), then when or if one of your <br/>
children watches it, will that mean he has stopped self-regulating?    Making a <br/>
choice is a choice.  Had Holly wanted to eat popsicles or cookies yesterday <br/>
instead of finishing off the avocado and spinach dip, it would have been just as <br/>
much a Holly-choice.   She wasn&#39;t &quot;regulating.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Young kids usually don&#39;t like movies with kissing and mush (they take off, or <br/>
they just focus on the Hot Wheels cars on the floor until the huggy chit-chat <br/>
passes).   I had kids who did that.  If I had defined that as &quot;not interested <br/>
in sex&quot; then if they got old enough to be willing to sit and watch through <br/>
the romance until the action came back, I guess I would be defining that as <br/>
&quot;interested in sex.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the decision making thoughts in my head are more neutral, more in the <br/>
middle, then I&#39;m not defining my children by my perception of their sexuality (or <br/>
interest therein) and that&#39;s a really GOOD thing.<br/>
<br/>
I have a short article on balance that probably explains it better than I can <br/>
re-explain it here.<br/>

-=- maybe she too will self-<br/>

<br/>
If she understands them she will.<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t understand them she won&#39;t.<br/>
If she acts shocked or doesn&#39;t act shocked, that will probably have more to <br/>
do with what she thinks her parents think about what she might think.<br/>
<br/>
There was a song before I was born that my mom used to sing.  Some of it goes<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was looking back to see if she was looking back to see <br/>
If I was looking back to see if she was looking back at me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of work, and when one can step out of that kid of <br/>
self-consciousness into just accepting and being in the moment, life becomes larger, quieter <br/>
and clearer.</div>
