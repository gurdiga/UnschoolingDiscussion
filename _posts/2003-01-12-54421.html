I know my hubby has $50 taken out of his check every month and I am ticked <br/>
off about that because they do not do a darn thing!!!!!<br/>
I feel that there is no way that teacher coudl afford that......isn&#39;t the <br/>
starting salary around $20,000 something? Depending on the area of course.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026779896">Hi there!  been gone for awhile, back for another dose ;)<br/>
<br/>
I had a great geometry teacher who helped me make my pattern for my prom<br/>
dress.  I had independent art study and that was my project, I drew a<br/>
picture of the dress I wanted and made the whole pattern from scratch, which<br/>
I had done on *simple* things, but not in a victorian gown with all kinds of<br/>
details ;)  She helped me figure out how to do some math to get the answers<br/>
I needed.  I ended up getting credit for both classes. It was a very cool<br/>
end to my schooling.  Up to then I felt pretty inadequate in school.<br/>
We love Stanley too, by the way.<br/>

&gt; There were a few who WOULD talk about things.  Music  teachers.  Art<br/>
&gt; teachers. <br/>
&gt; A couple of my English teachers were  thrilled by a good question and would<br/>
&gt; actually talk about things I didn&#39;t  need to know because they wouldn&#39;t &quot;be<br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; the test.&quot;  But I never  personally remember a science teacher or math or<br/>
&gt; history who  would.   If you knew their hobby or personal passion, you might<br/>
&gt; get  them <br/>
&gt; going for a little bit.<br/>

<br/>
This is so cool.<br/>
I hope someday kids have access to people who can help them do things like <br/>
that but that they&#39;re not expected to attend 180 days of a pre-decided set of <br/>
lessons in exchange for the occasional thrilling personal attention.<br/>
<br/>
If schools were more like... like I don&#39;t know what.  Like the most glorious <br/>
fantasy scout-jamboree, and a historical re-creation museum and a fair.  If <br/>
there were scheduled activities that anyone could go to, adult or child, and <br/>
they were fun ways to make connections with others of similar interests, that <br/>
would be SO COOL!<br/>
<br/>
There are astronomy times/places where an observatory is open (at the museum, <br/>
or the university, here) and people can go to see something specific.  That&#39;s <br/>
fun.  But kids who go to school tend to avoid it because it seems schoolish.  <br/>
It&#39;s almost as though some of them (lots?) spite their teachers by refusing <br/>
to do anything that might remotely make the teacher happy if he found out about <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
But the sparkly times are great.<br/>
I had lots of them, in school.  Not as big a project as the prom dress story, <br/>
though, which is wonderful.<br/>

But those are for the students, run by the students.<br/>
<br/>
I mean if an archeologist ran a session every week for whoever wanted to come <br/>
and see the news in archeology or to examine some new artifact brought for <br/>
the day, and ANYONE could come and see, but didn&#39;t have to stay if it wasn&#39;t <br/>
fun.  No commitment to come daily or even monthly.  Available, exciting, <br/>
short-term, fun sessions.<br/>

Check your local community colleges.  Our local college has an archaeological dig site right on campus and welcomed community invovlement and participation in all aspects from the actual dig to the washing, prepping, and cataloging of artifacts - you didn&#39;t have to be enrolled to participate either.  Surely there are other opportunitites available, or at least the professors may be able to point you to available opportunities that may be hard for the general public to discover.<br/>
