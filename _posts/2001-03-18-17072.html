<div><font color="#ffff00" face="Pooh" size="4">Since our weekends usually start on 
fridays around here...we went to Barnes and Noble on friday. We checked out the 
children&#39;s section. WOW! Naomi wanted some workbooks to work in...her choice. So 
we picked out 5th grade math and a book called science made easy. She also 
picked up Little women Illustrated classics (my mom had bought her Heidi a 
couple years ago) and 2 other classics The Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan. She&#39;s 
been enjoying her math book and reading the others. </font></div>
<div><font color="#ffff00" face="Pooh" size="4">Saturday..I went to the library while 
she went with friends out of town to visit their grandma...and picked up 4 books 
to do with science...a couple of them to use in cooking and edible cooking 
science projects and the other one was quick science fun you can do in a minute 
or two. The other book was on Mammoths. She read that one last night and enjoyed 
it. </font></div>
<div><font color="#ffff00" face="Pooh" size="4">ITs still early today, we just got up 
a bit ago and haven&#39;t a clue as to what we will do yet today. I do know that I 
need to go and make some breakfast soon...Both of us are hungry! I hope you all 
have a wonderful day..</font></div>
