&gt;    From: &quot;Nanci Kuykendall (Ingah)&quot;<br/>
&gt; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aisliin@...">aisliin@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subject: Camp Fire USA<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard both good and bad things about Camp<br/>
&gt; Fire USA.  I decided <br/>
&gt; to do a little first hand research of my own and<br/>
&gt; find out what they <br/>
&gt; were all about.  So I have been in touch with the<br/>
&gt; Executive Director <br/>
&gt; of our local Council, to get more information. In<br/>
&gt; the course of our <br/>
&gt; correspondence, he sent me some pages from the<br/>
&gt; Leader Guide.  Most of <br/>
&gt; it looked pretty good, but I was given pause by<br/>
&gt; certain parts of it.  <br/>
&gt; I thought I would share about my concerns here and<br/>
&gt; get some feedback <br/>
&gt; from all of you, and also ask for experiences of<br/>
&gt; those who have been <br/>
&gt; involved with Camp Fire, before I discuss this with<br/>
&gt; my Camp Fire <br/>
&gt; contact.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Section that gave me pause is titled: Camp Fire<br/>
&gt; USA Builds <br/>
&gt; Developmental Assets<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It begins by talking about the results and findings<br/>
&gt; of a study done <br/>
&gt; by the Search Institute, in the 1990s, which<br/>
&gt; identified asset <br/>
&gt; building as a focus for youth development instead of<br/>
&gt; problem <br/>
&gt; solving.  OK, I can get with that, being as I see<br/>
&gt; prevention as <br/>
&gt; better than bandages in general.  They go on to say<br/>
&gt; that they have <br/>
&gt; identified 14 assets in the Camp Fire program that<br/>
&gt; they believe help <br/>
&gt; youth to develop.  OK, so they are earmarking<br/>
&gt; positives in their <br/>
&gt; program, that&#39;s ok.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the next part starts to get creepy, and reads<br/>
&gt; like a recipe for <br/>
&gt; cooking up wonderful adults, as though it&#39;s a fool<br/>
&gt; proof plan.  Here <br/>
&gt; are the 14 assets:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Young Person has empathy, sensitivity and<br/>
&gt; friendship  <br/>
&gt; -Young person has knowledge of and comfort with<br/>
&gt; people of different <br/>
&gt; cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds<br/>
&gt; (ok, so far so good)<br/>
&gt; -Young person serves the community 1 or more hours<br/>
&gt; per week<br/>
&gt; (whoa, what does this mean?  What counts as<br/>
&gt; community service?  Is <br/>
&gt; the age of the child considered?  I think community<br/>
&gt; service is a <br/>
&gt; great thing and I encourage it, but I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; being involved in a <br/>
&gt; program where my child is REQUIRED to do it to meet<br/>
&gt; some objective <br/>
&gt; set by the group.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Young person receives support from 3 or more<br/>
&gt; non-parent adults<br/>
&gt; (ok, that sounds good)<br/>
&gt; -Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in<br/>
&gt; lessons or practice <br/>
&gt; in music, theater or other arts<br/>
&gt; (whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on<br/>
&gt; arts?  What counts <br/>
&gt; according to them?  What if my child is not<br/>
&gt; classically artistic, or <br/>
&gt; goes through a phase where they are not?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in<br/>
&gt; sports, clubs, and <br/>
&gt; organizations at school or in the community<br/>
&gt; (whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and<br/>
&gt; recreational <br/>
&gt; sports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to<br/>
&gt; do this or that, <br/>
&gt; ok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok. <br/>
&gt; But just saying <br/>
&gt; that they spend X amount of hours per week is so<br/>
&gt; arbitrary and <br/>
&gt; controlling to me.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -Young person is out with friends with &quot;nothing<br/>
&gt; special to do&quot; two or <br/>
&gt; fewer nights per week.<br/>
&gt; (What??  Does that mean they think all their time<br/>
&gt; should be planned <br/>
&gt; and scheduled, even for teenagers?  Does that mean<br/>
&gt; we are not <br/>
&gt; supposed to trust our children&#39;s judgement in<br/>
&gt; general about how they <br/>
&gt; spend their time?)<br/>
&gt; 							<br/>
&gt; The rest sounds good<br/>
&gt; -Young person can resist negative peer pressure and<br/>
&gt; dangerous <br/>
&gt; situations<br/>
&gt; -Young person seeks to resolve conflict nonviolently<br/>
&gt; -Young person knows how to plan ahead and make<br/>
&gt; choices<br/>
&gt; -Young person feels that he or she &quot;has control over<br/>
&gt; things that <br/>
&gt; happen to me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; -Young person reports having high self esteem.<br/>
&gt; -Young person reports that &quot;my life has a purpose.&quot;<br/>
&gt; -Young person is optimistic about his or her<br/>
&gt; personal future<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But then this &quot;All of the Camp Fire USA&#39;s curricula<br/>
&gt; are outcome <br/>
&gt; based.  Forty Camp Fire outcomes were identified to<br/>
&gt; develop these <br/>
&gt; assets.  These outcomes guide all projects, programs<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; recognitions.  The outcomes are in the appendix and<br/>
&gt; referenced <br/>
&gt; throughout the grade level program books.  This<br/>
&gt; makes it easy to know <br/>
&gt; if you are using the Camp Fire activities and<br/>
&gt; projects as designed, <br/>
&gt; the children will be experiencing the outcomes that<br/>
&gt; will make them <br/>
&gt; caring, confident youth and future leaders.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how many<br/>
&gt; ways can I say <br/>
&gt; ick?  Curricula?  Grade levels?  Outcome based? Am I<br/>
&gt; just looking at <br/>
&gt; this the wrong way or not understanding what they<br/>
&gt; are trying to say?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Elsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When<br/>
&gt; children and youth <br/>
&gt; join Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate<br/>
&gt; to their grade.&quot;  <br/>
&gt; Is this program totally geared toward the<br/>
&gt; institutional schooling <br/>
&gt; system, and would we be totally out of place?  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t really want to <br/>
&gt; separate my children out into narrow band age<br/>
&gt; groups.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
&gt; it is socially good for them.  I am one of those who<br/>
&gt; is of the <br/>
&gt; opinion that institutional schooling is<br/>
&gt; intrinsically bad for the <br/>
&gt; human mind and spirit, and that the institutional<br/>
&gt; educational model <br/>
&gt; can never be made healthy enough to be effective or<br/>
&gt; positive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After I read the pages to my husband, he said &quot;Well<br/>
&gt; I have heard <br/>
&gt; enough.  YUCK!&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have Unschooling friends with a teenager who refer<br/>
&gt; to their <br/>
&gt; experiences with &quot;the Cult of Camp Fire&quot; with a<br/>
&gt; shudder.  Perhaps <br/>
&gt; that was just their local group or council, or is<br/>
&gt; that indicative of <br/>
&gt; the general atmosphere?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nanci K.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Dear Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
I think that groups use a schoolish paradigm because<br/>
they don&#39;t have anything else to refer to.<br/>
<br/>
It has become so pervasive in our society.  You can&#39;t<br/>
go anywhere without being exposed to that &quot;kids are<br/>
inferior and need to be controlled&quot; approach. Whip<br/>
them into shape. Etc....  <br/>
<br/>
The brain washing most received in institutional<br/>
school was thorough and worked.  <br/>
<br/>
I like to think that the rest of the community being<br/>
exposed to UNschoolers is a breath of fresh air for<br/>
them and maybe, in some small way, we can open up<br/>
their box just a crack and they&#39;ll get at least a<br/>
glimmer of light that may make them want more. (Yes,<br/>
ever the Optimist.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a conversation with a Campfire USA leader from<br/>
TN,(I think), at the Live and Learn UNschooling<br/>
conference in Columbia. <br/>
<br/>
I met so many people that I am having trouble<br/>
remembering her name, but I will check the<br/>
registration list unless someone here maybe remembers<br/>
and can supply it.  She has 3 sons and began as a<br/>
&quot;backup&quot; leader in the first group in her state.  The<br/>
other 2 leaders moved and now she is the leader.  (It<br/>
does seem to work out that way ...   ;*)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she was telling me about the ways that it<br/>
differs from Boy Scouts.  I mentioned that my sons had<br/>
a homeschool friend whose dad is an Eagle scout and is<br/>
a leader, but that I had talked it over with my sons<br/>
and explained that this is a club that discriminates<br/>
based on sexual orientation,(i.e. NO [known] gays),<br/>
and that I didn&#39;t feel good about supporting an<br/>
organization that kicked out or kept out members based<br/>
on that criteria. My sons agreed that that was not<br/>
acceptable. They were lukewarm on the idea of scouts<br/>
to begin with so it was dropped without any<br/>
unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
(In discussing it with my friend, the leader&#39;s wife,<br/>
she assured me that ALL boys were welcomed in her<br/>
husband&#39;s group.  I expressed that I appreciated that<br/>
he was a good guy, but that his organization didn&#39;t<br/>
back up his philosophy and that intolerance and<br/>
discrimination are therefore implicit in their<br/>
operation.)<br/>
<br/>
The Campfire USA leader indicated to me that there is<br/>
not the same type of pseudo-religious approach<br/>
involved.  Also, the para-military procedures aren&#39;t<br/>
present.  When the children earn badges, they may<br/>
place them wherever they choose.  It is a much more<br/>
informal approach toward earning them as well.  She<br/>
was telling me that they often found that they had met<br/>
the criteria for a badge, would document it and<br/>
receive it.  As compared to the &quot;nothing in the past<br/>
counts&quot; approach.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check with Kelly and see if I can find her name. <br/>
Her group has done really well and she&#39;s not had a<br/>
problem reconciling it as an UNschooler.<br/>
<br/>
I got all this info. from a brief conversation.  So,<br/>
please do verify and further research.<br/>
<br/>
This mom really enjoyed that it was a co-ed group that<br/>
gave her sons the opportunity to participate in<br/>
activities with girls as their were no sisters in the<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;negative&quot; I got from our talk was that they<br/>
have to sell candy bars.  Personally, I HATE that kind<br/>
of vendor fund raising.  I&#39;d much rather be told what<br/>
the $$$ bottom line and decide how to raise the money<br/>
myself.  Pushing sweets doesn&#39;t thrill me.  But, I<br/>
take it that is the standard in all these types of<br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone else doesn&#39;t post it, I&#39;ll look for her<br/>
info. later today.<br/>

<br/>
I enjoyed our talk, and you related it very well.<br/>
<br/>
On the candy issue....I&#39;ve spent hundreds of my own dollars this year keeping <br/>
the club going, getting the stuff to do the things we want to have fun doing, <br/>
etc.  I don&#39;t want to spend my own money anymore.  Lots of the people in my <br/>
club can&#39;t afford to give that kind of money for their kid to do the cool <br/>
things we did.  The candy sale helps us do a lot more than we would otherwise <br/>
get to do.  A necessary evil.<br/>
<br/>
Girl Scouts do cookies, Boy Scouts do popcorn, Camp Fire sells candy (good <br/>
candy!  Not ordinary candy!)<br/>
<br/>
It was nice meeting you and your hubby, Melinda!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Melinda, I must apologize to you.  There is someone on the other list who I <br/>
thought said something about being at the conference, too.  She&#39;s making a <br/>
real ass out of herself over there, and I thought she was *you* until you <br/>
posted about Camp Fire. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting that and clearing yourself up in my mind.  I was getting <br/>
really disheartened.<br/>
