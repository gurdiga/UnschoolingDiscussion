<div id="ygrps-yiv-53238092">I realize Sandra may have already un subbed, but I wanted to comment. <br/>
I have come to respect her immensely for the great regard she has for her<br/>
children.  <br/>
She has tried to say - children can be happy, this is what I know, have<br/>
you considered this.  She has shown how children, truly loved and<br/>
respected can flourish.  This has been most encouraging to me,<br/>
personally.  I&#39;m sorry that a few people have felt trying to prove her<br/>
wrong was more important than trying to help us all learn and grow. <br/>
