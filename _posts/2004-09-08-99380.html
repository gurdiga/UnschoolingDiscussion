&gt; Subject: a question about formal writing & unschooling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering, is it possible to help a child prepare for college or even<br/>
 </span></blockquote>some standardized test they may have to take in regards to formal writing in<br/>
an unschooling way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m answering this two days late, and I don&#39;t know yet what others have<br/>
suggested (as I still have a lot of reading to catch up on), but here&#39;s how<br/>
we&#39;ve been approaching this situation.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, I waited until Liam expressed an interest in critical<br/>
reading and formal writing.  For the first three years that he was at<br/>
home -- I pulled him from school in 8th grade -- he showed no interest at<br/>
all, so I left it completely alone.  He read for pleasure, but not a lot.<br/>
School had pretty much driven that desire out of him, and I knew that he<br/>
would have to rediscover that desire in his own way and time.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I honestly didn&#39;t know if he would regain that desire to read or<br/>
would develop the desire to write formally before he went off to college<br/>
(which he has always stated he wants to do), so I was prepared to have him<br/>
take remedial courses if necessary.  Don&#39;t forget that this is always an<br/>
option.  It is a myth that high schoolers graduate ready to read and write<br/>
at a college level.  Many, many don&#39;t, in my experience.  Almost everyone<br/>
from our district&#39;s schools needs some sort of remediation, and for<br/>
homeschoolers to be on equal footing, a single course at the community<br/>
college level can work wonders for these skills.<br/>
<br/>
Once Liam did come to me and express his wish to develop these skills prior<br/>
to college entrance, however, I told him that it wouldn&#39;t take long at all<br/>
for him to fine-tune these skills.  Once the internal motivation is there,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t take much.  It&#39;s really very simple.<br/>
<br/>
We began by reading together.  He chose books from an online list of college<br/>
prep literature -- _To Kill a Mockingbird_ was the first.  Great book.<br/>
<br/>
I did my own research about critical reading, and explained to him the<br/>
concepts of symbolism, metaphor, themes, foreshadowing, etc.  Just basic<br/>
stuff.  I asked for him to keep these concepts in mind as he read.<br/>
<br/>
We meet once a week at a nearby coffee house with his favorite &#39;cool&#39; aunt,<br/>
who also loves literature, and we then discuss the book over lattes.  Very<br/>
cool.  I have reviewed in advance the online SparkNotes for the text, and<br/>
keep these ideas in mind as we talk.  I keep it as natural a discussion as<br/>
possible.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s even aware of the preparation I&#39;ve done, or of<br/>
the ways I gently direct the conversation at times.<br/>
<br/>
After we finish the book, we try to watch a movie treatment of it.  That was<br/>
easy with _Mockingbird_.  Great movie, too.<br/>
<br/>
He had really surprised me by asking to be shown how to write a formal<br/>
paper, but he knows how he&#39;ll be asked to do that in college, so I showed<br/>
him.  I asked him to think of the major themes he found in _Mockingbird_,<br/>
then we narrowed the list down and I helped him to write a strong thesis<br/>
statement from these ideas.  Then I let him run with it after explaining the<br/>
basic essay structure of five paragraphs, three points, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I did encourage him to do a rough draft, then a second, corrected draft,<br/>
before producing a third.  He went along with it, but I could tell that he<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure why it was necessary.  The next one we did, I didn&#39;t ask for the<br/>
rough drafts, and he saw that his final product wasn&#39;t as well-developed.<br/>
<br/>
I also asked him if he wanted me to get involved with his grammar, spelling,<br/>
and punctuation.  He said no.  He wanted to do it his own way.  That was<br/>
fine.  I did tell him, though, that college professors wouldn&#39;t be so easy<br/>
on him, and that if he wants direction in this area too, I&#39;m available.<br/>
He&#39;ll make his own choices there, and that&#39;s fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time since he came home that I have been so directive, but<br/>
I console myself that it is at his request.<br/>
<br/>
If your kiddo hasn&#39;t started asking for this stuff yet, I would simply wait.<br/>
How old is s/he?  Are you even certain that s/he wants to go to college?<br/>
<br/>
However, as I&#39;ve seen myself, it doesn&#39;t take long at all to get the hang of<br/>
it once the internal drive is there.<br/>
