Breaking news on WLWT - Channel 5 Cincinnati (NBC) local evening news<br/>
has just released this breaking story about the alleged rape of a<br/>
freshman girl by two freshmen boys on campus at Woodward High School<br/>
in Cincinnati during school today. I mean, doesn&#39;t that prove that<br/>
public schools cause violent crime? Where are the cameras? Where is<br/>
Dan Rather? Where is the CBS Evening News team condemning public<br/>
schools for the crime they foster by compelling kids to be in<br/>
school? Feel free to send a copy of this link, this story, to Dan<br/>
Rather on CBS Evening News.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I wonder what would happen if everyone sent every story about <br/>
every crime, at least the ones that we hear about, that takes place <br/>
in our public schools to Dan Rather.  Do you think he would see the <br/>
light and stop drawing terribly flawed conclusions in his news <br/>
reporting? Remember that these are schools which all tax-payers are <br/>
forced to support and which all children are forced by compulsory <br/>
attendance laws to attend, except for those rich enough to send their <br/>
kids to private or parochial schools, or those who have loving caring <br/>
and sacrificing parents who elect to school them at home. Do you <br/>
think Dan Rather would comprehend that his logic and his reporting on <br/>
the homeschool stories last week were convoluted?  I wonder.<br/>
<br/>
And it is Dan Rather who is still defending his bias in reporting the <br/>
two episodes of CBS Evening News last week.  Maybe the shows sponsors <br/>
would like to read the stories about public school crime?  <br/>
