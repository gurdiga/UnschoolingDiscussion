<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514952133">Ren&#39;s back on line now (Her power just came on! Yay!) and can request help  <br/>
herself---but that&#39;s hard to do---to ask for help yourself! So *I* am asking!  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;. <br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s keeping lots of kids while their parents get things cleaned up.  <br/>
There&#39;s no school, so all the neighbor kids are there. There&#39;a a curfew from  7:00pm <br/>
to 7:00 am. The kids are going stir-crazy. If you have any art supplies  or <br/>
games or just a box of surprises that would be great!<br/>
 <br/>
As for the family that&#39;s struggling so hard:<br/>
 <br/>
Katie is 10, she wears jeans and t-shirts (doesn&#39;t like girly stuff at all)  <br/>
wears a 7-8...or 8-10, likes them a bit loose. She likes Yu-Gi-Oh and Bey  <br/>
Blades.<br/>
 <br/>
They could really use cash. Their house was severely damaged. They need to  <br/>
find a home----apartment or rental---until insurance kicks in and they can <br/>
start  to rebuild. They need cash for rent, and maybe some for living expenses, <br/>
since  they don&#39;t have much and he&#39;s losing work and having to pay for extras <br/>
like  storage rental and u-haul and such.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
You can send donations and care packages to:<br/>

Thanks from me and Ren!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732830602">Hi, Kelly ~<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re using this year&#39;s homeschool project for a fundraiser to help <br/>
out fellow Florida families affected by this summer&#39;s disaster.  <br/>
Part of the proceeds will go to America&#39;s Second Harvest, which has <br/>
been active in helping with the relief efforts for those hit by the <br/>
hurricanes all over our state and beyond.  More details are <br/>
available at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://kitchencrew.ardfamilyco-op.net">http://kitchencrew.ardfamilyco-op.net</a> <br/>
<br/>
All the best to you & yours from me & mine ~<br/>
Penne & the Crew<br/>

 <br/>
Mail&#39;s delivered if your road is passable. Ren&#39;s is clear.<br/>
