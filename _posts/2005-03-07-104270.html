<div id="ygrps-yiv-622309646">I&#39;ve been saying &quot;why not?&quot; more often and it feels good! I think <br/>
it&#39;s rubbing off on my husband.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, we were in the bathroom with our 6 yr old, Sophia, <br/>
helping her get her bath water just like she likes it.  She <br/>
undressed but forgot her socks.  When she asked her Dad to &quot;jump&quot; <br/>
her in the tub, she realized she was still wearing the socks.  My <br/>
husband said, &quot;why not?&quot; and &quot;jumped&quot; her into the tub anyway.  She <br/>
giggled with glee and then peeled off the wet socks and smacked them <br/>
against the wall, enjoying the noise and our smiling faces.<br/>
<br/>
It was a good &quot;yes&quot; moment.  Later, I talked with my husband about <br/>
it.  We discussed how crazy it is that we all have these little <br/>
rules inside us that don&#39;t mean a thing really, have no reason for <br/>
being.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, say &quot;yes&quot; to saying yes! :)</div>
