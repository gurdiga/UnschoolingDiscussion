<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238635884">Hi Helen - I don&#39;t believe in testing or keeping records.  The problem is, I<br/>
live in a town where the superintendent knows we&#39;re here, and that town is<br/>
in Massachusetts, where the term &quot;educational neglect&quot; is very popular right<br/>
now.  This week I&#39;m filling out our &quot;report&quot; for Clonlara and each time I go<br/>
to work on it I find myself too angry to write.  Do you have any advice?  Do<br/>
I just stop sending anything in and see if the school notices?  They seem to<br/>
have decided to really crack down on homeschoolers here lately, and do<br/>
sometimes involve DSS.  If there is nothing I can do and I just have to keep<br/>
sending the reports, is there something I can do on a larger scale than my<br/>
own family to get these laws changed?  Thanks for any advice ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658029141">I would be interested to know what other people are doing.  Does your<br/>
magazine, or any other that you know of, address these issues regularly? I<br/>
suppose for now I&#39;ll continue with Clonlara, and when my kids are grown I&#39;ll<br/>
take on the world :).  I keep hoping someone has figured out how to say, no<br/>
I won&#39;t report, without putting their children in any danger, but I guess<br/>
it&#39;s never that simple. We definitely don&#39;t want to have to leave our home<br/>
to move to another &#39;easier&#39; town or state.  I&#39;m glad Clonlara&#39;s around.<br/>
They do make it as easy as it can be to comply. ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Boy, it&#39;s really easy to tell people what we&#39;ve chosen to do over the<br/>
years with respect to our own situation, but almost impossible to<br/>
advise anyone else on what they should do, especially when it<br/>
involves potential clashes with an unfriendly school official or DSS<br/>
bureaucracy. My only advice would be to carefully weigh the options<br/>
and make a decision accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
One critical factor that helped in our case was having a dual<br/>
residency in this state (Washington) and Alaska - we&#39;ve always<br/>
travelled between the two quite easily and our ace in the hole was<br/>
that if Washington really started hassling us we&#39;d just go to Alaska.<br/>
So while it might have appeared to be a bold brave stance on one<br/>
level, we were definitely playing it safe on another. We don&#39;t play<br/>
games or take risks where our kids are concerned, because the powers<br/>
that be don&#39;t always play fair.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One can always rally others who feel the same way you do and work<br/>
toward changing the legal situation. Homeschoolers do that all the<br/>
time, and I can put you in touch with good people in other states who<br/>
are doing it right now if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Hi Helen - I don&#39;t believe in testing or keeping records.  The problem is, I<br/>
&gt;live in a town where the superintendent knows we&#39;re here, and that town is<br/>
&gt;in Massachusetts, where the term &quot;educational neglect&quot; is very popular right<br/>
&gt;now.  This week I&#39;m filling out our &quot;report&quot; for Clonlara and each time I go<br/>
&gt;to work on it I find myself too angry to write.  Do you have any advice?  Do<br/>
&gt;I just stop sending anything in and see if the school notices?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy, it&#39;s really easy to tell people what we&#39;ve chosen to do over the <br/>
years with respect to our own situation, but almost impossible to <br/>
advise anyone else on what they should do, especially when it <br/>
involves potential clashes with an unfriendly school official or DSS <br/>
bureaucracy. My only advice would be to carefully weigh the options <br/>
and make a decision accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
One critical factor that helped in our case was having a dual <br/>
residency in this state (Washington) and Alaska - we&#39;ve always <br/>
travelled between the two quite easily and our ace in the hole was <br/>
that if Washington really started hassling us we&#39;d just go to Alaska. <br/>
So while it might have appeared to be a bold brave stance on one <br/>
level, we were definitely playing it safe on another. We don&#39;t play <br/>
games or take risks where our kids are concerned, because the powers <br/>
that be don&#39;t always play fair.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   They seem to<br/>
&gt;have decided to really crack down on homeschoolers here lately, and do<br/>
&gt;sometimes involve DSS.  If there is nothing I can do and I just have to keep<br/>
&gt;sending the reports, is there something I can do on a larger scale than my<br/>
&gt;own family to get these laws changed?  Thanks for any advice ~Rue<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One can always rally others who feel the same way you do and work <br/>
toward changing the legal situation. Homeschoolers do that all the <br/>
time, and I can put you in touch with good people in other states who <br/>
are doing it right now if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
