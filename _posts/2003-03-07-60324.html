 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t even engage in conversation with these people.  I usually just say <br/>
that I am busy with my children and they can leave their pamphlet if they <br/>
would like but it will be going in the trash so if they want they can take it <br/>
and give it to someone who will read it.  Thanks for stopping by and have a <br/>
nice day (close door in their face).<br/>
<br/>
I did get into it once with one very nice guy.  He started out saying that we <br/>
live in such a rushed society and didn&#39;t I feel caught up in the rush.  I <br/>
said no.  He said don&#39;t you wish you had more time with your family.  I said <br/>
I spend all day with mine, how about you.  He kind of stumbled then said <br/>
wouldn&#39;t you like to be doing exactly what you want to do.  I said I am and I <br/>
enjoy it, thank you very much.  He didn&#39;t know what to say then and left.  <br/>
Still not sure what he was peddling.<br/>

I have a sign I painted that says &quot;No Trespassers or Solicitors<br/>
Welcome&quot; I have had some visitors and I am honest but try to be<br/>
nice. I think it&#39;s the honest part that tends to do the job. We used<br/>
to get a lot of visitors and they caught me in the yard once. They<br/>
got out and gave me a pamphlet and such. Asked me where I went to<br/>
church. I said I was pagan. They didn&#39;t know what that was so i said<br/>
well i also call myself a witch. {hope that freaks no one out here,<br/>
you seem to have a pretty good understanding of diversity } At that<br/>
point they were glad to be on there way. I told then Thank you and<br/>
to have a great day {I always say this being in the south and from<br/>
the past of working retail so I wasn&#39;t being condescending}<br/>
Anyway we haven&#39;t had anymore visitors lately.<br/>

A friend of mine saw the JWs coming one time, ran and changed into some long <br/>
flowing robe, grabbed a fancy-looking book, opened door before the knocked <br/>
and said &quot;Come in!  I want to tell you about my religion!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They went away politely.<br/>
