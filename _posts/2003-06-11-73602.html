I&#39;d start adding a little water to it (I&#39;m guessing the bully and the beagle <br/>
are both finished eating in 5 seconds or less!). Sprinkle a teaspoon on the <br/>
beagle&#39;s and a tablespoon on the bully&#39;s. <br/>

Kelly actually downs her food in about 5 seconds. Ozzy is a slow eater. I<br/>
think maybe just to torture Kelly to show her he has more. She stalks his<br/>
bowl as he&#39;s eating, too smart to actually try a bite. When he&#39;s down she<br/>
licks his bowl. And I wouldn&#39;t be putting the tenderizer in her food. She<br/>
only eats Ozzy&#39;s poop not hers. Go figure!!<br/>

Have you tried some digestive enzymes or herbal supplements that might help <br/>
him digest the food more thoroughly? sometimes dogs eat other dogs poop because <br/>
to them it still seems like good food.<br/>
On the other hand(paw) aren&#39;t beagles by their nature a problem? I am only <br/>

own poop. I hate the poop eating thing, my shepherd taught my Schipperke to eat <br/>
it, and he will race her out to see if the dogs left him any goodies.<br/>
I take care of dogs for people frequently, and find that the cheaper the dog <br/>
food, the more likely my dogs will try to eat the other dogs poop. Changing to <br/>
the BARF diet has helped somewhat. I used a product called Forbid once, and <br/>
it worked, but I found it just as easy to keep scooping.<br/>
Frozen poop is especially popular around here, we call them poopsicles, of <br/>
course.<br/>
Good luck, if y ou find anything  that works , let me know.<br/>

With Alyssa around her, I really have to watch. Of course Ozzy eats whatever<br/>
is on the floor too. I&#39;ll see legs sticking out of his huge mouth and yell<br/>
to Joe that Ozzy is eating people again. He&#39;ll pull out an armless torso and<br/>
yell that he&#39;s got no head. I&#39;ll find the head being crunched on by Kelly.<br/>

Oh believe me if it wasn&#39;t the Bully (my husband&#39;s dog) that ate the remotes<br/>
he would have killed!! I think three were all tv remotes and we replaced<br/>
those with universal remotes. We finally got a new tv and this remote only<br/>
has 2 teeth marks in it. He totally ate the remote from the cable company.<br/>
Just totally destroyed it and as hard as Joe tried, he couldn&#39;t get that one<br/>
working. We figured the cable co. here would charge us $100.00. Well when<br/>
Joe went and told the lady he needed a new remote (they don&#39;t just give them<br/>
out) she asked what happened to the old one. He said his dog ate it and then<br/>
showed her all the pieces. She laughed so hard she gave him one for free!!!<br/>
Something to be said about honesty!!!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eaten books, pens, the electric massager, table and chairs, the wall<br/>
unit, a whole array of toys, pacifiers, baseball bat, magnets, towels and<br/>
who knows what I can&#39;t remember. Just the other day he ate my friends purse.<br/>
When he was crated, we would hear him chewing on the metal bars. He&#39;s like<br/>
the dog from the movie Sandlot!!!! A beast.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve never watched her before, but Kass & Kree said maybe the pet psychic<br/>
could pinpoint why the dogs feel the &quot;need&quot; to chew, especially when they<br/>
are so<br/>
loved. Then they thought perhaps it&#39;s something from their past lives and<br/>
nothing to do with the families who love them this time around.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t believe that lady at all. Sorry.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Well, Madame Kelly, the Psychic, will predict that they&#39;re still young-ish<br/>
and that their teeth are still setting into their jaws (&#39;til two years<br/>
old)---or<br/>
that they&#39;re anxious and chewing relieves the stress. They might need a LOT<br/>
more exercise---especially the Jack Russell---those dogs don&#39;t do well AT<br/>
ALL<br/>
crated for long periods.That family should have done more research before<br/>
bringing a Jack Russell home!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I would definitely pay for a reading with Madame Kelly. She&#39;s good!!!<br/>

Would she be willing to call the rescue group and ask them for tips on how <br/>
to manage him better so he doesn&#39;t ever need to become a rescue?  They&#39;d <br/>
probably be delighted to have someone working hard to keep their dog and <br/>
the rescue folks usually know their breed inside and out.<br/>

<br/>
That is so entirely cool. What was even funnier is, I wrote that post <br/>
sometime around 1 in the morning I think, then at 3:30 am I was watching TV and some <br/>
talk show had another animal psychic on. It was amazing. I was not by any <br/>
means being flip, my kids were very serious about the pets having brought into <br/>
this life something from a previous one. So yeah, obviously we believe in <br/>
reincarnation.<br/>

great, but if she is not willing, I just try to send the animals some loving <br/>
energy and hope they do not suffer too much in her home. YYYUUUKKK!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you read the book Communicating With Animals by Arthur Myers? It is very <br/>
interesting. There is a woman in the States named Penelope Smith (I think) <br/>
who does good work. The woman here is the wife of  a Vet I used to work for. She <br/>
is very cool to talk. I t is not about being a pet psychic, but about really <br/>
communicating with them. Good stuff for those who are open to it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Oh believe me if it wasn&#39;t the Bully (my husband&#39;s dog) that ate the <br/>
remotes<br/>
<br/>
he would have killed!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was little, I had a REALLY nice Sony VCR.  I&#39;ve never had a better <br/>
one since.  Kirby would put the remote in the little trash can in the living <br/>
room, and we would get it out.  We always checked the trash before taking it <br/>
out, to get the remote out.  All but once. &lt;g&gt;  *sigh*<br/>
