 </span></blockquote>United Methodists are the only Methodists with which I&#39;m familiar.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
to three different Methodist churches, all of that denomination. (Sang in an <br/>
Easter cantata...) The only differences I noted between them and the Southern <br/>
Baptists (without doing a lot of research--just looking through what was at <br/>
hand and from observation) was they have more of the traditional &quot;church <br/>
calendar&quot; (advent, Holy Week stuff that the Baptist didn&#39;t keep), and their <br/>
sermons are less fiery and brimstoney.  They had the option of infant baptism <br/>
or of those who requested it after the age of reason (meaning kids who <br/>
figured out that they wanted to accept Baptism to mark their understanding of <br/>
Christianity, or adults who had.  That, I think, is their &quot;born again&quot; <br/>
moment--wanting to acknowledge one&#39;s relationship with Christ in public, to <br/>
be baptized and join a church.<br/>
<br/>
I was always taught (by Southern Baptists) that baptism was symbolic of the <br/>
death, burial and ressurection of the old self, and coming up out of the <br/>
water was a symbolic moment of the new birth of a Christian.  But that was <br/>
symbol.  The REAL new birth was that moment of realization and desire to live <br/>
for Jesus and to accept that without Jesus&#39; sacrifice, eternal life would not <br/>
have been an option, and that only those who accept a personal relationship <br/>
with Jesus and God can be saved.<br/>
<br/>
So for G.Bush Jr., living in Texas, it&#39;s pretty important that he identify <br/>
himself as &quot;born again.&quot;  For many Christians ONLY &quot;born again&quot; Christians <br/>
are &quot;real Christians.&quot;<br/>

opposed to having been baptized as an infant?<br/>
<br/>
I also think I read that he came to the church (or returned?) after he <br/>
married Laura and settled down.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Infant baptism isn&#39;t &quot;counted&quot; by born-again folks, but someone who&#39;d already <br/>
been baptized could still go through the moment of turning his life over to <br/>
Jesus.  Whether he got baptized or not at that point might not matter as much <br/>
in some churches as others.<br/>
