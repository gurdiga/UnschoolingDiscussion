<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037640795">I guess what i&#39;m getting at is that it depends on what type<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;of medical care you need, and the everyday stuff is what they are not good <br/>
&gt;at.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah.  I agree with that.  A friend of mine was having some problems that <br/>
the dr. thought was her heart.  They sent her through many many tests before <br/>
they found out she was fine.  I don&#39;t think the doctors are bad either (not <br/>
all of them) but there is SO SO much red tape and paper generating that they <br/>
have to go through.<br/>
<br/>
Last Spring in Germany I was suffering terribly with allergies and nothing I <br/>
tried worked, I couldn&#39;t see because my eyes were swollen shut.  Luckily my <br/>
husband was a driver for a general and dh personally knew a PA at the <br/>
clinic, he was able to get me a prescription for Allegra.  But he told dh <br/>
that he had to break the rules to give it to me because only pilots and <br/>
other service members with high priority jobs are supposed to be given the <br/>
expensive stuff.<br/>

<br/>
And the allergy&#39;s not their fault, but with AIDS or something they might be <br/>
held liable for having provided or exposed people to (the Desert War <br/>
problems) they&#39;re going to get right on it, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s human nature, I suppose, to prioritize and do what will provide the best <br/>
health and longest life for the organization itself (armed services, school, <br/>
family...)<br/>

I was (wrongly, sorry) assuming blood transfusion.<br/>
<br/>
I was given untested or known bad (they weren&#39;t clear) blood through the HMO <br/>
here when I had Marty in 1989, but I came up negative.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad they&#39;re taking good care of you, though!<br/>
I&#39;m almost afraid to ask this, but no doubt you&#39;ve thought of it lots and <br/>
even probably know websites.  Does it seem women get better AIDS care than <br/>
men do?<br/>

<br></span></blockquote></font><font COLOR="#800080" SIZE="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial">No,statistically we get worse care.Women with aIDS die faster and in higher 
<br>numbers..meds trials vaccine trials etc are much harder to get in as a woman 
<br>,because of the old days when this was a mostly male thing..Another issue 
<br>meds are tested on males not on females who usually weigh &nbsp;a lot less then 
<br>men.As a result we get more med side effects because essentially we get 
<br>higher doses of drugs.Another issue is women have different symptoms.men get 
<br>kaposis Sarcome(the black blotches) women generally dont.Wmen get major 
<br>gynological problems like dysplaysia,cervical cancer etc..These things are 
<br>harder to catch them the usual male symptoms and often are not caught until 
<br>its to late..Things are changing dramatically nowdays but when I was 
<br>diagnosed 10 years ago it was VERY difficult..I was the first female with 
<br>AIDS a lot of the doctors had ever seen.The female -related AIDS symptoms had 
<br>not been studied well,and no drug trials or anything were open to me..Its 
<br>still hard to get &nbsp;them...You have to remember its still essentially 
<br>considered a mens disease.We women can throw them for a loop.
