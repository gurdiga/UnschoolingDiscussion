<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518720602">Hello!<br/>
  I just joined and thought I would write and introduce myself while things are quiet here.<br/>
 <br/>
  My name is Tracy-Lynn and I am 32 & have been married to Gary for a little over <br/>
13 1/2 years (since 10/85). Gary is a mail carrier and I have always been a stay at home mom. We have 4 sons (Crisstoffer-8/29/86, Andru-1/8/88, Wylliam-8/17/90 & Danyel-12/12/91. We call the 1st and 3rd Criss & BJ and the other to go by their full 1st names) who I have been hs&#39;ing for 4 years as of 6/1.<br/>
<br/>
  We take a &quot;freestyle&quot; approach to learning. I would have to say it is more unschooling geared. We have no schedules to follow and the boys choose when and what they do. I do &quot;map out&quot; lessons for them...just for them to have guides.<br/>
<br/>
  BJ is &quot;learning gifted&quot;--he has autistic tendancies, is emotionally delayed, is speech delayed & has Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) and mild Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He is such a bright kid (okay...I am really one sided when it comes to the boys and I think they are all very bright) and works so hard at over-coming the obstacles put in front of him. :-)<br/>
 <br/>
  We live in West Texas with our 6 dogs, 5 horned lizards and 1 turtle.<br/>
 <br/>
  I love meeting new friends who hs via email because I don&#39;t know any homeschoolers here. Well, I do but they are all a bit &#39;cliquish&quot; so I have never formed friendships. The only support groups here are very EXclusive and I don&#39;t want the boys around that (plus--they said we couldn&#39;t join since we are Jewish. But, even if we weren&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t join....I want my children around all sorts of people!).<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
  In Friendship, Tracy-Lynn</div>
