&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Health Club Membership<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;  For my birthday this year, my wife purchased me a week of private<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; lessons at the local health club.  Though still in great shape from when<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was on<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the varsity chess team in high school, I decided it was a good idea to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; go ahead<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and try it.  So I called and made reservations with someone named<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tanya, who said she is a 26 year old aerobics instructor and athletic<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; clothing<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; model.  My wife seemed very pleased with how enthusiastic I was to get<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; started...<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 1<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; They suggested I keep this &quot;exercise diary&quot; to chart my progress this<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; week.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Started the morning at 6:00 AM.  Tough to get up, but worth it when I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; arrived at the health club and Tanya was waiting for me.  She&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; something of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; a goddess, with blond hair and a dazzling white smile.  She showed me<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the machines and took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; seemed a  little alarmed that it was so high, but I think just standing<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; next to<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; her  in that outfit of hers added about ten points.  Enjoyed watching<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; aerobics class.  Tanya was very encouraging as I did my sit ups, though<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my gut<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; was already aching a little from holding it in the whole time I was<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; talking<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to  her.  This is going to be GREAT.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 2<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Took a whole pot of coffee to get me out the door, but I made it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tanya had me lie on my back and push this heavy iron bar up into the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; air.  Then she<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; put<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; weights on it, for heaven&#39;s sake!  Legs were a little wobbly on the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; treadmill, but I made it the full mile.  Her smile made it all worth it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Muscles feel GREAT.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 3<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying the tooth brush on the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; counter and moving my mouth back an forth over it.  I am certain that I<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; have developed a hernia in both pectorals.  Driving was okay as long as<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t try to steer.  I parked on top of a Volkswagen.  Tanya was a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; little<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; impatient with me and said my screaming was bothering the other club<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; members.  The treadmill hurt my chest so I did the stair monster.  Why<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; by<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the invention of elevators?  Tanya told me regular exercise would make<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; me<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; live longer.  I can&#39;t  imagine anything worse.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 4<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tanya was waiting for me with her sadistic vampire teeth in a full<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; snarl.  I can&#39;t help it if I was half an hour late.  It took me that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; long just<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to tie my shoes.  She wanted me to lift dumbbells.  Not a chance, Tanya.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; word &quot;dumb&quot; must be in there for a reason.  I hid in the men&#39;s room<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; until<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; she sent Lars looking for me.  As punishment she made me try the rowing<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; machine. It sank.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 5<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hate Tanya more than any human being has ever hated any other human<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; being in the history of the world.  If there was any part of my body not<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; extreme pain I would hit her with it.  She thought it would be a good<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; idea to work on my triceps.  Well, I have news for you Tanya, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; have<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; triceps.  And if you don&#39;t want dents in the floor don&#39;t hand me any<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; barbells.  I refuse to accept responsibility for the damage.  YOU went<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to sadist school, YOU are to blame.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The treadmill she thought I should try flung me back into a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; science teacher, which hurt like hell.  Why couldn&#39;t it have been<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; someone<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; softer,  like a music or social studies teacher?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 6<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Got Tanya&#39;s message on my answering machine wondering where I am.  I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; lacked the strength to use the TV remote so I watched eleven straight<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the weather channel.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; DAY 7<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, that&#39;s the week.  Thank goodness that&#39;s over.  Maybe next time my<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; wife will give me something a little more fun, like a decade of free<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; prostate exams or a total dental excision.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
