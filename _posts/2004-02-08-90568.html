My first reaction to this article was    :-P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
But after I got over that....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad to know that I can, without a doubt, expect my two free-range <br/>
TV viewing children to become fat, drunk, violent consumers with ADD. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fact. <br/>

&quot;http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/tvkelemen.htm&quot;http://www.simpletorem<br/>
ember.com/vitals/tvkelemen.htm&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
100% of the children cited in this article are schooled children.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
�And then we wonder why our children feel so hungry, bored, ugly, and<br/>
unpopular, and why they are so needy.�<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Does this describe any of our unschooled kids? I don�t think so, at least<br/>
not how they feel chronically. Nor does the exhibited behavior look like<br/>
Jayn. I guess I have to wait another 10-12 years to find out if she turns<br/>
out to be a murderer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
�monitored metabolic rates in eight- to twelve-year-old children under two<br/>
conditions: lying down in a dark room, and sitting up watching television.<br/>
In every case, the child&#39;s metabolic rate while sitting and watching<br/>
television was far lower than his metabolic rate while lying down in the<br/>
dark. Watching television is worse than doing nothing.�<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh at this idea, that Brazelton also alluded to, that one of the<br/>
activities of children was sitting or lying around in the dark � but awake.<br/>
Some children lie in the dark feeling scared. Up goes the heart rate. I bet<br/>
all of the tested children were staring into the dark, at the very least<br/>
feeling bored or anxious about when it would end, or straining to hear<br/>
anything (unspecified if all stimulous was removed or just the light) or<br/>
secretly laughing at how dopey it was � anyway not relaxing. Of course we<br/>
all on a daily basis watch our children engaging in one of these two<br/>
conditions � either staring at a television set or sitting in the dark for<br/>
extended periods (wonder what they showed that was so stultifying to the<br/>
test subjects � no mention of this in the article). A low metabolic rate<br/>
equals �worse� � maybe it equals relaxed and stress free. :P~<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even the information about getting obese is taken out of the wider context �<br/>
the increase of fatty and hidden sugar foods in our diets in general (like<br/>
grain fed beef and all the corn syrup everywhere), the increasing amounts of<br/>
time *schooled* children have to spend sitting at their desks or their<br/>
homework desks at ever younger ages, the more driving and less walking in<br/>
general. The investigators are examining/blaming one aspect of life outside<br/>
of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The article goes on to talk about the use of tv as babysitter, with the<br/>
conclusion that parents are therefore neglecting their children�s cognitive<br/>
and emotional development � even to the point of ceasing to believe they<br/>
have needs in these areas. I don�t know about the general population. I do<br/>
know that this is so far from the experience and intention of all the<br/>
homeschooling parents, and even more so the unschoolers I have met both her<br/>
and IRL, that the whole premise is ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don�t get involved in school bashing conversations � tempting as it is to<br/>
shoot fish in a barrel � so I will put up one quote I was guffawing at to<br/>
stand alone. (My black sense of humor perhaps):<br/>
<br/>
�A New York Times article detailed how &quot;teachers report they cannot hold the<br/>
attention of a kindergarten class for more than two or three minutes - the<br/>
average length of a Sesame Street segment. And they say the show is to<br/>
blame.&quot;��.. New York University&#39;s Professor Neil Postman summarized the<br/>
educators&#39; objection: &quot;We now know that Sesame Street encourages children to<br/>
love school only if school is like Sesame Street&quot; -- which it is not.� No<br/>
shit, Sherlock.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am so happy to see another :P~~~.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620481106">&lt;&lt;In 1993, one out of three high school seniors, one out of four<br/>
tenth-graders, and one out of seven eighth-graders got drunk at least once<br/>
every two weeks.5 Where are so many children learning to abuse alcohol? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From their families?  From parents who were raised in the fifties and<br/>
sixties with &quot;cocktail hour?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The more TV young teens watched, the more alcohol they drank three to<br/>
five years later &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gee, could that be because they felt disenfranchised and abandoned by their<br/>
families?  Nope, it&#39;s the evil TELEVISION.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Ten years after their first report, the United States Surgeon General and<br/>
National Institute of Mental Health issued an update clearly stating that<br/>
the latest evidence &quot;seems overwhelming that [watching] televised violence<br/>
and [acting with] aggression are positively correlated in children.&quot;4 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And of course, because children will play in a certain way immediatly after<br/>
viewing a program that correlates to continued violent behavior in their<br/>
lives?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; A California survey indicates that the more a student watches television,<br/>
the worse he does in school. Wilson Riles, California schools<br/>
superintendent, said Thursday that no matter how much homework the students<br/>
did, how intelligent they were, or how much money their parents earned, the<br/>
relationship between television and test scores was practically identical.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

Ugh.<br/>

<br/>
LOLOLOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I get the point.  Truth be told, when I found the article and re-read<br/>
it, I had the same reactions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why I was so taken by it the first time I saw it.  But it was<br/>
last summer when I read it I think, and that was the same time I relented<br/>
and bought spoiled meat from a door to door salesman for an outrageous price<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I must have been out of my mind for awhile then &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am still interested in hearing everyone&#39;s comments on this<br/>

Thanks so much!<br/>

<br/>
shit, Sherlock. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having been around and planning to be a teacher when Sesame Street was new, I <br/>
read a lot of the early theory and justification of Children&#39;s Television <br/>
Workshop which was doing Sesame Street and The Electric Company.<br/>
<br/>
They knew (professionals) that young children&#39;s attention span was that <br/>
small.  <br/>
They designed Sesame Street around realities. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They knew that children were memorizing jingles from commercials, and were <br/>
discussing funny things they had seen on commercials.   So they planned <br/>
educational &quot;commercials&quot; (and so did Schoolhouse Rock, based on that same research).<br/>
<br/>
For later educators to come along and BLAME those programs for the realities <br/>
on which they are based is one more reason to suspect professionalism in <br/>
education.   (JJ, don&#39;t get out of your chair, it&#39;s okay.  Dumbasses DO make the <br/>
rest look bad; it can&#39;t be helped.)<br/>
<br/>
If the purpose of learning the alphabet or to count to twenty is a real human <br/>
need (which I think it is) then where and how the children learn it is <br/>
irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s at stake in such discussions as whether Sesame Street causes natural <br/>
six-year-old reactions is NOT about learning.  It&#39;s about job security for <br/>
teachers, and about making the lives of first grade teachers (NOT of first grade <br/>
students) more tolerable and justifiable.<br/>
<br/>
If you paint over all the windows in a school, the teacher is more <br/>
interesting than the windows.  If you leave them unpainted and kids have a choice <br/>
between paying attention to the teacher and looking out the window at birds, trees, <br/>
clouds, maybe people, maybe cars, that makes the teacher&#39;s job easier.<br/>
<br/>
Most teachers would rather paint over the windows than work at being more <br/>
interesting than birds, clouds and trees.<br/>
<br/>
With those studies, they want to paint over the TV screens in homes across <br/>
America so they are by comparison more interesting.<br/>

<br/>
Also - ALL of these studies only look at correlation. CORRELATION does <br/>
not imply CAUSATION.<br/>

Could it be that kids who drink more, are more violent, and have other <br/>
problems also watch TV more because they HAVE problems? Could it be <br/>
that it isn&#39;t TV that is causing the problems? DUH!<br/>

<br/>
How true!  And those same Central Kentucky educators have reduced<br/>
unstructured play time in elementary school (formerly known as recess)<br/>
to one 10 to 15 minute &quot;SPA&quot; (special physical activity?) session per<br/>
day.  Not to mention that if the child misbehaves or doesn&#39;t finish<br/>
his/her assignments, losing SPA time is usually the first<br/>
&quot;punishment&quot;.  But apparently no one here sees any correlation with<br/>
increased behavior problems in the classroom, the vast increase in<br/>
diagnosed ADHD, obesity, etc.  Sheesh.<br/>

programs with kids (Blues Clues & Dora do the pre-k and k rounds here <br/>
in NYC) months before airing them. I know a couple of people that are <br/>
part of the production team of Blues Clues. Each episode takes about 9 <br/>
months to produce --from conception to airing. That&#39;s how complicated <br/>
the whole process is --lots of testing of all kinds. They have several <br/>
physcologists and EDDs on staff.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being in one of those voice-over groups for Sesame Street. I <br/>
was in a Head Start programs and took some kids of my class to view and <br/>
&#39;comment&#39; several segment; especially those numbers one (where the kids <br/>
shout out the numbers).  Some of the cast came to the school as well. <br/>
Ironically, the guy that plays Luis happens to be my neighbor down here <br/>
in the East Village. I always see him either coming from the post <br/>
office or from picking up his dry-cleaning. It&#39;s weird because I&#39;ve <br/>
basically have had this man &#39;image&#39; (or character) in my life for about <br/>
35 years (I was about 3 years old when they did those voice-overs).<br/>
