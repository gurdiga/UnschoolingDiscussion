<br/>
Kids know these &quot;junk&quot; foods exist.  They see them advertised on TV.. They <br/>
see them prominently displayed in stores.. They see other kids eating <br/>
them...They (reasonably) ask for them and want to try them.   NOT providing <br/>
them only makes the promotions of the commerical world seem even more <br/>
enticing.   Kids will chose from a variety of foods if a variety is offered. <br/>
