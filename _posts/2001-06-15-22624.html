&gt; Senate passes education bill<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON (AP) - In a triumph for President Bush, the Senate<br/>
overwhelmingly<br/>
&gt; passed groundbreaking education legislation Thursday that requires annual<br/>
&gt; math and reading tests for millions of schoolchildren as part of an effort<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; improve the nation&#39;s public schools. The vote was 91-8, and set the stage<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a summer of negotiations on a final compromise among the White House, the<br/>
&gt; GOP-controlled House and the Senate, newly under Democratic management.<br/>
&gt; President Bush, traveling in Europe, issued a statement that hailed the<br/>
vote<br/>
&gt; and said it meant &quot;we are close to a monumental achievement with<br/>
bipartisan<br/>
&gt; support. As a result of our efforts, we<br/>
&gt; have wide agreement on the principles of education reform.&quot; Senate passage<br/>
&gt; came after a bumpy, last-minute detour into the emotionally charged issue<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the Boy Scouts and homosexuality.<br/>

How can they give the same tests and require the same minimum performance<br/>

(Wouldn&#39;t it be more reasonable to take the average test score and divide<br/>
it by the funding level to calculate the return on the dollar?)<br/>

Here, Florida, what we do is give more $$ to the schools with higher test <br/>
scores.  Take away $$ from schools with lower scores.  Makes sense, huh??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835597325">Well, they did change several of the things in the bill.  One of the main<br/>
issues they changed is that each state gets to determine what test to use<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011012502">I agree with Lynda.  My public school child complained that all they did was<br/>
study to pass the test.  The teachers were not allowed to teach math,<br/>
science - etc. unless it was on the test.  This leaves little room for<br/>
creativity and means more bookwork.<br/>
