<div id="ygrps-yiv-880163360">Wow Nancy!!<br/>
<br/>
I can not say I am suprised but I would love to be a fly sitting at <br/>
the school boards office right now!!  The day I walked by the <br/>
bookstore and saw a study guide for the FCAT that was the same format <br/>
as the SAT/GRE study guides I knew I had made the right decision.  <br/>
Imagine sending my kids to school all those hours and then requiring <br/>
more work after and they still may not pass.  The standardized <br/>
testing really bothers me! Partly because some people are just better <br/>
test takers.  My husband got B&#39;s for all my A&#39;s but you know what he <br/>
remembers far more than me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693160429">I was raised in Broward County (Ft. Lauderdale).  Sounds like the school<br/>
system is still living up to its usual standards! And to think that I still<br/>
get jumped on by teachers when they find out my kids don&#39;t go to school.<br/>
