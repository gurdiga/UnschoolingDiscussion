&lt;&lt; I have been in therapy more less for the last decade.  And it is<br/>
 helpful.  But I&#39;m not &quot;there&quot; yet in terms of my feelings about myself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re spiritual or not, so just ignore this if it doesn&#39;t <br/>
interest you.<br/>
But some things that helped me personally, were Deepak Chopras writings, <br/>
especially &quot;The Path to Love&quot;.<br/>
Also Sara Ban Breathnachs &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; and  &quot;Excavating your Authentic <br/>
Self&quot;<br/>
Very helpful to me.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
