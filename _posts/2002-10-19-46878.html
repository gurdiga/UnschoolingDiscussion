<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633734376">I have just pulled my children from public school this year and after <br/>
researching many life styles have chosen to work hard at a life style of <br/>
unschooling.  Now for a few quick questions.  <br/>
<br/>
       1.  Where do you stand with TV?  If children chose, may they chose to <br/>
watch TV all day.  My 15 year old would never do anything else if I would let <br/>
her.<br/>
       2.  Cleaning there rooms.... Do you require that your kids keep their <br/>

did this.<br/>
       3.  What about when their messiness intrude on others space.  I have a <br/>
child that always leave their clothes on the bathroom floor.  It drives <br/>
everyone else crazy to have to step over it.<br/>
       4  How do your husband on board.  And I also have my Mother moving in <br/>
and Father-in-law living with us (he has Alztimers and after my dad died Mom <br/>
got very lonely and is moving in with us.)  I know my Mom will have a really <br/>
hard time with my daughters messy room.  Do I let my daughter deal with her <br/>
grandma?  She told grandma she would do better when she gets moved in which <br/>
should be in the next few months.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141626262">I am pretty new to unschooling too, but here are some of my thoughts!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        1.  Where do you stand with TV?  If children chose, <br/>
&gt; may they chose to <br/>
&gt; watch TV all day.  My 15 year old would never do anything <br/>
&gt; else if I would let <br/>
&gt; her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought this of my 5 yo until I tried it. I have found that if<br/>
his brother and I are doing interesting things, he usually comes<br/>
and joins us. I have found that he is more likely to turn the tv<br/>
off on his own. The tv is on more, but he is not watching it<br/>
constantly. He does watch more tv then he used to (when we <br/>
had limits, about a month ago) but it is a balance that I actually<br/>
feel pretty comfortable with. I am also looking at tv and seeing what<br/>
he is getting out of it, which contrary to popular opinion is quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        2.  Cleaning there rooms.... Do you require that your <br/>
&gt; kids keep their <br/>
&gt; room clean or just close the door.  I&#39;m afraid I would run <br/>
&gt; out of dishes if I <br/>
&gt; did this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son is only 5, but I plan on just closing the door. If I run out of<br/>
dishes, I would know where to find them and could go get them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        3.  What about when their messiness intrude on others <br/>
&gt; space.  I have a <br/>
&gt; child that always leave their clothes on the bathroom floor.  <br/>
&gt; It drives <br/>
&gt; everyone else crazy to have to step over it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It drove my dh nuts because I always left my pjs on the bathroom <br/>
floor. I tried to remember putting them away after my shower, but<br/>
it never worked. I read an organizing book that said to create <br/>
a system around what you already do...so I put a basket on the floor<br/>
where I throw my pj&#39;s when I get into the shower. A hook did not work <br/>
because I would not take the time to hang it up. Throwing my pjs into<br/>
a basket on the floor is pretty much the same thing as throwing them<br/>
on the floor, so it works. DH is happy and so am I. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        4  How do your husband on board.  And I also have my <br/>
&gt; Mother moving in <br/>

&gt; deal with her <br/>
&gt; grandma?  She told grandma she would do better when she gets <br/>
&gt; moved in which <br/>
&gt; should be in the next few months.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Still working on the dh thing. Keep talking. Personally I would talk with<br/>
the grandmother and try help her understand. I would also talk with your<br/>
dd work on coming up with ideas of how she can handle the grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
Just some quick thoughts...I am sure others will have more!<br/>

things they checked was the bedrooms.  She was told to have them <br/>
clean by the next day or the children would be removed.  I don&#39;t ever <br/>
want to face a situation like that.  When I say clean, I mean that <br/>
clothes can&#39;t be on the floor up to the knees.  No dirty dishes or <br/>
dirty clothes on the floor.  There has to be a path to the bed.  <br/>
Right now dd&#39;s big problem is too much stuff in too small of a room. <br/>
I&#39;ve never forbidden it, but for some reason no one ever brings food <br/>
upstairs except for water on the nightstand.  <br/>

Keep in mind that she&#39;s spent the better part of her life *having* to sit <br/>
still listening to teachers drone on and on and on... For a while she may <br/>
feel the need to just sit in front of the TV...but I&#39;m *guessing* it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t/won&#39;t last forever :) As for where we stand w/the TV, our kids <br/>
have unlimited access to it, some days they watch more than others, and on <br/>
the &quot;more&quot; days, it&#39;s not for more than a couple of hours at a time.<br/>

We just keep the doors closed. Actually, they keep their doors closed <br/>
themselves because they don&#39;t want the cats in their rooms.&lt;g&gt; If they take <br/>
dishes (usually glasses) into their rooms, we ask them to bring those out <br/>
to be washed. If they forget, and we spot them when we go in to put clothes <br/>
away or whatever, we bring them out ourselves :)<br/>

Maybe putting a basket, hamper, or something in there that anyone can toss <br/>
clothes into, whether it&#39;s theirs or not. Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060328937">&lt;&lt;&lt;      1.  Where do you stand with TV?  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We fully quit limiting TV about 5 months ago and I can tell a big difference in their viewing styles.  Before, they felt like they were &#39;missing out&#39; on something if they went to play outside instead of watching every Simpson&#39;s episode. (Had to be inside @ 5p. to watch it every day no matter how much fun they were having.)   Now, they spend much more time on other interests.   At first, my ds would watch hours of Animal Planet, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Discovery, etc....  Hours and hours.  Gradually, I think he got bored with the TV.   Lately, he has been spending hours playing with his Transformers, army guys, looking at toy catalogs (gotta have that list ready for Mema), whittling, playing Sorry with dd, and even reading.  He now only watches about 2-3 hours a day.  Somedays he spends the whole day outside and doesn&#39;t watch at all.  And only because I quit controlling it.  At least that&#39;s the way it seems to me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       &lt;&lt;&lt;2.  Cleaning there rooms.... Do you require that your kids keep their <br/>
room clean or just close the door. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; rooms are marginal............at least by my standards.  There are dirty clothes, Polly Pocket pieces, Barbie stuff, books, and lots of shoes in my dd&#39;s floor.  I like things very neat.  She doesn&#39;t.  We usually try to compromise on room cleaning.  I won&#39;t go round up their dirty clothes, so they have to take them to the laundry room if they want them washed.  Usually, when I am doing laundry, I have to haul my stuff from my bathroom and I will let everyone know &quot;Hey guys, I&#39;m washing some clothes.........better bring &#39;em out if you want them clean.&quot;  Usually, they are glad that their favorite outfit will get washed and everyone scurries about to get dirty stuff to the laundry room.  It works for us.  :)  I have also started using a milk crate for each family member&#39;s clean clothes.  When it is full, they can take it to their room and put away the stuff.  ( I read that on this board, I think.  Great idea!  Thanks!)<br/>
<br/>
As for the dirty dishes, I kinda do the same thing when I load the dishwasher daily.  I will announce that &quot;I need all the dirty dishes, please.  I am gonna run the d/w.&quot;   Dishes start flowing back into the kitchen pretty quickly without much grumbling.  I think it&#39;s because they have seen the &#39;science experiments&#39; that can come from dirty dishes left in a room too long.  I also remind them that if they want to be able to eat/drink things throughout the house, that they really have to be able to get their dirty dishes back to the sink.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       &lt;&lt;&lt;3.  What about when their messiness intrude on others space.  I have a <br/>
child that always leave their clothes on the bathroom floor.  It drives <br/>
everyone else crazy to have to step over it.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am too neat freaky to let the stuff lay around too long.  Usually about once or twice a day I will announce that it&#39;s getting too messy for me in here...... living room, kitchen, bathroom... any &#39;public area&#39;.   They grumble a little but they do know &#39;mom is just that way about it&#39; and usually comply without too much trouble.  We work together to make it look neater, gather up the dirty dishes, put away the forgotten card game, and pick up the trash. ( my dd thinks the floor is her trash can....any wrapper she opens still falls to the floor.)  It only takes about 10-15 minutes to pick up, Mom is happier, and they have the room to start a new project/game/puzzle. <br/>

  watch TV all day.  My 15 year old would never do anything else if I would let <br/>
  her.<br/>
  ** I have the TV programmed to only allow kid-friendly channels (til they get older anyway), and they can watch as much on those channels as they want. For other things, me or DH has to sit with them to watch. Usually the TV is on all day, but no one watches more than a few minutes here or there. They usually listen while doing something else. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         2.  Cleaning there rooms.... Do you require that your kids keep their <br/>
  room clean or just close the door.  I&#39;m afraid I would run out of dishes if I <br/>
  did this.<br/>
<br/>
  ** Room clean-up day is on Saturday&#39;s.... they clean their rooms, I clean mine. We help each other if there are any huge messes or if we just really don&#39;t feel like cleaning. Afterwards, I vacuume rooms. Dishes are not allowed out of the kitchen/dining room area, for any of us, as we live in a state with big ant and roach problems. The only way to keep the bugs out is to make sure there are no crumbs whatsoever for them to find. We do have our own mugs (those that you can put a decorated paper in) and can take water anywhere in the house. Everything else is glass, so it doesn&#39;t leave the kitchen either. <br/>
<br/>
         3.  What about when their messiness intrude on others space.  I have a <br/>
  child that always leave their clothes on the bathroom floor.  It drives <br/>
  everyone else crazy to have to step over it.<br/>
<br/>
  ** I pick up the living room every night, and put others&#39; belongings in their own basket and take it to their rooms. My boys switch days cleaning up their bathroom. My oldest cleans the kitchen table and takes stuff to whoever&#39;s room it belongs in. <br/>
<br/>
         4  How do your husband on board.  And I also have my Mother moving in <br/>
  and Father-in-law living with us (he has Alztimers and after my dad died Mom <br/>
  got very lonely and is moving in with us.)  I know my Mom will have a really <br/>
  hard time with my daughters messy room.  Do I let my daughter deal with her <br/>
  grandma?  She told grandma she would do better when she gets moved in which <br/>
  should be in the next few months.  <br/>
<br/>
  ** Just explain that it&#39;s not important to you guys as a family to have spotless bedrooms. Keep the door shut if it bothers anyone. I wouldn&#39;t want your daughter to feel she HAS to be neat and clean to keep grandma happy, that isn&#39;t her responsibility. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-839680794">Hey Heidi<br/>
<br/>
Since your kids are much older than mine, my experience is probably quite different and I won&#39;t be of any help. One thing I noticed is your dishes in the rooms. We as a family always have our drinks and food in the kitchen and that helps with that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as convincing your husband, I think the only thing to do is to talk and share all the information you have. I constantly tell him about something I read somewhere or print something out to be read and I share all the little bits that I pick up here. Mine is quite open to unschooling, but sometimes he feels uneasy with the parenting practices that go together with the philosophy. I shamelesly repeat phrases that I pick up here. Last night we talked about how I think we as a family should encourage team efforts more - instead of saying please pick up your blocks, say let&#39;s pick up your blocks. His response was that would only teach him to do nothing at all. I asked why expect the worst from him and I could see that thought really clicked with him.<br/>
<br/>
Again this morning we spoke about him pushing independence - I feel it will happen when my DS is ready - last week someone mentioned how she often reminds her husband that he had 30 years before kids to himself and probably will have another 30 after kids. I shared that with him and again I could see just how it clicked for him. <br/>
<br/>
For Dads, like us, there is the fear of making the wrong choices, but with all the information they will feel less anxious.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I keep food out of the bedrooms because in our lovely Army quarters, we have<br/>
bugs and other ickys.  When my son&#39;s room gets out of hand, I usually help<br/>

just picked it up?  I&#39;ve occasionally asked Tim to go back and pick up<br/>

Stories from successful unschoolers?  Is he willing to trust you for a year?<br/>
I talk a lot about what I read, both here, in books, etc.  My husband is<br/>
fine with the idea of unschooling.  It&#39;s these &quot;wierd&quot; parenting ideas I<br/>
come up with from here that bug him....<br/>

<br/>
I think you and your daughter need to come to a consenses on her room before<br/>
Grandma arrives.  Ignore it, you clean it, close the door, whatever.  As<br/>
long as Grandma and grandaughter aren&#39;t sharing a room, it shouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
problem, right?  But no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s your daughter&#39;s place to have to<br/>
&quot;deal with it&quot; with her grandma.  You need to discuss those kind of issues<br/>
with your Mom, in my opinion.  She is your daughter to raise.  Grandma had<br/>
her chance, and now it&#39;s your turn.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you have a great time unschooling.  We do, every day!<br/>

have &quot;family movie night&quot; once a week where we pick a movie and watch <br/>
it as a family. We sometimes do other movie days. Recently we rented <br/>
Lord of the Rings and watched it every day for a solid week! But <br/>
that&#39;s pretty rare. Usually just the monday movie night.<br/>

all toys. We have a bunch of bins so that everything more or less has <br/>
a place. It&#39;s pretty quick and painless, and we help the kids out so <br/>
it&#39;s fun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope. Public spaces stay picked up. The kids are pretty good about <br/>
taking stuff to the clothes hamper or shoes to the rack. I just <br/>
mention it and they&#39;ll come and get it when they&#39;re at a stopping <br/>
point in their play.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it would depend on how much it matters that things be clean. <br/>
A good friend had an Altzheimer&#39;s relative living with them, and they <br/>
had to be extra careful about what got left around because she would <br/>
take things and hide them places, or write with pen on books, or <br/>
whatever. So if it is going to be a health or safety hazard, or if <br/>
your daughter will lose things, she might want to choose to be extra <br/>
vigilant. Alternatively, you could get some kind of lock for her <br/>
door. If your mom is just going to have a hard time because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t like messy rooms, well, I guess it&#39;s up to you how much you <br/>
want to allow your mom&#39;s feelings to have a say in what your daughter <br/>
experiences. Personally, I separate my parents from our own parenting <br/>
decisions. They can agree or disagree with them, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
change what we decide. It was important to us to make this <br/>
distinction, so that the kids don&#39;t feel obliged to live up to a set <br/>
of standards that we don&#39;t agree with.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck on your parenting/unschooling journey. Sounds like you <br/>
will have your hands, and house, full!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;        1.  Where do you stand with TV?  If children chose, may they<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The TV is just on of many things my kids may choose to do. <br/>
Usually they don&#39;t. Usually the Play Staion is going on the TV.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it bothers someone they should pick it up. It doesn&#39;t bother me <br/>
but it does bother my kids when their stuff doesn&#39;t get washed cos <br/>
its on the floor. I made it clear I only wash what turns up next to <br/>
the machine.<br/>

daughter? Is she old enough to deal with her grandma or does she <br/>
need your help?<br/>
