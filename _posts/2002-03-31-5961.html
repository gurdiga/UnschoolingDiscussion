<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388381263">Hey Kate,<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you have tremendous reason to brag.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the kids your younger sister is looking to have someone<br/>
sponsor....  If she has trouble finding someone, have her send the<br/>
information to me.  I know quite a few folks, including myself, who might be<br/>
interested.<br/>
