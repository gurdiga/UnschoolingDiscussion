<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194243404">My son joined football a week or so ago and he has decided to not play. <br/>
Friday he began to cry and said he didn&#39;t want to go (he also had the flu). He said <br/>
he knows we paid the 75.00 for him to play but it just isn&#39;t the way he <br/>
remembers.<br/>
<br/>
I have had some concerns about the rules for instance:1. If the child gets in <br/>
trouble in school they will also be punished on the field. (Doesn&#39;t apply to <br/>
us but I thought it was soo wrong) 2. Coaches have been swearing at the kids, <br/>
just hits me wrong..<br/>
and 3 practice has been m-f way too much for peewee I think. Oh and not to <br/>
mention the boy who says suck my 9 and other penile references. Ugh... <br/>
<br/>
I signed an agreement that our funds are non refundable but under the <br/>
circumstances should I try to get it back? What would you all do? Would you tell them <br/>
the concerns or no? <br/>
I am not really wanting to look like the odd ball homeschoolers (its all the <br/>
same to people here) but I don&#39;t know what else to do. My husband began to <br/>
comment today and I just looked at him and shook my head. He was bothered by the <br/>
money spent not the quitting part. <br/>
<br/>
Am I a wimpy parent for letting him just quit? I feel in my gut it would be <br/>
wrong to make him play and I know there are parents that do make their kids <br/>
stick it out as they say its all part of life. I could never do that and never <br/>
have.<br/>

<br/>
In my opinion, I would ask your son how he feels.  Does he want to quit?  To<br/>
me that is your answer.   I think it is much more wimpy if you force him to<br/>
stay just because you are afraid of what the other mothers would think.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose you joined, oh, I don&#39;t know, lets say a health club.  You go to<br/>
this health club and find that the physical therapists swear at you and the<br/>
other patrons sit around making dirty jokes, and then you find out the<br/>
program will do you no good unless you go there 5 days a week, would you<br/>
stick it out because you paid for it or would you quit?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What would you all do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tell my son cheerfully, &quot;Not a problem. I try new things, or try again old<br/>
things, about a million times per year and often find they&#39;re not for me<br/>
right now. Sometimes I go back to them, sometimes I don&#39;t. And sometimes I<br/>
find something I really enjoy and stick with it. Lots of people, probably<br/>
most people, do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would you<br/>
&gt; tell them<br/>
&gt; the concerns or no?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. It never hurts to politely inform organized groups about what<br/>
you think they&#39;re doing wrong AND right. Keep it calm and factual.&#92;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He was bothered by the<br/>
&gt; money spent not the quitting part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a husband problem and his own thing to work on. :) How many projects<br/>
or activities has your husband started, this year or over the past few<br/>
years, that he spent some significant amount of money on (say $75 or more)<br/>
and rarely if ever touches these days?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Am I a wimpy parent for letting him just quit? I feel in my gut it would be<br/>

&gt; have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t appreciate it if your husband decided to<br/>
make you continue in an activity or hobby you didn&#39;t want to. Being short<br/>
and dependent on us doesn&#39;t make a child less deserving of the same respect<br/>
of their time and interest.<br/>

If Jayn decides she doesn&#39;t want to continue ice-skating we will not<br/>
return, no arguments or cajoling - it is entirely her choice to do<br/>
something that is for her benefit and enjoyment, not mine. Your gut is<br/>
the best barometer you have. Going against all the crummy conventional<br/>
wisdom about &quot;making&quot; kids stick out bad situations shows you are the<br/>
polar opposite of a wimpy parent. Maybe ask your husband if your son&#39;s<br/>
love and trust are worth more or less than $75. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not :-)<br/>
 I&#39;d let him quit if he wanted too but I would make an attempt to get <br/>
the money back. Generally complaining and sheer pig-headedness and <br/>
always got me a refund. I even get the bank to give me back the money <br/>
they charge me when I go overdrawn :-)<br/>
I would talk to the coach and remind him that these are 9 yo and you <br/>
didn&#39;t sign up for swearing and bullying. Its a game! I would them <br/>
hassle whoever does the money.<br/>
<br/>
As for letting him quit.....it was his choice to start the game, it <br/>
should be his choice to finish it when he wants, withouth guilt over the <br/>
money. He&#39;s a bit young for financial burdens. I don&#39;t undertsnd parents <br/>
who *make* their child stick it out. It breeds resentment and loathing <br/>
of the game or activity. Activities should be fun, not an obligation.<br/>
My daughter quit Tae kwon Do after a year. I felt a bit of <br/>
disappointment cos she was doing so well, but it was her doing it, not <br/>
me! A year later she&#39;d like to restart which is fi ne by me even though <br/>
it will be for a short time only as we leave the country some time <br/>
before Xmas. She will have fun in those weeks she does it.<br/>

You might write the complaints down and ask for your money back, and if they <br/>
say no then distribute your complaints to other parents, say you KNOW you <br/>
won&#39;t have a refund, but that doesn&#39;t mean they have to put up with abusive <br/>

He wants to quit, he&#39;s crying, he&#39;s being sworn at, cut your losses.  <br/>

I understand about the money, $75 is a lot, for me anyway, but honestly, not <br/>
as important as your kid.  <br/>
<br/>
Chalk it up as a learning experience.  Research more before you sign up for <br/>
stuff.  Is there possibly any other team anywhere near you where your kid could <br/>
be safer and have more fun?  Could you try and start one?  I betcha you&#39;re <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044993123">I hear ya. I read him (my husband) someone&#39;s post last night and he just <br/>
looked at me. He knows what its like to be teased and yelled at its a soft spot <br/>
with him. The post about the health club hit me like a brick it was so true. <br/>
<br/>
I did tell Dustin that I didn&#39;t blame him for not wanting to play I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
either. I also told him not to worry about the money. No one here in our town <br/>
gets the caring parent stuff it drives me nuts how they think. A mom at <br/>
football that I liked said Wednesday that kids need to deal with the hurdles in <br/>
school and not run away from it. Of coarse this was after we discussed what <br/>
choices we had made as a family. <br/>
<br/>
He bought a 4 wheeler cheep yesterday. He is at the garage with his dad <br/>
welding a piece then off to the ATV store. He is on cloud nine. He has wanted a 4 <br/>
wheeler for a couple years now. He sold his motorcycle on Ebay for 600, bought <br/>
his ATV yesterday for 200. They thought the engine was seized turns out it was <br/>
just a timing chain. So with 400 in his pocket he is out shopping for some <br/>
cool gear and a helmet.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are all less stressed now that football has been kicked to the <br/>
curb.<br/>

Is what people think of you more important that your<br/>

when you word it that way it seems so obvious, doesn&#39;t<br/>

He hates rules and regs.   We go to the forest preserve, some kids will join <br/>
in, and we all have fun.  Baseball, football, soccer, those can all be pick up <br/>
games.  Basketball is harder cause we have to find a open court, but some <br/>
people have hoops in their driveways, here, in the alleys, too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631998453">Yeah I was thinking that on Friday but once he got his four wheeler he said <br/>
he was defiantly done. Not only that but it has been hard for me also because <br/>
Nicholas the youngest (14 mo) fractured his wrist crawling off a toddler bed in <br/>
my daughters room and now has a cast on. They didn&#39;t splint because they said <br/>
he would take it off but it is hard to keep him clean and limited baths. The <br/>
playground is right next to the football field. A splint for play and a second <br/>
back up would have been better.<br/>

My husband says don&#39;t turn in the gear until our funds are returned. I think <br/>
I am going to do that. They can challenge me all they want.  Seems odd that <br/>
they are too young to work if they want but they can push them for 2 hrs and 45 <br/>
minutes with three 10 second water breaks and hostile answers if they need to <br/>
use the restroom. <br/>

This summer has been a great summer for friends and him getting out so he is <br/>

glad now that I didn&#39;t quit.<br/>
<br/>
But I agree if after much examination, and not just a surface level I want to <br/>
quit, the child is miserable doing what he committed to do, then by all means <br/>
let him leave the team.<br/>
<br/>
Sports should be about fun and exercise and being part of a team.  Negativity <br/>
isn&#39;t something that makes playing a sport fun, especially if a family <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to be there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814727539">Write a letter to the director of the program, not the coaches, and <br/>
explain what your problems are with the program and why you want your <br/>
money refunded. Yes, you signed an agreement, but it was in good faith - <br/>
meaning you expected something from the program and you didn&#39;t get that. <br/>
Be polite, professional. We have done this before. They were snotty, and <br/>
only pro-rated the refund - after only two practices. We no longer take <br/>
programs at this particular organization but that&#39;s okay. There are <br/>
better programs over in Ocean City and our kids have a lot of friends <br/>
there, so now we drive the 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. People who provide youth programming <br/>
have a responsibility to provide good programming - and abusive language <br/>
doesn&#39;t fall into that category. If they turn you down, write another <br/>
letter to someone higher up the food chain, and copy the first person. <br/>
This often works very well. The key is to be reasonable, calm, and state <br/>
the facts.  (I was a coach, and have worked in sports administration - <br/>
there is no reason to tolerate this. Kids have a right to a safe place <br/>
to play, and that includes the language and behavior of the coaches and <br/>
other participants.)<br/>
<br/>
As for &quot;letting him quit&quot; -- kids do much better at sports when it&#39;s fun <br/>
and their idea. As a coach, I hated having kids who didn&#39;t want to be <br/>
there - they could be the nicest kid in the world, but they should be <br/>
there because they want to. (just my two cents, fwiw).  I coached <br/>
soccer, swimming and softball. My kids like dance and rock climbing (not <br/>
the same kids). I coached state champs and all-americans in swimming - <br/>
my kids hate competitive swimming. go figure. :-)  ... the two best <br/>
swimmers I ever coached were there because it was their idea. imho, kids <br/>
have to try lots of stuff - some find what they like right away, some <br/>
have to try a lot of stuff, and sometimes we get stuck paying for stuff <br/>
that doesn&#39;t last. (anyone want to buy some lacrosse stuff? :-D<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

&gt; circumstances should I try to get it back? What would you all do? Would<br/>
&gt; you tell them the concerns or no?....<br/>
&gt; Am I a wimpy parent for letting him just quit? I feel in my gut it would<br/>
&gt; be wrong to make him play and I know there are parents that do make<br/>
&gt; their kids stick it out as they say its all part of life. I could never<br/>
