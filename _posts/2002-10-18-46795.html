<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395056471">My 3 year old would desperately like to be just like her big sister and have a penpal.  Any takers? Any other little chidren like to get a letter just to them in the mail? LMK,  we&#39;ve already got one letter written (well, mom typed it up, but I&#39;m sure you expected that!)<br/>
<br/>
Just send me your snail mail address and Tehila&#39;s missive will be off to you in no time...<br/>
