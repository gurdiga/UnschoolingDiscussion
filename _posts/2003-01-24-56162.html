<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; I guess part of my problem is still that I feel like it shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always be<br/>
&gt;  me asking.  I feel like they should notice too.  &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand this, but it&#39;s silly. It&#39;s like saying &quot;My husband should<br/>
 </span></blockquote>just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; KNOW what I need&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know Ren, I really don&#39;t think this is silly.  I see it happen between<br/>
people all the time.  For example, I am at my mom&#39;s house, after supper she<br/>
gets up and starts clearing the table.  She does not have to ask me to help<br/>
her, I just think she would like someone to help her, so I get up and do it.<br/>
I go to put clothes in the washer, and find a wet load in there, I put them<br/>
in the dryer.  If there are clothes in the dryer I take them out and fold<br/>
them No one asks me to, I just see things that need to be done, and I do it<br/>
(and I know that my mom would do the same for me).<br/>
<br/>
Someone a while back was talking about being in a work<br/>
situation and not understanding why people just didn&#39;t jump in and help when<br/>
something needed to be done.  She said she was always able to do this, but<br/>
sometimes saw people standing around and not jumping in.<br/>
<br/>
What I am saying is that I don&#39;t want my kids to be the ones who don&#39;t know<br/>
how to jump in and help.  I want them to have the ability to see what needs<br/>
to be done and do it.  Granted, dishes may never come to mind.  But, you<br/>
know, when we are at someone else&#39;s house, I do see them occasionally doing<br/>
things like helping to clear the table or pick up.  But I know some other<br/>
kids who would ALWAYS be there and ask what they could do to help. They<br/>
would do the work willingly, and with a smile.  (And they do this at home<br/>
too, I have seen them)   My son even has one friend who comes over and when<br/>
he sees me working asks if there is anything he can do (this would be while<br/>
my son is playing video games, and this kid always wants to play a game, but<br/>
quits about ten minutes into it).  So, what I am wanting is kids who think<br/>
about the other guy (whether it is mom or someone else) and if that other<br/>
guy is working they WANT to help.  I don&#39;t want to have to ask all the time,<br/>
because when I do then the responsibility for doing things is still on my<br/>
shoulders.  Which maybe it should be, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
As I am rambling on, I am realizing that part of this whole dilemna is<br/>
coming from the difficulties I have in asking my husband to help.  He gets<br/>
mad when I ask, and very quickly accuses me of nagging.  It is a little<br/>
better than it used to be, but I am also very conscious of what I ask him to<br/>
do.  I never ask him to pick up after himself etc. because I just get yelled<br/>
at.  Of course, that all goes back to his childhood with an abusive parent<br/>
who yelled all the time and ws physically abusive.  He has come such a long<br/>
way from there, and I know that.  But the remnants still affect our family.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am looking for a way to help my children see a need and respond to it,<br/>
whether or not someone asks them to help.<br/>
<br/>
What I do know about this, is that my previous method hasn&#39;t helped very<br/>
much.  I often have suggested that they help someone do something when we<br/>
are with a group.  My son, especially, often responds quite negatively to<br/>
this request.  I have then sometimes told him that he had to, and other<br/>
times told him to forget it (but probably not with the best attitude on my<br/>
part).<br/>
<br/>
Still trying to learn here, thanks!<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

<br/>
Speaking as someone who has been on the receiving end of maternal<br/>
prodding, what I visualize (which may not be what you do) feels very<br/>
much like a public reprimand.  Shy children do not like to be shoved<br/>
into the spotlight and told that they should be doing more.  Even un-shy<br/>
children may not be thrilled about it.<br/>
<br/>
Anticipating the situation beforehand and telling your child that<br/>
cleanup is fairer if everyone helps might work better.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents,<br/>

SEE YOU offer to help. It really WORKS better this way, Erin, rather than <br/>
coercing them in any way to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I was in a parenting class at school when Cameron was in 2nd grade. As usual, <br/>
there&#39;s a lot of preaching to the choir, &#39;cause the folks that voluntarily <br/>
show up to this kind of thing ARE already decent parents. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway---there was a woman who bitched about her then 13-year-old would bust <br/>
a gut rather than do what the mother requested. Example: Mom would ask the <br/>
daughter to get out every morning as they backed out of the drive and pick up <br/>
the neighbor&#39;s newspaper and take it to her porch. Daughter would complain, <br/>
but grudgingly DO it &#39;cause Mom made her. She didn&#39;t want to, and Mom <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand WHY this was a problem. The neighbor was almost 90 years <br/>
old, and this was such a sweet gesture.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested that MOM get out and sweetly put the paper on the neighbor&#39;s <br/>
porch. As she returned to the car, she should say (once) that Mrs. Smith is <br/>
so old and frail that I&#39;m afraid she might get hurt walking down her stairs <br/>
to get the paper. If MOM would do that every day---just quietly pick up the <br/>
paper and get back in the car, HER generosity and kindness would be an <br/>
example the girls would have for a lifetime. By TELLING the older daughter to <br/>
do it, she was telling the girls that THEIR feelings weren&#39;t as important to <br/>
MOM as the little old lady&#39;s or the mom&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
She had NEVER even CONSIDERED this! <br/>
<br/>
About a month or two later, she came up to me and thanked me and said that <br/>
that&#39;s what she had finally done. That the younger daughter (8?) had started <br/>
trying to BEAT her to the paper. (The neighbor had gotten a few laughs at <br/>
their expense but was delighted.) The teen had once or twice gotten out on <br/>
her OWN to help out when she was the only one capable (others sick or <br/>
whatever).<br/>
<br/>
Forcing good behavior MAY result in good behavior. Modeling almost ensures <br/>
it! Withour resentment.<br/>

But, this was my original point.  I do believe I am modeling it.  I am the<br/>
Sunday School teacher, 4H leader, AWANA leader, VBS leader, one who goes and<br/>
helps do dishes when it isn&#39;t my turn (they have specific groups who are<br/>
suppose to do it, but I don&#39;t pay attention and just do it anyway) after a<br/>
wedding, or funeral or whatever.  I am the adult that when someone asks me<br/>
to do something, I almost always say yes.  I am always the one helping as<br/>
long as I am physically able (I do have knee problems, and had a total knee<br/>
in July, so sometimes I am not able to pick up a table or something like<br/>
that).<br/>
<br/>
When I ask my children to help, before the event, I am not asking them to<br/>
help without me, I am asking them to help with me.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I will just give up on this one.  Thanks to all of you for your<br/>
suggestions.<br/>

Just a thought here but if your kids see that your husband doesn&#39;t help out <br/>
and it all still gets done, why should they always volunteer, when &quot;asking&quot; <br/>
dad doesn&#39;t even work? I see his attitude affecting the kids and therefor <br/>
also yours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295296762">Oh, definitely things I do want to do.  And they know that.  At least most<br/>
of the time.  I do get tired like everyone else sometimes and wish I didn&#39;t<br/>
have certain obligations, and they know that too.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about this more last night, and realizing something.  Though<br/>
the kids don&#39;t want to help when we are in public, my daughter is usually<br/>
right there when I am working on any project related to these activities.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, we are going to be making some clay pens for our next 4H<br/>
meeting.  Meghan found the idea in a book and was making them for fun.  When<br/>
I was trying to think up an idea for club, I asked if we could make those<br/>
pens.  She said sure, started figuring out how much clay we would need, what<br/>
the cost would be, wrote up a list of other supplies we would need etc.<br/>
<br/>
So, like someone else said, I am just going to have to give up my dream of<br/>
what I think helpful is, and take and look and be thankful for what they do<br/>
contribute.  I will do the dishes and line up the shoes, etc. etc. etc., and<br/>
be more careful to notice the things they do to help on their own terms.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
