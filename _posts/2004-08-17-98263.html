I  started doing an internal exercise about this.  New Gamecube games can be  <br/>
as much as 50 bucks.  Wow, that&#39;s a lot of money for a simple video  <br/>
game!!  However, if you think of it in terms of time played (and  enjoyed) <br/>
it can be as little as 50 cents an hour.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been going  through cheap plastic sword sets.  At about 10 bucks a <br/>
set, they last  a week or two.  Easily down to 50 cents an hour.  And if you  <br/>
figure the amount of fun had for that 50 cents!!!!  Now THAT&#39;S  VALUE!!<br/>

I think the two toys that had the best play value (cost per hour of play)  <br/>
were the Brio Trains (which were very expensive when Juls was little. Now you  <br/>
can get cheaper knock-offs) andthe Beanie Babies.<br/>
 <br/>
We had dozens of Beanie Babies, and we did something radical with them. We  <br/>
took off the tags and PLAYED with them!<br/>
 <br/>
Julian played with those things for so many hours for several years. Five  <br/>
bucks apiece, and WAY worth it.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519156730">Another really great toy is a baby doll for some kids.  My youngest daughter got HOURS of play out of baby dolls.  She just loves them.  She is moving away from that  now, but she is the only one of my kids who loved to play with them.  Its sort of a precious memory for me I guess.  I really wish I could have afforded more &quot;stuff&quot; for her to use with her baby dolls, but she did ok with what she had.<br/>
<br/>
Matchbox cars are another great one.  All 3 of my kids loved matchboxes.  My son spent hours in the dirt playing with them, with his friend, up until he was about 13.<br/>
<br/>
And my youngest also got a lot out of Bratz dolls, creating her own dollhouse out of every day stuff, and spreading it out all over the living room.  Very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950838502">We&#39;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of beanie babies too.  Two of the kids<br/>
favorites have gone almost everywhere with us for the last three years.<br/>
They&#39;ve been buried in dirt piles, gone swimming at the beach, been stirred<br/>
into flour water goop the kids were cooking with, fallen from great heights,<br/>
and washed a million times.  They are still going strong.  We definitely got<br/>
our money&#39;s worth out of those toys when you consider the hours played with.<br/>
The Breyers are more expensive but when you consider the hours they are<br/>
played with the hourly rate is still low.  I love looking at it that way.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s funny but the other day as I was printing out the 10th campground map<br/>
each for the kids I had a flashing thought that we were wasting paper.  But<br/>
they played with those twenty sheets of paper for almost two days straight.<br/>
They picked campgrounds from all over the country, we printed the campground<br/>
site maps, then they wrote in the names of each of the animals that were<br/>
staying at those campsites.  They planned the route they would take to stay<br/>
at different camp sites all over the country so they could start in ME, go<br/>
to the west coast, and camp their way back to ME.  Pretty cool when you<br/>
think about it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28375923">my daughter came up with the idea of decorating the christmas tree with all <br/>
of her beanie babies. we just put on the lights and then used clothes pins <br/>
to hook them on. it was the best christmas tree and the easiest clean up <br/>
i&#39;ve ever had. just unpinned them and threw them in the basket.<br/>

Alex has four beanies he still plays with.  There&#39;s<br/>
Farting Duck ( I don&#39;t know why he farts, you&#39;ll have<br/>
to ask him) Nut and Nutz, two squirrels that guard his<br/>
headboard, and Waddle, his lovey he has to say good<br/>
nite to before he goes to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Altho once we forgot him and he can hear Alex from<br/>
wherever he might be, which is a good thing. lol <br/>
<br/>
He even has a goodnite song he sings to them.  <br/>
<br/>
*so cute* <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;d prolly kill me if he heard me blabbing about<br/>
this, so shhh, don&#39;t say anything, K? <br/>
