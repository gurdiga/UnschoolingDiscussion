I recommend signing up with an umbrella school for the reduction in stress <br/>
levels!:) AEI (Alternative Education Institute) is a great one, and only $15 per <br/>
year, per child...less than an eval.<br/>
If you sign up now, you simply inform the district you have terminated your <br/>
Homeschool program and you&#39;re done. They&#39;ll try to pressure you to do an eval. <br/>
for the year, but you don&#39;t legally have to....your kids simply won&#39;t be put <br/>
in the next grade level. Whoopee.<br/>
Great Ren thats what I wanted to hear.  I&#39;m going to sign up this week then.  <br/>
Thanks very much.  Stepheny<br/>
