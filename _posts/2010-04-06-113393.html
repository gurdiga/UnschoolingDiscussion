<div id="ygrps-yiv-939762123">As a postscript, my children have begun piano lessons and I have started playing again.  This time it is for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding Unschooling, from time to time I doubt my ability to Unschool.  I don&#39;t know if it has to do with seeing other kids that are in other activites: Girl Scouts (homeschooled) etc or just doubting that I am   providing enough educational stimulation for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
As a family, emotionally we are doing well. We have been through more than we have cared to, and our life is finally at a place where we can relax.  <br/>
