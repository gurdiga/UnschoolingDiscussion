&lt;&lt;  I still find <br/>
<br/>
myself offering him a text or workbook to pull some explanations out <br/>
<br/>
of when I can&#39;t answer his math questions &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I pull out a dictionary if I don&#39;t know a word&#39;s definition well enough to <br/>
just explain it to a kid myself.<br/>
<br/>
I get maps or encyclopedias when they ask me qestions I can&#39;t answer off the <br/>
top of my head.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a problem with finding similar things in a book if he&#39;s asking <br/>
for help.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, though, after the conference and Pam Sorooshian&#39;s workshops you <br/>
yourself will have more math ideas bubbling in your own head and won&#39;t feel <br/>
so much need to give up and get the book before doing a little brainstorming <br/>
WITH him!<br/>
