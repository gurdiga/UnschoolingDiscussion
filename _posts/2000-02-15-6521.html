<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634927735">I&#39;m a long-time lurker, but this current debate and the responses to it have<br/>
finally spurred me to write. It&#39;s been wonderfully eye-opening to read such<br/>
a breadth of beliefs, and I hope that everyone still feels welcome on the<br/>
list. None of us would have had the chance to &quot;meet&quot; folks from such diverse<br/>
belief systems in our day to day lives, and I value hearing from all of you.<br/>
And Wini, I loved your response. I too, try to simplify things around here,<br/>
and battle the consumerism that seems to creep up from some awful place in<br/>
my brain. And I, too, cast the occasional glance at the closest preschool on<br/>
a day where the choruses of &quot;he hurt my feelings&quot; try to drown out my faith<br/>
in unschooling!<br/>
