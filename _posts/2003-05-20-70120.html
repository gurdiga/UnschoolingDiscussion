&lt;&lt;It&#39;s just that the things she does don&#39;t include other<br/>
kids her age  We are still hanging in there and looking for opportunities<br/>
for<br/>
her to meet some homeschool friends.   She has decided to stay home next<br/>
school year too, so she must not be too distressed over not having any<br/>
friends ( yet)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have never believed that children, at a certain age need to socialize and<br/>
have friends. Meaning it&#39;s not necessary for all children at a certain age.<br/>
Whether they are in school or not. Of course school kids really don&#39;t have<br/>
much of a choice as they are all herded together anyway. If they aren&#39;t<br/>
ready for that interaction, they are usually branded the shy or odd child<br/>
and made fun of and left out. I have noticed, that with the homeschoolers I<br/>
know here, the children aren&#39;t looking for that interaction at a young age<br/>
as frequently as most people would think. I have just noticed recently that<br/>
Joseph (8) and Sierra (7) are wanting to get together with friends to do<br/>
things. But again, the 2 times a week they do are more than enough. The rest<br/>
of the time is spent with us as a family or even out in public interacting,<br/>
but not necessarily with &quot;friends.&quot; Of course I see that it might change as<br/>
they get older. Noticing it already I would imagine they will want to be<br/>
more social. I don&#39;t see any introverted children in this family!<br/>

friends , &quot;yet&quot;, not, she is not distressed &quot;yet&quot;..   It&#39;s really a small <br/>
grammatical thing, but when I reread it, I thought, &quot;that sounds like I am <br/>
just waiting for her to be distressed&quot;..<br/>

I agree totally.  Ethan my 11 yo has never really had any close friends and <br/>
he doesnt care to have any.  He never complained that the didnt have any <br/>
friends in school, but he DID complain about how mean the other kids were to <br/>
him.   I thought that maybe he was just afraid to try to make friends, he <br/>
feared rejection.   Now that he has been home for 5 months, he shows <br/>
absolultely no interest in making friends.   He will play with other kids if <br/>
he is in a situation, but he would just as soon pass on it.   I really think <br/>
he is just an introvert that does not need others to &quot;occupy&quot; him.   My dh is <br/>
much the same way.   Anna and JP enjoy being around other kids ( all ages) <br/>
and they tend to seek them out and easily engage in play and conversation.  <br/>
But, they don&#39;t sit at home and feel lonely without thier friends.  When Anna <br/>
came out of school, she missed her friends.  She had friends that she saw and <br/>
talked to every day and she missed that.  But, obviously, she didnt miss it <br/>
too much because she didnt make any efforts to stay in touch with her school <br/>
friends<br/>
<br/>
   Really, I think I worry more over her &quot;friendships&quot; or lack thereof, than <br/>
she does.   I recall my  own youth ( and what other point of reference do I <br/>
have, personally, I mean?) and I remember having lots of friends, lots of <br/>
talking on the phone, sleepovers, day trips, and I loved every minute of it.  <br/>
  I have to keep reminding myself that Anna is not me.  Her life is not like <br/>
mine was.   And, even though she may not have the busy social life that I <br/>
had, she has LOTS and LOTS of other things that I didnt have.<br/>

<br/>
Interestingly enough, my older son Noah (5 1/2), who is *definitely* an<br/>
introvert (just like his mama!!) is constantly asking for dh and I to set up<br/>
playdates with his friends. At this point, all his friends are schooled<br/>
kids, and I think this will be a big issue next year when all of these<br/>
friends start grade 1 and won&#39;t be available during the day any longer.<br/>
Also, two friends that he really enjoys a lot are girls and I&#39;m wondering<br/>
how long it&#39;s going to take before that &quot;boy/girl&quot; thing starts happening<br/>
(as in, boys only play with boys, girls only play with girls- seems to be<br/>
the prevalent attitude for schooled kids). We&#39;re working on finding some<br/>
homeschooled friends (there aren&#39;t a great many unschoolers around here) but<br/>
the local homeschool drop-in which we attend sporadically hasn&#39;t led to any<br/>
new friendships yet.<br/>
<br/>
Noah really values the friends he has now (most of them have played together<br/>
since infancy or toddlerhood) and I&#39;m hoping there will be some way to<br/>
maintain these friendships despite school but I sense there may be a lot of<br/>
difficulties ahead.<br/>

Well Joseph and Sierra have no unschooled friends but all their friends are<br/>
homeschoolers. I haven&#39;t had any problems because of that or made to feel<br/>
the odd man out. I have found that just attending the regular support group<br/>
outtings before left me feeling like there weren&#39;t many kids available for<br/>
my two. The kids were way older or way younger than mine. But now that I<br/>
know Joseph and Sierra want to have get together&#39;s, I&#39;m able to find more<br/>
kids around their age to play with. I started actively looking for them. Our<br/>
local group has focus groups and I found another homeschool group in the<br/>
area that is all inclusive. Of course the homeschool sports camp helps also,<br/>
although they have parted for the summer now. Just hang in there and keep<br/>
digging around and putting out the word that you are looking for some<br/>
homeschool moms to get together with weekly. When I first started I thought<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t find anyone really wanting to do something on a regular basis,<br/>
now we are busy as we want to be. It&#39;s the water park again tomorrow and I<br/>
put the word out and new people always show. You&#39;ll find someone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381563737">My son has one good friend his age and a grown friend (sort of an adopted<br/>
uncle, if you will.)  If he could go back and forth between them he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
care if he never had another friend or anyone else to play with.  Other than<br/>
me, his dad and brother that is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one who expects to have a social whirl, I suppose.  I  know it would<br/>
be easier on me if he knew and liked some of the kids in the local<br/>
homeschool community, because then when I wanted to go to something or take<br/>
his brother I could say, &quot;But so and so will be there.&quot;  That&#39;s my issue<br/>
though, not his.<br/>

playdates)</div>
