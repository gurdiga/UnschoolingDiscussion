<div id="ygrps-yiv-282500356">&lt;&lt;We live as close to unschooling as I know how to do right now&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s OK.  But sometimes we can&#39;t find what we are looking for unless<br/>
some one tells us where we have missed the trail, where we went from &quot;warm&quot;<br/>
to &quot;cold&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
5 years ago, I took my oldest out of first grade and started reading the<br/>
internet trying to find out anything about homeschooling.  I went to the AOL<br/>
homeschooling boards and ran into Sandra.  I&#39;m sure she doesn&#39;t remember but<br/>
I most certainly do.  I have rarely been that angry with another adult.  And<br/>
I have said it many times on various boards that I owe Sandra a lot.  She<br/>
saved my kids from many years of meanness because she called them like she<br/>
saw them.<br/>
<br/>
I am a &quot;nice&quot; mom, the one who listens to her kids, who plays with her kids,<br/>
who tries not to overly coerse her kids.  But I wasn&#39;t unschooling, I wasn&#39;t<br/>
trusting.  I see it now because I have moved to that level of comfort that I<br/>
know the kids are doing great in their own unique ways and I don&#39;t have to<br/>
measure them against themselves, other kids or society&#39;s standards.  I just<br/>
love them and am awestruck by them.  But I didn&#39;t see it then.  I was just<br/>
angry and defensive.  It took awhile.<br/>
<br/>
I know it feels personal now.  Just breathe easy.  Take it in and let it<br/>
ferment and distill in your heart and life.  Just like wine, you will see<br/>
the sediment start to sink to the bottom of your existence and you can just<br/>
bottle up the good stuff.<br/>
