<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295945322">&lt;&lt;Sending them home is a good idea<br/>
but only because we value our kids in a different light to what some<br/>
bureaucrats do. so what are those differences.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well..... I don&#39;t see my children as *consumers of products*, nor as *makers of products*, which sort  of lets me out of the whole economic dynamic that is currently in place.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I surely don&#39;t define success in the same way.  Matter of fact, defining success is probably not something I even care to do.  Each stage of my life has brought a different meaning to what I found sucessful.  The year shortly after having 3 children in 4.5 years sucess was being able to stand up straight and remembering to brush my teeth. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m not sure that we know how to do, is allow everyone the room to define for issues for themselves. Even within the homeschooling community there are people who would like to control what other homeschoolers do. I&#39;d just like to get to the point where being and having differences was an okay thing, no matter what those differences are.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m feeling blue today, so take my words with a grain of salt.  :)</div>

I totally understand that last sentence Lisa, and I&#39;m not kidding! :)<br/>
<br/>
Although I aspire to not selling my personal list of &quot;important to have/important to knows,&quot;<br/>
there are a few things in my mind, that a person ought to know or have before setting up their own home/life/finances outside of their parents&#39; house.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like for my kids to know a bit about investing/budgetting/spending/saving $$--enough to feel somewhat confident.<br/>
I&#39;d like for my kids to be able to shop for and cook at least a week&#39;s worth of meals for themselves.<br/>
I&#39;d like for them to have at least one skill/talent that they take pleasure in-and are able to make money from if need be-whether they choose to follow that for their &quot;career&quot; or not.<br/>
They should be able to drive, and most importantly:<br/>
I hope they know HOW to get information and use it well.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about all I can ask for as a parent.<br/>
If they choose not to aquire any of these things, then they still have my support and love and pride in them--because I believe they will do/be/have all the right things for who they are ultimately.<br/>
<br/>
My mind might need some changing along the way--and it might be their job to do it. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609949021">My last post listed all the practical things I&#39;d *like* for my kids to aquire in their time at home~<br/>
but the more important issues I left off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like for them to become deeply generous of soul, bonded, and believing that their words, actions, thoughts and prayers make a difference. <br/>
I&#39;d like for them to be passionate about their ideals and their dreams, and expressive (whatever form that expression takes). <br/>
I&#39;d like for them to be honest-first with themselves-then with the world, and I&#39;d like for them to find joy/love in all they do and who they are daily becomming.<br/>
