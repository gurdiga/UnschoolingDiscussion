<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611322309"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I thought it was a term that the Christians put on others with polytheistic beliefs but has now been accepted as a self-descriptive term.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry, I meant to answer this, but just did not have time to address it.  It is sort of a large question.  There are a lot of websites and information online (you can go to IdahoPagan even, and learn more in their Pagan University section.)  Pagan is a loose term that refers to many non-Judeo Christian religions.  It is not limited to poly-theistic practices, although there are many of those.  It can refer to beliefs as diverse as the Strega, Asartu, Voodoo, Celtic, Norse/Viking, Druid, Native American Shaminism, Eastern Religions, and many other traditions.<br/>
<br/>
Many folks who are one of these non-mainstream religions refer to themselves as Pagan, as a catch all phrase.  Some because it is much easier than explaining to every person they meet what Strega is, for instance.  Some because they do not ascribe to any particular classical set of beliefs, but rather have an eclectic set of personal traditions and beliefs.  Some for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Please look around on the internet for information about what it is, if you are interested in learning more.  I believe the biggest and fastest growing group in this country and Great Britain is the Wiccans.  You can find LOTS of information about that online.<br/>

Its nice to see that your not afraid to say who you are. I admire that in <br/>
you. I have learned not to talk to much. Mostly because not too mant people <br/>
understand it and the run away look they have, makes me uneasy. Thats how I <br/>
learned to deal with the questions about unschooling short and sweet and dont <br/>
ask me any more questions unless your TRUELY interested. Anyway I just wanted <br/>
to comment on that.<br/>

It&#39;s a shame more people are not open to hearing about other belief systems.  <br/>
I find it very interesting to learn about all kinds of beliefs.  I recently <br/>
bought a book on World Religions and there is a section on Pagans and it&#39;s <br/>
broken down into different beliefs.  I&#39;ll now have a reason to read it and <br/>
find out even more.  Thanks  Nance,<br/>
