I don&#39;t know, maybe you&#39;d have just been older.  I became a Mom at 26, and I<br/>
while I personally matured a lot between 20 and 26, I don&#39;t think my<br/>
parenting would have benn much different 6 years earlier.  Tim&#39;s been a big<br/>
help in that learning curve!<br/>

I became a mom the first time at the age of 27, and it was tough for me. The <br/>
second time around I was 37 and the difference was unbelievable. Third child <br/>
I was 38 and the 4th child I was 42. I just kept getting better and better <br/>
at it. I honestly think if I would have waited longer the first time around, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have made so many mistakes. Then again, maybe it was <br/>
circumstances too. Who can know for sure?<br/>
