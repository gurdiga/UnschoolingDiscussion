  Not parenting at all would have been even tidier though -- did you <br/>
think of that before having children?<br/>
<br/>
       I ask sincerely, because I actually DID think of that, and was an <br/>
avowed non-parent all through my 20s for such reasons. <br/>
<br/>
       There was a book out then called The Baby Trap, by Ellen Peck. It&#39;s <br/>
both embarassing and amusing to me now to recall how much that book <br/>
influenced <br/>
me at the time. The book said I deserved a lifestyle that wasn&#39;t &quot;childless&quot; <br/>
but child-FREE, and that sounded pretty good to me. I had a career and money, <br/>
my <br/>
own place, my own car, and complete control over how their daily use and <br/>
maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
       It&#39;s an acceptable and even cheerful kind of compromise for me now, <br/>
but it wouldn&#39;t have been for that woman I used to be with my sporty little <br/>
car <br/>
in the 70s. That woman would read this and think I was the one who had gone <br/>
insane. &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t it be great, though, if people REALLY spent time deciding whether <br/>
they REALLY wanted kids. Most people don&#39;t. Some people don&#39;t to tragic results. <br/>
The idea is that people should do what makes them happy. For some, raising <br/>
children makes them happy and fulfilled. Other people have demanding work that <br/>
does that, or want to play. It doesn&#39;t make them bad people to decide that <br/>
that&#39;s what they want. (I&#39;m not implying that you meant that.)<br/>
<br/>
For me, it wasn&#39;t an issue of giving up little sports cars and going out to <br/>
clubs and things. We were working in a day care center that we loved and <br/>
enjoying playing with kids all day anyway. We went home and sat around the living <br/>
room. We figured...hey...our lives are already domestic and boring...might as <br/>
well have a kid. LOL<br/>
