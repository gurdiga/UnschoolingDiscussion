&gt; Sugar is made by pressing sugar cane to extract the sugary syrup, <br/>
&gt; then boiling the syrup numerous times until what you have left are <br/>
&gt; sugar crystals.  They are brown.  The process to make them white <br/>
&gt; involves bone char (gross, but natural), and it is a filterization <br/>

 </span></blockquote>From <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sucrose.com/bonechar.html">http://www.sucrose.com/bonechar.html</a> : <br/>
&quot;Animal Bones&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We are frequently asked about the use of &#39;animal bones&#39; in making<br/>
sugar, usually by people with dietary concerns such as vegetarians or<br/>
vegans or people just concerned for the animals.<br/>
<br/>
In the past a material called &#39;bone char&#39; was used extensively to<br/>
remove colour from raw cane sugar in the refining process. Modern<br/>
technology has largely replaced bone char decolourisation but it is<br/>
still used in a few refineries so one cannot be categoric about<br/>
refined cane sugar being suitable for all people&#39;s points of view. It<br/>
is not used in making white beet sugar and it is not used in making<br/>
raw cane sugar.<br/>
<br/>
Where bone char is still used, it is prepared by almost incinerating<br/>
animal bones to leave activated carbon - a bit like making wood<br/>
charcoal. [The refiners did not and ordinarily do not use wood<br/>
charcoal to do the decolourisation because it is too fragile and would<br/>
break up in service.] The bones are obtained from abattoirs and hence<br/>
from animals fit for human consumption and of course they are heated<br/>
to great temperatures : there is no risk of New Variant CJD/BSE/Mad<br/>
Cow disease and no risk of Foot and Mouth disease.<br/>
<br/>
If you are concerned about the possibility of the sugar you use having<br/>
been treated by bone char decolourisation then you have several<br/>
choices. If you want white sugar and sugar from sugar beets is<br/>
available then use that. If you are not sure if the local sugar is<br/>
from beets or cane, write to the manufacturer and ask them, adding<br/>
that, if it is cane sugar, whether they still use bone char. If you<br/>
want brown sugar, do not assume that it is inherently untreated. Many<br/>
brown sugars are actually white sugar which has been coated with<br/>
molasses. Again, check with the manufacturer if you are concerned.<br/>
<br/>
We hope that you found this useful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019374344">Thanks for the bone char info Schuyler.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize that many processors had stopped using bone char, good to know.<br/>
<br/>
I really like &quot;Sugar in the Raw&quot; and use a lot of brown sugar, but I don&#39;t avoid white sugar even though I am veggie.  I really don&#39;t like beet sugar as well as cane sugar.  Animal products are everywhere, it is hard to avoid unless you want to completely make yourself crazy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had to comment on this (from sucrose.com):<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;of course they are heated to great temperatures : there is no risk of New Variant CJD/BSE/Mad Cow disease &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
CJD/BSE/Mad Cow is caused by prions which are not destroyed or &quot;killed&quot; (killed in quotes because prions are not alive, though people talk about them as if they are) by heat.  I am not saying that there is any risk, I don&#39;t believe there is, but that statement makes no sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821922125">I took a look at the references listed at these websites, many of them have to do with high sugar/starch diets.  I don&#39;t think anyone here is advocating a high sugar diet.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to be pretty &quot;crunchy,&quot;  my son (10 next month) had no refined sugar before his first birthday.  His first birthday cake was his first taste of not only sugar but also artificial color.  My views have changed enormously.<br/>
<br/>
Last week my son and I made brownies.  We ate half of the batter raw (yum!) while watching a movie and playing a board game (Simpson&#39;s Clue), and baked the rest.  There are still quite a few brownies left, a week later.  But the plums and nectarines that I got the same day are long gone.  So is the milk, regular and  chocolate soy, and string cheese.   Given choices, and the knowledge that I trust my son&#39;s choices, he makes great nutritional decisions.  I guarantee that I eat more sugar than he does.  <br/>
<br/>
Vilifying sugar will only make it a forbidden fruit, and most people, adults and children alike,  will sneak to get it, or binge when it is available.  I am not talking about diseases or syndromes where sugar is not tolerated, but I do think in those cases that true information should be given to the child.   <br/>
