<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883235019">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
While sitting watching my son&#39;s (he&#39;s turning 7 very soon) violin lesson<br/>
today, I was wondering about something and thought i&#39;d ask the group here<br/>
for expereinces and feedback. Ayden has been playing violin for about a year<br/>
(and was &quot;playing&quot; 2 sticks for years before that). He loves it. His younger<br/>
sister (2.5yo) also goes with him to lessons now and stands behind him and<br/>
saws and scratches away on her little violin with much enthusiasm while he<br/>
plays. Both children clearly have a good ear and a passionate relationship<br/>
with music and violin.<br/>
<br/>
I have two questions i&#39;d welcome feedback on.<br/>
<br/>
1) Today, while sitting in on the lesson (sometimes i stay, sometimes i do<br/>
groceries) I again noticed how much the teacher praises. She really does it<br/>
quite a bit and says things like &quot;That was excellent!&quot; or asks things like<br/>
&quot;Now doesn&#39;t that feel good when you play it without mistakes?&quot; things i<br/>
would never say and wish she wouldn&#39;t either. Despite this, she is really a<br/>
great teacher--she&#39;s young and hip and very creative and down-to-earth and<br/>
inspires the kids with her own obvious love of music, fiddling etc. Above<br/>
all, they both absolutely adore her and feel very safe with her (she&#39;s the<br/>
only &quot;stranger&quot; I&#39;ve ever been able to leave my 2.5yo with!). i really like<br/>
her too. She has a special relationship with Ayden and she has kept him on<br/>
as a student even while cutting other more experienced students when she<br/>
reduced her schedule.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen the praising interfere with Ayden&#39;s learning or his<br/>
enthusiasm (yet) and in some ways i hate to get in there when it&#39;s all going<br/>
well and he&#39;s happy, *but* i also feel uncomfortable with the praise and<br/>
somewhat &quot;schooly&quot; language. I sometimes think she only does this because<br/>
she thinks she &quot;should&quot; and that she would be open to learning how to do it<br/>
differently. She&#39;s been very open to my input so far and i know i can talk<br/>
with her but want to be succinct, specific and helpful. She also gives<br/>
stickers, which Ayden loves (the stickers) but i don&#39;t like her giving them<br/>
for &quot;good playing&quot;  even if his playing is always &quot;good&quot;. Any thoughts of<br/>
how i could quickly and easily explain why i&#39;d rather she didn&#39;t use praise<br/>
as &quot;motivation&quot; and how she could speak instead? Or should i leave it alone<br/>
as it doesn&#39;t appear to bother ds?<br/>
<br/>
2) Practicing. I&#39;ve spoken with the teacher about this and told her that i<br/>
will not force Ayden to practice and after a year of watching his enthusiasm<br/>
while other kids drifted off, she really got it and encourages but doesn&#39;t<br/>
push it. However, we all see (including Ayden) how quickly and noticably his<br/>
playing improves when he practices. He says he would like to practice more<br/>
and wants my help because he doesn&#39;t always think of it but i&#39;m not very<br/>
organised and have baggage about being nagged to practice so i tend to just<br/>
shy away, often forget and am not very helpful in this regard. Could someone<br/>
share with me really concrete ways they help their children to remember<br/>
practicing in a way that really respects their integrity and natural<br/>
learning?<br/>
<br/>
THanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623596208">On the first part, maybe you could gift her with a copy of &quot;Punished by <br/>
Rewards.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On the second part, maybe make a little abacus thing (wire with beads to to <br/>
move from one side to another and upward loop?) with seven big beads, and after <br/>
he practices seven times in a week he&#39;s done with moving the beads.  He might <br/>
practice twice some days.  And if he doesn&#39;t practice seven times, maybe you <br/>
could leave the undone ones and he could see if he &quot;caught up&quot; by doing more <br/>
than seven, but anytime you want to start over, just move the beads back to <br/>
&quot;start&quot; without penalty or noting it.<br/>
<br/>
It would be an indicator without words or numbers or a written record to <br/>
haunt him OR for him to save for years to be proud of.   Fleeting, so that the <br/>
playing is more important than than the record of having played.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m curious, Ingrid. Do you mind saying who the teacher is? My <br/>
granddaughter (9) recently started taking violin from a young woman who <br/>
plays both classical and fiddle. She has done some things my daughter <br/>
wasn&#39;t comfortable with (fining kids in a group class if they played out of <br/>
turn for instance) though they&#39;re mostly quite happy with her. Just curious <br/>
if this is the same person, since we&#39;re in the same area. Skye&#39;s teacher&#39;s <br/>
name is Vell. (I have no idea how it&#39;s actually spelled. That&#39;s what it <br/>
sounds like.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The one thing that seems to really get Skye playing a lot is spending time <br/>
with her friends who also play. They always take their violins to each <br/>
other&#39;s house and almost always play together. Does Ayden have any friends <br/>
who play?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>nope but they&#39;re family. Ayden&#39;s teacher is the sister of Skye&#39;s teacher,<br/>
who in my very limited experience with her seem definitely more &quot;strict&quot; and<br/>
not quite as open as Ayden&#39;s teacher. However, Ayden&#39;s teacher, Jaime, is<br/>
very much in demand and pretty well impossible to get in with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The one thing that seems to really get Skye playing a lot is spending time<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THat sounds great. I wish Ayden had more friends who play--he doesn&#39;t<br/>
particularly connect with the boys in his age group lesson and the girl his<br/>
age is away all the time at private school. Most of Ayden&#39;s friends are<br/>
young active boys who are very curious about his violin but inevitably just<br/>
twist the pegs and untune it :-).<br/>
I think i&#39;d like to see if we can connect more with older kids who play.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that inspires him is listening to music but we have a pretty<br/>
limited selection. Can anyone recommend some great violin music? We have a<br/>
bit of Celtic fiddliing which he adores, but he also seems to really love<br/>
classical and i&#39;m at a bit of a loss. I&#39;d probably have to mailorder it so<br/>
it would be good to know what we&#39;re getting into. He seems to love pretty<br/>
harmonious music, not too intense (doesn&#39;t like tchaikovsky). For example he<br/>
really loved Vivaldi&#39;s music in the story/music tape &quot;Vivaldi&#39;s ring of<br/>
mystery&quot; from the Classical Kids series (great series!).<br/>
<br/>
I like Sandra&#39;s idea of the beads on an abacus as long as i put it somewhere<br/>
we can see it. He&#39;s been drawing pictures on a large sticker to keep track<br/>
of his practicing but the problem is it&#39;s inside his violin case. We need<br/>
something to help us *remember* to practice more than to record sessions<br/>
after the fact.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m never sure whether you&#39;re in town or on Saltspring. Do you have access <br/>
to the Victoria library system? They have tons of classical CDs. I pay the <br/>
non-resident fees each year in order to use that system. It&#39;s pretty high, <br/>
$150/year, but I figure I get my money&#39;s worth just from the multi-media <br/>
stuff. The Vancouver Island Regional system is starting to get more CDs, <br/>
but I guess Saltspring isn&#39;t part of that system.<br/>

from a friend who doesn&#39;t need 240 books a month for her family (that&#39;s how<br/>
many she could get with her cards!!). However, it&#39;s just a child&#39;s card--do<br/>
you know if i can get music or videos with a child&#39;s card?? I can&#39;t find any<br/>
info on the library site on the internet about it but i&#39;m compiling a list<br/>
of books and stuff to get when we go into town tommorrow and wondered if i<br/>
should bother perusing the music section.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you go to the downtown branch I think you&#39;ll find *something*. They have <br/>
lots there. They have signs over the various sections telling you how many <br/>
items you&#39;re allowed and how long you can keep them. I think it would say <br/>
there if you can take them on a child&#39;s card.<br/>
<br/>
I know you used to have to have an adult card for videos and CDROMs. I <br/>
think that&#39;s still the case. I don&#39;t think you need an adult card for CDs <br/>
or cassettes. You might want to call to find out in order to avoid a wasted <br/>
trip. (If you go into the main branch without a card, and you&#39;re anything <br/>
like me, you&#39;ll be wanting your own card. At least that&#39;s what happened to <br/>
me. My husband bought me a non-resident card for my birthday that year. It <br/>
was only $50 then. Sigh.<br/>

which weeks I did better than not and that was 1958.<br/>

I could give you all my grades from elementary school too.   <br/>
<br/>
I like having those.  They affirmed me better than my mom did.<br/>
