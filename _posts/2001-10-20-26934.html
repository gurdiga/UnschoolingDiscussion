&lt;&lt; Worst case scenario might be school accusing the family of educational <br/>
 neglect, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   This is exactly what I was thinking they might do. Personally I think the <br/>
school should be investigated for this treatment. I thought (according to <br/>
articles) that our district was the most progressive in Idaho. How utterly <br/>
false. They are progressive according to those stupid tests that give school <br/>
incentives.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We didn&#39;t fly, but I think passengers and flight crews are much more alert<br/>
 and are not going to let anyone get away with hi-jacking a plane. Have you<br/>
 read how several planes have had military escorts, immediate landings,<br/>
 confetti spilling out of a card and someone reporting it as suspect,<br/>
 troubled passenger getting restrained by other pax., etc. It seems like<br/>
 everyone is watching everything that used to go mostly un-noticed.<br/>

not a mother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017237755">&lt;&lt;with so much going on&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now I am taking just the opposite approach.  We are going about our lives as<br/>
normal.  I don&#39;t let the laws of the United States of America keep me from<br/>
doing what I want, I&#39;m sure not going to let fear do it.  My family took<br/>
some precautions &quot;just in case&quot; and just continued on with our activities<br/>
and plans.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 weeks of food for the 7 seven of us, one box in the pantry, one in<br/>
the car.  We take a weapon on my person anytime we go anywhere and have<br/>
updated the first aid kit.  We have blankets for everybody in the car and<br/>
have an emergency plan for where we would meet if it &quot;hit the fan&quot; and we<br/>
weren&#39;t all together.<br/>
<br/>
Do I think we will need this stuff?  no.  But it is my job to have<br/>
contingency plans because I&#39;m responsible for my kids.  There is absolutely<br/>
no way to what is going to happen when so I am not going to try.<br/>

What&#39;s in the boxes?<br/>
With what did you update the 1st aid kit?<br/>
Your preparedness and planning are commendable, Julie.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
