It is to examine, investigate, expand on, extend, look deep into, and figure <br/>
OUT the real world - by &quot;playing&quot; in a world which is under control of the <br/>
players - where archetypes can be uncovered and manipulated and all KINDS of <br/>

many very scientific-minded kids love role-playing games.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not escapism for my boys.  It&#39;s what they DO.  They would have to find <br/>
some very NON-gaming related activity for escapism.  <br/>
<br/>
What used to be &quot;Pokemon night&quot; at the store where Kirby works is now &quot;Anime <br/>
Games Day,&quot; and so he does &quot;professionally&quot; (are at least part time for real <br/>
pay) assist others in playing games based on Japanese animated stories.   <br/>
How&#39;s THAT for very specific!?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now this post made me think about role playing games in a more favorable <br/>
light. What you say makes perfect sense and I begin to understand why my <br/>
older son is so into them. I still don&#39;t want him spending all day playing in <br/>
a fantasy world, but perhaps I will be more patient with his fascination if I <br/>
can see it as his way of trying to make sense of the real world. <br/>
Unfortunately most of the role playing games are so violent, that I wonder <br/>
what that means to the kids in relation to the real world.<br/>
<br/>
I heard a really funny discussion between my boys and their friends a few <br/>
days ago. One of them said he had &quot;discovered some sort of ultimate mode <br/>
where the character really dies when you &quot;kill&quot; him.&quot; The other kid says <br/>
&quot;what do you mean?&quot; first kid says &quot;the character really dies&quot;, second kid <br/>
says &quot;but what happens to him?&#39; first kid says &quot;he&#39;s dead, don&#39;t you get it? <br/>
nothing happens to him----he&#39;s really dead, he doesn&#39;t come back.&quot; Second kid <br/>
says&quot;you&#39;re kidding, there must be some way to bring him back&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
The above discussion went on for several minutes, and I think the neighbor <br/>
kid still couldn&#39;t believe it. Talk about spending too much time in a fantasy <br/>
world.<br/>

No, I think you misunderstood the nature of his disbelief.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re stories, games, programs.  If you reset the game, it will start over. <br/>
 There is no more life and death involved than in a chess game.  The kid was <br/>
probably questioning the idea that when the game was restarted that character <br/>
would be unavailable.<br/>
<br/>
It was a question about computer programming and game design.<br/>

Imagine a chess game in which your rook could be physically vaporized in<br/>
a puff of smoke.  That would be trippy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend used to have a chess program that was animated.  The pieces would <br/>
actually move on screen and seemed to have personalities and stuff.  I <br/>
don&#39;t remember the name of it.  And I can&#39;t remember what happened to <br/>
captured pieces.  (After all, they don&#39;t die in chess, the just get <br/>
captured by the enemy.)<br/>

Especially if the next time you took that chess set out to play you were down <br/>
by a rook, and that was just that!</div>
