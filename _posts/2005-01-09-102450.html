<div id="ygrps-yiv-687356737">Tomorrow, Kirby starts college.  It&#39;s a small start, and it might be a  short <br/>
start, or he might go on to get a PhD and teach at some university.   <br/>
Gloriously for us all, I neither know (nor could anyone else who might claim  surety <br/>
about their kids&#39; plans) nor care.  Any way it turns out is  fine.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a community college here called TVI (Technical Vocational  <br/>
Institute).  It does lots of certificate programs and associates&#39; degrees  kinds of <br/>
things, but has arts and sciences, too, calibrated to transfer to the  University <br/>
of New Mexico (also in town) and other state schools.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby will be taking English 101<br/>
Math 99 (not college credit)<br/>
and CSE 100 (not for credit, and an interesting thing)<br/>
 <br/>
So the English will be writing.  I&#39;ll let you know how that  goes.  He first <br/>
tested two points too  low on one of the tests.   These details are boring and <br/>
I promise not to write anything else interesting  below this, so anyone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t care can bail now.<br/>
 <br/>
As he hadn&#39;t taken a GED and had no high school grades, but is 18, he took  <br/>
the Accuplacer tests, which are given in a little computer testing room.   He <br/>
had never taken &quot;real&quot; tests like this, nothing but the driver&#39;s ed  tests.<br/>
 <br/>
On November 16 he got these scores:<br/>
77 Reading Comprehension<br/>
41 Arithmetic <br/>
86 Sentence skills.<br/>
 <br/>
The test-report-generated note says &quot;Your Sentence Skills score is high  <br/>
enough for English 101 but you also need a Reading score of 80 or completion of  <br/>
Reading 101 or equivalent.  To place into English 101, you need a Reading  <br/>
score of 80 or above.  You hve the option of retaking the Reading  test.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I wanted him to be getting college credit in something, so I suggested he  <br/>
retake it.  He was willing, but in no hurry.<br/>
 <br/>
At the time he was wanting to transfer to New Mexico State in Las Cruces  <br/>
(near El Paso, five hours away), but he has since changed his mind, for which  <br/>
I&#39;m glad.<br/>
 <br/>
On December 13 he took the reading test again, with no preparation other  <br/>
than the experience of having taken the test before.  It didn&#39;t have the  same <br/>
items so it wasn&#39;t a straight repeat.  He scored 105.<br/>
 <br/>
So I don&#39;t know what the highest possible scores are on those tests, but  <br/>
he&#39;s in English 101, with  never a writing class, having learned what he  knows <br/>
from just reading and goofing, writing to friends on the internet, being  in a <br/>
talking, reading family.  <br/>
 <br/>
If they have to write by hand, he will have a steep learning curve.   If <br/>
everything is turned in from computer-entry, he should do okay.<br/>
 <br/>
Math is just some remedial math.  Not their lowest level,  either.<br/>
The catalog shows <br/>
Math 092, Math Anxiety<br/>
Math 094, Introduction to Calculators<br/>
Math 096 Special topics in developmental math<br/>
Math 097 Basic Mathematics<br/>
Math 099 Basic College Mathematics<br/>
 <br/>
Then there are three more, 100A, 100B, 100, all algebra, also  <br/>
pre-college-credit level.<br/>
 <br/>
So depending how he does in 99, he might be able to test into &quot;real&quot; for  <br/>
credit math, 121/algebra, next time if he&#39;s interested. Or he might just go on  <br/>
to the also-non-credit 100 level stuff.<br/>
 <br/>
The third class is called College Success Experience, and is about how to  <br/>
take notes and tests, how to study, how to schedule one&#39;s time to do well in  <br/>
school.  What I find fascinating is that it&#39;s 45 theory hours and 15 lab  hours.<br/>
 <br/>
Theory and lab.  Huh.<br/>
I certainly hope it involves his other two classes and that they haven&#39;t  <br/>
just made up some 60 hours of make-work, seat-work, busy-work, practice  stuff.  <br/>
It gives me the creeps to think about it.<br/>
 <br/>
But on the up side, he will be taking this class with others who DID go to  <br/>
school and didn&#39;t figure these things out on their own.  So he&#39;ll learn a  lot <br/>
about what he knows, and that&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>
 <br/>
We paid tuition for the English class, but the other two are  <br/>
gratis/tax-supported.   The books cost $180 for three classes.   Irritating, but so it goes.  <br/>
 <br/>
At this point his potential plan is to go to UNM someday and that&#39;s in  town, <br/>
so fine.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ll just see how it goes.  I&#39;ll ask him if he wants me to remind him  about <br/>
homework or not.  When I was his age I was a full time university  sophomore, <br/>
living away from home, my parents had divorced and I lived at school  in the <br/>
dorm, and visited one or the other parent on weekends in smaller houses I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t ever lived in.  It was a stress fest.  My experience won&#39;t be  like his at <br/>
all, so I&#39;m trying to see it as a completely different thing, not to  be <br/>
regarded or compared.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030444337">Thank you for posting all the boring details.<br/>
<br/>
May I ask how he came to the decision to go to college at all? Is he excited about it? <br/>
Nervous? What are his reasons for going?<br/>
<br/>
And what do you think of college after all these years of unschooling? What value do you <br/>
expect/hope it will add to Kirby&#39;s life?<br/>

different places during my college years. I stayed at school during breaks except for three <br/>
day visits to my mom&#39;s. I went to Thanksgiving at friends&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you sharing what Kirby is doing.<br/>
<br/>
Noah is working (he&#39;s 17) and is working hard in a Shakespeare cast. He&#39;s got this amazing <br/>
part and is being directed by professional actors with exposure to some of the highest <br/>
quality professors of theater in our conservatory of the arts here in Cinci. Yesterday as he <br/>
shared with me all he&#39;s learning, I just thought again what a difference it is to learn, rather <br/>
than to study.<br/>
<br/>
Your reports encourage me, so thanks for giving them.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for posting that!  My son and I were just looking at a <br/>
community college website and talking about the different options.  <br/>
He scrunched up his face when he read that he&#39;d have to take the <br/>
Accuplacer but I just read him your email and he has a different <br/>
perspective now, much more positive.   I wasnt sure if they would <br/>
let him re-take a test if he scored too low and we&#39;ve never really <br/>
talked to an unschooler that made this kind of move.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

about  it? <br/>
Nervous? What are his reasons for going?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Pressure from his boss (whom, I suspect, might&#39;ve been subtly trying to get  <br/>
rid of him &lt;g&gt;), partly.  More than that, friends (some of the girls  in the <br/>
group he went to the Los Alamos prom with) saying &quot;Oh you *have* to come  to <br/>
state and hang around with us.&quot;  And another former co-worker, Ryan,  who&#39;s 22 <br/>
or so and was going to state.  That was another lure.<br/>
 <br/>
But last fall Kirby went down there to stay with those girls  (sophomores) <br/>
for three days and go to classes with them.  He hung out  with Ryan some and <br/>
with the girls some.  He liked the biology class.   Didn&#39;t understand a word in <br/>
the chemistry class.  Went with them to their  &#39;office hours&#39; (where they tutor <br/>
freshmen who&#39;re having a hard time in math or  science).<br/>
 <br/>
When he got back he just didn&#39;t like them as much anymore. He was  coming to <br/>
think they were boring, maybe a little shallow.  He went  with them to their <br/>
martial arts class where there were belt tests for younger  kids.  Later he <br/>
critiqued the tests, saying he thought they were too  intimidating and not <br/>
encouraging for young kids, and that where he studies the  tests are done more <br/>
gently.  The girls didn&#39;t get it.<br/>
 <br/>
That was the week Halo II came out.  He told them it was the biggest  event <br/>
to date in video gaming.  They didn&#39;t get it; thought he was  silly. <br/>
 <br/>
Ryan moved back after this semester and will be entering the air force in  <br/>
six months or so.  So the allure of New Mexico State had faded.<br/>
 <br/>
Meanwhile, though, he had kind of liked the feeling and the feedback he was  <br/>
getting when he said he was thinking of going to college.  And we had  talked <br/>
him into taking a couple of classes here to see if he even liked it, and  to <br/>
be near so Keith and I could help him if he wanted help.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Is he excited about it? <br/>
Nervous? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Calm as with all things, it seems.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-And what do you think of college after all these years of unschooling?  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
When he went to driver&#39;s ed at 16 I felt like it was his first day of  <br/>
school.  Now tomorrow feels like his first day of school.  That&#39;s how  I feel about <br/>
him going.  The way I feel about it in general is that most  who are there are <br/>
going to shut some adult up, or to get some government benefit  or other, or <br/>
to continue to qualify for health insurance (which can qualify  under the <br/>
first two reasons too), and that dilutes the quality of the experience  for <br/>
everyone.  But I think that tradition goes back at least a thousand  years too.  <br/>
 <br/>
Eleventh century dad:  &quot;You need to stop just hanging around, and  start <br/>
going to work with your brother, or go to the Crusades or  something.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Eleventh century 18 year old:  &quot;But Daaa--ad, I really want to go to  the <br/>
University of Paris with my fri---ends&quot; (meaning I don&#39;t want to go into  <br/>
business or join the crusades).<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- What value do you expect/hope it will add to Kirby&#39;s life?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I expect that he will feel pretty good about himself when he sees that he&#39;s  <br/>
ahead in some ways of people who went to school for all the 12 or 13 years  <br/>
they thought they had to go or else the world wouldn&#39;t turn right or they would  <br/>
be illiterate criminals.  He probably kind of knows that, but here come  some <br/>
measuring moments.  I don&#39;t expect grades or scores to form  his self esteem <br/>
or personal image at this point.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope he will meet some people he likes (not that he needs more friends,  <br/>
but he might meet some who introduce him to new ideas outside of the gaming and  <br/>
fantasy field, which isn&#39;t a bad field, and I hope they don&#39;t introduce him <br/>
to  the drugs and alcohol fields, but if he wanted that he could be doing it  <br/>
already).<br/>
 <br/>
I hope he will discover anthropology. (Totally selfish on that one.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
I hope he will find many clarifying moments, whether about how people are,  <br/>
how life is, or the value of his own ideas in the face of prescribed &quot;right  <br/>
answers&quot; in writing style or literary commentary or mathematical thought.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll discover some academic field that really intrigues him.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll go into hotel and restaurant management.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll just learn enough to know what formal classroom learning is  like <br/>
and decide he doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know.<br/>

------------<br/>
WOW!<br/>
I wasn&#39;t thinking it was going to be very helpful to anyone so I&#39;m glad it  <br/>
might be.<br/>
 <br/>
I said his boss might be trying to get rid of him.  I think it&#39;s  jealousy.<br/>
 <br/>
The gaming shop is owned by a woman.  Her husband helps manage it, but  he&#39;s <br/>
irritating and Kirby doesn&#39;t like working with him much.   I  think maybe just <br/>
as power play and puff-uppery (puffery? &lt;g&gt;) the guy  started in on Kirby <br/>
lately saying &quot;You have to go to college.&quot;  And at  first he had Kirby kinda <br/>
spooked and nervous, but I called  his bluff and  said something like &quot;Tell Glen <br/>
if he wants to take you down there and get you  signed up to go ahead, but I&#39;d <br/>
rather wait until YOU want to go instead of going  by age, and Glen has no <br/>
idea what he&#39;s talking about.&quot;  (Because it made me  grouchy that Glen would <br/>
intimidate Kirby.)<br/>
 <br/>
But lately there was another of those stories.  Glen the boss&#39;s  husband went <br/>
to Gencon (big gaming convention.  Kirby went too!  Kirby  was there for <br/>
three solid days (opted out of day 4 to go to Disneyland with his  siblings and <br/>
two of Pam Sorooshian&#39;s kids).  Kirby never saw Glen  once.  Turns out Glen was <br/>
(he says) there for a while on Saturday. <br/>
 <br/>
Hmmm....   <br/>
Had Kirby not been there, I&#39;m sure Glen would be posturing and posing about  <br/>
who all he saw and how much he learned.   As it is, though, Kirby  learned <br/>
several new games, picked up some sample stuff and much news, and  so...  one <br/>
more thing to run Kirby off about. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Probably Glen&#39;s trip to California will be a business expense.  That&#39;s  okay. <br/>
 I just wish he would display some appreciation for Kirby.   Other people at <br/>
work like Kirby.  (Oh!  another thing to be jealous  about!)<br/>
 <br/>
Side story, but that&#39;s okay.   Kirby works and hangs around with  some people <br/>
who have college degrees, and some who never went, and some who went  for a <br/>
while and might or might not go back.  He already knows it&#39;s not what  makes a <br/>
person whole or good.<br/>

Cameron&#39;s met someone like this. Brian. Brian&#39;s 26. He and his mom live in  a <br/>
nearby hotel (cheaper than a house/apt. with TV, cable, phone, computer  <br/>
hook-up, mini-kitchen, and daily maid service! &lt;g&gt;). Mom works at the  <br/>
university---cleaning, I think. Brian plays the violin. He plays during the day  at <br/>
high-end grocery stores and at night at restaurants. <br/>
 <br/>
He and Cameron share a love of music and are each broadening the  other&#39;s <br/>
musical tastes (Brian is a little bit classical; Cameron&#39;s a little bit  rock & <br/>
roll! &lt;g&gt;). They&#39;re both fiddling (hah!) around with jazz, blue  grass, and <br/>
celtic sounds too. But that&#39;s just where it starts. Brian and  Cameron talk <br/>
philosophy a lot. Politics. Religion. They have very different  backgrounds---but <br/>
at the same time, they have a lot in common.  <br/>
 <br/>
Brian challenges Cameron a lot and makes him think. Not in a teacherly-way,  <br/>
but in a deep-thinking-look-at-all-sides-what-do-you-think kind of way. It&#39;s  <br/>
been so good for Cameron.<br/>
 <br/>
Brian&#39;s very up-beat, charming, smart----with a killer smile. You can tell  <br/>
he loves life and makes the most of each day. I&#39;m tickled he and Cameron found  <br/>
each other.<br/>
 <br/>
Meeting people with differing views and different  backgrounds---college was <br/>
a good place for that---for me, anyway. Especially my  year in Vienna, <br/>
Austria. Learning more about myself and seeing how things work  in another part of <br/>
the world, meeting *very* different people and finding out  that we have a lot <br/>
more in common than I thought---that was big. And seeing that  some <br/>
countries/people do things *better* than we do----wow! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Cam&#39;s finding people like this at 16 because he&#39;s out in the world NOW.  He&#39;s <br/>
visiting his 22 year old cousin who&#39;s in college this weekend;  she&#39;s at the <br/>
College of Charleston. He&#39;ll get to meet a few of her college  friends---hang <br/>
out and do &quot;college-y&quot; things.<br/>
 <br/>
I love when he goes away like this: he comes home markedly more aware and  <br/>
mature and at ease. Not to mention excited about what he&#39;s  learned/experienced.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope Kirby has some really good experiences and meets some interesting  <br/>
people!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424773592">We were watching the DVD *Weather <br/>
Underground* last night. It was mentioned that Mark Rudd (Columbia <br/>
Univ sit-in 1967(?)and founding member of the Weathermen) teaches <br/>
math there.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&quot; -- sorry it just came to me, a memory of the past.<br/>
