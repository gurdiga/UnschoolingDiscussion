HAPPY<br/>
&gt; news!):<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi! I cut and pasted the letter I sent out to everyone on my<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oct.12,1999. You may eventually get it forwarded to you from<br/>
whoever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sent you the original email about Kelsey missing, but you<br/>
are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recent emails I have received and I&#39;d like to speed up the<br/>
process of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving you the update. Thank you all so much for caring!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hello Everyone!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am taking this time to say first THANK YOU ALL SO<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MUCH!!! For your concern, all your prayers, and forwarding<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; message<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about Kelsey onto everyone. I have received unbelievable<br/>
amounts of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; email from people all over. There are truly many wonderful<br/>
and caring<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people out there! Let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tell you the wonderful news, today the police brought me my<br/>
baby<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In truth, God brought her back safely to me. I believe in<br/>
the power<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prayer and I appreciate the hundreds of prayers that all of<br/>
you said<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kelsey. She was taken from the public<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; library yesterday while her preschool class was visiting it.<br/>
She is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unharmed and as happy to be home as we are to have her. The<br/>
man who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; took<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her was a stranger and I feel extremely fortunate to have<br/>
her back as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all know the outcome of many of these situations, for those<br/>
of you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are parents I&#39;m sure you can imagine all the different<br/>
thoughts that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ran<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; through my head during her absence. I know it had to be the<br/>
worst<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; night<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have ever experienced in my life. I pray for all those<br/>
parents out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there that are still missing their children and I ask you to<br/>
do the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; same. The man that took her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was mentally handicapped and living on his own. He<br/>
apparently meant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no harm and did not understand the seriousness of his<br/>
actions, he is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; currently being held and evaluated. It is a tough situation<br/>
to deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with. I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to answer as many individual emails as I could,<br/>
especially from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; those of you who are friends or acquaintances of mine. I<br/>
apologize if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; miss anyone. The vast amount of mail makes it nearly<br/>
impossible. I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; attaching a site and form that one wonderful stranger passed<br/>
onto me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is for missing children. I hope you will pass it onto anyone<br/>
you know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a missing child and even just save the page somewhere<br/>
for future<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; use. I hope no one needs it, but it is a wonderful site for<br/>
those who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do. So please pass this GREAT news and MY MANY<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MANY THANKS onto everyone you forwarded my message to. Thank<br/>
you all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much once again! God Bless!! ;))))<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Amy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
