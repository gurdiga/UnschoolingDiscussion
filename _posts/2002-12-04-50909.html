<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746557366">***I dont have Ray, but the other two fellas I have plenty of.. I just<br/>
started <br/>
Dean Koontz&#39; Doorway to Heaven ( or something like that)..  I recently<br/>
read <br/>
The Green Mile.. I had seen the movie, but hadnt read the book.. Of<br/>
course <br/>
the book was better, but the movie was pretty true to it.  I also like<br/>
James <br/>
Patterson.. I want to get Four Blind Mice ASAP.. maybe Santa will help me<br/>
out ***<br/>
<br/>
I love the way Dean Koontz writes.  I love this from One Door Away From<br/>
Heaven ...&quot;In the armchair, Noah Farrel talked past the point where he<br/>
bothered to listen to himself anymore, and he kept talking until he was<br/>
wrung dry of words.&quot;   <br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
I just finished From the Corner of His Eye and it&#39;s wonderful,<br/>
metaphysical parallel universe stuff, with a most delicious slimy<br/>
villain.   <br/>
I haven&#39;t read James Patterson but my brother just gave me 2nd Chance. <br/>
I&#39;ll send it to you when I&#39;m finished if you haven&#39;t read it yet. <br/>

Yeah. THATS the one I am reading right now.. Ive only got a few chapters <br/>
read, but I do like it so far.  I have read &quot;From the Corner of His Eye&quot;  ( <br/>
so did my oldest son, he loved it too).. Have you read any of the really <br/>
gruesome, graphic stuff by Koontz?   I once read a collection by him that <br/>
contained a story called &quot;Whispers&quot;   that one was especially &quot;chilling&quot;  OK <br/>
I guess we are getting OT with our book reviews.. but  I do enjoy trading <br/>
thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375129165">I found this..<br/>
<br/>
I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for a long time now. My friend, Tim, got me <br/>
started on him seven years ago. I have just finished reading Seize The Night <br/>
and I decided to find the infamous &quot;Book of Counted Sorrows&quot; that Koontz <br/>
often quotes. I then found that there is no such book,...yet. The poems are <br/>
ones that he has written for his novels and he is supposed to be compiling <br/>
them into a collection that is to be published soon. Here is a link to a site <br/>
that has the poems on it. <br/>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.veinotte.com/koontz/sorrows.htm&quot;">http://www.veinotte.com/koontz/sorrows.htm&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.veinotte.com/koontz/sorrows.htm&lt;/A">http://www.veinotte.com/koontz/sorrows.htm&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It does seem that for now, the poems are only published online, not in a <br/>
&quot;real&quot; book..Interesting.. he should publish the &quot;book&quot;  I think it would be <br/>
a big hit<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I like the creepy ones.  I really liked Phantoms, the first chapter<br/>
is called &quot;THE VICTIMS&quot; and it opens to find an entire town dead.   Love<br/>
it!<br/>
I liked Midnight,  liked Whispers, a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you read his funny stuff?   Dylan has The Paper Doorway, Funny Verse<br/>
and Nothing Worse.  It&#39;s very cute.  I haven&#39;t read the other stuff,<br/>
Santa&#39;s Twin.  I don&#39;t remember what else.  I guess I&#39;ll go look around<br/>
at amazon!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470194317">&quot;Elsewhere, night falls, but in Moonlight Bay it steals upon us with<br/>
barely a whisper, like a gentle dark-sapphire surf licking a beach.  At<br/>
dawn, when the night retreats across the Pacific toward distant Asia, it<br/>
is reluctant to go, leaving deep, black pools in alleyways, under parked<br/>
cars, in culverts and beneath the leafy canopies of ancient oaks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always liked this first paragraph from Seize The Night. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679013646">That&#39;s because there IS no such book! Those are all different things that <br/>
Dean Koontz wrote himself. I would love for him to compile them together and <br/>
publish it.<br/>
