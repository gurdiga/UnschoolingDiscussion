<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573322998">My 6yr ds made up a new game with some cards yesterday were there are no winners or losers and would like to share it with others so here it is<br/>
<br/>
Craig&#39;s Card Game<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8th March 2005<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can play this game with any set of cards that has animal or human characters. The cards are placed in the centre of a group of players. A decision is made as to who goes 1st based on anything such as height, aged, hair length, noise ability etc. The 1st player picks up the top card saying &quot;tick tack top&quot; , then tells a joke based on the character on the card. We used Winny the Pooh cards so that if you picked up Winny the Pooh you could tell a joke based on the character on about bears. If the player forgets to say tick tac top or says it wrong then the player has to make the noise the character makes or how it may sound when eating and misses telling the joke.<br/>
<br/>
Craig says this is a game for any age and it is just for fun with no winners or losers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope you al enjoy it as much as we have<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Love from Jay & Martin parents to Axel and Craig <br/>

We all know how children feel because we feel the same way.  However when  we do not respect children&#39;s feelings it is because ours  were not respected when we were children.<br/>
