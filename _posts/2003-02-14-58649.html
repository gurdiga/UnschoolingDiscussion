Some folks from the Montana unschoolers list have expressed  enthusiastic<br/>
interest in your potential  unschooling conference in Fargo.   I thought<br/>
I&#39;d pass that along in the event you are collecting such information.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930816735">Alright Deb,  thanks!        It is in the very, very early stages.   I really do think there would be enough interest.   And I do want to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  As of right now I still feel like I&#39;m so new to the unschooling community,  but yet I truly have no doubts that it is the ideal life style for my family.           I see wonderful changes occuring in our family as their school day memories diminish.      <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
By the way I love your posts,     do you know what one really stands out in my mind as good?    The one where you had drank some wine!&lt;g&gt;  It was great! <br/>
<br/>
Kelli <br/>

Hey!   I was in Minnesota once when I was twelve or thirteen.   My Aunt<br/>
lived there and I remember walking to her out house and picking a dozen<br/>
wood ticks off my socks and walking back to the house and picking a dozen<br/>
more...<br/>
<br/>
But it was beautiful and warm and green and I woudn&#39;t mind seeing it<br/>
again. (uh, Minnesota, not the outhouse)  I&#39;m not such a wimp about wood<br/>
ticks now.   <br/>
<br/>
I think I still have long lost cousins there named Delameter.  I don&#39;t<br/>

Hey that&#39;s not very far from me.   You should visit!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only found that many ticks in May,  seriously!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I do love Minnesota,  but I am struggling right now with the cold weather.   I would be fine if I could get in a winter vacation (somewhere warm); unfortunately there&#39;s this thing called money that I have to worry about. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to stay positive about the winter activities that we have around here, but its hard when its below zero.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have the Eelpout festival going on right now in Walker.  Some people really get into that!<br/>

They aren&#39;t that bad!  Meaning they aren&#39;t everywhere and they aren&#39;t out all the time,  especially when its -20! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You can look at them under microscopes and its really cool,  that&#39;s how I knew that there was a deer tick on my son.<br/>

there are some in early spring and then we don&#39;t see any all year.  <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s too cold.   Winter is wonderful if you can get out and enjoy<br/>
it but when you&#39;re locked up using all your energy to stay warm it gets<br/>
old.   It&#39;s been mild enough here the past few winters that we get out<br/>
almost every day, for a walk at least but for sledding or skating or<br/>
snowshoeing sometimes too, without freezing our toes off.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have the Eelpout festival going on right now in Walker.  Some <br/>
&gt; people really get into that!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
They have different fishing events here usually but the lake normally<br/>
used didn&#39;t bother to freeze hard enough this year.   <br/>

Yep!   An eelpout is a big, ugly, fish, kind-of a cross between a bull head and a cat fish!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Funny thing that happened last summer concerning an eelpout,  my dd was scootering outside, my dh was standing back in the yard and happened to look up.   There above my dd was an eagle passing by with an eelpout in its mouth, a second later another eagle swings by the first eagle and tries to steal the eelpout,    it falls, just a few feet beside my daughter,  SPLAT!!   Man, was it big!      My dh comes running in,  Abbi almost got hit by an eelpout!        We all laughed for days!<br/>
