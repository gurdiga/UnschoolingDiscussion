<div id="ygrps-yiv-355347681">Our favorite search engine has a new service in beta. Not only does Google<br/>
let you search web sites, it is now letting you search print catalogs. This<br/>
is cool because they&#39;ve included our new catalog that was only printed a few<br/>
weeks ago!<br/>
<br/>
You can jump to pages, zoom in, or do searches. Just go to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://catalog.google.com/catalogs?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&issue=14696&c">http://catalog.google.com/catalogs?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&issue=14696&c</a><br/>
atpage=cover&catview=thumb<br/>
<br/>
The URL is long so you may need to cut and paste if your mail reader wraps<br/>
it to two lines. As an alternative, you can also go to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/catalog.htm">http://www.fun-books.com/catalog.htm</a> and click on the picture of the catalog<br/>
cover.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, just had to share!<br/>
