&lt;&lt;&lt;I know of zero unschoolers who totally failed to learn to  read by the <br/>
time they were grown, and none who hate the sight, touch and  smell of <br/>
books.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m having some first-hand experience with that myself, that &quot;imposed  <br/>
rejection&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
Wyl wanted to try an online school this year. It *sounded* cool. I tried to  <br/>
find ways to replace what was so cool about it, but only the online school <br/>
would  do. Our computer hadn&#39;t arrived by the time we left for the Live and Learn <br/>
 conference, and on the way home, I commented to Dave that now we were going <br/>
from  wonderful freedom to having to go by someone else&#39;s curriculum. Wyl <br/>
overheard  and said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do it, now.&quot; Well, the computer had already <br/>
arrived  and so after we got the packages from the neighbor, we set it up <br/>
today and  started on a workbook (easy, one page) &quot;story&quot; that they wanted him to  <br/>
write-about travel in his home city or state. The instructions stated &quot;with a <br/>
 partner&quot;, so I offered to write for him. He knows how and does write, but <br/>
not  long things and still finds the process of making letters and words with a  <br/>
pencil or pen tedious, so I figured he&#39;d prefer help. He did. He wanted to <br/>
write  about Kalahari (a waterpark in Ohio where there was an unschooler <br/>
gathering this  past January), and so I poised my pen and waited. As I waited, I <br/>
realized typing  would be faster, so I pulled up a blank page and waited. He <br/>
started out with  something he saw, and as I suggested he might think about telling <br/>
the story to  Scott (whom he just spent a good deal of time with at Live and <br/>
Learn), who  hadn&#39;t been there before, and pretend he was telling the story to <br/>
Scott. He  tried to start a couple times but shortly melted down in teary <br/>
whines of  distress: &quot;It&#39;s to HARD!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Now for those of you who know Wyl, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be astounded at this  <br/>
comment from one of the most prolific, descriptive, verbose story-tellers I  know! <br/>
I sure was. But I knew. I knew it was the pressure to perform that was  <br/>
making it tough. It didn&#39;t flow. It wasn&#39;t natural. It didn&#39;t happen in real  life.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m learning that it&#39;s a darn good thing we didn&#39;t get into online school  <br/>
before we found unschooling, because it would be too easy for the  <br/>
follow-the-instructions, start-to-finish parts of my brain to get sucked into  this whole <br/>
shebang and become the demon mother-teacher from hell. I&#39;ve had to  re-center <br/>
myself several times already today. I&#39;m hoping that Wyl will get  whatever <br/>
curiosity he had about this thing satisfied soon and we can quit the  repetitious <br/>
busy-work and get back to real learning. He&#39;s already made several  comments <br/>
about the questions posed to him (&quot;What do they think, we&#39;re  stupid?!?&quot;) that <br/>
tell me how monotonously drilling this &quot;education&quot; is, and I&#39;m  even more <br/>
ready to be done with it than when we first started the process of  signing up for <br/>
it. Bleah. Hopefully, it will be over before any real damage is  done. <br/>
Because if my super self-confident story-teller can be sidetracked by one  *day* of <br/>
schooling, I can only imagine what weeks, months, years can do to make  a <br/>
person hate the things that are being forced upon them in the most unnatural  ways.<br/>
 <br/>
Off to research who to notify when we&#39;re unschooling again,<br/>

<br/>
Just put the entire pile out on the table and forget about treating it like <br/>
a sequence. Treat it like a bunch of games with no particular order. Let him <br/>
pick and choose what looks interesting, and use the material however he <br/>
wants. Ignore their instructions.<br/>
<br/>
Or alternatively, put the whole curriculum on ebay and use the money to buy <br/>
some computer games or online gaming subscriptions.<br/>

That evil demon mother-teacher from hell rearing its ugly head? Curiosity  <br/>
about what it was all about? I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;ve caught myself twice already  <br/>
again today. I think the whole shebang is a nasty catalyst. Maybe I&#39;m just  <br/>
anthropomorphising...<br/>
 <br/>
He *is* interested in dabbling, but there are &quot;requirements&quot;. I&#39;m still  <br/>
fishing around trying to determine exactly what they are, but I know there are  <br/>
tests and quizzes that have to be turned in. (or he gets expelled-big threat,  <br/>
right?) I&#39;m still trying to find the balance between feeding that interest and  <br/>
making the requirements to keep the stuff while he explores it. Once I have a <br/>
 better idea of what the requirement-assignments are, I think it will be <br/>
easier  to find that balance.... Plus some unschooling holy water to keep that <br/>
demon  teacher-mother at bay...<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
