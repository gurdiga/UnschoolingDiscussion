&gt;   About RULES: I wish we could find a word for our practice that did not<br/>
&gt;   involve the word school. Since it is such a big part of the word <br/>
&gt;UNschool,<br/>
&gt;   we seem to bump up against our vision of school constantly, and struggle <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;   seem like we&#39;re free of it even when we&#39;re not. In our attempts even to <br/>
&gt;find<br/>
&gt;   a definition for Unschooling or homeschooling, we find ourselves like <br/>
&gt;moths<br/>
&gt;   flying in flame of schooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I suggest we could work on this, on the back burner, so to speak, with <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   idea of coming up with a concept of living with our children as integral<br/>
&gt;   parts of our daily lives as much as possible. What they need is <br/>
&gt;parenting,<br/>
&gt;   not school teaching, so, unless they ask us for information that might <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;   called school-type stuff, we are simply (!?) parenting. In fact, until <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;   kids are six or so, they are not *school-age* no matter what the soccer <br/>
&gt;mom/<br/>
&gt;   daycare/buildabetter baby crowd says, and there are fine people who tell <br/>
&gt;us<br/>
&gt;   that the ONLY thing small children need is self-regulated play, both <br/>
&gt;alone<br/>
&gt;   or in groups. The radical fringe (with plenty of documented proof, say<br/>
&gt;   that&#39;s all humans EVER need...play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;ll post more on this, but I believe that much of our wrangling on this<br/>
&gt;   list is due to the fact that we unschoolers are the radical <br/>
&gt;(fundamental,<br/>
&gt;   root) fringe of a large and growing fringe group. We are the <br/>
&gt;strong-headed<br/>
&gt;   independent people among semi-independent, usually self-assured, types <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;   homeschoolers. As such, we are sure of ourselves and willing to show our<br/>
&gt;   convictions. It can be jarring for the newbies, but if they&#39;re gonna be<br/>
&gt;   unschoolers, they can probably adapt.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Our similarities are much greater and more important than our <br/>
&gt;differences.<br/>
&gt;   What matters is that the children are not in those cages of artificial <br/>
&gt;life<br/>
&gt;   and synthetic experience called schools.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   This group is truly leading the way out of the education dark ages. <br/>
&gt;People<br/>
&gt;   are much more intelligent than school gives them the opportunity to <br/>
&gt;express.<br/>
&gt;   Here, I believe we are expressing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Bring it on.<br/>
