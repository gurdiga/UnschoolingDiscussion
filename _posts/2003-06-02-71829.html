<div id="ygrps-yiv-195746512">Hello I know this is a little weird me asking if anyone on the list has a &#39;schooly&#39; book to sell but, here goes...<br/>
<br/>
I would like to find a copy of Spelling Power for myself.  I have atrocious spelling and would like to use this book to improve it.  The only problem is I don&#39;t have the funds to spend 75 Can. plus shipping.  So If you know of anyone who would be willing to sell me the book for much less I would love it.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch<br/>

Talk about bad timing.  I just gave that book to our local group to sell at<br/>
a fund-raising a couple of months ago.  It really didn&#39;t work for Lars when<br/>
he wanted to improve his spelling.  But it might be just the ticket for<br/>
someone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885696460">I did the same thing sending somebody to the new girl scout program for <br/>
older girls --- they are phasing out Cadettes and Seniors -- girls from <br/>
11 to 17 won&#39;t even be called Girl Scouts anymore - they will be <br/>
&quot;members of Studio2b&quot; -- see www.studio2b.org (and not studio2b.com <br/>
&lt;G&gt;). for details. No more badges - they&#39;ll set their own goals in <br/>
their chosen focus areas and when they meet their own goals they can <br/>
get a &quot;charm&quot; as a memento.<br/>
