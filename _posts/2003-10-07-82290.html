<div id="ygrps-yiv-345088570">I took a group of kids to the Kansas City Renaissance Fare this past Saturday <br/>
and Moly went with us too. She fell in love with some women playing recorders <br/>
and these things called an Ocarina, (she recognized that a character in one <br/>
of the Zelda games plays one) so I bought her an Ocarina and wanted to get her <br/>
a Recorder too, but couldn&#39;t find one. So today I got her one of those <br/>
standard plastic ones that schools use. The Ocarinas come in four different sizes, <br/>
soprano, alto, tenor, and baritone. I got her a soprano one and if she gets good <br/>
and wants more I will order others for her. I was wondering if there is <br/>
somewhere I could get her a better recorder if she decides she wants one. Are they <br/>
all plastic or are some wood? Do they come in different sizes? I hope someone <br/>
knows. Sandra? She also liked the dulcimer (?) music. I&#39;m thinking, getting <br/>
hints, that maybe she might want one of those too. Are the recorder and dulcimer <br/>
instruments that she can teach herself or would she need to find a teacher? <br/>
The Ocarinas are very cool! Made from clay, but apparently archeologists have <br/>
found them made from animal horns and gourds. They look like little globs, and <br/>
come from the instrument family called vessel flutes. I learned that from one <br/>
of the people playing them. Jack is having fun with it and so am I! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try any store that sells musical instruments.  Recorders come in sopranino <br/>
(like a piccolo), soprano, alto, tenor and bass.  They come in wood and <br/>
plastic.  I *think* that some of the better plastic ones might be better <br/>
than the cheapest wood ones, but I&#39;m not sure about that.<br/>

dulcimer.  I&#39;ve also seen something in better toy stores that&#39;s a trapezoid <br/>
shape.  You pluck the strings with a pick.  They come with papers you can <br/>
slide between the strings and the body of the instrument that show you what <br/>
string to pluck when to play tunes.  I haven&#39;t tried one, but I know <br/>
parents who think they&#39;re wonderful.<br/>

available who can answer questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362909123">My Abbie got an Irish flute for ??? something. Shakespeare Festival <br/>
souvenir??? anyway...I used to play the Irish flute (tin whistle, <br/>
penny whistle) and tootled a tune I figured out, to show her how to <br/>
hold her fingers.<br/>
<br/>
She pretty much disappeared with it. A couple of months later, an <br/>
accomplished violinist was at church, and we were planning an anthem, <br/>
and Abbie brought her Irish flute. The violinist laid down some sheet <br/>
music, and...Abbie started playing it! Like, reading the music, and <br/>
playing the notes! *jawdrop* <br/>
<br/>
so, yes, it&#39;s self-teachable.<br/>

Recorder is harder than tin whistle, because of all the cross-fingerings and <br/>
because the sound is easier to mess up.  <br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s having recorder problems it would help to find another recorder <br/>
player and have one session of assistance on how to hold the recorder when you <br/>
have all open holes on the right (lower) hand, and how to hold it in her mouth <br/>
and how hard to blow.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it helps to have someone for her to watch, and then someone to <br/>
watch her to just help her adjust the angle at which she&#39;s holding it and advise <br/>
her on little problems.   <br/>
<br/>
When doing the lowest notes, it helps a lot to have someone (not necessarily <br/>
another recorder player) just look to see which hole isn&#39;t completely covered <br/>
if you&#39;re not getting the low note you&#39;re trying for.<br/>
<br/>
Dulcimer doesn&#39;t have those problems.<br/>
<br/>
There are also videos out and you might even be able to rent them.<br/>
