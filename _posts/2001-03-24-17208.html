<div id="ygrps-yiv-485311044">Hi there!  I just joined this list and I am sitting here crying of <br/>
joy... I pulled my 12 yr old ds out of ps about a month ago.  I have <br/>
been doing the usual struggling with curriculum and strategy and the <br/>
sort, you all know what I am going through.  Well anyway, everytime I <br/>
go to &quot;research&quot; teaching styles or &quot;learning&quot; styles I keep coming <br/>
back to unschooling.  So I finally joined this list to see what it is <br/>
all about.  I have finally found something that feels &quot;RIGHT!&quot;  I <br/>
just want to thank you all for giving such wonderful insightful <br/>
advice!  What a relief to find something that feels good.  I now know <br/>
that the right thing to do is let kids be kids and the rest will <br/>
pretty much take care of itself. (although I will probably throw a <br/>
bit of structured math in there just to be safe)<br/>
Thank you again!  I think I will stick around awhile to keep in this <br/>
frame of mind.<br/>

The sooner you give up that false safety, the happier you and your daughter <br/>
will be.<br/>

This list is only the sometimes-submerged tip of the iceberg that is <br/>
www.unschooling.com so if you really want some inspiration and math ideas, go <br/>
there!!<br/>

heart.  We&#39;re really glad you kept searching.  We&#39;re a friendly list, and<br/>
love to talk about unschooling, but we do best if you start us off with<br/>
questions. So, please yell if there&#39;s something you want to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
I heard on the TV this morning some of you all are still having winter!<br/>
Anyone want to share our blooming fruit trees and tulips?<br/>

What happened to Spring???  Although there are plenty of croci <br/>

sunshine would be nice!!!<br/>
