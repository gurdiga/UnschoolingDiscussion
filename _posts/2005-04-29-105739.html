<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090353149">I have a lot to say about Albuquerque today and it could affect everyone  <br/>
here, but first this: <br/>
 <br/>
-=-Tami, a recovering vegetarian, who just might be considered crazy for  <br/>
making<br/>
a trans pacific, space available military flight with 3 children under  the<br/>
age of 5, but will do it anyway just to spend time in NM and eat yet  another<br/>
Blake’s Lotaburger!  So there!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron Lovejoy, Kelly & Ben&#39;s older son, was here in February.<br/>
Cameron doesn&#39;t really eat meat, and especially doesn&#39;t eat beef.<br/>
Cameron ate a Lotaburger at the old Blake&#39;s on the north side of Santa  Fe.<br/>
I bet he won&#39;t hesitate to eat another one when he&#39;s here next time.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure when&#39;s the next time Cameron will be here, but I think he WILL  <br/>
be back, and it might be for a Live and Learn conference in Old Town, because  <br/>
I&#39;ve put in to be in line for some upcoming year. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m looking at using the Sheraton Old Town.  In fact, if I can&#39;t get  that <br/>
hotel, I don&#39;t want to do the conference.  There are half a dozen  reasons for <br/>
this.  <br/>
1. CLOSE walk to Old Town itself, lots of 200 year old buildings from  <br/>
territorial/cowboy days.<br/>
2. Close walk to Albuquerque Museum:  art, history, chain mail and  armor <br/>
including full plate Horse armor from Conquistadores, and lots of  16th/17th <br/>
century weapons and helmets.  <br/>
3. Close walk to National Atomic Museum (which used to be on Kirtland  <br/>
Airforce Base but was moved to Old Town near other museums, such as...<br/>
4. State Museum of Natural History:  Mostly dinosaurs and other  evolutionary <br/>
stuff.  Not a good museum for creationists, which is fine with  me.  <br/>
Planetarium, observatory, Imax theatre, GREAT snack bar, other stuff,  next door to...<br/>
5. Explora Hands on Science Museum (before it came to this permanent  <br/>
building and was in a series of four temporary sites it was known as Explora  <br/>
Children&#39;s Museum), THE best museum.<br/>
6. Tiguex Park, a city park with lots of grass (big deal in New Mexico) and  <br/>
play equipment--mainly a big round obstacle course sort of thing on a padded  <br/>
surface, and outdoor chessboard tables.<br/>
 <br/>
WAIT!  I got to six and hadn&#39;t gotten to the last-but-not-least <br/>
BLAKE&#39;S LOTABURGER right across the street from the hotel.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a Little Anita&#39;s to the south near Old Town (mid-priced New Mexican  <br/>
restaurant).<br/>
 <br/>
Catholics could go mass at San Felipe church, a beautiful old mission-style  <br/>
adobe church on the plaza in Old Town.  (Well others could too, I  suppose.)<br/>
 <br/>
So if the conference can be where families can walk to great museums and a  <br/>
play area, and go and buy souvenirs in Old Town without ever needing to rent a  <br/>
car at all, THAT is a place worth having a conference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OOOHH! OOOHHH! Yes! I would be *so* happy to have a chance to go back to <br/>
Albuquerque, where we lived for two years. And the thought of having the <br/>
conference there at approx. the same time as the annual chili roasting <br/>
season sends my mouth to watering. We could not only see old friends and <br/>
enjoy wonderful places we miss, but we could bring a garbage bag full of <br/>
roasted green chilis home with us for the freezer!<br/>
<br/>
And, fwiw, there&#39;s nothing quite like a Blake&#39;s green chili <br/>
cheeseburger, and the onion rings are to die for, if I recall.<br/>
<br/>
Then for all you Margharita lovers, Gardunos is always a fun place to <br/>
hang for drinks, though it&#39;s more commercial than some of the really <br/>
good New Mexican food places.<br/>
<br/>
Oooh, and everyone has to try the sopapillas!<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell I&#39;m a little excited?<br/>

 A little bit farther but still pretty easy walking distance to the <br/>
Aquarium and Botanical Gardens, which will soon have a completed <br/>
railroad connecting it to the Zoo and Tingley &quot;beach&quot;, an area with <br/>
ponds for fishing and other recreation.<br/>
<br/>
A close drive or easy bike to the Rio Grande Nature Center which has <br/>
beautiful walking trails along the Rio Grande.<br/>
<br/>
5 minutes by car from Downtown, which has been &quot;revitalized&quot; over the <br/>
last 10 years and now has swanky clubs, coffee shops, a movie theater, <br/>
fancy restaurants, and (from what I hear) pretty decent shopping.<br/>
<br/>
You can also drive 30 to 60 miles in any direction from Albuquerque and <br/>
be in 4 totally different climates/vegetation zones--almost like <br/>
visiting a completely different state.<br/>

To the list of interesting activities, by then the Tingley Beach project will be finished, combining the bio-park, zoo and fishing ponds/park area.<br/>

It&#39;s my favorite, though, hands down.<br/>
 <br/>
Albuquerque has a law about liquor sales too close to a church, so I think  <br/>
the fancy restaurant on the plaza (that&#39;s in an old hotel) might not be able to <br/>
 serve drinks because of San Felipe church.  There should be margaritas in  <br/>
the hotel, though, and over at the lounge on the north side of Old Town, the  <br/>
name of which is escaping me.  <br/>
 <br/>
Old Town is just about 4 blocks by four, and SMALL, little old oxcart  roads. <br/>
 And it is TRULY near the hotel.  The hotel in Sacramento where  they have <br/>
the HSC conference is itself a footpad of about the size of this  entire area <br/>
I&#39;ve described where the four museums, park and old town are.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-And, fwiw, there&#39;s nothing quite like a Blake&#39;s green chili  <br/>
cheeseburger, and the onion rings are to die for, if I recall.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Seasoned fries.  BBQ sandwich.  Yes, it&#39;s the smallest menu and  the finest <br/>
quality food EVER.  Some of the Blakes&#39; are serving breakfast  now.  Breakfast <br/>
burritos.  That&#39;s the menu. &lt;G&gt;  I don&#39;t if  this one does or will by <br/>
whichever year we&#39;re fantasizing about.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly and a friend and I were in Old Town Tuesday, and I looked around for  <br/>
another hotel in case of overflow.  (My #1 fear is we can&#39;t get this hotel,  <br/>
and #2 is that it&#39;s not big enough.)  There&#39;s a Best Western two blocks  north, <br/>
right next to I-40.<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t mention the hotel&#39;s like three blocks from I-40, and the airport  is <br/>
fifteen minutes by freeway, no tricky driving.  And our family owns two  vans <br/>
and has two accident-free teen drivers , and the hotel might have a  shuttle. <br/>
 People might not need to rent a car, or at least not until after  the <br/>
conference if they want to stick around and do more touristing.  And  for those who <br/>
can fly Southwest, that&#39;s usually pretty inexpensive.<br/>

thinking about--directly to the East of the church?  I had a margarita <br/>
there the first week I lived in Albuquerque and I&#39;ve had several since!<br/>
<br/>
The best margaritas in town are at Sadie&#39;s, though.  That&#39;s about 15 <br/>
minutes away from Old Town.<br/>

to hear a local songwriter/singer (Susan Clark) perform.  I mentioned to my  <br/>
brother that it would be a perfect place for the unschooling conference that we <br/>
 go to every year.  Just couldn&#39;t get much better than that location.<br/>
 <br/>
Then, this past week, my husband got a job offer in Albuquerque.  We  both <br/>
grew up in New Mexico (met in Texas though) and haven&#39;t lived there in 25  <br/>
years.  How weird that we might end up back somewhere we both consider  home and <br/>
how cool that we would know some other unschoolers!   Top  that off with a <br/>
future Live and Learn conference  and I&#39;d be packing my  bags for that long trek <br/>
from Florida.<br/>

<br/>
WAY too far from topic now.<br/>
And if you&#39;re vegetarian you don&#39;t really have a need to know.<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re all the same.  Crap for vegetarians and exceptionally  good <br/>
hamburgers for hamburger eaters.  (Good fries too.)  It&#39;s a  New Mexico chain from the <br/>
late 50&#39;s I think.  The one in Espanola is still  one of the original walk-up <br/>
buildings.  In Albuquerque, neighborhoods can  be dated by the architecture of <br/>
the Blakes&#39;.   Several are other  things now, but those who know the original <br/>
building (the walk-ups, like that  one in Santa Fe) see where they were and <br/>
know within a few years when that spot  was last a vacant lot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476108384">Hemm, Hemmm, (Raising hand tentatively)<br/>
I know its probably pretty hard to hear me from all the way over here in<br/>
Japan, but I have to add my .02 on the Albuquerque thing<br/>
<br/>
--Have you tried Gezambonis?  Its on the corner of Rio Grande and (I<br/>
think) Griegos?  It sorta looks like its gonna fall down any time, but it is<br/>
truly awesome!  Not  really New Mexican food, but they do have a good green<br/>
chilie  cheeseburger, and they will make you a veggie burger version if you<br/>
want!  The wine margaritas rock!!<br/>
<br/>
--For the record, the OLD Sadies (in the bowling alley) was WAY better.  My<br/>
FIL says that the clean, new, kitchen in the new building destroyed the food<br/>
LOL :-) .<br/>
<br/>
--Speaking of my FIL, though not an unschooler himself, hes still about the<br/>
unschooliest guy Ive ever known, and hes a big fly-fishing guy.  Hed be<br/>
thrilled to take anyone who wanted to go on a side trip to the San Juan for<br/>
fly-fishing and back country camping.  Hes also a New Mexico history book<br/>
in his own right, not to mention a master furniture maker with a fully<br/>
equipped shop just down the road from Old Town.  Think of the, what do you<br/>
call themfunshop-- opportunities?<br/>
<br/>
--Weve got at least one 7 passenger van and a pick-up to help with airport<br/>
and luggage stuff.<br/>
<br/>
--SONIC!<br/>
<br/>
-- And, lest we forget, Frontier cinnamon rolls!  I think we could fit<br/>
about, oh, several hundred or so in our van!<br/>

Tami, who at this moment would happily trade fresh-from-the-ocean-sushi for<br/>
a Sonic coke.<br/>

&gt; Gardunos  is always a fun place to<br/>
&gt; hang for drinks, though it&#39;s more commercial than  some of the really<br/>
&gt; good New Mexican food  places.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ==========<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s my favorite, though, hands down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Albuquerque has a law about liquor sales too close to a church, so I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; the fancy restaurant on the plaza (that&#39;s in an old hotel) might not<br/>
&gt; be able to<br/>
&gt; serve drinks because of San Felipe church.  There should be margaritas<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; the hotel, though, and over at the lounge on the north side of Old<br/>
&gt; Town, the<br/>
&gt; name of which is escaping me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh no, that restaruant definitely serves margaritas--if it&#39;s the one I&#39;m<br/>
thinking about--directly to the East of the church?  I had a margarita<br/>
there the first week I lived in Albuquerque and I&#39;ve had several since!<br/>
<br/>
The best margaritas in town are at Sadie&#39;s, though.  That&#39;s about 15<br/>
minutes away from Old Town.<br/>

<br/>
It will be very, very hot a month or two from now.<br/>
And though it&#39;s kid of inconceivable to people from most places, our camping <br/>
places tend not to have running water.  No flush toilets. Noplace to wash <br/>
hands.  No ... you know... *running water* in the form of rivers or streams.  <br/>
<br/>
Desert.<br/>
<br/>
Water is brought in plastic containers.<br/>
<br/>
People from other places tend to complain about that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there are a few places that could accommodate smallish <br/>
groups.<br/>

Well late summer&#39;s okay if we go to the Jemez Mountains, up high.<br/>
Getting here by car, through Arizona, or from Texas, in summer can be a  drag.<br/>
 <br/>
It gets too cold by October, though.<br/>
 <br/>
Keith would be willing to help me organize a camping thang, I bet.  <br/>

Good reason.<br/>
 <br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to come to camp instead of going to a real hotel  <br/>
conference with speakers and workshops and all that.   <br/>
 <br/>
Roxana Sorooshian might want to have it planned around an opera she&#39;d like  <br/>
to see in Santa Fe.   <br/>
