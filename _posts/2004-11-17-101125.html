And  again, I&#39;ll scream! &lt;g&gt;: I insist that we&#39;re NOT homeschoolers to   <br/>
anyone <br/>
that asks. I insist that we&#39;re UNschoolers because it matters to me  that  we <br/>
NOT be lumped together with those  freaks.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of being lumped together either.  But I refuse  to give <br/>
up the word homeschooling.  In my state I am homeschooling.  I  am a <br/>
homeschooling Mom who unschools.  And even further I am a  homeschooling Mom who <br/>
unschools and takes that philosophy a bit further into  radical unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Those people also call themselves parents.  And legally they are  right, but <br/>
we parent in VERY different ways.  I will not give up the title  of parent <br/>
either just because I don&#39;t want us to be all lumped together.  I  am a parent <br/>
who believes in consensual living.  <br/>
 <br/>
I work hard where I live to show people that not all homeschoolers are  <br/>
alike.  We are a very diverse group of parents.  <br/>
 <br/>
I do not agree with Helen either.  Yes, unschoolers are a segment of  the <br/>
homeschooling population, but not all homeschoolers are unschoolers.   Until we <br/>
talk about all the differences in homeschooling we cannot begin to show  the <br/>
world the diversity that is homeschooling.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just my thoughts,<br/>

It is the narrowness of HSLDA&#39;s focus as a fundamentalist Christian organization, intent on defining homeschooling only by their standards of compliance (often more intrusive than existing laws in some states) that places in jeopardy our liberty to keep our kids out of public school.  Beyond their narrow agenda for homeschooling, is their political agenda lobbying for a variety of issues that are not unique to homeschoolers. All in all, they are more a threat and hindrance than a help to the majority of homeschoolers.  After all, HSLDA&#39;s &#39;brand&#39; of Christian school-at-home is really a very small part of the larger homeschooling community.<br/>

<br/>
Most of the homeschoolers in the U.S. don&#39;t want to unite with the likes of <br/>
me.  <br/>
Many homeschooling families wouldn&#39;t let their daughters date my sons, if <br/>
they were to let their daughters date at all (and more and more, not fewer, are <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not just in the southeast that there are Christian homeschoolers, but <br/>
they have some HUGE Christian homeschooling conventions.   Not 300 or 500 <br/>
people.  They&#39;ll have that many vendors and THOUSANDS of families (or at least <br/>
parents, maybe not kids). <br/>
<br/>
They have magazines like this:<br/>

<br/>
Q: What type of families homeschool their children?<br/>
A: Although homeschoolers are often stereotyped as hippies or religious <br/>
fanatics, most homeschoolers are just normal parents who have decided to take <br/>
charge of their children’s education. Homeschoolers are everywhere and come from <br/>
all walks of life. They live in cities, in the suburbs, and in the country. They <br/>
are doctors and janitors and public school teachers. Some homeschoolers have <br/>
strong religious beliefs and some are nonbelievers. Homeschoolers are just <br/>
like you.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  &quot;nonbelievers.&quot;  Either you&#39;re strongly religious or you&#39;re a <br/>
nonbeliever, in some people&#39;s summary estimation.<br/>

 <br/>
Q: What is homeschooling?<br/>
A: Homeschooling is the most flexible and diverse educational option <br/>
available today. The variety of homeschooling styles reflects the diversity of the <br/>
people who choose this method. Some families organize their homeschool the same <br/>
as a traditional school, with the children studying the same subjects the same <br/>
way as public school students. Some families use the opposite approach and <br/>
&quot;un-school&quot; their children-a far less structured approach where the children’s <br/>
schedule is determined by their interests and readiness. Most homeschoolers, <br/>
however, use an eclectic approach that is partly structured and partly <br/>
interest-based. This method allows parents to pick and choose the classes and materials <br/>
that meet their children’s needs. These may be college or co-op classes, pool <br/>
teaching, charter schools, independent study programs, apprenticeships, <br/>
volunteering, and a host of options. Homeschooling is as unique as you are.<br/>

strong religious beliefs and some are nonbelievers. Homeschoolers are just <br/>
like you.<br/>
Q: Is homeschooling legal?<br/>
A: Homeschooling is legal in all fifty states and throughout Canada. <br/>
Homeschooling is also becoming increasingly popular in Australia, New Zealand, <br/>
England, and Japan. However, every state and province has its own laws regarding <br/>
homeschooling and some are more &quot;friendly&quot; than others. Some homeschooling laws <br/>
merely require you to let your local school district know that you will be <br/>
homeschooling your children. Some laws require you to fill out paperwork as if you <br/>
were a private school. If you are considering homeschooling, you will need to <br/>
get information on the current laws in your area. State or local homeschool <br/>
groups are often the best source of information. A member of a support group in <br/>
your state can advise you on how to register as a homeschooler in your state. <br/>
It is NOT necessary to join a Legal Defense Fund. We also recommend become <br/>
familiar with your state&#39;s homeschool law at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org">http://www.nhen.org</a><br/>
Q: How much does homeschooling cost?<br/>
A: Depending on the choices you make, homeschooling can cost either a little <br/>
or a lot. Generally, you can assume that homeschooling costs more than a <br/>
public school education and less than a private school. If you had to, you could <br/>
homeschool for free using public resources like libraries, PBS shows, museums, <br/>
the Internet, and hand-me-down educational supplies.<br/>
<br/>
In general, homeschooling costs more if you use a boxed curriculum or sign up <br/>
with an independent study program. For example, in 2001, a complete fifth <br/>
grade program costs $570 from Calvert School, $230 from Alpha Omega Publications, <br/>
and $1,400 from Laurel Springs. Homeschooling costs are higher for teenagers <br/>
than for elementary school students, and fees are normally charged on a per <br/>
unit basis. Since many homeschool teens also take college classes, you will have <br/>
to factor that into your educational budget.<br/>
<br/>
You will also want to budget additional funding for extracurricular <br/>
activities such as soccer, gymnastics, martial arts, piano lessons, and the like. Since <br/>
homeschooled children have more time, they tend to participate in more of <br/>
these activities.</div>

yeah, you&#39;re right, Sandra -- on thinking about it further I realize the non-Christian folks are a minority.  I forget sometimes that my small community of diverse relaxed homeschooling or unschooling folks (with a fair sprinkling of pagans) are tiny minority.  Just wishful thinking on my part, I guess.<br/>

say your kids are in private school, people assume that means <br/>
Christian. In California, there are LOTS of private schools - some are <br/>
church-related schools and lots are not. There are private schools that <br/>
promote advanced academics, those that follow Montessori or Waldorf or <br/>
other specific methods, those that are for girls only, military <br/>
schools, and schools for kids with various special needs, and foreign <br/>
language immersion schools, and I know one school with a curriculum <br/>
based entirely on travel, and one that is based on the arts, and on and <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody assumes that a kid going to &quot;private school&quot; is anything in <br/>
particular.<br/>
<br/>
Same can be true of homeschooling - when there are enough people out <br/>
there that most people know a bunch of homeschoolers, then people will <br/>
not assume we&#39;re ALL like the family or two that they know.<br/>

is very unfortunate because whether we agree with someone or not that is no <br/>
reason to reject them as a person.  Often Christians forget that.  <br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
As for the HSLDA, I was recently introduced to them and I speak from my own <br/>
experience.  When I thought that I might need an attorney to fight for my <br/>
rights  to homeschool, they were ready to help and no one questioned me about my <br/>
faith.  It didn&#39;t come up in the discussion at all.<br/>
<br/>
You ask me to ask myself questions like am I an unschooler before I encourage <br/>
unity.  Forgive me, but I don&#39;t understand why.  I am learning to unschool my <br/>
children.  But what has that to do with the fact that whether I homeschool or <br/>
unschool, I face opposition to doing things differently from the status quo.  <br/>
If I don&#39;t have my children in school, I am looked at as &quot;different&quot; and <br/>
therefore &quot;suspect&quot; and so are you.  So there is our common ground.  With mutual <br/>
respect for each other&#39;s rights to be different and who we are we can stand <br/>
united when our rights are challenged by those who want us to enroll our children <br/>
in school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813755045">Forgive me if I ask obvious questions, I am new to the group.<br/>
How do you yorself take care of studying and keeping updated? I am <br/>
finding that having children at home is very time-consuming. And do you <br/>
do that alone, or with other adults?<br/>
Do you have any learning time which is opened to your friends&#39; children <br/>
(homeschooled, or unschooled, or attending schools.) And if so, how is <br/>
that arranged?<br/>
Do you have any contact with local public or private schools, to, maybe, <br/>
take advantage of their resources? (obvious examples, the library and <br/>
the sport hall).<br/>
Do you have any contact with researchers to get any insight on how to <br/>
best allow our children to become outstanding adults - as well as giving <br/>
feedback on our experience, which, in turn, might change the tone of <br/>
some press reports and perception by the general public?<br/>

<br/>
Studying what and keeping updated on what?  I find and learn about anything<br/>
that interests me.  I do that while my children are pursuing their own<br/>
interests.   I have a lot more time for my own interests now that my<br/>
children are 8 and almost 10, but I still found some time for me when my<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a funny question for an unschooling list.  Most people who call<br/>
themselves unschoolers allow their children to learn anything they want, in<br/>
the way that they want.  My children asked me to help them with reading and<br/>
I helped them only as much as they wanted at that time.  <br/>

other independent agencies estimate approximately 2,000,000 <br/>
homeschooled kids. If we take an average of 3 kids per family then that <br/>
means HSLDA members constitute 10 percent of homeschooling families. <br/>
They probably have, on average, slightly larger families, so maybe that <br/>
ups it to 12 percent -- but it is a small percentage compared to the <br/>
way HSLDA sometimes acts like all homeschoolers except a few pagans <br/>
and/or unschoolers are members.<br/>
<br/>
 From 70,000 member families, their affiliates, such as CHEA of <br/>
California, pack in 5,000 or so individual people in their conventions. <br/>
That&#39;s big relative to the non-Christian homeschooling conferences, but <br/>
still darn small compared to the total number of homeschoolers, most of <br/>
who do not go to the big conventions or conferences.<br/>

True (hopefully I&#39;m remembering right...sure she&#39;ll let me know if I&#39;m <br/>
wrong) story:<br/>
Tuck and I went to a HSLDA sponsored support group leaders &quot;meeting&quot; a <br/>
few years ago.<br/>
Why?<br/>
Curiosity and the offer of a free sit down meal at one of the better <br/>
hotels in town was probably a drawing point. I can&#39;t remember if Farris <br/>
himself was there or if it was Dee Black and some other guys who believe <br/>
in being accountable to someone or not.<br/>
So the whole annoying affair was drawing to a close (the lunch was very <br/>
good by the way) and it had come to a Q&A time. I can&#39;t remember exactly <br/>
who or why the question was asked, but the talk turned to these &quot;new&quot; <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
&quot;New&quot; as in non-christian.<br/>
These local support group leaders had no experience with secular <br/>
homeschoolers....or in some cases did not even know they existed. One <br/>
woman proudly said that she advised folks without a relationship with <br/>
God to NOT homeschool. She could not imagine how one could get through <br/>
it without prayer and since there were no support groups for them they <br/>
would be all alone.<br/>
~sigh~<br/>
The truth is they would rather not even be around us. When our inclusive <br/>
group started we were labeled the &quot;Pagan&quot; group (not a bad thing at <br/>
all...unless one is in the Bible Belt) and leaders referred to as <br/>
witches...and that was not to keep from using bitch, they meant literal <br/>
witches. Another thing not at all bad to be, but if your working on <br/>
keeping power that labels work.<br/>
And that&#39;s what its about with HSLDA and their toady &quot;local&quot; groups.<br/>
Power.<br/>
These guys do way more then homeschooling issues. They lobby for tons of <br/>
&quot;conservative&quot; issues.<br/>
~gah~<br/>
I could go on, but I&#39;ve lost my point.....<br/>

-----------------<br/>
<br/>
That used to happen a lot when AOL had all the homeschooling stuff in one <br/>
place.  People would say &quot;Why would a homeschooler ever...&quot; and fill it in with <br/>
something like &quot;support abortion rights&quot; or &quot;all their children to watch R <br/>
rated movies&quot; or whatever, and when someone would say &quot;Not all homeschoolers are <br/>
Christian,&quot; someone would express total shock.  These are some of the <br/>
expressions I remember:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why would anyone homeschool if she didn&#39;t have to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why would God call non-Christians to homeschool?&quot;  (weird one)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why are non-Christians riding our coattails?&quot;  <br/>
(secular homeschoolers predated the christian homeschooling movement by at <br/>
least five or seven years)<br/>
<br/>
and some kind of surprise that there would be any reason for non-Christians <br/>
(by which they meant not fundamentalist born-again Christians) to avoid <br/>
schools.  School couldn&#39;t hurt their kids, after all, as they were already in sin (I <br/>
guess).  And if a family homeschools to shelter their children from sin, <br/>
they&#39;re as unlikely to want them to come over to my house as to school.  MORE <br/>
unlikely, probably. School doesn&#39;t show South Park or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.<br/>
<br/>
But that was many years ago, and maybe by now they&#39;re all aware that they&#39;re <br/>
not the only people in heaven.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

back.  When we were first homeschooling, we were in the only homeschool group <br/>
we knew in the area which in a very short time went from proclaiming to be <br/>
inclusive to requiring a &quot;statement of faith&quot;  to be in the group. <br/>
<br/>
A few of us who were very uncomforable with that started a new group with the <br/>
intent of it being just a relaxed unstructured support group.  A member of <br/>
the old group who was Southern Baptist (I think they all were come to think of <br/>
it) called up one of our new group to strongly warn her that one of us was a <br/>
&quot;witch&quot;  A witch that practiced witchcraft.  I wondered who that could be <br/>
although it wouldn&#39;t have bothered me in the least for her to be part of the group.<br/>

if they do, they are worded in such a way as to make the numbers look <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038664239">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Forgive me if I ask obvious questions, I am new to the group.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may find many of your questions answered by reading at<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling and looking at Danielle Conger&#39;s website and<br/>
blog http://www.danielleconger.com/Homeschool/Welcomehome.html<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that we can&#39;t answer your questions, it&#39;s just that the answer to a<br/>
lot of them would be &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot;. The whole point of Unschooling<br/>
is to spend the majority of our time with our children. These websites have<br/>
the specific experiences you are interested in hearing about. Unschooling<br/>
looks different in every household because it is fundamentally about freedom<br/>
to tailor our lives to the needs of the individuals and the family first.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you have any learning time which is opened to your friends&#39; children<br/>
<br/>
(homeschooled, or unschooled, or attending schools.) And if so, how is <br/>
that arranged?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers tend to believe that 100% of a person&#39;s waking hours are<br/>
&quot;learning time&quot;, including activities like staring at the clouds. Learning<br/>
is not separated from life. I arrange play dates for my daughter by picking<br/>
up the phone or speaking to Moms at park day or dance class. I usually get<br/>
an adult visitor at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you have any contact with local public or private schools, to, maybe,<br/>
<br/>
take advantage of their resources? (obvious examples, the library and <br/>
the sport hall).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Los Angeles Public Library system is so much better than any school<br/>
library could possibly be. Some Colleges allow the public to use their<br/>
libraries, although I doubt that books could be borrowed. We (ie the<br/>
Coburns) have no interest in any contact with the local school system<br/>
resources.<br/>
<br/>
The playing sport question depends on the State and the school district.<br/>
There are also home school leagues for some sports. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you have any contact with researchers to get any insight on how to <br/>
best allow our children to become outstanding adults - as well as giving <br/>
feedback on our experience, which, in turn, might change the tone of <br/>
some press reports and perception by the general public?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only research I have needed is the fine example of parents here, some<br/>
with over 20 years experience with grown children, and the experience of<br/>
hearing about and meeting some of the kids themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for some formula for Jayn to *become* an outstanding adult.<br/>
She already is a wonderful and interesting person. Unschoolers tend to focus<br/>
on the present.<br/>
<br/>
The information that is freely available to you, is freely available to<br/>
researchers and journalists also. Sometimes all they want is a soundbite,<br/>
not an essay. People have given interviews with varying satisfaction at the<br/>
results, although the general feeling seems to be that they have been a<br/>
positive contribution to the universe of information.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I would also be interested in more specific experiences, such as, did <br/>
any of you allow their children to read by themselves? I have a daughter <br/>
who&#39;ll be 5 in March, and I&#39;m thinking of teaching her to read, but I&#39;m <br/>
very interested to hear any of you who did otherwise.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

marks on paper and screen represent spoken words. In the last 6 months she<br/>
has spontaneously been deducing that certain words begin with certain<br/>
letters - usually correctly. Sometimes she will hear a sound in the word and<br/>
relate it to another word. One thing that intrigues her is the way the names<br/>
of letters have different letters in them, for example &quot;eff&quot; begins with an<br/>
&quot;e&quot;. This sometimes leads her to assert that the word &quot;egg&quot; begins with &quot;f&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I read to Jayn when she asks me to. This will be at different times. We have<br/>
no bedtime routine or set schedule during the day, so the amount of reading<br/>
I do for her is irregular. Some days she seems to want me to read to her for<br/>
hours, continually choosing different stories, other times we go for several<br/>
days without me reading any stories or books. However Jayn is still<br/>
surrounded by a print rich environment. She is also interested in<br/>
catalogues, magazines and computer games. She sees me and dh reading many<br/>
different sources every day.<br/>
<br/>
She is still in the process of writing her birthday thank you cards to all<br/>
her friends. She draws a portrait of the giver, and then is writing &quot;Thank<br/>
you [name] Jayn&quot; inside, or &quot;Dear [name] Thanks Jayn&quot;. She often wants to<br/>
write sentences and asks me to spell the words for her. I tell her the<br/>
spelling, and then she will either write the letters from her memory or ask<br/>
what they look like. I show her either with my fingers (which she also likes<br/>
to do), or I find it written on the labels or book covers around us. As the<br/>
last resort, I write the letter on her magnadoodle for her to see it, if she<br/>
hasn&#39;t recalled the shape from my description. She has been both writing and<br/>
typing (for computer games) her own name for many months.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is interested in the idea of different fonts. She notices when some<br/>
letters are &quot;fancy&quot;. She is mostly writing in capitals, although will create<br/>
some fancy versions of her own name sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I have never &quot;taught&quot; her to read or write anything. All of her reading or<br/>
writing activities are of her own instigation, although I did suggest that<br/>
she should create the thank you cards. I had the expectation that I would be<br/>
doing the writing in them, so I got a delightful surprise when she wanted<br/>
to! She is exactly where she is meant to be. Of all her friends who are<br/>
close to her age, one is an early reader, one shows no interest in doing any<br/>
writing or drawing whatsoever (according to her mom), and the others all<br/>
seem to be doing about the same amount of writing that Jayn does. The<br/>
difference? Most of the others have mothers who are making them do reading<br/>
and writing lessons. Jayn shows that lessons are simply not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I would never impose a teaching type activity on her, because I don&#39;t want<br/>
her to get the idea that what she has been doing is inadequate or wrong. I<br/>
don&#39;t want her confidence in her own judgment and acuity to be diminished in<br/>
any way.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m asssuming you&#39;re talking about my own studying and updating... Right <br/>
now, my house is quiet and it&#39;s almost 10am &lt;bg&gt; I&#39;ve been up reading, <br/>
studying and updating for an hour or so; this IS my morning routine.  I <br/>
snach chances at the internet spradically throughout the day, but once <br/>
the kids are awake, it&#39;s a perpetual *rock/paper/scissors* for who&#39;s up <br/>
next.  I get plenty of time to spend with other adults, as my kids have <br/>
activities almost every day, with other homeschooled kids and their <br/>
parents.  I am the secretary of our lil homeschool group, so I&#39;m as <br/>
visible as possible at most of our activities (though I&#39;ve recently <br/>
taken to heart Sandra&#39;s long past comments about no field trips -- <br/>
aaaaaahhhh, our life is SO much better without the *greatly enocuraged* <br/>
trips to insipid places, one of the other board members shows her face <br/>
for those -- we go to the places we /want/ to go, /when/ we want to <br/>
go!)  I&#39;ve got a great support system of my own, not all unschoolers, <br/>
not even all homeschoolers, nor, gasp, all respectful (in our <br/>
definition) parents - I&#39;m an indiscriminate friend &lt;vbg&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you have any learning time which is opened to your friends&#39; children(homeschooled, or unschooled, or attending schools.) And if so, how is that arranged?  Do you have any contact with local public or private schools, to, maybe, take advantage of their resources? (obvious examples, the library and the sport hall).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    We  have communicated with our local community centers [they&#39;re <br/>
located at public schools, but paid for by city/county taxes] about <br/>
using their *open gym* time.  They&#39;ve always had play time for toddlers <br/>
on a daily basis, all over town.  When some homeschooling families came <br/>
to use that time for their entire families, they were sent away for <br/>
having the older children mixed with the younger ones.  After some teary <br/>
discussions, they now have open gym/open games 4 afternoons a week <br/>
(during school hours) for all ages -- not specifically for the <br/>
homeschool community, but open to us.  We take advantage at least once a <br/>
week; so far it&#39;s worked out wonderfully.  Even when the PE teacher on <br/>
the other side of the nylon gym divider gets pissy for having to compete <br/>
against playgroups all day [I *do* understand his pain] and gets out his <br/>
PA to talk to his class, we just pack up and go to the game room where <br/>
we can play FREE air hockey and choose from over 100 boardgames and 4 <br/>
video game systems!!  We are quick to get out of there before school <br/>
lets out, so we don&#39;t have to fight the traffic of kids pouring into the <br/>
community center where they can stay until 6pm or the traffic of parents <br/>
trying to get their kids home. <br/>
    Every Friday we have an activity: Bowling, Swimming 2x/mo, and Game <br/>
Day.  On days when there is no public school (including all summer <br/>
long), siblings and friends often join us. My kids get to see &#39;schooled <br/>
kids&#39; every Sunday at church; our Sunday School program is run by an <br/>
unschooling mom so the atmospere is very relaxed &lt;g&gt; For the schoolkids <br/>
it&#39;s a treat, for my kids it&#39;s not a huge *school-like* imposition into <br/>
their week.  My good friend with schooled kids has decided NOT to let <br/>
our kids socialize as her kids have a bad attitude about school after <br/>
being with mine for extended periods.  SHE doesn&#39;t want to deal with it, <br/>
so the kids don&#39;t see each other.  In reality, my kids had to struggle <br/>
so much to understand the school mentality [Hayden&#39;s a boooooy, we can&#39;t <br/>
play with /him/]of these kids that they don&#39;t miss them very often. <br/>
    Our school district offers the text books for home use.  Last year, <br/>
I brought them home and let them take up space on our shelves for the <br/>
&quot;just in case&quot; someone wanted to see them.  THIS year, I don&#39;t have room <br/>
on my shelves for books we don&#39;t love, so I didn&#39;t accept their books. <br/>
    The public libraries are REALLY QUIET during the afternoons! We have <br/>
the librarians to ourselves &lt;bg&gt; not to mention the computers are always <br/>
available and we get to choose from a fully stocked video/dvd library!!  <br/>
The zoo is ours and so is the local children&#39;s science center.  <br/>
Honestly, I like the reduced germ factor when we&#39;re there alone &lt;vbg&gt; <br/>
not to mention the noise factor.<br/>
    We are beginning a Destination Imagination program [which I somehow <br/>
got snagged into coordinating] in our group.  We have enough kids for <br/>
two complete teams, but some of the older kids want a different <br/>
project.  We may have to open the team to schooled kids or have our kids <br/>
join a &#39;school&#39; team in order to participate in their dream team.  As an <br/>
unschooler, I love the improv aspect of this program and the whole <br/>
&#39;think outside of the box&#39; mentality of the organization. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Do you have any contact with researchers to get any insight on how to <br/>
&gt;best allow our children to become outstanding adults - as well as giving <br/>
&gt;feedback on our experience, which, in turn, might change the tone of <br/>
&gt;some press reports and perception by the general public?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ME.  I have regular, daily, almost momentary conversations with myself.  <br/>
The one who is on this path of journey and discovery about how to best <br/>
*ALLOW* my children to become the adults they&#39;re meant to be.  Okay, I&#39;m <br/>
sniggering about *allow* -- what that means to me is that I move MYSELF <br/>
out of the way of my children&#39;s lives and let them have their own, allow <br/>
them to have issues that are completely different than mine.  MY schooly <br/>
ideas and MY fears and MY ideals have no room on their journey -- <br/>
they&#39;re MY issues to deal with, dealing with them as mine makes all our <br/>
our journeys easier.  THEY give me regular feedback on how I&#39;m doing.  <br/>
THEY let me know immediatly what is working and what isn&#39;t.  THEY are <br/>
not afraid to tell me what they need or that they need something and <br/>
could I help them figure out what it is... The public perception that <br/>
needs the most work is the perception of children as minions, as <br/>
mindless robots who have no voice worth hearning; that&#39;s the one I work <br/>
on daily. <br/>
I have opportunities to contribute as diana, the home/unschooling mommy <br/>
who is also a real-live human being: I&#39;m part of the Dakota Comment <br/>
panel for our local newspaper, every week my opinion appears with my <br/>
heading: Diana Jenner, 36, Homeschooling mother;  I was just asked to be <br/>
part of a panel for SD Public Broadcasting to discuss the recent article <br/>
about the high % of kids in daycare in SD -- I declined as I don&#39;t find <br/>
the relevance, but they are keeping my info in case there comes a <br/>
homeschool issue to discuss;  I speak at church, most recently a talk <br/>
entitiled &quot;A UUnique Perspective on Homeschooling&quot; which included an <br/>
hour long group discussion following the talk;  anyone who goes to <br/>
www.southdakotahomeschool.com can find my phone number and call me for <br/>
info -- I&#39;ve been the first contact for many people exploring <br/>
homeschooling in SD and I&#39;m glad to be the first one to tell them to <br/>
relax and enjoy the ride.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I would also be interested in more specific experiences, such as, did <br/>
&gt;any of you allow their children to read by themselves? I have a daughter <br/>
&gt;who&#39;ll be 5 in March, and I&#39;m thinking of teaching her to read, but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;very interested to hear any of you who did otherwise.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I owned materials to *teach* my kids to read... I found them insipid and <br/>
the kids did too!  Just as I carried them for as long as it took for <br/>
them to walk (and my heart broke as they each did learn it, in spite of <br/>
what others warned me about wearing my babies), I read to my children <br/>
for as long as it takes for them to read.  AND just as I continued to <br/>
carry those babies long after they were walking experts, I continue to <br/>
read to my children.  At 6.5, Hannah decided she could read and, by <br/>
golly, she did!  Her brother is now near that age and has been &quot;a <br/>
reader&quot; for over a year, her aptitude sparked his interest better than I <br/>
EVER could have with any *learn to read* technique. Reading came easy to <br/>
me as a kid, because I saw the value it had to MY life immediately.  <br/>
I&#39;ve always always loved to read.  My kids read because they enjoy it, I <br/>
read to them because we all enjoy it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thanks a lot to everyone who&#39;ll reply<br/>
&gt;Daniela<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope my blathering helps quell some of your fears and makes today more <br/>
joyful for you and your daughter! <br/>

the only chance people have to look at all that stuff - it isn&#39;t like <br/>
there are homeschool supply stores in every area and, even where there <br/>
are such stores, they&#39;re small. The vendor halls are really something <br/>
to see - I find them fascinating and, sometimes, even find things I <br/>
want - like unusual games. They can also be disgusting and upsetting, <br/>
by the way, and sometimes my fascination is of the morbid variety.<br/>
<br/>
But, anyway, people here go to CHEA&#39;s convention because it is so big - <br/>
of the hundreds of speakers, people can avoid the extremists and often <br/>
there are those who are offering great information mixed up with the <br/>
others. They even have &quot;Christian unschooling&quot; talks - it isn&#39;t all <br/>
Abeka and so on.<br/>

Thanks so much!  NJ isn&#39;t too bad yet but there is alot that they are trying <br/>
to have happen because of the Jackson case.  I used to homeschool foster <br/>
children with my children but now we are not allowed to.  HSLDA will go to court <br/>
for me if it becomes illegal to homeschool adopted children because some of my <br/>
children are adopted.  What county are you from and how long have you been in <br/>
Conn.?<br/>
