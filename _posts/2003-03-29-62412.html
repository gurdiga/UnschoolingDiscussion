<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061104746">Thanks I haven&#39;t seen that particular page before. <br/>
As a side note I have learned a lot about crime and violence from a young age for almost 20 years now. <br/>
I had a sister that went missing in 1983 {as i said before all my sisters{had 3 of them} were 8+ years then I so I was rather young at 13 and she was 22}  and we are pretty sure it was due to her mixing into the wrong crowd of people. {this particular group wasn&#39;t a religious group though}  <br/>
This being a part of who I have come to be, I find forensic evidence including, what drives people to do some of the things they do and all things incompassing because it is something I NEVER wanted to happen to my own kids.  Anyway I don&#39;t claim to be an expert, I&#39;m sure far from it, but this rings pretty true to me. A good enough resorce to link to. <br/>
Thanks Again :) <br/>
