<div id="ygrps-yiv-144724714">I ordered the curriculum from Sonlight several years ago when I took Landon <br/>
out of  5th grade.  It was actually perfect for him because he loved to read, <br/>
and basically, thats all it was.  It was recommended to add a math text to <br/>
the curriculum and some science, but we didnt do that.  Pretty much, we just <br/>
added books to our library that we didnt already have.  They do have a <br/>
&quot;lesson plan&quot;/ Teacher&#39;s guide, but we never used those.   It would be MUCH <br/>
cheaper to just borrow the books from the library, but the list they use IS a <br/>
very good suggestion for reading.  Ambleside Online also has similar lists of <br/>
books and uses a similar approach.   I just print off the lists and let the <br/>
kids look at them, or find the books in the library to see if they are <br/>
interested.  Anna has found some really good stuff that she has enjoyed that <br/>
she probably wouldn&#39;t have known about if we didn&#39;t have &quot;the list&quot;<br/>
