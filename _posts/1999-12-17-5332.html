 </span></blockquote>Claire and I went to an arts and crafts get together. We went only twice.<br/>
Each week there was a different &quot;project&quot; - making a marionette or <br/>
working with clay....There were many different materials - seemed neat...<br/>
  <br/>
I spoke to the &quot;teacher&quot; after she explained about the &quot;class&quot;.  I <br/>
explained my point of view - that it was the creative *process* that is<br/>
interesting and important. That I was seeking something free and <br/>
*unstructured*.  I must have been dreaming.   <br/>
<br/>
I hung out reading a book. <br/>
<br/>
The teacher took the black marker that Claire chose for her marionette,<br/>
explained that it was dark and not good - and she began to show<br/>
Claire how to do it - coloring almost all of the marionette as Claire<br/>
watched.  I put my book down, and explained again to the teacher that <br/>
it is *Claire* who is creating something in her own way.  &quot;Where is the <br/>
problem with black&quot;, I asked? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s sad&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Really&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No. Claire does not see this black color as sad.  *You* see the<br/>
black color as sad.  I like it.  Nice contrast&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I placed the black marker back within reach of Claire and said she<br/>
was free to choose any color she wishes and that her Marionette is fine<br/>
and beautiful.   <br/>
<br/>
I gently recapped my ideas.  The teacher said she thoroughly understood<br/>
my point of view, but went on to stress the importance of the<br/>
finished product. She discussed that the *parents* were going to see<br/>
the artwork.  She went on to tell me how much more &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open <br/>
minded&quot; she was. <br/>
<br/>
I felt as if I were talking to a tree trunk.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I was told the following week that I could not stay - that<br/>
no parents were permitted to stay.  Needless to say - I no longer<br/>
wanted to stay.  Claire and I left - went to the park to breath some<br/>
fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
The pottery class that we attended months before at the same place<br/>
(Maison du Temps Libre - House of Free Time - Ha!) had the same<br/>
overwhelming structure and pressure.  Claire was enjoying forming<br/>
clay into a shape, then poking and sculpting it with a tool when she <br/>
was told to make a mobile.  Stars and moons were set in front of <br/>
here and she was told to quickly get going - with much rush and clapping.<br/>
She ignored the instruction, thoroughly engrossed in what she was doing.<br/>
I mentioned she seemed to be enjoying what she was already making.<br/>
I explained the same stuff to this teacher, once again, as I had done<br/>
only moments early, just as I did with the other teacher.  <br/>
<br/>
Another tree trunk.<br/>
<br/>
Gymnastics was even worse - but a better end to a story:<br/>
<br/>
The teacher explained that no parents were permitted to cross the metal <br/>
barrier. This was unacceptable to Claire, as the &quot;class&quot; was being held <br/>
in the other corner of a huge gymnasium.  We bowed out but I hung out <br/>
to check out her &quot;program&quot; and to watch what was supposedly free choice<br/>
 - using any and all of the gym equipment (one staying on the trampoline <br/>
for as long as one wanted - and moving onto the rings if one chose to, <br/>
for example...)  <br/>
<br/>
The teacher sat upon a &#39;horse&#39; and had a big queen paper hat on.<br/>
She sat upon this explaining something to all the children who sat<br/>
around her below.  This went on for about 10 minutes.  The children<br/>
all moved together - following the teachers instructions - back and<br/>
forth - and then gathering around her again.  I have no idea<br/>
what she was saying - her back was to me and she was far away...Seemed<br/>
to me, though, that these kids did little more than listen to the Queen<br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
In front of us, though, there was a group of boys - 6 - from ages 5 to <br/>
about 11.  They were not sitting and listening to someone talk - they <br/>
were *moving*. They jumped onto a &#39;horse&#39; from a spring board and flipped <br/>
off onto a huge thick mat.  The teacher, Jean Pierre, invited Claire, <br/>
who was watching and wanted to join in, into the line.  She did a few <br/>
jumps and was having a ball.  They did &quot;tarzan&quot; on the rings, swinging <br/>
out onto a huge mat. I took my shoes off and hung out by the edge of the<br/>
mats - crossing the No Parent barrier.  The queen didn&#39;t kick me out<br/>
and JP didn&#39;t seem to mind...  <br/>
<br/>
I asked later if it were possible for Claire to join the boys group.<br/>
<br/>
No way.<br/>
<br/>
She had to be in the baby class with only children her age (3/4).  <br/>
This group - the *fun* group that *moved*, was only for boys.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone on much too long here - I just wanted to share that it is<br/>
my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>
*specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that incorporating children into the real world<br/>
- of all that we are already doing or choose to do - offers so much.<br/>
And so, if I feel like doing pottery - or if Claire feels like doing<br/>
some pottery - I&#39;ll get some clay and just do it.  Or take a class<br/>
for adults and bring her with me.  She can join in without limits that <br/>
are imposed on her simply because she is a child.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, too, I saw a first ray of hope when Jean Luc, my husband,<br/>
told me he did understand the no schooling thing - that he wished<br/>
he had been free to choose to seek out freely what he wanted to know<br/>
- and without testing.<br/>
    <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my ramblings...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Diane, I really enjoyed reading your tales of the &quot;child friendly&quot; classes.  <br/>
Reminds me a great deal of many of our experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a French teacher by profession, by the way.  Now &quot;retired&quot;--ha ha!  Our <br/>
local home schooling group has learning afternoons on Wednesday.  The French, <br/>
German and art classes are taught by moms in the group and the science <br/>
classes taught by a woman who gives science enrichment classes to various <br/>
groups.  The science teacher has &quot;learned&quot; from our group, I think, and has <br/>
really changed her style since the beginning of the year.  All of the <br/>
teachers welcome the moms in their classes.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m teaching two French classes, one for pre-school and one for about age <br/>
eight and up.  The moms who stay in the younger class are such a joy and an <br/>
enormous help in encouraging the children.  I can&#39;t imagine this group now <br/>
without them. I&#39;ve taught young children in many different situations in the <br/>
past, but this is our first year of home schooling and I had no idea what to <br/>
expect of these children and was REALLY nervous at the beginning.  What I&#39;ve <br/>
discovered is that the more unstructured the class, the better, in most ways. <br/>
 We are having a ball.  <br/>

Teaching - well... school, just by its very nature, has an end in mind.<br/>
No only is the end more important that the experience, but it gets<br/>
labeled good or bad in any number of ways. If there were no end in mind,<br/>
the teacher would not be needed - as a teacher, anyway - it (teaching) <br/>
would have more to do with sharing information.  It is the teacher who <br/>
assesses - even as the child is doing. This ruins and distracts from <br/>
the process and the fun of living and doing - knowing/learning.  I can <br/>
think of nothing that destroys art, creativity and individuality more <br/>
than one who sets out to teach something, rather than share ideas by<br/>
just doing what one does, naturally and by supporting another person&#39;s<br/>
interests when they seek out information.  It&#39;s about sharing <br/>
information, respectfully, never setting out to &quot;teach&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What is that Chinese saying?...somthing along the lines of:<br/>
The worst teacher teaches students.<br/>
A good teacher respects students.<br/>
The wisest teacher&#39;s teachings go completely unnoticed.<br/>
<br/>
The last is into his own work and stuff - he naturally teaches others<br/>
who are interested in what he does and have sought out more about <br/>
what he is doing. I imagine here, that less is said and more is done.  <br/>
People talk too much.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155277061">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed your rambling.  It&#39;s nice to read about parents that are noticing what<br/>
their children want to learn and going to bat for them.  I have a 5 1/2 year old<br/>
son.  We&#39;ve  just finished a swimming class.  It went great, they were willing<br/>
to be flexible with him when there were things he didn&#39;t want to try yet.  ( I&#39;m<br/>
able to watch through the glass windows)   He starts gymnastics next month (no<br/>
place for parents to watch)  We&#39;ll see how it goes, thanks for talking about<br/>
your experiences.  He is continuing with swimming class as well.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Happy  New Year!<br/>

&gt; wanted to stay.  Claire and I left - went to the park to breath some<br/>
&gt; fresh air.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The pottery class that we attended months before at the same place<br/>
&gt; (Maison du Temps Libre - House of Free Time - Ha!) had the same<br/>
&gt; overwhelming structure and pressure.  Claire was enjoying forming<br/>
&gt; clay into a shape, then poking and sculpting it with a tool when she<br/>
&gt; was told to make a mobile.  Stars and moons were set in front of<br/>
&gt; here and she was told to quickly get going - with much rush and clapping.<br/>
&gt; She ignored the instruction, thoroughly engrossed in what she was doing.<br/>
&gt; I mentioned she seemed to be enjoying what she was already making.<br/>
&gt; I explained the same stuff to this teacher, once again, as I had done<br/>
&gt; only moments early, just as I did with the other teacher.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another tree trunk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Gymnastics was even worse - but a better end to a story:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The teacher explained that no parents were permitted to cross the metal<br/>
&gt; barrier. This was unacceptable to Claire, as the &quot;class&quot; was being held<br/>
&gt; in the other corner of a huge gymnasium.  We bowed out but I hung out<br/>
&gt; to check out her &quot;program&quot; and to watch what was supposedly free choice<br/>
&gt;  - using any and all of the gym equipment (one staying on the trampoline<br/>
&gt; for as long as one wanted - and moving onto the rings if one chose to,<br/>
&gt; for example...)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The teacher sat upon a &#39;horse&#39; and had a big queen paper hat on.<br/>
&gt; She sat upon this explaining something to all the children who sat<br/>
&gt; around her below.  This went on for about 10 minutes.  The children<br/>
&gt; all moved together - following the teachers instructions - back and<br/>
&gt; forth - and then gathering around her again.  I have no idea<br/>
&gt; what she was saying - her back was to me and she was far away...Seemed<br/>
&gt; to me, though, that these kids did little more than listen to the Queen<br/>
&gt; talk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In front of us, though, there was a group of boys - 6 - from ages 5 to<br/>
&gt; about 11.  They were not sitting and listening to someone talk - they<br/>
&gt; were *moving*. They jumped onto a &#39;horse&#39; from a spring board and flipped<br/>
&gt; off onto a huge thick mat.  The teacher, Jean Pierre, invited Claire,<br/>
&gt; who was watching and wanted to join in, into the line.  She did a few<br/>
&gt; jumps and was having a ball.  They did &quot;tarzan&quot; on the rings, swinging<br/>
&gt; out onto a huge mat. I took my shoes off and hung out by the edge of the<br/>
&gt; mats - crossing the No Parent barrier.  The queen didn&#39;t kick me out<br/>
&gt; and JP didn&#39;t seem to mind...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I asked later if it were possible for Claire to join the boys group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She had to be in the baby class with only children her age (3/4).<br/>
&gt; This group - the *fun* group that *moved*, was only for boys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve gone on much too long here - I just wanted to share that it is<br/>
&gt; my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>
&gt; *specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems to me that incorporating children into the real world<br/>
&gt; - of all that we are already doing or choose to do - offers so much.<br/>
&gt; And so, if I feel like doing pottery - or if Claire feels like doing<br/>
&gt; some pottery - I&#39;ll get some clay and just do it.  Or take a class<br/>
&gt; for adults and bring her with me.  She can join in without limits that<br/>
&gt; are imposed on her simply because she is a child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last night, too, I saw a first ray of hope when Jean Luc, my husband,<br/>
&gt; told me he did understand the no schooling thing - that he wished<br/>
&gt; he had been free to choose to seek out freely what he wanted to know<br/>
&gt; - and without testing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for reading my ramblings...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885016972">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Well our &quot;school&quot; has begun.  Basically that means my 7 year old son and I<br/>
set a timer for 90 minutes every day, usually mornings and I will not answer<br/>
the phone, do dishes, laundry and other household or business chores.  My<br/>
son cannot play computer games, watch TV or do other activities he would do<br/>
&quot;independently.&quot;   It&#39;s been a great first few days.  We played &quot;Star Wars<br/>
Monopoly&quot; for a total of 5 hours across several days.  Great for math and<br/>
life skills.  He&#39;s in charge of the bank.  He won by the way.  We also did a<br/>
Science experiment.  We are currently playing Scrabble Junior.  I enter what<br/>
ever we&#39;re doing in a teacher planner and apply it to that subject.  We take<br/>
turns making suggestions on what to do in the 90 minutes set aside for us to<br/>
do &quot;school&quot; together.  30 minutes are also set aside for him to do those<br/>
more independent activities as well, I usually do my own thing then as well.<br/>
In the afternoon we do our outings, swimming, volunteering at the animal<br/>
shelter, grocery shopping.  This morning we have a tour of a cheeps factory.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be meeting both our needs at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Success,<br/>

<br/>
I have three questions for you to consider as you continue your journey <br/>
toward unschooling.  We don&#39;t need the answers, but you might.<br/>
<br/>
#1  What if a phone call was an invitation to go somewhere REALLY WONDERFUL?<br/>
Or someone saying someone you know was about to be on TV, or a talk show was <br/>
about to be about unschooling?<br/>
What if the phone call were someone needing emergency automotive help two <br/>
blocks away from you?  That would be more educational than just about any 90 <br/>
minute home-stuff.<br/>
<br/>
#2   Might it have been more useful to play a five hour game all in one day <br/>
than to stretch a five hour game over five days?  (And it might have been <br/>
only a four hour game, too, without the prep and review each day.)<br/>
<br/>
#3  Will the afternoon, evening, early morning, weekend, holiday activities <br/>
be considered potentially as warm, wonderful and educational as those marked <br/>
&quot;school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you have found the balance for your family.<br/>
It&#39;s been a 4 year struggle for us and I&#39;m still not<br/>
sure if we&#39;ve got it figured out. <br/>
Although I have to ask, are you sure you want to be on<br/>
the unschooling list? Unschooling is not the same as<br/>
homeschooling. Announcing that you are now &#39;doing<br/>
school&#39; might catch a lot of flak from an unschooling<br/>
email list because unschooling really means not doing<br/>
school at all. <br/>
Now I don&#39;t consider my family as unschoolers, but I<br/>
love this list anyway. It helps me as a mother to<br/>
remember to relax. Our family balance is so much<br/>
smoother when I read this list and unschooling.com. <br/>

in <br/>
screening out unwanted calls.  Same thing could happen while one is out of <br/>

<br/>
That seemed a sarcastic response to an honest and purposeful question.<br/>
<br/>
If I have had a blowout, I don&#39;t leave anybody a message.  I call around <br/>
until I find someone who can come and get me then.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m about to leave for a day at the zoo and we call Holly&#39;s friend to see <br/>
if she wants to go with us, leaving a message would be a cruel way to let her <br/>
know what she missed, if they come in from the store a half an hour later.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be available to my friends and relatives more than I want freedom <br/>
from answering a call.  Many of my own morning calls are from moms <br/>
desperately looking for homeschooling information.  If they don&#39;t talk to me, <br/>
they could easily end up talking to some curriculum salesman.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth considering the question, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

If anything happens that we want to do instead we simply stop the timer and<br/>
go do it.  We also just screen our phone calls.  I find unless we set up a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As far as I know, there is no brain chemistry or personality which needs <br/>
&gt;&gt;or would benefit most from the assembly-line-style school-at-home <br/>
&gt;&gt;curriculum. Nobody&#39;s individual neurology needs that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If school as we know it had never been invented, I wonder what our response <br/>
to kids who crave structure would be? I try to keep my mind thinking in <br/>
those terms, although do admit to sometimes going back to what I&#39;m familiar <br/>
with in times of stress. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If we had no concept of school-type lessons, then how would we approach the <br/>
structure situation?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573165835">Last night Holly said she wanted a schedule.  I asked &quot;Like what?&quot;  (She&#39;s <br/>
ten.)<br/>
<br/>
She said like a list of five things that need to be done by a certain time <br/>
each day.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if she was wanting me to come up with these things or if she was <br/>
going to.  She said she would, but she wanted me to help remind her to do <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt these are going to be academic things, but I&#39;ll let you <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
If she had said &quot;I want YOU to come up with them,&quot; I would have said no.<br/>
If she pressed (or if she presses me to help her) my best recommendations <br/>
would have to be watering plants, cleaning up around the TV/VCR/Playstation, <br/>
making her bed... stuff like that.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know if she&#39;ll remember today.<br/>

&gt;       As for your daughter, if she wants more structure, why not? you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; still following her lead and wishes. It may be something she needs. <br/>
&gt; Structure doesn&#39;t have to mean buying a curriculum but maybe more <br/>
&gt; worksheets or a set time to sit down and do things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or maybe she just needs help to develop her own structure, one that works <br/>
for her. Structure doesn&#39;t always need to be top down.<br/>

********************<br/>
Julian decided at one point that he wanted more structured, &quot;academic&quot; time. <br/>
Finally he scheduled several times during the week that he called &quot;study <br/>
halls&quot; when he did some sort of academic-y stuff. At first he was very structured <br/>
about that, with certain days being certain subject areas. Eventually he <br/>
settled into just using that time to read something he was interested in or do <br/>
something, not worrying about the &quot;subject.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
My role in this was (and maybe will be again) to put his study halls in my <br/>
calendar and remind him when he&#39;d scheduled one. Sometimes he&#39;d ask me to <br/>
suggest a book I thought he&#39;d like. That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taking a course right now at a college that&#39;s a lot of work, and he&#39;s <br/>
let go of the other structured stuff for now. He may go back to it. Might not.<br/>
<br/>
A very good unschooling friend of mine with a bunch of kids, including some a <br/>
lot older than Julian, told me that wanting to do more &quot;academic-y&quot; stuff <br/>
seemed to click in for her kids at about 14, and that I had permission not to <br/>
even think about it, much less worry about it, until then. (She was not <br/>
suggesting that if it didn&#39;t that I should then worry about it. Merely giving me an <br/>
excuse not to worry about it for a while.) It clicked in earlier than that, and <br/>
by then I had realized that he didn&#39;t have to be doing structured academic <br/>
stuff for him to be learning tons.<br/>
