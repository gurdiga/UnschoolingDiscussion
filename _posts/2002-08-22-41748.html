&gt; Yeah, most mowers can be fit with mulching attachments these days (all<br/>
&gt; it does is cover up the outlet).  Unless you have one of those old-timey<br/>
&gt; rotary mowers, like someone I know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>No need to cover up the outlet or buy a mulching mower. The clippings<br/>
disintegrate quickly as do the leaves. Keep that blade sharp.</div>

every third day, you&#39;re going to have to chop those blades of grass into <br/>
itty-bitty pieces to keep from having brown clumps of hay resting on <br/>
your lawn.<br/>
