<div id="ygrps-yiv-217136865">I dont mind if you answered my &quot;Tuck&quot; response.. lol.. I just put that in the <br/>
subject line diffferientiate it because  I didnt want to copy all that Tuck <br/>
said.. :-)  Now, about what you said... Thanks.. and I do think it will just <br/>
take time.. But hey, what have I got besides time?   Here&#39;s a little snippet <br/>
of this afternoon, and me catching myself..  We stopped at our corner store <br/>
for snacks and gas.. I had just picked up Landon.  The other kids and I had <br/>
been to the Y  swimming for a couple of hours and we were really hungry.  I <br/>
pulled in a parking space and  we jumped out.. Then I said.. OH. Landon, I <br/>
forgot, I need to get gas. will you pull the van over to the pump and get $10 <br/>
worth?  He said.. No, Mom, I dont want to pump the gas.  I said , Well, I am <br/>
getting you a snack in here ya know.(old habits). And he said.. Well, thats <br/>
OK, dont get me one, I have my own money.  ( heres my &#39;catching myself part) <br/>
I said.. Landon, Im sorry, I am getting you a snack whether you pump the gas <br/>
or not, I just asked if you would.  And he said.. well, your giving me a <br/>
choice and I said &quot;no&quot;   I said,thats fine, I ll get it when we come out.. He <br/>
said.. Well, thank you.   Hopefully, more of this type of exchange will lead <br/>
to me asking.. Landon, will you pump the gas while we get the snacks?  And <br/>
him say.. Sure, Ill be glad to.. .. (fingers crossed)<br/>

And more of that will make a difference as long as you don&#39;t lose patience <br/>
and keep reminding yourself not to say what you would usually say. He didn&#39;t <br/>
want to pump the gas probably because you were employing a tactic to <br/>
actually make him pump the gas. I do for you so now you have to do for me. <br/>
After him eventually seeing that you do for him without expecting anything <br/>
in return, he&#39;ll get why people do nice things for other people. Then he&#39;ll <br/>
get it do because he wants to, not cause he feels like he has to.<br/>
