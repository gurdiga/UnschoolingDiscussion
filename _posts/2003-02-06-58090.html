Thanks.<br/>

Too many parents (even unschoolers) simply tell the toddler that there&#39;s a <br/>
walk scheduled for next Thursday when other families can go too, and that on <br/>
Saturday there will be a caterpillar at the zoo with a docent and an <br/>
entymologist to answer all their questions. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids that small don&#39;t know what &quot;Saturday&quot; means, they just want to know more <br/>
about that thing they&#39;re seeing Right Now.  <br/>
