<div id="ygrps-yiv-199397826">****&lt;&lt;Kate in CA<br/>
who just lost a friendship today : ( &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because you could park better?<br/>
I hope you didn&#39;t lose the friendship about unschooling.  That&#39;s my<br/>
suspicion.  I wonder if we should start warning potential unschoolers<br/>
that<br/>
they might lose some friends over giving their kids so much freedom.<br/>
<br/>
And if you didn&#39;t lose your friendship over parking OR unschooling,<br/>
sorry for<br/>
guessing wrong.<br/>

LOL, I wish it was because I could park better.<br/>
<br/>
Actually it had had very little to do with unschooling and a lot to do<br/>
with watching a family spiral out of control with lying, drug use and<br/>
maybe (I can&#39;t prove this part) abuse.  I couldn&#39;t stand by and watch<br/>
anymore.  I spent the past 6-7 months trying to be there to help, but<br/>
there was always a new drama - one included my sweet 8 yos.  So I said<br/>
enough and backed out of the friendship.<br/>
<br/>
I did lose one friendship over unschooling, that was sad.  We had known<br/>
each other for over 23 years.<br/>
<br/>
But I still park pretty well.<br/>
