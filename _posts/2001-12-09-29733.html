<div id="ygrps-yiv-609784110">I&#39;ve described the early reading efforts of my older<br/>
daughter Carrie, who is dyslexic.  Her sister Phoenix,<br/>
ten years younger, has been a very different<br/>
experience.  As I&#39;ve said, I answer every question,<br/>
keep resources available, and help in the pursuit of<br/>
new information or skills when requested.  Phoenix was<br/>
reading and writing her name and a few very short<br/>
words at age two, with Carrie and I each teaching her,<br/>
at her own request.  Grocery shopping was fun because<br/>
of all the &quot;double-takes&quot; as Phoenix, again at age<br/>
two, walked along proudly reading the number of each<br/>
aisle.  When we tried public school at third grade,<br/>
Phoenix was tested for placement.  Her scores ranged<br/>
from third grade to high school level in the various<br/>
areas.  The counselor who tested her scolded me for<br/>
not keeping all areas on the same level of<br/>
proficiency.  Her lowest score, in case you are<br/>
curious, was in math.  She doesn&#39;t like math on paper,<br/>
but is brilliant with theoretic and practical math<br/>
concepts.  As I have mentioned, our relationship with<br/>
the public school system ended after three days.  I<br/>
did write to the state board of education about the<br/>
difficulties encountered there, never heard back from<br/>
them, but was called by the school principal a month<br/>
later.  She offered to enroll Phoenix in school again<br/>
under any circumstances I might dictate, but I told<br/>
her I was not interested.  I just worked harder at<br/>
maintaining Phoenix&#39;s safety and comfort in various<br/>
ways while I worked a five-minute walk from home, and<br/>
have continued homeschooling / unschooling weekends<br/>
and other odd hours.  <br/>
<br/>
My point is that both girls have been a breath-taking<br/>
delight and at times a heart-crushing ache.  Both are<br/>
fascinating, both love to learn new things, both<br/>
understand their own and each other&#39;s mental<br/>
processes.  Both appreciate their own and each other&#39;s<br/>
uniqueness.  <br/>
