&lt;&lt; Do the kids see the mom sticking up for them? That seems to be the most<br/>
important thing to establish before any moves are made. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but they don&#39;t see it going well.<br/>
<br/>
The dad&#39;s main tactic is &quot;We&#39;ll talk about this later,&quot; or &quot;I need to think <br/>
about that&quot; (if she asks a direct question like &quot;What are your priorities?&quot;)  <br/>
But he never gets back to her on any of it.  Later doesn&#39;t come.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If it is clear to<br/>
him that what ever ill-conceived power struggle he is having with the kids<br/>
will cost him the family he will either change because he values them (wife<br/>
and kids) or he won&#39;t and she will know what little value she and the kids<br/>
are to him and hopefully move on to doing whatever is necessary to protect<br/>
them. It has to come to this or it will only get worse.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They talked last night.  She called me to say they were done and she was fine <br/>
and she&#39;d tell me how it went later.  It was 12:30.  I&#39;d told her I would be <br/>
up late, but by that point I was asleep, so I&#39;ll learn more today.<br/>
<br/>
I feel really sorry for the stress.  Her plan was to start off talking about <br/>
his health and saying she was worried, and depending how that went decide <br/>
which route to go.  So she had no good clear plan, because she doesn&#39;t know <br/>
whether to take the &quot;for better or worse&quot; route if he IS having physical or <br/>
mental or emotional problems, or whether to do the &quot;I will protect my <br/>
children&quot; route if he&#39;s hostile.<br/>
<br/>
Sure makes me appreciate Keith!!!<br/>
<br/>
Our project today is making orc balls for Marty, for his birthday.<br/>
<br/>
His birthday party is from noon on on Tuesday, his 14-on-the-14th birthday.  <br/>
His plan is to play orc ball, with boffers, and he asked for an orc ball.  <br/>
What he wanted was a fake-fur covered ball.  <br/>
<br/>
I got four playground balls at Toys&#39;R Us and we are decorating them all.<br/>
<br/>
One will be &quot;Wilson goes Hawaiian&quot; (even though it&#39;s not really a &quot;Wilson&quot; <br/>
ball, but a yellow foursquare ball) with a Wilson face and a green wig and a <br/>
plastic little-kid hula skirt.<br/>
<br/>
For one I bought a full-head angry golf-ball mask.  Keith&#39;s gluing that to a <br/>
ball, and we&#39;re going to glue on Holly&#39;s long black witch wig.  That will get <br/>
messed up in no time from dirt and sticks and parts of tumbleweed, but the <br/>
important thing is it will look marvelous when he first pulls it out of the <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
One has a curly rainbow clown wig which fit exactly on half, on a green ball, <br/>
and we put it so the red logo was like a clown nose.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth will have the fake fur he had hoped for.  That will be the &quot;real&quot; <br/>
one, but they&#39;ll all have grabbable parts.  <br/>
<br/>
The game involves some hitting the ball (along the ground) and some grabbing <br/>
it and taking off rugby-style until you&#39;re hit with padded swords until <br/>
you&#39;re &quot;dead&quot; and have to drop it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty made two new boffer swords yesterday and might make two more this <br/>
weekend.  He&#39;ll lend all the kids boffers, and three SCA guys (adults, <br/>
knights) have also been invited, one of whom is his godfather (and grew up <br/>
Catholic, so he actually cares), one of whom has been to at least half of <br/>
Marty&#39;s birthdays and was Keith&#39;s squire years ago, and another who was one <br/>
of my students and knows Marty really well.  He&#39;ll need enough boffers to <br/>
lend them if they&#39;re here for the orc ball games too.<br/>
<br/>
We were using contact cement in the bedroom.  BAD PLAN.  I opened the one <br/>
window we have and put a fan in it, turned off the heater, and went away.  <br/>
I&#39;m going to get a low-temp glue gun to finish my Wilson ball, because I was <br/>
getting sick and felt the brain damage happening.<br/>
<br/>
Keith seems impervious to old meat or brain damage by killer glue.  If food <br/>
doesn&#39;t smell exactly wonderful, I can&#39;t eat it at all.    And after that <br/>
glue today all our food smelled horrible.  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway summary:  <br/>
Keith&#39;s  nice, it&#39;s fun to dress balls up as people&#39;s cartoonish severed <br/>
heads with him, and I hope my friend&#39;s marital emergency doesn&#39;t go too <br/>
horribly.<br/>
