<div id="ygrps-yiv-359278225">Hey Dawn,<br/>
I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be the only person to say this, but don&#39;t be afraid of <br/>
Godzilla. In fact, if a 20-story, fire-breathing reptile could be called <br/>
lovable, he&#39;s it. Granted, he&#39;s not sweet and cow-eyed, like the dinos in <br/>
Land Before Time. But Godzilla is a good guy, summoned out of the sea by the <br/>
Japanese in rapidly dubbed English. Sometimes he is called by a pair of <br/>
sweet-voiced, singing pixies. Then at the end of the movie, there is a long <br/>
battle scene between the big G and a real monster, such as Mothra or Rodan <br/>
(I&#39;m sure I&#39;m spelling them wrong -- this is an aural and visual art).  My <br/>
4yo ds adores Godzilla. He draws him in notebooks all day. We have all his <br/>
movies. Many is the rainy afternoon that Nicky has fallen asleep on the <br/>
couch, lulled by the roars and screeches as the sci-fi behemoth saves the <br/>
world again!<br/>
Fondly,<br/>
Annette<br/>

He was one of my childhood favorites. We&#39;ve always enjoyed the <br/>
Godzilla movies, and my kids all think he&#39;s way cool, even the oldest <br/>
ones (now 26 and 28).<br/>

tech special effects was pretty graphic (Godzilla, PG-13). The<br/>
nearly-at-the-same-time release of a throwback Japanese version (Godzilla<br/>
2000 PG) was pretty much like the original Godzilla.<br/>
<br/>
A very helpful movie site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.screenit.com/">http://www.screenit.com/</a>  They give very<br/>
detailed lists of what is in a movie in reference to the types of things<br/>
people find objectionable. It&#39;s nonjudgemental, just informational. That way<br/>
you can tell kids before hand so they can make informed decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the reviews of the two:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So which version of Godzilla are we talking about here?  We have both the<br/>
original, and the Matthew Broderick one and we have a couple of the other<br/>
olds ones.  Wyndham could tell you which but I sure can&#39;t.  Anyway, I<br/>
like the new one better but we are a bunch of weirdos who like the hokey<br/>
old japanese ones too. Of course that goes along with my fetish for<br/>
cheesy disaster flicks!<br/>
Wyndham has been watching them for several years now.  I think he was<br/>
about 6 when he got hooked, not sure though he might have been younger. <br/>
He watches almost everything and content has not really been an issue. <br/>
He understands Die Hard violence as a movie concept and sex as a people<br/>
thing.  I have a hard time with the N word -   Blazing Saddles - someday<br/>
he is gonna get decked (not by me) but he really does not understand how<br/>
offensive it is no matter how many store clerks try to explain it to him.<br/>
 (We&#39;ve run into several who were quite eloquent and understanding!)<br/>
As for the appropriateness question - try taking a 10 year old to a live<br/>
showing of Rocky Horror!  They weren&#39;t going to let us in.  I had to<br/>
insist.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>:-) Cacie loves that movie, too, I think she&#39;s planning to do a lip sync<br/>
to one of the songs at the home-ed crawdad party next weekend (anyone<br/>
going? Cindy?). Back when napster was worthwhile she downloaded all of<br/>
the songs... She hasn&#39;t been able to see it live because the only place<br/>
near where we used to live was 18+, but my sister knows some of the<br/>
actors here and it&#39;s much more laid-back, so it should work.  We did try<br/>
to recreate the experience when we all watched the video for a friend of<br/>
mine&#39;s birthday, with rice and squirt guns and lighters and all, and the<br/>
kids had fun but it wasn&#39;t quite the same.<br/>
<br/>
We were going to go as Magenta and Columbia for Halloween, but then she<br/>
made a ton of $ at our yard sale and ordered the American Girl<br/>
sock-hopper costume instead.... I was kind of bummed, she already had<br/>
fuchsia hair, it would have been cool...<br/>
