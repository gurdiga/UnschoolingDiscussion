Looking for quotes for a workshop (whole different topic) I went to Google <br/>
and entered &quot;inquiry questions children jewish.&quot;  The second item to appear <br/>
was an article on Jewish Circumcision considerations.  it&#39;s too long to quote <br/>
here, and has a ton of hotlink footnotes, but here&#39;s the beginning and the <br/>
URL is above.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The religious origin of the Jewish practice of circumcision is written in the <br/>
Torah where God promised Abraham,<br/>
I will make you exceedingly fertile, and make nations of you, and kings shall <br/>
come forth from you. . . . I assign the land you sojourn in to you and your <br/>
offspring to come, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting holding. I will <br/>
be their God. . . . Such shall be the covenant between Me and you and your <br/>
offspring to follow which you shall keep: every male among you shall be <br/>
circumcised. (Genesis 17:6,8,10)<br/>
<br/>
Over the centuries there has been much written by Jewish scholars about the <br/>
importance of circumcision. Support for circumcision in the Jewish community <br/>
today is widespread. There is another perspective on circumcision that is not <br/>
openly discussed. Contrary to common belief, circumcision has not always been <br/>
practiced. Moses failed to circumcise his son (Exodus 4:25), and circumcision <br/>
was totally neglected during the forty-year period in the wilderness (Joshua <br/>
5:5). Some Jews in the Hellenistic period (circa 300 b.c.e.-100 c.e.) chose <br/>
not to circumcise their sons in an attempt to gain public acceptance.1 During <br/>
the Reform movement in Germany in the 1840s, some parents did not circumcise <br/>
their sons. Theodor Herzl was one of the most prominent figures who did not <br/>
circumcise his son, who was born in 1891.2 <br/>
<br/>
Currently, circumcision is not universal among Jews either inside or outside <br/>
the United States. The Circumcision Resource Center, a nonprofit educational <br/>
organization, knows of hundreds of Jews in Europe, South America, and in the <br/>
United States who either have not or would not circumcise a son. Even in <br/>
Israel some Jews do not circumcise, and there is an organization that <br/>
publicly opposes circumcision.3 The purpose of this article is to coherently <br/>
explain a few of the contemporary reasons for the increasing doubts some Jews <br/>
have about circumcision. Then I will apply Torah law and Jewish values to <br/>
these reasons.</div>
