<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565044870">The construct of parenting in our culture is different than in other <br/>
cultures. Parenting philosophy does not supercede human rights any <br/>
more than the philosophy of ownership supercedes the human rights of <br/>
slaves. The rights of the individual human reguardless of age, sex, <br/>
religion, nationality, sexual orientation, ability and race are not <br/>
all legally protected rights in America. Agreed. But indeed, these <br/>
rights are not given or conveyed by a society, individuals are born <br/>
with these rights. It is only when another individual supercedes <br/>
these inalienable rights does power over another exist. The actions <br/>
of the second create the existence of power and control by usurping <br/>
the birth rights of humans to freedom of self-determination. <br/>
<br/>
Children are not &quot;property&quot; (a cultural construct) any more than <br/>
black people ever were. It is the action of controling another&#39;s <br/>
freedoms that creates the power dynamic. Power only exists when one <br/>
can or does use it over another&#39;s will. Freedom supercedes power. One <br/>
is born with freedom of self-determination; it is not given or <br/>
released to one. <br/>
<br/>
One is responsible for the consequences of their actions. That is my <br/>
point, it is the act of acting that creates the responsibility to <br/>
another if it impacts or obstucts another&#39;s freedom. One is <br/>
responsible not to impact or obstuct another with your choosen <br/>
actions because their freedom pre-exists your action.<br/>
<br/>
Honoring another&#39;s rights to self-determination assumes that we are <br/>
born with self-determination. Thus, self-determination or freedom can <br/>
only be taken away. You seem to be saying that one is given <br/>
opportunities for self-determination as a gift because parents have <br/>
the power to control. However, I believe this matrix is imposed and <br/>
only created by the parents&#39; choice to act against a child&#39;s will. <br/>
And that the power construct does not exist when the child is not <br/>
forced against his will. I do believe we have a responsibility not to <br/>
force anyone against their will because we have no right to power or <br/>
control over another human being. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the discussion. Perhaps we disagree about one&#39;s innate <br/>
self-determination. Most two year olds I have ever met sure seem to <br/>
have innate self-determination. lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390365053">&lt;&lt;&lt;The construct of parenting in our culture is different than in other <br/>

<br/>
This is interesting. When you say &quot;our culture&quot; do you mean modern Western<br/>
democracies, or just the US, or are you looking smaller than that and mean<br/>
the sub-culture of Unschoolers or respectful parents? Is there only one<br/>
&quot;construct&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;One is responsible for the consequences of their actions. That is my <br/>

actions because their freedom pre-exists your action.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think children have the wider vision to always grasp the<br/>
consequences of their actions. My experience is that much of a young child&#39;s<br/>
behavior is experimental in nature to determine &quot;what happens when I...&quot;<br/>
Some parenting practices hold that ignorance and testing against them.<br/>
Unschooling does not, but we still stop our kids from hurting themselves or<br/>
others, we still keep them safe.<br/>
<br/>
If one of our children behaves in certain ways that are negative or cause<br/>
problems for others *our* (Unschoolers and gentle parents) reactions are<br/>
going to be different than those of &quot;ordinary&quot; parents. This is shown by the<br/>
posts on this list. Children think that what happens in their own home is<br/>
the &quot;norm&quot; and the &quot;right way&quot;, and often get surprised that all families<br/>
don&#39;t do things the same way when they first discover differences. Other<br/>
kids are surprised that Jayn is never punished. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;However, I believe this matrix is imposed and <br/>
only created by the parents&#39; choice to act against a child&#39;s will. <br/>
And that the power construct does not exist when the child is not <br/>
forced against his will. I do believe we have a responsibility not to <br/>
force anyone against their will because we have no right to power or <br/>
control over another human being.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn doesn&#39;t really understand, since she has never lived on the ground<br/>
floor, that the man downstairs is disturbed by her jumping games late at<br/>
night. Sometimes she gets excited and forgets. It is up to me to help her be<br/>
quiet. Sometimes that means I have to tell her she may not jump on the floor<br/>
right now. The principle is Consideration for Others. She gets the benefit<br/>
of that principle also. Sometimes she is deliberately contrary, but I don&#39;t<br/>
get to say &quot;Oh well to heck with my sleeping neighbors&quot;. I have to find ways<br/>
to stop the problem behavior in the short term, and talk about the long term<br/>
also. In this case that is to remind her how much more freedom she has when<br/>
she is awake during the day instead of the night, and how that will be the<br/>
situation again soon.<br/>

Yes, I think sometimes what I hear missing from TCS/NCP or common  preference <br/>
discussions is the idea that autonomy should include that children  *want* to <br/>
treat others as they would like to be treated.<br/>
 <br/>
What I find is that autonomy means that if a child doesn&#39;t want to treat  <br/>
others like they would like to be treated, then that&#39;s perfectly okay.  I  <br/>
suppose that&#39;s a consistent position, considering that it would negate total  <br/>
autonomy if you imposed any kind of principle on children.  But I don&#39;t see  how the <br/>
children can be totally autonomous and self-directing when in fact they  are <br/>
vitally dependent on their parents from birth.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our culture of nuclear family type parenting is one construct of <br/>
interacting with children. Other cultures have extended family <br/>
philosophies of interacting with children. Hunter/gather cultures <br/>
have even broader constructs of interacting with children. Basically <br/>
parenting is a selected or assume way of interacting with children. <br/>
<br/>
There are many ways of interacting with others, some consensual some <br/>
authoritarian, some compromise, etc. Many individuals are interacted <br/>
with as a group, some with decisions made through representation, <br/>
some without, just as the rights of women in our culture has changed <br/>
within the family and outside the family unit. The construct varies <br/>
with each individual involved unless the individuals are treated as a <br/>
group such as by race, sex or by age segregation. Then one&#39;s <br/>
individuality and self-determination is ignored. <br/>
<br/>
Our culture generally has a continuum of ignoring or deciding for <br/>
children without representation, just as women and blacks had ignored <br/>
or limited represenation in the past. Now in many arenas women and <br/>
blacks have the right not to be forced to do things against their <br/>
will. Our culture has choosen to protect these rights legally. <br/>
However, as humans these rights, whether recognized by law or not, <br/>
are inalienable human rights of self-determination. <br/>
<br/>
In consensual living with children these same inalienable human <br/>
rights of self-determination are not obstucted by force reguardless <br/>
of age also. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do agree that there is a fine line between stoping our kids from <br/>
hurting themselves or others and forcing a child to do something <br/>
against his will. Imminent danger assumes those involved act to <br/>
protect life. Protecting life is exactly the opposite of coercion. <br/>
Coercion is a process of destroying one&#39;s ability of self-protection. <br/>
For who else but the individual can know what is best for them?<br/>

best interest does not change the belief or prevent the desire, <br/>
impedes it perhaps. But &quot;a man convinced against his will, is of the <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you choose to find ways to help her to understand the <br/>
consequences of her actions and to redirect her. That is not <br/>
coercion. She has a choice to jump. Unless you sit on her <br/>
indefinitely, of course. You have a choice to explain the possibility <br/>
of being evicted. You could choose to move to the first floor, <br/>
provide other jumping options, go outside, etc. Saying stop and <br/>
making someone stop are not the same.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Indeed&quot; is too strong a word to use for an idea that is itself a <br/>
philosophical construct.  It&#39;s an ideal about humanity created by a subset of humans.  <br/>
There are other, conflicting ideals.  So within the &quot;truth&quot; of your view, the <br/>
others are sickly wrong and inhumane.  But that doesn&#39;t make yours right <br/>
&quot;indeed&quot; except from your own philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
The British Empire had a definition of &quot;savage&quot; for a long time, and <br/>
&quot;primitive,&quot; and it was absolutely true that those people were savage and primitive <br/>
(compared to England, BY ENGLAND&#39;S DEFINITION).    Defining the terms is a <br/>
reality at a philosophical level.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The construct of parenting in our culture is different than in other <br/>
<br/>
cultures.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  I don&#39;t thin there&#39;s a culture on earth nor ever has been <br/>
where the parents have NO responsibility to feed and care for their own <br/>
children, at least the mothers.  And usually there are clear cultural <br/>
responsibilities laid on grandparents, and uncles and aunts, and siblings.  Behavioral, <br/>
financial, religious, physical-needs responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Parenting philosophy does not supercede human rights any <br/>
<br/>
more than the philosophy of ownership supercedes the human rights of <br/>
<br/>
slaves. -=-<br/>
<br/>
To this I can only say that you&#39;re not looking at history or reality, you&#39;re <br/>
looking at wishful-thinking airy-fairy philosophical ideals.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But indeed, these <br/>
<br/>
rights are not given or conveyed by a society, individuals are born <br/>
<br/>
with these rights.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then a culture in which any individual doesn&#39;t have equal rights is <br/>
inherently evil?<br/>
And the response should be...   what?<br/>
<br/>
There has not ever been a culture, large or tiny, where each person has equal <br/>
rights.  The most ideal commune ever attempted (which is now defunct, in <br/>
every case, I&#39;d bet) had a hierarchy.   <br/>
<br/>
If looking at history doesn&#39;t change your mind, look at biology.  Which <br/>
primates are proof that the natural state of man could be total freedom and <br/>
equality?    Or does your model depend upon their  having souls and higher reason?    <br/>
(Which argument declares other primates primitive savages.)<br/>
<br/>
-=- The actions <br/>
<br/>
of the second create the existence of power and control by usurping <br/>
<br/>
the birth rights of humans to freedom of self-determination. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If your kids voted for you to move away and leave the alone, would you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Children are not &quot;property&quot; (a cultural construct) any more than <br/>
<br/>
black people ever were.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cave men turned their caves over to any other people or animals who came by?  <br/>
Or did they have, pre-language, a concept of property or territory?  And the <br/>
idea that all slaves were &quot;black&quot; ignores thousands of years of recorded <br/>
history entirely, doesn&#39;t it?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-One is responsible for the consequences of their actions. That is my <br/>
<br/>
point, it is the act of acting that creates the responsibility to <br/>
<br/>
another if it impacts or obstucts another&#39;s freedom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Children are not responsible for the consquences of their actions.  Not <br/>
legally in most cases (except horrendous premeditated criimes) and not socially or <br/>
emotionally.   Those parents who hold children fully &quot;responsible for the <br/>
consequences of their actions&quot; before the children are old enough to know what <br/>
they were doing when they broke or lost or hurt something are considered ignorant <br/>
and abusive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You seem to be saying that one is given <br/>
<br/>
opportunities for self-determination as a gift because parents have <br/>
<br/>
the power to control. However, I believe this matrix is imposed and <br/>

only created by the parents&#39; choice to act against a child&#39;s will. -=-<br/>

<br/>
*****************************<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ve hit the nail right on the head.  When I try to discuss NCP or our variation of it, people miss this point, and I couldn&#39;t put my finger on what component they were missing.  <br/>
<br/>
Most parenting assumes that children are self centered, etc.  And they are.... developmentally.  But I assume that with maturity and that wider vision, they will want to treat others the same as they&#39;d like to be treated.  Until their maturity takes over, I try to help them see how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still not perfect at it, and my oldest child is mature enough to understand all of this and still chooses sometimes to be annoying to others.  Thats when I say enough is enough.  But then I suppose that is a natural consequence to his being annoying too :o).<br/>

I like the principle of keeping my family intact, and I won&#39;t do or let the <br/>
kids do things that could endanger that.  I don&#39;t want them taken away.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to be in jail or anything that would keep me from being with them, so I <br/>
use that as a primary principal.  I&#39;m stunned when someone will let their <br/>

social services because a parent is protesting a law or something, my insides <br/>
fall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201474121">I do believe that humans are interdependent. It is a cultural myth of <br/>
our age to believe humans are independent. Autonomous and independent <br/>
are not synonymous (that is hard to say.lol). Autonoumous is self-<br/>
directed. Independent is self-dependent. One can be both self-<br/>
directed and interdependent when one lives consensually with others.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that the innate infant/mother relationship is a <br/>
symbiotic one. Harmoniously beneficial to both parties. Because of <br/>
the harmonious nature of consensual living, I do believe that <br/>
children want to remain interdependent. Why would one want to <br/>
separate from a relationship that doesn&#39;t make you do anything you <br/>
don&#39;t want to do?<br/>
<br/>
Interdependence and consensual living are both processes of <br/>
interacting with others, innate processes. The constructs of power <br/>
and independence are *learned* processes of living separately from <br/>
others. The use of power and fear in relationships can not create <br/>
connectivity or love. It is precisely the use of coercion that <br/>
destroys the desire for interdependence. Can one live without <br/>
connectivity or love?<br/>

&gt; discussions is the idea that autonomy should include that children  <br/>
*want* to <br/>
&gt; treat others as they would like to be treated.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What I find is that autonomy means that if a child doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
treat  <br/>
&gt; others like they would like to be treated, then that&#39;s perfectly <br/>
okay.  I  <br/>
&gt; suppose that&#39;s a consistent position, considering that it would <br/>
negate total  <br/>
&gt; autonomy if you imposed any kind of principle on children.  But I <br/>
don&#39;t see  how the <br/>
&gt; children can be totally autonomous and self-directing when in fact <br/>
they  are <br/>
&gt; vitally dependent on their parents from birth.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Other cultures have extended family <br/>
<br/>
philosophies of interacting with children. Hunter/gather cultures <br/>
<br/>
have even broader constructs of interacting with children. Basically <br/>
<br/>
parenting is a selected or assume way of interacting with children. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So ALL adults have power over them? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t really make a general statement about &quot;hunter/gather cultures.&quot;  <br/>
They&#39;re not all the same culture, and there aren&#39;t many of them left anyway, and <br/>
they are by their very nature tiny.  The children know everyone in the group.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Many individuals are interacted <br/>
<br/>
with as a group, some with decisions made through representation, <br/>
<br/>
some without, just as the rights of women in our culture has changed <br/>
<br/>
within the family and outside the family unit. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not clearly written, or else I can&#39;t clearly read it.  But &quot;the rights <br/>
of women in our culture&quot;  have not changed universally within the culture <br/>
(using it as the universe of the moment, for this paragraph), and the failure of <br/>
the equal rights amendment, it&#39;s clear that legally women aren&#39;t equal.   Yes, <br/>
things have changed hugely, but there are still subcultures in which women&#39;s <br/>
rights are curtailed bigtime, and they have to wear dresses and headcoverings. <br/>
 I suppose they have the right to bail out of those families and run away, <br/>
but they would be leaving children and relatives and homes.   Those are all <br/>
&quot;cultural constructs,&quot; but the fact is that every human lives within a culture.  <br/>
Even hermits are described and evaluated in terms of the culture from which <br/>
they remove themselves.  Are they mystics, or nutcases, or harmless hermits or <br/>
crazy vets?  They don&#39;t get to define themselveple are.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The construct varies <br/>
<br/>
with each individual involved unless the individuals are treated as a <br/>
<br/>
group such as by race, sex or by age segregation. Then one&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
individuality and self-determination is ignored. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No child is ignored by everyone.  <br/>
Is his individuality ignored?<br/>
Does he HAVE self-determination?<br/>
Only to the extent someone gives it to him.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to have a stroke. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do illegal Mexican&#39;s along the border of the U.S. have equal rights to <br/>
American citizens?  Should they?   Generally in some ways their kids do, but the <br/>
adults don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, as humans these rights, whether recognized by law or not, <br/>
<br/>
are inalienable human rights of self-determination. -=-<br/>
<br/>
According to what sourse of truth? <br/>
Or proven by what scientific observation?<br/>
<br/>
-=-In consensual living with children these same inalienable human <br/>
<br/>
rights of self-determination are not obstucted by force reguardless <br/>
<br/>
of age also. -=-<br/>
<br/>
BY FORCE!<br/>
Oh, is that all you&#39;re saying?<br/>
Then no problem.  I thought you meant family policy, persuasion, reason.   <br/>
All those bars to inalienable self-determination.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Basically <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If by selected you mean biologically, evolutionary selected than I <br/>
agree. If by selected you mean a mental construct than I can&#39;t agree. <br/>
Parenting is important to the survival of individuals.  If you and <br/>
your partner don&#39;t parent, particularly for hunter-gatherers, your <br/>
children die.  It is so important to have parents that among a few <br/>
cultures (the Ache of Paraguay and the Inuit) that there are such <br/>
things as secondary fathers, that is men who through involvement <br/>
sexually or just as close friends are seen as having some <br/>
responsibility over the welfare and upbringing of the child.  <br/>
However, if things get tough, if food is scarce, the welfare of that <br/>
child remains in the hands of the biological parents.  Those children <br/>
among the Ache who have two parents alive and few extended family are <br/>
much more likely to survive to adulthood than those children who have <br/>
only one parent and a lot of extended family alive.  So, I would <br/>
argue that your picture of the world is wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
Parenting is not a philosophy, it is a requirement.  When the <br/>
philosophy was Rousseau&#39;s, he put all of his children in foundling <br/>
hospitals where they died. He had 5 children that he allowed to <br/>
experience the world in a way that did them chronic and horrible <br/>
damage.  It was not their &quot;right&quot; to be treated with dignity and <br/>
respect.  It was not their &quot;right&quot; to have self-determination.  <br/>

society, individuals are born with these rights&quot; then you seem to be <br/>
arguing that it is biological.  So, one could argue that certain <br/>

bats have the &quot;right&quot; to include mosquitoes in their diets.  But <br/>
those &quot;rights&quot; aren&#39;t protected under any constitution or United <br/>

determined.  The right of self-determination (which I had to look up <br/>
to be sure I understood what I was responding to as it sounds so very <br/>

<br/>
I think I&#39;m getting too convoluted.  What I want to say is that in <br/>
the post today my husband got a letter asking him to confirm his <br/>
voting information.  It said &quot;don&#39;t lose your right to vote&quot;.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have a right to vote in the United Kingdom, because I am a <br/>
resident alien here.  In order to participate in an election this <br/>
year I have to register to vote by absentee ballot.  It is my right <br/>
to do so.  However, it is not a right I was born with.  It is only a <br/>
right I achieved by being a United States citizen who has reached <br/>
(and superseded) the age of majority.  The way I parent my children <br/>
is a choice.  I choose, fully and absolutely, to make their lives as <br/>
happy and stress-free as I can possibly do.  I choose to follow the <br/>
path of an unschooling mother.  I choose to let my son get a mohawk <br/>
and dye his hair purple.  I choose to let my daughter wear the same <br/>
dress day in and day out without being harassed or made to feel <br/>
embarrassed by her choices.  But those are choices I make.  It is not <br/>
the right of my children to experience such things.  It is only <br/>
through my choices and my husbands choices that they are able to <br/>
experience such things at this time in their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Words are important and empowering.  I find it much more empowering <br/>
to understand that it is through my awareness, through my choices, <br/>
through my vigilance that my children have a level of self-<br/>
determination that is far in excess of that which I experienced.  If <br/>
it was their right to do so, than what I did would be determined by <br/>
others. <br/>

ask, but we weren&#39;t surprised, nor did we mind.   It&#39;s his house too, but Keith <br/>
is the one who got up and worked in the yard.  When/if the kids move out, it&#39;s <br/>
our house.  When/if we die, it will be in some part or ways probably theirs.  <br/>
Nothing new, or shocking, but really ancient practice.<br/>

&gt; Nothing new, or shocking, but really ancient practice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
This is just as true with parenting practices. I found out from CPS that slapping a child in <br/>
the face while yelling isn&#39;t child abuse from a legal point of view. Neither is spanking with <br/>
a wooden instrument or hand, requiring a child to stay home 24/7 even if she is a teen, <br/>
restricting access to all forms of entertainment, keeping her out of school against her will, <br/>
requiring her to only wear skirts, no make-up, etc. Yelling at her, shaming her, grounding <br/>
her, punishing her more than her siblings is not child abuse according to the state either.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I bring this up is that our kids are highly conscious of the fact that we have <br/>
chosen to parent as we do but that it is because we have the power to make that decision. <br/>
They can&#39;t require us to treat them fairly (from the way they understand fair). They are our <br/>
kids and according to the state, they must live under the guidelines we believe are best for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
What drew me to mindful parenting (as Sandra calls it) is that I realized that when <br/>
everyone is aware of who has the real power, laying down those rights to control and <br/>
coerce is a powerful expression of love and respect.<br/>
<br/>
But these are choices made by parents who could change the entire scheme of life in one <br/>
fell swoop and not be in violation of the state. Kids know this. It seems disingenuous to <br/>
talk about rights of children if we are extending those rights beyond the rights of parents <br/>
to raise them as they best see fit.<br/>
<br/>
According to the law, children have the right to not be molested or physically beaten so as <br/>
to leave marks. Neglect can also be quantified as abuse of a child&#39;s rights. Beyond that, <br/>
parents have the say. And as unschoolers, I&#39;m glad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How so? If you are forcing someone to stop a behavior that they want <br/>
to continue, even if that behavior would result in death, isnt that <br/>
exactly coercion? And not the &quot;opposite of coercion&quot;? Maybe you need <br/>
to define coercion. I looked up &quot;coerce&quot; in the dictionary and it <br/>
said: 1. To force to act or think in a certain way by use of <br/>
pressure, threats, or intimidation; compel. 2. To dominate, restrain, <br/>
or control forcibly 3. To bring about by force or threat. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you elaborate on what you mean? Maybe with concrete examples? It <br/>
seems in the context of unschooling, when i speak of &quot;noncoercive <br/>
parenting techniques&quot;, i generally mean no forced bedtimes, meals, <br/>
chores etc. I think coercing a child in this context can result in <br/>
things like an unwillingness to freely engage in behaviors (like <br/>
cleaning)if not forced, and an atmosphere of disrespect (child more <br/>
likely to be disrespectful because the parent is), but i dont see how <br/>
it would &quot;destroy one&#39;s ability of self-protection&quot;...not that i <br/>
really understand what you mean by those words. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For who else but the individual can know what is best for them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is very common for individuals (adults and children)to <br/>
make decisions that ultimately are not good (and sometimes very bad)<br/>
for them. Sometimes individuals minds are so clouded by other things <br/>
(like drugs, or a bad relationship, or being &quot;caught up in the <br/>
moment&quot;, or greed, etcetc)that they DONT know whats best for them. An <br/>
example: a family member recently went through a situation in which <br/>
she made legal decisions that will have long term financial <br/>
repercussions (contracts and such)for her. When she was riding the <br/>
&quot;high&quot; she was on (emotional high...we think she may have been going <br/>
thru some kind of manic phase or something) she was SO sure she was <br/>
doing the right thing for herself, we could not talk to her about it, <br/>
she thought she was making the &quot;best&quot; decisions. We felt very <br/>
strongly this would all turn out badly, and a month or two later, <br/>
when the emotional high and the novelty wore off, she realizes (too <br/>
late) she made a mistake. People dont always know whats best for <br/>
them. And thats ok, its ok to make mistakes. But my point is that <br/>
people often DONT know what is best for themselves. That doesnt mean <br/>
we should (or shouldnt)coerce them into making what we think is the <br/>
right decision. But the above statement just isnt factually true. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>==============<br/>
<br/>
Exactly, &quot;civil rights&quot; are civil precisely because they are granted within<br/>
the civil structure, allowed and guaranteed under law. &quot;Rights&quot; only exist<br/>
within the social contract that offers them.  As a term, &quot;rights&quot; is an 18th<br/>
century product of Western Englightenment thinking and a Neoclassical<br/>
interpretation/adoption of Greek city-state ideals. Rights and individual<br/>
autonomy--&quot;all men are created equal&quot; and &quot;right to life, liberty and<br/>
pursuit of happiness&quot; kind of thing--are also products of this 18th century<br/>
kind of thinking. The &quot;individual&quot; is a relatively new thing, historically<br/>
speaking. In my understanding, even in the Western world (I can&#39;t speak of<br/>
other cultures) early religious and dynastic structures had little room for<br/>
the &quot;individual&quot; as s/he came to be described by philosophers like Rousseau<br/>
and which we (in the US, anyway) hold to be &quot;self-evident&quot;. Yet, these<br/>
truths of individual autonomy are self-evident in very limited ways when we<br/>
look a little more closely. All men weren&#39;t, in fact, created equal. Slaves<br/>
could be seen as 3/4 of a person without the glaring self-contradiction that<br/>
we see now. Women and children were chattel. Enlightenment ideals exchanged<br/>
a &quot;might makes right&quot; for a &quot;wealth makes rights&quot; way of doing things.<br/>
<br/>
Rights have become more universal throughout time, but not without major<br/>
civil rights battles. As Sandra pointed out, the Equal Rights Ammendment<br/>
that would have guaranteed women equal rights under the constitution failed<br/>
to be adopted. Just recently, the American government actually considered<br/>
ammending the constitution to explicitly deny the right for gay people to<br/>
marry. Children are still considered chattel for the parents to raise as<br/>
they see fit, as Julie points out. Equal rights and universal autonomy is<br/>
still a myth--even in America.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I find the idea of children&#39;s rights interesting in the context<br/>
of the US and other democracies that pretend to universal ideals of equal<br/>
rights. I find the exclusions pretty interesting--at any given time, what<br/>
group is it okay to exclude from the privilege of universal rights and why.<br/>
Slaves, women, Japanese, children, homosexuals... Deb L&#39;s article in the<br/>
recent Life Learning magazine is particularly poignant in this context. Why<br/>
is a person denied the right to vote one day, but deemed fully capable and<br/>
granted that right the next? What switch gets turned? Why 18 and not 12 or<br/>
16 or 25?<br/>
<br/>
As unschoolers, do we have a deeper sense of democracy and individual<br/>
rights? Or, do we orchestrate benevolent dictatorships like Sandra<br/>
mentioned?<br/>
<br/>
For me, I would say our home functions as a social contract, and this gets<br/>
into the punishment question as well. Rights and autonomy are respected as<br/>
long as individuals are participating in the social contract that makes<br/>
rights and autonomy a mutual thing. So, when there&#39;s a squabble between my<br/>
three (7, 5 and 4), we try to work it out, come up with a common preference,<br/>
but that depends upon everyone&#39;s willingness to listen and work things out.<br/>
If one of them flat out refuses to brainstorm ideas or stop hitting or<br/>
whatever, then that person breeches the social contract with anti-social<br/>
behavior and the responsibility falls on them to remove themselves from the<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if Emily and Julia both want the same Polly Pocket (that<br/>
belongs to both of them) and Emily is willing to brainstorm ways to share,<br/>
alternate, whatever, but Julia refuses to budge, then Julia forfeits her<br/>
right to the Polly Pocket at that moment. Or, if Sam and Emily are<br/>
wrestling, but then Emily wants to stop and Sam keeps jumping on her anyway,<br/>
he gets removed from the room because he could not respect Emily&#39;s right to<br/>
say no. Sam doesn&#39;t get sent to his room or put in a time out; he just gets<br/>
told he needs to find somewhere else to be until he&#39;s ready to respect other<br/>
people. His options might be his room to play, the playroom, my bedroom to<br/>
watch a DVD, the kitchen to bake some bread with me--whatever. For me, the<br/>
point is that respect must be mutual. Just last night Sam followed me into<br/>
my room screaming at me because we were having sorbet and didn&#39;t have ice<br/>
cream. He was exhausted. Didn&#39;t want a bite of my sorbet to see if he liked<br/>
it; nothing was right, basically. So I picked him up and carried him to his<br/>
room, telling him that he couldn&#39;t scream at me in my room, that I had the<br/>
right to be safe and respected in my home. I laid him down in his bed, sat<br/>
next to him, rubbed his forhead and started singing his song to him. He<br/>
stopped screaming, looked at me and said, &quot;That makes me happy mama.&quot; And he<br/>
was asleep in about five minutes. Again, not punished, but clear limits were<br/>
set.<br/>
<br/>
TCS/NCP work as a tool for me that has been really helpful in defusing my<br/>
high need guy, but I&#39;m doubting whether the above scenario would jibe with<br/>
hardcore TCS folks. I&#39;ve seen too many instances where parents in every<br/>
effort to be non-coercive end up being coerced out the whazoo by the child.<br/>
Some might say that&#39;s not really TCS then, but I&#39;ve seen it enough that it<br/>
seems to be a pretty high probability.  For me rights and respect need to be<br/>
mutual. I don&#39;t feel my kids gain anything by learning that they can coerce<br/>
those around them because no one will step in to coerce them out of it. I&#39;m<br/>
much more of a &quot;your right to extend your fist stops at my face&quot; kind of<br/>
person.<br/>

<br/>
James and I spoke to our neighbor below a few months ago, and basically<br/>
asked him how bad our &quot;living life&quot; noise was, and also apologized if he was<br/>
being disturbed. He was very kind and told us what time he usually went to<br/>
bed (really early by my standards), and how he usually slept like a log once<br/>
he got to sleep. The fact that he was so nice and understanding made us want<br/>
to redouble our efforts to be considerate.<br/>

Retaliatory divorce is one of those instances.  Someone gets really <br/>
angry/hurt/embarrassed and divorces as quickly as possible.  When the emotions wear <br/>

share custody of kids, get a job, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
Not all divorces are that way, but I&#39;ve seen a couple fairly recently that <br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
Someone got divorced to spite the spouse, and found herself in a whole heap <br/>
of worse.<br/>
