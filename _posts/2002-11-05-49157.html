LESSONS AT FOUR<br/>
http://home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/196.html<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should you be concerned if your 4-year-old can only do lessons in <br/>
15-minute intervals? Is it as effective to do short lessons <br/>
throughout the day or do you need to have schooling for long <br/>
uninterrupted periods (1-2 hours)?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more concerned about the idea of doing lessons with a 4-year-old <br/>
than I am about his attention span. While there are times a <br/>
4-year-old might be interested in something for 15 minutes, I don&#39;t <br/>
believe it would happen during a planned, <br/>
sit-down-at-the-kitchen-table lesson period. If, during the course of <br/>
the day, something comes up that interests him and you study or <br/>
discuss it together for 15 minutes, I&#39;d say you had a highly <br/>
motivated four-year-old on your hands...<br/>
<br/>
If you want to spend 15 minutes with your 4-year-old, put on a fun CD <br/>
or tape of kids music and dance to it. Make animal noises. Get <br/>
moving and laughing. Read a book together. Talk about the pictures. <br/>
Read it in a funny voice. Act it out together. If he can&#39;t sit still <br/>
with a book, read to him while he plays with his Lego Bricks? Let him <br/>
lead you in a pretend game with his dinosaur toys. Help build a fairy <br/>
house under your tree. Construct a castle in the sandbox. Go to the <br/>
park, swing as high as you can and slide down the slide.<br/>
<br/>
Go for walks and talk about what you see (language). Stop to examine <br/>
small things like spiders or groups of ants (science). Pick up <br/>
colorful leaves and stones (small motor development). See how far you <br/>
can kick a rock down the street (large motor development). See how <br/>
many of your feet you kicked the rock and how many of his (math). <br/>
Read the signs you see along the way (reading, spelling and <br/>
geography). His attention won&#39;t stay on one thing for long. Keep <br/>
moving. When you get home, press your leaves in big books, then make <br/>
collages with them in the winter (art). Make a display of stones <br/>
you&#39;ve collected and count how many you have (math). Use the kitchen <br/>
table only for eating (common sense).<br/>
<br/>
I know parents are eager to start &quot;teaching&quot; their children. (I&#39;ve <br/>
been there.) I&#39;m sorry to tell you it just isn&#39;t necessary, <br/>
especially at age 4. Oh, sure, there&#39;s a large industry perpetuating <br/>
itself on the idea that children need professionals to teach them how <br/>
to survive in the big, bad world. Nonsense. Children need parents who <br/>
follow more than they teach and know how to get out of their <br/>
children&#39;s way so they can get on with the business of growing up.<br/>
<br/>
It will happen fast enough. You don&#39;t want to spend those years doing <br/>
lessons at the kitchen table. ~~excerpt from Ask Carol in the <br/>
November/December issue of Home Education Magazine ~~<br/>

<br/>
GEORGE W.<br/>
<br/>
The Smithsonians National Portrait Gallery is celebrating the legacy <br/>
of our first president with its traveling exhibit, &quot;George <br/>
Washington: A National Treasure.&quot; It centers on the renowned <br/>
&quot;Landsdowne&quot; portrait saved from auction with a generous $30 million <br/>
gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. This exhibit <br/>
demonstrates Washington&#39;s character of patriotism, heroism and <br/>
courage--traits especially important for today&#39;s citizens--as it <br/>
tours eight major cities across the nation.<br/>
<br/>
Portrait Poster and Teaching Guide: Teachers across America can <br/>
request this free kit by internet or phone. It includes a full-color, <br/>
museum quality reproduction of the &quot;Lansdowne&quot; portrait of George <br/>
Washington by Gilbert Stuart and a 30-page teaching guide. The <br/>
comprehensive guide includes lesson plans for grades 2-12 and is <br/>
linked to National History Standards. This guide can be used for <br/>
teaching elementary students, as well as high school history and <br/>
civics classes.<br/>

ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
In addition to editing this newsletter, I write a column for Home <br/>
Education Magazine. Now, I don&#39;t want to take Dear Abby&#39;s place, but <br/>
I will take those thorny questions and problems you struggle with and <br/>
try to give you some options or information that might help you. <br/>
Although I don&#39;t answer the questions in this newsletter (this month <br/>
is an exception), I do answer them in every issue of HEM, the <br/>
original print version where homeschoolers have found support for <br/>
over 20 years. A couple of them are online <br/>
(http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most you have to read in the <br/>
magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>
think your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>
your particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>
procrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>
address: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>
can answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>
send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>
column or not. Don&#39;t wait! (~ CN ~)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One of the cheapest foods to play with (cooking and otherwise): EGGS.<br/>
<br/>
One year I saved egg shells that had broken really cleanly. Washed <br/>
them and saved the two halves together in a milk carton. I filled <br/>
them with little notes and confetti or little toys, and used super <br/>
glue to put them back together. I wouldn&#39;t do that now, I would just <br/>
use Elmer&#39;s on some tissue paper or crepe paper probably. I fear <br/>
super glue.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway.... that wasted no food, and the eggs didn&#39;t have to be <br/>
blown out, and we could break them to get the insides out. That was <br/>
when Marty was little. My kids don&#39;t much care about Easter egg stuff <br/>
any more.<br/>
<br/>
Eggs aren&#39;t very expensive, and so when I&#39;ve had kids want to throw <br/>
one at something (the compost pile corner is good ), I&#39;ve let them. <br/>
Like to throw in the road and see how it looks as it dries or, in the <br/>
summer, cooks. And I&#39;ve told them truly and really never throw eggs <br/>
at a house or a car, because as it dries it messed up the paint badly.<br/>
<br/>
I remember wanting to cook when I was a kid and rarely having the <br/>
ingredients for anything more than maybe peanut butter cookies (which <br/>
I think are gross).<br/>
<br/>
Letting kids use real foods is like getting them good art supplies <br/>
instead of &quot;school supply&quot; quality stuff. Even if a kid wanted to <br/>
experiment with some fairly expensive food, it&#39;s cheaper than bought <br/>
science kits from an educational supply place. ~~ Sandra Dodd posting <br/>

<br/>
INSTANT MUSE<br/>
http://www.webcom.com/wordings/artofwrite/inspiration.html<br/>
<br/>
Now that cool weather is here and we&#39;re spending more time indoors, <br/>
it&#39;s fun to turn to our muses and do some creative writing. Instant <br/>
Muse offers both a story starter and a poetry generator to give your <br/>
muse a jumpstart.<br/>
<br/>
The story starter gives you a list of criteria for your story based <br/>
on the main character&#39;s sex, the main character&#39;s job or profession, <br/>
an archetype, a key object or symbol, setting and a theme. For <br/>
instance, my story starter gave me the following start: &quot;My main <br/>
character/protagonist is a female. My main character is a social <br/>
worker. An archetype present in my story is Cain/Able. A key object <br/>
or symbol in my story is a feather. My story will be set in a train <br/>
station. My story is about mystery.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The poetry generator gives you one line of poetry and you do the <br/>
rest, although the site offers some tips to help ensure success. My <br/>
poetry start was &quot;In the narrows of idleness the soldiers unfold,&quot; <br/>
and it kind of made me think of the laundry languishing in the dryer.<br/>
<br/>
You can send your creations to the Instant Muse contest where you&#39;ll <br/>
have a chance to be included in The Art of Writing e-newsletter. Or <br/>
just do it for fun. (Editor&#39;s note: If you decide to enter your <br/>
poetry in any contest that promises money, first check it out at the <br/>
following website: http://windpub.org/literary.scams . Many poetry <br/>
contests are nothing but scams.)<br/>

WRITING LETTERS TO THE EDITOR<br/>
by Christine Webb and Laura Derrick<br/>
<br/>
Your voice really does count, so don&#39;t be shy when it comes to writing letters!<br/>
<br/>
Writing letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines is an <br/>
important part of keeping homeschooling issues in the public eye. <br/>
Letters to the editor columns are often the most widely read section <br/>
of a newspaper or magazine, and public policy officials usually <br/>
consider them a good barometer of public opinion. You really don&#39;t <br/>
have to be an exceptional writer to get noticed if you speak from the <br/>
heart and focus on expressing yourself clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Here are 6 important tips to get you started:<br/>
<br/>
1.) Be timely - If you are responding to a particular article, <br/>
writing immediately will increase the chances your letter will be <br/>
printed.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Keep it short - Most newspapers limit letters to the editor to <br/>
200-300 words. A brief letter is more likely to be published and less <br/>
likely to be edited. Say what you want, but briefly.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Get to the point - Clearly state your subject and try to make <br/>
just one main point. If you find you have too much to say in two or <br/>
three short paragraphs, consider writing an op-ed (guest editorial) <br/>
piece instead. If you have trouble getting to the point, ask a friend <br/>
for help.<br/>
<br/>
4.) Make it snappy - Use humor, facts, or a personal viewpoint to add <br/>
interest to your letter. Encourage your children to write from their <br/>
points of view as well.<br/>
<br/>
5.) Have it proofread - Nothing makes a worse impression than poorly <br/>
written pieces. Any editor will tell you that having someone else <br/>
proofread your work is much better than doing it yourself. Polish it <br/>
up and then ask a friend to check for grammar or spelling mistakes, <br/>
rambling sentences, unclear points and other writing issues.<br/>
<br/>
6.) Identify yourself - Give your name, address and phone number so <br/>
the newspaper can contact you to check facts or verify that you sent <br/>
the letter.<br/>
<br/>
Find links with more tips for writing to the media, suggestions for <br/>
writing op-ed pieces, and information about writing letters to the <br/>
editor at http://www.nhen.org/main/default.asp?id=76 .<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
BEMBO&#39;S ZOO<br/>
http://www.bemboszoo.com<br/>
<br/>
This is the coolest alphabet site I&#39;ve ever seen. You have to have <br/>
Flash, and it takes forever to load, but it&#39;s worth the wait. Knit or <br/>
eat while it&#39;s loading. The first time you&#39;ll get a cute line of <br/>
alphabet to play with, but that&#39;s not the good part. When you click <br/>
on the letters, which all make real animal noises, the letter will <br/>
transform into a sophisticated artistic rendition of an animal whose <br/>
name starts with that letter. This is truly an amazing abecedary. <br/>
(Note: Go to this website before you show it to your kids, so you can <br/>
play with it first. This is the voice of experience.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
PHILHARMONIC FOR KIDS<br/>
http://www.nyphilkids.org/main.phtml?<br/>
<br/>
Many philharmonics offer special educational programs to <br/>
homeschoolers as well as the public schools. Some will come to your <br/>
group with a variety of programs. Other times they give special <br/>
performances during the day or on weekends that are open to <br/>
homeschoolers. If you&#39;re planning a visit to the philharmonic near <br/>
you, check out this site and help your kids become familiar with what <br/>
they may see and hear there. Sponsored by the New York Philharmonic, <br/>
the site offers a composers gallery, news, an instrument storage <br/>
room, make your own instrument, a composer&#39;s workshop and more. It&#39;s <br/>
not a site with a lot of bells and whistles, but it will make your <br/>
visit more interesting. Even if you&#39;re not planning an evening of <br/>
classical music, this site is worth checking out.<br/>
