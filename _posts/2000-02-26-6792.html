Help With Book?<br/>

Dear Fellow Home Educators,<br/>
<br/>
I have recently contracted to write a mass market paperback book on<br/>
college<br/>
admissions for homeschoolers.  With a survey, we hope to obtain and<br/>
incorporate information from families using diverse approaches to home<br/>
education and from homeschoolers applying to a wide range of colleges -<br/>
2-year institutions, 4-year public and private schools, specialized<br/>
colleges, and so on. I am especially interested in those who wrote (and<br/>
can<br/>
share) their own transcripts, course descriptions, resumes, portfolios,<br/>
student essays, and narratives. We also want to hear from families whose<br/>
homeschoolers tried college, but chose not to continue as well as from<br/>
families who adult children chose a route OTHER than college. We are<br/>
also<br/>
hoping for ethnic, religious, and geographic diversity. We want to hear<br/>
from<br/>
home educators worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
If you took part in the survey I did in the fall of 2000 for a book on<br/>
homeschooling teenagers, know that THIS survey is only about one-third<br/>
as<br/>
long. (By the way, in case you are wondering, Prima Publishing plans to<br/>
release my book, Homeschooling: The Teen Years in May, 2001. If that<br/>
date<br/>
holds up, free copies for contributors should arrive shortly<br/>
thereafter.)<br/>
<br/>
I have two email surveys: (1) one for parents whose homeschooled<br/>
children<br/>
have applied to college and (2) one for their children -- former<br/>
homeschoolers who now attend college or chose an alternative like work,<br/>
apprenticeships, volunteering, military, etc. The parent survey will<br/>
probably take 60-90 minutes to complete. The teen survey is much shorter<br/>
-<br/>
about 10 questions, figure 10-25 minutes. Respondents&#39; anonymity will be<br/>
protected in the final publication.<br/>
<br/>
My publisher has guaranteed the first 60 survey respondents a FREE COPY<br/>
OF<br/>
THE PUBLISHED BOOK, which will cover all aspects of college admissions<br/>
for<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: ONLY request a survey if you have gone through the college<br/>
application<br/>
process with a homeschooler OR if you have one or more adult<br/>
homeschoolers<br/>
who opted out of college. Do not request a survey if your teenage<br/>
homeschooler is simply taking college courses concurrent with high<br/>
school<br/>
homeschooling. If you have a question about this, please write and ask!<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in receiving the survey - and if you have the time<br/>
to<br/>
complete the it IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS -- please email me with the word<br/>
&quot;SURVEY&quot; in the subject line of your email.  If your homeschool graduate<br/>
would consider completing the Homeschool Graduate Survey, please have<br/>
that<br/>
graduate send me a separate e-mail with &quot;GRADUATE SURVEY&quot; in the subject<br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
I will email you the survey immediately and await your response. Thanks<br/>
so<br/>
much for considering contributing to this project!  Please feel free to<br/>
re-post this note to mailing lists, bulletin boards, private email to<br/>
friends and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
