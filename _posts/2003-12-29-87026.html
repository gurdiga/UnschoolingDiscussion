<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167216747">&quot;I think I read in one of the John Holt books Teach Your Own maybe that <br/>
schools teach as they do so children turn out to be blue collar workers or just<br/>
 <br/>
workers.  Something like that........<br/>
Laura&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would think factory type work would be more along the lines of what schools train people for, that, or prison!:)<br/>
<br/>
A lot of bluecollar workers are very FREE with their lives, my dh included. He went from management to bluecollar work in order to reclaim his life and his time.  We run our own company and it&#39;s been a fantastic learning experience, plus our family spends a lot of time together. Many of the bluecollar workers down here are able to set their own hours and have the flexibility and freedom other folks don&#39;t enjoy. &#39;Course I&#39;m thinking of small business owners, not the guys that work for minimum wage for other folks, which must be rough.<br/>

<br/>
One of the closest, most loving families I know is my husband&#39;s uncle&#39;s <br/>
family, and he was an assembly-line worker for Ford up in Detroit for his entire <br/>
career, as is his son now.  The regular hours and guaranteed income were ideal <br/>
for the stability of their lifestyle, and they had regular vacations at an <br/>
upstate cabin, had a boat, the works.  All very middle-class, nothing <br/>
high-falutin&#39;, but it was good.  I&#39;ve never known such an idyllic family (although they <br/>
certainly had their problems, just like anyone else).<br/>
<br/>
I always thought that the work must have been mind-numbing for the uncle, but <br/>
the quality of his family life was so high that I figure it must have been <br/>
worth it.<br/>
<br/>
There have been times, as we have struggled to find a stable financial place <br/>
in the world, where I have envied him his humdrum, mind-numbing choice of a <br/>
blue collar factory job.  :-)<br/>

The best job I ever had for providing me the ability to think was the most <br/>
boring and routine.  So I could do what I was doing and think about other things <br/>
without any possibility of screwing up.  It was a job without words, so words <br/>
and ideas could flow without conflict.  It was taking dishes off trays in the <br/>
college dining hall.  Each of us on that line had one type of dish to remove, <br/>
rinse, and put in the trays for the dishwashing machine.   If I was doing <br/>
plates, I scanned for plates, rinsed and lined them up until the rack was full, <br/>
at which point I scooted that over and started another rack.  It was WONDERFUL. <br/>
 There was warm running water in a stainless steel channel I would hold my <br/>
hands in during lulls, the room was so loud we couldn&#39;t carry on conversations <br/>
anyway, and it was like being alone in a meditative state.<br/>

My favorite job was the one I owned. It was wild. I loved the product, the <br/>
customers, the UPS and Fed Ex guys, packaging boxes, ordering, working on my <br/>
site, adding new products and thinking of new ideas all the time. When the little <br/>
ones get older I would like to come up with another idea that takes off as <br/>
that one did.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest Dustin knew how to run things as well as I. If someday he decides <br/>
to open his own business I hope he has as much fun as I did.<br/>

*************************************************************<br/>
I sold children&#39;s toys online. Products from Kettler, Radio Flyer, Big Belly <br/>
Banks, Peg Perego etc...  <br/>
I opened at the perfect time for a toy biz on the net and offered free <br/>
shipping. I miss it but would never be able to keep it going with 3 little ones. <br/>
 Cassidy was conceived and born during the creation of the business and I <br/>
later nursed while I spoke to customers. Later she shipped a bottle of milk to a <br/>
lady in WA. Luckily she had a child and understood.<br/>
Knowing what I know now and that I can have fun and make money it is very <br/>
hard for me to work for someone else.<br/>
