I think you would need to get permission from those people before putting<br/>
their info up on the internet.<br/>

I tried to send this message directly to you but I got a message saying it<br/>
had been rejected - so I am sending it to the list.  I guess that gives us<br/>
the opportunity for others insights as well.<br/>

&gt; Marc,<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the note.  GWS was really a great mag.  It was started by John<br/>
&gt; Holt.  I miss it so!<br/>
&gt; I really like the idea of having a database for connecting with others.<br/>
&gt; Logistically there are a couple of problems.  I don&#39;t have a FAX, and<br/>
since<br/>
&gt; the directory is SO long (17 pages) I can&#39;t afford to run to my local copy<br/>
&gt; shop and FAX it to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other aspect that concerns me is posting all of this information on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; internet.  Email addresses are one thing, but personal addresses, names of<br/>
&gt; everyone in the family and DOB&#39;s for the kids seems like something that<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; of these people might not have been volunteering for.  The listings<br/>
include<br/>
&gt; all of that information.  What is your take on this?  (I think I would not<br/>
&gt; be comfortable having all of that info posted about myself on the<br/>
internet.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It sounds like you are very familiar with how YahooGroups work, with<br/>
&gt; databases and all of that - so maybe there are security features, etc.,<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; would work.  Let me know what you think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I appreciate your willingness to help unschoolers everywhere and the<br/>
&gt; generosity of this offer.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Deborah<br/>
