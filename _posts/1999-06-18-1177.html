Statement<br/>
<br/>
In early spring of 1994, after having published Gentle Spirit Magazine for<br/>
five years, I experienced a crisis in my marriage which resulted  eventually<br/>
in its dissolution.  My ex-husband had moved to another state,  and I had met<br/>
the man who is now my husband, Rick Seelhoff.   At the time, I was a member<br/>
of Calvary Chapel of Tacoma. I asked to meet privately with  my then-pastor<br/>
and his wife, Joe and Irene Williams, in April of 1994, for  confession and<br/>
spiritual counsel.  The pastor and his wife assured me they would keep my<br/>
family situation confidential.  After I met with them, I stopped attending<br/>
their church and never attended their church again.<br/>
<br/>
Months after I last attended church services at Calvary Chapel of Tacoma,  in<br/>
the days shortly before and just after my last public speaking  engagement at<br/>
the CHEO convention in Ohio, Pastor Williams and his wife received phone<br/>
calls from several leaders in the national conservative  Christian<br/>
homeschooling community, asking  for detailed, intimate information about my<br/>
personal life.  Pastor Williams and his wife provided that information.<br/>
Among the leaders who called requesting personal information about me were<br/>
Gregg Harris, Sue Welch, and the then-chair of CHEO, Michael Boutot.  I knew<br/>
these homeschooling leaders only very casually, in some cases, or not at all.<br/>
 None was my mentor in publishing or had been involved with the publication<br/>
of  my magazine.  I  had no idea any of these leaders had been made aware of<br/>
my family circumstances or that  they were conducting any kind of<br/>
investigation of me.  None of these leaders  attended any Calvary Chapel<br/>
church, let alone my own church.  Gentle Spirit was not a nonprofit,<br/>
religious organization,  but a for-profit, private, family business concern.<br/>
<br/>
After the Williams spoke with these leaders, calls were placed to other<br/>
prominent persons in the Christian homeschooling  community.   A decision was<br/>
made among some of these leaders that I be presented with a list of<br/>
ultimatums, which they called, &quot;proofs of repentance,&quot;  or have intimate<br/>
details of my personal life disclosed nationally and publicly.  The &quot;proofs<br/>
of  repentance&quot; I was to perform included not answering my telephone, turning<br/>
over the contents  of my business and personal bank accounts to others, not<br/>
having a post office box, never going anywhere alone, stepping down from my<br/>
position as  Editor and Publisher of Gentle Spirit, agreeing not to speak<br/>
publicly,  agreeing  not to defend myself, firing my attorneys, withdrawing<br/>
restraining orders I had obtained to protect my family and business, and<br/>
replacing Gentle Spirit with Teaching Home Magazine.  At the time, I was the<br/>
sole support of my family of 11 people, and Gentle Spirit Magazine provided<br/>
all of our family&#39;s income.<br/>
<br/>
When I failed to comply with the &quot;proofs of repentance,&quot;  the Williams<br/>
drafted a &quot;letter of discipline.&quot;  They discussed the contents of the  letter<br/>
of discipline with Sue Welch and Michael Farris of HSLDA.   The letter<br/>
stated, among other things, that I was guilty of unrepentant adultery with<br/>
lying, because I said I was repentant although I continued my relationship<br/>
with Rick, whom I married in 1995.  They read this letter of discipline<br/>
publicly, against my will, at a Sunday morning church service months after I<br/>
had last attended the church. The pastor&#39;s wife, Irene Williams, read the<br/>
letter of discipline over  the telephone to Sue Welch, Editor of Teaching<br/>
Home Magazine, who  audiotaped the reading of the letter. Ms. Welch then<br/>
asked the Williams to write a letter to her requesting her help in<br/>
disseminating the contents of  the letter of church discipline to leaders in<br/>
the homeschooling community.  Ms Welch also offered to the Williams the<br/>
services of her attorney,  Michael Farris, who spoke with the Williams<br/>
several times by phone.  The  Williams provided the letter Sue Welch<br/>
requested, along with a copy of the  letter of discipline, and Sue Welch then<br/>
faxed and otherwise circulated  the letter of discipline to the chairpersons<br/>
of more than 43 state  homeschooling organizations as well as many other<br/>
leaders, publishers,  business persons,  and others in the homeschooling<br/>
marketplace.  The  information was circulated over a number of months by<br/>
facsimile, regular  mail, telephone, and via the internet.    In early 1995,<br/>
an &quot;update&quot; was  provided in a newsletter sent out by Teaching Home staff to<br/>
all state  homeschooling leaders.  Another magazine publisher, Mary Pride,<br/>
whom I  had never personally met and with whom I had never done business,<br/>
also paid a member of her staff to investigate my situation.  This staff<br/>
member contacted the Williams, Sue Welch, and others and asked intimate<br/>
questions about my personal life.   Gregg Harris also participated in the<br/>
early investigation  of my family&#39;s crisis, discussing my personal life with<br/>
my ex-husband, the  Williams, and Sue Welch.  I did not become aware of  Ms.<br/>
Welch&#39;s , Mr.  Farris&#39;s, Mr. Harris&#39;s, Mary Pride&#39;s, Michael Farris&#39;s,  or<br/>
other leaders&#39;  actions, in some instances, until  years  after the fact.<br/>
<br/>
In the wake of the circulation of this information, I began  receiving<br/>
letters from subscribers, columnists and advertisers who  canceled their<br/>
subscriptions, resigned as columnists or canceled their  advertisements.<br/>
Some of these people demanded refunds.  Several different  homeschooling<br/>
publications ran articles disclosing the contents of the Williams&#39; letter of<br/>
discipline and other facts, some true, some untrue.   Ms Welch reimbursed the<br/>
pastor and his wife for the costs of the many telephone calls they received<br/>
which resulted from the circulation of this letter.  As  the mother of nine<br/>
and sole provider for my family via Gentle Spirit, these actions were<br/>
devastating to me.<br/>
<br/>
I subsequently attempted to do what I could to fulfill my obligations to<br/>
subscribers.  I mailed refunds, sent out back issues, at one point  attempted<br/>
to publish Gentle Spirit in an e-mail loop, and finally I  established a<br/>
website.  At each turn I was met with intense opposition, as long as three<br/>
years after the fact,  so that I could not continue.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I despaired of ever being able to fulfill my obligations to<br/>
subscribers or to lead a normal life absent legal action.  At that point I<br/>
filed suit in Federal Court for the Western District of Washington against<br/>
several defendants:  Calvary Chapel of Tacoma, Joe and Irene Williams,<br/>
Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa, The Teaching Home and Sue Welch, Gregg  Harris,<br/>
Christian Home Educators of Ohio and its then-chairperson, and  Bill and Mary<br/>
Pride, alleging a number of causes of action, among them defamation, slander,<br/>
outrage, interference with commerce, and violation of  the Sherman Antitrust<br/>
Act of the United States.   We settled our claims  with Gregg Harris, Calvary<br/>
Chapel of Costa Mesa, CHEO, and the Prides  before trial for amounts which we<br/>
agreed to keep confidential.  We did go to trial with Sue Welch, and after<br/>
eight days of trial, a unanimous jury found that Sue Welch and the Williams<br/>
had entered into an illegal conspiracy to restrain trade in  violation of the<br/>
Sherman Antitrust Act.  The jury found that I had been  damaged in the amount<br/>
of $435,000.  Because damages awards in antitrust actions are automatically<br/>
trebled, I was entitled to receive in excess of  1.3 million dollars from Sue<br/>
Welch.  In addition, I was entitled to  recover my attorneys&#39; fees and costs.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequent to the jury verdict, we settled our claims with Sue Welch for  an<br/>
amount which we have agreed not to disclose.<br/>
<br/>
We then proceeded to trial in one remaining cause of action, interference<br/>
with commerce.  The sole defendants by this time were the Williams and<br/>
Calvary Chapel of Tacoma.  Prior to trial, we settled with these remaining<br/>
defendants as well,  so that all of our claims against all of the  defendants<br/>
have now been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
This information and the lawsuit are a matter of public record in Pierce<br/>
County Superior Court  at Tacoma and in the US District Court for the Western<br/>
District of  Washington at Tacoma.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434331401">That horrific tale is an example of one of the very valid reasons that we<br/>
(my family) demure from attending organized religious servies or being part<br/>
of a church organization.  When you seek validation from such, I feel you<br/>
are also inviting judgement and manipulation of your personal life and<br/>
beliefs.  Frankly, who needs it?  <br/>
<br/>
Now don&#39;t get all upset folks, as I know many of you DO attend church and<br/>
are members of various congregations and that it works for you.  If you are<br/>
happy there, I am happy for you.  What is important is to not let anyone<br/>
dictate your beliefs or your lifestyle, or to judge you or manipulate you.<br/>
We personally find more reasons to stay away than to join in.  I find our<br/>
faith is better served at home, in private, in our hearts, minds and souls.<br/>
 Amen to that.<br/>
