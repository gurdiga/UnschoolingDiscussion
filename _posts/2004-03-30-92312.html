<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175969229">I forgot to remind those who havne&#39;t been following the Tale of Kirby <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that he was a furious kind of explosive games player when he was <br/>
&gt;little.  Games had to played EXACTLY RIGHT and it was best if Kirby <br/>
&gt;won.  Video games needed to go well within his window of patience, or <br/>
&gt;that controller was going to be sorry. He did NOT accept variance.  He <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t like furniture rearranged.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was just pondering this aspect of Isabel&#39;s personality, her need to<br/>
win at all costs.  Not really sure how to handle it sometimes.  She<br/>
cries and throws a fit when she doesn&#39;t win.  She will also cheat the<br/>
rules in order to win.  Don&#39;t want to lecture and am not sure what to<br/>
do, i.e. stop playing, explain that in every game someone wins and<br/>
someone loses, etc.  What did others do in this case?  What did you do<br/>
Sandra when Kirby lost and beat on the controller?  Just let him do it<br/>
or talk to him about it?  Do I just wait until she grows out of it?  Any<br/>
advice would be appreciated.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;  Don&#39;t want to lecture and am not sure what to<br/>

<br/>
There are games where winning isn&#39;t quite the &quot;winning&quot; it is with a very <br/>
competitive game.  There&#39;s a whole cooperative-games company (maybe more than <br/>
one).<br/>
<br/>
One thing we did sometimes was to play from the beginning so that one person <br/>
would win.  &quot;Let&#39;s let Holly win&quot; and then all moves would be made with that <br/>
goal in mind.  It doesn&#39;t make the game easier or harder, just different.<br/>
<br/>
There were times I said &quot;Kirby, it&#39;s not fun to play with you when you&#39;re not <br/>
willing to possibly lose.&quot;  I wish I&#39;d thought of something better to do, but <br/>
I didn&#39;t, and the other two kids weren&#39;t that way.<br/>
<br/>
He DID get over it, though!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What did you do<br/>
Sandra when Kirby lost and beat on the controller?  Just let him do it<br/>
or talk to him about it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Disarmed him of the controller.<br/>
<br/>
He would just throw it as hard as he could.<br/>
<br/>
We talked to him about taking deep calming breaths, about running to get his <br/>
adrenaline out, or playing with the dog, instead of throwing things he really <br/>
did not want to break.   We talked about him getting up and stretching or <br/>
going to get a drink or a snack when he was getting frustrated, and NOT ever under <br/>
any circumstances to try to hold his breath until he won a game. &lt;g&gt;  (That <br/>
can be done pretty easily and humorously, and it seemed to be the cause of the <br/>
blow-up, is that he&#39;d been tensely NOT breathing.)<br/>
<br/>
Other people checking in on him, bringing him snacks, just asking him a <br/>
question would help break the tense-spell too, and we learned to do that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do I just wait until she grows out of it?  Any<br/>
advice would be appreciated.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t JUST wait.  I&#39;d try a combination of coping tools and waiting.  It <br/>
takes both, I think.<br/>
<br/>
For Kirby, I&#39;m sure karate itself helped.  Does she have any interest in <br/>
martial arts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How old is Isabel?<br/>
<br/>
Ross also used to have a fit when he lost.  Would get very upset. Would <br/>
quit or throw parts of the game around if he felt he was going to lose. I <br/>
usually let him win without his knowing what I was doing.  I think he was <br/>
about 10 years old when he began to be able to accept the idea that <br/>
sometimes he would lose.  It wasn&#39;t until age 13-14 that he was mostly <br/>
comfortable with losing, though, he still much prefers to win.<br/>
<br/>
When he lost on a computer game and get angry, we suggested a change of <br/>
activity, and often would read aloud to him, which he always found calming.<br/>
<br/>
He also used to throw things when he got angry, but now, goes to his room <br/>
until he calms down.<br/>
<br/>
Kids do mature and learn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ross wanted to break things when he was mad.  We talked this over with Ross <br/>
seeking an acceptable  way of venting.  Finally, we bought cheap cups and <br/>
mugs at tag sales and had a stash of them in the garage.  When he was <br/>
explosively mad, he would go out and throw them against the outside garage <br/>
wall.  This worried my sister who was sure Ross would never learn to <br/>
control his anger.  However, it only lasted for a year or two.  Our goal <br/>
was to create a safe outlet for his explosive anger.<br/>
<br/>
We talked a lot about anger and how to deal with it.  We tried various <br/>
strategies at different times.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Karate has also been a huge help to Ross.  It channelled his aggressive <br/>
energy and focused it in class, not out of class.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve also watched as Fisher has struggled with frustration, too, <br/>
though he doesn&#39;t throw the controller.  I&#39;ve noticed that if I <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;over-parent&quot; -- jump in and try to help, tell him it&#39;s okay, <br/>
tell him to calm down -- his &quot;tantrum&quot; (crying, wailing, jumping <br/>
around) is actually him processing and taking the time to think how <br/>
he wants to approach the problem.  If I stay out of it at the crucial <br/>
moment, after a few minutes he will often sigh and say something <br/>
like, &quot;It&#39;s okay if I lose,&quot; or &quot;Oh, I should try xyz.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still give him lots of support -- snacks and listening and looking <br/>
up tips and walk-throughs for him.  I let him know if he wants my <br/>
help at those meltdown moments, I will help.  But I&#39;m learning when <br/>
to get out of the way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have this situation as well.  Before I play a competitive game <br/>
with him, I check in:  &quot;Will you be okay if you lose this one?  Or <br/>
should we play so you win?&quot;  I also make sure there are snacks and <br/>
drinks. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve really come to respect this kind of frustration as a child&#39;s <br/>
struggle for mastery -- including mastery of his or her own <br/>
frustration.  <br/>
<br/>
