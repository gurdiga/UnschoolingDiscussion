<div id="ygrps-yiv-964852959">From a discussion elsewhere:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Rachael may help you feel better about forcing your daughter to  <br/>
brush her teeth, but her words won&#39;t help you find something that  <br/>
improves your relationship with your daughter and helps keep her teeth  <br/>
clean. But first you need to knock down the defensive walls. Rachael&#39;s  <br/>
words are helping you maintain them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
At the Radical Unschoolers Network site there&#39;s a discussion that&#39;s  <br/>
very confusing to follow, but Joyce made something clear that we&#39;ve  <br/>
danced around for years:  Why &quot;support&quot; can be so harmful.<br/>
<br/>
A dad is flailing, his daughter is four, he hates Barbies dolls, he  <br/>
forces her to brush her teeth, and he&#39;s proud of that.   Another mom  <br/>
came and totally defended him, directly and personally, and accused us  <br/>
all (mostly me &lt;g&gt;) of terrible things...   But after all the  <br/>
discussion about time wasting and arrogance (ours, theirs), Joyce  <br/>
nailed it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-[A &quot;supportive&quot; person] may help you feel better about forcing your  <br/>
daughter to brush her teeth, but her words won&#39;t help you find  <br/>
something that improves your relationship with your daughter and helps  <br/>
keep her teeth clean. But first you need to knock down the defensive  <br/>
walls. [&quot;Supportive&quot;] words are helping you maintain them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s supporting him staying where he is.  She&#39;s supporting him being  <br/>
openly and publicly disdainful of unschooling and unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Sylvia Toyama has been on a glorious roll in there too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Joyce has invested many hours into that discussion and it shows! <br/>
She&#39;s said some pretty amazing stuff in there!  Yet there is another<br/>
person there advocating staying in that comfort zone and supporting all<br/>
those ideas that won&#39;t help move someone towards unschooling, simply<br/>
because she wants everyone to be nicey nice.<br/>

I know!  I&#39;m super impressed with what she&#39;s been saying!  The fact that<br/>
the guy is actually kind of listening to her is really really cool!  <br/>
He&#39;s getting all upset and defensive, but he&#39;s listening to her!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063876962">Alright, you guys got me over there and I&#39;ve been reading the threads at the<br/>
Family RUN.ning site! <br/>
 <br/>
I agree with Frank, the guy is a Troll and probably should have taken a more<br/>
friendly tone from the beginning and for sure should be just READING now. I<br/>
think people get attached to their posts and need to defend it over and over<br/>
and that defeats the purpose of the group. Rachael needs to stop posting too<br/>
and read more. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m fairly new to unschooling too, but I don&#39;t see how asking unschoolers<br/>
how often things go wrong, when we&#39;ve lost it, if we&#39;ve ever doubted this<br/>
path, or what limits we impose really helps ANYONE who is on the path of<br/>
radical unschooling (the whole purpose of that site) or at least who wants<br/>
to be/stay on it.<br/>
 <br/>
Sure, I&#39;ve had moments I&#39;m not so proud of, where I wished I could have been<br/>
calmer with my son or done things differently. But I don&#39;t need to share<br/>
them with others or dwell on them! Now that I think about it, those moments<br/>
are fewer and farther between than they used to be, before I was really<br/>
making an effort towards the radicalness of unschooling (and I was already<br/>
into AP since becoming a mother, am still cosleeping with and occasionally<br/>
nursing my almost 5yo, so I&#39;m no stranger to an alternate lifestyle!). I<br/>
don&#39;t need affirmation that RU is hard. I only share my problems or tough<br/>
moments when I&#39;m truely at a loss for what I could have done differently<br/>
because I just can&#39;t seem to think of another way on my own, I&#39;m too close<br/>
to it. Others who are not attached to my situation can often see more<br/>
clearly and offer great solutions or ideas that have worked for them, that<br/>
may or may not work for me, and I am grateful for all of them. Some ideas<br/>
sit in my head and maybe don&#39;t work now, but do work further down the road! <br/>
 <br/>
What really helps me is when people share the moments where RU DOES work. It<br/>
may sound strange to a newbie (as I was a year ago!) but it helps a great<br/>
deal to carry around in my head happy thoughts and images of what other<br/>
parents are doing out there or have done that portray a happy life with<br/>
their children. (Going to a conference helps a ton! You get to SEE it in<br/>
person!) If you are always thinking of ways to make things more positive,<br/>
you WILL.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t see how going around with images of how many other parents are<br/>
yelling at, grabbing too hard, shaming, or generally controlling their<br/>
children would be helpful. It might give one a false sense of support, just<br/>
knowing that they are not the only ones out there who mess up and can&#39;t seem<br/>
to parent the way they want to. If you are always thinking of how it&#39;s OK to<br/>
mess up because so many other parents are also messing up, you will mess up<br/>
more and more and think it&#39;s OK because you&#39;re not the only one. That&#39;s not<br/>
going to get you where you want to be! (Unless you really want to be<br/>
miserable and have unhappy kids. But I don&#39;t think anyone on a list or group<br/>
for RU really wants that, they just don&#39;t know how else to be.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand it. Some people see criticism of their ideas: &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
not good,&quot; as criticism of them: &quot;You&#39;re not good. You&#39;re not  <br/>
perfect.&quot; That&#39;s why he (and Rachael and Andy) have made sarcastic  <br/>
remarks about not being perfect like other people supposedly are.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately there&#39;s no quick cure ;-) You can&#39;t tell them to get  <br/>
over it because it feels like more criticism ;-)<br/>
