Goodbye, Dr. Spock, by Anna Quindlen<br/>
<br/>
If not for the photographs, I might<br/>
have a hard time believing they ever existed. The pensive infant with the<br/>
swipe of dark bangs and the black button eyes of a Raggedy Andy doll. The<br/>
placid baby with the yellow ringlets and the high piping voice. The sturdy<br/>
toddler with the lower lip that curled into an apostrophe above her chin.<br/>
ALL MY BABIES are gone now.<br/>
<br/>
I say this not in sorrow but in disbelief. I take great satisfaction in what<br/>
I have today: three almost-adults, two taller than I am, one closing in<br/>
fast. Three people who read the same books I do and have learned not to be<br/>
afraid of disagreeing with me in their opinion of them, who sometimes tell<br/>
vulgar jokes that make me laugh until I choke and cry, who need razor blades<br/>
and shower gel and privacy, who want to keep their doors closed more than I<br/>
like. Who, miraculously, go to the bathroom, zip up their jackets and move<br/>
food from plate to mouth all by themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Like the trick soap I bought for the bathroom with a rubber duckie at its<br/>
center, the baby is buried deep within each, barely discernible except<br/>
through the unreliable haze of the past.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in all the books I once pored over is finished for me now.<br/>
Penelope Leach. T. Berry Brazelton. Dr. Spock. The ones on sibling rivalry<br/>
and sleeping through the night and early-childhood education, all grown<br/>
obsolete. Along with Goodnight Moon and Where the Wild Things Are, they are<br/>
battered, spotted, well used.<br/>
<br/>
But I suspect that if you flipped the pages dust would rise like memories.<br/>
<br/>
What those books taught me, finally, and what the women on the playground<br/>
taught me, and the well-meaning relations -- what they taught me was that<br/>
they couldn&#39;t really teach me very much at all. Raising children is<br/>
presented at first as a true-false test, then becomes multiple choice, until<br/>
finally, far along, you realize that it is an endless essay. No one knows<br/>
anything. One child responds well to positive reinforcement, another can be<br/>
managed only with a stern voice and a timeout. One boy is toilet trained at<br/>
3, his brother at 2. When my first child was born, parents were told to put<br/>
baby to bed on his belly so that he would not choke on his own spit-up. By<br/>
the time my last arrived, babies were put down on their backs because of<br/>
research on sudden infant death syndrome. To a new parent this ever-shifting<br/>
certainty is terrifying, and then soothing. Eventually you must learn to<br/>
trust yourself. Eventually the research will follow.<br/>
<br/>
First science said environment was the great shaper of human nature. But it<br/>
certainly seemed as though those babies had distinct personalities, some<br/>
contemplative, some gregarious, some crabby. And eventually science said<br/>
that was right, and that they were hard-wired exactly as we had suspected.<br/>
<br/>
Still, the temptation to defer to the experts was huge. The literate parent,<br/>
who approaches everything; cooking, decorating, life as though there were a<br/>
paper due or an exam scheduled, is in particular peril when the kids arrive.<br/>
<br/>
How silly it all seems now, the obsessing about language acquisition and<br/>
physical milestones, the riding the waves of normal, gifted, hyperactive,<br/>
all those labels that reduced individuality to a series of cubbyholes. But I<br/>
could not help myself. I had watched my mother casually raise five children<br/>
born over 10 years, but by watching her I intuitively knew that I was<br/>
engaged in the greatest and potentially most catastrophic task of my life. I<br/>
knew that there were mothers who had worried with good reason, that there<br/>
were children who would have great challenges to meet. We were lucky; ours<br/>
were not among them.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing horrible or astonishing happened: there was hernia surgery, some<br/>
stitches, a broken arm and a fuchsia cast to go with it. Mostly ours were<br/>
the ordinary everyday terrors and miracles of raising a child, and our<br/>
children&#39;s challenges the old familiar ones of learning to live as<br/>
themselves in the world. The trick was to get past my fears, my ego and my<br/>
inadequacies to help them do that.<br/>
<br/>
I remember 15 years ago poring over one of Dr. Brazelton&#39;s wonderful books<br/>
on child development, in which he describes three different sorts of<br/>
infants: average, quiet, and active. I was looking for a sub- quiet codicil<br/>
for an 18-month-old who did not walk. Was there something wrong with his fat<br/>
little legs? Was there something wrong with his tiny little mind? Was he<br/>
developmentally delayed, physically challenged? Was I insane? Last year he<br/>
went to China. Next year he goes to college. He can talk just fine. He can<br/>
walk, too.<br/>
<br/>
Every part of raising children is humbling, too. Believe me, mistakes were<br/>
made. They have all been enshrined in the Remember-When-Mom-Did Hall of<br/>
Fame. The outbursts, the temper tantrums, the bad language, mine, not<br/>
theirs. The times the baby fell off the bed. The times I arrived late for<br/>
preschool pickup. The nightmare sleepover. The horrible summer camp. The day<br/>
when the youngest came barreling out of the classroom with a 98 on her<br/>
geography test, and I responded, What did you get wrong? (She insisted I<br/>
include that.) The time I ordered food at the McDonald&#39;s drive-through<br/>
speaker and then drove away without picking it up from the window. (They all<br/>
insisted I include that.) I did not allow them to watch the Simpsons for the<br/>
first two seasons. What was I thinking?<br/>
<br/>
But the biggest mistake I made is the one that most of us make while doing<br/>
this. I did not live in the moment enough. This is particularly clear now<br/>
that the moment is gone, captured only in photographs. There is one picture<br/>
of the three of them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the<br/>
swing set on a summer day, ages 6, 4 and 1. And I wish I could remember what<br/>
we ate, and what we talked about, and how they sounded, and how they looked<br/>
when they slept that night. I wish I had not been in such a hurry to get on<br/>
to the next thing: dinner, bath, book, bed. I wish I had treasured the doing<br/>
a little more and the getting it done a little less.<br/>
<br/>
Even today I&#39;m not sure what worked and what didn&#39;t, what was me and what<br/>
was simply life. When they were very small, I suppose I thought someday they<br/>
would become who they were because of what I&#39;d done. Now I suspect they<br/>
simply grew into their true selves because they demanded in a thousand ways<br/>
that I back off and let them be. The books said to be relaxed and I was<br/>
often tense, matter-of-fact and I was sometimes over the top. And look how<br/>
it all turned out. I wound up with the three people I like best in the<br/>
world, who have done more than anyone to excavate my essential humanity.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what the books never told me. I was bound and determined to learn<br/>
from the experts. It just took me a while to figure out who the experts<br/>
were.</div>
