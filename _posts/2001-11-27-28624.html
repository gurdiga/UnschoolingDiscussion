<div id="ygrps-yiv-560607679">Hey everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to write a book for ages and I finally just realized it&#39;s not the right time in my life, so I&#39;ve shifted my focus, and now I am asking for feedback from book readers. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I want to write a non-fiction book about traveling around the country with children. I have taken several trips with both of my kids, it&#39;s something that interests me...but I&#39;m not sure if anyone else is interested. <br/>
<br/>
I figured I could address the following topics: destinations, road food recipes, hotels, roughing it (camping), preparations, safety, kids, pets, gear, road games, music, record-keeping, mechanics (repair and maintenance), resources, checklists, education, and anecdotes... <br/>
<br/>
Here are some questions I have, if anyone is interested in answering them for me: <br/>
<br/>
Which of the above issues seem interesting? <br/>
<br/>
Should I gear the book towards homeschooling on the road?<br/>
<br/>
Should I just include car travel, or should I include other forms of transportation? <br/>
<br/>
Should I choose a specific destination and write only about that, or should it be general? <br/>
<br/>
Is this something people would read? <br/>
<br/>
I mean, I&#39;m really really nosy, so I would totally read a book like this...and I don&#39;t see anything else like it out there. So...tell me, bookworm mamas...if I wrote it, would you read? <br/>

Hi Lainie,<br/>
<br/>
I, personally, would like to read a personal<br/>
autobiographical account of a homeschooling family&#39;s<br/>
roadtrip(s). More like a &#39;story&#39; about it and less<br/>
like the &#39;how to&#39; do it. But then I have travelled a<br/>
lot with my dd as well and have always found personal<br/>
travelling stories facinating. Maybe you could do one<br/>
of each kind or somehow mesh the two types together<br/>
(that would be a GREAT read).<br/>
Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavour!<br/>
<br/>
Meghan<br/>

I think the book idea is an interesting one and I agree with Megan... I&#39;d prefer a more autobiographical one over a how to. I&#39;ve read a book similiar to this idea but darn if I can recall the name of it. Maybe it was a magazine article.. I don&#39;t know but it was a chronicle of this family&#39;s year long USA trip in their van. They wrote about transportation (I remember this because of the segment on Washington, DC), where to eat and what to do. I&#39;m sure there was more to it than that but memory fails me.<br/>

<br/>
The books have been published by O&#39;Reilley and Assoc.<br/>
They may not be publishing them anymore but someone<br/>
else might be. You might read some the books and see<br/>
their flavor and see if that book format would appeal<br/>
to you. I really like the series and there are some<br/>
really good ones with empowering stories of moms<br/>
traveling, women traveling.<br/>
<br/>
I really like stories about travelling rather than how<br/>
to books. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47687962">I just read today about a book called &quot;Bud and Me: The True Adventures of<br/>
the Abernathy Boys.&quot; In 1909, these two brothers, ages 9 and 5 (that is not<br/>
a typo) decided they wanted to ride from their home in Oklahoma to Santa Fe,<br/>
for starters. I&#39;m going to order it, but I wanted to pass the information<br/>
along; it sounds like a fascinating read!<br/>
