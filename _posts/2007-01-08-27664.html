<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032735460">So... someone&#39;s talking about limiting TV<br/>
which led to stories which led to Dora, and maps, and globes, and  <br/>
Tanganyika, to Zanzibar and back to Tanzania, which led to The Patty  <br/>
Duke show (in which she played identical teenaged cousins, long ago),  <br/>
and then I found the theme song, which made me poke around and find  <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island, and then<br/>
my world changed<br/>
<br/>
because I grew up far from water, and for various reasons, I just  <br/>
thought The Minnow had left from southern California.<br/>
<br/>
So I clicked on the first link of several for theme songs for  <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island and found this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sitcomsonline.com/sounds/GilligansIslandpilot.wav">http://www.sitcomsonline.com/sounds/GilligansIslandpilot.wav</a><br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s calypso.  It&#39;s the song from the pilot, which I don&#39;t guess  <br/>
I ever saw, and it&#39;s TOTALLY Caribbean.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
They left from Florida!?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, fine; now maybe people who have lived in one or the other knew.  <br/>
Or maybe it was supposed to be way ambiguous, but there was a  <br/>
Japanese pilot, which only reinforced it being in the Pacific.<br/>
<br/>
So, any of you who had a theory or knowledge of where it was supposed  <br/>
to be, let me know.  I saw the &quot;real island&quot; on the Universal Studios  <br/>
tour, so maybe they left Florida and ended up in California.  I&#39;m so  <br/>
confused.<br/>

And I&#39;ve never heard that song before; maybe they changed the locale <br/>
after the pilot (and that pilot may never have aired, too).  I would <br/>
think something so Caribbean wouldn&#39;t have played well in the <br/>
Cuban-missile-crisis 60&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I saw some movie about making the show a long time ago, but of course <br/>
can&#39;t remember much of it!<br/>

Massachusetts, and it never occurred to me that anything warm was in the<br/>

But a deserted island seemed much more likely in the vast Pacific...don&#39;t<br/>
know why I thought that either.<br/>

11 yr.old)Honolulu.  We have all three seasons on DVD.  : )<br/>

Well I&#39;m glad to know I wasn&#39;t totally delusional. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
That makes much more sense to me.<br/>
I think the radio bulletins they would hear occasionally were Pacific  <br/>
places too, if I remember correctly (which I totally might not).<br/>

========================<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure about where it was *suposed* to be but in fact, they left from<br/>
a harbor just south of Newport Beach CA called Balboa.  They &quot;landed&quot; across<br/>
the bay (less than a mile away) and you can still see the beach location<br/>
from the opening credits where the ship wreck was filmed.  The episodes were<br/>
filmed on a sound stage as Sandra pointed out.  If you like Google Earth<br/>
find Balboa, CA . The launch site (the two palm trees are still there) by E.<br/>
Balboa Blvd. and the &quot;Island&quot;  where they wrecked is just off of Bayside<br/>
Drive on the Corona Del Mar side.<br/>
 <br/>
Hows that for a head full of trivia.  (I almost said useless trivia - but I<br/>
find it amusing)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353027202">I LOVED Gilligan&#39;s Island as a kid.  I esp. remember the one with the huge<br/>
spider in the cave.  I didn&#39;t even think about them being on DVD by the<br/>
season. I just found a set on Amazon for 11.50.  I wonder if my kids will<br/>
love it as much as I did?  It&#39;ll be fun to see it from the first episode on.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My oldest has always been VERY interested in maps.  She sparked my own<br/>
interest in them and together we&#39;ve learned a lot about the world.  As a kid<br/>
(even a teen) I just didn&#39;t understand geography and how everything was<br/>
interconnected.  I knew it was;  I just couldn&#39;t figure out how because we<br/>
only ever saw one map at a time pulled down in front of the black board for<br/>
a few minutes.  I never had a chance to play with a globe and figure it out<br/>
for myself.  <br/>

I remember a Tarzan movie with a huge spider in a cave.  I remember  <br/>
the jungle was right next to the desert, in that movie.   Even as  <br/>
little kid, I knew (living in a desert) that that wasn&#39;t realistic at  <br/>
all. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

And just think, you had bathwater to swim in just a short ferry boat<br/>
ride away!<br/>
<br/>
from wikipedia: &quot;The Gulf Stream makes the climate of offshore islands<br/>
of Massachusetts, Martha&#39;s Vineyard and Nantucket, milder than that of<br/>
Massachusetts Bay, which is isolated from its effects by Cape Cod.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I grew up enjoying that, now I can barely set foot in my adopted<br/>
Pacific ocean, for fear of hypothermia.  <br/>
