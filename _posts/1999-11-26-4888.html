<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477683201">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i know that in certain circles turning off the tv is considered the only<br/>
thing to do to combat the development of consumerism in children (and<br/>
adults).   honestly i would normally agree, however, that is not always<br/>
the most feasible solution for some families.   in the event that your<br/>
situations (like mine, i have a disabling disease that has destroyed<br/>
much of my shoulder muscles) warrants the use of tv,  i suggest that you<br/>
talk to your kids about tv like you would any &#39;drug&#39; or source of<br/>
possible danger.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve run up against the &#39;nag factor&#39; immediately upon my son&#39;s<br/>
discovery of commercial tv.   within a few months of this discovery we<br/>
have been able to explain to him why we feel that buying all those<br/>
things is not in his best interest and that what we really want is for<br/>
him to find his happiness regardless of circumstance or the possessions<br/>
of others.  we also told him that it&#39;s perfectly ok to desire, but not<br/>
to the point where it ruins your day and your core happiness, and that<br/>
if you find yourself desirous of something simply acknowledge it and<br/>
then find something to do that makes you really happy and appreciate<br/>
your life just the way it is.  this is a slow process (which has not<br/>
been the easiest) and i found that when i stopped judging him for<br/>
wanting  (and me for using the tv to aid me) things began to shift and i<br/>
began to see that in time my son will have a powerful tool, which is the<br/>
ability to recognize that those things may be fun but they will never<br/>
bring him happiness.  with this understanding and perspective he will be<br/>
able to foster discernment.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m certainly not advocating tv but what i am advocating is a solution<br/>
to every situation and that every situation can be used as a learning<br/>
experience.  i&#39;ve had two and a half years of facing this dilemma and am<br/>
very happy to be on a path that will lead to a strong place, one less<br/>
vulnerable to consumerism.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is really beautiful--extremely subtle and powerful.  It helps me the<br/>
same way that understanding that courage is about persisting in the face of<br/>
fear, rather than not experiencing (or copping to) fear at all.<br/>
<br/>
Desire happens--and your son will be so much stronger for being able to see<br/>
it, call it by its name, and then make a choice of what he wants to do with<br/>
it, rather than not experience it and be blindsided by it sometime.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your perspective.<br/>
