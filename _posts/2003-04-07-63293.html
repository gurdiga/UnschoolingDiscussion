<div id="ygrps-yiv-21648691">Hi All,<br/>
  I&#39;m looking for suggestions for helping my kids meet some friends. My son <br/>
is basically a homebody and doesn&#39;t care for large group activities. We don&#39;t <br/>
attend church and most of my friends&#39; kids attend school. We&#39;ve tried various <br/>
art classes, zoo activities,  or homeschool group activities to meet some <br/>
kids and after a few times, he asks to just go home. He&#39;s a very happy <br/>
homebody, though he does enjoy playing with other kids when we get together. <br/>
]<br/>
   My daughter, on the other hand, is VERY social and craves the company of <br/>
other kids. Any ideas? (BTW, my kids are really young yet, ages 5.5 and 3.5.)<br/>

I&#39;m wondering why being that your son seems so happy with the present<br/>
arrangement, why you feel you need to find him friends? I happen to think<br/>
that young children really don&#39;t need as much social interaction with other<br/>
children as most people think is necessary. Some kids need more and some<br/>
less. When you go on field trips or get togethers, do you ask your son if he<br/>
wants to go? Is it by his choice? If so, and he enjoys himself and doesn&#39;t<br/>
ask for other interaction and is perfectly happy at home, then I would make<br/>
him have friends more often. If your daughter on the other hand enjoys it<br/>
more often and asks, I would try ot find interaction for her more often<br/>
maybe without dragging your son along. Do you have someone that can stay<br/>
home with your son while you take her out or take your daughter out? If not,<br/>
how about just asking a friend over for her so your son can play alone at<br/>
home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Yes, any activities, field trips, etc...are his choice. I ask him if he <br/>
wants to go. He wanted to go to children&#39;s art activity classes and we went <br/>
to 2 before he started saying he didn&#39;t want to go anymore. He seemed to <br/>
really enjoy it while he was there. Same thing happened at any number of <br/>
activities. <br/>
  I&#39;m looking into some activities for my daughter since she&#39;s the one who <br/>
really craves the company of other kids. I do realize that my kids&#39;  need for <br/>
social interaction and their personalities are very different. Thanks for the <br/>
feedback.<br/>

See, that&#39;s great then. He tried something, enjoyed it for awhile and then<br/>
decided he didn&#39;t really want anymore. He&#39;ll do that again when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
May be next year or may not be until he&#39;s 10. Sounds like a kid who knows<br/>
what he wants!<br/>
