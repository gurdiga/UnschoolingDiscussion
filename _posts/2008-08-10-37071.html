<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948130548">My dd16, Claire, confronted me about an arbitrary rule I&#39;ve spouted <br/>
for years.  In light of our examining other arbitrary rules, she <br/>
brought this one to my attention.  I&#39;ve always told her it&#39;s not <br/>
proper for girls and boys to do sleepovers.  She started asking about <br/>
that when she was in elementary school.  She had boy friends as well <br/>
as girl friends and she has never understood why they should be <br/>
treated differently.<br/>
<br/>
As she got older and had official boyfriends, I felt even more <br/>
strongly about the idea that they would be in a bedroom alone at any <br/>
time of day. I laughed when she told me how ridiculous that was <br/>
because if I was worried about sex, they could do that kind of stuff <br/>
anywhere and didn&#39;t need a bed.  As I agreed, I relaxed and Claire <br/>
and her boyfriends often hung out in her room alone, but I still felt <br/>
uncomfortable at the idea of a sleepover.<br/>
<br/>
She asked me very direct questions about why her boyfriend couldn&#39;t <br/>
spend the night.  She helped me realize that I trust her and she <br/>
makes good decisions and that being alone for several hours in the <br/>
day was no different than being alone several hours in the night.  It <br/>
basically came down to my excuse of... but it&#39;s just not proper and <br/>
not socially acceptable.  Argh.  For me, this really is another <br/>
arbitrary rule that I&#39;ve had to face, conquer and let go.  Claire <br/>
found it amusing that I&#39;m a parent who can discuss hard topics like <br/>
sex with my children quite easily and without embarrassment, yet the <br/>
idea of a guy sleeping over made me cringe.  I told her it&#39;s probably <br/>
because she&#39;s my baby and watching her transition into an adult is an <br/>
ending of something for me.  I&#39;ve got to focus on the beginning for <br/>
her instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-763622962">-=-. I&#39;ve always told her it&#39;s not<br/>
proper for girls and boys to do sleepovers. She started asking about<br/>
that when she was in elementary school. She had boy friends as well<br/>
as girl friends and she has never understood why they should be<br/>
treated differently.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because of a babysitting co-op that turned into a playgroup, we&#39;ve  <br/>
had mixed sleepovers always, because very often it was a set of mixed  <br/>
siblings.    And as the kids got older, some would come from other  <br/>
towns to go to movies or concerts or parties and would stay over at  <br/>
our house until parents could get them the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have boys in my room and I could shut the door, and I  <br/>
didn&#39;t &quot;do it&quot; with any of them.  Most of them weren&#39;t even my  <br/>
boyfriends.  Other friends of mine who weren&#39;t even allowed to date  <br/>
at all  managed to find places for quickies!  I had the reputation  <br/>
and they had the action, as it were.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had a girlfriend once upon a time and she stayed here and they  <br/>
didn&#39;t do &quot;IT&quot; though I think they did some related-to-it things.  He  <br/>
has another girlfriend now, older than he is, and sometimes he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t come home at night.  He&#39;s 19 and she&#39;s 21 so I can&#39;t be  <br/>
saying too much except &quot;be careful.&quot;  We like her.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a boyfriend.  He&#39;s older than she is.  He&#39;s older than  <br/>
Marty.  He&#39;s older than Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t happen suddenly.  It was VERY gradual, over years, so they  <br/>
really know each other well and knew in depth what would be involved  <br/>
as to families and pressure from friends and that.  He&#39;s been a  <br/>
friend of Kirby&#39;s for four or five years, and almost that long of  <br/>
Marty&#39;s, and almost that long of Holly&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised, but it&#39;s silly that I was.  We were always happy and  <br/>
proud of the fact that Kirby had friends older than he was, and  <br/>
younger.  Ditto Marty.  Ditto Holly but WHOA!!!! We didn&#39;t think of  <br/>
*that.*<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s a sweetie, and look at them:<br/>

<br/>
Too many young couples are arbitrarily separated.  On much reflection  <br/>
and hearing the stories of many people over the years, I think it&#39;s a  <br/>
bad thing.    Too many people are wounded by young love thwarted.     <br/>
So when it seemed like it might possibly come to physicality, I took  <br/>
Holly to Planned Parenthood.  This makes me a big sinner in the eyes  <br/>
of many, and I hope there won&#39;t be too many on this list who run off  <br/>
and reject me socially forevermore, but I think it&#39;s a bigger sin to  <br/>
leave young adults without choices and options, without knowledge and  <br/>
openness.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one reason there are so many mean grandmothers in the world is  <br/>
that they did not WANT those grandchildren, and the grandchildren  <br/>
came too early because the mothers &quot;just said no&quot; to having a  <br/>
supportive relationship with a daughter or a son.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw this on someone&#39;s blog the other day:  &quot;Who we pretend to be,  <br/>
we become. Pretend well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t pretend with my kids, and they don&#39;t have to pretend with  <br/>
me.  It&#39;s scary sometimes, but it&#39;s real and it&#39;s also very good to  <br/>
share things that most families don&#39;t get to even hear about, or that  <br/>
most teens have to lie about.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has made good decisions for years, and she&#39;s still making  <br/>
carefully thought out decisions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423049954">This reminds me when I was 17 and started dating my first serious boyfriend who was 24.<br/>
He was older but a great boyfriend and we had been friends for a long time before that ( since I was 13)<br/>
When we decided we wanted to have sex he asked me to talk to my mom so we could go to a doctor and <br/>
get ready for it  ( birth control etc). Of course he knew my mom would be the kind of mom who would accept that<br/>
as when we started dating he took my mom to lunch to ask her permission and talk to her since he was older and I was still 17.<br/>
He asked me if I wanted him to talk to my mom a out taking me to a doctor so we could start having sex but I was OK doing it.<br/>
So my mom took me and I knew I could really on my mom for anything I needed and to talk about <br/>
anything over.<br/>
It was awesome having a mom like that. I am lucky she could be the partner I needed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so interesting.  One of my sisters was in love when my parents were<br/>
in the process of moving us to another state as they often did when I was<br/>
younger.  The move was the reason but not a good excuse for arbitrarily<br/>
separating her from a boyfriend who they liked a lot.  Then as well as in<br/>
later years they said he was the best boyfriend she ever had.  They liked<br/>
him but didn&#39;t even allow her to talk to him on the phone when he called.<br/>
Giving her new address wasn&#39;t allowed either because they didn&#39;t see any<br/>
reason to continue something long distance for a barely 17 year old.  At<br/>
almost 9, I thought it was arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
Puppy love they called it.  So they made the decision for her and she lived<br/>
with the consequence.<br/>
<br/>
Since then she has been through a number of difficult scary relationships<br/>
with red flags everywhere, including 2 decades of seriously angry husband.<br/>
I think the above has a lot to do with that.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I think those incidents are related is when you&#39;re young happy<br/>
and confident, you make decisions based on *that* outlook.  When you&#39;re<br/>
older, unhappy, and scared, you make decisions based on a very different<br/>
outlook.<br/>

<br/>
Ah, but his wife would not.<br/>
She didn&#39;t know he took me to dinner.  He told her he was taking his  <br/>
friend Jeff to play handball.  And to add insult to possible injury,  <br/>
we were in her car.<br/>
<br/>
We did not hold  hands.  We did not kiss.  We hugged.  That&#39;s ALL.   <br/>
There was not a smidgeon of romance, just of joy to see each other  <br/>
and apologies and explanations and remorse and stories of our kids  <br/>
and expressions of gladness that the other was healthy and busy.  We  <br/>
talked about our parents.  He knew both of mine and had met three of  <br/>
my grandparents.  I hadn&#39;t met his parents, and they didn&#39;t want me  <br/>
in his life, and his dad is still controlling and shaming, with Dev  <br/>
in his 50&#39;s and a doctor (as all good Indian boys should be).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve knowingly been sneaky that way.  At first  <br/>
when he told me, before we went out there, that maybe he could meet  <br/>
me but it would have to be secret, I said no.  But then I thought  <br/>
about it and said if that was the only way, okay.<br/>
<br/>
There have been just teensy e-mails, not much, and we&#39;re not &quot;in  <br/>
contact.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When he tried to find me a few years ago, because his mother had  <br/>
pressed  him to get  all his stuff out of their house and part of it  <br/>
was letters from me from the early 1980&#39;s, he called the number that  <br/>
was in there and I answered.  He  had expected it to have been  <br/>
reassigned, or to find someone and make inquiries, but I said  <br/>
&quot;Hello.&quot;  That day we talked a long, long time.  But his wife didn&#39;t  <br/>
approve of the reconnection, so he&#39;s had to pull way back and that&#39;s  <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
He gave Marty and Holly gifts that day.  We were at Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s  <br/>
house.  He gave Marty some sandalwood prayer beads.  Marty wore them  <br/>
on his wrist, doubled, for years.  Once when he was in Washington or  <br/>
Oregon he left them draped on a lamp in a hotel (lobby maybe?), and  <br/>
they drove back several miles to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Last month Marty had a skateboard accident, in the dark, on a street  <br/>
in another neighborhood.  He was banged up some, not broken, but  <br/>
didn&#39;t realize until he had left the scene and come all the way home  <br/>
that those beads had broken in the accident.<br/>

about it at livingourlifetogether.blogspot.com   I pretty much came to <br/>
the same conclusion. I trust her and if she is comfortable then I just <br/>
need to deal.  I had a little jolt when I found out she had been <br/>
kissing boys.  SO far I&#39;m ok though.  When it comes time for a real <br/>
boyfriend and her being ready to have sex I&#39;m sure I will struggle <br/>
with it but we&#39;ll get through it.  SHe tends to be more on the <br/>
reserved side so I may not know about it ahead of time.  I hope so <br/>
though.  We live together with my mom and she is very uncomfortable <br/>
with Lizzy having boys sleep over but respects me as the parent.  I&#39;ve <br/>
told Lizzy these things are her decision.  One thing I am sure of is <br/>
that she will not do anything she does not want to do and she will do <br/>
what she wants.  SHe knows I&#39;m there if she needs me.  <br/>
