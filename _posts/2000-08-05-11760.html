<br/>
&lt;&lt;A journal is a big help.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	I found that to be true, especially when I was just getting started and<br/>
felt like I had to prove to other people that my kids were learning. I<br/>
never really used the journal for that, but reading about our<br/>
involvements did reninforce my belief that unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;Talking to your kids is also a great way to be reassured.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	IMHO, that is THE best way. It takes time and effort, and being involved<br/>
in their lives--and shows you who they are becoming and what interests<br/>
them most. Funny thing, when we give the standardized tests to our kids<br/>
(easiest form of &quot;proof of progress&quot; for us to give the state), they<br/>
don&#39;t tell us anything new; they just confirm what we already knew about<br/>
our children&#39;s strengths and weaknesses.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;A kid telling you all about this wonderful book they read is a book<br/>
report-an oral one-and has more value than answering 10 comprehension<br/>
questions on a worksheet. They will learn, and you will see it-just have<br/>
fun and have faith in them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Excellent advice!<br/>
