<div id="ygrps-yiv-662930100">&quot;I just wanted to say that it means a lot to me that I can be upfront and open <br/>
about my family&#39;s life here, and get such support. Sometimes it&#39;s pretty <br/>
lonely in the Homeschooling world...t&#39;ain&#39;t many of us queer folks out there,<br/>
 and <br/>
certainly not many unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand. I think that the religious conservatives feel that if the doors are open to same sex marriage, it will just explode or something. But gay relationships are likely to be a minority, just as gay marriages would be.<br/>
The benefits of marriage are also overshadowed by the inconveniences of having to file for divorce if the couple doesn&#39;t want to continue the union. So there isn&#39;t a huge number of people using marriage just for the benefits I would guess.<br/>
And if someone is going to &quot;use&quot; marriage laws strictly for their benefit, does it matter if they&#39;re gay or hetero? <br/>
<br/>
True story:<br/>
I worked at a health club with a gay couple back in the early 90&#39;s. Both good looking and getting hit on by girls ALL the time. One of them married a girl that needed a green card really badly. So there was your opposite sex marriage that the religious folks are so approving of...but they all lived in the same house of course.<br/>
Might as well let Tim and Philipe get married!!! That would actually have made sense. DUH.<br/>
