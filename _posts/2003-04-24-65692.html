<br/>
My son did a lot of what you describe in school at that age too.  He has flourished being at home, not homeschooling, but UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are a few people from Michigan here who can help you with how to get started.<br/>

<br/>
First, bring him home.  Maybe right now, if you read this before school is <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t send him tomorrow. I&#39;m serious.  If he really wants to go back some <br/>
before the end of school, it doesn&#39;t have to be this week.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to homeschool, he doesn&#39;t need to finish this year.  He <br/>
doesn&#39;t need anything but to leave the toxic situation and get started on <br/>
your new life together.<br/>
<br/>
I would advise you not to spend any money whatsoever on special supplies or <br/>
homeschooling anything.  There are websites galore to read, but ignore the <br/>
advertising for now (and forever, if you can).   If you want to spend any <br/>
money, take him to lunch at various restaurants.  Ethnic or foreign if you <br/>
can.  Nice ones with ambiance and quiet.  Sit and talk.  Buy him magazines <br/>
about things he&#39;s interested in.  Buy him a new video game.  Rent some DVDs.  <br/>
Make popcorn and cookies.  Kick back.  Relax and talk and just be with him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh my goodness!  Go, RUN, as fast as you can and grab your child!  There is <br/>
something TERRIBLY wrong when a principal is diagnosing and ordering <br/>
medication for children.  Sounds like he wants your son drugged to make <br/>
*HIS* (the P&#39;s)life easier.  Zombie kids = no trouble???  THAT is scary.  I <br/>
could go on and on but I&#39;ll save it for the pillow. ;)<br/>
<br/>
From what you wrote, it sounds like he NEEDS to be home!  You said he <br/>
doesn&#39;t have those problems at home, only at school.  For me, that would be <br/>
the ONLY reason I would need to yank him out so fast the damn principal <br/>
wouldn&#39;t know what hit him!<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a classic case of a child in need of unschooling.  Once the <br/>
barriers and pressures are missing, he WILL flourish.  You will meet an <br/>
entirely different boy. His confidence will soar and I&#39;m willing to bet the <br/>
signs of ADHD will fall to the wayside.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you, we&#39;re here if you decide to take the plunge!!!<br/>

I am new to all this myself, so I can&#39;t  give you much advice on <br/>
getting started.  I do have to say I thought Sandra&#39;s advice was a <br/>
tear jerker.  So many of us are scard to ruin our children so we put <br/>
them in the care of others who do it for us.  Just picturing a child <br/>
being made to feel that important and being allowed to be a kid <br/>
confirmed my decision for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I can share this with you, I have a nephew who has been struggling <br/>
with public school for years.  I think what started out as trying to <br/>
be popular and the class clown turned him into the target.  He has <br/>
been picked on for years, to the point where I cannot understand it.  <br/>
He is unsuccessful in school, smart but no motivation.  They have <br/>
done all the battery of tests to try and label him but he is not <br/>
fitting any of there criteria.  Wouldn&#39;t they love to find out that <br/>
he has some disorder they can all blame besides themselves!  Anyway, <br/>
point is I don&#39;t know what he will make of his life because his <br/>
parents are not really doing anything to change the situation. They <br/>
are frustatred but not willing to try private school and certainly <br/>
would never consider pulling him from school.  But all I keep <br/>
thinking is he is learning nothing that will help him in real life.  <br/>
What he is learning is that he is not valuble or lovable or even <br/>
likable for that matter and he will spend the rest of his life trying <br/>
to get over that.  Hopefully, your son can get out and over it and on <br/>
with his life while he is still a kid and can enjoy it.  Good luck <br/>
with whatever you do.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734569937">Hi Nita,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the laws in your state im sure someone on this list does.<br/>
We had similar issues at school, often the school got tired of me in their <br/>
face as to why they where allowing my son to be bullied.<br/>
I just wanted to chime in and tell you that pulling our son was the best <br/>
decision we ever made. He is 11 now and has no interest in going back at all. <br/>
We also do not use any of the local town sports teams as the same children <br/>
continued to be abusive to our son and others.<br/>
We let him go back one more time for two weeks last year and the fist day he <br/>
came home crying, some things never change I just hope someday he will let it <br/>
all go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466885490">Nita, don&#39;t send your son back! Our son was in the 5th grade also and was <br/>
going through the same your son is going through (minus ADHD) and he wouldn&#39;t <br/>
fight back. We tried so often to get these issues resolved and it always came <br/>
back to comments like: kids will be kids, your kid is too quiet and so on. <br/>
Our son eventually did not trust adults let alone other kids. We were <br/>
thinking about homeschooling for about 4 months but by then the damage had <br/>
been done. Those kids that were beating him up took it a step farther and our <br/>
son was seriously injured. We didn&#39;t see any anger in our son either. Since <br/>
we&#39;ve had him home with us, I have seen a lot of anger and resentment. It <br/>
gets better each day that he is not in public school and the anger is slowly <br/>
fading away. Please don&#39;t wait another minute. Don&#39;t send him back. Keep him <br/>
home with you where he belongs. <br/>

Hi! I live in Michigan and I`m thinking about taking my son out of <br/>
<br/>
public school and home schooling him. He is not doing well in the <br/>
<br/>
public school system. He is in fifth grade this year. He hates going <br/>
<br/>
to school. He has no friends and gets picked on every day. When he <br/>
<br/>
was in second grade he was diagnosed with ADHD. Of course they put <br/>
<br/>

Zoning out and daydreaming all the time. We decided to take him off <br/>

<br/>
and he blows up for what they say is no reason. I do not see this <br/>
<br/>
behavior at home. He does his homework for me without a problem. <br/>
<br/>
Usually what happens is some kid picks on him, he asks them to leave <br/>
<br/>
him alone and when they dont, he explodes. He has been suspended <br/>
<br/>
twice for fighting. He always get blamed as well. They say he should <br/>
<br/>

teachers that he has done real with. Who actually took the time to <br/>
<br/>
care. And he loved going to see them. As far as friends, he has <br/>
<br/>

  JUst needed to add my piece. When I pulled my daughter out of school the bullying had just begun. Can&#39;t tell you how uncertain and afraid I was. Now it is five years later and it has never looked like the wrong move for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820742382">Hello everyone. Just wanted to share some thoughts and perhaps get a <br/>
little support.... I have, for a long time, thought of myself as <br/>
kind of an oddball, because I seem to think about things and see <br/>
things from a perspective that the people around me haven&#39;t even <br/>
thought about at all! <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have that kind of feeling? For example, in the public <br/>
school world, the way people assume that a certain score on a test <br/>
indicates that learning has been achieved. I try to talk to friends <br/>
about this, and how it just doesn&#39;t add up to me, and they look at <br/>
me like I&#39;m nuts, and who cares? And everyone&#39;s kids are required to <br/>
do it, so it must be right. <br/>
<br/>
An example: Last year when my son was in Kindergarten the teacher <br/>
sent home math tasks that were to be completed each week (on your <br/>
honor, as there was no work to be handed in). On Friday we were to <br/>
send in a sheet of paper, signed by both parent and child, stating <br/>
we had done the work, and circling a face to indicate our &quot;feelings&quot; <br/>
about doing it: happy, sad, or indifferent. <br/>
<br/>
I told the Kindergarten teacher I had a problem with that, and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be doing it. I told her it made something that was very <br/>
natural for us (doing math around the house and in &quot;real life&quot;) very <br/>
self-conscious and put rules and requirements on it that took away <br/>
the fun and spontaneity of it... and that it really didn&#39;t need to <br/>
be quantified or assessed anyway. She replied that it was important <br/>
because in First Grade he would have homework every night and he <br/>
needed to get used to it... to get in the habit of it. <br/>
<br/>
Homework in first grade??? This was my thought. Homework in first <br/>
grade??? Why isn&#39;t a 7-hour school day enough for a child of the age <br/>
of 6? I mentioned this to some friends. &quot;Do you realize the test <br/>
scores for our district are among the highest in this area?&quot; was one <br/>
response. Like... don&#39;t question it, it must be right. Others just <br/>
kind of looked at me blankly. Or, as another mom said, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s <br/>
true. Kids do need to learn the habit of doing homework.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Well, we ended up moving out of that district, but I have stayed in <br/>
touch. And yes, the first graders have homework... about an hour <br/>
*every* night. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m ranting here. Just simply wondering if anyone else thinks <br/>
this is culturally embedded insanity. Or if it&#39;s me. <br/>

preaching to the choir, as it were. <br/>

But what you describe is very typical of both public<br/>
and private schools.  Has been for over 10 years at<br/>

Could be both!<br/>
<br/>
Some people are more sheeplike and some are appreciative of having their <br/>
lives directed by experts.  Others balk.  Some balk too much so that it becomes <br/>
just a kneejerk reaction, kind of a kid-style &quot;You can&#39;t make me,&quot; and some <br/>
adults (I&#39;m related to one) get into a lifelong habit of saying &quot;nuh uh&quot; about any <br/>
suggestion no matter how good.  They make their decisions by the &quot;just say <br/>
no&quot; method.  So the teachers at school might have blown you off as just a person <br/>
who&#39;s obstinant.<br/>
<br/>
But there IS cultural delusion about the value and place of school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450016159">Found an over-priced bag of old-fashioned jacks made out of pewter in <br/>
Colonial Williamsburg and picked them up. The set includes a rubber ball <br/>
and a wooden one for throwing up in the air, which they did before rubber <br/>
was available. That&#39;s really hard! It also came with a neat little blurb on <br/>
the history of jackstones and several game variations.  Jacks were <br/>
originally played with sheep&#39;s knucklebones. Very interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058551092">Im right there with you!! Test scores never told me how much my son knew, <br/>
just that he hated tests and he was/is a bright young man with lots of <br/>
learning left to do at his own pase. I ALWAYS hated homework, even as a kid <br/>
in school my self. I would spend countless hours up at the school trying to <br/>
get the teachers to stop giving him so much home work, but they never saw it <br/>
my way... So I took him out. I thought I was truely insane and the only one <br/>
that thought this way, untill I met an unschooler... YAY!!!!!!! I found my <br/>

Hello everyone. Just wanted to share some thoughts and perhaps get a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505766387">Carly, <br/>
<br/>
WOW...I had the exact same reasons for taking Nicolas out of school. He<br/>
is my 6yr old and I was just so disgusted with the fact that they had<br/>
homework, even in K. They had a packet to do every week, each night at<br/>
least one page and this is in prep for 1st grade. Plus a book report<br/>
every week. What good will that do a child that cant read on his own<br/>
anyway? I was doing all the reading, then I had to help him figure out<br/>
what he wanted to tell about the story (fav part or something) then I<br/>
had to help him write it. It was homework for me really. <br/>
So, I pulled him out and I thought I would work with him everyday on<br/>
SOMETHING. Keep his mind moving, I guess. Now, with a little help and<br/>
encouragement from a local mummy! I am laying off. If he wants to watch<br/>
TV, ok. If he wants to play with legos and pretend that they are<br/>
battleships, ok. The more I lay off, the more I see bits of interest in<br/>
things. Its definitely a slow process, my kid is OBSESSED with TV. BUT,<br/>
the other day I brought home some new things and he was into them big<br/>
time. <br/>
We are much happier this way than in school worrying about bedtimes and<br/>
waking up on time and getting out the door and pickup and HOMEWORK,<br/>
BLOODY HOMEWORK! LOL <br/>
<br/>
BTW...let me introduce myself. I am Annette. I have a hubby-Jason, 2<br/>
boys-Nicolas 6 and Joseph-18mo and expecting another 1/12/04. We live in<br/>
