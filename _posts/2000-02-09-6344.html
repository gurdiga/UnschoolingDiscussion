<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834945328">&lt;&lt; Anyway, I know there must others like us on this list, and I was wondering <br/>
how the moms on this list balance their needs to work and find fulfillment <br/>
outside the family (mine is to make dances) with the need to homeschool <br/>
and be with their children? I&#39;d love to hear stories of how other mothers <br/>
made the adjustment to family living from career. <br/>

supposed to be pretty good. About having it all, but maybe not all right <br/>
now. <br/>

There is a mothers group called FEMALE that was started in order to help moms with this.  In fact I think the woman who wrote the sequencing book is a member of FEMALE.  Female is a national group and it stands for Formerly Employed Mothers At Loose Ends (it used to be Leading Edge).  They are going to be changing their name this spring.  I think it&#39;s going to be sequencing mothers or something like that.  BTW sequencing just means going from full time work to maybe full time mom back to parttime when the kids get a little older to maybe full time again...just for example.  It really is an excellent book for those moms who are having a hard time adjusting to full time mother.  I know I did.  Which is part of the reason I started my very part time home based business.  :)<br/>
