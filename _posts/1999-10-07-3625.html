&lt;&lt; I can only assume that such an assumtion comes<br/>
of living in a country that can be often very slanted toward Christianity. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
not so fast...<br/>
<br/>
really it was just an observation of the wording that she used.  for example, <br/>
if you say, &quot;sometimes im glad im not a homeschooler.&quot; then, it also could <br/>
mean: usually (the rest of the time) you wish you were.<br/>
<br/>
i have a natural interest in semantics and language usage and thought if the <br/>
underlying wish was for Christianity, i would remind her that God is always <br/>
waiting for us to come back to Him.....<br/>
