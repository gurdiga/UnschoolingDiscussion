&lt;&lt; When my earthly race is over<br/>
And I&#39;m ready for the clover<br/>
And they ask me how my life has been<br/>
I guess I&#39;ll have to say,<br/>
I got stoned and I missed it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And  now he&#39;s dead.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(At our house &quot;And now he&#39;s dead&quot; is the punchline to many jokes.<br/>
<br/>
It works like this:   &quot;I don&#39;t drink milk.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Oh.  Okay, I understand.  My grandmother drank milk, and now she&#39;s dead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wish I had a pickup.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Marty Tufts had a pickup, and now he&#39;s dead.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
If that fundamentalist Christian homeschooling movement /fundie group has <br/>
anything to say about it, he&#39;s burning in hell for all eternity.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, they have nothing to say about it.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be very <br/>
disappointed.<br/>
