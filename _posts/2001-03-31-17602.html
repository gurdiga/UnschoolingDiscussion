&lt;&lt; With close friends and family I am more likely to follow the adage, &quot;Let <br/>
your<br/>
 life speak for itself.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 Laura, that is really nice....<br/>
 I think I need to engrave that someplace, or paint it on many of my walls.  <br/>
That<br/>
 is so true, but hard to remind oneself of...<br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
 Ann &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Ann. My daughter&#39;s birthday is next weekend. My parents and my in-laws <br/>
will come. I love them all, but ... what is that feeling I&#39;m trying to <br/>
describe ... I feel pulled back into a &quot;good little girl&quot; role when they are <br/>
here. Seeking approval. &quot;Look, look at how great my kids are, gang! Aren&#39;t I <br/>
DOING A GREAT JOB?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Yuck. They leave and I&#39;m disgusted with myself. Sooo ... this time I am <br/>
trying HARDER to remind myself to let my life speak for itself. What is that <br/>
quote I can&#39;t call to mind right now? Something about not being able to hear <br/>
your words because your personality is speaking too loudly? Is it Twain? Help.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the ramble.<br/>

when I&#39;m not, I&#39;m defensive. Where&#39;s the BALANCE, the EQUANIMITY!!??<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;m feeling like a Hippocratic. I yearn for the &quot;let your life speak <br/>
for itself&quot; stance, but I papered my dining room wall with favorite quotes. <br/>
There are a LOT of unschooling quotes there. (Sandra is well represented. <br/>
Along with Margaret Mead, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw. You know the <br/>
quotes.) Passive-aggressive of me, I know.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In order to be an immaculate member of a flock of sheep, one must above all <br/>
be a sheep oneself.&quot; Albert Einstein<br/>
