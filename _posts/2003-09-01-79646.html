&lt;&lt; Think about your husband angrily cleaning up something that seems foolish <br/>
to<br/>
clean up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband does that.  Sometimes he dramatically and loudly cleans something <br/>
up, while muttering.   <br/>
<br/>
But I was gone a week, and he didn&#39;t wipe the countertops, and didn&#39;t do ANY <br/>
laundry.<br/>
<br/>
So I cleaned the countertops extra well, happy to be home, and did LOTS of <br/>
laundry.  It&#39;s still piled on the couch, but its clean!   <br/>

(Joyce I liked your whole post and I saved it and someday it will be on a <br/>
webpage with the Greatest Hits of Thoughts about Chores.)<br/>
