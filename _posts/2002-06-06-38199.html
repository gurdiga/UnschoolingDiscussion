<div id="ygrps-yiv-406238527">Here on our peaceful block we have a family with a labeled ADHD 10 year old <br/>
girl. She has been and is on all kinds of meds. All us parents watch the <br/>
children in the court play. All except this family. Her kids are sent out, <br/>
10 year old watching 2-3 year old. Never in 2 years has the mom or dad sat <br/>
out in the cool evenings watching the girls play. A toddler out solo, that <br/>
is a nother post. The family is extremely strict, no this no that, lots of <br/>
do not touch, Kimmy be quiet...I can not talk with the mom anymore because I <br/>
find every interaction she has with kids to be verging on abuse. Her poor <br/>
daughter, who has a huge heart, never has friends over, never goes to the <br/>
pool, which is 1000 feet away, or the park. This girl is full of life and <br/>
truly loves living. It is so sad to watch her being raised. She has asked <br/>
many times for me to be her mom. Her mom talks only of her problems and <br/>
Kimmy&#39;s disabilities. I don&#39;t think I have ever seen the mom smile. The dad <br/>
can not say hi as he zips down the street on his bike. Why do these people <br/>
even have kids? So I agree with the opinion that environment plays a huge <br/>
role in the families of these very active, loving children. Just my 2 cents.<br/>

I was an ADD mom like the one you described.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t because I didn&#39;t love or want my kids it was<br/>
because I didn&#39;t love myself.  I had a neighbor tell<br/>
me that I needed to go into counseling.  She just so<br/>
happened to know somebody who was a non-profit<br/>
counselor and this situation changed my life and<br/>
enabled me to help myself and my ADD child as well as<br/>
be able to homeschool. Her love and support really<br/>
helped me through this time. Maybe she was put into<br/>
your path for a reason.  Food for thought.<br/>
