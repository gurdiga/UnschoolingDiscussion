<div id="ygrps-yiv-819094539">Joseph just loves to make up his own games. No matter how much he enjoys <br/>
something else, he always ends up doing something of his own. When we see a <br/>
movie, he comes home and acts out his own. When we play a game, he makes up <br/>
his own game. Whether it&#39;s Monopoly, Yu Gi Oh, Sorry, you&#39;ll find him later <br/>
that night drawing and cutting out games pieces and modifying the game <br/>
somewhat to make it his own. He actually cut out and made all the paper <br/>
money for a Monopoly game he was making.<br/>
<br/>
It takes him forever and although his ideas are great, sometimes his games <br/>
get very long winded and confusing to everyone but him to play. He gets <br/>
frustrated and to be honest, so does everyone else in the house when he asks <br/>
for someone to play with him.<br/>
<br/>
I know they have a computer program where you can design your own amusement <br/>
park or roller coaster or something. That he has no interest in but I was <br/>
wondering if anyone knew of a program or game where he could make up his <br/>
own? Something he could work on and maybe even play himself and fine tune <br/>
it. Keep in mind he just turned 8 and although he plays on the computer, <br/>
he&#39;s not real into how it all works.<br/>

&quot;A library of wisdom, is more precious than all wealth, and all <br/>
things that are desirable cannot be compared to it. Whoever <br/>
therefore claims to be zealous of truth, of happiness, of wisdom or <br/>
knowledge, aye even of the faith, must needs become a lover of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s Stagecast Creator. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stagecast.com/)">http://www.stagecast.com/)</a> You create objects<br/>
and move them around the screen. Then tell the computer how they behave or<br/>
interact with other objects.<br/>
<br/>
Though the program is almost intuitive, the tutorial is excellent and can<br/>
easily get kids up to speed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it would be too hard for your 8 yo but fortunately you can<br/>
download a demo (only allows 3 objects) and download the tutorial too so you<br/>
can try it out.<br/>
