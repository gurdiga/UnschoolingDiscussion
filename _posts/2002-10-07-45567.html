<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248589918">***If you want to make one, not out of newspaper, out of plastic or<br/>
metal pipes<br/>
and have a jungle gym/ dome house out back, check out<br/>
www.desertdomes.com (or<br/>
maybe desertdome.com).  It has a calculator for making different sizes.<br/>
We<br/>
haven&#39;t done it but we want to.  (What else is new?)<br/>

Thank you - now that we have built the paper one, we are anxious to<br/>
build a &quot;real&quot; one.  One that will hold it&#39;s own against the elements.<br/>
They are way too fun.<br/>
