<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624214457">Hi Everybody<br/>
I have been following the posts of today about what is unschooling, and I gather that I will be told fairly quickly if I am in the right place or not.<br/>
I am looking for support with regards to unschooling to know if I am &quot;doing it right&quot;. I realise that there is no one right way to do it, I guess I just need encouragement from &quot;those-in-the know&quot; that my children aren&#39;t going to grow up stupid - although I know that they wont because I watch them daily and am amazed by what they have picked up from various sources.<br/>
Having said all of that, my girls are only nearly 6 and 3 1/2 so I also realise that there isn&#39;t a panic to &quot;get them educated&quot;.  I am doing this on my own in that I live in a foreign country, don&#39;t speak the language very well and have no friends.  <br/>
My girls are mostly good friends with each other and spend the whole day playing mostly with Barbie and Winnie the Pooh. I do very little with them except reading a few chapters of a book each day. They do pretty much their own thing while I cook, scrapbook or try learn more about unschooling.<br/>
The one thing that I am really looking for is  a book-list of titles that would be suitable and encouraging to read to them. There is no English Library here so i have to order books online which isn&#39;t as easy as browsing in a book store. I would really appreciate it if any of you know where I can find good book recommendations, if you could post the details or email me directly.<br/>
I have loads of other questions to ask, but will wait awhile to see if I am on the right kind of list.<br/>
TIA<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve lived in foreign countries (France and Germany mostly), and it <br/>
can be intimidating, but it can also be an awesome experience if you <br/>
get to know people and get involved even a little bit in their <br/>
culture. I was thrilled to find some French cookbooks the other day <br/>
and have been playing with some of the recipes for foods I grew very <br/>
fond of while over there.<br/>
<br/>
Corfu sounds like an interesting place! Tell us about it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For my kids it was primarily Hot Wheels, Lego Bricks, and Playmobil. <br/>
For much of their childhood we didn&#39;t have (or want) a TV, so they <br/>
developed rather elaborate games that would go on for days with their <br/>
cars and trucks, Playmobil pirates, cowboys, and knights. Were they <br/>
learning? Not that I could tell. But these are the hotshot <br/>
construction foremen I&#39;ve written so much about earlier, so they must <br/>
have been picking up something, somehow.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, we receive a ton of homeschooling books for review here - <br/>
we just received six separate copies of one new title the other day, <br/>
and I&#39;ve been scratching my head trying to figure out what to do with <br/>
the darn things. I could give some of them to the local support group <br/>
for their library - which we will - but they don&#39;t need six copies of <br/>
the same book either. If you&#39;d be interested in some free books send <br/>
me a note offlist &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEM-Editor@...">HEM-Editor@...</a>&gt; and I&#39;ll send you <br/>
a list of the books currently cluttering up my desk. I&#39;ll even have <br/>
our mailroom send them to you no charge, as it&#39;s good enough for me <br/>
to know they&#39;ll be doing someone some good!<br/>
<br/>
Of course that offer extends to anyone else looking for some free <br/>
homeschooling books. First come, first served. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

books she read to her son (or he read later on) between the ages of about 6 <br/>
to 11.  Hope it helps.  I think they&#39;re more or less in the order they read <br/>
them, so the ones at the top would be for a younger child.<br/>

It has annotated book suggestions of different types for different ages. <br/>
Great book. Bet you can get it cheap on half.com, too.<br/>
