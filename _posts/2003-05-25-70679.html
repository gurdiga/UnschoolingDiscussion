 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not a molecular level question.  The original poster made a clear <br/>
contradiction in her post.  I posted the exact lines she said.  Kelly offered an <br/>
explanation.  But, for all practical purposes, what the original post said WAS a <br/>
contradiction.  <br/>
<br/>
NO safety rules means the kid can use any knife to cut anything they want.  <br/>
Maybe the poster meant &quot;with adult supervision&quot;    But, that is still a &quot;rule&quot; <br/>
, or a restriction.  &quot;you can use any knife you want ONLY when an adult can <br/>
help you&quot;   Is that not what most folks on this list would do?   I think when <br/>
someone says &quot;We have NO safety rules&quot;, it sounds like there is no regard for <br/>
the childs safety.   I do not think that is the case at all. <br/>
<br/>
  Lots of words, phrases, perceptions, DO get examined at the molecular level <br/>
on this list.   The truth is, unless one IS a totally non coercive parent, <br/>
they usually have &#39;safety rules&quot;   Do not go in the street, wear a helmet, wear <br/>
a seatbelt, don&#39;t eat poison, don&#39;t take candy from strangers.    What is so <br/>
WRONG about saying &quot;we have safety rules&quot;??  Should they be called something <br/>
other than rules?  Maybe, guidelines?  precautions?   <br/>

My best super-hero power (maybe my only one) is cutting tomatoes.  I can cut <br/>
bread, too, with a good bread knife (or a tomato &lt;g&gt;).  I&#39;m not so great at <br/>
cutting meat (like carving a turkey or whatever) but with a serrated knife I can <br/>
get more slices from a loaf of homemmade bread or a tomato than anyone else I <br/>
know.   <br/>

We have no rules about guns here.<br/>
<br/>
When they were little there were a couple of principles we considered and <br/>
discussed.  Don&#39;t point toy guns at people who aren&#39;t playing, and don&#39;t play toy <br/>
guns when a family&#39;s over in which the mom doesn&#39;t like for her kids to play <br/>
with toy guns.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my kids are bigger, we have no &quot;rule&quot; about guns.  There&#39;s a rifle <br/>
here.  The ammo isn&#39;t with it.  It was inherited from our friend Marty Tufts <br/>
who died before our Marty was ever born.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids would no more mess with that gun than I would go and wear Kirby&#39;s <br/>
underwear on my head while I went down and sold Marty&#39;s Playstation systems at <br/>
the pawn shop without his permission.<br/>
<br/>
When people are first unschooling they want to know all kinds of things.  But <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that longterm unschoolers who are living by principles <br/>
instead of rules have all these stark choices:  EITHER your kid has sliced <br/>
tomatoes, sliced fingers, or there must have been a rule against it.  EITHER you <br/>
prevent something, or the thing is done.<br/>
<br/>
Many things are NOT done even in the absence of prevention.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids have been on the roof, for real purpose and for fun.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
told them not to jump off, yet they have never jumped off.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of families which have begun their mindful parenting early on:<br/>
In the absence of a bunch of rules, the space becomes flooded with a bunch of <br/>
thought and good judgment.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who has a 13 year old boy who just came out of school last week will <br/>
NOT necessarily have, nor might never be able to reach, the same level of <br/>
understanding, and while that&#39;s unfortunate, it still doesn&#39;t mean that such <br/>
situations can&#39;t come about, gradually, consciously and without rules (in the way I <br/>
THINK &quot;rules&quot; is being used here).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904570757">Wow - that&#39;s so true.<br/>
Brianna kind of knows things....she applies common sense and logic to situations much more than her schooled friends do. Her schooled friends sort of plunge into many situations that Brianna just would just simply avoid.<br/>
Her schooled friends have little thinking skills. They need to be told what to do, how to do it......<br/>
An example - Candace is 12 y.o. She is not trusted with a key to her home or a cell phone. She loses them. She&#39;s lost at least four phones.<br/>
She has trouble believing that Brianna can do &quot;anything&quot; during the day - yet Brianna is so much more rounded. <br/>
Then there&#39;s Nicole. She&#39;s 11 y.o. She just wants to get married and have babies. She&#39;s in school until she &quot;grows babies&quot; She doesn&#39;t hang w/ Brianna any more. Brianna thinks she&#39;s silly and shallow.<br/>
<br/>
These kids don&#39;t seem to be able to think, to figure - they&#39;re robots.<br/>
There are weapons around here. Brianna respects them.<br/>
She respects our stock. In stores, she doesn&#39;t pick up stock and leave it elsewhere.<br/>
It&#39;s common sense.<br/>
It&#39;s life.<br/>
It&#39;s unschooling.<br/>

knives. When I worked as a personal chef I became absolutely appalled <br/>
at what people called their cooking knives --that&#39;s why a chef always <br/>
carries her knives. I could understand why people were so frustrated <br/>
with cooking --they not only had not the right basics, in some cases <br/>
they just did not know how to take care of them nor handle them.<br/>
<br/>
There are some truths about the kitchen:<br/>
<br/>
---Always sharpen your knives before working, no matter what you are <br/>
going to cut.<br/>
<br/>
---The acidity in vegetables such as peppers, tomatoes and zuccinni <br/>
dulls a knife in an instant.   I stick to serrated knives especially <br/>
for tomatoes. A paring knife works also best with these veggies --I <br/>
keep my 10&quot; chef knife for other jobs.<br/>
<br/>
---Chef knives are OK for almost everything but once you cut chicken <br/>
with a sharpened boning knife, you&#39;ll never go back to anything else.<br/>
<br/>
---You can never tell what is hot just by looking at it --especially if <br/>
you are moving fast. FLAG everything hot with a kitchen towel.<br/>
<br/>
---Never cook naked :-) My little one is a nudist and the one time he <br/>
has to wear clothes indoors is when we are cooking and the stove is <br/>
involved. I&#39;m actually thinking of getting them chef jackets (they&#39;d <br/>
look adorable in them).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663433972">Sorry. I used &quot;can&#39;t&quot; on a practical, concrete level--their knives <br/>
physically don&#39;t do the job. I honestly didn&#39;t consider that the same <br/>

<br/>
In fact, if either kid wanted to cut tomatoes, I would help him/her do <br/>
it. The knives aren&#39;t kept at kid level, but neither are they <br/>
&quot;forbidden.&quot; It&#39;s just not an issue. They know what knives are and what <br/>

<br/>
Yes, any of them COULD have played guns with pacifist moms&#39; kids, but we <br/>
discussed things before we went somewhere or had company.  Kind of a briefing.  <br/>
Not a &quot;these are the rules,&quot; but &quot;Okay, these guys are vegetarian and they don&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
And it was never &quot;If you say a bad word you&#39;ll be in trouble with me,&quot; it was <br/>
&quot;if you say bad words they might not like you as much after that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was advisement, not rules.<br/>
<br/>
And as to jumping off the roof or not messing with the rifle, I haven&#39;t even <br/>
advised them.<br/>
We have all kinds of saws, from folding handsaws to table saws, but we&#39;ve <br/>
never told them what they can&#39;t cut (for example), and they&#39;ve never cut anything <br/>
weird.<br/>

Sandra, you are my husband&#39;s dream woman, I cut horrible doorstops with the <br/>
bread, and he never misses an opportunity to tell me about  it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really strange.  I&#39;m not the greatest with physical tricks and talents.  <br/>
Friends of mine who are really good at one thing or another (tuning an <br/>
instrument, sword fighting, karate) have talked to me sometimes about how sometime <br/>
when they&#39;re in the flow they&#39;re transformed and the feel the motions in <br/>
another kind of dreamstate (and all this esoteric stuff).  I like those <br/>
conversations, when people attempt to describe things that are beyond words.<br/>
<br/>
The cutting is something I can nearly explain, but it&#39;s not a verbal thing at <br/>
all (duh, of course, but it&#39;s somewhere in the just-outside of me place.  <br/>
(This sounds stupid, I know; sorry.)<br/>
<br/>
I kind of split the difference between staying inside the tomato and slicing <br/>
out of it.  There&#39;s a kind of tension but it&#39;s not so much in my hand or arm, <br/>
it&#39;s in my brain.  I see the outside of the bread, and I see a slice that&#39;s <br/>
thicker than I would like, and I cut halfway between those two just as though <br/>
they were realities.<br/>
<br/>
Same with bread, but for two things:  It HAS to be cold.  Warm bread is <br/>
better just gently and artfully pulled apart.  &quot;Broken.&quot;  But when it&#39;s cold and <br/>
you want to make sandwiches, hold the bread so that the cut part is flat on a <br/>
cutting board or flat counter, so both sides have equal pressure on them.  You <br/>
hold it against something flat, hold the knife parallel to the counter or <br/>
board, and cut it exactly halway between the surface and the too-fat-slice line.  <br/>
Saw it gently, but don&#39;t push.<br/>
<br/>
People describe to me how exactly they do physical things and I nod and I <br/>
wonder, &quot;Does he REALLY think this makes any sense whatsoever?&quot;  So I&#39;ve probably <br/>
just done the same thing to all but five people here.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something like sewing a long boring seam.  Once you get a little bit of <br/>
it right, the trick then is not changing it as time passes.  Halfway between <br/>
holding it tight and just letting it go.<br/>

<br/>
  My cooking skills literally triple just out of knowing how to handle <br/>
  knives. When I worked as a personal chef I became absolutely appalled <br/>
  at what people called their cooking knives --that&#39;s why a chef always <br/>
  carries her knives. I could understand why people were so frustrated <br/>
  with cooking --they not only had not the right basics, in some cases <br/>
  they just did not know how to take care of them nor handle them.<br/>
<br/>
  There are some truths about the kitchen:<br/>
<br/>
  ---Always sharpen your knives before working, no matter what you are <br/>
  going to cut.<br/>
<br/>
  ---The acidity in vegetables such as peppers, tomatoes and zuccinni <br/>
  dulls a knife in an instant.   I stick to serrated knives especially <br/>
  for tomatoes. A paring knife works also best with these veggies --I <br/>
  keep my 10&quot; chef knife for other jobs.<br/>
<br/>
  ---Chef knives are OK for almost everything but once you cut chicken <br/>
  with a sharpened boning knife, you&#39;ll never go back to anything else.<br/>
<br/>
  ---You can never tell what is hot just by looking at it --especially if <br/>
  you are moving fast. FLAG everything hot with a kitchen towel.<br/>
<br/>
  ---Never cook naked :-) My little one is a nudist and the one time he <br/>
  has to wear clothes indoors is when we are cooking and the stove is <br/>
  involved. I&#39;m actually thinking of getting them chef jackets (they&#39;d <br/>
  look adorable in them).<br/>
