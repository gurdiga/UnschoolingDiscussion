<div id="ygrps-yiv-310712267">I have not read all the posts on this topic, but would like to put my <br/>
2 cents in.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 39 years old and just a few weeks ago had the opportunity to <br/>
thank the lady who lived next door to us when we were growing up.  <br/>
She began giggling cause she thought I was going to make reference to <br/>
the little baggie surprises my brother would leave on her doorstep or <br/>
some other of numerous kid sh** that went on between our families (we <br/>
really were close, no really).  But I thanked her instead for the <br/>
hours she spent in the lake with us.  She would put on her swimsuit <br/>
and swim and play with us all afternoon.  She was the one who showed <br/>
me how to float.  <br/>
<br/>
See, I found out a couple of years ago that the reason my mom NEVER <br/>
went in the water with us was because she knew there were snapping <br/>
turtles in the water.  She feared one would grab her/our toes and <br/>
yank us under.  And while it seems illogical that she would allow her <br/>
children to enter the water with such a fear, and she indeed <br/>
hyperventilated every time we went under water, she never told us <br/>
about her fear.  NEVER!  We all swim like fish cause we love to.  We <br/>
(I have 3 siblings) also all love playing with the kids in the <br/>
water.  It makes me appreciate my mom all the more.  I can only <br/>
imagine the agony it took for her to watch from shore while we were <br/>
on the floating dock doing cartwheels off over and over and over.  Or <br/>
when we found a &#39;pocket&#39; under the dock to come up in and hide from <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
On one level it really makes me evaluate my own fears for my children.<br/>
Don&#39;t know if you can find any wisdom in this post, but I felt it was <br/>
a story that needed told.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Very good reminder! I do this often myself, because my son has &quot;no fear&quot;. He <br/>
tends to get in precarious situations and even dangerous (to a degree) ones, <br/>
and sometimes, I just either have to grit my teeth and bite my toungue or turn <br/>
away and not watch. I used to be similar as a child, and I can remember my <br/>
mother&#39;s constant warnings and written instructions on every field trip <br/>
permission slip, and often wonder if it made me more reckless-after all, if I was going <br/>
to get hurt ANYWAY, why not do what I want and have fun while I&#39;m doing it? <br/>
It didn&#39;t make me any safer, just caused friction between us. So I try to keep <br/>
my mouth shut and give Wyl his freedom unless there is a serious actual threat <br/>
to his life , eye or limb (as in severed). It is the hardest part of <br/>
parenting-and something I never imagined before I had a child! LOL How cool that your <br/>
mom could do that for you! Thanks for sharing!<br/>
