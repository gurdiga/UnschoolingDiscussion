<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As my understanding of how my son learns and how I learn develops, the<br/>
&gt; natural side-effect is to consider what I do professionally.  I teach<br/>
&gt; violin, and I&#39;ve been struggling with how I do that.  (I hate the &quot;I<br/>
&gt; teach...&quot; comment, too, and I&#39;m open to suggestions on other ways to say<br/>
&gt; that!  My business card could use a little help, too.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m coming to beleive that most students come to me expecting me to feed<br/>
&gt; knowledge into them, and then they become burned out when I do exactly <br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; (And so do I!)  I was considering it this way: if my son wanted to learn<br/>
&gt; about dinosaurs, I&#39;d probably help him find a couple books on dinosaurs,<br/>
&gt; search for web sites, check out our nearby Natural History museum, buy some<br/>
&gt; model dinosaurs to mess around with, or whatever.  The LAST thing I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; consider doing would be calling someone whom I heard was an expert on<br/>
&gt; dinosaurs and sign him up for weekly &quot;dinosaur lessons&quot;, where he would<br/>
&gt; learn a little bit new each week and then be expected to come home and<br/>
&gt; repeat it over and over and then repeat it back to the expert the next <br/>
&gt; week,<br/>
&gt; perfectly or at least greatly improved!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And yet to some extent, this is what I do for a living.  Somewhere along <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; line, somebody hears a violin, decides they want to learn to do that, and<br/>
&gt; calls me for violin lessons.  And so we begin working through the basics of<br/>
&gt; how you play, etc.  But here&#39;s my problem: they get bored.  It happens to<br/>
&gt; everyone, somewhere down the line.  (Including me, the teacher!  I get <br/>
&gt; kudos<br/>
&gt; for my teaching, I&#39;m a good teacher.  But it&#39;s not thrilling me, either.)<br/>
&gt; Let&#39;s face it, put as above, I&#39;d be bored with dinosaurs in the first <br/>
&gt; month.<br/>
&gt; If we played little games learning the information, had some laughs, etc., <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; might survive for two months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m realizing that somehow, I need my students to see me as a single<br/>
&gt; resource in their quest to learn violin.  That they also need to read,<br/>
&gt; listen, study, experiment, search the internet, etc.  They need to think<br/>
&gt; about why some things work and some things just don&#39;t work for them, and <br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; to fix their own problems.  But how do I get them beyond the &quot;teach me&quot;<br/>
&gt; mentality to learn themselves?  How do I give these people some direction,<br/>
&gt; without it becoming just more assignments that I give for the week, added<br/>
&gt; onto everything else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s so much more to this all jumbled around in my poor little brain<br/>
&gt; tonight, but maybe this works as a start.  Thanks for the help!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My partner takes violin lessons and my son takes guitar lessons from a very <br/>
cool teacher. I&#39;ve noticed a few things she does that seem to work well. <br/>
<br/>
First, her attitude doesn&#39;t seem to be too much I am the Teacher and you are <br/>
the Student. Instead, she acts like both are a couple of people really <br/>
interested in this cool thing, with one having some more experience and skill <br/>
who can share with the other. They are partners learning and playing <br/>
together. It&#39;s a very respectful approach, and is probably more fun for her <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Second, she&#39;s flexible. If my son asks a question or talks about a music <br/>
concept, she doesn&#39;t stress sticking with what she&#39;d have planned. Instead, <br/>
she answers the questions, they experiment together, etc. She noticed my son <br/>
loves to sing, so she adds that in (easier with guitar, of course).<br/>
<br/>
Now, one of my biggest things from having previously taken lessons...I want <br/>
to play REAL songs, other than Twinkle. They can be simplified, they can be <br/>
just parts....but Twinkle gets old.<br/>
<br/>
Now, just let me share that MY job is directing a Unitarian Universalist <br/>
Religious Education program, and I also work really hard at making it as <br/>
not-schooly as possible. It&#39;s hard.<br/>
