 </span></blockquote>    I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a great quote or an awful one, lol.  Mandate for <br/>
teaching?    When my son has a question, we share things with each other until <br/>
we both understand things better, but there are never &quot;teaching sessions&quot;.  <br/>
But that doesn&#39;t  mean that I never ask him questions, or that I never offer <br/>
assistance, either.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like a good quote to understand some part of unschooling, the part <br/>
about child led interest, but not child led learning, and doesn&#39;t do much to <br/>
answer Deniz&#39;s point about concern and assistance.   When I see my child <br/>
struggling with something, I ask him if he needs help.  I accept the answer no <br/>
thanks. But I am  reminding him that I am indeed there if he needs it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s appropriate to let the kid go on having problems if a little one on one <br/>
can help.  <br/>
<br/>
        Right now, Alex has been refusing *all* help.  It could very well be <br/>
in reaction to my offering to help too much. Hey, he&#39;s changing and he needed <br/>
to be clear with me that that was so.  It seems like it happened all of a <br/>
sudden, but of that I couldn&#39;t be sure.  I probably missed the cues. So he told me <br/>
out right.  It has been hard for me not to offer help, and it&#39;s been hard on <br/>
him not to accept any.  ;-)  But this is what he needs right now, and we talk <br/>
a lot, so that&#39;s clear to me, now.<br/>
       <br/>
        I understood instantly when he told me, &#39; I don&#39;t want help&#39; , at <br/>
least part of the process that he&#39;s going thru.  He&#39;s testing out his abilities, <br/>
stretching them to see what he can do next,  and that&#39;s been wonderful.   I <br/>
know being a good mommy right now means trusting this, and keeping half an eye <br/>
on him just in case he changes his mind.  :-) <br/>
<br/>
       We brought two metal folding chairs from my aunt&#39;s house because some <br/>
family members are coming over for dinner.  I went to grab one and ask him to <br/>
grab the other, but he said he wanted to carry both of them.  Half way up the <br/>
stairs he tripped (I think because he couldn&#39;t quite lift them both, at the <br/>
same time, high enough to clear the steps).  I grabbed ahold of the two <br/>
chairs....both sliding down right towards me, of course!  Can you see me, stuff in my <br/>
hands, stretched out both arms to stop the chairs, but I can&#39;t quite reach to <br/>
pick them up???  lol    Stuck there? lol  I looked like I was trying to fly up <br/>
the stairs with chairs as my wings, it was hilarious.  <br/>
<br/>
       One of my neighbors was coming out and grabbed one chair and brought <br/>
it upstairs for me.  My son saw me accepting help and thanking him profusely, <br/>
lol, so maybe he&#39;ll soon catch on that getting help doesn&#39;t mean being weak, <br/>
not a big boy etc. Maybe none of that is involved, and he is just fleshing out <br/>
his understanding of what he&#39;s capable of, alone. <br/>
<br/>
       That&#39;s important to him now, and I&#39;m not going to subvert his process <br/>
with a lot of interference.   I&#39;m not going to ask him constantly if he wants <br/>
help, because he&#39;s been clear that he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
       But there were so many instances where we shared things with each <br/>
other, and helped each other, and those conversations didn&#39;t always start with a <br/>
question from him.  Sometimes they started from a question from me, and I&#39;ve <br/>
never seen a problem with that.  <br/>
  <br/>
   Sorry this got so long, went off on a tangent......I&#39;m really trying to <br/>
reconcile this, and understand this...and see the line between being there for <br/>
him and judging his process by interfering.  <br/>

I suppose the quote is a bit out of context.  It is part of an article<br/>
entitled, &quot;What Makes a Good Teacher?&quot;  I think it is a lead-in for<br/>
those who are so ingrained in the &quot;school&quot; mindset that they need to<br/>
start there.  The whole of the article is too make the point that what<br/>
would be considered a &quot;good teacher&quot; is,  in fact,  one who doesn&#39;t<br/>
teach,  but who facilitates land fosters learning as led by the child<br/>
(or person of any age).  The language is used to communicate with those<br/>
who cannot grasp the whole concept yet...you notice they word *good* is<br/>
in quotes. For the whole article, see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://edheretics.gn.apc.org">http://edheretics.gn.apc.org</a><br/>
