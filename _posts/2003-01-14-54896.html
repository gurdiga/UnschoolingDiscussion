&lt;&lt; Could the difference be, not the amount of controlling or the <br/>
expectations we place upon our children, but the relationships we <br/>
develop with them? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see those as related things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Did the families in scenario 1 apply controlling methods without <br/>
developing a warm, sincere bond with their kids?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s pretty hard to control someone without it costing some trust and love <br/>
and closeness.<br/>
<br/>
If I &quot;trained my kids&quot; to nurse or use the toilet (which I did not, but some <br/>
people like to think they did), if I &quot;taught my kids&quot; to talk or walk (which <br/>
I did not, but some people like to think they did), then I would have <br/>
certainty that I would have to train and teach them every other thing that <br/>
came along.   But I was lucky to learn and discover early on that each child <br/>
has within him the instinct to nurse, the desire to be like the adults around <br/>
him, the urge to try to stand and walk, and that the best I could do was keep <br/>
them clean and happy and give them peaceful experiences and opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
My kids know they can learn things on their own.  They learned to read, just <br/>
by asking questions, watching people read, being read to, goofing around with <br/>
words, seeing words everywhere, on signs, packages, videos (subtitles or <br/>
read-along words), clothing... and because they DID learn to read without <br/>
having lessons and a &quot;reading method,&quot; they have no fear whatsoever of <br/>
learning anything else.  They&#39;re not waiting for me to teach them the next <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
That might&#39;ve seemed like a tangent, but I think it&#39;s a tangent into the core <br/>
of the question of what our role is in making them nice people.<br/>

&quot;You must work with your kids&quot;.  I always tell them it&#39;s never work.  I don&#39;t <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; them anything.  I also get well what curriculum do you use or what <br/>
pre-school do your kids go to?  We don&#39;t use any curriculum, nor do I intend <br/>
to ever do that unless my kid or kids have a strong desire to do so.  They <br/>
don&#39;t attend pre-school and never will attend school, unless they decide they <br/>
want to go to school.  I get a lot of stares and weird looks when I tell them <br/>
that I&#39;m not using any curriculum, do not have nor will never have lesson <br/>
plans, tests or a schedule.  This really frightens people.  I&#39;ve explained <br/>
how my family will live to people who are important to me, others I don&#39;t <br/>
even bother.  It&#39;s very hard for people to get out of the Traditional <br/>
thinking of how children have to learn.  I think it&#39;s a big shame!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, to start with. I&#39;d agree with that. But these kids are <br/>
definitely self-governing. Especially the grown daughter, and the 18 <br/>
year old son, both of whom have had opportunities galore, to go <br/>
haywire, and have not done so. The 11 year old, well, she&#39;s young and <br/>
still staying close to home. But the son, his education has led him <br/>
to leadership positions that require him to travel. He has been in <br/>
Washington D.C. NOT with a chaperoned group of high schoolers, but on <br/>
his own, to receive an award. I think he had some friends with him, <br/>
and probably there were other high school kids receiving this award, <br/>
too (it&#39;s given out to 200 seniors in America) who were there. there <br/>
was stuff going on that would be defined as foolish or wrong...and he <br/>
just wasn&#39;t interested. The kid is self-educating at this point, and <br/>
in a couple of classes at the high school, and is doing wonderfully. <br/>
The other day, my friend found out AFTER the fact,that he had given a <br/>
speech to the mayor and some other dignitaries of her town...and she <br/>
got on his case about not telling her about it. <br/>
<br/>
Sure, there&#39;d be consequences if he chose foolish things, but my <br/>
point is, he&#39;s doing great things even when his mommy isn&#39;t looking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480432690">I am not sure I properly introduced myself since nobody has responded to my<br/>
posts. My name is Deb and I have four sons, Kris (19), Dustin (17), Adam<br/>
(14), and Jameson (11).  I have been married to hubby for 20 years and we<br/>
now live in NC. I went back to school when my boys were very small and did<br/>
undergraduate work in religious studies. I finished my graduate work in<br/>
Princeton where I noticed many of my professors home schooled their children<br/>
(9 year olds frequented my Hebrew and Greek classes regularly).  I decided I<br/>
might try this method of education since I was home during the day most of<br/>
the time. My oldest was 13 at the time and had been in a Catholic school<br/>
until then. Maybe I started to late with the older two because they are not<br/>
nearly as adjusted as the younger two.<br/>
<br/>
My sisters always comment on my against the grain mental state and most of<br/>
my family considers me a renegade idealist from outer space. I tend to take<br/>
my multigrain liberalism to heart and look for methods of escape from<br/>
mainstream reality daily.<br/>
<br/>
I am home schooling for many reasons but one thing clearly stands out in<br/>
regard to mainstream education. This country could not sustain the model of<br/>
economy it does without the conformist model if education used in the<br/>
mainstream system. The worker ant mentality sustains this country and allows<br/>
for 1% of mega wealth to stay in the niches it has been in for over two<br/>
hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted my children learn from loving and nurturing experiences where<br/>
freedom is explored in the truest sense.<br/>
<br/>
My downfall is something I cannot identify and perhaps this is due to the<br/>
confusion I have with my own expectations. My two older sons 17 and 19  are<br/>
not sure which is end is up. I thought providing them with choices and<br/>
unstructured learning might awaken a sense of exploration urging their<br/>
imaginations to new heights. It seems that peers do have influence and my<br/>
sons are moving toward a mainstream example of choice, in that, instead of<br/>
thinking they are just doing.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I knew folks around here who had kids willing to take a step into an<br/>
uncharted realm of discovery, thinking about justice and peace.<br/>
I am in NC. Anybody nearby?<br/>
<br/>
Deb<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783134506">&lt;&lt; What I&#39;m saying is, giving children a scheduled, structured <br/>
upbringing doesn&#39;t equate with disrespect or even lack of freedom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some structure is good for the whole family, not just for the kids. But most of the time it seems that kids have no chance to question it, it&#39;s a given that things are a certain way and that&#39;s it. There are no options. In that sense, there is no freedom to speak of. And if there is no freedom, there is no respect either. The disrespect becomes evident, IMO, when kids are not given options to choose how to learn things in life, because so many other things are more important than their individual process (appearances, parents&#39; desires, family traditions, cultural conformity, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I still maintain, it&#39;s the relationship that makes the difference. <br/>
Kids thrive in a place where they are loved, whether they are <br/>
strictly raised or more permissively raised. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Children thrive where they are loved AND respected and heard, and can freely choose. If you don&#39;t give them the freedom to choose, how can you tell they&#39;re thriving?<br/>
It&#39;s like saying your kids love potatoes when you only give them potatoes.<br/>
Kids&#39;own nature is to love. I&#39;ve seen parents destroy even that, not because parents don&#39;t love them, but because they don&#39;t realize how suppressive their attitudes can be. So, they grow up resenting their parents and feeling guilty about it at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you don&#39;t have your child&#39;s heart, you will never have genuine obedience.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want obedience from your kids, your thoughts may be right. If you want a more wholesome, harmonious and natural relationship, then you need to give them freedom and respect first and foremost.<br/>

needs and desires and outlooks as their parents, then rules are going to<br/>
sound more like sensible advice than roped off forbidden territory.<br/>
<br/>
I was a &quot;good&quot; kid because I didn&#39;t really want to do any of the things<br/>
parents need to forbid their kids from doing. We weren&#39;t close in a<br/>
confiding way, don&#39;t recall any discussions about values though I know I was<br/>
&quot;spoken to&quot; if I did something wrong. I wanted to be good so I figured out<br/>
what was considered good and did that. (Which makes the end of Grease really<br/>
irritating for me because the Hollywood message is too often that being good<br/>
means you&#39;re repressing who you really are.)<br/>
<br/>
But if a kid has the heart of a heavy metal rock star, what will rules about<br/>
the &quot;right way&quot; to grow up and a close relationship with his parents do to<br/>
him? What choices does it give him? Will he suppress who he is and do what&#39;s<br/>
&quot;right&quot; according to his parents? Will he rebel? Will he try to change their<br/>
minds about what the meaning of &quot;right&quot; is?<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re &quot;model kids&quot; then I suspect it&#39;s more because their parents got<br/>
lucky in the genes department than because they had rules.<br/>

<br/>
Society puts our interests at such a low priority that many of us get<br/>
trained to want what we&#39;re supposed to do. We end up thinking we want to go<br/>
to college and get a good job because that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been told we should<br/>
want. And we&#39;ve practiced pushing what we really want to the background for<br/>
when we have nothing else important to do, that we can&#39;t give an honest<br/>
priority to the what we really want.<br/>

What about taking them each on their own out to dinner and share hopes and<br/>
dreams and things you love? Maybe talk about some dreams of your own you<br/>
felt you needed to put on hold to do what you were &quot;supposed to&quot;. The<br/>
message would be even stronger if you were actively seeking out ways to<br/>
pursue those dreams :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I wanted to be good so I figured out<br/>
what was considered good and did that. (Which makes the end of Grease really<br/>
irritating for me because the Hollywood message is too often that being good<br/>
means you&#39;re repressing who you really are.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw the end of Grease as the culmination of a story that started off saying <br/>
&quot;Being a greaser is very cool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Had it started off &quot;Being straight and conservative is really cool&quot; then it <br/>
would&#39;ve ended the other way.<br/>
<br/>
(I know you know that, but it was a piece of art centered around a car race, <br/>
not a neutral analysis of teen development.)<br/>
<br/>
American Grafitti.  Car race with Harrison Ford.  I should rent that and <br/>
watch it again...<br/>
<br/>
Kids have started drag racing.  It goes in phases, like frisbees and <br/>
hackeysacks, but we&#39;re in a drag-race phase, and they use Juan Tabo, a <br/>
six-lane behind our house, in the middle of the night when it&#39;s empty.  Very <br/>
scary to hear.  I don&#39;t like car racing, but I like Harrison Ford.<br/>
