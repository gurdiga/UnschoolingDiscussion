<div id="ygrps-yiv-562114971">We are trying to make the transition from homeschooling to <br/>
Unschooling.  My daughter, Jeri is 7.  She attended private preschool <br/>
and kindergarten and 3 months of public 1st grade.  We started out <br/>
using books given to us by her teacher when we took her out of <br/>
school.  Then I bought a Learn At Home curriculum that seemed fun but <br/>
we had a hard time sticking to the schedule.  We skipped a lot <br/>
because it was too easy or just seemed redundant which resulted in <br/>
frustration.  After that we started picking theme studies that my <br/>
daughter said she was interested in.  We got bored fast doing that. <br/>
Now we are just doing whatever.  I am trying to find a way to explain <br/>
to Jeri what we are doing since she is used to doing &quot;school&quot; and <br/>
really likes to tell people what grade she is in.  Going from all to <br/>
nothing with regard to structure seems like a huge leap even though <br/>
we didn&#39;t have an incredible amount of structure.  She asked me a <br/>
little bit ago what we were doing tomorrow.  She does that every <br/>
night before bed.  I just told her tonight that we were going to do <br/>
stuff.  She said &quot;are we going to do school?&quot;  I just stated <br/>
again, &quot;just stuff&quot;.  She walked away kind of puzzled.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any tips?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Jackie</div>

<br/>
You could make a list, still--just a different kind of list, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
You could say &quot;we&#39;ll have something different for breakfast, and do something <br/>
serious and something fun, and we&#39;ll go for a nature walk and then...  <br/>
(whatever).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe keep a list of things she says she might like to do.  Even vague, like <br/>
cook<br/>
look at a caterpillar with a magnifying glass [inside the house, if possible, <br/>
or in the shade!]<br/>
buy new watercolors<br/>
go to the thrift store<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And as the list gets longer you could plan some days from those wishes, and <br/>
she will have some structure that doesn&#39;t look like school but will lead to <br/>
lots of learning and togetherness.<br/>

(funny, I was just telling my friend that yesterday)  Seems silly I <br/>
didn&#39;t think of that myself.<br/>
