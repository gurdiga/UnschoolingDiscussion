<div id="ygrps-yiv-514527568">Lexie just confessed to her first crush.  I took some deep breaths and <br/>
we talked about it.  I took her very seriously, which is what she <br/>
needed.  I took steps so she can email this boy (he lives too far away <br/>
to see often.)  I didn&#39;t chuckle, I didn&#39;t get the box out to put her in <br/>
until she&#39;s 35, and I kept teasing to a minimum.  I&#39;m proud of myself, I <br/>
certainly didn&#39;t act the way my father, whom I love dearly, would have <br/>
reacted (ie, you can&#39;t like a boy, you&#39;re only eight, those are silly <br/>
feelings, just put them away...)<br/>

That&#39;s cool.  I think it&#39;s much healthier for them to have their crushes and <br/>
admit to them and feel those feelings and fantasize those fantasies than to <br/>
have people say &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot; and then when they&#39;re old enough to do <br/>
something about it their heads are filled with mixed messages and guilt and <br/>
weirdness.   <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll start having clarity long before there&#39;s potential for action!<br/>

This is such a sweet time with them.  Andy who&#39;s 7, has confided two crushes in the last year.  One a little girl (older than him by 1 yr) whose family moved to Alaska last summer, the other is a cousin (my dh Gary&#39;s 1st cousin&#39;s child) who is Andy&#39;s age.  He has a huge crush on the cousin, Sierra, telling us he&#39;s going to marry her someday -- they&#39;ll have 3 little girls for me to take care of and she will nurse all the babies of course! He&#39;s been making plans for their &#39;date&#39; when we get to California for a visit.  Just a few days ago, he made a passing remark about how much he likes an older girl in our homeschool playgroup -- she&#39;s older, very cute and sweet to him (to all the kids really) but he says he could never tell her because she might kiss him or something! <br/>
 <br/>
His new habit is making sure to smooth his hair when we go somewhere, because &#39;we might see a beautiful girl&#39; and he wants to look his best! <br/>
