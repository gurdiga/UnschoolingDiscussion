not as tight so hers loosened up at night at first.  Also if it is shorter it <br/>
tends to loosen up more than if it is longer.  You just need to keep twisting <br/>
it each day for a few days to keep it dreaded.  Also don&#39;t wash it for a <br/>
while.  The washing it will make it looser as well.  After a while it will <br/>
stay just fine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As long as they stay twisted and do not come out they will tighten up.  You <br/>
may have to twist at times as the hair grows.  For the most part it will dred <br/>
on its own.  DO have to be careful if you want a manicured look that they do <br/>
not start to merge together. LOL.  Also check to see what gets in there.  I <br/>
picked out a moth from my friends hair LOL.  Never know what will get stuck <br/>
and if you can&#39;t see the back of your hair you may never know it.  LOL.<br/>
