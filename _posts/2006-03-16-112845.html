<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062757216">Someone named Wendy [missed her last name] from People Magazine just  <br/>
called me.  Preliminary inquiries on an unschooling article.<br/>
I made her listen to my objections about prior articles &quot;balancing&quot;  <br/>
lamely.  Then I talked to her a while.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a family here who might really be interested in being  <br/>
interviewed and photographed?  I&#39;m not even positive she&#39;ll call me  <br/>
back, and I didn&#39;t get e-mail or anything, but if there&#39;s someone  <br/>
photogenic and keen to be quoted, I&#39;d like to make that  <br/>
recommendation if she does call back.<br/>
