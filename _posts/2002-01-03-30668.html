 </span></blockquote>Hi Cindy,<br/>
If you want I can dig up recipes BUT I have found it much easier to just <br/>
cook on the fly. One great cook told me to *smell* the spices and see if <br/>
they would mix with what I&#39;m cooking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really bad at following recipes unless I&#39;m baking.<br/>
<br/>
Soooooo, the basics are all you need.<br/>
<br/>
White sauce for creamy things: heat a small amount of butter, mix a small <br/>
amount of flour (maybe a teaspoon each) and then add some milk and stir <br/>
until it thickens. Once you have this, you can make anything *creamy*.<br/>
<br/>
~Add parmesan and romano for alfredo sauce.<br/>
~Add cheddar or american cheese for mac & cheese sauce (you can cassarole <br/>
this after by pouring in with pasta, and sprinkling a bit of breadcrumbs <br/>
on top.<br/>
~Add some baked (or boiled if in a hurry) garlic and parsley flakes for <br/>
another flavour<br/>
<br/>
Use it to make creamy soups with roasted garlic, potatos (you can make it <br/>
not so creamy with some chicken broth)<br/>
<br/>
Tomato based sauces. You can either make up a bunch of marinara sauce (if <br/>
you want my quick and easy one, just ask, I share!) and freeze it in <br/>
smaller containers for on the fly stuff.. OR you can use some Muir Glen <br/>
ketchup for recipes OR you can get a tube of some really good tomato <br/>
paste... anything to add that tomato taste.<br/>
<br/>
I keep chicken broth available to me for just about everything I cook. <br/>
Its amazing how easy one can whip up meals by using that instead of water.<br/>
<br/>
For example, cook your pasta. You may want to cook a bunch and keep it <br/>
refidgerated for quick dinners. Heat a deep frying pan, add some Muir <br/>
Glen ketchup, some chicken broth and any veggies you got in the freezer. <br/>
A touch of salt/pepper, some basil (I ALWAYS keep a freezer full of basil <br/>
when its available in the summer for all winter long) and voila, you got <br/>
a great dinner.. put parmesan cheese on the table to each to add <br/>
individually.<br/>
<br/>
Being half Italian, parmesan cheese is important to my cooking. So I <br/>
always buy GOOD cheese and either grate it on the fly (its cheaper than <br/>
pre-grated) or I buy it grated when the budget allows. You&#39;ll see your <br/>
sauces and soups make a big change this way.<br/>
<br/>
Francaise sauce is easy with small amount of butter, chicken broth and <br/>
some lemon (either juice from a bottle or fresh).. sometimes I add fresh <br/>
sage for a nice flavour. I cook it seperate from the chicken (just egg <br/>
and flour and sautee with very little olive oil)<br/>
<br/>
Stir fry (you can even use a frying pan for this one)<br/>
High heat, olive oil AFTER pan has heated, chicken slices to brown each <br/>
side, throw in some garlic and a dash of tamari. REAL quick and easy.<br/>
<br/>
You can toss in some steamed veggies after its just about cooked so they <br/>
soak up the juice.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m driving at is a few simple things in the kitchen and you <br/>
can mix and match as you need and then you&#39;ll be cooking on the fly.<br/>
<br/>
staples:<br/>
extra virgin olive oil<br/>
garlic<br/>
chicken broth<br/>
tamari (a type of soy sauce)<br/>
basil<br/>
parsley flakes<br/>
salt/pepper<br/>
tomato (whatever form is easiest for you)<br/>
ginger<br/>
breadcrumbs<br/>
paresan cheese<br/>
lemon juice<br/>
thyme (great for throwing on potatoes, spray with olive oil and bake)<br/>
sage<br/>
butter<br/>
milk<br/>
<br/>
And thats about it. I&#39;ll *rarely* grab anything else.. I just keep mixing <br/>
up combos of the above.<br/>
<br/>
For veggies, we use a lot of green chard, swiss chard, spinich etc. You <br/>
get more bang in vitamins for the bite when using the dark green veggies. <br/>
And well, I&#39;m a firm beleiver in having greens each day.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how you do!<br/>
<br/>
