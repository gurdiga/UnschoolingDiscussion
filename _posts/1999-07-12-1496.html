&lt;&lt; Perhaps I should have stated that I had NO intention of bringing my <br/>
daughter <br/>
 to something like the holocaust museum,etc... Just to bring it up in the <br/>
same <br/>
 respect that we talk about other awful issues-- slavery, etc.  She&#39;s well <br/>
 aware of many stories of slavery, as we in the &quot;deep South&quot;...  I had no <br/>
 intention of showing her pictures, making her watch Schindler&#39;s list, <br/>
reading <br/>
 Anne Frank or anything else.... <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 I should have clarified this... I&#39;m sorry...<br/>

are a lot of &quot;lite&quot; versions.  Definitely needs kid gloves but I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
want to sugar coat anything either.<br/>

 I honestly think a 7 yo is too young to study the Holocaust.  I&#39;m not saying<br/>
 it shouldn&#39;t be mentioned but I think anything much more than that needs to<br/>
 wait. It&#39;s just too horrific.  What you&#39;re interpreting as indifference from<br/>
 your child may be a self-protective mechanism that IMO is entirely<br/>
 justified.<br/>
 <br/>
 My kids and I got into this around age 10, very carefully.  I believe the<br/>
 Holocaust museum in Washington doesn&#39;t recommend visits from people<br/>
 startling much younger than 12 and that sounds right to me.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree and might further add that one of the best resources for study of the <br/>
Holocaust is the Diary of Anne Frank.  It doesn&#39;t have a great deal of truly <br/>
horrific things in it...&quot;just&quot; depictions of prejudice and abuse but it also <br/>
is about the awakening of a teenage girl which, I think, is more appropriate <br/>
for a child of about 12.  Unless you want to cover the Holocaust again at a <br/>
later age, I&#39;d wait.  Do you truly want to expose your child to something <br/>
like  &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot; at age 7?  <br/>
<br/>
Even adults have had turned stomachs about this. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I think I understand the impulse to get your child to learn about <br/>
something important to you.  I asked my daughter to read Little Women when <br/>
she was about 9, I think.  I now think that if we had waited until she was <br/>
about 12 or 13, she would have liked it better and understood it better.  <br/>
It&#39;s going to be difficult to get her to review it now that she&#39;s older...in <br/>
fact, I doubt I&#39;ll try too hard.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck on whatever you decide.<br/>
