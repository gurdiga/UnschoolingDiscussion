<div id="ygrps-yiv-374370579">My daughter is 6 and hates to write as well, though when she wants to she<br/>
will write herself notes (spelled phonetically).  Her handwriting (printing,<br/>
actually) isn&#39;t that great and my mother keeps harping on me to &quot;make&quot; her<br/>
practice. Nope.  I just figure if she wants to she will, or when she&#39;s older<br/>
she&#39;ll learn to type.  If your daughter can write but chooses not to, that&#39;s<br/>
fine.  As long as she can express herself on paper when she wants to.  And<br/>
if she can&#39;t, she&#39;ll ask for help when she wants to.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We unschool because we want to choose the lives we lead, instead of having<br/>
&gt; them decided for us.  We want our children to have the opportunity to do<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; same.  To badly paraphrase Thoreau, there are no philosophers anymore,<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; philosophy teachers.  I think that&#39;s true, and I&#39;d rather be and raise a<br/>
&gt; philosopher.<br/>
&gt; Do your children currently go to pre-school?  If not, and they&#39;re spending<br/>
&gt; their days with you, you are already doing what we do here.  If it feels<br/>
&gt; right now, there&#39;s no reason to believe it won&#39;t feel right when they turn<br/>
&gt; the magic kindergarten age :).  Good luck!  ~Rue<br/>

&gt; Unschoolers,<br/>
&gt;  My wife, Kim Jansen, and I recently moved to the woods were I work<br/>
&gt; as a Challenge Course Manager. We live on site at an Environmental<br/>
&gt; Education Center that serves about 20,000 people a year. We choose<br/>
&gt; the green land for our three boys; Tristan (4 years old), Chase and<br/>
&gt; Devon (2 year old twins). For the last two months we&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; discussing the idea of home schooling and this is our first inquiries<br/>
&gt; to people who are doing the do. Our question is this: Why did you<br/>
&gt; choose to unschool?<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve read information about benefits and other reasons to go this<br/>
&gt; route but we&#39;re eager to hear from people involved right this moment.<br/>
&gt; If you have any other advice or suggested reading please feel free to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ideas and words are all you get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you saw statistics that wouldn&#39;t necessarily apply to your family.  How<br/>
&gt; many people live in the situation you do?  The skills and interests you<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; your wife have will interact with your children&#39;s temperaments and<br/>
interests<br/>
&gt; in ways unique on the planet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We know lots about the problems of school.  Of unschooling, you will get<br/>
&gt; ideas and words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are few endeavors which so many people have shared so freely.  I<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; the best resource (perhaps stating the obvious again, but it&#39;s not obvious<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; everyone here) is to read the library and archives at www.unschooling.com,<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; HEM&#39;s site, at NHEN&#39;s site.  There is a wealth of current information<br/>
added<br/>
&gt; to daily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Read John Holt if you haven&#39;t already.  Teach Your Own is my<br/>
recommendation<br/>
&gt; if you&#39;re only going to read one.  Learning all the Time and Never Too<br/>
Late<br/>
&gt; inspired me too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear Ann,<br/>
&gt; If you have ANY questions about it: condition, manufacturer&#39;s warranty,<br/>
etc. etc.,<br/>
&gt; ask BEFORE you place a bid.  If they don&#39;t answer you back, or don&#39;t give<br/>
an answer<br/>
&gt; that satisfies you, don&#39;t bid.  Wait.  Another item just like it will come<br/>
along.<br/>
&gt; If it turns out not to be what was advertised on the eBay site, try to<br/>
resolve any<br/>
&gt; problems with the seller.  If nothing gets settled to your satisfaction,<br/>
turn them<br/>
&gt; in to  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abuse@...">abuse@...</a>.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Having said all that, most people selling on eBay are wonderful people to<br/>
deal with.<br/>
&gt;  I have bought several items (too many items!) and have only had one bad<br/>
turn.<br/>
&gt; But, ask questions first, bid second.<br/>
&gt; Buttons<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: RE: Ebay<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We bought our digital camera on ebay (and my wedding dress and veil and<br/>
&gt; tiara and all our kids&#39; tuxes and my wedding stationary and and and...).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My rule of thumb is to *only* buy from vendors who have sold a *ton* and<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; have been selling for several months. Also, many times I will write<br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; privately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>
&gt; same product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>
&gt; hassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>
&gt; person&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; a lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a<br/>
good<br/>
&gt; ebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>
&gt; have a lot to lose too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; exactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; it was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>
&gt; and that was *my* error.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>
&gt; after we won the auction) for extras at a lower price. A bag, an extra<br/>
&gt; battery, etc.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; When we read about unschooling it was a &quot;Duh&quot; moment, finally I<br/>
&gt; understood why all of the &quot;education&quot; methods didn&#39;t fit.  Learning can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; be cut up into bits that fit into a curriculum or schedule, it&#39;s like<br/>
&gt; breathing and it&#39;s unavoidable.  I don&#39;t think there is anything more<br/>
&gt; important that I can give my children than the understanding that they<br/>
&gt; have complete control of their learning.  Every time we tell children<br/>
&gt; they must learn this or that and assign a &quot;time&quot; to that learning we tell<br/>
&gt; them they are not capable of learning on their own or even knowing what<br/>
&gt; they need to learn.<br/>

&gt; Hi Vincent and Kim,<br/>
&gt; I always hesitate a bit before answering this question....here is why....<br/>
&gt; I did not choose to nor do I, homeschool for educational reasons.  Ha!<br/>
That<br/>
&gt; usually gets me some strange looks...<br/>
&gt; I remember precisely when I decided I would homeschool.  My oldest son<br/>
(now8)<br/>
&gt; was 2 at the time.  He was running down the hill to the barn laughing and<br/>
&gt; laughing.  It suddenly hit me that he would be going to school in 3 short<br/>
&gt; years possibly earlier!  My heart just collapsed and I couldn&#39;t even think<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the possibility of him going away for the whole day.  I would miss him<br/>
&gt; terribly, he would miss me, and there is always something interesting to<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; on a farm.  He would miss so much life!  That did it, I started<br/>
researching<br/>
&gt; right then.  I read and read and read ect....  I read John Holt, old<br/>
Growing<br/>
&gt; Without Schooling Magazines, Old Home Education Magazines, and every book<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; saw mentioned in the back of other books.  I specifically drawn to John<br/>
Holt<br/>
&gt; and Grace Llewellyn.  I learned from everything I read though.  It made me<br/>
&gt; see how diverse homeschooling can be.<br/>
&gt; I also researched the laws for my state during this time.<br/>
&gt; I also looked into support groups, and made contact with a local one.  It<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; interesting to talk to everyone but my sons (we had added one during this<br/>
&gt; time) were much too young to do much.  I then renewed contact later when<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; three of my kids were older.<br/>
&gt; I still read and read....  I still talk and talk....  It helps to share.<br/>
&gt; I hope this helps you...and enjoy your family.  That is what we do mostly.<br/>
&gt; Ann<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was wondering what your favorite source for encouragement is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For me, part of my encouragement just comes from watching my kids and<br/>
&gt; how they learn. They each learn in their own individual way and just<br/>
&gt; look at the things they have mastered in their relatively short<br/>
&gt; lives! Acquiring human language has to be the single most difficult<br/>
&gt; task we ever accomplish in our lives, and we do it before we&#39;re 2 or<br/>
&gt; 3 years old with no formal instruction whatsoever and each of us does<br/>
&gt; it in our own way, some kids speaking just nouns for a year and then<br/>
&gt; adding verbs, some kids not talking for years and then coming out<br/>
&gt; with whole sentences. When I see this, I know that if we just apply<br/>
&gt; the same encouraging, yet hands-off principle to all other learning,<br/>
&gt; our kids will do just fine at whatever they put their ambition to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And for external motivation, you can&#39;t beat a good John Holt book, he<br/>
&gt; wrote a dozen or so and they&#39;re all great.<br/>

&gt; curriculum and unit studies.  A comment was made that implied that the<br/>
&gt; murders wouldn&#39;t have happened &quot;if the children had been in school where<br/>
&gt; they belonged.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMHO it is disgusting, to begin with, that reports can&#39;t let people alone<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; a time like this.  It is doubly disgusting that comments such as the one<br/>
&gt; above were made.  And now, of course, every dime store shrink and his<br/>
uncle<br/>
&gt; will be debating PPD!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lynda<br/>
&gt; If Ignorance Is Bliss Why Aren&#39;t More People Happy?<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am new to this list and subscribed because I am<br/>
&gt; interested in the opinions of other unschooling moms<br/>
&gt; and how your children have learned writing skills.  We<br/>
&gt; unschool in the sense of trusting that our children<br/>
&gt; will know when they are ready to take on tasks and<br/>
&gt; following their lead for what they want to learn and<br/>
&gt; how they want to learn it.  My daughter is nine this<br/>
&gt; month and took off on reading about 6 months ago.  She<br/>
&gt; spends a fair amount of time reading both fiction and<br/>
&gt; non-fiction, but also still loves to spend time with<br/>
&gt; her various critters and engage in make-believe play<br/>
&gt; with her sibling and other children.  She loves to<br/>
&gt; draw, but she HATESs to write.  If she wants to leave<br/>
&gt; herself a note, for example, to bring her tortoise in<br/>
&gt; for the night instead of writing out the words she<br/>
&gt; will draw a picture of the tortoise grazing and post<br/>
&gt; that where it reminds her.  I have been fine with this<br/>
&gt; approach and have trusted that when she is at a point<br/>
&gt; in her life where she wants to truly express her<br/>
&gt; feelings she will feel compelled to write.  I have<br/>
&gt; kind of expected this will happen in adolescence.<br/>
&gt; Recently an event happened that is causing me to<br/>
&gt; question my judgement.  Has anyone else out there left<br/>
&gt; it up to divine providence that their children will<br/>
&gt; indeed want to, and then proceed to, learn to write<br/>
&gt; when they are ready?   Has anyone any regrets about<br/>
&gt; not being more proactive with their child in teaching<br/>
&gt; writing?  Thanks in advance for any input.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tammy<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  Our question is this: Why did you<br/>
&gt;  choose to unschool? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      I started off believing in the idea of public education and became<br/>
&gt; disallusioned with it after some negative experiences.  When I first<br/>
started<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, I was not an unschooler and had never even heard about it.<br/>
&gt; But I disliked the other kind of homeschooling because it was always<br/>
coercive<br/>
&gt; learning and the thing is, what do you do if you tell the kids to do a<br/>
math<br/>
&gt; paper or write something and an hour later they&#39;re still sitting there<br/>
&gt; thinking about other things?  Some of my kids were this way.  So then you<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; into the &quot;discipline&quot; issues, meaning threats or blackmails, and it just<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; felt wrong to me.<br/>
&gt;      When I found out about unschooling, it really appealed to me and we<br/>
&gt; gradually moved more and more in that direction.  At first I was afraid<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t learn anything (a common concern) but I found that they learn<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; their way than they ever did before.  They read a lot and each have their<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; unique interests.<br/>
&gt;      I have five boys, ages 4, 9, 13, 13, and 17.  My 9 year old has some<br/>
&gt; learning difficulties and at times I have worried that he might need more<br/>
&gt; structured learning but he seems to be making some huge jumps lately.  My<br/>
17<br/>
&gt; year old just passed the California High School Proficiency test so he has<br/>
&gt; the legal equivalent of a diploma now.  The kids value their freedom and<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like me to schedule too many activities for them because they like<br/>
&gt; having a lot of time.<br/>
&gt;     I have no regrets whatsoever and only wish that I had known to<br/>
unschool a<br/>
&gt; long time ago.  It would have saved my oldest son from some lousy<br/>
experiences<br/>
&gt; with his kindergarten and second grade teachers.  He was always a<br/>
daydreamer<br/>
&gt; and has become a very thoughtful and creative person but that wasn&#39;t<br/>
valued<br/>
&gt; in school.<br/>
&gt;      Your situation sounds incredibly interesting and I hope that you will<br/>
&gt; post more about what you do there.  Best wishes with all that you decide<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; do...<br/>

&gt; Tammy,<br/>
&gt;   I am definetly not an expert in this area - but here is my 2 cents.<br/>
&gt;   My oldest wrote at an early age - part of that was from attending ps for<br/>
2<br/>
&gt; years.  However her penmanship is horrible.  My 2nd child - my son, I<br/>
waited<br/>
&gt; till he was about 7 to attempt writing.  We did the &quot;Teach Your Child to<br/>
&gt; Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot; - it worked for him.  His penmanship is nice and<br/>
&gt; neat.  We also used the &quot;A Reason for Writing&quot; lessons.<br/>
&gt; My 3rd child is a lefty - I tried &quot;Teach Your Child&quot; method with her, we<br/>
&gt; both would end up frustrated.  I decided to allow her to do as she<br/>
wanted -<br/>
&gt; no lines, no forced writing.  She is not writing fluently, well she can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even write her name - but she is interested in learning because it is what<br/>
&gt; she wants to do, not what I am forcing her to do.  I will write something<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a piece of paper and she will copy it on another piece.<br/>
&gt; You might try asking your daughter if she would like to put some of her<br/>
&gt; &quot;make-believe&quot; stories in a book, and let her illustrate it also.    Kate<br/>

&gt; Hi Tammy,<br/>
&gt; Elly (7yo), Has numeruos pen pals, which has really helped her, right now<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; do the formal writing but she does the rough draft. She will read for me,<br/>
&gt; but no one else, ( my mom and family has tried to convince her she should<br/>
&gt; already know how to read and shame on her mommy ;),<br/>
&gt; so she trusts me, her daddy too at times but no one else. Right now her<br/>
&gt; writing skills are pretty basic, her spacing, capitilization (sp), etc are<br/>
&gt; very rough. I dont mind, she knows more on other things than kids twice<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; age so....... Things like this used to worry me, but now, that I have seen<br/>
&gt; her learning life&#39;s skills all by herself and with some inquistive<br/>
&gt; questions, I am prretty much comfy with the fact that she will learn what<br/>
&gt; she needs to, when she needs to!<br/>
&gt; Indiana Tami-no sleep for over 24 hrs. so very rambling :)<br/>
