He used to be a baby.  I used to carry him around when he was  <br/>
teensy.  Look at him now, nineteen years old.<br/>

He looks so happy, doing things with<br/>
dedication. He is in the moment, is he not ?<br/>
<br/>
The athmosphere of the place has some<br/>
sort of harmony in it.<br/>
Unlike what I experienced where I worked<br/>
when I was 19.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing !<br/>

<br/>
Always.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting dynamic:  Our whole family was at a conference, and girls  <br/>
were bristling over who was most with Kirby (just being not doing  <br/>
anything particular), and some of the moms were saying &quot;oooh, Kirby,&quot;  <br/>
and I said &quot;Marty!  Marty&#39;s the good one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have adult friends who know me and Keith both and have since we  <br/>
were young and childless.  Those who like Keith best think Marty&#39;s  <br/>
the star of our show.  Those who like me better seem to think Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
all that.<br/>
<br/>
I like Keith too!   And &quot;as they say&quot; (&quot;they,&quot; who say things),  <br/>
people are critical of those traits most like their own embarrassing  <br/>
traits.  So I see me in Kirby and I wish him to get better.  LOL.   <br/>
And in Marty, I see Keith, only Keith without the family Keith grew  <br/>
up in, without having been treated as Keith was, without having been  <br/>
teased at school for being overweight as Keith was, without having  <br/>
two mean older brothers as Keith had...  Marty is like new-improved  <br/>
Keith!  So the people who wonder why I married Keith would wonder why  <br/>
I doat on Marty.<br/>
<br/>
Holly looks like a couple of my cousins, and like some of Keith  <br/>
secondary relatives, too, we&#39;re told.  Maybe she&#39;s a package of  <br/>
recessives we won&#39;t identify with so closely.  When the kids were all  <br/>
babies, we knew Kirby was like me and my relatives, and Marty was  <br/>
like Keith&#39;s and his, and Holly was always a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some confession for you!<br/>
