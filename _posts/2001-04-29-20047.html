<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318932547">Hi,<br/>
I have a sil who schools at home.  She is on the road to becoming more<br/>
relaxed as time goes by.  She has even decided that it might not be a big<br/>
deal if her kids do not get a diploma and that college will still work out<br/>
for them without one.  Her biggest fear is that they will not learn to write<br/>
a decent paper or get enough English to survive college.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if she had any of her own high school papers and she did.  She<br/>
said they were atrocious, yet she got B&#39;s on them.  I told her to look at<br/>
them and expect that that is how an average student wrote a paper in that<br/>
grade if she got B&#39;s.  Anyway, my other thought was for her to give her<br/>
children&#39;s papers to me or another adult who like to read and write to have<br/>
them go over them and point out where the child could improve in his/her<br/>
writing.  And, that as long as the child is improving she shouldn&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
I also mentioned that it is much easier to write about something you love or<br/>
are very interested in, instead of a prescribed topic.  I was wondering if<br/>
an of you have any other thoughts or words of wisdom for her to help quell<br/>
her fears. Esp. those of you who have children who have been through the<br/>
high school years unschooling. Her kids are 7th and 8th grade right now and<br/>
she is thinking about giving them high school courses and letting them work<br/>
through them at their own pace, as she has heard that most of jr. high is<br/>
repetition of what they learned in grade school.  Her kids are very bright<br/>
and I don&#39;t think this would be too difficult for them.<br/>

and she had something to say. She was never assigned a project to <br/>
write about. She read voraciously and learned how to articulate on <br/>
paper from her reading. Looking for signs of improvement in a child&#39;s <br/>
writing is missing the joy of the writing itself. If the child wants <br/>
another adult to read and criticize the writing then that would be <br/>
fine. Writing is very personal and to pass someone else&#39;s writing on <br/>
for corrections is rather rude in my opinion. <br/>
<br/>
Laurie now writes at every opportunity. All of her papers for classes <br/>
have received excellent marks. I feel that is because she loves to <br/>
write. Writing was always something for HER pleasure, not something <br/>
to be judged by me or anyone else. She has decided to write a <br/>
response to my book showing her side of being raised in the <br/>
unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
Relaxing and trusting your child to learn what they need. There&#39;s no <br/>
better way. <br/>

<br/>
I get so caught up in my writing at times that I forget to say what I <br/>
really wanted to say. :-)<br/>
<br/>
When Laurie went to register for college they told her she needed a <br/>
GED. I said, &quot;No, she doesn&#39;t. She was homeschooled. Please sign her <br/>
up for the college entrance exam.&quot; They looked perplexed at me but <br/>
did as I said. I think &#39;acting&#39; like I knew what I was talking about <br/>
helped. <br/>
<br/>
She had never seen a textbook or taken a test before the college <br/>
entrance exam. No curriculum, no grades, no workbooks...just did as <br/>
she pleased. She scored in the top 10% overall, top 5% in English and <br/>
Reading. <br/>
<br/>
Soooooo glad that she didn&#39;t waste 12 years sitting in a desk in <br/>
school!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263176685">Personally, I agree with you 100 percent Valerie.  Unfortunately my sil<br/>
hasn&#39;t quite come around to the unschooling philosophy. I was looking for<br/>
something that will help her in the path she is on.  Maybe some stories like<br/>
your own where your daughter did well in college but wasn&#39;t forced to write<br/>
at home or some other more relaxed approach other than curriculum driven<br/>
like she is now.  My sil doesn&#39;t feel like she is a good writer therefore<br/>
she doesn&#39;t feel qualified to assess her children&#39;s work.  I am afraid her<br/>
children will always be assessed because she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable any<br/>
other way.  It would be nice to ease her mind though and help her to relax<br/>
and let the learning happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571753052">As I said, Laurie was never forced to write as a child. She wrote <br/>
when and if she felt like it. She taught herself to type and was soon <br/>
typing 75 words a minute. We think differently when we type as <br/>
opposed to how we think when we are using pen and paper. Does your <br/>
sil let the kids use the computer/typewriter? <br/>
<br/>
I had no confidence in my writing skills until I began college at age <br/>
43. I soon found out I was fairly good at writing, but mainly I found <br/>
out that writing is my passion. Laurie&#39;s writing surpasses mine by a <br/>
long shot. She has never made a B on a paper, only A&#39;s. She LOVES to <br/>
write and I think it is because she was never forced. (She is editing <br/>
my book by the way). :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure why what we did worked so well. She loves algebra, <br/>
statistics, biology, theatre, English...all of it. I have to believe <br/>
that is was because she was always free to choose what she learned. <br/>
She chose to go to college, she chooses her courses, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Does your sil ever write for fun? If so, she could compare how she <br/>
feels about her writing when it&#39;s for fun as opposed to when she has <br/>
to write something to the insurance company or something like that. <br/>
<br/>
I know how you feel. I wish I could get everyone to realize how much <br/>
stress is put upon kids and adults by needlessly forcing them to do <br/>
something that they have no interest in. Laurie absolutely detested <br/>
math and could not understand the simplest of procedures. She would <br/>
ask me to show her how to do simple multiplication, but she would be <br/>
frustrated in minutes and we&#39;d put it aside. I knew she&#39;d learn math <br/>
when the time was right for HER. Once she began college, she went <br/>
into the remedial college math courses and made all 100&#39;s BECAUSE she <br/>
wanted to do well. She is now in her third statistics course and NO <br/>
statistics were required for her major. She just loves it! Her <br/>
professor told me, &quot;Laurie is quite gifted in math.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep thinking about this and see if I can remember any <br/>
incidences in particular about writing. Oh, when she did write as a <br/>
child and made errors, I never told her. She found them all herself <br/>
later. Now her friends call her Ms. Dictionary and she&#39;s a <br/>
grammatical wiz.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159931297">Unfortunately my sil is not the type who has any other passion than for her<br/>
children.  She is a very good friend, but not one who stimulates my mind<br/>
with deep conversation.  She is the most sincere person I know and would do<br/>
anything for me, but she does not read for pleasure or write for pleasure<br/>
and has no hobbies that she has time for (or makes time for) with 5 children<br/>
from ages 10 months-13 years.  She is not someone who reads about<br/>
unschooling and goes &quot;Wow! that makes sense!&quot;  Her two oldest children were<br/>
in school until two years ago and she is not yet out of the schooled frame<br/>
of mind. (Even though she thought public school was a waste of time)  I<br/>
never stop telling her about unschooling and how much my children are<br/>
learning naturally, but I think she thinks it is just because my children<br/>
are gifted and wouldn&#39;t necessarily work for her children, though they are<br/>
very bright.  Her children hate to sit and do their work and I don&#39;t think<br/>
she can see past that fact to the point where if it were NOT forced they<br/>
would learn because they would love to and would follow their own interests<br/>
and that in that course of life, they would learn all they need to.  For me<br/>
it is so obvious.  I mean after reading about unschooling, I thought, &quot;Well,<br/>
that was really obvious, I wonder why I didn&#39;t discover it on my own!  There<br/>
is no other path that I could take and still be following my heart!&quot;  None<br/>
the less, she is very worried about their English.  She is considering<br/>
hiring a tutor when they begin freshman English.  Her son is an avid reader.<br/>
That boy always has a book in his hand. (not a curriculum book though)  I<br/>
keep telling her that with all his reading he will just know if something<br/>
sounds right or not.  When I read what I have written aloud, I can tell when<br/>
it doesn&#39;t read smoothly and I change it.  I just wish I could help her to<br/>
understand unschooling more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293925875">I will reply tomorrow Angela...but wanted to get these websites to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
One is for Summerhill, a private free school in England. Summerhill <br/>
is the book that I read while still pregnant that decided Laurie&#39;s <br/>
childhood for me. If your sil could read this book, she would stop <br/>
all mandatory teaching. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The other is for Sudbury Valley School. It was on 60 Minutes tonight. <br/>
I just talked to Laurie on the phone and she caught it. She almost <br/>
never watches television, so this was phenomenal.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the sites if you haven&#39;t already seen them. There are other <br/>
Sudbury inspired schools that can be found in Yahoo search engine.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, <br/>

There is a reason that your sil hasn&#39;t seen the light yet. Maybe you <br/>
or all of us have something to learn from these people??? Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just a chance for you to practice convincing others to unschool? Get <br/>
really good at it so you can go on the Oprah show with me to promote <br/>
my book!!!  (I&#39;m dreaming now)<br/>
<br/>
If her son reads, he&#39;ll do great with essays in college. Reading is <br/>
the secret to learning, although for us unschoolers it&#39;s not such a <br/>
secret. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully my book will be out soon and she&#39;ll read it and see proof <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180862838">I would love to read a book about a grown unschooler.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily use the cap and gown as evidence that it works, though.  College<br/>
is not the goal of our unschooling journey.  So while it may convince<br/>
someone who doesn&#39;t believe in unschooling that it can &quot;work&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
appeal to me as someone who is already living the life.  I would love a book<br/>
that shows that unschooling makes for a happier house and a closer family -<br/>
maybe a picture of you and your daughter.   I guess it depends on your<br/>
target audience :).  Good luck ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1440763714">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am Laurie, Valerie&#39;s daughter.  I agree with you that college <br/>
should not be a universal goal, although it has been one of the best <br/>
experiences of my life.  I do believe that while the cap and gown <br/>
picture probably shouldn&#39;t be on the cover of Mom&#39;s book, it should <br/>
be included somewhere because it&#39;s very tangible proof to skeptics <br/>
that an unschooled kid can do anything that a schooled kid can do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s going to be hard for us to subvert the authoritarian traditions <br/>
of childrearing, and it can only help to have examples of <br/>
unschoolers&#39; successes in an area that virtually everyone respects: <br/>
College.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that I was unschooled.  My life is just as rich as any <br/>
of my peers&#39;, and I didn&#39;t have to go through K-12 school to get <br/>
there.  I didn&#39;t even get a high school equivalency and I&#39;m in the <br/>
very top academic percentile at my college, but more importantly, I&#39;m <br/>
having great fun doing what I want.  Pretty sweet deal.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the great relationship with my mom, Valerie...  :)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has questions for me, please feel free to ask.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031464289">Hi Rue,<br/>
<br/>
College was not the intent of our unschooling either. I was taken <br/>
totally by surprise when she announced one day that she wanted to try <br/>
college. (I think it surprised her too) <br/>
Even though she is making a 4.0, that is not the point to me. The <br/>
point is that she loves to learn...in fact she is hungry to learn <br/>
everything that she can. <br/>
<br/>
You are right that it might convince someone who doesn&#39;t believe in <br/>
unschooling. I&#39;m wondering if this is the audience I SHOULD be <br/>
targeting. Do I preach to the believers or the nonbelievers? I want <br/>
the unbelievers to know that anything is possible with unschooling <br/>
and college is the one thing that the naysayers doubted in my <br/>
experience. <br/>
<br/>
One of the main points of my book is that parents and children can be <br/>
friends. It&#39;s as much the focus as the unschooling is. She and I have <br/>
been best of friends all of her life. In light of this, I think you <br/>
might be closer on target with a pic of the two of us on the cover.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your feedback...you really got me to thinking! :-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1381132896">Valerie and Anyone following this,<br/>
I spent the day with my sil today.  I think I actually made some head way,<br/>
but it isn&#39;t going to hit her like a ton of bricks like it did us, from<br/>
reading one book.  I printed out what you and others said, including letters<br/>
from another list and I brought them to her to read.  We discussed some of<br/>
her fears and talked about how the kids will learn what they need to learn<br/>
and even if they get to college and don&#39;t know how to write a paper at<br/>
first, that they will learn because first year English in college is all<br/>
about how to write papers correctly.<br/>
<br/>
While I was there, her son was doing his math.  He was finding common<br/>
denominators and since he understood how to get the answer it was all busy<br/>
work.  I suggested he use a calculator and after asking his mom she said yes<br/>
it was ok.  Boy, I just saved a whole tree from being scrap paper not to<br/>
mention the time it was taking him to do the basic math.  I asked her why<br/>
she doesn&#39;t let him skip the busywork and she said he likes it.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
get a chance to ask him if he would do it if he didn&#39;t feel like he had to.<br/>
Maybe next visit.  I am going to lend her my &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;<br/>
as soon as I get it back from another person I lent it to.<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard time trying to convince someone to do anything.  I don&#39;t want<br/>
to hurt people&#39;s feelings because I feel that by promoting what I believe in<br/>
so strongly, I am criticizing what they are already doing.  I don&#39;t mind<br/>
giving examples of what works for us, but my kids are only 4 and 6 and so<br/>
she can&#39;t relate with her 12 and 13 year olds.  She did say today, that she<br/>
can&#39;t wait to have one kid grown up and on his way so that she can see how<br/>
it all ends.  She is very afraid of screwing them up for life.  Personally,<br/>
I think sending them to school could screw them up for life.    I AM making<br/>
head way, but the reward is slow in coming.  She is a person who listens to<br/>
what is said and spends a lot of time mulling it over, so there is not<br/>
instant gratification for me.  This summer we will spend a lot of time<br/>
together camping and maybe I can talk some more.  She isn&#39;t a big reader so<br/>
I can&#39;t just give her a bunch of books to read and discuss them with her.<br/>
Wish me luck.<br/>

     I think it might be good to kind of reel in some unbelievers or even <br/>
those who are just kind of unsure by sharing the point that your daughter is <br/>
doing so well in college, which is THEIR idea of success.  From there, you <br/>
can always go into some of the ideas that our society has about success and <br/>
explain that college wasn&#39;t the point or goal of unschooling, that it is a <br/>
good path for Laurie right now but we all have to find our own best match <br/>
(sadly, few people do in our regimented society).<br/>

child.  The only books I&#39;ve found have been about extraordinary children<br/>
doing extraordinary things, and seem to be trying to prove that<br/>
home/unschooling breeds genius.  A book that tells the story of parents and<br/>
children sharing their lives would be great, and I&#39;d love to be able to pass<br/>
it to my friends and family and say, this is what we&#39;re doing, this is why<br/>

Hi Rue,<br/>
<br/>
College was not the intent of our unschooling either. I was taken<br/>
totally by surprise when she announced one day that she wanted to try<br/>
college. (I think it surprised her too)<br/>
Even though she is making a 4.0, that is not the point to me. The<br/>
point is that she loves to learn...in fact she is hungry to learn<br/>
everything that she can.<br/>
<br/>
You are right that it might convince someone who doesn&#39;t believe in<br/>
unschooling. I&#39;m wondering if this is the audience I SHOULD be<br/>
targeting. Do I preach to the believers or the nonbelievers? I want<br/>
the unbelievers to know that anything is possible with unschooling<br/>
and college is the one thing that the naysayers doubted in my<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main points of my book is that parents and children can be<br/>
friends. It&#39;s as much the focus as the unschooling is. She and I have<br/>
been best of friends all of her life. In light of this, I think you<br/>
might be closer on target with a pic of the two of us on the cover.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your feedback...you really got me to thinking! :-)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; There is a reason that your sil hasn&#39;t seen the light yet. Maybe you<br/>
&gt; or all of us have something to learn from these people??? Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just a chance for you to practice convincing others to unschool? Get<br/>
&gt; really good at it so you can go on the Oprah show with me to promote<br/>
&gt; my book!!!  (I&#39;m dreaming now)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If her son reads, he&#39;ll do great with essays in college. Reading is<br/>
&gt; the secret to learning, although for us unschoolers it&#39;s not such a<br/>
&gt; secret.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hopefully my book will be out soon and she&#39;ll read it and see proof<br/>
&gt; that it works. That&#39;s what I truly hope to accomplish with the book.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re thinking about putting a pic of Laurie in her college cap and<br/>

<br/>
I do wish you good luck in convincing your sil...for the sake of her <br/>
kids. Maybe you could print out a few of Laurie&#39;s posts from today <br/>
and show her? Just the intelligent one...not the smart aleck ones. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I was exactly the same way you were when Laurie was young. I was <br/>
afraid of offending others when I told about the unschooling. As she <br/>
got a bit older, I decided this shouldn&#39;t be a secret. I still used a <br/>
bit of diplomacy though, especially with my sister who is a school <br/>
teacher. She now has two young boys and told me that she is sometimes <br/>
afraid of letting me down because of the conventional childhood her <br/>
boys are having. She&#39;s a great mom, but VERY stressed and uptight <br/>
with herself. <br/>
<br/>
School doesn&#39;t screw up your entire life...I managed to straighten <br/>
mine out in less than thirty years!  :-)<br/>

would be appropriate for your sil to read. <br/>

&gt; about how to write papers correctly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I was there, her son was doing his math.  He was finding <br/>
common<br/>
&gt; denominators and since he understood how to get the answer it was <br/>
all busy<br/>
&gt; work.  I suggested he use a calculator and after asking his mom she <br/>
said yes<br/>
&gt; it was ok.  Boy, I just saved a whole tree from being scrap paper <br/>
not to<br/>
&gt; mention the time it was taking him to do the basic math.  I asked <br/>
her why<br/>
&gt; she doesn&#39;t let him skip the busywork and she said he likes it.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get a chance to ask him if he would do it if he didn&#39;t feel like he <br/>
had to.<br/>
&gt; Maybe next visit.  I am going to lend her my &quot;Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook&quot;<br/>
&gt; as soon as I get it back from another person I lent it to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a hard time trying to convince someone to do anything.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt; to hurt people&#39;s feelings because I feel that by promoting what I <br/>
believe in<br/>
&gt; so strongly, I am criticizing what they are already doing.  I don&#39;t <br/>
mind<br/>
&gt; giving examples of what works for us, but my kids are only 4 and 6 <br/>
and so<br/>
&gt; she can&#39;t relate with her 12 and 13 year olds.  She did say today, <br/>
that she<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t wait to have one kid grown up and on his way so that she can <br/>
see how<br/>
&gt; it all ends.  She is very afraid of screwing them up for life.  <br/>
Personally,<br/>
&gt; I think sending them to school could screw them up for life.    I <br/>
AM making<br/>
&gt; head way, but the reward is slow in coming.  She is a person who <br/>
listens to<br/>
&gt; what is said and spends a lot of time mulling it over, so there is <br/>
not<br/>
&gt; instant gratification for me.  This summer we will spend a lot of <br/>
time<br/>
&gt; together camping and maybe I can talk some more.  She isn&#39;t a big <br/>
reader so<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t just give her a bunch of books to read and discuss them <br/>
with her.<br/>
&gt; Wish me luck.<br/>

&gt;   There is a reason that your sil hasn&#39;t seen the light yet. Maybe <br/>
you<br/>
&gt;   or all of us have something to learn from these people??? Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   just a chance for you to practice convincing others to unschool? <br/>
Get<br/>
&gt;   really good at it so you can go on the Oprah show with me to <br/>
promote<br/>
&gt;   my book!!!  (I&#39;m dreaming now)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If her son reads, he&#39;ll do great with essays in college. Reading <br/>
is<br/>
&gt;   the secret to learning, although for us unschoolers it&#39;s not such <br/>
a<br/>
&gt;   secret.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hopefully my book will be out soon and she&#39;ll read it and see <br/>
proof<br/>
&gt;   that it works. That&#39;s what I truly hope to accomplish with the <br/>
book.<br/>
&gt;   We&#39;re thinking about putting a pic of Laurie in her college cap <br/>
and<br/>
&gt;   gown on the cover.  What do ya think?   Too pretentious?<br/>

&gt; Hi Rue,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; College was not the intent of our unschooling either. I was taken<br/>
&gt; totally by surprise when she announced one day that she wanted to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>try<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; college. (I think it surprised her too)<br/>
&gt; Even though she is making a 4.0, that is not the point to me. The<br/>
&gt; point is that she loves to learn...in fact she is hungry to learn<br/>
&gt; everything that she can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are right that it might convince someone who doesn&#39;t believe in<br/>
&gt; unschooling. I&#39;m wondering if this is the audience I SHOULD be<br/>
&gt; targeting. Do I preach to the believers or the nonbelievers? I want<br/>
&gt; the unbelievers to know that anything is possible with unschooling<br/>
&gt; and college is the one thing that the naysayers doubted in my<br/>
&gt; experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the main points of my book is that parents and children can <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; friends. It&#39;s as much the focus as the unschooling is. She and I <br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; been best of friends all of her life. In light of this, I think you<br/>
&gt; might be closer on target with a pic of the two of us on the cover.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I appreciate your feedback...you really got me to thinking! :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would love to read a book about a grown unschooler.  I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
