<div id="ygrps-yiv-16341247">I&#39;m not sure this is exactly the right place for this but please if<br/>
any of you could point me in any directions for more information and<br/>
facts I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Are people who don&#39;t have a college degree at a marked disadvantage in<br/>
our society?<br/>
<br/>
Is it getting harder and harder to get accepted into colleges?<br/>
<br/>
I understand that some of this is subjective. I tend to answer the<br/>
questions &quot;no&quot; and &quot;no&quot; but many people around me, including my<br/>
husband, would disagree with me on both counts.<br/>
<br/>
From stuff that I&#39;ve read, I thought that if you discounted the big<br/>
name colleges and universities that supposedly *everybody* wants to<br/>
get into, there were plenty of colleges out there that anyone who<br/>
really wants to go could get themselves admitted to. My husband<br/>
disagrees with me and says that getting accepted into any college is<br/>
getting harder and harder and more competitive.<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s right? And where could I go to find out some information on<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are two parts to this I think:<br/>
Employment-wise, not as much anymore - it was for a while but I <br/>
think the dawn of the Web generation has changed that. You&#39;ve got <br/>
entrepreneurs like Bill Gates (who dropped out to spend more time <br/>
developing a little company called Microsoft) saying Look, a college <br/>
degree isn&#39;t essential for everyone. Yes, for some things it helps - <br/>
if you want to get anywhere in accounting, a CPA helps. If you want <br/>
to be a college professor, an MA or PhD is usually required. For <br/>
medical professions, the MD or RN or whatever are required for <br/>
licensing purposes. But the guy who used to be my boss and is now in <br/>
upper management in this software development firm doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
college degree. The guy in the next office to me (same job, same <br/>
pay) has a 2 yr tech school diploma. More and more, if you have <br/>
evidence that you can do the work, you&#39;ll get the job. Sometimes a <br/>
college degree is just an easier way to get that proof - but I&#39;ve <br/>
known many degreed people in my career who really were slim on <br/>
ability to actually do the job they were hired to do. And, <br/>
sometimes, spending the same 4 or 5 years working your way in from <br/>
the bottom up is just as acceptable. DH worked as a stocker in <br/>
retail, in a mailroom, and in a shop situation (cutting sheets of <br/>
plastic for something or other) BUT he also taught himself enough <br/>
computer skills (back in the late 80s and early 90s) that he was <br/>
hired to do phone support for a software company - the big skills <br/>
they wanted were self-motivated learner and creative problem-solver. <br/>
From there he moved to another company where in addition to phone <br/>
support he taught himself HTML (back in the hand-type it into <br/>
Notepad days) and became their web designer and BBS manager. THEN he <br/>
found something totally different that lit him up and *chose* a <br/>
college degree as a way to pursue it and had a blast in college (we <br/>
had been married 2 years by the time he started, a decade after high <br/>
school where he was told he wasn&#39;t college material - ha on them he <br/>
graduated with a 3.99 GPA because it was *his choice* and *his* <br/>
goal). My former roommate went from high school to working at Dunkin <br/>
Donuts and playing with a Commodore 64 in her spare time. When an <br/>
opening came up where I was working (trainability and computer <br/>
literate were the qualifications for the position as circulation <br/>
manager for a niche computer industry newsletter), she got the job. <br/>
She went from there to a job with EDS in Dallas and now she works <br/>
from her home in NJ still for EDS - not a lick of college anywhere, <br/>
just lots of willingness to learn. So, whether college is necessary <br/>
in employment really depends on what it is you are shooting for.<br/>
<br/>
The other part to that question, IMO, is social: do people look down <br/>
on those without a degree? does a person without a degree miss out <br/>
on something *essential* in society? I&#39;d have to say no on both <br/>
counts with explanation. Yes, there are always some who will look <br/>
down on others for any or no reason. If you don&#39;t go to college or <br/>
go to a &quot;lesser&quot; college or live in the &quot;wrong&quot; neighborhood or <br/>
whatever. And yes there are some things (dorm life, cafeteria <br/>
food, &quot;all nighters&quot;, etc) that are semi-pervasive in the culture <br/>
(movies, music, late night TV jokes) - but then again there are many <br/>
people with college degrees who commuted or lived at home or <br/>
whatever too, so that&#39;s not a be-all, end-all either. Just as the <br/>
high school prom and lockers and cafeteria food are not the be-all <br/>
end-all of high school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it getting harder and harder to get accepted into colleges?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so. On the contrary, due to costs, colleges are <br/>
seeking ways to keep enrollment up so their income stays up as more <br/>
people choose to go right to work, intern, apprentice, use online <br/>
courses and the like, etc. There is also a sharp trend toward <br/>
entrepreneurial start-ups and self-employed, work from home <br/>
situations where someone finds a niche and fills it - without <br/>
necessarily needing a college degree, just the skills and <br/>
connections to get up and running.  In the last newsletter thing we <br/>
got from DH&#39;s alma mater (a private 4 yr university), enrollment was <br/>
way up - so I don&#39;t think it is getting harder to get in, just <br/>
harder to afford maybe (DH&#39;s alma mater tends to give lots of <br/>
assistance - in addition to loans and a campus job, DH got a grant <br/>
when I was pregnant because we&#39;d have additional expenses with DS - <br/>
the school&#39;s own financial aid application is really important <br/>
because that&#39;s where you can give additional info regarding your <br/>
situation). <br/>
<br/>
A search on college enrollment statistics got me lots of hits so <br/>
that might help you as well if that sort of data is more telling for <br/>
your DH than anecdotal evidences.</div>

Cool story.  And clearly his motivation enabled him to learn and retain <br/>
more from his courses than he (or any other kid) might have had he <br/>
dutifully gone to college at 18 because his parents pushed him.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, a person who just shows up and goes through the motions for 4 <br/>
years can end up with a diploma, but it is preferable for students to be <br/>
engaged in what they are learning.  I think they are likely to learn <br/>
much, much more.  The piece of paper may be important in hiring <br/>
decisions, but knowledge (from school or from life or other sources) is <br/>
usually what enables us to keep jobs.<br/>
<br/>
(Uh... not that I have a paid job.)  (disclaimer) <br/>
