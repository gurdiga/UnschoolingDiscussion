<div id="ygrps-yiv-523494019">I am so excited to have found a group about unschooling. Abby is 7 months old now (Iknow <br/>
it&#39;s REALLY early...I&#39;m a bit neurotic!) and I can&#39;t imagine doing anything except unschooling. I <br/>
went to a public school and am just now rediscovering the joy of learning about things I want <br/>
to. I hope to never stifle Abby&#39;s curiosity or excitement about learning and discovering. <br/>
Anyway, I know that I&#39;ll find a wealth of information, support, and ideas here, and can&#39;t wait <br/>
to get to know you all! Here is my first (of many!) question:<br/>
How do you find out what the requirements are for each state (we are in FL) as far as, records <br/>
kept, course material (that the school system thinks should be covered) and what we would <br/>
have to submit to the state/county/city? Thanks in advance!-Natalia</div>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome.<br/>
I have two pieces of advice for you as the mother of a seven-month-old.   <br/>
First, don&#39;t bother to find out the requirements, because by the time she&#39;s <br/>
&quot;school age,&quot; if you&#39;re still in Florida, they will probably have changed the <br/>
requirements anyway.     And the other thing is to let you know (you might already <br/>
know) that there&#39;s another group you might want to join (in addition, I mean; <br/>
not instead of this one) called AlwaysUnschooled and it&#39;s linked here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
and Unschooling Basics is another busy and enthusiastic list.   Some of the <br/>
people here are on both of those and others are on one or another or just this <br/>
one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi there. No you&#39;re not &#39;neurotic&#39; - DH and I decided on unschooling <br/>
even earlier than 7 months -yes, really - we planned <br/>
on &#39;homeschooling&#39; by the time DS was born and we started thinking <br/>
about what it would &#39;look like&#39; and then we found <br/>
these &#39;unschoolers&#39; who were talking about the same things! <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra that while it IS important to know the laws of <br/>
your state, there&#39;s way too many years between now and when you&#39;ll <br/>
be needing to manage them. The laws will likely change; you might <br/>
not even be living in FL by then. Who knows what will happen in that <br/>
long a space?<br/>
<br/>
For now, just keep livin&#39; and lovin&#39; and havin&#39; fun<br/>
