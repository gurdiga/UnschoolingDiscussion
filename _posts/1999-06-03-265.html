<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735779989">Well hey thanks everybody. I was such a nervous wreck last year doing my <br/>
portfolio review but I think I did a good job. I know I had read the law <br/>
says they only have to see examples but cant comment on the quality. Well <br/>
this guy did. I was told the material I was giving my daughter was to hard. <br/>
She wanted to do it and did it well so I didnt see a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I will just bring one example this year should I get a call. I <br/>
figured taking in my daughters report on a Native American tribe she did <br/>
will count for Social studies and launguage arts and then bring in a math <br/>
assingment she did. I am honestly hopeing ...as bad as this sounds...that if <br/>
I do get a phone call and go that the shear site of me being 8 months <br/>
pregnant will make him nervous and let me out of there. *L* Anyhow I do have <br/>
a list of books the kids read so I will shove that in the folder to.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the imput I dont feel so stressed now. I just couldnt figure a <br/>
way to show the things you dont do on paper.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings<br/>
