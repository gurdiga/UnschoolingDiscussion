&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Public schools &quot;say&quot; they accommodate ADD children, but let me tell you<br/>
&gt; it is impossible for them to do so. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The last year that my son was in public school they put off his 504<br/>
&gt; Accomodation Plan meeting until January. (it should have taken place no <br/>
&gt; later<br/>
&gt; than October). At the meeting I asked the teacher why she had not made <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; accomodations that were outlined in the plan ( I had asked her on an <br/>
&gt; almost<br/>
&gt; daily basis up to this point), she replied that she didn&#39;t have a copy <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; plan. That&#39;s when the special ed director realized that this teacher <br/>
&gt; was  a<br/>
&gt; complete idiot, as I had been telling her. (she could&#39;ve gotten a copy <br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; me or the special ed director, but never asked) Anything the teacher <br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt; after that point in the meeting was looked upon with suspision and I <br/>
&gt; caught<br/>
&gt; her in an out-and-out lie  and called her on it. (she responded by <br/>
&gt; stating<br/>
&gt; that she &quot;didn&#39;t remember saying that&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m defending the teacher here, I&#39;m sure if <br/>
&gt;you felt she lied, then she probably did.  But, my question is, HOW COME <br/>
&gt;THE SPECIAL ED ADMINISTRATORS DIDN&#39;T MAKE SURE SHE WAS GIVEN A &gt;COPY OF <br/>
&gt;THE MODIFICATIONS TO KEEP IN HER FILES IN HER CLASSROOM?  I feel that <br/>
&gt;should be part of that administrators job - to make sure all the <br/>
&gt;teachers have their mods in their classrooms.  <br/>
<br/>
The first day of school I informed the teacher that Andrew has Asperger <br/>
Syndrome and he had a 504 Accomodation plan-she said that she saw that in his <br/>
file, and she never asked for a copy so I assumed that she had one.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  &gt;  I didn&#39;t feel it was right that it be eaten up by continuous <br/>
&gt;trips to the Special Ed office, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ADMINISTRATORS &gt;THERE <br/>
&gt;HAVE SEVERAL SECRETARIES AND STUDENT HELPERS WHO COULD &gt;EASILY <br/>
&gt;HAND-DELIVER THESE VERY IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE VERY &gt;BUSY <br/>
&gt;TEACHERS.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand the frustration,but in our case, the teacher never even made <br/>
any attempt to get his file, and you are right about the admin staff--the <br/>
principal didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s butt about my son&#39;s situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The administrators should remember that the teachers are very busy <br/>
&gt;serving their many students.  They should be the ones who put those mods <br/>
&gt;in the teacher&#39;s box or deliver them to the classroom.  The teachers are <br/>
&gt;under much more stress and are much busier than those administrators.<br/>
<br/>
In this case the principal wouldn&#39;t give me the time of day. After many (15+) <br/>
attempts to get a new 504 meeting, and no one returning my calls, I finally <br/>
left a note for the principal saying that Andrew wasn&#39;t going to school until <br/>
she saw me. It took her 9 school days to call me- then they marked him as <br/>
truant for those days because I failed to date the note and had no proof of <br/>
when I left it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Also, was this a new teacher?  Was she new to the school?  Did she know <br/>
&gt;how the system worked?  I remember my first year at my last high <br/>
&gt;school.  I was totally on my own.  I didn&#39;t know who anyone was, where <br/>
&gt;anything was, or what the policies and systems were.  All the other <br/>
&gt;teachers are so incredibly busy, they don&#39;t have time to teach and/or <br/>
&gt;direct you.  I didn&#39;t have a mentor teacher to help me because I was not <br/>
&gt;a first-year teacher.  It took me almost an entire school-year before I <br/>
&gt;felt comfortable with how things worked there.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, she was a new teacher but I was there every day, trying to talk to her <br/>
and get help for whatever she needed. She resisted all my efforts and also I <br/>
stopped volunteering because she complained evey time I was there about what <br/>
I was doing and how much time I spent with my son. She made excuses for not <br/>
communicating with me and not meeting the accomodations that I asked for.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&gt;IMO, in your son&#39;s case, the administrators should have taken some of <br/>
&gt;the blame for not having the accommodations or modifications put into <br/>
&gt;the hands of the teacher.  There is the possibility the teacher was <br/>
&gt;totally overwhelmed and the administrators should have realized that.<br/>
<br/>
I agree--everyone dropped the ball--but there&#39;s more to this story...<br/>
I work in a major grocery chain in our community and on 3 different occasions <br/>
I had kids from his classrom some in the store and tell me that &quot;Mrs. Brennan <br/>
was being mean to Andrew&quot;--lots of verbal abuse--screaming at him and <br/>
slamming her hand down on his desk. Of course when I questiond her she always <br/>
denied it, and Andrew never told me because he was too afraid. I know that he <br/>
was not a behavior problem--he just required too much of her time ......<br/>

security of their jobs and their own comfort levels than they did the <br/>
kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That would make me really angry.  She obviously didn&#39;t care for her <br/>
students.  I hope you complained to the principal about her.  It&#39;s <br/>
unfortunate that so many (most) teachers don&#39;t want anyone around in <br/>
their classroom - not even other teachers.  It&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to <br/>
hide something.<br/>
<br/>
I always welcomed and encouraged parents to visit the classroom.  I <br/>
found it helped with classroom management.  The kids always seemed to <br/>
behave a little better and were more respectful toward me and each other <br/>
when there was someone else in the classroom.  I always wanted to share <br/>
with them what was going on in my classroom.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You did the right thing to pull him out.  She sounds like a b_____ and <br/>
&gt; was responsible for a very unhealthy classroom environment.  Actually, <br/>
&gt; I think schools, as a whole, are very unhealthy.  They have a culture <br/>
&gt; all their own that does not resemble real life.  Schools are not good <br/>
&gt; places for children to be.  Everyone is under such tremendous stress <br/>
&gt; that too many times they behave in ways that they would never exhibit <br/>
&gt; in the real world.  I hate to admit it, but I am guilty of it myself.  <br/>
&gt; But, it didn&#39;t happen too often, and I was aware that the stress and <br/>
&gt; nature of the environment in the school affected my behavior in a <br/>
&gt; negative way.  I think perhaps too many teachers don&#39;t realize this and <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t check themselves.  I have a hard time believing that some of the <br/>
&gt; behaviors I have seen out of teachers in the schools is the same <br/>
&gt; behavior they exhibit elsewhere.  I believe the same is true for many <br/>
&gt; children.  It has a lot to do with all the stress present in that <br/>
&gt; environment.  A school is the last place I would ever want my children <br/>
&gt; to be in.  These are just my opinions.<br/>
