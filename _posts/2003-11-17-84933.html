R. R. Tolkien; the styles of Dickens, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky (the use of <br/>
descriptive names; strong themes of love and death); Jane Austen (who, along with <br/>
Dickens emphasized morals and manners); the epic tradition (The Odyssey, The <br/>
Aenead, The Divine Comedy); myth (King Arthur); fairy tales (Cinderella in <br/>
particular); cathartic endings (Sophocles, Shakespeare, O, Henry, and Agatha <br/>
Christie, among others); and many others. The significance is that all of these <br/>

evil, right vs. wrong, and so on. These are deep reads, not just the latest craze <br/>

whole genre in itself that would be &quot;juvenile fiction&quot;. I still have a bunch<br/>
of my mother&#39;s from the 1940&#39;s. They were often long series following the<br/>
hero as they rose through the grades. What is humorous to me in the light of<br/>
&quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; is that the main girl ALWAYS becomes a prefect and<br/>
later Head Girl, and is often a sports star, rather than an academic.<br/>

Harry Potter, and more then once his very Christian grma (in good intentions) has <br/>

newbie to wake up!)<br/>
I am thrilled.  I do have to mention if I didn&#39;t before that my kids, just in <br/>
the last month, have become so happy, so willing to help around here and as <br/>
for the youngest, less &quot;fussy&quot;.  You would think at 5 he wouldn&#39;t be that way <br/>
after school, but he was.  It was too hard getting up , going, somethimes not <br/>

because, like me and his dad, he just could not get up in front of the class and <br/>
answer questions!  The teacher in preschool would even make him go all day with <br/>
his schools untied, saying he needed to learn to do it himself.  Is this <br/>
rediculous or what?  They also did a pre K test, and sent the paper home with me <br/>
telling me that he wouldn&#39;t be able to attend K this year as he was SO far behind. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-727260019">Lot&#39;s of folks have interpreted Lord of the Rings as a commentary on <br/>
WWII--the ring representing the bomb, the fellowship representing the <br/>
allies, etc.--an interpretation that Tolkien himself always repudiated. I <br/>
think he always had more general things in mind, like machinery and <br/>
industrialism, rather than a specific moment like WWII or Roman <br/>
Catholicism. But, books often go beyond an author&#39;s intentions. As with <br/>
Shakespeare&#39;s plays, a text&#39;s ability to speak to different times <br/>
demonstrates why they are considered &quot;great literature&quot;; it&#39;s the ability <br/>
to endure and make meaningful commentary on human conditions, you know?<br/>

was himself a devout and introspective Catholic, and most scholars see that <br/>
influence in LOTR, not its opposite. :)  JJ<br/>

Pope&#39;s ring isn&#39;t the best symbol of his office.  If it were keys, that might be <br/>
a better symbol to say &quot;Yep, the pope.&quot;  But from a Protestant point of view <br/>
the Pope doesn&#39;t have the  keys to anything  (not even the Popemobile).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Lord of the Ring has Christian themes.  I think both LotR and <br/>
Christianity have human themes, and that&#39;s the similarity.<br/>
<br/>
But if I were a Christian parent determined to protect my children from <br/>
anything ungodly, I&#39;d be glad someone had written a book showing Christian themes <br/>
in the Lord of the Rings.<br/>

Accoring to the National Geo Special on LOTR, he was condemning the First World War and the industrialization of the British countryside.  He was a scholar of ancient folklore, so lots of &quot;human&quot; themes there, of which Christianity is one - they even tracked down the Finnish song-lore that he based the Elvish language on.<br/>
