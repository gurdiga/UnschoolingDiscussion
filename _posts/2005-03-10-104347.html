<div id="ygrps-yiv-71794469">12 yo Lisa told me she wants to watch a scary movie.  Up to this point the *scariest* things we&#39;ve watched are the 3 Harry Potter movies.  And Snow White.  Lisa was disturbed by the witch in the Disney version.<br/>
<br/>
I believe this desire was prompted by some friends seeing scary movies and telling her about them.  I&#39;d also shared with her the email about music in scary movies.  We watched Jaws together (dh, me, & kids) recently when dh happened upon it channel surfing, and we talked a lot about what to expect, special effects, and gave the kids warning on parts they may not want to see.  We offered to not watch it at all if they preferred that.  (We&#39;d both seen it years ago, but not recently.)<br/>
<br/>
She has a number of friends whose parents have convoluted rules about which movie ratings they are allowed to watch.  I&#39;ve always considered content over ratings when choosing movies for my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The only two movies that really terrified me were The Excorcist and The Shining.  (OK, the ending of the 1st Harry Potter with the double faces freaked me a bit.)  I&#39;ve enjoyed Sandra&#39;s comments about her experience vs. her kid&#39;s with The Excorcist.  Lisa has had lots of questions about my experience with these movies.  Today I told her that The Excorcist scared me because at the time I believed in The Devil, but I don&#39;t have that belief any more.  I told her about some of the freaky parts - head spinning and split pea puke - and how it would probably seem corny to me now.  I explained what an excorcism is.<br/>
<br/>
We checked the library first.  They didn&#39;t have anything she wanted (though they do have The Excorcist and The Shining both on DVD!) but I grabbed a video copy of The Day The Earth Stood Still: Aliens Invade the Earth, from 1957.  It looks like it might be fun for some cheesy special effects.<br/>
<br/>
Next we went to the video store where we browsed covers until Lisa chose The Sixth Sense.  She said that most scary movies have THE in the title.  Her friend saw this movie and has told her about it.  We&#39;ve been talking about the parts her friend told her about -  Grandma says hello.  I see dead people.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to whoever mentioned watching such movies in the am, rather than right before bed - was that here?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa also went to screen-it dotcom and read about this movie and some others.  She told me about The Forgotten, in which a child dies and everyone except the mother acts as if the child never existed.  She mentioned another movie where the F word is spoken a bazillion times.  We joked about a future will people will say &quot;F&quot; and the letter alone will be considered nasty.<br/>
<br/>
My concern now is that her 9 yo sister wants to watch The Sixth Sense with us.  She is the one who is more likely to report disturbing dreams.  I&#39;m not sure what to do about having her watch it too.  I guess I was thinking we would watch it when she was busy doing something else.<br/>

<br/>
Someone once suggested watching any &quot;making of&quot; bonus features on the DVD<br/>
before the film, especially if they talk about the makeup effects and<br/>
stunts. &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; has a couple of pretty gruesome dead people,<br/>
including a boy with his head shot out the back which is a deliberate<br/>
startle moment (he looks fine from the front).<br/>

but not recently.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen it, but I&#39;m in the midst  of a chapter on it in &quot;Cinema <br/>
Nirvana,&quot; so maybe I will.  I&#39;ve thought  about it long enough, and the book I&#39;m <br/>
reading pretty much (assuming readers  have seen it) has told the story, so <br/>
nothing left but the pictures and the scary  music.   I read in this book that when <br/>
John WIlliams first played the  &quot;theme&quot; for the director, he thought he was <br/>
joking.  But no, Williams  figured those two notes and the seemingly uncertain <br/>
rhythm would be enough to  make the watchers scared.  Even people who haven&#39;t <br/>
seen the movie know that  &quot;song.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Next we went to the video store where we browsed covers until  Lisa chose <br/>
The Sixth Sense.  She said that most scary movies have THE in  the title. . . <br/>
.  I see dead people.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want Holly to watch  that one with me.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of stirring up &quot;the poop game&quot; again,  for two reasons.  I was <br/>
cleaning off my desk and found notes I&#39;d made while  brainstorming that with <br/>
kids (and my favorites of the online contributions), and  then Holly said in <br/>
her most serious voice yesterday, following someone&#39;s fart,  &quot;I fart dead <br/>
people.&quot;   I said it should be &quot;I poop dead people,&quot; if  only that were the name of <br/>
the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Watching in the morning&#39;s a good  idea (or any daylight, busy-house time).  <br/>
Also watching parts at a time,  with breaks.  Also maybe making poop jokes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The poop game,  for those new to the group (I think it was played on this <br/>
list) was to replace  any word in a movie title with &quot;poop,&quot; and there are a lot <br/>
of new movies out  since that session.  It can be a scream with kids, and if <br/>
you make a list  and lose it on your desk, the fun can last and last.  <br/>
Sometimes you have to  mess with part of speech (not by name, but maybe pooping&#39;s <br/>
going to have  endings), and there&#39;s a touch of grammar (however crappy).  Poop in <br/>
its  natural state, though, can be a noun, verb, adjective or exclamation.   <br/>
(Well, the WORD &quot;poop,&quot; in its natural word-state.)<br/>
<br/>
Some I saved from the  last time:  <br/>
Stand by Poop (or Poop by Me)<br/>
Dude, Where&#39;s my  Poop?<br/>
The Poop of Zorro<br/>
007-Golden Poop<br/>
Octopoopie (you don&#39;t have to  watch James Bond movies to know their names)<br/>
<br/>
The Sixth Sense doesn&#39;t  really lend itself to this game, nor do Unbreakable, <br/>
Signs or The Village.   Perhaps M. Night Shyamalan had played the poop game <br/>
before he named his movies  and made them poop-proof.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both my kids have seen this movie and I think youth brings a very <br/>
different perspective to the film.  As a mom, *I* feel protective of the <br/>
child in this movie, but not to the level my kids do; they really watch <br/>
how adults don&#39;t believe him even though *we* all know he&#39;s telling the <br/>
truth, how he struggles to talk to his mom but is afraid she won&#39;t love <br/>
him anymore, how he just wants to do what&#39;s right -- luckily in the end <br/>
he does, he *is* finally listened to and respected.  It&#39;s an intense <br/>
movie.  There are secrets in it, too :)  Everything red in the film is <br/>
meant to be something *touched* by the other side and it&#39;s fun to &quot;watch <br/>
for the director&quot; [he does the Alfred Hitchcock thing of cameos in his <br/>
own films].  The graphic gunshot-to-the-head kid sparked an invigorating <br/>
gun safety conversation -- the consequences of irresponsibility are <br/>
undeniable in this film. <br/>
Now that I think of it... if she wants to do this kind of scary film, <br/>
maybe Signs is better, just because it&#39;s easier to write off as <br/>
make-believe and the cool message is there [all things happen for a <br/>
reason] to tie it all up prettily.  And still the middle is exciting and <br/>
intense. <br/>

One of the girls in my homeschooling group just told us about doing that<br/>
with car names but using the word anal instead. I can&#39;t seem to drive<br/>
anywhere now without giggling at the car in front of me.<br/>

It does seem a way to help a movie seem less weighty, to have messed with the <br/>
dignity of its name. &lt;g&gt;  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Poop.<br/>
<br/>
Once they&#39;ve laughed some, maybe the movie won&#39;t seem so horrifying.<br/>
It&#39;s  only a movie.  And at home, it has a remote control mute, pause, and <br/>
off, unlike in a theatre.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250204847">We watched the movie on Friday afternoon.  Jackie was invited to go rollerskating with a freind, leaving us alone for a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
Within a few minutes after starting the movie, Lisa&#39;s friend Allison came over.  Her mom limits her movie intake, so I first called her mom to ask if she could watch with us.  She didn&#39;t answer, so I sent Allison home to ask.  The answer was no.  The mom said she had seen the movie and it disturbed her.  (Later, after I watched it, I talked to her mom some more and found out that she didn&#39;t watch it to the end.  I told her that was the best part!)  Lisa told Allison she could play later, but wanted to watch the movie then, while Jackie was gone.<br/>
<br/>
The night before, Jackie had pulled a twin mattress and a bunch of pillows onto the living room floor.  We started the movie on the couch with snackes, then moved to the mattress to watch the rest.  Lisa&#39;s friend had seen The Sixth Sense recently and had warned about some &quot;cover your eyes&quot; parts.  It helped to have all those extra blankets and pillows handy!<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the movie we talked about it.  At the end we watched the extras on the DVD, then went back to look at a couple scenes to see how we had missed that the Doctor (sorry, I&#39;m not going to tell.  You&#39;ll have to watch it to see for yourself!)<br/>
<br/>
We decided the movie wasn&#39;t &quot;scary&quot; so much as it had a fair amount of gore and the shock of the ghosts appearing suddenly.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all the tips!<br/>
<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
<br/>
PS I&#39;m still watching The Day The Earth Stood Still (1957 movie where an alien space ship lands on Earth in 1951).  Now I know why we don&#39;t see aliens more often.  The Earthlings treated them so horribly that they never want to visit us again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904757596">Its funny how often subjects discussed on this list, then <br/>
immediately come up in real life. Just yesterday my sister and I <br/>
were discussing a show she saw on Bravo about the &quot;100 Scariest <br/>
Movie Moments&quot; that prompted a whole discussion about Jaws (was it <br/>
Sandra who said she&#39;d never seen it?!?), and how we can watch that <br/>
every time it comes on TV, its so good. She told me about one of the <br/>
movies listed, a Japanese film &quot;Audition&quot;, the plot is super creepy, <br/>
and i guess it inspired Rob Zombie, who then went on to make the <br/>
very disturbing &quot;House of 1000 Corpses&quot;...My son was playing <br/>
Neopets, and there were fava beans for sale in one of the <br/>
neoshops...i told him that my only experience with &quot;fava beans&quot; was <br/>
a line from Silence of the Lambs (#7 on the list)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in Horror films might want to check out the list, <br/>
its not actually the scariest *movies*, but the scariest moments <br/>
(Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka are on the list)...<br/>

scary. Maybe there&#39;s another list, though, of CREEPY scenes. But <br/>
then, The Ring would be on that one, too.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of horror movies, anyone seen &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;? It&#39;s <br/>
