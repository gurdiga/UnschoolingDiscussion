&gt;<br/>
&gt;What do people here think about rewards systems for chores?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have a sort of two-tiered system. First is the &quot;work before play&quot;<br/>
&gt;system, in which a certain minimum amount of work is required before the<br/>
&gt;boys are allowed to play computer or video games. The second thing is that<br/>
&gt;we pay them for working -- we have a weekly &quot;chores chart&quot; that we tote up<br/>
&gt;at the end of each week -- the more work performed the more money they get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We do this not only to &quot;coerce&quot; them into working but to show them that<br/>
&gt;there is a relationship between doing work and enjoying the benefits of<br/>
&gt;having worked.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, now that I&#39;ve gotten over snorting the black olives I was eating....<br/>
I&#39;d have to say that rewards for chores SUCKS for the parents.  The kids <br/>
whine.  The kids try to avoid the chores.  The chores seem impenetrable, <br/>
boring, never-ending and definitely hideous.  The parents have to chase the <br/>
kid around, keep track of who did what (and who didn&#39;t do what), cajole, <br/>
beg, plead, threaten... and then the kids hold the specter of not having <br/>
any spending money just because YOU said so.  (and it was you who decided <br/>
that they couldn&#39;t have any money if they didn&#39;t do what you required of <br/>
them, no?  That wasn&#39;t their decision imposed on you?)  Then, when all is <br/>
said and done, the parent has to usually do the chore anyway, probably <br/>
muttering something about kids who don&#39;t care... etc.  Goodness.  Who wants <br/>
to live in such a world?<br/>
<br/>
...and frankly, in the real world, there isn&#39;t usually a direct correlation <br/>
between financial rewards and how much you worked.  I know gardeners who <br/>
work a WHOLE lot harder both physically, mentally and in terms of time <br/>
spent, than certain of my relatives, and yet certain of my relatives pull <br/>
down six figure salaries.  The gardener barely makes it into five <br/>
figures.  Nevermind the legion of folks who work their butts off starting <br/>
businesses, and no matter how hard they work, the biz fails.  ...But they <br/>
worked hard.  Where&#39;s their money?  We were taught that work equals money!<br/>
<br/>
To my way of thinking, the benefits of having worked are looking at the <br/>
work you just did and feeling good about it.  Do your kids feel terrific <br/>
about the work/chores they just completed, or was it a trial endured?  I <br/>
say, skip the coercion, the charts and the &#39;I&#39;m bigger than you, so I <br/>
say...&#39; games and let the kids choose when and where to help.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll happen.<br/>
