<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131003779">Tuck- I like your style! I see so many people who are afraid or<br/>
embarrassed to stand up for their kids in public. There have been times,<br/>
when someone was treating my son unfairly and I just kept my mouth shut<br/>
and got him away from them, and then later I think, &quot;Why didn&#39;t I SAY<br/>
something?&quot;  Way to go !<br/>

&gt; said &quot;this <br/>
&gt; worksheet means nothing. You never have to do them if you don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt; to, <br/>
&gt; ever.  It&#39;s simply a way for an uncreative teacher to make herself <br/>
&gt; think <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s getting through to you some way.  Did you learn anything about <br/>
&gt; what she <br/>
&gt; was saying?&quot;  yes.  &quot;Then you don&#39;t need a worksheet to tell you <br/>
&gt; that.  Do <br/>
&gt; you want to go back to the older class next time?&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;No.  They don&#39;t do anything fun.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I insulted the teacher, and in the midst of a whole bunch of <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; homeschool moms milling about, too.  But my kid having *that* kind <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; frustration warranted a strong affirmation from me that he was <br/>
&gt; right.  <br/>
