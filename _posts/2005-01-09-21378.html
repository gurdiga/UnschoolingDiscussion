<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571863170">Hi everyone -- Today I&#39;m sitting here on my computer -- and feeling<br/>
enormously guilty because I am not taking my boys to their music<br/>
lessons today.  We&#39;ve been unschooling for about three years.  The<br/>
boys have also been taking outside lessons in art, swimming, fencing<br/>
and music. Before our world shifted last month, they were also asking<br/>
to take a video production class.           <br/>
<br/>
Long story short -- my 44-year-old husband died of a sudden massive<br/>
heart attack on Dec. 14.  We&#39;ve gotten through the immediate shock,<br/>
the funeral and the holidays. Now we&#39;re looking at the future and how<br/>
much our lives have changed and will change.  The financial part will<br/>
be tremendously tight -- we&#39;re falling from $100K a year to about $15K<br/>
per year.  Out of that we&#39;ll have to pay about $3000 a month in bare<br/>
basics expenses -- mortgage, health insurance, utilities.  There is<br/>
some insurance and social security which will help out a little bit,<br/>
but now I am the sole support for our family.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night I spoke to the boys (ages 11 and 14) and shared with them<br/>
my concern that their outside lessons cost $100s a month. When we had<br/>
a lot more money, this was not a problem in the least.  They agreed<br/>
that most of the lessons were an expense that we needed to cut.  They<br/>
are continuing with the swimming lessons for now since a benefactor<br/>
has volunteered to pay for the next 8 weeks.    <br/>
<br/>
I have always had an at-home child care business as well as a<br/>
part-time job with a non-profit agency that allows me to work from<br/>
home.  These jobs allowed me to stay at home with my kids, and the<br/>
money that I made was pretty much spent on food and fun stuff. Now I<br/>
will have to be the breadwinner and that gives rise to another concern<br/>
-- the prospect of leaving my kids home alone for long stretches. <br/>
Right now, my thought is to keep the status quo, pare back expenses<br/>
and try to stay home with them for one more year.  I can try to get<br/>
more children enrolled in my before/after school child care and my<br/>
agency has said that I can pick up a few more hours.  This will be<br/>
good for the short term, but this small amount of additional income<br/>
will not sustain our family in the long-run.<br/>
<br/>
In a previous career (12 years ago) I was a legislative aide to a US<br/>
Congressman. If I were to return to DC to work either as a staffer or<br/>
with a lobbying firm, I would make a larger income and benefits would<br/>
be paid. (Right now our health insurance is $969 a month and because<br/>
all three of us have asthma, we can&#39;t get individual-payer insurance<br/>
anywhere else. The Federal Employees Health Benefits plan doesn&#39;t<br/>
exclude pre-existing conditions.) The downside is that I would have a<br/>
90 mile round trip commute, long daily hours and likely 25% travel.<br/>
(I&#39;ve though a bit about the travel -- I could arrange to take the<br/>
kids with me on some trips.) I&#39;m also looking into jobs working for my<br/>
county -- the pay would be less, but all the benefits would be paid --<br/>
and I would not have the 1.5 hour each way commute.  <br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old son told me that he can&#39;t wait until he&#39;s 15 (which is<br/>
next month) because he wants to go out and get job to help support our<br/>
family.  (I get all teary just thinking about how quickly he&#39;s having<br/>
to grow up -- but OTH I am trying to think positively that his joining<br/>
the workforce to help pay our household bills will give him a valuable<br/>
life experience and a real sense of his effectiveness.) We live in a<br/>
semi-rural area with no sidewalks and busy roads that aren&#39;t safe to<br/>
walk -- so I would have to transport him to his job.  He already helps<br/>
me a lot by being home with his younger brother on the days that I<br/>
have work meetings outside (about twice a week).              <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for ideas and reassurances that we can continue our<br/>
unschooling lifestyle even if it means that my kids are home alone all<br/>
day long.    <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your creatvitiy and wisdom,<br/>
<br/>

Oh gosh.<br/>
Alicia, I&#39;m so sorry.  Thanks for sharing this with us, though, and I  hope <br/>
some people here will have good ideas for you.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
Home alone with cell phones and e-mail isn&#39;t the same as home alone in the  <br/>
old days.  I would worry that if your teen gets a job that he wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
there to be with his brother.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe when and if you do decide you need to work fulltime you should look  <br/>
for something closer where you don&#39;t have to dress up so much and drive so  far.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be too bad for the kids to be home without you if  the <br/>
neighborhood&#39;s safe and they get along well and aren&#39;t risk-taking  kids.  <br/>
But maybe they wouldn&#39;t even have to be all alone in a boring way,  either.  <br/>
Maybe you&#39;ll find some other homeschoolers who need childcare  during the day <br/>
(for another older child not a really young one) or... I don&#39;t  know.  Just <br/>
lamely brainstorming too soon probably.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope other ideas come in!  <br/>
Are there grief counselling facilities where you are?  Support groups  or <br/>
lists?  Things will probably hit later that haven&#39;t yet, for you and the  kids <br/>
both.<br/>

I have no particular ideas except to suggest not rushing into any large life<br/>
changing decisions. Finding ways to give yourself a year sounds like a good<br/>

&gt;&gt;heart attack on Dec. 14.  We&#39;ve gotten through the immediate shock,<br/>
&gt;&gt;the funeral and the holidays.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am so sorry for your loss. I can&#39;t imagine such thing happening, it must<br/>
have been so hard. I am sending all my good thoughts your way Alicia...I<br/>
imagine lots of people on this list are. Your email shows that you indeed<br/>
are a strong, smart, caring woman!<br/>
<br/>
I had numerous thoughts while reading your post. Though my husband is still<br/>
with us, we had a similar change in our financial situation. My husband is a<br/>
physician, and two years ago merged his clinic in Ohio with one in Phoenix<br/>
Arizona, which caused us to move across the country to Phoenix (we did it<br/>
happily, and in excited agreement). The move business-wise was a huge<br/>
mistake (if you believe in mistakes) and he lost not only his income, but<br/>
all of his clinic assets as well in what turned out to be a big con job<br/>
(lots of court proceedings in process, but this is costing money rather than<br/>
replenishing any, and it looks like we&#39;ll get nothing back). It&#39;s a long<br/>
story, but the end result is that we went from $200,000 income to $35,000.<br/>
This would be fine, except we were living at least a $150,000 life.<br/>
<br/>
Because my dh has worked in alternative cancer treatment for most of his<br/>
working years, he was not easily employable in a standard dr. position. We<br/>
have four kids, all in lessons, classes, etc like yours. Our mortgage was<br/>
also $3000, we had no health insurance except for one of our children who<br/>
has major heart problems and we pay $500 a month just for him. We had lots<br/>
of other expenses as well.<br/>
<br/>
At first we just felt devastated. We couldn&#39;t figure out what moves to make.<br/>
But slowly we realized that we had to make changes, and fast. We discussed a<br/>
whole lot as a family and to my dh&#39;s and my surprise, our children were much<br/>
more in touch with reality than we were. They pretty much said that though<br/>
they loved where we lived, they were much more interested in having a<br/>
peaceful life. There certainly was some initial mourning to the changes, but<br/>
not for long. They excitedly took on the idea of selling our house and<br/>
downsizing.  We looked at all kinds of other places to live. They all ended<br/>
their lessons and suddenly had more time and less schedule, which they<br/>
enjoyed. We also creatively thought of ways to barter for lessons. In<br/>
exchange for guitar lessons, we thought of bringing lunch three days a week<br/>
to the teacher. I offered to volunteer at my daughter&#39;s dance studio in<br/>
exchange for her lessons to continue. My son&#39;s film teacher donated his time<br/>
indefinitely. People really do in general want to help when help is really<br/>
needed. Maybe some of your children&#39;s lessons can be donated or bartered for<br/>
due to this unfortunate circumstance?<br/>
<br/>
What was very important to us was that we did not live beyond our means, and<br/>
our means at the time meant changing everything. We were reminded so often<br/>
of the important things, love, peace, relationships. These were so much more<br/>
important than expensive stuff/house, lessons, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It may be way too soon for you to consider making changes this way in your<br/>
life, but I thought I&#39;d share what happened with us in case it is helpful.<br/>
You have already been challenged enough in thinking about things in life!<br/>
Just know that you don&#39;t have to &quot;fix&quot; everything right away, and in time<br/>
there will be ways to get lessons and things back. You are giving them a<br/>
loving family environment and home, no matter what that home is. That is the<br/>
primary thing that any of us need. They&#39;ll have lots of opportunities to<br/>
continue with what they want as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Not working outside the home much has been a very important thing for me<br/>
too, but I have had to do some of that. My guys have spent more time home<br/>
alone than I would like. I don&#39;t see a negative side yet, except for the<br/>
occasional day that they want to do something and I can&#39;t do it for them. If<br/>
they are home together, that makes a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
Take care Alicia, take care of yourself, and those kids are going to be just<br/>
fine. Healing can take a while, and life doesn&#39;t have to go on exactly as it<br/>
did to be a good life. Unschooling looks differently at different times<br/>
depending on our life situations, I think.<br/>

It&#39;s really hard to grieve when your the mom and have so much to take <br/>
care of.  I don&#39;t know what I can offer but hopes and wishes of peace <br/>
for you.  <br/>
We lost our 8yo son Sam suddenly, 2 years ago.  My life changed <br/>
dramatically, but I didn&#39;t have the financial worries that come with <br/>
losing a spouse.  <br/>
I think the only reason I didn&#39;t completely fall apart was because of <br/>
my other children.  They  needed me, so I sucked it up and carried on.<br/>
I&#39;m still not sure if that&#39;s a good thing or not, but as mom&#39;s, we <br/>
have no choice.<br/>
I wish you all the strength you&#39;ll need in the coming months.<br/>

My 14 year old son told me that he can&#39;t wait until he&#39;s 15 (which is<br/>
next month) because he wants to go out and get job to help support our<br/>
family.  **<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Alicia --<br/>
<br/>
My husband was 15 when his dad died of a heart attack at age 47, and my husband is 47 this year, so I&#39;ve spent a little bit of time previewing what you are living.  (It&#39;s what I worry about when I do my middle of the night worrying.)  My heart goes out to you.  Any advice I give you is intended to be evaluated by you and only acted on if it suits you.  I won&#39;t try to talk you into anything that doesn&#39;t sound right to you.<br/>
<br/>
You may qualify for types of health care offered in your state for poor people, now that your income is much smaller.  (A family that I know that went through prolonged unemployment, in CA, was able to put their kids on a new state program.)  You may want to research what&#39;s available in your state or get a friend who wants to help to research it for you.  (But double check what they tell you.)<br/>
<br/>
If you have to go back to work full-time, you can probably find ways to have your kids spend some of their day with friends.  I would encourage you to try not to feel bad if you look at your options and figure that full-time work is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Some people find that selling a house and moving to a cheaper area is a workable way to deal with having less income.  But, of course, you are urged not to do anything drastic in your year of mourning when it&#39;s darned hard to think clearly.  It&#39;s just something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
Could you work for the state government instead of the Federal government?  Where you are or in some other state?  I have a friend from DC, so I have some idea how bad the prices and the commutes are there.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s an important thought, that there can be lessons someday.  Even after <br/>
they&#39;re grown.   <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s good that Kirby has taken karate since he was 9, but his teacher <br/>
didn&#39;t start until he was 20.   Lots of musicians started as adults.  Lots of <br/>
artists.  Lots of dancers, gymnasts and athletes have to quit by the time <br/>
they&#39;re adults because they&#39;ve messed up their ankles or knees.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about suggesting that you move to a less expensive place, too, but <br/>
I don&#39;t know whether staying in that home where your husband was is important <br/>
to you.  I think almost everywhere is less expensive than near Washington, <br/>
except maybe Boston or San Francisco.  Places like Oklahoma and Kansas, I hear, <br/>
have really cool towns where large houses can be rented for less than small <br/>
apartments in most other places.<br/>

In Arkansas the program is called ARKIDS and I&#39;m pretty sure it has no <br/>
pre-existing exemptions. It has two components, one is Medicare and if <br/>
on that the family pays nothing, the other is for the &quot;working poor&quot; and <br/>
then not everything is covered and you pay a $10 co-pay. The 1st one <br/>
requires a very low income but the second surprised me in how generous <br/>
it was. I think the cut off was like $35,000 for a family of 3...we used <br/>
it for a few years while getting back on our feet after dh quit (it was <br/>
either that or a nervous breakdown) his job. Some states have a waiting <br/>
period, but they might also have emergency programs for someone in your <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention in my last email that I have found that some <br/>
extra-curricular activity programs have scholar ships they do not <br/>
advertise, but are available if you ask about them.<br/>

We do live in a safe neighborhood, the boys do get along very well and<br/>
 they haven&#39;t acted out in any risk-taking ways.  <br/>
  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>either.  <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t seem to be bored at home.  They have lots of video games,<br/>
we have six computers on a home network, tons of books, loads of art<br/>
supplies, sports equipment, foosball, air hockey, digital cable TV,<br/>
every movie channel, DVDs, etc.  We have a big fenced backyard with<br/>
trees, garden and forts that the boys have made.         <br/>

I don&#39;t  know.  Just lamely brainstorming too soon probably.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done child care before for homescoolers -- but it hasn&#39;t really<br/>
worked out.  Those parents were not willing to unschool and the<br/>
different approaches became much more of a hassle than I was willing<br/>
to deal with.  The other homeschooled kids would see my children never<br/>
having to slave over workbooks and they would rebel at home.   <br/>
    <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope other ideas come in!  <br/>
&gt; Are there grief counselling facilities where you are?  Support<br/>
 </span></blockquote>groups  or lists?  Things will probably hit later that haven&#39;t yet,<br/>
for you and the  kids both.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t found the grief counseling sewrvices in our area yet.<br/>
Hospice is the most likely place to have that information.  Come to<br/>
think of it, I am surprised that the funeral home didn&#39;t provide me<br/>
with a list of those resources.  Hmmm... I will have to ping them on<br/>
that.  We had a rather unorthodox approach to the death service.  When<br/>
I returned from the hospital after getting the news about Dan&#39;s death,    <br/>
and after I told the boys what happened, the three of us sat down and<br/>
discussed how we wanted the arrangements to be.  Right away it was<br/>
clear to the three of us that we didn&#39;t want a burial, so we chose<br/>
cremation and decided to keep Dan&#39;s remains at home with us.  We<br/>
planned a memorial celebration of his life with input from family and<br/>
friends. There was a very ecumenical approach drawing from the<br/>
traditions of many faiths -- Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Pagan. <br/>
    We did this to provide comfort to the various members of our<br/>
families  who follow those faiths.  The memorial was a good creative<br/>
outlet to our grieving, and that was very healing.  Dan&#39;s sister, the<br/>
boys and I had a great time making a CD of Dan&#39;s favorite music which<br/>
was played at the beginning and at the end of the memorial.  It may be<br/>
the first (and only?) time that Pink Floyd&#39;s &quot;The Wall&quot; was ever<br/>
played at the funeral home!  We burned multiple copies of Dan&#39;s Music<br/>
CD to give to family members as tokens of remembrance.  A day after<br/>
the &quot;traditional&quot; memorial we had a Pagan ceremony of release and<br/>
healing planned by some dear homeschooling friends in a wonderful<br/>
setting near an old forest and river.                      <br/>
<br/>
I understand that grief is a process that unfolds in its own time and<br/>
in its own way for each of us.  With the kids I definitely think that<br/>
there will be a delayed reaction that comes up later on.  Roger had<br/>
some delayed reactions to his grandfather&#39;s death a few years ago. <br/>
What I keep hearing from both of the boys is that they want to be<br/>
strong for me.  I tell them that it&#39;s good that they want to be strong<br/>
and grown-up, but that I don&#39;t want them to supress what they are<br/>
feeling -- it&#39;s not only okay, but the best thing they can do is to<br/>
allow themselves to feel their feelings.  Right now, they report that<br/>
they&#39;re still in a state of disbelief -- that they feel that Dan is<br/>
just away on a long trip and will be returning soon.  Of course, they<br/>
know that this is not true and we talk about how this shock and<br/>
numbness is a protective   coping reaction to give our brains time to<br/>
process this great sadness. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your support and sympathy, <br/>

<br/>
Maybe part of the reason these positions are volunteer ones is because<br/>
volunteers like yourself have been available to fill them. Perhaps you could<br/>
ask for these positions to become a job for you, citing the other localities<br/>
as a standard for the pay scale and explaining the change in your<br/>
circumstances. The benefits to the county of keeping someone familiar with<br/>
the people, places and protocols might be better than having to train new<br/>
volunteers, since I guess you wouldn&#39;t be able to give the time to<br/>
volunteering AND working for pay elsewhere. I can&#39;t tell you how many paid<br/>
positions grew out of volunteer ones in my own working history (not for<br/>
charities but for businesses). Just about every time I volunteered it ended<br/>
up morphing into a paid job, because I asked for it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;We do live in a safe neighborhood, the boys do get along very well and<br/>
 they haven&#39;t acted out in any risk-taking ways.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Check the laws in your State. Some have regulations about the ages of<br/>
children who can be left &quot;unsupervised&quot;. This came up once before on another<br/>
list, and 12 was one of the ages I vaguely recall mentioned in some places.<br/>
Better to know for sure.  <br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The memorial was a good creative<br/>
outlet to our grieving, and that was very healing.  Dan&#39;s sister, the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have four kids, all in lessons, classes, etc like yours. Our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mortgage was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; also $3000, we had no health insurance except for one of our<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has major heart problems and we pay $500 a month just for him. We<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had lots<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of other expenses as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At first we just felt devastated. We couldn&#39;t figure out what moves<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to make.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But slowly we realized that we had to make changes, and fast. We<br/>
 </span></blockquote>discussed a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whole lot as a family and to my dh&#39;s and my surprise, our children<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were much<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more in touch with reality than we were. They pretty much said that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>though<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they loved where we lived, they were much more interested in having a<br/>
&gt; peaceful life. There certainly was some initial mourning to the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>changes, but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not for long. They excitedly took on the idea of selling our house and<br/>
&gt; downsizing.  We looked at all kinds of other places to live. They<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all ended<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their lessons and suddenly had more time and less schedule, which they<br/>
&gt; enjoyed. We also creatively thought of ways to barter for lessons. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe some of your children&#39;s lessons can be donated or bartered for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; due to this unfortunate circumstance?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What was very important to us was that we did not live beyond our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>means, and  our means at the time meant changing everything. We were<br/>
reminded so often of the important things, love, peace, relationships.<br/>
These were so much more important than expensive stuff/house, lessons,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for sharing your experience with me.  It gave me a lot to<br/>
think about.  It&#39;s good to have the reassurance that the children can<br/>
flex to the challenges ahead, based on how well your children were<br/>
able to adjust to thier new lives.  You&#39;re right about the less<br/>
scheduled lives with fewer lessons.  My children do tend to like their<br/>
day to unfold more slowly and there were time when they expressed that<br/>
there was too much going on. It was all of their own choosing -- but I<br/>
never felt the need to limit their participation in lessons, clubs,<br/>
etc.  There are other, less spendy ways for them to gain enrichment. <br/>
After we talked about taking a break from thier Sunday music lessons,<br/>
we found that there was an SCA group that did medieval weapons<br/>
activities on Sunday -- and AFAIK, SCA is very low-cost or free.  (Is<br/>
this correct, Sandra?)               <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It may be way too soon for you to consider making changes this way<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; life, but I thought I&#39;d share what happened with us in case it is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>helpful.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You have already been challenged enough in thinking about things in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>life!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just know that you don&#39;t have to &quot;fix&quot; everything right away, and in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; there will be ways to get lessons and things back. You are giving them a<br/>
&gt; loving family environment and home, no matter what that home is. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is good to remember as well.  I&#39;ve been thinking that if I can<br/>
keep things fairly status quo for the next year -- that will give us<br/>
more time to decide our course for the future as well as give the kids<br/>
one more year to mature and become more self-reliant.  Right now I&#39;m<br/>
thinking that I can keep the house since the mortgage is less than<br/>
most rental properties in my area (real estate values are astronomical<br/>
 in metro Washington, DC.)  The next biggest expense is health care --<br/>
and if I can get a job that pays for that we will be much better off.<br/>
   There is a small chance the job I currently hold will get some<br/>
health benefits.  Even so, I will need to earn more money to avoid<br/>
depleting the life insurance.          <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Not working outside the home much has been a very important thing for me<br/>
&gt; too, but I have had to do some of that. My guys have spent more time<br/>
 </span></blockquote>home<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; alone than I would like. I don&#39;t see a negative side yet, except for the<br/>
&gt; occasional day that they want to do something and I can&#39;t do it for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them. If they are home together, that makes a big difference.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care Alicia, take care of yourself, and those kids are going to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be just<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fine. Healing can take a while, and life doesn&#39;t have to go on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>exactly as it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; did to be a good life. Unschooling looks differently at different times<br/>
&gt; depending on our life situations, I think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks again, Jacki, for your wise words.  You have no idea just how<br/>
healing and reassuring your message is for me to read.  <br/>

point you to someone who could.For two years I was in a chaplaincy <br/>
training program (called Clinical Pastoral Education, or CPE) at a <br/>
large local hospital, and grief counseling was one of the main <br/>
things we were there to learn how to do. I would recommend finding <br/>
out if a local hospital has CPE because they would have more <br/>
resources than just one or two staff chaplains. They have <br/>
connections with people in the community, books on grief, and are <br/>
actively teaching students how to provide grief counseling. My group <br/>
here had a diverse spiritual base, and it sounds like an open, broad <br/>
view is what you are wanting. I hope that you could find a similar <br/>
group where you are. I think a CPE program would give you the best <br/>
chance of finding counseling that matches your own faith/beliefs. <br/>
Perhaps this will give you a direction to look for the support you <br/>
need. <br/>
<br/>
Wishing you healing and peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662420815">Thank you, Betsy, for your ideas and words of support.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband was 15 when his dad died of a heart attack at age 47, and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my husband is 47 this year, so I&#39;ve spent a little bit of time<br/>
previewing what you are living.  (It&#39;s what I worry about when I do my<br/>
middle of the night worrying.)  My heart goes out to you.  Any advice<br/>
I give you is intended to be evaluated by you and only acted on if it<br/>
suits you.  I won&#39;t try to talk you into anything that doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
right to you.<br/>
<br/>
Because of where Danny worked and because he had a narrow escape from<br/>
the Pentagon on 9/11/2001, I was always afraid that he would die<br/>
young.  I am glad that I always took the time to send him off with<br/>
sweet words and good wishes -- because you never know, right?  It just<br/>
so happened that he did die on his way to work -- and I am really <br/>
glad that my policy of happy morning departures was in effect on our<br/>
last moring together.  Try not to spend too much time worrying about<br/>
what you can&#39;t control -- and focus on the things that you can<br/>
control.  I wish I had spent more time learning Dan&#39;s method of bill<br/>
paying, paid attention when he told me his computer passwords, and<br/>
followed through on his instructions to get his life insurance<br/>
doubled.  Because the thought of losing him was too terrible for me to<br/>
confront, I put it off and now it&#39;s too late.  Since Dan was getting<br/>
to be in his forties and we&#39;ve had friends who&#39;ve already had cardiac<br/>
swcares, I had mentioned to him that he should see a doctor to get a<br/>
baseline physical.  Now I wish that I&#39;d jsut made the appointment and<br/>
encouraged him to go.  For me it&#39;s a point game of coulda shoulda<br/>
woulda -- but if my experience can be instructive that is my advice to<br/>
you. :-&gt;            <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; You may qualify for types of health care offered in your state for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>poor people, now that your income is much smaller.  (A family that I<br/>
know that went through prolonged unemployment, in CA, was able to put<br/>
their kids on a new state program.)  You may want to research what&#39;s<br/>
available in your state or get a friend who wants to help to research<br/>
it for you.  (But double check what they tell you.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I work in the social services field - and having advised many people<br/>
of their qualications for these programs, this is one of the first<br/>
things I checked for myself.  Unfortunately, with Social Security, our<br/>
household income is just slightly too high to qualify.  That may<br/>
change and you bet I will be watchful for when it does.       <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have to go back to work full-time, you can probably find ways<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to have your kids spend some of their day with friends.  I would<br/>
encourage you to try not to feel bad if you look at your options and<br/>
figure that full-time work is necessary.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks -- that is good to hear.  I have lots of friends in this area<br/>
-- a huge support network, actually.  Most of my non-homeschooling<br/>
friends are older, wealthier and dote on my children.  They&#39;re taking<br/>
them to the movies, out for pizza and ice cream, etc.  They&#39;ve offered<br/>
to take them on fields trips and help ferry them to places during the<br/>
day if I need to be away.  I just don&#39;t want to be an imposition.    <br/>
       <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; Some people find that selling a house and moving to a cheaper area<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is a workable way to deal with having less income.  But, of course,<br/>
you are urged not to do anything drastic in your year of mourning when<br/>
it&#39;s darned hard to think clearly.  It&#39;s just something to consider.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve thought about this a bit too.  Right now -- all of my family and<br/>
friends are in this area -- if I moved, I wouldn&#39;t have the same kind<br/>
of support network that I have here.  Moving is a fantasy -- I could<br/>
cash in all my equity, take the insurance payment and move to Costa<br/>
Rica! Or Canada (free health care!)     <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Could you work for the state government instead of the Federal<br/>
 </span></blockquote>government? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible.  I am about halfway betweeen DC and Richmond.  I&#39;m<br/>
willing to entertain all possiblities at this point. I also have some<br/>
leads with two national labor unions -- but those are in DC.  There is<br/>
also an interesting lead with PBS -- and they&#39;re located in<br/>
Alexandria, VA which is not as bad as going all the way into DC --<br/>
about 45 minutes as opposed to 1.5 hours.       <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all the good things to think about.  I knew this<br/>
group would come through! <br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt; In Arkansas the program is called ARKIDS and I&#39;m<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;pretty sure it has no <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;pre-existing exemptions. It has two components, one<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;is Medicare and if <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;on that the family pays nothing, the other is for<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the &quot;working poor&quot; and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;then not everything is covered and you pay a $10<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;co-pay. The 1st one <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;requires a very low income but the second surprised<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;me in how generous <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;it was. I think the cut off was like $35,000 for a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;family of 3...<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;      <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Washington&#39;s is even higher than this, I think,<br/>
&gt;&gt;although we have a family of 4.  We&#39;ve been amazed<br/>
&gt;&gt;that although we&#39;re quite &quot;middle class&quot; or at least<br/>
&gt;&gt;it seems to us ;) we can qualify for insurance for the<br/>
&gt;&gt;kids! Everyone we know uses it here...<br/>

I have a good friend, an unschooling mom, who also lost her husband <br/>
just this past fall. She has twin daughters who are 17 and were already <br/>
in school, by their choice, and a 14 yo son who chose to continue to be <br/>
at home even though she has gone to work full time. Lots of other <br/>
people have stepped in to help give him rides so that he has been able <br/>
to participate in various activities. I wonder if you&#39;d like to talk to <br/>
her - I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be willing and maybe it would be a good thing for <br/>
both of you?<br/>

people help.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been helping my friend whose husband died - lots of people have <br/>
helped her family a lot - and it is not an &quot;imposition,&quot; it is a <br/>
blessing to be in a position to be ABLE to help out and a privilege to <br/>
be trusted with her kids. We all know that it could be us needing the <br/>
help and that it is the right thing to do, to help out with the kids, <br/>
etc. People really want to feel that they can do something - it makes <br/>
life feel less ...capricious? Something like that. Let them help.<br/>

I&#39;m  looking for ideas and reassurances that we can continue our<br/>
unschooling  lifestyle even if it means that my kids are home alone all<br/>
day long.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
Alicia, I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.<br/>
 <br/>
When I have listened to financial talk shows in the past, the advice always  <br/>
seemed to be to not do anything drastic for at least a year, if you can help  <br/>
it.  But that was always given to people who had life insurance  money.  <br/>
 <br/>
I understand that things are weighing in on you, and the bills won&#39;t  wait.  <br/>
There is an urgency to having bills to pay that&#39;s just  unbelievable.<br/>
 <br/>
However, I think the important thing is to keep your family together.   I <br/>
think music lessons and the like can wait.  I think this is an  opportunity for <br/>
you and your kids to be more creative thinkers.  I really  hate the idea of you <br/>
going to work full-time with a long commute.   Hate it.  It&#39;s going to be sad <br/>
and hard and will be trading off way too  much.  Your kids lost their father, <br/>
and now they&#39;ll lose the presence of  their mom, too?  There have to be other <br/>
options.<br/>
 <br/>
Can you sell your house and move in somewhere cheaper?  Your kids are  big <br/>
enough that they can go to a park, instead of needing a big yard.   Maybe you <br/>
could move into a low-maintenance townhouse or something like  that?   I like <br/>
that your son is willing to work.  Moving into  town might make that more <br/>
possible.<br/>
 <br/>
Could you take in more kids for longer hours?  Maybe a couple of  <br/>
mothers-day-out toddlers from 9-12?  <br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t forget government services.  Your situation is what they&#39;re  there for. <br/>
 No shame in it.  <br/>
 <br/>
My heart is aching for you and your situation.  I hope some of this  can help.<br/>
 <br/>
Karen<br/>

Are  there grief counselling facilities where you are?  Support groups   or <br/>
lists?  Things will probably hit later that haven&#39;t yet, for you  and the  <br/>
kids <br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
Ditto that.  <br/>
 <br/>
And also, I thought there were prohibitions against excluding people for  <br/>
pre-existing conditions these days?  Something new in the law?  My  husband has <br/>
taken Prevacid for acid reflux for about 10 years, and before  when he changed <br/>
jobs it was an issue, but this last time it was not.   Something about a new <br/>
pre-existing conditions provision.  It&#39;s worth  checking out.<br/>

say more to express what I feel in my heart for you.  <br/>
<br/>
My advice to you is stick together, cuddle with your kids a lot and <br/>
include your husband in your life inspite of his physical absense.  <br/>
What i mean is talk about him and let the children know what he would <br/>
expect of them, his interests, and so forth.  Send balloons with <br/>
messages tied to them towards the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
As far as finances goes,  reach out to loved ones for help, your <br/>
church or a church.  <br/>
<br/>
I really like the idea of finding someone who homeschools and would <br/>
be willing to *homeschool* your kids while you work part time and <br/>
then you could return the favor.  I have often thought about what I <br/>
would do if my husband passed away.  I think that is what I would try <br/>
to do. I have a single friend who has two kids and she just left her <br/>
job to homeschool her boys.  She has lived off of her summer public <br/>
school salary, used up all of her retirement money, and is hunting <br/>
desperately for a part time job.  Meanwhile she is living with a <br/>
friend, turns to her church for help with groceries, and gives back <br/>
to these people in anyway she can.... watching thier kids, cleaning <br/>
the church building and etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Let us know how things are going.  How old are your kids?  Could they <br/>
be trusted to stay home alone?  <br/>
