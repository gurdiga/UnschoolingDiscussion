right side of the screen, I believe). This will allow you to read every <br/>
message one after the other without the ads.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, you can&#39;t use the &quot;expand messages&quot; function, as far as I <br/>
know, with the search function, which would allow one to read only <br/>
messages within a single thread. Anyone figure out how to do that yet?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you read on the website, you can click &quot;Expand Messages.&quot; That <br/>
makes it much easier to read because there are no ads on the sides like <br/>
there are if you click through each individual message one at a time. <br/>
Plus, you don&#39;t have to wait for pages to load - a whole string of <br/>
messages appears on one page.<br/>
<br/>
Or - get the digest version of the list. There will normally be from 1 <br/>
to 3 or 4 digests in a day. If the list gets SUPER busy, maybe a few <br/>
more digests.  That cuts down on the number of emails you get in your <br/>
mailbox. (You&#39;ll get all the messages, but they&#39;ll be combined into a <br/>
few emails.) This won&#39;t help if you have a space limitation.<br/>
<br/>
This is all assuming that you don&#39;t have a mail program that lets you <br/>
automate putting your mail into folders, using a rule or filter of some <br/>
kind. That&#39;s the easiest way to handle large lists - because all your <br/>
mail goes to one place and most good email programs (Thunderbird, for <br/>
example) let you search a mailbox as well as put the messages in order <br/>
in different ways such as by date, by sender, by subject, and so on. <br/>
Heidi, you&#39;re using hotmail, so you can&#39;t do that, but Thunderbird is <br/>
free and you really might want to consider using it. Or look into <br/>
Google&#39;s mail program (GMail) - they now give you 2 gigs of storage <br/>
space - that&#39;s a LOT - your hotmail space is probably only 250 mb --- <br/>
so gmail gives you more than 8 times as much space.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544699742">We have Norton Firewall software on our PC and it has an ad blocking <br/>
feature! So I see the word &quot;Advertisement&quot; but that&#39;s it, most of the <br/>
time. Some ads sneak through occasionally.<br/>

Have you tried switching to digest?<br/>
If you do, please don&#39;t leave &quot;Digest #20983409&quot; as a subject line, though.<br/>
<br/>
I just get e-mail and it&#39;s quick to read and you can delete all at the end of <br/>
the session, if you want to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I&#39;m now responding to myself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been playing around with Yahoo this morning, and one of the new <br/>
features is the ability not only to &quot;expand messages&quot; but to group them <br/>
by &quot;thread&quot;--much cooler and easier to read online, imo. Unfortunately, <br/>
the search function still does not allow one to use either of these <br/>
tools when searching past messages.<br/>
