 As far as how God places children, I believe that He matches the <br/>
 correct child with the correct parents all the time, but that sin <br/>
 often gets in the way and parents don&#39;t parent the way God intended <br/>
 for them to.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So you think that the drug addict that gets pregnant and dumps her baby in <br/>
the trash was &quot;matched up&quot; by God?<br/>
He didn&#39;t know that the final result would be that?<br/>
Give me a break. Thoughts like this are insidious to me. <br/>
If God is omnipotent, wouldn&#39;t he know how sick some people are, and that <br/>
they shouldn&#39;t be parents? Why in the H**** would a loving God purposely give <br/>
some children to parents he knows would abuse them, kill them, hurt them and <br/>
then do it again and again??<br/>
Don&#39;t answer that please. I&#39;m only asking out of sheer awe that people <br/>
actually believe  this.<br/>
Not for an answer. I&#39;m sure it would repulse me.<br/>
