<div id="ygrps-yiv-442200297"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Thanks very much indeed.  The publisher says it will be off the press on<br/>
&gt; the 30th.  Folks can read a sample chapter and the foreword by Joseph<br/>
&gt; Chilton Pearce at my website  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.skylarksings.com">http://www.skylarksings.com</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t gotten it yet. I ordered it three weeks ago from<br/>
Holt and Assoc. ONe for me and, on faith, one for my very<br/>
antihomeschooling mother-in-law. From the annotation in the HOlt catelogue<br/>
it sounded like the kind of gently persuasive book she would enjoy reading<br/>
and find herself agreeing with in spite of herself. I&#39;m just so tired of<br/>
arguing with someone who is uninformed. I was surprised she agreed to read<br/>
something about homeschooling b/c she is so absolutely certain that we are<br/>
ruining our children&#39;s lives and that schools are the one and only way.<br/>
So, Iguess I&#39;m putting a lot of stock in your book as the first book she&#39;s<br/>
ever read on the subject! If she&#39;s willing after reading your book, I&#39;ll<br/>
send her some of Holt&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve loved everything you&#39;ve said so far in this chat group and I&#39;m<br/>
looking forward to your book.<br/>
