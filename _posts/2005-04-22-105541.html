<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109878038">Wow! It is true about opinions, huh? <br/>
<br/>
Well, where do I start? I hope that I respond to everyone&#39;s posts. <br/>
Here&#39;s they are in no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I&#39;m in to rap/hip-hop, so its not the music, its the idea <br/>
that you can get money and cars and the vanity this shows. That <br/>
would <br/>
be hypocrtical of me to say that (of which I didn&#39;t). <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, it was my daughter&#39;s idea to want piano lessons. I <br/>
remember <br/>
and so do some other people; heck, I couldn&#39;t believe it myself when <br/>
she said it. So, her doing &quot;schooly&quot; things isn&#39;t what&#39;s impressing <br/>
me, its the natural curiosity that makes me sit back and listen and <br/>
look at her. I didn&#39;t just smack her in to some lessons, definitely <br/>
not my style. <br/>
<br/>
James will focus on what he needs to do. What he has to do is <br/>
utilize <br/>
life and learning in a way that he can understand and like. Upon his <br/>
arrival he decided to run away when there were no rules - go out at <br/>
your discretion, here&#39;s some money, etc. His reason was because we <br/>
were too strict on cleaning up. Me referring to him as student is<br/>
just <br/>
that and nothing more. Hell, I was the one that wanted to get these <br/>
boys here so that we can help them and be more involved with helping <br/>
them to find a track.  <br/>
<br/>
Me referring to James secondly was me trying not to post his name <br/>
directly, just because of privacy. In the end that&#39;s not necessary <br/>
because I&#39;ve come/plan to come to this group with challenges we&#39;re <br/>
having regarding learning. Nothing more, really simple.<br/>
<br/>
The year hasn&#39;t gotten underway as in this is just April, the 4th <br/>
month of the year. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, all James has shown me is he knows how to use his <br/>
talents for bad (habitual lying and stealing). When I opened myself<br/>
to <br/>
him and was ready to go out/stay in and learn, he definitely used<br/>
that <br/>
to his advantage. I was the new person that didn&#39;t really know about <br/>
him and I probably wouldn&#39;t catch on to that kind of thing. Him and <br/>
his brothers have lived with us for almost 3 months now, so maybe <br/>
another side will appear.  Otherwise, when trying to talk to him he <br/>
doesn&#39;t appear confident (understandably) and clams up and doesn&#39;t <br/>
talk at all. Some have asked if he&#39;s mentally challenged. The only <br/>
person I&#39;ve heard him talk to is one of his 2 brothers that are here <br/>
they are pretty close. His non-verbal interests are obviously ones <br/>
that will get him in some deep trouble and we can aide in steering <br/>
away from those things and more toward the drumming, rap/hip-hop<br/>
which <br/>
can be composed and created and sold - things of which we can assist <br/>
him with. <br/>
<br/>
I think he should be straightforward and honorable and there is <br/>
nothing wrong with that. And, if taking away some &quot;fun&quot; is mean, oh <br/>
well, better that than him selling drugs, being on drugs, or in jail <br/>
because we didn&#39;t discipline/limit instant gratification. He has <br/>
admitted he tells grown ups what he thinks they want to hear to my <br/>
husband and my dh has tried to explain to him that this does not <br/>
make <br/>
him look good and that if anything make people not trust you. <br/>
<br/>
I really could give a f*#^ about the grade levels. I hate grades and <br/>
the fact that there are grades given. I speak that language but I <br/>
don&#39;t believe in it. What I do know is that at age 14 (as of<br/>
Monday!), <br/>
he should be more than a functioning illiterate. Should he start <br/>
reading at age 34 or 44? <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all students of life. I&#39;m definitely a student in this <br/>
experience and will continue to be. <br/>
<br/>
Ah, I just found out that he is interested in knitting (Me and my <br/>
daughter are currently learning), so we&#39;ll try that this week and<br/>
next <br/>
week. <br/>
<br/>
My friend has suggested that he does have a memory challenge and to <br/>
try some other techniques. Sorry to have posted here for this <br/>
challenge because I already know he will not be an unschooled child <br/>
for at least a year or so. Allowing him to take it upon himself to <br/>
be <br/>
interested will be us in this same spot next year about this time <br/>
and <br/>
that is not acceptable and that&#39;s the reality. I look forward to <br/>
keeping everyone updated on our progress. <br/>
<br/>
What does it mean to be educated? Throughout history many thought <br/>
the <br/>
world was flat and you&#39;d fall off of it - at one point that was <br/>
educated. Still others believe they can visit another country and <br/>
force democracy on them and that is being educated. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry I posted on the wrong group for this particular child. Look <br/>
forward to other posts about my daughter and James&#39; brother(s).<br/>
<br/>
Phew!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

People say the same things about certain college degrees.  If he  wanted to <br/>
study engineering, you&#39;d probably be supportive, but there are lots of  people <br/>
with engineering degrees who aren&#39;t working as engineers, and maybe more  with <br/>
partial engineering degrees who dropped out.  <br/>
 <br/>
People CAN get money and cars, can&#39;t they?  Haven&#39;t some gotten money  and <br/>
cars by being musicians and dancers and composers and organizers of shows,  etc.?<br/>

It IS simple, but it&#39;s not easy to see learning instead of teaching.   Your <br/>
questions were about teaching, and others &quot;opinions&quot; were about  learning.  <br/>

But you&#39;re not impressed with James&#39; natural curiosity about hip-hop and drumming?  Or do you consider it to be an unnatural curiosity becuase hip-hop is all about cars and money?  <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
James will focus on what he needs to do. What he has to do is <br/>
utilize life and learning in a way that he can understand and like. <br/>
****<br/>
He&#39;ll get to do this only if the adults in his life let him.  Otherwise, he&#39;s likely to expend all his energy rebelling against those who&#39;ve deemed his interests and passions unacceptable. <br/>
 <br/>
****<br/>
 <br/>
The year hasn&#39;t gotten underway as in this is just April, the 4th <br/>
month of the year. <br/>
 <br/>
****<br/>
Using this standard, with a lifespan of 80 yrs, the average person&#39;s life really isn&#39;t &#39;underway&#39; until he&#39;s 25. Why push him so hard now?<br/>

 <br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
People can&#39;t be forced to become honorable or straightforward.  You can, perhaps, force them to be compliant, but honor results from feeling respected and trusted. If you can&#39;t extend trust to him, he&#39;s not likely to develop honor while living in you home.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I already know he will not be an unschooled child <br/>

<br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
You can predict the future, too?  How sad for James that even his rescuer thinks he&#39;s incapable of making any progress without coercion.  <br/>
<br/>
What is it about James that you&#39;ve cast him as the one incapable of goodness and progress?  You seem to feel his brothers are capable and good, but you&#39;ve already written James off.  Does your paradigm require a bad child to make the others look good?<br/>

This is a good point.<br/>
 <br/>
Learning can&#39;t see a calendar or read a clock.<br/>
 <br/>
And the idea that first children must prepare for entry into the real world  <br/>
seems very school-style to me.  &quot;Do this and we&#39;ll declare you to be  real.&quot;<br/>

Treating them as the real, living people they already are makes a huge  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010063681">Sylvia, I agree with you on the honorable part.<br/>
<br/>
I know what I see in James and I&#39;ve seen it continuously from my own <br/>
background. Drumming, music, it doesn&#39;t matter what he&#39;s interested <br/>
in if he&#39;s not confident in his own skills and ability to do those <br/>
things. From his posture to him speaking - they have to be built <br/>
back up and we believe he lacks these things because he doesn&#39;t <br/>
read/write/add/subtract/multiply as well or at all. Period.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can predict the future: if we don&#39;t get it together and push <br/>
beyond our limits we can get caught up in to something that we will <br/>
regret. So pushing him hard to learn is not the problem. <br/>
<br/>
You have no idea what I have to say about his brothers or my <br/>
daughter because I haven&#39;t posted about them. Just tidbits about my <br/>
daughter. As far as hip hop/money, the lifestyle portrayed isn&#39;t one <br/>
that is always positive; I don&#39;t want him to think that life is <br/>
instant gratification and all about money. So, enough on that <br/>
subject there&#39;s nothing more to be read in to it. <br/>
<br/>
We happen to be discussing James because I posted particularly about <br/>
him - the one I&#39;m most concerned about. At the rate James was going, <br/>
statistically, black boys (&#39;cause that&#39;s the only experience we can <br/>
relate to) don&#39;t make it to find out about life at 25. <br/>
<br/>
No child has to be the so called bad one. I believe that we react to <br/>
our circumstances from the beginning and those reactions breed in to <br/>
deeper situations. That&#39;s what has happened to James. <br/>
<br/>
I am not a Rescuer of people, but definitely of cats and dogs and <br/>
yarn. In this situation only people can rescue themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841597257">***Firstly, I&#39;m in to rap/hip-hop, so its not the music, its the idea <br/>
that you can get money and cars and the vanity this shows. ***<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean that you believe he is interested in rap because rap videos<br/>
show lavish characters and lifestyles and you are afraid or you believe<br/>
he will be wrongly motivated by them?<br/>
<br/>
You are concerned for his education because you want him to be more than<br/>
a functioning illiterate.  To what end?<br/>
When he is educated do you expect him to be able to hold down a job so<br/>
that he can have some quality of life?  <br/>
In your opinion does a quality life *not* include money and cars?  <br/>
<br/>
First, I think a troubled fourteen year old has every right, and indeed<br/>
is demonstrating a healthy human quality when he dreams that his life can<br/>
be better.   If he can only think of a better life as a life with cars<br/>
and money, I would say that is directly because he is not experiencing<br/>
personally those things which we all know *really* make life better,<br/>
respect, acceptance, love, generosity, kindness.  (chocolate)  <br/>
 <br/>
***James will focus on what he needs to do. ***<br/>
<br/>
Earlier you said he lacks focus.   Can you tell us which it is?  Do you<br/>
mean by the sheer force of your will you will *make* James focus whether<br/>
he feels focused or not?  <br/>
<br/>
***What he has to do is utilize life and learning in a way that he can<br/>
understand and like***<br/>
<br/>
No, he doesn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to.  James *could* leave you and never come back.  <br/>
A young girl here killed herself last year.  She was younger than James<br/>
and facing many of the same issues as you describe.  She didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;<br/>
do anything after that.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you mean you would like for James to be able to find a good life? <br/>
Does it have to be on your terms only?<br/>
<br/>
***I think he should be straightforward and honorable and there is<br/>
nothing wrong with that. ***<br/>
<br/>
People are honorable when they&#39;re treated honorably.  Who has honored<br/>
James?  One moment won&#39;t be enough to show him the value of honor.  It<br/>
takes a lifetime.  In his fourteen years how many people have honored<br/>
him?  It can begin with having real consideration for the things he<br/>
loves.  By helping him do those things and have exposure to those things<br/>
and by engaging him about those things. <br/>
<br/>
***And, if taking away some &quot;fun&quot; is mean, oh <br/>
well, better that than him selling drugs, being on drugs, or in jail <br/>
because we didn&#39;t discipline/limit instant gratification. ***<br/>
<br/>
Deprivation doesn&#39;t make a person reasonable, it makes them starved and<br/>
desperate.  Desperate people do desperate things.   If his mind is filled<br/>
with negativity and hopelessness he will act like a negative and hopeless<br/>
person.  When he&#39;s filled up with positive regard and given hope he will<br/>
begin to be a positive and hopeful person.  That&#39;s the only way it can<br/>
happen.  His life has to become good and worthwhile right now if you want<br/>
to see him find goodness within himself. <br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling could be the most hopeful path for James but you have<br/>
to want the most hopeful path for James too.   If all these years in<br/>
school and all the pushing has not led him to the ability to do academic<br/>
things, you might think about whether  that approach can lead anywhere<br/>
positive.   Leave it behind.  My son learned to read by doing the things<br/>
he loved, not by having reading lessons.   Lot&#39;s of unschooled kids read<br/>
later, and if James can unschool he will not be &quot;behind&quot; he will be right<br/>
on schedule for James.   He&#39;s so young.  You have so much time, but if<br/>
you waste it by imposing on him all the terrible things his former life<br/>
imposed you won&#39;t help him. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very good and noble thing that you&#39;ve taken him and his brothers<br/>
and are trying to give them a better life.  Take an example from his<br/>
past, his schooling, and live a better example.   You&#39;re posts are filled<br/>
with negative things about him and we can understand that he&#39;s had a hard<br/>
time.   Could you write a post about all the positive things you can see<br/>
in him?  Write about his interest in music - don&#39;t post one negative<br/>
thing at all - and then let some of the people here expound on ways those<br/>
interests of his can become the biggest most positive forces in his<br/>
life,(with your help)  big enough to replace the negative realities he&#39;s<br/>
lived with until now.   This could be a really healing thing for you,<br/>
seeing as you must have and must be facing some really big challenges<br/>
now.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121063257">Latoya,<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you are posting here, it is because there is something<br/>
about an unschooling lifestyle/philosophy that resonates with you, and<br/>
because you are concerned about the children you are caring for, and<br/>
want them to be whole and self-confident.<br/>
<br/>
Precisely because of that, and because of what you&#39;ve told us about<br/>
James, he seems to be a child very much in need of unschooling. He has<br/>
only been living with you for 3 months, that&#39;s not very long,<br/>
considering all the months he&#39;s spent in other places, with people who<br/>
are not interested in making him whole, but in making him compliant.<br/>
While it may be the case that behaving as he&#39;s been told to behave<br/>
could keep him out of trouble, it is just as likely to backfire. It<br/>
sounds to me as though he is resisting all the messages that tell him<br/>
he&#39;s not good enough, by rebelling, by tuning out, at the same time<br/>
that those messages continue to eat away at him.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that he chose to run away, even though you and your<br/>
husband had given him freedoms, and money. But is it possible that<br/>
those freedoms and money were conditional? And even if they weren&#39;t,<br/>
he hasn&#39;t been with you long enough to make him think that your<br/>
relationship with him could be any different from his relationships<br/>
with other adults. When he said that he took off because you were too<br/>
strict about cleaning up, what do you suppose he meant? To some<br/>
people, it might seem like a silly reason, but does that stand in for<br/>
him saying that he doesn&#39;t trust you to care about him, unless he<br/>
picks up after himself, that your love is conditional? Might there be<br/>
something else in that statement about strict cleaning rules that a 13<br/>
year old boy has a hard time articulating?<br/>
<br/>
If he is relating to you and your husband by lying and stealing, its<br/>
possible that this is not a reflection on you, or on him, but is a<br/>
symptom of the damage that has been done to him in school, and in<br/>
other places, because he is a child, because he is black and almost a<br/>
man. Bravado, tuning you out, lying and stealing that test your<br/>
commitment to him, to me these sound like the actions of a boy trying<br/>
desperately to protect himself. Maybe the best question for you is,<br/>
how can you help him to a) protect himself from the damage that is<br/>
still being done to him, and then b) help him to make himself whole<br/>
and confident. It might help to talk to him, without a tone of voice<br/>
that says &quot;lecture&quot;, about your concerns. Not that you want him to<br/>
&quot;stay out of trouble&quot;, he&#39;s probably heard that one before, but that<br/>
you want him to be whole, that you want him to excel, and that you<br/>
want him to be self-confident. One of the tricks that has worked very<br/>
well for me in relating to my kids (and to all small humans) is<br/>
treating them and talking to them as though they were friends, about<br/>
whom I care very deeply. With the same tone of respect that I would<br/>
use with a friend I was concerned about. I wouldn&#39;t tell her what to<br/>
do or what not to do, I would tell her how much I care, and why I am<br/>
concerned.<br/>
<br/>
He is very capable, right now. He may not read well, but he is able to<br/>
get by, this takes a lot of skill. If you convince yourself that he is<br/>
capable, this will affect the way you treat him, and he will notice.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, you can still strew things in his path that he<br/>
*might* find interesting. (Recognizing that he also might not pick<br/>
them up, and that&#39;s okay). What about hiphop comics like Blokhedz, cds<br/>
of rap artists that he hasn&#39;t heard before, who are doing innovative<br/>
things with rhythym, rhyme, lyrics, social critique. Do you have<br/>
percussion instruments in the house, or could you get some?<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m interested in movies and moviemaking, but I have no interest in &quot;doing&quot;  <br/>
it (making a movie).  I love Shakespeare and Shakespeare plays, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to act in one.<br/>

An interest is a valid interest even without the wish to pursue it as a  <br/>
personal art. I can appreciate good photography but I have really no interest in  <br/>
learning how to develop a photograph.<br/>

beyond our limits we can get caught up in to something that we will  <br/>
regret. So pushing him hard to learn is not the problem. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Upon which planet have you not seen this failing again and again, in the  <br/>
MILLIONS of instances?  Kids CAN NOT be pushed beyond their limits.   Every <br/>
failure in this country probably was pushed in school, pushed by parents,  pushed <br/>
out and pushed away.<br/>
 <br/>
Pushing them hard was the problem.<br/>
IS the problem.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-You have no idea what I have to say about his brothers or my  <br/>
daughter because I haven&#39;t posted about them. Just tidbits about my  <br/>
daughter.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The comparisons were clear.  You have no idea what you communicated if  you <br/>
don&#39;t think we know ANYTHING about the others or about your attitude toward  <br/>
James.  Every word and phrase you sent communicates more than you  intended.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I don&#39;t want him to think that life is <br/>
instant gratification and  all about money. So, enough on that <br/>
subject there&#39;s nothing more to be read  in to it. <br/>
=-<br/>
 <br/>
Then don&#39;t post anymore.  If what we&#39;re writing is useless to you, and  we&#39;re <br/>
wrong, and there&#39;s nothing more to be read into or about it, why post on  an <br/>
unschooling list?  It would be like justifying spanking (repeatedly) on  a <br/>
non-spanking list.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We happen to be discussing James because I posted particularly about  <br/>
him - the one I&#39;m most concerned about.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
You happen to be discussing James for reasons you seem somewhat unsettled  <br/>
about.<br/>
We are discussing James because your stated plans are more of the same  <br/>
damage he has already suffered in the past.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I am not a Rescuer of people, but definitely of cats and dogs and  <br/>
yarn. In this situation only people can rescue themselves.<br/>

 <br/>
How will your own child(ren) rescue themselves if you bring really bad  <br/>
influences into the house?  If he&#39;s beyond saving, having him there is a  danger.  <br/>
If he is NOT beyond saving, you might want to consider not going  down the <br/>
same paths.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is damaging whether people are assumed to be more competent or<br/>
less competent because of their race. Speaking for myself, I have long<br/>
had a feeling of being unworthy of the praise that comes my way. As an<br/>
adult, I have come to realize that this has a lot to do with the<br/>
privileges of middle-classness and whiteness that have gotten me some<br/>
rewards and regard that were not necessarily deserved.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it also has something to do with being able to play the<br/>
school game, and realizing at some level that doing well in school is<br/>
not the same thing as being an accomplished learner.<br/>

 <br/>
At first, yes.<br/>
Then they get a chance to shake hands, to make eye contact or not, to exude  <br/>
confidence or to indicate years of shaming and failure.  They get a chance  to <br/>
be interesting or to mumble a few words and look away.  By that point in  the <br/>
conversation color&#39;s not much of an issue.  School and schooling are  <br/>
creating a lot of eye-contact avoidance, and a lot of hope that a piece of paper  <br/>
(diploma or degree) will take the place of their being creative and  charming.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t.<br/>
