<div id="ygrps-yiv-858456156">To all who answered my question about about how you &quot;start&quot; homeschooling and <br/>
particularly about my son&#39;s interests in wood shop and auto mechanics. You <br/>
all gave me excellent ideas and my mind is just ticking away with things we <br/>
can do now. Also, I MUCH appreciate those of you who shared that you didnt <br/>
just smoothly unschool right out of the box but that, it appears, it is a <br/>
growth process not only for the kids but for us as well.  And I think the <br/>
biggest thing I gleaned from you all is to RELAX! <br/>
With lots of thanks and feeling more encouraged,<br/>
Julie<br/>
