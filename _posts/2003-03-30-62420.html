<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148844349">I brought home some helium balloons from work tonight.<br/>
Sierra and Jalen have been enjoying them thoroughly and I keep retrieving <br/>
them from the ceiling when they let go.<br/>
It just happened again and Sierra said &quot;Mommy, the balloon fell UP again!!!&quot;<br/>
Too cute.  I want to fall up.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

Sounds like you need a little Shel Silverstein.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t find &quot;Falling Up&quot; but I found this for you.<br/>

She drank for a bottle called DRINK ME <br/>
And up she grew so tall,<br/>
She ate from a plate called TASTE ME <br/>
And down she shrank so small.<br/>
And so she changed, while other folks<br/>
Never tried nothin&#39; at all.<br/>

Anyone know why children have a &quot;fear&quot; of this. They are fine inside but outside they get pretty agitated til they are safely inside. {my husband admitedly has the same fear}<br/>
<br/>
Inside the house or other places it doesn&#39;t get out of reach {they feel this too in places like malls and stuff} they are fine with the and really enjoy them. My husband&#39;s dad has them at his establishment. But they aren&#39;t blown up unless someone asks for them.<br/>

Yes that&#39;s it the balloons going up into the sky {or really high}.<br/>
In my beliefs I wonder if it is from a past life experiance, because i can&#39;t think of anything they have experianced that would cause them to fear it. And we don&#39;t tend to tell them our fears {trying to keep from instilling them in to them} unless they mention they have a fear.<br/>
Wondering if it could be genetic. Just reminded me and I was pondering and fishing to see if anyone else had this experiance.<br/>
Like I said it isn&#39;t the balloon itself, or the fear of it popping, just I guess the detachment of it and the fear of loosing it.<br/>
