<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We&#39;re having a mighty rainy day here in NY state.  So, I was looking for<br/>
&gt;something fun for us to do today without getting too wet, and I was going<br/>
&gt;through my bookmarks to see if I could scare up something interesting.  I<br/>
&gt;was looking in a group I entitled &quot;Things We Can Build&quot; and I rediscovered<br/>
&gt;this website.  With all the recent talk about geodesic domes, and after the<br/>
&gt;fun time we had building a newspaper dome at the conference last weekend, I<br/>
&gt;thought I&#39;d pass this along for anyone who would like to build  a more<br/>
&gt;permanent geodesic dome playhouse.  Consider this:  you could also make the<br/>
&gt;upper sheathing out of  plexiglas or lexan (sp?) and build an 8-foot<br/>
&gt;greenhouse (oh boy!!).  Here&#39;s the link for the plans, which cost $29.95:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Of course, now that I think of it, the Desert Domes website has the same<br/>
&gt;kind of information available for free.<br/>
