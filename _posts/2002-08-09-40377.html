<br/>
Are you aware that the word Hell as translated is from the original word &quot;gehenna&quot; Here&#39;s the definition:<br/>
<br/>
Gehenna <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(originally Ge bene Hinnom; i.e., &quot;the valley of the sons of Hinnom&quot;), a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where the idolatrous Jews offered their children in sacrifice to Molech #2Ch 28:3 33:6 #Jer 7:31 19:2-6 This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Hebrew word for hell actually means &quot;grave or pit&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else here see the connection with the Modern idea of hell - where you go and burn  after death - if you are bad... and Dante&#39;s Inferno??<br/>

  &lt;&lt; have you ever wondered if hitler may have <br/>
  asked for forgiveness,been forgiven and will be w/ all of you in heaven?i <br/>
  have.by the way-hitler was austrian &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
  I&#39;m not going to Heaven if you think there&#39;s any chance Hitler&#39;s there.<br/>
  It&#39;s not his massive prejudices and the genocide that I see as his primary <br/>
  sin.  It&#39;s the hypocrisy, if the biographers are telling the truth that his <br/>
  own best buddies were all seriously &quot;flawed&quot; biologically.  And unless he <br/>
  dyed his hair, he wouldn&#39;t be admitted into Aryan Nation or any of todays <br/>
  &quot;ooh let&#39;s be like Hitler&quot; boys&#39; clubs.<br/>
<br/>
  If Hitler can gain eternal paradise by saying &quot;oooh, sorry God&quot; at the last <br/>
  minute, then my neighbor Helen Carter, the sweetest woman I have ever met, is <br/>
  burning in hell for that same doctrine.  Because she was Catholic and thought <br/>
  that all Protestants should just be Catholic too because it was the right way <br/>
  to worship Jesus.<br/>
<br/>
  Hell is a really stupid idea.  I wouldn&#39;t worship anyone who would come up <br/>
  with an eternal fiery pit.  But we could talk about where the ideas about <br/>
  hell were borrowed (to go with that Mardi Gras history), and how many <br/>
  cultures believe that and have similar names for it.<br/>
<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t even wish an eternal fiery pit on Hitler.<br/>

church I belong to does not have the same concept of Hell as most <br/>
others. We don&#39;t believe in a literal firey pit. We do believe that <br/>
all of the evil people will spend eternity with each other though, <br/>
and never be around good people. I think that would be all the <br/>
punishment neccessary. And by evil people, we don&#39;t mean people who <br/>
believe differently than us, we mean really evil people like Hitler, <br/>
child molestors, murders, etc. You know, people who, by just about <br/>
any standard, would be considered evil.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194685729">Bob, you&#39;re right about the references by Jesus.  <br/>
<br/>
The Greeks had the idea of Hades.  We&#39;ve been shown what the Hebrews had in <br/>
that term-slot.  The Teutonic/German languages (through the Norse, Angles and <br/>
Saxons to us) had &quot;hell,&quot; which was dark and hot and not the desired <br/>
destination.<br/>
<br/>
Where would people get the idea that under the earth there&#39;s fire that <br/>
doesn&#39;t die?  Rudimentary geology.  Volcanic mediterranean experience!  <br/>
Revelation did NOT originate in Israel (nor any region that might have been <br/>
in the past or future Israeli camping spots).  Hades was the concept/term <br/>
used in the New Testament Greek, I think.  In Latin what do they use?  I <br/>
really don&#39;t know what the Latin term was, but I assume that&#39;s what would <br/>
have gone into the Spanish, French and Italian translations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192425349">I am a Christian and the sad thing is the opinion most<br/>
people have of Christians is because of what you see<br/>
portrayed on the television, by both people who preach<br/>
and by those who are anti-Christians.  Christianity is<br/>
a belief not a religion it is the religious who have<br/>
made hell a place where heathens go.  It is the<br/>
misinterpretations people have of the Bible because of<br/>
those religious teachings that cause opinions of<br/>
others that hell is a place used as a punishment or a<br/>
tool for control.  It is not a belief that is embraced<br/>
by all Christians or even by God.  <br/>

I second that -  I feel quite alone because although I am a Christian in the sense that I believe in Christ - my Christianity is not the same as what is put forth by the masses. I would probably be considered a heathen~ :)<br/>

  I am a Christian and the sad thing is the opinion most<br/>
  people have of Christians is because of what you see<br/>
  portrayed on the television, by both people who preach<br/>
  and by those who are anti-Christians.  Christianity is<br/>
  a belief not a religion it is the religious who have<br/>
  made hell a place where heathens go.  It is the<br/>
  misinterpretations people have of the Bible because of<br/>
  those religious teachings that cause opinions of<br/>
  others that hell is a place used as a punishment or a<br/>
  tool for control.  It is not a belief that is embraced<br/>

  &gt;   The Hebrew word for hell actually means &quot;grave or<br/>

We don&#39;t know, do we? But based on what we have -- the Biblical record -- it <br/>
says that he said God can send both body and soul to hell. Whether we believe <br/>
it or not, or whether we rely on interpretation to deal with it, that is <br/>
still what the record says. And that is all I was saying.<br/>
