<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305195715">I want to share what just happened today:<br/>
<br/>
My ds John 14 was asked a few weeks ago to be in a play at a private school <br/>
about three blocks from our house.  We know many of the students and <br/>
teachers there and they know John - that&#39;s why he was asked.  The play will <br/>
be at the end of this month.  Every day (M-Sat) he&#39;s been going to rehearsal <br/>
at the school.  He usually walks there and walks back home.  Someimes we&#39;ll <br/>
give him a ride if we&#39;re going out, and sometimes a friend will bring him <br/>
home.  Hte rehearsal is from 3:30 to 5:30 or 6:00 on weekdays.   Yesterday <br/>
they got out about 5:15, so when he wasn&#39;t home at 6 today I thought they <br/>
probably stayed late to make up the time.  It&#39;s the musical Crazy For You, <br/>
with lots of singing and dancing, so he&#39;s usually very tired when he gets <br/>
home.  I thought I&#39;d b nice and go pick him up since it was late.  I drove <br/>
down, went into the main hall, where &quot;visitors&quot; sign in and out, and looked <br/>
at the shett.  He&#39;d signed out at 5:20.  Oh, great...  I went back home - <br/>
still not there.  Called his two close friends (who are in the show) about <br/>
6:15 and asked if they&#39;d seen him after rehearsal.  Nope.  They suggested he <br/>
might have gone downtown (two more blocks past the school) to the coffee <br/>
shop.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - so dh and I got in the car and drove down the main street.  While <br/>
doing this we saw three men walking down the street, having a fight - <br/>
arguing, pushing and starting to punch.   They stopped when we drove by.  We <br/>
thought about going by the police station to report it but then forgot <br/>
because we were looking for John.  Not in any of the three coffee shops in <br/>
town.  Not walking up and down the streets.  Drove back by the house - not <br/>
there.  Hadn&#39;t called.<br/>
<br/>
Drove around downtown (about four blocks wide and six blocks long) some <br/>
more.  Had four police cars go zooming past.  Nerve-racking.  Decided to <br/>
&quot;follow&quot; them by going around the block and driving down the main street <br/>
again.  Saw the two men who were together coming down the street. An officer <br/>
stopped them - &quot;do you have any weapons?- no, sir.  Do you have ID? - <br/>
Here...We kept driving and saw the third man(who had been following and <br/>
yelling at the two) lying on the sidewalk.  No idea how hurt he was, but at <br/>
least he was moving around some.  Still hadn&#39;t found John.<br/>
<br/>
Drove by the house again, but not there.  Decided to go by the school and <br/>
see if he had stayed there (after signing out).  The musical director (a <br/>
good friend) was there and began calling some of the cast.  One girl <br/>
suggested that he might be at another girl&#39;s house, as she lives literally <br/>
just across the street from the school and often has a lot of the kids over <br/>
(John had never been there, though.)  Sure enough, when I called there and <br/>
talked to the mother, he was there, along with a whole group.  She went and <br/>
told him we were at the school and he walked out to the car.  She mst have <br/>
told him I was mad (I wasn&#39;t) because taht&#39;s the first thing he asked hs dad <br/>
(I was still talking with my friend - getting the info on how to buy play <br/>
tickets).  I&#39;m sure John knew I wasn&#39;t mad when I got to the car, though, <br/>
because I asked him if there were still a lot of kids there and if he wanted <br/>
to go back.  He said yes and no, because his best friend there had already <br/>
left and besides he was getting hungry (by this time it was 7:30).<br/>
<br/>
He told me he hadn&#39;t thought to call, because he knew he didn&#39;t have <br/>
anything to do this evening and so it was fine.  I told him it was fine to <br/>
go and be there, but to Please call next time just to let as know where he <br/>
was so we wouldn&#39;t worry.  Usually he&#39;s very good about telling me he&#39;s <br/>
leaving the house or has gotten home or calling to ask about going out <br/>
somewhere.   I think what happened today is that he was with a whole big <br/>
group doing a new thing (for him) and he was excited about it and so didn&#39;t <br/>
even think past the moment.  Hopefully he&#39;ll remember to call next time.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Staunton, VA, a small city of about 20,000.  No, people aren&#39;t <br/>
beat up on the main street in broad daylight very often.  And my son does <br/>
not disappear for two hours very often either - fortunately.  I&#39;m just glad <br/>
he&#39;s home and we&#39;re all together tonight.<br/>

PS - No, we don&#39;t have cell phones.  Had them, didn&#39;t like them that much. <br/>
Will probably get them again when John starts driving.  Maybe sooner.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046400783">I would&#39;ve been mad. It&#39;s not cool, in my book, for kids to be expected at a certain time and not have checked in when it&#39;s an hour and a half past that time. It&#39;s inconsiderate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I would have done anything differently, except that I would have been mad, and told Rain. <br/>
<br/>
I was half an hour late tonight, getitng done with work, so I called Rain and let her know. That&#39;s only half an hour, but it&#39;s nighttime and we just moved here and I thought she might be concerned.<br/>
<br/>
We have cell phones, too. Can&#39;t imagine life without &#39;em.<br/>

I pretty much always know where even my 20 year old daughter is - and <br/>
that that is kind of weird &lt;G&gt;. We have cell phones with no charge to <br/>
call anybody in our own service - so anybody in our family is free. We <br/>
call each other all day long - just to ask the silliest little quick <br/>
questions or to vent when we&#39;re upset or to share a good moment or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
