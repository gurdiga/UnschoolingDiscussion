<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923453419">I had to blink and read again when I saw this, cos I&#39;ve gone through this last year, I think I&#39;m on the way over it, but it remains to be seem :-)  I knew moving would be difficult, since the house was not my choice and would not have been my choice, but I was not prepared for the depths of depression I went in last year, mostly, if not all, house-related.  Took me a while to figure out that I was grieving!  Thanks for affirming my self-diagnosis!!<br/>

  Hi Sandi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &lt;cut&gt; everyone seemed fine.  Our discussions over the<br/>
  &gt; years have shown that it was much more traumatic than I realized for them<br/>
  &gt; even though they adjusted okay.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, already I have become faintly aware of this. Our 12yo who has wanted for<br/>
  always to move to the country, started exhibiting strange behaviour, and it<br/>
  emerged that although he loves living here, he was still going through a major<br/>
  grieving for all that has been his life until now, and has been left behind. The<br/>
  2 that weren&#39;t that keen on moving seem almost to be handling it better -<br/>
  perhaps their low expectations enabled them to be pleasantly surprised!<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I had tried to keep them aware of all<br/>
  &gt; plans, choices, etc during the change, but they still felt they had no<br/>
  &gt; choice.<br/>
<br/>
  I do feel bad about this - children have so little choice really, in so many<br/>
  areas of their lives. Even when we, as individual families, allow our children<br/>
  choice, they soon become aware that other families don&#39;t work like that, and<br/>
  that their choice is only theirs by virtue of our choice to allow it.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I always found life in general to be a balancing act.  Home birth,<br/>
  &gt; attachment parenting, homeschooling, all of these things that grow children<br/>
  &gt; so well, and have the potential to grow parents well, too, can also be<br/>
  &gt; draining if you don&#39;t find the balance that you need.<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, and I&#39;ve never been to good at balancing - I always did choose the swing<br/>
  rather than the seesaw at the playground &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
