<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I too think things have been handled , &quot;eventually&quot; 
in a  peaceful manner, and since I&#39;m on digest, to cut down on the incoming 
mail, I don&#39;t use the luxury of deleting subject lines I am not interested 
in.(tha tis my choice)&nbsp; But on other moderated lists..things just seemed(to 
me) to run a bit more smoothly.&nbsp; ANd it seems with the size of the list it 
wouldn&#39;t hurt.&nbsp; Moderators do not censor, they just offer the basic 
guidelines, that someone may have overlooked.&nbsp; SUch as &quot; Please refain from 
flaming&quot;&nbsp; Or &quot; Please take this heated topic off list&quot;&nbsp; or&nbsp; the 
like.&nbsp; Perhaps we don&#39;t specifically &quot;need&quot; one, but may on the other hand 
still benefit from one, but I agree that the unmoderated list moderators would 
be the ones to talk to about that.&nbsp; ALthough some people may not consider 
some of the conversations that have gone on &quot;argumentative&quot;,&nbsp; I would think 
some may have been quite heated , flaming, and argumentative, and when I get 
two, three, even four or more digests which are 3/4 or more of the same heated 
argument.a week....I could see why people become discouraged and unsub, when all 
we really needed to have done was perhaps some one(i.e: a list mamma) say&nbsp; 
&quot; please continue this heated conversation off list.&nbsp; I tis becoming 
heated, and we prefer to keep our topics cool.&nbsp; Thank You, List MOderator , 
SO and SO.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just my 2 cents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle
