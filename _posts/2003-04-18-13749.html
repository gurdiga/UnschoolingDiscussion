<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938999753">Was it on this list that someone was looking for a CD ROM that would allow <br/>
their son to make his own games?  If not I&#39;ll post on the other list LOL.<br/>
<br/>
My boys found one that is called, Warcraft III.  It has a world editor on it. <br/>
 It is sort of like other games in that you have preprogrammed buildings and <br/>
terrain features with units etc but on this one you can edit all of the above <br/>
to change weapons, color, range, and all the other features.  They really are <br/>
enjoying it.<br/>
