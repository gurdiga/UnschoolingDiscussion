<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022522853">Hi all - <br/>
 <br/>
My 16, almost 17 year old son has his heart on a military  career.  He went <br/>
to visit a Marine Recruiter today, and was told that you  cannot enter the <br/>
Marines with a GED...only a high school diploma.  I KNOW  I&#39;ve heard differently <br/>
through the years, but we are not members of HSLDA so I  can&#39;t ask them.  Does <br/>
anyone know about this?  Thanks<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971709823">I don&#39;t know what state you&#39;re in, but some states issue a High School Diploma for those completing the GED test.  For all intents and purposes -- even military service -- it&#39;s identical to one granted by any high school.  <br/>
 <br/>
You might also check your state&#39;s homeschooling laws to see what is required to draft your own high school diploma, or if your son could receive one thru an umbrella school. <br/>
 <br/>
Another option would be for him to try college first -- many community colleges will accept anyone age 18, without even asking for a HS diploma.  After a couple of years, students can transfer to a 4yr college, or just receive an AA at the comm. college.  Once you can produce a college degree of some sort, a hs diploma isn&#39;t an issue.  It would also give him a few years to explore his talents, interests and skills, making him potentially more valuable to the Marine Corps.  Such a path might keep him out of the current war, altho it&#39;s looking like it may well outlast the average college stay.<br/>

****************************************************<br/>
From the official marines website, marines.com:<br/>
&quot;I have my GED. Can I be a Marine?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
GEDs are accepted in certain circumstances. You need to talk to your <br/>
recruiter about eligibility requirements for the Marines.<br/>
*************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also found this post, on a website called grunt.com <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.grunt.com/forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&TOPIC_ID=6499)">http://www.grunt.com/forum/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&TOPIC_ID=6499)</a>, a <br/>
post by a mom who goes into a little more detail, here&#39;s an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
***********************************************************<br/>
&quot;While he was testing they told me that they have three tiers - Tier <br/>
1 is a traditional high school graduate, tier 2 is a non traditional <br/>
high school grad (i.e. Homeschooler or GED recipient etc...) and the <br/>
third tier is a drop out and they don&#39;t want them. They take very <br/>
few young men from tier 2 - I think he said only two percent or <br/>
something ridiculously low like that. Once a tier two has 15 college <br/>
credits they considder them on the same level as a tier one, so <br/>
Michael is now a tier 1. Once they get 27 college credits they can <br/>
enlist at the same rank and pay scale as a young man with an AA or <br/>
AS Degree&quot;<br/>
******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is accurate info or not, but sounds pretty <br/>
plausible to me. If the above info is correct, your son just has to <br/>
get 15 college credits in order to be considered the same as a HS <br/>
graduate...thats about one semester of college, give or take a few <br/>
credits. <br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
Education - As with the Army and Air Force, those without a high school  <br/>
education are ineligible. The Marine Corps limits GED enlistments to no more  than <br/>
five percent per year. Those with a GED must score a minimum of 50 on the  <br/>
AFQT to even be considered.<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Whether that is up to date or not, I don&#39;t know.  But it&#39;s  something.  I <br/>
guess if he waited until the beginning of the year, he might  get into that 5%.  <br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a recruiter turning away anyone who is  interested at this <br/>
point; recruiting rates are pretty low.<br/>

Have him do whatever you want to qualify for &quot;graduation&quot;, issue him <br/>
a diploma (www.homeschooldiploma.com) and he is done.<br/>

A high school diploma from an accredited high school is more than a piece of <br/>

If the Marines will take high school diplomas from NON-accredited high <br/>
schools, then that&#39;s a possibility.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Some college&quot; always trumps &quot;high school diploma.&quot;<br/>
This is a good alternative.  Maybe he&#39;ll find something at college that <br/>
appeals to him more than the marines, and if he doesn&#39;t, then the parents know he <br/>
really wants to pursue that, but it being a bad season to be a marine, I think <br/>
a year of college might be a great requirement to press.<br/>

In New Mexico it&#39;s that way at first, if it&#39;s taken young.  But I think if <br/>
one waits a while they get a different paper.  I don&#39;t know the ages or <br/>
cut-offs, but I&#39;ve seen a couple that other homeschoolers got and it looks just like <br/>
and says &quot;High School Diploma&quot; but lists the state board of education or some <br/>
state agency as the issuing &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that after a while, for adults, they just get the same old &quot;GED <br/>
certificate.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Each service can determine their own recruitment rule about this -- but <br/>
a GED does put him in what they call &quot;Tier 2&quot; as opposed to Tier 1 <br/>
which is a traditional high school diploma. Some recruiters will take <br/>
Tier 2 and some won&#39;t - depends, apparently, on the service and on how <br/>
their recruiting is going. For about 5 years they did away with this <br/>
distinction and accepted a GED just like a high school diploman, then <br/>
did an analysis of the attrition rates of those with just a GED <br/>
compared to those with a diploma. Those with just GED&#39;s had a <br/>
significantly higher attrition rate and therefore are not as desired as <br/>
recruits. He can get into Tier 1, even without a traditional high <br/>
school diploma, by taking 15 or more units of college work. That&#39;s the <br/>
easiest thing to do.<br/>

younger than 18, without a high school diploma, as special admit <br/>
students - to take a class or two. My youngest daughter  has just <br/>
followed in her sister&#39;s footsteps by signing up for her first college <br/>
courses at 13 years old - both music classes. It took some effort to <br/>
get all the permissions that she needed - a counselor&#39;s approval, the <br/>
fine art dean&#39;s approval, the vice president of academic affairs, and <br/>
then applying to the college and getting registered, but she&#39;s in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t even need the degree, they only need 15 units of college to <br/>
be moved into &quot;Tier 1&quot; for recruitment purposes - the top tier. Fifteen <br/>
units is typically 5 courses - of the usual academic type courses like <br/>
English, history, economics, psychology, etc. Foreign language and math <br/>
courses are often as many as 5 units each -- 3 semesters of college <br/>
Spanish class would, for example, get him moved to Tier 1. Fine arts <br/>
classes and PE classes are usually 1 to 3 units - so it would take more <br/>
classes to qualify.<br/>

THis is probably what he&#39;ll do. He&#39;s not happy about it, because he has no  <br/>
desire to go to college, but it may end up being a blessing in disguise.   <br/>
Maybe he&#39;ll see college isn&#39;t so bad, and go ahead and get a degree before  <br/>
entering the military.  Then he&#39;d go in as an officer and his pay would  double.  <br/>
When my husband was in the military he was always an E4 or  below, and it&#39;s <br/>
tough making it on that pay without a second income.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257850945">Well, most Coast Guard units aren&#39;t deployed overseas.<br/>
Those that are are mostly either TacLet (Tactical Law<br/>

Securitymen (a ranking only for reservists). I know we<br/>
do have a few cutters escorting Navy vessels, but<br/>
compared to the entire Coast Guard it&#39;s not that many.<br/>

The Coast Guard would certainly be a way to serve<br/>
without quite so much risk of being involved firsthand<br/>
in frontline duty. However, it does have it&#39;s own<br/>
risks. <br/>

now in Kosovo, for at least a year. He&#39;s newly married, to a woman <br/>
with two small children. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my nephew joined the Navy and is now living his dream of <br/>
living in Japan, eating sushi all the time, and has a Japanese <br/>
girlfriend. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557092434">Does the Coast Guard have longer enlistment contracts than the other branches?  I remember a guy in high school who signed up for the CG and it was a 6yr term vs. the 2 or 4 yr terms the other guys did in the Army or Marines.  It was also in Antarctica -- no risk of war there, but 6 years is a long time to be cold! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Also, there&#39;s the Merchant Marines.  I don&#39;t know much about them, but my brother tried to talk my oldest son into the MM when he was considering the Marine Corps, on the premise that the MM isn&#39;t about wartime service and he thought had less risk of being killed in action.  Thankfully, the whole Marine thing blew over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203376592">I believe initial enlistments are still 4 years, but<br/>
my husband&#39;s last re-up was for 6. I don&#39;t recall if<br/>
there is a 6 year option for a initial enlistment<br/>
anymore..I joined up 10 years ago! LOL funny you<br/>
mention Antarctica..I had really wanted duty on the<br/>
Polar Star or Polar Sea so I could go there (they<br/>
alternate years) but the week I graduated boot camp,<br/>
they didn&#39;t have any openings, yet two companies back<br/>
sent 6 people to the Star! Oh well, I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>
meant to go to Antarctica just yet. Maybe someday!<br/>
