<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802569399">I wanted to comment on Sandra&#39;s post (wanted to quote it but can&#39;t find it <br/>
now!) about how we as unschoolers/homeschooler are almost looked at as <br/>
unpatriotic, or to me, quitters, abandoning the public school in their time <br/>
of need (taking good kids from the school, taking money, lowering test <br/>
scores, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in CA, I got stuck on graveyard shift at work and was dying, <br/>
couldn&#39;t get any sleep, and out of desperation put the kids in school for <br/>
about 4 months at the end of a school year.  At the beginning of the next <br/>
year when we didn&#39;t show up, the school called and I just told them the kids <br/>
would be homeschooling again..no problem, no hassles.  The classrooms there <br/>
were packed like sardines, they had so many problems with bad test scores, <br/>
non-English speaking children, they almost seemed glad to be rid of a few <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
But here, in WV, a tiny community with very few good jobs, they get angry at <br/>
homeschoolers with a vengeance!  There was an article in our paper saying <br/>
that homeschoolers are taking money from the schools, taking away jobs <br/>
because there are less children...unbelievable.  Nothing about how the school <br/>
could attract more students, try to accommodate homeschoolers, or pointing <br/>
out the school&#39;s good points...it was all about money.  Life in our tiny town <br/>
EVOLVES AROUND the public school (and especially public school sports.)  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, our Michael told one of his teachers he would be homeschooling next <br/>
year, and she called asking what the problem is, etc...we talked for a long <br/>
time.  2 weeks later, Michael came home with the &quot;student of the Month&quot; <br/>
award...hmmm...funny, about 3 or 4 weeks ago he was spending time in the <br/>
principal&#39;s office for bad behavior  a couple times per week....<br/>

I LOVE typos like that.<br/>
My laugh-life sometimes revolves around typos like that.<br/>
<br/>
I once referred to the only male on a list as &quot;our long male member,&quot; only I <br/>
made a typo and he was known thereafter as &quot;our long male member.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
I guess I can&#39;t type &quot;lone male member&quot; very well at all!!!<br/>
<br/>
LONE male member.  lone lone lone lone ranger, not lonG ranger...  though <br/>
long-range makes sense, but lone, lone, lone member<br/>

Once on a message board I used to frequent a lady said that she worked, &quot;fart <br/>
time&quot; (accidentally, she meant part time.)  Another member came back and <br/>
wrote, &quot;You mean they pay you for that?&quot;  and another said, &quot;My husband would <br/>
be a natural.  Where can he get a job like that?&quot;  It went on and on...lots <br/>
of fun.<br/>

Oh my!  I bet he really appreciated that comment!  Probably made his day <br/>
everytime he saw it!  Too funny!<br/>
