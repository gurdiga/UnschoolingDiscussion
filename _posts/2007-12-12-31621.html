<div id="ygrps-yiv-236280238">Just wanted to give props to you, Sandra, for the great job you did <br/>
last night on the Alan Colmes radio show.<br/>
<br/>
It must have been frustrating not being able to string 3 sentences <br/>
together without getting interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
I was pleased that the callers I heard agreed with you, that <br/>
unschooling made intuitive sense to them.<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful we have you as a spokesperson for unschooling!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645654655">Thank you for the positive feedback.  I was exhausted after that was  <br/>
all over, after the adrenaline and frustration, and listening to the  <br/>
whole three hours of the show, and talking to the kids and Keith  <br/>
afterwards (he didn&#39;t listen, but I told him how I thought it went).   <br/>
I went to bed before long.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written a follow-up here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/</a> <br/>

<br/>
Oh wait....<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t listen to the radio show, but he did listen to me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith had had people over to sing from 7:00 to 8:30, and was tired  <br/>
from that and a long day of work, so he opted out of listening to me  <br/>
on the radio.  I don&#39;t mind.  It was the same old thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140427932">I have to second that.  I thought you made some great points.  You&#39;re a <br/>
great inspiration and indeed a great spokesperson for unschooling!<br/>
