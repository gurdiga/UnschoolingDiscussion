<br/>
We&#39;re some of those people who talk a lot, too.  Erica talks to anyone and<br/>
everyone.  Like if we went to the beach, within minutes she&#39;d be building<br/>
sand castles with some kid she just met.  Sean would ask me how she could<br/>
make so many friends so quickly, not that he wanted to do it, just that he<br/>
didn&#39;t know how she did it.  I think that people who don&#39;t like to talk are<br/>
too worried about what others think of them.<br/>

We just rented Cowboy Bebop.  My kids loved it.<br/>

I think it&#39;s just a talent.<br/>

Howard Gardner says (which I&#39;ve said lots of times this week &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
interpersonal intelligence is something people either have or they don&#39;t, and while it <br/>
can be honed and nurtured, it can&#39;t be created where there&#39;s not the talent or <br/>
inclination.<br/>

No sense keeping after a non-singer to sing, SING!<br/>
<br/>
Just send the singer when you need to win points in a singing contest and <br/>
send the friendly one over when you need to get information or want an <br/>
introduction.<br/>

Holly makes friends super easily.  Very cute and forward.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the Weird Al Concert, we hung around in the giganto lobby (lobby <br/>
bigger than the theatre, seemed) and I saw people I knew--four adults and a <br/>
couple of kids, not counting those who were among the thirteen in our group.  But <br/>
KIRBY!  Golly, even the other teens were shaking their heads and saying <br/>
&#39;wow.&#39;  <br/>
<br/>
Probably because he works at a store so he&#39;s a known person and has a <br/>
distinctive name, but all around us people would say &quot;KIRBY!&quot; and he&#39;d high-five them <br/>
and do the suave chit-chat.  I was proud to be with Kirby!  He was cool. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Or sometimes they just don&#39;t see the point in blathering on the way people like myself do.  I&#39;m one of those people who will talk to themselves if there is nobody around to listen.  It&#39;s luck I have somany kids as people assume I&#39;m chatting with the Baby.  Oh and my neighbor think im nuts &#39;cause I sing -a lot- to myself.  And since I don&#39;t know all the words to a single song it&#39;s usually some sort of made up hodge podge thing.  He he he I wonder when my kids will start having issues with it?  Tee Hee.<br/>
