<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710068055">In my vocabulary &quot;chores&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are our responsibilities around the house, whether they be chores for my<br/>
&gt; husband, myself, or my children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After the discussion on this list about responsibilities, and who <br/>
should clean and pick up, my husband and I had a discussion about <br/>
this, as well as principles vs. rules.  <br/>
<br/>
We agreed that it is nobody&#39;s responsibility to do any chore unless <br/>
they want to.  That mean him, me and the kids.  Nobody has to clean <br/>
or pick up anything unless they want to.  We have agreed that you <br/>
can&#39;t force responsibility on someone else, they have to freely want <br/>
that responsibility.  <br/>
<br/>
I got married because I wanted to keep house, so I chose that.  My <br/>
kids didn&#39;t.  They don&#39;t have the same desire to keep house that I <br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
Since we agreed that nobody HAS to do any chores, including me, <br/>
things have been getting done pretty easily around here, and without <br/>
much fuss.  Yesterday my older son decided to clean the bathroom and <br/>
the catbox without me asking.  Today he mowed our back lawn, which <br/>
was getting pretty tall.  I never asked him to do it.<br/>
<br/>
I washed the dishes pretty much all week, but yesterday I didn&#39;t feel <br/>
like it, so I didn&#39;t.  When my husband got home, he did them because <br/>
he felt like he wanted to see the countertops clean.  He did this <br/>
with no malice, without being mad because I hadn&#39;t done them , which <br/>
meant that he had to.  <br/>
<br/>
Responsibility should be freely accepted an not forced.  I don&#39;t like <br/>
to call them &quot;chores&quot; because something that is a chore is not <br/>
enjoyed, it&#39;s like a duty that has to be done.  Often when we are <br/>
&quot;doing our duty&quot; we aren&#39;t happy about it.  But when I freely choose <br/>
to do a household cleaning activity because I want the joy that I am <br/>
going to feel by getting it done, that is a better situation.  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe anybody should do anything because the &quot;have&quot; to, only <br/>
because they choose to, with joy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361076811">Someone mentioned that she doesn&#39;t make kids do chores and that her husband<br/>
feels (or maybe felt?) that the children would not gain a sense of<br/>
responsibility otherwise. She wasn&#39;t seeking advice on that<br/>
topic so I&#39;m presenting it as a separate topic. In my vocabulary &quot;chores&quot;<br/>
are our responsibilities around the house, whether they be chores for my<br/>
husband, myself, or my children.<br/>
<br/>
I feel it is essential that a child have responsibilities within the family<br/>
that he/she is a part of. My children have always been unschooled but I<br/>
would never dream of letting them shirk their responsibility to help in<br/>
household chores. I feel they must contribute to the family - that&#39;s part of<br/>
being in a family. Their father and I would do anything for them, but that<br/>
doesn&#39;t include doing all the chores that they are capable of helping with.<br/>
The older they get, the more responsibility they get. I haven&#39;t folded<br/>
towels in years or unloaded a dishwasher as that is part of their<br/>
responsibility now. I do the other part of the laundry and I load. &lt;g&gt; Many<br/>
times I had to insist that it be done, but for the most part they know they<br/>
have to help out and I don&#39;t have to keep reminding them. And my kids don&#39;t<br/>
get paid an allowance for doing what, IMO, they should rightly be involved<br/>
in - keeping the house functional. (My nephew doesn&#39;t do squat unless he<br/>
gets paid and even then he&#39;ll hand it off to someone else.)  Now, by some<br/>
standards we still do have a messy house (and dusty, that&#39;s one chore we all<br/>
avoid) but since I didn&#39;t make all the<br/>
mess, it&#39;s not all my responsibility to clean it all up when the time comes.<br/>

girlfriend who comes over sometimes, so he cares about the house being clean<br/>
and tidy.  So he cleans and tidies.  He might do different chores along that<br/>
line than I would, but that means more is getting done.  And what&#39;s getting<br/>
done is what&#39;s important to each of us.  He&#39;s also taken over looking after<br/>
the house plants, because I kept killing them with neglect.  At first I took<br/>
it as a criticism of me, but now I&#39;m glad he saw it as important.  (And when<br/>
he moves out, I&#39;ll probably send the plants with him.)  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-587274779">My children are pretty little yet (4 and 1), so the thought of assigning<br/>
chores hasn&#39;t been an issue in our house, although I have friends who do<br/>
have chore charts for their children my daughter&#39;s age.<br/>
<br/>
My take on this is that it&#39;s not necessary to assign chores in order for the<br/>
children to contribute to the family. I&#39;ll ask Accalia if she wants to help<br/>
fold laundry, vacuum, unload the dishwasher, etc., and sometimes she will<br/>
and sometimes she&#39;ll say &quot;No thanks!&quot;. About a month or so ago she went<br/>
through a huge folding phase where she&#39;d take all of the towels out of a<br/>
kitchen drawer and fold them and put them away - very nice :) There are<br/>
times where she&#39;ll want a lot of floor space in the living room and is the<br/>
one to pick up all of the toys on the floor and put them away without me<br/>
suggesting it.<br/>
<br/>
She knows that I appreciate when she helps out, and I think that will<br/>
continue as she gets older. I don&#39;t think as she gets older she&#39;ll decide<br/>
she&#39;s just going to have a free ride and not want to help out. Having not<br/>
BTDT, though, I could be way off :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520766607">We are struggling with this idea ourselves.  Our 5yo leaves his <br/>
shoes where ever they come off, hates to clean anything, etc. etc.  <br/>
I really don&#39;t make him do much because to be honest the situation <br/>
becomes unbearable.  Occasionally, I give him really little things <br/>
that are easy to do and he will be successful at.  Like helping with <br/>
the light bags from the grocery store, or putting dirty clothes in <br/>
the hamper.  Sometimes he is fine and others you would have thought <br/>
I had asked him to put his hand in boiling water..LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
He needs very small jobs or he gets overwhelmed and it turns into a <br/>
meltdown.  My expectations match his needs now.  I have become more <br/>
aware that when he is tired or hungry, it might not be the best time <br/>
to make my point about everyone helping in the family.   <br/>
<br/>
However, we do wonder if we are letting him become *lazy*.  For now, <br/>
we do not have a set of chores, but I wonder if a few little jobs he <br/>
must complete will help him with responsibility?  What are everyones <br/>
thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>with.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The older they get, the more responsibility they get.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We usually set aside one morning a week to do most routine chores; we call<br/>
it our &quot;weekly home blessing&quot; a la Flylady.  My 10 yo ds and 6 yo dd each<br/>
have 2-3 things they are responsible for.  2.5 yo ds tries to jump in here<br/>
and there as he can.  Sometimes we use a timer to motivate us for 10 minute<br/>
work segments and alternating break times.<br/>
<br/>
The number one thing that makes it work is that we are all--myself<br/>
included--working at the same time.  I think one thing that made me resent<br/>
chores so much as a child was the sense that I was being forced to do the<br/>
unpleasant jobs my parents didn&#39;t want to do and had no option about what to<br/>
do.  My kid brother did the &quot;boy&quot; chores and I did the &quot;girl&quot; chores (ever<br/>
notice there are more of the latter than the former?).  Meanwhile my parents<br/>
didn&#39;t do routine housecleaning chores at all.    My allowance was<br/>
contingent on adequate completion of chores by week&#39;s end, but I couldn&#39;t<br/>
choose to forgo a given chore, even if I was willing to forgo a portion of<br/>
my allowance, until my senior year in high school.  That year I decided to<br/>
drop *all* chores outside of cleaning my own room and bathroom.  I had a<br/>
$50/week job, so the hassle of chores I hated was no longer worth the<br/>
$15/week I earned doing chores.<br/>
<br/>
My children do get weekly allowances.  I try to keep the allowances<br/>
separated from the chores.  Ideally, the idea is you do chores because you<br/>
are a member of the family and you get allowances because you are a member<br/>
of the family.  I do encourage the completion of chores as a prerequisite to<br/>
being free to have some fun activity (i.e., we need to do our chores before<br/>
we can go to the park this afternoon).  That&#39;s more of a work-before-play<br/>
thing, though.<br/>
<br/>
My children have input on which chores they do.  (Plus their respective ages<br/>
limit what they&#39;re able to do at present.)  I feel it&#39;s not appropriate or<br/>
helpful to a future householder to just say it should be a child&#39;s choice<br/>
whether or not to help with household management.  In families things *do*<br/>
have to get done--we can&#39;t just decide not take out the trash or wash the<br/>
laundry.  The choice comes in how the child will help.  (And yes, I do think<br/>
that should have applied to me as a teen--was it right that I could decide<br/>
to ditch all chores just because I could earn more money working outside the<br/>
home?  It would have been a lot better if my folks had made a list of all<br/>
the chores that needed to get done in the week and let us all divvy them<br/>
up--perhaps I would have enjoyed mowing the yard on the riding mower,<br/>
something my brother loathed, and I know I would have rather he cleaned his<br/>
own pee-spills up in the bathroom than that being my job!)<br/>

I mentioned the kids not having to do chores. This has been a gradual<br/>
change. I have just slowly stopped &#39;making&#39; the kids do stuff. I do still<br/>
ask if I need help and mostly they do help me out.<br/>
<br/>
We are all sick at the moment. We ate late last night and Mia was ready for<br/>
bed as soon as we finished. I got her ready for bed and was in with her for<br/>
about an hour while she went to sleep. Mark had gone outside so the boys<br/>
were left in the living room alone. When I came through, they had cleared<br/>
and wiped the table, tidied the entire lounge room and their craft tables.<br/>
The room looked so beautiful. They didn&#39;t have to do it, but they wanted to<br/>
contribute and do something kind for me. And they did it despite having sore<br/>
throats and nasty coughs.<br/>
<br/>
We have a lot more peace  now that I have ripped down their chores chart and<br/>
I have kids who are 99% of the time really happy to help out and tell me<br/>
often how much they appreciate all that I do.<br/>
<br/>
Works for us.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; being in a family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I realized that my kids do contribute to the family in lots of ways, <br/>
but somehow we tend to not value those ways as much as <br/>
chores.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
One of my kids is great at decorating. She rearranges table tops, <br/>
couch cushions, rugs and plants to make rooms more pleasing.<br/>
<br/>
One of my kids is good at relieving tension with a sense of <br/>
humor.<br/>
<br/>
Another one is the first to offer to play a game with a sibling who <br/>
needs a playmate.<br/>
<br/>
Two of them will offer to pick up slack for me (dish washing, <br/>
straightening or even simply going along on errands to keep me <br/>
company).<br/>
<br/>
Our kids still do family clean up stuff: dishes, lawn mowing, and <br/>
laundry. But we&#39;ve totally changed what that means due to <br/>
unschooling. We have seven people in the family and we make <br/>
big messes. The kids agreed (in dialog with us) that something <br/>
organized would make living together better than nothing. So we <br/>
have divvied up the way we get the house cleaned. But we&#39;ve <br/>
taken their input seriously and have made big changes in <br/>
expectations.<br/>
<br/>
No one does a job that brings him/her to tears (we&#39;ve seen that). <br/>
If someone is really pressed, has an opportunity or is simply <br/>
having a bad week, the cleaning task slides and someone else <br/>
picks up the slack. For the ones who struggle, we pitch in and do <br/>
half (parents do this).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see chores as responsbility training ground. I see caring <br/>
relationships as the primary responsiblity of family members. If <br/>
there are coerced chores, caring isn&#39;t often on the map or radar <br/>
screen. Chores get top billing.<br/>
<br/>
But if we move chores into the category of more opportunities to <br/>
care for one another, then taking humans seriously becomes <br/>
more important than clean bathrooms or mowed lawns.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, we&#39;ve had a much more relaxed approach to <br/>
chores since January. We saw amazing amounts of growth in <br/>
the first few months (kids volunteering to set the table or hand <br/>
wash dishes or sweep when they had only ever done what was <br/>
required before). But recently, I&#39;ve noticed an even more <br/>
signifcant change: Consideration!<br/>
<br/>
My teens have become considerate people right before my very <br/>
eyes. They say the most amazing things: &quot;Mom, I know you&#39;re <br/>
tired and have driven me everywhere. Why don&#39;t yo go to bed and <br/>
I&#39;ll get those dishes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or: &quot;Mom, Dad&#39;s out of town. You have a lot going tomorrow. If <br/>
you want me to come and help you out, I will.&quot; (This formerly <br/>
oblivious daughter then came with me at 9 a.m. on her sleep-in <br/>
day to work in the snack shack at a soccer game for two hours <br/>
and to play with younger siblings while I worked. I remain <br/>
stunned.)<br/>
<br/>
Or: &quot;Can I make lunch? You always do it for everyone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or: &quot;I&#39;ll take the largest section for lawn mowing.&quot; (Why? comes <br/>
to mind... maybe to be nice! Yes I think so.)<br/>
<br/>
Point is: coercing chores makes it impossible for kids to offer <br/>
their acts of service as gifts of generosity. They are fulfilling <br/>
requirements, not loving family members.<br/>

YES! You put it so well. Since unschooling and coming to this list our family has done away with the &quot;family meeting&quot; we had every week where we did fun things like giving each other compliments and planning dates but also discussed problems and agreed on chores.  It has been such a relief to do away with the chore chart.  My boys do offer to help (at 6 and 3) and love to vacuum and mop (I detest mopping).  They don&#39;t always want to clean up after playing so I do it with or for them. They sometimes help when asked and sometimes don&#39;t.  I am becoming more and more O.K. with the times they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I remember thinking as a child, &quot;If only she (my mother) wouldn&#39;t ask me to do the dusting or dish washing (0r whatever it was) I would do it on my own.&quot; I told her this and she didn&#39;t believe me.  But I remember that feeling so well.  When we create something ourselves, (as opposed to being pushed or led into it) we don&#39;t destroy it.  This includes creatively serving one another and giving back to those we love. My 6 yr. old proudly made us lunch today, unasked. <br/>
<br/>
I have never been all that enthusiastic about house cleaning and I really believe it&#39;s because of my mother&#39;s expectations about it. My husband loves to clean (truly, he does  :)) and his experience growing up was this - he &quot;played&quot; at cleaning up every week with his siblings and the house cleaner. It was a game the kids initiated.  I now see that forcing the chores would be as wrong as forcing the curriculum.  I believe they learn responsibility through our modeling and through being in touch with their own inner compassion.  Of course, sometimes I wish they had more consistent access to that iner compassion cavity!  I just know that my chore charts(and rules) will create big road blocks in their journey there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459825240"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>would never dream of letting them shirk their responsibility to help in<br/>
household chores. I feel they must contribute to the family<br/>
<br/>
Hi Teresa - Do you assume that if parents do not make their children do<br/>
household chores the children never do any housework or contribute to the<br/>
family?  That hasn&#39;t proven true in our family.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never made our kids do housework.  Jon and I do not see housework as a<br/>
chore.  We do it cheerfully, in order to make our home a place we all enjoy.<br/>
Both kids have always helped out when and as they&#39;ve wanted to.  Dagny,<br/>
who&#39;s ten, has recently taken to noticing when something needs to be cleaned<br/>
up and doing it without comment.  She&#39;s also noticing that there are certain<br/>
things I put off doing, and has begun to do some of them herself.  Rowan is<br/>
six, and likes to join me or Jon with whatever we might be doing.  Both are<br/>
very thoughtful and appreciate what we do.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that responsibility comes from within.  Doing chores because you<br/>
are made to doesn&#39;t indicate responsibility to me, just compliance.  ~Rue<br/>

&gt; Laura T<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our house, nobody does a chore they don&#39;t choose to do.  We don&#39;t <br/>
force it on them, and believe me, it has made a difference in the <br/>
number of chores that get done.  <br/>
<br/>
There will be times when your child doesn&#39;t want to do their chores.  <br/>
So what?  There will be times when YOU don&#39;t want to do them either.  <br/>
<br/>
I used to think as you do.  But now I see that each person must <br/>
freely choose their responsibilities.  If you are making him do it, <br/>
then it isn&#39;t his responsibility, it&#39;s yours.  <br/>
<br/>
If one morning no one has clean underwear, then the person who needs <br/>
underwear should get up and wash their own.  If they want it bad <br/>
enough, they will do the work to get it.  If they have to wear one <br/>
pair two days in a row, that will help them remember to check their <br/>
underwear drawer at night before bed to make sure they have some <br/>
clean for the next day.  That will be a better teacher than you <br/>
running around making sure everybody did their chore.<br/>

Since the majority of us didn&#39;t grow up in unschooling environments, I think<br/>
it&#39;s only natural to wonder from time to time if this freedom and respect<br/>
will &quot;backfire.&quot; Obviously those wonderings and doubts become fewer as you<br/>
live a full unschooling life and truly trust and respect your children in<br/>
every way.<br/>

It makes me so sad when I see friends with children my own children&#39;s ages<br/>
already knee deep in power struggles and the us vs. them mentality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764126476">Chores and housework discussions always bring out the &quot;model the <br/>
behavior and you will see it from your kids&quot; in me. <br/>
<br/>
Our house is a &quot;light clutter&quot; type of thing, with a sparkling <br/>
kitchen. (GOTTA have a clean kitchen...my own little specialty, I <br/>
guess) However, clutter gets on my nerves. However, I used to ignore <br/>
it until it got awful, then holler at the kids to do it. Which they <br/>
would, amidst much grumbling and complaining. Main point: I wasn&#39;t <br/>
cleaning up, but telling the kids to.<br/>
<br/>
Then, FlyLady taught me to do these things as acts of service to my <br/>
family, and like Julie B, I started just doing the chores without <br/>
comment. After I started cheerfully serving my family by doing the <br/>
chores, I have come home more than once, to a clean and tidy house... <br/>
teenage daughter having done it, without me asking her to! Now that I <br/>
have taken on the chores without negativity, my kids go for it much <br/>
more readily. I ask &quot;would you please?&quot; and usually they do. If <br/>
not...I do it or I don&#39;t, but if I do, it is without harping on them. <br/>
My house stays &quot;presentable&quot; and can be sparkling clean, show-the-<br/>
house-to-prospective-buyers clean, in about a half hour.<br/>
<br/>
Daughter&#39;s best friend&#39;s mom is...disorganized, shall we say. Her <br/>
house is always a mess. I am NOT passing judgment here, just stating <br/>
facts. I&#39;ve seen her carpet look like the floor of a car, cereal and <br/>
milk spilled across a counter top and drying in place, etc. Really <br/>
messy. The friend gets asked to clean up, on a regular basis. <br/>
Sometimes, my daughter and her friend can&#39;t get together because <br/>
friend&#39;s room is a mess and must be clean before she can go out. When <br/>
friend is asked to clean up, she doesn&#39;t do it. plain and simple. <br/>
<br/>
IMO, she doesn&#39;t do it, because cleaning is never modeled to her. Her <br/>
mom doesn&#39;t clean up, and neither does she, and neither do any of <br/>
them. A very good friend of mine used to grouse about her husband and <br/>
boys never helping her around the house. When the youngest was grown, <br/>
she divorced her husband and moved into her own place. It looks the <br/>
same as her house did, when all those non-helpful men were around. <br/>
IOW, she doesn&#39;t keep up with the housework, and it shouldn&#39;t <br/>
surprise her if her family didn&#39;t...she never modeled it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids help without having a chore chart, usually I need to ask <br/>
them; sometimes they take the initiative. Didn&#39;t used to, but with <br/>
mom modelling the cleaning, they are much more willing. :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m new to unschooling & hadn&#39;t considered the &quot;chore&quot; aspect yet.  In our home, it has just seemed to make sense to have designated duties -- for example, my daughter is in charge of doing dishes, I do laundry, hubby mows the lawn, etc.  Sometimes we help each other, but in general we know who is responsible for most household duties.<br/>
<br/>
I thought of that as a way of being more organized -- to avoid having the laundry pile up until one morning no one has clean underwear, or we have no dishes for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about this type of arrangement as long as the child has input into choosing his/her responsibilities?  Because there will certainly be times when the child does not want to do their &quot;job&quot;, and I would expect them to do it anyway (although sometimes I may help).  I&#39;ve just never felt that I should do it &quot;for&quot; them, as it relieves the child of actually having responsibility for that area.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nah, I don&#39;t think scheduled chores will help much, esp if he&#39;s so hit or <br/>
miss.  That would add stress, dontcha think?  And, he&#39;s only 5!  <br/>
<br/>
I would just continue to ask him to do little things I would add asking him <br/>
to put his shoes away, and other little stuff that *he&#39;s* left out.  If you get <br/>
a lot of no&#39;s on his own stuff, I would talk out loud about it as you clean <br/>
it up, asking him questions about where he would like it, etc.  It&#39;ll give him <br/>
an awareness of how much mess he made without being shamed or pressured.  I <br/>
would ask if he needs help putting something bigger or messier away, kinda <br/>
hinting that it needs to be done, but not make a big deal if he wants to leave it <br/>
out for a while, or if he&#39;s busy.  Well, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done, anyway, so <br/>
that&#39;s my two cents. lol  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not chore people here.  I&#39;m a reformed slob, so I&#39;ve gotten pretty <br/>
regimented as I clean and organize.  We bought a new place last year, and we moved <br/>
from a grimey basement apt to a beautiful new condo, so I got very motivated <br/>
to schedule ( or at least pay attention to how often things got done) my <br/>
housework.  But if I don&#39;t wash the floor on tuesday, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Maybe <br/>
tuesday was a crappy day, or I was tired or busy, or we were out.  If I have that <br/>
kind of flexibility, why should I be rigid about a chore schedule for my son? <br/>
  I&#39;ve read about charts and stars, etc, and that kind of thing just makes my <br/>
skin crawl! lol  <br/>
<br/>
But it also means that a lot of times I want to vacuum and I find a pile of <br/>
toys on the floor, or I want to dust and there&#39;s a project on the table, and if <br/>
I ask my 9 yo if he&#39;s done for now, or if he could put that away so I can <br/>
clean, he almost always does that, or plays with it somewhere else.  It involves <br/>
him somewhat but the line is his own stuff, he knows what he needs to do, but <br/>
that I&#39;ll do it if he&#39;s busy.  <br/>
<br/>
He does help out an awful lot, if I ask him, and more and more, even when I <br/>
don&#39;t. If the sink is empty, he&#39;s likely to wash his plate or bowl, because he <br/>
knows I like an empty sink.  If there&#39;s a bag of garbage, he&#39;ll often take it <br/>
out, and put a new bag in.  He always helps with the laundry, as it&#39;s three <br/>
floors down, bringing loads up and down.  He loves dusting, altho he&#39;s not very <br/>
thorough. ;-)  Sometimes he negotiates pay for certain jobs, now.  He often <br/>
gets a quarter for helping with the laundry, a quarter for washing a sink full <br/>
of glasses ( altho the hubby says he&#39;s not too good at reaching the bottom of <br/>
the glass!  EW), etc.  <br/>
<br/>
But this happened from me just asking him to put his own stuff away, and <br/>
helping him to organize a little.  He sees me doing certain jobs often, and just <br/>
started helping me with them on his own.  As he got older, he started <br/>
contributing more and more.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week, when hubby and I weren&#39;t feeling well and we were hanging out in <br/>
bed, he finished dinner, swept the kitchen floor and cleaned the glass coffee <br/>
table, and he said it was because he wanted me to rest.  I also knew that it <br/>
was because he wanted to &quot;take care.&quot;  It was generous of him, and very sweet.  <br/>
And totally unnecessary!  lol  Except for the dinner part, that was awesome.  <br/>
He baked the biscuits and chopped and added the veggies for the stew I had <br/>
started earlier.  I thought it was cute when he told me how much work he thought <br/>
it was!  <br/>
<br/>
I think that when parents and kids share life in the house, that they <br/>
naturally start sharing the work as well.  It&#39;s just that when kids are young, <br/>
they&#39;re too busy playing, and I think that&#39;s the way it should be.  Asking, <br/>
suggesting, and talking about cleaning up, tho, makes the child aware that it is not <br/>
magick that puts the legos away, or puts the clothes in the drawer clean and <br/>
folded.  ;-)  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;laziness&quot; altho sometimes it sure seems like <br/>
it is, I know!  <br/>
<br/>
Now, his room is another story. His life is too busy, it&#39;s one thing and then <br/>
another, so I try to understand that&#39;s why the mess develops. ( And I don&#39;t <br/>
hang out in there much, so....I don&#39;t see it and don&#39;t care!)  He&#39;s just not in <br/>
the habit of putting away.  I&#39;m not going to force him to develop those <br/>
habits, even tho I think they are good ones to have.  He&#39;ll learn that or not, on <br/>
his own.  It&#39;s not laziness, tho, I don&#39;t (CAN&#39;T) think of it that way, or I <br/>
get resentful and he doesn&#39;t need that!  I help him straighten up a little very <br/>
few days, and he&#39;s grateful, but it&#39;s his space so it&#39;s up to him how it looks <br/>
and where he puts stuff.  It works out well that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helped a little, didn&#39;t mean to let this get so long, but I <br/>
wanted to share my story about how things developed as my son got older, because he <br/>
was a lot like you describe your 5 yo when he was that age.  It gets better, <br/>
not worse, as they get older.  I wouldn&#39;t worry.  <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
more readily. I ask &quot;would you please?&quot; and usually they do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A good story happened last night, but needs a buildup (sorry).<br/>
Holly and I had eaten out with another female friend late afternoon.  Holly <br/>
had macaroni and cheese.<br/>
Keith had picked Kirby up from karate to take him straight to work, and Keith <br/>
ate leftovers.<br/>
Marty had been out with homeschooled teens&#39; group at a movie and had eaten <br/>
something somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Time passed.<br/>
<br/>
Holly came in my office, I was on the phone, and signalled her to wait a <br/>
minute. <br/>
Then Kirby beeped in and wanted a ride home from work.<br/>
<br/>
I was leaving, telling Holly, &quot;I&#39;ll be back in an hour.  Kirby needs to drive <br/>
an hour in the dark.&quot;    She said she had been trying to ask me to fix her <br/>
some protein food because she had a terrible headache.  She wanted beans and <br/>
cheese on a tortilla.  &quot;But I can get it myself,&quot; she said really sadly, and I <br/>
zoomed away, but felt guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby works less than a mile from the house.  I asked him to call Holly and <br/>
tell her we&#39;d be right back to make her food.  He said he wanted some too <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was sweetly thrilled when we got there, and Marty came out to see what <br/>
all the bustle was.<br/>
<br/>
The four of us all pitched in to do these grated cheese/bean/dip in sour <br/>
cream things for Holly and Kirby.  Everybody was doing something, and the kitchen <br/>
was crowded, but we weren&#39;t bumping and grumpy.  I asked HOlly if she could <br/>
put the silverware away because the dishwasher is right by that drawer and <br/>
nobody was in that corner.  &quot;Sure!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She got her food and took it in her room, and I asked Marty to see if she had <br/>
gotten milk.   &quot;Sure!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She came out and said &quot;I knew I forgot something!&quot;<br/>
Marty offered to get it for her, so she fed the dog while he was doing that.<br/>
<br/>
If we had lots of chores and rules, I think (from experiences when I was <br/>
little, and other families I&#39;ve known) there would have been a lot of &quot;It&#39;s not my <br/>
turn&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s her milk&quot; and &quot;It&#39;s Marty&#39;s dog,&quot; but there was not one <br/>

Then Kirby and I went out so he could drive in the dark for an hour, which <br/>
completes his supervised practice chart, and he gets his license next week.<br/>
<br/>
If we hadn&#39;t gone back home, Holly would have felt abandoned (and the food <br/>
didn&#39;t make her headache go away, so she probably would have cried, too), Kirby <br/>
would&#39;ve been driving hungry, and I would have felt guilty about leaving Holly <br/>
with her sad headachy face.<br/>

This was great.  I did not agree with the true *chores* thing but <br/>
was not sure if we were doing the right thing by not requiring <br/>
something.    You  have given me a new perspective on that.  You are <br/>
right, he is just too busy playing and maybe when he is older it <br/>
will be different. <br/>
<br/>
Luckily, we just moved and have a playroom downstairs and I could <br/>
care less about it&#39;s appearance.  In the other house, when the boys <br/>
room was messy it drove me crazy because they had to sleep in it so <br/>
this is much less stress :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that I&#39;ll do it if he&#39;s busy.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He does help out an awful lot, if I ask him, and more and more, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>even when I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; don&#39;t. If the sink is empty, he&#39;s likely to wash his plate or <br/>
 </span></blockquote>bowl, because he <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; knows I like an empty sink.  If there&#39;s a bag of garbage, he&#39;ll <br/>
 </span></blockquote>often take it <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out, and put a new bag in.  He always helps with the laundry, as <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it&#39;s three <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; floors down, bringing loads up and down.  He loves dusting, altho <br/>
 </span></blockquote>he&#39;s not very <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thorough. ;-)  Sometimes he negotiates pay for certain jobs, now.  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>He often <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of glasses ( altho the hubby says he&#39;s not too good at reaching <br/>

&gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; helping him to organize a little.  He sees me doing certain jobs <br/>
