&gt; with him in private. Often he will understand and change his mind. He has a<br/>
&gt; certain wisdom on some things I do not. I rely and trust in him. He has<br/>
&gt; never laid a violent hand upon me. My &quot;obedience&quot; comes out of love and<br/>
&gt; respect for my husband, not fear and intimidation. I believe that is more<br/>

public? If it&#39;s mutual, while it&#39;s not necessarily the model I would choose <br/>
for a relationship, I certainly understand. If not--why not?<br/>

Kathryn, who wonders why she feels compelled to speak here<br/>
