Nonsense. If the NEA wanted to support homeschooling, it would find hundreds<br/>
of ways, but IT WANTS TO ELIMINATE HOMESCHOOLING instead, so it works night<br/>
and day to do that. This is not a conspiracy theory...go to the speeches<br/>
that they give to each other at their conventions. Look at how principals<br/>
and their clerks and minions treat parents who ask them about how to<br/>
homeschool their kids.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, may we hear further about how Sandra would suggest schools change their<br/>
method of funding?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575135931">which is why we don&#39;t need the nea... maybe use all that money on teacher&#39;s salaries.. my theory has always beeen that if teachers were paid at least say.. 50 to 80 K .. the profession would gain prestige, more people would want to do it, teachers would get better, schools would get better.. and maybe my kids could even get something out of it.. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The theory that schools hate homeschooling because we cost them money could <br/>
be undone if the taxes collected for schools were distributed some other way. <br/>
 There are lots of other ways.  If all the homeschooled kids in our little <br/>
area here and all the privately schooled kids were all in public school, that <br/>
would be some amount of money.  If they calculated that and gave it to the <br/>
school regardless of who was enrolled, just by local kid-population, then my <br/>
having my kids out would lower the teacher/student ratio, allow those kids <br/>
more attention and less crowdedness.  That wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings one bit. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you say &quot;nonsense&quot; or start a libertarian rant, it won&#39;t help or change my <br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t keep my children home to hurt the schools.  I&#39;m very sorry that the <br/>
classes remain at 28 and 30 kids instead of being smaller classes as more kid<br/>
s stay home or go to private school.<br/>
