&gt;   I was talking to a woman at a party once, and when I responded to one of <br/>
&gt; her questions that I was not Christian, she was speechless.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve lived all my life within the DC beltway (not always litterally but right <br/>
there) DC has one of the largest US population areas of Jews (which I am) <br/>
There are delis and bagel stores, there are Day schools, synagogues, The Jewish <br/>
Community Center, Jewish names on buildings, Jewish bookstores, and whatever <br/>
you may need. I grew up with an assumption that everyone was Jewish! LOL<br/>
This winter I moved to small town, PA. <br/>
Nobody is Jewish. Nobody is Buddhist. Nobody is Pagan. Everyone is Mennonite.<br/>
Now I get the speechless response.<br/>
Makes me speechless.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I grew up in Roundup, Montana, population 2,800.  I grew up Catholic, the<br/>
Episcopalian church was across the street frm the Catholic church and<br/>
kitty-corner there was another church, but I didn&#39;t know the name.  There<br/>
were and are lots of Catholics in Roundup.<br/>
<br/>
My cousins were not catholic, the were Methodists and belonged to the<br/>
Rainbow Girls.  Back in the early 60&#39;s Catholic girls weren&#39;t allowed to be<br/>
in the Rainbow Girls. It had something to do with beliefs in interpretations<br/>
of scripture, I think.<br/>
<br/>
In school there was one boy in our class that never said the pledge of<br/>
allegience to the flag, he was a Jehovah Witness.  And even though I didn&#39;t<br/>
know this as a young girl, there was one Jewish family in town.<br/>
<br/>
Religious differences onlly showed up at family dinners during christmas,<br/>
etc...<br/>
