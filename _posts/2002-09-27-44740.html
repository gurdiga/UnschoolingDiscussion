<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830668448">Me, Devin (8) and Madelaine(5) just watched (well last night and <br/>
again this morning) Mark Twain&#39;s Roughing It.  It was really good.  <br/>
The kids enjoyed it and Devin was particularly amazed because of <br/>
Samuel Clemmons becoming a writer...as that is what he wants to be.  <br/>
Despite his great difficulty in writing a simple sentence, getting <br/>
the thoughts from mind to paper or even mind to mouth and his <br/>
reluctance to read he wants to be a writer!  I think it is <br/>
absolutely wonderful.  He puts his khaki hiking vest on, puts a pen <br/>
or pencil in the pocket (leaves sticking out to be sure it is <br/>
visible), sports his camoflauge hat with daddy sewn patches on it <br/>
and last but not least a notebook under one arm.  He sometimes <br/>
writes in the car and in his bed, sometimes not at all for days.  <br/>
But he is a writer at heart and I imagine with the support, one day <br/>
it will spread elsewhere.  Check out the movie if you haven&#39;t seen <br/>
it.<br/>
