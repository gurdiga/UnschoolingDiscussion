<div id="ygrps-yiv-824101573">Speaking of music,<br/>
<br/>
has anyone heard the music that comes from the cars in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My son was jammin&#39; to the tunes,  all from my jr high and high school years!  He really liked 99 Red Balloons,  remember that German version?       <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651983506">I remember!  I love the music from that game too!  I really wanted to get it <br/>
but after seeing it, I decided the mature rating was well deserved.  *I* <br/>
don&#39;t even feel &#39;mature&#39; enough to play that game! LOL  Great music <br/>
though...love it!<br/>
