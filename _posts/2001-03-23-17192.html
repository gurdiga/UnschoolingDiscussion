<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514927068">Hi Kim.. that&#39;s quite ok..I did think about you this past Sunday when my<br/>
girls and I went to a cousin&#39;s birthday party in St Louis, (Baldwin<br/>
actually) I probably was pretty close to where you live. Maybe our families<br/>
could meet at the Science Center, Zoo or Art Museum sometime this summer..<br/>
that would be fun. Oh, there&#39;s also a very neat-hands on Aquarium too!<br/>
We are moving in 3 more weeks, to a mini-homestead, so that should keep us<br/>
busy for awhile. Planting the garden, finding some goat babies and seeing<br/>
what&#39;s in and around the pond!<br/>

&gt;I am in Southern Jefferson County, Missouri.  Where<br/>
&gt;are you located maybe we could get together for a<br/>
&gt;field trip or something. If we are even remotely close<br/>
&gt;geographically. I just pulled my kids out of public<br/>
&gt;school in January so we are very new to all of this.<br/>
&gt;Most of the time we just &quot;wing it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Julie, We have already been over that haven&#39;t we.  I<br/>
&gt;am sorry it is late and I knew I should have went to<br/>
&gt;bed instead of checking e-mail.  That just backs it up<br/>
&gt;for me.  Good night!   I will be OK in the morning!<br/>
&gt;LOL </span></blockquote></div>

for you! :-)<br/>
