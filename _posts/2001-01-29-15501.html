<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144396937">Hi, I apologize for answering the post that was about raising dogs. It does <br/>
not have a thing to do with unschooling. The only reason I mentioned raising <br/>
dogs to start with is because it is what my kids are interested in and the <br/>
dog&#39;s care has a big impact on our day. I could have used bmx racing and my <br/>
kids devotion to that, guess I did not think that the dog raising would raise <br/>
a problem. It was not the point of my post. I did not wish to start a <br/>
discussion on the welfare of animals or on my family.<br/>
<br/>
Back to unschooling ...<br/>
peace and grace<br/>
