<div id="ygrps-yiv-1033422964">You are cordially invited to join a new unschooling discussion list.  <br/>
Why another group?  This list is intended to complement existing <br/>
groups.  Open to both kids and adults, it is a place for us to <br/>
discuss the process of unschooling ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
List description:<br/>
You don&#39;t have to be a kid or have kids in order to be an unschooler. <br/>
There are many wonderful groups that already provide a forum for <br/>
parents or young people interested in unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
In order to bring everyone together, Unschooling Ourselves is broader <br/>
in scope--a home for people of any age who are interested in <br/>
exploring how we have been limited by a society that believes in <br/>
compulsory schooling, and how we have learned to transcend those <br/>
limits in our day-to-day lives. <br/>
<br/>
How has the concept of unschooling changed your life? From the <br/>
mundane to the extraordinary, all topics are open for discussion and <br/>
debate.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you can join us!  To join, please visit <br/>
