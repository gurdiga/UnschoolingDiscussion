Tamzin is back from visiting her dad in the UK and I&#39;m back from <br/>
my mom&#39;s. It&#39;s nice to be back online and &#39;hearing&#39; all your <br/>
familiar voices. <br/>

I wont get to go home to England until the Winter :-( cos the airlines raise<br/>
the fares so much in the summer. Kids were all in tears when I told them.<br/>

It&#39;s so crap the way the airlines do that. Also the &quot;summer <br/>
season&quot; seems to get longer and longer every few years. Last I <br/>
heard, it&#39;s now from 2 weeks before Easter to the beginning of <br/>
October. Sheesh!<br/>
Tamzin had a nice time, but unfortunately she didn&#39;t get to see <br/>
her best friend over there. Her dad has decided that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
need to maintain that friendship! I think it&#39;s because he feels <br/>
uncomfortable with her mom. Tamzin and I are not happy about <br/>
the situation and we have decided that I am going to be picking <br/>
her up from the UK from now on and we&#39;ll just stay an extra few <br/>
days and go and visit them. <br/>
