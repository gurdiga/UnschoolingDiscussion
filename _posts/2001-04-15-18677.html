<br>And very well, I thought. &nbsp;The day you need my help, Sandra, in voicing an 
<br>opinion &nbsp;. . . 
<br>
<br>Anyway, my children are young (6 and almost-8) but I do find that &quot;science&quot; 
<br>is an interesting area with them. &nbsp;One of the reasons is that it is so 
<br>complex and changing.
<br>
<br>The other day we received an email (from this list -- I don&#39;t know??) dealing 
<br>with new planets that had been discovered. &nbsp;Now, that&#39;s a pretty awesome 
<br>thing to me -- the kiddos were not that amazed -- I think they are being 
<br>raised in a time when amazing things happen every day. &nbsp;Or maybe we just hear 
<br>about them more quickly.
<br>
<br>I deliberately try to present things in a kind of muddle -- because I think 
<br>that&#39;s how things are. &nbsp;Not distinct topics but many events hooked together 
<br>and overlapping and influencing our understanding of the next event. &nbsp;Or 
<br>maybe it&#39;s that I wouldn&#39;t know how to present anything not in a muddle -- 
<br>thing don&#39;t happen singularly -- people don&#39;t act for one clear reason -- 
<br>changes happen slowly and not in a straight line.
<br>
<br>So when we talk about anything we try to see how it fits in -- how people 
<br>might have lived and survived or not -- not just the fact (or what we think 
<br>is a fact so far removed) and also how they might have thought they knew what 
<br>was going on (the earth is flat, etc.) and then someone figured out a little 
<br>part of it and then thinking changed. &nbsp;And how there might be a scientist&#39;s 
<br>or explorer&#39;s or inventor&#39;s knowledge of X, but that normal everday life 
<br>might still operate on the old ideas. &nbsp;How long it takes knowledge to spread. 
<br>&nbsp;Etc.
<br>
<br>So, science is cool around here, I think, because we are starting to discover 
<br>how little people know. &nbsp;Now or then. &nbsp;How long it takes us to figure out 
<br>what later seems like such an obvious thing and then is later repaced with 
<br>something a little closer to the truth but by now you&#39;d think we&#39;d know 
<br>better than to think we actually know anything!
