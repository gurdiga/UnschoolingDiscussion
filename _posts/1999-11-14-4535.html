<div id="ygrps-yiv-108465071">A poem by the great English poet and dramatist James Shirley (1596-1666).<br/>
The 17th century was a particularly bloody one in Europe.  The English Civil<br/>
Wars took place between 1642 and 1651.  In Central Europe, the Thirty Years<br/>
War took place from 1618-1648.  Surely the poets and playwrights of that era<br/>
pondered deeply the questions of existence, the transitory nature of wealth,<br/>
and power, of life itself.  The following poem touches on those themes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Death the Leveller<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE glories of our blood and state<br/>
  Are shadows, not substantial things;<br/>
There is no armour against Fate;<br/>
  Death lays his icy hand on kings:<br/>
        Sceptre and Crown    5<br/>
        Must tumble down,<br/>
  And in the dust be equal made<br/>
With the poor crookï¿½d scythe and spade.<br/>
<br/>
Some men with swords may reap the field,<br/>
  And plant fresh laurels where they kill:   10<br/>
But their strong nerves at last must yield;<br/>
  They tame but one another still:<br/>
        Early or late<br/>
        They stoop to fate,<br/>
And must give up their murmuring breath   15<br/>
When they, pale captives, creep to death.<br/>
<br/>
The garlands wither on your brow,<br/>
  Then boast no more your mighty deeds!<br/>
Upon Death&#39;s purple altar now<br/>
  See where the victor-victim bleeds.   20<br/>
        Your heads must come<br/>
        To the cold tomb:<br/>
Only the actions of the just<br/>
Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
