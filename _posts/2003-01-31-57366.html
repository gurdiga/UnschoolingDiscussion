being &quot;clean.&quot;).  Any meat really.<br/>

pop them in the mocrowave.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Will he eat red beet eggs? My girls love them, so I just make a dozen and<br/>
keep them in the fridge. And as far as the chicken, what I do is slice up<br/>
boneless/skinless breast, I mean, oops, white meat&lt;g&gt; and marinate it in<br/>
Italian dressing. Just cook it and throw it in the fridge. My girls will<br/>
nibble on it, or it is there and ready to toss into a chef salad or<br/>
whatever. Just some thoughts!<br/>
