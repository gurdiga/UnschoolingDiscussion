&lt;&lt;  But I&#39;m not going to try to force you to give up beef and buy only<br/>
 organic and get rid of your teflon and plastics and all the formaldehyde<br/>
 ladened things (clothes, sheets, mattresses, etc.) in your home because I<br/>
 think they are also causing harm to your children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>     This is OT but do you have a reasonable source for organic or minimally <br/>
processed materials. I am looking for a matress pad for dd&#39;s very <br/>
uncomfortable bed. <br/>
<br/>
   TIA  NICKI~ who does eat 98% organically and trys her best to live <br/>
chemically free.</div>
