<div id="ygrps-yiv-128761865">&quot;A friend of mine just made a big tent.  Big.  Like 18&#39; tall in the <br/>
center, 7&#39; <br/>
side poles, 22 feet long or so.  Big.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow! I can&#39;t believe you posted this Sandra. I just spent yesterday <br/>
trying to figure out a single pole construction medieval tent. I <br/>
found pretty good instructions online for the straight walled <br/>
style....I can do all the wood construction myself, but sewing 54 <br/>
yards of heavy duty canvas totally overwhelmed me.<br/>
I was going to do a hub that fits over the center pole and has spokes <br/>
going out to the sidewalls, hence no need for side poles. Very cool <br/>
and very period.<br/>
I&#39;m still pondering whether to attempt something like this, or just <br/>
buy one of those pop up patio things and attach my own canvas to make <br/>
it sturdier and more period looking.<br/>
I&#39;m also trying to come up with a plan for my hawks mews/weathering <br/>
area which takes priority over a tent right now.....but both require <br/>
math that I don&#39;t have in my brain right now. Time to learn.<br/>
:) As Mary says, Life IS good!<br/>
<br/>
I still can&#39;t post much because I have to log onto the site first, <br/>
CompuServe is still having problems fixing AOL&#39;s screwup on my <br/>
account, I really miss posting here!! Soon I hope...<br/>

My friend Mike makes boots, so he has a couple of industrial sewing things.  <br/>
Not &quot;sewing maching&quot; as seamstresses think of them.  Sewing industrial <br/>
machinery. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The tents I made were trigger cloth and lighter.  (Did you know &quot;Trigger&quot; is <br/>
short for &quot;Outrigger&quot;?  They had to cut off part of it to fit it in the <br/>
alloted space, and so the first two letters fell out and they left it <br/>
&quot;trigger.&quot;)  I did felled seams.<br/>
<br/>
Being NOT in the tornado/hurricane zone, I just use internal ropes, so that <br/>
the cloth is over the four corner ropes, and that becomes the angle.  I <br/>
fasten the ropes into the hanging frame with a separate rope loop.  The <br/>
frames were put together with wingnuts/bolts.  So basically it&#39;s a center <br/>
pole with a cross-piece or small ring holding the ropes which fasten to the <br/>
frame and then to stakes, with cloth around the outside.  But they&#39;re not <br/>
giant.  They&#39;re arming tents, storage tents, big enough for one single person <br/>
or maybe two to sleep.<br/>
