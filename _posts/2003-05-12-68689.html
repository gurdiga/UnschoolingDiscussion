&lt;&lt; I called the teacher who has <br/>
all the paperwork and told her to just send my stuff back, i would figure <br/>
something out, but she wasn&#39;t there and i haven&#39;t heard back.  All this stuff <br/>
needs to be turned in by July 1, and i just dunno what to do.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

First, what&#39;s the penalty in Florida for failing to file this report?<br/>
Who do you think will notice if it&#39;s late?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t freak.  It&#39;s not mid-may.  A month and a half is a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Ren who is often the busiest Florida-contributor here has her computer down <br/>
this week, but she&#39;ll be back and will have ideas for you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you Sandra....i actually don&#39;t know what the penalty is....maybe i just <br/>
won&#39;t file it and see what happens....&lt;Yes, i am feeling particularly <br/>
defiant!&gt;  I wonder how i could nonchalantly find out......<br/>
<br/>
I am already feeling much better....i am SO grateful to have found this <br/>
list....i honestly was starting to believe i was the only one in my vicinity <br/>
that embraced this kind of learning....thanks again....<br/>
