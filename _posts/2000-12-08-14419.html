<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488304336">I guess I question why time has to be a factor in<br/>
learning something from reading or whatever? We all<br/>
learn how we learn in our own time.<br/>
<br/>
The value of stories are fun. (anyone have a good<br/>
suggestion for an inspiring book?) It is also to learn<br/>
about things.  I much more enjoy reading historical<br/>
fiction then maybe pick up some non fiction of the<br/>
same period then the drier non fiction can come more<br/>
to life in my mind when I remember the fiction book I<br/>
have read earlier.  I could skip the fiction book and<br/>
go right to the non fiction history book but that<br/>
would be boring. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256414759">I mostly read non-fiction, and have read as much non-fiction as fiction even <br/>
as a kid (and now read much more of it).  I have a very large library, little <br/>
of which is fiction.<br/>
<br/>
My husband reads fantasy and sci-fi and historical fantasy (what-if books).  <br/>
<br/>
My favorites are old Kurt Vonnegut and fairy tales.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy fiction in movies (and just saw &quot;Unbreakable&quot; which was not only a <br/>
cool story with deep connections to all stories in a Jungian kind of way [and <br/>
more], but had knock-out cinematography).   Fiction provides characters who <br/>
are often representative of archetypes which connect to all history and the <br/>
human psyche, and lets them play through various situations.  We judge their <br/>
decisions and actions as the play/tale unfolds, and in so doing we run our <br/>
own judgements through their paces.  We experience emotions, the desire to <br/>
warn people about danger we can see that they can&#39;t, we ride the swell of <br/>
extreme loyalty, courage or noble sacrifice.  It can be like a mental roller <br/>
coaster, letting extreme emotions which don&#39;t normally come up in everyday <br/>
life have a little biochemical run through our minds and bloodstreams while <br/>
we&#39;re still safe at home.  We can try out our reactions to situations we&#39;d <br/>
just as soon NEVER actually happened to us in real life.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more to fiction, but that&#39;s enough for me for now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944386586">Though many valuable things come to me from reading stories - information,<br/>
language, insight into other people&#39;s lives, cultures, geography, etc. one<br/>
of the things that I love best is just the beauty of language itself. Like<br/>
looking at a wonderful painting, or listening to a fine symphony, it opens<br/>
up vistas that were previously hidden. A good author can paint a scene in my<br/>
head of a place I&#39;ve never been before. I can fall in love with the city of<br/>
Charleston reading Pat Conroy, or long to see the moors of Wuthering<br/>
Heights. Language can paint an emotion on your heart and enable you to see<br/>
the world in an entirely different way. In &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot;, Barbara<br/>
Kingsolver talks about how the women in this particular village in Africa<br/>
all gather together at the funeral of a child and crawl towards the coffin,<br/>
eating the dirt along the way. How can an image like that not affect a<br/>
person? There are many books I have loved just for the joy of escaping into<br/>
their stories, but the books that I treasure are the ones where I have to<br/>
stop frequently and re-read a sentence multiple times just for the sheer<br/>
beauty of the phrasing.<br/>
<br/>
And on this subject, my mom and I were talking one day. She always reads<br/>
non-fiction, I usually read fiction with about 20% non-fiction thrown in.<br/>
When I read fiction, I &quot;see&quot; the story unfolding in my mind, I am unaware of<br/>
the words on the page unless a particular turn of phrase calls out to me.<br/>
Mostly it just washes through me with my imagination providing the images.<br/>
My mom says that doesn&#39;t happen for her when she reads fiction, she&#39;s just<br/>
seeing words on a page and hearing them in her head. The words don&#39;t<br/>
disappear for her the way they do for me. I found this really intriguing,<br/>
and I don&#39;t know if it is because she almost always reads non-fiction,<br/>
whereas I almost always read fiction, or if our reading preferences were<br/>
influenced by the differing ways that we experience the printed word. I know<br/>
it&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t like non-fiction as well, because it just seems like<br/>
a bunch of words - it doesn&#39;t take my mind away like fiction does.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; And on this subject, my mom and I were talking one day. She always reads<br/>
&gt; non-fiction, I usually read fiction with about 20% non-fiction thrown in.<br/>
&gt; When I read fiction, I &quot;see&quot; the story unfolding in my mind, I am unaware<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the words on the page unless a particular turn of phrase calls out to me.<br/>
&gt; Mostly it just washes through me with my imagination providing the images.<br/>
&gt; My mom says that doesn&#39;t happen for her when she reads fiction, she&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; seeing words on a page and hearing them in her head. The words don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; disappear for her the way they do for me. I found this really intriguing,<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t know if it is because she almost always reads non-fiction,<br/>
&gt; whereas I almost always read fiction, or if our reading preferences were<br/>
&gt; influenced by the differing ways that we experience the printed word. I<br/>
know<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t like non-fiction as well, because it just seems<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; a bunch of words - it doesn&#39;t take my mind away like fiction does.<br/>
<br/>
This is intriguing.  I&#39;ve been reading about Meyers-Briggs personality<br/>
types, in a career book called _Do What You Are_.  I would think that from<br/>
what you describe, your mother is more of an &quot;S&quot; in the Sensation-Intuition<br/>
category, and you are more of an &quot;N&quot;, Intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
I think my husband and I are both Intuitive in our processing of<br/>
information.  When we talk it&#39;s really fun, because he comprehends my wacky<br/>
ideas, even if I do a lot of hand waving and have trouble finding the right<br/>
word.  Boy, it&#39;s bliss to be understood!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Sensation people really focus on the real, and process information<br/>
well about things that they can see, hear and feel.  Intutition people are<br/>
more likely to be able to imagine things unseen.<br/>

This stuff is fascinating and very useful. The book I&#39;m working with is <br/>
called &quot;Gifts Differing.&quot; I was introduced to the Meyers-Briggs philosophy at <br/>
a homeschooling workshop around 10 years ago. It has really helped me <br/>
understand the individual personalities in my family as well as the <br/>
relationships between them.<br/>

Oh geez I&#39;ve been reading too many posts at once. I thought that said<br/>
&quot;heathen flowers&quot; and I sat here wondering what heathen flowers would look<br/>
like. Okay, off the computer now...<br/>
