<div id="ygrps-yiv-177272428">My DH and I had to have a mini exam this am at our house for insurance. When <br/>
it was my turn I was talking to the lady as she was drawing blood, she asked <br/>
me the ages of my kids and where my youngest went to school. I told her we hs&#39;d <br/>
and she launched into several paragraphs about how organized I must be and <br/>
how much time it takes and how well a friend of hers did while hsing her dd. How <br/>
the lady worked hard to keep up with the required outline and to meet the <br/>
testing requirements and so on. Also how when the DD went back to school she was <br/>
very far ahead of her grade level. I got the impression that she believed that <br/>
going back into the system is what is always in a hsing parents mind so <br/>
therefore we are always keeping our eye on &quot;what&#39;s required&quot; so we can stay in <br/>
step. <br/>
<br/>
Whew! I just sat there a minute and thought about it all. I then asked her if <br/>
this friend lived in Ohio and she said yes. I told her that Ohio regulations <br/>
which have been in place since 1989 do not require any testing, it is an <br/>
option and that we are not required to use any &quot;approved&quot; Curriculum. I also <br/>
explained that we don&#39;t use the school model in our home, we learn differently. (a <br/>
little more more or less but this was the gist) She didn&#39;t really say much more <br/>
and I was glad we were about finished. Sometimes when I am talking to people <br/>
like that I feel like we are speaking in different languages and we each know <br/>
just a little of each others language, just enough to communicate but not <br/>
well. I would have loved to share how wonderful learning and life can be. <br/>
(Actually I have to say I do know that language, I do know the school model that may <br/>
be why it is even harder to bridge that span, I know how long it took me and I <br/>
wanted to do it. I knew that it wasn&#39;t going to happen in a 15minute <br/>
conversation)<br/>
<br/>
I did tell her that I don&#39;t feel that what I do is a lot of work because I <br/>
love it, I love my kids and I love to learn so it all fits right together. Maybe <br/>
she will think a little. I have thought of more but I will write about it in <br/>
another post since it is a different subject and this is too long now.<br/>
