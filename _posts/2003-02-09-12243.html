<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think of Alice as a brat at all! In the beginning she&#39;s bored <br/>
and not interested in the book her sister is read --   &quot;what is the use <br/>
of a book without pictures or conversations!&quot; I distinctly remember <br/>
having those feeling when I &quot;graduated&quot; from illustrated books to books <br/>
with just text.<br/>
<br/>
Alice falls asleep and dreams her adventures, so we don&#39;t really know <br/>
just what the real-life Alice is like. The Alice-of-the-dream, though, <br/>
is adventurous and although she usually remains pretty polite, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t completely bow down to the &quot;adults&quot; around her, strange as they <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think most kids are developed enough to be evil, if there is <br/>
such a thing as evil-ness. They act from what they know and &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
behavior is usually in response to bad circumstances in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
So, you&#39;ll have to write your own bitchy Alice-the-kid play -- I&#39;ll <br/>
grow her up and let her sleep with the caterpillar or the rabbit!<br/>

<br/>
Oh, not the caterpillar.  Gross!  Inter-species is bad enough.  <br/>
Caterpillars don&#39;t have sex anyway, do they?  The moths or butterflies do.<br/>
<br/>
My husband loves the interplanetary sex scenes in science fiction novels.  <br/>
He&#39;ll read your book, I&#39;m sure!   (Or was it going to be a play? &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even think the mother-in-law Alice is evil.  A grandparent&#39;s <br/>
relationship with a grandchild is real.  We override them lots and sometimes <br/>
make it difficult for them to even see each other, but they still do have a <br/>
right to an opinion.   <br/>
<br/>
I never hear myself complaining about my husband&#39;s mean mother or my drunken <br/>
confused mother without considering what kind of grandmother I might end up <br/>
being myself.   I wouldn&#39;t be patient and nice if my kids stuck bottles in <br/>
the mouths of perfectly good newborn babies without even trying to nurse <br/>
them, or put them in daycare centers at six or nine or 129 weeks. &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;d <br/>
probably say something!<br/>
