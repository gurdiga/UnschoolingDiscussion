I&#39;ve always said &quot;dull women have immaculate homes and you&#39;ll never find me<br/>
dull!&quot;  Laughing Owl<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is definitely my philosophy!!!!! Has been for many many years, enjoy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dusting<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A house becomes a home when you can write &quot;I love you&quot; on the<br/>
furniture.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many countless hours that I have spent CLEANING! I<br/>
used to spend at least 8 hours every weekend making sure things were<br/>
just<br/>
perfect -&quot;in case someone came over&quot;. Then I realized one day that no<br/>
one<br/>
came over; they were all out living life and having fun!<br/>
<br/>
Now, when people visit, I find no need to explain the &quot;condition&quot; of my<br/>
home. They are more interested in hearing about the things I&#39;ve been<br/>
doing while I was away living life and having fun. If you haven&#39;t<br/>
figured<br/>
this out yet, please heed t! his advice.<br/>
<br/>
Life is short. Enjoy it! Dust if you must, but wouldn&#39;t it be better to<br/>
paint a picture or write a letter, bake a cake or plant a seed, ponder<br/>
the difference between want and need?<br/>
<br/>
Dust if you must, but there&#39;s not much time, with rivers to swim and<br/>
mountains to climb, music to hear and books to read, friends to cherish<br/>
and life to lead.<br/>
<br/>
Dust if you must, but the world&#39;s out there with the sun in your eyes,<br/>
the wind in your hair, a flutter of snow, a shower of rain. This day<br/>
will<br/>
not come around again.<br/>
<br/>
Dust if you must, but bear in mind, old age will come and it&#39;s not kind.<br/>
And when you go - and go you must - you, yourself will make more dust!<br/>
<br/>
Share this with all the wonderful women in your life! I JUST DID.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not what you gather, but what you scatter ! that tells what kind of<br/>
life you have lived.<br/>
May your path be lighted by your smile. :-}<br/>
