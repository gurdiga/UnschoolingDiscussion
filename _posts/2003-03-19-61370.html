<div id="ygrps-yiv-45145910">I don&#39;t try to cheer my dh up when he seems like he&#39;s grumpy because things <br/>
are getting out of control. I try to understand the source of his <br/>
frustration and tend to that. That helps in bringing him back to his sweet, <br/>
gentle self.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is what I was getting at, Mary. To appease is not to address the <br/>
problem, but to offer the same emotional support and respect as I do to my <br/>
kids or any one else I know seems to be the way. I found that I (this is not <br/>
Connie&#39;s story necessarily, only my own) tended to expect him to operate in a <br/>
vacuum, on his own, when it suddenly occured to me that he also had <br/>
struggles. His parents did not do a bang-up job with his emotional dev. as a <br/>
kid, to say the least. I have felt closer to   him as a result of this, and I <br/>
believe it sends the kids more of a message of respect for others when I <br/>
offer it to my husband. This does not mean that I let him bulldoze me or the <br/>
little guys.<br/>
Connie, it sounds like you have a huge crisis on your hands. I really feel <br/>
for you, and it sounds like  your partner is not able to hear what  you are <br/>
trying to say or do.<br/>
I really hope you have some support around you, and are able to get through <br/>
this with  your self and kids somewhat intact!!<br/>
Thinking of you, from far away!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t try to cheer my dh up when he seems like he&#39;s grumpy because <br/>
things <br/>
are getting out of control. I try to understand the source of his <br/>
frustration and tend to that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the source of his frustration SEEMS to be unschooling or the kids being <br/>
awake, or existing, how do you tend to that though?<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE, just like a kid, he&#39;s hungry, tired or sick.  Maybe he wants time to <br/>
talk to his wife alone about how yucky work was.  Maybe he&#39;s wanting the den <br/>
to watch a DVD he doesn&#39;t want to share with the kids for some reason.    <br/>
<br/>
My recommendation was to see to HIS needs and see whether when he&#39;s more <br/>
comfortable being him, he&#39;ll be more generous with letting others be them too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the same thing in differerent words.  By &quot;cheer up&quot; I didn&#39;t <br/>
mean show him a magic flower trick, or tell him a joke, but to give him a <br/>
chance to communicate about his own needy self instead of projecting all over <br/>
the family.<br/>

cheering up that was more temporary in nature.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was what I got from your statement, and was the way I meant it also, I <br/>
wonder why it took me so many years to figure out that he had needs also, I <br/>
feel really badly about that. It has made a difference for us since I did <br/>
start to get it!<br/>
