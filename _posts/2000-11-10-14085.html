<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364408021">I have a favor to ask and thats if people would please<br/>
edit their posts to the list.  Im on digest and for<br/>
myself anyway it makes things very difficult to read<br/>
when I cant find the new posts among the old.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than just hitting reply, please just use the<br/>
part of the message you wish to comment on and delete<br/>
the rest(as I did in my prior post).  It would be very<br/>
helpful to someone like me with poor eyesight when my<br/>
eyes get tired and I dont want to miss anything on<br/>
this list.  I have alot of learning to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You!  :)<br/>
<br/>
