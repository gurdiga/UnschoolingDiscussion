<br/>
Hubby and I are talking about unschooling and I was explaining what I&#39;d read <br/>
here about how the kids get to choose, what, where, when, how, why etc.  His <br/>
question was &quot;what if you (Dawn) are doing a reading in your office and I <br/>
(Steve) need to go to Target to exchange something.  Zak and Max have to come <br/>
with me because you can&#39;t watch them while you are working, so do I give Zak <br/>
the choice even though there isn&#39;t really a choice, because he has to come <br/>
with me&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I would love some feedback on this question.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the ways we deal wih such questions  here is to let the FaeBeast<br/>
know when he does and doesn&#39;t have a choice of going somewhere.  For<br/>
example, he prefers to stay home rather than go  grocery shopping. Most<br/>
times we can arrange that. On the  days we CAN&#39;T, I tell him that we<br/>
need to go to theg rocery. It falls into our family&#39;s category of things<br/>
that have to  be done for the family  as a whole. He&#39;s got the idea. Not<br/>
cleaning his room is HIS business. Not taking his toys out of the living<br/>
room before bed is FAMILY business because the  family has to either<br/>
avoid the toys or move them. It&#39;s  fair, all the adults have to put<br/>
their briefcases and video games (the &quot;grups toys&quot; as Ansley calls them)<br/>
away before THEY go  to  bed. There&#39;s good sense to rules for peaceful<br/>
coexistence - especially if  the kid can see that ALL the familyhas to<br/>
follow certain rules.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sanda he&#39;s 6 so it&#39;s not a choice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then it&#39;s cheating to ask him if he wants to go or not! (It wouldn&#39;t be a <br/>
real choice.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband used to do a bad, thoughtless thing when the kids were little.  <br/>
One would say &quot;Can I go with you!?&quot; when he was about to leave to do <br/>
something and instead of &quot;No, I need to leave really quick&quot; or &quot;you would be <br/>
too bored&quot; or &quot;I would rather go by myself,&quot; he would say &quot;No, you don&#39;t even <br/>
have any shoes on&quot; or &quot;No because you&#39;re not dressed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In such instances if they produce shoes in a flash or can get dressed in the <br/>
car, I figured he should take them.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t want to take them, but he wanted to blame them.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea where that came from, and he quit doing it after I talked to <br/>
him about it a couple of times.  <br/>
<br/>
The other night I left Marty home at his request (he&#39;s 12) while I went with <br/>
Holly 20 miles away to a folk singing session.  I tried to convince him to <br/>
come because I was afraid he would get spooked alone.  He had the dog, and he <br/>
stayed online talking to friends so it ended up not being a problem.  Kirby <br/>
had been elsewhere, my husband&#39;s out of state, and it just felt creepy to me, <br/>
having the whole family so split up.   I almost stayed home.  But I didn&#39;t <br/>
consider trying to force Marty to go with us to the folk singing.  He has <br/>
gone voluntarily lots of times before.  If he has no choice he can never go <br/>
voluntarily.  <br/>
<br/>
So I suffered. &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>

&gt; &quot;what if you (Dawn) are doing a reading in your office and I<br/>
&gt; (Steve) need to go to Target to exchange something.  Zak and Max have to come<br/>
&gt; with me because you can&#39;t watch them while you are working, so do I give Zak<br/>
&gt; the choice even though there isn&#39;t really a choice, because he has to come<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, Steve could determine if he &quot;needs to&quot; go to Target to exchange<br/>
something right-that-minute, or can it wait an hour if need be? If it really<br/>
can&#39;t wait (he&#39;s under a deadline on the project, it has be done now) and<br/>
there is no one else available to watch the kids, and they are too young to<br/>
remain on their own, then they wouldn&#39;t have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
They might not care. They might think a trip to Target is cool. If they DID<br/>
care (they were right in the middle of a project of their own,<br/>
thank-you-very-much, and resented having to up and leave it for an adult<br/>
errand) I would make a brief explanation of why it couldn&#39;t wait, and an<br/>
offer of a way to make amends for disrupting their time (playing a game,<br/>
taking a bike ride, whatever seems suitable). And I would try remember the<br/>
next time they asked ME for something that wasn&#39;t wildly convenient for me<br/>
that doing none-wildly-convenient things for each other,<br/>
parents-for-children and less frequently (hopefully) children-for-parents is<br/>
part of the deal of being a family.<br/>

him, then postpone the Target trip. (seems like Target could be postponed <br/>
easily enough). If he absolutely HAS to go somewhere, maybe you can have it <br/>
on a schedule and try to help them understand that at this particular time, <br/>
Dad has this appt and has to go, and since Mom is doing some work in her <br/>
office and cant be disturbed, you need to come with me. <br/>
<br/>
I guess the main answer is &quot;it depends&quot; because really it does and every <br/>
situation is different, but I think mutual respect is the key, and that <br/>
begins very very early.<br/>

<br/>
Some adult things really do have to happen and some kid things may seem <br/>
important to the kid at the moment but really can wait.  And making that <br/>
decision, as in where you explain why something can&#39;t wait, is the adult&#39;s <br/>
task a lot of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Being nice and patient and working together and respecting each other and all <br/>
the rest of it is great.  But sometimes the bank really will close and I need <br/>
to get there before it does.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For some people unschooling only applies to learning and not to parenting.<br/>
To others, they&#39;re inseparable. So there really isn&#39;t an official<br/>
unschooling answer to that. (Though there are plenty of unschoolers who will<br/>
tell you what they do ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For some people that might be considered Non Coercive Parenting (NCP to<br/>
those in the know) or Taking Children Seriously (TCS). Or noncoercive<br/>
parenting if you want to avoid the official stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Or it might just be parenting to some unschoolers :-)<br/>
<br/>
An NCP answer would be to expand your options to find a win-win situation,<br/>
for instance, turning the trip into something where you both end up with<br/>
something (like stopping at the park on the way back) or going at a<br/>
different time so he can stay home or ???<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is to be less coercive, it helps to turn things around so the<br/>
situation is between you and your husband. If you wouldn&#39;t want him treating<br/>
you that way, should you treat your child like that? So if, for some reason,<br/>
you couldn&#39;t be left at home alone -- pyromaniac tendencies or something ;-)<br/>
-- would you want him to drag you along to a boring store where you couldn&#39;t<br/>
look at the things you wanted to, had to stick right by his side while he<br/>
looked at fishing rods and tackle and such (or whatever would bore you out<br/>
of your gourd) just because he wanted to go right now and didn&#39;t want to<br/>
inconvenience himself by waiting until later?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482102845">Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
We do a few things in similar situations.  We trade baby-sitting with<br/>
our neighbors, live close to doting grandparents, link going out with<br/>
ice-cream and other child-friendly activities, invite a friend to join<br/>
us, order pizza and go to the store the next day, take the bus and call<br/>
it an adventure, have groceries delivered, run errands when everyone is<br/>
well rested and fed, keep really fun toys in the car, etc.  The best<br/>
advice I have received is to abandon my own agenda and learn to go with<br/>
the flow :).  It seems to me there are always more than two choices ~<br/>
sometimes it just takes some creative problem-solving.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend reading some of these articles:<br/>

way too often adults feel that since we&#39;re doing things for the family that<br/>
we don&#39;t have a choice about (though that often isn&#39;t as true as we assume<br/>
it is) then our things are important and kid things aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
A kid playing a game is &quot;just&quot; a kid playing whereas when we &quot;need&#39; to go to<br/>
the supermarket now so we have food for dinner, therefore our need is<br/>
important and theirs can wait.<br/>
<br/>
But their need to play is just as great -- in fact greater since they are<br/>
doing something that is personally meaningful -- than our need for food,<br/>
particularly since we&#39;ve (usually) created the situation ourselves by not<br/>
planning ahead.<br/>
<br/>
If a child were to forget he needed something for a class meeting in 20<br/>
minutes, we&#39;d be irritated that he inconvenienced us and he might get<br/>
lectured about planning ahead and so on. And yet if we forget to go to the<br/>
bank until 15 minutes before it closes and end up inconveniencing the kids,<br/>
we probably would be upset if the children got upset with us because we&#39;d<br/>
feel it&#39;s just something we &quot;have&quot; to do. When actually an apology to the<br/>
kids is in order -- *if* that&#39;s how we&#39;d want the kids to behave towards<br/>
others in similar circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to look at the things we do for the family not as have<br/>
tos but as things we want to do for them. We don&#39;t *have* to make dinner<br/>
every night. We *could* buy prepared food, or take out, or cook once a month<br/>
or ??? People will say they &quot;can&#39;t&quot; eat out every night (because of the<br/>
expense or too many calories or whatever) but the truth is we *could*, but<br/>
we *choose* not to because the consequences aren&#39;t worth dealing with. We<br/>
*do* choose the option of cooking most nights because that&#39;s the option with<br/>
the consequences we find least objectionable.<br/>
<br/>
We choose to keep the house to a certain standard *not* because we have to<br/>
but because that&#39;s what we *want* to do. As long as it isn&#39;t unhealthy, the<br/>
&quot;home police&quot; wont&#39; come in and arrest us if we don&#39;t scrub the toilet every<br/>
week (or every month or every six months) ;-), if our laundry isn&#39;t folded<br/>
and put away neatly, if the toys are left in front of the TV.<br/>

amount of my being nice or planning ahead or lowering my housekeeping <br/>
standards (which couldn&#39;t really be much lower) or respecting my kids&#39; play <br/>
needs is going to change the fact that the check just got written by the <br/>
client and the guys really need their payroll money and I really have to get <br/>
to the bank before it closes and there really is nobody else to watch my kids <br/>
and they really do just have to stop what they are doing and come along.  <br/>
<br/>
Not every day.  And I try to explain.  But sometimes you really do have to <br/>
put on your shoes and get in the car and schlepp around with Mom.  <br/>

number of toys is powers of ten over your idea of unspeakable ;-)<br/>
