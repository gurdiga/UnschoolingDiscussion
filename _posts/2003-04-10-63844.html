Christians, it seems. Making fun of extreme religious people by posting <br/>
mocking websites(&quot;very Christian, very crazy&quot;), making blanket statements <br/>
about what Christians will do, about being offended at shows, or inviting <br/>
your kids and then you to church if you are baptist. Calling them irritating <br/>
Jesus Freaks, Christian nuts, do I need to go on? <br/>
<br/>
I watch Friends and Will and Grace, I see  no problem with them, my children <br/>
are free to watch. And I don&#39;t shame my children. Homosexuality is something <br/>
I refuse to judge. It&#39;s not my place. Any other stereotypes I&#39;ve neglected?<br/>
<br/>
Is it PC to be prejudiced against Christians? It stings, and it really <br/>
interferes with the impression of some folks who are supposed to be so <br/>
open-minded and loving to their kids. I am having a hard time accepting <br/>
mentors here could be so careless with generalizations about people I love <br/>
and know, and the person I am. The fact that even one person reads here to <br/>
learn about being an unschooler and is a fundamentalist, southern baptist, <br/>
bible literalist, shows that we aren&#39;t all alike, and aren&#39;t deserving of the <br/>
little jabs.<br/>
<br/>
 I hope I am wrong on this, but I will not sit back and let it go unchecked <br/>
any longer. From someone that takes a lot to get offended, and tries not to <br/>
be offensive. If I didn&#39;t care so much about this list, I couldn&#39;t be this <br/>
honest. <br/>

How much have you read about Christian homeschoolers?  <br/>
If the answer is &quot;not much,&quot; you need to do so.  It would not only release <br/>
some of your frustration, it would keep you from posting in defense anymore.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I watch Friends and Will and Grace, I see  no problem with them, my <br/>
children <br/>
are free to watch. And I don&#39;t shame my children. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you homeschooling because you are a fundamentalist Christian?<br/>
I doubt it.<br/>
You probably would be using a full-on Christian curriculum.<br/>
If you are NOT homeschooling because you are a fundamentalist Christian, as <br/>
so many thousands of women ARE doing, many against their will (I&#39;m dead <br/>
serious), then there was no reason for you to get huffy, because I wasn&#39;t <br/>
talking about you at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The fact that even one person reads here to <br/>

<br/>
I grew up a fundamentalist Southern Baptist Bible literalist, so guess what?<br/>
I know what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>

Sit back.  This, too, comes up periodically.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If I didn&#39;t care so much about this list, I couldn&#39;t be this honest. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel the very same way.<br/>
<br/>
Any homeschooler who isn&#39;t fully aware of the immensity and offensiveness of <br/>
the fundamentalist homeschooling movement and its affect on ALL homeschooling <br/>
and the reputation of all homeschoolers is full-on handicapped in any <br/>
discussion about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here, in case you want to read more.<br/>
I certainly won&#39;t blame you if you don&#39;t want to read it, but don&#39;t assume <br/>

A quote from another site:<br/>
-=-The subject of homeschool came up quite often, with even my son ASKING me <br/>
to homeschool him. I said no way. God had different plans. He gave me a <br/>
burden. I was overwhelmed with the belief that I was missing out on His goals <br/>
for me and began to pray, search scripture and question what God had planned <br/>
for me. I was very uneasy and unsettled when I entered into another Bible <br/>
study. As God would have it, there were homeschool moms and their children in <br/>
the study with me. I can&#39;t remember them ever telling me I should homeschool, <br/>
but I loved their quiet spirits and submissive lives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very typical quote.  There are tons like it buried here and there on internet <br/>
sites.<br/>
Some women say they did NOT want to homeschool, but their husbands announced <br/>
that God had told them (husband) that they would be homeschooling, and so the <br/>
woman in obedience had no choice.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;By keeping in mind that we are homeschooling out of obedience, not preference<br/>
, our family has avoided becoming discouraged when things become difficult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot; &quot;Obviously those who argue that parents should educate their own children <br/>
are trying to take seriously the biblical teaching.&quot; He even sets aside the <br/>
arguments of those who do not believe parents can do the job. &quot;We must not <br/>
use our supposed incompetence or lack of time as an excuse for disobedience <br/>
to a biblical command. If we have problems and difficulties in obeying the <br/>
commandment, then we should seek ways to overcome them. Our responsibilities <br/>
as parents cannot be simply brushed aside.&quot;&quot;<br/>

 <br/>
I was raised Pentecostal.  I haven&#39;t been to all Pentecostal churches,<br/>
but let me tell you, the one I was raised in made me never set foot in<br/>
another one.  It was all about &quot;obedience&quot; and spanking, and parents<br/>
would lament that it&#39;s no longer legal to stone disobedient children as<br/>
it was in Biblical days.<br/>
 <br/>
When my husband and I were married, we lived in Newark (Hanover,<br/>
actually, which is about two square miles).  There was an Apostolic<br/>
church within a block of our home, and we started going there to meet<br/>
people.  The women at the church homeschooled and I was excited because<br/>
even though I didn&#39;t have kids, I knew I&#39;d homeschool them when I did.<br/>
Well, these women were downright scary.  They had the most<br/>
poorly-behaved children I have ever met in my life, and they responded<br/>
to every misbehavior by screaming, &quot;I&#39;m going to spank you if you don&#39;t<br/>
stop what you&#39;re doing right now!&quot;  In twenty minutes, this would be<br/>
shouted out probably fifty times, and then kids would be grabbed by the<br/>
arm and spanked right there in front of everyone, and they&#39;d immediately<br/>
start misbehaving again.<br/>
 <br/>
We spent two years living in Steubenville, and most of the homeschoolers<br/>
there are Catholic.  Now, most of the Catholics I&#39;ve known in my life<br/>
have been very relaxed about religion.  But the Franciscan University of<br/>
Steubenville attracts the most uptight Catholics from around the country<br/>
and concentrates them in one town.  Almost all of the women whose<br/>
husbands attend the Franciscan University homeschool.  It would really<br/>
be funny to see the way they epitomize all the stereotypes of<br/>
&quot;homeschoolers&quot;, except it isn&#39;t funny because it&#39;s real.  And my mom is<br/>
a librarian in that town and she&#39;s against homeschooling because of it.<br/>
She knows I&#39;m not even Christian, let alone fundamentalist, but she<br/>
can&#39;t think about homeschooling without thinking about these women<br/>
coming into the library with their poorly-adjusted children, and she&#39;s<br/>
convinced my kids will be &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I think something like seventy percent of Americans are Christian.  And<br/>
I know darn well seventy percent of Americans are not anything like the<br/>
fundamentalists I&#39;ve met in my lifetime.  Most Christians don&#39;t want to<br/>
be associated with the &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot;, apparently yourself included.<br/>
Just like most Muslims don&#39;t want to be associated with the<br/>
fundamentalists in their religion either.  <br/>
 <br/>
You say, &gt;&gt;&gt;Making fun of extreme religious people&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s a huge difference between extremely spiritual people and<br/>
extremely religious people.  Spiritual people are some of the calmest,<br/>
most inspiring people in the world.  Mother Theresa was an extremely<br/>
spiritual Catholic, and I don&#39;t know anyone of any religion who thought<br/>
she was a freak.  Extremely religious people, on the other hand, are<br/>
often shrill, paranoid, and dangerous.  Spiritual Christians believe<br/>
that God is Love and they believe the best thing they can do is be a<br/>
model of that love.  Religious Christians believe that every word of the<br/>
Bible is infallible and they seek out people who aren&#39;t as &quot;holy&quot; as<br/>
they are, and persecute them.  Spirituality is about one&#39;s relationship<br/>
with the Infinite.  Religion is about being &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
Even Jesus spoke out against the fundamentalists in his religion in his<br/>
time.  He called them vipers and hypocrites. <br/>
<br/>
You say, &gt;&gt;&gt; prejudiced against Christians&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;folks who are supposed to<br/>
be so <br/>
open-minded&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;so careless with generalizations&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
What I see is not people who know nothing about Christians being<br/>
prejudiced against the religion.  What I see is that the people who are<br/>
most outspoken against Christianity are people who were raised in<br/>
fundamentalist homes and have a lot of negative experience with<br/>
fundamentalist Christians.  One of the reasons televangelists are so<br/>
much more intolerant of Pagans and Wiccans than any other religion is<br/>
because most people are born into a religion, while the vast majority of<br/>
Pagans and Wiccans were raised Christian and left the religion<br/>
(ironically, because of people like the televangelists).  <br/>
 <br/>
If being a Christian means that you love Jesus, wonderful.  People who<br/>
truly love their God are beautiful people, whether their God is Jesus,<br/>
Allah, Krishna, Inanna, Isis, Freya.  If being a Christian means that<br/>
you spank your kids and require obedience and submit to your husband and<br/>
think everyone is going to hell unless they&#39;re a member of your church,<br/>
which is the Only One Right and True interpretation of the Only One True<br/>
God, then I can&#39;t pretend that&#39;s not an ugly thing.  Fundamentalism is<br/>
ugly whether it&#39;s Christians, or the Muslims who feel Allah wants them<br/>
to kill all &quot;infidels&quot; or the Pagan Aztecs who practiced human<br/>
sacrifice.  <br/>
 <br/>
Gandhi was killed by a Hindu fundamentalist who opposed his idea of<br/>
tolerance between the Muslims and Hindus in India.  Gandhi was an<br/>
example of a spiritual person.  The person who killed him is an example<br/>
of a religious people.<br/>
 <br/>
I feel very strongly about this issue too.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>BUT, just because it was the husbands idea (and she really DOES have choices, <br/>
we all have choices, hers is to be the wife the Bible describes) to <br/>
homeschool does not mean she does do it just as well as any of us.<br/>
<br/>
I seem to get from the sense of the post that unless you are homeschooling <br/>
for reasons other than religion you probably aren&#39;t doing it for the RIGHT <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Christian parents love their children just as much as any other way of life.  <br/>
There are some bad examples in EVERY walk of life, not just a group <br/>
generalization.<br/>
<br/>
I remember just last week someone cautioning me to avoid generalizations when <br/>
it came to mothers in particular because there is no way to make a blanket <br/>
statement about mothers and love that it true.  I believe the same would be <br/>
true for Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Christian too, I grew up very strict Baptist, the church is NOT the same <br/>
as it was 25 years ago.  It&#39;s not a cult that controls the minds of the women <br/>
and children.  There are things that are different than what others do, but <br/>
that is the basis for all religions, difference and tolerance for that <br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
No one group of people is hurting homeschooling anymore than another group. <br/>
One group might be more VOCAL about how/why they homeschool than others but <br/>
is the REASON really what&#39;s important?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it about giving our children the best life we know how to?  Within our <br/>
belief system?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are those that are a detriment to homeschooling simply BECAUSE <br/>
of being a fundamentalist Christian, I know I can name one right now.  On the <br/>
surface it appears that&#39;s why she tries to homeschool her grandchildren one <br/>
by one until they rebel.  But I know the woman, it&#39;s not about keeping them <br/>
from the &quot;worldly&quot; things of school at all.  It&#39;s about control, it&#39;s about <br/>
being needed and loved and the little preschool toddlers and then young <br/>
elementary age children need and love her as long as she doesn&#39;t let them out <br/>
of her sight and she can baby them into submission.<br/>
<br/>
So to everyone else, it looks like these kids get a bum education for five, <br/>
six or more years because the woman is a Christian devoted to her <br/>
grandchildren but unless you are really around the person, you wouldn&#39;t know <br/>
what REALLY drives them and why they really aren&#39;t very good at allowing <br/>
their children (grandchildren) to grow and learn and explore the world.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably any number of homeschooling parents who are inadequately <br/>
equipped to be preparing their children for life they just aren&#39;t vocal about <br/>
it maybe.<br/>
<br/>
So I can understand why the post was hurtful because it is referred to again <br/>
and again.  Seems like if someone has a bad experience in their life somehow <br/>
with it or they&#39;ve heard  or read or seen it makes it a fact.  It is a fact <br/>
but not necessarily applies to EVERYONE in those circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found Christians to be wonderfully warm, intelligent, loving, caring <br/>
people.  They love their kids, they want the absolute best for them, just <br/>
like I do. (most of them anyway)<br/>
<br/>
Just stating my observations.<br/>
<br/>
glena who can see how it might upset someone to keep getting talked about in <br/>
generalities especially such ugly ones<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655057833">Many Pagans have gotten into the habit of differntiating between<br/>
fundamentalist Christians (who hold a strict interpretation of the Bible and<br/>
are reasonable, loving people, even if they think those of other faiths are<br/>
&quot;wrong) and &quot;fundy&quot; Christians (who are the extremists who many of us are<br/>
reacting to here.)  What&#39;s important to remember, as Sorcha pointed<br/>
out---there are &quot;fundies&quot; in any faith.  We have them in paganism on both<br/>
ends of the spectrum--rigid thinking exists everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I try to stay away from fundy thinking in ANY arena.  But I have learned<br/>
that simply being a fundamentalist Christian does NOT make you a fundy.  I<br/>
try very hard to be clear which I mean when speaking about Christians.  I<br/>
will however, speak out against fundism anywhere I see it.<br/>

  truly love their God are beautiful people, whether their God is Jesus,<br/>
  Allah, Krishna, Inanna, Isis, Freya.  If being a Christian means that<br/>
  you spank your kids and require obedience and submit to your husband and<br/>
  think everyone is going to hell unless they&#39;re a member of your church,<br/>
  which is the Only One Right and True interpretation of the Only One True<br/>
  God, then I can&#39;t pretend that&#39;s not an ugly thing.  Fundamentalism is<br/>
  ugly whether it&#39;s Christians, or the Muslims who feel Allah wants them<br/>
  to kill all &quot;infidels&quot; or the Pagan Aztecs who practiced human<br/>
  sacrifice.  <br/>
<br/>
  Gandhi was killed by a Hindu fundamentalist who opposed his idea of<br/>
  tolerance between the Muslims and Hindus in India.  Gandhi was an<br/>
  example of a spiritual person.  The person who killed him is an example<br/>
  of a religious people.<br/>
<br/>
  I feel very strongly about this issue too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560158691">Now from the point of view of some one who is born again, but against &quot;church&#39;s policy&quot; still has a great respect for any and all religions and from some one who spanks -as discipline not torture or abuse - their children. Let me weigh in here.<br/>
First off, You will find zealots in any and ALL religion, belief structures, no matter where that will make it an automatic turn off. It happened to me. For years I refused to set foot into a church. I felt that they were all just a bunch of Sunday Christians and every day devils. At least that is how the majority of so called Christians I met acted. My current church is so much different and I do thank God that I was able to find it. But I think the thing that people miss and forget is that Jesus was not teaching a religion as He was a way of life. The same holds true for ANY belief system. It is a way of life that most people forget and that&#39;s what leads to all the conflicts and hypocrisies that we are all witness to each day.<br/>
Another thing is a total and complete lack of information and down right ignorance. I LOVE to learn and be exposed to different belief structures. You get to see just how everything is interconnected on the most basic of levels. We each believe in an omniscient, omnipotent being who bestows love and peace and guidance unto the followers of the belief structure. But I am digressing here, :o)<br/>
As for the spanking part. I use it as a last resort. If they get spanked once a month the get spanked a lot. Besides it does not work all the time and with each child. For my son, I have to put him in a corner and let him have time to reflect on what he has done. Within a minute I get an attitude adjustment from him. For the older children I take away something they like or revoke something. That gets their attention in no time flat. The little one, with certain things I am still finding her threshold. She is stubborn one and can try the patience of a saint when she is ready. But I feel it has its place. I know what it means to be abused. So does their father. And he does not like me to spank them for anything, but seeing as I am the disciplinarian, he just respectfully bows out, :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let a bad experience with one group of Christians make you feel that all are crazy belt toting wild eyed people who beat their children at the drop of a hat for no good reason. We are out here and find moderation for what we do.<br/>
<br/>
I see that there are wiccans here? I have been trying to find out more about that belief system. I am not looking to convert mind you, but I am just fascinated by the different theologies in this very small world and want to learn as much as possible. So my email is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:yhanley@...">yhanley@...</a> if you are willing to share I am more than willing to listen :o))<br/>

into a bashing of Christians or fundamentalists in general.<br/>

offensive.  I live in NC.  Most of the homeschoolers I know are very <br/>
conservative.  They do &quot;school at home&quot; using the Christian curriculum.  They <br/>
spank and use the Bible to justify it.  They are very shaming of their <br/>
children etc etc.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a large section of the Christian community who think, believe and <br/>
act this way.  Not me personally so I don&#39;t take any offense.  Maybe it would <br/>
be easier if you separated yourself from the comments.  That is how I look at <br/>
it.  I do not fit the &quot;Christian Homeschooler&quot; mold.  And believe me there is <br/>
one.<br/>

<br/>
I disagree about both sentences. Baptist in the past probably had as many variations as homeschooling does today.   I grew up Southern Baptist in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.    Member churches of the Southern Baptist Convention were &quot;stricter&quot;  than &quot;northern&quot; Baptists but not as fundamentalist as &quot;foot-washing Baptists&quot; or &quot;mountain Baptists&quot;  or even &quot;Independent Baptists&quot;.  Individual churches in the Southern Baptist Convention were independent and individuals WITHIN those churches were also expected to be independently accountable for interpretations of the Bible and for church government structure.   The churches were joined together for political and financial purposes (such as providing support for &quot;missionaries&quot;) or even occasional lobbying at local, state, or federal levels (and not all members agreed on all issues but they were indeed asked whether they wished to join in on different issues).   In some churches and within the church culture there was indeed sometimes an appearance of &quot;cultism&quot; (a concept not easily recognized then)  but  in many churches there was also an empowering of women and children far beyond some Protestant denominations.   For example, I had a full vote in church decisions while still a 10 year old female. These decisions could include whether to accept someone into &quot;full fellowship&quot;  either &quot;by promise of letter&quot;  or &quot;profession of faith&quot;; or to &quot;withdraw fellowship&quot; from those who had lost their way.   Even a full vote in determining whether a particular person had indeed been &quot;called&quot; to lead the congregation as a pastor, minister of music, or youth leader.  As well as a vote in determining the salary of church workers and where a particular &quot;love offering&quot;  would be sent. <br/>
<br/>
There WAS an expectation of &quot;witnessing&quot; to the &quot;unsaved&quot;  as well as being careful about getting &quot;unequally yoked&quot;,  just as there were rife rumors about the practices of other denominations but there was not the current structure of having a very large organization placing particular faith and action requirements on individual churches or even national &quot;leaders&quot; claiming authority over individuals within or without a particular church congregation.   Evangelists and revivals, yes......but always with an awareness that as Baptists there was no earthly intermediary between  God/Jesus  and the individual.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I find today&#39;s Southern Baptist Churches to be WAY more intolerant than some strict Baptists of 25 years ago.   Also, with the admonition that schools AND colleges expecting support within the convention are permitted to hire only teachers  who support Biblical Inerrancy (as interpreted by leaders and not individuals),   I find it hard to escape the perception that there is certainly an attempt to control the minds of children and youth. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my take on the &quot;organized&quot; Baptists of today.  Of course anyone can say &quot;I am a Baptist&quot;  just as easily as saying &quot;I homeschool&quot;.   It is when certain individuals or small groups claim the authority to define the meaning of either term and heavily proselytize the one true way that big problems arise. <br/>
<br/>
Vicki <br/>
P.S.:  I agree that those who object to the phrase &quot;homeschool BECAUSE you are a fundamentalist Christian&quot; need to educate themselves via personal research.  And also agree with Kelly that stating &quot;&gt; No one group of people is hurting homeschooling anymore than another group. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; One group might be more VOCAL about how/why they homeschool than others but <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is the REASON really what&#39;s important?&quot;   to be a very definite indicator that more historical research is needed.    <br/>

  aspects of the movement that relate to homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m guessing here but it seems to me the real topic is about respect for people. My take on unschooling is that it is about trust,respect, freedom to grow, be healthy in spirit, body and mind and advocating for childrens rights to be treated as every individual deserves and if a set of values or beliefs interferes with that I for one will not support the theory that everyone is where they are at and that is okay. I&#39;m all for letting it be known that children need to be treated without violence,coercion or control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793436576">Spanking is not &quot;discipline&quot;.  It&#39;s punishment.  It actually interferes<br/>
with the development of discipline.  When my parents spanked me, I<br/>
didn&#39;t think, &quot;Gee, I should behave better.&quot;  I thought, &quot;My parents are<br/>
jerks and I hate them.&quot;  Things would calm down and I would like them<br/>
again for awhile, but all those spankings over all those years built up<br/>
a huge level of resentment.  When I was a teenager, my mom could not<br/>
understand where all the &quot;sudden&quot; hate I had for her was coming from.<br/>
 <br/>
Taking away things that are important to you children is also<br/>
punishment, not discipline.  When my mom did that to me, I hated her for<br/>
it.  I also learned to always be on guard, and never let her know that<br/>
something was truly important to me.<br/>

that is the basis for all religions, difference and tolerance for that <br/>
difference. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  If it was important, please rephrase it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;I seem to get from the sense of the post that unless you are homeschooling <br/>
for reasons other than religion you probably aren&#39;t doing it for the RIGHT <br/>
reasons.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If someone is homeschooling for religious reasons, it&#39;s about religion, not <br/>
about homeschooling.  It&#39;s about isolating their children from evil Satanic <br/>
influences, and if you don&#39;t believe that, go to google.com and put in <br/>
statement of faith homeschooling and read for at least twenty minutes before <br/>
you write anything else like this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;BUT, just because it was the husbands idea (and she really DOES have <br/>
choices, <br/>
we all have choices, hers is to be the wife the Bible describes) to <br/>
homeschool does not mean she does do it just as well as any of us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you wrote what you meant to write.  Your post was contradictory <br/>
and could have used proofreading, but more than that it would have done you <br/>
more good to read those links than to just rattle on without learning more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No one group of people is hurting homeschooling anymore than another group. <br/>
One group might be more VOCAL about how/why they homeschool than others but <br/>
is the REASON really what&#39;s important?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Read about HSLDA before you EVER again say no one group of people is hurting <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
And YES I believe the reason is important.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe if you&#39;re willing to say the reason for homeschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
important that you would be unschooling.  You think restrictive school at <br/>
home in an abusive family which teaches full-on reconstructed history and <br/>
made up science is as good as unschooling?<br/>

 It was Baptist only in it&#39;s affiliation, in four years I saw not one sign of <br/>
anything remotely resembling the Baptist faith.  You could pick CoEd dorms or <br/>
not.  There were no particular rules about attending any kind of service.  No <br/>
regulations about dress codes or curfews.  Science classes taught even <br/>
&quot;secular&quot; science one might call it.  Depending of on which course you took <br/>
you got whatever outlook you wanted to study.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Liberty University in Lynchburg is a different story all together.<br/>

So I guess they are all different too, just like people?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I can&#39;t believe if you&#39;re willing to say the reason for homeschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; important that you would be unschooling.  You think restrictive school at <br/>
&gt; home in an abusive family which teaches full-on reconstructed history and <br/>
&gt; made up science is as good as unschooling?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not in the homes of all these people to sit in judgement of what they do. <br/>
 I believe I said that why would they be homeschooling IF they didn&#39;t think <br/>
they were doing the BEST they could for their children.<br/>
<br/>
What is best for my children, might not be best for your children.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what others instruct, teach, expose their children too, frankly <br/>
it&#39;s none of anyone&#39;s business what I do with my children really, as long as <br/>
they are healthy, happy, learning and unharmed.  So while we don&#39;t want the <br/>
government judging how or when we allow our children to learn, can we sit in <br/>
judgement of others who are doing the same for their children.<br/>
<br/>
I do not dispute there are children who should not be homeschooled.  There <br/>
are also children that are IN school that most certainly would be better off <br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
We do the absolute best we can for our children.  Just because my morality is <br/>
different from someone elses I do not believe that I am in any was superior <br/>
or that they are inferior.<br/>
<br/>
I have hostility because of the way I was raised too, I try to let it go and <br/>
not judge others who truly believe in their hearts that they are doing the <br/>
right thing for their children.  It&#39;s not mine to judge.  However, if they <br/>
are starving or abusing their children then that&#39;s different.  That&#39;s against <br/>
the law and a crime, it&#39;s not against the law to teach one&#39;s children in <br/>
one&#39;s own way your own values.  They will grow up and learn on their own what <br/>
is and isn&#39;t important to them.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing, I think we all probably come to homeschooling/unschooling <br/>
for a variety of different reasons, different motivating factors, a final <br/>
last straw, a mother who knew since BEFORE she had children this would be her <br/>
course, and everything in between.<br/>
<br/>
Does it make it wrong how we get here?  As long as we are doing the absolute <br/>
best we can for our child/children isn&#39;t that all you can do?  Is it the <br/>
motivation for the journey that&#39;s important or is it the journey itself that <br/>
is THE most important thing for our children?<br/>
<br/>
Personally I don&#39;t think other unschoolers or homeschoolers are the enemy.  <br/>
Others might think differently, and that&#39;s OK.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The original remark made -- while I&#39;d expect many to disagree and not see<br/>
the connection -- was loosely tied to parenting and unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even think it was loose!  <br/>
<br/>
The question was what was okay for kids to see.<br/>
<br/>
If I were Christian my answer would be different.  If I were a Christian <br/>
homeschooler, Holly wouldn&#39;t be allowed to watch Friends or Dharma and Greg <br/>
or the Simpsons or anything else but maybe Little House on the Prairie and <br/>
Bonanza, those shows that glorify a fantasy Christian pioneerland.<br/>
<br/>
Because my decisions aren&#39;t made from a position of puritanical fear of human <br/>
behavior, my answers are different than they would be otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
And much or most of the fear adult parents have of sex DOES come from passed <br/>
down puritanical and fundamentalist issues.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST we remember our priorities and philosophies, and THEN we can make <br/>
decisions. <br/>
<br/>
When people ask questions here about what&#39;s okay or when something is okay, <br/>
the answer HAS to be &quot;depends on your priorities and beliefs.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt;If they get spanked once a month the get spanked a lot. Besides it does not <br/>
work all the time and with each child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It DOES work.  It just doesn&#39;t do what you want it to do.<br/>
School lessons ALWAYS work.  Most often they teach children to hate lessons, <br/>
and then the subject matter, and then learning itself.  School has <br/>
effectively done that for over a hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
When you hit your child, no matter what you tell him, you erode the <br/>
relationship between you.  You spend trust points.  And if the explanations <br/>
seem lame, you could begin to teach him you&#39;re not really very compassionate <br/>
or bright.  I&#39;m saying that because I was five or six when I started paying <br/>
attention to when and why my mother spanked and what her justifications were. <br/>
 I respected her less every time, until I could hardly go lower in my <br/>
estimation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  For my son, I have to put him in a corner and let him have time to <br/>
reflect on what he has done.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You choose to.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For the older children I take away something they like or revoke something. <br/>
That gets their attention in no time flat. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Getting their attention isn&#39;t the same as helping them understand how to make <br/>
decisions on their own.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know what it means to be abused. So does their father. And he does not <br/>
like me to spank them for anything, but seeing as I am the disciplinarian, he <br/>
just respectfully bows out, :o)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lesser abuse can still be abusive, though it can seem benign by comparison.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Don&#39;t let a bad experience with one group of Christians make you feel that <br/>
all are crazy belt toting wild eyed people who beat their children at the <br/>
drop of a hat for no good reason. We are out here and find moderation for <br/>
what we do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please read those links and don&#39;t just guess or make up arguments to &#39;defend&#39; <br/>

  I don&#39;t believe this is about whether we think we are better than anyone else. This for me is about passion and advocacy.For me this is not even about morality. When fundamentalism leads you to not think for yourself and to harm others I believe I have a right to say something. I don&#39;t care if that parent thinks they are doing there best.Everyone of us knows those people who did not stand up for a child because his parent was doing his/her best.<br/>
  Under no circumstance is this okay to me .When we don&#39;t speak out then we don&#39;t advocate for a different and better way.Because I think it is better does not mean I think I have the right answers. I just look in my heart and the eyes of my children and know they should not be treated in an inferior way.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The churches were joined together for political and financial purposes <br/>
(such as providing support for &quot;missionaries&quot;) or even occasional lobbying &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And largely, too, to run a publishing business so people could buy Sunday <br/>
School materials and blanks for churc programs and training materials and <br/>
little booklets for witnessing and leaflets to pass out to those who&#39;ve <br/>
missed church, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In some churches and within the church culture there was indeed sometimes <br/>
an appearance of &quot;cultism&quot; (a concept not easily recognized then)  but  in <br/>
many churches there was also an empowering of women and children far beyond <br/>
some Protestant denominations.   For example, I had a full vote in church <br/>
decisions while still a 10 year old female. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  I could go to kid OR adult functions (choir, classes), and we were <br/>
told frequently that the convention was to provide services and did not <br/>
dictate belief or dogma to individual churches, but each was to study the <br/>
Bible and our soul&#39;s health was between us and Jesus, individually.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even a full vote in determining whether a particular person had indeed been <br/>
&quot;called&quot; to lead the congregation as a pastor, minister of music, or youth <br/>
leader.  As well as a vote in determining the salary of church workers and <br/>
where a particular &quot;love offering&quot;  would be sent. .&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember voting on who would be deacons, LOTS.  And every male member was <br/>
listed, even those I  knew as a kid were not believers, were drunks, were <br/>
fooling around.  So even as a kid, my vote WAS valuable.  I voted for people <br/>
who were honest and nice to women and children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I find today&#39;s Southern Baptist Churches to be WAY more intolerant than <br/>
some strict Baptists of 25 years ago. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen the same thing.  And their lobbying got very agressive and hostile <br/>
and narrowly focussed.<br/>

 But unschooling/homeschooling for religious reasons is ABUSE?  Then we are <br/>
saying that their religion is invalid.  That their beliefs hurt children.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I must be completely misunderstanding this.  What exactly is it about <br/>
homeschooled/unschooled &quot;religious&quot; families that is inferior?  Maybe then I <br/>
will understand better what you are trying to say.<br/>

&lt;&lt;As for the spanking part. I use it as a last resort. If they get spanked<br/>
once a month the get spanked a lot. Besides it does not work all the time<br/>
and with each child. For my son, I have to put him in a corner and let him<br/>

adjustment from him. For the older children I take away something they like<br/>
or revoke something. That gets their attention in no time flat. The little<br/>
one, with certain things I am still finding her threshold. She is stubborn<br/>
one and can try the patience of a saint when she is ready. But I feel it has<br/>
its place. I know what it means to be abused. So does their father. And he<br/>
does not like me to spank them for anything, but seeing as I am the<br/>
disciplinarian, he just respectfully bows out, :o)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to unschool I would suggest you read some archives or<br/>
articles on discipline. I&#39;m sure Sandra could point some out to you.<br/>
Spanking, putting your children in the corner and taking personal things<br/>
away from them is punishment, punishment that won&#39;t get anything but fear<br/>
and disrespect from your children. Not conducive to unschooling.<br/>

that I recognize that I am a Christian unschooler/homeschoolers.  But that my <br/>
ideas concerning children, unschooling/homeschooling are far away from the <br/>
majority of Christian unschoolers/homeschoolers.  And I am speaking not from <br/>
articles read or web pages etc but from the two homeschooling groups I am in <br/>
as well.  <br/>
<br/>
That does not make me ashamed to be a Christian.  Nor does it mean that I am <br/>
not friendly with these mothers.  I do feel that they are doing the best they <br/>
know how for their children.  For most of them they are homeschooling because <br/>
their preacher told them it is what God has called them to do.  They will <br/>
share this openly.  They love their children etc.  And I do share me beliefs <br/>
when the time is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
I separate myself from comments about Christians because I recognize that <br/>
when people say things they are speaking about the majority.  No one is <br/>
attacking me personally.  <br/>
