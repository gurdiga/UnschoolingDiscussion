The nine-banded armadillo has delayed implantation.<br/>
Tracy<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reproduction in the nine-banded armadillo is marked by two distinct and apparently unrelated phenomena: the long period of arrested development of the blastocyst prior to implantation (delayed implantation), and the phenomenon of specific polyembryony, which results in the normal formation of identical quadruplets. In normal years about half of the females become pregnant by the end of July, which is the beginning of the breeding season. At 5-7 days the ovum forms a blastocyst and passes into the uterus. At this point development ceases, and the vesicle remains free in the uterus. Here it is constantly bathed in fluids secreted by the glandular lining of the uterus, which supplies enough nutrition and oxygen for survival. Implantation does not occur until November, about 14 weeks after fertilization. During this process, the blastocyst divides into growth centers, each of which very shortly redivides to produce four embryonic growth centers attached by a common placenta to the uterus. Development of each of the embryos then proceeds normally, and the four young are born approximately 4 months later in March, although some females have been noted with new litters as early as February and as late as the latter part of May. Young are born fully formed and with eyes open. Within a few hours they are walking, and they begin to accompany the mother on foraging expeditions within a few weeks. The nursing period is probably less than 2 months, but the young may remain with the mother even after weaning until they are several months old. Normally the young born in one year mature during the winter and mate for the first time in the early summer of the following year.<br/>
<br/>
This phenomenon of delayed implantation may, in part, account for the successful invasion of the armadillo into temperate regions. Without this characteristic of the reproductive cycle, the young would be born at the beginning of winter, when their chance of survival would be greatly reduced. Apparently, the reproductive cycle is easily affected by adverse environmental conditions, particularly drought conditions. This probably is due to the shortage of ground insects or the difficulty of obtaining these in sandy or hard dried soils.<br/>

Yes this one was with lions too. I didn&#39;t catch the whole thing, I was in<br/>
and out of the living room as usual. I remember though where some female<br/>
lions attacked another female lion and killed her. Hyenas had a nice feast<br/>
with that one. That&#39;s when I actually had to leave the room. It wasn&#39;t a<br/>
quick attack and done for food. Too much for me to watch.<br/>

I can&#39;t remember.  They have kind of baboon faces, but they&#39;re not <br/>

social purposes, like shaking hands or grooming or watching sports together.<br/>

it and Joe walked through the room and said &quot;what are you watching&quot; right at<br/>

It took me a minute to remember. They are bonobo&#39;s. I think they rather look<br/>
more like chimps though than baboons. Very sexual. Female to male, male to<br/>
male, female to female, juveniles. They don&#39;t care and do it just to do it.<br/>
When they are happy and when they are nervous or tense. They just love to do<br/>
it. Which comes to mind the movie of History of the World Part I. You do it,<br/>
you know you do it, you love to do it!!!<br/>
