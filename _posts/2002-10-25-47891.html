&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Linda,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I caught that your daughter was an only child a few posts ago. Sorry, I <br/>
&gt; must <br/>
&gt; have missed that. And I think Joyce made the remark that maybe she want&#39;s <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; interact but doesn&#39;t know how to go about it. Also when you said that the <br/>
&gt; kids aren&#39;t quite as vocal and such as she is, maybe she does want to play <br/>
&gt; but just doesn&#39;t get the kind of response she&#39;s looking for. That mixed <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; boredom, again from not getting what she wants can add up to just kicking <br/>
&gt; someone out of frustration of it all. I can understand that. Maybe trying <br/>
&gt; some older kids would help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My Sierra happens to get along great with kids her age and older kids too <br/>
&gt; but just loves ones a bit younger than her. She has this mother thing she <br/>
&gt; does and plays really well with 4 and 5 year olds. My son and youngest <br/>
&gt; happen to like older kids more so but still get along great with kids the <br/>
&gt; same age or younger. It just seems like a preference they have right now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out in no time with all the great advice flying <br/>
&gt; around here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let us know how it goes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mary B<br/>
