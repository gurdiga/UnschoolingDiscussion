&lt;&lt;  Celebrating the Winter Solstice (Yule) is/was a pagan tradition. It <br/>
 involved, feasting, gift giving and bringing greenery into the house to <br/>
 celebrate the rebirth of the sun and son of the Goddess and the .<br/>
 beginning of the return of light. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Was told (by an avid SCA member) that the tradition of the tree dates from <br/>
the Druids....they would take a pine type of tree, strip down the branches to <br/>
spikes and spear the heads and body parts of their enemies upon it.<br/>
After the tree was &quot;decorated&quot; they would light it on fire, burn baby burn.<br/>
Lovely thought eh?<br/>
I&#39;d love to tell a bunch of Christians the origins of their &quot;Birthday&quot; <br/>
celebration.<br/>

Never heard it before in my life.  Sounds like macho fantasy to me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
