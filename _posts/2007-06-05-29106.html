<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361523971">Can you guys help me with this? I used to invite my nieces to visit <br/>
fairly often for overnights, weekends. They are younger than my kids -<br/>
- 11 and 9 -- and in school. Very schooly. &quot;Look how fast I read this <br/>
book, look how fast I do math on my computer&quot;, the little one even <br/>
calling my 13yo son &quot;dumb&quot; when he told her a different way to get a <br/>
multiplication answer. The schooly-ness disrupts the peace of our <br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
 The youngest was put on an ADD medication a few months ago. They <br/>
visited soon after she started the medication (straterra, an anti-<br/>
depressant given to ADD dxed kids)and was sleepy and listless for the <br/>
time that she was here. My mother, dropping her off and knowing how I <br/>
feel about drugging kids so that they will behave in school, didn&#39;t <br/>
tell me what the medication was, just that Kenzie had &quot;a pill to take <br/>
in the morning&quot; and she could take it herself, without my help.<br/>
<br/>
My niece is so thin these days. This is a side effect of this drug. I <br/>
haven&#39;t invited the girls over in several months now. I have a hard <br/>
time getting past my parents dropping the girls off, without telling <br/>
me first about the ADD drug. (These girls and their dad, my brother, <br/>
live with my parents.)<br/>
<br/>
What would you do? Hold your tongue about the medication and respect <br/>
their decision to medicate her? Tell my parents that we can&#39;t keep <br/>
the girls overnight anymore and why? Is it none of my business? <br/>
Is &quot;not in my home&quot; a high-horse attitude to take with my parents, <br/>
who are raising two young girls and could use some time to themselves <br/>
or to visit other grandkids out of state? I&#39;m really confused about <br/>
this.<br/>

<br/>
I think I would&#39;ve said &quot;Different isn&#39;t dumb,&quot; and talked to her  <br/>
about not bringing schoolishness to my house.<br/>
<br/>
As to the drugs, I&#39;d let that go.  Anti-depressants don&#39;t work like  <br/>
aspirin.  You don&#39;t take one or two when you&#39;re symptomatic (whatever  <br/>
the symptoms might be), you keep a steady flow to change brain  <br/>
chemistry.  Skipping a couple of days won&#39;t change those days (unless  <br/>
it&#39;s some kind of temporary fast-acting med I don&#39;t know anything  <br/>
about, which is possible).<br/>
<br/>
Just let them come over and have a break at your house.  Maybe talk  <br/>
to her about how she feels about the meds, if you want to help her  <br/>
feel soothed about it, but her dad gets to decide that.   Ostracizing  <br/>
her because of her dad&#39;s decision under school pressure (if it is)  <br/>
isn&#39;t very fair to her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Laura, That&#39;s a tough situation. I&#39;d try to separate which parts of<br/>
the problem I own and which I don&#39;t own, also what I have power to do<br/>
and not do, and the consequences thereof.  When the children are at<br/>
your house, you can speak to them about your beliefs and give them the<br/>
message of love that Barbara Coloroso talks about in Kids Are Worth<br/>
It, but it might not help them much until much later in life.  The<br/>
high-horse approach would have a somewhat predictable negative effect,<br/>
but there is no law that says you must have these people in your life.<br/>
 If it were me, I&#39;d discuss it with the children (yours and his) and<br/>
ask them how they would solve it. Please keep us posted. Best wishes,<br/>
Cynthia</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023797971">We had to work out how to handle a very similar situation with my<br/>
son&#39;s best friend, who moved a couple of hours away and comes to stay<br/>
with us for weeks at a time.  Over the years he has been medicated for<br/>
ADD and (more recently) depression, and always arrives with containers<br/>
 of meds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m horrified at what the adults in his life (single mom and school<br/>
authorities) want to put into this marvelously bright, creative kid. <br/>
I have been able to see what some of the meds to do him, and have had<br/>
conversations with his mother (who has many medical problems and has a<br/>
healthcare-related job) about what he takes and why.  In the end,<br/>
since he loves coming here and we love having him, that was the first<br/>
priority.  Here&#39;s what we do.<br/>
<br/>
First, I make sure I know what all the pills coming into our house<br/>
with him are. Sometimes they arrive in the wrong containers, with no<br/>
info, and I think THAT is dangerous.  I want to know about side<br/>
effects and symptoms.  Sometimes this means calling up the mother to<br/>
clarify, or looking them up on the internet if she&#39;s not sure (which<br/>
is amazing to me all by itself.)<br/>
   <br/>
If whatever meds he is currently on (they often change between visits)<br/>
 can be used &#39;as needed&#39;, I ask his mother if we could try NOT giving<br/>
them while he&#39;s here.  As time has gone by, she&#39;s agreed to this. We<br/>
let him know that if he feels he NEEDS to have that med he is free to<br/>
have it (this has only happened twice.)<br/>
<br/>
The depression meds and others which can&#39;t be safely stopped and<br/>
started just have to continue while he&#39;s here.  We try to make it no<br/>
big deal although he does have to be reminded to take them, which I<br/>
must admit is hard to do.<br/>
<br/>
As the boys have grown (they&#39;re now young teens) we&#39;ve been able to<br/>
talk about his school situation, and how he feels about the medicine.<br/>
 He knows we support his being who HE is, and that we love him that<br/>
way.  Being part of our unschooling life gives him a breather and<br/>
chance to see that there are other ways to learn and live.<br/>
<br/>
All we can give to other people&#39;s children, much as we care about<br/>
them, is our love and a chance to relax with folks who think they&#39;re<br/>
fine the way they are.  Sometimes we can help the parents -- I think<br/>
it&#39;s useful for his mother to know that we appreciate who he really<br/>
is, unlike their relatives, the school, and other people in his<br/>
strictly-controlled life who prefer a quiet, apparently compliant<br/>
robot. She can gets to see him through a different lens, too.<br/>
