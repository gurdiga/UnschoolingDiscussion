<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Buddha taught that all suffering is a result of attachment to impermanent<br/>
 </span></blockquote>things. Attachment to a salaried job sure fits the bill; so consider temping<br/>
for a more flexible, pleasant, and enlightened existence. &lt;&lt;<br/>

Dana is a long-time e-mail correspondent of mine.  He has a knack for<br/>
writing great articles loaded with lots of practical advice on how to<br/>
prevent career demands from robbing us of a healthy life of leisure.  This<br/>
guy has done his homework.  His arguments are always well-grounded.<br/>
<br/>
Why not introduce these concepts to our children as they explore various<br/>
career options?<br/>
