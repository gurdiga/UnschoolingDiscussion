&gt; In a perfect world..<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...a person should feel as good at 50 as he did at 17, and he would<br/>
&gt; actually be as smart at 50 as he thought he was at 17.<br/>
&gt; ...you could give away a baby bed without getting pregnant.<br/>
&gt; ...forget-me-nots would stimulate the memory.<br/>
&gt; ...doing what was good for you would be what you enjoyed doing the most.<br/>
&gt; ...pro baseball players would complain about teachers being paid contracts<br/>
&gt; worth millions of dollars.<br/>
&gt; ...people would always have good reasons to be optimistic.<br/>
&gt; ...you would never fumble, but if you did, you would recover the ball<br/>
&gt; yourself.<br/>
&gt; ...the mail would always be early, the check would always be in the mail,<br/>
&gt; and it would be written for more than you expected.<br/>
&gt; ...potato chips might have calories, but if you ate them with dip, the<br/>
&gt; calories would be neutralized.<br/>
&gt; ...if the guy from the government said to you, &quot;I&#39;m here to help,&quot; not<br/>
&gt; only would he mean it, but he would do it.<br/>
&gt; ...first impressions wouldn&#39;t count for nearly as much as ultimate<br/>
&gt; performance.<br/>
&gt; ...winning might be a nice thing, but that would be all.<br/>
&gt; ...all people would expect to be accepted.<br/>
&gt; ...every once in a while at least, a kid who always closed the door softly<br/>
&gt; would be told, &quot;Go back and slam the door.&quot;<br/>
&gt; ...highway patrolmen would never be around when you&#39;re running late, but<br/>
&gt; would always be at your side when a BMW blows past or a Mac truck won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get off your bumper.<br/>
&gt; ...the better food tasted, the less calories it would have.<br/>
&gt; ...warranties would be for 13 months and products would fail at 12.<br/>
&gt; ...more would be accomplished by governments when they spent more. </span></blockquote></div>
