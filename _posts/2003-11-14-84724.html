<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487900441">Okay here&#39;s my second question.<br/>
<br/>
Casey has a new best friend on the block (only for 3 months, since we <br/>
moved here). This little girl goes to a Core Knowlege school and <br/>
Casey sometimes helps her with her homework. &lt;g&gt; Casey mostly does <br/>
this to have more time to spend with her friend since she has <br/>
homework every night.<br/>
<br/>
So it turns out that this kid has been giving Casey some grief about <br/>
math, telling her she doesn&#39;t know ANY math since she&#39;s not familiar <br/>
with school-type problems. I&#39;ve coached Casey on this and pointed out <br/>
to her when she&#39;s doing some similar level problems in her head. She <br/>
says she understands that she knows the language of numbers and how <br/>
to work with them, but she hasn&#39;t been able to explain it to her <br/>
friend in a way the friend will accept.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a new problem, I know. It&#39;s just hard to hear my bright, <br/>
amazing child tell me she doesn&#39;t &quot;know math&quot; with a dejected look on <br/>
her face. I thought maybe she was asking for a little school math, <br/>
but that doesn&#39;t seem to be it. She just wants her friend to not <br/>
think she&#39;s dumb, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is, we were in Burger King the other day and Casey was <br/>
able to tell me, in a split second, that 2 $.99 toys would cost <br/>
$1.98. I took that opportunity to show her that she had just done <br/>
what the schools call double digit addition with decimals and <br/>
carrying. I wrote it out on a napkin and then she explained how she <br/>
got the answer in her head. She thought the paper way took to long. I <br/>
agreed, but also showed her sets of numbers that might be easier to <br/>
add on paper. <br/>
<br/>
She was interested, so we also went on to multiplication. She <br/>
completely got that it&#39;s a shortcut to adding. The other day we had a <br/>
similar experience with subtraction and division. So this kid gets <br/>
numbers. I KNOW that. Any ideas as to how I can help HER believe in <br/>
it and explain it to others?<br/>
<br/>

Mary,<br/>
I would love to know the answer to this question myself.  My poor <br/>
9yodd gets the same kind of BS from her school friends, made to <br/>
feel &quot;dumb&quot; because she doesn&#39;t do any work on paper to prove she <br/>
understands something.  <br/>
<br/>
One day the neighborhood kids were playing yard sale and put the 4th <br/>
grade boy (public school, who winds up in summer school each year) in <br/>
charge of the booth.  DD was upset that she wasn&#39;t chosen and asked <br/>
why.  The younger girls (one in 2nd grade, one repeating 1st grade, <br/>
both in private school) replied, &quot;Well, he&#39;s smart and in 4th <br/>
grade.&quot;  My dd&#39;s reply was, &quot;Well, so am I.&quot; And then there was the <br/>
argument, &quot;Well, OUR work is MUCH HARDER than YOURS.&quot; Nah-nah-nah.  <br/>
She came home in tears.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking to come to some kind of solution, I asked if she wanted <br/>
school work to be more like them.  Of course she said no, she just <br/>
wanted them to understand that she wasn&#39;t dumb just because she <br/>
didn&#39;t go to school like them and spend hours on homework.<br/>
<br/>
I think some of it is attitude from their parents that they are <br/>
reflecting so they can justify the expense of private school.  The <br/>
public school kids in the neighborhood don&#39;t have the same attitude.  <br/>
and my daughter is definitely more sensitive to the bias than my son.<br/>

dumb over the summer because she didn&#39;t go to school. Then when school <br/>
started, they got her to help with their homework . . . sigh. These are <br/>
kids who argued vehemently once that a century was ten years!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could put your heads together and find a bunch of things she <br/>
knows that they won&#39;t know. Then she could quiz them on those things when <br/>
the issue comes up.<br/>

We talked about that. Casey reads many more books than this girl and <br/>
could ask her all sorts of literature based questions. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to put her friend on the spot though with quizzes designed to <br/>
point out her lack of knowledge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632822181">Mary, I don&#39;t know what to say here, either, but that I understand <br/>
what your daughter is going through.  My daughter daily talks to a <br/>
girl from Georgia, a girl from Pennsylvania, a girl from California, <br/>
a girl from France and a boy from Canada via Instant Messenger and <br/>
sometimes on the phone (not the girl in France).  Last week my <br/>
schooled neice was talking to Erica via IM and she told Erica she had <br/>
to go because she has real friends and a real life.  Erica got mad at <br/>
her, but I know it hurt her that she doesn&#39;t have all these friends <br/>
in person every day.  These friends are probably much better friends <br/>
than most of the people Erica will ever meet in real life.  <br/>
<br/>
Schooled kids start out very young telling the kids younger than them <br/>
that they are dumb.  A kindergartener is smarter than kids who&#39;ve <br/>
never been to school, a first grader is smarter than a <br/>
kindergartener, a sixth grader is smarter than the whole school <br/>
(except for the other sixth graders).  Of course, the teacher is <br/>
smarter than all of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732084069">When it&#39;s been kids I knew, I just talked directly to the other kid, reminded <br/>
them of a thing or three my child COULD do better than they could, asked them <br/>
a few well-chosen questions about school and grades, and told them part of <br/>
the reason I don&#39;t send my kids to school is because kids at school are mean, <br/>
and I&#39;d like for them not to be mean to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
The last time it happened, I saved an account of it while it was fresh.  <br/>
There were four homeschoolers in a D&D game, but the night this happened my two <br/>
were there and the other two weren&#39;t.  It was the first time my kids were ever <br/>
&quot;graded&quot; by anyone else.  Pretty amusing!!   (They were old enough to laugh it <br/>
off by this time--it was within the past year.)  I was telling one of the <br/>
other homeschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:  Hey, you really missed something not being at Eric&#39;s game <br/>
Saturday!<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     uh oh... what happened?<br/>
SandraDodd:  They started a new game.  Post-apocalyptic fantasy from a new <br/>
book Eric has (a real game).<br/>
SandraDodd:  Instead of rolling stats, they voted real stats on each person <br/>
from 8 to 15.<br/>
SandraDodd:  I&#39;m glad I was awake when K & M got home because they poured out <br/>
the whole story.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Eric said &quot;I don&#39;t want to say anything about homeschooling <br/>
but...&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:  So on intelligence, he didn&#39;t want to give our guys much because <br/>
they were homeschooled and he said intelligence was how much chemistry and <br/>
stuff you knew.<br/>
SandraDodd:  !!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Kirby and Marty were amused by that.  I said &quot;That&#39;s knowledge.  <br/>
Intelligence is how easily you learn it.&quot; <br/>
SandraDodd:  They said &quot;Yeah, we know,&quot; all merrily.<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     lol<br/>
SandraDodd:  So Eric said they both had more common sense than the others in <br/>
that group.  (mostly his school crowd that night, Joe, Steve, Jared crowd, I <br/>
think, though Jeremy was there)<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     thats pretty funny<br/>
SandraDodd:  So I think even though Eric considers them <br/>
intelligence-impaired, that they got 13 (K) and 11 (M) for intelligence.  I think.<br/>
SandraDodd:  I had asked about charisma.  I said &quot;Did anyone get a 15 <br/>
charisma?&quot;  <br/>
SandraDodd:  Guess who<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     ummm.... <br/>
XRuaFalconX:     leaha?<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     or steve<br/>
SandraDodd:  Oh, and Eric wanted more strength than they voted him, but they <br/>
said he lost because of his bad knee and gave him a 9 or something low.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Kirby 15, Marty 13 charisma.<br/>
I was so amused.<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     lol!  <br/>
XRuaFalconX:     thats great<br/>
SandraDodd:  I tried to defend Eric because marching with a baritone takes <br/>
strength, but I guess marching with a  baritone isn&#39;t going to be a smooth move <br/>
to fight bad guys in this game.<br/>
XRuaFalconX:     i gues not lol</div>

<br/>
Good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Will had the same kind of scenario happen to him at the family reunion last <br/>
weekend.  All the second cousins quizzing him about multiplication (naturally). <br/>
 Will said told me he said he wasn&#39;t good at math.  yikes.  He was very <br/>
confused by their questions, but part of it was just particular-to-their teacher <br/>
talk that only someone in 4th grade at Redfield Elementary would know.  It took <br/>
us a week for him to fully explain what the problems were and what they were <br/>
saying.<br/>
<br/>
Today I pulled some pages about multiplication out of a Miquon workbooks that <br/>
I bought brand-new when he was a baby (this was before the evolution to <br/>
unschooling of even my middle child).  I put them on a clipboard with some pencils, <br/>
colored pencils and drawing pad, and put it in the car for our daily 1 hour <br/>
commute to whatever we&#39;re doing in town.  I showed them to him when we got to <br/>
the interstate.  By the time we got to the Children&#39;s Museum, he had worked a <br/>
couple of pages and was totally getting the concept of multiplication.  (I <br/>
think he knew it already, just not in schoolish terms.) <br/>
<br/>
We talked some.  I told him I was sad that he thought he was &quot;not good at <br/>
math&quot;.  I told him I thought maybe I hadn&#39;t been very good at making numbers and <br/>
math a part of his life like I had letters and reading.  I told him that he <br/>
used to lie in the back seat of the Explorer when he was really little and do <br/>
adding and subtracting on his fingers, and that I knew he knew how to do all the <br/>
math he needed to know for living day to day, and that multiplication was <br/>
just a shortcut for getting it done faster.  <br/>
<br/>
As we left the Children&#39;s Museum, he had said he couldn&#39;t wait to get in the <br/>
car to do more sheets.  (!)  And he said he liked doing math and *was* really <br/>
good at it after all.  After lunch he was asking if he could do &quot;science and <br/>
stuff like that&quot; in worksheets, and I did say I didn&#39;t think it would be as <br/>
much fun as doing math in worksheets, that science and other subjects are better <br/>
if you can actually *do* the science experiments or read the books or do Mad <br/>
Libs for learning parts of speech, etc.  Let&#39;s not get carried away here!  lol.<br/>
<br/>
I was mentioning this to a friend (before today), and she said to watch out <br/>
for the kids who quiz, because her daughter was taken in by the neighborhood <br/>
kids.  They weren&#39;t asking her *real* questions...just made-up false ones to <br/>
trip her up and make her feel bad about herself.  Beware of that.<br/>

too, many times, and she absolutely hates it. For her, it ruins the shared <br/>
activity (whatever it is) at which it happens. Lately there is a schooled girl in <br/>
her dance company who seems to use this technique as a last resort to sabotage <br/>
DD, especially when DD has been chosen for a solo or is chatting with the <br/>
older kids about musical theatre or literature. It seems to be the weapon of <br/>
choice, and in our experience at least, math factoids are the usual ammunition. JJ<br/>

Casey didn&#39;t get graded, but she did get some peer approval in the <br/>

steps. She counted. See, she *does* know math. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Remembering Nick and LaGina, neighbors at our old house, I had similar <br/>
conversations with both of them at different times:<br/>
<br/>
Do you always like school?<br/>
Are the kids ever mean to you?  <br/>
   (answer yes; then don&#39;t be mean to my kids since you know how it feels)<br/>
<br/>
Did you learn everything you know in school?  <br/>
Why do you think Marty/Holly wouldn&#39;t know these things?<br/>
<br/>
I knew they didn&#39;t like school.  They grew up to be juvenile delinquents (at <br/>
this point in their growing; they&#39;re +/- 16 & 18).   They had bully parents, <br/>
and they were budding bullies, and the best I could do was intimidation <br/>
(gently) and it worked.<br/>
<br/>
They wanted to play at our house, and so I set the conditions, privately and <br/>
not in front of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
They had the clear option to just stay away, but that&#39;s not what they wanted, <br/>
so we negotiated.<br/>

<br/>
And, that is one big reason why algebra is such a terrible ordeal and <br/>
makes people feel so dumb, like they&#39;re the only ones missing the <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
An algebra problem ought to be a whole mystery - an Agatha Christie at <br/>
her best!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
There is a mysterious situation that needs to be figured out. Someone <br/>
is murdered. In algebra, you have some sort of &quot;situation&quot; that needs <br/>
to be figured out. By &quot;situation&quot; I don&#39;t mean &quot;solve for X&quot; or <br/>
anything like that - I mean there is a REAL problem, something you can <br/>
describe in words.<br/>
<br/>
Evidence is gathered and processed and connections made and some <br/>
possibilities eliminated and some expanded upon. In algebra, this is <br/>
the process of figuring out what information is available, what is <br/>
relevant to use, what can be discarded, etc.<br/>
<br/>
All the evidence has to work together. In algebra this is the <br/>
equivalent of writing an equation or system of equations knowing they <br/>
all have to be true.<br/>
<br/>
The detectives work to figure out how all the evidence fits together. <br/>
They determine what it &quot;tells&quot; them - are there some suspects who can <br/>
be entirely ruled out? Can they narrow it down to just one? Is there <br/>
one more piece of information that would be critical in solving the <br/>
crime? In algebra, this is the stage of &quot;solving the equations.&quot; In <br/>
beginning algebra, this means &quot;solving for X&quot; - the answer narrows down <br/>
to just one number. Simple, open and shut case and the &quot;detective&quot; <br/>
knows who to arrest for the crime. In more complicated situations, <br/>
solving the equation might lead to two possible suspects being equally <br/>
likely. In algebra, this kind of situation gets described with certain <br/>
kinds of equations - quadratic equations are one kind that gives you <br/>
two possible solutions, for example. Really complicated situations <br/>
might never even be solved. Maybe some suspects are eliminated, but no <br/>
final culprit can be nailed for the crime. In algebra, we sometimes can <br/>
say only something like &quot;the solution is a number greater than zero,&quot; <br/>
or some other description that doesn&#39;t &quot;nail&quot; the anwer, but gives us <br/>
some information about it.<br/>
<br/>
Once the detective has used his skills to determine who the perpetrator <br/>
is, decision has to be made as to what to DO with that information. <br/>
What crime should he be charged with? How should the evidence be <br/>
presented to a jury? What sentence should be sought. In algebra, <br/>
finding the value of X is never the purpose. The purpose was to get <br/>
information to help us figure out that situation we started with, <br/>
remember? So, if you determined that the value of X must be greater <br/>
than zero or that X=15 or whatever the solution to the equation was, <br/>
you still have to figure out how that information helps you solve YOUR <br/>
mystery and what to do about it.<br/>
<br/>
In school, they do a VERY poor job of putting algebra into any kind of <br/>
context at all. A textbook might try to describe uses for algebra in <br/>
its opening chapter, but it quickly resorts to teaching all about how <br/>
to manipulate equations and find values for variables that mean nothing <br/>
because they are not grounded in an actual problem, mystery, situation.<br/>
