<div id="ygrps-yiv-135929134">Has anyone else read the book &quot;Wicked&quot;?  I think the author is Greg<br/>
Macguire and the story is about the &quot;wicked witch&quot; and her point of<br/>
view, the chain of events that led her to be what she was.  It&#39;s an<br/>
interesting take on the story.  <br/>
