<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346356985">Help! I have only been homeschooling for one year and I love it, but <br/>
now I am trying to unschool. I have a 6th grader and a 10th grader <br/>
who love the whole process. I would like to know what am I to do <br/>
about a diploma. If anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate <br/>
it. Thanks. John</div>

Then why did you feel the need to issue one?<br/>
I&#39;ve never been asked for mine ONE time in all my years of work. I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s a worry for homeschoolers at all, even less for unschoolers.<br/>
It sounds like HSLDA has gotten some of you up in arms over nothing....once <br/>
again.<br/>
Ask yourself why they always do this? That group thrives on &quot;sky is falling&quot; <br/>
messages.<br/>
Maybe do a little research on their methods and motivations before trying to <br/>
get this e-mail list all riled up.<br/>
They aren&#39;t unschool friendly I hope you all realize. They will not defend an <br/>
unschooler, they have downright shunned unschooling as a valid method of <br/>
learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804512537">This is in response to the discussion on whether or not someone needs a high<br/>
school diploma. The ONLY time I have ever been asked to show my diploma to<br/>
ANYone for ANY reason was the local school administration office here in<br/>
Clovis, NM when I renewed my homeschool paper work last year. They said they<br/>
needed to see my high school diploma, since the law requires that you be a<br/>
high school graduate in order to homeschool your kids in NM. I just told<br/>
them that it was at home somewhere, and I would bring it in later. But I<br/>
never brought it back in. It has been almost 25 years since I graduated from<br/>
high school and no one else has EVER asked to see it. I have no idea where<br/>
it even is. I haven&#39;t looked at it once since I got it.<br/>
