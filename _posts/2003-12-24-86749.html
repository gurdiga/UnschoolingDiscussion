<div id="ygrps-yiv-849415373">Yu-Gi-Oh is hugely strategic!   So much that I can&#39;t even wrap my brain<br/>
around it.  It has such variations going on all the time that it is soooo<br/>
challenging--different cards being drawn all the time so the scenerio is<br/>
always changing.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up, I played Stratego,  that&#39;s about all I can handle,<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  set the stage and deal with it.   With Yu-Gi-Oh, the stage is<br/>
constantly changing.   Tons of thinking going on to play that game.<br/>

&gt; &gt;roll and move, roll and move. I like strategy games. &lt;snip.<br/>

&gt; Pam, what are your favourite strategy games? My older sons (ages 11 and 8)<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like the roll and move games much but William (11) said he played<br/>
&gt; Risk and liked it. We have played Junior Labyrinth many many times.<br/>
