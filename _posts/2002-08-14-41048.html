&gt; is what motivates them to belong to HSLDA, or Promise Keepers, or any other <br/>

&gt; organization. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is true.......there are other groups as well......they will use the hell <br/>
thing...<br/>
They have even told me that if I didn&#39;t follow what a certain prophet did, <br/>
believe, and so and so...then I was going to hell...... I would not enter <br/>
heaven/paradise.<br/>
Even my prayers are not accepted because they are not said in a particular <br/>
language.<br/>
So, if I do not follow, believe in other things outside of the realm or do <br/>
things a certain way then I am condemned.<br/>
I know it is a control issue and it&#39;s so hard breaking away because you have <br/>
been conditioned and brainwashed for so long....... I have lost alot of <br/>
me....of who I was and who am suppose to be. BEcause of the assumilation, but <br/>
it is slowly being washed away, but it is taking ALOT of time. I was battling <br/>
the demons so to speak....on one side my spirit guides trying to guide me and <br/>
then the other side of religions trying to control me and my thoughts and <br/>
telling me that they are wrong. It was wrong to talk to your spirit <br/>
guides/ancestors.<br/>
I was hurt when I was told that I could no longer celebrate Kwanzaa....my <br/>
ethinicity was stripped. <br/>
It&#39;s all about control and I can admit that it works and I am fighting HARD <br/>
to be free.........<br/>
<br/>
Peace ALL<br/>
