<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The why question.  In my imagination, the conversation goes like this.  I <br/>
&gt; (finally) say to his grandma, or the moms I know from school, &quot;Well, we&#39;re <br/>
&gt; pulling Fisher out of school.  We&#39;re going to homeschool now, we&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; decided.&quot;  (Yes, <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t even begin with the U word. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And they say,  &quot;Really?  Why?&quot;  Or, &quot;I thought school was going well for <br/>
&gt; him?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Julian is the kind of kid who could probably go through school doing &gt;fine&lt; <br/>
... but the longer he was there, the more he loses his spark and love of <br/>
learning. I want more than FINE for him.&quot;<br/>
