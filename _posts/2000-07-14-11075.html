<div id="ygrps-yiv-386779433">Discovery Toys sells many of the Broderbund titles.  They are sold by <br/>
representatives, but have a website that you can go to.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks to all for math cd-rom suggestions recently... We got Mathquest with<br/>
&gt;Aladdin by Disney a couple days ago, and my 7yo boy really seems to enjoy<br/>
&gt;it. It&#39;s giving him good practice in adding and subtracting and has a lot <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;little logic games. Nice calm music too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Chumbo.com was out of stock on many of the titles that interested me,<br/>
&gt;though. Several of the titles were by a publisher called Broderbund, but<br/>
&gt;when I tried to get to their web site, I was directed to Mattel instead. I<br/>
&gt;suppose there&#39;s been a buyout or something. Even there many of the title<br/>
&gt;were out of stock.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anyone has any other good sources for educational CD-roms, I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt;interested!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Annette<br/>
