&gt;&gt; It can be, if their medical problems ARE all caused by control<br/>
&gt; issues and<br/>
&gt;&gt; the person in question is ready to hear that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Give me an example or two of a medical problem caused by a control<br/>
&gt; issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Constipation in children who were force potty trained is a common one --<br/>
often quite bad constipation, sometimes requiring (at that point) medical<br/>
intervention.<br/>
<br/>
Bladder infections in children in school denied the right to use the<br/>
bathroom as often as they need to.<br/>
<br/>
Those are two that spring immediately to mind.<br/>

   No one I knew when I was younger ate soy. It wasn&#39;t as popular(not the <br/>
right word but oh well). I got my period at 12 I have cousins who got theirs <br/>
at 11 and some friends. Also some girls were pretty well on their way to <br/>
developing even in grade school. My theory.........Milk and milk products. <br/>
They have been enhanced and contaminated w/ antibiotics for many many years <br/>
w/out the public really knowing. <br/>
<br/>
   Just my 2 cents.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; There was a sad story I read a few months ago about a boy in a school<br/>
&gt; where a mom brought chocolate cookies in for the class.  This was an<br/>
&gt; older boy, who knew to not eat peanuts.  He never imagined that there<br/>
&gt; would be peanut butter in what looked like plain chocolate cookies.<br/>
&gt; He ate a cookie and died. :(  There was another story around the same<br/>
&gt; time where a young boy was on a field trip and a chaperone gave him a<br/>
&gt; peanut butter cracker and he died.  :(<br/>

I KNEW there had to be an explanation.  I can work out 7 to 10 hours a week<br/>
doing heavy cardiopulmonary work, like kickboxing, and never drop below 140<br/>
and I&#39;m only 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;.<br/>

<br/>
Ulcers, constipation, headaches, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, depression,<br/>
generalized pain disorder, etc..<br/>
<br/>
All of these and many more CAN be caused by situational factors, such as<br/>
emotional stress.  Are they always caused by psychological factors? No.  Can<br/>
they be? Yes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355402344">Heart attacks, obesity, TMJ, miscarriages, infertility, the list goes on.<br/>
All can be.  Are they usually or even 50% of the time, I don&#39;t think so.  I<br/>
believe the old excuse &quot;it&#39;s all my parents&#39; fault&quot; has been over used and<br/>
abused.  IMHO it is all part of the blame game that is so popular--I was<br/>
abused, I&#39;m a minority, the bullies picked on me, I had a domineering<br/>
mother, I didn&#39;t have a father figure, I ate a twinkie, etc., etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about the only thing I agree with ol&#39; Dr. Phil on.  Too many excuses<br/>
and too many people not willing to accept responsibility for their own<br/>
lives.<br/>
