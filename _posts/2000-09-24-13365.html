<div id="ygrps-yiv-616218874">Vaccines Proven To Be Largest Cause of Insulin Dependent<br/>
Diabetes in Children Diabetics Advised to Seek Legal Counsel<br/>
Now, Before Their Right to Compensation Expires<br/>
Dr. J. Bart Classen, an immunologist at Classen Immunotherapies, presented<br/>
data on September 11 at the International Public Conference on Vaccination<br/>
which proved vaccines are the largest cause of Insulin Dependent Diabetes in<br/>
Children. His data indicated that vaccines cause approximately 80% of cases<br/>
of insulin dependent diabetes in children who have received multiple<br/>
vaccines starting after 2 month of life.<br/>
Dr. Classen presented data supporting a causal relationship between many<br/>
different vaccines and the development of insulin diabetes. His data<br/>
included the pertussis, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, hemophilus influenza<br/>
and others. The data indicated people with vaccine induced diabetes may not<br/>
develop the disease until 4 or more years after receiving a vaccine.<br/>
Lawyers attending the conference and who reviewed the data, advise diabetics<br/>
to seek legal counsel at once. The government provides compensation for<br/>
vaccine induced injuries however there is a statute of limitations. Insulin<br/>
dependent diabetes cost the patient about $1 million over their life time.<br/>
Dr. Classen&#39;s research has been published in numerous journals and featured<br/>
in national news reports. For the latest information on the effects of<br/>
vaccines on insulin dependent diabetes and other autoimmune diseases visit<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the deiciding factors for me in this issue, is that the nation of<br/>
Japan does not begin their cycle of vaccinations until the children are 2<br/>
years old. Given the population density of that island nation, if polio and<br/>
pertussis were not a problem for them, then why on earth are we placing<br/>
vaccines in the bodies of 2 month old babies?<br/>
<br/>
We know that the liver is not fully mature until age 8, so we are asking<br/>
immature livers to clean a system exposed to materials we know causes<br/>
diseases. It just never seemed logical to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392509200">There&#39;s one &#39;vaccine&#39; that I haven&#39;t seen mentioned yet, it&#39;s <br/>
natural and I don&#39;t know of any negative side-effects (at least for <br/>
the recipient!)  What is it?  Breastfeeding!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading with interest, our girls both had the regular (in the <br/>
UK) jabs, until recently, when we stopped.  Big fuss now about <br/>
this year&#39;s &#39;flu vaccine, being recommended for over 65&#39;s, was <br/>
over 70&#39;s or 75&#39;s last year...<br/>
