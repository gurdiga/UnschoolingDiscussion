&gt;<br/>
&gt; On one of my lists, a friend of mine got the LONG form for the census. She<br/>
&gt; posted wanting to know if she HAD to fill out the entire thing. I am<br/>
moving<br/>
&gt; to Kansas (Hi Bonnie!) in April, and wanted to know about writing that on<br/>
&gt; the form, too, so catch two ?? with one call. The following is what the<br/>
&gt; bureau said to do if you feel that you do NOT want to answer all the<br/>
&gt; questions. I do cherish my freedom and privacy, so I did this for me too.<br/>
&gt; Only one in a few hundred gets the long form.<br/>
&gt; Whatever you feel is something that you do not want to fill out write in<br/>
&gt; &quot;refuse&quot;, &quot;do not know&quot;, etc...<br/>
&gt; Make a notation that you feel this is something that you are not going to<br/>
&gt; answer.<br/>
&gt; If you fill out half of the form, they will accept it.<br/>
&gt; If you do not fill out half of the form, a census worker will come out to<br/>
&gt; you home...<br/>
&gt; She also said fill out as much as you want.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope that none of you go as beans as my friend is...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750629519">Actually, on the back of the letter was a statement in about 8 different<br/>
languages saying that if you need the census in another language, check the<br/>
box and send it in the enclosed, postage paid envelope.  (Having a friend<br/>
who is bi-lingual comes in handy every once in a while!).  So not quite as<br/>

The idea with the letter was to send it back if you needed a census form in a <br/>
foreign language.  There are a bunch of little paragraphs on the back to that <br/>
effect in various languages.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336583504">Everyone always complains that there aren&#39;t good statistics on the number of<br/>
homeschoolers in the US. It looks like the Census could have provided some<br/>
figures. Anyone else notice that on the long form (I have D2) you are asked<br/>
if the person attended &quot;regular school&quot; and the choices are:<br/>
No, has not attended<br/>
Yes, public school<br/>
Yes, private school<br/>
<br/>
In some states, homeschoolers are considered private schools, but in many<br/>
others they are not. Calls to the census help line just get me repeated<br/>
readings of the definitions and the suggestion that if it is not public<br/>
school or private school, then it must be no school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting for a response to my written request for clarification. Actually<br/>
I&#39;m sure &quot;Private school&quot; is the appropriate response - after all, what is<br/>
more private than a school for family members only? But I hope to make some<br/>
people think. Homeschooling doesn&#39;t exactly fall under &quot;supported and<br/>
controlled primarily by a religious organization or other private group&quot;<br/>
unless you want to consider the family a private group.<br/>

correspondence school should be counted only if credit for it can be<br/>
obtained in a &quot;regular school.&quot;<br/>
May be public, parochial (church-related), or other private. Attendance can<br/>
be either by day or night, full time or part time. A school does not have to<br/>
be graded to qualify as a &quot;regular&quot; school.<br/>
Do not include vocational, trade, or business schools.<br/>
<br/>
Mark the &quot;No, has not attended since February 1&quot; box for people who were not<br/>
enrolled in regular school. &quot;On-the-job-training&quot; is not school.<br/>
<br/>
Public School<br/>
A PUBLIC SCHOOL is any school which is controlled and supported primarily by<br/>
a local, county, state, or federal government. Mark the &quot;Yes, public school<br/>
or public college&quot; box for people who have attended a regular school or<br/>
college at any time from February 1, 2000 to April 1, 2000.<br/>
<br/>
Private School<br/>
A PRIVATE SCHOOL is a parochial or other private school which is supported<br/>
and controlled primarily by a religious organization or other private group.<br/>
Private schools may be religious or nonreligious elementary schools,<br/>
secondary schools, colleges, universities, professional schools, nursery<br/>
schools (including preschools and prekindergartens) or Montessori schools.<br/>
Mark the &quot;Yes, private school or private college&quot; box for people who have<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693004765">If you read my original post, then you may be interested in the response I<br/>
got from the census. First is the message I sent them followed by the<br/>
response I received:<br/>
<br/>
My message:<br/>
=================<br/>
I am hoping you can refer this to the correct department. Since there is no<br/>
e-mail address or form provided on the web page for submitting questions<br/>
that are not covered in the FAQ&#39;s, I am sending this to you as one of the<br/>
few e-mail addresses I could find on the site.<br/>
<br/>
On the question of school attendance, (form D2, question 8) it is clear that<br/>
our children attend &quot;regular school&quot; as they are in elementary school and<br/>
working towards a high school diploma (eventually, one is 3rd grade, the<br/>
other 6th). The problem is that the choices for regular school are &quot;public&quot;<br/>
or &quot;private&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are homeschooled (along with an estimated 1.5 million other<br/>
children in the US - the number is uncertain because many states do not<br/>
track the number of homeschoolers). This is definitely not public school,<br/>
but it also is not &quot;controlled and supported by a religious organization or<br/>
other private group&quot; unless our family is considered a private group.<br/>
<br/>
Several calls to the help line listed on the form did not provide an answer.<br/>
They seemed to lean towards &quot;No School&quot; if it wasn&#39;t public or private, but<br/>
basically just kept repeating the definitions of what the options were.<br/>
<br/>
Should homeschooling be considered private school or should we write in a<br/>
new choice?<br/>
<br/>
Billy Greer in Maryland<br/>
<br/>
=======================<br/>
Here is the explanation of the choices from your web site:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part A. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE<br/>
Regular School<br/>
Advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school<br/>
diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or<br/>
medicine) degree. Nursery school and kindergarten are included. Tutoring or<br/>
correspondence school should be counted only if credit for it can be<br/>
obtained in a &quot;regular school.&quot;<br/>
May be public, parochial (church-related), or other private. Attendance can<br/>
be either by day or night, full time or part time. A school does not have to<br/>
be graded to qualify as a &quot;regular&quot; school.<br/>
Do not include vocational, trade, or business schools.<br/>
<br/>
Mark the &quot;No, has not attended since February 1&quot; box for people who were not<br/>
enrolled in regular school. &quot;On-the-job-training&quot; is not school.<br/>
<br/>
Public School<br/>
A PUBLIC SCHOOL is any school which is controlled and supported primarily by<br/>
a local, county, state, or federal government. Mark the &quot;Yes, public school<br/>
or public college&quot; box for people who have attended a regular school or<br/>
college at any time from February 1, 2000 to April 1, 2000.<br/>
Private School<br/>
A PRIVATE SCHOOL is a parochial or other private school which is supported<br/>
and controlled primarily by a religious organization or other private group.<br/>
Private schools may be religious or nonreligious elementary schools,<br/>
secondary schools, colleges, universities, professional schools, nursery<br/>
schools (including preschools and prekindergartens) or Montessori schools.<br/>
Mark the &quot;Yes, private school or private college&quot; box for people who have<br/>
attended a regular school or college at any time from February 1, 2000 to<br/>
April 1, 2000.<br/>
<br/>
Do not assume that the name of the school indicates whether the school is<br/>
public or private. Also, payment of tuition at college does not indicate the<br/>
school is private.<br/>
============================================<br/>
<br/>
Now here is the response I got:<br/>
=================================<br/>
<br/>
This is a good one .... but the key to the answer is in the precise wording<br/>
of<br/>
the questionaire, eg ... has this person attended *regular* school .....<br/>
Apparently the mask behind No 8 is to identify those that are in, how can I<br/>
put<br/>
it, an institutionalized educational setting, ie either a public or private<br/>
school.   Those selecting the no answer are considered to be in some other<br/>
alternative setting.   The final tabulations for this table should give a<br/>
pretty<br/>
good idea on just what this number is, under the assumption that it is most<br/>
likely made of a majority in the homeschooling network.   By the way,<br/>
proceed to<br/>
No 9 and mark what you consider the equivilant grade level to be based on<br/>
your<br/>
judgement/experience.<br/>
================================<br/>
================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the reply I got, it does appear that the expected selection for<br/>
homeschoolers is to select that the child is NOT attending school in<br/>
question 8, but then to indicate the grade level in question 9. However, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if submitting the same question several times resulted<br/>
in different answers. I don&#39;t think homeschoolers were considered when the<br/>
question was formulated.<br/>
<br/>

I hope you&#39;re joking, but I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re not.  That is utterly despicable.  <br/>
It also highlights his/her ignorance of the law.  I hope he/she was made to <br/>

Kim-everyone in my house runs with scissors!is there a support group for <br/>
us all?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it meets directly following the group for folks who have put their eye <br/>
out while engaging in horseplay, and directly before the group for those who <br/>
swim less than an hour after eating.  LOL<br/>

We always send our paperwork certified, return receipt requested--that way<br/>
we&#39;ve got a signature that shows it&#39;s been received--would that work for you<br/>
in the future?<br/>

<br/>
we had been hand delivering and having them make a copy for their files while <br/>
i was there and i would take home the original. that seemed to work for 6 <br/>
yrs! then when they lost paperwork, they sent cps to my door. i showed the <br/>
investigator my copy and he thanked me but said once his office was called <br/>
into a matter, he had to investigate the children&#39;s sleeping and eating <br/>
areas!! i said i was not letting him in, and letters and phone calls went <br/>
back and forth, culminating in having the case declared &quot;unfounded.&quot; now i <br/>
hand deliver and have each page hand stamped received with the date on it. i <br/>
had a bad experience with return receipt once (the signature on it-usually <br/>
illegible-is not legal proof that the right party got your paperwork) but <br/>
that was not a h/s matter.<br/>
