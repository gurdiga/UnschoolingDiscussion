<div id="ygrps-yiv-105064385">I have made contact with a gentleman that has started a website that I think <br/>
you should all know about and definitely save to favorites!<br/>
He is the first person to start a web of information specifically for <br/>
unschoolers. It&#39;s amazing. He has created a map you can click on and get <br/>
information on support groups that are inclusive, non-political AND natural <br/>
learning oriented all over the WORLD.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a work in progress, so if you go there and don&#39;t see a group listed that <br/>
you know about, please forward it to him. It must be an inclusive/natural <br/>
learning support group.<br/>
He has ours listed and I did tell him about  Kelly and SOS.<br/>
<br/>
I am formally the U.S. contact person (yikes!) which is very exciting. I hope <br/>
he gets a lot of support and it becomes a wonderful resource for everyone.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Please check it out!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am looking for some unschooling support in PA as he has no contact <br/>
there yet.<br/>
He needs to refer a family that is searching for answers right now.<br/>
Anyone in PA? <br/>
