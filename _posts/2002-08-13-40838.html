<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386255441"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;New Topic:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;** unschooling ideas for historical interests of 9 yr. old boys.<br/>
&gt;Any ideas or stories are welcomed.  Thanks!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Has he expressed an interest in any particular time period or are you just <br/>
looking for some ideas and events to strew past him? My son has always had <br/>
an interest in history from the battles/weapons/wars point of view. These <br/>
are some of the things he&#39;s liked.<br/>
<br/>
*DK books are always great to check out of the library. We&#39;ve liked the ones <br/>
on Medieval times, weapons, gunships, battles, the Civil War, WWII, Native <br/>
peoples.<br/>
<br/>
*We&#39;ve done trips to Air Force Base Museums and retired battleships, plus <br/>
Natural History museums and Children&#39;s Museums.<br/>
<br/>
*The Dear America series of books are told journal style from the point of <br/>
view of boys in different time periods.<br/>
<br/>
*Movies and videos, whether specifically meant to portray a historical event <br/>
or not. Sometimes just seeing a different time period portrayed leads to <br/>
questions and answers.<br/>
<br/>
*Looking through our family stuff. We have old pictures, letters, newspaper <br/>
clippings, memoribilia from WWII, plus that ancient historical stuff from <br/>
when I was a girl. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I can think of right now. It really would depend on what time <br/>
period you&#39;re looking at too.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
