I just wanted to share that I too have a very spirited son.  I posted about <br/>
him recently, but wanted to let you know that as he&#39;s getting older, things are <br/>
changing for the better.  It was very tough for a while, we stopped going to <br/>
the library unless he was in the double stroller with the baby (he was 2 1/2 <br/>
then, she was an infant).  Now at 3 1/2 he&#39;s come a long way.<br/>
We had such a great day yesterday and I&#39;ll tell you about it!  We went to an <br/>
indoor skate rink that has &quot;wee tot&quot; days, they let the kids bring ride on <br/>
toys and have the rink.  They also have a HUGE indoor climber (like what they <br/>
usually have at chuck-e-cheese).  He played in there for 2 1/2 hours before his <br/>
sister and I were too exhausted to stay any longer.  I didn&#39;t have to stop him <br/>
at all from pushing anyone down, climbing anything he shouldn&#39;t, throwing <br/>
balls at anyone, etc.  He did such a good job, it was nice to be able to watch <br/>
from outside the ballpit, and not have to dive in to stop him from doing <br/>
something he shouldn&#39;t!  <br/>
Anyways, it was the first time that I&#39;ve actually gotten to enjoy watching <br/>
him have fun at a place like that.  We usually have to leave when he gets out of <br/>
control.  So,l just wanted to let you know, that it does get better.  He fit <br/>
right in with the kids a bit older than himself, and they ran around, chasing <br/>
each other and having a blast!   Well, he did throw himself down the fire-man <br/>
pole, but he&#39;d never done one of those before, and no one got hurt.<br/>
So, for now I would try to avoid places that don&#39;t work for or overstimulate <br/>
your daughter, and find fun things to do at home that use up energy, at least <br/>
it will be spring soon (I&#39;m in the Northeast.).<br/>
