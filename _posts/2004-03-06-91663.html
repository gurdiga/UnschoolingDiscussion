<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123908754">I was thinking a lot about this today.  How much do we influence our own realities by our expections, the expectations of others on us, etc?<br/>
<br/>
I expect my younger kids to get into things, make messes, be riotously (is that a word?) joyful at times.....and they are.<br/>
<br/>
It is just a given that my kids won&#39;t mess with our guns (stored safely with trigger locks by the way) and they simply don&#39;t, never have, not even once.<br/>
<br/>
I actively attempt to make it a given that people will be treated with respect.....and sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you watched Mad Mad House last night, Kelly expected not to fit in (overweight, lives in convent, announced she is a virgin) and she set up the situation to where she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know exactly how to phrase what I&#39;m thinking....but I have been thinking  &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175154818">I think we do quite a bit of that...<br/>
 <br/>
People keep asking me if I find it difficult with four children, three of them 3 and under...3 in diapers, etc. and all I can say is that I don&#39;t. <br/>
 <br/>
They ask the same in regards to homeschooling. Isn&#39;t it difficult? I&#39;m not patient enough? <br/>
 <br/>
Well...if you expect to have problems, then you&#39;ll find them. If you expect to do alright no matter what comes up, then you will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-421450486">I can relate Elizabeth - I have triplets (6) and a 9yo - people always say I<br/>
must have the patience of a saint or that I&#39;m nuts - sometimes both.    Most<br/>
of the triplet moms in my support group  say they couldn&#39;t IMAGINE<br/>
homeschooling their kids - and they only have the 3!  Many have  gone to the<br/>
ends of the earth to have the kids - then they push them off to kindergarten<br/>
at 5 so they can have 3 hours and 23 minutes &quot;to themselves&quot; and then have<br/>
them repeat Kindergarten the next yr bcz the kids can&#39;t keep up or &quot;fit in&quot;<br/>
at school!  It just kills me.  But at least the new moms coming in (with<br/>
babies or soon to be babes) here me talk abt the joy, fun and adventures I<br/>
have with my kids - and it&#39;s starting to make a few of them think a little<br/>
differently - hopefully it will last, for the kids sake!<br/>
