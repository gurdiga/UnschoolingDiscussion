<div id="ygrps-yiv-822051460">-=-My son has both eczema and asthma.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone claim <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that there are emotional factors involved with them.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s worth checking it out.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go to google.com and enter asthma and stress you&#39;ll get several <br/>
current studies--Helsinki, Australia, Scotland, U.S. (National Jewish-Med <br/>
Sci).  Two excerpts and then a comment:<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
Chronically-stressed children are far more likely to have asthma attacks than <br/>
less-stressed children, experts have found. <br/>
<br/>
The link between stressful lives and wheeziness could result from damage to <br/>
the immune system, they say. <br/>
<br/>
The research, carried out at the University of Helsinki in Finland, is <br/>
published in the Lancet medical journal. <br/>
<br/>
Stress has already been blamed in adults for contributing to heart disease <br/>
and even cancer and in children to appendicitis or rheumatoid arthritis. <br/>
<br/>
And even the children of excessively anxious parents have been found to be <br/>
more likely to develop asthma. <br/>
<br/>
The researchers followed a group of asthma 90 child patients in Glasgow, aged <br/>
between six and 13 for 18 months, noting when they had attacks, and finding <br/>
out about the stressful events in their lives. <br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
A small but growing body of evidence points to a relationship between <br/>
psychosocial stress and the early onset of asthma in children who have a <br/>
genetic predisposition to the disease. Specifically, clinical judgment of <br/>
&quot;early parenting difficulties&quot; has been found to be a significant predictor <br/>
for the development of asthma among genetically at-risk children. <br/>
<br/>
The W.T. Grant Foundation Asthma Risk Study was designed to prospectively <br/>
examine children who were considered to be at a genetically increased risk of <br/>
developing asthma. Since the longitudinal study began in 1985, researchers <br/>
have monitored both physiological and psychological factors among 150 <br/>
families with the intent of identifying risk factors for illness expression. <br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
Stress doesn&#39;t cause asthma from nothing, there&#39;s genetic pre-disposition and <br/>
often allergies make it worse, but stress clearly makes it worse, and I think <br/>
making a BIG deal about controlling (i.e. changing a child&#39;s life and <br/>
limiting it severely in honor of his asthma) is stress all in and of itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540937546">Yep -- a study confirming my own experience.  DH has asthma, and he <br/>
KNEW Seth would have asthma, just absolutely knew it.  He never <br/>
developed it, but I firmly believe if I had also &quot;known&quot; Seth would <br/>
develop asthma, he would have.  At an early check-up, the pede <br/>
thought she heard Seth wheezing a bit when he coughed, and she wanted <br/>
to prescribe steroids.  I took the course of waiting for the body to <br/>
tell us what it needed to heal, and gave him no medications.  He&#39;s <br/>
been absolutely fine and healthy since. (Nearly 3 years)  I believe <br/>
if I had panicked, given him the steroids, watched like a hawk for <br/>
wheezing, hovered, etc., my expectations of asthma would have been <br/>
realized.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68587371">How can you possibly know that your son doesn&#39;t have asthma just because you didn&#39;t want him to?  I didn&#39;t think that my son would have asthma (the eczema mostly comes from his dad&#39;s side), didn&#39;t give him the medication he was prescribed at 6 months because I had been warned by a nurse that given ventilin causes the lungs to depend on ventilin.  I didn&#39;t smoke, didn&#39;t expose him to smoke or other typical allergens, and live in a city that is very dry, has very low asthma rates.  None of this stopped my son from having asthma.  As it&#39;s been said, stress will exacerbate an attack (if my son has already been wheezing, and he gets in trouble, it will turn into a full blown attack), but the causes of both asthma and eczema are extremely complex. <br/>
