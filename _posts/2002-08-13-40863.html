&gt;&gt; For those who think it&#39;s no big deal to have homeschool laws making<br/>
&gt;&gt; us hand in things to schools, what would you do if you were a<br/>
&gt;&gt; complete, total unschooler who lives in PA?  At the end of the year,<br/>
&gt;&gt; you have to hand in a portfolio with samples of the student&#39;s work,<br/>
&gt;&gt; along with a letter from a qualified evaluator stating that progress<br/>
&gt;&gt; has been made.  If the school district doesn&#39;t like it they can<br/>
&gt;&gt; initiate due process and ask for a more proof that education has<br/>
&gt;&gt; occured.  So imagine you unschool and don&#39;t have workbook pages to<br/>
&gt;&gt; hand in.  You could hand in some brochures of places you&#39;ve been,<br/>
&gt;&gt; maybe photocopy a penpal letter your child writes, and if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt;&gt; luckky, you&#39;ll find a mathmania or puzzlemania book they&#39;ve done.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Keep in mind you&#39;ll be handing this portfolio in next to total school<br/>
&gt;&gt; at homers who will hand in thick scrapbooks filled with all kinds of<br/>
&gt;&gt; things that will impress school officials.  You&#39;ll also have to hand<br/>

There you have it -- why it&#39;s important to change the laws; why it&#39;s<br/>
important to let legislators (who are responsible for all the bad laws) know<br/>
just how bad the situation is for you; and why, sometimes, it becomes<br/>
necessary for someone to accept the role of, shall we say, &quot;public refuser&quot;<br/>
in order to make the point that the laws are bad. Some people set themselves<br/>
on fire.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, ours is a civil rights struggle, just like other ones. If we do<br/>
nothing, our situation will get worse. I guarantee it.<br/>
