<div id="ygrps-yiv-674985965">This is one of the things I don&#39;t really understand.  Is there any &quot;punishment&#39; in unschooling?  What do you do with a child who is consistently contrary?  Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e. &quot;Feed the dog&quot;?  Is talking to your child ever not enough?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it is because I have talked to my daughter, but I don&#39;t have many problems that I see others struggle with.  My daughter has always responded well to discussing what&#39;s going on, what she&#39;s doing, why, how it affects others, etc...  I&#39;ve always believed in &quot;discipline&quot; which is defined simply as guiding or leading.  (I know many use the term &quot;discipline&quot; to mean spanking, etc...)Yet... I have this lingering belief that &quot;punishment&quot; is not necessarily &quot;bad&quot;.  (punishment does not mean &quot;spanking&quot; only, but any type of correction like grounding, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t know if I quite &quot;get&quot; the idea from an unschoolers perspective.  I certainly don&#39;t know how to explain it to my satisfaction or in a way to explain to family/folks who are genuinely interested in &quot;getting&quot; unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
and... if I can put in a late question... What do you do with a child who is insitent on being the center of attention?  To the point that the child gets in your face if you are conversing with someone else.  It does not seem to matter quantity of time you spend with this child but as soon as you turn your attention away from this child, the child becomes immediately unruly, loud and gets right in your face.  The parents are at their wits ends.  What suggestions can be given?  Thank you.<br/>

Maybe that lingering belief is just the voice of your childhood in your head?  You&#39;ve seen that you don&#39;t need to punish your own daughter, so clearly you know it&#39;s not necessary to raise kind, happy child. <br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
and... if I can put in a late question... What do you do with a child who is insitent on being the center of attention?  To the point that the child gets in your face if you are conversing with someone else.

I would guess there&#39;s still some unmet need with that child.  Sure, the parents may be spending time in the same room with the child, but are they figuring out what his true needs for relationship are and how to meet them?  Is that time spent with the child, just time sharing space or time exploring the things that bring that child joy?  <br/>
<br/>
The child must be getting some reward for his behavior or he wouldn&#39;t continue doing it.  I&#39;d really try to find some way to give that child attention -- not just time -- that is his alone, in a consistent way always keeping the promise to be really with that child. <br/>
<br/>
In thinking about the idea that people are very happy to AP their infants and toddlers, but then drift away from it with older kids, it occurs to me that we recognize regression in a toddler or young child, as a sign that the child has an unmet need.  We then act accordingly, but we tend not to be as adept at seeing the same regression and clinginess in an older child -- we brand it rudeness or impatience, and don&#39;t honor their neediness.  I find I&#39;m guilty of it, too, with our 8yo -- he&#39;s always been very high needs, and sometimes I find myself thinking he should have outgrown this by now.  Then I remember it&#39;s a signal to me that he has an unmet need, not just a want but a real need he can&#39;t communicate to me in any other way.  That helps me to see he&#39;s really desperate and I can&#39;t ignore his desperation.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I&#39;ve rambled some -- I&#39;m on day two of serious neediness here -- but I&#39;d really try to see what the child&#39;s unmet need is.  Gotta go, Andy needs someone to help him settle down to sleep -- he (and I) were awake until 3 am last night. He was very keyed up a harrowing day yesterday and just still hasn&#39;t re-ordered himself.  I&#39;m beginning to fantasize about putting valium in his cocoa....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there any &quot;punishment&#39; in unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is just about not doing school.<br/>
<br/>
But some people start questioning their parenting practices once they &quot;get&quot;<br/>
unschooling. So extending the philosophy into parenting gets discussed.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s not something you want to do, then the discussion won&#39;t make any<br/>
sense to you. It will seem like a lot of energy put into situations that can<br/>
easily be solved with an order (and punishment if necessary).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do you do with a child who is consistently contrary?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you don&#39;t relate in a way where there are things to be contrary about,<br/>
then there isn&#39;t a reason to be contrary.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Feed the dog&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you tell your husband to go do the week&#39;s shopping every week and expect<br/>
him to do it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is talking to your child ever not enough?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would talking to him about it ever not be enough?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve always believed in &quot;discipline&quot; which is defined simply as guiding or<br/>
&gt; leading.  (I know many use the term &quot;discipline&quot; to mean spanking,<br/>
&gt; etc...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Regardless of how one defines words, we all need to understand what we&#39;re<br/>
talking about in order to talk about it! We need to be using words in the<br/>
same way in order to understand what each is saying.<br/>
<br/>
If I say I guide my daughter, that may call up a different image to you --<br/>
since you followed &quot;guiding&quot; with leading as one might a dog on a leash --<br/>
and you&#39;ll miss the point of what I&#39;m saying.<br/>
<br/>
I offere guidance but I&#39;m not trying to lead my daughter somewhere. I do<br/>
trust that she wants to live peacefully with others and, when she isn&#39;t, I<br/>
understand that it&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t have the skills and understanding<br/>
to figure out how to get what she wants without stepping on others.<br/>
<br/>
But your example was about chores. To understand how to put the unschooling<br/>
philosophy into practice in parenting, you need to see chores in a new way.<br/>
Accept ownership of the home. It&#39;s all yours as are the messes your child<br/>
creates since her messes are part of the decision to have a child. (Just as<br/>
litter boxes are part of the decision to have an indoor cat!)<br/>
<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t stop there! Ask for help. Ask as you would a friend and<br/>
accept that the answer can be no since you are asking someone to set aside<br/>
something that may be more important to them (even if it doesn&#39;t look<br/>
important to you) to do something that may be uninteresting to them for you.<br/>
And then appreciate the help they give, even if you think they could have<br/>
done more.<br/>
<br/>
Turn the situation around: If you had a friend who asked you to help -- but<br/>
wasn&#39;t really &quot;asking&quot; since she wouldn&#39;t treat no kindly -- and then<br/>
grumped at you because you weren&#39;t helping the way she wanted and then said<br/>
&quot;Thanks,&quot; when you were done but really meant &quot;It was the least you could<br/>
do,&quot; would you want to help that friend?<br/>
<br/>
But if your friend asked saying she understood you were busy but she was<br/>
really in a bind and could you help her out? And she appreciated whatever<br/>
you could do and thanked you sincerely at the end and offered lunch or to<br/>
take the kids for an afternoon (depending on how much she was asking) would<br/>
you want to help her again?<br/>
<br/>
So the question really isn&#39;t can you say &quot;Feed the dog.&quot; The question is is<br/>
that treatment of another part of the type of relationship you want to build<br/>
with your child? I wouldnt&#39; want my husband to treat me that way, so I<br/>
certainly wouldn&#39;t want to treat another person -- and kids are persons too!<br/>
-- that way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yet... I have this lingering belief that &quot;punishment&quot; is not<br/>
&gt; necessarily &quot;bad&quot;.  (punishment does not mean &quot;spanking&quot; only, but any type of<br/>
&gt; correction like grounding, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If your goal is to make your daughter conform to a certain behavior then<br/>
punishment is one tool many people use.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is a more joyful family life and great relationships, then<br/>
there are better tools.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons orders and punishment seem to work is that it makes<br/>
sense. The most direct path to getting what you want is to tell someone and<br/>
have them do it. Another reason is that it *looks* like it works. Compliant<br/>
kids will do what they&#39;re told because fighting for what they want isn&#39;t<br/>
worth it to them. That&#39;s conveninent for parents! But not a good character<br/>
quality for a child when she&#39;s with people who are less trustworthy than her<br/>
parents (a boyfriend? a pushy friend? an adult who seemed nice on the<br/>
surface?) and definitely not a useful character quality as an adult. Defiant<br/>
kids may also comply. But then they&#39;ll do what they want when parents aren&#39;t<br/>
looking. (We can&#39;t really control what they do. But we can create the<br/>
illusion that we can control them!)<br/>
<br/>
Punishment can raise great kids. It can also raise kids who want out of the<br/>
home as soon as possible and kids who are destructive and disrespectful. The<br/>
success of punishment based parenting depends on the child&#39;s personality and<br/>
the other ways the parent is relating to the child.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting based on respect doesn&#39;t depend on the child&#39;s personality and it<br/>
is the whole of how a parent relates to the child.<br/>
<br/>
So really it isn&#39;t the punishment that works. It&#39;s other factors outside the<br/>
punishment (the rest of the relationship and the personality.)<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is a sweetie and she&#39;s not punished. If decent kids can be<br/>
raised without punishment, then why chance punishment?<br/>

&gt; their wits ends.  What suggestions can be given?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old?<br/>
<br/>
What quality of time is spent with the child? Parents can be with a child<br/>
without really *being* with a child if you know what I mean. They can spend<br/>
the time with a child in a way that they think is what the child needs, but<br/>
aren&#39;t really listening to what the child says (in various ways) that he<br/>
needs.<br/>
<br/>
If the child says he needs attention, that&#39;s an honest message of what he&#39;s<br/>
feeling. The feelings aren&#39;t wrong and can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t be) changed. But<br/>
he can be helped to learn to set aside his needs for a bit so others can get<br/>
their needs met. My daughter understood when I said it was my turn to talk.<br/>
But to understand allowing others their turn, she needs her turn to be given<br/>
just as much respect. A needy 5 yo being asked to be away from mom for an<br/>
hour isn&#39;t a reasonable expectation of his skills.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting focuses on behavior and ways to modify it. Peaceful<br/>
(or mindful or respectful or relationship or unschooling or whatever one<br/>
wants to call it) parenting focuses on building relationships, trusting that<br/>
kids are doing the best they can with their skills and understanding of the<br/>
world. So problems aren&#39;t solved by finding ways to stop a behavior.<br/>
Problems are solved by tending to what&#39;s causing the behavior. What&#39;s<br/>
happening isn&#39;t as important as why. Behavior is an expression of needs. The<br/>
needs don&#39;t go away because the behavior goes away. The needs often get<br/>
expressed in other ways or turned inward.<br/>

<br/>
   Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e. &quot;Feed the dog&quot;? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ve finally gotten to the point where I ask and if the answer is no, I assume she&#39;s in the middle of something and go do it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My daughter gets like this at times. It&#39;s because I&#39;ve not spent enough time with her. My mom saw this behaviour and I told her I thought it was because I wasn&#39;t spending time with her and she said something along the lines of, &#39;Bull, you&#39;re around her all the time!&#39; Well yeah but I&#39;m around her doing housework, chasing the toddler, checking email, whatever. When I sit down and give her my undivided attention and read to her for an hour or put together a puzzle or snuggle up for a movie the neediness goes away. Another thought, what about just including the child in the conversation? If the daughter&#39;s behaviour is rude what about the parents who may be trying to exclude her from the conversation they&#39;re having with someone else.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is about how learning happens.<br/>
<br/>
Questions that suggest there are rules about what can and can&#39;t be done &quot;in <br/>
unschooling&quot; are indicators (to me) that the questioner is not thinking much <br/>
about principles vs. rules.<br/>

<br/>
What is being learned?  That&#39;s the question to ponder in any area in which <br/>
you&#39;re wanting to extend unschooling into the corners of your life.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t want to extend unschooling, and that&#39;s okay for them I <br/>
guess.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll have as good an experience as they could, but that <br/>
won&#39;t keep it from being unschooling.   It will keep them from moving away from <br/>
rules and toward principles, but that&#39;s not going to keep them from <br/>
unschooling.  A family with all their kids in school could live by principles and not <br/>
rules.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the crucial point.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a bunch of rules.  We have some expectations and <br/>
practicalities, like if someone takes the trash out they should replace the bag.  If they <br/>
use the last of the milk, they should get another gallon from the back fridge <br/>
(where we store quantities/extras of things).  But the way it works out is that <br/>
very often when one person sees another voluntarily taking out the trash, he <br/>
or she will get a bag and replace it kind of out of gratitude that the trash is <br/>
being taken out.  And with milk, if there are several people around when the <br/>
milk&#39;s about to empty out, one will say &quot;I&#39;ll go get milk,&quot; and regular <br/>
guest-kids know where it is, too.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no &quot;contrary&quot; involved.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s deal with us has been for years that we should know where he is, so <br/>
he will call or e-mail if he&#39;s going to be out all night.  He calls if he&#39;s <br/>
changing locations.   If he forgets (a time or two he has, but just forgetting, <br/>
not being sneaky or anything) that&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never wanted to &quot;ground&quot; any kids.  Much of their learning takes place <br/>
out and about.  And we&#39;ve never wanted to make their rooms a place to avoid or <br/>
resent.  And we don&#39;t want them to think staying home with the family is what <br/>
happens when you&#39;re bad. And because we&#39;ve been so supportive of and positive <br/>
with them there&#39;s rarely anything they do that anyone would consider &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-=-Can you tell your husband to go do the week&#39;s shopping every week and <br/>
expect<br/>
him to do it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have two grocery lists building at any moment, one for Costco (Keith&#39;s <br/>
shopping) and one for regulary grocery store (mine).   When one hits critical <br/>
mass or we&#39;re out of something, someone goes shopping.  I might ask him if he <br/>
could go soon, and he&#39;s glad to do that. Or if I need something quickly and it&#39;s <br/>
not a good day for him to go, I&#39;ll just go get it at the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the kids.  I ask them if it&#39;s a good time, or possible for them to <br/>
do something, if it&#39;s something I can&#39;t do and they can, or if I need help.    <br/>
Marty and Kirby are both taller than I am so I ask them to put things up on <br/>
high shelves and to change light bulbs.  They&#39;ve always been quite happy to do <br/>
it, but I have never *ever* commanded them to do it.  So they feel big, and <br/>
good, and helpful, and adult when they do it, not small and helpless and <br/>
put-upon.<br/>
<br/>
It ends up turning out that what we&#39;re talking about in all these cases isn&#39;t <br/>
nearly so much &quot;who does what&quot; as &quot;who feels how&quot;?<br/>
<br/>

That whole passage of Joyce&#39;s was wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting practices are largely left over from the days when psychology <br/>
either didn&#39;t exist or was regarded with great suspicion.   The feelings of the <br/>
individuals being compelled to perform the behaviors (in animal training terms) <br/>
were NOT foremost in many people&#39;s minds.  And as many of our culture&#39;s roots <br/>
go to England and Germany, especially as regards education and childrearing, <br/>
people were expected to stuff their own feelings and &quot;get over it&quot; (whatever <br/>
their phrase of the day was).   Subdue your appetites, overcome your emotions, <br/>
and get that trash out, the floor mopped, the dog fed, the sidewalk scrubbed.  <br/>
<br/>
Priorities.<br/>
<br/>
If a family&#39;s priorities do not include their child&#39;s feelings of wellbeing <br/>
and safety, then punishments are reasonable things to have.   If the house <br/>
outranks the children, then yes, what the heck?  Ground them in their rooms.  As <br/>
long as they do no damage to the structure, who cares?  They&#39;ll move out soon <br/>
and you&#39;ll have your house back.<br/>
<br/>
But if the children are a priority, many things will easily change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222794271">As far as the first part, no there isn&#39;t any<br/>
punishment. Lots of disciplining by your definition,<br/>
of leading/guiding. <br/>
<br/>
I have a child who is consistently contrary. I have<br/>
learned to gauge her moods closely and be careful how<br/>
I ask her to help out. We talk often about cooperation<br/>
and being a part of a community (in our case, living<br/>
in the family) and how everyone needs to help with<br/>
chores as well as the fun times. Giving her choices<br/>
also helps with her being more cooperative, as well as<br/>
just recognizing that she&#39;s alot like I am! <br/>
<br/>
As for a child who is constantly getting rowdy if not<br/>
attended to constantly, is the child old enough to be<br/>
held on the lap of the person and hugged so that it&#39;s<br/>
a little easier to understand that they aren&#39;t being<br/>
ignored? If the child is easier, then I&#39;m not quite<br/>
sure how to handle it because to be honest, we&#39;re<br/>
still working on not interrupting at times when<br/>
someone has asked that they not do so.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if that helps or not!<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know if it is because I have talked to my<br/>

&gt; &quot;punishment&quot; is not necessarily &quot;bad&quot;.  (punishment<br/>
&gt; does not mean &quot;spanking&quot; only, but any type of<br/>
&gt; correction like grounding, etc...)<br/>

&lt;&lt;But the way it works out is that very often when one person sees another<br/>
voluntarily taking out the trash, he<br/>
or she will get a bag and replace it kind of out of gratitude that the trash<br/>
is being taken out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband is in charge of the trash. And after 14 plus years, I still can&#39;t<br/>
get him to remember putting a new bag in when he&#39;s done. So most of the time<br/>
someone will throw something away without really looking and it ends up in<br/>
the bottom of a bagless container. So it took me long enough, but I finally<br/>
just took out all the trash bags from the box, dumped them in the bottom of<br/>
the trash can, and at least they are there and no one has to walk to where<br/>
the bags are kept. Of course my husband still forgets most times to get the<br/>
new one, but it&#39;s much more convenient for me. (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried time outs, but they just don&#39;t work on him. &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling means &quot;not schooling.&quot; Unschooling parents do not become <br/>
teachers and they don&#39;t hold school in their homes. It means children <br/>
are viewed as wanting to become competent and informed and productive <br/>
members of their society in the presence of supportive family and an <br/>
environment that allows experimentation and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in there about &quot;punishment.&quot; There are unschooling families <br/>
with chore lists and accompanying rewards or punishments for doing or <br/>
not doing the chores. There are unschooling families who use what my <br/>
friend calls &quot;cultural methods&quot; of responding to undesirable behaviors <br/>
in their children. He means they spank, yell, isolate, shame, and take <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
However, unschooling always involves trust in children - in fact, <br/>
trusting them to know, ultimately, what to learn, how to learn, when to <br/>
learn anything and everything. Parents offer information and <br/>
experiences. Parents offer guidance. Parents offer help. But <br/>
unschooling parents don&#39;t offer to think &quot;for&quot; their children. All this <br/>
trusting children to think and choose when, what, and how to learn, for <br/>
themselves, tends to be extended, over time, into all areas of life, <br/>
including things like chores and behavior, and is not limited to just <br/>
conventional school subject areas.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have adopted a belief that children naturally want to <br/>
become part of the full society, in their own way, of course. <br/>
Punishment tends to just fade from existence in the unschooling family <br/>
because parents get into the habit of being &quot;helpers&quot; and of trying to <br/>
understand what their kids&#39; motivations are for what they are doing. <br/>
When parents understand motivation and are in the habit of looking for <br/>
ways to help - they eventually stop seeing punishment as useful. <br/>
Instead, their focus become trying to help the child clarify and <br/>
achieve his or her real goals. This is just turning the same attitude <br/>
and approach we have, as unschoolers, on &quot;learning,&quot; onto other kinds <br/>
of learning (learning to be courteous, learning when to be quiet, <br/>
learning to clean up after oneself, learning to share, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
In practice, if you observed a hundred unschooling families, you&#39;d see <br/>
a wide variation in how parents and children interact. We have <br/>
different personalities and we have different capabilities and <br/>
different life situations. Some have chosen to &quot;unschool&quot; in the most <br/>
narrow sense of the word - these families see that children don&#39;t need <br/>
schoolwork in order to learn.  Instead, they provide lots of <br/>
interesting experiences and they pay attention to what catches the <br/>
child&#39;s interest and they follow up on those experiences in ways that <br/>
they&#39;ve observed are useful to the child. For example, they might go to <br/>
an arboretum as a family outing. They notice that their son really <br/>
likes the carnivorous plants. When they go through the arboretum shop - <br/>
there are some small carnivorous plants for sale - so they buy one to <br/>
take home. They parent looks up carnivorous plants on the internet and <br/>
shares some of what she learned, with her son. He asks, &quot;Wow, how did <br/>
you find that out?&quot; She shows him how to use Google. He thinks of other <br/>
things he could look up. Decides to look up &quot;Robot&quot; and finds a listing <br/>
for &quot;I, Robot,&quot; by Isaac Asimov. He says, &quot;I didn&#39;t know that was a <br/>
book - I just thought it was a movie.&quot; Next time they go to the <br/>
library, mom finds &quot;I, Robot&quot; and he reads it and loves it and wants to <br/>
read more of Isaac Asimov&#39;s books. Mom also finds a book about Isaac <br/>
Asimov. She doesn&#39;t think her son will want to read the whole book - <br/>
but she reads it and shares tidbits with him that she thinks are <br/>
interesting.  And so on.... Sounds like an unschooler, right?<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, this could be a family with punishments for <br/>
misbehavior, with chore charts and bedtimes and 1 hour per day limits <br/>
on tv or video games and so on. But, over time, they&#39;re likely to <br/>
change that as they come to trust their children more and more.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think these other parenting issues are &quot;part and parcel&quot; of <br/>
unschooling. But they tend to often be natural outgrowths of <br/>
unschooling. And examining them and analyzing what sense they make for <br/>
our own famlies, questioning our own parenting choices, can help us <br/>
create the kind of family life that is most conducive to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;To parents I say, above all else, don&#39;t let your home become some <br/>
terrible miniature copy of the school.  No  lesson plans!  No quizzes!  <br/>
No tests!  No report cards! Even leaving your kids alone would be <br/>
better; at least they could figure out some things on their own.  Live <br/>
together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as much as you can.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-302269995">&lt;&lt;&lt;Can you &quot;tell&quot; your child to do something and expect them to - i.e. &quot;Feed<br/>
the dog&quot;?  Is talking to your child ever not enough?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do not expect unthinking obedience from Jayn. It is not something I value,<br/>
and believe me I don&#39;t get it. ;) If something is important or about safety,<br/>
I say why I am asking her. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to throw out the idea that talking to your child is *never* enough<br/>
- that you have to model in your actions and interactions the kind of<br/>
qualities and principles you expect/hope your children will emulate.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I just don&#39;t know if I quite &quot;get&quot; the idea from an unschoolers<br/>
perspective.  I certainly don&#39;t know how to explain it to my satisfaction or<br/>
in a way to explain to family/folks who are genuinely interested in<br/>
&quot;getting&quot; unschooling.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t get it, it may be tough to explain to others, although<br/>
sometimes verbalizing is a path to clarity. Being pedantic for a moment,<br/>
there is not any single unschooler&#39;s perspective - but the accumulated<br/>
experience and wisdom of many. Sometimes unschooling is easier to grasp and<br/>
explain to family in terms of what it is *not*.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and... if I can put in a late question... What do you do with a child<br/>
who is insitent on being the center of attention?  To the point that the<br/>
child gets in your face if you are conversing with someone else.  It does<br/>
not seem to matter quantity of time you spend with this child but as soon as<br/>
you turn your attention away from this child, the child becomes immediately<br/>
unruly, loud and gets right in your face.  The parents are at their wits<br/>
ends.  What suggestions can be given?  Thank you.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You have had several helpful responses to this. To be honest I am always<br/>
reluctant to make suggestions to third parties like this. You say &quot;the<br/>
parents&quot; so it is not you, your child, with your personal and intimate<br/>
knowledge of the whole story. That makes it harder to help. Are they<br/>
unschoolers? <br/>

some discussions lately about parenting and unschooling/homeschooling that have <br/>
rather dismayed me... I had thought we were on the same page in these areas, <br/>
but our discussions lately have made it seem like we might not even be on the <br/>
same chapter. I read this post to him and it helped us open a dialogue that <br/>
was open and if not an equal exchange, at least hopeful and a distinct lack of <br/>
negativity! :~) Hopefully, this will keep our conversations going in the right <br/>
direction from here on in-but this post helped us get moving that way! Thanks <br/>
so much!<br/>

  hear my mother&#39;s voice in my head.  It sounds like<br/>
  this:  When I was a child I would tell her (inform her<br/>
  is more like it) that I didn&#39;t like being ordered<br/>
  around and treated like I had no feelings or choices<br/>
  and just do what the adult said because it was<br/>
  convenient for the adult.  She would say there is a<br/>
  lot of things in life people don&#39;t like and I better<br/>
  get used to it.  When a person gets a job, their boss<br/>
  will tell them what to do and they have to do whether<br/>
  they like it or not or get fired.  The IRS tells you<br/>
  you have to pay taxes, creditors tell you you have to<br/>
  pay bills, the government makes laws you have to obey<br/>
  or go to jail, etc etc.  Basically this was her<br/>
  negative take on life and I needed to understand what<br/>
  the &quot;real world&quot; was like for adults.<br/>
<br/>
