<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469398732">Just wanted to thank everyone who made suggestions for non-<br/>
competitive games!  They were all VERY helpful!<br/>
<br/>
I especially like the suggestion (can&#39;t remember who it came from) of <br/>
turning ordinary games into non-competitive games by changing the <br/>
rules!  I have a ton of games, and my husband made the same <br/>
suggestion:)<br/>
<br/>
Also the book (Everybody Wins!)recommendation!  It sounds wonderful!  <br/>
Right up my alley!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch!<br/>

p.s. so glad I found this site!</div>
