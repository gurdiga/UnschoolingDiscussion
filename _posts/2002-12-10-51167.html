NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Poet and painter Stan Rice, the husband of novelist Anne<br/>
Rice, has died at age 60.<br/>
<br/>
He died Monday of brain cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Born in Dallas, Rice met his future wife in a high school journalism class.<br/>
<br/>
They married in 1961 and enrolled at San Francisco State University, where<br/>
he went on to become assistant director of the Poetry Center and later<br/>
headed the creative writing department.<br/>
<br/>
In 1988, the couple moved to New Orleans, where Rice eventually opened the<br/>
Stan Rice Gallery.<br/>
<br/>
In ``Prism of the Night,&#39;&#39; a 1992 biography of Anne Rice, she said of her<br/>
husband: ``He&#39;s a model to me of a man who doesn&#39;t look to heaven or hell to<br/>
justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is<br/>
admirable. Very early on he said to me, &#39;What more could you ask for than<br/>
life itself?&#39;&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Victoria Wilson of the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf, who edits Anne<br/>
Rice&#39;s novels and worked with Rice on his 1997 book, ``Paintings,&#39;&#39; said<br/>
Rice refused to sell his artworks.<br/>
<br/>
``The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a<br/>
painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet,&#39;&#39; Wilson said.<br/>
<br/>
Rice&#39;s seven poetry collections attracted numerous honors, including the<br/>
Edgar Allan Poe Award of the Academy of American Poets, the Joseph Henry<br/>
Jackson Award and a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the<br/>
Arts.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to his wife, survivors include his son, Christopher, as well as<br/>
his mother, a brother and two sisters.</div>
