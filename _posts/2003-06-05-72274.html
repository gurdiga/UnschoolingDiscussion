<div id="ygrps-yiv-346562401">For those who remember my question about my friend&#39;s son, Kai, and his teacher&#39;s concern over handedness, I have an update.<br/>
<br/>
Lindsay called me two days ago and was upset because she had gotten another note from the school.  Kai had gotten angry with the teacher and called her &quot;stupid&quot;.  My inner voice was agreeing with Kai but I didn&#39;t verbalize this.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short I basically laid it on the line for her.  I asked her, &quot;How &#39;serious&#39; would this behavior be if he wasn&#39;t in school and being judged by &#39;classroom acceptability&#39;&quot;?  She agreed that it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as big a deal.  I told her that Kai&#39;s main problem is that he needs to be home with her.<br/>
<br/>
Today she told me that they are keeping him home now.  They finally understood how miserable he is.  Woohoo!  Now, to buy them some John Holt books so they can drop the idea of &quot;school at home&quot; too.<br/>

WONDERFUL!<br/>
<br/>
Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt books take a while, though.  Maybe some back issues of HEM would <br/>
help!<br/>

I highly suggest again The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith. A very<br/>
good book and an easy read for someone who wants to pick and choose through<br/>
the book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987880322">Good idea.  Lindsay is fond of books, especially on parenting so I may give<br/>
her one Holt book along with a few HEM&#39;s.  Of course a &quot;Certificate Of<br/>
Empowerment&quot; and a couple of your articles would be good. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just so relieved for Kai, he&#39;s Jonathan&#39;s best bud and they are alike in<br/>
so many ways.  I try not to even think about what school would do to Sir J,<br/>
now I can watch Kai regain his confidence and peace.<br/>

I&#39;m glad you&#39;re there to pervade her mind with thoughts of unschooling...very <br/>
cool.<br/>
<br/>
And I have a babsy boy named Jalen Kai. Did she know it means Ocean in the <br/>
Hawaiian language?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873161967">She probably does, she and her dh love the ocean, they were married on the<br/>
beach.  But I will tell her, just in case.  I like the name a lot and<br/>
&quot;Jonathan & Kai&quot; seems to just roll off the toungue.<br/>
