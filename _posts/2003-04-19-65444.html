<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658060014">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading the posts about Ritalin with interest.I have a 14 year old on effexor and has been for about 4 months.<br/>
Given a lot of thought to whether I just am not accepting her for who she is. Guilt and sadness that we have felt the need to go to antidepressants. I lived with the difficulties for 14 years and finally it got to be to much for her also. She has been hypersensitive since one week old. Cried so much that by 4 months old she popped both ovaries through her abdominal walls.Could never find a way to comfort her. She seemed to always be in pain. She still can only handle so much of any people sensory environments then becomes extremely irritable.  and overwhelmed<br/>
<br/>
We tried to control things and in the last years instead have focussed on helping her to express her needs less verbally abusively and to find ways to cope or remove herself. She is very good at knowing her limits now.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway one point I would like to make is that I believe kindness, respect and freedom  has allowed us to find a way to live with her in a mostly peaceful way. I know others with &quot;bipolar&quot; whose children are violent and much more traumatised and I wonder what this child would look like if I had taken the tough love route. All these mothers regret that they took that route and they believe their children are sicker for it.<br/>
<br/>
It has been a trying experience to live with this high need individual and meet the needs of the other three siblings in a respectful noncontrolling way. and I believe it is imperative not to judge another because we truly have not lived in their world.<br/>

<br/>
My son Conor has been taking Prozac for over 1 year now. He&#39;s almost <br/>
14. Have you been seeing good results for your daughter?<br/>
<br/>

antidepressants.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the medications are needed. I more than anyone else <br/>
understand that. Guilt is definitely not needed here. Do you feel <br/>
you&#39;re making the best decision for your child in this moment? Does <br/>
*she* seem to be helped? If you get more information down the road <br/>
that maybe helps you make a different decsion, does that negate the <br/>
fact that you are *in this moment* doing what you think is right? If <br/>
you alter your path later, then just go down the new path and leave <br/>
the old decisions behind. Leave the guilt behind too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I lived with the difficulties for 14 years and finally it got to be <br/>

<br/>
For Conor it was a profound clinical depression. As a sort of happy <br/>
side effect, a lot of the sensitivities went away also. This was a <br/>
problem coping in his life. Doing day to day activities and <br/>
functioning as a human being. I think that&#39;s different than a <br/>
difficulty in how he&#39;s learning something. Although I can understand <br/>
how that difficulty would affect someone&#39;s outlook and sef image. And <br/>
it&#39;s not that one is right and the other wrong. But I still wonder <br/>
about how much we, as a society, have created the idea of there being <br/>
only one way to learn and therefore everyone else is in need of help.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wow. My Casey is extremely sensitive and was hard to calm as a baby, <br/>
but not to that physical result. How traumatizing for all of you!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; She still can only handle so much of any people sensory <br/>

<br/>
Now THIS describes my Casey. We have to be very aware of our <br/>
surroundings with her.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s great. Have you looked into any of the information about <br/>
Sensory Integration? The OT explained to me that the idea was to help <br/>
these kids integrate and get centered from the inside out. That way <br/>
they don&#39;t have to work so hard to control the behaviors once they&#39;re <br/>
already out of whack.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I so agree!<br/>

<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t think I was judging Glena for giving her son ritalin <br/>
because that was not my intent. I understand that there are true <br/>
mental/chemical imbalances that are greatly helped with modern <br/>
medical intervention. I understand that. Really. Personally.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358437">Ahh Thanks. Yes she is. &lt;g&gt; I guess in that was I am a visual learner. Photos some how help me internalize information. Maybe in this case, I feel more like a &quot;know&quot; a person and can better relate to their experiences.Tracy<br/>
