 </span></blockquote>The rest of his life. Honest. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what we do. Taking into account, of course, the needs of the other<br/>
family members, but that&#39;s not generally much of a problem for us, and<br/>
how much Rain watches TV or plays computer games is only a problem for me<br/>
if I want to use the computer or watch a different show... and we work<br/>
that out.<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, while they&#39;re decompressing, it seems that kids often<br/>
do whatever they did to try to relax when they were in school for lots<br/>
and lots of hours... it almost seems like they&#39;re making up for all the<br/>
time they needed it and couldn&#39;t do it. I have a friend who is 15 and<br/>
started unschooling at 13, and she&#39;s just recently started to spend time<br/>
exploring some old and new passions (photography, beading). Before that<br/>
she chatted on email a lot, and had that sort of antsy-unhappy feeling,<br/>
like she wanted to do something but didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to<br/>
do, and it made her nervous.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Rain performed in a community thetater production of Carousel and<br/>
a homeschool group play about the Gold Rush. She was so tired afterwards<br/>
(we&#39;ve been getting home after 1 every morning for a week because of<br/>
Carousel) that she fell asleep in the car and then slept for a couple<br/>
more hours in my bed. Then she woke up and watched the end of The<br/>
Practice with me, and now she&#39;s listening to a Jim Weiss tape of King<br/>
Arthur while she fixes the playmobil setup that her cat knocked over this<br/>
morning. She also spend quite a while snuggling with me and petting our<br/>
new dog (who seems to be getting more comfortable with us, and appeared<br/>
to be glad we decided to spend an evening at home for a change).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not been a typical day, but then I don&#39;t think we actually have any<br/>
typical days. She did absolutely no reading, writing, or math, as far as<br/>
I know (except for things like counting beats in the music for the dance<br/>
she did, and I think she played some card game in the dressing room with<br/>
a couple of other girls). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. But read the message boards at Unschooling.com so you can get a feel<br/>
for what unschooling is rather than what it isn&#39;t. You&#39;re filtering<br/>
unschooling through what you are certain learning looks like and unschooling<br/>
will come up short.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sort of like having always eaten at restaurants all your life and then<br/>
someone telling you about the concept of cooking for yourself. At first<br/>
you&#39;d see only the things you can&#39;t have: You mean no one will provide me<br/>
with a list of dinners to choose from? You mean no one will bring it to my<br/>
table? You mean I&#39;d have to figure out what stuff goes into a dinner on the<br/>
menu and figure out how to make it look and taste like what a waiter would<br/>
bring me?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a great deal more than academic learning. Unschooling gives<br/>
kids the freedom to explore who they are, and find the things they love.<br/>
Right now, though, he needs time to recover from being told what, when and<br/>
how to do what others say is important. He needs to rediscover and trust<br/>
what he thinks is important. But he needs to recover first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a folder on the message boards at Unschooling.com for Reluctant<br/>
Family Members (or something like that). There are many discussions of<br/>
reluctant husbands.<br/>
<br/>
But of course you need to figure out what unschooling is yourself ;-) You<br/>
can help him along as you&#39;re exploring by sending him posts and articles<br/>
that really strike you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376124223">The easiest way I&#39;ve found to explain it is that you should just treat your son like any other adult member of the family - no rules, limits, or should do&#39;s. You don&#39;t have to have these things to do what needs to be done, and your son won&#39;t either. <br/>
<br/>
You sometimes spend a day or two working on one thing mostly, don&#39;t you? A craft, reading, or a hobby. Your son will be the same way, but it will take him longer to get used to having the freedom to do whatever he chooses, so he will likely spend weeks instead of days doing something at first. I compare it to getting a new bread machine - for a week or two, you make bread every single day, try out the new recipies, and enjoy it. Then, you put it in a cabinet, and only make bread when you really get to wanting some. TV/video games will be the same way for your son. Once he gets over that &quot;new&quot; freedom to watch/play whenever he wants, he&#39;ll get to where he only does it when he needs or wants something from it. If he chooses to keep playing games after that period, then he&#39;s getting something he needs from the games. I explained it to my DH this way - what do you most want, to control your kids or to teach them self-control and self-motivation and self-confidence? IMO, a year of letting your child just &quot;be&quot; and learn himself is worth far more than any year of learning at any school you can find. After that, things will smooth out as he learns things about himself, and the learning will never stop, for the rest of his lifetime. Unlike the school mentality that learning stops after the age of 18, or 22. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146548676">Hi Friends,<br/>
<br/>
  a couple of thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
I love the cooking analogy! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> On Monday, November 11, 2002, at 07:00  AM, Fetteroll wrote:<br/>

&gt; would<br/>
&gt; bring me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To illustrate this point, about discovering what they love and pursuing <br/>
it, 12 yo dd was in a community theatre production of the Wizard of Oz <br/>
last weekend. I was a backstage mother (munchkin mama :-)  and I asked <br/>
some of the kids what their favorite subject was. I had trouble getting <br/>
answers beyond &quot;recess&quot; and &quot;lunch&quot;. When dd was getting her makeup put <br/>
on, the adult who was doing it asked her what her favorite subjects <br/>
were. She replied &quot;fine arts and science&quot;. She said he was so startled <br/>
by her response, he didn&#39;t say anything else. She was rather perplexed <br/>
as to his response. While I have a science background, my interests were <br/>
always in sports and outdoors and I was an athlete and coach. Hubby was <br/>
sports too, and was a sports journalist for awhile. The fine arts <br/>
interest is all hers, and she pursues it with a passion. Something she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get in middle school much, and would only have time to pursue <br/>
part-time, when it fit in if she went to school. When she has late play <br/>
rehearsals, she sleeps late. The school kids were exhausted by the end <br/>
of the play. She knows so much science - her interests include mammals <br/>
and ecology - and we don&#39;t do any formal science at all. She picks it up <br/>
on her own - books, television, websites, outdoors, projects, local <br/>
environmental organizations - in other words, real life - the same way <br/>
you or I would learn about or get involved in something that interested <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is a great deal more than academic learning. Unschooling <br/>
&gt; gives<br/>
&gt; kids the freedom to explore who they are, and find the things they love.<br/>
&gt; Right now, though, he needs time to recover from being told what, when <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; how to do what others say is important. He needs to rediscover and trust<br/>
&gt; what he thinks is important. But he needs to recover first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t everyone need to discover and trust what they think is <br/>
important? What a great gift to be allowed to do this as a young person, <br/>
in an environment of safety and love.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

I&#39;ve gotten so frustrated at times that I&#39;ve started<br/>

I have two daughters ages 5 and 8<br/>
 (also a baby boy 6 months).<br/>
I&#39;ll just use tv as an example.<br/>
My 5 yr old wanted to watch alot of tv<br/>
(I know it&#39;s subjective, but it was hard<br/>
watching her watch so long.  After watching,<br/>
(sometimes during) she would be aggressive<br/>
 towards her sister, and demanding to me for<br/>
 &quot;MORE FOOD!&quot;  We had lots of trouble<br/>
getting out of the house to take my older daughter<br/>
to gymnastics etc.  Sometimes I really needed to<br/>
get out of the house to meet with friends, but she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to leave.  She isn&#39;t in a place to compromise,<br/>
 believe me I tried.  About 8 months ago, we just<br/>
 unplugged it, and said it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
Things aren&#39;t so crazy around here anymore,<br/>
 but I do feel cohersive, and would like to<br/>
 try the tv again.  Any suggestions?<br/>
