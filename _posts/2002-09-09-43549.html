<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609721420">Invest in a cellphone!   It will help make it more comfortable.    There are not &quot;constant&quot; curfews at our house but folks of whatever age do check in when there is a change of plans.   AND  it helps this neurotic mommy when it gets dark outside and the news is broadcasting about traffic accidents or bad weather!   Helps to hear their voice reminding me that they will indeed exercise good judgment both in their driving and their choice of activities. <br/>

<br/>
Mary, fwiw, I grew up in a single parent home, without any curfews or limits. I could go where I liked, come home when I wanted, and so on. Funny thing though - I went to a girls&#39; school and all the other girls had limits and curfews from their parents. THEY were the ones hanging out at nightclubs and staying out over curfew and trying drugs. I was the one who used to go home at  reasonable times and felt responsible for myself and  to my mum, so wouldn&#39;t get into any of the drug stuff. I respected myself and my mum and my ability to make good decisions,  too much to get into things I didn&#39;t want to...I&#39;m not saying your dd is getting into  situations like this, since she has a curfew. Just pointing out how  having no curfew worked positively for me...So much so, that dh and I do the same with our older three older boys ( teens). We just want to know where they are so we can contact them if anything comes up. But they&#39;d tell us anyway - they know we are interested in their doings...They choose their home times and are  pretty reasonable people...They have moblie phones, too, so we know they can phone us if they need to...Leonie W. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you read Parent/Teen Breakthrough by Mira Kirshenbaum? It&#39;s all about<br/>
how to let go and build a relationship with your teen. The basic idea is<br/>
that since teenhood is the period designed for pulling away, the more we try<br/>
to control, the harder they pull away. She advises not to do anything that<br/>
doesn&#39;t enhance your relationship with your teen. It&#39;s an excellent book.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my teenagers started going out at night beyond just a movie we asked<br/>
them to be home by midnight.  Gradually that deadline just melted away.  My<br/>
teens are all boys.  As others have posted, getting a cell phone has<br/>
allowed us to feel that we can reach them (yes the 15 year old sometimes<br/>
turns it off) but so far so good, they are always in bed asleep when I get<br/>
up in the morning:)<br/>
My experience over the last year is that even as an unschooling family,<br/>
teenagers will definitely cause parents to climb a steep growth curve and<br/>
have to reevalute their comfort zone frequently:)  I have also found that<br/>
although mainstream society and media would have us think otherwise, they<br/>
are lots of fun and can even be good adult company sometimes.<br/>

there&#39;s any problem or she wants to stay out a half hour later, etc. She&#39;s <br/>
real good about her curfew, has only been late once and most times is in <br/>

stay out all night. Don&#39;t forget, this one is a school kid and as much as I <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter Tara is quite the delightful teenager. Of course we have had our <br/>
share, maybe more so of trying times but she is doing great now. I do enjoy <br/>
having her around as the whole family does. The baby screams &quot;Tara&#39;s home&quot; <br/>
whenever she hears the key in the door at 3:00 and goes running. Tara went <br/>
on a week long cruise with friends before school started and we all missed <br/>
her terrribly. The first night I just envisioned she was at a friends house <br/>
but the second night was reality. I couldn&#39;t wait for her to get home and <br/>
when she came home she hugged me so tight I thought I would burst. She made <br/>
me promise to never leave  her again. (I wasn&#39;t the one that left!!!) She <br/>
said she was very homesick and although she had fun, she wouldn&#39;t do it <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s the school kid in the family but I try very hard to raise her with the <br/>
unschooling values. (still learning) She attends many functions with our <br/>
homeschooling group by her choice and I never say no, you have to go to <br/>
school. I have had many compliments on her behavior, willingness to help and <br/>
tolerance with all the kids. I&#39;ve had mom&#39;s who have daughters ask me how it <br/>
is that we seem so close and always seem to enjoy each other so much. It&#39;s <br/>
because we just do!!! They even have gone as far as to say they hope when <br/>
their daughter reaches that age, they will be like her and I are. It&#39;s nice <br/>
to hear.<br/>

given me any reason to doubt her and her judgements. I guess my reluctance <br/>
to let go of the rules I have set upon her have to do with what has happened <br/>
in the past. I don&#39;t bring that up with her, but in my own way, I bring it <br/>
up after all. Although the curfew thing has never been a problem, it&#39;s what <br/>
she could be doing after hours that is on my mind. I&#39;m to the point now <br/>
where I think she&#39;s gotten into all the trouble she could have already. <br/>
(okay not ALL) And she has proven herself and I think learned from her <br/>
mistakes. And she has never given me a fit about her curfew either. I just <br/>
think maybe lifting it will show her I respect her decisions more.<br/>

thinking too. I guess I still worry about all the others out late at night <br/>
finding her. Namely her ex who is stalking her. But I guess I&#39;ll always have <br/>
something to worry about no matter how old she is. She will be out with her <br/>
boyfriend and I trust him very much and more importantly the two of them <br/>
together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634879855">As you will be able to tell with this email I am hot!!<br/>
 I have been unschooling for about 5 years without any<br/>
negativity  from my husband, he has been okay with the<br/>
idea that out of all my children my youngest should<br/>
not go to school because of the way he learns.  (None<br/>
of them go to school)  If he were in school he would<br/>
be labeled ADD or ADHD.  Which is one of the many<br/>
reasons he is home with me.  My son has some anger<br/>
issues so sometimes he has a melt down not very often.<br/>
 But he had one the other night and my husband<br/>
suggested medication.  We have been down this road<br/>
with my 19year old who was on Ritalin for 5 years and<br/>
it turned him into a zombie.  My husband has said we<br/>
should try something else, or maybe it is his diet of<br/>
biscuits, bacon, pizza, and chips. (He is less needy<br/>
when he picks out those items he wishes to eat and<br/>
does not show any negativity or aggressive behavior<br/>
after eating, I totally can relate to everything Ren<br/>
said about food).  These things must be causing his<br/>
anger.  Of course it has nothing to do with the fact<br/>
that my husband is only home late in the evening and<br/>
on the weekends and when he is home he either watches<br/>
TV or parents by control.  Also since my son has been<br/>
born, we have moved three times and my husband has<br/>
lost his job 5 times.  As the youngest he also has<br/>
more than 2 parents his brothers and sister tend to<br/>
parent.  But of course  NONE of those things have<br/>
anything to do with it.  I need to also mention that<br/>
after a year my husband has gone off Zoloft, but will<br/>
not go back on or go to counseling.<br/>
<br/>
Please help!  Any thoughts, suggestions, or comments<br/>
would be appreciated I am at my wits end.<br/>

sincerely think you need to start with you and your husband first. Sounds <br/>
like many problems stem from you two not being on the same level regarding <br/>
your children. If it were me, I would give no choice but to seek some type <br/>
of counseling for the two of you to be able to come to conclusions about <br/>
what is going on. Not sure what kind of counseling you would be comfortable <br/>
with as far as church or professional or whatever. But I would insist on it <br/>
to start with.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds as if you are doing all you can right now concerning the kids and I&#39;m <br/>
sure it must be hard with no support from your husband. Sorry I couldn&#39;t be <br/>
of more help.<br/>

<br/>
Leslie, Your son sounds like one of my sons...He, too, has meltdowns...My dh loves the idea of unschooling and loves this son but does find some of ds&#39;s behaviour hard to understand...I think its easier for me, because I am with this son all the time...Anyway, what has really helped my dh *see* this son, and not his meltdown behaviour, has been books and videos - fiction.  Stories often illustrate ideas and dh and I hav eread and seen things that I have been able to use as egs for this ds&#39;s differences  The Ramona kids books are funny and incredably touching - dh *saw that it was not fair for Ramona to get into trouble ( nneed medication?) for her differences - and could apply this to our son...The movies October Sky  and Stand and Deliver held other &#39;aha&#39; moments...Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884066031">Mary, It sounds like there are two issues here that may not even be related!<br/>
Curfew<br/>
and<br/>
Trust<br/>
If she has done some things in the past that makes you not feel trustful,<br/>
that needs to be addressed seperately. A curfew is just an arbitrary time<br/>
that doesn&#39;t prevent anything &quot;bad&quot; from happening. I know for a fact that<br/>
kids have sex in the afternoon, smoke pot in the basement at 7:30 pm and<br/>
drink beer at the river while their parent&#39;s think they are at the Library<br/>
doing homework. My high school best friend had the earliest curfew of us all<br/>
(10:00 on weekends) and she packed it all into those early evening hours!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-142483807">Hi Leslie - My husband takes something similar to Zoloft.  After a couple of<br/>
years of problems with his dosage, etc., we came to an agreement that if *I*<br/>
say he needs to go to the doctor, change his meds, or increase his dose, he<br/>
does it with no argument, no discussion.  The times when they need the meds<br/>
the most are the times that they are least likely to want to hear it, in our<br/>
experience.  We came to this agreement when he was feeling well, though,<br/>
which made it much easier.<br/>
<br/>
When we were initially having problems with angry behavior and it became<br/>
obvious that we needed help, I did tell him he HAD to do this in order to<br/>
keep our marriage together.  It told him calmly, at a quiet time.  It was<br/>
not a healthy environment for my kids, and it is my job to provide that.<br/>
Not fun, and I really feel for you.  If he&#39;s been on it before, though, you<br/>
know the huge difference it makes, and we now live in a peaceful house.  My<br/>
husband is a happy person - himself again - and just like his unhappiness<br/>
did, his happiness affects everything in our home.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t say, but if your husband felt the Zoloft wasn&#39;t really making a<br/>
big difference, there are other medications that may work better for him.<br/>
We had to try two or three to find the one that worked out.<br/>
<br/>
If you could convince your husband to talk to someone, Jon would be happy to<br/>
email with him about what he went through, and where he&#39;s at now.  ~Rue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL!!!!! Yes I do know all too well that one can find trouble in a matter of <br/>
minutes even in the afternoon. My daughter for one. And our trust issues are <br/>
settled now and I do trust her. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not really sure why I feel so <br/>
strange about lifting the curfew. I could understand if I had the thought of <br/>
&quot;because that&#39;s what you do&quot; but I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t do anything because that&#39;s <br/>
the way it&#39;s always been done, I hate that thinking. And I never had a <br/>
curfew so I have no real answer as to why it&#39;s been set for so long. The <br/>
times, they will be changing!!!<br/>

&lt;GIANT HUGS&gt; to you, Leslie. I really don&#39;t have any advice, but I am here <br/>
to listen (read) if you need to vent. It does sound like he (your hubby) <br/>
*needs* to get back on HIS medication *before* putting your son on any. JMHO.<br/>

always perky and cheerful, but I&#39;m no longer depressed. Life is so much <br/>
better.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
