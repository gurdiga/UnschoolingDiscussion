How did I know that without being a psychiatrist!?<br/>
AMAZING.<br/>
<br/>
(Not really.   But they get to be in newsweek because they &quot;studied it&quot; while <br/>
I just saw it sitting where it lives. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Partly I&#39;m razzing you, JJ, but partly it&#39;s a reminder that things CAN be <br/>
learned without being an expert.   <br/>
<br/>
Once I guessed that someone was probably in her mid 20&#39;s and would feel <br/>
differently about the time she turned 30.  She got FURIOUS, and enough years have <br/>
passed now that she turned 30 and said &quot;Oh!  You were right.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       No dispute about that!  But I&#39;m tempted to razz you back -- just a <br/>
little! -- with a reminder that neither I nor anyone else ever suggested <br/>
otherwise in the recent discussion. That part seemed to be all in the ears of the <br/>
beholders, and in any case not a reminder needed by those of us who&#39;ve had to <br/>
deschool even more than most before we could successfully unschool! &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>
