<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815357855">I&#39;ve recently been in contact with a lady who lives across the street <br/>
from me.  She has three young children.  I think the oldest is 4.  <br/>
She wants to homeschool and is currently purchasing used Abeka from a <br/>
relative to have for future years.  I briefly told her about <br/>
unschooling.  She emailed me and said that she&#39;s interested in what I <br/>
do and that her husband has a lot of questions.  She wants to get <br/>
together with us to discuss it.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have some tips for me in how to explain unschooling?  Like <br/>
what kind of questions might they throw at me and how will I answer <br/>
them?  I&#39;m trying to think how I would have responded to the idea of <br/>
unschooling 10 years ago.   I worked my way up to it over a period of <br/>
years.  First the idea of homeschooling, then relaxed homeschooling, <br/>
then &quot;unschooling everything except for certain subjects&quot;, then <br/>
finally became an unschooler.  How do you throw a radical concept <br/>
like this at someone for the first time?  <br/>

<br/>
Send her to unschooling.com first, then ask her over for personal experience <br/>
sharing??  It&#39;s worth a shot! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

learned in school, and how much of what they  were made to learn in school<br/>
they actually remember.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes and please share these suggestions with the list, if you would, so I can <br/>
get more information.  I have attempted to explain to my sister and husband <br/>
and find myself getting &quot;Hung up.&quot;  They don&#39;t seem to understand what I&#39;m <br/>
talking about. . .!<br/>

friends.<br/>
Some of the questions we where asked was transcripts and college, Sports, <br/>
what if they get a year into it and decide they cant or do not want to do it?<br/>
Our family went over and we all answered their questions.<br/>
I feel somewhat radical but they are both onboard with what they want to do <br/>
and do not. They are not wanting a curriculum but may use a math book here <br/>
and there.<br/>
I also told them that they really need to allow plenty of time to deschool a <br/>
good year is possible maybe more. Also that if they truly deschool with the <br/>
intent to Unschool they most likely will not return to school nor want too.<br/>
Our son is unbelievable explaining what he does, what he has done and learned <br/>
over this past year. <br/>
Not sure if this little bit helps, be honest and maybe make a list before you <br/>
go in your mind.<br/>
