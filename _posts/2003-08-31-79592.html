videos.  Recently, they were playing all the MTV award winners and runner ups of <br/>
the past before this year&#39;s Music Awards.  I&#39;ve only seen one Train video, <br/>
Drops of Jupiter, and it&#39;s boring, heheh, they&#39;re just playing music on a stage.  <br/>
That boy is cute tho! <br/>
