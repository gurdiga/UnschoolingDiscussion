<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055939469"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt; So my H and I never wanted<br/>
&gt; to spank the two girls we have (now 6 & 5), but we<br/>
&gt; discovered that if you don&#39;t punish, they will not<br/>
&gt; learn.  Talking doesn&#39;t work.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Talking really does work, but it sometimes requires us as adults to revise<br/>
our attitudes and expectations.  When my son was about 3 or 4, it finally<br/>
occurred to me that I was often upset with him for things that were my<br/>
fault.  For example, melt-downs and whining were a late afternoon problem.<br/>
The solution turned out to a mid-afternoon snack that was more like a second<br/>
lunch.  Eat, drink, and be merry.  Literally.<br/>
<br/>
My son is now 6.  I&#39;m finding 6 so much more mature than 4-5, that it&#39;s easy<br/>
for me to expect him to be too responsible, too patient, too whatever.  It<br/>
certainly isn&#39;t fair for me to punish him for my too-grandiose expectations.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think children need punishment at all.  How about patience, love,<br/>
and talking about life?<br/>
