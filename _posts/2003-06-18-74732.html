&gt; of compromise! And he has been patient for four years, sharing the <br/>
&gt; bed or going off to a separate bed most of the time. Is it fair to <br/>
&gt; the marriage?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what the answer is for your family but just this past weekend I <br/>
had a talk with my FIL.  In almost 25 years there have been less than a <br/>
handful of &quot;serious&quot; talks with the man.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been married over forty years.  For the last 19 years he&#39;s shared his <br/>
marriage bed with one grandchild or the other that my MIL talked her daughters <br/>
into giving to them.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s never said a word about this and I always thought he WANTED it this way <br/>
and accepted it as their life together.<br/>
<br/>
He wishes he HAD said something at some point.  He sleeps in a small bed in <br/>
the same room with his wife and grandson.  The grandson wets the bed and sleeps <br/>
with his hands between MIL legs.  He doesn&#39;t like that, so he sleeps in the <br/>
bed he bought for the grandson.<br/>
<br/>
He feels cheated, he feels neglected, he feels less than and loved less for <br/>
all these years.  Now, these are not his flesh and blood children, but they are <br/>
his flesh and blood grandchildren and now his legally adopted children.  He <br/>
loves them beyond words but he also loves his wife and wants a relationship <br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
When his own children were young he said that he understood that the children <br/>
came first and they both worked hard at the common goal of being parents but <br/>
at night they were able to come together and share space of their own.  A <br/>
space that wasn&#39;t consumed with children.  They could reach out and touch each <br/>
other in the night and he even said that sex was not the main goal of his <br/>
relationship with MIL but it would be nice on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
He is thinking of moving away to their vacation house.  He said he will miss <br/>
them terribly but now that he&#39;s retired he just can&#39;t be there and not be a <br/>
&quot;part&quot; of things.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that my MIL caters to the children 24 hours a day.  Indulges them <br/>
whenever and with whatever they want.  The two kids there are homeschooled, <br/>
well one is done but the other homeschools and she takes this raising children <br/>
thing seriously.  Not like the mothers here do.  More in the line of what <br/>
Sandra sometimes describes.  Really intent on making them think the world stops <br/>
outside their doorway and keeping them believing that she is the world to them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if your husband ever feels this way or not.  No one could have <br/>
told me my FIL wasn&#39;t thrilled with his life but now that he&#39;s spoken the words <br/>
to me, I can see where he must have felt left out and unimportant at times.  <br/>
I would think it very hard to give up your marital bed for almost twenty years <br/>
as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that I spend a lot of time with my children, I do more for them than <br/>
for my DH and it&#39;s opened my eyes to make some of the extra effort that I go to <br/>
with my children spill over onto DH.<br/>
<br/>
In the end I&#39;d say that you as the mother have a right to your own body and <br/>
that your feelings are just as valid as your child&#39;s.  If it has become too <br/>
much for you, then only you can make the decision to stop nursing.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
there are other ways you can comfort your child that will be just as meaningful to <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I nursed all of my children, until they decided to stop but none really had <br/>
much interest much over a year old.  There was too much too do and see and they <br/>
didn&#39;t want to sit still too long for nursing, except at bedtime for a minute <br/>
or two and that even stopped before the age of two.<br/>
<br/>
Some children would nurse forever I guess.  My nephew was six or so when he <br/>
would still walk up to my sister sitting in a chair, unbutton her place, lift <br/>
out the breast and bend down and nurse sometimes he would just stand there and <br/>
fondle the breast then go back out and play.  I will say it caused a lot of <br/>
controversy but she didn&#39;t mind at all.  I&#39;m not sure when he stopped breast <br/>
feeding or even if he has yet, he&#39;s going to be eight in Feb.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess it really is up to the mother and child to decide what works best <br/>
for both of them, not just one or the other.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are with you as you figure this out.<br/>

children in our &quot;family bed&quot; for ten years now, and it has *not* <br/>
affected our marriage or our sex life.  With communication and <br/>
creativity *everyone* can get their needs met.<br/>
You seem to have set up a dichotomy in your mind... it&#39;s either <br/>
being &quot;consumed with children&quot; or having a happy, healthy marriage <br/>
with children kept in their place (away from parents) at night.<br/>
There is a lot of middle ground in between that you seem to have <br/>
purposefully overlooked.<br/>
For us, what works has changed over the years.  When the older two <br/>
were little and both in our king-sized bed we always had an <br/>
alternate place to go in the house (after they were asleep) when we <br/>
wanted to be alone at night.  These days our youngest is happy to <br/>
start off the night in a room shared with his brother (he falls <br/>
asleep quickly while being read to and having his back rubbed by me <br/>
or his Dad) with the understanding that if and when he wakes up in <br/>
the night he&#39;s welcome to join us right across the hall.  This way <br/>
we get a few hours in the early part of the night to be alone.  And <br/>
if our son wets our bed- big deal.  We do an extra load of laundry <br/>
in the morning.  It doesn&#39;t bother us.<br/>

I really didn&#39;t overlook that but was simply relaying information that I had <br/>

That&#39;s great that it doesn&#39;t bother you but to him a six year old that has <br/>
had four or five bottles during the night and cuts loose really makes a mess too <br/>
uncomfortable for him to sleep in and I can understand his feelings on that.<br/>

I don&#39;t know how dangerous it is or wrong to make that statement.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think anyone would mistake me thinking a 21 year old would roll home to nurse.  <br/>
I would like to clarify myself and say that some nurse much longer than others <br/>
and at some point there are probably lots of mothers who think it will never <br/>
end, but it does end at some point I am sure.<br/>
<br/>
glena who is sorry you were so offended by this post which were not my direct <br/>
feelings on anything, just sharing something from a male point of view AFTER <br/>
the fact.<br/>

I agree, Patti.<br/>
<br/>
In a situation where extended breastfeeding is harmful to *either* the <br/>
mother or child&#39;s emotional well-being, it is time to wean.  Breastfeeding <br/>
should be an enjoyable experience.  I know full well that there are hurdles; <br/>
sore breasts, infections, TEETH &lt;g&gt; (Chloe bit me for the first time <br/>
yesterday...youch!), but overall, you should feel *good* about <br/>
breastfeeding.  The child will not benefit from a mother&#39;s irritation and <br/>
resentment.  It is better to wean and use other times for bonding and love <br/>
sharing, imo.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is what I was thinking, Glena. La Leche League used to use the term <br/>
child-led weaning but now uses natural weaning because it better describes <br/>
what goes on. It is a relationship; both people matter.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t already you may want to check out MOTHERING YOUR NURSING <br/>
TODDLER,by Norma Jane Bumgarner; and HOW WEANING HAPPENS, by Diane Bengson. <br/>
Both have tips for weaning a toddler, as well as getting past the <br/>
difficulties when nursing one.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the family bed goes, I found that having a crib sidecar to our <br/>
bed (One long side of the crib removed) made a big difference. Sometimes I <br/>
could roll the baby over to the crib and pretend he wasn&#39;t there. He would, <br/>
of course, come back over by me during the night but I had a short time <br/>
with just me and John in the bed, or just me and space! A mattress on the <br/>
floor next to your bed might work as well.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily give advice about this now because for the first time in <br/>
almost 12 years we have no child in our bed and I am not pregnant!<br/>

 Weaning, when it&#39;s allowed to happen in a natural way, happens. <br/>
 Sometimes it happens at age four (as with my 2nd) and sometimes at age <br/>
6 (as with my 1st).  But I have never seen a normal child go to college <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree Joylyn. And watching a child wean naturally is really, really <br/>
cool thing. It&#39;s yet another demonstration that kids really will find <br/>
their way to maturity on their own grounds. I wonder why people think <br/>
children will nurse forever when children don&#39;t do things like crawl <br/>
forever.  Once a child has passed the *need*, they easily and <br/>
gracefully move on.<br/>
My 6 y.o. has more or less weaned. It&#39;s been a very slow and gradual <br/>
process, from my shock 2 years ago when he fell asleep without <br/>
nursing for the first time to now when that&#39;s the every night norm. <br/>
It&#39;s been really beautiful to give him this gift of letting go in his <br/>
own time. Still, because he&#39;s old enough to put his feelings about <br/>
nursing into complex language, I&#39;ve had the privilege of a window <br/>
into just how important nursing was to him. The other day he and I <br/>
were going back and forth saying &quot;I love you more than...&quot;. My last <br/>
one was &quot;I love you more than a gigantic ice cream sundae with <br/>
Euphoria chocolate sauce and slivered almonds and one of those cherry <br/>
things on top.&quot; He looked pensive for a minute, trying to top that <br/>
one. He finally came out with &quot;I love you more than your own <br/>
nummies.&quot; The game ended there. It was clearly the biggest and most <br/>
important thing he could think of. <br/>
My daughter is much less intent on nursing, she seems to need it so <br/>
much less than my son ever did. I think for her, weaning will happen <br/>
sometime in this next year (she&#39;s 3 now). It really does happen in <br/>
their own time. <br/>

college when she&#39;s 12, so you may see it.<br/>
<br/>
No, wait, she&#39;s not normal, she keeps telling me that. She&#39;s *weird*.<br/>
Never mind...<br/>
