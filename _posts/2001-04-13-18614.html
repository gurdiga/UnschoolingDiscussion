&lt;&lt; I have never seen such a sign here in the US.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a couple, but I&#39;m wondering if they were in airports in Canada or <br/>
England.  I think it was something about the age of eight years.  I&#39;d be more <br/>
worried about a little girl in the mens&#39; room than the other way around.  <br/>
More and more places have &quot;family restrooms&quot; which lock at the main door, so <br/>
a dad can take a little girl or a mom can take a baby AND a shy bigger boy.   <br/>
Sometimes girls need help and dads REALLY can&#39;t go in the ladies&#39; room.  It&#39;s <br/>
a problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794732936">More and more newer bathrooms found in malls and such are using the &quot;family&quot;<br/>
bathroom. I think this is great! And its about time! My problem with this was<br/>
that my then 4-5 yr old never wants to wait until the rest of us are finished,<br/>
and is always trying to unlock the door. Therefore, my potty breaks have always<br/>
been done as quickly as the consumption of my food during a lunch break. I only<br/>
wish I had the energy level that kids do.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-975808202">One of our malls here has put in two family bathrooms, with a big toilet and <br/>
a little potty-sized toilet, a big sink and a little preschool-sized sink, <br/>
and a little carseat-like seat you can strap your tiny toddler into while you <br/>
go so they&#39;re not puddling in the other toilet.  :-)  I love it! I take <br/>
people there just to see the restrooms! <br/>

They have those strap-in seat things at the swimming <br/>
pool we go to.  My little-un loved it!  was very handy <br/>
with 2 under 2yo...<br/>
