<br/>
I&#39;m really not lost.<br/>
I don&#39;t look at who read what, but I comment on the topics and questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I read that post three times and saved it in new mail, because I hadn&#39;t <br/>
responded to it, and I looked back and it&#39;s still in my new mail.<br/>
<br/>
What I thought every time was about you saying &quot;old soul.&quot;  That&#39;s not what <br/>
you asked about, but &quot;old soul&quot; is usually in reference to someone who seems <br/>
spiritually evolved.  Yet your problem involves hitting and not having self <br/>
control.  So I wondered what a good response would be like.<br/>
<br/>
I had already described in great detail our methods about hitting.  The <br/>
conversation had been for what seemed days about &quot;what if Kirby HITS Marty, <br/>
and I had no more to say about it than I had already, in detail, said.  When <br/>
that was a problem I would say &quot;Did you talk about it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did you ask for a grownup&#39;s help?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then you shouldn&#39;t have hit him.  FIRST talk, then get a grownup.  If that <br/>
doesn&#39;t help, THEN you can hit him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything the girl can do to keep the situation from escalating?  <br/>
They won&#39;t be six and eight forever, not even for another year.  She will <br/>
develop better communication skills.  He will develop better self control.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I just can&#39;t seem to get him to come to me or<br/>
say something to her first. His first reaction is to pop her one.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he really, truly, can&#39;t even talk to her first, I would tell him he can&#39;t <br/>
play with her,, and I would tell her not to get within arm&#39;s length of him <br/>
unless a grownup was there.<br/>
<br/>
But I would make a joke of it, and make it sweet and as funny as possible, <br/>
and say, &quot;Oh no... Kirby might get dangerous, so you sit over here and just <br/>
talk to him.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I would talk to her about recognizing the danger signals when he was losing <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that he&#39;s needing more protein in his diet?  Kirby and I both <br/>
are quick to get headaches if we don&#39;t have protein and three meals a day are <br/>
not enough.  Between meal protein snacks are good preventative for the <br/>
Kirby-grumpies, and even now that he&#39;s older, I try to remember to slip him a <br/>
snack if there&#39;s a many-hours stretch from one meal to another.<br/>
<br/>
Since you said you had tried all kinds of things but didn&#39;t say what they <br/>
were, I&#39;m hesitant to give the best few I can think of because you probably <br/>
already tried them..<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s why your post was very hard to respond to.  It said &quot;done <br/>
lots; no benefit,&quot; and the general topic had just been discussed at length on <br/>
the list.<br/>

<br/>
I get mad when people tell me I&#39;m hungry when I&#39;m cranky too. Even when it&#39;s<br/>
true!<br/>
I fix the kids some thing to eat, and AFTER they come &quot;back to earth&quot; I<br/>
mention the connection. I do it in a very impersonal way.<br/>
&quot;When our bodies tense up and feel that way, it is telling us it needs<br/>
rest.&quot;<br/>
&quot;When we get tense and feel anxious, and our bellies hurt, it&#39;s our body&#39;s<br/>
way of saying it needs some healthy food to give us more energy.&quot;<br/>
I try to avoid words like cranky, grumpy, orphrases like YOU ARE hungry, YOU<br/>
ARE tired.<br/>
Telling kids what they feel can be somewhat insulting, it comes from the<br/>
automatic assumption that I Know Better Than You.<br/>

Someone said here recently something similar to:<br/>
I don&#39;t make the choice for them but I sure will give my opinion!<br/>
I tell my kids my opinion about many things, and usually give the other side<br/>
too. I try not to get too vehement but I do let them know.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  But what&#39;s the transistion from <br/>
that to taking responsibility for themselves?  This has become very <br/>
contentious for us.  If  Sam&#39;s grumpy and we suggest maybe he&#39;s hungry or <br/>
that he didn&#39;t eat anything very solid lately, he gets really mad.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would just hand him food instead of talking about it!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How (what <br/>
words, tones, etc.) do people talk to kids about paying attention to their <br/>
body signals,  or their moods, or about nutrition in general?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;Here.&quot;<br/>
And after, I say &quot;Do you feel any better now that you&#39;ve eaten?&quot;  But I say <br/>
it nicely.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby as depressed Sunday morning, kinda pouty, about somethings that <br/>
happened when a big batch of kids went to a Lifehouse concert at the state <br/>
fair.  I had been planning to talk to him anyway, since even the way they got <br/>
into cars had an oddity.  So he told me what he was unhappy about, we talked <br/>
at home and on the way taking him to work.  I played devil&#39;s advocate, taking <br/>
the other kids&#39; sides, and bringing up potential justifications for their <br/>
attitudes and actions.  And I told him stories of himself to remind him that <br/>
sometimes those things happen with NO malice.  <br/>
<br/>
Monday morning, I asked him if he felt better about it.  He said not really.  <br/>
So I said he should find something fun and distraction to do that would make <br/>
him laugh, because if he stays sad and focussed on frustration too many days <br/>
in a row it&#39;s harder to recover and get cheerful again.<br/>
<br/>
If he seems sad again today, I&#39;ll probably get him to go do something with me <br/>
(we have real reasons to need to go shopping or on other errands) and I&#39;ll <br/>
consciously keep the conversation OFF that other topic, bring up happier <br/>
things, maybe go rent a new comedy  he hasn&#39;t seen.  He wants to watch <br/>
Unbreakable, but that&#39;s not cheery, so I won&#39;t suggest that one if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll feed him protein.  Some days he&#39;s wholly on his own.  Some days <br/>
there&#39;s one fixed-meal.  But today I won&#39;t let him get hungry, because he has <br/>
a specific need just as if he were sick with the flu.<br/>
<br/>
His social awareness didn&#39;t benefit him this time.  Two of the other kids who <br/>
are less concerned with nuances of interpersonal relations just said Kirby <br/>
over-reacts and should get over it.  But I see it as Kirby having an ability <br/>
which USUALLY is beneficial to the group, but this time worked against him.  <br/>
He wasn&#39;t able to &quot;just ignore&quot; what was so glaring to him, and neither was <br/>
he able to subtly turn the situation a better way as he often can do.<br/>
<br/>
He hurt his shoulder and couldn&#39;t figure out how.  I asked if it was the <br/>
mechanical bull.  He hadn&#39;t thought of that, but other kids told me he had <br/>
&quot;dashboarded&quot; (hit his head on the bull), and that he was good natured about <br/>
it and not too embarrassed.  But that could easily have been the shoulder <br/>
injury too.  So today he teaches karate at 4:15, has his own regular class at <br/>
5:00, and ordinarily would stay two more hours for the adult kobudo (weapons) <br/>
class, but he said last night he wants to come home at 6:00 instead of 8:00 <br/>
because of the shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy with his handling of these various difficulties, but I think given <br/>
his own biochemistry that he&#39;ll be better equipped to get happier sooner if <br/>
he has more than the usual amount of protein today.  <br/>

Right.  And we probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate it if we were squabbling<br/>
with our spouse for cause and he said &quot;You don&#39;t have a reason to be mad<br/>
at me -- it&#39;s just PMS.&quot;<br/>
