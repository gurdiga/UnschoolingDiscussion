<div id="ygrps-yiv-551034795">Hi Christine!<br/>
<br/>
We may be having to face a move and I am concerned.  Here in<br/>
Saskatchewan things seem pretty open/progressive where homeschooling is<br/>
concerned.  There&#39;s minimal contact/interference from the school board.<br/>
No testing, no real expectations etc.  There&#39;s a good chance we could<br/>
move to Ontario and I was wondering if you could share with me what I<br/>
might expect there in terms of unschooling priveleges.  My children are<br/>
10, 7 and 1 and a half.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>
<br/>
And, by the way, just HOW bad is the cost of living in T.O. nowadays? <br/>
What does a basic, 2-3 bedroom home in a fairly decent neighbourhood go<br/>
for outside of the city?  (within a manageable commute?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-805730511">welcome Christine ...<br/>
<br/>
day care is a great suggestion ... several moms in our h-s group do this and<br/>
it seems to work for them ... I think their motto is *organize, organize,<br/>
organize* but it can be done and as far as I can tell, their own dch haven&#39;t<br/>
dropped out of their extracurricular activities ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121049745">Christine,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your advice and ideas.   I used to do daycare before I had my <br/>
own children but after my first was born I was absolutely clueless as to <br/>
what to do for a tiny baby.  We were newly married and depending on military <br/>
doctors for help.  Lili was loosing weight after her birth even though I was <br/>
breastfeeding and she ate all the time.   Well I took her to the doctor a <br/>
lot and they never could figure out why she wasn&#39;t gaining weight but they <br/>
didn&#39;t do anything about it either.  Like I said I was <br/>
clueless....anyhow...someone overheard me tell a friend about an argument <br/>
that John and I had and they reported us for neglect.  (Dont ask how they <br/>
got to that conclusion I still dont know)  We were ordered to bring Lili to <br/>
the same pediatrician that had seen her before and not done anything.  This <br/>
time the doctor was very mean to me and accused me of starving my baby.   <br/>
She poked and prodded at Lili and gave me a dirty look when SHE made my baby <br/>
cry.  She ordered me to feed Lili right in front of her and I told her that <br/>
Lili had just eaten and wouldn&#39;t be hungry but she insisted.  So I tried to <br/>
feed Lili and she didn&#39;t eat ...DUH.  And that doctor had the nerve to tell <br/>
me that Lili had starved so much that she had lost the desire to eat!!!! (I <br/>
Still get so mad thinking about this!)   So then I took Lili to Arkansas <br/>
Childrens Hospital and they looked at Lili and said that she was very <br/>
healthy and alert even though she was so tiny.  They set me up with a <br/>
lactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at all <br/>
in my breastmilk.  So she wrote a letter saying I had done nothing wrong and <br/>
what the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she <br/>
didn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors <br/>
letter.  (SORRY FOR THE LONG STORY)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that is now permanently on my record. That I was found guilty of <br/>
child neglect so I doubt I could do daycare again.  I tried before Tacy was <br/>
born because I had been told that the case was unfounded but it turns out <br/>
that they DID find us guilty and never told us.  I only found out when I <br/>
tried to be a daycare provider on the base.  And they wouldn&#39;t let me.  Boy <br/>
do I know how to make a short story long or what!  Sorry everyone! =)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you though for the advice. I appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
Holly<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a horrible time you went through! It just makes me so mad how misunderstood you were and how little knowledge of breastfeeding there is. What makes me even more mad is that you were found guilty and denied the chance to care for other children when you obviously seem like a loving person.

Christine,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your advice and ideas.   I used to do daycare before I had my <br/>
own children but after my first was born I was absolutely clueless as to <br/>
what to do for a tiny baby.  We were newly married and depending on military<br/>
<br/>
doctors for help.  Lili was loosing weight after her birth even though I was<br/>
<br/>
breastfeeding and she ate all the time.   Well I took her to the doctor a <br/>
lot and they never could figure out why she wasn&#39;t gaining weight but they <br/>
didn&#39;t do anything about it either.  Like I said I was <br/>
clueless....anyhow...someone overheard me tell a friend about an argument <br/>
that John and I had and they reported us for neglect.  (Dont ask how they <br/>
got to that conclusion I still dont know)  We were ordered to bring Lili to <br/>
the same pediatrician that had seen her before and not done anything.  This <br/>
time the doctor was very mean to me and accused me of starving my baby.   <br/>
She poked and prodded at Lili and gave me a dirty look when SHE made my baby<br/>
<br/>
cry.  She ordered me to feed Lili right in front of her and I told her that <br/>
Lili had just eaten and wouldn&#39;t be hungry but she insisted.  So I tried to <br/>
feed Lili and she didn&#39;t eat ...DUH.  And that doctor had the nerve to tell <br/>
me that Lili had starved so much that she had lost the desire to eat!!!! (I <br/>
Still get so mad thinking about this!)   So then I took Lili to Arkansas <br/>
Childrens Hospital and they looked at Lili and said that she was very <br/>
healthy and alert even though she was so tiny.  They set me up with a <br/>
lactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at all<br/>
<br/>
in my breastmilk.  So she wrote a letter saying I had done nothing wrong and<br/>
<br/>
what the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she <br/>
didn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors <br/>
letter.  (SORRY FOR THE LONG STORY)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, that is now permanently on my record. That I was found guilty of <br/>
child neglect so I doubt I could do daycare again.  I tried before Tacy was <br/>
born because I had been told that the case was unfounded but it turns out <br/>

&gt;Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2000 18:03:42 -0500<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi, I&#39;m a newbie, and I&#39;ve been lurking for about 1 week, but I felt I had<br/>
&gt;to come on line to talk to the woman who wants to find work and homeschool.<br/>
&gt;I run a small school/daycare at my home, and it would support me and my<br/>
&gt;two kids, if I had a smaller mortgage, dh is helping to take care of that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You would have to look into the regulations where you are, Here in<br/>
&gt;Toronto, I am allowed to take in up to 5 children legally INCLUDING MY OWN<br/>
&gt;KIDS.  I am able to get about $200/week per child, so living frugally, that<br/>
&gt;would be managable.  Toronto has a fairly high cost of living, but I can<br/>
&gt;also charge more.  You woud have to phone around other care givers in your<br/>
&gt;neighbourhood.  It does have a real impact on how much outside activity you<br/>
&gt;can do, as I don&#39;t have a car, and wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable driving other<br/>
&gt;people&#39;s kids, but there are always evenings and weekends.  I also have<br/>
&gt;heard of people who offer to homeschool other people&#39;s kids for a fee,<br/>
&gt;which may be viable for you.  It also means you would get older kids.<br/>
&gt;Before and after school care is also an option, and not so time consuming.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I may as well introduce myself now.  My name is christine, and I have two<br/>
&gt;little girls, 4 and 1.  I am by profession a Montessori teacher, hence my<br/>
&gt;current occupation.  We are unschooling my children, and it I have found it<br/>
&gt;amazing to look at Maria Montessori&#39;s writings from that unschooling angle.<br/>
&gt;As I am sure many of you out there have already firgured out, thee isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;alot of difference.<br/>
&gt;Gotta go make dinner.  Good luck with finding work that will help you out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747039567">No, NO trial is required.  They take all the information to a meeting and <br/>
discuss it with a bunch of people who dont know you.  They do not ask for <br/>
charachter witnesses or let you speak on your own behalf.  They simply <br/>
decide whether the allegations against you are unfounded or not.  If they <br/>
decide that they are not unfounded then they decide whether they will take <br/>
your children from you or not.  In my case they found that the allegations <br/>
were not unfounded but that they would not take my child from me.   The <br/>
reason I was not informed officially was that  they would NOT take my child <br/>
from me.  They said that they sent a letter but I never recieved any such <br/>
letter  or I would have fought it.  By the time I found out I had been found <br/>
guilty the case was closed and could no longer be fought.  When I spoke to <br/>
the head of family advocacy at our base she informed me that she voted that <br/>
the allegations were not unfounded because she didn&#39;t like my attitude.  <br/>
Well who would have a good attitude when she has just been accused of <br/>
starving her infant child!  I was abused as a child and the biggest insult <br/>
to me is that ANYONE would ever think I could abuse or neglect my own <br/>
children.   If they had known me or even done a thourough investigation they <br/>
would not have found me guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Holly Atchison<br/>
<br/>
Ps....Just so you know.  In the military there is no one to watch over <br/>
Family Advocacy to make sure that they dont abuse their power.  Sad isn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>

&gt;lactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at <br/>
&gt;all<br/>

&gt;and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;what the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors<br/>
&gt;letter.  (SORRY FOR THE LONG STORY)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, that is now permanently on my record. That I was found guilty of<br/>

&gt;that they DID find us guilty and never told us.  I only found out when I<br/>
&gt;tried to be a daycare provider on the base.  And they wouldn&#39;t let me.  Boy<br/>
&gt;do I know how to make a short story long or what!  Sorry everyone! =)<br/>

&gt; &gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Homeschooling and work<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2000 18:03:42 -0500<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hi, I&#39;m a newbie, and I&#39;ve been lurking for about 1 week, but I felt I <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt; &gt;to come on line to talk to the woman who wants to find work and <br/>
&gt;homeschool.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I run a small school/daycare at my home, and it would support me and my<br/>
&gt; &gt;two kids, if I had a smaller mortgage, dh is helping to take care of <br/>
&gt;that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   You would have to look into the regulations where you are, Here in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Toronto, I am allowed to take in up to 5 children legally INCLUDING MY <br/>
&gt;OWN<br/>
&gt; &gt;KIDS.  I am able to get about $200/week per child, so living frugally, <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be managable.  Toronto has a fairly high cost of living, but I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;also charge more.  You woud have to phone around other care givers in <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt; &gt;neighbourhood.  It does have a real impact on how much outside activity <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;can do, as I don&#39;t have a car, and wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable driving <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt; &gt;people&#39;s kids, but there are always evenings and weekends.  I also have<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard of people who offer to homeschool other people&#39;s kids for a fee,<br/>
&gt; &gt;which may be viable for you.  It also means you would get older kids.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Before and after school care is also an option, and not so time <br/>
&gt;consuming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I may as well introduce myself now.  My name is christine, and I have two<br/>
&gt; &gt;little girls, 4 and 1.  I am by profession a Montessori teacher, hence my<br/>
&gt; &gt;current occupation.  We are unschooling my children, and it I have found <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt;amazing to look at Maria Montessori&#39;s writings from that unschooling <br/>
&gt;angle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;As I am sure many of you out there have already firgured out, thee isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;alot of difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gotta go make dinner.  Good luck with finding work that will help you <br/>
&gt;out.<br/>

&gt; No, NO trial is required.  They take all the information to a meeting and<br/>

base we are at.   I know a lot of very good mothers that are afraid that a <br/>
nosy neighbor will misinterpret something that they see or hear them do and <br/>
will report them.  I have heard of Family Advocacy really coming down hard <br/>
on some people and completely ignoring other families. A friend of mine had <br/>
her son taken away from her for spanking her son after he ran in front of a <br/>
moving car in a parking lot. While I don&#39;t spank my own children I dont <br/>
think it was worth even being reported much less having him taken away!  It <br/>
took her a week to get him back. They did more trauma to him by taking him <br/>
from his mother than she did spanking him.  Sad huh?<br/>

No, NO trial is required.  They take all the information to a meeting and <br/>
discuss it with a bunch of people who dont know you.  They do not ask for <br/>
charachter witnesses or let you speak on your own behalf.  They simply <br/>
decide whether the allegations against you are unfounded or not.  If they <br/>
decide that they are not unfounded then they decide whether they will take <br/>
your children from you or not.  In my case they found that the allegations <br/>
were not unfounded but that they would not take my child from me.   The <br/>
reason I was not informed officially was that  they would NOT take my child <br/>
from me.  They said that they sent a letter but I never recieved any such <br/>
letter  or I would have fought it.  By the time I found out I had been found<br/>
<br/>
guilty the case was closed and could no longer be fought.  When I spoke to <br/>
the head of family advocacy at our base she informed me that she voted that <br/>
the allegations were not unfounded because she didn&#39;t like my attitude.  <br/>
Well who would have a good attitude when she has just been accused of <br/>
starving her infant child!  I was abused as a child and the biggest insult <br/>
to me is that ANYONE would ever think I could abuse or neglect my own <br/>
children.   If they had known me or even done a thourough investigation they<br/>
<br/>
would not have found me guilty.<br/>
<br/>

Ps....Just so you know.  In the military there is no one to watch over <br/>
Family Advocacy to make sure that they dont abuse their power.  Sad isn&#39;t <br/>
it?<br/>

&gt;How can you be found &quot;guilty&quot; without your knowledge. A trial is required,<br/>

&gt;Christine,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for your advice and ideas.   I used to do daycare before I had my<br/>
&gt;own children but after my first was born I was absolutely clueless as to<br/>
&gt;what to do for a tiny baby.  We were newly married and depending on <br/>
&gt;military<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;doctors for help.  Lili was loosing weight after her birth even though I <br/>
&gt;was<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;breastfeeding and she ate all the time.   Well I took her to the doctor a<br/>
&gt;lot and they never could figure out why she wasn&#39;t gaining weight but they<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t do anything about it either.  Like I said I was<br/>
&gt;clueless....anyhow...someone overheard me tell a friend about an argument<br/>
&gt;that John and I had and they reported us for neglect.  (Dont ask how they<br/>
&gt;got to that conclusion I still dont know)  We were ordered to bring Lili to<br/>
&gt;the same pediatrician that had seen her before and not done anything.  This<br/>
&gt;time the doctor was very mean to me and accused me of starving my baby.<br/>
&gt;She poked and prodded at Lili and gave me a dirty look when SHE made my <br/>
&gt;baby<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;cry.  She ordered me to feed Lili right in front of her and I told her that<br/>
&gt;Lili had just eaten and wouldn&#39;t be hungry but she insisted.  So I tried to<br/>
&gt;feed Lili and she didn&#39;t eat ...DUH.  And that doctor had the nerve to tell<br/>
&gt;me that Lili had starved so much that she had lost the desire to eat!!!! (I<br/>
&gt;Still get so mad thinking about this!)   So then I took Lili to Arkansas<br/>
&gt;Childrens Hospital and they looked at Lili and said that she was very<br/>
&gt;healthy and alert even though she was so tiny.  They set me up with a<br/>
&gt;lactation doctor who ran tests on my milk and found that I had NO FAT at <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;in my breastmilk.  So she wrote a letter saying I had done nothing wrong <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;what the problem was.  Well.......The head of family advocacy said she<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t like my attitude so they found us guilty regardless of the doctors<br/>
&gt;letter.  (SORRY FOR THE LONG STORY)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyhow, that is now permanently on my record. That I was found guilty of<br/>
&gt;child neglect so I doubt I could do daycare again.  I tried before Tacy was<br/>
&gt;born because I had been told that the case was unfounded but it turns out<br/>
&gt;that they DID find us guilty and never told us.  I only found out when I<br/>
&gt;tried to be a daycare provider on the base.  And they wouldn&#39;t let me.  Boy<br/>
&gt;do I know how to make a short story long or what!  Sorry everyone! =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you though for the advice. I appreciate it!<br/>

&gt; &gt;Date: Wed, 21 Jun 2000 18:03:42 -0500<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Hi, I&#39;m a newbie, and I&#39;ve been lurking for about 1 week, but I felt I <br/>
&gt;had<br/>
&gt; &gt;to come on line to talk to the woman who wants to find work and <br/>
&gt;homeschool.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I run a small school/daycare at my home, and it would support me and my<br/>
&gt; &gt;two kids, if I had a smaller mortgage, dh is helping to take care of <br/>
&gt;that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   You would have to look into the regulations where you are, Here in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Toronto, I am allowed to take in up to 5 children legally INCLUDING MY <br/>
&gt;OWN<br/>
&gt; &gt;KIDS.  I am able to get about $200/week per child, so living frugally, <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;would be managable.  Toronto has a fairly high cost of living, but I can<br/>
&gt; &gt;also charge more.  You woud have to phone around other care givers in <br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt; &gt;neighbourhood.  It does have a real impact on how much outside activity <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;can do, as I don&#39;t have a car, and wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable driving <br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt; &gt;people&#39;s kids, but there are always evenings and weekends.  I also have<br/>
&gt; &gt;heard of people who offer to homeschool other people&#39;s kids for a fee,<br/>
&gt; &gt;which may be viable for you.  It also means you would get older kids.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Before and after school care is also an option, and not so time <br/>
&gt;consuming.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I may as well introduce myself now.  My name is christine, and I have two<br/>
&gt; &gt;little girls, 4 and 1.  I am by profession a Montessori teacher, hence my<br/>
&gt; &gt;current occupation.  We are unschooling my children, and it I have found <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt; &gt;amazing to look at Maria Montessori&#39;s writings from that unschooling <br/>
&gt;angle.<br/>
&gt; &gt;As I am sure many of you out there have already firgured out, thee isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;alot of difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Gotta go make dinner.  Good luck with finding work that will help you <br/>
&gt;out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
