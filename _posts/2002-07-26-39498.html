 </span></blockquote>That was my experience.  A year or so ago, in a more teachy moment, I tried<br/>
to teach Tim phonics.  I was trying to get him to play with letters and<br/>
sounds with me.  Dumb idea.  He already knew many of the sounds, and the<br/>
ones he didn&#39;t know, he didn&#39;t care about.<br/>

I think there&#39;s a bit of egotism in the idea of teaching kids.  We need to<br/>
feel needed in that way, or something.  It can be tough on our ego to<br/>
realize that our children don&#39;t need us to teach them.  When they desire it,<br/>
they learn it.  But then, I learn things all the time that I need to know to<br/>
do something else.  Why shouldn&#39;t my son?<br/>

Welcome back, Joyce.  Nice vacation?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you! Yes it was. It&#39;s always nice to visit the family. And it&#39;s<br/>
especially nice since I loaned my father a stack of homeschooling books last<br/>
year to read. Now he doesn&#39;t even make the couple of concerned comments that<br/>
he used to ;-) (I suspect he didn&#39;t even read them.)<br/>
