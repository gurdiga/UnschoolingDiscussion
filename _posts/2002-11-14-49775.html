<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246883608">Stephanie, I checked out their website just now. Dang! Too bad we&#39;re <br/>
not still in CA, there seem to be lots of corps there. We&#39;re in No. <br/>
Utah. Looks like a really cool organization for anyone else who might <br/>
have interested teens. <br/>

Here&#39;s their site...  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dci.org">http://www.dci.org</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838053030">My husband did this for 2 or 3 years in high school and loved it. When I found out<br/>
about it I was really bummed that I only played clarinet. There is a corps up in Delaware<br/>
that I hope is still around when the boys get older (I also hope that they are interested!).<br/>
I love going to the shows...they have a small one at a local high school and we have<br/>
taken Jason the last two years. He loved it (although he hates the open stands we had to<br/>
sit in!).<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago the National Championships was held at the University of Maryland. Jeff and<br/>
I went with Kyle who was only 5 months old (Jason was only 3 and would never have made it<br/>
through all the corps). Kyle sat and nursed in the sling the whole time<br/>
and managed to even fall asleep finally. We had such a good time....the music was awesome.<br/>
Such power.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739625168">I live in Bear, just north of the canal.  My son is 3.  I would be interested in getting together and talking sometime.  I don&#39;t know any unschoolers around here yet, the people I know who are homeschooling are into &quot;doing school&quot; at a set time everyday, etc.  <br/>
It must have been someone else that said they met their husband at Virginia Tech.<br/>
