&lt;&lt; And I&#39;ve been told the years-old yahoogroup called &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; <br/>
 isn&#39;t very radical. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was my experience with them, but at the time that would have been ok.<br/>
The conversation that made me leave was one of the members leaving her dh to <br/>
see some guy she&#39;d met at that list. She was breaking up her family over it, <br/>
I was ill and couldn&#39;t stay after that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Ren and Sandra - which list are you talking about?  I&#39;ve had good<br/>

<br/>
Well, I was only there a very short time and in that time they badmouthed <br/>
unschooling.com several times and then there was this conversation about <br/>
someone meeting up with a guy that she&#39;d met at the list and was leaving her <br/>
dh for.<br/>
It upset me a lot since I&#39;d just gotten through some really rough stuff with <br/>
my dh, it made me physically ill for real.<br/>
So I left without giving it much of a chance.<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not like that all the time. I did read some good stuff in <br/>
between the other too....it just didn&#39;t seem as &quot;radical&quot; as unschooling.com <br/>
for me, which is what I needed input on for long term growth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think we &quot;talked&quot; about this before, Rue---you and I. I left shortly after <br/>
one woman said that her children were grown and worthless. That they do <br/>
nothing all day but sit around. Can&#39;t hold jobs---can&#39;t FIND jobs---can&#39;t DO <br/>
anything. She was depressed. THEY were depressed. <br/>
<br/>
It seemed that to her, radical meant that you leave the children to fend for <br/>
themselves and don&#39;t interact at all. <br/>
<br/>
I got tired of it. Has it gotten better?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127337695">Kelly and Ren - I&#39;ve been on RUL for three years and don&#39;t remember any<br/>
of what you&#39;re talking about, so maybe it was before my time?  I think<br/>
they call the list radical just to make clear that it is not a list for<br/>
people who unschool except for _____.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone say that<br/>
radical means let them fend for themselves, and I am a very regular<br/>
poster there.   ~Rue<br/>
