Yeah! Sometimes, it&#39;s really cool to have a great big surface to draw on. I <br/>
found that if I drop into the local supermarket shortly before the huge window <br/>
posters are going to be changed and ask for them, the manager is usually happy <br/>
to let us have them if I&#39;ll pick them up within a few hours so they&#39;re not <br/>
taking up storage space. The backs offer acres of clean white surface for BIG <br/>
art. I&#39;ve also gotten large poster board size card posters from restaurants.<br/>
