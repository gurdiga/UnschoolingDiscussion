This is probably a pretty unnecessary e-mail, but I just wanted to let you <br/>
know that I know exactly where your daughter is coming from. I&#39;m an unschooler <br/>
too, and all I seem to be able to do is contact parents of unschoolers...witch <br/>
doesn&#39;t do me very good when I&#39;m looking for other unschoolers to socialize <br/>
with. I hope some one answers your e-mail with<br/>
the resources you requested, because I&#39;m sure it would be a big help for both <br/>
your daughter and me! <br/>
