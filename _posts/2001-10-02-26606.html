<div id="ygrps-yiv-959194528">Hey, here&#39;s a novel idea.  How about everyone do that.  And the next time<br/>
they don&#39;t like something that Bridget posts they can just let it go, don&#39;t<br/>
read it or delete it and not jump in and accuse her of attacking Sandra.<br/>
Everyone here is quite capable of taking care of themselves and don&#39;t need a<br/>
cheerleading section to come flying to their rescue.  Particularly when the<br/>
cheerleader didn&#39;t get it right to begin with!<br/>
<br/>
It is beginning to sound to me like Bridget bating.  Folks know how to push<br/>
her buttons, so why the heck do they get bent out of shape when she responds<br/>
in kind?  If folks don&#39;t have anything better to do than look for ways to<br/>
either disect or twist things she says, perhaps they need to look to<br/>
themselves to see where the problem lies.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bridget, you do have a lot to offer this list.  I&#39;d like to keep on<br/>
reading<br/>
&gt; what you have to say about unschooling and all that entails.  I do not<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to read one more post about your conflict with Sandra.  If you don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; what Sandra has to say, stop reading her posts.  This is what I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt; have to do with your posts if you can&#39;t put your dislike of her aside and<br/>
&gt; participate in the group without it.  I&#39;d really rather just be able to<br/>
&gt; read everyone&#39;s posts.<br/>

She&#39;s been asked to drop it.  I haven&#39;t seen anything in the last week or <br/>
so that could remotely be called pushing her buttons, so why is she still <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846106757">1)  Attributing an answer to a post as being an attack on Sandra when the<br/>
poster she was responding to was not Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The harang over the testing.  She voiced an opinion and suddenly it was<br/>
all about her ego or some such nonsense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-631245329">Thank you Lynda!<br/>
<br/>
I would love to be able to participate in discussions here.<br/>
Unfortunately, everytime I try, my words are twisted.  When I say I think<br/>
IQ tests are meaningless, I&#39;m told I&#39;m bragging.  When I say I am tired<br/>
of being diagnosed by someone who has never even met me, I am accused of<br/>
attacking Sandra when she isn&#39;t even who I am talking about.  I am still<br/>
chuckling about that actually.  I said something about a different person<br/>
but it was assumed by certain folks that I was talking about Sandra and<br/>
that they needed to jump in and defend her.  That must say something in<br/>
and of itself!<br/>
<br/>
It has become quite obvious that I will never be allowed to participate<br/>
fully and equally here.  Everything I say is put through some bizarre<br/>
inquisition now.  Apparently it is perfectly okay to attack me, but I am<br/>
not allowed to answer. You need not bother trying to defend me against<br/>
them any more.  I think I may understand what their problem is now and I<br/>
will keep ignoring the hurtfulness and keep trying to offer what help I<br/>
can.<br/>

It isn&#39;t bragging to say IQ test are meaningless.  It<br/>
is bragging to brag about your scores or &quot;level&quot;.<br/>
