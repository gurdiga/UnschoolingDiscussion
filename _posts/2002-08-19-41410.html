<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797694490">Just a little note of laughter and joy this am.<br/>
It&#39;s the first day of school here in IN for our city.  <br/>
It&#39;s thunderstorming with lots of lighting and bangs.<br/>
My two are snuggled under blankets watching TVLand giggling.<br/>
Sure am glad they aren&#39;t headed out to school.  <br/>
By the way the first bus makes its rounds at 6:45 am.  That is way <br/>
too early.<br/>

Boy, that is awesome. It kind of makes you almost feel guilty, eh?<br/>

Actually elated!  I always resort back to the womb on rainy days.  <br/>
Loving coziness and blankets.  Even sitting in the car with the rain <br/>
beating down reminds me of snuggliness.  Weird, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I felt bad for the trucks sitting outside waiting for the school bus:<br/>
just alittle.  what those moms and dads must go thru to get those <br/>
kids up, washed, dressed, fed and on the bus before 7am.  ugh.<br/>
<br/>
esp. in the winter.<br/>

Not at all. One of the greatest things is when the kids go out to play in the <br/>
rain at 10 AM on a school day! (Alas, not much rain here for awhile -- San <br/>
Diego)<br/>
