<div id="ygrps-yiv-12707892">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I am considering unschooling my Edison Trait/Hunter 7 year-old son. I <br/>
haven&#39;t the faintest clue as to where to start! What is really <br/>
involved? Can it be realistically be done in a small, rural <br/>
Midwestern community? Will I stay sane? ;)<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m planning to unschool my one-year-old and I also live in a fairly small, rural Midwestern community. Just joining this list and a couple others has helped me discover that there are a ton of home/unschoolers right near me. I&#39;m sure someone has great book recommendations to help you get started. I have to do that myself.<br>
