<div id="ygrps-yiv-566043332">Our ds goes to bed around midnight and is aching to play w/ other kids in<br/>
the evening (maybe 8-10 pm).  He&#39;s 4.  He&#39;s a sweet, social guy into all<br/>
things mobile. Also drawing  and building and running around.  Sound<br/>
familiar?  Are there any kids who stay up late who live in the area who<br/>
might like to have evening play dates?  This has been the hardest thing to<br/>
find for us.  I hope hope hope we can find someone out there.<br/>
<br/>
You can email me privately if you&#39;d like at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abzb@...">abzb@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
