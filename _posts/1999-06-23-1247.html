<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309785111">Hi- I&#39;m another person who&#39;s new to this list. <br/>
I&#39;m also another one who passed the GED without studying. I dropped out<br/>
of high school at age 16 and at age 25 decided to go to college. <br/>
After I had been going to our local community college for a year, they<br/>
sent me a letter saying that I needed to get a GED if I wanted to<br/>
continue there. I went and took the test and passed the first time and<br/>
with high scores. <br/>
I don&#39;t regret leaving high school at all and my son is also planning on<br/>
going to community college for the first 2 years. (He&#39;ll probably take<br/>
his GED first).<br/>
By the way, my name is Diane. I&#39;m a single mom of 3: 2 sons, ages 13 and<br/>
7; one daughter, age 11. We started homeschooling in September and<br/>
unschooling followed shortly after.</div>

I left ps and went to an independent study hs for a while.  Then, at 16 I<br/>
took my GED without studying a lick and passed with very high scores.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Its different state to state.  I doubt anyplace is doing pre-teens, though.  <br/>
In New Mexico you&#39;re supposed to be 18 or past the graduation date of people <br/>
you went to school with (or some such) but in Arizona, 15 is okay.  I know <br/>
one family for sure and others have considered (and maybe did) the drive to <br/>
Flagstaff from Albuquerque, and get it over with that way.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873117466">Me too, me too. I took my GED without studying in 1985 a few months<br/>
after dropping out of Highschool and turning 16. I dropped out because<br/>
my gpa dropped below a 3.75. I saw no point in continuing in that<br/>
negative social environment that had totally eroded my sense of self<br/>
worth despite my good grades. You can&#39;t spend 11 years in a situation<br/>
where you are told on a daily basis that you are not acceptable, no<br/>
matter what you do, because of how you look (I was poor and fat) without<br/>
it having some negative effect on you. I can&#39;t even begin to list all<br/>
the awful, horrible things I have endured in my life since I left school<br/>
because of what happened to me in school. I have now, finally, almost 15<br/>
yrs later, begun to realize that I have some worth. I couldn&#39;t ever<br/>
imagine sending my children into that kind of a situation. Looking back<br/>
I see that my parents would have been great unschooling parents if only<br/>
they had known it was an option. My home life was full of learning<br/>
opportunities. I remember my parents taking us with them almost<br/>
everywhere, even places most people wouldn&#39;t take their children. I<br/>
always thought we were different because all three of us could socialize<br/>
well with adults from a very early age, we just had trouble with our<br/>
peers. It turns out that this is a more desirable situation. My children<br/>
can also socialize well with people of all ages. It makes no sense to me<br/>
that the system expects children to learn in a peer segregated<br/>
situation. I was so peer dependant it wasn&#39;t funny, but take me away<br/>
from that situation and I fit in pretty well. Anyway, I am sure I am<br/>
preaching to the choir.  I just wanted to add my .02 to the fray.  I<br/>
thank God for giving me the opportunity to learn that there is life not<br/>
only beyond school but without school completely.  btw, when i got my<br/>
GED I went to community college for a few quarters and the social<br/>
situation there was so different than High School. I believe more so<br/>
than a University would be since many of the people at the community<br/>
college were older, going back for further education, as opposed to a<br/>
university where the majority are fresh out of highschool. I highly<br/>
recommend it as a transitional place for teens who want to go to<br/>
college.  <br/>
<br/>
Who mentioned Star Trek a while back? I missed the beginning of that<br/>
one. Did anyone mention Wesley Crusher? He was an unschooler to a<br/>
degree. At least he was self motivated, doing interest based learning<br/>
and self education. <br/>

to see it has slowed down to a manageable level)<br/>
<br/>
ps. my spellchecker doesn&#39;t recognize unschool as a word! maybe we need<br/>
to have a talk with the folks at Websters. &lt;g&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518402150">Dear Starfreedom,<br/>
	Thank you for your touching story, which, I&#39;m sure reflects many of <br/>
our pasts, as well.  I have always held the theory that if children do well <br/>
academically in school, it is in spite of, not because of, their school <br/>
experience.  <br/>
	I have found in working with and teaching parents for 15 years, that <br/>
the kids that do well academically in schools only do so because they bring <br/>
the work HOME and do it there (they call it homework).  <br/>
	What the heck do they do with the kids in school for 6-7 hours a day? <br/>
 Who knows!  (Of course, we know - it&#39;s that stupid socialization cr-p).  But <br/>
I really believe that the only ones who succeed in school (academically) are <br/>
the ones who, after school hours, are &quot;schooling&quot; themselves at home, by <br/>
doing their projects and homework ON THEIR OWN (with help from their <br/>
PARENTS).  <br/>
	So, therefore, IMO, they, too are homeschooling. Quid pro <br/>
quo...homeschooling kids are the ONLY ones who succeed academically, whether <br/>
they are in school or homeschooling.  Any other theories?  Lynnie in WA</div>

I think it depends on your state.  In Illinois, you can&#39;t take the GED until <br/>
the class you would have graduated with has graduated.  At least that&#39;s what <br/>
it was a few years ago when my brother took it.  He had to wait &#39;till he was <br/>
18.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782159086">Hi Johanna,<br/>
You&#39;re in Tennessee, right? I&#39;m not familiar with the requirements there,<br/>
but in MO hm&#39;schoolers have it pretty simple. Since my dd is 16, she can<br/>
legally be out of &#39;school&#39;. We are not impressed with the GED or with any<br/>
other paper document that resembles a diploma..no real meaning and just a<br/>
hoop that we refuse to jump though. But if a diploma would ever be required,<br/>
they are available at Office Supply Stores, or we could print her up<br/>
something equally impressive on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
If Emily does chose to go to college later, then she will need to take the<br/>
ACT..and do whatever that college requires, but will cross that bridge when<br/>
and if she gets there.<br/>
<br/>
Emily has always been very Art and Science oriented. For example,<br/>
MO law states that &#39;science&#39; must be taught each year, but it doesn&#39;t say<br/>
what sort of science. She has mostly studied biology, with a special<br/>
interest in Reptiles and Amphibians.. Also Botany, mainly mushrooms, ferns<br/>
and tree grafting.<br/>
<br/>
She and I have both kept journals over the years, so I am confident that I<br/>
could come up with plenty of evidence that learning is and has taken place,<br/>
if I was ever pressed to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure your niece will need some &#39;down time&#39;..to figure out what she is<br/>
interested in, what direction she wants to go, and to realize that she can<br/>
think and chose for herself now. I highly recommend the &quot;Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook&quot; and &quot;Real Lives, eleven teenagers who don&#39;t go to school&quot; both are<br/>
by Grace Llewellyn.<br/>
