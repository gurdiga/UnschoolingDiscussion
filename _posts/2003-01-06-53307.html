<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; I knew a lot of guys who<br/>
&gt; were drafted into the Vietnam war, and the socialization they<br/>
&gt; reported was mostly of the negative variety... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have far deeper concerns.  From my vantage point (and it&#39;s a pretty good<br/>
one, these days, living 5 minutes from the barracks), the army has stress<br/>
and morale problems, which tend to manifest themselves in anger, violence,<br/>
drunkeness, drug use, suicide, and a lot of other ugly ways.<br/>
<br/>
And these are people who *volunteered* to be in the army.  Just imagine how<br/>
wonderful it would be if we added a whole lot of folks who didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
there in the first place.  And just how wonderfully socialized they&#39;d be.<br/>
