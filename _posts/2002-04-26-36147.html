<div id="ygrps-yiv-411030737"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My 10 yos thinks&quot;If those kids don&#39;t have to do schoolwork, they must not <br/>
&gt;&gt;learn anything!  I don&#39;t want to not learn anything.&quot;  He&#39;s also the one <br/>
&gt;&gt;who had a bad school experience and really shies away from learning.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really feel for your dear, sweet boy, Sandra! It sounds like he&#39;s been <br/>
told (by the school system) that there&#39;s one &quot;right&quot; way to learn. If he <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy, or get much out of the way school does things, then of course <br/>
he&#39;s going to think it&#39;s something that has to be assigned or forced on him.<br/>
<br/>
My Conor also does NOT learn in the ways schools teach. But he&#39;s come to <br/>
understand that he learns just fine in his own way. Your son will too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I honestly think that he thinks that if you unschool, it means that the <br/>
&gt;&gt;whole family sits on the couch and watches cartoons all day or <br/>
&gt;&gt;something.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some days we do and that&#39;s okay! We&#39;re still talking to each other and <br/>
making observations and connections and noticing the background music and <br/>
thinking about who did the voices and wondering what other things that <br/>
person did and wondering when that cartoon was created and on and on. Or <br/>
we&#39;re just vegging and having some quiet time. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On other days we go to museums or parks or aquariums or the library or a <br/>
friend&#39;s house or digging in the dirt or to a play or a movie or....the list <br/>
is endless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My 12 yod sees &quot;Freedom, this is the best thing ever!  All kids should be <br/>
&gt;&gt;taught this way.  I mean it just makes sooo much sense.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241504490">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I am Cat (37) married to David (43), mother of L (5) and J (10 mos). We live in Pittsburgh, PA.<br/>
<br/>
 I knew that I would homeschool as soon as I learned (sometime in my 20&#39;s I think)that it was legal.  I was one of those unhappy straight-A students that were being discussed recently -- I knew that I didnt&#39; want that for my children.  I had in mind a far more &quot;schooly&quot; version of homeschooling, however.   Now, as I watch myu children grow and learn it is clear that unschooling is the path most compatible with the way we live and our beliefs about the treatment of children.  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to participating in this list.<br/>
<br/>
  -Cat <br/>

<br/>
My daughter is calling herself Kat now. I grew up south of Pittsburgh, in<br/>
Pleasant Hills and went to CMU. Where abouts in Pittsburgh are you?<br/>
