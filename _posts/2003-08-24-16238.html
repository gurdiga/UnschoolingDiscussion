<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558260839">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Maybe everyone else knows about this, but as a new home/unschooler I <br/>
just discovered the &#39;Alliance for Separation of School and State&#39;, <br/>
www.sepschool.org. <br/>
<br/>
Their main distinctive is their short but sweet Proclamation they ask anyone <br/>
(including older children!) to sign (aiming for 1 million signatures), <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I proclaim publicly that I am in favor of ending government involvement in <br/>
education.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Then they post all the signers&#39; names and cities; I found it very encouraging <br/>
to see these names, some well-known, others not, from all different states, <br/>
professions, and affiliations. <br/>
<br/>
No, they&#39;re not all unschoolers, I&#39;m sure, and this isn&#39;t advocating getting rid <br/>
of all schools; but getting government (and our tax dollars and the teachers&#39; <br/>
unions) out of the arena would be a huge step in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>

P.S. I think their humor page is good, too: <br/>

The free man owns himself. He can damage himself with either eating or <br/>
drinking; he can ruin himself with gambling. If he does he is certainly a <br/>
damn fool, and he might possibly be a damned soul; but if he may not, he is <br/>
not a free man any more than a dog.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605170747">I&#39;m not against the government being involved in education, but I would love to see compulsory attendance and testing go away.  Turn the schools into resource centers - more like libraries, less like prisons.  MHO<br/>
<br/>
Did anybody read The Road Less Traveled in the latest HEM?  I loved the baseball analogy.<br/>

I really liked Sandra&#39;s article about late readers too.  My mom was just harping on me again about my just turned 8 yod not reading.  She can&#39;t understand why I&#39;m not concerned.  I will definitely give her a copy of that article.<br/>

Is it just me, or are there more trolls playing on homeschooling lists these<br/>
days?  Not that I have any particular beef against SepSchool, but this is a<br/>
classic hit-and-run advertisement.  Sheesh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444306899">Speaking of late readers, my wife and I just discovered Late-talking <br/>
Children and The Einstein Syndrome (so-named because Einstein was a <br/>
late-talker).  They are written by the father of a late-talking child (4 yrs old, if <br/>
I remember correctly), discuss the common traumas that families of these <br/>
children tend to go through (emotional, familial, professional, etc..), stories <br/>
from families, etc...   Extremely encouraging, hopeful, and helpful.<br/>
<br/>
If I knew someone else who had a late-talking child, I would definitely <br/>
recommend or loan them these books.<br/>
<br/>
(And no, this isn&#39;t an add.  Just some helpful information.)<br/>
