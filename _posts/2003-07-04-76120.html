<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; does anyone ever say anything about you going out without the<br/>
&gt;&gt; children, as a couple that is?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They say, &quot;Where are the boys?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We took Tim everywhere when he was a baby.  When we did actually leave him<br/>
with a friend for a couple hours, to go to a church function, I think<br/>
probably 200 people that night asked us where the baby was.<br/>
<br/>
It got to the point that my smart-ass husband started saying things like,<br/>
&quot;Baby?  Brenda!  I thought you had the baby!!!  Oh my gosh!&quot;.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
been so ready to kill someone, though I wasn&#39;t sure if I should go for him<br/>
or for the other people!<br/>
<br/>
To this day, if I don&#39;t bring Tim someplace, people ask where he is.  And I<br/>
do hire babysitters regularly when my husband is away, or I lose my mind.<br/>
At six, he now thinks the undivided attention of a teenager is pretty cool.<br/>
