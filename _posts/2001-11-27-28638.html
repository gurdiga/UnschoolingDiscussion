<div id="ygrps-yiv-624773967">I received the following on another HSing list. I replied as an UNschooler<br/>
adn encourage others to respond to help them develop a fun product rather<br/>
than a third grade in a laptop product!<br/>
My response follows<br/>

Hi Meghan,,<br/>
I am a homeschooling mom and would love to answer any questions your team<br/>
may have. You may call me - (301) 916-XXXX.<br/>
May I suggest one thing first? There are many, many homeschooling<br/>
curriculums out there that tend to focus on Book learning. Many<br/>
homeschoolers have moved beyond the teaching/learning styles that are used<br/>
in schools since most of those styles were developed  to teach a large<br/>
number of students at one time.The average HSing family (if there is such a<br/>
mythical beast) has far fewer children. Many of those teaching techniques<br/>
don&#39;t apply. My suggestion is for your team to read or even just skim<br/>
through a few books on learning outside of the classroom. I heartily<br/>
recommend two of John Holt&#39;s books, How Children Fail and How Children<br/>
Learn, and The Unschooling Handbook By Mary Griffith. These three books will<br/>
give you an insight into how learning happens naturally and I believe it<br/>
will contribute immensely to your development of this product.<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Elissa J. Cleaveland</div>
