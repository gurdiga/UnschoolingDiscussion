<div id="ygrps-yiv-470716584">&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know what they are called either, ( the name brands) but I have<br/>
seen<br/>
those products at the pet supply store. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just throwing this out to you:<br/>
My MIL gets a suppliment she really likes from gardens alive, called pets alive. <br/>

&quot;Pets Alive! is a special blend of high-nutrient ingredients - including dried yeast, garlic, wheat germ and bran, kelp and bone meal - formulated to promote a happier, healthier pet. Most of all, it&#39;s very effective in quieting the annoying, frustrating and painful itch that drives dogs and cats (and their patient owners) to distraction! &quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I guess the yeast would act as an enzime but I&#39;m not sure it would help him not eat his &quot;doodie&quot; LOL if that is what the cause is. I think the garlic is a good natural preventitive for fleas as well as well as being good for them.<br/>
