<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329606966">I have two kids who&#39;ve asked me to help them complete goals they have<br/>
for themselves. One of them is 11 and he is a leftie. He struggles<br/>
with handwriting. He keyboards very well and he likes to copy poetry.<br/>
So he&#39;s done that off and on according to his own interests for the<br/>
last several years.<br/>
<br/>
Just last week, he went paintballing and had to fill out one of those<br/>
little forms. His writing couldn&#39;t fit in the lines. I wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
He went with his dad.<br/>
<br/>
He came home and told me he wanted to work on handwriting and would I<br/>
help him. He said it would be nice to be able to draw well (he wants<br/>
to work for Wizards of the Coast some day desigining gaming cards...)<br/>
and to have &quot;beautiful handwriting&quot; (his words). :)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the thing.<br/>
<br/>
I want to help him without it becoming a chore. I talked with him<br/>
about what feels like the best approach and he gave me ideas. He began<br/>
on his own yesterday. Thing is, this isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s brought<br/>
up wanting to work on handwriting. We&#39;ve moved downt hat path before<br/>
but then he gets frustrated and stops. I&#39;ve not interfered figruing at<br/>
some point when he&#39;s ready he&#39;ll learn or not. Not that big a deal to me.<br/>
<br/>
But since it matters to him and since he talks about how he wishes<br/>
he&#39;d stick with his goals, I wondered if there is more I can do to<br/>
support him without it becoming school-y or coercive...<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? <br/>
<br/>
I have another kid who asks for help in reaching his goals then quits<br/>
then hates himself for quitting and then wishes I&#39;d have made him<br/>
finish... bad cycle.<br/>
<br/>
So how do you all handle this?<br/>

I can&#39;t make the conference link work right now, or I&#39;d copy and paste <br/>
it, but Ren&#39;s description of her funshop has a great link.<br/>

the right (hard for lefties it seems) and say &quot;no hurry, just mess with it when <br/>
you want to and let me know when you want something else.&quot;   Don&#39;t let him <br/>
put the responsibility on you. If he really DOES get good at a line of <br/>
repetitive circly stuff, move to loopy stuff or m n m n m n (if he&#39;s wanting connected <br/>
cursive).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe find something he likes like lyrics to a song or a poem and ask him to <br/>
have that as a project.   He could practice lines or words from that (not the <br/>
full thing at once, at first, unless he just wanted to).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026814524">Templates! That&#39;s a great idea. I have a hunch my son might have that<br/>
processing issue you mentioned. He so wants to do it well. He made a<br/>
notebook last year of an island chain with maps, flags, weaponry,<br/>
naval fleets etc. His handwriting was scrawling and big. But if you<br/>
look at it closely, each letter has this unique shape. He follows the<br/>
print the way it&#39;s typed so his &#39;a&#39;s look like a typewritten &#39;a&#39; and<br/>
he makes his &#39;g&#39;s like they are in standard type too.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s observant to those kinds of details but is struggling to make the<br/>
translation from what his mind sees to what his hand can do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try this, thanks. Drafting supply stores... will have to figure<br/>
out where one might be.<br/>

&gt; finish... bad cycle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Goals like improved handwriting?<br/>
<br/>
There is something in your description of the kids setting goals that  <br/>
is bothering me - making me itch a little.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear what the other goals are like - the kinds of goals  <br/>
the other child is &quot;quitting&quot; and then hating himself for quitting.<br/>
<br/>
Those are some STRONG words you used.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m torn, in answering, because of this odd itchy feeling your post  <br/>
is giving me. I know one thing that&#39;s bothering me, a little, though  <br/>
- that is the way you described his asking for help to help him  <br/>
improve his handwriting. I&#39;d expect to hear about the ways HE has  <br/>
decided to go about doing it - it isn&#39;t at all hard for an 11 yo kid  <br/>
to figure out how to improve his own handwriting - to come up with  <br/>
ways to do that. So it is giving me pause that he&#39;s coming to you for  <br/>
help as he is. I mean - he could come and say, &quot;I need you to write  <br/>
something for me to trace,&quot; or &quot;Write the letters for me so I can see  <br/>
what good handwriting looks like.&quot; Or he could come and say, &quot;I want  <br/>
to buy a handwriting workbook.&quot; Or there are MANY things he might ask  <br/>
you, Julie. But - there is something overly helpless in the way you  <br/>
described him asking AND here you are asking us. It is like you&#39;re  <br/>
going to take charge - come up with a system of learning FOR him.<br/>
<br/>
IF that is the way your other son&#39;s goals have been approached, then  <br/>
ONE reason they&#39;ve failed is because they were too much yours and not  <br/>
enough his own.<br/>
<br/>
The way you know someone is serious about achieving a goal is that  <br/>
THEY come up with the steps to do so and THEY work on the first step  <br/>
until they succeed and then THEY move on to the second.<br/>
<br/>
But I have a feeling you&#39;re getting involved too quickly. I know  <br/>
there is a fine line between being supportive and getting too  <br/>
involved - but I just have this underlying feeling that you&#39;re doing  <br/>
the latter.<br/>
<br/>
So - oddly enough - my suggestion for you is to back off.<br/>
<br/>
You can casually say, &quot;Oh - don&#39;t get too worried about it - LOTS of  <br/>
really brilliant successful people have trouble with handwriting,&quot;  <br/>
And if he insists that he wants some &quot;system&quot; for improving his, you  <br/>
can say, &quot;Handwriting usually just gets better with practice and as  <br/>
people get older.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel like you&#39;re taking over the MOST important part of this - the  <br/>
process of figuring out how to respond, himself, to his OWN feelings,  <br/>
urges, desires - how to figure out how to get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my daughters had come to me and said, &quot;I want to learn to  <br/>
read,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t immediately start trying to figure out some system  <br/>
for helping her learn to read. I&#39;d say, &quot;I know. You will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just have this feeling that you&#39;re taking over the goals - at least  <br/>
just a bit. Maybe you&#39;re worried about his poor penmanship and just a  <br/>
little too pleased at the chance that he&#39;ll improve it?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that what both kids sound like they need to learn is not  <br/>
how to achieve their goals, but how to relax and let the learning  <br/>
happen naturally. Too much &quot;goal-setting&#39; for young kids who are  <br/>
better off living in the here and now and not feeling ashamed or  <br/>
guilty (and therefore hating themselves) and too much thinking YOU  <br/>
have responsibility for their learning. You&#39;re just not really away  <br/>
from that mindset far enough - that&#39;s what is making me itchy.<br/>
<br/>
The best &quot;help&quot; you could give him would be NOT to step in and  <br/>
organize his learning for him - but to just say encouraging things  <br/>
like, &quot;You&#39;ll learn. It&#39;ll happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Respond to his SPECIFIC requests, of course. But I think you have to  <br/>
lay off MORE than some other people, at least for a while, because  <br/>
your kids are still asking you to be responsible for their learning.  <br/>
So even offering a whole list of possible ideas of how he can improve  <br/>
his handwriting - and letting him decide which of your ideas he might  <br/>
choose to try to reach his goals - I think that is coming across as  <br/>
handing the responsibility over to you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - and I&#39;m also going to guess that he really doesn&#39;t, in fact,  <br/>
want to spend time working to improve his handwriting. He just wants  <br/>
it to be better. Those are different.<br/>
<br/>
I want to BE a good horse rider.<br/>
My daughter wants to LEARN to be a good rider.<br/>
<br/>
I seldom get on a horse.<br/>
She spent hours and hours, several days per week, ON  a horse.<br/>
<br/>
Your son wants to HAVE good handwriting.<br/>
You&#39;re interpreting that as if he wants to LEARN to have good  <br/>
handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
When I say I want to BE a good horse rider, I really don&#39;t need  <br/>
anybody to give me a list of options as to how I could learn to be a  <br/>
good rider. If I really wanted to LEARN to ride, I&#39;d be figuring out  <br/>
how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re jumping in with ideas of how to improve his  <br/>
handwriting - but if he really wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d  <br/>
be figuring out how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t that hard to tell the difference between a kid wanting to  <br/>
learn something versus just wishing they KNEW something. Sounds like  <br/>
you need to be more aware of that difference and not respond to the  <br/>
latter - you really need to let them have that experience of wishing  <br/>
they knew something but not really wanting to spend time or energy  <br/>
learning it.<br/>
<br/>
If he wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d be WRITING all the time,  <br/>
trying to do it better and better. It would be on his OWN initiative,  <br/>
he would not need to ask you for help with that unless he needed you  <br/>
to get him paper or pens or something concrete like help him find  <br/>
writing samples to trace or copy.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter wanted to LEARN to ride horses, she asked for a  <br/>
horse! &lt;G&gt; Pretty concrete. She said, &quot;I want to find somewhere that  <br/>
I can ride horses.&quot; Okay - that is a specific request and I was able  <br/>
to help her with THAT one.<br/>
<br/>
When your son asks for paper and pens to practice his handwriting -  <br/>
help him with that. Be really careful that you&#39;re not making too big  <br/>
a deal out of &quot;goals.&quot;<br/>

I agree with this.  I have above average handwriting and have done <br/>
caligraphy, and there are some blanks on forms that are just too darn <br/>
small to fill out.  I was filling out one this week that was like that.  <br/>
Sometimes people designing forms just keep squishing and squishing, <br/>
rather than add a second page.<br/>

&quot;do&quot;, and things that we just want to get done or have done.  I want to <br/>
have done the weeding in the back, but I surely don&#39;t want to do it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also think with handwriting, one or two practice sessions may be all <br/>
he can do before running into limitations with his finger control at <br/>
this age.  Stopping then, and coming back to it later, isn&#39;t quitting, <br/>
it&#39;s good strategy.  Maybe help him learn not to beat himself up?  <br/>
(Probably difficult, but a great topic we can explore here.)<br/>

you want to and let me know when you want something else.&quot;   Don&#39;t let him <br/>
put the responsibility on you. If he really DOES get good at a line of <br/>
repetitive circly stuff, move to loopy stuff or m n m n m n (if he&#39;s wanting connected <br/>
cursive).&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

I have some nice calligraphy supplies (hand me down from my mom who made greeting cards and wedding invitations for awhile).  One of the things is lined paper in many different widths.  It can be used for practice or to put underneath the paper you are writing on.  He *might* enjoy playing around with something like that.  My girls dig it out now and then.  I suppose it isn&#39;t that different from the pads they sell in school supplies with bigger lines for littler kids and little lines for bigger kids, except that the calligraphy is real and grown up while the exercise pads tend to be schooly.<br/>
<br/>
I remember that my mom often did her work in larger sizes, then used copy machines to shrink it down.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to mention to him that some adults who can write quite nicely still have a difficult time writing in the tiny spaces that are sometimes provided on forms!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is hard to separate when kids want to achieve a goal because they want it, and when it is driven by others saying things that make the child feel they *should* be able to achieve it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269682669">I think templates are more expensive and inflexible than you need.   <br/>
Workbooks (disposable and cheap) might be better, if you really want to get him <br/>
samples he can practice with/on/in.<br/>
<br/>
Marty told me he was in a conversation a few weeks back and the group he was <br/>
with needed someone to take notes on whatever brilliant plans they were coming <br/>
up with or something.   Marty said his handwriting wasn&#39;t very good (and so <br/>
he was dis-volunteering to be the notetaker).   Two of the other kids asked <br/>
why, but he said they weren&#39;t being critical, and he said that he&#39;d never had a <br/>
reason to need to have good handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, over at the pizza place, a lot of Kirby&#39;s job is taking phone <br/>
orders down, and so he&#39;s getting the first extended real-time handwriting practice <br/>
of his life.   If he could type it, computer-keyboard-and-print, he&#39;d be a <br/>
whiz.    The other most time-critical writing has been when he&#39;s judged karate <br/>
belt tests and needed to put comments after scores.   Luckily for those forms, <br/>
Kirby writes tiny.   Luckily for Kirby, part of the discipline and tradition <br/>
of the tests is waiting for the judges to finish writing.<br/>

It&#39;s not for beginners. <br/>

Neither are fountain pens.   Except for wedge-cut felt tip pens, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>

But as to reduction, Kirby&#39;s birth announcement was a family tree and I wrote <br/>
all the names the same size, then reduced them all the various amounts, and <br/>
pasted it up (smaller toward grandparents) and then had the chosen girl name <br/>

&gt; &gt; finish... bad cycle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Goals like improved handwriting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually no. My oldest is working on that NaNoWriMo goal (writing a<br/>
novel in a month). It was his idea, he bought the book for himself and<br/>
begged me to do it with him (I was going to wait until Jan. to do it<br/>
myself).<br/>
<br/>
So I said sure.<br/>
<br/>
He is struggling to finish and I said it was fine if he didn&#39;t finish<br/>
or keep the word count etc. since this was for fun and he had enjoyed<br/>
it to that point.<br/>
<br/>
But it was then that he started talking about the things he has wanted<br/>
to finish but doesn&#39;t when they get hard or boring...<br/>
<br/>
Examples: websites he started building and stopped, languages he<br/>
studies for awhile and then gets tired and stops, practicing pieces on<br/>
the piano until they are mastered and can be played at will (he plays<br/>
often and I think really well, but he thinks he is not good enough and<br/>
wants more facility but gets tired of working on the same thing over<br/>
and over again), playing lacrosse, unicycling, rock climbing, computer<br/>
games, X box levels, Magic...<br/>
<br/>
He hits a threshhold where he finds it too demanding of repetitious<br/>
hard work (the uninspired kind) and then doesn&#39;t finish... even the<br/>
stuff he really loves.<br/>
<br/>
We had a long heart to heart where I reframed things for him - showing<br/>
him that he is learning all the time things that he values, that<br/>
mastery doesn&#39;t mean perfection, that sometimes we cycle around things<br/>
and do them a bit and then come back on our own time table, that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to &quot;set goals&quot; but can enjoy the processes... that kind<br/>
of thing.<br/>
<br/>
But he&#39;s struggled with not feeling like he fits in or finishes things<br/>
for a long time. It might be a hold over from years ago when we<br/>
homeschooled more traditionally, but honestly, things have changed so<br/>
much for him in the last few years that that doesn&#39;t make sense to me<br/>
now. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, he doesn&#39;t feel badly at all about not finishing<br/>
chemistry or quitting a math class or not going to college and I don&#39;t<br/>
either. It&#39;s these things he enjoys... and then feels like he can&#39;t<br/>
complete. He has this strong inner critic and he tells me the way he<br/>
deals with it is to just quit. But later then he&#39;s bummed that he has<br/>
let it slide and feels too distant from the first impulse to go back<br/>
and finish. So he&#39;ll start a related project and the whole cycle<br/>
repeats itself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; There is something in your description of the kids setting goals that  <br/>
&gt; is bothering me - making me itch a little.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to hear what the other goals are like - the kinds of goals  <br/>
&gt; the other child is &quot;quitting&quot; and then hating himself for quitting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Those are some STRONG words you used.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m torn, in answering, because of this odd itchy feeling your post  <br/>
&gt; is giving me. I know one thing that&#39;s bothering me, a little, though  <br/>
&gt; - that is the way you described his asking for help to help him  <br/>
&gt; improve his handwriting. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my other son (who is 11). He&#39;s been totally unschooled for<br/>
three years. He spends his time on the computer and X Box. And I&#39;ve<br/>
been totally fine with it. Really.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d expect to hear about the ways HE has  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; decided to go about doing it - it isn&#39;t at all hard for an 11 yo kid  <br/>
&gt; to figure out how to improve his own handwriting - to come up with  <br/>
&gt; ways to do that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He did. He came and asked me for a pen, a notebook and the cookbook<br/>
stand to put his poetry book in.<br/>
<br/>
He got frustrated with the look of his writing and asked if I could<br/>
help him with the lettering. He really doesn&#39;t have a handle yet on<br/>
the formation of the letters when he writes them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 So it is giving me pause that he&#39;s coming to you for  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; help as he is. I mean - he could come and say, &quot;I need you to write  <br/>
&gt; something for me to trace,&quot; or &quot;Write the letters for me so I can see  <br/>
&gt; what good handwriting looks like.&quot; Or he could come and say, &quot;I want  <br/>
&gt; to buy a handwriting workbook.&quot; Or there are MANY things he might ask  <br/>
&gt; you, Julie. But - there is something overly helpless in the way you  <br/>
&gt; described him asking AND here you are asking us. It is like you&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; going to take charge - come up with a system of learning FOR him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
So if you have a kid who asks you for help, what do you do? Just put<br/>
it back on him and see what happens?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; IF that is the way your other son&#39;s goals have been approached, then  <br/>
&gt; ONE reason they&#39;ve failed is because they were too much yours and not  <br/>
&gt; enough his own.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know this well enough to know not to make it my goal for him. Yes.<br/>
He&#39;s always been the most sensitive to anyone controlling his time or<br/>
behavior. <br/>
<br/>
So maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m here asking. I don&#39;t typically structure his<br/>
life at all. We read aloud because he loves it, we read poetry<br/>
frequently (he loves teatimes where we read poetry), we bird watch, he<br/>
plays his games. He made a notebook last year with an island chain<br/>
that he created and would ask me to help him to work on it since it<br/>
involved writing. I did.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s asking for help with handwriting so I want to be a help, not<br/>
an unwitting hindrance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The way you know someone is serious about achieving a goal is that  <br/>
&gt; THEY come up with the steps to do so and THEY work on the first step  <br/>
&gt; until they succeed and then THEY move on to the second.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do kids already know the steps for learning to handwrite comfortably<br/>
and beautifully? I thought my job is to help provide resources and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; But I have a feeling you&#39;re getting involved too quickly. I know  <br/>
&gt; there is a fine line between being supportive and getting too  <br/>
&gt; involved - but I just have this underlying feeling that you&#39;re doing  <br/>
&gt; the latter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - oddly enough - my suggestion for you is to back off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can casually say, &quot;Oh - don&#39;t get too worried about it - LOTS of  <br/>
&gt; really brilliant successful people have trouble with handwriting,&quot;  <br/>
&gt; And if he insists that he wants some &quot;system&quot; for improving his, you  <br/>
&gt; can say, &quot;Handwriting usually just gets better with practice and as  <br/>
&gt; people get older.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm. Okay. So even though this has been how I&#39;ve handled it for the<br/>
last two years, I ought to keep going.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel like you&#39;re taking over the MOST important part of this - the  <br/>
&gt; process of figuring out how to respond, himself, to his OWN feelings,  <br/>
&gt; urges, desires - how to figure out how to get what he wants.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If one of my daughters had come to me and said, &quot;I want to learn to  <br/>
&gt; read,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t immediately start trying to figure out some system  <br/>
&gt; for helping her learn to read. I&#39;d say, &quot;I know. You will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow. Really?<br/>
<br/>
Okay that is really new to me. My daughter is nearly nine, not reading<br/>
fluently at all. When she asks for help, I&#39;ve helped her. She&#39;s<br/>
struggled all along so when it&#39;s hard I suggest letting it go and<br/>
waiting until she feels ready to try again. I always assure her that<br/>
she&#39;ll read. But it never occurred to me to do nothing at all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I just have this feeling that you&#39;re taking over the goals - at least  <br/>
&gt; just a bit. Maybe you&#39;re worried about his poor penmanship and just a  <br/>
&gt; little too pleased at the chance that he&#39;ll improve it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Worried... Hmmm. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m worried. I was happy he wanted to<br/>
improve it mostly because it was touching to me that he came up with<br/>
that idea himself. I haven&#39;t had a kid have that impulse before<br/>
because I had always scheduled handwriting before I fully unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking that what both kids sound like they need to learn is not  <br/>
&gt; how to achieve their goals, but how to relax and let the learning  <br/>
&gt; happen naturally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After reading my older son&#39;s description, would you still say this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Too much &quot;goal-setting&#39; for young kids who are  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; better off living in the here and now and not feeling ashamed or  <br/>
&gt; guilty (and therefore hating themselves) and too much thinking YOU  <br/>
&gt; have responsibility for their learning. You&#39;re just not really away  <br/>
&gt; from that mindset far enough - that&#39;s what is making me itchy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Got it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; The best &quot;help&quot; you could give him would be NOT to step in and  <br/>
&gt; organize his learning for him - but to just say encouraging things  <br/>
&gt; like, &quot;You&#39;ll learn. It&#39;ll happen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Respond to his SPECIFIC requests, of course. But I think you have to  <br/>
&gt; lay off MORE than some other people, at least for a while, because  <br/>
&gt; your kids are still asking you to be responsible for their learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is very true. Thank you for putting it like this. I can<br/>
see this.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So even offering a whole list of possible ideas of how he can improve  <br/>
&gt; his handwriting - and letting him decide which of your ideas he might  <br/>
&gt; choose to try to reach his goals - I think that is coming across as  <br/>
&gt; handing the responsibility over to you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Okay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh - and I&#39;m also going to guess that he really doesn&#39;t, in fact,  <br/>
&gt; want to spend time working to improve his handwriting. He just wants  <br/>
&gt; it to be better. Those are different.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lol! Well, we&#39;ll see, right? He wrote for fifteen minutes all on his<br/>
own yesterday with no prompting from anyone and then put it away<br/>
without even showing it to me. That spoke volumes to me. I found the<br/>
notebook on the couch and noticed he had written an entire poem (which<br/>
is hard for him).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Your son wants to HAVE good handwriting.<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re interpreting that as if he wants to LEARN to have good  <br/>
&gt; handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, he did say he wants to &quot;work on his handwriting because it<br/>
would be cool to have beauitful handwriting&quot; (those are his exact words).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I think you&#39;re jumping in with ideas of how to improve his  <br/>
&gt; handwriting - but if he really wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d  <br/>
&gt; be figuring out how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; If he wanted to LEARN to write better, he&#39;d be WRITING all the time,  <br/>
&gt; trying to do it better and better. It would be on his OWN initiative,  <br/>
&gt; he would not need to ask you for help with that unless he needed you  <br/>
&gt; to get him paper or pens or something concrete like help him find  <br/>
&gt; writing samples to trace or copy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is precisely what he asked for. I think what I was wondering (and<br/>
you&#39;ve now answered it) is if I needed to remind him of the goal he<br/>
set for himself when it got hard. I think what you are saying is to<br/>
let it be totally his goal, whether he goes after it or not. I don&#39;t<br/>
need to &quot;hold&quot; his goal for him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; When your son asks for paper and pens to practice his handwriting -  <br/>
&gt; help him with that. Be really careful that you&#39;re not making too big  <br/>
&gt; a deal out of &quot;goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great. got it. Thanks that was helpful. If you have something to say<br/>
about my older son (18) that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
I told him recently that I didn&#39;t think he should be relying on me to<br/>
help him reach his goals - that he will have to work out what it is in<br/>
him that helps him get there. I&#39;m wondering if from reading your post<br/>
here if he has internalized me as his goal-keeping partner that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t yet know what it is to finish what he cares about without<br/>
depending on someone else to push him, remind him, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d do what you did, reframe the situation so that it shows learning and <br/>
success, not failure-to-finish.<br/>
<br/>
My husband gets frustrated with not finishing projects, but those he finishes <br/>
are great, and those he doesn&#39;t give him experience (sometimes with how not <br/>
to do it next time) and knowledge for future projects.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
But he&#39;s struggled with not feeling like he fits in-=-<br/>
<br/>
Fits in where?   How?<br/>
<br/>
-=- It might be a hold over from years ago when we<br/>
homeschooled more traditionally, but honestly, things have changed so<br/>
much for him in the last few years that that doesn&#39;t make sense to me<br/>
now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cognitive stuff doesn&#39;t undo itself.   <br/>
<br/>
Even if you feel he deschooled, if his beliefs haven&#39;t changed, just his <br/>
actions, then reason with him with examples from his own experiences.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Actually no. My oldest is working on that NaNoWriMo goal (writing a<br/>
novel in a month). It was his idea, he bought the book for himself and<br/>
begged me to do it with him (I was going to wait until Jan. to do it<br/>

<br/>
So I said sure.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your mistake was saying &quot;Sure&quot; instead of &quot;Maybe,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m going to <br/>
try, but I don&#39;t care whether I don&#39;t finish,&quot; or &quot;Not if you&#39;re going to melt <br/>
down if you don&#39;t make the deadline.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s these things he enjoys... and then feels like he can&#39;t<br/>
complete.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why is enjoyment all cancelled out with lack of completion?   I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
encourage that.<br/>
<br/>
And why can&#39;t he &quot;finish&quot; them later?<br/>
<br/>
-=- But later then he&#39;s bummed that he has<br/>
let it slide and feels too distant from the first impulse to go back<br/>
and finish. So he&#39;ll start a related project and the whole cycle<br/>
repeats itself.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not it doesn&#39;t &quot;repeat itself,&quot; or it wouldn&#39;t if he could be helped to see <br/>
each one as something that was fun in the moment and didn&#39;t NEED to be <br/>
completed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So if you have a kid who asks you for help, what do you do? Just put<br/>
it back on him and see what happens?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re asking Pam Sorooshian that?    She&#39;s been sharing stuff about her <br/>
family for maybe ten years.   Let&#39;s not be sarcastic.<br/>
<br/>
And be careful with that word &quot;just.&quot;   The recommendation was not that you <br/>
&quot;JUST&quot; leave the responsibility with him.   You&#39;ve misinterpreted if you think <br/>
Pam said &quot;put it back on him.&quot;   But Pam has interpreted rightly, then, I <br/>
think, because you seem to see it as something he had put on you that you can <br/>
either keep (the responsibility) or put it back on him.<br/>
<br/>
Too much putting, not enough enjoyment and learning and playing.<br/>

If he wants to play around with writing (penmanship or novels or instant <br/>
messages) that&#39;s great.    Playing doesn&#39;t need to be &quot;finished.&quot;    It is of the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know this well enough to know not to make it my goal for him.-=-<br/>

she&#39;ll read. But it never occurred to me to do nothing at all.<br/>

It didn&#39;t seem you were writing about or asking about natural learning.   You <br/>

let it be totally his goal, whether he goes after it or not. I don&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056825372"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; I told him recently that I didn&#39;t think he should be relying on me to<br/>

&gt; him that helps him get there. I&#39;m wondering if from reading your post<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pam, I&#39;m responding to myself here but hope you&#39;ll chime in (or anyone).<br/>
<br/>
I was reflecting back on some of my conversations with my oldest. I<br/>
know I have put pressure on him in the past to complete things. Not<br/>
this year. But I&#39;m wondering how much he evaluates his relationship to<br/>
the things he loves through an old tape of my talking to him about<br/>
finishing things he *didn&#39;t* enjoy. So in other words, perhaps he&#39;s<br/>
applied my way of thinking about stuff that we expected of him in<br/>
school or chores before unschooling and has applied that to his<br/>
pleasures as well.<br/>
<br/>
Also, his Meyer&#39;s Briggs temperament says that these types typically<br/>
are brilliant in their area of talent but also are hyper critical of<br/>
self and as a result have trouble sustaining their efforts when the<br/>
impulse wanes. <br/>
<br/>
So some of this may be natural to him, some comes from me and how I&#39;ve<br/>
influenced how he sees himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to change that!! So I&#39;m interested in ideas.<br/>

<br/>
But  since it matters to him and since he talks about how he wishes<br/>
he&#39;d stick  with his goals, I wondered if there is more I can do to<br/>
support him without  it becoming school-y or coercive...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
I have an 11 yo son, too.  He doesn&#39;t set too many long  range goals (except <br/>
to play in the Majors--really looong range). So I can&#39;t  help you with that.  <br/>
I got to thinking this might not be about goal  setting, but more about <br/>
readiness to write.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son also has very illegible handwriting and he can&#39;t  write in small <br/>
spaces (like registration cards).  He holds any writing  instrument with his thumb <br/>
and all 4 fingers (not in his fist, but between his  thumb and pinkie and the <br/>
other three fingers stacked up the pencil).  That  method is really bad for <br/>
making fine details.  He&#39;s been doing it that way  since he started drawing at 2 <br/>
or 3, and resisted my attempts to show him an  easier way, so I&#39;ve let it go <br/>
for years.<br/>
 <br/>
  He is always amazed in a &quot;wish I could do that&quot;  way at how fast I write <br/>
when he sees me write something.  Early  on I attributed his inability to not <br/>
being literate, and then not knowing a lot  of spelling (having to think about <br/>
it too much).  Then when he could read  and spell, it would occur to me that <br/>
the physical part was in the way,  too.  Then there&#39;s the desire aspect.  He <br/>
just wasn&#39;t ready, in some  way or another.  So, I usually just said something <br/>
like, &quot;Oh,  you&#39;ll be able to write as fast as you need to, someday&quot;.  Sometimes <br/>
 we&#39;d have a conversation about why he thought he couldn&#39;t write that fast, <br/>
and  I&#39;d reassure him that some day his muscles in his hand and his ability to <br/>
get  his words down to his fingertips would develop eventually.  Just like his <br/>
 pitching arm has gotten faster and his hand able to grip the ball for <br/>
different  pitches as he got older and bigger (to put it in a perspective he can  <br/>
understand &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
 <br/>
Just the other day, we were talking about it,  again.  The dental hygenist <br/>
found out he was homeschooled and  asked him a math question in the context of <br/>
the treatment (hours in a  day divided by (12) hours it takes bacteria to <br/>
colonize = how  many times a day you must brush your teeth).  At the end of  the <br/>
exam she gave him a reminder card to fill out write his  address on.  He handed <br/>
it to me and I filled it out, even though it was  clear she wanted him to do <br/>
it.  When he gave it to me, he said, &quot;You know  more of this information than I <br/>
do.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
In the car he brought it up again, how he doesn&#39;t feel  comfortable writing <br/>
too much.  This time it was about the way he holds his  pencil.  He said, <br/>
&quot;Maybe I oughta try holding it the way you do.  My  hand gets sore when I do it the <br/>
way I do it.&quot;  That was his first hint  *ever* that he thought there might be <br/>
some validity to a different way to do it  other than &quot;his&quot; way.  When he <br/>
first really resisted when he was 2 or 3, I  just told him his way was fine for <br/>
him, and other people did it  differently.  He just grabbed on to that &quot;my <br/>
way!&quot; and never let go.   I never pushed it, although I did occasionally suggest <br/>
it might be better this  way or that way if I was helping him with something.<br/>
 <br/>
I attribute his change of heart to maturity and  readiness.  Some people can <br/>
pick something up right away...it&#39;s  natural for them.  With some, it&#39;s more <br/>
of a developmental  thing.  I&#39;m happy I never made Will do handwriting lessons. <br/>
 I&#39;m happy  that he had the guts and determination to say &quot;his way&quot; was best <br/>
for him,  because that&#39;s served him well (in other areas, too).  Some day <br/>
he&#39;ll have  a burning desire or pressing need to have legible handwriting (or <br/>
not--then  he&#39;ll learn other coping skills), and at that point he can learn to do <br/>
it in a  short time.  All the components for it will be in place.  <br/>

Responding to my own post, after I&#39;ve read Pam&#39;s.  <br/>
 <br/>
I agree with the wanting to &quot;Be&quot; but not wanting to &quot;Learn&quot;  part.  <br/>
 <br/>
Last night my husband and I went to Willy D&#39;s dueling  piano bar.  We just <br/>
happened upon it after dessert, and it was mostly empty  and a guy was playing <br/>
love songs and it was non-smoking, so we stepped in for a  drink.  We listened <br/>
and talked and pretty soon I realized *this* was the  place someone was <br/>
telling me about how fun it was.  We found out the  dueling piano guys were going to <br/>
start in about an hour, so we decided to  stay.<br/>
 <br/>
It was amazing.  They were very talented, and there were  three of them.  Not <br/>
only did they play piano, but to keep the evening  going, they rotated in <br/>
around the pianos to play a drum set and guitar.   That&#39;s how one guy got a break <br/>
while the other two kept the act going.  It  was very participatory and we <br/>
sang all night.  <br/>
 <br/>
I sat there all night thinking, &quot;I wish I could play like  that!&quot;  &quot;I wish I <br/>
could sing like that.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I am not going to out to buy a piano.  I don&#39;t want to  learn how to do it.  <br/>
I don&#39;t have that kind of talent.  I want it, but  I don&#39;t to learn it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This cracks me up. There&#39;s a principle in brain research that says<br/>
complexity can cause deeper learning (and often more efficient<br/>
learning) than breaking things down into their incremental smaller<br/>
steps. Right-brains prefer conplexity because they become fascinated<br/>
on a level that sustains interest and absorption which then causes<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
This happened with my 11 year old this summer with reading.<br/>
<br/>
He read at age 7 without ever being taught in any formal program at<br/>
all. But he had no interest in reading chapter books. Liked being read<br/>
to. Over the next two years, he got interested in two chapter books<br/>
and read them on his own. Then nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Just this summer while in Italy, he picked up _Ender&#39;s Game_ and read<br/>
the whole thing because the older kids were reading it and it sounded<br/>
interesting. I asked how he was enjoying it. He said that it was tough<br/>
in parts (hard words) but that he just skipped them because the book<br/>
was &quot;the best story ever.&quot; The complexity combined with a great<br/>
sophisticated story made him far more interested in reading than &quot;age<br/>
appropriate and reading level geared&quot; material ever would have.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a blast to watch him since he is my first genuinely<br/>
unschooled kid coming down the pike. <br/>

mutant &lt;g&gt; that&#39;s not the way the rest of the family is!). He likes me <br/>
to remind him to do things as he tries to establish a habit. At the <br/>
moment he wants to practise his signature (after feeling embarassed when <br/>
getting his driver&#39;s license), and he wants to develop the habit of <br/>
writing at the same time each day (he is writing a novel). He also has <br/>
something else he does that he uses the alarm on his watch for, so it&#39;s <br/>
a bit complicated to keep resetting his alarm. So he has asked me to <br/>
wake him / remind him to get up in the morning, to remind him to do the <br/>
above. But I only remind once, and don&#39;t say anything if he choses not <br/>
to do things that day. I wouldn&#39;t &#39;remind him of the goal he set&#39; - that <br/>
sounds pretty heavy - I just say, &#39;do you want to do your writing now?&#39; <br/>
and leave him to do whatever he chooses. Perhaps I should get him a <br/>
cellphone with an organiser - that way it&#39;s purely between him and himself.<br/>

Fountain pens have a rubber reservoir (or probably some fancy vinyl these <br/>
days) that you fill by suction.<br/>
Cartridge pens are like fountain pens but they have plastic reservoirs.<br/>
Dip pens&#39; reservoirs only hold a very little bit either between two pieces of <br/>
metal (the tension of the ink keeps a big drop in there, basically), or in a <br/>
set of plastic fins like little blinds.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in high school there were dip pens sold at T,G & Y (a department <br/>
store) that were less than $1 apiece and the card they were on said &quot;Writes 300 <br/>
words.&quot;   They really did do a whole page, and I used one in high school and <br/>
loved it (went through several) and wish I could find some now!   <br/>

them when they really want help with something of a real-life fashion.   I <br/>
help Kirby make sure his clothes are clean.   Usually it&#39;s by doing them, but <br/>
sometimes he does them.   I am the one who makes sure it gets done.   But I do <br/>
that for my husband too, because he goes to work and doesn&#39;t like to do laundry <br/>
much (or I don&#39;t like for him to do laundry his way).   I LIKE that Kirby has <br/>
a job.   He&#39;s had a job almost all the time since he turned 14.   It was &quot;part <br/>
of his education,&quot; and I think it&#39;s a small thing I can contribute, to make <br/>
sure he has what he needs to wear.    <br/>
<br/>
When Marty started working it didn&#39;t occur to him that working with leather <br/>
and dyes could stain clothes permanently, and he LIKES his clothes, so I took <br/>
him to get some &quot;work pants&quot;--inexpensive khakis he wouldn&#39;t have to worry <br/>
about, and I reminded him a couple of times not to wear one shirt or another, and <br/>
then he hasn&#39;t needed a reminder.   When he puts on his work pants, he puts on <br/>
a shirt he&#39;s willing to stain.<br/>
<br/>
I do that for my husband.   I do it for Holly.   She was at an overnighter <br/>
last night and I helped her checklist what she might need.   When she went <br/>
camping in July I did the same thing, and helped her pack.   My husband does that <br/>
for me, when I&#39;m going somewhere with or without him, and he&#39;ll pack for me if <br/>
I ask him to.   He&#39;s good at it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s not the same thing as &quot;an educational goal.&quot;   It is an aspect <br/>
in which my kids can count on me, if not &quot;depend on me.&quot;   It&#39;s not my <br/>
responsibility, but I&#39;m willing to help.<br/>

Hi, Julie --<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an important point, I think.<br/>
<br/>
** So if you have a kid who asks you for help, what do you do? Just put<br/>
it back on him and see what happens?**<br/>
<br/>
Maybe answer with &quot;what kind of help would you like?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he might answer &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and then I&#39;m not sure what to say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425794331">My 9 y/o daughter wanted to practice her handwriting recently and we found this website that will show you how to form the letters.  She can sit out by the computer and work on it when she feels like it and at her own pace.  She thought it was pretty cool.  <br/>

  Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] How do you support a child&#39;s goal?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have two kids who&#39;ve asked me to help them complete goals they have<br/>
  for themselves. One of them is 11 and he is a leftie. He struggles<br/>
  with handwriting. He keyboards very well and he likes to copy poetry.<br/>
  So he&#39;s done that off and on according to his own interests for the<br/>
  last several years.<br/>
