<div id="ygrps-yiv-15012591">Sorry Sandra, <br/>
can&#39;t help you with the jelly thing.  Mum did have a lillypilly tree in the front yard though and I used to eat them.  Funny things.  Not blue but a pinky colour and really light (as in not heavy) and about the size of a cherry&lt;g&gt;  I remember that they made my teeth feel &#39;dirty&#39; yep, had a &#39;nothing&#39; taste but a bit like dirt LOL  I don&#39;t know what I mean LOL  Wish I could send you some but I haven&#39;t seen a lilly pilly tree for years.<br/>

There were two kids on foreign-fruit (local-fruit to you) things I was sent.  <br/>
Maybe I mixed the pink and blue names.  (Easily could have.)  I saved the <br/>
boxes for years.  The other was something-berry.  (NO help. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

  We have a lilly pilly tree growing at our place but I think it is still to small to fruit. I have never eaten them. I&#39;ll have a close look at the jelly when I go shopping today and see it there is any mysterious, blue jelly on the shelves!<br/>

I think it IS pink.  The other one must have been blue.  I found the box.  <br/>
Never mind me!!<br/>
<br/>
I think, somewhere, I have an un-made box, and this is my current quest.  I <br/>
have a box of Australian stuff somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, sorry to cast aspersions on international jello, but willing to make <br/>
amends</div>
