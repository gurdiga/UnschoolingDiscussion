 </span></blockquote>I have a 5 yo (Luke),7(Matt), and 11 yo (Alisha).  <br/>
<br/>
Today we went to a friend&#39;s house at noon.  They&#39;re an unschooling <br/>
family with a girl who gets along with my 11 year old, a boy who gets <br/>
along with my 5 and 7 year olds, and a mom who gets along with <br/>
me. :)  <br/>
<br/>
We stopped at Wal-mart on the way for Alisha to check on makeup she <br/>
was thinking about buying and discovered that they have series 4 <br/>
Mighty Beanz.  My kids are fascinated with Mighty beanz and begged me <br/>
to give them their allowance 2 days early so they could buy them, so <br/>
I did.  <br/>
<br/>
At the friend&#39;s house, we had fun eating lunch, talking, playing with <br/>
games and toys we don&#39;t have at our house.  4 of the 5 kids colored <br/>
their hair with temporary orange and pink hair color and painted <br/>
their faces.  <br/>
<br/>
We got home at 6, heated up some supper, hung out around the house, <br/>
and started watching the movie 13 going on 30.  None of the kids <br/>
really liked it though so we stopped watching it half way through and <br/>
put on Home Alone 4 instead.  That was neat because it was about a <br/>
boy getting lost in NY city, and we&#39;re going to NY city next week, so <br/>
it was neat to say &quot;Oooh, there&#39;s central park!  We&#39;re going there <br/>
soon!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Websites:<br/>
The boys have been into Harry Potter legos big time lately, <br/>
especially Matt.  They&#39;ve been going to the www.lego.com website and <br/>
typing in numbers to see what legos come up.  Sometimes they look at <br/>
lego papers and type in specific numbers, and sometimes they make <br/>
numbers up to see what they get.  Then they started writing the <br/>
numbers down on paper that brought them to cool lego sets, and they <br/>
had to write the numbers very carefully so they&#39;d be able to read <br/>
them again.  <br/>
<br/>
They go to ebay quite a bit too, to see what kind of mighty beanz and <br/>
Harry Potter legos people are selling.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1822563060">I don&#39;t have a 5, 6, or 7 year old, but I do have an 8 year old.  It&#39;s <br/>
kind of tough for me to give a great account of her day, because she is <br/>
so independent, but I&#39;ll try.<br/>
<br/>
I was on the phone when she got up at about 9:00, so she came in, waved <br/>
and went to get dressed and make her bed (a habit held over from having <br/>
our house on the market for over 8 months last year - that and the fact <br/>
that she really likes her space to be neat).  I think she fixed herself <br/>
some cereal for breakfast and packed a lunch for our park day.  Between <br/>
9 am and noon she played Barbies in her room, both alone and with her <br/>
12 yo sis when she wasn&#39;t getting ready for the day.<br/>
At noon we left for our park day, where she played with friends until <br/>
about 9 pm while I sat and talked with the other moms.  When her <br/>
friends went home, she had some dinner on the swings, and waited for <br/>
the rest of us to be ready to go home, which we did at about 9:30.  She <br/>
slept in the car on the way home.  When we got home she got ready for <br/>
bed and was asleep half a second later.<br/>
Not the most exciting of days, but pretty typical for a Wednesday for <br/>
us.<br/>

<br/>
Jayn will be 5 in October.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I got up early at 7.30 to get to the dentist for my<br/>
teethcleaning. Jayn was sleeping, since we were up until after 4am the night<br/>
before. I did some email checking, prepared a food bag and some extra<br/>
clothes and then hauled Jayn down to the car. She slept until we got to the<br/>
parking lot, where she chose to remain in her nightgown.<br/>
<br/>
We went up to my appointment, where Jayn was fascinated by everything the<br/>
hygienist did, drew some pictures of the Fairy Godmother and a self portrait<br/>
while sitting on the floor, and made a lot of remarks about the cleaning<br/>
process. She then sat bravely in the dentist chair for the first time and<br/>
the hygienist, who seemed really charmed by Jayn, counted her teeth and had<br/>
a look. She found a couple of cavities (no surprise to me). The dentist<br/>
stopped in to say hello and delighted Jayn by remembering a story I had<br/>
forgotten about when she sat up by herself for the first time at the<br/>
dentist&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
After collecting the car, we went to the outdoor mall nearby as planned. We<br/>
intended to buy some shoes. We found a restroom, got some lemonade (and a<br/>
lollipop that Jayn didn&#39;t like so we tossed), and found out that the Disney<br/>
Store was gone. We looked in Gap Kids, and Jayn tried on a nightgown and had<br/>
a bit of a meltdown that the skirt was too short, so we rejected that<br/>
garment. We did get some sandals and stickers. I realized that Jayn was<br/>
probably hungry so we got some donuts (the food bag was in the car), a hot<br/>
dog and some really nice french fries. <br/>
<br/>
After eating Jayn still seemed to be very whiney and twitchy, so I suggested<br/>
that we should head home instead of getting more shoes. Jayn got upset,<br/>
which led me to realize that we *really* needed to go. I told her that she<br/>
seemed to be telling me by her behavior that she was not liking being here -<br/>
every thing was wrong - her socks were too tight, her shoes didn&#39;t fit<br/>
right, nothing tasted good but I couldn&#39;t throw it away. Suddenly she told<br/>
me that she just realized that she was very tired and hadn&#39;t had enough<br/>
sleep. At this moment her own tension seemed to release. So we went back to<br/>
the car cheerfully, and she fell asleep almost instantly after we started<br/>
off. <br/>
<br/>
We got home, and Jayn woke up. She did some playing with an ongoing magnet<br/>
and doll game she has. Yesterday we had made some playdoh &quot;game pieces&quot;<br/>
using a rubber stamp and this had inspired the idea of creating a board<br/>
game. (All board games are &quot;chess&quot; at the moment). Then one of our neighbors<br/>
went swimming, so Jayn and I had a great time for a couple of energetic<br/>
hours having a swim with him, before dh came home. After our swim Jayn got<br/>
dressed. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately she then went to sleep for what has turned out to be one her<br/>
&quot;flipping to nights&quot; naps. I got into bed with her to nurse, and in the hope<br/>
that she would stay asleep all night. While eating a sandwich (from the food<br/>
bag I prepped in the am) I read through my newly arrived copy of Live Free,<br/>
Learn Free which is mostly just like hooking up with my on-line friends for<br/>
some refreshing chats. Then I went to sleep. Poor dh didn&#39;t get a look in<br/>
from anyone this evening, and had to order a pizza for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn woke up about 4 hours later, ready to go! She ate grilled sandwiches,<br/>
played and talked to Daddy for a little while before he hit the sack around<br/>
midnight. He will get up early and head off to his set. I am playing catch<br/>
up again, and the only way I can keep myself awake is by typing. So I am<br/>
checking email and doing some reading, while Jayn watches all her favorite<br/>
cartoons and shows that are on late (that she hasn&#39;t seen in a little<br/>
while), and has done some noodling around with her dolls and eaten some<br/>
popcorn, strawberries and a corn dog. If I could muster some more physical<br/>
energy we would probably be making paper dolls - yesterday we did a Cat in<br/>
the Hat - creating collages, playing X-box, doing Barbie or Princess doll<br/>
playing, or doing some drawing. Jayn sometimes plays computer games at night<br/>
too. These latter activities are more typical of our nights.<br/>
<br/>
She has put her other pyjamas on in the last few minutes, and I have been<br/>
saying for a while that I am needing to go to sleep. I&#39;m hoping we can head<br/>
off shortly. The sofa is just too uncomfortable to sleep on in this<br/>
oppressive heat we are having here, and Jayn is not comfortable staying in<br/>
the living room alone. So at 4am I have no confirmation that our day is<br/>
actually close to ending, but I am hoping for it.<br/>
<br/>
Originally I had a tenuous plan for one of Jayn&#39;s friends to visit tomorrow,<br/>
but now I expect we will be sleeping instead - unless they are able to make<br/>
it later in the day. When I get up I&#39;ll have to do laundry, finish my bill<br/>
paying, and get to the store for milk. Jayn will continue with whatever<br/>
adventure she can, between helping me with my stuff if she wants.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s favorite websites are: Barbie.com, Kelly, PollyPocket.com,<br/>
divastars.com (all of these are Mattel and linked), nickjr.com, Disney.com<br/>
and sometimes she is interested in some of the gaming or movie sites that dh<br/>
will visit that have previews. Periodically I go to some of the game sites<br/>
recommended by unschoolers, like Zoombinis, but so far Jayn has only watched<br/>
without wanting to participate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708606811">I would kind of like to read a few day-in-the-life accounts.  Anyone<br/>
care to share how their day went today?  (Particularly with a 5 or 6<br/>
or 7 year old?)<br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
How &#39;bout a 4, 5 and 7 year old? *lol*<br/>
<br/>
I just posted this the other day at my blog:<br/>
Friday, September 03, 2004<br/>
What a wonderful, relaxing, perfect unschooling day! The kids wanted<br/>
to paint this morning when they woke up, so they pulled out the water<br/>
colors. It&#39;s amazing to watch how self-sufficient they&#39;ve become! They<br/>
pointed out to me that all our watercolor paper is gone, so we&#39;ll have<br/>
to head into The Art Store in Georgetown, which we&#39;re all looking<br/>
forward to upon our return.<br/>
<br/>
While I was eating breakfast, the kids decided they wanted water<br/>
balloons, so they filled a bunch up and brought them up to me to tie.<br/>
They took them outside to play, and before long, they were asking to<br/>
take them into the pool. While they were swimming, they discovered<br/>
that some of the water balloons would float while some would sink.<br/>
They began hypothesizing that maybe it was the amount of water or the<br/>
temperature of the water. Before long, Emily realized that it was the<br/>
amount of air in the balloon with the water that made it float!<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon, we watched Cats for a while, which Emily and Julia<br/>
thought was pretty cool. The kids were all working to balance and<br/>
dance the way the cats were; they were discussing the different<br/>
costumes, which looked more cat-like, which was their favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Sam soon grew bored after he&#39;d had enough snuggling and headed<br/>
downstairs, shortly to reappear with another balloon for me to tie.<br/>
This time, instead of water, the balloon contained a magnetic ball. I<br/>
blew it up for him, and he threw it up in the air for a while,<br/>
watching the way it wobbled, spun and sunk--movement very different<br/>
from the graceful floating of an air-filled balloon. Soon, he<br/>
disappeared again and reappeared with a magnet to attach to the ball<br/>
inside, knowing full well what would happen when he tried to pull it<br/>
away because it&#39;s one of his favorite experiments.<br/>
<br/>
The girls are now outside, dressed in their Colonial Williamsburg garb<br/>
in anticpation of our upcoming trip, and they&#39;re harvesting vegetables<br/>
like good little Colonial girls. As our gardens here in Southern<br/>
Maryland are fading fast, it should be interesting to see what&#39;s in<br/>
their baskets on their return! Sam has scattered a bag of cherry<br/>
tomatoes on the table given to us by a member of our 4-H club, and he<br/>
has experimented with how well the paper bag holds water, reporting<br/>
that I was correct in pointing out that paper did not hold water so<br/>
well. *lol* Emily just came in with a basket full of red hot chilis to<br/>
roast! Not a bad harvest.<br/>

<p><small><time> 9 Sep 2004, at 11:48am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030997944">I have two girls who are 7 (8 in two weeks) and 9.5.  This is how today has<br/>
gone so far.  Dd9 got up at about 7 am and woke me up and we got up<br/>
together.  dd7 was up a few minutes later.  She had found a dollar under her<br/>
pillow from the tooth fairy and put it in her money bag.  They both watched<br/>
TV for an hour and shut it off at 8:00. While they watched TV, I served them<br/>
the breakfast they asked for.  (cereal)  Both girls came into the computer<br/>
room where I was finishing up reading emails and started playing Sims on<br/>
separate computers.  I headed down  to the basement to exercise while they<br/>
played.  I exercised for 30 minutes and before I was done dd9 was down there<br/>
with me.  I cleaned the guinea pig cage before I came up and started a load<br/>
of laundry.<br/>
 <br/>
I came upstairs and made crepes for dh and I for breakfast.  Both girls had<br/>
already eaten. Now they were playing Breyer horses, which they do for hours<br/>
on end.  They played.  I ate and showered.  We made cookies later in the<br/>
morning and the girls also mixed up some old cereal to make food for their<br/>
stuffed animals.  <br/>
 <br/>
Dd7, who sold some stuff on ebay, helped me box up the stuff to be shipped<br/>
and then we spent far too long looking for a little hair brush that went<br/>
with one of the things she sold.  We couldn&#39;t find it and I decided it<br/>
wasn&#39;t worth the dollar she earned to ruin our day looking for it all day<br/>
long. (After being a little grumpy then deciding I didn&#39;t have to be, it was<br/>
easy to solve for only a dollar or less.) We emailed the buyer and asked if<br/>
it would be ok to substitute another brush or if they would prefer their<br/>
money back.  We talked about how if they are dissatisfied that they can<br/>
leave bad feedback and that I would be upset by that.  Dd2 will now put<br/>
aside the things she sells once she lists them so she can find them when it<br/>
is time to ship them.  &lt;lesson learned&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I made lunch for dh and I.  Dd7 ate carrots and cookies.  Dd9 hasn&#39;t eaten<br/>
lunch yet and it&#39;s after 2 o&#39;clock.  Off and on over the course of the early<br/>
afternoon both girls wrote emails from my email account to a friend.  Dh<br/>
decided to set them up their own email addresses and while he worked on<br/>
that, dd9 asked to play mail.  We each sit in different rooms and write<br/>
notes to each other and deliver them in our *mailboxes*.  Mine was a butter<br/>
box this time.  ;0)  We played that for maybe a half an hour.<br/>
 <br/>
When dh was done setting up the new email accounts, they both spent an hour<br/>
writing emails to each other and to dh and I and to one friend.   I just<br/>
finally got a chance to sit down and read emails again.  I thought about<br/>
what we&#39;d done so far today and realized it was a great unschooling day.  We<br/>
will go to the library sometime this afternoon because our movies and books<br/>
are due.  We&#39;ll stop at the post office and ship the packages dd7 sold on<br/>
ebay.  We are kind of waiting to get payment on one so we can ship them all<br/>
in one trip.<br/>
 <br/>
Just got back from a small interruption as dd7 wanted me to help her<br/>
remember how to knit.  She worked on a scarf last winter for her riding<br/>
instructor and she never finished it.  She wants to finish it to give her<br/>
soon.  It just took a minute to find the needles and remind her how to knit.<br/>
She&#39;s now working on that and dd9 is laying on the floor beside her finger<br/>
knitting.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s it so far.  Lots of learning going on today.  :0)  (the lost brush,<br/>
Sims, knitting, oh ya, we also half watched a movie called Animal Olympics<br/>
which was due back to the library today which we hadn&#39;t watched yet, note<br/>
writing, email writing, playing, etc.)  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometime in there they did brush their teeth, but hair has yet to be done.  <br/>
 <br/>
Oh ya, this morning we also copied and pasted pictures of Breyer horses we<br/>
found on-line to a printable calendar we found on-line to make a riding<br/>
schedule for the girls Breyer Riding instructors.<br/>
 <br/>
There is probably more that I missed, but that&#39;s one day in our life...so<br/>
far.  Some days are spent playing with friends, riding lessons, reading<br/>
aloud,  playing board games, swimming, camping, and on and on. They are all<br/>
so different.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Logan (5yo) woke up today around 10.  After some cuddling in bed, he <br/>
said he wanted me to carry him downstairs so he could watch the Land <br/>
Before Time DVD we got from the library.  He watched it while I did <br/>
some catching up on the computer.  We both finished at the same time <br/>
and I made lunch.  Frozen pizza for him, left over pasta for me.  <br/>
While we ate lunch we played with play doh.  I rolled it out for him <br/>
and he used cookie cutters to make designs.  We then played with some <br/>
Micro Machine cars he got yesterday with his allowance.  He is really <br/>
into the little cars right now.  He has a half pipe thing for the <br/>
cars, so we did tricks on that with our cars.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to the library to pick up some stuff we had on reserve (some <br/>
Barbara Sher books).  Logan played with some other little boys that <br/>
were at the library.  In the kids section of our library they have a <br/>
bunch of Hot Wheels cars and a race track.  I looked through the DVDs <br/>
while he played and was able to pick up 2 more Land Before Time and a <br/>
bunch of Pokemon (his current obsession).  Just a week ago, the <br/>
library had almost no DVDs available.  I love it when the kids go <br/>
back to school!  I was also able to find quite a few Pokemon chapter <br/>
books, something else the library had none of a week ago.<br/>
<br/>
We came home from the library and read 3 Mr. Putter and Tabby books, <br/>
one of them we read twice.  In one of the books the characters are <br/>
baking a cake, so Logan went back to the Playdoh and made cakes for <br/>
us to eat.  We then read the next in the Andrew Lost series.  While <br/>
reading it, I realized we never finished the previous book in the <br/>
series (no wonder we were confused).  Unfortunately, I already <br/>
returned the book to the library.  We had a long discussion about <br/>
whether to keep reading the one we already had or wait and get the <br/>
previous one tomorrow, read it and then the current one.  Logan <br/>
decided to go on with reading the current one.  So, I read the whole <br/>
book to him (took about an hour).  During our reading, Daddy came <br/>
home from work and started packing for his camping trip.  <br/>
<br/>
After I finished Andrew Lost, Logan wanted to watch one of the new <br/>
Land Before Time DVDs.  DH and I ate dinner while Logan watched the <br/>
DVD.  He ate after the DVD finished.  DH then put on the Nascar race, <br/>
and Logan decided he really needed some rough play.  So we went into <br/>
the computer room and wrestled.  Wrestling turned into us being <br/>
dinosaurs that were fighting.  Logan then requested I read him a <br/>
Magic Schoolbus book I got at the library today.<br/>
<br/>
It is 10pm now, after the race is over Logan wants to watch the Magic <br/>
Schoolbus that I read to him (I have them all on tape).  So he will <br/>
watch that and we will head up to bed for some more reading.  Logan <br/>
is currently karate fighting a dinosaur behind me.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fairly typical day for us, except Logan hasn&#39;t played any <br/>
computers games today.  He had me start a Magic Schoolbus game up for <br/>
him earlier today but he never played.  He got distracted by the <br/>
Playdoh.<br/>
<br/>
As for his favorite websites, he really likes Neopets, Disney and <br/>
Pokemon.<br/>
