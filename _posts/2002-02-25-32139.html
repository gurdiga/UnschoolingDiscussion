 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a type of homeschooling. It&#39;s (in a much too small nutshell!)<br/>
trusting that people can learn what they need from living life and pursuing<br/>
their interests.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have an agenda of academic things you feel they need to learn then it<br/>
sounds like what people would call eclectic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this works well for us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So if you wanted some ideas that are more along the line of what you&#39;ve been<br/>
doing you might try typing eclectic into yahoo groups.<br/>
<br/>
Anne Zeise has a really good page that covers all aspects of homeschooling<br/>
and might have some good links.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/">http://www.gomilpitas.com/homeschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
And Bev Krueger has an eclectic website and newsletter that might either be<br/>
directly helpful or point to some things that might be helpful<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eho.org/">http://eho.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Of course you&#39;re plenty welcome to stick around and find out what<br/>
unschooling is all about :-)<br/>
