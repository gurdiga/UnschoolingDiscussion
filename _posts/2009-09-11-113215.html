<div id="ygrps-yiv-879658377">***A battleaxe is a cranky old woman and a pike is a fish.***<br/>
<br/>
And the old woman and the fish were named after the weapons. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never caught a pike but I held one once, that someone else caught,  a live one,  and I let it go again.  I got in trouble for that because in some places they&#39;re trying to get rid of pike because they gobble up all the other fish.   I&#39;ve never held the other kind of pike. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also known a battleaxe, she was Irish and Cherokee and worked on the Alaska Pipeline as a cook.  We met her later.  Meanest woman I ever knew, but she liked my husband and made him pickled beets and never hurt us the way she did some folks. (There was one story about I guy who went into a crab pot and didn&#39;t came up again)    I&#39;ve never been hurt by the other kind of battleaxe, either. <br/>
<br/>
***what is the<br/>
difference between a caster (or is it castor? they do make that oil...<br/>
[just joking]) and a wheel?***<br/>
<br/>
I think a castor is a wheel in a frame.  Casters will help you scoot your kick stool around.   Castor will give you the scoots.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***I wanted to say something about knowing everything.***<br/>
<br/>
David (dh) has done a lot of things, worked at a lot of different jobs, lived a lot of different places.   He doesn&#39;t read much but he can fix anything, build anything and remember.   He doesn&#39;t know everything but he knows more than I do about all kinds of stuff.  He&#39;s been able to give Dylan information I couldn&#39;t have.  <br/>
<br/>
***That&#39;s why unschooling works. That&#39;s HOW unschooling works. Because<br/>
someone cares about the difference between a pike (the word &quot;pike&quot;)<br/>
and a battleaxe (the word and the parameters of its meaning).***<br/>
<br/>
I know trivia.  I could answer the Jay Leno questions&lt;g&gt;.  It&#39;s not good for much... getting the answers on Jeopardy.   But all that trivia came from wanting to know why.  Why this and not that? Why then?  Why now?  Why not?  And the whys take you to all kinds of philosophical thought.   If a person&#39;s curious, he&#39;s learning all the time.  Kids are naturally curious. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan wants answers to everything.  He&#39;ll stop a movie to look something up.  He&#39;ll put his dinner aside to check a fact.   He asks questions and always has.  We took a tour of a famous house a few days ago and he had lots of questions for the tour guide that she didn&#39;t know the answers to.  She&#39;d been working there two years.  It seems likely the questions had come up before.   By the time we&#39;d been home an hour Dylan had found the answers.  Maybe the tour guide didn&#39;t like her job, didn&#39;t care that much about history, or was so busy when she wasn&#39;t at work she had no time to learn more about the house and the people who had live there but it seemed very strange to Dylan that a person might not have the desire to find out more.    She knew the scripted tour.  That&#39;s all she *had to know* for her job.    It seemed a little like remembering just enough to pass the test. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Apparently, we are two. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***people gradually add to the details of their knowledge every day that<br/>

<br/>
Not Middle ages stuff but we talked to some friends who are coming for a visit and asked if they&#39;d like to go to the atlatl competition.  They didn&#39;t know what that was.  I think they would have heard the word battleaxe before, (and now I&#39;ll have to ask&lt;g&gt;) and pike (might have first thought of the fish, though - fisher mans, both) but had not heard &quot;atlatl&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Touristy things are successful, tours of historic homes, atlatl competitions, ghost towns... because people are curious.  <br/>

Don&#39;t really need to sign this, do I?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
