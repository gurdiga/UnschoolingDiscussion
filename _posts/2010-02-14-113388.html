<div id="ygrps-yiv-386206485">Hi folks!<br/>
<br/>
I’m writing to let you  know that the Super Early Bird deadline to register <br/>
for the Northeast  Unschooling Conference is coming up fast, on February  <br/>
15.  <br/>
<br/>
I’m so excited about this year’s  conference! One of our speakers is Peter <br/>
Gray, a research professor of  psychology at Boston College and blogger for <br/>
Psychology Today. (If you haven’t  read Peter’s blog, please go now! As <br/>
unschoolers, it’s amazing to have an  academic “get it” so powerfully!)  <br/>
_www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn)">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn)</a>   He’ll be around all weekend, because he’s  excited to <br/>
also learn about US!<br/>
<br/>
Other presenters include Ren Allen, Erika  Davis-Pitre, Cameron Lovejoy, <br/>
and many others. We’ll be entertained by grown  unschooler Carsie Blanton, an <br/>
up-and-coming singer-songwriter currently on tour  in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
There’s also the Talent Show, Untrepreneurial Fair, Funshops,  and <br/>
wonderful community to look forward to. This year we&#39;re adding a dance and a  music <br/>
jam for later night play.<br/>
<br/>
So, register early and  save some money! Also, now is the time to apply for <br/>
scholarships if your family  needs one to attend this year.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you’ll make it.  Please check out the website at <br/>
