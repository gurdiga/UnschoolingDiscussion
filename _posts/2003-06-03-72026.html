<div id="ygrps-yiv-869863015">I have a dear friend that emailed me saying &quot;she had started a group for<br/>
Baha&#39;i Unschoolers. She is  the only member.  She posts to the list every<br/>
day.  She doesn&#39;t talk much about Baha&#39;i things, more often about<br/>
unschooling things.  She wonders if anyone will join that group.  There are<br/>
a few supposed unschoolers on the Baha&#39;i Homeschooling list, but they&#39;re not<br/>
as committed to UNschooling as to HOMEschooling. &quot;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The group is specifically called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bahaiunschoolers@yahoogroups.com">bahaiunschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
 <br/>
I told her I&#39;d sent this information to the lists I&#39;m on, so here it is.<br/>
Please forward this to anyone who might be interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love from a Spiritual Unschooler...<br/>
