<div id="ygrps-yiv-308531692">We have a nifty little pocket device, consisting of a length of metallic <br/>
(potassium???) and a dull blade made of steel. On the back of the soft <br/>
metallic mineral a strip of steel is attached. They&#39;re tied together with a <br/>
leather thong, and there&#39;s a piece of deer antler to make it bulkier (I <br/>
guess). What you do is, shave some of the soft metallic mineral onto a <br/>
little pile of tinder, then strike the steel blade against the steel strip, <br/>
and sparks fly into the shavings and the tinder, and VOILA! it makes fire. <br/>
I&#39;ve done it my own self, and it&#39;s pretty cool.<br/>

&gt;LOL go to the Edmund Scientific website and pick up a cheap fresnel<br/>
&gt;lense (the factory seconds are 11&quot;x11&quot; and cost about $5) - DH had a<br/>
&gt;fire going in the backyard in about 2 seconds flat with leaves,<br/>
&gt;twigs and some sunlight and his trusty lense, then added a small bit<br/>
&gt;of branch and we had the beginnings of quite a nice fire.<br/>

It&#39;s magnesium.  :)  I have one, too, and it&#39;s hard work if you  don&#39;t have a <br/>
really sharp pocket knife to get the shavings.  Mine&#39;s not  special with the <br/>
deer antler, so maybe it&#39;s not as good as yours.<br/>
