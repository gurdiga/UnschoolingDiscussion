<div id="ygrps-yiv-574338821">Hi Sherry<br/>
i also h/s an only child - actualy she is the youngest of 5  but the <br/>
others have all left home now.  toni is 12 and i am 50yr. I work 18 <br/>
hours a week and Toni comes along with me - i am very lucky there.<br/>
i dont realy have time to get bored - I did actually think of giving <br/>
up my job to have more time to spend with my daughter - but on <br/>
reflection that might not be such a good idea. I do enjoy my job.<br/>
I do some times wonder if it would be easier if i had 2 being home <br/>
schooled...<br/>
Could you perhaps find voluntry work - (if not a paid position)for a <br/>
few hours a week - something for you, that brings joy to YOU.  do you <br/>
belong to a suport group, that meet regularly? I do know how lonely <br/>
and bored it can be being home all the time - especialy if you have <br/>
very little adult contact during the day. sorry i am not much help.<br/>
