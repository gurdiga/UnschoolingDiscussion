<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800666460">I just read someone&#39;s post about their child doing a lot of fantasy play and<br/>
was wondering if anyone else&#39;s child was like this.  then I was reading the<br/>
Unschooling.com online news mag and found this.  so I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
Serious Play<br/>
For a healthy and active fantasy life children need time, space, and<br/>
pri-vacy, or at least only as much companionship as they choose. Obviously<br/>
school, or any other large-group situation --- day care center, nursery<br/>
school, play group, etc. --- does not allow much of this. Perhaps worst of<br/>
all, they are usually under the eye and control of adults who, even if they<br/>
will allow children a fantasy life, feel they have to watch it, under-stand<br/>
what it means, judge it, make use of it. It was for just this reason that a<br/>
well-meaning and quite highly praised book, written about ten years ago,<br/>
called Fantasy and Feeling in Childhood, seemed and still seems to me deeply<br/>
mistaken. The gist of it (and there may well be many books like it) was that<br/>
if we, i.e., people who work in schools, paid enough attention to the<br/>
fantasy lives of children, we could learn to understand them and bend them<br/>
to our own purposes.<br/>
This would be a great mistake and a great wrong. Instead, we should be<br/>
content to watch and enjoy as much of children&#39;s fantasy lives as they will<br/>
let us see, and to take part in them, if the children ask us to and if we<br/>
can do so happily and unselfconsciously. Otherwise, we should leave them<br/>
alone. Children&#39;s fantasy is useful and important to them for many rea-sons,<br/>
but above all because it is theirs, the one part of their lives which is<br/>
wholly under their control. We must resist the temptation to make it ours.<br/>
We must also resist the equally great temptation to think that this part of<br/>
children&#39;s lives is less important than the parts where they are doing<br/>
something &quot;serious&quot; --- reading, or writing, or doing schoolwork, or<br/>
some-thing that we want them to do --- or to think that we can only allow<br/>
them time for fantasy after all the important work is done, as we might give<br/>
them a piece of candy after a meal. For children, play and fantasy are one<br/>
of the main courses of the meal. Children should be able to do them, not<br/>
just in what little tag ends of time remain after all the &quot;important&quot; work<br/>
is done, but when they are most full of energy and enthusiasm. We talk these<br/>
days of &quot;quality time.&quot; Children need quality time for their fantasy and<br/>
play as much as for their reading or math. They need to play well as much as<br/>
they need to read well. Indeed, we would probably find if we looked into it<br/>
that children who are not good at playing, dreaming, fan-tasizing, are<br/>
usually not much good at reading either.<br/>
