Would you mind telling me how?  I have yet to figure that out.<br/>

When you&#39;re in your &quot;Mailbox&quot; screen, just click on the top menu that says <br/>
&quot;Email Address&quot; --- it is right underneat where it says &quot;new mail&quot; &quot;old Mail&quot; <br/>
and &quot;sent Mail&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Clicking on that sorts your mail by email address - if you&#39;re in &quot;new mail&quot; <br/>
it sorts your new mail.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can select the first email by the address you want to delete. Hold <br/>
down the shift key and select that last mail from that address. That selects <br/>
all of them. <br/>
<br/>
Click on &quot;delete&quot; -- lower right of mail screen - between &quot;notify AOL&quot; and <br/>
&quot;help&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re done - click on the top menu where is says &quot;Date&quot; to get the <br/>
emails back into chronological order, if you want them that way.<br/>
<br/>
AOL 7.0 --- maybe not in earlier versions, I can&#39;t remember.<br/>
Not as good as filtering into separate folders like Outlook and Eudora can <br/>
do. But..... there ya go. For a long time I had a little add-on program that <br/>
I paid $20 for that loaded my aol mail into Outlook -- so I could use all the <br/>
great filtering stuff --- but Outlook is so susceptible to viruses that I <br/>
decided to get rid of it and live with the AOL mail program.<br/>
