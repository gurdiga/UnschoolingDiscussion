    Oh how true. I remember my 11th grade English teacher ruining many a good <br/>
book. Everything we read had a God/Jesus symbolism in it whether it did or <br/>
not. All those horrible papers in which we had to talk about symbolism that I <br/>
didn&#39;t agree with. I sure could make it up though. <br/>
<br/>
    Huck Finn was one of the books. The kids and I recently listened to it on <br/>
tape. What a fun book. I didn&#39;t remember most of it because it had been <br/>
ruined for me. I&#39;m glad my kids got to enjoy it without having to dissect it <br/>
or write a paper. The tape even started off with a warning not to try to find <br/>
the symbolism in the book but to just enjoy it. Why didn&#39;t/don&#39;t all those <br/>
teachers listen? My kids had a ball listening to Huck&#39;s adventures. We had <br/>
discussions, but they were natural not forced.<br/>
<br/>
    It took me thirty years, but it&#39;s fun to read or listen to those books <br/>
now.<br/>
