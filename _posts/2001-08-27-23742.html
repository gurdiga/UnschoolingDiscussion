<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485295943">Hi Cindy,<br/>
<br/>
We do this too, but have a problem with the paper<br/>
going sour before it gets dry. Perhaps I need to press<br/>
it more? I read somewhere that a few drops of clove<br/>
oil will prevent mildew and such.  Have you tried it?<br/>
Does the oil add a greasiness? Do you dry yours under<br/>
a light bulb, in oven, or ?  IN the sun is the worst<br/>
for us, due to the humidity.<br/>
<br/>
Our new paper shredder is great!!!! It is one handy<br/>
gadget!<br/>

&gt; it wet thru).<br/>
&gt; Then with more water (don&#39;t remember just how much -<br/>
&gt; enough so your<br/>
&gt; blender doesn&#39;t stall) add the paper to the blender<br/>
&gt; and puree!<br/>
&gt; I poured the mixture into a tub with extra water<br/>
&gt; then you can<br/>
&gt; add seeds, flowers, glitter, paint or anything else<br/>
&gt; you think <br/>
&gt; would look good in the paper. Then you need a screen<br/>
&gt; (called a <br/>
&gt; deckle by papermakers) and you get a bunch of the<br/>
&gt; paper pulp <br/>
&gt; into the screen - drain the water away and turn the<br/>
&gt; wet sheet <br/>
&gt; of paper onto something where it can dry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My SIL is an artist who uses paper she makes in her<br/>
&gt; artwork uses<br/>
&gt; this basic method.  She does put it something that<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t flat to<br/>
&gt; get interesting shapes sometimes.  She also buys<br/>
&gt; lintners from<br/>
&gt; art supplies to make higher quality paper.<br/>

About 25 years ago we had a young man live in our<br/>
attic, not long after he returned from Vietnam.  His<br/>
name was Tom Ferguson.  Really a nice fellow. Know any Toms?<br/>

worried about you!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How lumpy?  You can pour half into a bowl, add more water to the blender<br/>
and pulse it again.  Then do the same with the other half.  <br/>
If it&#39;s not too bad remember, you will pour the slurry from the blender<br/>
into a dishpan of water. <br/>
Good luck,<br/>
