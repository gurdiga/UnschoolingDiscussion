&gt;Well I am not new, and I tend to agree with you Juli.  I don&#39;t want <br/>
&gt;to presume to tell people what they can and can&#39;t talk about/be <br/>
&gt;interested/passionate about.  Instead I offer a plea.  Could this <br/>
&gt;type of intense and minority involved argument be taken off list <br/>
&gt;please?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this is an indepth discussion between two of our oldest and <br/>
most respected (by me anyway) listmembers, and I&#39;m still finding the <br/>
interplay of ideas and exchange of thinking rather fascinating, so <br/>
I&#39;d just as soon let them continue and see where it leads, and those <br/>
who aren&#39;t interested can delete that subject thread (or skip those <br/>
posts on digest).<br/>
<br/>
But if you choose to take it offlist, take me with you, okay?<br/>
