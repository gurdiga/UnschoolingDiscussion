Can you imagine there are actually people who believe that the only people<br/>
who HS are child abusers? What an eye opener to be told that! People don&#39;t<br/>
have a lot of experience with HSers so the ONE they knew/know is<br/>
stereotypical of all of us. Scary eh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746856374">Very scary as are the folks from the opposite pole:  if I haven&#39;t<br/>
experienced/don&#39;t know someone who does it then it doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
