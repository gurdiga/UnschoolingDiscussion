<div id="ygrps-yiv-616880459">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Laura and our family lives in Maine.  Our children are 11b, 3 g <br/>
and 11 mob.<br/>
Our oldest likes to surf, archery, snowmobile, xBox etc.<br/>
We have been schooling/Unschooling for almost 3 years. The first two years <br/>
had breaks in them to explore a different Private school and public for 3 <br/>
weeks.  <br/>
I have always known the Unschooling was the way he learned best. I have piles <br/>
of text books but we rarely use them. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if maybe some could assist us with suggestions for our <br/>
portfolio?  This is my first portfolio year as the past 2 we have tests <br/>
already. Our group had a teacher that was pretty relaxed as far as papers and <br/>
proof but she is unable to do them this year so there is another teacher <br/>
doing them. I have been told she just wants to see &quot;progress.&quot;  If I wasn&#39;t <br/>
so panicked over this I could probably have a huge list but I am totally <br/>
drawing a blank.  I have some items to put down but I am certain there are <br/>
life experiences I am forgetting.  I have searched the net off and on since <br/>
we started this but most of what I see is like Drama, Piano, Mad Science etc. <br/>
We don&#39;t do too much outside our home as far as classes.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>
