&gt; John Holt learned to play the cello at age 50.  If you<br/>
&gt; want to learn it now, you can.  There wasn&#39;t a time<br/>
&gt; limit set on when you could learn.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       And he wrote a wonderful book about it, called Never Too Late. I&#39;d <br/>
describe it as self-led-learning in the sense that he immersed himself in a <br/>
fulltime &quot;life of the cello&quot; of his own personal design.<br/>
<br/>
       BUT part of this was seeking out various experts and teachers (and <br/>
talented, experienced peers to make music with) -- he didn&#39;t just figure it all <br/>
out by himself from scratch. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       In tennis there is a principle that says you should practice against <br/>
all three kinds of opponents for maximum improvement: those above your level, <br/>
those below it and those right on it, with whom you&#39;re compatible and <br/>
competitive at the same time. It seems to me that John Holt instinctively did this for <br/>
himself in learning to play the cello as an adult. <br/>
<br/>
       And oh, by the way, he makes a wonderful unschoolish point of <br/>
explaining that he always thought of himself as actually &quot;playing&quot; the cello rather <br/>
than &quot;learning&quot; or &quot;practicing&quot; -- he was playing (albeit very poorly) from Day <br/>
One. :)  JJ<br/>

hubby too, that unschoolers use the community and<br/>
other resources too, they don&#39;t just &quot;do it on their<br/>
own&quot;.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

tested. So much more of life can be &quot;played&quot; as an art form when I <br/>
look at it this way! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
This may apply to reading, too. Like the toddler who saw the arrow <br/>
in &quot;FedEx&quot; because seeing is still play?<br/>

Onward and upward!<br/>

&quot;Schooling as we know it, is a powerful expression <br/>
of the sickness of this society, not a cure for that <br/>
sickness...our schools are a liar&#39;s world.&quot;<br/>
