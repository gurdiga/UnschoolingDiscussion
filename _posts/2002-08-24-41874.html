<div id="ygrps-yiv-92950488">I have a question. I have sent in the appropriate papers to home<br/>
unschool my 11 year old. The department of education says it takes 4<br/>
working days (it&#39;s been 5) to hear back from them on whether or not they<br/>
&quot;okay&quot; it. School starts this Thursday and I want to keep my son home<br/>
from school even though I haven&#39;t heard from the department of<br/>
education, yet. I will call them this Monday. I don&#39;t want to break the<br/>
law and get into that mess. Is it okay to keep him home? Thanks. Michele<br/>
