&gt; My point is (and I do have one):  if this list were not so challanging I may<br/>
&gt; not have gotten the chance to challange myself.  I can still disagree but if<br/>
&gt; I find something that may be useful...a different way of looking at things<br/>
&gt; perhaps...then I&#39;ll be better for it.  That will benefit my children.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve always had this attitude, but I wish *I* had always<br/>
had this attitude! Great post.<br/>
