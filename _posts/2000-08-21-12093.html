<div id="ygrps-yiv-896248252">After you are done in Virginia, can you pack everyone up and come to Ohio? I <br/>
would really like to know more about the college level classes for high <br/>
schoolers-anyone know anything about this already? Or, if anyone who does go <br/>
to the conference could give me some tips, I would really appreciate it. I <br/>
have heard of kids in public school going to local colleges for some of <br/>
their classes, but I am not sure how this works for us hsers.<br/>
<br/>
It does sound like a great seminar-wish I could be there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;VHEA Day<br/>
&gt;Seminars for New and Experienced Homeschoolers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Featuring: &quot;Conversations with My Violin; Learning about Learning&quot;<br/>
&gt;by Author David H. Albert<br/>
&gt;	&quot;Contrasts the rather strange principles that lie a the heart of public<br/>
&gt;education with the actual learning process itself.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other Topics:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Avoiding Burnout (roundtable)--Jen Jablunovsky<br/>
&gt;	Are you headed for burnout? This session will discuss the signs and<br/>
&gt;symptoms of potential burnout, as well as suggestions by experienced<br/>
&gt;homeschoolers on ways to combat it. Topics of discussion include support<br/>
&gt;groups, changing homeschooling styles/approaches, parents taking time for<br/>
&gt;themselves, and simplifying your schedule.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Starting a Writing Group -- Parrish Mort<br/>
&gt;	A writing group provides a safe environment for sharing creative writing<br/>
&gt;and exploring new styles of writing. Even the most reluctant writers<br/>
&gt;learn to love the experience! Learn how to organize a group, the basic<br/>
&gt;rules, and some tried and true ideas for activities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Teaching with Community College Resources -- Linda Doby<br/>
&gt;	Feel like you can&#39;t teach high school level subjects? Then offer college<br/>
&gt;level courses! Many of us feel intimidated by the prospect of presenting<br/>
&gt;higher-level subjects to our older kids. This session offers information<br/>
&gt;on a practical alternative to sending older homeschooled kids to high<br/>
&gt;school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Beginner Homeschooler--Peg Watson<br/>
&gt;	This session is for the new or nearly new homeschooler who would like to<br/>
&gt;have general information about homeschooling in Virginia.  Legal<br/>
&gt;concerns, practical considerations, networking strategies and coping<br/>
&gt;techniques will be shared by the presenter, who has been homeschooling<br/>
&gt;for several years, but not so long that she&#39;s forgotten what it&#39;s like to<br/>
&gt;be a beginner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Unschooling as a Way of Life -- Shay Seaborne<br/>
&gt;	Unschooling is often misunderstood [&quot;They just goof off all day&quot;] and<br/>
&gt;sometimes seems frightening [&quot;How do children learn if you don&#39;t teach<br/>
&gt;them?&quot;].  Find out what unschooling is --and what it isn&#39;t, how it works,<br/>
&gt;and why more homeschoolers are leaning toward this enjoyable way of life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hands-on Science -- Castle O&#39;Neil<br/>
&gt;	This session will provide some creative ideas for approaching science as<br/>
&gt;a dynamic subject -- one that is constantly evolving, where so much is<br/>
&gt;still unknown. Kids will come to realize that they can be scientists too!<br/>
&gt;Discussion will include examples from teaching topics such as states of<br/>
&gt;matter and evolution, among others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Homeschooling Older Children -- Margaret Shaw<br/>
&gt;	Find out what you need to know about homeschooling older children, from<br/>
&gt;academics and activities to jobs, including paid work, volunteer<br/>
&gt;activities, and church work. Topics range from study skills and<br/>
&gt;testing/SATs to lessons and classes, the fine arts, computer literacy,<br/>
&gt;and etiquette -- crucial! -- as well as documentation for all of the<br/>
&gt;above.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Starting a Co-Op Group (roundtable)--Jill Friestad<br/>
&gt;	Many homeschoolers enjoy the benefits of cooperative clubs and classes.<br/>
&gt;Find out how to form and plan the successful year-long co-op you<br/>
&gt;envision-- through setting goals, sharing a philosophy and working with<br/>
&gt;compatible personalities.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Using Portfolios as Evaluation Tools -- Connie LaPallo<br/>
&gt;	Why choose a portfolio evaluation instead of testing? This session will<br/>
&gt;explore the reasons you might choose a portfolio, what a portfolio<br/>
&gt;contains, and how a portfolio is evaluated. Find out about minimum<br/>
&gt;requirements, suggestions for dividing a portfolio into sections, ideas<br/>
&gt;for organizing information throughout the year, and samples of<br/>
&gt;portfolios.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Opportunity to Network<br/>
&gt;	A chance to schmooze with other homeschoolers: new, familiar and those<br/>
&gt;on-line folks you&#39;ve always wanted to meet in real life.<br/>
