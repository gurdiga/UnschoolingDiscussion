***I love words, but it&#39;s rare that I see one on a list that I don&#39;t<br/>
know. ***<br/>

Have you seen the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue?   I thought of<br/>
you and Sandra when I saw it.  Not that you&#39;re vulgar, you understand.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
School of Venus was one name for a brothel. <br/>
Dishclout was a dirty, greasy woman<br/>
A grave was sometimes called an earth bath. <br/>
A Hempen widow was someone who&#39;s husband had been hanged.<br/>
<br/>
We have the book &quot;The Word Museum&quot;, by Jeffrey Kacirk.  We regularly use<br/>
words like quanked (overpowered by fatigue) and crapulous (given to<br/>
drunkenness.)  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I *should* have said that there aren&#39;t many words that are used on an E-LIST <br/>
that I don&#39;t recognize. There are plenty of words I don&#39;t know! &lt;G&gt; I just <br/>
love words!<br/>
<br/>
Cameron (who learned to hate all words, written or spoken, it seemed) has <br/>
again begun to enjoy words---asking for definitions, spellings, whatever. We&#39;re <br/>
both on the &quot;word-a-day list&quot; from Wordsmith. Here&#39;s one from this week:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mesne (meen) adjective<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Intermediate; intervening.<br/>
<br/>
[From Anglo-French, a variant of meen, from meien, from Latin medianus,<br/>
from medius (middle). Other words derived from the same root are median,<br/>
medieval, mediate, medium, intermediate, and mediocre.]<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;In any case if the titles are in your favour, you can file the suit<br/>
   for recovery of the licensed premises from the licensee in Civil Court<br/>
   and also you can claim mesne profit from the date of termination of<br/>
   license.&quot;<br/>

This week&#39;s theme: words with variant spellings.<br/>

he would expunge them entirely from his memory if that were possible.<br/>

They have weekly &quot;themes&quot;---like this week: variant spellings. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for thinking of me and my vulgar tongue, Deb! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college, I had a boyfriend who had a neat book----I *think* it <br/>
was called, _Famous Last Words_. Quotes from people about to die---many hanged <br/>
or otherwise executed, but some who were simply on their deathbeds. I always <br/>
thought it was interesting to read what folks found imperative to say----I <br/>
mean it&#39;s the LAST thing they&#39;ll say----and sometimes it was so strange! or funny <br/>
or profound....<br/>
<br/>
I need to find that book!<br/>
