&gt; I&#39;ve been reading about several of you living on farms and lots of acreage.<br/>

&gt; now, but closer to my dh&#39;s work.  However the problem is...I have never<br/>

&gt; farms!  What are the pros and cons?  Have any of you lived in the city and<br/>
&gt; the country?  How did you feel about the country life-people, work, life in<br/>
&gt; general?  Part of me says this would be a fantastic experience for our kids,<br/>
&gt; but another part of me says &quot;what about people contact? stores?&quot; I would<br/>
&gt; appreciate any input on this subject!<br/>

<br/>
We recently moved into the city from the country.  It&#39;s been a good thing <br/>
for us in the way of being much closer to the library, stores, parks, etc.  <br/>
But, we do miss the country...the peace and quiet.  I wouldn&#39;t make a <br/>
blanket statement that neighbors in the country are better than ones in the <br/>
city.  People is people.  But, in the country you&#39;ve got plenty space <br/>
between you and those who aren&#39;t so personable.  Being in the city we&#39;ve cut <br/>
down on gas costs for the vehicles and the wear and tear on them.  I&#39;d say <br/>
tho&#39; it all depends on what you prefer and are willing to tolerate in either <br/>
place.  Our kids love being able to walk to just about any place we want to. <br/>
  And having friends nearer; but they have also remarked a number of times <br/>
that they miss living in the country.  I think maybe 10 years down the road, <br/>
we may look to move to the country again.  But for our family and our <br/>
situation, living in the city and visiting in the country is working out <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in the country.  I wasn&#39;t &quot;cut-off&quot; socially because of it.  It <br/>
simply meant that my parents had to do a lot more driving to get me where I <br/>
needed to go.  But I loved living in the country, walking in the woods and <br/>
along the creek.  Sitting in the stillness and just listening to the breeze <br/>
rustling the leaves of trees and bushes.   Lots of opportunity to think and <br/>
dream.  That&#39;s what I miss most...enjoying nature and it&#39;s sounds, smelling <br/>
that fresh country air.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s my two cents worth.  :)<br/>

&gt;Hello Everyone!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve been reading about several of you living on farms and lots of acreage.<br/>
&gt;We are currently looking at some land many, many miles from where we live<br/>
&gt;now, but closer to my dh&#39;s work.  However the problem is...I have never<br/>
&gt;lived on that much acreage (only an acre!) and that far out by nothing but<br/>
&gt;farms!  What are the pros and cons?  Have any of you lived in the city and<br/>
&gt;the country?  How did you feel about the country life-people, work, life in<br/>
&gt;general?  Part of me says this would be a fantastic experience for our <br/>
&gt;kids,<br/>
&gt;but another part of me says &quot;what about people contact? stores?&quot; I would<br/>
&gt;appreciate any input on this subject!<br/>
