&gt; i love to watch people<br/>
&gt; when we go to coffee shops andhe goes up and orders his special coffee,<br/>
&gt; then sits down with is nose in a book to drink it...looks like an exact<br/>
&gt; miniature of his father.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL, that&#39;s cute. One of Mackenzie&#39;s early words was &quot;Starbucks!&quot; which he<br/>
would shout whenever he saw the familiar green lady sign. He likes to go in<br/>
and order a &quot;mocha&quot; which to him means chocolate milk.<br/>
<br/>
As for coffee stunting your growth, one of my good friends is of Dutch<br/>
heritage, both his parents came over from Holland after WWII and are quite<br/>
small people. He and all of his siblings drank coffee and they are all about<br/>
6&#39;4&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I can&#39;t drink it anymore because I can feel the effects of the<br/>
drug so keenly. I can&#39;t drink more than a half a glass of wine either,<br/>
more&#39;s the pity :-)<br/>
