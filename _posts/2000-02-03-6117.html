<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769694746">I&#39;m willing to bet that another thing we all have in common, is that we<br/>
are all avid readers.  After the discussion of Amelia Peabody, I&#39;d like<br/>

I&#39;m reading my first Amelia Peabody.  Just started it.  I can tell I&#39;ll<br/>
like it already.<br/>
Here are some of my favorites.<br/>
For mystery (my favorite) I love Ruth Rendell.  She has an Inspector<br/>
Wexford series as well as others.  I also like Martha Grimes.  She too<br/>
has a series with the same characters.    I also love to read the Emily<br/>
Pollifax series.  Why can&#39;t I think of the author??<br/>
I think outside of mystery I really love May Sarton.  I think she has<br/>
one called &quot;Full Circle&quot;.<br/>
Right now I&#39;m reading a book by the Dali Lama or rather a phd and him<br/>
called &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot;.  It is wonderful.  I love his philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
So, what are all of you reading?<br/>

<br/>
Ann,<br/>
I will read absolutely anything I can get my hands on.  If I am stuck <br/>
somewhere without a book, I feel like I&#39;m without my legs or eyes.  My <br/>
husband laughs because I can be cooking dinner or folding laundry or weeding <br/>
the flowerbed with my face stuck in a book.  He rolls his eyes when I say, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m going to the library, I&#39;ll be home in half an hour!&quot;  He know it will <br/>
probably be several hours before he sees me again.  I currently have 143 <br/>
books checked out on my card.  I have too many beloved authors to list, but a <br/>
few authors and/or books that I love are:<br/>
S.J. Rozan (mystery series w/ Bill Smith & Lydia Chin), Elizabeth Berg (&quot;The <br/>
Pull of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Til the Real Thing Comes Along&quot;,  etc.), Jeffrey Deaver <br/>
(I didn&#39;t see the Bone Collector in the theatre.  I try to avoid films of <br/>
books I&#39;ve liked), Alan Gurganis (&quot;Plays Well With Others&quot;, Oldest Living <br/>
Confederate Widow Tells All&quot; - LOVE this book), C.S. Lewis, Erma Bombeck, <br/>
Dave Barry, Laurie King, zillions of others, and most nonfiction.  I have to <br/>
say that I do not enjoy the fantasy sci-fi genre.  That&#39;s the only section I <br/>
avoid at the library.  I love to read good kids&#39; books as well.  Sometimes I <br/>
look for a kids&#39; non-fiction book for an intro to something I&#39;m newly <br/>
interested in.  They can be very helpful without reading like an academic <br/>
journal.  I just can&#39;t live without my books! <br/>

I have to agree with this.  In the past week and a half, I have read &quot;Deep <br/>

I&#39;ve got to make a trip to the library soon!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424247826">The upstairs bathroom is where I sometimes &quot;sneak&quot; up to when I need a<br/>
break. If I&#39;m gone for too long, my husband knows where to find me.:)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see, I&#39;ve got a shelf full of books to read in both bathrooms, some in<br/>
our living room, and some in our bedroom. I really like discovering a writer<br/>
after they&#39;ve written lots of books in a series. Then I read one after<br/>
another in sequence. When I&#39;ve finished reading them, I pack them up and<br/>
send them to my mom, who reads them and then passes them on to her friends<br/>
at the nursing home she works at. So, they get a good work out!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently read all the Martha Grime mystery books that have been written<br/>
(not all are great, but once I start on a series, I want to read them all),<br/>
I really like Anne Perry, Some authors that I like: Elizabeth George,<br/>
Elizabeth Peters (Amelia Peabody), Orson Scott Card, Ellis Peters (Cadfael<br/>
series). I review lots of non-fiction, so it&#39;s nice to balance it with<br/>
fiction. I like a good mystery or sci-fi novel, one that gives me something<br/>
new to learn (about a time in history, what the future could be like,<br/>
something about forensics, etc), with characters who have to deal with<br/>
everyday issues/relationships/moral quandaries, while pulling me forward to<br/>
an interesting ending (such as solving the murder).<br/>

Orson Scott Card and Jean Auel are two of my favorites too.  If you like<br/>
the Auel books check into Linda Lay Shuler.  She is a TX author - there<br/>
are three books in the series She Who Remembers, Voice of the Eagle, and<br/>
Let the Drum Speak.  Another favorite scifi author of mine is Ben Bova.<br/>
<br/>
I started the Art of Happiness but got side tracked reading all the Holt<br/>
I can find.  The Dali Lama  *is* incredible.  I&#39;m sure the guy who wrote<br/>
the book didn&#39;t do him justice.<br/>

 library time on regular basis.  I can&#39;t go unless DH is home with the kids. <br/>

    I usually go in the evenings or on the weekends either by myself or with <br/>
my 5 yr old and dh watches the baby.  Life is much easier that way !!<br/>

my time putting back the books they pulled from the shelves. Then I decided to<br/>
take - without looking at what they were - at least two of the books they<br/>
pulled out home with me to read. A lot were totally uninteresting to me, but I<br/>
also enjoyed some books that I would never have found - from sections in the<br/>
library I never looked at! It got to be fun to take them, and to get home and<br/>
discover what I had to read this week!<br/>

<br/>
Two of my grandsons and I are reading _Pagoo_ by Holling Clancy Holling.<br/>
They love it, all the detail, but I find it very slow going!<br/>
<br/>
I love Dorothy Gilman of Mrs. Pollifax fame.  She has another one coming out<br/>
this spring.  And _A Nun in the Closet_ is thoroughly entertaining!  I<br/>
consume anything readable, labels, magazines, you name it, but read escape<br/>
fiction for relaxation.<br/>

LOL - I am terrible about that!  I put my wet hands on the book and get the <br/>
pages all crinkly, the steam damps the whole thing up, AND I usually end up <br/>
refilling the tub until the water heater is empty just so I won&#39;t have to <br/>
quit reading at a good spot.  There I am at 2:00 AM, shivering in a tepid tub <br/>
with my soggy book.  I have done this MANY times!<br/>
