<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845733486">Some smart person ;) in this very egroup told me to<br/>
ask myself is it life-threatening, health-threatening<br/>
or morally dangerous. Sounds like going to work with<br/>
dad is something they both enjoy. As long as the boss<br/>
doesn&#39;t mind, it sounds wonderful! Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762891696">&lt;&lt;She now would prefere to go with dad every day. dh<br/>
loves her company, and has said that he gets done much quicker with<br/>
dd as she is a good hard worker.  dh is a courier.<br/>
To go with her dad she really has to be motivated as he leaves home<br/>
at 6am and doesnt return untill 7pm.<br/>
I have mixed feelings about this -<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let&#39;s get this straight. You have mixed feelings about a young woman,<br/>
just a few short years away from being on her own, who wants to get up and<br/>
meet the needs of a job. A job where she is proving to herself and others<br/>
that she&#39;s *a good hard worker*.  Where she is able to spend an inordinate<br/>
amount of time with her &lt;gasp&gt; father.  Where she will come to know him in<br/>
ways very few of our children now know their fathers. She will have an<br/>
innate underdstanding of how hard he works,  how he approaches his work,<br/>
what he thinks of current events and where she gets to bask in the pride a<br/>
father can only show when his daughter is proving to the world she is a<br/>
*good hard worker*.  At this job she will be out and about, living in the<br/>
real world, meeting a diverse set of individuals and making contacts of her<br/>
own.  She&#39;ll come home physically tired.  She want to eat well and will<br/>
sleep only the sleep that comes to those working hard every day. She&#39;ll<br/>
learn more about herself and her values and her father than you can write<br/>
about in a month of Sundays.<br/>
<br/>
You would deny her this? for what??  More TV?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would you care what school authroities would say? They are not raising<br/>
this child?<br/>
<br/>
Is she still learning?????????????  Ayiyiyi<br/>
<br/>
What would *seem right** to you.  What is the *right way* to spend your time<br/>
at 12??  And who decided there was only one right way??</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72725176">She&#39;s learning geography, communication and business <br/>
skills, &#39;driver&#39;s ed&#39; and whatever else they talk about <br/>
while they&#39;re on the road :-)  I had a bit of the <br/>
&#39;child labour&#39; argument with an LEA bloke who came to a <br/>
home ed support meeting (totally out of line, I <br/>
thought) a few months ago, we were discussion what the <br/>
LEA&#39;s role actually legally is, and what his job should <br/>
be, and he said that it was possible that a child <br/>
(well, 14yo-ish was his suggestion) had been <br/>
deregistered from school to work on the parents&#39; farm.  <br/>
I agreed that that could happen, but what if that was <br/>
what the child wanted to do?  He didn&#39;t really answer, <br/>
as if what the child wanted had nothing to do with <br/>
it...  Thing is I know of a family where the son was <br/>
asking to dereg cos he really did just want to work on <br/>
the farm and the school stuff was totally irrelevant.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s my point?  If she wasn&#39;t enjoying going, if she <br/>
were being abused (as in &#39;misused&#39;) you&#39;d know.  So <br/>
while she&#39;s enjoying it, what&#39;s the problem?  If you&#39;re <br/>
worried about learning, stick a couple of books in with <br/>
her lunch :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you need to get used to her having her own life?<br/>

<div><font size="4">In response to the farming issue, many Mennonites have a 
strong work ethic and expect and teach their children to be&nbsp; able to work 
by this age. It is considered normal in their culture. Most families put the 
money earned away for the child. In the process they often learn a valuable 
trade, such as carpentry or iron work. Personally, I would consider this an 
excellent education. If they were going to an &quot;Agricultural high school&quot; Like 
Essex Agricultural School in Massachusetts, they would be learning similar 
things, but because it is taught by the government is it superior? 
NOT!</font></div>
