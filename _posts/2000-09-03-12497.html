  defines abuse&quot; Here is the law in black and white. It applies to all 50 
  states.</font></p><br><br>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#00ff40" size="+3">&quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT 
  ACT&quot;</font><br><font size="+2">The Public Law 100-294</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or 
  mental injury, act of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or 
  maltreatment of any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law 
  of the State in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not 
  involving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a residential 
  facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who is responsible 
  for the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate that the child&#39;s 
  health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, 
  persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or 
  assist any other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any 
  simulation of such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction 
  of such conduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual

  <p><b><font size="+1">As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, 
  the act now also includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for 
  an infant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.</font></b></p>
  <p>
  <center><b><font color="#00ff40" size="+3">WHAT IS MALTREATMENT 
  ?</font></b></center>
  <p></p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">The following categories basically all fit under the 
  heading Maltreatment:</font></b></p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">PHYSICAL ABUSE</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of 
  physical injury by punching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm 
  twisting, hair pulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or 
  care giver may not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have 
  resulted from over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to 
  the child&#39;s age. However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to 
  a child is abuse whether it was intended or not.</font></b></p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">CHILD NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care 
  givers part to provide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, 
  clothing and so on. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: 
  physical, educational, or emotional or can be just one alone.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">The latest national incidence study defines these three 
  types of neglect as follows.</font></b></p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">PHYSICAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking 
  health care or emergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged 
  child out of the home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate 
  supervision, leaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an 
  under aged child home alone to be responsible for younger 
  siblings.</font></b></p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged 
  child to commit the act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of 
  mandatory school age, every child has the right to education and should be in 
  school according to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special 
  educational need, such as knowing your child is in need of special education 
  classes and doing nothing about it.</font></b></p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">EMOTIONAL NEGLECT</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or 
  extreme spouse abuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use 
  by the child, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed 
  psychological care.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">It is extremely important to distinguish between willful 
  neglect and a parent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life 
  because of poverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts 
  that call for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who 
  is unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead, seek 
  assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing financial 
  assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.</font></b></p>
  <center>
  <p><b><font color="#ff0080" size="+2">EMOTIONAL ABUSE</font></b></p></center>
  <p><b><font size="+1">Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, 
  yelling, belittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and 
  affection, scapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or 
  financial state.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment 
  more often than not we find them occurring in combinations. 
  Emotional/psychological will most likely always be present as well. Emotional 
  abuse and neglect includes acts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any 
  other person responsible for the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could 
  possibly cause, serious behavioral, emotional, or mental 
  disorders.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="+1">In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of 
  parents or other caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s 
  behavior or condition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, 
  extreme even sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or 
  locking a child in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the 
  intervention of Child Protective Services.</font></b></p>

  I hope this clears up any disagreement over &quot;what defines abuse&quot; Here is<br/>
the law in black and white. It applies to all 50 states.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT ACT&quot;<br/>
  The Public Law 100-294<br/>
<br/>
  Defines child abuse and neglect as being any physical or mental injury,<br/>
act of sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent treatment, or maltreatment<br/>
of any child under the age of 18, unless the child protection law of the<br/>
State in, which the child resides specifies a younger age for cases not<br/>
involving sexual abuse, by a person, including any employee of a<br/>
residential facility or any staff person providing out-of- home care, who<br/>
is responsible for the child&#39;s welfare under circumstances, which indicate<br/>
that the child&#39;s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.<br/>
<br/>
  The Act defines sexual abuse as: the use, employment, persuasion,<br/>
inducement, enticement or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any<br/>
other person to engage in, any sexually explicit conduct (or any simulation<br/>
of such conduct) for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such<br/>
conduct, or rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual<br/>
exploitation of children, or incest with children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  1984 Child Abuse Amendments of (P.L. 98-457)<br/>
<br/>
  As a result of the above amendment to the Child Abuse Act, the act now<br/>
also includes the withholding of medically indicated treatment for an<br/>
infant&#39;s life-threatening conditions as child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  WHAT IS MALTREATMENT ?<br/>
<br/>
  The following categories basically all fit under the heading<br/>
Maltreatment:<br/>
<br/>
  PHYSICAL ABUSE<br/>
<br/>
  Physical abuse is defined by inflicting any type of physical injury by<br/>
punching, slapping, hitting, beating, kicking, biting, arm twisting, hair<br/>
pulling, burning, or otherwise harming a child. The parent or care giver<br/>
may not have intended to hurt the child and injury may have resulted from<br/>
over-discipline or physical punishment that is inappropriate to the child&#39;s<br/>
age. However, it is still abuse. Any physical act causing harm to a child<br/>
is abuse whether it was intended or not.<br/>
<br/>
  CHILD NEGLECT<br/>
<br/>
  Child neglect is defined by failure on the parents or care givers part to<br/>
provide for the child&#39;s basic needs, food, water, shelter, clothing and so<br/>
on. Child neglect can be a combination of the following: physical,<br/>
educational, or emotional or can be just one alone.<br/>
<br/>
  The latest national incidence study defines these three types of neglect<br/>
as follows.<br/>
<br/>
  PHYSICAL NEGLECT<br/>
<br/>
  Physical neglect includes refusal of or delay in seeking health care or<br/>
emergency medical services, abandonment, kicking an under aged child out of<br/>
the home. Not allowing a runaway to return home. Inadequate supervision,<br/>
leaving the child unattended for long periods of time. Leaving an under<br/>
aged child home alone to be responsible for younger siblings.<br/>
<br/>
  EDUCATIONAL NEGLECT<br/>
<br/>
  Educational neglect includes allowing your school aged child to commit<br/>
the act of chronic truancy, failure to enroll a child of mandatory school<br/>
age, every child has the right to education and should be in school<br/>
according to your states guidelines. Inattention to a special educational<br/>
need, such as knowing your child is in need of special education classes<br/>
and doing nothing about it.<br/>
<br/>
  EMOTIONAL NEGLECT<br/>
<br/>
  Emotional neglect includes such actions as chronic or extreme spouse<br/>
abuse in the child&#39;s presence. Knowledge of drug or alcohol use by the<br/>
child, or permission. Refusal of or failure to allow or provide needed<br/>
psychological care.<br/>
<br/>
  It is extremely important to distinguish between willful neglect and a<br/>
parent&#39;s or caretaker&#39;s failure to provide necessities of life because of<br/>
poverty or cultural norms. Say for example, willful neglect is acts that<br/>
call for Child Protective Services intervention. Whereas, if a parent who<br/>
is unable to provide the necessities of life due to poverty may, instead,<br/>
seek assistance from the governmental agencies charged with providing<br/>
financial assistance, health services, housing, or other basic services.<br/>
<br/>
  EMOTIONAL ABUSE<br/>
<br/>
  Emotional abuse includes but is not limited to: Screaming, yelling,<br/>
belittling, name calling, emotional detachment, lack of love and affection,<br/>
scapegoating, such as blaming the child for the adults problems or<br/>
financial state.<br/>
<br/>
  As you&#39;ve seen there are many forms of child maltreatment more often than<br/>
not we find them occurring in combinations. Emotional/psychological will<br/>
most likely always be present as well. Emotional abuse and neglect includes<br/>
acts or omissions by the parents, guardians or any other person responsible<br/>
for the child&#39;s care that have caused, or could possibly cause, serious<br/>
behavioral, emotional, or mental disorders.<br/>
<br/>
  In some cases of emotional/psychological abuse the acts of parents or<br/>
other caretakers alone, without any harm evident in the child&#39;s behavior or<br/>
condition, such as parents, guardian or care givers use excessive, extreme<br/>
even sometimes bizarre forms of punishment, such as torture, or locking a<br/>
child in a dark closet. These also are sufficient to warrant the<br/>
intervention of Child Protective Services.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lynda, this would be the case if there are marks left on the bare <br/>
fanny. Which, in my situation, there were not...let alone bruises. I <br/>
did not beat my child that day. I spanked him. There is a big <br/>
difference. <br/>
<br/>
I will agree with your above statement. I have a friend who works for <br/>
CPS. And their code is that a parent can use any object to spank a <br/>
child be it a belt, wooden spoon, paddle, switch, fist, open hand, <br/>
etc. as long as there is not a mark left on the child. Corallyn</div>

So the ringer becomes the physical evidence requirement. In other words,<br/>
bruising. A single smack on the bottom does not qualify, as implied in other<br/>
posts. I, too, was a &quot;mandated reporter&quot; when I taught public school. But we<br/>
were cautioned not to see child abuse behind every act of parental<br/>
discipline with which we personally disagreed. Obvious bruising was indeed<br/>
reportable. But bruising visible only when clothes were removed was a gray<br/>
area, because we had no legal right to require a child to remove his or her<br/>
clothes just to prove or disprove a hunch of ours (for obvious reasons).<br/>
<br/>
The law was intended to curtail children being regularly beaten like a drum.<br/>
It was never intended as the gov&#39;t taking the place of parents as<br/>
determiners of discipline methods. It&#39;s scary (to me, at least) how far from<br/>
the original intent we have come.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760189425">The intent was to stop child abuse in all of its many forms.  It was also<br/>
to stop the damages that later manifest themselves in a variety of ways and<br/>
usually end up costing the taxpayers in one form or another from the cost<br/>
of jails, the loss of lives (both figuratively and in reality) and the<br/>
future generations of prospective abusers.<br/>
<br/>
I once heard a speaker say that one way to judge whether or not something<br/>
was an acceptable form of discipline was to say to yourself, how would I<br/>
react if someone did that to me.  Another way was to think of how you would<br/>
react if you saw someone else doing that in the grocery store.  After a<br/>
pause, he then stated, well, if you wouldn&#39;t like it, if you would be<br/>
highly offended by it, if at that grocery store you would be irritated,<br/>
angry or embarassed by it, then why would it be o.k. for you to repeat the<br/>
same action against/to your child.<br/>
