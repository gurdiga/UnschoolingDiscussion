<div id="ygrps-yiv-440017047">I&#39;m still here.  It&#39;s my birthday and I decided to stick around for <br/>
another day.  Could somebody post something controversial and make it <br/>
a little more interesting? &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand about kids and white shirts.  The technology just isn&#39;t <br/>
there for cafepress to do a quality print on color shirts but they&#39;re <br/>
working on it so check back from time to time.  The shirts are 100% <br/>
cotton so they can be bleached.<br/>
<br/>
Susan, I love your shirts!  If I get enough cafecash, I&#39;m buying the <br/>
Plato one. :-)<br/>

could recommend it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145623668">Thanks!  It&#39;s gone now :-( but tell her Happy Birthday for me from a <br/>
fellow 12/21er.  It was such a cool day because it was the last <br/>
weekend day before Christmas and we had all kinds of people stopping <br/>
by to drop off presents and goodies and we had our own visiting to do <br/>
too.<br/>
