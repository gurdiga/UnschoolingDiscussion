<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997533469">Wow, what a weekend this has been. Shortly following my last post I packed up <br/>
and headed out for the weekend. As I drove, I kept wondering why I was so <br/>
invested in arguing the rights of others and their belief systems. Perhaps it is <br/>
the human part of me that pleads for justice, perhaps it is my inability to <br/>
remain narrow minded about things to which I don&#39;t understand, disagree with or <br/>
plain and simply don&#39;t like. Lots to dwell on, especially during a weekend I <br/>
had been looking forward to as my DH and the twins were doing their <br/>
daddy/daughters weekend and I was actually alone for 2 solid days. I had planned on using <br/>
this time alone to reflect on things going on in my own life and to really <br/>
pamper myself. Instead I spent it assisting my sister with a school project I <br/>
wholehearted disagree with. It was like I couldn&#39;t get away from the topics of <br/>
belief systems and how I fit in the scheme of things. Having not slept since <br/>
Thrusday night, I figured even while working on this irritating project, that <br/>
surely the sleep I was in such desparate need of, would come with ease. WRONG! <br/>
As I tossed and turned Saturday night, wishing my brain would shut down and <br/>
trying to find some semblance of personal peace, I reluctantly began channel <br/>
surfing on the TV. Nothing on but infomercials, I was pleased to find &quot;Back to the <br/>
Future&quot; in my moms VCR, a movie I loved so much when I was 14, I went <br/>
repeatedly to the afternoon matinee to watch. Back then, matinees were $2.50. Don&#39;t I <br/>
wish matinee&#39;s were still so cheap, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
As I lay there watching, the wheels in my brain still turning, I had a <br/>
lightbulb moment. A way in which I could make an analogy from a movie I loved. In <br/>
the movie, Marty McFly lives a life filled with bullies, an acoholic mother, an <br/>
uncle ready to be let out of prison, a father who operates from fear and <br/>
siblings who seemingly have no ambition. He has 2 people in his life that he finds <br/>
solice with, his girlfriend and the wacky scientist. As events unfold and <br/>
Marty is transported back to the time his parents met, it hit me like the Delorean <br/>
(sp?) he was driving! Here is what I mean:<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the time of his parents youth, utilizing his free will, Marty <br/>
begins to change the outcome of events that determined his life as he knew it <br/>
before he left 1984. Yet all the events still took place. It was through his use <br/>
of free-will that the outcomes changed. His parents still went to the dance and <br/>
fell in love, his father still had to confront his own school bully, and upon <br/>
returning to 1984, we find that his family still resides in the same house, <br/>
his brother and sister are still the same human forms, but all are in better <br/>
circumstances. Importantly to Marty, his girlfriend still loves him and the <br/>
wacky scientist isn&#39;t dead. This is where the belief in predestination and free <br/>
will being interconnected can be found. The predestined events still took place, <br/>
while the usage of freewill changed the outcome of the events. Perhaps this <br/>
analogy is far too simple, but having still not slept yet, I may be writing on <br/>
auto-pilot, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
So for me it is entirely possible to operate with both tenets in place. That <br/>
not each and everything is necessarily predestined and not everything is <br/>
free-will related, rather a combination of both. Oddly enough, some other events <br/>
took place and it seemed everywhere I turned someone was saying one of the <br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
       It was meant to be. <br/>
       It was inevitable.<br/>
       Dejavu.<br/>
       It was in God&#39;s plan.<br/>
       It was unavoidable.<br/>
       I couldn&#39;t help it.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m sure there may be many other phrases that would say the same thing, <br/>
those were the ones I heard directly over the last 2 days. For me, it hit <br/>
home that all of those phrases are be about predestiny, that each person that <br/>
said it, for whatever reason that they believed what they were saying, at those <br/>
moments in time, each encompasses the theory that somehow, someway whatever <br/>
happened, happened because it was meant to. Whether one uses those statements to <br/>
comfort themselves, protect themselves or to escape responsibility, makes no <br/>
difference. The statements alone prescribe that they believe the events were <br/>
destined to be what they were. For me, it&#39;s what I do following those events <br/>
that determines my existance until the next event.<br/>
<br/>
Just my tired thoughts,<br/>

As I drove, I kept wondering why I was so invested in arguing the rights of <br/>

to which I don&#39;t understand, disagree with or plain and simply don&#39;t like. <br/>
Lots to dwell on<br/>
<br/>
*** It was about understanding myself, and understanding why I can be <br/>
narrow-minded when I do understand, agree with or like something, yet open to <br/>
discovery, even in the cases I don&#39;t. For instance, I love unschooling, can&#39;t even <br/>
begin to imagine going back to a schooled way of everyday life, I am <br/>
narrow-minded about that choice. I have no intention to opening up to the shooling life. <br/>
On the other hand, I don&#39;t understand living a life from a place of fear for <br/>
the soul, yet I am open minded to learning how and why someone can. It was <br/>
about self-reflection.<br/>

***Which reads to me to be about choice. When it comes to personal choices, <br/>
mine are able to differ from anyone elses and don&#39;t require outside validation. <br/>
But that is just me, I have always been able to stand alone. Usually, when I <br/>
don&#39;t seem to be understood, I chalk it up to being the occasions I have to <br/>
agree to disagree. Then there are times when I get so frustrated with being <br/>
misunderstood, that I can hardly see straight. Those are the times I need to <br/>
reflect on me, this was one of those times. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s all or nothing, <br/>
but a medium at which the journey can be continued and beliefs do not have to <br/>
compromised. <br/>

understanding follows.  Sometimes the beliefs don&#39;t fit who you are anymore, somtimes <br/>
they fit better than they ever have before.    Maybe that&#39;ll make you feel a <br/>
bit better about it all?  lol  Maybe not!  <br/>

<br/>
It was very much like that all weekend long, in a good way. The way <br/>
everything I encountered kept falling back to what I was struggling with. I do feel <br/>
better, because I am completely at peace with my beliefs. These reflections have <br/>
not caused me to waver, but rather to steady and be true to who I am right <br/>
now. That&#39;s what I meant when I spoke earlier today of winking at the sky. It was <br/>
as if all that I am and believe was solidified by my weekened of reflection. <br/>
It was way cool and I&#39;ve been smiling all day. <br/>
