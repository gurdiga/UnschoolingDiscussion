<div id="ygrps-yiv-664681139">Hi Beth, my kids have the DS and LOVE it!! My 8yo can play any game <br/>
that he gets on it and had no trouble figuring out how to use the touch <br/>
screen or stylus pen. My 5yo can play a few games and also doesn&#39;t have <br/>
any problems using the touch screen/stylus pen or using the usual arrow <br/>
pad. They also had the SP&#39;s but quickly traded them in for the DS&#39;s as <br/>
the DS has more options and different types of games you can play <br/>
because of the touch screen and stylus pen. Also, the DS will play <br/>
gameboy advance games on it but only on the top screen. My 3yo dd has <br/>
become interested in the DS and tries to play Nintendog, Warioware, and <br/>
other Mario type games. She&#39;s now asking for her own.<br/>
<br/>
We have a variety of consoles here as well. The one that my kids seem <br/>
to use the most is the PS2. They also got and still get a lot of <br/>
thrills out of playing with the GameCube. They love playing Mario games <br/>
with GC. They tried the donkey konga bongos and that was two thumbs <br/>
down. PS2 offers more game varieties for different ages (the kids have <br/>
games as well as Dh and I), there are also cool accessories like the <br/>
eyetoy. My kids LOVE eyetoy. It&#39;s a camera that hooks up to the system. <br/>
The camera will be included with certain game packs like eyetoy 1 & 2, <br/>
eyetoy antigrav, and sometimes there are games that do not include the <br/>
camera. But anyway, your movements is what makes the game so much fun! <br/>
We have a blast as a family taking turns doing the karate game or the <br/>
window washing game. For Christmas, I bought something for the family <br/>
called Guitar Hero. It&#39;s a guitar controller that you connect to the <br/>
console and it comes with a game. You rock out like a crazy--very fun!! <br/>
It&#39;s similar to DDR (dance dance revolution) which is a dance pad <br/>
controller for a dance moves game, also very fun =D<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely avoid getting the Xbox 360. It was never ready to be <br/>
shipped--far too many problems for such an expensive item. Sometime <br/>
this year PS3 will be coming out along with Nintendo&#39;s new Revolution <br/>
(I believe is replacing GC, there will not be a new GC made-I could be <br/>
wrong).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think each of the consoles have something different to offer. <br/>
It will depend on what games your child likes too. Maybe she can surf <br/>
the net looking at the different games each console offers. Perhaps <br/>
there is one that has more games she&#39;d enjoy over any other. And of <br/>
course, you don&#39;t always have to get them new, try a game shop that <br/>
sells games/handhelds/consoles used.<br/>
