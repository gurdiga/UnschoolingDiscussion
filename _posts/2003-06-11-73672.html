<div id="ygrps-yiv-538148025">This is totally resonating with a set of tapes I borrowed from my boss - by poet David Whyte - perfect people are all around us.  Even those we fiercely oppose.  They are merely expressing humanity.  Fits unschooling, IMHO.  We let children express their humanity 24/7.<br/>

Any fans of his out there?<br/>

  &gt; I am not perfect but I like me the way I am.&gt;&gt;<br/>

  I&#39;m not sure who posted this as I am still 491 emails behind, but I just <br/>
  wanted to say that you ARE perfect, and each day you are probably trying to <br/>
  perfect a little more. But all in all there couldn&#39;t be a more perfect you.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s goes for everyone.<br/>
