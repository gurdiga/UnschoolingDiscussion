<div id="ygrps-yiv-380848389">&lt;&lt; . Divide and conquer.<br/>
Use bright-yellow-and-black caution tape ($7 from www.duct-tape.com) to <br/>
divide their play space, and tell them they can&#39;t cross to the other one&#39;s <br/>
side of <br/>
the room. Make believe you&#39;re arriving at the scene of a crime and the <br/>
giggles <br/>
should help them forget what they were fighting about.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A sales plug for another business! <br/>
(The original was Parenting Magazine being plugged by AOL.)<br/>
<br/>
Crime scene tape might be fun, once.  But it&#39;s not a crime to try to solve a <br/>
problem the best way a kid knows how to do it.   And it&#39;s still a kind of <br/>
time-out and &quot;go to your room.&quot;  Odds are the kids won&#39;t share a room, so the <br/>
crime scene tape would divide the house or tape them in.<br/>
<br/>
If something can be done with humor, it will probably help.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say Biblically-ish that I would SMITE Marty for Holly.   She would <br/>
say &quot;Marty won&#39;t let me play.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Should I smite him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;YES.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;MARTY, I am coming to smite thee.&quot;  And I would sometimes walk like a giant, <br/>
or at least come dramatically to suggest that maybe he should let Holly play <br/>
with him, if not then maybe later.  And he would.  And I didn&#39;t smite them, <br/>
but we joked about smiting.  &quot;Who should I smite?&quot;  And they would see that <br/>
smiting wasn&#39;t going to be the answer.   But it was an opening for what, if not <br/>
smiting, was a good thing for me to do?<br/>
<br/>
I think a good way to separate kids is to get one to do something real and <br/>
useful, either with you or off alone while you talk to the remaining one.   Feed <br/>
the cats or check the mailbox are good ones.   They only take a minute, and <br/>
that&#39;s long enough to cool off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210519676">The &#39;smite&#39; discussion that Sandra used an an example of alternatives to<br/>
the inane AOL parenting suggestions reminded me of something that I used to<br/>
do and even still pull out occasionally . . .<br/>
<br/>
When things got heated around here, I would take the &#39;offender&#39; in my arms<br/>
and remark that perhaps their behavior was less than kind and they probably<br/>
needed a licking . . . at which point I would start to lick them all over,<br/>
especially in ticklish spots . . . giggling and a quick return to<br/>
&#39;acceptable&#39; behavior ensued usually. . .particularly effective as, living<br/>
in Hawaii, my kids had on none or few clothes!<br/>
<br/>
Happy parenting in ways that work,<br/>
