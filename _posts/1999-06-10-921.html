<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Monty&#39;s one of my all-time favorite authors. I&#39;ve just ordered his newest<br/>
book, &quot;Shy Boy: The Horse That Came In From The Wild.&quot; Monty&#39;s personal<br/>
life story is amazing, all right - I&#39;ve often thought there are lessons in<br/>
what he&#39;s learned about relationships that we homeschoolers could benefit<br/>
from. I think if we ever sponsor a conference he&#39;s one person I&#39;d like to<br/>
invite as a speaker!<br/>
<br/>
I saved this note from my last visit to his website:<br/>

&lt;&lt;Educators are now looking into applying the Roberts technique in their<br/>
classrooms. Recently school administrators, teachers, and psychologists<br/>
have been visiting the Farm in increasing numbers. Applied to humans,<br/>
Roberts&#39; technique always offers alternatives without the fear of pain or<br/>
punishment. &quot;Make it easy for the child or adult to Join-Uptm with you,<br/>
rather than struggle against you,&quot; says Monty. As word of Monty&#39;s work has<br/>
spread, people who know nothing about horses have become interested in<br/>
studying how his approach to communication may help people to interact more<br/>
effectively with other people.&gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt;lines of &quot;There&#39;s no such thing as teaching, only learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. I believe that might be verbatim. It&#39;s certainly classic Monty!<br/>

<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more and I would love to hear him as a speaker at a <br/>
conference like that.  Often people don&#39;t like it when I say that I think <br/>
things can be learned from first rate animal people (like Monty) that are <br/>
useful in homeschooling or parenting.  I&#39;m glad to see someone else on this <br/>
list likes him.<br/>
