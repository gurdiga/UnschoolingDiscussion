<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835435861">Hi Jackie;<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned trying to get pregnant for 7 years.  Though I know of<br/>
several mild conditions that go undiagnosed and can affect fertility, I<br/>
thought I&#39;d share a quick and easy experiment with you.  It took us 3<br/>
years of solidly trying and being devoted to the calendar and cycles<br/>
etc. for me to get pregnant.  A tip that a specialist offered me, as it<br/>
had just appeared in a study documented in the Journal of Medicine, was<br/>
taking a daily low-dose of Aspirin.  Heck, it can&#39;t really hurt to try,<br/>
can it?  Apparently, there are many women who actually are conceiving<br/>
but the uterine wall is hostile to implantation.  Either too thin or too<br/>
thick for the newly-developing fetus to nestle in.  Aspirin, with its<br/>
recognized blood-thinning abilities, can apparently solve a lot of those<br/>
problems.  Meanwhile, many women don&#39;t even know they&#39;re pregnant<br/>
because we miscarry so early we just assume it&#39;s a usual period.  As<br/>
well, aspirin can also help keep the fallopian tubes free-flowing for<br/>
the same reason.  There can be irregularities or inconsistencies that<br/>
impede the process of ovulation.  Since I&#39;ve learned a bit about this<br/>
and shared my info with others, 2 acquaintances have become pregnant. <br/>
(I like to think this idea helped.)<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t represent any pharmaceutical companies!!!  I wouldn&#39;t trust<br/>
this info if it had come from the makers of Aspirin.  My source seemed<br/>
totally impartial, and a generic brand of ASA works just as well.  Just<br/>
take one of those new &quot;low-dose&quot; formulas or break a regular strength<br/>
tablet in half.  If it doesn&#39;t work, you&#39;ll at least be reassured<br/>
there&#39;s nothing wrong with your uterine lining!<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea. <br/>
<br/>
I wish you lots of luck and never give up hope.  Another friend had a<br/>
baby 2 years ago (without medical intervention) after trying for 12<br/>
years!<br/>

&gt;     I sincerely apologize to you and anyone else who thought I am trying to<br/>
&gt; offer a cure.  Believe me, after trying for 7 years to get pregnant, I know<br/>
&gt; that homeopathy will not cure everything.  But I was hoping to say that<br/>
&gt; symptoms can be relieved or even eliminated.  Even doctors of homeopathy<br/>
&gt; recognize that some illness can also be hereditary.  This may mean that they<br/>
&gt; are very deep rooted and may take a long time to heal.  I believe this may be<br/>
&gt; the cause of my infertility.  But I also know that my daughter had migraine<br/>
&gt; headaches  3 times a week as a small child and she was allergic to many<br/>
&gt; different foods which would then bring on migraines, and thru homeopathy she<br/>
&gt; is now headache and allergy free.  I would never push anything on anyone - I<br/>
&gt; just want to share what has helped me and my family.  If I have offended or<br/>
&gt; hurt anyone, please accept my apologies and know that my intentions are pure.<br/>
&gt;  Good Luck to you!     jackie<br/>
