&lt;&lt;  He reminded me that the <br/>
 conference was a big success for him because he was able to have so much <br/>
 fun with Sierra and Jared just playing and doing their own thing <br/>
 (especially with Sierra). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well here I am, late to the conversation as usual.<br/>
Sierra and Liam were like secret friends...they seemed to understand each <br/>
other intuitively. I hope it&#39;s the same again, it looks like my whole crew is <br/>
coming !!! :)<br/>
<br/>
The freedom at the SC conference was great. If any of the kids got out of <br/>
hand in absence of the parents (which was rare btw) some nice adult would <br/>
just remind them that something was not appropriate for that particular area <br/>
or for the hotel or whatever, and they&#39;d find another way to play.<br/>
It was great.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Meanwhile, I got this amazingly beautiful hand-felted hat,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think of my felt-hat twin every time I wear mine!!! :)<br/>
Do bring it this year Marji!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>NOT! I so wish he&#39;d come. But he&#39;s not a group type of guy anyway, so even if <br/>
I could convince him the unschoolers wouldn&#39;t jump him, he would still shy <br/>
away from a family trip that involved hanging out with lots of other people.<br/>
We&#39;re total opposites that way.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s ok, cuz I really like road trips with just the kids and I better <br/>
anyway.<br/>
He&#39;s very anal about too much noise, too much mess etc...<br/>
At home it&#39;s fine because he can escape to his dungeon. On the road it&#39;s <br/>
different.<br/>
We have WAY more fun without him. Sounds terrible maybe, but it&#39;s true. <br/>
I LIKE travelling with the kids.<br/>
So anyhoo...the plan is to drive up the Atlanta route in one day. So I&#39;ll be <br/>
exhausted when we get there, but it&#39;s making the whole thing seem doable.:)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At a conference in Dallas, Jon was juggling balls from the pool table, and <br/>
one of them dropped and broke the glass on an end table nearby.  The hotel <br/>
was really pissed off about it, but one of the guys who was &quot;in charge&quot; at <br/>
the conference talked them down.  (He was very nice to Jon, too.)  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
plenty of rowdy kids at conferences.  Just because they have freedom and are <br/>
trusted, doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t be annoying to other people.  Doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they won&#39;t ride the elevators endlessly or press all the buttons in every car <br/>
or play tag in the hallways at 2 a.m.  I felt really sorry, for instance, for <br/>
the bride who had scheduled the cocktail portion of her wedding reception in <br/>
the lobby bar, which was completely surrounded by kids of all ages.  She and <br/>
her wedding party had to put up with barefoot kids clogging the elevators.  <br/>
(She&#39;ll know, next time, to find out what else is scheduled at her chosen <br/>
venue!)<br/>
<br/>
The thing about it is, most unschooled kids I&#39;ve met at conferences...if you <br/>
ask them, they&#39;ll stop doing that annoying or inconveniencing thing, or be <br/>
able to give you a reason why they were doing it, or at least say they didn&#39;t <br/>
know it could be annoying or inconveniencing.  You won&#39;t have to go to their <br/>
parents and get the &quot;my angel wouldn&#39;t do anything like that&quot; because you can <br/>
handle it right there, with kids who will look you in the eye and talk to <br/>
you.<br/>

You know what I think?  I think it may have been the Hell&#39;s Angels of <br/>
Elevators!  Those crazed elevator riders, going up and down and up and down <br/>
and up and down again and again and again!  I understand that their <br/>
pictures are posted at the information desks of hotels up and down the east <br/>
coast between Pensacola and Sunny Florida, New York.  Look, let&#39;s not be <br/>
coy.  We *all* know who the culprits were: Sierra and Liam, the feared <br/>
Elevator-jackers of Columbia&#39;s Clarion Hotel! (scary music here)<br/>

True story:<br/>
I pushed the ground floor button when I got in the elevator.   I ended up on <br/>
second, because someone (who was no longer standing there) had pushed at <br/>
second.  Marty was in the other elevator, also trying to go to first floor.  <br/>
We both ended up on the second floor, where I broke my leg a moment later.<br/>
<br/>
Sad but true.  <br/>
<br/>
I COULD have looked around and thought &quot;Not first floor, get back in&quot; but I <br/>
thought... &quot;what the heck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One thing I had on me was some stuff for the registration desk, so I was <br/>
needing to go to first anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think it would make any difference.  It did.  <br/>
<br/>
You never know what kinds of things will make a difference.  And some you&#39;re <br/>
sure will make a big difference seem not to! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

happened!!!<br/>
Otherwise I&#39;d be wondering for the life of me if we played a part in the <br/>
broken leg disaster. ACK!<br/>
We arrived AFTER Sandra had been taken to the hospital, just for the record.<br/>
And Marji and Liam arrived after that. Phew!<br/>

It&#39;s no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Elevators are some of the greatest toys ever made.  They&#39;re like transporters <br/>
for little kids.  And all those lights and numbers.  I would have played with <br/>
them if I had ever even been around any when I was little!  I went from a <br/>
very ratty rural neighborhood near Fort Worth to a town where the tallest <br/>
building was two stories and the nearest city was Santa Fe, which has a city <br/>
building code rule against buildings with more than two stories.  The few <br/>
three story pre-existing buildings were none of my business!<br/>
<br/>
I never got to play with elevators really until I was a teenager.  <br/>
Imagine. <br/>
I was deprived.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Elevators are some of the greatest toys ever made.  They&#39;re like transporters<br/>
&gt; for little kids.  And all those lights and numbers.  I would have played with<br/>
&gt; them if I had ever even been around any when I was little!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of a funny story.<br/>
<br/>
I went to a music conference in Los Angeles when my son was three years old.<br/>
My dh had been deployed on short notice, leaving me with a childcare<br/>
problem, and the husband of one of the planning committe members kindly<br/>
volunteered to watch Tim for the first session in the late afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
It took me forever to find them after the session.  They had been riding the<br/>
elevators; there were four of them in this huge, high-rise hotel.  Tim was<br/>
quite happy, but it really ammused me how much fun this 50-something year<br/>
old man had obviously had, riding elevators for two hours!  He must have<br/>
been elevator deprived, too!   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
