<div id="ygrps-yiv-826116464">I think  I have always been an unschooler.  Well, I was until I lost my nerve <br/>
and  <br/>
sent ds to Kindergarten the first year I would have to account for  him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
 <br/>
THIS is why I have periodic bouts of crazy objection to people whose kids  <br/>
aren&#39;t school-age saying they&#39;re unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
If a child went to school the first day of kindergarten...  he was a  kid who <br/>
was home with his mom until he went to kindergarten.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- When I <br/>
researched, I heard the term &quot;unschooler&quot; and I read up on  it and realized <br/>
that it <br/>
described our home in almost all aspects.   <br/>
=-<br/>
 <br/>
Except for that seminal aspect of not sending the kids to  school.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-One thing I never understood is, why call in un&quot;school&quot;ing?  It  still <br/>
contained &quot;school&quot; and that is totally NOT what we do. =-<br/>
 <br/>
EEEEEK!<br/>
It&#39;s totally what you say you did, though.  <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t.  My kids were un schooled.  Not schooled.  Never  schooled, at home <br/>
or at school.<br/>
People can school at home, so staying home doesn&#39;t  equal &quot;UNschooling&quot; <br/>
either.  Some poor kids get more school at home  than any school has time or energy <br/>
to inflict.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling (the label) does have a purpose.<br/>
 <br/>
-=Before we had a label, it all seemed <br/>
easier. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
But with support and a philosophy, you might have been brave enough to keep  <br/>
your son home.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  And he would have stayed being a kid at home with his Mom, without <br/>
labels, going on living the way we always had.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have support then or know where to find it.  We talked often, he <br/>
only went for 3 hours a day, he enjoyed it.  From 1130-230, for him it was <br/>
playtime, for me it was a nightmare.  He still had the same freedoms he always had.  <br/>
If he didn&#39;t want to go, he wouldn&#39;t.  I was scared about testing and <br/>
evaluations and all that other stuff just because he had become of compulsory school <br/>
age.  So I sent him.  He loved it and towards the end when I was hating it, he <br/>
wanted to finish, I didn&#39;t.  He did finish K and didn&#39;t want to go back.  His <br/>
teacher had told him the next year would be all day and he would eat lunch <br/>
there and blah blah blah.  He had fun in K but didn&#39;t like the idea of going <br/>
&quot;all day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it about choices?  If he asked me to attend now, I would let him.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want it but that&#39;s not what this is about.  I&#39;ve heard many people say <br/>
their kids wanted to attend for the social or whatever.  So they are no longer <br/>
unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
What I meant by not getting the term &quot;unschooled&quot; was that it almost sounded <br/>
to me like no learning at all.  So in the beginning I didn&#39;t get it.  I <br/>
remember telling someone that we were unschoolers and she was like, &quot;oh, you don&#39;t <br/>
send them to school, you teach them at home .&quot;  I said yes to that but added <br/>
that unschooling as opposed to homeschooling, is life learning, no curriculum.  <br/>
I will probably never explain it just right but that was the easiest way to <br/>
put it.<br/>
<br/>
I thought unschooling was a lifestyle, a philosophy of natural learning, a <br/>
way for children to develop their personal and intellectual needs.<br/>
<br/>
So because mine went to K, are we not unschoolers?  Do you have to start from <br/>
day one and never, ever go to school?  Maybe my label is wrong cuz he went <br/>
one year?<br/>
<br/>
Staying home definitely doesn&#39;t mean unschooled for everyone, but for us it <br/>
did and does, as far as what I understand the term to mean.<br/>
<br/>
So now that I am questioning the term again, what do you call the kids who <br/>
come home after years of schooling and then the family aims at UNschooling?  Is <br/>
there another term for this?  They&#39;ve been to school, so they are schooled.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get it.  All I know is we sidetracked to K when I was not sure of <br/>
things.  What we did before that year was not school at home, he was just a kid <br/>
with his Mom, true.  But that&#39;s all he is now too.  What we were before and now <br/>
is exactly the same except that I have to account for him because he is of <br/>
age.  He is unschooled now because we don&#39;t do school anywhere.  But we didn&#39;t <br/>
before either.  <br/>
<br/>
I get it and I don&#39;t.  I really need and want to go to that Live and Learn <br/>
Conference!!!<br/>

<br/>
Holly talks about going to school to see what it&#39;s liked.  If she does, <br/>
she&#39;ll be in school, and that&#39;s not unschooled.  That&#39;s in school.  If she stays <br/>
four or five years to graduate, why would I consider that we were unschooling <br/>
except Holly&#39;s in school?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-So because mine went to K, are we not unschoolers?  Do you have to start <br/>

<br/>
Others might count other ways, when there is a reason to quantify (which is <br/>
rarely), but I think you became an unschooler when you took him out of school.<br/>
<br/>
Others think different things, no doubt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
