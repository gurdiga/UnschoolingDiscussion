&lt;&lt; In a loving home where children are respected and where the parents are<br/>
involved with their kids lives (not glued to them but are with them and<br/>
aware of what&#39;s going on with them and what interests them) TV loses much of<br/>
the power that is found in homes where children are leading separate lives<br/>
from their families. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What Joyce said about schools separating parents and children is true.  <br/>
And television under those circumstances can be just one more, yet smaller, <br/>
factor in the child being influenced by something other than the parent.  It <br/>
can be the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, and it&#39;s also the only one the <br/>
parents really see happening.  School they try to fantasize as  happy, <br/>
productive, and good for the kids.  And maybe they miss their kids.  So when <br/>
the kids are home, it&#39;s easy for the parents to villify television.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the logic goes this way:<br/>
<br/>
Parents see their kids changing and becoming more distant.   <br/>
Parents have identified school as good and necessary.<br/>
School can&#39;t be the evil destruction.<br/>
Must be something else.<br/>
They see the child choosing to look at TV instead of at them.<br/>
<br/>
New homeschoolers and structured homeschoolers are often working from that <br/>
same model, that there is an education children need to obtain.  They don&#39;t <br/>
see those science/language/history/math units being represented well on <br/>
television.   So they see television as a factor that might somehow prevent <br/>
the acquisition of needed information.  That minute spent watching television <br/>
is a minute not spent reading about The Battle of Waterloo.<br/>
<br/>
In the past week at our house Waterloo has been presented to my children <br/>
twice.  Once by Black Adder Bact details, but few people do and fewer yet <br/>
really need to.  But they know France lost, they know it was not long after <br/>
the revolution, and they know the English commander was Wellington.   That <br/>
might be enough to enable them to mark the right answer on a variety of <br/>
multiple choice questions that might come along, or to get a right response <br/>
on Jeopardy.  <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago, there was an Amadeus marathon here (various people watching <br/>
it more than once, DVD commentary, &quot;come see this good part&quot;) and so there&#39;s <br/>
another point of information for them.  They can tell by costumes that Mozart <br/>
is before Waterloo, and by reference to Marie Antoinette being Queen of <br/>
France.  <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter in what order people learn things like that, or from what <br/>
sources, as long as they&#39;re sorting and connecting in their heads to create <br/>
their own model and understanding of history and the world and people, music, <br/>
costume, motive, results and affects.<br/>
<br/>
It might be hard to just work into conversation, but it&#39;s not hard to work <br/>
into conversation after seeing that if Black Adder dropped his time machine <br/>
on Wellington, England could&#39;ve been using francs instead of pounds.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s notebook (which the kids know about in part from <br/>
Dover coloring books) came up in both the Eddie Izzard DVD (in the French <br/>
part--he said just like da Vinci, he too had designed a helicopter that <br/>
didn&#39;t work) and on Black Adder (and Marty knew that was a fictional mention, <br/>
but still totally understood the reference).<br/>
<br/>
If they learn from a board game or comedy, it&#39;s probably going to stick <br/>
better than if they try to read a history textbook.  If they learn from a <br/>
book about armor and weapons and horses, they learned it just as well as if <br/>
they learned it from a list of the kings of France.   Too many people confuse <br/>
factoid with knowledge.  You can have the knowledge in vague yet very <br/>
colorful ways, which would make the list of facts make sense.  If you have a <br/>
list of facts without clues about what, why, when or how, it&#39;s just your eyes <br/>
gazing at words, and Charlemagne will look just like Louis XIV on that list, <br/>
a string of letters, black on white.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no hurry to learn it, there&#39;s no reason to learn it in order, and in <br/>
fact, teaching things &quot;in order&quot; is one of the major causes of kids deciding <br/>
at some point in school that they hate science or history or math.  Because <br/>
they didn&#39;t like one part in &quot;the order,&quot; they&#39;d rather never even look at <br/>
the rest than suffer one more moment, and they shut down.<br/>
<br/>
However pictures, sounds, and ideas get into my kids is good.<br/>
Whatever doesn&#39;t turn them against learning is good.<br/>
