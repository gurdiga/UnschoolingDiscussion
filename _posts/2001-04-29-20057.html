Our son spends lots of time alone in his room, and<br/>
*never* has no-noise time.  The whole time he&#39;s in<br/>
there he&#39;s humming, singing, doing sound effects and<br/>
&#39;voices&#39;, acting out the parts for his various action<br/>
figures or beanies, acting out the bits for the D&D<br/>
scenario he&#39;s designing... <br/>
<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; And I wonder what TV<br/>
&gt; does to him that causes him to not need or not want<br/>
&gt; to take this time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe TV WAS his downtime.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; This would be fine, except for the fact that I<br/>
&gt; really feel that kids need periods without &quot;noise&quot;<br/>
&gt; input. There&#39;s a big difference between sitting in<br/>
&gt; your room by yourself just thinking, and sitting in<br/>
&gt; front of a TV screen and watching. Monk does not<br/>
&gt; have silent time *at all* when he has access to the<br/>
&gt; television. He does have it (and he&#39;s pretty happy<br/>
&gt; with it, I might add) when the television is off. I<br/>
&gt; mean, if he could watch TV AND manage to have<br/>
&gt; &quot;non-noise&quot; down time, I&#39;d say that would be<br/>
&gt; ok...but he can&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Monk and I talked about this last night, and he<br/>
&gt; agreed that we could keep the TV off unless it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; rainy day or our special movie night. He seems OK<br/>
&gt; with that decision, and I&#39;m OK with it, too...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just think it&#39;s interesting that TV viewing has<br/>
&gt; such a profound effect on him.<br/>
