<div id="ygrps-yiv-863769493">This is the name of the virus that is being spread through this and <br/>
another message group. This is the 4th time it has been sent to me.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a virus protection program please run it on your system <br/>
so you can clean it. If you don&#39;t have a virus protection program, <br/>
you might want to think about getting one.<br/>
