Dogs that are bred to retreive /hunt have that trait imbedded in them. It <br/>
comes natural. We have 7mo and 2 mo old Brittany&#39;s that will point a fly. We <br/>
didnt teach them that it  came natural. Same goes with birds. They will if pushed <br/>
stop doing what they know pleases the owner. For instance someone over using <br/>
an ecollar can break a dog and ruin it. The dog will refuse to follow commands.<br/>
15-20 minutes a few times a day is fine. Once the dogs looses interest he/she <br/>
is done and the owner should stop as it is too be fun not work.<br/>
What is your concern? Is this a new dog?<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s not my dog, he&#39;s an acquaintance - he belongs to my mother&#39;s<br/>
neighbor.   I stopped to visit and his person told me their new dog,<br/>
another golden retriever, would chase the ball if I wanted to play, but<br/>
Teddy didn&#39;t like to any more after being trained for hunting.  <br/>
<br/>
Was he just trying to keep me from playing with his dog? &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve known<br/>
this guy for a few years, seems like he&#39;d just say so.  I&#39;d never heard<br/>
that a trained dog wouldn&#39;t want to play anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
My neighbor&#39;s Lab brings me the ball after she&#39;s worn out all the people<br/>
at her house, but she&#39;s not a hunting dog, just a tennis ball dog. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why are you asking?<br/>
<br/>
Some are trained to retrieve (force trained---ear pinch). They retrieve on <br/>
command. Most have enough (sometimes too much, in MY non-retriever mind) <br/>
instinct that they retrieve constantly and happily. It&#39;s what they do. (Like <br/>
expecting a terrier to not dig or a collie to not herd, expecting a retriever not to <br/>
retrieve is futile). <br/>
<br/>
But my Weimaraner was a ball NUT and carried a ball or bumper whenever she <br/>
could. We *could* tell her, &quot;Fui!&quot; and she would quit nagging us to throw it. <br/>
But her eyes would never leave it, and if you made *any* kind of move toward it, <br/>
she was back to nagging. <br/>
<br/>
Retrievers CRAVE retrieving. There ARE exceptions: some don&#39;t care at all. <br/>
Most worry you to death though---and some are just plain NUTS. Ball-obsessed.<br/>
<br/>
Why are you asking? Are you thinking of getting one? Already trained? <br/>
<br/>
Can ya&#39; just put her on the next plane?<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, who can&#39;t stand retrievers, but is oddly basenji-obsessed! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

(or lessen) desire.<br/>
<br/>
And trained dogs may be shocked to keep them from retrieving balls and <br/>
bumpers rather than birds. The BIRD is the game, not the toys.<br/>

 Might be that the dog knows the owner and his commands. Might be he taught <br/>
the dog not to hassle visitors. Hard to say.<br/>
You might be right too. Some hunting dog owners get touchy with people taking <br/>
control afraid the dog will not listen to them. Maybe he is afraid the dog <br/>
may like you more who knows. If it felt so it probably is that your feelings are <br/>
on cue. I know I sound unsure, I am. I have seen so many versions of hunting <br/>
dog owners that it really goes by the personality or the owner.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>well, and he might not want you to ruin the dog. <br/>
<br/>
A trained dog needs to KNOW that, if he&#39;s given a command to fetch, the <br/>
object is OUT THERE. As a trainer, I personally HATE when people pretend to throw a <br/>
bumper and the dog goes searching. MY dogs need to know that if I say a bird <br/>
(or whatever) is out there, that it IS out there. He has to trust me. That <br/>
teasing just pisses me off in a BIG way! HUGE pet peeve! I want my dogs to <br/>
believe when I say the bird is still there that the bird is still there---search <br/>
harder. Don&#39;t come back looking at me like, &quot;Where is it? Did ya&#39; throw it yet? <br/>
Huh? Huh?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell it strikes a nerve? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Out here in WV, where school closes for hunting season :o) a lot of hunting <br/>
dog owners only let them out to hunt, they stay in a run type kennel or tied up <br/>
otherwise :o(.  I think they believe it makes the dog better for hunting.  <br/>
Not sure why.  These dogs LIVE to hunt...possibly because that&#39;s their only <br/>
&quot;fun&quot; but also because it is meticulously bred into them.  I&#39;ve seen many hunters <br/>
pay more for their dog than their car.<br/>

the means. They NEED to retrieve that bird, no questions asked. I&#39;ve used the <br/>
ear-pinch. I KNOW it works--it makes a reliable retriever. But my dogs and I <br/>
prefer the &quot;fun&quot; way.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to admit I do this on occasion, not in the teasing way though.  My lab <br/>
loves to fetch.  Sometimes I throw the ball and she doesn&#39;t see where it <br/>
lands so she will search for a while then look at me like &quot;Mom ...where did it go&quot; <br/>
 so I pretend to throw it again with a real exaggerated throw, in the <br/>
direction that the ball went.  She then runs that way and will often come up with the <br/>
ball.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is just laziness on my part.  I don&#39;t want to run all the way down <br/>
in the field to retrieve the ball myself.  LOL.  It works most of the time but <br/>
occasionally I have to go actually point out where the ball is.  It is funny <br/>
to see her pounce on the ball when I am about 6 inches from it and look at me <br/>
like.  &quot;Didn&#39;t I do a good job Mom.&quot;  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, like Pam also said, I&#39;ve been guilty of doing this too.  Though not <br/>
just for &quot;kicks&quot;   Our lab LOVES to retrieve and play ball.  Sometimes if she <br/>
won&#39;t come when I call her ( and she is close enough to see me)  I pretend to <br/>
throw a ball so she comes running to look for it.   Then, I have her attention <br/>
and I can &quot;get&quot; her.   Of course, if I actually have a ball or a stick, or heck <br/>
anything.. lol, I&#39;ll just throw that to get her attention.   <br/>
