<div id="ygrps-yiv-648577138">Here&#39;s a link to an article I think some of you should respond to.  Hopefully <br/>
our best writers here will have a few choice words for her.<br/>

Here&#39;s a quote, to give you a taste:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Even with the help of home schooling organizations, home-schooled children <br/>
are often shortchanged. The worst public school has more to offer in the way <br/>
of resources than most parents can offer at home, such as science labs, <br/>
technology, foreign language, theater, large and varied curriculums, <br/>
textbooks, a variety of multi-media lesson support, clubs and sports. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her email addy is at the end. You do have to enter your zip code to get into <br/>
the article, but then it goes right to the whole article.<br/>
Enjoy. I&#39;m still gagging.<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
