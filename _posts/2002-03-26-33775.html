when i was a kid we enjoyed our house too. built forts in the living <br/>
room, etc. i remember how stunned i was to visit people&#39;s houses and <br/>

adults or go play quietly in the friends room. how stuffy!<br/>
<br/>
when the kids get older, she&#39;ll just have them sanded and refinished. <br/>
no big thing.<br/>
<br/>
wooden floors are really great!!<br/>

This was my husband&#39;s house when growing up. You couldn&#39;t play in the front yard because the camper and cars were there- you couldn&#39;t play in the living room because it was &quot;for guests&quot;- you couldn&#39;t take food in the car - you could only have 1 drink with dinner--- it was absurd! And somehow now that we have kids, all of these really absurd ideas have surfaced... he &quot;understands&quot; where his father was coming from - as kids do tend to mess things up - you wouldn&#39;t believe how many gold fish and raisins I have ground into the carpet of my van right now... it is a constant struggle...thankfully I am the one who is home most of the time :)  and we are slowly working on it ...<br/>
