<br/>
Well put.... and respectfully so! I was glad to see your eloquent response<br/>
here. I feel the same. We also limit some things and other things we limit<br/>
for a period of time, but find it&#39;s not necessary to do so at a later time.<br/>
<br/>
I also appreciated that you pointed out how important it is to acknowledge<br/>
that all families and children are different, and to be careful about<br/>
generalizing from one&#39;s own personal experiences to what all people should<br/>
do. What I find attractive about unschooling is that it&#39;s flexibility - we<br/>
learn to recognize and *respond* to our differences. How one family<br/>
unschools SHOULD be different (even if those differences are subtle and<br/>
minute) from how another family does it because we are different from each<br/>
other. It is not some rigid &#39;plan&#39; of dos and don&#39;ts that we do or dont&#39; do,<br/>
or policies that we must follow. I think that it is a trap that is easy to<br/>
fall into when we attach labels to what we do. It is for that reason that I<br/>
often hesitate to label how we, as a family, learn.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your articulate post!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:louisaem@...">louisaem@...</a><br/>
&gt;&gt; Personally I believe that limiting any interest does not reflect the ideals<br/>
&gt;&gt; of unschooling.  My TV is on all the time and my kids would rather do just<br/>
&gt;&gt; about anything else.  During the summer they rarely watch because we are<br/>
&gt;&gt; outside so much.  When I suggest an activity they show NO hesitation to<br/>
&gt;&gt; leave<br/>
&gt;&gt; the TV.  Even when it&#39;s on they are usually doing something else.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmmm, I&#39;d have to say I respectfully disagree with this one. Unschooling to<br/>
&gt; me means child-led learning, it does not mean that I give my kids free reign<br/>
&gt; to do whatever they want whenever they want to. There are things in life<br/>
&gt; that we limit, because of our own principles. For instance, in our family<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re vegetarians, we boycott all Nestle products, we don&#39;t allow toy guns<br/>
&gt; in our house, we ride our bicycles instead of taking our car, we buy almost<br/>
&gt; everything second-hand, and we don&#39;t watch TV. All of these things, we<br/>
&gt; believe are for the overall health and well-being of our family and/or for<br/>
&gt; the health and well-being of our earth.and other people. Are we not<br/>
&gt; unschooling because we&#39;re vegetarian?? Not unschooling because we won&#39;t buy<br/>
&gt; our son a mini replica Uzi? Not unschooling because we don&#39;t watch the<br/>
&gt; television? Not unschooling because our kids have to bicycle instead of<br/>
&gt; riding in the car? To me, unschooling is not a list of things we do or do<br/>
&gt; not do, it&#39;s a mind-set that allows my children to learn by following their<br/>
&gt; own interests instead of being told what to learn, when, and where. I<br/>
&gt; *don&#39;t* believe that means I have to allow them access to every single way<br/>
&gt; to learn things. Sure, they could learn anatomy and human sexuality by<br/>
&gt; watching porn movies. They could learn about hurricanes by watching TV.<br/>
&gt; Both, *I personally* believe are damaging. And why do I think TV is<br/>
&gt; damaging? Because young children don&#39;t have the mental context to place the<br/>
&gt; images they see in. Sure, my son might be watching a show about hurricanes,<br/>
&gt; but he will also see commercials where it is implied that you need this,<br/>
&gt; that, or the other product in order to be happy in life. He will see ads for<br/>
&gt; things that we are not going to buy (for frugality and earth-saving reasons)<br/>
&gt; and that until that point he didn&#39;t know existed (thus making his life and<br/>
&gt; ours so much happier, not to know about all the things you can&#39;t have :-).<br/>
&gt; He will also see ads for other programs with guns blazing or scantily clad<br/>
&gt; people pawing each other. At some point in his life, he&#39;ll be able to put<br/>
&gt; these images in a context, but it&#39;s pretty clear that right now all they do<br/>
&gt; is cause him concern, judging by the way he&#39;s reacted when he&#39;s seen them.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s an extraordinarily sensitive child and I&#39;d like to see him keep his<br/>
&gt; &quot;magic&quot; for a few more years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also think it&#39;s dangerous to generalize from one&#39;s own personal<br/>
&gt; experiences to every other person. I hear people say &quot;We have candy out all<br/>
&gt; the time and my kids never touch it&quot;, or &quot;we have the TV on all the time and<br/>
&gt; my kids rarely watch it&quot;. Well this is great, and it may work quite well for<br/>
&gt; those individual families. I also know families that have candy out all the<br/>
&gt; time and their kids are 40 pounds overweight. And I know families<br/>
&gt; that have the TV on all the time and the kids are glued to it like<br/>
&gt; little sponges for 7 hours a day. So much depends on individual kids and the<br/>
&gt; preferences and innate personalities they were born with, as well as the<br/>
&gt; family environment. All of this &quot;it&#39;s unschooling to do this&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; unschooling if you do that&quot;, &quot;some people CALL themselves unschoolers but<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re really not&quot;, etc. (not just responding to this particular post but<br/>
&gt; to many in the same vein) remind me of my high school punk rock days. It was<br/>
&gt; &quot;punk&quot; to do this, but &quot;poser&quot; to do that. I could never keep it all<br/>
&gt; straight and I still can&#39;t. If I wasn&#39;t &quot;punk&quot; because I wore Birkenstocks<br/>
&gt; with my mohawk, and I&#39;m not &quot;unschooling&quot; because I limit TV, well so be it<br/>
&gt; I guess :-)<br/>

<br/>
Ooh, I love talking about books. :) For funny (REALLY<br/>
FUNNY)adventure stories, try the Enchanted Forest<br/>
Chronicles. The first of the 4 books is Dealing With<br/>
Dragons. It&#39;s about a princess who doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
pawned off on a knight in shining armor, so she goes<br/>
to work for a dragon instead. The princess thing is<br/>
NOT only for girls. There are all sorts of dragons,<br/>
wizards, knights, princes, and other interesting<br/>
characters in the series. And for boys, it&#39;s great to<br/>
have a strong female character to admire now and then.<br/>
<br/>
If they like the British humor that&#39;s so popular with<br/>
the Harry Potter crowed, try Eva Ibbotson. Or Roald<br/>
Dahl. Island of the Aunts is a good Ibbotson books. So<br/>
is The Secret of Platform 13. And Which Witch. But I<br/>
liked the Aunts book best. Roald Dahl is the writer of<br/>
James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the<br/>
Chocolate Factory, but he&#39;s got lots more books, too.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all read-aloud suggestions. For reading on<br/>
their own, the older boys might like Cam Janson books<br/>
(lots of books in that series) Wayside School series<br/>
(very funny). My son likes the Animorphs series, but I<br/>
haven&#39;t read any of them. He says they&#39;re adventurous<br/>
and funny.And don&#39;t rule out books of comics like<br/>
Garfield, Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, etc. as a<br/>
non-intimidating way to ease kids into reading. Juli<br/>
