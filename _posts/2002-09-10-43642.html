<br/>
&gt;&gt;The autistic child wouldn&#39;t have been in the normal range for his age in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the &quot;your seven year old&quot; books, but because my kids were aware that there<br/>
are some things younger kids are still not good at and they were able to<br/>
treat him as being at an earlier developmental stage, it worked out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now that this has been brought up, I have another question. What a <br/>
shocker!!!<br/>
My kids also have no problem with children that are different in so far any <br/>
kind of way they have encounterd. Autistic, special needs or CP. I had a <br/>
fellow homeschooler come over to our house for a day of play and swimming. <br/>
She has a 6year old daughter that my daughter was thrilled to meet. Most her <br/>
age are boys in our group. I hadn&#39;t remembered this child but for once at a <br/>
park when she was 4. At that time I did notice she was happier to be alone <br/>
but when the mother said she was immature for age, I never thought twice <br/>
about it. She just seemed like she wasn&#39;t into playing with other kids at <br/>
that time.<br/>
<br/>
Well as soon as the mother and daughter walked into my house, I knew there <br/>
was something different. At the end of our play day, the mother and daughter <br/>
had fun, I was uncomfortable and my kids really didn&#39;t seem different aside <br/>
from the fact that they had no one to play with when they thought they were <br/>
going to. The child to me, as far as the info I have which isn&#39;t much, seems <br/>
slightly autistic. She doesn&#39;t interact at all with anyone. She talks but <br/>
not to anyone, not the kids or me or even her mom. She never makes eye <br/>
contact and just goes very quickly from one thing to another like no one <br/>
else is around. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because her mother doesn&#39;t <br/>
really watch her as if there is a problem. (my mother has a connecting MIL <br/>
quarters to our house and this little girl just walked right in never saying <br/>
a word and went into my mother&#39;s bedroom for awhile and then just left) I <br/>
found this out later. I&#39;ve never had any child, whether schoooled or not go <br/>
through my house like that. So I had to watch her and make comments when she <br/>
did what we don&#39;t do here in the house. Like push people and grab things <br/>
from others and so on.<br/>
<br/>
My kids tried to play with her but it just wasn&#39;t possible. They had nothing <br/>
to say other than she seemed to not like them. The mother gives no <br/>
indication at all that she sees a problem. She just says being an only <br/>
child, that the girl is immature. Now the only autistic children I know go <br/>
to special classes daily. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the best thing or not but I <br/>
can&#39;t help but wonder that maybe this child could benefit from some other <br/>
type of help the mother isn&#39;t giving. The mother unschools in as far as I <br/>
know of, only not having work to do. I know nothing else of how she is with <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
Do I say something to this mother? She frequently calls me for advice and <br/>
marvles at how I do it with 4 kids and thanks me greatly for suggestions I <br/>
have made that help her. Now I see things differently and realize why she <br/>
seems to need help with things. Not usre if it&#39;s for me to say something or <br/>
what I would exactly say.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Mary -<br/>
This does sound like an awkward situation.<br/>
I might say something like &quot;so, did your daughter have a good time at our<br/>
house the other day when you visited? My kids mentioned that she didn&#39;t<br/>
really want to play with them and they were wondering why. Did she say<br/>
anything to you about it? Does she act that way to most other children, too?<br/>
Does she have any close friends? etc..&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This line of questioning might sound a bit intrusive depending on the type<br/>
of relationship you have with her. But you mentioned that she calls you for<br/>
advice so you may be able to delve into deeper questions. Who knows? Maybe<br/>
she&#39;d really like to break down and talk to someone about her daughter, or<br/>
maybe she really is ignoring the subtle ways her daughter is acting<br/>
inappropriately in social situations. If she&#39;s the one pursuing your<br/>
friendship and advice, I would press for more information about her daughter<br/>
and how she feels about her. JMO.<br/>
Hope it all works out.<br/>
