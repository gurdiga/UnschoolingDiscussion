<div id="ygrps-yiv-2135092596">We own besides our dog, 2 cats and 1 fish.  And I say own because in <br/>
the city you are required to keep your dog on a leash, your cats <br/>
inside.  Therefore we do confine them and they do eat confined.  <br/>
Arguing against confinement and forced caged feeding is impractical <br/>
in the city.<br/>
Should I be considered up on cruelty charges then?  Asking facetously.<br/>
Ha, Ha.<br/>
Seriously, I wish we continued to live in the country but we don&#39;t.<br/>
So for their safety and our legal stability, they have to consider <br/>
our home their cage.  They are our responsibility.  We chose to bring <br/>
them home.<br/>
<br/>
On to a silly note, I&#39;m petrified of spiders and so kill any thing <br/>
that gets near me,  hope we can still be friends!   :)<br/>
<br/>
This is fun!<br/>

reputation amongst them!  &lt;G&gt;  When I was a wee one and even into my late <br/>
20s, I had a severe phobia of creepy crawlies.  But, I overcame the fear <br/>
because I did not want to pass it on to my son.  I was willing to exist <br/>
with bugs and such, but then I felt that I needed to go further.  So, I <br/>
would take great care to watch bugs crawl and really try to get past <br/>
whatever it was inside me that revulsed me.  Then, I read a lot about bugs <br/>
because I had heard that fear comes from the unknown.  It really worked, <br/>
and I don&#39;t have the fears I used to have.  (I&#39;m still cautious about being <br/>
injured and I wear work gloves when working in the barn or at a wood pile, <br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
But, these are MY OWN choices, and I have absolutely no problem with <br/>
you!  We can still be friends!<br/>

Yeah, sometimes I think that our pets are more pampered than our kids.<br/>
They each have a person that they have adopted.  <br/>
Our biggest problem is getting the dog/cats to get along.<br/>
<br/>
I remember only all too well the years of woodworking and burning <br/>
stoves.  I have the scars to prove it.<br/>
<br/>
But I doubt if spiders and I will ever get along.  Ladybugs are my <br/>
friend though.  <br/>
<br/>
We captured a frog the other night to keep for 2 days to observe.  I <br/>
screamed and jumped so loud when that thing started leaping around my <br/>
hands.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Talk to ya later<br/>
