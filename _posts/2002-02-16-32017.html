<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442816519">Good: That my soon to be 6yo son took it upon himself to cut his hair <br/>
because it was too long for him and bothered him. I see it as a sign <br/>
that he is &#39;coming into himself and his own awareness thereof&#39;. He <br/>
did it carefully and made sure he didn&#39;t make a mess.<br/>
<br/>
Bad: The way people respond with slight looks of horror when they see <br/>
him, ask me about the huge chunks of hair missing in the front, and I <br/>
say very happily that he cut his hair, and he likes the way it looks.<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: That his own father &#39;likes his hair long&#39; and wants him to grow <br/>
it back instead of getting a &#39;buzz&#39; cut like the kid wants.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to say I&#39;m *really* pleased that my son is growing his hair.  But I <br/>
certainly haven&#39;t told *him* that.  &lt;g&gt;  And I never said anything about <br/>
not liking it short.<br/>
