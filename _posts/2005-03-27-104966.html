<div id="ygrps-yiv-412134468">I&#39;m pretty new here, but I thought I would share an<br/>
anecdote...<br/>
<br/>
When my sister was about 10 or 11, she started<br/>
toreally gain some weight.  She was eating a *lot* of<br/>
junk, especially fast food and it was getting to the<br/>
point where even my grandmother was starting to say<br/>
&quot;maybe you shouldn&#39;t have that second burger,<br/>
sweetie&quot;.  She was starting to look downright<br/>
chunky...<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, over the next three months she grew<br/>
about 6 inches. She was *definately* not chunky after<br/>
that. As a matter of fact she was painfully thin<br/>
looking for several years.  She probably could have<br/>
standed to eat even more during that time when her<br/>
body was getting ready to grow.  <br/>
<br/>
I think generally, the body knows what it needs, if we<br/>
are able to listen.<br/>
