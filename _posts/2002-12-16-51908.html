 </span></blockquote>In the past several weeks, I have found the times tables virtually useless,<br/>
but could use your son quite a bit.  My car isn&#39;t behaving itself, so my<br/>
main math use lately has been addition, as in, adding up repair and<br/>
replacement costs for all the things currently wrong.  Ugh.<br/>
