We started homeschooling right from the start, about 5 years ago. My kids have ALWAYS balked and complained about doing ANYTHING that I wanted them to do. It was a constant struggle complete with yelling, crying, nagging, complaining, etc.<br/>
I probably did some damage myself with my homeschoolish notions. (Imagine ME, trying to be a teacher! Ha!)<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s why I&#39;m so grateful to have finally found unschooling. All of the bad stuff about homeschooling is gone now.<br/>
Our house is much more peaceful and less stressful. And I&#39;m being patient with my kids and them learning things at their own pace, or at all.<br/>

  I have a son much like this, and I *did* push him a little to learn.  Big <br/>
  mistake.  It backfired.  But he didn&#39;t want to learn then.  Because he <br/>
  didn&#39;t want to, it was hard for him, and then he decided he couldn&#39;t.  I <br/>
  had to back off and let him do it his own way and in his own time.  He <br/>
  still doesn&#39;t read well at 14, but he definitely doesn&#39;t want any <br/>
  help.  (Both family and out of family help have been offered.)<br/>

It&#39;s a shared mystery here, too.  I have a friend (we&#39;ve been friends since<br/>
2nd grade) who started HSing a year after I did.  Because my dd only went to<br/>
kindergarten (plus a &#39;play&#39; pre-school) and I had an aquaintence who<br/>
mentioned unschooling (causing me to get information!).....I came fairly<br/>
quickly to the unschooling way....though the process of de-schooling still<br/>
happens in me at imes!<br/>
<br/>
Every time I speak with my friend....she is really stressed about getting<br/>
through their chosen curriculum (which changes,  since she&#39;s trying to find<br/>
one they can work with.)  three yrs later,  she&#39;s still fighting with her<br/>
sons on academics.  Recently,  she told me how she &quot;had to ground&quot; her ds<br/>
for failing a math quiz!  (WHich I tought was really strange,  since I have<br/>
no idea why you&#39;d &#39;ground&#39; a child for that...even if you sent him to<br/>
school!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,   I try to gently point out things....like the flexibility,  like<br/>
her &quot;5th&quot; grader being old enough to do his work independently....like her 3<br/>
children having different needs.....and without namimg it,  explain my<br/>
*relaxed approach*<br/>

the type of questions they asked and what problems they had.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of it is lifestyle and parenting style. In a home where there<br/>
is no questioning that mom is dictator and that chores and schoolwork and so<br/>

respect is the key. Discipline without the respect I suspect is chancey at<br/>
best at turning out mentally healthy kids. But I think discipline and<br/>
respect are a tough thing to work out naturally since most people are more<br/>
naturally inclined to discipline than respect and if respect without the<br/>
discipline works, then why take chances?<br/>
<br/>
There are all sorts of disciplining techniques for when children disobey,<br/>
and how to enforce that what mom says isn&#39;t to be questioned. If you go to a<br/>
Christian homeschooling website, there are parenting books that help parents<br/>
of &quot;willful&quot; children.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect there are some kids who do take to schoolish methods. There<br/>
actually are kids who love school :-) and those parenst are the ones who<br/>
will speak up about how wonderfully it all works. Others may agree because,<br/>
though they&#39;re having some problems, they&#39;re working towards that ideal so<br/>
it&#39;s only a matter of time before they get that to that point. And others<br/>
keep silent because they&#39;re ready to wring each other&#39;s necks and are<br/>
wondering what&#39;s wrong with their kids that they aren&#39;t doing what they&#39;re<br/>
told.<br/>

  naturally inclined to discipline than respect and if respect without the<br/>
  discipline works, then why take chances?<br/>
  For the past 5 yrs of trying to homeschool I have been wondering what I am doing wrong that my kids resist doing anything I suggest doing, in terms of schoolwork. I have friends that homeschool. Some I know have the same problems I do. Some do seem to have complacent kids. One family sticks out in that they are not fundamentalist Christian and her kids do tons of work and seem so bookish and smart. They do full Calvert and even other things on top of that. I can see, she is the dictator type that demands respect. Her kids seems to be thriving. She bugs the heck out of me sometimes with her comments, though. She complains about her 11 yo son being a &quot;straight B&quot; student. His efforts are lacking, in her eyes, she still complains about his &quot;writing ability&quot; or lack thereof. I know this kid is doing tons more work than my 10 yo son.<br/>
<br/>
  As to how she *gets* her kids to do the work, I asked her once. She says the threat of going back to school is always there. And also she only lets her kids do the things they want (like gaming or having friends over) only when their schoolwork is done.<br/>
  She got kind of annoyed with my question like &quot;Duh, you&#39;re the mom. You&#39;re in charge.&quot;<br/>
  I don&#39;t know, I tried those things too, with my kids, and didn&#39;t get anywhere. That&#39;s why I&#39;m unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for your input to my question.<br/>

I only have homeschooling friends, no unschoolers yet, except here and unschooling.com. (thankful for that)<br/>
I am still pretty quiet about my unschooling ways, I&#39;m still to new to get into any debates about it :-)<br/>
But I know people who also seem to go way overboard with the school-at-home thing.<br/>
<br/>
One friend I know has a 13 yo son doing Saxon beginning algebra.<br/>
He is really struggling with it, and says she is so upset because he is so careless with his work and gets so many of his problems wrong doing his lessons. We used to do Saxon. I told her I had in incentive worked out for my son to try and not be so careless. If he got 5 or less wrong (out of 20-25 problems), he wouldn&#39;t have to go back and correct them. That was fine with me.<br/>
I told her this and she looked at me like I was crazy and said &quot;5 wrong! I can&#39;t accept that. That&#39;s not good enough for me!&quot;<br/>
I just shut up at that point. We don&#39;t do Saxon any more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130958580">I think, because of complex emotional reasons, some kids rebel outright and<br/>
others rebel by going through the motions  focusing on convincing mommy<br/>
that they really are learning what she wants them to learn. This destroys<br/>
their innate intelligence, but may produce a kind of superficial knowledge<br/>
or skill. Read John Holts How Children Fail (Revised Edition) for a<br/>
detailed description of how this happens in school  applicable to home<br/>
schools, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678931699">I mostly lurk here, speaking up on the rare occasion. (Mostly because my dd <br/>
is at home happily running here and there, learning chess and reading Stuart <br/>
Little. and my younger child, ds, is just as happy sitting behind a desk with <br/>
all the other kids on the block. And I have been blasted for that choice one <br/>
too many times here.) When my dh and I decided to unschool, we decided it <br/>
would only work if our children knew that they would always have the freedom <br/>
to choose just like Mom and Dad. And things just fell into place for us after <br/>
making that decision. My dd just thrived on play all day activities, she <br/>
loved to learn to read, and enjoys all sorts of science and math projects. <br/>
For her unschooling is like breathing. Then her little brother comes along <br/>
and he and I butt heads right from the start, unschooling has made him a <br/>
lazy, willful child. To make matters worse, last summer he announces that <br/>
since his two bestfriends are heading off to kindergarten, he is too! I was <br/>
stumped, flabbergasted, appalled!!! My husband gave me a wicked grin and said <br/>
&quot;This is Jack&#39;s unschooling! His choice is to go to school, and we have to <br/>
honor it.&quot; So last August I went to the local school and enrolled him, then I <br/>
went to the K teacher and informed her my son would be in her class, and even <br/>
though I wasn&#39;t too pleased with his choice I would be available to her at <br/>
any time.  My little boy who wouldn&#39;t lift a finger to help around the house, <br/>
(We don&#39;t do chores, as my dh and I feel that if something needs to be done <br/>
than whom ever is available to help helps.) who never took an interest in <br/>
books, and was constantly bouncing off the walls resisting all attempts to <br/>
engage him in an activity.... Is a gem at school, sits quietly as expected, <br/>
loves his teacher.... and on and on. ;o) <br/>
So no, unschooling doesn&#39;t work for all, but fostering an environment of <br/>
respect and trust does. My son feels good about his choice, and after <br/>
swallowing my reservations, I feel good about his choice too. My daughter <br/>
loves the 7 1/2 uninterrupted hours of Mom time every day, and my Husband <br/>
just enjoys being able to give me that wicked grin whenever Jack rushes in to <br/>
tell us all about the letter U and Uncle Upton hanging Upside-down from the <br/>
Umbrella tree! All because he knows I am thinking &quot;Didn&#39;t I try something <br/>
just like that?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068546335">This is what I find so sad. The realization that maybe most homeschool families operate like I did.<br/>
The amount of unhappiness, frustration and dissapointment must be so prevalant in so many homeschoolers.<br/>
This is what I found when trying to homeschool, and we were all miserable.<br/>
One thing that has stuck in my head that I read somewhere was something like this:<br/>
If your child hates doing his/her schoolwork and you are both yelling, complaining, nagging, crying, etc. then you might as well send your child to school so they can hate their teacher instead of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543360733">To me, *that&#39;s* unschooling... what the *child* needs and catering to those needs, even if it means... choke, choke... driving up to that old school house and dropping him off!<br/>
Good for you and I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve come back to post on the list. <br/>

  Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] homeschooling mystery<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I mostly lurk here, speaking up on the rare occasion. (Mostly because my dd <br/>
  is at home happily running here and there, learning chess and reading Stuart <br/>
  Little. and my younger child, ds, is just as happy sitting behind a desk with <br/>
  all the other kids on the block. And I have been blasted for that choice one <br/>
  too many times here.) When my dh and I decided to unschool, we decided it <br/>
  would only work if our children knew that they would always have the freedom <br/>
  to choose just like Mom and Dad. And things just fell into place for us after <br/>
  making that decision. My dd just thrived on play all day activities, she <br/>
  loved to learn to read, and enjoys all sorts of science and math projects. <br/>
  For her unschooling is like breathing. Then her little brother comes along <br/>
  and he and I butt heads right from the start, unschooling has made him a <br/>
  lazy, willful child. To make matters worse, last summer he announces that <br/>
  since his two bestfriends are heading off to kindergarten, he is too! I was <br/>
  stumped, flabbergasted, appalled!!! My husband gave me a wicked grin and said <br/>
  &quot;This is Jack&#39;s unschooling! His choice is to go to school, and we have to <br/>
  honor it.&quot; So last August I went to the local school and enrolled him, then I <br/>
  went to the K teacher and informed her my son would be in her class, and even <br/>
  though I wasn&#39;t too pleased with his choice I would be available to her at <br/>
  any time.  My little boy who wouldn&#39;t lift a finger to help around the house, <br/>
  (We don&#39;t do chores, as my dh and I feel that if something needs to be done <br/>
  than whom ever is available to help helps.) who never took an interest in <br/>
  books, and was constantly bouncing off the walls resisting all attempts to <br/>
  engage him in an activity.... Is a gem at school, sits quietly as expected, <br/>
  loves his teacher.... and on and on. ;o) <br/>
  So no, unschooling doesn&#39;t work for all, but fostering an environment of <br/>
  respect and trust does. My son feels good about his choice, and after <br/>
  swallowing my reservations, I feel good about his choice too. My daughter <br/>
  loves the 7 1/2 uninterrupted hours of Mom time every day, and my Husband <br/>
  just enjoys being able to give me that wicked grin whenever Jack rushes in to <br/>
  tell us all about the letter U and Uncle Upton hanging Upside-down from the <br/>
  Umbrella tree! All because he knows I am thinking &quot;Didn&#39;t I try something <br/>
  just like that?&quot;<br/>

&gt; Could you explain a bit more what you mean by that? I mean, like how was it <br/>
&gt; determined that he was lazy and willful, and who did the determing? Thanks<br/>
