<br/>
&quot;I have had eczema on and off since I was a teenager. Mine seems to be<br/>
triggered by stress and in college I had it around my eyes so bad that<br/>
they<br/>
would swell shut. There were a lot of times where I couldn&#39;t wear<br/>
contacts<br/>
and I have never been able to wear eye makeup without a lot if<br/>
irritation.<br/>
(By the way, I can wear NICOLE MILLER and for the last year have even<br/>
been<br/>
wearing mascara and eye liner without any allergic reactions!)<br/>
<br/>
While the eczema on my face, hands, and arms would come and go I could<br/>
never get rid of a patch of it on my neck and it has been there for<br/>
almost<br/>
10 years! (I am 32.) Before going to Convention 2000 I swam in the ocean<br/>
twice<br/>
and couldn&#39;t stay in very long because the eczema on my neck stung so<br/>
badly.<br/>
<br/>
While strolling through the product store at Convention I put some<br/>
Moistursil on my eczema and it immediately felt better and smoother. I<br/>
went<br/>
and bought products and they forgot to put the Moistursil in my bag. I<br/>
didn&#39;t get to use it again that day but even after going to the pool and<br/>
showering it still felt better the next day. I brought my receipt back<br/>
and<br/>
they gave me the Moistursil no questions asked. By Sunday the eczema on<br/>
my<br/>
neck was COMPLETELY GONE.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve now been home from Convention for a few days and I can&#39;t believe<br/>
how<br/>
this <br/>
one little product has made me feel better, look better, and has really<br/>
changed my life. My passion is scuba diving and now<br/>
I can enjoy it without pain and discomfort. <br/>
<br/>
We have the power to change other peoples lives in so many positive ways <br/>
just by sharing from our heart what Melaleuca means to us. Don&#39;t let <br/>
anyone or anything keep you from enhancing other people&#39;s lives and<br/>
reaching <br/>
your goals, No Matter What!<br/>
