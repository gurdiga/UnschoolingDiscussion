<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592020390">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Quick intro.  My name is Cherry.  My son is 3 1/2.  I&#39;ve been lurking <br/>
almost a month now.  I hope that Sandra Dodd, Ned Vare and Bob (sorry <br/>
can&#39;t remember your last name) all continue to post, whatever you <br/>
desire on this list. I don&#39;t always agree with any one of you, but I <br/>
see the value in all of your collective wisdom.  I think you all <br/>
offer great point/counterpoint and plenty to discuss and think <br/>
about.  And that is the point of this list right?  Pardon me if this <br/>
is too much of a stretch but your styles remind me of the Malcolm X <br/>
vs. Martin Luther King discussions back in the day.  Forward movement <br/>
through peaceful march and example or through the sword and the <br/>
hardline.  I think both are necessary in this unbalanced world, so I <br/>
appreciate both of you.<br/>
<br/>
Hi Beth :)<br/>
<br/>
Going back to lurking now<br/>
