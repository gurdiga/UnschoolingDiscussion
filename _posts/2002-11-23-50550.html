<div id="ygrps-yiv-717617197">I am also concerned about my childrens safety online.  One has to <br/>
actively monitor thier childrens Internet activity and set down clear <br/>
guidelines for Internet use.  I think the ideal situation for a teen <br/>
group would be one where teens feel they can be open and <br/>
straightforward with thier comments and discussion without &quot;grown up&quot; <br/>
interference.. Yet, they still need that bit of unintrusive <br/>
supervision to insure that nothing totally inappropiate ensues. Its <br/>
kind of a Catch 22.. Teens won&#39;t engage in peer to peer discussions <br/>
and conversations if they think adults are going to be reading and <br/>
monitoring everything they say.  Remember when you were a teen?  Did <br/>
you want your parents to &quot;eavesdrop&quot; on your phone conversations, or <br/>
read your notes passed at school?  Of course not. Although I do <br/>
believe its a parents perogative to know whats going on in a teens <br/>
life, its up to the teen to confide in the parent.  As parents we <br/>
have to be aware of the risks that others pose towards our children. <br/>
We may trust our children,  but we can&#39;t trust everyone they come in <br/>
contact with.   <br/>
<br/>
The discussion boards on unschooling.com do offer a good forum for <br/>
teen homeschoolers in a &quot;message board&quot; format.  I like Yahoo groups <br/>
for email format groups.  Yahoo groups have many options that can be <br/>
utilized for a more complete &quot;Online Community&quot;  Members of a group <br/>
will be more active and involved if they recieve email and do not <br/>
have to go to a site to post and respond to messages.  I have owned <br/>
and moderated several yahoo groups and I am familar with all of the <br/>
managing/maintaining issues involved.   I can create and promote a <br/>
group for Home school teens on yahoo.  I will moderate posts and <br/>
membership to insure they group is not spammed to death or that <br/>
any &quot;inappropiate&quot; members join the group.  I will have to be sort of <br/>
an &quot;invisible monitor&quot; so the teens won&#39;t feel intruded upon.   Each <br/>
family has the decide how involved they want to be in monitoring <br/>
their teens involvement in a group community.  I can assure you that <br/>
I will not allow anything inappropiate on the group.  I understand <br/>
that I have not gained the trust of folks on this group (and rightly <br/>
so, no one here really knows me.. I would be cautious myself) I would <br/>
suggest that parents also join the group, but &quot;adults&quot; will not <br/>
allowed to post messages.  Just get your foot in the door so you can <br/>
look in on the group and be assured that its all going smoothly.  <br/>
Does this sound like an acceptable approach to creating an online <br/>
community for Home schooled teens?<br/>
<br/>
I am going to create the group and start promoting it today.   I will <br/>
set down guidelines and &quot;rules&quot; for membership on the group that will <br/>
be auto sent to every new member.   I will require each member to <br/>
reply to the guideline letter so I know they have read it.  Wish the <br/>
group sucess!<br/>

I don&#39;t particularly care for the rules you&#39;ve described.<br/>
I do understand the importance of them having a list of their own, but at the <br/>
same time, you sound like you&#39;re used to schooled teens, not unschoolers.<br/>
How long have you unschooled? Do you have teens of your own?<br/>
I ask because my son posts regularly at unschooling.com and has never, ever <br/>
had a problem sharing his posts with me or talking about what everyone is <br/>
saying.<br/>
He&#39;s used to me being an advocate and a listening ear, not an enemy.<br/>
I&#39;d hate to think that unschooled teens would have a problem with adults <br/>
dropping by the list. Or maybe I&#39;m just being naive here.<br/>

My children are the same way.  We are very open and communicate freely. <br/>
Nothing is tabu for discussion in my family.  I dont think that kids would <br/>
have a &quot;problem&quot; with adults dropping by the list, and I would encourage <br/>
parents to also join.. But, I do think that kids interact differently when <br/>
parents are not around ( in a highly visible way)  I did not intend to <br/>
indicate that teens feel as if their parents are thier enemies,  but rather, <br/>
parents are not their peers.<br/>

I just had a look there.  One problem that jumps out is that you have to<br/>
actually go into a thread to find out what *year* it&#39;s from.  There are some<br/>
current threads, but a lot of them are over a year old since anyone has<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891208738">Right now, I really dont know what direction the group will take.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want the group  to be an &quot;advocate&quot; of any particular type of homeschooling.  <br/>
 I just want home schooled teens to have a safe and active place online to <br/>
come to meet other home schoolers.  I see the group as more of a social <br/>
outlet,  somewhere to hang out and just act like a kid.  Homeschoolers are <br/>
more isolated from other teens in the general population, I dont want to <br/>
restrict thier interaction between other homeschoolers.  For me, I dont see <br/>
any reason to segregate my children from other teens that may follow a <br/>
different method or lifestyle in thier homeschooling.  I am not opposed to my <br/>
children being involved with teens that go to &quot;regular school&quot; outside the <br/>
home.  But, they can find those types of groups and forums in abudance <br/>
online. However, those forums are usually not monitored.   Other parents may <br/>
feel more inclined to restrict thier childrens association with others that <br/>
do not practice thier specific methods or hold differing opinions on key <br/>
issues.  That is certainly a parent&#39;s perogative, and it is a right of every <br/>
parent to exercise it. <br/>
<br/>
Another word about moderating or monitoring teens activities online.  The <br/>
majority of  risks does not come from being involved with other teens.  We <br/>
certainly hope that we have raised our children to chose the right friends <br/>
and make wise choices.  Risks come from predators online that try to gain <br/>
access to teen related sites.  Not to be alarming, but its not uncommom for <br/>
predators to become involved in teen forums posing as teens themselves.  If <br/>
close monitoring is not utilized, some sicko spammer will flood the group <br/>
with links to porn or other inappropiate material.  Any email list with the <br/>
word &quot;teen&quot; or even &quot;school&quot; is a target for this sort of exploitation.  That <br/>
is why I named the group HSTCon.. (home school teen connections)   I left the <br/>
key words out of the name, and only kept them in the description.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-407177766">You are so correct in that assumption. But getting approved for membership in <br/>
this  group requires more than clicking a button.  In this case, a guideline <br/>
letter goes out when someone requests membership.  There are specific <br/>
instructions in the  letter that ask the pending member to reply to the group <br/>
owner and provide some very general info.  If pending members don&#39;t reply, I <br/>
don&#39;t approve thier membership. Yeah, its a lot of time and effort, but to <br/>
maintain a good group, its critical.  This way, you only get members who are <br/>
really interested in joining and take the time to read the guidelines.<br/>

issues.  That is certainly a parent&#39;s perogative, and it is a right of every<br/>
parent to exercise it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that restricting teen&#39;s association with others for whatever reasons<br/>
is likely to backfire.  There&#39;s a big difference between giving kids<br/>
information that will help them make decisions about people and telling them<br/>
they can&#39;t associate with those people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Another word about moderating or monitoring teens activities online.  The<br/>
 </span></blockquote>majority of  risks does not come from being involved with other teens.  We<br/>
certainly hope that we have raised our children to chose the right friends<br/>
and make wise choices.  Risks come from predators online that try to gain<br/>
access to teen related sites.  Not to be alarming, but its not uncommom for<br/>
predators to become involved in teen forums posing as teens themselves.  If<br/>
close monitoring is not utilized, some sicko spammer will flood the group<br/>
with links to porn or other inappropiate material.  Any email list with the<br/>
word &quot;teen&quot; or even &quot;school&quot; is a target for this sort of exploitation.<br/>
That<br/>
is why I named the group HSTCon.. (home school teen connections)   I left<br/>
the<br/>
key words out of the name, and only kept them in the description. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once a kid has email, they are going to receive that crap.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
there&#39;s much you can do to prevent it.  Better to come at it from the angle<br/>
of, &quot;This is the kind of thing that could happen.  Can I give you some ideas<br/>
of ways to deal with it?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-313616675">Thanks Tia for offering some ideas against SPAM. I know a few ways how to  <br/>
deal with it in email but I am always open for new suggestions.  I can deter <br/>
SPAM in the group though, as I will be restricting membership and  moderating <br/>
new members. ( SPAM usually comes in the first , and only post from a <br/>
Spammer)<br/>
<br/>
I dont know who my kids will &quot;hang out&quot; with.  I am just starting to <br/>
homeschool my children and I do not expect them to break thier ties with <br/>
thier &quot;old&quot; friends.  Actually, my 5th grader had no friends at all, so I am <br/>
hoping he makes some new ones.  My 7th grade daughter plans on ( and I <br/>
strongly encourage her) to keep up her friendships from school.  I agree, <br/>
restrictions often backfire.  My  assumption that home schoolers are more <br/>
isolated may be WAY off target.   I suppose I am comparing staying home all <br/>
day, going on occassional field trips and &quot;play dates&quot; or meetings to being <br/>
surrounded by hundreds or even thousands of other students all day.     That <br/>
said, being &quot;more isolated&quot; is not a bad thing.. probably much more <br/>
beneficial than being lost in a crowd <br/>

&lt;&lt; Although I do <br/>
believe its a parents perogative to know whats going on in a teens <br/>
life, its up to the teen to confide in the parent.  As parents we <br/>
have to be aware of the risks that others pose towards our children. <br/>
We may trust our children,  but we can&#39;t trust everyone they come in <br/>
contact with.    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All the internet horror stories I&#39;ve ever heard involved a very unhappy <br/>
teenager desperate for attention and love.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would <br/>
suggest that parents also join the group, but &quot;adults&quot; will not <br/>
allowed to post messages.  Just get your foot in the door so you can <br/>
look in on the group and be assured that its all going smoothly.  <br/>
Does this sound like an acceptable approach to creating an online <br/>
community for Home schooled teens?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For homeschooled teens, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
For unschooled teens, for those in my experience, it&#39;s overkill.<br/>
<br/>
There might be kids who would be really interested, but it you monitor it too <br/>
much it won&#39;t be a list for kids.  It will be kids talking in front of their <br/>
moms, do don&#39;t expect too much.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Homeschoolers are <br/>
more isolated from other teens in the general population, I dont want to <br/>
restrict thier interaction between other homeschoolers.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would rather my kids associate with &quot;school kids&quot; than structured <br/>
homeschoolers, in general.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t isolated.  A kid at a school with 1200 others might only have <br/>
three or four friends.  My kids have five to a dozen friends each at any one <br/>
time, not counting the overlap friends who are family friends or friends of <br/>
two or three of my kids at once.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But, they can find those types of groups and forums in abudance <br/>
online. However, those forums are usually not monitored.   Other parents may <br/>
feel more inclined to restrict thier childrens association with others that <br/>
do not practice thier specific methods or hold differing opinions on key <br/>
issues.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have found people with whom to discuss their particular interests, <br/>
regardless of whether those others are homeschooled or not.  (They don&#39;t even <br/>
know, or ask, when it&#39;s online.  Sometimes they&#39;ve discovered after some <br/>
weeks or months of contact that one of the others is also homeschooled.)<br/>
<br/>
I think unschoolers could really use knowing other unschoolers, but if <br/>
they&#39;re on a list with other homeschoolers, or a bulletin board, in my <br/>
experience the discussion becomes the structured kids complaining about their <br/>
lives, and the unschoolers talking about things they don&#39;t know about, and <br/>
the structured kids spending the rest of the time drilling the unschoolers <br/>
about how they&#39;ll get into college or get a job. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Not to be alarming, but its not uncommom for <br/>
predators to become involved in teen forums posing as teens themselves.  If <br/>
close monitoring is not utilized, some sicko spammer will flood the group <br/>

<br/>
Unless you put parental controls on your kids&#39; accounts (which keeps them <br/>
from MOST of the internet; Holly couldn&#39;t even get onto her own private <br/>
page), they WILL get porn spam sometimes.  SO?  They&#39;ll delete it if you <br/>
don&#39;t make a big deal about it.  If they&#39;re already aware it&#39;s out there, <br/>
they won&#39;t be &quot;lured&quot; by it later on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t have that list.  Go for it!  But you asked for <br/>
approval and cooperation from people on this list, and I can&#39;t offer much of <br/>
either.  Sorry.  I&#39;m not trying to be mean, I&#39;m trying to point out that <br/>
controls to the extent you&#39;re setting are out of my realm of comfort and <br/>
experience.<br/>

I agree totally.  But some others have indicated that they think kids wouldnt <br/>
mind parents being involved.  If I dont allow parents to join, then they may <br/>
question my motives, and become suspicous of the group.. Like I said in my <br/>
first post, its really a catch 22.  I know my children dont interact with <br/>
thier peers when  &quot;adults&#39; are around the same way they do when its just <br/>
kids.   It doesnt mean kids are acting &quot;bad&quot; or inappropiately when we are <br/>
not around, they just act differently.   I know I act differently in an all <br/>
adult setting than I do when my kids are around.. Just like most folks act <br/>
differently when the boss is around.  It&#39;s not hypocritical or deceptive, its <br/>
just human nature. ( IMO)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
All the internet horror stories I&#39;ve ever heard involved a very unhappy <br/>
teenager desperate for attention and love.<br/>
<br/>
You are right on the money on that too.. I would tend to think that home <br/>
schooled children and teens have a secure and loving network of family and <br/>
they would be less suseptible to predators. <br/>

I see a contradiction here.. You say that your children are allowed to <br/>
interact with whomever they choose to online.  Whether they are homeschooled <br/>
or not is not an issue.. But, then you say that you think &quot;regular <br/>
homeschoolers&quot; and &quot;unschoolers&quot;  couldnt coexist in a discussion forum.   <br/>
Unfortunately, some parents have difficulty accepting the diversity of <br/>
others,  its just sad that prejudice transfers to the child as well.  <br/>

of being involved in a group, I will be more than glad to hand it over to <br/>
her.  I checked for teen groups on yahoo, most have less than 25 members.   <br/>
They are inactive and abandoned or they are for very specific locations which <br/>
leads me to beleive they were created by kids who did not know how to promote <br/>
and maintain them.   If this group DOES get up and running, having a teen <br/>
moderate it would be a wonderful idea.  I agree, much better than having an <br/>
