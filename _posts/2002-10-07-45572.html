After paying rent, we have right at $450 left for the month. That pays the utilities, and buys the groceries for our family of 5, and that&#39;s it.

<br/>
Please understand, I&#39;m not trying to duck out of spending money or of showing my support. I&#39;ve volunteered to help stuff the goody bags for the conference, and I&#39;ve been telling everyone I know about it, and have had at least 5 families sign up because I told them about it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384153276">Yes, I live about a half hour away from the conference site. Oh goodness, I know I&#39;d never be able to go and hold my head up if I didn&#39;t pay my own way!!! Things will get better, and I&#39;m just going to hope they&#39;ll do the same thing again next year like they&#39;re planning to. <br/>
Myranda <br/>
  Do you mean that you live in SC and you&#39;re not able to go to the conference<br/>
  because of financial strains? That seems so cruel! Maybe it&#39;s possible to<br/>
  have a fund or program set up so that certain people who need a little<br/>
  &quot;help&quot; getting in the door can do so. I know I would donate. I hope you can<br/>
  find a way to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me, too, Karin.  I&#39;m all for a scholarship of sorts to help folks go to the <br/>
conference.  Money is a pretty tricky thing for our family, too, these <br/>
days, but I&#39;m thinking if lots of people kicked in a little, it&#39;d allow <br/>
someone to go who could really benefit, etc., etc.  The conference itself <br/>
is, I think, very reasonably priced.  It&#39;s the hotel and the food and the <br/>
travel all that stuff that&#39;s so hard to afford.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d be delighted to chip in to help Myranda go, if that would feel <br/>
okay for Myranda.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S. to Myranda.  I know a lot about money troubles, and I also know a lot <br/>
about being the beneficiary of other peoples&#39; generosity. during hard <br/>
times.  I have had a very hard time accepting help from people, but I <br/>
realized that the only way to repay kindnesses like that is to turn around <br/>
and help other people when they need it and want it.  That is what <br/>
community is all about, and the Internet has created these strangely <br/>
dispersed communities of like-minded people.  So, if there were some way to <br/>
set up a fund to help you go to the conference, I hope you would be able to <br/>
see it as a sort of barn-raising kind of community thing.  (I don&#39;t know if <br/>
I&#39;m making any sense at all; more stream-of-consciousness, muttered <br/>
ramblings from a sleep-deprived mom!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786460074">Having a car repossessed is a BIG ONE!!!<br/>
<br/>
But the conference is to be a big one too!  I bet something can be worked out <br/>
if you&#39;re willing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Oh, gosh, seriously, I couldn&#39;t accept something like that!!! I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
feel right, and I know DH would have an absolute duck fit! That may be <br/>
hyprocritical of me, because I&#39;m usually the first to offer help, money or <br/>
material or physical, to anyone who needs it, but I don&#39;t know, I just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel right at all!!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to feel that way about other people helping me.  I got over it <br/>
somewhat (not completely) when they not only pointed out the ways in which I <br/>
had helped other people, but brought me some literature to point out to me <br/>
that I was following a big, long, known patterns of adult children of <br/>
alcoholics and it wasn&#39;t really to my advantage to continue.<br/>
<br/>
I know this might not apply at all, but just in the tiny case there&#39;s any <br/>
leftover effects of a childhood involving instability or overcoming <br/>
difficulties, it might be healing to accept help.<br/>
<br/>
It was helpful for me.<br/>

didn&#39;t pay my own way!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why?  Life&#39;s not about always paying our own way, it&#39;s about loving <br/>
each other and helping each other out.  If you really want to go, <br/>
I&#39;ll paypal you some money towards it.  Maybe some others will do the <br/>
same. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512554309">OK, I&#39;m sitting here crying cause all of you have been so nice and sweet and caring, offering to help pay my way into the conference, my husband is looking at me like I&#39;ve really gone off the deep end now! To all of you who offered, on and offlist, I give up! :::::waving white flag::::: LOL I can refuse one or two, but you all made some very good points, and the last thing I am is stupid. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Let me talk to my mom tonight and see if she has a car I can borrow or if she can take us and fetch us each day, and I&#39;ll let you guys know tomorrow. Babies are allowed, right? DH said he could stay home with the boys on Sat and Sun, but he&#39;s got to work Friday. I don&#39;t think they do the family thing at this late date, do they? Anyway, I&#39;m a babbling idiot now, I&#39;ll let you all know tomorrow if I&#39;ll have a way to and from. Thank you all so much, I&#39;m off to find some more tissues!

Like I said, I&#39;d be happy to pitch in and help pay your way into the<br/>
conference.<br/>
Hopefully Kelly or someone will figure out a way to do this best. I&#39;d rather<br/>
not do the paypal thing, but I&#39;d contribute when I register Friday evening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348247629">OK, guys, I spent all last night calling family, my mom&#39;s going to be out of town for a wedding, down on an island off Mobile, AL. My cousin is in the hospital, should be having a baby any time now. And everyone else has to work this weekend. So now I have no ride to get there and back each day. I&#39;ll keep trying! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893021750">I would like to also reply to this, ignore if someone said it, I&#39;ve had a hard accepting help from other people too. I think similar growing up circumstances as Sandra has said, but when I do accept help with an open heart, I grow and the other person grows too so much!  <br/>
Now if its that there are too many &#39;other&#39; reasons that the objective can&#39;t be attained, the objective going to the conference, then that&#39;s another story.  But if its only financial it sounds like there are alot of people who would love to assist it you in getting there.  I would also send some money!<br/>
See,,, in my case I could probably afford some way to get there but there are lots of other issues keeping me from going.  Like transportation costs and time constraints because of distance, have other committments, but in your case Miranda maybe those things aren&#39;t there because you are only 1/2 hr away!<br/>
The way I see it,  the more people that can learn more about our philosophies, the better.  And then those people can reach out to more people. And so on and so on!<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be pushy but just wanting you to think through it seriously!  It is very hard to accept help from others, but then I put the shoe on the other foot and think I want them to accept help from me so I have to accept help from them.  A two way street!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Oh, gosh, seriously, I couldn&#39;t accept something like that!!! I wouldn&#39;t <br/>

I used to feel that way about other people helping me.  I got over it <br/>
somewhat (not completely) when they not only pointed out the ways in which I <br/>
had helped other people, but brought me some literature to point out to me <br/>
that I was following a big, long, known patterns of adult children of <br/>
alcoholics and it wasn&#39;t really to my advantage to continue.<br/>
<br/>
I know this might not apply at all, but just in the tiny case there&#39;s any <br/>
leftover effects of a childhood involving instability or overcoming <br/>
difficulties, it might be healing to accept help.<br/>

It was helpful for me.<br/>

They&#39;re 5 of us, but DH said he would be willing to stay home with the boys if needed, so the only one who would have to go with me is my little 8mth nursling princess.
