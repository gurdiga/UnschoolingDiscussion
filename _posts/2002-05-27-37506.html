&lt;&lt; that has all the different body parts and systems with lots of pictures <br/>
and <br/>
 good anatomical drawings. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw a really awesome anatomy book at Barnes and Noble not too long ago. It <br/>
had wonderful color illustrations that were very detailed and accurate.<br/>
I thought at the time that it would be a great one to have for a family, <br/>
because it had all the correct anatomical drawings but the color made them <br/>
really pleasing to the eye.<br/>
It was in the bargain section, a HUGE book and around $20.<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t remember the name, but just check B & N&#39;s bargain shelves and I <br/>
bet you&#39;ll find it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have this really cool cd that I purchased for a little next to nothing at <br/>
Office Depot. You can keep medical records on file, it gives tests and all of <br/>
that good stuff. You can even take the pictures from the cd and take them to <br/>
word and make reports or you can print straight from the screen and have a <br/>
study sheet. The cd has a voice that tells you the names of the different <br/>
body parts as you click on them. You can see the body in three-D...it is <br/>
really cool. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when the kids were studying the hand, my oldest son made a board <br/>
game and we played that thing all of the time. They know every ligament and <br/>
bone in the hand. Pretty cool.<br/>

The very first time I assisted in the OR, I got a mild shock when all the<br/>
organs were exposed and they were NOT the same colors as in my book! In my<br/>
mind, for years, the liver was teal, the veins were blue and arteries were<br/>
red. THe Pancreas was white.<br/>
Nope. Everything is reddish brown and smooshed together. Go figure.<br/>
