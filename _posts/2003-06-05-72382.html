<div id="ygrps-yiv-212900766">Today we went on a &quot;dog trainer field trip&quot;  Another homeschool mother had <br/>
arranged the trip to a local dog trainer/competitor/breeder a few months ago and <br/>
the trip kept getting canceled and rescheduled.  Today, we finally got to go.<br/>
<br/>
  The fellow as very personable kid-friendly ( no surprise as he is also <br/>
dog-friendly.. lol)  He is a shuzhund trainer and he spent over 2 hours showing us <br/>
lots of interesting things.  He talked about dog care, diet, health, etc.  He <br/>
showed us some basic obedience training with a pup he is currently training.  <br/>
He took us over to a field that he had &quot;laid a track&quot; in and told us all <br/>
about tracking dogs and thier jobs, how they track, what they do, ect.  We got a <br/>
first hand experience of watching (and following) his award winning dog track a <br/>
3 hour old trail.   He showed us how he rewards the dog by playing with him <br/>
and how the dog obeys so meticulously in order to get to play with his toy.   <br/>
Then, we went back to his training site and he showed us another dog do some <br/>
protection/bite work.  Folks  asked a lot of questions and he was happy to <br/>
answer all of them.  He was very patient and thorough with his answers.  The dogs <br/>
were amazing and beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
  JP got bored about an hour into it as did most of the other kids under 10.  <br/>
 They turned to picking weeds and throwing grass on each other and just <br/>
goofing off and playing around.  They dog trainer guy didn&#39;t seem to mind too much, <br/>
he still had the adults and a few older kids attention.  Basically, the <br/>
younger kids just liked watching the dogs and petting them, they were not very <br/>
interested in all the &quot;technical stuff&quot;.   Anna and I learned a lot and really <br/>
enjoyed the whole trip. <br/>
<br/>
 I found out that &quot;commercial&quot; or grocery store dog food is basically junk.  <br/>
It&#39;s just enough to keep a dog alive with very little nutritional value.  The <br/>
guy recommended some good brands of dog food ( he uses one called Precise) .  <br/>
After the doggy session, I headed straight to Petsmart to get some &quot;good&quot; dog <br/>
food.  I had always bought Purina and though I was doing my dog a favor.. LOL. <br/>
 No such luck, its basically fillers, additives and other no good stuff.   <br/>
The knowledgeable ( kinda surprising, lol) salesclerk at Petsmart confirmed what <br/>
the trainer had told us about the lack of quality in grocery store dog foods, <br/>
and she recommended some better brands.  I chucked out $40 for dog food ( <br/>
puppy and adult),  and a few tennis balls for the puppies to play with   The <br/>
salesclerk also confirmed that Pert Plus shampoo can be used on small puppies to <br/>
kill fleas.  I had read that on the Internet and I asked her about the validity <br/>
of it.   So, we went off to Wal-mart to throw down another $30 for shampoo, <br/>
flea comb, and two bales of cedar bedding.  <br/>
<br/>
  Back home we came to feed the puppies their new fancified dog food, spread <br/>
the cedar shavings in the kennel, and give them thier first bath.  Yesterday <br/>
we wormed them and thier little tummies were not so bloated out today.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I came in to do some dog food research and found out some NASTY stuff <br/>
goes into a lot of dog food. UGHGHGHGH..  I found lots of articles that said <br/>
basically the same thing.. Here is a good one  <br/>

<br/>
Anyway, that was our &quot;dog day&quot;     Lots of fun and learning too!  ( well, for <br/>
me at least)<br/>

Teresa, Sounds like a wonderful day. That would have been a great trip for<br/>
Sierra and I too.<br/>
<br/>
On a second note, Ivory liquid dishwashing liquid will also kill fleas and<br/>
is very gentle to use on the dogs. Just keep away from eyes. Suds them up<br/>
and let it sit for just a few minutes. Probably cheaper to use than Pert.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for that tip.  Here is another one I learned to help with suds in <br/>
eyes.  Rub some mineral oil on the puppy&#39;s face, around his eyes   That will <br/>
resist the suds.   I bought the generic brand of Pert plus.. lol.  Still, I got a <br/>
LOT of shampoo left, more than I will use on the puppies ( fingers crossed, I <br/>
hope we find home for them before they need that many baths)   <br/>
<br/>
You know, I bet lots of  trainer and breeders would be open to doing a &quot;field <br/>
trip&quot; type thing.    Maybe call around and ask if you could come visit.  It <br/>
was great to see all that cool dog stuff in person and not on TV<br/>

Yeah I actually knew that already. I use to be a groomer and we did that on<br/>
every dog that came in for a bath. It was also handy when a flat faced dog<br/>
got a proptose eye. Like a pug or shih tzu, their eye will literally pop out<br/>
of the socket!!!<br/>

the time I find something, summer will be over!!! Outside field trips now<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406687158">What I have been using on our dogs for shampoo is Murphy&#39;s oil soap, <br/>
actually the dollar store knockoff. It is vegetable based, and <br/>
soothes flea bitten skin and moisturizing. It doesn&#39;t smell too bad, <br/>
either. I read about it somewhere and have been happy with it ever <br/>
since. I, too, have been feeding my dogs Purina, contemplating <br/>
finding a better quality dogfood but not too expensive. I have even <br/>
considered giving them a &quot;real food diet&quot; that I read about. google <br/>
BARF- Bones and Real Food Diet. Does anyone know of a quality dogfood <br/>
available at a feedstore that is not as expensive as the pet store <br/>
kind? <br/>

Wow, I&#39;m glad I never had to do that!!! Of course I learned it when I went<br/>
to vet assistant school but luckily never used that knowledge! The groomers<br/>
that I know of down here don&#39;t do anal glands, the vets do. When I was<br/>
grooming, I actully like the ear powder and pulling out the ear hair from<br/>
the poodles. Just thought it was so neat. Use to just come right out!<br/>

groomers do.  Either, way, as long as I don&#39;t have to do it.. :-)<br/>
<br/>
About the premium dog foods..  They do cost more.. But you  feed less of them <br/>
than commerical brands, so in the long run, the cost comes out about the <br/>
same.  Also, dogs who are on premium food have less bowel movements and its not as <br/>
stinky.   I bought the store brand at Petsmart that is comprable to Eukenuba. <br/>
   Look for meat meal ( chicken, lamb, whatever) as the first ingredient in <br/>
the food.  Preserved with vitamin E, and no meat by products.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have Brittany&#39;s and feed Purina also. We where feeding High end brands <br/>
until I talked to several breeders and found that as long as it is meat based we <br/>
where fine. Meat-based means that the foods number one ingredient is meat such <br/>
as lamb, beef, or chicken.<br/>
Meat is not the same as bone meal, chicken byproducts, etc.Yuck<br/>
Causes loose stools and not as good for the dog. <br/>
<br/>
I too have considered making the meals for them as it does get expensive. <br/>
<br/>
By the way the difference in price from Dog Chow 50 lb bag for $15.00 to Pro <br/>
Plan 40 lb bag 30.00 = 15.00 more a bag and less 10 pounds. <br/>

I guess what one thinks is good is a matter of opinion. I&#39;ve never used<br/>
Purina. I have had luck with Nutro Max and now use Iams. I really like Iams<br/>
and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too expensive. Probably less than Nutro and my local<br/>
grocery store also carries the Iams so I don&#39;t have to make a special trip.<br/>

out. It was a little Shih Tzu. I dropped some more mineral oil on it&#39;s eye,<br/>
covered it with my hand and pushed it back in. The dog was fine and my<br/>

the dog moved.<br/>

Since I know nothing about cows and schooling didn&#39;t really get heavy into<br/>
farm animals, I&#39;m not sure. I would imagine that anyone or thing that has an<br/>
eye can get a proptosed one. I remember school saying it was more prevalent<br/>
in flat faced breeds which leads me to believe not exclusive to them. I do<br/>
know though that if not taken care of right away, the eye can be damaged and<br/>
most likely will have to come out. You mean cows are sold with the eye out?<br/>
That&#39;s not at all comfortable to the animal to leave it like that. Poor<br/>
things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe what usually happens in these cases was that somehow, with moving <br/>
the animals to the auction, all the ruckous that sometimes happens, bumping <br/>
around, etc, plus some beasts with horns, an eye can get knocked out.  That&#39;s <br/>
what happened with the one that went so cheap. <br/>
<br/>
A friend of ours bought a ewe for 1.00 once, who had a prolapsed <br/>
uterus...that bothered me...they should have just put her out of her misery or taken her <br/>
to the vet.  She ended up going straight to the butcher for mutton.  <br/>
<br/>
The stockyards is NOT a pretty place...haven&#39;t been in a long time because I <br/>
hate the way the animals are treated, and hate to see how pitiful some of them <br/>
are.  <br/>

that if you can&#39;t get the expensive top quality kind, that anything in the <br/>
Purina line, is almost as good. But to totally avoid the very cheap kind, because <br/>
it is mostly fillers, in order for them to sell it so cheap. (Doesn&#39;t have much <br/>
it in that&#39;s good for them, AND because it&#39;s mostly fillers, they eat a lot <br/>
more, and therefore sh*# a lot more, and so it doesn&#39;t end up really ever <br/>
saving you money anyway.)     Lara..............</div>

<br/>
Ouch!<br/>
<br/>
Should show people and competitor people get higher quality food than people <br/>
who are just our friends and family members? *<br/>
<br/>
(I understand the statement, but it certainly puts MY dog in a lower class <br/>
situation. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
We give a combo of cheapish dogfood and people-scrap, and if there&#39;s not <br/>
natural scrap for a day or two I&#39;ll make her something.  Scrambled eggs, at least. <br/>
 She loves cheese, so I always grate some extra for her.  When I trim meat I <br/>
give her the scrap.<br/>
<br/>
* [That did happen in the dining hall at our university, where the football <br/>
players had their own separate room with drapes, and reportedly had steak <br/>
anytime they wanted.]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, well, I think that atheletes or folks who need more energy, stamina, etc <br/>
probably DO eat differently than your average folks.  They may take vitamin <br/>
supplements also.   I guess the difference between dogs and humans is that <br/>
humans have the choice to either eat &quot;really healthy&quot; like an athelete or not.  ( <br/>
well, barring circumstantial factors like poverty and availablity of foods)  <br/>
But dogs have to eat whatever we give them or go find thier own food.    <br/>

We&#39;ve used it for years, when they bred her, that&#39;s what we fed the puppies and <br/>
our adult dogs eat Pedigree small bites.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has a pit bull and he feeds her Pro Plan, something about you don&#39;t <br/>
feed them as much protein as a lab, or maybe the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
But our dogs are really shiny coats and seem very active and healthy.  Molly <br/>
is nine years old and Pedigree is all she&#39;s eaten.  The dogs next door are fed <br/>
Purina.  When we moved here they had four dogs, they are down to one now.  <br/>
They&#39;ve all had tumors and cancers and have died fairly young.  I&#39;m not <br/>
attributing this to their food, but that&#39;s just my observations, I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
many other reasons that contribute to their early deaths, they were different <br/>
breeds than mine (except one) so that might have something to do with it.<br/>

humans do.<br/>
I don&#39;t always do raw but do from tome to time and they also get <br/>
scraps and stuff along with dog food. {We live in the boonies and <br/>
tend to get strays} <br/>
