<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415897195"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It&#39;s a very confusing scenario to be in when your kids really, really want<br/>
&gt; something that you don&#39;t agree with.<br/>
&gt; Their want doesn&#39;t go away in time if you try and ignore the problem, or<br/>
&gt; just &#39;put your foot down&#39; as the parent.<br/>
&gt; In fact, putting your foot down just makes them want it more. Then it<br/>
&gt; becomes a power struggle between you and your kid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I may have told the story here about my older son and his friend, who wasn&#39;t<br/>
allowed toy guns.  It was all he *ever* wanted to do when he came to our<br/>
house.  Both boys have grown up to be quite non-violent.<br/>
