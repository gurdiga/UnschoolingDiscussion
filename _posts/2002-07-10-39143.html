<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274767116">Are there any homeschoolers  on this list in SW/Fondren area. I was <br/>
homeschooling my nine-year-old son in the Spring, and would like to keep it <br/>
that way. However, I have to finish my degree. I need to find a solution <br/>
for my child during the day.  Help!<br/>
