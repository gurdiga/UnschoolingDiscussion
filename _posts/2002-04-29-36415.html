&lt;&lt; By any chance is Kirby they little pink puffball from<br/>
the nintendo 64?  Darn that little pink puffball LOL<br/>
(if it is who I think it is LOL) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
My son was named after my dad, Kirby Adams.  <br/>
THEN he became a Nintendo freak.<br/>
THEN Nintendo came out with a character named Kirby. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s the archer.  Kirby is the karate guy.  Both of them would probably <br/>
enjoy being able to inhale things and spoot them out on bad guys (which the <br/>
little pink character does &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I want to get my son an archery set.  He is seven. My<br/>
husband said he was to young wait until he is eight.<br/>
How old is your son?  It sounds like he focuses his<br/>
energy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thirteen.  <br/>
<br/>
For general physical release when I was a kid and frustrated, I always like <br/>
riding my bike, coasting down hills, riding up to roads with more trees, or <br/>
on dirt roads down toward the river.  It satisfied the physical movement need <br/>
AND it got me away from the house.  <br/>
