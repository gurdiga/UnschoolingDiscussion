<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814105027">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i have a question about email.  some messages come through as one long<br/>
line, some come through as several longish lines while most come through<br/>
in a normal paragraphs format.  why is this? and  is there something i<br/>
can do to make the formatting come through more consistent?<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

I think it has to do with the senders email. I am not sure if you can do<br/>
anything about it though..<br/>
