<div id="ygrps-yiv-28282335">There is an elementary version of this too, if anybody is interested.<br/>
<br/>
Also - this just says that these subjects are offered, not that a kid <br/>
&quot;takes&quot; every one of them...just like in high school not all kids take <br/>
all subjects offered.<br/>
<br/>
I offer this to you as something to do to handle legalities without <br/>
having to pretend you&#39;re doing school-like coursework. It puts learning <br/>
into language school officials can comprehend - with their limited <br/>
specialized vocabularies, y&#39;know how they are! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Course of Study<br/>
Secondary Students<br/>
We believe that the family is the most fundamental social institution <br/>
and the preferred means of caring for, preparing, and training children <br/>
to be productive members of society. We promote and support a <br/>
family-centered education.<br/>
<br/>
Our education program, in which children learn primarily under the <br/>
immediate direction, guidance, and support of their parents and other <br/>
caring and involved adults, offers an outstanding educational <br/>
opportunity by providing a natural learning environment, extensive <br/>
real-world experience, flexibility of schedule, and the ability to <br/>
respond to the specific needs and inclinations of the child. Each <br/>
student’s program is developmentally appropriate, integrated and fully <br/>
individualized, and continually built upon student strengths and <br/>
interests throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
English: Students will develop knowledge of, and appreciation for <br/>
literature and the language, as well as the skills of speaking, <br/>
reading, listening, spelling, handwriting, and composition.<br/>
<br/>
Students will read from self-chosen or parent-chosen literature on a <br/>
regular basis and will engage in reflection on those literature pieces <br/>
in a variety of ways, such as: journal writing, book reviews, <br/>
conversations, drama based on the books, book clubs. Our educational <br/>
goal is for students to read for pleasure, to gain exposure to a wide <br/>
variety of genres, and to be able to reflect critically on what they <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
Students will read content-related non-fiction materials to support <br/>
their chosen areas of interest. They will reflect on these pieces in a <br/>
variety of ways, such as: journal writing, writing articles for <br/>
submission to magazines or newspapers, discussions, or development of a <br/>
scrapbook in an area of interest. Our goal is for students to learn to <br/>
read critically for information, to understand and be able to reflect <br/>
on materials read, to be able to compare them to other sources of <br/>
information, and to learn how and where to find written resources as <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
Writing, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of students’ <br/>
natural writing processes. Students will develop their ability to write <br/>
creatively, to write letters and lists, to create and write drama <br/>
pieces, informational essays, persuasive articles, etc. Our goal is for <br/>
students to enjoy writing, to gain expertise in both the writing <br/>
process and in technical writing and editing skills, and to develop a <br/>
sense of power over the written word.<br/>
<br/>
Science: Students will develop their scientific knowledge with emphasis <br/>
on basic concepts, theories, and processes of scientific investigation <br/>
and on the place of humans in ecological systems, and with appropriate <br/>
applications of the interrelation and interdependence of the sciences. <br/>
These will be related to areas of special student interest by engaging <br/>
in hands-on activities, watching science videos, reading related <br/>
written materials, conducting scientific experiments, keeping journals, <br/>
making and recording observations, visiting scientists in their work <br/>
places, visiting local science museums, participating in science fairs <br/>
and workshops, or through cooperative learning. Our goal is for <br/>
students to experience a wide range of scientific exposure in their <br/>
areas of interest, to develop a positive interest in science, to learn <br/>
to think scientifically, to develop a respect for the work scientists <br/>
do, and to understand the importance science has in daily life.<br/>
<br/>
Social Studies: Students will develop their understanding of the social <br/>
sciences and humanities by reading and discussing fiction and <br/>
non-fiction materials, participating in field trips to historic and <br/>
politically or culturally significant sites, or through discussion and <br/>
debate. Anthropology, economics, psychology, geography, history, <br/>
political science, and sociology are fully integrated into the students <br/>
studies in a wide variety of ways, such as: the use of time lines and <br/>
maps, discussion, journal writing, cooking, plays, road trips, <br/>
invention building, field trips, and art. Our goal is for students to <br/>
develop a foundation for understanding the history, resources, <br/>
development, and government of California and the United States of <br/>
America; the American legal system; the operation of the juvenile and <br/>
adult criminal justice systems and the rights and duties of citizens <br/>
under the criminal and civil law and the State and Federal <br/>
constitutions; the development of the American economic system <br/>
including the role of the entrepreneur and labor; the relations of <br/>
persons to their human and natural environment; eastern and western <br/>
cultures and civilizations; human rights issues, with particular <br/>
attention to the study of the inhumanity of genocide, slavery, and the <br/>
Holocaust; and contemporary issues including the wise use of natural <br/>
resources.<br/>
<br/>
Health and Physical Education: Health and physical education will be <br/>
fully integrated as a part of daily living skills and participation in <br/>
the wider community. Students will learn to care for their health and <br/>
physical environment in a variety of ways, such as: shopping for and <br/>
preparing food, discussing the necessity of a healthy diet, <br/>
participation in fire drills and other emergency preparedness <br/>
activities, exercise both as play and as part of a structured group <br/>
experience and through camping, hiking, and other outdoor activity. Our <br/>
goal is for students to appreciate the necessity of a healthy body and <br/>
to develop lifelong habits of regular exercise and good nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
Applied Arts and Vocation/Technical Education: Consumer and homemaker <br/>
education, industrial arts, general business education, and general <br/>
agriculture will be offered in a variety of ways. Students’ interests <br/>
will determine the direction of their applied arts and vocation <br/>
projects, which may include apprenticeships, mentorships, or specific <br/>
training. Our goal is for students to develop skills and knowledge to <br/>
meet their own future vocational and avocational requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Visual and Performing Arts: Students will develop their knowledge of <br/>
art, music, and drama through informal and structured methods in a <br/>
variety of ways, such as: art classes, instrumental lessons, choral <br/>
singing, listening to various styles of music, learning about the <br/>
people who have influenced music through history, or working on <br/>
individualized or group projects that relate to music, art, and drama, <br/>
including acting and performing in a variety of venues and genres.  Our <br/>
goal is for students to enjoy a wide variety of art, music, and drama <br/>
experiences, including performance, while developing an understanding <br/>
and appreciation of the importance of art, music, and drama as creative <br/>
expressions of human life experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics: Students will develop mathematical concepts, operational <br/>
skills, and problem solving through participation in daily real-world <br/>
activities such as cooking, building, shopping, budgeting, computing, <br/>
etc. Mathematics materials will be chosen to support students’ <br/>
individual learning styles in order to achieve competency in <br/>
operational skills and insight into problem-solving procedures.  Our <br/>
goal is for students to gain a strong conceptual knowledge of <br/>
mathematics as well as an appreciation for the daily applications of <br/>
mathematics in their lives.<br/>
<br/>

to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to become safe drivers.<br/>
