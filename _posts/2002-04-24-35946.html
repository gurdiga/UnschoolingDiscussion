<div id="ygrps-yiv-692172695">Thank you to all of those that responded to my questions and even read<br/>
my posts! <br/>
I know they were long.<br/>
I have learned one thing from this list, diversity is good! I will leave<br/>
here knowing that unschooling is most certainly different from family to<br/>
family, and that there should be freedom of expression. <br/>
I can see too that there are a few ladies here that feel it&#39;s their<br/>
calling to define unschooling in only their terms and to reject loudly<br/>
the valid opinions of another&#39;s method of unschooling. This is sad,<br/>
since unschooling is so diverse and in my personal research I have found<br/>
that it has MANY different meanings to many different people.<br/>
I hope that this list evolves in such a way that tolerance is the<br/>
foundation and that dogma, when it comes to an individual family choice<br/>
in education, is discarded.<br/>
THERE IS NO ONE WAY TO UNSCHOOL! :O) OR TO EDUCATE FOR THAT MATTER:O)<br/>
Unfortunately this list is WAY too busy for me and I dont think that I<br/>
can even go to the site and read all of it.<br/>
I&#39;m amazed at those women who can hang out with their kids, take care of<br/>
their husbands and homes and still be so active here! WOW! That&#39;s<br/>
something I haven&#39;t mastered as of yet. <br/>
The messages just keep pouring in even as I write this!<br/>
So I&#39;m moving on to a slower list.<br/>
Take care!<br/>
