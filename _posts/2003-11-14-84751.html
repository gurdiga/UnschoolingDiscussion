<div id="ygrps-yiv-178013209">Well this brings me back...<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up and &#39;wishing&#39;, it was &#39;good luck/wishing/hopeful&#39; to <br/>
cross one set of fingers and &#39;jinxing&#39; to cross two, and even better luck <br/>
to cross three sets of fingers/toes/limbs.<br/>
If you crossed three sets of whatevers (usually fingers and arms or toes) <br/>
we always thought the outcome would be guaranteed to go our way!<br/>
<br/>
This also meant that if you said something but Wished something opposite, <br/>
you&#39;d cross one set of fingers because you wanted your wish to come true, <br/>
not whatever it was that you said.<br/>
...maybe it was a Michigan thing.<br/>
