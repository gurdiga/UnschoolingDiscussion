of course the kids are in bed, but who&#39;s telling?  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576475936">I can&#39;t remember if I shared this site or not.  My kids love most things<br/>
to do with the space shuttle and the space station (this morning they<br/>
watched the shuttle dock at the station while eating breakfast) so, this<br/>
site is not only exciting, and a great learning experience but it is<br/>
also lots of fun.<br/>

Kewl!  about them watching it while eating breakfast... I think my <br/>
kids might be a little jaded by the telly, I was thrilled to happen on <br/>
a news channel showing the launch live, and gathered &#39;em round, <br/>
they watched, but didn&#39;t seem as thrilled as I was that I was <br/>
watching it live :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354083605">My kids don&#39;t watch much television at all.  The only other things they watch would be Andy Griffith (Daddy&#39;s addicted), National<br/>
Geographic, and then some documentaries...they love that kind of stuff...of course since they don&#39;t see the other, this is fine with them.<br/>
This morning when I got up, (I&#39;m battling a lovely cold) the kids and Dad were gathered &#39;round watching the space walk live....they LOVE<br/>
that...then Nasa lost the live picture feed.  Oh well, now they are out playing catch and playing with the new puppy.<br/>
Love is so wonderful......  :)<br/>
