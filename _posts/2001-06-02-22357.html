We have purchased a 1980 GMC transit bus to convert into a motorhome. <br/>
Our family plans to travel and learn about our great country <br/>
together.  But the deadline to pay off and pick up our bus is coming <br/>
up fast.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for a good vehicle, check out the address above.  <br/>
Thank you.<br/>
