as well, but I&#39;m glad to help other people use it through increased gas<br/>

What kind of wood stove do you have and what do you like/not like about <br/>
it?  We&#39;re going to have to choose one in the next few weeks and the whole <br/>
catalytic/not catalytic, outside air intake/inside air intake, etc <br/>
questions are kind of giving me pause.  We&#39;ll only need the very smallest <br/>
size to heat a 21&#39; round room, mostly on weekends at the moment, full-time <br/>
in a few years.  I&#39;ve heard that catalytic stoves are a pain in the rear <br/>
and lose a lot of therms in the process, and the ceramics are expensive and <br/>
highly breakable.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
For living lightly, we&#39;re working on converting my big ol&#39; truck Betsy to <br/>
Biodiesel (made ourselves from FREE used cooking oil from restaurants, and <br/>
will cost us about 50 cents/gallon! (not including start-up <br/>
equipment.)  That beats $2.30/gallon anyday!)  We&#39;re busy trying to find <br/>
all the things we&#39;ll need (and switch out the rubber fuel hoses for <br/>
synthetic!) so we&#39;re not up and running yet, but hopefully in the next few <br/>
weeks.  When we get her going, she&#39;ll become my main transport.  I&#39;ll smell <br/>
like French Fries as I putter down the highway!  ...or maybe sushi...<br/>
<br/>
And does anybody know how polluting propane is (to manufacture and end <br/>
use)?  We&#39;ve got to figure out what we want the back-up-generator to run <br/>
on, as well as other upland and house machinery.<br/>

the house very well.  What we need is a fan.  The heat goes up the stairs<br/>

gets into the living room and on to the bedroom beyond it.  The plus to that<br/>
is that we have the clothes-drying rack hung from that ceiling.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s easy to get a fire going.  I&#39;ve recently discovered a good trick.  I<br/>
used to crumple newspaper and put the kindling on that.  Then I&#39;d add bigger<br/>
wood once the kindling was going.  Trouble with that is I&#39;d either forget<br/>
about it or manage to choke off the fire with the big wood.  Now I put in<br/>
two chunks (all that will fit side by side) with the newspaper in the middle<br/>
and the kindling kind of on top of it all but mostly on the paper.  Works<br/>
like a charm.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping it going all night isn&#39;t too hard.  I just fill it up and shut the<br/>
draft almost all the way.  Depending on the wood, it usually lasts until<br/>
morning.  The glitch is when the fire is at a certain stage when I want to<br/>
go to bed.  If it&#39;s really hot and glowing, adding wood or disturbing it<br/>
tends to send sparks and even chunks of coals flying out.  I just leave it<br/>
when it&#39;s like that and hope I remember to feed it later when I get up for a<br/>
pee.<br/>
