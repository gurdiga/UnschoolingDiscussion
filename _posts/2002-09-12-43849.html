&gt; but do they learn the stuff they will be tested on when it&#39;s time for <br/>
&gt; the tests?  They are supposed to take assessment tests in 3rd grade, <br/>
&gt; which means next year for Mariah, and I have to teach at least 4 1/2 <br/>
&gt; hours of Math, Reading, Language Arts, Science and Social Studies per <br/>
&gt; day, and state guidelines have set things they are supposed to learn <br/>
&gt; for that year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Like in science, one of the things they are to know by time the <br/>
&gt; finish second grade is<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Topic: Space: Astronomy <br/>
&gt; Standard: Observes and discusses apparent motion of sun and moon. <br/>
&gt; Understands that the sun, moon and stars appear in the east and set <br/>
&gt; in the west. Plots the apparent movement of the sun and moon in the <br/>
&gt; sky using shadows or other devices. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And one for reading is<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Topic: Reading <br/>
&gt; Standard: Recognizes and reads compound words, contractions, <br/>
&gt; possessives, and words containing the suffixes &quot;ing,&quot; &quot;ed,&quot; &quot;s,&quot; <br/>
&gt; and &quot;es.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So how do I unschool, yet still follow the guidelines set by the <br/>
&gt; state?  I don&#39;t want Mariah to take an assessment test next year and <br/>
&gt; them force me to put her back in public schools just because she <br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t learned what they say she needs too.<br/>

You really need to LEARN the GA law. It&#39;s not that restrictive!<br/>
