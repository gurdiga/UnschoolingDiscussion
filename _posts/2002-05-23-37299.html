&lt;&lt; On to my question... Does anyone limit or restrict books their <br/>
 children read? I ask this because my Mom always kept a fairly good <br/>
 eye on what I read as a child.(until I was about 14 or so.)For<br/>
 example, when I was about 11 I wanted to read `The Thornbirds&#39; and <br/>
 when I was about 12 the book in question was Steven King&#39;s `It&#39;, and <br/>
 she wouldn&#39;t let me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the question...NO, I do not censor anything they choose to read.  If I <br/>
noticed them picking up something that was far beyond their emotional skills, <br/>
I would definitely dialogue with them and point out what I thought might <br/>
upset them.  But only if I thought it would be upsetting or difficult for <br/>
them to deal with. <br/>
I read &quot;It&quot; and many other horror stories as a youth. I thoroughly enjoyed <br/>
them and continued to read some into my 20&#39;s. Now I find them a bit too <br/>
disturbing most of the time and choose drama/thriller type stuff for my <br/>
outlet, but not horror.<br/>
My mother never censored any of our reading. She was very adamant that it was <br/>
important for kids to read whatever they want to. She saw books with high <br/>
sexual content in my room sometimes even, and never said anything.<br/>
She bought us loads of comic books, and even read them with us.<br/>
Where did this lead? Well, every one of her children (even the one in prison) <br/>
are avid readers. All of us write for pleasure, my brother is a damn good <br/>
poet/rap artist even with all his problems.<br/>
I don&#39;t think school gave us this intense love for books, reading and <br/>
writing. I have to attribute it to my Mom on this one.<br/>
My personal feelings are to not to stop a child from reading anything they <br/>
are interested in, but to keep up the trust between parent and child to where <br/>
they feel perfectly comfortable talking with you about issues that may arise <br/>
in literature that they need deeper understanding about.<br/>
I read books that scared me and made me uncomfortable, but it didn&#39;t damage <br/>
me as far as I know.  :)<br/>
