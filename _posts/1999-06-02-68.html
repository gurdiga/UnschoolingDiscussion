<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226018130">Hello All!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kim and I reside here in Ohio with my husband Ralph and two boys, <br/>
Justin (11) and Joel (9).  We have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for a bit over a year <br/>
now.  My understandable frustration with the public school system led me to <br/>
take the boys out of an institution and bring them home to be raised by their <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
I have had a year of great frustration and stress.  Mainly because I keep <br/>
falling into the &quot;school at home trap&quot;.  My natural instincts do lead me to <br/>
unschooling (always have I guess), but my lack of self-confidence and <br/>
brainwash from the system through me back into scope and sequence type <br/>
studies.  No, I have not yet relaxed.  when I do, I find that all of us are <br/>
much happier.  Then I freak out and start looking to structure our day <br/>
more!!!!  I need some balance here and to make a solid commitment to <br/>
believing my children are intelligent enough to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
On to my questions... Since I have just started a year ago, and Justin is 11, <br/>
is it wise to unschool him at this point?  Soon school transcripts and <br/>
records for college will come into play, how do I manage this if I am truly <br/>
unschooling?  I have noticed that my boys backslide, lose the knowledge they <br/>
previously displayed, when we slack off and become more informal.  This <br/>
concerns me greatly, can anyone help me with this????   When the children are <br/>
doing close to nothing (usually not a problem with Justin), for quite some <br/>
time, how do you manage that at my boys&#39; ages?  All those books on the shelf <br/>
that they never touch, how do you get them interested, or do I just keep <br/>
dusting?! <br/>
<br/>
I apologize for sounding so ignorant... it is quite embarassing in fact.  But <br/>
I truly need the help and advice of &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers who have had <br/>
several years under their belts watching their children grow and trusting <br/>
their children.  I want to somewhat settle into a way of living where I am <br/>
not constantly second guessing myself, irritating my children, feeling <br/>
totally inadequate, and spending way too much money on things that don&#39;t <br/>
belong in my home!   HELP!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to networking with you all and hearing your advice on my <br/>
matters of concern.<br/>

know your children will figure it out, and remember to deschool!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
School transcripts are not as difficult as they sound.  Keep a journal, take pictures of vacations, park days, hikes, gardens in the yard and projects the kids make.  Consider a trip to Cedar Point a physics outing &lt;g&gt;.  Put these in a 3 ring binder, and when the time comes that you need to &quot;make&quot; it look formal, you will have it all together and can add &quot;educanese&quot; headers.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, I believe it was the Nov/Dec issue of HEM, there was a great article on compliling records, I would recommend you check that article out.  I could try to describe it, but would do it no justice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When the children are <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
They may or may not be doing nothing, don&#39;t stress on that.  Give them time and space, and they will come through.  Keep the books and materials handy (yes, dust them if you wish &lt;g&gt;), they may suprise you one day with their interests.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, find something that interests YOU, follow your bliss, the boys will then learn by modeling that it is OK to do what you like.  The learning happens, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I apologize for sounding so ignorant... it is quite embarrassing in fact.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818547226">Kim,<br/>
        I live in Ohio, too. Bless your heart. Isn&#39;t it terrible what p.s. <br/>
does to our minds?! I read that for every year in ps, that&#39;s how many years <br/>
it takes to de-school.<br/>
I really think that school is evil. They tell you what to do, when to do it, <br/>
how to do it,<br/>
and God-forbid if you don&#39;t do it &quot;right&quot;. It&#39;s no wonder that when we pull <br/>
our children out and &quot;unschool&quot; them, they don&#39;t know what to do with <br/>
themselves! <br/>
Think about everything a child learns in the first few years of their life. <br/>
Walking, talking, feeding themselves, learning how to dress themselves, <br/>
learning how to use the bathroom. I mean, when you think about it, it&#39;s <br/>
really quite unbelievable! And all this is done without teachers and schools. <br/>
Children are self-taught. And then when they&#39;re 5, we put them in school so <br/>
they can LEARN? Sheesh!!<br/>
Sorry. I get carried away. I have a 16 y.o. and a 14 y.o. and they probably <br/>
won&#39;t be done de-schooling till they leave home. I&#39;ve only been <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling a little over a year. My 8 y.o. won&#39;t write. <br/>
Getting her to write a thank-you note is a big ordeal. I don&#39;t push it <br/>
anymore. 2 nights ago, as I was dozing on the couch, she decides to write her <br/>
Dad a note, asking him for money, so she could get ice-cream the next day. <br/>
The only word she asked for help was &quot;please&quot;. She made the &quot;2&quot; backwards, <br/>
but I figured, in time, she&#39;ll figure it out. Anyway, the point is, she felt <br/>
a need to write, and she did! (BTW, I dated it and put it in her file so we <br/>
can show it to the certified teacher next year. LOL.) Mostly, she just plays. <br/>
As for college, I personally, have never read this book, but it&#39;s supposed to <br/>
be really good. It&#39; called, &quot;What about College?&quot; by Cafi Cohen. If the <br/>
library doesn&#39;t have it, ask them to order it. Also, &quot;The Homeschooling Book <br/>
of Answers&quot; by Linda Dobson.<br/>
It is a spectacular book. Also, &quot;The Unschooling Handbook: How to Use the <br/>
Whole World as your Child&#39;s Classroom&quot; by Mary Griffith.(equally <br/>
spectacular!) Read something positive about unschooling everyday. It will <br/>
help. <br/>
I know it&#39;s hard. I see children the same age as my 8 y.o. who are learning <br/>
cursive and their  multiplication tables. My 8 y.o. is still working on <br/>
printing and addition.<br/>
Just give them time to de-school and they&#39;ll come around. It&#39;s a humans <br/>
nature to learn. They will surprise you.<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714431159">IHello!<br/>
	I guess this is as good a time for my intro as any.  Like others who <br/>
have expressed an inability to remember 87 names and bios/intros, I can&#39;t <br/>
possibly commit all of this to memory and can&#39;t afford the disk space to save <br/>
them all.  I admit to having just deleted many intros because I knew I&#39;d <br/>
never remember who was who.  So if you delete mine, I&#39;ll understand.<br/>
	I wanted to respond to Kim in Ohio&#39;s comments because they mirror <br/>
many of my own feelings but first a word about us.  So far, we&#39;re the only <br/>
Californian&#39;s I&#39;ve seen on this list.  I&#39;m Judy, dh is John, and we have an <br/>
only; 10-year old Mary.  We took Mary out of p.s. a year ago, at which time I <br/>
took myself out, too.  I was a classroom aide at our local p.s. and my <br/>
frustration with the system, combined with the lack of challenge Mary was <br/>
experiencing led to our decision to homeschool.<br/>
	Like Kim in Ohio, we started out doing school at home because that&#39;s <br/>
what I knew.  It&#39;s what I felt confident doing.  It didn&#39;t work.   As time <br/>
went on, I saw Mary&#39;s interest in things she formerly found fascinating start <br/>
to flag.  She became bored.  She lost interest in dance, and after 5 years of <br/>
being passionate about it, this came as a shock!  I decided to stop doing <br/>
anything and let her be.  That worked for about 3 months and then I started <br/>
getting antsy that I wasn&#39;t doing anything so I started pulling together <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot;.  We&#39;d read a little history....boring.  We&#39;d look at some websites <br/>
together....boring.  We&#39;d do some Math....boring.  Hmmmmm.  Still not <br/>
working.  More time off to deschool.<br/>
	That&#39;s when I noticed an interesting thing happening.  Mary would ask <br/>
to use the computer and spend HOURS writing on the word processor.  Then she <br/>
asked how to use the publishing program so she could publish books.  Then she <br/>
started asking if we could play a Math game.  (We use Family Math).  Then she <br/>
started pulling out various Art supplies and leaving them laying around all <br/>
the time.  Then she asked if we could do something in her Chemistry set.  It <br/>
goes on and on, but you get the idea.  Right now we&#39;re in a bit of a slump <br/>
and I chalk it up to the end of the &quot;school year&quot;.  <br/>
	We have plans for the summer that include performing in children&#39;s <br/>
theater, piano lessons, making a small quilt, using the solar oven Mary <br/>
built, learning how to run a small business (mine), and trying to get more <br/>
exercise.  Next year, or whenever, we plan on doing lots more Art, utilizing <br/>
mentors in our community.  We&#39;ve decided to abandon dance for awhile and <br/>
pursue piano in its place.  We&#39;ll see how our new, more relaxed stance plays <br/>
out.  I envision a happier family.<br/>
	Thanks for listening, and thanks for this list!<br/>
Judy in CA<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024177101"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:APPLEKJF@...">APPLEKJF@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On to my questions... Since I have just started a year ago, and Justin is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>11, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;is it wise to unschool him at this point? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say it&#39;s a great time. I realized from a hsing seminar that by this age<br/>
he will be just starting to repeat everything learned in elementary years<br/>
waiting for high school to start. So with that in mind I let my now 11 yos<br/>
unschool. It was amazing. He went from being told that he was ADD and<br/>
wouldn&#39;t amount to much from the school because he would tune them out,or<br/>
because his art work was messy, or ....<br/>
<br/>
Instead, he volunteered at a local retail store, waited on customers<br/>
(including operating the cash register which he loved), then he found<br/>
himself a job delivering papers. With a weekly paycheck he does his own<br/>
banking/spending/saving which helped the math alot. He then doubled his<br/>
route size, at the same time he made friends with a recluse in the<br/>
neighborhood who watched over him as he learned how to build computers. He<br/>
invested in a better computer, having installment payments, had to read<br/>
some manuals for installation, and reads cover to cover his computer<br/>
shopper catalogs. He&#39;s dealing with customers daily, and just got a call<br/>
tonight that he is going to be the areas carrier of the week for next week.<br/>
 He still likes to be read to rather than read books, but he will sit down<br/>
and read somethings. He says he can&#39;t do decimals, but can handle money and<br/>
calculate taxes in his head (but he says that&#39;s different.lol). <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also traveled quite a bit, his favorite thing is to plan our routes<br/>
and try to get us to go through larger cities so he can find all the sports<br/>
areanas. Try getting him lost on a road trip, we always avoid the highways<br/>
for the scenic route and have needed him to adjust for road constructions too.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I went on long enough, but the point is that allowing him to find his<br/>
own interests will allow what he does learn to stay with him much longer<br/>
than the things we memorized then immediately forgot after the test. He<br/>
doesn&#39;t even realize how much he is learning each day. Every now and then<br/>
he will ask how many days he has logged for school, when I tell him he is<br/>
very surprised. He sometimes will read through his log when the realization<br/>
of how much he learned sinks in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Soon school transcripts and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;records for college will come into play, how do I manage this if I am truly <br/>
&gt;unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest son 14, just completed his evaluation for 9th grade. He was<br/>
credited with 7.5 credits towards graduation! but on the way to the<br/>
evaluation,he asked me how he was going to pass this year as he really<br/>
didn&#39;t do anything. When the evaluator looked at all of the stuff in his<br/>
portfolio, he remarked to my son that he was glad I wasn&#39;t his mother as<br/>
I&#39;d wear him out with all the stuff we do. My son burst out laughing<br/>
remembering our conversation in the car.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that it would seem almost impossible not to complete what is<br/>
required for high school through just living. A teen tends to get something<br/>
in his/her head and must figure it out. One good example of this from this<br/>
year was: My son and I listened to a newsprogram which mentioned the<br/>
Japanese banking crisis.  He asked why they didn&#39;t just print more money,<br/>
so we began an indepth conversation on banking/economics etc. That wasn&#39;t<br/>
good enough so he dug out his _Whatever happened to Penny cAndy_ and while<br/>
I was running a couple of errands had pretty much what he needed. He then<br/>
wrote up a paper to convince me how Japan could fix their problems. It was<br/>
very thought out, and while I don&#39;t agree with all of his plan, we have<br/>
economists arguing the situation so he&#39;s in good company.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I have noticed that my boys backslide, lose the knowledge they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;previously displayed, when we slack off and become more informal.  This <br/>
&gt;concerns me greatly, can anyone help me with this????  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What kind of knowledge?  If the knowledge they are forgetting are things<br/>
like grammar rules or dates or something like that, then its something that<br/>
they don&#39;t feel a need for now. OTOH, I bet they can rattle off batting<br/>
averages or whatever their passion is. When it comes to grammar, I&#39;d be<br/>
more concerned about how they write than if they know all the rules.<br/>
Learning doesn&#39;t consist of just those things that can be measured, if you<br/>
watch you will notice that they are absorbing so much more but it may not<br/>
fit nicely into school subjects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 When the children are <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;doing close to nothing (usually not a problem with Justin), for quite some <br/>
&gt;time, how do you manage that at my boys&#39; ages?  All those books on the shelf <br/>
&gt;that they never touch, how do you get them interested, or do I just keep <br/>
&gt;dusting?! <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d keep dusting.&lt;g&gt;  They may surprise you and find an interest in them<br/>
sometime, but they may not. What kinds of books do you have on the shelf?<br/>
Did you pick them out or did they? I found that for my youngest who doesnt&#39;<br/>
care much to read, that I&#39;d picked out all kinds of books that *I* thought<br/>
he&#39;d like. But he didn&#39;t have much input into the ones that were choosen.<br/>
So one day I decided to institute a &quot;school allowance&quot;. Because we unschool<br/>
there are so many things that fit as educational. ONce my son had a set<br/>
amount that he could spend on school things he started to mention all kinds<br/>
of things he wanted. Out went the boredom, and he even bought some books,<br/>
most were Wishbone mysteries or classics, but he bought books and the<br/>
classics added up to Literature class!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I apologize for sounding so ignorant... it is quite embarassing in fact.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I truly need the help and advice of &quot;experienced&quot; unschoolers who have had <br/>
&gt;several years under their belts watching their children grow and trusting <br/>
&gt;their children. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hope I was of help, this is only our second year home from the ps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I want to somewhat settle into a way of living where I am <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;not constantly second guessing myself, irritating my children, feeling <br/>
&gt;totally inadequate, and spending way too much money on things that don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;belong in my home!   HELP!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d suggest picking up things and leaving them lying around that you are<br/>
interested in too.  I love books,so one of my best finds this year was<br/>
Peter Mendels&#39; _Material World_. I got it from the library and left it set<br/>
on the table. No one touched it, so later that night I set down with it.<br/>
Before long one son arrived to find out what was so interesting. I showed<br/>
him how the book was arranged and he asked if he could see it. I told him<br/>
he could later, so he tried to pull the guilt trip that this was school and<br/>
I should let him see it. After a little while enjoying this I gave it to<br/>
him. The next day son number 2 wanted to know why we were &quot;fighting&quot; over a<br/>
book. After a while he asked if he could see it. This went on for so long<br/>
that I had to renew it a couple of times.  You can do this with almost<br/>
anything. Right now is planting season here, so I pulled out a seed<br/>
catalog, it didn&#39;t take long before each child had a list of edible plants<br/>
they wanted to grow and each choose an area in the yard for their garden.<br/>
So now we are getting our gardens in.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am looking forward to networking with you all and hearing your advice on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;matters of concern.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It will all work out. Just relax.<br/>

&lt;&lt; All those books on the shelf <br/>
 that they never touch, how do you get them interested, or do I just keep <br/>
 dusting?!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while to deschool the kids after you pull them out.  How long they <br/>
were in school will determine how long to deschool.  Everyone is different.  <br/>
The best advise I can give is to let them be for a while and trust that they <br/>
will eventually pick up a book.  Soon they will become bored and will look <br/>
for something to do.  They may even find some new subject or project that <br/>
needs exploring in order to do it.  How about just letting them explore their <br/>
interests?  If they have an interest in cars let them go for it.  Lots can be <br/>
learned from cars, like physics and chemistry.  Do they like to take things <br/>
apart?  You could get some electrical appliances or some other such things at <br/>
Goodwill and let them take them apart and reassemble.  While they are at it <br/>
they could figure out how they work.  Lots of great websites for subjects <br/>
like this.  Here are a few <br/>

I had to let my daughter deschool.  It took a whole year before she would <br/>
pick up a book and read for pleasure.  Now she reads about 10 novels a month. <br/>
 Have patience and take the time to let them discover themselves.  You&#39;ll be <br/>
amazed at the results.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I read that for every year in ps, that&#39;s how many years <br/>
 it takes to de-school.<br/>
 I really think that school is evil. They tell you what to do, when to do it, <br/>
 how to do it,<br/>
 and God-forbid if you don&#39;t do it &quot;right&quot;. It&#39;s no wonder that when we pull <br/>
 our children out and &quot;unschool&quot; them, they don&#39;t know what to do with <br/>
 themselves!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    This is really something that touches my heart.  My 17 yos has been out <br/>
of school since the middle of 7th grade.  We also held him back a year when <br/>
he was small, so he is technically going to just be a junior this year.  He <br/>
is the main reason that I started homeschooling, since he was verbally abused <br/>
by two different teachers, was considered ADD and slow (although he got good <br/>
grades) and was ridiculed for being different.  I could cry right now for <br/>
everything the public school system put him through (unfortunately, call me <br/>
naive, but I never heard of homeschooling before he was in 6th grade, and <br/>
then it took me a year to get up the nerve, and 6 months to talk my dh into <br/>
it).<br/>
     Anyway, my other children have really blossomed from unschooling, <br/>
especially my 7 yod, who has never gone to public school.  My 10 yos is a <br/>
little more laid back, and sometimes likes doing workbooks (yuck!), and my 13 <br/>
yos is constantly finding something new to get involved in, just like all the <br/>
stories I read in GWS and Home Education magazines (photography, cooking, <br/>
video making, history books, you name it).  My 17 yos, however, doesn&#39;t <br/>
really want to do anything.  He hates anything remotely connected to <br/>
schoolwork, so I try to relax with him, but since he is getting so old (and <br/>
my ps teacher parents keep pushing) I am getting worried about him and his <br/>
future.  I have tried every type of Algebra book that I can find (public <br/>
school books, Abeka, Saxon, and Principles From Patterns by Making Math <br/>
Meaningful), and in the two years of &quot;high school&quot; that he has done at home, <br/>
he has not yet finished even 1/2 of any algebra book.<br/>
     I get concerned and try to &quot;do school&quot; with him, but we both get <br/>
frustrated and it feels like no-one is really learning anything--like we are <br/>
just forcing things.  He gets entirely frustrated with me, so once again I <br/>
lay off, but then all he wants to do is read Star Wars books, Robert Jordan <br/>
books, play nintendo 64, or play on the internet.  I keep wondering when he <br/>
will finally be &quot;deschooled&quot; and ready to learn.  He has been out of school <br/>
for 3 1/2 years, isn&#39;t that long enough?  I know that he had a very <br/>
emotionally bad time at public school, and I am trying to understand him, but <br/>
he just doesn&#39;t seem to want to do anything productive. <br/>
     I don&#39;t really know anyone who unschools here, like I said this is a <br/>
very structured school-at-home homeschool group here.  I do have some more <br/>
&quot;relaxed&quot; friends that I met from doing KONOS, although they don&#39;t quite <br/>
unschool, but even they are telling me that he needs to do structured <br/>
schooling since he is in high school (all of them have smaller children), and <br/>
that he won&#39;t be very disciplined in his character if I don&#39;t make him be <br/>
more structured.  They say that I am allowing him to be lazy.  Needless to <br/>
say, this all concerns me deeply.  I sure don&#39;t want to be hurting my son.  I <br/>
would hate to look back years later, and think that he is not getting a job, <br/>
or he is living at home and not working, just because I allowed him freedom <br/>
to unschool during his teen years.<br/>
     Is there anyone else who is dealing with an unmotivated teenager?  What <br/>
do I need to do?  Should I back off and give him freedom or should I give him <br/>
more structure?<br/>

&lt;&lt; hat&#39;s when I noticed an interesting thing happening.  Mary would ask <br/>
 to use the computer and spend HOURS writing on the word processor.  Then she <br/>
 asked how to use the publishing program so she could publish books.  Then <br/>
she <br/>
 started asking if we could play a Math game.  (We use Family Math).  Then <br/>
she <br/>
 started pulling out various Art supplies and leaving them laying around all <br/>
 the time.  Then she asked if we could do something in her Chemistry set.  It <br/>
 goes on and on, but you get the idea.  Right now we&#39;re in a bit of a slump <br/>
 and I chalk it up to the end of the &quot;school year&quot;.  <br/>
 	We have plans for the summer that include performing in children&#39;s <br/>
 theater, piano lessons, making a small quilt, using the solar oven Mary <br/>
 built, learning how to run a small business (mine), and trying to get more <br/>
 exercise.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

     It sounds to me like Mary is doing great!  This is what I wish my 17 yos <br/>
would do.  However, since he is a teenager, that had so many years of public <br/>
school, I am wondering if I am wanting too much.  I would say, &quot;Keep up the <br/>
good work&quot;<br/>

unschooling too, although homeschooled for the past five years.  I am one of <br/>
those moms who have the problem of the kids regressing when we are loose.  In <br/>
math this year, my oldest did less then he did last year, and that really <br/>
bothered me.  When I don&#39;t make them do anything, my boys just want to play <br/>
pokemon or playstation.  I know that pokemon has learning value, but, that <br/>
and watching scooby doo or dragon ball z is their choice of things to do.  <br/>
So, I don&#39;t know where to go from here<br/>

    Hey, they sound like my boys.  My kids have been begging for pokemon, <br/>
that is one game they do not have yet.  What kind of learning value does it <br/>
have?  I am not familiar with that game at all, even though I sure hear my <br/>
kids talking about it all the time.<br/>
     I wish I could help you, but I am in the same boat.  Do you think if we <br/>
yell help together, that they would send someone to rescue us?  Let&#39;s <br/>

&lt;&lt; Tami, I went all the way thru highschool and never took one ounce of <br/>
algebra<br/>
 or preAlgebra, and I am a fine functioning human! I did take buisness math,<br/>
 and that helped, I just didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t GET it!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I did take all Algebra/Geometry etc.  NOT because I wanted to but my <br/>
parents made me so I could get into a good college.  I hated it!!!!  I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand it......I got horrible grades in it.  And to this day, I do not <br/>
retain anything from it.  For me, Business Math and Basic Accounting was more <br/>
beneficial for me.<br/>

LOL! I think joining together to yell help will probably help.  At least we <br/>
know there is at least one other family out there who is in the same boat.  I <br/>
get real concerned when I hear how all these other kids go to their rooms and <br/>
read for hours, or write books.  Mine just want to play and play.  <br/>
Pokemon is a game for gameboy.  Their is a guide book that you also need to <br/>
buy to help them get from place to place.  They learn a lot of map reading <br/>
from the book, its like mazes or something, plus they learn to use logic.  <br/>
Now the boys have a link and can play together or do battle, or trade their <br/>
pokemon men.  That&#39;s about as much as I know about the game.  I don&#39;t mind <br/>
it, but I think there needs to be something else in their life!!<br/>

Hi, I was just wondering if you had tried anything on the net to help with <br/>
the algebra?  There is so much out there, maybe you could find something. <br/>
Have you tried these sites?   <br/>

can find some more for you.<br/>

&lt;&lt; .  I have tried every type of Algebra book that I can find (public<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;school books, Abeka, Saxon, and Principles From Patterns by Making Math<br/>
 &gt;Meaningful), and in the two years of &quot;high school&quot; that he has done at<br/>
 </span></blockquote> home,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;he has not yet finished even 1/2 of any algebra book.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old is he? He wants to learn Algebra or you are insisting on it?<br/>
<br/>
My 14 yo wants to learn Algebra - she&#39;s not a big math lover, by any means, <br/>
but she&#39;s taking various classes at the community college and really wants to <br/>
go on to a university and realizes that having a solid math background is <br/>
likely to be important - she&#39;ll take the SAT and may need high scores to get <br/>
into some of the colleges she&#39;s interested in. And, she wants to feel <br/>
&quot;educated&quot; in math, too. Doesn&#39;t want it to be some big monster that makes <br/>
her feel inadequate &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
So - she&#39;s started and stopped a variety of approaches to Algebra. Hands-On <br/>
Algebra, Keys to Algebra, and Harold Jacobs Algebra book (which is wonderful <br/>
wonderful wonderful, imo, and she likes it too, when she works in it - but <br/>
she just doesn&#39;t ever seem to get to it).<br/>
<br/>
But - she always got distracted and didn&#39;t get very far before it seemed to <br/>
just get lost in the shuffle of a very busy life.<br/>
<br/>
Now she&#39;s using simple workbooks from the educational supply store - and <br/>
seems to be totally happy with them.  They are the &quot;Straight Forward Math <br/>
Series&quot; published by Garlic Press. They also carry them at Borders.  They <br/>
start from a book on Addition and go through Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus. <br/>
They are straightforward - written in English, not Mathese &lt;G&gt;. Each book is <br/>
$7.95 - there are two Algebra books, about 75 pages each. My daughter doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to have any hesitation in picking these up and doing a page or two <br/>
everyday. She doesn&#39;t seem to be frustrated at all with them.  So - either <br/>
SHE just reached the developmental readiness for the kind of abstract <br/>
thinking that algebra requires, or we finally hit on a resource with an <br/>
approach that suits her. <br/>

Ok, for adults wanting to learn Algebra, Key To Algebra is an excellent <br/>
series.  ALSO the Logical Journey of the Zoombinis is a computer game that <br/>
teaches algebraic concepts, without you realizing it.  Critical thinking <br/>
skills too.  If  your kids (or you) like computer games, then get this <br/>
one....  Unschooling is thinking outside the box... there are LOTS of ways to <br/>
learn stuff that is &quot;important&quot; in life - we just need to discover them!!!<br/>

<br/>
I graduated from high school and college without taking an ounce of algebra. <br/>
In college I was only required to take statistics for my major. Guess what my <br/>
major was? Elementary Education!!! So don&#39;t worry, even the public school <br/>
teachers out there haven&#39;t taken algebra. :o)<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of unschooling is that you don&#39;t have to do ANYTHING you <br/>
don&#39;t want too. If your child reaches a point where they realize they need <br/>
algebra for something they are interested in, then they will figure out how <br/>
to take it. Whether it is at the community college, a friends dad/mom, or <br/>
their own parents.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that I&#39;m surprised to hear so many of you talking about using <br/>
curriculums when most unschoolers I have met shun all forms of &#39;formal <br/>
curriculum&#39; unless the child has expressed a desire to learn in a more formal <br/>
environment. Is there anyone on the list who is completely unschooling?<br/>

<br/>
I have heard some lovely debates over that concept!!! :o) Some unschoolers <br/>
think you can&#39;t use anything curriculum related, some think if the child asks <br/>
for workbooks it&#39;s ok and some think curriculums are wonderful. <br/>
<br/>
I think it was Andi who said that unschooling is a lifestyle and I couldn&#39;t <br/>
agree more. As unschoolers you learn to look at the world as whole, not in <br/>
labeled segments. You are always learning whether you want to or not and <br/>
every new experience is a lesson in life. I wish Sandra Dodd was here, she <br/>
has amazing things to say about life-led-education.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t use a curriculum but my 8yo loves workbooks so when she asks for one <br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with it because it is her choice. I never give the <br/>
girls assignments or expect them to read a certain number of pages, ect. I <br/>
think homeschooling covers a tremendously broad arena of  educational styles <br/>
and no one person is right or wrong, it just depends on what works best for <br/>
your child and family. <br/>

&quot;Well, to tell you the truth, honey, I&#39;m really not sure what it is&quot;. LOL! <br/>
I&#39;ve asked several people over the last year if they&#39;ve ever used algebra in <br/>
their daily life and only ONE answered yes. He said something about measuring <br/>
pipes and angles or something. Well, gosh, my dh is a maintenance man and is <br/>
always measuring stuff and works with all kinds of angles and he doesn&#39;t even <br/>
know what the heck algebra is! I&#39;m not making my children learn it unless <br/>
they ask for it. (Cannot even imagine...)<br/>

     Thanks, that makes me feel much better!  I know that I know that in my <br/>
heart, and I have sure gotten that impression from GWS, but coming from a <br/>
family that is &quot;college oriented&quot; that is tough, since they all keep telling <br/>
me he will need Algebra to get into college.  What will they say when they <br/>
learn that he may not want to go to college!<br/>
I shiver to think about it!<br/>
