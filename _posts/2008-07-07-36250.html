<br/>
First think.  Sometimes you won&#39;t even need to write. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Sometimes write.  Sometimes you won&#39;t even need to post it in public.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to discourage you from posting at all.  Post away!<br/>
But if you admit you posted something you hadn&#39;t thought about,<br/>
you&#39;re putting carts before horses.<br/>
======================================================================<br/>
I wrote the second part in January 2006.  It popped up for some other  <br/>
reason but seems applicable to the past day or two here.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be mean when I ask people to read carefully and  <br/>
post thoughtfully.<br/>
