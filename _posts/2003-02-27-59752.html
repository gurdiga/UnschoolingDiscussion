<br/>
Care to elaborate Pam? What do you (the mathemetician) consider to be the <br/>
important concepts and skills? And what does a math-healthy unschooling <br/>
family do in a practical sense to support their kids understanding of the <br/>
language of numbers and patterns?<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

SC Conference!<br/>
