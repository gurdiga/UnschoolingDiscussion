&lt;&lt; I am not telling anyone that they have to put an appropriate title in the<br/>
 subject line.  I am just asking, if it is not too much trouble and you<br/>
 happen to remember, could you please try to do this. &gt;&gt;<br/>
    <br/>
Thanks for the reminder.<br/>
I am one of the worst offenders!! It&#39;s just so easy to hit &quot;reply&quot; when I get <br/>

I for one, will try to remember.<br/>
