<div id="ygrps-yiv-455082009">Ahh, right, Sandra! I&#39;d actually have to make a double line of the<br/>
little balls and measure that to get a much better ballpark figure.<br/>
Cool! See, math is better as social activity - for me anyway. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; Hmm... that is three<br/>
&gt; measurements, the measure of three dimensions.... giving you voila! the<br/>
&gt; volume of space in the room calculated in Ping-Pong balls.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That would work if they were cubes, but won&#39;t a sphere fit down in the space<br/>
&gt; left by four spheres together (on one plane, I mean) and shouldn&#39;t you get<br/>
&gt; more ping-pong balls into a space than you would same-size cubes?<br/>
