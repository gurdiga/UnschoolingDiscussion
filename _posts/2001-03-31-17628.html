<div id="ygrps-yiv-213968212">Yup, that always seemed kinda cruel to me.  He set ALL the birds loose, even<br/>
the trained ones.  Most of those died because they hadn&#39;t a clue how to<br/>
survive.  Sad.<br/>

This is the coolest thing I&#39;ve read for a long, long time.<br/>
<br/>
It hadn&#39;t thought about what happened to all those birds, nor ever heard that <br/>
they were just let loose.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the scariest movies ever.  THAT I haven&#39;t brought home for my <br/>
kids to watch, although they&#39;ve seen a few scenes in movies about moviemaking <br/>
(the phone booth scene).   To have &quot;stars of the show&quot; loose in your <br/>
neighborhood performing their trained behaviors...    yikes!<br/>
