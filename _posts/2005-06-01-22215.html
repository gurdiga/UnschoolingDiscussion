<div id="ygrps-yiv-916714835">Hey, everybody! I just wanted to say &quot;hi&quot; and introduce myself. My name is Michelle, and I am unschooling in Texas with my three kiddos. They are 9, 5, and 3. The two older ones are girls, and the youngest is my boy. (That last part is said like &quot;my bo-eh&quot; with a Texas accent.) Anyway, I&#39;ve been on the list for a couple of weeks, lurking. Thought it was time to speak up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have to tell ya&#39;ll what just happened to me. (I get distracted sometimes, you see.) Well, I went to look at the pictures of Holly in England, and read the notes attached to them. I forgot that my 5 year old and I had just put a pot of corn on the stove. :/ Pretty soon my 9 year old yelled out, &quot;I smell something burning!&quot;, so I ran to the kitchen. Yeah, you guessed it. Burned corn. YUK! So my house smells disgusting now. Plus, I think I just ruined a pot. I&#39;m thinking I need a timer to actually carry around with me, on my person, so I don&#39;t forget these important things. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have one of those timers.  Without it I might never take teabags out, nor <br/>
move the water in the yard, nor  know when a casserole still existed.  (Yes, I <br/>
can totally forget I made something.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry a page  I made might&#39;ve ruined your pot.<br/>
If it&#39;s steel, soak it and then use scouring powder like Ajax and then soak <br/>
it again.  Repeat when you think of it.  I&#39;ve recovered some really burned pans <br/>
that way, when I liked them and they were steel.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s aluminum, put it under a nice potted plant to catch the excess water!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and welcome. &lt;g&gt;  And I was just finishing packing up tapes and sticks <br/>
and seeds to mail you (thanks!) when I saw your intro pop up and recognized your <br/>
name from the box in my lap. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595082232">I forgot to post that I did scrub the black stuff off the pan. I washed it about 3 - 4 times with dish soap, then scraped it with a spoon a little bit. (I know I probably shouldn&#39;t have done that. It&#39;s a non-stick pan.) Then I got the bright idea that a green scrubby might take the rest of it off. It did. I didn&#39;t even think of Ajax. That probably would have worked the first time. Oh well. I did get it all off. And it only has one scratch, which I believe was already there before this episode. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t your page&#39;s fault at all. It was my distractability. (Is that a word?) I&#39;m glad you posted those pics of Holly. My oldest seems a lot like your Holly. I could totally see her doing something like that. I told her about the pictures. I&#39;ll show her some other time. She&#39;s been interested in other things besides the Internet, lately. Anyway, she said, &quot;Mom, I do that sometimes.&quot; And then I remembered times she actually has done that same thing with mud. But it was Texas mud. We have that clumpy black stuff. The English mud looked better for full coverage. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sending my stuff so fast. I can&#39;t wait to see those sticks. They sound cool.<br/>
<br/>

It rolls off your dresser to some new location when you hit the snooze; <br/>
you have to wake up enough to find it to turn it off.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is so cool!  When I was in college I had 3 alarm clocks, 2 clear<br/>
across the room that wouldn&#39;t stop.  My friend had one that got louder and<br/>
louder until it sounded like a fog horn in your room -- it had no snooze<br/>
button.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting how college students have trouble getting up in the morning.  I<br/>
wonder if it&#39;s because for the first time in their life they&#39;re able to go<br/>
to bed when they want to, but they overdue it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035421664">I love my radio alarm clock. I wake to Steve Inskeep and Morning Edition, and the volume is low enough that I generally wake over a minute or two (rather than abruptly, from the awful Beepy Buzz). It&#39;s not quiet, but not real loud, either. I set the alarm for 5 or 10 minutes before I really have to get up, and by them I&#39;m usually ready.<br/>
<br/>
For the summer, I get to work at 6, after a twenty minute drive. Two am is my usual bedtime. Something clearly needs to change here...<br/>
