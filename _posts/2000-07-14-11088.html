Definitions: Women and Men<br/>
<br/>
WOMEN<br/>
<br/>
Women have strengths that amaze men. They carry children, they carry<br/>
hardships, they carry burdens, but they hold happiness, love, and joy. They<br/>
smile when they want to scream. They sing when they want to cry. They cry<br/>
when they are happy and laugh when they are nervous. Women wait by the<br/>
phone for a &quot;safe at home call&quot; from a friend after a snowy drive home.<br/>
Women have special qualities about them. They volunteer for good causes.<br/>
They are pink ladies in hospitals, they bring food to shut-ins. They are<br/>
child care workers, executives, attorneys, stay-at-home moms, biker babes,<br/>
and your neighbors. They wear suits, jeans, and they wear uniforms. They<br/>
fight for what they believe in. They stand up for injustice. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They are in the front row at PTA meetings.  They vote for the person that<br/>
will do the best job for family issues. They<br/>
walk and talk the extra mile to get their children in the right schools and<br/>
for getting their family the right health care. They write to the editor,<br/>
their congressmen and to the &quot;powers that be&quot; for things that make for a<br/>
better life. They don&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer when they believe there is<br/>
a better solution.<br/>
  <br/>
They stick a love note in the lover&#39;s lunch box. They do without new shoes<br/>
so their children can have them. They go to the doctor with a frightened<br/>
friend.<br/>
<br/>
They love unconditionally. Women are honest, loyal, and forgiving. They<br/>
are smart, knowing that knowledge is power. But they still know how to use<br/>
their softer side to make a point. Women want to be the best for their<br/>
family, their friends, and themselves. They cry when their children excel<br/>
and cheer when their friends get awards.<br/>
<br/>
They are happy when they hear about a birth or a new marriage. Their hearts<br/>
break when a friend dies. They have sorrow at the loss of a family member,<br/>
yet are strong when they think there is no strength left. A women&#39;s touch<br/>
can cure any ailment. They know that a hug and a kiss can heal a broken<br/>
heart. A woman can make a romantic evening unforgettable. Women come in all<br/>
sizes, in all colors and shapes. They live in homes, apartments, and<br/>
cabins. They drive, fly, walk, run, or e-mail you to show you how much they<br/>
care about you. The heart of a woman is what makes the world spin!<br/>
Women do more than just give birth. They bring joy and hope. They give<br/>
compassion and ideals. They give moral support to their family and friends.<br/>
And all they want back is a hug, a smile, and for you to do the same to<br/>
people you come in contact with.<br/>

outside (except mosquitoes. If they decide to follow me into the house, then<br/>
it&#39;s self protection and no more Mr. Nice Guy!)<br/>
