Here&#39;s an article from that really well-organized and extensive site:<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling Fallacies<br/>
<br/>
by Teri Brown<br/>
<br/>
There are so many misconceptions about unschooling I thought I would devote <br/>
an entire article to those pesky notions that plague all unschoolers at some <br/>
point or another. If another person comes up to me and says that children <br/>
can&#39;t learn without being pushed, I will not only scream, I will run madly <br/>
into the night, which of course would only give rise to the misconception <br/>
that unschoolers love to run screaming into the night. <br/>
<br/>
Part of the dilemma, as I see it, is people can judge a group by meeting one <br/>
person from that group. They might decide, for instance, after meeting a <br/>
family whose kids are playing Nintendo during “school hours” that video <br/>
games are all that family does and that video games are all unschoolers do, <br/>
period. They don&#39;t stop to think that possibly the children were taking a <br/>
break from designing a solar car, creating a replica of the Mona Lisa or <br/>
building a teepee in the back yard. Maybe Mom is not feeling so hot or maybe <br/>
the kids like to play video games and the wise mother, feeling that Nintendo <br/>
will help her son&#39;s poor hand eye coordination, lets them play on! Then the <br/>
person who finds them playing the video games, who probably was against <br/>
unschooling in the first place, tars all unschoolers with the same brush and <br/>
makes a blanket statement, “All unschoolers do is allow their children to <br/>
play video games and watch TV all day. That is, after all what children will <br/>
do if not pushed.”<br/>
<br/>
Other Unschooling Fallacies: <br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children are completely responsible for their own education and <br/>
parents never help their children learn.<br/>
<br/>
This one not only makes me laugh, but really dishonors all those unschoolers <br/>
who run their children to classes, find mentors for them, help them when <br/>
their children ask for it, spend hours at the library, carefully choose books <br/>
for reading aloud, take countless field trips, and play tons of games with <br/>
their children. Unschooling parents are very involved with their children&#39;s <br/>
education...... they just don&#39;t run it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents are too lazy to take the time to sit down and teach their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
See above answer.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling families have no discipline in their homes. <br/>
<br/>
Some do have discipline in their homes and some don&#39;t. Just like any other <br/>
family. I think this misconception stems from the fact that many people think <br/>
if a child has choices in their education that they get to do whatever they <br/>
want whenever they want to and they will always make bad choices. Child <br/>
rearing techniques are as varied in unschoolers as they are in any other <br/>
group of people.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers never use text books.<br/>
<br/>
This is another totally false assumption. Unschooling children and teens use <br/>
text books quite a bit, it&#39;s the parents who don&#39;t use text books. The <br/>
difference being, of course, that parents do not use them to teach.....the <br/>
children use them to learn. Major difference.<br/>
<br/>
You might be able to unschool young children successfully but you can&#39;t <br/>
unschool teens.<br/>
<br/>
Teens are at the very best age to unschool. The possibilities for teenagers <br/>
in regard to volunteer opportunities, internships and focused learning is <br/>
endless. Younger children often have difficulties getting adults to take them <br/>
seriously in giving them jobs or volunteer positions. Teens generally don&#39;t <br/>
have that problem. The world opens up for them and this is a time when they <br/>
can really concentrate on their interests, taking advantage of the freedom <br/>
most adults don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are hippies, eat granola and sprouts, and wear sandals.<br/>
<br/>
Like any other people group unschoolers are diverse in both our dress and <br/>
eating habits. We are also diverse in where we live, our jobs, and our <br/>
various faiths. <br/>
<br/>
Though I find these fallacies to be laughable, I also find them rather <br/>
frightening. Whenever you lump a group of people together and make <br/>
generalizations about them you are practicing bigotry. From bigotry you will <br/>
get discrimination. Unfortunately, much of the discrimination that <br/>
unschoolers receive is from within the homeschool movement itself and <br/>
espoused by some homeschool leaders. I care not whether these leaders agree <br/>
with how my children are educated, I care very much that I retain the right <br/>
to educate them as I feel best. Only by bursting these fallacies will people <br/>
begin to understand what unschoolers are trying to achieve. <br/>

First off, Thanks Sandra, for thinking enough of this piece for posting <br/>
this:) And thanks for the compliment to our site! <br/>
<br/>
Bridget, I don&#39;t know what is going on here as I havent been able to keep up <br/>
with this thread, but I didnt like my article being chopped without credit to <br/>
the correct person:) Not really upset, but when you did that, it began with <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandradodd@...">Sandradodd@...</a> writes! LOL Then my comments can be tossed all over the <br/>
web without being in context... though I suppose that can happen at any time <br/>
anyway! Ah well, small price to pay for the web I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872372239">I have been wanting to write to the authors of this book soon after I read <br/>
the first few pages.  This book is excellent and has reinforced so much of <br/>
what I believe in for homeschooling.  I want to thank the authors from the <br/>
bottom of my heart for their inspiration to a mom in need of support in her <br/>
efforts to unschool.  I read the book in two sittings staying up to 3 o&#39;clock <br/>
in the morning each night.  I could not put the book down!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for this excellent book and I hope that I can come to know <br/>
you through writing on the internet also.<br/>
