<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944625779">Five sets of twins marked the end of one century, as well as bringing in <br/>
the new.<br/>
Four sets of twins are here in the US, and one set in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
    Mrs. Julie Wallman, of Indianapolis, was informed that she would need a <br/>
C-section. She asked that the doctor waited until close to midnight to start <br/>
the procedure. The result? Jacob saw the end of 1999 at 11:59 pm Friday, and <br/>
his sister, Jordan, saw 2000 at 12:01am Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
    Mr. and Mrs. Beebe rang in the year with Jacob being born the final <br/>
seconds of 1999, and his brother, Joshua, arriving just one minute later. <br/>
Joshua (being first in the New Year) will receive a case of diapers, three <br/>
months of maid service, other gifts, and an older brother! What a New Year <br/>
gift!<br/>
<br/>
    In Fairfax, Virginia, a woman (unidentified to my sources) gave birth to <br/>
a girl at 11:52 pm, and her brother rang in the New Year at 12:01 am.<br/>
<br/>
    In Seattle, a couple had some waiting at hand. Their son was born at <br/>
10:06 Friday evening, and his brother decided to tally along, being born at <br/>
12:16am Saturday morning.<br/>
<br/>
    In Germany, a woman gave birth to Mircem, four minutes before midnight. <br/>
His brother, Mircan, followed at 12:01 Saturday morning.<br/>
<br/>
    There were numerous births to ring in the New Year, but twins embracing <br/>
the old and new is something else. These twins will have different <br/>
birthdates, months, and years. The continual argument of &quot;I am older than <br/>
you&quot; will take on a whole new meaning, for, &quot;I am born a YEAR before you,&quot; <br/>
shall slip off the tongues of the first. What a wonderful beginning for these <br/>
children!<br/>
<br/>
Stephanie and Ron<br/>
&#39;&#39;If we listen to our children, they will tell us the future we should <br/>
build.&#39;&#39; <br/>
