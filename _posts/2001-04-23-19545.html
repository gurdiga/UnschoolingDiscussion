<div id="ygrps-yiv-778525548">I&#39;ve had several ISP&#39;s, including our local phone co.<br/>
and a small local ISP business, and of all six I&#39;ve<br/>
tried, the two I had the most trouble with were a free<br/>
one and AOL!  Unless your computer is brand new just<br/>
as the technology comes out, it is unlikely to be<br/>
beyond the capabilities of most ISP&#39;s for more than a<br/>
month or two... the technologies move fast, and they<br/>
have to keep up if they want to survive.  Good luck!<br/>
