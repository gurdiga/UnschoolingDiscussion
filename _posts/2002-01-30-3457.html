anything.  Read my signature.<br/>

I often do this.<br/>

Yesterday I was looking for a new name for<br/>
our new dog, whose name is freckles.  My<br/>
daughter wants Hermoine.  So I went to a<br/>
bunch of websites, looking at names and also<br/>
looking to see what Hermoine means.  It<br/>
wasnt&#39; until the end of the day that I<br/>
thought--hm, what if I&#39;m spelling it wrong.<br/>
Hermione.  Oops.  About 2 minutes later I got<br/>
a note from Dar, saying sweetly, Joylyn, are<br/>
you mispelling it? LOL.  Uh, YES!  oh well.<br/>
<br/>
I think we are going with Addie, btw.  for a<br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
And one time I said I was a slut when I meant<br/>
clutz.<br/>
<br/>
oops.<br/>
