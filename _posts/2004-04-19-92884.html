chance I got though.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See, now all my kids played with all kinds of stuff that people talk about<br/>
being dangerous.  None of them have ever got hurt with it.  Hurt with other<br/>
stuff, but not the things I was warned about.<br/>
<br/>
We have a very shallow creekbed at the very back of our 2 acres that<br/>
occassionally has a trickle of water in it.  The people behind us have a<br/>
small bridge running across the creekbed.  We have been having major septic<br/>
problems requiring lots of my time and attention right now (should be fixed<br/>
by tomorrow).  So my kids had gone to the creek to play.  They are 7, 5 and<br/>
4.  Remind you this is our backyard with no streets anywhere in sight even<br/>
and those that are close may have 4 cars per day.<br/>
<br/>
I get a call from the people behind us.  My kids were sitting on their<br/>
bridge and it is dangerous.  I apologized for my kids being in her yard<br/>
(there is no visible demarkation of property) and told her I would retrieve<br/>
them.  She goes on to tell me that their playing in the creek is dangerous,<br/>
they are too small to be unsuperivised.....they were in their own backyard<br/>
(mostly)!<br/>
<br/>
She was horrified.<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled that my kids were happily occupied while I had to tend to<br/>
unpleasant chores.<br/>
<br/>
Different world views....can&#39;t say that one of us was wrong and the other<br/>
right.<br/>

&gt;   I was thinking about the walker that was mentioned. I saw my neice have<br/>
one<br/>

&gt;   Alyssa. She wasn&#39;t thrilled with it and never really used it to walk. It<br/>
sat<br/>
&gt;   for quite awhile. Long enough that I thought it was a total wash out.<br/>
&gt;   Probably about a year later, all the kids were using it and playing with<br/>
it.<br/>

&gt;   I think receiving a walker would be a diff. matter for me. They are<br/>
dangerous in my books. Fortunately here in Canada they were just banned and<br/>
can&#39;t be sold in any way now so even if I had another baby I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to deal with it. I would be tempted to have a talk with the giver who might<br/>
not have been aware of the issues aurrounding walkers. Then again, I guess I<br/>
could stick it in the basement until they showed up at the house and stick<br/>
the baby in it at that time for show.<br/>
&gt;    With guests there&#39;d be lots of supervision. It would likely be<br/>
disasembled and tossed first chance I got though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just gave my 9yo for his birthday an ax and a bow saw.  This makes <br/>
some of the people close to us nervous, (and one of his friends was <br/>
in complete awe that he was &quot;allowed&quot; to have those things) but I&#39;m <br/>
not worried at all.<br/>
He&#39;s very calm and careful around such &quot;dangerous&quot; objects because <br/>
they&#39;ve never been kept away from him.  He&#39;s also been collecting <br/>
pocket knives for years now.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Walkers are the one thing I am iffy about. My MIL is almost continually shocked with what my kids do. There&#39;s nothing off limits and I don&#39;t babyproof. But I don&#39;t like walkers because they sort of lift a baby out of her natural limitations and abilities and make things like stairs or stovetops availible to her that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be. And yes, I watch the kids, I&#39;ve watched my two year old play with a plug and outlet and my four year old use steak knives and decided against baby gates and running to catch falling babies. But I also think babies are short and counters are high for a reason and I really don&#39;t want to fool around with the equation by adding something that gives a baby reach and mobility it&#39;s not supposed to have yet. That said, it&#39;s all about my comfort level. I don&#39;t think anything bad of moms that use them when they&#39;re aware of the dangers and watch the kids. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718944091">Besides all that, things like sit-in walkers or even the spinning ones<br/>
primarily serve two purposes for babies: contain them (on a 1-story like<br/>
we have stairs aren&#39;t an issue) or accelerate them (help them learn to<br/>
walk).  They&#39;re also bad for babies&#39; hip and spine development.  I&#39;d<br/>
rather give them something fun to do on the floor or a low surface.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  In my case it wasn&#39;t for containing him.  It actually made him <br/>
more mobile and therefore more in need of watchful eyes.  And as <br/>
for &quot;accelerating&quot; walking, I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.  I think <br/>
that if anything, too much time in a walker would slow down the <br/>
walking process. <br/>

I can&#39;t see how in small doses they&#39;d be bad for any kind of <br/>
development.  My son spent *much* more time either in my arms or <br/>
crawling on the floor than he did in any sort of device.  The walker <br/>
was nice for an occasional change in perspective when he was cranky.<br/>

Exactly. I don&#39;t think anyone here is saying they kept their children that<br/>
used walkers in there all the time. And I would say spinal problems and<br/>
causing them to walk earlier are a bunch of hooey. In my case.<br/>
<br/>
I had 3 children who were very anxious to get up and about. And even though<br/>
those 3 walked at 8 and 9 months, it was a life saver for them (the walker)<br/>
at age 5 and 6 months. They wanted to be mobile and up and about and near<br/>
me. So if I was in the kitchen they could  be right there with me scooting<br/>
about. My other daughter who walked later at a year enjoyed the same freedom<br/>
to be up and near me and involved around the house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004567108">My son adored his walker.  It was literally the only way I could put <br/>
him down without him screaming.  He would walk around in the thing in <br/>
the kitchen while I fixed meals.  He spent maybe a total of 30 <br/>
minutes a day in it.  30 happy minutes for both of us.  He is almost <br/>
5 now and walks fine, he started walking at 11 months, not early for <br/>
most babies, and he has no spine or hip problems.  I will forever be <br/>
thankful for the walker we had when he was a baby.<br/>
