Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I am planning a messy day with the children and we would like to do<br/>
something with clay. I have some recipes for home made clay but it never<br/>
really worked for us, so I want to visit Michael&#39;s and get something<br/>
from their.<br/>
<br/>
Can any of you suggest a brand or a type of clay for small and medium<br/>
size projects, figurines, sculptures etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
Timea<br/>

You could go to a pottery or ceramics supply store and get a 25lb bag of <br/>
real clay for under $10. If you keep it closed tightly it will last for <br/>
years. After you make the creations and let them dry take them back to the <br/>
store for firing. The cost to fire a small firgure would only be about 50 <br/>
cents. I recommend the book &quot;Ceramics for Kids: Creative Clay Projects to <br/>
Pinch, Roll, Coil, Slam & Twist<br/>
by Mary Ellis&quot;.<br/>
