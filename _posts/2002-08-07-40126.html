&gt; What&#39;s not enough for ANYONE is public school. Those places are the centers<br/>
&gt; for the limitation of learning, the denial of education. *Dumbing Down* is<br/>
&gt; not just a catchy phrase, it&#39;s the national government policy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t still believe that schools offer actual education, do you? Think<br/>
&gt; about your own statements -- saying that there is so much you don&#39;t know.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s a good place to start...knowing that by going to school yourself you<br/>
&gt; learned so little, and have not learned SO MUCH since. School teaches<br/>
&gt; children NOT to learn, to despise the process.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The government teaches ONLY what it wants us to know...Darn little.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The place to get an education is EVERYWHERE BUT GOVERNMENT SCHOOL.<br/>
