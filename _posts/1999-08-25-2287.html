<div id="ygrps-yiv-740280013">along the lines of needs and choices, my friends and i have had this same <br/>
enlightenment (about differentiating) and have adopted the practice of being <br/>
careful when we speak to use correct word choices.  for example: &quot;i am <br/>
choosing for us to stay home from that field trip to give us some downtime&quot;  <br/>
instead of &quot; we are so busy i just can&#39;t to that field trip&quot;  or  &quot;i chose to <br/>
spend the day catching up on email between daily stuff&quot;  instead of &quot;i had to <br/>
catch up on emails and it ate up my whole day&quot;  or  (w/kids)&quot;we are choosing <br/>
to give a gift to jane bc we care for her&quot; not &quot;we have to bring a gift&quot;  etc.<br/>
<br/>
even in the case of women &quot;having&quot; to work to pay the bills, isnt it more <br/>
freeing to realize that they are &quot;choosing&quot; to provide for their families <br/>
needs?<br/>
<br/>
i love being empowered by this way of thinking.  it became most clear to me <br/>
when i read covey&#39;s &quot;7 habits of highly effective people.&quot;  now i set limits <br/>
and have had other women comment on the freedom it has given them to see an <br/>
example .  many of us who are not &quot;sleepwalkers&quot; choose to do things even <br/>
when we think we are having to do them.  (have to go the meeting, have to go <br/>
to soccer practice, have to go make supper-- when they are indeed all <br/>
choices!!!!)  i was able to let go of much resentment towards the sacrifices <br/>
that come with marriage and mothering when i realized that i could freely and <br/>
lovingly choose.<br/>
