I have been merrily deleting but am beginning to feel like the Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice.   The more I delete, the more appear. <br/>
Anyone know where the &quot;off&quot; switch is?<br/>

<br/>
I *finally* made my way back to the real world (where they have <br/>
computers and stuff) from the bush regions of Alaska, and found <br/>
out about this messy little interruption to the list. Wasn&#39;t me, <br/>
honest! I was waaaay out where the moose and the huskies <br/>
roam... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for dealing with it so quickly, Joyce. I still haven&#39;t talked <br/>
with Mark enough to know what on earth happened. I&#39;m not even <br/>
sure *he* knows. <br/>
<br/>
FYI, I&#39;ll be on no-mail for a few days, but will read whenever I can <br/>
get to a computer, like now. More later, or tomorrow. Or <br/>
sometime soon.<br/>
