<div id="ygrps-yiv-305165566">here&#39;s a question for y&#39;all..<br/>
<br/>
who out there unschools and doesn&#39;t have a tv at all in their house?<br/>
<br/>
since the birth of our first child, we&#39;ve had a tv.  we watched <br/>
moderately when she was young, but as time passed and finances <br/>
changed, we watched less and cut the cable (therefore, having much <br/>
less to watch.)  none of my kids have ever watched tv much, mostly <br/>
because there wasn&#39;t much, beyond saturday morning cartoons, that <br/>
appealed to them.  they watched game shows, martha stewart (liked her <br/>
crafty stuff and recipes), and reality tv stuff.  not every day and <br/>
not very much.  they also liked computer games,dvd&#39;s, and other stuff <br/>
on the computer, but spent most of the day playing freely, reading <br/>
stories with me, and joining in on my daily activities.  <br/>
<br/>
this summer, we lived for 3 months out in the woods with no <br/>
electricty, hence no tv.  they never got bored or whined for tv.  in <br/>
august, we moved back to town and were so sad to find that we got <br/>
absolutely no channels with our antenna (as opposed to the 3-4 we got <br/>
in before) and we didn&#39;t want to miss out on the olympics.  we ended <br/>
up finding a super cheap trial offer with a cable company, so we <br/>
decided we&#39;d go with it.<br/>
<br/>
the kids were delighted to find all the programming directed at them <br/>
and spent a ton of time watching, which was unusual for them.  it was <br/>
convenient for them to be occupied at first since we were so consumed <br/>
with the process of unpacking, but as days passed and we were more <br/>
settled, i started to worry and restrict them a bit.  i discovered <br/>
this list and started to critically examine why i was having such a <br/>
hard time accepting their new found hobby.  i figured they were <br/>
undoing all the damage i&#39;d done in restricting them and it was a <br/>
novelty that would fade with time and become a more balanced activity.<br/>
<br/>
fast forward a bit to current life (7-8 weeks later.)  the kids wake <br/>
up and watch tv immediately...there has been no exception to this, <br/>
not one day!  they continue to watch all day long and into the night, <br/>
falling asleep watching.  i try during the day to watch with them and <br/>
offer different activities that they&#39;ve adored in the past when they <br/>
seem restless, but not to much avail.  they don&#39;t want to go outside, <br/>
have a hard time recognizing hunger cues, argue and fight over <br/>
control of the station and/or remote, blow up if i suggest watching a <br/>
more adult show (even when i give them advance notice), etc.  my <br/>
oldest (6 1/2) expresses that she&#39;s sad she doesn&#39;t have anyone to <br/>
play with, but when i offer ideas (even the homeschool group <br/>
gatherings she&#39;s always enjoyed), she can&#39;t disconnect herself to go <br/>
without me turning the tv off.  she&#39;s also picked up a lot of mean <br/>
stuff from shows...calling names like *dummy* and making fun of her <br/>
brother when he makes a mistake.  she likes shows like rugrats where <br/>
there&#39;s a character that acts like that and finds it funny.  we talk <br/>
about why it&#39;s not nice, but it still comes out.  she&#39;s become even <br/>
more impulsive that way.  my middle child (4) is the one that <br/>
concerns me the most, though.  he won&#39;t leave the television to even <br/>
go to the bathroom.  he&#39;s afraid he&#39;ll miss something and i can&#39;t <br/>
*pause* the show.  i try to get him to go during commercials, but he <br/>
thinks they&#39;re fun too.  and he doesn&#39;t seem to communicate about <br/>
anything but what he saw on tv.  his attention span is so short that <br/>
he rudely interrupts me in the middle of a sentence saying, *so what?<br/>
* my youngest (2) seems oblivious to the hubbub.  she and i read <br/>
stories together, play with dollies and train sets, play hide and go <br/>
seek, wash dishes together, etc.  just like we all used to do.  it&#39;s <br/>
hard for me not to mourn this...i feel like i&#39;ve lost my kids in tv <br/>
world! <br/>
<br/>
i understand now that watching tv isn&#39;t terribly detrimental to all <br/>
kids, but i wonder how their behavior can be explained.  i&#39;ve had it <br/>
happen twice now that i&#39;ve gotten fed up and unplugged the tv.  to my <br/>
shock and surprise, the kids were instantly remarkably pleasant and <br/>
creative in what we should do.  we played for hours, baked stuff, <br/>
played games outside, they joyously helped out with chores like <br/>
hanging the wash, etc.  once i turned the tv off to go on an outing, <br/>
they were fine, but when i left them to their own devices and made <br/>
them aware of when we needed to go and offered help in getting ready, <br/>
they didn&#39;t move.  i got, *ok, mom.  in a minute.  oh, well...i wanna <br/>
watch one more show.*  when that show&#39;s done, they want just one <br/>
more, etc.  i&#39;m at a loss here.  i&#39;m trying to convince dh that this <br/>
change is so important for our family, but what&#39;s actually happening <br/>
is making me want to pull my hair out!  <br/>
<br/>
the same sort of thing is happening with letting go of the whole <br/>
concept of good food before bad food idea.  we&#39;re buying more junk <br/>
food than we ever have before, scarfing it, regretting we did, and <br/>
then wishing we had more money to buy more junk.  we&#39;ve always kind <br/>
of had it where we didn&#39;t buy sweets much, and if we had them, they <br/>
were to be kind of rationed out.  with the restraint gone, it&#39;s <br/>
almost like competetion...who can get to it the fastest kind of <br/>
thing.  i&#39;ve gained a bit of weight and am eating more of everything <br/>
with the stress of everything going on.  this certainly doesn&#39;t <br/>
help.  the kids are happy about being able to have what they want, <br/>
but are neglecting to make the accompanying good choices like they <br/>
used to.  i&#39;m very loose on what could be considered good food and am <br/>
looking over larger spans of time, but it&#39;s really not very good.  we <br/>
can&#39;t afford to present a ton of different options foodwise on our <br/>
very small budget, so i&#39;m starting to wonder what&#39;s going to happen <br/>
here.  my middle child is again the one i&#39;m most worrying <br/>
about...he&#39;s got food sensitivities to dairy and is now so covered in <br/>
eczema that he&#39;s uncomfortble and itching all the time.  when i talk <br/>
to him about why he&#39;s itchy, he understands, but when he has a chance <br/>
to eat it again, he disregards his reaction with statements like *i <br/>
like to be itchy.*  what the heck?<br/>
<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
so i&#39;m extrememly frustrated and wishing we could have had the sense <br/>
to start this at birth.  though that&#39;s not going to help us now.  can <br/>
anyone who&#39;s started out later in life relate to our experience.  am <br/>
i just being impatient?  i don&#39;t feel like i&#39;ve got unrealistic <br/>
expectations...i knew the kids would eat a lot of junk food and watch <br/>
a lot of tv for a while.  but i didn&#39;t think that would be pretty <br/>
much all they do.  all prejudice aside, this is certainly not <br/>
healthy.  is it a natural response to letting go of restrictions?  or <br/>
am i just going about all of this completely wrong?  or have i just <br/>
not waited long enough?<br/>
<br/>
in need of reassurance despite this not being a support group :)<br/>

If you record their favorite shows, then you can pause them.<br/>
<br/>
If you bring snacks, they don&#39;t need to &quot;recognize hunger cues.&quot;  (I&#39;m <br/>
guessing you meant by that that they don&#39;t turn the TV off to go and eat, but I <br/>
might be guessing wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers who don&#39;t allow TV, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
This list mentions SongeBob Squarepants right in its description, so this <br/>
isn&#39;t their best hangout, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Stick a tape in and say &quot;We can watch this one when we get back.&quot;  They might <br/>
not bother, but it gives them another option, another choice.<br/>

up finding a super cheap trial offer with a cable company, so we<br/>
decided we&#39;d go with it.**<br/>
<br/>
We started a teaser-priced satellite dish package exactly a year ago.  <br/>
(I remember my husband signed up for it during the baseball playoffs.)<br/>
<br/>
We had lived in a new house with fewer channels than we were used to for <br/>
9 months.  We had about 4 good channels and 4 fuzzy channels, and we had <br/>
been used to having more than that.   So we were feeling fairly deprived <br/>
of TV before we started.  I have one kid and two TVs.  Both of us <br/>
watched TV heavily for a couple of months.  He continued to seem <br/>
strongly interested in staying home and watching TV for about six <br/>
months.  (And I was pretty scared that he would be &quot;hooked&quot; forever.)  <br/>
Then the number of cartoons watched every day seemed to go down and I <br/>
noticed him being fairly selective about his choices.<br/>
<br/>
Because there are no siblings, the dynamics for agreeing what to watch <br/>
are different.  (Since my husband is only home two days a week, I mostly <br/>
defer to him and figure it&#39;s his &quot;turn&quot; when he&#39;s here.)  It may take <br/>
*longer* for your kids to absorb &quot;as much TV as they want&quot;, since they <br/>
do have to compete with each other over what show to watch.  But they <br/>
could get sick of TV sooner, if they are sitting there watching stuff <br/>
they don&#39;t like because someone else selected it.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a TiVo-like recorder that makes it very convenient to record <br/>
anything and watch it later.  I really like having this.  You can <br/>
apparently buy these at electronic stores, not just get them from the <br/>
cable company.  (This was a surprise to me.)<br/>

feelings to be talked to like that.  he doesn&#39;t want me to interrupt his<br/>
tv watching.  but there isn&#39;t a time when he&#39;s not engrossed.  even if he<br/>
is removed from the set, it seems to always be on his mind.  i can sort<br/>
of relate to this.  when i went back to school (com. college), i only<br/>
took classes that were intensely interesting to me, not in pursuit of a<br/>
degree.  each time i got into a new one, it was hard for me to exist<br/>
without somehow relating everything to my new passion.  still...it&#39;s<br/>
rude.  and hurtful.  i ask him to be mindful of his words, model nice<br/>
speaking, etc.  he doesn&#39;t seem to care.  it&#39;s distressing.<br/>

they&#39;ll forget about it sitting there until it&#39;s too cold or too crusty<br/>
or change their mind.  i offer to warm it up, but they just scrunch up<br/>
their noses or say they&#39;re not hungry.  the seem to get annoyed when i<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that&#39;s what was easier about watching dvd&#39;s and videos on vcr when we had<br/>
one.  they didn&#39;t get freaked out that it would just be gone.  they have<br/>
certain shows that they love and don&#39;t want to miss a single second.  but<br/>
even with shows that they don&#39;t particularly love, they&#39;ll still watch it<br/>
over much else.  my daughter keeps coming up with schemes of *i&#39;ll watch<br/>
tow more shows and then we&#39;ll turn it off.  i&#39;m getting sick of tv.*  but<br/>
the time comes, and her brother didn&#39;t make the agreement, so it stays on<br/>
and instead of moving on, she&#39;ll sit down again or try and muscle him<br/>
away from the tv.  she&#39;s gotten so impulsive lately and controlling about<br/>
it.  if she gets frustrated, she&#39;ll scream or hit or pinch..even her baby<br/>
sister who used to be of limits.  it&#39;s alarming.  i get in between them<br/>
immediately, but it doesn&#39;t seem to keep i from happening.  i can&#39;t<br/>
separate in my head if tis is really related to tv or something bigger. <br/>
i&#39;m just twisted in knots and all sorts of confused.<br/>

<br/>
Dh bought one for our computer called an All-in-Wonder. It works great, <br/>
and basically turns the computer into a tv with tivo device. He&#39;s been <br/>
recording all of the Teen Titans for the kids. And, he&#39;s just gotten a <br/>
DVD burner for the computer, so as soon as he installs it, we&#39;ll be able <br/>
to burn DVDs of all their favorite shows.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really great to have a techno-geek for a husband. I highly <br/>
recommend it. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you getting out of the house much?  Have you set up a game or set <br/>
out art supplies or playdoh before they wake up?  My children watch TV <br/>
daily - some days more some days less - but they almost never ask to go <br/>
home to watch TV if we&#39;re out doing something fun.  They haven&#39;t come <br/>
downstairs in the morning and bypassed the playdoh or paints to make a <br/>

known to take it away from them in the past.  They might be trying to <br/>
get all they can *now* before Mama takes it back again.  Once they&#39;re <br/>
*sure* that you&#39;re not going to unplug the television it may not hold <br/>
as much draw for them.  However, it may take quite a while for them to <br/>
finish making up for missed viewing AND to trust that you&#39;re not going <br/>
to unplug it again or go live without electricity any time soon.  <br/>
Expect that it will be this way again after your next extended visit to <br/>
your cabin and that it is OK.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>it wasn&#39;t a bummer for any of us.  we lived in a tent on our friend&#39;s<br/>
land with their family (including two kids) and it was a terrific<br/>
experience.  i don&#39;t think being removed from electricity is negative at<br/>
all.  in fact, it was a divine thing to be so in tune with ourselves and<br/>
nature.  the kids didn&#39;t whine at all.  even when we&#39;d come into town,<br/>

playing.<br/>

<br/>
yes.  but i think it&#39;s more about them never having access to kid<br/>
shows/cartoons before.  this stuff on cable&#39;s available 24/7.  before,<br/>
there were natural limits and it helped them regulate themselves.<br/>

prepared for just how much they would love it.  and how many extra<br/>
problems it was going to let loose in our daily lives.  i still think<br/>
it&#39;s unbalanced for anyone to wake up and go to sleep watching tv, with<br/>
not much of anything else going on in between.  especially when they&#39;re<br/>
able to articulate that they want to do something else, but can&#39;t pull<br/>
themselves away.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you getting out of the house much?  <br/>
<br/>

aggravating to hear over and over that they don&#39;t want to go.  i don&#39;t<br/>
know what to even suggest we go do anymore.  and i need some other social<br/>

thrive without a tv, computer, electricity or even running water &<br/>
plumbing.  and i&#39;m sure their children are happy competent people as<br/>
well.  i think it was a gift what we did this summer and only wish we<br/>
could extend the experience into our life now.  we had to come back to<br/>
town because of financial problems.  that is the bummer to me.<br/>

Visit to a counsellor costs more than that.<br/>

If you can buy peace and happiness for under $100 it might be worth doing.<br/>

If you were sending your kids to school you would have spent more than that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>i understand that utterly and completely.  still doesn&#39;t make it true<br/>
that i have that amount of money.  or that a vcr would solve all (or any)<br/>
of my problems.  i remember my husband saying that with the cable system<br/>
that we have and our tv being the one i bought for myself when i was in<br/>
6th grade (1991?), a vcr has nowhere to plug in, even if i had one,<br/>
because the technology has changed so much.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you can buy peace and happiness for under $100 it might be &gt;worth<br/>

<br/>
first of all, i don&#39;t think you can buy peace and happiness for any<br/>
amount...it&#39;s something that comes from inside a person regardless of<br/>
income.  secondly, my husband is a school bus driver and is going back to<br/>
school at the same time.  he gets paid around $250-$300 every two weeks. <br/>
our rent alone is $375/month.  these are the facts.  we live extremely<br/>
frugally.  i&#39;m pretty sure (unless things change dramatically between now<br/>
and a month from now) that we won&#39;t even be able to afford cable because<br/>
our trial period will be over (it&#39;s been around $8 for the first 2 mos.,<br/>
$30 something normally.)  i don&#39;t want to shelter or restrict them from<br/>
media, but i&#39;m not sure i have much of a choice.  we have a dvd player on<br/>
our computer that we use to watch stuff from the library and play games. <br/>
so it&#39;s not like they have nothing.<br/>

it&#39;s the tv more specifically.  i think we just need to sit together and<br/>
talk sometime when everyone&#39;s receptive and brainstorm some solutions to<br/>
these problems.  i think i&#39;m taking on more stress than i need to just<br/>
*because i&#39;m the mama and it&#39;s my job to make everything work*. my mom<br/>
was a huge codependant martyr and i&#39;ve taken her lead.  that&#39;s the bigger<br/>

back.)<br/>

&gt; then wishing we had more money to buy more junk.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when many of us describe not putting limits on kids food choices<br/>
we&#39;re picturing something different than what many people end up getting<br/>
from our words.<br/>
<br/>
Keep buying the food you think is healthy. Make the meals you think are<br/>
healthy. But ask the kids what they&#39;d like from the store and buy it. Don&#39;t<br/>
make your home a place where kids can open the cupboard and see every choice<br/>
in the grocery available! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The transition period after controls can be hard because kids will often<br/>
want everything that has been limited. And they may want a lot of it because<br/>
they feel insecure that it won&#39;t always be available.<br/>
<br/>
So, as Sandra often suggests, instead of removing the limits, just say yes<br/>
more often. So instead of saying or implying &quot;Buy anything and as much as<br/>
you want.&quot; Just say yes if they ask for something.<br/>
<br/>
I know *I* had problems bringing snacky food into the house. The way I kept<br/>
from eating it previously was by not buying it. So if I went to a party<br/>
where there were chips and candy and cookies, I&#39;d eat lots of whatever I<br/>
didn&#39;t let myself have at home. But once I turned my thinking around and<br/>
gave myself permission to buy and eat that kind of food, and told myself<br/>
that, yes, when that bag was done I could buy another bag or a dozen bags<br/>
more, I felt less desperate to finish it off and can actually pass it by if<br/>
it&#39;s sitting out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we&#39;ve always kind<br/>
&gt; of had it where we didn&#39;t buy sweets much, and if we had them, they<br/>
&gt; were to be kind of rationed out.  with the restraint gone, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; almost like competetion...who can get to it the fastest kind of<br/>
&gt; thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a reaction to rationing. And it happens not just to kids but to<br/>
adults. There are many adults who were affected by the rationing of WWII.<br/>
The fear is that despite how plentiful something is at the moment, that<br/>
there will come a time when it will become limited again so the best<br/>
strategy is to grab as much as possible while it&#39;s available.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true of TV too (and got covered pretty well in other people&#39;s<br/>
posts.)<br/>

That is interesting.  I run a business, and I often tell people, I&#39;m booked even when I take a weekend off here and there.  They want what they can&#39;t have, so they are likely to book sooner.  I will also pass it along to Scouts I know.<br/>
<br/>
Also, during our recent hurricanes, I found myself buying so much that we didn&#39;t need even if we were hit.  And lots of sweets and snack type foods.  Don&#39;t get me started on our soup surplus.  Then, after the storm, we would go to the store to replace everything we threw out and there was no dairy or cold food anywhere.  The other day, I bought two gallons of milk and extra yogurt.  Weird.  There is no current hurricane (yet) and no shortages now.  The sense of shortage does create a need.  Most people I&#39;ve talked to have done something similar.  The effects seem to last a while.  We are all stocking up on things, but don&#39;t really need to.<br/>

anticipate people will be hungry and if they aren&#39;t, i save it for them<br/>
for later.  it&#39;s just happening more and more now that they don&#39;t want<br/>
anything that&#39;s my idea.  including most meals.  regardless of whether or<br/>
not it&#39;s pretty much the only food we have.  i get *i don&#39;t like what you<br/>
made...can i have a plain tortilla?*  i let them have the tortilla and<br/>
they&#39;re hungry 10 minutes later, still not wanting their food. i made. <br/>
in looking at the grand scheme of things, they&#39;re choosing mostly junk. <br/>
it almost feels like now that i&#39;m allowing them to eat these foods that<br/>
used to be special or even not allowed, i must have changed my mind and<br/>
they do have some sort of nutritional value?  if i&#39;m not pushing the<br/>
*good stuff*, maybe it&#39;s not such a big deal?  but i do feel like it&#39;s a<br/>

<br/>

doesn&#39;t last.  which also brings up more stuff of mine...i want to make<br/>
it last.  but if they don&#39;t and are ok with it being gone, why should i<br/>

a good idea and i just happen to be bigger than them.  i can say yes a<br/>

i find this happening a lot and the kids not being able to recognize how<br/>
their acting out is related to their not having good lasting energy food.<br/>
 even if i point it out to them at that moment or later on and talk about<br/>
what seemed to have happened, they don&#39;t see it.  maybe it&#39;s hard for<br/>
them to keep their perspective too.  especially when they suspect i may<br/>
just change my mind again and stop allowing something.  but how do i<br/>
solve for them being grumpy and hungry then and not having anything left<br/>
to feed them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So instead of saying or implying &quot;Buy anything and as much as<br/>
&gt;you want.&quot; Just say yes if they ask for something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>everytime?  is it still restricting if i can only allow them a thing or<br/>
two beyond our normal meals?  we just can&#39;t afford a lot of snack-y type<br/>
foods that i would normally *approve of*, let alone sugary, candy-type<br/>
stuff.  that&#39;s reality for us and as the parent i feel like i do need to<br/>
prioritize healthy food for all of us with the little money we do have.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The way I kept<br/>
&gt;from eating it previously was by not buying it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is *so* me.  and then i went further to a reward system for<br/>
myself...if i washed the dishes, swept the floor, read three books to the<br/>
kids, and folded the laundry...i could have a bowl of ice cream, etc.  it<br/>
only felt natural to spread this thinking to my kids.  and my husband<br/>
too, really...i would nag him if he was eating more than his share.  it<br/>
only builds resentment.  i try to be more relaxed about everyone but me<br/>
now, but i&#39;m still feeling resentful if i don&#39;t (or someone else doesn&#39;t)<br/>
get something because someone else decided it was ok for them to take as<br/>
much as they wanted.  we can&#39;t just keep buying more and more and more<br/>
until all are satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So if I went to a party<br/>
&gt;where there were chips and candy and cookies, I&#39;d eat lots of &gt;whatever<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;didn&#39;t let myself have at home. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me too.  and i preferred this way of going about it because i knew i<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be unhealthy for gorging myself just every once in a while.  if<br/>
i have the food around regularly, i do have problems.  i feel like it<br/>
calls to me.  and it rarely goes for more than a day (regardless of the<br/>
quantity.)  i just eat it til it&#39;s gone.  a lot of this depends on our<br/>
family activity level (which is currently very low-nonexistent now that<br/>
the tv&#39;s come to be), my own social life (which is currently<br/>
nonexistent), and my level of depression (which is currently high.)  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But once I turned my thinking around and<br/>
&gt;gave myself permission to buy and eat that kind of food, and &gt;told<br/>
 </span></blockquote>myself<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that, yes, when that bag was done I could buy another bag or a &gt;dozen<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bags<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;more, I felt less desperate to finish it off and can actually &gt;pass it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>by if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;it&#39;s sitting out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>see, this is the part that doesn&#39;t work for me.  i&#39;ve pretty much always<br/>
had body image problems and am very hard on myself as far as my weight<br/>
goes.  giving myself permission to eat food that i know isn&#39;t good for me<br/>
only makes me feel guilty and bad.  i&#39;m less worried about it being gone<br/>
soon...more worried about what it&#39;s going to do to me.  i feel bad,<br/>
eating forbidden fruit feels good, so i eat more...then feel worse and<br/>
eat more.  and the cycle of guilt continues.  i sneak when my kids aren&#39;t<br/>
around and i guess it worries me to see them eating with abandon because<br/>
i have so many issues with this sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The fear is that despite how plentiful something is at the &gt;moment, that<br/>
&gt;there will come a time when it will become limited again so &gt;the best<br/>
&gt;strategy is to grab as much as possible while it&#39;s available.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with my kids it seems like that...with the added element that they don&#39;t<br/>
understand how long its going to be until they get more (what is a week<br/>
to a small child?)and they don&#39;t understand how icky it makes them feel<br/>
(or they forget from the last time, or choose to disregard it in favor of<br/>
it tasting good temporarily.)  i just have to trust that eventually, if<br/>
they can get through the crap restrictions they&#39;ve had since they were<br/>
born, that some of this will make sense. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
thanks for all of the clarifications! :)  i keep finding out more and<br/>
more that much of my *problems* are just that...mine.  and that&#39;s a<br/>
bitter pill to swallow!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610201464">thanks barbara,<br/>
<br/>
&#39;tis a nice thought. :)  unfortunately, no one who buys us gifts (three<br/>
out of four grandparents) likes suggestions.  MIL suggests i do too much<br/>
thinking when it comes to buying gifts for people (especially the<br/>
kids)...she says she would just buy something and if the kids didn&#39;t like<br/>
it, they were ungrateful.  ugh.  my mom usually buys things we need like<br/>
winter coats/boots/clothes plus a little something extra.  maybe i&#39;ll<br/>
give it a shot if things get desperate enough...or maybe we&#39;ll try to<br/>
find another way.  <br/>
<br/>
the kids are now starting to ask for outside of the house activities<br/>
(like ballet lessons and a learning to swim class) that cost money as<br/>
well, so something&#39;s got to give.  i don&#39;t have a preference either way<br/>
really.  i&#39;d be sad to have absolutely no television (though i&#39;d secretly<br/>
feel relieved to be missing the unending cartoon noise in the house), but<br/>
i&#39;d also be adopting difficulty in trying to get everyone back into the<br/>
*we-have-be-to-the-lesson-in-time-or-it&#39;ll-be-over-before-we-get-there*<br/>
mode even if it made me happy to see my kids having fun (if they actually<br/>
enjoyed it.) <br/>
<br/>
sometimes i get frustrated trying to figure out when the kids are serious<br/>
about something or not.  and with money being so tight, i have a hard<br/>
time not being resentful of missed lessons/classes with the reason being<br/>
*because i don&#39;t feel like it today*.  heck, i don&#39;t like them missing<br/>
due to genuine illness.  it just feels so out of balance.  i&#39;ve never<br/>
forced the kids to go to something if they didn&#39;t want to, but i can&#39;t<br/>
help thinking perhaps we should have just skipped the whole thing<br/>
altogether, with all the hubbub that comes along with it.  this is<br/>
happening even with our homeschool group get togethers recently.  it<br/>
costs $5 or so each week we get together, plus it&#39;s kinda far and then<br/>
there&#39;s gas to pay for which ain&#39;t cheap and i have to make other<br/>
arrangements for dh to get to school and work.  *sigh*  i just wish i<br/>
could give more freely and not have to worry so much about *the bottom<br/>
line*.<br/>
<br/>
and i know the kids don&#39;t get the *we can&#39;t afford it* stuff.  and even<br/>
if they do...sometimes it still hurts.  but what can we do?  stuff costs<br/>
money.  we don&#39;t have much money.  therefore, we have to limit stuff. <br/>
and it&#39;s not like my husband and i are constantly buying things for<br/>
ourselves...in fact, my shoes are split all along the bottom seam on one<br/>
side and i&#39;m still wearing the same clothes that i bought *vintage* when<br/>
i was 15-17 (i&#39;m now 25).  i sacrifice a lot of material stuff, even what<br/>
most would consider essentials, to provide for my kids.  i just can&#39;t do<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
longing for simpler *cheaper* days that don&#39;t seem in the cards...maybe i<br/>
should allow a little more transition time for myself?<br/>
<br/>
attending a solo pity party this morning...maybe because it&#39;s grey<br/>
outside.  always seems to turn me into *eeyore mode* ;)<br/>

I asked friends if they could record shows they were going to watch<br/>

friends or family would rent a movie they&#39;d drop it by our house after<br/>
they were finished with it and we&#39;d watch it and return it. <br/>

Maybe you could very gently talk to the people that you get gifts <br/>
from, and tell them that there are some things that the kids really <br/>
want to do that you really can&#39;t afford, and what the kids and you <br/>
really really want and even need, is for them to help out in that <br/>
direction. Also, you could mention that if they are paying for a set <br/>
of lessons, that it is going to be something that the kids are <br/>
genuinely thankful for way past Christmas.<br/>
Here is what happened with us...<br/>
 Last year, we were moving over christmas, and I didn&#39;t want to lug <br/>
boxes of stuff from Texas to Georgia. I asked the people that <br/>
normally give us stuff that they buy, (some of our family does <br/>
homemade gifts, which we all love.) to please, please, find another <br/>
way of giving the kids the things that they wanted to give. My best <br/>
friend&#39;s mom and my parents and my sister did a walmart gift card, <br/>
with a photo of what they wanted the kids to buy. They saved on <br/>
postage big time, and we ended up getting even more stuff for the <br/>
cash they spent since we were able to get it at the after christmas <br/>
sales. Also, I didn&#39;t have to lug boxes of stuff halfway across the <br/>
country with the cat, the dog, two kids, my dh, and all of our <br/>
luggage. LOL I expected some resistance to the idea, but it seems to <br/>
have caught on, and two of the three are doing the same thing again <br/>
this year. :)<br/>
