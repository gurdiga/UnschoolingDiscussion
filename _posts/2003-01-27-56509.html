Why don&#39;t you use some proper etiquette on your emails,<br/>
I consider your use of wording here a slam, if you need<br/>
to ask me what I meant than do so!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not proper etiquette to tell people how to post.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s be the way we want other to.<br/>
<br/>
If people  need to ask what you  meant, you weren&#39;t clear the first time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, and understand the commands of their mothers.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you meant to say it another way, clarify.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Command&quot; isn&#39;t going to go over well on an unschooling list.  It&#39;s not <br/>
personal.  It&#39;s about commanding.<br/>

<br/>
You might want to take the suggestion in the intro letter and read for a<br/>
couple of weeks to see if the tone of this list suits your needs.<br/>

Excuse me??? Surely you jest. There was no slam and no need for me to ask <br/>
what you meant. I know what command means and was just wincing at the <br/>
thought that you used it on this list.<br/>

I was thinking about this earlier.. Your situation with your children and how <br/>
similar it it to mine.. Well, not ALL that similar because your 3 younger <br/>
children have never been to school and mine have.. But, the <br/>
oldest-kid-still-in-school part.   And what you said above, about Tara, is  <br/>
exactly the same for Landon in our family.  Can you please refresh my memory <br/>
and tell me how old your younger children are?<br/>

Tara just turned 17, Joseph is 8, Sierra is 7 and Alyssa is 2.5.<br/>
<br/>
It was because of Tara going to school and going through what she did that<br/>
brought us to the homeschooling decision sooner than I think if Joseph was<br/>
our first child. Poor Tara. I still call her our experimental child! (this<br/>
is in jest) I&#39;m just so very glad that she was able to manage things as she<br/>
did and come out on top like she has. She&#39;s an incredible daughter!<br/>

has made him stronger and smarter.   I hate that he had to go through it, <br/>
but, he says there are very few things he would have changed.    I think <br/>
thats why he thinks I &quot;wimped out&quot; and took the kids out of school.  He feels <br/>
like.. HEY,I had it tough, and I turned out fine and dandy.  I just try to <br/>
remind him that Ethan is not like him.  He is a different person and it&#39;s <br/>
pretty much a gamble on how Ethan would react to the same kinds of things <br/>
that Landon dealt with.   I am not willing to take that risk.  I would rather <br/>
be sure that Ethan ( and JP) are NOT going to  have to go through all of that <br/>
crap.<br/>

Tara doesn&#39;t really get the whole homeschooling thing either. I mean she<br/>
sees for herself the learning part, but for her, it&#39;s the whole<br/>
socialization question. I guess she has also helped us answer questions that<br/>
most people who don&#39;t know enough about homeschooling do ask. That forever S<br/>
word. Then again, like so many other people, when that&#39;s all they know it&#39;s<br/>
hard to see another way.<br/>
<br/>
Tara has made strides in her thinking about what we do though. She has<br/>
mentioned recently about the kids and their little friends and their groups<br/>
and what they do and who with. She thinks it&#39;s so cute. I guess it was just<br/>
so hard for her to understand how a kid could have friends without going to<br/>
school!!!<br/>

homeschooling, Anna hasn&#39;t really made any friends..  But the other day, <br/>
Landon made a comment in response to Anna wanting to keep one of our new <br/>
puppies &#39;for her very own&quot;.. He said.. &quot;Well, she is a shut-in homeschooler, <br/>
she has plenty of time to take care of a puppy&quot;   I was like. &quot;WHAT?? a <br/>
shut-in?? a SHUT-IN??  .. He was just trying to make some kind of overt point <br/>
about her lack of homeschooled friends.  Anna is a very busy girl.  She is <br/>
FAR from a shut-in.  It&#39;s just that the things she does don&#39;t include other <br/>
kids her age  We are still hanging in there and looking for opportunities for <br/>
her to meet some homeschool friends.   She has decided to stay home next <br/>
school year too, so she must not be too distressed over not having any <br/>
friends ( yet)<br/>
