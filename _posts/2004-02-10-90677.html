Just dropping in to see who&#39;s here and say hi. :)<br/>
<br/>
We moved in January, and that kept me very busy, and now we&#39;re in a <br/>
city, where there is much MUCH more to do, which is keeping us busy.<br/>
<br/>
Robby is still The Game King. He got a playstation from his older <br/>
brother, and has been doing a LOT of that, but I must admit, you guys <br/>
were right: He&#39;s doing lots of other things, too.<br/>
<br/>
There is a playhouse within walking distance of us, and Abbie has <br/>
been making the acquaintance of the people there. She went to a play, <br/>
and introduced herself to the director, and found out about acting <br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
And Katie, my late-starting reader!!! yeee-haw! Started a diary <br/>
yesterday. LOL I let her write things out her own self, and let me <br/>
tell YOU...between spelling things completely by how they sound, and <br/>
the dyslexic tendency to reverse b&#39;s and d&#39;s...I couldn&#39;t really read <br/>
what she wrote, until she decoded it for me. BUT...this is SO reading-<br/>
ready. And, she&#39;s been climbing on my lap lately, books in hand, and <br/>
eagerly attempting to read the words as well as look at the pictures. <br/>
I think she will be reading well, before her next birthday. IF I can <br/>
keep my mom from stressing her out about it...grrr...&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we <br/>
get her in Sylvan? She&#39;s reading awfully late, isn&#39;t she?&quot; grrrr.<br/>
<br/>
As for me and my hubby, we&#39;re more energetic. Feeling like we&#39;ve <br/>
busted out of a rut big time, and loving it!<br/>
<br/>
nice &quot;seeing&quot; youse again!<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC</div>
