Well, you&#39;ll be doing a lot of reading in your search of murals and you&#39;ll <br/>
have to figure out how much paint to buy along with other materials.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you really won&#39;t be able to avoid learning something!    The beauty <br/>
of hsing -- un or not!<br/>

walls painted a particular color -- but they did get done -- and the kids <br/>
picked the colors and helped a little the first day -- and learned how to <br/>
wash paint off of things -- when you touch a door covered with wet bright <br/>

&lt;&lt; Art is easy-I can pull out pictures of ancient murals to get ideas. We can<br/>
 also have fun with painting techniques, color spectrum and such like. But<br/>
 what about math and language arts attuned to a 7 year old?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might have your child write about the house remoldeling experiences, as <br/>
in a journal; his favorite and least favorite likes about having work done in <br/>
the house.  You can use household words as spelling words, too.  You could <br/>
spell your house, room by room!  You can relate math skills by letting him <br/>
learn how to measure rooms, furniture pieces, etc...let him select household <br/>
items from catlogs and record prices, then figure the cost of items per room. <br/>
 Let him learn how to figure how many gallons of paint it may take to paint a <br/>
room;  and how much wallpaper it will take to cover the walls.  Maybe he can <br/>
design some ideas for his room, too, and sketch them on paper, then add a <br/>
written explanation about his ideas.  Hope this helps-- I love art, too, and <br/>
would like to hear about your mural on the ceiling idea!!  ~Karen</div>

&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gracious!  My immediate thought was what a great way to teach math.  These <br/>
are just off the top of my head:  How much paint do we need?  How many <br/>
colors?  What shapes are the areas of wall/floor/ceiling we are covering?  <br/>
How do they all fit together?   Show how to figure out the area.  (even if 7 <br/>
yr old doesn&#39;t understand the multiplication concept, he/she can see how the <br/>
puzzle goes together).  Maybe use tangrams or diagrams to show how it will <br/>
all look when you are finished.  Perhaps make a scale model of the rooms you <br/>
are doing.  Show how to use a scale ruler (one side shows inches, other side <br/>
different scale).  Measure the rooms/walls/ceilings.  You&#39;re going to need <br/>
that information in order to get the pain anyway...have that 7 yr old holding <br/>
and reading the tape measure.<br/>
<br/>
How long did it take us to cover x amount of wall space?  How long will it <br/>
take to cover all walls?  What is cost per gallon?  Cost for entire project?  <br/>
Let 7 yr old help pay for materials and count back change.  (if that&#39;s too <br/>
much hassle at the store, replay the scene at home while encouraging 7 yr old <br/>
to direct the scene...it will tell you volumes about how much he/she <br/>
understands and give you a chance to teach/correct any misunderstandings).<br/>
<br/>
Language arts gets covered by talking while you work!  Doesn&#39;t get any <br/>
simpler than that.<br/>
<br/>
Now, getting the job done...yikes!  Sounds like quite a project.  Working <br/>
&#39;school&#39; into that.  It&#39;s gonna be a piece of cake.  You&#39;ll have a harder <br/>
time recognizing that you&#39;ve covered &#39;school&#39; subjects at first.  It&#39;ll come <br/>
to you, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You will be using measurements to accomplish these jobs, that right there is <br/>
a perfect math lesson for a 7 yo.   Liquid measure (both American and Metric) <br/>
with paints, and space measurements with rulers, yard sticks, and tape <br/>
measures.  You could also work fractions into this.  <br/>
