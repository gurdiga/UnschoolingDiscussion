<br/>
We have the same thing happen here all the time. A couple of months ago, we <br/>
had some witnesses knock on the door just as Kass, Kree and I were brushing our <br/>
teeth. We were getting ready to head out and my garage was open, since we had <br/>
just packed the car for a park day. I answered the door with toothbrush in <br/>
mouth thinking it was a neighbor. Wrong, it was someone arriving to &quot;save&quot; my <br/>
heathen soul. LOL<br/>
<br/>
The twins came to the door to see who I could be yapping with, especially <br/>
about God, the bible and Christ. They said, &quot;mom we have to go...&quot; they thought <br/>
they were rescuing me. Then I turned around and gave them the grin. They both <br/>
looked at each other and sighed heavily. Kass looked at Kree and said, &quot;Oh man <br/>
this dude should have never knocked on our door, mom&#39;s gonna debate him.&quot; All <br/>
this in front of the &quot;witness&quot;. He said, &quot;Oh you have children, do you <br/>
homeschool them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No, we don&#39;t do school at all.&quot; He just stood there staring at me. Then he <br/>
went into his spiel about did I know God - the Jehovah, to which I replied, <br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve heard of him, but  he awfully angry at his children, so I pray to both God <br/>
and Goddess, because they are loving creators who hope I learn my lessons this <br/>
time around, either way though, they aren&#39;t gonna be pissed at me and banish <br/>
me away for all eternity.&quot; ROFLMAO<br/>
<br/>
I thought he was gonna faint then and there. So we debated my statement for a <br/>
few minutes and by this time he thought if he pulled out his bible he could <br/>
one up me.  So I had the girls retreive a couple of bibles from my personal <br/>
library, to which he was astonished I could produce. I laughed and said, &quot;I&#39;m a <br/>
well read heathen. Have you ever read the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying?&quot; He <br/>
was a black man turning white before my eyes. He went on about idol worship <br/>
and I went back to, &quot;Why is your God so egotisical?&quot; By this time the twins <br/>
were just shaking their heads and once more said, &quot;Mom, we&#39;re gonna be late.&quot; <br/>
This time the man was thankful, for it was his exit clue and he was more than <br/>
willing to take it this time. <br/>
<br/>
He left saying he was sure I was a good mom but that he would pray for my <br/>
soul. I told him, &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time, pray for someone who really needs it! <br/>
Have a nice day.&quot; I closed the door and the three of us laughed til we cried, <br/>
then went to parkday.<br/>
<br/>
Then on Easter morning, I opened my garage to pack my car and found a couple, <br/>
standing at my driveway, praying. I just stood there til they opened their <br/>
eyes and then I started laughing. They asked if I was &quot;saved&quot;. To which I <br/>
laughed harder. I said politely though, &quot;No thank you, but could you move off my <br/>
driveway, cuz my heathen hubby will run you over, Easter or not.&quot; Jaws dropped <br/>
and they moved swiftly. My hubby walked out and I was still laughing. He asked <br/>
what was so funny and I pointed to the neighbors driveway. He walked out of the <br/>
garage and looked and down my street, stood about 6 couples at various <br/>
driveways. His jaw dropped and he asked, &quot;You are gonna sage before we leave right?&quot; <br/>
He meant smudge, but the fact he even remembered sage was enough for me to <br/>
grin. I said, &quot;No need honey, they meant no harm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I tell these stories not to belittle whatever anyone&#39;s faith may be, <br/>
but that when you come knockin on our door, the dialogue goes both ways. Most <br/>
often, we&#39;re more then they bargained for.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who can&#39;t think of a good sig line, cuz she&#39;s still laughing about <br/>
stories above.<br/>

involves the jaw joints, so I am constantly being told to stop talking so much!!! <br/>
Yeah, sure, OK doc, whatever you say...just today I was reminiscing with my mom <br/>
how I never in my schooled life got anything but an U (unsatisfactory) grade <br/>
in &quot;citizenship&quot;. The comments on my report card always read: Talks too much in <br/>
class. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m the same way in real life as well when I&#39;m comfortable around <br/>
someone. I&#39;m most times quiet on lists to try to keep my foot out of <br/>
my mouth most times.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that like when your jaw pops. I have that {can make it pop and <br/>
it pops sometimes on it&#39;s on} but it has never caused me much pain <br/>
{in most cases}to have anything done about it. Am thinking the <br/>
acronym was TMJ, is that the same. Really haven&#39;t needed to reserch <br/>
it tho as of yet.<br/>
