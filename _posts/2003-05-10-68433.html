<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Definitely &quot;teacher talk.&quot;  Although, many teachers I know do not engage in<br/>
&gt; this type of speak...s-i-l seems to have mastered it!  I am typically left<br/>
&gt; aghast<br/>
&gt; at her comments, not quite sure how to respond to her baited words...in front<br/>
&gt; of extended family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which can be good...it seems to throw her off when I don&#39;t respond, as if she<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; hoping for a juicy argument.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve said this before here, but often I dodge my mother&#39;s arguements by the<br/>
non sequitor reply.  She makes comments about what Tim is missing in school,<br/>
and I chatter about how well he&#39;s doing in a whole different area -- soccer,<br/>
cub scouts, dance, etc.  When she&#39;s talking about school, I do NOT mention<br/>
the things he does do at the school, like his &quot;library class&quot; or chess club.<br/>
I save those for complaints about his eating.  And so on.<br/>
<br/>
We have really wierd conversations, but hey, it&#39;s less painful than the<br/>
fights!<br/>
