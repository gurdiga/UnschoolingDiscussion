<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830455502">&lt;&lt;After watching the 3rd one this weekend I conceded that the 2nd one wasn&#39;t <br/>
all<br/>
that bad after all.  LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why but this made me crack up...and loud!!!  We haven&#39;t seen <br/>
the last one but my kids are DYING to see it.  My Nicholette thinks Beyonce <br/>
is IT in Goldmember!  LOL  She has always loved black baby dolls and told me <br/>
today that she wishes she were black, like Beyonce, even though they are <br/>
really brown, and why DO they call them black when they are brown, and why <br/>
are we white if we are peach and how come Mexican people are brown but we <br/>
don&#39;t call them brown, we call them Mexican or Tino&#39;s (her version of <br/>
Latino) and why is Gramma black but we are white? ROFL! (My grandmother is <br/>
white but her skin is very dark brown and she has the standard old lady <br/>
afro.  Even my great grandfather, who was driving us around, was laughing!<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, we were in line in the grocery store and Caeleb was very <br/>
intently watching a black woman in front of us.  My first thought was that <br/>
he was aware that she was black because I remember when Ethan figured out <br/>
that some people don&#39;t &quot;look&quot; like us.  He thought the man he saw was <br/>
&#39;burned like a cookie&#39;.  The man laughed so hard he was crying and hugged <br/>
Ethan. :)  I digress.  So, Caeleb is watching this woman and suddenly yells, <br/>
GRAMMA!!  and lunged into her arms!  She held him and nervously asked me why <br/>
he thought she was his Grandmother. I explained that she looked just like <br/>
his Gramma and then she asked me if his Gramma was black &quot;cause those babies <br/>
are white as a Klenex!&quot;  ROFL!<br/>
<br/>
Boy, here I go again, off on a tangent!  I just love how their little brains <br/>
work!<br/>

One day my nephews were over and I don&#39;t remember how it came up in <br/>
conversation, but they referred to themselves as white.  She looked <br/>
at them like they must have been toddlers not to know their colors <br/>

ORANGE.&quot;  They laughed at her.  She just looked at them like they <br/>
were nuts.<br/>

sex and ethnicity. She said 11 f, mixed. That got a tons of questions in the <br/>
chat and since my kids have never had any issues with being mixed she was <br/>
shocked at the amount of horrible things that were said after that. She turned <br/>
around and said, &quot;Mom, these people are so lame they aren&#39;t worthy of knowing <br/>
which races we are.&quot; I said &quot;Can you think of an answer that doesn&#39;t include fuck <br/>
you in it, (my kids are allowed to use whatever verbiage they feel the need to <br/>
as long as it&#39;s used in the right context, maybe that&#39;s for another thread <br/>
though) so the cyber police don&#39;t revoke your chat priviledges?&quot; She thought for <br/>
a few seconds and simply typed....Human race. I was pretty proud of her for <br/>
that one. She then exited the chat and went about her day. I would have been <br/>
fine had she used my first thought of F**K you, but I was glad she voiced to me <br/>
her disgruntledness at the things she was reading. And just taking a second to <br/>
think it out, she came up with a much better answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-973712555"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; She has always loved black baby dolls <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a friend who took her daughter to Wal-Mart to buy Barbie <br/>
dollhouse furniture.  While there, the daughter (a very fair-skinned <br/>
blond girl) saw a &quot;black&quot; Barbie family and asked if she could get <br/>
those.  The mom felt a little funny about it, so she just said that <br/>
they were there to buy furniture.  <br/>
<br/>
The daughter looked around a little more, but wouldn&#39;t choose <br/>
anything.  The mom asked why she didn&#39;t want anything and she <br/>
said, &quot;I wanted the pretty people, mommy, but you said I couldn&#39;t <br/>
have them.&quot;  Needless to say, she got to buy the pretty people.  <br/>
(This was a pastor&#39;s wife, so she felt ashamed of herself anyway, on <br/>
top of the beautiful wisdom of her child.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My in laws are very color/religious/nationality/gender/sexual preference<br/>
conscious. Tara&#39;s family is too. My mom will specify when talking about<br/>
someone she met or someone in public as to whether they are hispanic or<br/>
black or jewish, anything but just &quot;white.&quot; With the way we are here, (and<br/>
me calling her on it &lt;BEG&gt;) she&#39;s not so bad anymore. Joe and I are in no<br/>
way like that. My kids don&#39;t get that any of those things makes a difference<br/>
at all to us. We&#39;ve never mentioned someone being black or white or brown.<br/>
<br/>
So one day at the park, Joseph is telling me about something that happened<br/>
there. He&#39;s about 4 and mentions the black man over there. I was quite taken<br/>
aback by the term. I asked him to repeat it and again it was the black man.<br/>
So I&#39;m looking and see no such person. He pointed him out to me and it was a<br/>
man wearing all black. He also happened to be with the purple lady!!!!! They<br/>
go by the color of top you are wearing. Even now at 7 and 8, Sierra and<br/>
Joseph still do that when needing to point someone out. It&#39;s cute and very<br/>
appropriate. Alyssa has started doing it now too. I love that!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt;Honestly, I am shocked that my daughter has not picked it up yet.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never pointed that out to my kids. But they have heard it and wondered<br/>
what it meant. I don&#39;t remember how, maybe on TV but I do remembe both<br/>
Joseph and Sierra coming to me one day asking what it meant when people were<br/>
black or white. So I explained, which didn&#39;t make sense to them because they<br/>
never saw anyone who WAS actually black or white. We talked about skin color<br/>
and some other ways of referring to people. They think it&#39;s silly to label<br/>
people by body. Makes more sense to do so by their shirts!!! Sometimes when<br/>
they are trying to explain someone that I&#39;m just not seeing, like a kid from<br/>
camp or something, they go through clothes color, (which doesn&#39;t help me<br/>
any) hair color, eye color, tall or short and them possibly skin color. But<br/>
it&#39;s a science as they try to get so exact. Not exactly brown but kind of<br/>
tan but darker or not peach but lighter but not cream. It&#39;s real tough!!!<br/>
That doesn&#39;t happen often at all though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Doesn&#39;t come up much here though it does sometimes. And we have had <br/>
to say things to some family members.<br/>
The latest was the other day with my middle child. We were in a <br/>
ethnic beauty supply store, {a bit different then Sally&#39;s} to get <br/>
some more purple color they had been asking for.<br/>
We she did notice the difference and started asking questions. <br/>
Nothing major and I answered about the difference in caucasion hair <br/>
and ethnic hair. Even had the customers joining in. LOL She asked <br/>
about all the hair on the walls and I answered and told her about <br/>
different hairstyles and how ethnic hair grows ... No biggie she just <br/>
wants to know about everything.<br/>
I have always bought ethnic dolls and barbies right along with the <br/>
others they get and at first got strange looks or comments from <br/>
family. Eventually they stopped because they have learned we are <br/>
going to do what we want, not what everyone else does.<br/>
Right now their favorite is the &quot;BRATS&quot; dolls. They have had them <br/>
since they started being produced{well when they first saw them}, <br/>
tho, I think now they are cool to have. They just liked the clothes <br/>
and liked the different skin colors. They also like the Lisa Frank <br/>
dolls with the orange, bright yellow, and purple hair.<br/>

I agree. My oldest is 8, and still doesn&#39;t know those labels. A couple of <br/>
weeks ago, my daughter, 5, wanted me to see the pretty dress a lady was wearing, <br/>
and said it was the lady with the pretty dark skin, just the same as she&#39;s <br/>
before said pretty light (as in blond) hair, or pretty green shoes.     <br/>

Oh I had comments from my first set of in laws when Tara started getting<br/>
Barbie&#39;s of color. That family was actually worse than the in laws now. Tara<br/>
still gets upset with them and when Tara had a boyfriend of color, man was<br/>
that just nuts with them. Anyway, all the Barbie&#39;s were handed down to the<br/>
kids now and with them, it&#39;s just something they have taken for granted. How<br/>
very different we all are. Joseph has made the remark about how all of us<br/>
are a different color too. Luckily we live in a very diverse neighborhood. I<br/>
purposefully looked for that when we were house hunting. So to them, every<br/>
day is real life.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a very all white non ethnic small town neighborhood. Like 5<br/>
kids of color in my whole school. One jewish kid. No asian or hispanic<br/>
people at all. All afluent and catholic. Moved to downtown Miami when I was<br/>
18. Talk about culture shock!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
We did really well at it, somehow.   Two things I&#39;ve consciously not had here <br/>
(and one my husband just mentioned the other day, and I said no, they can <br/>
discover it later on their own):  Roots and Blazing Saddles.  I grew up with <br/>
ignorant Texas relatives who used &quot;the &#39;n&#39; word&quot; but my kids had not heard it.   <br/>
They described people by skin color.  &quot;Not as dark as LeVar Burton,&quot; I think it <br/>
was once, and I didn&#39;t &quot;correct&quot; that, I took it as the informational phrase <br/>
it was.   One of Holly&#39;s best friends now is African American and so some <br/>
questions have come up.   It&#39;s a need to know situation, just as with all the best <br/>
learning.  By the time my kids were old enough to be analytical, they were <br/>
appalled at the idea that within the lifetimes of people now living that <br/>
segregation was legal.  They think it&#39;s crazy.  That&#39;s good.   They choose their <br/>
friends and casual conversations by indications other than color and age.  They go <br/>
by who seems friendly or who&#39;s interested in what they&#39;re interested in.  <br/>
That&#39;s good.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby did that once.  My friend Jeff, who now has two boys of his own, <br/>
reminded me.<br/>
<br/>
We had gotten the video of Spike Lee Does it ACAPELLA, and Kirby, who was <br/>
four or five, was showing Jeff one of his favorite parts.  Kirby said he really <br/>
liked the bass, and Jeff said &quot;The black guy?&quot;  Kirby looked at him curiously.  <br/>
I was standing behind Kirby motioning to Jeff to waive off.  Jeff looked at <br/>
ME curiously.  Kirby said &quot;You mean the guy in the black jacket?&quot;  Jeff <br/>
identified the guy by jacket color (I don&#39;t remember that part now) and Kirby <br/>
continued to tell him what was cool about that song.<br/>
<br/>
Later Jeff said WHAT?  And I said &quot;He doesn&#39;t know the term &#39;black&#39; as <br/>
applied to people.&quot;<br/>
WHY?<br/>
And I told him I thought it was the best I could do toward helping him REALLY <br/>
see people as individuals.<br/>
<br/>
I was also not identifying groups of &quot;subjects,&quot; like math, science and <br/>
history.  That lasted many years too.  And it helped a lot in my seeing that their <br/>
learning was both more homogenous and more granulated (hard to describe what I <br/>
mean) than if they were identifying academic areas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We did the opposite...I grew up in Long Beach CA,  and before moving here, <br/>
lived in a very mixed neighborhood in Los Angeles County.  We moved here to a <br/>
tiny town in West Virginia, and THAT was the biggest culture shock I&#39;ve ever <br/>
had.  There are exactly 3 AA kids in the entire high school.  None in our foster <br/>
son&#39;s elementary school. <br/>
<br/>
Hardest though was getting used to the small town life compared to city life. <br/>
We got so tired of being asked WHY we moved here my husband joked with some <br/>
people up at the local store that it&#39;d be easier to tell people we&#39;re in the <br/>
witness protection program.  <br/>
<br/>
2 weeks later my daughter&#39;s friend was not allowed to come to our house... <br/>
Rumors fly fast here.  I had to convince daughter&#39;s friend&#39;s family that my <br/>
husband was joking....<br/>
