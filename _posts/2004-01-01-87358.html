My 6 year old son loved his.  He got it when he was 4 for Christmas, and played with it for spurts nonstop, then would get bored with it and not play with it at all.  When he would get a new book for it, then it would be back to playing with it all the time.  We have recently started unschooling, as opposed to school at home.  I did not use it as an educational tool, just gave him the books and worksheets, and let him play with it as he wanted, and helped him when he asked for it.  As of now, he is done with it and we are getting rid it and all the books.  He has decided that he does not want it anymore, and will not play with it again.  When it got to the books that he had to read, the ones that the system does not read for you, he was done with it.  So, off it will go!!<br/>

I have one son that loved it, and the other couldn&#39;t care less.  The one that loved it is more of a &#39;sitter and thinker&#39;, and his brother is more of a &#39;on the go&#39; kinda guy.  lol.  <br/>

If you do a search for &quot;leappad reviews&quot; on google, you&#39;ll get tons of sites to read.<br/>

Like pretty much everything else, it is all in how the parents deal with<br/>
them I think.  If it is for goofing around with, great....If it is for<br/>
teaching, not so great.<br/>
<br/>
My kids love them.  The big kids learned a lot of geography playing the map<br/>
games....the little kids like to make them say the same word over and over<br/>
&quot;glochenschpiel&quot; (sp?) is a big favorite.  But at our house, they are a toy<br/>
like any other toy.  Play with it if you want, don&#39;t if you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
At a friend&#39;s house, her husband is using it to &quot;teach&quot; their 3 yo.  The<br/>
child is only allowed to use it with the father sitting right there with<br/>
him, the father shows him the &quot;correct&quot; way to play with it, etc..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107371020">Same here. The kids got them last year, I think for Christmas. <br/>
Actually, come to think of it, Gavin got one and Avery used some of <br/>
her Christmas money to buy herself the pink one. Gavin was 4.5 yrs <br/>
and Avery was 2.5 yrs. They come out in spurts, depending on where <br/>
they are being stored at the moment (they recently lost their usual <br/>
storage spot in the corner of the living room to a Christmas tree), <br/>
but typically it is Avery (3.5 yrs) who gets it out first to play <br/>
around with and then Gavin remembers his and gets it out too. Gavin <br/>
has only one book that he adores on it, and it is one of the Quest <br/>
ones about the Human Anatomy. He really loves learning about that and <br/>
then trying to stump us. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never used them as a tool with the kids, they just view them as <br/>
a fun thing to do. The funniest thing was a couple of months ago when <br/>
Gavin was playing with the anatomy book and clicked on something that <br/>
said that girls grow faster than boys...the look on his face was <br/>
priceless, and he looked to be truly offended by that statement.<br/>

leapster for Christmas and they enjoy playing with that too, but it will probably end <br/>
up in a rotation with everything else.  It is a toy, not a learning tool.  I <br/>
view it as I would books on tape, or computer games/workbooks.  They like it <br/>
when they like it and don&#39;t touch it when they aren&#39;t interested.<br/>
<br/>
Both the leap pad and the leapster are great for long car rides the kids have <br/>
been on before.  Our two know every cow on the way down to their grandma&#39;s, <br/>
so it helped ot have something different in the car.<br/>

that the system does not read for you, he was done with it.  So, off it will <br/>
go!!<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
Do you think he might be learning to read soon?  I think I&#39;d just put that <br/>
thing away until he is older. <br/>
<br/>
Your son used that Leappad exactly the way my sons use video games and game <br/>
systems.  Once they were through with a game, the system would sit untouched <br/>
for weeks, until it happened that they got a new game.  I&#39;ve never gotten rid of <br/>
the old game systems, just maybe packed them away or stored them accessibly.  <br/>
Now all our game systems are in one cabinet with a special TV (FINALLY!), and <br/>
those old games get played by someone cycling through here.  My 10 yo is now <br/>
getting to the point where he can play some of the games I rather he didn&#39;t <br/>
play when he was 3 or 4 (we protected his vivid imagination from scary images <br/>
when he was little--still do) and he doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s on the old Super <br/>
Nintendo.  It&#39;s there to learn from.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait, he just reminded me that my 21 yo son took the Super Nintendo to his <br/>
house a few months ago!<br/>
<br/>
I think if the Leappad was useful to your son, that it probably will be again <br/>
and he might miss it eventually if you get rid of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840399759">We really debated long and hard on getting the system.  My son had <br/>
been asking for a long time so finally I decided to go ahead with <br/>
it.  I thought at least if he used it in the car it may help pass <br/>
the time.  Well, he has used it once or twice in the last year.  <br/>
Fact is, he has a computer which is so much better that I think this <br/>
just bores him.  Also ,he is not into reading at all yet so tapping <br/>
on the words is not remotely interesting.  My sister got one for her <br/>
daughter who had also been asking for it and she loves trying to <br/>
read, etc.  She did not use it much either.  Thats just my <br/>
experience!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-970612118">I have only started unschooling within the last few months, so before that I was really into teaching him to read.  I let all the schoolbooks go, and stopped pushing it, when I came to my senses about his learning.  Since I have began to relax with everything, he is now able to do things like play on the computer for as long as he likes.  I use to restrict computer time, tv time, game boy time, all time.  I see the errors in my way.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have been checking in with him for more than a month now on the leap pad.  He got 2 new books for it for this Christmas, and did not want to keep them.  We took them back to the store to exchange them for the toys that I also use to restrict.  He has not played with it in months, and, as I write this, I realize that he probably only did because it was something that I did not restrict.  <br/>
 <br/>
We live in a small house, so I have always worked with him to keep the clutter down to a minimum.  When there gets to be too much stuff, we go thru all the toys and sort them out, so things that he does not want/does not play with go out.  My SIL owns a consignment shop, so the toys go there with the understanding that he gets the money that is earned from the sale of his toys.  The toys go into the garage for a period of time, until I take them to the store.  That way if he changes his mind about something, it is not gone right away.  I can only remember one toy that he has ever asked for back.  They are in an area of the garage that he can see them when he goes out to play in his craft area.  That way he can look at them and tell me if something needs to come back into the house.  <br/>
 <br/>
With so much available to him now without restriction, I honestly do not think that he will want to play with this again.  If he changes his mind, we can always pick one up again at the consignment shops.  <br/>

Do you think he might be learning to read soon?  I think I&#39;d just put that <br/>
thing away until he is older. <br/>
<br/>
Your son used that Leappad exactly the way my sons use video games and game <br/>
systems.  Once they were through with a game, the system would sit untouched <br/>
for weeks, until it happened that they got a new game.  I&#39;ve never gotten rid of <br/>
the old game systems, just maybe packed them away or stored them accessibly.  <br/>
Now all our game systems are in one cabinet with a special TV (FINALLY!), and <br/>
those old games get played by someone cycling through here.  My 10 yo is now <br/>
getting to the point where he can play some of the games I rather he didn&#39;t <br/>
play when he was 3 or 4 (we protected his vivid imagination from scary images <br/>
when he was little--still do) and he doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s on the old Super <br/>
Nintendo.  It&#39;s there to learn from.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait, he just reminded me that my 21 yo son took the Super Nintendo to his <br/>
house a few months ago!<br/>
<br/>
I think if the Leappad was useful to your son, that it probably will be again <br/>
and he might miss it eventually if you get rid of it.<br/>
