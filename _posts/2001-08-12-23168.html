<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756207344">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any resources for learning Japanese (for fun). My 13 year <br/>
old son has been interested in this language for a long time. I&#39;ve bought <br/>
books (the kind for tourists and pleasure books) and a CDrom but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to use them much. He did enjoy the CD but it keep crashing on us. Very <br/>
frusturating! <br/>
Any ideas would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
BTW short intro: Mom to three hs&#39;d sons:14,13 &11 and two older children: son <br/>
23, daughter 18 <br/>

<br/>
In Denver, adult friends of mine have taken a class for a long time and are <br/>
really liking it.<br/>
<br/>
In Albuquerque, some of the teens watch all their anime in Japanese with <br/>
English subtitles, and they pick up some phrases and they get a feel for what <br/>
it sounds like.  I&#39;d recommend that for now, and if his interest continues <br/>
he&#39;ll have the sound of the language in him, at least, before starting to <br/>
learn grammar and vocabulary.<br/>

I forgot to say, if possible get the anime on DVD rather than VHS.  You can <br/>
choose which combination of soundtrack and subtitles you get.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have the Rosetta Stone demo program, which we got for something like<br/>
$3 plus shipping at FUN Books (http://www.fun-books.com), and so far I&#39;ve<br/>
done the first couple lessons in  about half a dozen languages. Japanese<br/>
is included. It&#39;s a computer program, very intuitive and point and click,<br/>
and I&#39;ve enjoyed it... plus I was amazed that after 10 minutes I was<br/>
understanding a lot of what they said in, say,  Arabic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309213585">I would suggest the &quot;in 10 minutes a day&quot; books for learning the beginnings <br/>
of a new language. The thing about them is that a) they use a very fluid <br/>
pedagogy that allows for natural learning by replacing vocabulary words one <br/>
by one in an English context b) they have lots of fun things in them and c) <br/>
they have nifty stickers you can put on things all over your house to <br/>
reinforce your new vocabulary. Even if you *just* stick the vocabulary <br/>
stickers round about the house you will pick up some things, and you may <br/>
find other members of the family getting into the language as well.<br/>

PS  We just happen to have Japanese in 10 minutes a Day on our bookshelf, <br/>
and the ISBN is 0944502342. :)  Fancy that for a weird coincidence!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a brilliant idea!!!  My 14 yo has been addicted to those anime&#39;s for a <br/>
long time and is also interested in learning Japanese - I think there&#39;s a <br/>
connection there... how about you??  LOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re going to start getting those things from the Library!  I feel <br/>
like I&#39;ve had a lightbulb moment... but Sandra had it for me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch,<br/>
