<div id="ygrps-yiv-453271788">About two months after dh&#39;s father died, we moved into the house that we had<br/>
bought from him.  He didn&#39;t believe in anything after life and was forever<br/>
telling anyone who would listen that &quot;you die, you rot, the maggots eat<br/>
you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, we had this long discussionb because individual beliefs are all fine<br/>
and dandy but making that speech (and he was really good at getting a bit<br/>
graphic) in front of 4 yo children wasn&#39;t my idea of appropriate.  During<br/>
the conversation, dh said to him, well what if you&#39;re wrong.  He said, &quot;if<br/>
I&#39;m wrong I&#39;ll come back and let you know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A week after we moved into the house, at about 15 minutes after midnight our<br/>
bedroom door flew open and banged against the wall and there is a shadowy<br/>
man standing in the doorway.  &quot;He&quot; turns around and walks down the hall.<br/>
Hubby leaps out of bed and starts running down the hall, cussing and chasing<br/>
this &quot;burgler&quot; stark naked!  I go running down the &quot;t&quot; in the hall to check<br/>
on the kidlets.  They are sound asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby comes back to the bedroom and starts asking what the kids were doing<br/>
up (they weren&#39;t).  He insisted it was one of the kids because he couldn&#39;t<br/>
find anyone in the house.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all given him a bad time for years now about how the crazy naked man<br/>
scared the ghost to death &lt;g&gt; and ask him exactly what he was going to do if<br/>
he caught the &quot;burglar&quot; since he didn&#39;t have anything with him.<br/>
<br/>
He still insists that there is no such thing as ghosts but he looks like a<br/>
kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar when he says it &lt;g&gt;<br/>
