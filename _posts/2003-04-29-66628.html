&gt; Every evening, I take a book and go into the bathroom for an hour-<br/>
&gt; long bubble bath.  It&#39;s my luxury to enjoy hot water and bubbles, <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s my pleasure to read, and it&#39;s the time for daddy and the boys to <br/>
&gt; do whatever the heck they want without my interference.  And it keeps <br/>
&gt; me sane.  Meeting other people&#39;s needs all day long and pretending <br/>
&gt; that my only need is to please the people around me wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
&gt; healthy for me, and it wouldn&#39;t be healthy for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s the thing, I do LOTS of things for me and I don&#39;t just pretend my <br/>
only need is to please the people around me.  I just spent a wonderful <br/>
weekend at a beautiful bed and breakfast because it was MY need, MY desire to <br/>
be pampered myself.<br/>
<br/>
No one resented me for that.  I have long bubble baths myself, not every <br/>
night but several times a week.  Sometimes one of the children will come in <br/>
to sit and chat with me, sometimes not.  <br/>
<br/>
I read a lot.  I crochet and knit layettes for infants who have passed so <br/>
that their parents have something beautiful to see them in for the first and <br/>
sometimes last time.<br/>
<br/>
I also do other things with grieving parents and siblings.  That is for me.  <br/>
Lot of things are for me.  But I still think it&#39;s important to make each of <br/>
my children feel special and loved and know that there is at least one person <br/>
in the world who thinks they are the most special person ever born.  I want <br/>
them to know that I am grateful I am their mother and that they are precious <br/>
to me in every way.<br/>
<br/>
I want them to feel like they&#39;ve been wrapped in that cozy well worn quilt <br/>
and surrounded by a mothers arms and some days it&#39;s probably too warm to be <br/>
wrapped up in that quilt or they are just too busy and that&#39;s fine with me <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I think I might be angry if I didn&#39;t have other things that were done just <br/>
for me.  I could see how one might become angry if they felt they HAD to do <br/>
any certain thing for their child and they had no life other than to please <br/>
others.  I don&#39;t think that would be blessing anyone at all.  <br/>
