dang much to learn from unschoolers. I will be selective, however, with what <br/>
I reply to.) <br/>
<br/>
For the record, we are not unschoolers in my home. I am fascinated with <br/>
unschooling, my favorite books about life are usually by unschoolers (Grace <br/>
Llewellyn or, say, Albert Jay Nock ... well, Nock is dead, and had some ideas <br/>
that would piss the hell out of most at this list, but he essentially taught <br/>
himself Greek and Latin until he went off to college; however, I think many <br/>
unschoolers might find him interesting). <br/>
<br/>
I have back issues of GWS and turn to them frequently. I wish however, that <br/>
there were no such label [unschooling] for what goes on in the homes of most <br/>
members here. Yet, I understand that we need touchstones, and &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
suffices. But if there were no such label, I think what we do here in my home <br/>
would actually be much in line with what Holt, et al. were about, but not <br/>
completely, I admit. <br/>
<br/>
While we talk about &quot;unschooling&quot; some of us have the peripheral image or <br/>
barometer, if you will, of the education we got, or at least what the <br/>
majority still gets, and that is public schooling. The ubiquitous and <br/>
universal creed that &quot;people must be educated,&quot; gets thrown about as if <br/>
&quot;education&quot; is an endeavor apart from living. It isn&#39;t, and I think we in our <br/>
home would be about the same things as we are now, but without the talk about <br/>
it being &quot;education.&quot; Living and loving is more like it.<br/>
<br/>
What I say above so feebly, got said much better in the pages of GWS, and <br/>
thankfully still gets said in mags like HEM, or books like The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook.<br/>
