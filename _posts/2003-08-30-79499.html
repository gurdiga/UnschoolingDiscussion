There&#39;s also Karin from Phoenix.<br/>
I saw photos of their round house.  It&#39;s hard to totally picture from photos, <br/>
but it&#39;s a work of art!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Shannon!<br/>
<br/>
Some photos I pulled and pasted into notes I had (e-mail or bio notes) of the <br/>
people.  <br/>
It will help me with names and faces next year!  (I hope)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894982521">Oh yes, I had forgotten Karen and Brian were in there.  And also Elissa.  I&#39;<br/>
ve been to Karin&#39;s house.  It is really neat!  even irl, it is hard to GET<br/>
just from looking at the front.but once she took me around back, I could see<br/>
how it was built.  They (the builders) put a facade on it to make it look<br/>
like a regular house.  So you&#39;d never know it was a round house just by<br/>
looking.  I thought I was at the wrong house when I pulled up to it.  But<br/>
then Karin came out.  So I knew I was in the right place.  :o)<br/>

Hi Shannon!<br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I just signed back on to the list today (after going no-mail for the<br/>
week we were gone) and I see discussion about me and my house. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I went and looked at your photo album pictures and they turned out great! I<br/>
love all your added little captions, too. Then I saw the picture you took of<br/>
me and Bryan - I didn&#39;t even know you took that! I was too busy feeding my<br/>
face, but I guess Bryan noticed and even smiled for the pic. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing those pictures! Can&#39;t believe that was only a week ago.<br/>
It seems like it was at least a month ago, for some reason.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the compliment on our house, Sandra! It is hard to picture from<br/>
the photos, I have to agree. You (and anyone coming to Phoenix in the<br/>
future) will just have to come and see it for yourself sometime!<br/>
