<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022990727">7. Think about what is REALLY important and keep that always in the  <br/>
forefront of your interactions with your children. What values do you  <br/>
hope to pass on to them? You can&#39;t &quot;pass on&quot; something you don&#39;t  <br/>
exemplify yourself. Treat them the way you want them to treat others.  <br/>
Do you want respect? Be respectful. Do you want responsibility from  <br/>
them? Be responsible. Think of how you look to them, from their  <br/>
perspective. Do you order them around? Is that respectful? Do you  <br/>
say, &quot;I&#39;ll be just a minute&quot; and then take 20 more minutes talking to  <br/>
a friend while the children wait? Is that responsible? Focus more on  <br/>
your own behavior than on theirs. It&#39;ll pay off bigger.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is something I&#39;ve been working on a lot over the past few months.<br/>
There&#39;s a specific type of play that I don&#39;t enjoy with my 3 y/o son.  He&#39;s<br/>
into dinosaurs and dragons and beasts in general, and has a lot of plastic<br/>
figurines, and sometimes he just wants to sit and bang them together<br/>
enacting battles.  The outcome seems to be based on rules I don&#39;t fully<br/>
know, gleaned from movies and shows he&#39;s seen (one rule he reminded me of<br/>
last night:  King Kong *always* beats T-Rex).  But the game really is just<br/>
about one toy hitting another, and the struck toy flies across the room and<br/>
is dead, but then comes back to life after a dragon toy goes over and<br/>
breathes on it.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to wrestle, build stuff with blocks or megabloks, line up toys and<br/>
knock them down with balls or blocks, throw balls or pillows at each other<br/>
or up and down the stairs...just about *anything* other than banging plastic<br/>
toys together and saying &quot;grrrrrrrr&quot; &#39;til my throat hurts.  And even when<br/>
I&#39;m happily doing toy monster battles with him, it just never seems I&#39;m<br/>
doing it &quot;right&quot;.  He gets frustrated easily about my Battle Ineptitude.<br/>
<br/>
So when he&#39;s immersed in battle, and I walk by and he says, &quot;Hey Daddy,<br/>
wanna pay wid me?&quot;, most of the time (until recently) I delay.  It seems<br/>
like at that moment, suddenly I can see my entire Honey Do list extremely<br/>
clearly in my mind, and half the list sounds appealing to do *right now*.<br/>
Generally I&#39;ll say &quot;in 5 minutes, after I take out the trash&quot; or something<br/>
similar, and about half the time it turns into 15 or 30 minutes, during<br/>
which I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll have switched to something else before I plop on the<br/>
floor with him.<br/>
<br/>
I really only realized this a few months ago, so I&#39;m working to rebuild that<br/>
trust with him, and Pam&#39;s tip #7 reminded me to give it more attention.  I<br/>
started re-reading Playful Parenting a couple weeks ago, and that&#39;s helping.<br/>

I couldn&#39;t figure out how to play Barbies, so I would find other  <br/>
girls for Holly to play with and do all the necessary driving.  I&#39;d  <br/>
help her get things shse needed, and keep her Barbie clothes  <br/>
repaired, and help her sort things out and take care of things.  When  <br/>
we moved, there was a little room  under the stairs with shelves on  <br/>
the walls and that became Barbie Land.   I kept it safe and clean and  <br/>
a friend who sold carpet brought over a bunch of samples that Holly  <br/>
could have for flooring and seating.<br/>
<br/>
There are alternatives to playing everything a child plays always,  <br/>
but some people seem to expect to play nothing with their children,  <br/>
and I hope Pam was talking about them, not people like me who played  <br/>
all but one thing.  (I hope.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah - I didn&#39;t do well at certain &quot;play pretend&quot; activities - playing  <br/>
dress-ups. I also never seemed to be playing right. Funny, because I  <br/>
loved to play pretend as a little kid, myself. Those are my best  <br/>
memories - dressing up and becoming someone else for a while! I just  <br/>
could never do that much with my own kids. So, instead, I became a  <br/>
great resource for them - I would find all kinds of cool dress-ups at  <br/>
thrift stores, for example.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel the same in regard to Lewi&#39;s &#39;characters&#39; (that&#39;s what he calls it). It&#39;s much harder for me to get into than any other play and I often find I&#39;m dragging the chain when asked to play it. I try to though as much as I can and I try to really get into a feeling of enjoying it (and mostly I do) because I know it won&#39;t be long and he will no longer be asking me to play this sort of imaginary game.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully I love to play lots of otehr stuff with him so it&#39;s pretty OK most of the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088043824">When on of my kids wants me to play something I am not good  or I just don;t know how to play , usually pretend things with lego, playmobil, little people, thatn I take pon my self to set up the sets.<br/>
With dolls too. I get them, brushed, dressed, clean if needed, it is like organizing them.<br/>
That makes my kids happy and I can deal with it because honestly I am not a good pretend player.<br/>
With Thomas I would set up tracks and organize engines in a row. They will them bang and get them apart but that is OK if they want to do that.<br/>
I will just keep on organizing.<br/>
