<div id="ygrps-yiv-126553183">Tomorrow night is the award/recognition ceremony for our homeschool assn. Most of the other families are presenting certificates and having their children do a piano piece, a song, a poem, etc. <br/>
<br/>
We, on the other hand, being our first year, have done little this year to &quot;present&quot; as *outward* achievements. (I have instead seen growth and maturity in my children (13 yr old son and 11 yr old daughter), plus an incredible family closeness, but that&#39;s another story...) (I have decided that next year we will probably not be a part of the recognition ceremony, but we are already on the program for this year.)<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to do, and have started, is to present some &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; awards, like &quot;Perfect Attendance&quot; (like who misses a day when you are unschooling?) and &quot;Fewest Classes Attended&quot; along with &quot;Most Well-rested Student&quot; (my 11 yr old daughter likes her sleep!). I was hoping that some of you &quot;cheeky&quot; unschoolers may have a few ideas. My husband suggested &quot;Most Improved Surfing Skills&quot; (tv) and &quot;Excellence in Hand/Eye Coordination&quot; (video games). We also agreed on potentially using &quot;Attending Latest Class&quot; because my son and I went to Walmart and the grocery store at midnight one Friday night and had some of the most intense talks ever about a variety of subjects...<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions are welcome....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
Terri   <br/>

I like the ideas you&#39;ve already come up with a lot.  Are there cooking things <br/>
you could throw in?  Y&#39;know, a talent doesn&#39;t have to be music or poetry.  <br/>
Could be you could bribe the judges--bribe the whole audience!!  You could <br/>
say &quot;Best Cookiemaking&quot; and give everyone a recipe card and a cookie.<br/>
<br/>
That would be memorable above the rest, I think.  And you could explain that <br/>
it stimulates more senses--sight, scent, taste, touch and having heard you <br/>
talk about it, hearing.  And keeping the card is a reinforcing review, and a <br/>
handy bookmark.<br/>

friendliest kid?  The most helpful other-parent?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68242004">I like that! Jessica has made big strides in cooking this year. She has taken on alot of responsibility and matured tremendously. This is the child that fought me when I took her out of ps three weeks into this school year! She was so mad at me...now, she couldn&#39;t conceive of the notion of EVER going back! It&#39;s such a wonderful feeling to have watched the changes taking place in her! Sure does make a mama proud!<br/>
