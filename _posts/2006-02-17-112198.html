<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655333053">I just watched this.  I think it showed good examples of unschooling.<br/>
 However, the Los Angeles educator they talked to seemed to act as<br/>
though all students are supposed to be interested in a higher level<br/>
chemistry class, or that all people use world history and geography in<br/>
their daily lives.<br/>
I do have one opinion now about a lot of this.  As an adult, I learn<br/>
what I am interested in.  When I was in school, I may have memorized<br/>
many facts for tests, but mainly actually learned only what I was<br/>
interested in.  I learned much more away from school than what I<br/>
learned at school.  <br/>
Anyway, that is only my opinion. <br/>

<br/>
What I did was to go directly to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com">http://www.cnn.com</a> and click any of the <br/>
&quot;watch&quot; features in the right hand column--doesn&#39;t matter what the <br/>
subject matter is. Once it takes you there, you&#39;ll be able to click <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; from the menu on right of other features to watch.<br/>
