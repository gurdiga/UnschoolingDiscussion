<div id="ygrps-yiv-280382227">I think for me the hardest part of unschooling isn&#39;t the academics, but<br/>
the whole living aspect. I know what I&#39;m not supposed to do, and have<br/>
the concept of what I&#39;m aiming for, but I get lost in all the specifics.<br/>
I went back and key-word searched for some ideas, read a few more pages<br/>
on Sandra&#39;s site (some I read before, some I didn&#39;t) and I&#39;m still<br/>
coming up short. This is one area I really wish I had more examples of<br/>
in my own life to use when I need them.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, first of would be my son. He&#39;s four and he&#39;s absolutely wonderful.<br/>
He is full of life and energy and happiness; is helpful and<br/>
compassionate, and just a joy to be around. But when he gets upset,<br/>
which tends to be fairly easily, and quite often, he goes off quickly<br/>
and loudly. He doesn&#39;t throw a kicking tantrum, and doesn&#39;t hurt things<br/>
or other people when he&#39;s mad, he just cries loudly. I tried a few times<br/>
to get him to breathe with me, but he doesn&#39;t want to, and I feel like<br/>
I&#39;m just forcing an idea on him that he doesn&#39;t understand. He doesn&#39;t<br/>
like to look at me in the eye when he&#39;s in this state.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly I just want to help him learn to calm down, be patient, and<br/>
whatever it is that he&#39;s mad about we can talk about and figure out.<br/>
He&#39;s always been more dramatic in his anger versus his other feelings,<br/>
but lately it&#39;s become a constant everyday thing. When his sister takes<br/>
a toy away, or won&#39;t share. When he wants to do something RIGHT NOW and<br/>
we just can&#39;t. Very good reasons to feel angry, but it tears me up when<br/>
he cries so hard and shuts us out.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of it is that he is wanting to be in control of his world,<br/>
and though I help him with that as much as possible (he gets his own<br/>
food, puts on clothes, opens and closes van doors, etc) there are still<br/>
so many things that he can&#39;t do - like drive to the store on the<br/>
highway. We used to have a long driveway we&#39;d let his sister drive down<br/>
but now we live in town and don&#39;t get that chance as often.  But even<br/>
when I let him have something he really wants, it doesn&#39;t stop him from<br/>
wanting it again, now, already.<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of it is giving him more &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; than &quot;no&#39;s&quot;, but sometimes<br/>
it seems like there&#39;s just not enough &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; for him. My daughter isn&#39;t<br/>
like this, so it&#39;s new for me. She&#39;s challenged me in many other ways :)<br/>
<br/>
The second thing is deferring negative behavior in general. When I first<br/>
began understanding &quot;radical&quot; unschooling (apart from academic) I<br/>
finally began to grasp that it&#39;s not letting your kids do whatever they<br/>
want all the time, which is how I first understood the term. Safety is<br/>
still in place, and it&#39;s more about not limiting their choices to a box<br/>
than it is giving them the whole world at their fingertips to get lost<br/>
in. I loved Sandra&#39;s &quot;balance&quot; page...perfect for how I&#39;m feeling,<br/>
trying to find that balance.<br/>
<br/>
So with APing, I already don&#39;t spank, and I don&#39;t do time out. But to be<br/>
honest, I still haven&#39;t figured out quite what I should do when the kids<br/>
do something that simply isn&#39;t acceptable (hitting one another, grabbing<br/>
toys, etc.)  Luckily, either I&#39;m doing some things right, or I have<br/>
pretty good kids, but we don&#39;t have a lot of issues with this. But when<br/>
we do, I feel powerlesss, guilty, and unsure of what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight the kids were jumping on the couch. Now, if it was a new couch<br/>
then maybe I wouldn&#39;t let them do this, but to be honest the jumping<br/>
doesn&#39;t really bother me. It does bother DH only because he&#39;s afraid of<br/>
the kids getting hurt, and maybe he doesn&#39;t like the noise involved, but<br/>
otherwise it isn&#39;t the jumping on the couches that he disapproved of,<br/>
it&#39;s the manner in which they were jumping which could result in someone<br/>
getting hurt. (other things they do turn out the same way - they are<br/>
kids, afterall! But running, dancing, etc....)<br/>
<br/>
So he had asked them to stop. And maybe asked them again (I was in the<br/>
kitchen doing dishes, so heard the commotion, but not his requests - he<br/>
didn&#39;t shout them.) But they kept jumping (because we used to threaten<br/>
with spankings, though we didn&#39;t actually spank anymore, and so formally<br/>
he would have threatened them and they would have stopped) and as has<br/>
happened before, one of them fell and hurt themselves (not badly, but he<br/>
made a huge deal of it at the time so Jim thought he was hurt bad.)<br/>
Jim&#39;s first reaction was to yell and unfortunately state the opposite of<br/>
how he actually felt, saying that he can&#39;t feel sympathy for someone who<br/>
was &quot;asking for it,&quot; though he did apologize for yelling and explained<br/>
that he was only asking them to stop jumping because he was afraid<br/>
someone would get hurt (he is often more afraid of this than I am and<br/>
doesn&#39;t like a lot of the things I let them do, which maybe he&#39;s right,<br/>
I don&#39;t know?)<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, I kind of got mad because he yelled, and I yelled at him (I<br/>
know, not helping) and was trying to explain what he should have done,<br/>
and he stated, &quot;Well, since we aren&#39;t making the kids listen to us<br/>
anymore...&quot; , and I tried to quickly think of what he should have maybe<br/>
done, so I said, &quot;Well, then get them involved in another activity to<br/>
they aren&#39;t jumping anymore, &quot; and he responded that his work was<br/>
important and he didn&#39;t have time to get them involved in something.<br/>
<br/>
So as I thought about that, I eventually told him that there were at<br/>
least three choices he could have made: Let them jump, ignoring them,<br/>
and watch someone possibly get hurt and end up in the emergency room,<br/>
(his fear) which takes up LOTS of time, or yell at them to stop and MAKE<br/>
them, thus ignoring the style of parenting I&#39;m trying to incorporate, or<br/>
take the 5 minutes to pique their interest in something else and go back<br/>
to finishing up your work, which I understand is important.<br/>
<br/>
I know this may not have been the best response, but it&#39;s what I came up<br/>
with, and why I&#39;m writing. I told him I make mistakes a lot, too, and I<br/>
honestly don&#39;t know how to handle things like that, either. I know we<br/>
don&#39;t have to let our kids run &quot;wild&quot; in unshcooling (I think that&#39;s<br/>
where the unparenting comes up, is those of us new to the lifestyle of<br/>
unschooling who lift all the barriers but have nothing in place to help<br/>
when things get out of control.)<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve seen Sandra use the term &quot;and mean it&quot; a couple of times,<br/>
and I read in an old post how she said to look the person in the eye,<br/>
and in that case remove an object the person was using for harm. But<br/>
what if the person is yelling mean things (like the kid in the car who<br/>
was backseat driving - what would you have done if they DIDN&#39;T stop?)<br/>
<br/>
Most times I find ways around it by distracting them, etc. But maybe<br/>
there&#39;s other things I can do but haven&#39;t thought of. I know other<br/>
parents are suprised (it may seem silly to those for whom unschooing<br/>
comes naturally) when they see that you don&#39;t allow all behaviors of<br/>
your children, because that is how I felt. I mistakenly thought that<br/>
giving your child freedom to choose meant letting them do and have<br/>
whatever they want.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s the guideing and shaping them, without putting unnecessary<br/>
limits on them. And I want to know how to put those necessary limits on<br/>
them in gentle ways...Just like my babies. After playing outside for an<br/>
hour, they always migrate towards the road or parking lot, and I end up<br/>
picking them up and placing them back in our yard, only to repeat with<br/>
the other one (twins.) After half a dozen times I simply take them<br/>
indoors because they are focused only on that forbidden place, and then<br/>
they cry when I stop them. I feel bad that they cry, but the playing in<br/>
the road is NOT an option. I have to hope that their crying is okay (and<br/>
temperary, of course, as I involve them in something fun inside) as my<br/>
priority is safety.<br/>
<br/>
I also felt bad last night when we went to the zoo for a halloween<br/>
night. It&#39;s an hour away, and the babies don&#39;t do well with long drives.<br/>
So they fussed some of the way up there, fussed some of the time there<br/>
(and were held most of it since they fussed in the stroller) and fussed<br/>
most of the way home, with my persistant one crying on and off the whole<br/>
way. They also do this the few times we&#39;ve been to my parents&#39; home 3<br/>
hours away.<br/>
<br/>
I hate letting them cry, and used to nurse my other two on long trips.<br/>
But I can&#39;t get between their seat and could only nurse one at a time,<br/>
anyway (I tried when they were younger, and whoever wasn&#39;t nursing cried<br/>
and made the other one anxious as well. We didn&#39;t make the trip again<br/>
for quite awhile.) Bottles and pacifiers never worked for my kids, and<br/>
toys and movies only go so far. They know what they want, and it&#39;s out<br/>
of the car seats. But for the rest of the family, our priority is to<br/>
enjoy something for the older kids (zoo, or Grandma&#39;s house) We don&#39;t do<br/>
it often because it&#39;s hard on the babies. But even so, I wonder if I&#39;m<br/>
wrong in doing it at all, then.<br/>
<br/>
I envy people who on another post talked about bringing their babies<br/>
with them everywhere. My babies have always slept okay anywhwere we go,<br/>
but it&#39;s the getting there that&#39;s difficult. Plus with the twins,<br/>
there&#39;s no free arm for me when they both need me and won&#39;t even go to<br/>
Jim. I am often holding one on each hip and rarely do they open up to<br/>
other people. So it&#39;s hard for me to figure out how to balance the<br/>
needs/desires of my older two with the needs/desires of my younger two.<br/>
Sometimes the older ones suffer because of the younger ones (playgrounds<br/>
are out unless I have another older person to help chase a baby who<br/>
loves climbing - I can only help one up a ladder.) And sometimes the<br/>
younger ones suffer for sake of the older ones (zoo) Is there a way to<br/>
make everyone happy? Short of time, that is :)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long...these thoughts have been in my head awhile, and<br/>
after the short fuse incident tonight, I thought I&#39;d ask. I just feel<br/>
bad always asking and not contributing a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You might try searching for meltdown in the archives for some things  <br/>
others have tried. But I think you&#39;re focusing on fixing a meltdown  <br/>
when the first plan is to get to the child when you can see signals  <br/>
that are leading toward a meltdown and fix that instead. Obviously  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t get everything. So next is to be there to comfort them  <br/>
through the meltdown rather than fix their feelings (eg, stop the  <br/>
meltdown). You&#39;ll need to try lots of different things. Try asking  <br/>
when he&#39;s far from a meltdown what he likes and what he doesn&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
If he had a puppy and it died, would you expect him to get over his  <br/>
feelings immediately? When he&#39;s frustrated or overwhelmed or  <br/>
whatever, he needs to process the feelings. I think you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
rush him through it.<br/>
<br/>
I know you have lots of questions, but it will help you to help  <br/>
yourself better if you post one problem at a time. Most people don&#39;t  <br/>
have oodles of time to dig into multiple problems in one email.  <br/>
They&#39;re likely to set it aside until they find the time, which, for  <br/>
many, might be never. I probably could have written a lot more for  <br/>
each problem, but there just isn&#39;t time, so you&#39;re basically cheating  <br/>
yourself of more thorough answers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But to be<br/>
&gt; honest, I still haven&#39;t figured out quite what I should do when the  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *will* be tricky at the beginning. The kids are used to you  <br/>
stopping their fun rather than trusting that you want to work with  <br/>
them to find safe and acceptable ways to do what they want.<br/>
<br/>
Think proactively. If they&#39;re jumping on the couch, how about a  <br/>
trampoline. Or a couple of cheap mattresses on the floor. Find ways  <br/>
they *can* jump.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Sandra can say stop. A long time radically unschooled child  <br/>
hears &quot;Wait, there&#39;s a problem with that. Let&#39;s find a better way,&quot;  <br/>
when mom says stop. Conventionally parented children just hear  <br/>
&quot;Stop.&quot; Our kids trust we&#39;re trying to help. Your kids don&#39;t yet  <br/>
trust you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s an hour away, and the babies don&#39;t do well with long drives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You solve that by not putting them in a position to be miserable. By  <br/>
driving a long distance when you knew they couldn&#39;t, you set them up  <br/>
to fail.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots of things you&#39;ll need to pass on and find alternatives  <br/>
that will work for now. If the twins can stay with someone, you could  <br/>
have done that. Or if your husband could have taken the kids. Or one  <br/>
of the other people attending could have taken your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way your husband could have gotten you to enjoy a  <br/>
Christmas party when he knew you had a migraine going into it?<br/>
<br/>
The babies aren&#39;t the problem. The problem is kids who want seemingly  <br/>
incompatible things. Focus on how to balance two different needs (you  <br/>
can ask what others have done :-) rather than how uncooperative the  <br/>
babies are.<br/>

I don&#39;t think anyone here asked you to try to have him look you in  <br/>
the eye when he&#39;s frantic.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But when he gets upset, which tends to be fairly easily, and quite  <br/>
often...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Talk to him when he&#39;s happy and calm about how he can avoid that fast  <br/>
anger by breathing deeply when he&#39;s getting angry, not after he&#39;s  <br/>
furious.  (It will work to calm fury, too, but you can&#39;t talk to him  <br/>
at that point, so do it at a calm time.)<br/>
<br/>
More important than that, though, look at what&#39;s happening before he  <br/>
gets angry, and make sure that you yourself are practicing that  <br/>
calming breathing.  Don&#39;t make it into a thing that&#39;s just for kids.   <br/>
Do it yourself until you *know* it works, instead of recommending it  <br/>
to him because you read about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you adopt these ideas into your own mom life and start to  <br/>
understand them at a physical level, in a thoughtful way, then you&#39;ll  <br/>
have something to give besides words and vague ideas.<br/>

<br/>
Holding him, rocking him, while you&#39;re breathing slowly, could have  <br/>
the same effect, and it has nothing to do with an idea he might or  <br/>
might not understand.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998824037">What type of things upset your son so much?  It sounds like you have your<br/>
hands full with your growing family, but if you can find a way to be more<br/>
present with him maybe you can avoid having him get to that point.  Perhaps<br/>
if you talk to him during a quiet time and let him know you want to help him<br/>
but he needs to come to you and let you help him find a solution by telling<br/>
you what is frustrating him before he is in a rage, it would help.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s tried before and you haven&#39;t intervened and so he doesn&#39;t bother?<br/>
I don&#39;t know but I do know that many people see kids fighting as normal and<br/>
they don&#39;t step in and help them communicate in a way that finds a solution<br/>
they can both live with.  They see the fighting as normal or don&#39;t want to<br/>
spend the time to get to the bottom of what caused it and so they punish<br/>
them for fighting or just ignore it.  The other thing I have noticed as a<br/>
difference between parents is that some don&#39;t notice issues at all until it<br/>
is a full blown tantrum.  I have a relative who I really enjoy visiting with<br/>
but she can really only focus on one thing at a time and if she is visiting<br/>
with me, her kids cries (not real cries, but little frustrations) go<br/>
unnoticed until they have a full blown tantrum.  She never sees it coming<br/>
and I see it from miles away.  Now I always try to step in and help the kid<br/>
or say something to her because she just doesn&#39;t see it coming.  She&#39;s just<br/>
wired differently than I am.  I am very sensitive to all the stimulus around<br/>
me and very sensitive to people&#39;s emotions.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband sounds a lot like your husband.  He works on the road a lot too<br/>
so that always made it harder because he was gone a lot.  He wasn&#39;t trying<br/>
to be a hard ass, he just worried (a lot) and was reactive when they jumped<br/>
on the furniture, or did something that he thought they might get hurt<br/>
doing.  What made it even more difficult is that I would allow those<br/>
behaviors when he wasn&#39;t home and so when he came home and said NO, they<br/>
didn&#39;t listen because they always did those things.  When he was home and<br/>
clearly getting upset, I would ask them to stop because it worried their dad<br/>
and if they wouldn&#39;t listen I&#39;d try to find something exciting we could do<br/>
to distract them.  (mine always liked to play outside)  In private sometimes<br/>
I would talk to him about their great body awareness and how careful they<br/>
really were and that they didn&#39;t want to get hurt either. Not sure if it<br/>
helped but eventually he got less anxious or they grew up, not sure which.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard sometimes to see our kids be upset and to feel like you can&#39;t fix<br/>
the problem.  When my kids were that age and crying in disappointment or for<br/>
some reason that I couldn&#39;t find a way to help them with, a lot of times I<br/>
would just hug them.  They might be stiff at first but it wasn&#39;t long before<br/>
they would melt in my arms and we&#39;d talk about the disappointment and then<br/>
they would move on.  They knew that I always made a huge effort to help them<br/>
get what they wanted and so the disappointed and frustrated times were few<br/>
and far between and I think they got over them quicker because they did know<br/>
I was on their team.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My girls were pretty needy girls when they were babies and toddlers.  They<br/>
were 21 months apart. They both HATED car seats.  There were times I was<br/>
leaned over nursed them too.  But mostly, despite what other people wanted<br/>
from me, I only went places where I felt I could meet their needs.  (which<br/>
meant keeping my sanity)  Often grandparents had to come to my house or<br/>
friends who liked to get out more would come to my house to visit since they<br/>
weren&#39;t as overwhelmed as I might be.  I was fortunate though that my kids<br/>
were pretty close in age and I didn&#39;t have older ones and younger ones.  I<br/>
knew that was something I couldn&#39;t handle, tbh.  I was overwhelmed with 2.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There probably is no way to make it possible for them to all do what they<br/>
want or have what they need at the same time but if they know you are always<br/>
trying to find ways to make it work.so that they get to do some things they<br/>
like, they will probably be more forgiving when it doesn&#39;t work out for<br/>
them.  I always talked about it too.  I pointed out (not in a mean way) when<br/>
I worked it out so that we could do such and such so they could see how I<br/>
was planning and working to make things happen.  Esp. when the kids were<br/>
littler (they are 12 and almost 14 now) I&#39;d always plan ahead and bring<br/>
things they liked to play with when we went places they didn&#39;t want to go.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you can find a mother&#39;s helper to go with you sometimes.<br/>
(like the zoo) Onlies work well or pre-teens who like little kids.  You<br/>
could maybe pay them something but some might like to come just to go to the<br/>
zoo and help you. <br/>

Okay.  Where is this advice to lift all the barriers?  I need to go  <br/>
and put pointers to warnings everywhere.  Please, seriously, where  <br/>
are the ideas coming from that are causing this chaos?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has any ideas about where these &quot;suddenly abandon  <br/>

advice about going more slowly.  It will save confusion.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re on a discussion list and someone says &quot;Just let it all go  <br/>
today, right now,&quot; maybe ask on the list whether that might not cause  <br/>
problems, and let someone who can figure out how to recommend a  <br/>
gradual changeover make some suggestions.  Please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289623671">Many of the things you describe sound very much like our house.  We <br/>
have 4 kids, ages 3-7.  I dont always deal with it all perfectly or <br/>
even close to and I have one that screams very loudly, very quickly, <br/>
fairly often when frustrated.  We also have some of the same issues <br/>
with couch jumping etc..  I dont mind it... my husband hates it.<br/>
Keeping myself calm and collected during a tantrum goes along way,  <br/>
sitting down and getting at my sons level helps to.  Expressing an <br/>
understanding of the frustration or fear he might be feeling helps with <br/>
him. Not telling him when to stop crying. Scheduling times to do the <br/>
things he really wants and we cant do also helps.  Like he wants a lego <br/>
set... dont have the money now so we will go buy it next week when my <br/>
husband gets paid.  I sometimes focus so much on how upset my son seems <br/>
to get when frustrated and forget to notice the times he is patient. <br/>
This morning he wanted to get on the computer.  I needed to help the <br/>
younger kids get dressed and dress myself. He waited about 30 minutes <br/>
and then we ran out of time cause we had to be somewhere and so he had <br/>
to wait while we ran an errand and came back home and he was very <br/>
patient.  I dont think that is bad for a 5 year old.  If I want to do <br/>
something on the computer I have a hard time waiting like that. So I <br/>
guess I am saying try to focus on the positives.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-459597459">-=-I think a lot of it is that he is wanting to be in control of his  <br/>
world,<br/>
and though I help him with that as much as possible (he gets his own<br/>
food, puts on clothes, opens and closes van doors, etc) there are still<br/>
so many things that he can&#39;t do - like drive to the store on the<br/>
highway. We used to have a long driveway we&#39;d let his sister drive down<br/>
but now we live in town and don&#39;t get that chance as often. But even<br/>
when I let him have something he really wants, it doesn&#39;t stop him from<br/>
wanting it again, now, already.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did he WANT to get his own food and open and close van doors?  I&#39;m  <br/>
just guessing from your overall tone that maybe you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
communicate that if he does things for himself he&#39;s &quot;in control of  <br/>
his world.&quot;  Making choices isn&#39;t about &quot;being in control&quot; so much as  <br/>
it is about having some leeway to make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you haven&#39;t told him he&#39;s &quot;in control,&quot; because that would be  <br/>
a sure way to piss him off when his controls don&#39;t work, and if he  <br/>
was told &quot;you&#39;re in control,&quot; and he figures out he&#39;s clearly not  <br/>
controlling everyone and everything around him, he might think less  <br/>
of you and your perceptions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Mostly I just want to help him learn to calm down, be patient, and  <br/>
whatever it is that he&#39;s mad about we can talk about and figure out.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You said he goes off &quot;fairly easily, and quite often.&quot;  Something&#39;s  <br/>
happening quite often before he goes off.<br/>
<br/>
With some kids it helps for the mom to ask them to help with the  <br/>
logistics of something, like if you&#39;re going out, ask him to help you  <br/>
remember what needs to go in the car, or whether you need to leave a  <br/>
note or make a phone call, or check to see if things are turned off  <br/>
(lights, stove, whatever).  Some kids aren&#39;t interested, but for  <br/>
those who are, it&#39;s a way for them to see what&#39;s involved in such  <br/>
things.  Don&#39;t make him responsible (not in any way in which he&#39;ll  <br/>
have failed if you forget something), but he could help out (if he  <br/>
wants).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do it in a condescending way, like a puzzle or a quiz.  Do it  <br/>
as you might with an adult friend:  &quot;What might I be forgetting?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know a lot of it is giving him more &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; than &quot;no&#39;s&quot;, but  <br/>
sometimes it seems like there&#39;s just not enough &quot;yes&#39;s&quot; for him.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Have you asked him, when he&#39;s calm?<br/>
<br/>
Does he have his own space in the house?  Is he getting to sleep  <br/>
where he wants to?  Is he made to sleep alone?  Do you wake him up  <br/>
before he&#39;s ready to wake up?  Is he needing more fruit, or more  <br/>
protein, or more exercise?  Is he getting a chance to run and climb  <br/>
and roll and jump?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Jim&#39;s first reaction was to yell and unfortunately state the  <br/>
opposite of how he actually felt, saying that he can&#39;t feel sympathy  <br/>
for someone who was &quot;asking for it,&quot;... -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why are you telling us that your husband stated the opposite of how  <br/>
he actually felt?  I don&#39;t want an answer on the list.  I want you to  <br/>
consider yourself, seriously, whether you also tell your kids that  <br/>
they have said something contrary to what they &quot;actually feel.&quot;   I&#39;m  <br/>
guessing your husband was actually angry, and was frustrated, and you  <br/>
didn&#39;t come in from the other room to help, but instead  you waited  <br/>
until there was something to yell about.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and he stated, &quot;Well, since we aren&#39;t making the kids listen to us  <br/>
anymore...&quot; , and I tried to quickly think of what he should have  <br/>
maybe done, so I said, &quot;Well, then get them involved in another  <br/>
activity to they aren&#39;t jumping anymore, &quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t get to think of what he should have done.<br/>
<br/>
Words are important.  You might make suggestions about what he might  <br/>
have done (and you did), but when you write to this list (or  <br/>
anywhere), look at the words you&#39;re using before you send it.  Think  <br/>
about what you&#39;re saying, which is representative of what you&#39;re  <br/>
thinking.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So as I thought about that, I eventually told him that there were  <br/>
at least three choices he could have made: Let them jump, ignoring  <br/>
them, and watch someone possibly get hurt and end up in the emergency  <br/>
room, (his fear) which takes up LOTS of time, or yell at them to stop  <br/>
and MAKE them, thus ignoring the style of parenting I&#39;m trying to  <br/>
incorporate-=-<br/>
<br/>
YOU need to incorporate it.  You can&#39;t deputize your husband and  <br/>
require him to do what you want him to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know I&#39;ve seen Sandra use the term &quot;and mean it&quot; a couple of times,<br/>
<br/>
and I read in an old post how she said to look the person in the eye,<br/>
and in that case remove an object the person was using for harm. But<br/>
what if the person is yelling mean things (like the kid in the car who<br/>
was backseat driving - what would you have done if they DIDN&#39;T stop?)-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t talking about my own children in that instance. I was  <br/>
talking about visitors.  I will protect and defend my children&#39;s  <br/>
peace and safety if it means sending someone out of my house, or  <br/>
limiting someone else&#39;s access to our family outings.  In a  <br/>
heartbeat, if a visitor (adult or child) doesn&#39;t care what I think  <br/>
about what&#39;s good or safe for my kids, they&#39;re not nearly as likely  <br/>
to be invited back.<br/>
<br/>
For me to have given an example of looking a person right in the eye  <br/>
in a particular situation doesn&#39;t mean in EVERY situation you use  <br/>
that aggressive tool, because it IS aggression, in primates.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-After playing outside for an hour, they always migrate towards the  <br/>
road or parking lot, and I end up picking them up and placing them  <br/>
back in our yard, only to repeat with the other one (twins.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Be out there with them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-After half a dozen times I simply take them indoors because they  <br/>
are focused only on that forbidden place,...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Take them somewhere where they can run around more. Don&#39;t limit them  <br/>
to wherever the dangerous place is they&#39;re playing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also felt bad last night when we went to the zoo for a halloween  <br/>
night. It&#39;s an hour away, and the babies don&#39;t do well with long  <br/>
drives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mornings seemed better for my kids, for long rides.    An hour&#39;s too  <br/>
far to go for Halloween activities.  Wait for Halloween, take them  <br/>
around the neighborhood, and come home.  No messy car rides required.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They also do this the few times we&#39;ve been to my parents&#39; home 3  <br/>
hours away.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get your parents to come to you.  For the price of gasoline for six  <br/>
hours of driving, you could get them a motel room if you don&#39;t have  <br/>
room at your place.  Go out to parks, fast-food, pizza places with  <br/>
play areas.  Find situations in which your kids will be smiley and  <br/>
happy and your parents can see them in joyful action, not a quiet  <br/>
visit-grandparents after a three hour car ride.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998202696">-=-I&#39;m wondering if you can find a mother&#39;s helper to go with you  <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
(like the zoo) Onlies work well or pre-teens who like little kids. You<br/>
could maybe pay them something but some might like to come just to go  <br/>
to the<br/>
zoo and help you. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
We used to easily find older kids or young adults to go to the zoo  <br/>
with us.  They didn&#39;t have an excuse if they didn&#39;t have kids, they  <br/>
felt.  (My own kids kept going to the zoo and will take their other  <br/>
late-teens/early adult friends with them sometimes, but some more  <br/>
self-conscious people might see the zoo as a kid-place.)<br/>

&quot;no limit.&quot; Which is why I started asking questions because I saw<br/>
limits and was curious how to make limits without being authoritarian.<br/>
I know it can be done as seen is this and other forums, but in<br/>
practice I&#39;m still working out the kinks.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of like when people describe APing and say, &quot;I don&#39;t do cry<br/>
it out...&quot; but don&#39;t add what they DO do (maybe)- nursing every few<br/>
hours throughout the night, co-sleep, nurse until the child is no<br/>

parents who do them.<br/>

I think for me I LIKED structure as a child, at least I grew to like<br/>
it. I still am more comfortable being told how to do something right,<br/>
even if I don&#39;t like it, because then I can&#39;t go wrong. So for me,<br/>
when rigid structures are removed, I have a hard time imagining the<br/>

that the older kids really WANT to go to these places, and ask us<br/>
often to go. We haven&#39;t gone as much because of the babies, but maybe<br/>
I need to see other ways of getting the older kids to go without me.<br/>
My desire to be with them may be less than their desire to be at the<br/>

When Karl was getting into talking, he got really irate at not being able to<br/>
express himself exactly the way he wanted to.  Result: after 6 months of<br/>
yelling and screaming about &quot;mess ups&quot; on the way to being able to, he got<br/>
really really good at it.  He was the same about pottying.  Absolutely<br/>
didn&#39;t want any help and of course it&#39;s more complicated than he&#39;s able to<br/>
handle alone.  Result: he&#39;s finally able to more to his satisfaction.<br/>
Playing games on the computer, terribly mad about his level of ability as<br/>
opposed to what he wants to be able to do.  Result: real good at it now.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when Karl was trying to figure out legos.  No help, thanks<br/>
anyway.  Ok just last week we bought him a bunch more legos and some<br/>
characters that he asked for.<br/>
<br/>
One thing about it is.. the kid really wants to excell and have it all be to<br/>
his own credit.  Understandable.  I was a kid who didn&#39;t and still doesn&#39;t<br/>
care about credit.  I liked doing stuff by myself and I think I got to<br/>
because I didn&#39;t ask for help or get frustrated easily (or the toy would be<br/>
taken from me).  Everybody&#39;s different.<br/>
<br/>
I work on keeping him filled up in other ways.  Suggesting breaks when I<br/>
think he&#39;s willing to hear it or just saying I&#39;m going outside, wanna come?<br/>
or I wanna play frisbee, how bout you? Going out to pet the cats, want to<br/>
come? (I still get a lot of no&#39;s on breaks but he sometimes takes a much<br/>
needed one.)  Plenty on offer to eat (google monkey platters on<br/>
sandradodd.com if you haven&#39;t already).<br/>

Outside of the definition of what was &quot;right,&quot; how could you have  <br/>

I hope that statement above doesn&#39;t mean you want us to spoonfeed you  <br/>
how to &quot;do unschooling right,&quot; because that&#39;s not possible to do.   <br/>
You will need to internalize it to the point that it&#39;s a part of you.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a structure.  When you remove a structure, there  <br/>
won&#39;t BE another structure unless you create one, and principles are  <br/>
better than &quot;structures.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104071683">A couple of things that can help until you are able to internalize<br/>
unschooling principles are reading as much as you can and gathering as many<br/>
practical (how to) ideas for implementing the principles you are reading<br/>
about.  Read. Try an idea out to implement some or all of the principles.<br/>
Then read some more, implement more how-to&#39;s (like having monkey platters on<br/>
hand for everyone to eat from; and if you read about those you&#39;ll discover<br/>
than some larger families skip platters and keep a whole buffet going<br/>
throughout the day for all those people to pick from), read some more about<br/>
the principles.<br/>
<br/>
All this activity will fine tune your understanding of how unschooling works<br/>
in your family.  Doing will get you further than thinking but both are<br/>
needed to make unschooling happen for you.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much harder for someone to tailor make the unschooling experience for<br/>
others.  It&#39;s not enough information to realistically build unschooling from<br/>
scratch into a new family.  It&#39;s hard since every family is different and<br/>
the way they live out their lives and the things they believe (other than<br/>
unschooling principles) are going to interact in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
Picking that apart is hard to do for one&#39;s *own* self.  Picking it apart for<br/>
someone else isn&#39;t very doable and it&#39;s more likely than anything else to<br/>
make you feel that unschooling won&#39;t work for *you* when in fact it would if<br/>
you could incorporate it yourself, and then you would know it works... no<br/>
question about it, because you will have experienced it.<br/>

&gt;  &gt; Okay.  Where is this advice to lift all the barriers?  I need to go<br/>
&gt;  &gt; and put pointers to warnings everywhere.  Please, seriously, where<br/>
&gt;  &gt; are the ideas coming from that are causing this chaos?<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  For me, it was my own assumptions when I saw &quot;give choices,&quot; I thought<br/>
&gt;  &quot;no limit.&quot; Which is why I started asking questions because I saw<br/>
&gt;  limits and was curious how to make limits without being authoritarian.<br/>
&gt;  I know it can be done as seen is this and other forums, but in<br/>
&gt;  practice I&#39;m still working out the kinks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s kind of like when people describe APing and say, &quot;I don&#39;t do cry<br/>
&gt;  it out...&quot; but don&#39;t add what they DO do (maybe)- nursing every few<br/>
&gt;  hours throughout the night, co-sleep, nurse until the child is no<br/>
&gt;  longer interested.  You find those things out as you talk to other<br/>
&gt;  parents who do them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I think for me I LIKED structure as a child, at least I grew to like<br/>
&gt;  it. I still am more comfortable being told how to do something right,<br/>
&gt;  even if I don&#39;t like it, because then I can&#39;t go wrong. So for me,<br/>
&gt;  when rigid structures are removed, I have a hard time imagining the<br/>
&gt;  structures still in place, and aren&#39;t sure where they are or how they<br/>
&gt;  work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Does that make sense?<br/>

problem. I was trying to state what you stated about two different<br/>
needs that don&#39;t necessarily work well together.<br/>
<br/>
But I did realize while raking the leaves this afternoon many<br/>
different things, one of which is that I&#39;m still asking questions that<br/>
don&#39;t lend well to answers because I&#39;m essentially asking, &quot;How do I<br/>
cut off my hand without severing it from my body?&quot; I CAN&#39;T be a<br/>
mindful parent if I&#39;m purposely putting my kids in situations where<br/>
they will most likely be unhappy, for whatever reason. Even if it&#39;s a<br/>
&quot;good&quot; reason (*I* want to be able to enjoy the zoo with my whole<br/>
family), it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Same with my son in the toy aisle. He didn&#39;t *have* to be with me that<br/>
day. *I* chose that. Not him. The question isn&#39;t how to keep him calm<br/>
*after* being there, it&#39;s *why* was I there with him in the first<br/>
place if I knew he might react that way?<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of focusing on the positive instead of negative is a<br/>
huge thing for me, and the mind shift is happening, slowly...bit by bit.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223899971">This was part of a post I sent back because the poster had only just  <br/>
joined the list.<br/>
Please, new members, read a while (on this list or any list) to get a  <br/>
feel for the list.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem to  me to be aimed toward attentive parenting:<br/>
<br/>
-=-In addition, just another perspective, perhaps your son just has a  <br/>
*need* to cry (at those moments), just to cry and cry loudly and let  <br/>
whatever he is feeling out. Perhaps you could try just being there,  <br/>
hugging him if he wants, listening when he speaks, without talking,  <br/>
without offering solutions, without asking questions, but just  <br/>
validating his feelings by being a supportive  presence to him.   <br/>
Maybe *his* method of &#39;calming down&#39; is crying loudly--not taking  <br/>
deep breaths,  or whatever other strategy you or someone else thinks  <br/>
*should* work.  Whatever he is doing (crying loudly) is working for  <br/>
*him* in that moment--maybe just try and be *with* him at those  <br/>
times.  If he looks at you,fine, if he doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s ok.  If he  <br/>
wants to run around screaming that&#39;s ok too.  If he runs up the  <br/>
stairs to his room and wants to be alone that&#39;s ok too.  Ykwim?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not all feelings are equally valid, and sometimes the validity of a  <br/>
child&#39;s feelings involve the mom understanding how her own behavior  <br/>
might be the cause of the frustration.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  If he looks at you,fine, if he doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s ok. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Certainly.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If he wants to run around screaming that&#39;s ok too.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not if it&#39;s 11:00 at night and you live in an apartment building, or  <br/>
if other people are asleep.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If he runs up the stairs to his room and wants to be alone that&#39;s  <br/>
ok too.  Ykwim?--=-<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean, but it doesn&#39;t seem good advice to help someone  <br/>
move toward better unschooling and mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe *his* method of &#39;calming down&#39; is crying loudly--not taking  <br/>
deep breaths,  or whatever other strategy you or someone else thinks  <br/>
*should* work. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Crying to the point of exhaustion can be helpful.  One gets too tired  <br/>
to cry, and the adrenaline has been spent, and I&#39;ve read that there&#39;s  <br/>
some thought that once tears of frustration build up, it can be  <br/>
physically cleansing for them to come out.  I don&#39;t know the details  <br/>
of that.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that slow, deep breaths will slow heart rate, which will  <br/>
all by itself, immediately, be calming.  Less adrenaline will pump.   <br/>
More oxygen will go into the blood and cells.  Adrenaline can abate  <br/>
without the exhaustion that comes from crying until one&#39;s throat is  <br/>
sore.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not &quot;what someone else thinks *should* work.&quot;  Please try not  <br/>
to dismiss experience in that way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Whatever he is doing (crying loudly) is working for *him* in that  <br/>
moment--=-<br/>
<br/>
This is not necessarily true, nor safe, nor wise.  Infants who cry  <br/>
want to be picked up, maybe nursed, maybe rocked.  That crying loudly  <br/>
is not &quot;working for him in that moment&quot; in the case of a baby, and  <br/>
we&#39;re talking toddlers.  I have a sixteen year old daughter.  If  <br/>
she&#39;s crying loudly, something is NOT working for her in that moment.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s much harder for someone to tailor make the unschooling experience for<br/>
&gt; others.  It&#39;s not enough information to realistically build unschooling<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; scratch into a new family.  It&#39;s hard since every family is different and<br/>
&gt; the way they live out their lives and the things they believe (other than<br/>
&gt; unschooling principles) are going to interact in different ways.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Picking that apart is hard to do for one&#39;s *own* self.  Picking it apart<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; someone else isn&#39;t very doable and it&#39;s more likely than anything else to<br/>
&gt; make you feel that unschooling won&#39;t work for *you* when in fact it would<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt; you could incorporate it yourself, and then you would know it works... no<br/>
&gt; question about it, because you will have experienced it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 OK, this is gonna sound totally weird. But it&#39;s *our* path...<br/>
<br/>
We did elimination communication, which is the idea that a baby is perfectly<br/>
capable, from birth, of telling you when they have to potty. I&#39;ve done it<br/>
with all three of my children. It sounds weird to people who haven&#39;t done<br/>
it, but it&#39;s pretty much how most of the world deals with baby eliminations.<br/>
The baby signals, you hold them over a receptacle, they do their thing, and<br/>
everyone&#39;s happy. No wetness on baby, no mess for parent, no potty<br/>
&quot;training&quot; ever... it&#39;s this hugely respectful, symbiotic thing.<br/>
<br/>
At this stage, never having diapered, and always having EC&#39;d, I cannot even<br/>
begin to describe the process of &quot;how does it work?&quot; because it just does.<br/>
It&#39;s part of the rhythm of our days. I can give some guidelines, some<br/>
frameworks, some generalities, but I can&#39;t tell you how it would work with<br/>
your baby, because there&#39;s no way I can know what the symbiosis is between<br/>
you and each baby you have (and it&#39;s been different with all three of mine).<br/>
I can explain to you that it did work, with all three, I can give you<br/>
examples of what I saw and what I did, and what they did, but just because<br/>
Rowan blew raspberries when he had to go, and Aurora grunts, and Kestrel<br/>
kicked his heels against me, doesn&#39;t mean that your kid won&#39;t do something<br/>
completely different, but equally valid. I can&#39;t know what, and I can&#39;t tell<br/>
you what. You have to figure that out yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Which is probably why unschooling seems like such a natural thing. I really<br/>
believe that parents and children are hard-wired to do amazing things<br/>
together, provided we can shut out the noise of the culture and just tune in<br/>
to each other&#39;s needs.<br/>

The answer you think you need is too narrow and small.  What we&#39;re  <br/>
trying to give you is the bigger picture, the ideas, the under- <br/>

My college boyfriend grew up in India and said they were never in  <br/>
diapers, he or his four siblings.  Two were born in New Jersey, and  <br/>
their mom didn&#39;t do the diaper thing here either, although  he said  <br/>
it was easier in India where she made a little potty with her feet,  <br/>
over the floor toilet/hole, for them to go in.    It wouldn&#39;t work  <br/>
here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was my initial reaction too!  It doesn&#39;t even have to be a fence<br/>
either, any sort of barrier would work combined with something<br/>
enormously enticing in the other direction.  When Margaux was a baby and<br/>
I had a garden, she wouldn&#39;t ever stay on her large blanket with toys,<br/>
she wanted to eat dirt, so instead of fighting the issue, I put cheerios<br/>
all over her blanket.  After that, she never strayed off the blanket to<br/>
eat dirt!  She happily foraged on her blanket.<br/>
<br/>
She was probably younger than the babies being discussed, but the same<br/>
idea can work.  The babes clearly want to get around, give them a place<br/>
to go, a baby maze of sorts that keeps them occupied and happy.</div>
