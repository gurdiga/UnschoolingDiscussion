<div id="ygrps-yiv-482978677">I would take them for some walks about the area during the day so people see <br/>
that they are home during the day and maybe visit the businesses in the area. <br/>
The businesses may not be told due to personal rights of the children so maybe <br/>
in they know by seeing you all or them asking they may not call next time.<br/>
I dont know the laws there but I cant imagine keeping my son in the yard all <br/>
day.  Your children have rights also. They where not truant and who says they <br/>
have to stay at home all day?<br/>
Call someone in your state that knows the laws well and get the skinny then <br/>
you will feel free to be.<br/>

    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t frequent the list a lot, as I&#39;m usually to busy to <br/>
participate.  However, today I got a scare and I need to share and <br/>
get some imput.  <br/>
     My boys 6 & 7 y/o went out today to feed and water the dogs, <br/>
when they finished they came back in and asked to play outdoors.  I <br/>
had no problem with that, so out they went.  However, today they <br/>
decided to venture out the gate (without permission).  We live in <br/>
the village and own the property between 2 streets.  They went out <br/>
the back on the less traveled street and next door onto the edge of <br/>
the parking lot of a local business.  Someone at that business <br/>
called the police and the police picked the boys up and came to the <br/>
door.  For some reason the boys told the officer I wasn&#39;t home, <br/>
probably not wanting to get into trouble.  He said if he didn&#39;t find <br/>
me at home he was going to call FIA.  Then he started complaining <br/>
that they aren&#39;t in school and don&#39;t know anything, etc, etc.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing and what was happening, as the <br/>
boys hadn&#39;t been outside more than 10 to 15 minutes.  He wanted <br/>
their names, ages, my name and phone number and how many kids I had, <br/>
I gave him the info. and told him they were privately schooled (we <br/>
live in Michigan).  I&#39;m not sure if I should have gave him that <br/>
info., as I couldn&#39;t think at the time.  He gave me and the boys a <br/>
lecture and finally let them out of his car for me to take inside.  <br/>
I kept telling him I needed to go, as I had an infant that was <br/>
sleeping inside, but he kept going on and on.<br/>
     The thing that gets me is our society expects children to be <br/>
locked up between certain hours of the day and if kids are out <br/>
during that time frame, people get up in arms about it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to feel like I have to lock my kids up during school hours, but <br/>
I don&#39;t like dealing with situations like what happened today either.<br/>
     There&#39;s some kids my sons age that runs all over town, all of <br/>
the time,outside of school hours and the police never pick them up.  <br/>
They walk across town to play with my kids, because I won&#39;t let my <br/>
kids outside the yard without supervision.  Here I am, the cautious <br/>
parent and I get hasseled just because my kids happened to venture <br/>
outside the gate during school hours.  My husband just happened to <br/>
be on the part of his mail route that comes near our home when he <br/>
saw the officer leaving.  He came home worried something had <br/>
happened to one of us, only to find out the above.  He wasn&#39;t only <br/>
up-set that the boys left the yard without permission, but that the <br/>
police were even called.  Why do people feel they need to meddle?  <br/>
Now, I feel like I can&#39;t let my kids outside during the day, even in <br/>
their own yard and I&#39;m worried this officer is going to watch our <br/>
place and call FIA if he see the kids out to often, so I&#39;m <br/>
frustrated!  What would you do?  I want to move now.<br/>

<br/>
Are you sure?<br/>
Maybe they&#39;ve been picked up once and talked to about how to avoid it in <br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They went out <br/>
<br/>
the back on the less traveled street and next door onto the edge of <br/>
<br/>
the parking lot of a local business.  Someone at that business <br/>
<br/>
called the police and the police picked the boys up and came to the <br/>
<br/>
door. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Six and seven is really young to be out without adults, isn&#39;t it?  Not that <br/>
school kids aren&#39;t walking home at that age, but not very far, and there are <br/>
others around and crossing guards (in some towns anyway; we have them here).<br/>
<br/>
Were the people at the business afraid the kids might do damage to cars or <br/>
windows?  Were they playing with rocks?  Had they asked the boys to go home?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He wasn&#39;t only <br/>
<br/>
up-set that the boys left the yard without permission, but that the <br/>
<br/>
police were even called.  Why do people feel they need to meddle?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If there were boys on your property and you didn&#39;t really want them there, <br/>
would you ask them to leave?  If you chose to call someone and reporte it, would <br/>
you consider it meddling in their lives?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now, I feel like I can&#39;t let my kids outside during the day, even in <br/>
<br/>
their own yard and I&#39;m worried this officer is going to watch our <br/>
<br/>
place and call FIA if he see the kids out to often, so I&#39;m <br/>
<br/>
frustrated!  What would you do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would tell the kids to stay in the yard until other kids were out of school <br/>
until they got older.<br/>
<br/>
When my older kids have gone out of earshot of the house, I&#39;ve sent a 3x5 <br/>
card with them, with their names and addresses, my name and phone number, and it <br/>
says &quot;Kirby (or whoever) is homeschooled and has my permission to be <br/>
(wherever).&quot;  I got my kids state ID cards (Kirby&#39;s got punched as no longer his <br/>
primary ID this morning when he got his provisional driver&#39;s license), because some <br/>
things require a student ID or picture ID, so I figured a state ID was the <br/>
coolest thing anyway, since it looks like a driver&#39;s license.<br/>
<br/>
My guess on the policeman&#39;s questions was that he was doing a routine job, <br/>
trying to scare them a bit about being out and trying (possibly) to impress on <br/>
you the importance of knowing where they are all the time.  If they were <br/>
evasive or didn&#39;t answer his questions fully and truly, he was right to be <br/>
suspicious.  They said you weren&#39;t home and you were; did they avoid telling other <br/>
things?  Did they know their phone number and all that?<br/>
<br/>
People forget the trouble kids can (and do) get into walking back and forth <br/>
from school.  But during school hours if school-aged kids are out in parking <br/>
lots or other places where kids aren&#39;t usually, it&#39;s assumed they&#39;re not where <br/>
they&#39;re supposed to be.   How many years have &quot;school hours&quot; been part of <br/>
people&#39;s language?  More than two generations.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth moving or being really frustrated about.<br/>

wandering my street without an adult in the vicinity.  Too many things can happen to <br/>
children. It&#39;s our job to protect them and keep them safe.<br/>
<br/>
I walk to school every single day with an 11 year old and a 5 year old who <br/>
don&#39;t have other adults to accompany them.<br/>
<br/>
I can also understand store owners being concerned about young children out <br/>
and about and playing in front of their store.  How many customers do you think <br/>
asked him whose kids they were and he/she didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I also can understand two little boys slipping away to play while Mom is <br/>
occupied with something else.  However I wouldn&#39;t blame others and wonder what was <br/>
wrong with THEM that they were concerned about my children.  I&#39;d be thankful <br/>
they were fine and that nothing, including my children had been hurt.  I&#39;d be <br/>
grateful someone took the time to call and make sure my children got home <br/>
safely.  I&#39;d be embarrassed that I didn&#39;t have a better watchful eye on them.  I&#39;d <br/>
talk to them about the importance of staying where I can see/hear them or <br/>
respecting their own property and not upsetting someone as to call the police on <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
In my County you might have been arrested for neglect.  It happens a couple <br/>
times a year when a younger child wanders out of their yard and the Mom/dad <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to even notice the children missing.  The call it neglect and it <br/>
gets ugly for the parents, name in the paper, CPS involved, real ugly.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much that the children were out of the yard but that <br/>
you didn&#39;t know they were missing that probably sent up some kind of warning <br/>
signal that made the officer ask so many questions.  It takes awhile of loitering <br/>
before someone calls to report children to the police and takes time for the <br/>
officer to respond and question the boys, all the while no mother comes <br/>
calling or looking for them.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably what they were so interested in.  I&#39;d say they did their job.<br/>

<br/>
  Robin, I feel for you. It most have been a heck of a scare.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, 6-7 year olds walking across town!?!? That&#39;s odd. Still, I live in <br/>
  NYC and have little knowledge of the comings and goings of people in <br/>
  the rest of the US. As they say, there is NYC and then there is the US <br/>
  :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I think that the best thing you can do is walkwalkwalk EVERYWHERE <br/>
  EVERYDAY with your kids. Here in my little piece of the Big Apple, <br/>
  everybody and their mother knows my family. They may not know our <br/>
  names, but I have people recognize me in other parts of town as the mom <br/>
  with the two boys that go everywhere together. In a city where nobody <br/>
  knows even your face, everybody knows us. They know we homeschool, they <br/>
  know we are around. They expect to see us around. We took a <br/>
  mini-vacation this past week and people noticed our absence.<br/>
<br/>
  It has always been important for me that my kids have a strong sense of <br/>
  community and that means, knowing our postman, grocers, pharmacists, <br/>
  area policemen, firemen, area nannies, building supers, etc. <br/>
  Unschooling for us is an opportunity to not just be out and about in <br/>
  our neighborhood but to live fully in it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But they walk in groups and there are other adults out and about and school <br/>
people looking at for them right?<br/>
<br/>
I live in a fairly small town as well, but kids just out alone are not a <br/>
common occurrence.<br/>
<br/>
We do have one &quot;child&quot; who is now probably 18 that basically the neighborhood <br/>
raised since he was probably five. He was/is an oddity, everyone looked out <br/>
for him and whispered under their breath about the &quot;poor child&quot; and his lack of <br/>
caring parents.<br/>
<br/>
At ten he would be found five miles out in town at night on his bicycle <br/>
ordering a child&#39;s meal from the Ruby Tuesdays eating alone.  Some kind neighbor <br/>
would put the bike in their car and drive him back home in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
The police took this kid home so much they got tired of it.  Ten years ago <br/>
our Police Force was kinder, today they have no patience for that kind of thing <br/>
and parents get in big trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the kid who &quot;raised&quot; himself, he&#39;s gets plenty of attention these days <br/>
from the police force, he&#39;s their guest for the third time in two years, this <br/>
time for about 18 months.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that young children do play in our neighborhood, but there are <br/>
always parents who are in the yard, on the porch, in the kitchen with the door <br/>
open.  Maybe because we are in a residential neighborhood and no commercial <br/>
activity goes on it&#39;s more tolerated.  Maybe they figure if you&#39;re on your street <br/>
and your Mom knows where you are it&#39;s OK.  If they wander much farther than <br/>
their own street, someone is likely to call someone and usually not the parent.<br/>

wold send us 2 miles to the shops to fetch her fags n milk. She never <br/>
had a doubt that it wasn&#39;t perfectly safe. I started letting Heather <br/>
play out the front of my house when she was 7 as long as she didn&#39;t <br/>
leave the pavement (sidewalk) and go past a certain lampost. Now she&#39;s <br/>
11 I would be sending her to the shops either walking or on the bus if <br/>
Stepford had either shops or buses.<br/>
I suppose back then there weren&#39;t any cars - well, not in the UK. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know anyone with a car until I was 15 and a neighbour bought one <br/>
which we all went to look at. The roads were safe for kids to go out <br/>
cycling all day with a pack of sandwhiches.<br/>
We certainly walked home from school alone from the age of 5.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad that we&#39;ve lost so much freedom in the Age of the Car :-(<br/>

No, the little buggers just go as they please.  Some have moms working in<br/>
the shops on main street and walk there after school.  Country kids take<br/>
the busses.  Kids on the west side take the busses when it&#39;s cold, but<br/>
when it&#39;s not they can go into the J&J Variety store and get candy for a<br/>
nickle and stop at the river and throw rocks.  Kids with big brothers and<br/>
sisters walk from the elementary school to the high school (six or seven<br/>
blocks) to ride home with them.   One little dude lives up our street,<br/>
walks to and from school every day.  His name is Jason, he&#39;s six and he<br/>
walks nine blocks.  Maybe he picks up a friend on his way, I don&#39;t know. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There must of been some weirdos. ie. Myra Hinckley in the 60&#39;s who <br/>
murdered a number of children. I also remember an announcement at school <br/>
assembly when I was 7 or 8 of a weirdo pretending to be a policeman to <br/>
abduct kids.<br/>
All the statistics say that child abductions and murders haven&#39;t risen <br/>
in 30 years, its just that we have become aware of them. Children are <br/>
more likely to be murdered by a family member than by a stranger. This <br/>
doesn&#39;t stop us feeling paranoid though, and I have to be careful not to <br/>
allow it to control me or my kids. I&#39;m more concerned with traffic <br/>
danger. There are a million times more cars out there and they drive <br/>
faster and less attentively :-(<br/>
I&#39;m forever telling my neighbours to slow down cos kids are playing. <br/>

of scary tragedies to fill each day, not caring whether they happened down<br/>
the street or across the country.  There were no abducted children from<br/>

(our Town President, who is now serving a nice long prison sentence for <br/>
insurance fraud, lovely, eh?) have passed laws that no one else would uphold, and the <br/>
challenges just don&#39;t come very often.  We have anti-gang legislation, but not <br/>
anti-loitering.  We have curfews, but the cops break more laws than the <br/>
citizens do.  We have had State Police here because the local cops just couldn&#39;t <br/>
get it together.  It&#39;s CRAZY.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in Cicero, IL.  Craziest town in Chicagoland.  Gangsta city, and we&#39;re <br/>
talking mobster gangster-old school.  We have a new Town President, but it <br/>
looks like he&#39;s a puppet, too.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gettting better, but we&#39;re definitely wierd here.  Sometimes I just zone <br/>
because it&#39;s too crazy to think about it all the time.  And because officials <br/>
in the school system regularly lie to people and tell them homeschooling is <br/>
illegal, we don&#39;t have a lot of them, and we all keep a very low profile.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336465004">Actually, in wild frontier Texas  :-)   it was the anti-loitering laws of the 70&#39;s  that were not upheld and then morphed into juvenile curfew laws.........both night time and daytime.    First  in &quot;adult&quot;  entertainment districts, then in specially defined communities,  and finally  city wide and county wide.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the adults who were ALSO  targeted by the anti-loitering ordinances.......the concept is  continuously tweaked.   Either by having total nighttime curfews on &quot;public&quot; property or by more and more creative versions of &quot;camping&quot;   or  &quot;sleeping in a public place&quot;  or  &quot;interfering with a business enterprise&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Is California still actually using the term &quot;loitering&quot;.   Do they include having proper identification and  proof of a certain level of financial access among  the defenses to prosecution?<br/>

rights dunt we have?<br/>
Some European countries are working hard at full rights for kids, even <br/>
the UK. They all signed the Children&#39;s Rights Act. Arch works hard in <br/>
the UK challenging things like curfews for under 16&#39;s and various other <br/>
Big Brother tactics.<br/>

understand why children would need rights. Big Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.<br/>
