~&quot;Or,alternatively, what an unschool lifestyle is all<br/>
about.  I  really work on acceptance....I just want<br/>
some friends!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
i can so  relate to this, but don&#39;t give up... they&#39;re out there.   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

We get together when we can and e mail often.   It is a lot of work <br/>
to stay in touch.  I started the NCUnschoolers yahoo  list so that the <br/>
unschoolers from around the state could be &quot;in touch&quot;.   That has been a<br/>
tremendous <br/>
help.  I do drive a lot but it has been worth  it, making friends across<br/>
the <br/>
state. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,,, <br/>
 <br/>
I know that&#39;s part of it for me...the alienation from school(and<br/>
&#39;school-parents&#39;) friends as well as from school-at-home types.  I can<br/>
relate to the  &quot;I just want some friends&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
I recently opened up the issues with a friend/parent who started her<br/>
child in all day kindergarten this year.  We are sad for them, and I<br/>
(naturally) think it is practically criminal to stick a five year old is<br/>
school all day!<br/>
<br/>
The mom thinks we can maintain a friendship as long as we respect each<br/>
other&#39;s choices.  This can get difficult for me...what did someone say<br/>
about longing to have them truly &#39;see&#39; what school does and is.  I had<br/>
told her about some parents who decided their children couldn&#39;t come<br/>
over to play because they want to be taken out of school, and being<br/>
around others who have that opportunity, and live it joyfully, causes<br/>
strife for weeks in their household.  The Mom I talked to says she<br/>
thinks the world of my children, and &#39;as long as they don&#39;t speak<br/>
negatively about how (her dd) is schooled, that she thinks they will<br/>
maintain the friendship.&quot;  But honestly, my children do feel negatively<br/>
about school...and are happy with our lifestyle.  So even without<br/>
verbalizing it, they can cause others to question their lifestyle.  I<br/>
guess it&#39;s possible to have some relationship, though it will have<br/>
enough necessary differences due to scheduling, etc, already; plus one<br/>
more topic that is basically &#39;off limits&#39; along with religion and<br/>
politics!<br/>
<br/>
Also, regarding what Pam said about lots of driving - I think that works<br/>
for lots.  It has been hard for me due to a basically homebody<br/>
preference; in addition to having four children and one on the way, plus<br/>
trying to be frugal with transportation costs.....but it&#39;s worth a<br/>
re-examine to find what works for the youngsters.  I also like the idea<br/>
of a weekly play plan, though vaguely tried that last year...it fizzled;<br/>
so I thought I&#39;d try the club idea....must get over that &#39;fear of<br/>
failure&#39; issue and dive in!!<br/>

Another thing that we (me and an unschooling friend) was to start a free  <br/>
day.  WE started out calling it that because the kids wouldn&#39;t come there  to <br/>
study.  We found a local boys and girls club, they have after school  programs <br/>
for school kids but the facility wasn&#39;t used during the day.  They  had a gym <br/>
and gym type equipment, pool tables, computers, fooz ball table, table  hockey, <br/>
games, tables and chairs, bumper pool.  We hammered out  arrangements for <br/>
price per child and basically we had the gym to ourselves with  the agreement that <br/>
we would be out in time for their after school program and we  would clean up <br/>
after ourselves.  <br/>
 <br/>
It worked out great.  WE opened it up to all homeschool kids and found  that <br/>
unschoolers were the only ones with a free enough schedule to come.   LOL it <br/>
started off slow but by the end of the year we had 30 kids coming.   The thing <br/>
that was better than a park day was that we came even if it was  raining, and <br/>
even older kids enjoyed.  It was so nice to see all ages  playing together.  <br/>
The kids would go from one game to another as they  liked.  We had no <br/>
preplanned games or activities it was up to the kids what  they did.  Some kids would <br/>
draw while others would just shoot the basket  ball around.  Then more would <br/>
join in on the basketball and some would go  play something else.  Very free and <br/>
nice.  I drove about 25 minutes  but we had some that would drive about 1 1/2 <br/>
hours to come.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just another thought,<br/>
