<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469070252">Hi LeeAnn.  The Scope and Sequence is a list of &quot;Typical Course <br/>
Study&quot; broken down by grade level and subject.  There are different <br/>
place to obtain this however, they are pretty much all the same.  I <br/>
think the best place to get it is:<br/>
<br/>
    www.worldbook.com/ptrc/hyml/curr1.htm<br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that this list is a &quot;Typical Course Study&quot; that <br/>
the ps system thinks should be taught.  This is where I ran into <br/>
troubles.  It is however a good place to get started.  If your child <br/>
is a hands on learner like mine you may find it difficult to follow <br/>
this exactly.  I have found that asking questions from people who <br/>
have been doing this for a long time is the best.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your adventure.</div>
