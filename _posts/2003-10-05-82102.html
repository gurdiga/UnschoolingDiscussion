<div id="ygrps-yiv-525760907">I&#39;d be willing to bet that the majority of those adults were raised<br/>
having <br/>
to do chores and other things they preferred not to do.  Nobody gave them<br/>
<br/>
the option of not doing them as they were growing up.  Once they were &quot;in<br/>
<br/>
charge&quot; they decided not to.  I figure it&#39;s better to have them deciding <br/>
that when they&#39;re younger and it doesn&#39;t matter much.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You really think? Because most of the one&#39;s I&#39;ve met personally seem to<br/>
have the kind of parent relationships that are absent, either in spirit<br/>
or body. They&#39;ve never had it modelled even, or at the opposite end, had<br/>
great modlers as parents and other adults can&#39;t understand how the kids<br/>
turned out that way. Obviously if the kid grows up to be truly<br/>
abandoning, there was a gap somewhere in that &quot;great modeling&quot; the<br/>
parents did, but outsiders cant&#39; always tell.<br/>
You all seem so confident...I don&#39;t hear many of you questioning what you<br/>
are doing or worrying about the future. <br/>

<br/>
Why have my sons defer their lives and their potential to the future <br/>
when they can be their potential now? I taught college for 7 years and <br/>
still give lectures to high school and college kids and they look so <br/>
... lost. There is always the one or two who know why they are there. <br/>
They know why they are there because college is a complement to their <br/>
lives, not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
In our society we tell kids that they are not whole yet. Our whole <br/>
culture of parenting is based on tomorrow. We tell our kids that they <br/>
are not really persons but the potential of a person. That once they <br/>
&quot;get educated&quot;, &quot;turn 21&quot;, &quot;finish college&quot;, &quot;get the great <br/>
jobs/car/spouse/house/kids&quot;, then they are real people.<br/>
<br/>
What about now?<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t they complete now? Aren&#39;t they real people now?<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to talk for all on this list, but if there is one thing <br/>
that unschooling has given me (and it has given me more than one) is <br/>
the daily reminder to look at my children as the people they are now. <br/>
That means that yesterday is not now. Not even 5 minutes ago is now. <br/>
Now is now. By being present to who our children are, as complete human <br/>
beings, we can then witness their potentiality unfold.<br/>
<br/>
No, there is no need to worry about the future.<br/>
What&#39;s important is now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Marty (14) went to a weeklong Junior Police Academy last summer.<br/>
He worked REALLY hard, the officers who were running it liked him, he had a <br/>
great time.<br/>
<br/>
The night of the graduation there was a dinner, and I went late to one of the <br/>
officers to thank him for working with Marty.   He bragged Marty up big, just <br/>
GUSHING, and then he said something like &quot;You can always tell when a child is <br/>
from a house with a lot of discipline and rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I smiled and tried to say politely that we didn&#39;t really have many rules at <br/>
all, but it wasn&#39;t the time or place to explain it all.  So I didn&#39;t agree <br/>
(&quot;Yes you can!&quot;) because he was QUITE wrong, you can&#39;t.  And HE had totally <br/>
mis-imagined the reasons for Marty&#39;s enthusiasm and cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
People look at a result and they say (sometimes internally and sometimes out <br/>
there with words) &quot;Obviously your parents didn&#39;t discipline you&quot; but in my <br/>
experience (long and nosy experience) discipline screws up way more people than <br/>
it helps.   When I see someone who&#39;s twisted and sadistic and dishonest, my <br/>
first thought isn&#39;t neglect, but over-discipline.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, for dozens of reasons I&#39;ve tried to share openly, I have <br/>
become quite confident, I don&#39;t question the larger goals and principle of what <br/>
I&#39;m doing, and I&#39;m not worried about the future.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight my father-in-law and my husband&#39;s oldest brother went with me and <br/>
Holly to see Kirby at work, because he had left before they arrived, and he won&#39;t <br/>
be going to the balloon fiesta with them tomorrow.   Kirby was <br/>
&quot;on&quot;--responsible, organized, funny--and they got to see him get a tournament going with 39 <br/>
participants.  It was a Magic: The Gathering draft tournament (that will mean <br/>
something to some of the people here, but not all).  The 39 entrants ranged in <br/>
age from 11 to their 40s, but everyone was fully attentive to Kirby&#39;s <br/>
directions (he&#39;s 17, but getting to that age where you can&#39;t really tell, kinda <br/>
16-to-20&#39;s looking).   <br/>
<br/>
I called him at 11:30 to ask him to be extra quiet when he comes home.  He <br/>
usually gets off at 1:00 a.m. and then cleans for 20 minutes or so.  He said he <br/>
will be really late, because they&#39;re two nearly hour-long rounds from the end, <br/>
and it could be as late as 3:00 or 4:00 before they clean up after all that.  <br/>
But he&#39;ll definitely not wake his grandpa up.<br/>
<br/>
He became responsible without growing up with a lot of discipline and rules.  <br/>

<br/>
Liza, that whole &quot;now&quot; post was glorious.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight Holly&#39;s Uncle Gerry, who is 55, was going on (as the kids knew he <br/>
would do) about something paternalish and philosophical.  Holly was trying not to <br/>
just laugh.  He was telling her now she was getting to the age that her <br/>
opinions and ideas would start to count and be heard, and she would get to make her <br/>
own decisions.   She said her ideas already did count, and he said but he <br/>
didn&#39;t mean about little unimportant things.  <br/>
<br/>
Then *I* was trying not to laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Gerry takes it pretty well that we keep telling him he&#39;s going to lose so he <br/>
might as well just give up.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, at dinner, he was saying his oldest son thought he could just stay <br/>
home after high school, get a part time job, and live at the house without <br/>
paying rent, but he/dad-who-doesn&#39;t-live-there anymore but isn&#39;t divorced, said <br/>
no, he could only earn staying home by going to college.  Without going to <br/>
school, he couldn&#39;t live at home.<br/>
<br/>
Gerry is addressing at that moment me, Brett who just turned 18 yesterday and <br/>
is unschooled, Marty who&#39;s 14, Holly who&#39;s 11, and Keith who is ever more <br/>
confident about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He said his son considered him some sort of ogre.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said &quot;I think you&#39;re an ogre too,&quot; but he wasn&#39;t really listening to <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody was going to agree with him and I said so.   He just laughed and said <br/>
he guessed he wouldn&#39;t get much agreement from this group.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It might depend what area of the country you&#39;re in. Control is a natural<br/>
tool to use on others so it&#39;s a natural parenting tool. Really tight control<br/>
is probably more prevalent in the Bible Belt. Neglect, on the other hand, is<br/>
caused by other factors: personal problems, poor priorities, lack of<br/>
knowledge of options when you don&#39;t want to use control.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, neither controlling or neglectful parents are using unschooling<br/>
principles to parent so their results aren&#39;t going to be applicable.<br/>
<br/>
If we treat people with respect they&#39;re likely to return the respect. Same<br/>
goes for children because they&#39;re people too even though in this society<br/>
they&#39;re often treated as less-than-adults. :-/<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You all seem so confident...I don&#39;t hear many of you questioning what you<br/>
&gt; are doing or worrying about the future.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well there&#39;s a thread on screw ups on the Unschooling.com message board if<br/>
that&#39;s any help to you! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t question whether unschooling works any more. I&#39;ve already spent lots<br/>
and lots of time doing that! But I do spend a lot of time analyzing thoughts<br/>
about learning and parenting and how it all works.<br/>
<br/>
Worry often comes from lack of information and lack of control. We can&#39;t<br/>
control our kids but we can control their environment so it gives them what<br/>
they need. And if you read here or on the Unschooling.com message boards,<br/>
there&#39;s loads information.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling comes naturally to some people but I don&#39;t think anyone should<br/>
expect to dump a lifetime&#39;s worth of indoctrination into schoolish thought<br/>
quickly. Life in a schoolish society fills us full of unexamined thoughts.<br/>
It takes time to find them and examine them and to figure out how to detach<br/>
them from controling our emotions.<br/>
<br/>
I wish understanding and trusting unschooling were as easy as unschooling<br/>
is! There isn&#39;t much simpler than letting kids learn :-) But if someone<br/>
lacks curiosity about life or is filtering their vision through schoolish<br/>
lenses they can think they get it but don&#39;t really.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks. I sometimes hallucinate clearly.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have spent 2 out of the last 3 weeks talking about art <br/>
and the internet. We were first in Orono-Bar Harbor area in Maine, came <br/>
back home to crank out some work and leave pronto for Easton, PA. Two <br/>
of the &#39;georgeouest&#39; places I&#39;ve ever been two.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids not only came with us. They were with us during the talks and <br/>
even participated. Up in Maine, they just did not want to miss anything <br/>
and were happy to be with us and the computers in the classrooms. I <br/>
guess it shows their unschooled because they actually found the whole <br/>
idea of a graduate classroom entertaining. It doesn&#39;t hurt either that <br/>
these kids have been nursed while at the computer and have always seen <br/>
us working. Mommy and Daddy&#39;s work is not a mystery to them. So in a <br/>
way it was like any other day but with more people and at a different <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
Well, they blew people away. &quot;How well behaved&quot;. &quot;You&#39;ve taught them so <br/>
well&quot;. &quot;They are so well trained&quot; (I swear a person said that as if <br/>
they were puppies). The thing is, I can&#39;t claim I had control of what <br/>
went on during those 10 days we were &quot;on the road&quot;. My kids get to <br/>
choose what they want to do. If we can&#39;t agree on it happening at the <br/>
time they want, we negotiate. Also, they are really neat people that I <br/>
have the honor to have given birth. I&#39;m not just saying it out of <br/>
motherly love. I really like them as people. They have interesting <br/>
personalities and, if there is one thing that I will take some credit <br/>
for is their sense of humor. Still, especially with the little one, <br/>
they have expressed their sense of humor from very early on and each <br/>
one of them shine for their brand of silliness. Evan is great with <br/>
words and dry wit. Aidan is a slut for slapstick and gross humor. And <br/>
somewhere we all seem to meet at the intersection of poopy jokes, <br/>
Beatles references and Spongebob Squarepants.<br/>
<br/>
The point that I am trying to make here is that I feel that I am more <br/>
keeper of the flame than flame-maker. I feel that my kids have these <br/>
interesting lives that I have the honor to not just watch unfold but <br/>
guide in any way they need. As I told a friend, I sometimes look at <br/>
them and feel like I have nothing to do with who they are. Not that I <br/>
have no influence, because I do, but that the whole idea of parenting <br/>
as authorship of children, as if they where things to be molded and not <br/>
human beings living life, has been blown away by my kids greatness. <br/>
Beatlemania and all :-)<br/>

Evan says he is Paul from the Beatles. He starts guitar lessons this <br/>
week. He&#39;s always been fascinated by guitars and pianos. If I had <br/>
space, I would have gone with piano. Guitar, still is exciting to him. <br/>
When I tell people he is starting guitar lessons they look at me and go <br/>
&quot;oh.&quot; You see, in NYC it is not cool to have a kid doing guitar. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1707209800">Liza, your boys sound wonderful.   I hope when we visit family in NY (if we <br/>
get lucky enough to do this in the next year) that we can get our boys <br/>
together.  .  Gillen and I are about to start teaching ourselves guitar <br/>
(only because we don&#39;t have a teacher nearby).  I also would prefer piano <br/>
and would get a keyboard but Gillen wants to go right to guitar.  Once I <br/>
introduce the chords (after learning them myself!) I am wondering if he <br/>
will want to switch to using chords or will still prefer just &quot;playing&quot; <br/>
guitar as he always has.  It may be too soon for him.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
Jesse&#39;s favorite song right now is &quot;You Say it&#39;s Your Birthday&quot;.  He is 3 <br/>
and it&#39;s really fun to see him rocking out.  I directed kids in a play that <br/>
we all wrote together with Beatles songs last Spring.  My goal was that <br/>
they be introduced to the Beatles and a lot of them still tell me they sing <br/>
the Beatles all the time.  Yes!  We have a CD of kids singing Beatles songs <br/>
that they, and my kids, loved.  It&#39;s called &quot;All you Need is Love&quot;.   They <br/>
like the real thing as well but the kids who sing on the CD are great.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; In our society we tell kids that they are not whole yet. Our whole<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; culture of parenting is based on tomorrow. We tell our kids that they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really persons but the potential of a person. That once they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;get educated&quot;, &quot;turn 21&quot;, &quot;finish college&quot;, &quot;get the great<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; jobs/car/spouse/house/kids&quot;, then they are real people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; What about now?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Aren&#39;t they complete now? Aren&#39;t they real people now?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That was awesome Liza!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Evan says he is Paul from the Beatles. He starts guitar lessons this<br/>
&gt;week. He&#39;s always been fascinated by guitars and pianos. If I had<br/>
&gt;space, I would have gone with piano. Guitar, still is exciting to him.<br/>
&gt;When I tell people he is starting guitar lessons they look at me and go<br/>
&gt;&quot;oh.&quot; You see, in NYC it is not cool to have a kid doing guitar.<br/>
&gt;Violin, piano --and please, Suzuki method. Guitar, well, whoever heard.<br/>
&gt;But that is what he wants NOW. Gotta run with it. Especially if we<br/>
&gt;wants to learn how to play like Paul :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, they blew people away. &quot;How well behaved&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My brother in law left yesterday.  His parting compliment was &quot;Your children <br/>
are always so well behaved.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said he was especially enjoying being around Holly.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the compliments I enjoy getting, &quot;well behaved&quot; isn&#39;t really one of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate knowing that someone else is happy being with my kids, but I <br/>
think it does have that connotation of me having done a good job training them.<br/>
<br/>
It would be cruel for me to discuss it honestly with Gerry, as his kids don&#39;t <br/>
much like him and they don&#39;t communicate openly with him.    Partly that&#39;s <br/>
the separation of their parents and them being poisoned against him by their <br/>
maternal grandmother.  Partly it&#39;s because he treats them badly and demands that <br/>
they treat him well.<br/>

(whose father, btw, is the musical director for Blues Clues) that loved <br/>
&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and would sing it all the time. Moses even came one <br/>
day and gave a mini-concert and capped off the event with &quot;this is real <br/>
rock &#39;n roll&quot; to the crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Well, up until that day this was a home devoted to almost everything <br/>
U2. Then came in Evan with his, &quot;that&#39;s not real rock &#39;n roll, &#39;cause <br/>
their not the Beatles&quot;. I had to scramble to get Beatles CD into this <br/>
house. One day I decided to rent &quot;A hard day&#39;s night&quot; (which Mark and I <br/>
had not seen in over 20 years) and that was it. The kids have seen it <br/>
already about 15 times. This movie comes second to &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; <br/>
only because we don&#39;t own a copy. They almost know all the screenplay <br/>
by heart.<br/>
<br/>
One of our family jokes these days has to do with a key phrase in the <br/>
movie:  &quot;very, clean&quot;. These days, every time we meet some one we say <br/>
&quot;She&#39;s very, clean&quot; or if we do something it&#39;ll be, &quot;It&#39;s very, clean&quot;. <br/>
You have to see the movie to understand what I am talking about.<br/>
<br/>
That running joke was started by my 6 year-old, not by me. In the funny <br/>
department, that&#39;s the kind of joke I would make but he beat me too it! <br/>
That&#39;s why I just look at them in wonder. It amazes me how somebody so <br/>
young can be so incredibly funny. He is either a comic genius or I&#39;m <br/>
just a very simple woman --and those that know me would never think of <br/>
me as being simple :-)<br/>

Maybe too confrontational.  I get that way with questions that are <br/>

walked past our U2 calendar hanging in the hallway to get to my <br/>

to come out next year?  Can we wait that long? Bono is one of <br/>

<br/>
Like there are all kinds of adults, but with kids, there are only &quot;good kids&quot; <br/>
and &quot;bad kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are boring kids (dorky, geeky) who are neither impressively <br/>
&quot;good&quot; nor dangerously and shamefully &quot;bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the good and bad are from the parents&#39; point of view!!  Good for parents. <br/>
 Bad for paernts.<br/>
<br/>
Eddie Haskell was a good kid, because parents were the judges of &quot;good.&quot;<br/>
(Leave It to Beaver reference, lest young moms among us ask who Eddie Haskell <br/>

How did I miss a thread about my beloved U2?!? &lt;bwg&gt; Just <br/>
walked past our U2 calendar hanging in the hallway to get to my <br/>
computer. Two CDs are permanently in the player. My inbox is <br/>
full of U2 articles. And I have Elevation (DVD) in a prominent <br/>
place in my bedroom. Did you know they have a new CD slated <br/>
to come out next year?  Can we wait that long? Bono is one of <br/>
five top contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Grace in <br/>
perpetual motion—that&#39;s Bono.<br/>
<br/>
Ahem.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, back to your regularly scheduled thread. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872744545">A few months ago I was shopping in the mall.  My kids were being <br/>
exceptionally good, especially my 2yo who is usually a very typical <br/>
2yo!  He was tired so he hung out in his stroller while I was <br/>
cruising through the sale racks.  As I was leaving the sales woman <br/>
proceeded to tell me how well behaved my children were and how she <br/>
hated children that didn&#39;t listen.  I was so peeved at the moment.  <br/>
I replied something about it being difficult for kids to wait around <br/>
that long.  I remember thinking that my kids often get crabby <br/>
and &quot;misbehave&quot; when we are out and about and more often than not it <br/>
is because they have had enough.  I am much more atune to that these <br/>
days although sometimes they have to put up with me.  <br/>
<br/>
I felt insulted that she would even say that to me.  As if my <br/>
children behaving for HER deserved some sort of praise.  I was <br/>
almost regretful that they had not been more there usual selves <br/>
hiding in the racks!   I sort of felt sorry for those that would <br/>
follow me with their children that did not fall into her realm of <br/>
good behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I think it takes a certain flexable relationship with your child to <br/>
understand why they are &quot;misbehaving&quot; and see how your behavior and <br/>
actions may be a part of that.  Most parents do not think that far.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve felt that defensive irritation too when people compliment my kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not fair to be irritated about an honest compliment, so I usually just <br/>
wish that more parents could be smoother about having kids out with them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been difficult in public too, but sometimes it&#39;s just time to <br/>
buy them some juice or go play on the escalator or something, and with practice <br/>
I got better at noticing their cues.<br/>
<br/>
In grocery stores when we were by the candy near the checkout, I would talk <br/>
right to them, and maybe play with their hands or feet when they were shopping <br/>
cart-riding size, but one of the main things was that if they got interested <br/>
in the gum or candy and wanted some, I would have said okay.  So it wasn&#39;t the <br/>
valley of temptation. It wasn&#39;t a place to hear &quot;NO&quot; for my kids.  It was a <br/>
calm place.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, yeah--it&#39;s not coincidence when kids can have fun at a mall or a <br/>
grocery store. And it is &quot;well behaved,&quot; and partly it&#39;s having fun and being <br/>
comfortable being out with real people in the real world.<br/>
