<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795784315">We don&#39;t set any limits.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people hear &quot;no limits&quot; and think the kids must be little <br/>
slack-jawed zombies watching hours of Jerry Springer every day &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
The reality is that everybody in our family makes conscious choices <br/>
about what they want to or don&#39;t want to watch - just EXACTLY in the <br/>
same way we choose what books we want to read or not read.<br/>
<br/>
So - speaking of TV, did you all watch the O&#39;Keefe&#39;s? I thought it was <br/>
mildly funny - I like the actors. The storyline was a little too sappy <br/>
this week, and the characters just way too stereotyped (the school kids <br/>
and school staff more so than the homeschooled family) - but it has <br/>
potential to be a good comedy. Homeschoolers around the country are all <br/>
up in arms over it because the homeschooled kids are portrayed as kind <br/>
of weird (HSLDA wrote to the network demanding to be allowed to <br/>
prescreen the show) -- but I think they actually end up using them to <br/>
showcase the irrationality of so much of what goes on at school  - and <br/>
THAT comes across more strongly than the oddities of the homeschoolers. <br/>
Plus - I know a whole LOT of odd homeschoolers - us among them - who <br/>
would definitely stand out in some ways as &#39;misfits&quot; if dropped into <br/>
high school. That&#39;s realistic, imo. And this family is odd, but REALLY <br/>
nice. That seems right to me. The show makes it look like they are <br/>
doing a classroom in their house - and yet they seem to at least have a <br/>
very innovative schooling approach - which shows that even those who <br/>
school-at-home can at least be way more interest-driven and <br/>
child-friendly than schools are. All-in-all I think it makes the <br/>
homeschoolers look smart and likable and fresh and happy and eager to <br/>
learn and clearly better off than their always-schooled classmates.<br/>

them to break away and they do not tell me to break away.  If I need help or if <br/>
they need help we may ask each other to break away for a minute.  I also let <br/>
them decide what to watch.  If I think it might be questionable to me then I <br/>
watch with them so I can answer questions or be there to talk about something <br/>

<br/>
I watched the first week.  I doubt it will be a ratings success because<br/>
I didn&#39;t find it particularly funny.  But it wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as I<br/>
had feared.  I like that the homeschooled kids were depicted as bright<br/>
and enthusiastic.  The contrast with the very uninterested kids in the<br/>
classroom was quite realistic.  And when the family was walking into the<br/>
booksale at the school, they all had enormous grins on their faces. <br/>
That&#39;s exactly what I look like when I&#39;m buying books. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My husband and I watched it the very first night it was on. We knew we could<br/>
get past the negative showing of homeschoolers if it was funny. We didn&#39;t<br/>
think it was funny at all. Of course sometimes the first show isn&#39;t. I hated<br/>
Will and Grace when it started and now I love it. But we haven&#39;t seen the<br/>
O&#39;Keefes since. If it gets better, let me know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-730149709">***Is it correct <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve never had limits on TV.<br/>
<br/>
I watched my son decide what he wanted to eat, and how much.   I watched<br/>
him decide which toys he wanted to play with and how long.   And I<br/>
watched him decide which books he wanted to read and how many times.   It<br/>
only seemed reasonable to me he could do the same with TV.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eleven years old now and hasn&#39;t been arrested, hasn&#39;t been in a<br/>
fight, hasn&#39;t mugged any old ladies, tortured any cats or heisted any<br/>
BMW&#39;s.   This in spite of unlimited satellite TV.<br/>
<br/>
His TV viewing habits include any and every old monster movie, especially<br/>
Godzilla movies.  Mash reruns, Cheers and The Cosby Show.  He watches<br/>
various other things as he comes across interesting bits.<br/>
   <br/>
Kim, at the video store, now knows he can rent anything he wants and for<br/>
reasons quite mysterious to her, he never rents slasher films or porn. <br/>

<br/>
Maybe because we only have broadcast TV, but my boys who are teenagers also <br/>
haven&#39;t been in any of the above trouble. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only person in our house who ever watches Fear Factor is Holly.  She also <br/>
likes &quot;Elimidate&quot; or some such sadistic dating show where people get reviewed <br/>
right to their faces and then behind their backs.   Yet Holly is kind to <br/>
people and animals, and has never even tasted a bug.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Kim, at the video store, now knows he can rent anything he wants and for<br/>
reasons quite mysterious to her, he never rents slasher films or porn. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Movies picked up and watched voluntarily here, where we have a Hollywood <br/>
Video right out the back gate and my kids can watch anything they want to:<br/>
<br/>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (original movie)<br/>
Pirate of Penzance<br/>
Pocahontas<br/>
The Princess Bride<br/>
Weird Al in Concert<br/>
The Fifth Element (twice in a week because we got it on DVD)<br/>
Hercules and Xena (taped episodes, that&#39;s in Kirby&#39;s player)<br/>
Marty on the news (two stations did pieces on the Junior Police Academy, and <br/>
Marty showed in both, so people have watched and re-watched that)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what free choice looks like at our house with kids 11, 14 and 16.<br/>
I, too, learned first with food and bedtimes and choices about whether to sit <br/>
with mom at the park, or walk over to other kids; whether to have mom catch <br/>
at the bottom of the slide or not--giving them choices and discussing how <br/>
things are going is way better than any number of rules and protective measures.<br/>

Oh!  Kirby and I watched the first two hours of the the villains and heroes <br/>
of American film thing last night (it was kind of slow going; it was okay), and <br/>
then Marty and I watched the last hour elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Part was about the Bates Hotel thing (what is it?  Hitchcock early-slash <br/>
thing) and Marty hadn&#39;t seen it.  I&#39;ve watched <br/>
<br/>
PSYCHO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched The Birds (a few months ago) with Marty and Holly and last year, <br/>
The Exorcist with eight or ten kids, mostly teens, and Holly.   I didn&#39;t <br/>
think either scared Marty a bit.  We were discussing special effects and social <br/>
contexts.   I told him I thought Psycho was scarier than those.  He said he <br/>
thought The Exorcist had been pretty creepy.<br/>
<br/>
If those things are historical film art your mom will watch and discuss with <br/>
you as opposed to &quot;OOOH, let&#39;s sneak and watch THIS because our moms will hate <br/>
that,&quot; life is different.<br/>

More snapshot evidence of what people are requesting to watch here.<br/>
<br/>
Our  Netflix account is just whatever anyone in the house names, and they <br/>
come in whatever order Netflix gets them available.  Sometimes we&#39;re renting <br/>
their most obscure stuff and sometimes we&#39;re on the list for more popular things, <br/>
but generally if we REALLY want to see the current thing, we go to Hollywood <br/>
Video on Wednesday or Thursday night when the last weekend&#39;s five-day rentals <br/>
are back in, and use Netflix for older, no big hurry stuff.<br/>
<br/>
OH, I just looked at the queue and we need to load it back up.  Here&#39;s all <br/>
that&#39;s left:<br/>
<br/>
    The King of Masks       Foreign     Now<br/>
    The Artist: Rave UN2 the Year 2000      Music & Concert     Now<br/>

Dylan likes the Hitchcock stuff.   He likes the tension and people<br/>
squirming as they consider the unthinkable and then take action.  <br/>
<br/>
He likes the over acted drama of early horror films. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
He likes that someone has the power to bring cheesy monsters to life.<br/>
He likes Ray Harryhausen creatures.<br/>
<br/>
But he also likes good humor, good writing, good plot.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t mind gore if there&#39;s an interesting reason for it.  He&#39;s<br/>
watched some of the slasher movies of the eighties, but hasn&#39;t found much<br/>
to appreciate in them.  <br/>
<br/>
He watches on different levels... Some for the entertainment of a good<br/>
story, some for the nuances of human behavior, some for the appreciation<br/>
of film itself.   <br/>
<br/>
His recent video choices have been  The Majestic,  The 13th Warrior and<br/>
K19.<br/>
<br/>
I just watched Pitch Black and Starship Troopers, again &lt;g&gt;<br/>

other day he watched the D-day series all on his own. He also watches the <br/>
Terminator movies,Buffy, Nick channels, Matrix, Disney stuff, Toy Story, Blank <br/>
Check and Titanic etc..<br/>
<br/>
The only comment I have made is when we had free channels that Max after 10 <br/>
tends to have pornography just so he didn&#39;t land on it. He hates anything that <br/>
has sex scenes.<br/>
Max was here for three days and we dumped them cuz the cable company took <br/>
some other channels we liked better and said it was an old AT&T package. We got <br/>
them back but I told them we are going to Satellite as soon as I can get an <br/>
install and a good package deal with free boxes.<br/>
<br/>
He hasn&#39;t committed any crimes or gotten into mischief. I dont really think <br/>
TV causes all that kinda stuff anyway. I think it&#39;s family issues and <br/>
environment mostly.<br/>

Deb, if you ever get to visit, here&#39;s how to make friends with my husband for <br/>

<br/>
He would watch it every week if we did&#39;t make him stop. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are movies I&#39;ve watched over and over, but that&#39;s definitely one of <br/>
Keith&#39;s &quot;comfort-films,&quot; along with Seven Samurai, Sons of Katie Elder (I think <br/>
it is), Paint Your Wagon, and I&#39;m probably forgetting some favorites.<br/>
<br/>
My multi-repeats have been Brother Sun, Sister Moon; JC Superstar; Guarding <br/>

&lt;&lt; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (original movie) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s back on TV.  My kid loves the old books my brother gave him.  I added it <br/>
to Netflix.....&quot; The Movie has been added to your Rental Queue.  Currently, <br/>
this movie has a long wait. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I am not the only one who has had this idea.  Darn.  <br/>

<br/>
Kirby was attached to the character voices on the old one, and the themesong, <br/>
so he&#39;s having a hard time warming up to the new one.  Luckily he has lots of <br/>
the old stuff on tape.<br/>

I love the psychology of that movie and the politics.   The story taking<br/>
place in a time after democracy has failed and the military had to take<br/>
over for the good of the people. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fascinating look at fascism where civilians have no say in<br/>
government and citizenship is obtained only through military service.  <br/>
But even in service a citizen&#39;s voice is lost to the higher ranking<br/>
officials. <br/>
<br/>
The way the population is stirred into a frenzy by the politics of<br/>
military might and righteousness parallels what happened in Nazi Germany<br/>
as Hitler and his war machine tried desperately to squash the threatening<br/>
bugs of German greatness. <br/>
<br/>
Yes it&#39;s a blast &#39;em till they &#39;splode mindless violence thing, but I<br/>
still love the politics. &lt;g&gt;  Especially interesting after our own nation<br/>
has been at war again and with the current questions about the<br/>
justifications for it. <br/>
<br/>

costumes in that movie reminiscent of Nazi Germany&#39;s Third Reich uniforms. We <br/>
enjoyed the movie, cheesy and fun, but this aspect bothered my Marine hubby to be <br/>
ticked off enough to not list it as one of his favs. He&#39;ll watch it whenever <br/>
Kass and Kree are in the mood, but complains endlessly throughout its entirety <br/>
about the choice of costuming. We have debated the actual intention of the <br/>
costume designer, due to the political aspect of the movie. Which of course leads <br/>
to a WWII discussion. Either way it pisses him off. <br/>

What I love most is that of however many thousands of bugs there would have <br/>
been (anyone who&#39;s ever even had a wasp&#39;s nest of ant bed in their yard will <br/>
know), they end up winning by killing just a very, very few.  And luckily, those <br/>
few were willing to take them on one at a time, while the rest waited <br/>
offscreen somewhere.   <br/>
<br/>
There must be something in all the emotional buildup that appeals to guys&#39; <br/>
sense of duty and manliness, because the plot is odd and the ending is...  I <br/>
guess those bug puppets are really expensive and one&#39;s the limit.<br/>
