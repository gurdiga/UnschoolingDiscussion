<div id="ygrps-yiv-256529003"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As for New Testament writings on homosexuality, Paul again, in Romans chapter<br/>
&gt; one, makes it pretty explicit what he thinks about it. Many gays deny that<br/>
&gt; this is what he was addressing, but this view is absurd, regardless what<br/>
&gt; one&#39;s personal views on homosexuality are.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have no doubt that homosexuality is what Paul was addressing in this<br/>
passage.  However, I don&#39;t worship Paul, neither do I believe that he was<br/>
infallible.  (The belief that the Bible is infallible word of God is an<br/>
opinion, not a &quot;truth&quot;.)  I&#39;m interested in what Paul has to say, but I also<br/>
recognize him as a truly human man of his own time, with opinions formed by<br/>
the culture of his time.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the Gospel writings date from a number of years after Jesus&#39;<br/>
death, which does create issues of what Jesus&#39; words exactly were.  However,<br/>
I have noted that at least as far as the Gospels record, Jesus seemed to<br/>
talk a great deal about loving people and not condemning them.  There are no<br/>
Gospel passages on homosexuality.<br/>
