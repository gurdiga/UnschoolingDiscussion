<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, I don&#39;t think this is hugely insightful or anything...but did you know <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; you can register your family as a 4-H club?<br/>
&gt; Then you could get their &quot;curriculum&quot; for free and do the program (with the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; lessons she&#39;s already doing) all  on your own and she&#39;d get 4-H awards for <br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>WOW - seriously? I did NOT know that. That&#39;s something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU to everybody for all the responses - they&#39;ve been really really <br/>
helpful. Rosie had the idea of cutting her lessons at the stables down to <br/>
twice a month while she tries out 4H.  So I imagine I&#39;ll let her do that for <br/>
a while - maybe a couple of months, while we see how the new program works, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking some of this is actual attachment to the horses at her current <br/>
stables and that she&#39;ll develop attachment to the new horses, maybe even more <br/>
since she&#39;ll get to have more time with them.<br/>
<br/>
Hard for a nonhorse-lover like me to really &quot;get&quot; such attachments, but I do <br/>
get it, intellectually, at least, enough to believe it and respect it &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
