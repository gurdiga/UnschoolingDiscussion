 </span></blockquote>Perhaps my brain is truly fried, but who mentioned equality and validity <br/>
regarding philosophy? Did I miss it somewhere or was this the first time it was <br/>
stated? I know I never brought up either equality or validity in philosophy, <br/>
because that is subjective and again goes back to perspective. So I guess I&#39;m <br/>
wondering how you discern whether anyone&#39;s personal philosophies are valid and <br/>
why? I mean, is it a necessity to validate the person, or their worthiness? What <br/>
makes one philosophy more valid than anothers? <br/>
<br/>
A difference in view by no means makes one philosophy dust and another rock <br/>
solid. <br/>
