<div id="ygrps-yiv-374217193">It&#39;s that time of year when aquaintances ask me if we continue homeschooling in the summer.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to explain that we don&#39;t homeschool differently in the summer, because the way we learn doesn&#39;t look like school anyway.  I&#39;m getting tired of trying to explain, and thought that I would just say, &quot;we&#39;re taking the summer off&quot;, the next time I&#39;m asked.<br/>
<br/>
While pulling weeds this evening, I thought instead that I could say, &quot;Oh, we make it a point to avoid all learning during the summer&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m eager for someone to ask!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1902966129">This is GOOD, MaryEllen. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s happening to me, too, and I haven&#39;t known just what to say, <br/>
though I think I helped one mom see the value of taking the summer to <br/>
just watch her kids. Told her a little bit about how I&#39;ve watched <br/>
Katie (My most Unschooled child) learn so many things without me <br/>
teaching her, and said &quot;Just relax. Take the whole summer off, and <br/>
watch your kids. Just observe them. They&#39;re learning, even when <br/>
you&#39;re NOT teaching them.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And then she wanted to talk about some very cool curriculum she&#39;d <br/>
found at a homeschoolers&#39; conference, and about how they tested their <br/>
boy (Katie&#39;s age...8...and a slow reader) and found out he has no <br/>
peripheral vision (gimme a break) AND how they have lenses they can <br/>
fit him with to help with that.<br/>
<br/>
ugh. They have THAT kind of thing, at these homeschooler conferences? <br/>
Sheesh. But she wasn&#39;t going to get the lenses. Too expensive, but <br/>
she WAS so relieved to find out the reason WHY her son was such a <br/>
late starter and a slow reader...poor mom. Poor kids. Trapped in a <br/>
schoolish mentality, and the stress that comes with it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, sheesh. Didn&#39;t mean to get all tangential there. :&#92; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;We make it a point to avoid all learning in the summer.&quot; Good.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL<br/>
<br/>
The first summer after I removed Kass and Kree from school, my own grandma, <br/>
the twins great-grandma, asked the same question. My aunts explained to her <br/>
that since my kids don&#39;t go to school, it doesn&#39;t really matter how we do summer. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My grandma, well, she went off. Saying that the girls are so smart they <br/>
deserve summer vacation. I tried to explain that we unschool, so they never really <br/>
stop learning. She had a fit and a half. She was stuck in that if all the <br/>
other kids in the world get a summer, then her great granddaughters deserved one <br/>
too! My aunts did no better and just got frustrated with trying to explain it. <br/>
Finally I gave in. &quot;You&#39;re right Grandma, I won&#39;t make them learn anything for <br/>
the summer.&quot; She was happy and dropped the argument just after saying, &quot;I may <br/>
be old, but I know everyone needs a vacation!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So the topic was dropped and she felt like she had won.  I guess what was <br/>
more important than the argument, was that my grandma made it clear she supported <br/>
our decision to not do school anymore, she just wanted to make sure my girls <br/>
had fun too and didn&#39;t work too hard during the summer. Even now she doesn&#39;t <br/>
get what we do, only that I don&#39;t make them do anything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Nichole, you are so very right. It was my aunts who were frustrated, it <br/>
actually made me smile a lot. I think being the first born grandchild, even to <br/>
this day, gives me far more leeway where Grandma is concerned. Now she tells <br/>
my cousins who are just beginning to have children in the last 3 years, that <br/>
they better pay attention to what I do and not send their kids to school. LMAO <br/>
They just look and me and say &quot;OK Grandma, we&#39;ll look into it.&quot; Then I get the <br/>
&quot;Thanx a lot for another hot idea...&quot; look from said cousins. Hehehe   My <br/>
grandma&#39;s one and only concern is that we enjoy life. She also has an extreme <br/>
affection for my DH, she thinks he can walk on water! But that&#39;s for another <br/>
thread. LOL<br/>
