<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328901942">Is he physically tired and mentally awake? If he is then meditation might<br/>
help. But if its the other way around you might suggest and evening run or<br/>
exercise routine.<br/>
Below is a a simple guide to meditation that is very helpful<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646742431">My son kinda goes through stages where he&#39;ll have difficulty falling asleep.  What works best for him is the same routine each night.  (This is only done when he&#39;s having a hard time for a few nights in a row.)  What he usually does is choose a time (same time each night) to go to bed, lights go down low, hot chocolate, I read to him or he reads to himself (something light and entertaining), CD with thunderstorms on it playing once he lays down.  Sometimes he&#39;ll ask for his back to be rubbed.  Generally he just concentrates on relaxing his body while he listens to the CD.  He starts at his toes (each one individually) and works his way up from there.  He&#39;s asleep before he finishes.<br/>

<br/>
I suffer from insomnia too. For years, I worked nights (10p to 6a, or 11p to <br/>
7a) as a nurse. I always worked nights because, one I was up anyway, and two, <br/>
when Moly was a baby it saved us daycare costs. Aside from that, ever since I <br/>
can remember I have had a hard time falling asleep, and will wake up if I <br/>
manage to go to sleep before 2am. I&#39;ve tried all sorts of things. I have at <br/>
desperate times, stayed awake for two or three days just so I could try to get my <br/>
body on a more natural pattern with the rest of the world. Still on that third <br/>
or fourth night, exhausted, I will wake up in the middle of the night anyway. <br/>
I&#39;ve even tried going to a sleep disorder clinic, I&#39;ve taken medication, tried <br/>
biofeedback, music, sleeping in different places, cutting caffeine out of my <br/>
diet, the list is never ending. Regardless, if your son can stand to sleep <br/>
during nontraditional sleep hours, and you don&#39;t mind either, then why not let his <br/>
body get the sleep it needs then. I understand the disruption, you have to or <br/>
want to go somewhere, he is just falling asleep. His pacing the house at all <br/>
hours trying to get to sleep isn&#39;t healthy either. It puts unnecessary stress <br/>
on him due to the worry. If you don&#39;t mind doing things with him later in the <br/>
day/afternoon and letting him stay at home on the days you have things to do <br/>
outside of the house, the give it a shot. Let him develop his own natural sleep <br/>
patterns. As a teen and adult, he can get jobs working later, he can go to <br/>
college (if that is what he wants) during nontraditional hours too. Most offer <br/>
evening classes. His world will not come to an end if he is a day sleeper. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
He will have to adjust to the majority of the world working on that typical 9 <br/>
to 5 ;o) but he can, like many do, manage a full life. It is my opinion that <br/>
it is more unhealthy to force himself to be like the rest of the world, getting <br/>
less/no sleep, than it would be for him to just give into what his body is <br/>
trying to tell him. Some people are just night people. If he really has true <br/>
insomnia, (that is me, if I get two hours, I&#39;m doing good) and can&#39;t sleep at <br/>
all, no matter what time of day/night it is, then I highly recommend a sleep <br/>
clinic. Although it didn&#39;t help me, much, I did learn some things about my sleep <br/>
needs, and that has gone a long way toward a more healthy life. My own opinion <br/>
about medication is that, although there are a few that have actually given me <br/>
sleep, they also make me suffer from more troubling nightmares and when I do <br/>
wake up, I am groggy, loopy, headachy, and that lasts for hours. On top of all <br/>
that, medication has only ever given me an additional two or three hours of <br/>
(restless) sleep. To me, that is not worth the trade off. <br/>

Jim Weiss has a sleep tape with stories about going to an exciting place, <br/>
doing something physical, and then having hot chocolate (or something) and then <br/>
it describes the bed, so soft...   Very soothing to me, but Holly didn&#39;t ever <br/>
like it.<br/>
<br/>
Holly just saidthat last night she read until she got tired, then she turned <br/>
off the light and listened to Fred Astaire until she turned asleep, but <br/>
usually she plays Gameboy, and then reads, and then ends with music.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Holly because she&#39;s the one here who takes a long, long time to fall <br/>
asleep.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> Jim actually has two sleep-inducing tapes:  Sweet dreams and Good Night.  I<br/>
have tried to lay down with my kids and listen to them, and they always put<br/>
me to sleep!  I saw an advertisement for a CD called the Delta Sleep<br/>
Sysytem, or something similar. It was in the One Spirit book club flier.<br/>
Has anyone tried it?<br/>
<br/>
Both of my boys sometimes have trouble falling asleep.  My oldest will lay<br/>
in bed for hours awake, but he doesn&#39;t mind.  He likes to think.  Sometimes<br/>
when one of the other kids have a class, or I have a meeting to go to, I&#39;ll<br/>
ask him to find something to bring to entertain himself with.  He usually<br/>
says he doesn&#39;t need anything, he&#39;ll just think.  The other son will come<br/>
downstairs when he can&#39;t sleep and tell me that his brain is all tangled up,<br/>
or his thoughts are swimming around in his head.  I&#39;ve tried helping him<br/>
meditate or consciously tightening and releasing his muscles.  That seems to<br/>
help.  Recently I took him for some energy work, and that has helped<br/>
immensely, both with his being able to sleep, and with his general attitude.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672772847">My son, also a Joseph has a really hard time sleeping. He&#39;s like me<br/>
unfortunately when it comes to that. When I was younger I had my mom put on<br/>
albums for me when I went to sleep. Same ones all the time. I generally made<br/>
it through 3 or 4 and then fell asleep. Once in awhile all of them would<br/>
play and I was still awake. But the music for me helped a lot. Nothing much<br/>
seems to help Joseph and when we have places to go the next day, him staying<br/>
up isn&#39;t always a good option. He is taking, once in awhile, Calms Forte and<br/>
it&#39;s really working for him. He just takes one pill and it relaxes his mind<br/>
enough to where he can fall asleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429563868">One thing I forgot to mention that we&#39;ve done at times to help Andy go to sleep is to just go for a drive.  This is usually when he can&#39;t stop thinking about something.  We&#39;d just get on the highway and make a loop around town.  It doesn&#39;t work as well for him staying on the city streets with lights every mile.  After thirty minutes he&#39;d be relaxed enough that he&#39;d be able to go to sleep.  Sometimes I&#39;d have to wake him up to go back inside.  <br/>
