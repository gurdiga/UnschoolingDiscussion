In an effort to end the flame fanning, I asked Sandra not to respond to my<br/>
posts. She can&#39;t resist. Now she wants us all to think I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m<br/>
talking about because she guesses I was never in band. She seems to need me.<br/>
<br/>
What does being in band have to do with knowing how schools scam us? It<br/>
doesn&#39;t. Band instruments was merely an example. Next time, it&#39;ll be shoes<br/>
for the bowling team.<br/>
<br/>
The public school mentality is Entitlement. Everyone is entitled to spend<br/>
other people&#39;s money for every need they can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
In my town, about 85% of the school budget pays for employees salaries and<br/>
benefits. <br/>
<br/>
The budget pays for one employee for every six students. Are none of those<br/>
&quot;extras&quot;? There are at least twice as many employees in my town&#39;s public<br/>
schools as are needed, making them cost more than twice what the average<br/>
private school charges in tuition. Extras, like &quot;deans,&quot; lunchroom monitors,<br/>
police in the corridors, special ed for fifteen percent of the children<br/>
mostly because they weren&#39;t taught to read.<br/>
<br/>
How &#39;bout psychological profilers and other mind-snoopers? How bout<br/>
psychological testing that schools pay bundles for (to the Lutheran Church<br/>
think tank called The Search Institute, in Minneapolis) and don&#39;t tell<br/>
parents about until after they&#39;re administered and keep the purpose and the<br/>
results secret. How bout all the standardized testing that&#39;s done, often<br/>
against parents&#39;s wishes. Those few examples are &quot;extras&quot; that the schools<br/>
provide within the bloated budgets. If only ONE unnecessary employee were<br/>
eliminated, out of dozens of them that should, or one unnecessary set of<br/>
tests, there would be money to burn for &quot;extras.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But, since Sandra missed my point, the children plying the streets for money<br/>
is not really for money -- schools already have far too much -- it&#39;s to keep<br/>
the entire community FEELING that the schools need more. It&#39;s PR,<br/>
&quot;See, we absolutely have to send your children out into the neighborhoods<br/>
door to door begging because YOU taxpayers don&#39;t give us enough. Sending the<br/>
children into the streets, endangering them, forcing them to beg from<br/>
strangers, is stricly a public relations scam. The kids are used.<br/>
<br/>
A few years back, my town&#39;s voters went to the polls to vote on whether or<br/>
not to accept the school budget for the next year. The town knew that the<br/>
budget was inflated as usual, and they voted it down. The superintendent&#39;s<br/>
response was not to eliminate the fluff in the spending, but instead, he<br/>
chose to eliminate the band for the following year. It eliminated ONE<br/>
salary, a pittance compared to the entire cut that was made and finally<br/>
accepted. But the effect was to make the cuts hurt the children who loved<br/>
playing music, and the whole town who enjoyed the playing of the band at<br/>
games and in the annual parade. The measure could only be described as a<br/>
mean trick by the superintendent because it forced him to accept a more<br/>
appropriate amount of money to run the schools.<br/>
<br/>
The long term effect was to hold the town hostage to his budgets ever since.<br/>
No one dares to challenge anything about school funding for fear that it<br/>
will be taken out on the kids. The system works well. Coercion is a great<br/>
tool when you have the power to use it.<br/>

Unschooling is everything that school isn&#39;t.<br/>
All we need to do is make a list of what schools do, and do the opposite.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892331687">SO Ned,<br/>
What do you want US to do?<br/>
Almost everyone here has already pulled their child out of schools, And<br/>
since we are attempting to spend most of our time creating a joyous swirly<br/>
sort of unschooling existance with our precious boys and girls (many of whom<br/>
are still young and cant be left home alone) we may not have time to storm<br/>
the enemy&#39;s castle.<br/>
You keep pointing out what is wrong with the schools, yet most of us already<br/>
KNOW there is something drastically wrong and that&#39;s why we are *here*.<br/>
I personally feel that by removing my children, I am making a HUGE statement<br/>
to the schools. But I think you may expect more.<br/>
So, like I said, What *would* you like us to do? (Because after all our<br/>
beautiful babies to grow up)<br/>

Many, many folks here including the moderator and list owner have asked you <br/>
(very politely I might add) to take this political propaganda elsewhere. <br/>
Please.<br/>
