Tell her not to spend any money at first, but just go to the library and <br/>
museums, and talk to other homeschoolers about what they do.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her many homeschoolers buy an expensive curriculum and then regret it.<br/>
<br/>
That will buy her enough time to breathe and homeschool without spending <br/>
money and you can more gradually get unschooling information to her.<br/>

support group leader that leans heavily toward the unschooling end, I run into 
this all the time. My approach for this is like much of life for me: What works 
for me is not the only right way to do something.&nbsp; I would be honest about 
your approach to homeschooling but let her know that there are many ways to 
homeschool. Encourage her to take time to &#39;deschool&#39; since that is recommended 
no matter how you choose to homeschool.&nbsp;Then encourage her to take time to 
investigate the many ways to homeschool as well as the many curriculum options 
available.&nbsp; I usually recommend that new homeschoolers make a point to ask 
as many people as possible how they homeschool, what materials they use (if 
any), and why.&nbsp; This will help them sift through the options. I also point 
them to a wide variety of websites including but not limited to 
unschooling.com.&nbsp; She will begin to see the many options available and what 
will work best for her family.</span></font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I know exactly what you mean about &quot;scaring&quot; new 
homeschoolers :o) and I&#39;m not sure I have much practical help except I tell 
people that there are many, many different ways to homeschool and if they would 
like to talk to a whole bunch of mom&#39;s and find out how they all do it, to come 
to one or our homeschool support group Park Days or support meetings. If pushed 
I kind of outline the continuum, i.e., school-at-home to unschooling, and if 
pushed still further :) I say I&#39;m on the unschooling extreme but that each 
family has to find what&#39;s comfortable for them...</font></div>

Hi,
<p>This is the advice I was given before we started homeschooling. I am
glad we decided to follow it. We have learned that unschooling is the best
for us right now.

<div><font face="Pooh">Johanna,</font></div>
<div><font face="Pooh">You won&#39;t scare her. Tell her what a typical day or two is 
like for you. If she still wants the textbook approach, send her to Barnes and 
Noble. They have workbooks there that she can buy for her child. Tell her that 
her child will also need de-schooling time and that she should allow him some 
time to totally forgoet about school...like a vacation thing. IF he wants to 
learn something, then she can get the books at the library or what not. Tell her 
to ease into it gently. Do explain that she will need to spend lots of time with 
her child, more than she usually had in the past....its a relationship thang 
where you invest your time in someone you love. </font></div>
