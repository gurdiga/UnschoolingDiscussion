<div id="ygrps-yiv-245603032">How do I handle the things that we have previously agreed to do when now I<br/>
am giving the children the option to do only  those activities they want to<br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
Piano Lessons:  Both my daughter and I take Suzuki piano lessons.  In<br/>
Suzuki, it is required that the student memorize all the songs, listen to<br/>
the recording daily, and our teacher has us memorize the solfege (sp) for<br/>
each song.  My daughter likes the piano lessons, and the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
We drive 2 1/2 hours to go to lessons and only go twice a month, so this is<br/>
not something I have taken lightly.  But, now that my daughter has the<br/>
option she is only practicing occasionally and objects whenever I put in the<br/>
CD. She should be testing out of book one at this next lesson and be going<br/>
on to book two, but she refuses to practice anything in book two (which she<br/>
would need to do before the lesson.)  She does still want to continue and to<br/>
go to the lesson.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been super stringent about practicing in that I have never sat<br/>
with her and required her to do all the teacher asked her to do(she is way<br/>
beyond me musically, I am still in the middle of book one and painstakingly<br/>
moving forward, lol.  She took traditional piano for four years before we<br/>
switched to Suzuki). I have always asked that she practice every day, but<br/>
understood when we didn&#39;t get time occasionally, etc.  Still, she was<br/>
practicing more before we decided to unschool (only a month or so).<br/>
<br/>
It costs a lot of money and time to go to these lessons, and I want her to<br/>
get the most out of them she can.  And she also wants flute lessons!  How<br/>
would you handle this?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance for thehelp,<br/>

If she goes in and isn&#39;t prepared, will they shun her for life?<br/>
Call the cops?<br/>
Fine you?<br/>
<br/>
You can put that recording on and say YOU want to listen to it.  If she hears <br/>
it fine, if  she doesn&#39;t fine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How many lessons have you been to since she has been exercising her new <br/>
freedom not to practice?<br/>
<br/>
If none, too soon to worry.<br/>
If one,  how did it go?<br/>
If two, how does she feel about it?<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t mind the feeling of being unprepared, she&#39;s fine.<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t like the feeling of being unprepared, she will probably <br/>
practice more.  FINALLY she will be practicing because she wants to, because <br/>
she has a personal, real reason to do it.  It will be a different kind of <br/>
practicing, too.  Because she won&#39;t be just going through the motions.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Take her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Still, she was practicing more before we decided to unschool (only a month <br/>
or so).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;ll practice more once you&#39;re unschooling and not just recovering from <br/>
requirements and rules.  Deschooling takes some time.<br/>

Thanks, that is exactly what I needed to hear!<br/>
<br/>
Required&quot; or what?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If she goes in and isn&#39;t prepared, will they shun her for life?<br/>
&gt; Call the cops?<br/>
&gt; Fine you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I think the only thing that will happen is that her teacher will be<br/>
dissapointed!  I am not sure whether she cares about that or not, lol.  I<br/>
personally really love the teacher, and like it much better when she is<br/>
pleased with me, and my daughter.  But, of course, I liked it when my<br/>
teachers were pleased with me in school too!<br/>
<br/>
How many lessons have you been to since she has been exercising her new<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; freedom not to practice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> We have not gone to a lesson since we started unschooling, so this will be<br/>
her first time to choose how she wants to be prepared.  (Christmas break,<br/>
and no money, lol).<br/>
<br/>
FINALLY she will be practicing because she wants to, because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she has a personal, real reason to do it.  It will be a different kind of<br/>
&gt; practicing, too.  Because she won&#39;t be just going through the motions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very good point, and this is what I have wanted for her all along anyway, to<br/>
play piano because she wants to!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, these ideas will help me through this!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is kind of interesting.  My husband is a guitar teacher with probably <br/>
about 35 years or more of experience under his belt (well, he teaches <br/>
people, not guitars).  Anyway, understanding the benefits of kids learning <br/>
to play an instrument at an early age, he insisted a few years ago that <br/>
Liam learn to play an instrument of his choosing.  He didn&#39;t care what the <br/>
instrument was, as long as Liam was learning to play it.  Liam first opted <br/>
for cello, then piano, then violin, and then guitar.  He did great with all <br/>
these different instruments, but he never, ever chose to practice them.  I <br/>
never forced him to practice, either, and neither did DH.  In spite of not <br/>
ever practicing, Liam has always been REALLY good at whatever instrument he <br/>
attempts and has been extremely focused during his lessons.<br/>
<br/>
I recently (well, today) suggested to DH that Liam might be more into <br/>
playing his guitar if he were learning to play the chords to the Songs that <br/>
He Likes rather than the notes on the first string of the guitar!  I <br/>
remembered that I taught myself to play the guitar when I was a kid, and <br/>
what I wanted to play were the songs I liked.  DH remembered that he taught <br/>
himself and learned from friends that same way, playing the songs he <br/>
liked.  Then, when he got older and saw the need to learn more theory, <br/>
etc., he found a teacher and dedicated himself to it.  Now, DH is really a <br/>
world-class player (jazz and classical).  That&#39;s because he has and has <br/>
always had the passion for it.  Me, too (having the passion for playing the <br/>
instrument, I mean), although I wouldn&#39;t call myself  anything near being a <br/>
world-class player.  But, I am a pretty competent player, and I&#39;m happy <br/>
with my playing and always trying to get better.<br/>
<br/>
I think passion for something can be like a budding flower, and it&#39;s very <br/>
susceptible to the elements.  I can see that Liam has the competence for <br/>
playing an instrument; he just needs the passion.  He loves music, and Liam <br/>
was a little surprised and delighted when I suggested to him that he could <br/>
learn to play the songs he likes right now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad DH saw my point and is going to lay off the Hal Leonard method <br/>
books for now.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts (while I&#39;m supposed to be working).<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the great thoughts!  I do definitely think that those who have a<br/>
passion for music will learn to play no matter what.  I don&#39;t know if my<br/>
daughter has a passion for it.  I guess we will see how things change when<br/>
she does not have to practice, but also when she does not have to do all<br/>
that school work and may have time to practice.<br/>
<br/>
We are not what anyone would call a musical family, but I have always wanted<br/>
to be, lol.  I cannot even carry a tune, but fortunately, both my children<br/>
have more musical ability than I.  I haven&#39;t given up though.  I did<br/>
practice (that would be play) piano today!<br/>
