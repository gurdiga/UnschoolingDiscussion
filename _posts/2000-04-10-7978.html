<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708319272">Hi Brooke,<br/>
Thanks for your support.  You&#39;re right - my opinion of the medical fraternity <br/>
is not high, a fact that puts me in a rather akward postion.  It was a doctor <br/>
who hurt my daughter, and now I&#39;m having to put my trust in other doctors to <br/>
help her.  I know all doctors aren&#39;t the same, but if I had my way I&#39;d never <br/>
deal with another one.  My DH and I actually considered not going through <br/>
with Tess&#39;s surgery, mainly because of our doctor phobia.  Really, I&#39;m past <br/>
most of my anger now.  Most of the time I feel only blessed.  My life has <br/>
been changed for the better through our suffering.  Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Jodye</div>
