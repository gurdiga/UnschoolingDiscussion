&gt; I find most conversation interesting and if I don&#39;t I delete it.  Unschooling<br/>
&gt; to me means that school and life are not separate entities. Thus most topics<br/>
&gt; will relate in some way to unschooling.  Just my .02 cents. Kimme<br/>

How else do we inform ourselves about our world and nurture our<br/>
families?  It&#39;s guaranteed that a lot of topics aren&#39;t going to amuse a<br/>
lot of people a lot of the time...so what?  The list is still providing<br/>
a service for those who wish to express themselves and who can come to<br/>
terms with the choices they&#39;ve made.  Why are we forever wanting to<br/>
limit our interaction with one another?  How many other topics have<br/>
already been censored?  (Breastfeeding, Full-time vs. &quot;career&quot; moms,<br/>
circumcision, now religion etc.)  I&#39;m Canadian and don&#39;t particularly<br/>
care for American politics (i.e. the whole G.W. Bush discussion) but I<br/>
am still benefitting something from the posts.  If we close ourselves<br/>
off from certain subjects and limit our view are we not also limiting<br/>
our thinking?  Does that ultimately benefit our kids?<br/>

Reading Newsweek?  Subscribing to political discussion lists?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind discussing religion, but I invariably delete anything about who <br/>
I should vote for or how disasterous one or another president or supreme <br/>
court judge or governor will be for homeschooling.  It reminds me too, too <br/>
much of Henny Penny and the sky (not) falling.  <br/>
<br/>
My second least topic is choice/pro-life.  Just as it&#39;s too often assumed <br/>
that homeschooling=religion, it is assumed too often that <br/>
homeschooling=pro-life and I resent that.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&#39;Yes I agree, it is a totally personal issue, as there are so very many  factors that can complicate such a profound decision.  Has nothing whatsoever to do with how I choose to raise and educate my children.  <br/>
<br/>
Religion as a factor in others&#39; perceptions of what &quot;homeschooling&quot; means, is annoying to me also, as religion DOES enter into our homeschooling lives, in a very natural and non-forced way.  We do not have religious study time per se, yet I will freely discuss and share anything aobut our family beliefs with my children, or about the beliefs of others, that they want to know.  As members of a religion without temples or churches, all our worship is done at home or in outdoor settings, and our children are a part of that as far as they are interested in being included.  But!  When you tell anyone you are homeschooling, they automatically assume that you are Christian or Christian based, especially in semi-rural, very Mormon, SE Idaho.  I do not enlighten EVERYONE, as it can be very detrimental to our lives due to active perjudice, but I do not lie about it either.  If someone is rude enough to ask point blank, or assumes and says that we are Christian or Mormon, I politely tell!<br/>
 them that we do not prescribe to any organized religion, or that we are not Christian.  Whereupon they look at me as though I am a leper and quickly move to distance themselves from my evil pagan self and family.  Their loss and my gain to have someone like THAT out of my life, but still annoying.<br/>

As a member of the christian community I&#39;ve witnessed this behavior by <br/>
others.  I wish I understood or could explain why people do this but I&#39;m <br/>
mostly stumped myself.  Even Christians of different denominations will do <br/>
this to each other.  Perhaps it just comes down to being suspicious of anyone <br/>
who doesn&#39;t subscribe to our own belief system.  These folks seem to keep <br/>
winnowing down their circle of &quot;friends&quot; until they are looking in a mirror.  <br/>
How boring.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the only one I can control is me and hopefully give my children a <br/>
better model.  I hope I will always surround myself with people who push me <br/>
out of my comfort zone and don&#39;t allow me to become too self-satisfied.  As I <br/>
contemplated this issue I was pleased to realize that the people I am closest <br/>
to are the kind who embrace differences, even find them enjoyable and <br/>
interesting.<br/>
