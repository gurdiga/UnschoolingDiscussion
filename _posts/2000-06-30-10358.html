THE DECLARATION OF EDUCATIONAL INDEPENDENCE<br/>
<br/>
WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for Families to<br/>
dissolve the<br/>
         Educational Bands which have connected them to a faltering Society,<br/>
and to assume among the<br/>
         Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws<br/>
of Nature and of Nature&#39;s God<br/>
         entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires<br/>
that they should declare the causes<br/>
         which impel them to the Separation.<br/>
<br/>
         WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created<br/>
equal, that they are endowed by their<br/>
         Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,<br/>
Liberty, and the Pursuit of<br/>
         Happiness?That to secure these Rights, Education is instituted among<br/>
Men, deriving its just Powers<br/>
         from the Consent of the Educated, that whenever any Form of Education<br/>
becomes destructive of these<br/>
         Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to<br/>
institute new Education, laying its<br/>
         Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form,<br/>
as to them shall seem most<br/>
         likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will<br/>
dictate that a Public Education<br/>
         System long established should not be changed for light and transient<br/>
Causes; and accordingly all<br/>
         Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while<br/>
Evils are sufferable, than to<br/>
         right themselves by Abolishing the Public Education System to which<br/>
they are accustomed. But when<br/>
         a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same<br/>
Object, evinces a Design to<br/>
         reduce them under absolute Government Control, it is their Right, it<br/>
is their Duty, to throw off such<br/>
         Public Education System, and to provide new Guards for their future<br/>
Security. Such has been the<br/>
         patient Sufferance of these Families; and such is now the Necessity<br/>
which constrains them to alter<br/>
         their former Educational System. The History of the<br/>
Government-Controlled, Public Education<br/>
         System is a History of repeated Injuries and<br/>
<br/>
         Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an<br/>
absolute Control over these Families.<br/>
         To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid World.<br/>
<br/>
         THE GOVERNMENT has refused its Assent to Freedom in Education, the<br/>
most wholesome and<br/>
         necessary for the public Good.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has forbidden its Children Freedom of immediate and pressing<br/>
Importance...<br/>
<br/>
         IT has refused Freedom for the Accommodation of large Numbers of<br/>
Families, unless those Families<br/>
         would register with the State, a violation of freedom and privacy to<br/>
them, and formidable to Absolute<br/>
         Control only.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has called together the Nation&#39;s Children at Places unusual,<br/>
uncomfortable, and distant from the<br/>
         warmth and nurturance of their Parents, for the sole Purpose of<br/>
fatiguing them into Compliance with<br/>
         its Measures.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has dissolved Alternatives repeatedly with its unceasing<br/>
bureaucratic requirements, for opposing<br/>
         with manly Firmness its Invasions on the Rights of the People.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has refused for a long Time, after such dissolutions, to cause<br/>
other Alternatives to be carried out;<br/>
         whereby the Educational Powers, incapable of Improvement, have<br/>
returned to the failing System at<br/>
         large for their exercise; the Family remaining in the mean time<br/>
exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion<br/>
         from without, and Convulsions within.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has endeavored to prevent the True Education of the Population of<br/>
these States; for that Purpose<br/>
         obstructing the Natural Process of Learning; refusing to pass others<br/>
to encourage their Individual<br/>
         Efforts...<br/>
<br/>
         IT has obstructed the Administration of True Education, by refusing to<br/>
recognize the Sovereignty of<br/>
         Family.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has made Public School Employees dependent on its Will alone, for<br/>
the Tenure of their Offices,<br/>
         and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has erected a Multitude of new Laws, and sent hither Swarms of Its<br/>
Employees to harass our<br/>
         People, and eat out their Substance.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has kept among us, often against the People&#39;s Will, Standing Armies<br/>
of Social Workers.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has affected to render the Education Establishment independent of<br/>
and superior to the Civil Power.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has...subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and<br/>
unacknowledged by our Laws;<br/>
         giving its Assent to...Acts of...Legislation:<br/>
<br/>
         FOR quartering large Bodies of Compelling Troops among us:<br/>
<br/>
         FOR protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any<br/>
usurpation of Family Sovereignty<br/>
         which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:<br/>
<br/>
         FOR cutting off our Connection with True Education:<br/>
<br/>
         FOR imposing Taxes on us used to Oppress us:<br/>
<br/>
         FOR depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Family Time;<br/>
<br/>
         FOR transporting our Children for large blocks of their time;<br/>
<br/>
         FOR taking away our Family Autonomy, abolishing our most valuable<br/>
Family Connections, and<br/>
         altering fundamentally the Forms of our Families:<br/>
<br/>
         FOR suspending our Parental Authority, and declaring itself invested<br/>
with Power to control for us in<br/>
         all cases whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has abdicated Control here, by failing us its Protection and waging<br/>
Educational War against us.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has plundered our Pocketbooks, ravaged our Family Lives, burnt our<br/>
Trust, and destroyed the<br/>
         Lives of our People.<br/>
<br/>
         IT is, at this time, forging new Laws to compleat the Works of<br/>
Despair, Desolation, and Tyranny,<br/>
         already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely<br/>
paralleled in the most barbarous<br/>
         Ages, and totally unworthy the Government School System of a civilized<br/>
Nation.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive in our Nation&#39;s<br/>
Classrooms, to become the<br/>
         Competitors of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by<br/>
their Hands.<br/>
<br/>
         IT has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored<br/>
to bring on the Inhabitants of<br/>
         our Nation, the merciless Conditioning, whose known Rule of Warfare,<br/>
is an undistinguished<br/>
         Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.<br/>
<br/>
         IN every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in<br/>
the most humble Terms: Our<br/>
         repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury. A<br/>
Public Education System, whose<br/>
         Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is<br/>
unfit to be the Educational<br/>
         Controller of a free People.<br/>
<br/>
         NOR have we been wanting in Attentions to our Legislators. We have<br/>
warned them from time to time<br/>
         of Attempts by their very Government to extend an unwarrantable<br/>
Educational Jurisdiction over us.<br/>
         We have reminded them of the Circumstances that brought us to this<br/>
point. We have appealed to their<br/>
         native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties<br/>
of our common Kindred to<br/>
         disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our<br/>
Connections and Correspondence.<br/>
         They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of Consanguinity.<br/>
We must, therefore, acquiesce<br/>
         in the Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we<br/>
hold the rest of Mankind,<br/>
         Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.<br/>
<br/>
         WE, therefore, the Families of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in<br/>
GENERAL AGREEMENT,<br/>
         Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the<br/>
Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in<br/>
         the Name, and by Authority of Sound, Sane Parental Consciousness,<br/>
solemnly Publish and Declare,<br/>
         That these United People are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND<br/>
INDEPENDENT FAMILIES,<br/>
         they have full Power to levy Choice in Family Education, consider the<br/>
Family&#39;s Values and Time<br/>
         Needs to choose the extent of participation in and support of the<br/>
Public Education System, contract<br/>
         Alliances, establish Family Priorities and Values, and to do all other<br/>
Acts and Things which<br/>
         INDEPENDENT FAMILIES may of right do. And for the support of this<br/>
Declaration, with a firm<br/>
         Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to<br/>
each other our Lives, our<br/>
         Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</div>
