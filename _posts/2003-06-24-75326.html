 </span></blockquote>I do think this is an unfair stereotype. I have met a lot of judgemental Christians, but there are plenty that are not...myself included.<br/>
I hesitate to call myself a Christian oftentimes, because I&#39;m not in the mainstream sense. But the term Christian can simply mean &quot;a follower of Christ&quot; and I do follow his teachings and consider him a great prophet. I also follow the teachings of Buddha and other prophets. But Jesus has a special place in my heart, no doubt because of the way I was raised. <br/>
Regardless, it&#39;s not good to stereotype any group of people...<br/>
&#39;Course I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what the person above was doing. They said in &quot;their experience&quot; and that&#39;s all it is, their personal experience.<br/>
In mine, I&#39;ve met more judgemental ones than not, but they do exist.(the open minded ones that is)<br/>

I agree, and like you said Ren, I thought Tim qualified his statement by <br/>
claiming it was his experience, when I read it, I thought wow, poor guy. I myself <br/>
have only known in real life, not internet relationships,a couple <br/>
self-proclaimed Christians, who do see other POV&#39;s without openly judging. Sometimes it <br/>
starts a dialogue and we get to see where one-another is coming from. I too, <br/>
have friends like Joyce was saying, who just automatically assume I&#39;m a <br/>
Christian. Why do I bother to correct anyone, sometimes they need to know and sometimes <br/>
they don&#39;t. I also have chosen to not correct the assumption when I know that <br/>
my POV would probably strain the relationship. When it comes to Kass and <br/>
Kree, they have gained that skill already, just by noticing that depending on the <br/>
company we are in there are certain religious topics I only discuss to certain <br/>
extents. <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to another observation. A few months back Kass and Kree and I <br/>
were listening to one of our most favored punk bands. We were discussing the <br/>
lyrics of a song and Kree said, &quot;But they are Christian mom.&quot; I responded <br/>
with, &quot;OK and what does that mean? Does it change how you perceive their music?&quot;<br/>
She said, &quot;No, I was just telling you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That brought on a wonderful in the car discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We went on to discuss how religions are often used as shields. Either to wage <br/>
wars on non-believers (regardless of what religion a person may follow) or to <br/>
protect ones self from the possibility of other POV&#39;s. Then we talked about <br/>
why some people have faith and why some don&#39;t. Then why it&#39;s OK to have friends <br/>
and family with differing belief systms. We also talked about actions <br/>
speaking louder than titles or declarations. For me, that is how I discern or judge. <br/>
It was a very exhilirating conversation.<br/>

Rhonda - off to take Kree to the orthodontist.<br/>
