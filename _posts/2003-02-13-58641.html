<br/>
As far was what youve said Re our own &quot;wish we could take back&quot; behaviours..  <br/>
Of course I have those days.. Just like yesterday when I took the N64 away <br/>
for a couple of hours.  But, also just like you said of yourself, I dont <br/>
throw tantrums like my children.    And for all the geneticsmy husband and I <br/>
have passed along to our children, these behaviours were not in them.   If <br/>
they had been, maybe it would be easier for me to identify with thier speical <br/>
needs .<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s always a balance for me in trying to understand what is seemingly out <br/>
of my child&#39;s control because of their out-of-sync issues and what is, for <br/>
them, a learned response to those same issues. I have had to work hard to <br/>
change many of *my* responses to how they are acting once I had a better <br/>
understanding of what their body and mind was telling them. We have all had <br/>
to work hard to be mindful of our first reaction to any situation.<br/>
<br/>
And for us, it is most definitely genetic. Just ask my mom. ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654334406"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Yes, Mary, Sandra does take every opportunity to single me out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I have not yet seen an example of this, but as I&#39;m newly back to these <br/>
discussions, I can only comment on what I&#39;ve seen so far.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As far was what youve said Re our own &quot;wish we could take back&quot; <br/>
&gt;&gt;behaviours.. Of course I have those days.. Just like yesterday when I took <br/>

&gt;&gt;yourself, I dont throw tantrums like my children.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was trying though to also gently point out that tantrums take many forms. <br/>
Our wonderful out of sync children are so sensitive. They see when we are <br/>
letting outside circumstances frustrate and get to us. They can feel when <br/>
we&#39;re taking our own frustations and turning them inward. Every time we <br/>
don&#39;t use a difficult or frustrating situation as a place to learn and grow <br/>
from, we&#39;re modelling a reaction, a mindset for them.<br/>
<br/>
Now of course we&#39;re older, we may not have the same sensory issues, we&#39;re <br/>
different people than our kids, so we hold and act out that tension <br/>
differently. That doesn&#39;t mean we are actively modelling for them how to <br/>
just let the tension go. How to not take a frustration (a difficult video <br/>
game, a challenging comment) and internalize it.<br/>

<br/>
Me too.  Same here.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby would not have done well in school, which is why we didn&#39;t send him.  <br/>
He is biochemically a lot like me, which is why I already had tricks right at <br/>
hand to share with him about how to handle his feelings.  Luckily for us, we <br/>
were on this when he was little, before we knew we were going to be involved <br/>
in homeschooling.  We had helped him develop workable self-calming routines <br/>
when he was a toddler, and we had learned ourselves (Keith and I) tricks for <br/>
helping him center quickly when he was about to spin out.  It was another <br/>
whole deal when Marty became a factor in Kirby&#39;s life.  <br/>
<br/>
Had we used the same methods and ideas our parents had, Kirby would likely be <br/>
a hostile, defensive mess now, and we might be the kind of parents who would <br/>
say we didn&#39;t much like him, and we would probably be grounding him and other <br/>
non-productive parent vs. kid behaviors.  <br/>
<br/>
We worked hard at helping him be the best we and he together could figure out <br/>
for him to be.<br/>
<br/>
Because of running a homeschooling playgroup for many, many years we have met <br/>
other families (&quot;met&quot; is too light a word for families you see weekly, whose <br/>
kids stay over, whose moms share intimate home-stories, etc.) with boys who <br/>
were eight, ten, fourteen and who came to homeschooling because the boys were <br/>
NOT peaceable, self-controlled, likeable guys.  <br/>
<br/>
When someone decides the path they&#39;re on is not leading where they want to <br/>
go, some of them decide to homeschool.  And at that point they make lots of <br/>
decisions.  Will they continue as they were?  What factors in that child&#39;s <br/>
life are making the situation worse?  What could be done to re-direct energy, <br/>
to rebuild self-esteem, to back up (because it DOES involve some backing up <br/>
and being still) and choose a new direction and a new pace and a new idea <br/>
about the destination?<br/>
<br/>
Of all the boys (I&#39;m thinking of five of them specifically) whose parents <br/>
went from structure to unschooling, only one maintained his bristliness, and <br/>
even in that case he wasn&#39;t in trouble for it as he had been in school, <br/>
nobody was attacking him for it, he wasn&#39;t in tears over trying to explain <br/>
his side of situations at home, at school.  He was able to get time and <br/>
privacy to read and be by himself and calm down, luxuries he hadn&#39;t had when <br/>
he was in school and his parents were just desperately trying to get him to <br/>
&quot;be good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So he still has his irritating traits, but he also has real friends.  And <br/>
because I know his parents and his sister and have met an aunt and a <br/>
grandmother, I know that he&#39;s like his dad.  And his dad (though sometimes <br/>
irritating! &lt;bwg&gt;) is a good guy, artistic, hard-working, funny, inflexible, <br/>
controlling, reactionary, and he has learned over the years how to deal with <br/>
his quirks, so he can help his son do it too.<br/>

up. It&#39;s entitled &quot;Special Needs or Just Special.&quot; I never use that term <br/>
special needs except here in these forums. I do it here because I think <br/>
there are parents who need to hear what I have to say. What I have to say is <br/>
that you really can toss those alphabet soup labels out the window once your <br/>
kids are not in school.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are bright and intense and focused and spirited and sensitive and <br/>
moody and wonderful and special.<br/>

to use it to describe my child so someone who doesn&#39;t know him, can<br/>
understand him. Such as a doctor, dentist, beautician etc.<br/>
You are right they are special indeed, as all our kids are!<br/>
