 </span></blockquote>I suppose it depends on your perspective....I have bookends holding up the<br/>
books that are piled on top of bookshelves and most other flat surfaces, due<br/>
to a shortage of booshelves.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;re cheap enough to make, I wouldn&#39;t buy them, either!<br/>

We have literally *tons* of books (we&#39;re publishers - what an excuse! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) and I absolutely love old bookends. I have quite a collection, <br/>
especially of antique metal ones; they&#39;re one of the first things I <br/>
hunt for in antique and second hand stores. I have some beautiful old <br/>
statuary-type bookends, which are kind of like miniature scuptures in <br/>
duplicate. My favorite bookend is a burnt ceramic horsehead bookend. <br/>
It was one of the very few recognizable items my parents pulled out <br/>
of the wreckage of their home after a huge wildfire swept through <br/>
their Alaskan neighborhood a few years ago. I also especially like <br/>
two gemstone bookends one of our sons gave me for my birthday a few <br/>
years ago - they&#39;re a huge elongated crystal-filled geode that was <br/>
split in two and mounted on lovely wooden bases.<br/>
<br/>
So - I have enough books all right (well, maybe not...), but not <br/>
nearly enough bookends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
