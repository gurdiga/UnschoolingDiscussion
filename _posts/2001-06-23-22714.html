<div id="ygrps-yiv-371991997">Thanks for all the great responses.  What I forgot to mention - and don&#39;t <br/>
ask me why - is that we&#39;re not the first in this family to homeschool.  My <br/>
other SIL (this woman&#39;s sister) has homeschooled all of her 9 children, with <br/>
the oldest 24 now... but she used a curriculum and lives in another part of <br/>
the state.  Not someone everyone sees on a regular basis.. and she started <br/>
out this way, didn&#39;t pull the kids from school like I did... maybe this <br/>
makes me different - I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
What the family doesn&#39;t know is our real reason for pulling him - not all of <br/>
it academically related.  Most of it being a very, very bad experience with <br/>
other school kids his last year in school.  We don&#39;t feel this is any of <br/>
their business and intend to keep it that way.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s one of those cases where you have to decide how<br/>
&gt;much info the person can deal with, you know?  What<br/>
&gt;they really want to know, what exactly they&#39;re<br/>
&gt;asking...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m rambling....  I guess I&#39;m thinking about this...  How much <br/>
does she really want to know.. or, as I&#39;m tending to think, is she just <br/>
being nosy??  Really hard to tell with this woman.. she tends to be the <br/>
gossipy type and since she&#39;s the one relative I see regularly she may have <br/>
been given the .... assignment? ... by the others to find out all she could. <br/>
  Yes, I am paranoid - can&#39;t help it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;but I suppose it&#39;s a bit like the breastfeeding counselling info I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;recently been reading back over, if you empathise and try to pick the bits <br/>
&gt;out of her questions, you might find she&#39;s actually wanting to know <br/>
&gt;something she hasn&#39;t really said in the first place...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy!  You&#39;d think after 11+ years of doing that I&#39;d remember those tricks <br/>
wouldn&#39;t you... guess after 7 years off you tend to forget... I&#39;ll try this <br/>
next time - if I keep my calm!<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m making a bad job of cutting a long story short, if you want to know <br/>
&gt;what I mean I can chat if you like :-)  Brain on melt-down due to beer <br/>
&gt;atm... need more food...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like that - e-mail or AIM?? I think I&#39;m feeling a bit alone...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, I know what i wish I&#39;d said after the event!!<br/>
