<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717363423">To make this conversation on one family&#39;s struggle with the <br/>
constitutionalism of homeschooling in MA more palatable to anyone on the <br/>
unschooling list who hasn&#39;t been interested to date:  I don&#39;t find anyone <br/>
involved in the case &#39;doable&#39;.  My hubby just got home though, and he is <br/>
eminently doable!  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Heidi hands Joyce a bag of ice to lower the swelling from banging her head <br/>

<br/>
Joyce, I&#39;m sorry if what I&#39;m writing seems dense to you.  To be fair <br/>
though, frankly, you don&#39;t seem to get what *I&#39;m* saying either. (and I <br/>
won&#39;t be going on about this anymore after this, &#39;cause if we don&#39;t &#39;hear&#39; <br/>
each other now, it&#39;s probably not going to improve anytime soon!)<br/>
<br/>
Joyce said: Waltham&#39;s original position was not that the Bryant children <br/>
had to test. It<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;was that the Bryant parents needed to submit an education plan each year.<br/>
&gt;The Bryants refused. There were legal procedings and the Bryants were<br/>
&gt;ordered to submit a plan. The Bryants said they did. Waltham said they<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t. The Bryants said they did. Waltham said it was inadequate. The whole<br/>
&gt;story there is a mess and involves whether or not they received<br/>
&gt;notifications for this and that or not. The information was filtered by the<br/>
&gt;Bryants so who knows what the truth was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Bryants ended up back in court. They lost again. For whatever reason.<br/>
&gt;Since they weren&#39;t complying the state ended up taking legal custody of the<br/>
&gt;children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even though I don&#39;t live in MA, somehow what you wrote is already my <br/>
understanding of what happened in the Waltham case.  (except for the part <br/>
about was/wasn&#39;t the assessment received.  I&#39;d thought it wasn&#39;t sent in <br/>
the first place.)  (As a side note, it&#39;s a little unfortunate to think that <br/>
a person has to live somewhere to have empathy for or know something about <br/>
someone in a bad spot legally.)  (Yes, even if that person put themselves <br/>
there.)<br/>
<br/>
While it may cause you to tear out large patches of your beautiful glossy <br/>
hair, I still think the family is gutsy in doing what they feel is <br/>
right.  (Naive, maybe.  Optimistic, maybe.  Unfortunate in short-term <br/>
outcome, definitely.)  I understand that you believe adamantly that the <br/>
issue is a constitutional one, and only educational by chance.  Okay.  I <br/>
can see your point.  Unfortunate that the chance landed on educational <br/>
choice and it&#39;s relationship to the possible differences between a state <br/>
and its constitution, but there it is.  It has impact on home education <br/>
legalities, even if the main gist is constitutionalism.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my whole Unschooling thing is supporting complete freedom in <br/>
educational pursuits for both my kids and other families.  This can <br/>
sometimes have legal implications.  I happen to believe that it is not (or <br/>
rather, should not be?) the business of the state (ANY state!) to &#39;assess&#39; <br/>
or to require assessment or to take legal guardianship of homeschooling <br/>
kids away should there not be state-deemed-suitable &#39;assessment&#39; of a <br/>
homeschooled kid&#39;s education, be it in any form, yes, even a few sentences <br/>
from the parent on thier ed plan.  That the state required std. testing <br/>
after presuming to foist themselves as legal guardians (when the DSS <br/>
reportedly admits that the kids are loved and well-taken care of) adds only <br/>
insult to injury.  If some folks don&#39;t mind submitting a <br/>
state-deemed-suitable assessment or plan, then no bother.  If some folks <br/>
find that state-deemed-suitable assessments or plans go against their <br/>
educational beliefs (or constitutional rights), then I support their right <br/>
to challenge such.  My only hope is that it doesn&#39;t legally adversely <br/>
affect other homeschoolers in that state or any other state.<br/>
<br/>
Do I deify them or put them on a pedestal?  Naw.  Admire them <br/>
some?  Sure.  They&#39;ve got fortitude, that&#39;s for sure.  But I admire the <br/>
actions of lots of folks, some mainstream, some not, mostly obscure folks <br/>
who just struggle through life.<br/>

&gt;A model of what? The state constitution?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No.  A model of how to handle homeschoolers who challenge educational laws <br/>
they believe to be unconstitutional or just plain wrong.  A model of which <br/>
educational laws they &#39;should&#39; consider having.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry it all upsets you so.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I heard you. But if you want to be paid attention to it&#39;s helpful to be more<br/>
aware of the environment you&#39;re speaking in and the subtext you&#39;re<br/>
communicating.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to talk about the aspects of homeschooling this case reminds you<br/>
of, then the discussion is going to be frustrating for someone who is trying<br/>
to get across the point that the case has nothing to do with homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are *plenty* of other relevant branching off points to talk about what<br/>
you want to talk about. You could even bring the subjects up out of the<br/>
blue.<br/>
<br/>
Using this case to discuss homeschooling only ties it more firmly in<br/>
people&#39;s minds that it is about homeschooling. And it can *only* be about<br/>
homeschooling if people make up fantastical scenarios about why what<br/>
happened happened that have no basis in what really happened.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even though I don&#39;t live in MA, somehow what you wrote is already my<br/>
&gt; understanding of what happened in the Waltham case.  (except for the part<br/>

&gt; the first place.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Originally they refused to submit an ed plan (not an assessment). And I<br/>
think they didn&#39;t submit an ed plan until ordered to do so by a judge or<br/>
some mediator. Then it gets confusing on what happened. From my<br/>
understanding they were asked many times for the ed plan -- actually many ed<br/>
plans since the case dragged out over 4 yeras and they have 2 kids -- with a<br/>
variety of outcomes: ignoring it, never received the request, town never<br/>
received their ed plan, town rejected the ed plan. (But MA case law says if<br/>
the town rejects a plan they need to prove how, not just say, it&#39;s<br/>
inadequate.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (As a side note, it&#39;s a little unfortunate to think that<br/>
&gt; a person has to live somewhere to have empathy for or know something about<br/>
&gt; someone in a bad spot legally.)  (Yes, even if that person put themselves<br/>
&gt; there.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing wrong with having empathy for the Bryants. I hope everyone who is<br/>
concerned will join the MA state list<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/MAhomeschoolers/)</a> or visit the website<br/>
supporting the Bryants and do what they can to help them.<br/>
<br/>
If all you were expressing was empathy, there wouldn&#39;t be much to argue<br/>
about. But you weren&#39;t just expressing empathy. You were using the case to<br/>
talk about homeschooling. (Much as the Bryants used homeschooling to &quot;get a<br/>
dialog going&quot; about the state constitutution.)<br/>
<br/>
But the case can&#39;t be a useful rallying point for homeschooling discussion<br/>
without making up motivations for the Bryants and the state that don&#39;t match<br/>
reality in order to turn the case into something about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the subtext&#39;s I&#39;m talking about. You may have valid general<br/>
points but there can&#39;t be a meaningful dialog about those points when you<br/>
have to make up the motivations and facts in order for your points to make<br/>
sense. There are real motivations. There are real facts. And those<br/>
motivations and facts can&#39;t be ignored in order to make a point without<br/>
frustrating the heck out of someone who&#39;s trying to point out that you&#39;re<br/>
using a false foundation to argue your points from.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re basing your opinions on what obviously must be true for the case to<br/>
have happened. But the obvious isn&#39;t true in MA. Your understanding of how<br/>
homeschooling works in MA is wrong so the sensible scenario you&#39;ve created<br/>
is wrong. And, therefore, your points, when you use the case to support<br/>
them, are meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While it may cause you to tear out large patches of your beautiful glossy<br/>
&gt; hair, I still think the family is gutsy in doing what they feel is<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;ve been following what I&#39;m saying there&#39;s no logical connection<br/>
between the idea of what is upsetting me and you thinking the Bryants are<br/>
gutsy. Your sentence says I&#39;m irritated that anyone would think the Bryants<br/>
gutsy. Where did I say that? It suggests -- it&#39;s one of those subtexts I<br/>
mentioned above -- that you haven&#39;t understood what I&#39;m saying.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you have understood. Hopefully those were words that just sounded<br/>
good cobbled together. And you cobble words together well. But the ideas<br/>
need to hang together as well as the words for meaning to come through.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;ve used many sentences throughout your posts that don&#39;t hang<br/>
together logically based on what I&#39;m trying to get across, it&#39;s frustrating<br/>
to respond.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I happen to believe that it is not (or<br/>
&gt; rather, should not be?) the business of the state (ANY state!) to &#39;assess&#39;<br/>
&gt; or to require assessment or to take legal guardianship of homeschooling<br/>
&gt; kids away should there not be state-deemed-suitable &#39;assessment&#39; of a<br/>
&gt; homeschooled kid&#39;s education, be it in any form, yes, even a few sentences<br/>
&gt; from the parent on thier ed plan.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, you&#39;re trying to point out how wrong a regulation is and using the<br/>
case to discuss that point.<br/>
<br/>
But the regulation to take children away from homeschooling parents for<br/>
noncompliance doesn&#39;t exist in MA. We don&#39;t have regulations. We have case<br/>
law. So there isn&#39;t a way to discuss a regulation like that based on the<br/>
Bryant case. (And no, I&#39;m not just word wrangling. Regulations and case law<br/>
are different.)<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants *forced* the state to examine a situation the state hadn&#39;t<br/>
examined. No one had set down in writing what would happen if homeschoolers<br/>
refused. When the Bryants refused to comply, the state was backed into a<br/>
corner and forced to use *other* regulations that were written for *other*<br/>
situations, like child neglect, to apply to a situtation it hadn&#39;t handled<br/>
before. (And had the state followed the letter of those regulations, they<br/>
would have taken physical custody of the children too.)<br/>
<br/>
Our homeschooling &quot;requirements&quot; are based on case law. There isn&#39;t anything<br/>
carved in stone about what we must do and what will happen if we don&#39;t. All<br/>
we have is what a judges decided in two cases: Charles and Brunell. It&#39;s<br/>
basically a lot of &quot;this seems reasonable&quot; type of stuff. MA homeschoolers<br/>
are able make the judge&#39;s decisions work with minimal trouble to ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants threatened what works by using homeschooling to make arguments<br/>
about the state constitution. What they did could have forced the state into<br/>
making state laws about homeschooling. And those laws could easily be not<br/>
friendly. Especially to unschoolers which the Bryants claim to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If some folks don&#39;t mind submitting a<br/>
&gt; state-deemed-suitable assessment or plan, then no bother.  If some folks<br/>
&gt; find that state-deemed-suitable assessments or plans go against their<br/>
&gt; educational beliefs (or constitutional rights), then I support their right<br/>
&gt; to challenge such.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And had easier homeschooling regulations been their goal, that would have<br/>
been fine. But that wasn&#39;t their goal. Their goal was to make the state<br/>
realize the state didn&#39;t have a right to create laws beyond the<br/>
constitution. Though I assume the Bryants had no intention of harming<br/>
homeschooling, or making their lives more difficult, their primary goal was<br/>
about the constitution. Which means if faced with a decision between making<br/>
their point and harming homeschooling, they could easily have determined<br/>
their goal was more important.<br/>
<br/>
And they *did* end up making homeschooling more difficult for themselves.<br/>
They could have backed off at many points over the 4 years. But they chose<br/>
the route that led to more difficult homeschooling because their goal wasn&#39;t<br/>
easier homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A model of how to handle homeschoolers who challenge educational laws<br/>
&gt; they believe to be unconstitutional or just plain wrong.  A model of which<br/>
&gt; educational laws they &#39;should&#39; consider having.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this case can&#39;t be used as a model for that. The case is more akin to a<br/>
situation where someone was challeging dog regulations in order to make a<br/>
point about car regulations. They in essence saw a path to easier car<br/>
regulations but taking that path meant they might end up making their lives<br/>
(and perhaps other&#39;s lives) as dog owners more difficult. They chose the<br/>
path that threatened their relatively easy lives as dog owners. And they<br/>
lost.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the Bryants choice of path won&#39;t negatively impact the rest of us<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
