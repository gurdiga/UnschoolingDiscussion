<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575366471">I wish my house was back to &quot;normal&quot;  ( what is normal anyway??)  Ive been <br/>
trying to find somewhere to put thier new stuff and sort of organize thier <br/>
old stuff.  Its time for me to retire some more toys that JP has outgrown. I <br/>
did get all the boxes burned and most of the mess up, but I havent taken down <br/>
my decorations yet.  I usually wait til the weekend after New Years.. <br/>
<br/>
   The boys got an XBOX and a Nintendo 64 ( used) for Christmas and they have <br/>
had fun playing those and watching DVDs on the XBOX.. Landon got the SE LOTR <br/>
Fellowship of the Ring DVD set and its like over 20 hours worth of stuff..   <br/>
Anna got a new sewing machine and a bunch of cross stitch supplies and shes <br/>
been stitching away. <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to make some $$.. but.. so far, nothing <br/>
spectacular has hit me..  Gosh, Ive got enough kids clothes, toys, books, etc <br/>
to open my own second hand store.. ( which, Ive had one before)  But I dont <br/>
have the store to sell it in..   If I could get organized, Ebay might be a <br/>
good avenue, but I dont know,, seems like EVERYBODY sells on Ebay. .. sigh.. <br/>
Maybe a good old fashioned yardsale, but thats about like giving it away.   I <br/>
have skills, I just cant find anyone to pay me for them.. :-)    Well, tax <br/>
refund time is just around the bend. maybe we will survive til Uncle Sam <br/>
kicks us back a few $$..<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well since we decorated the day after Thanksgiving, I was ready now to take <br/>
everything down. We usually wait also until after the new year. And I also <br/>
get the kids moving on cleaning out old stuff in Oct. I anticipate the <br/>
coming of all the new &quot;stuff.&quot; So to make room, every Oct. they go through <br/>
all the stuff they no longer play with and wear. Most of the the stuff goes <br/>
to the festival of our local church.<br/>
The really nice and new looking stuff I save. Which leads me to the next <br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to make some $$.. but.. so far, nothing <br/>
spectacular has hit me..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I consign the really good stuff. I found a great little consignment shop <br/>
close by. She splits the stuff with me 50/50. Doesn&#39;t charge me anything to <br/>
sign up with her and really takes only great looking stuff so she can charge <br/>
higher prices too. I make quite a bit that way. All the grown out of toys <br/>
and clothes that aren&#39;t worn go there. Nice little chunk of change for me <br/>
without all the hassle. My baby decided she doesn&#39;t want to play with baby <br/>
toys and follows along with the older two. I had a ton of really nice and <br/>
new stuff to get rid of. The lady was ecstatic at the store when she saw <br/>
what I had. Much better than a yard sale.<br/>

LOL!!! I&#39;m kind of screwed in 4 ways here. My sons birthday is Jan. 4th, so <br/>
it comes quick. Then a daughters birthday in Feb., another daughters <br/>
birthday in March and my husband in April. I have a rest with my last <br/>
daughter born in Oct.!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Every year we let the birthday child pick out where they would like to spend <br/>
the day or night. Nothing too pricey but the zoo or museum or even the <br/>
arcade are usual choices. Then we have the family birthday party thing <br/>
going. Just really like to have something for them though to open. Christmas <br/>
is our big deal around her with birthdays coming a close second. At least 3 <br/>
or 4 gifts are in order. He got a computer last year, not sure we&#39;ll beat <br/>
that this year though. My daughter got a puppy last time and the another <br/>
daughter a kitten, we surely won&#39;t be doing that again anytime soon!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Since our son gave us barely nothing to go on for Christmas, it will be even <br/>
tougher now. Usually there are a few things leftover that he asked for from <br/>
Christmas that he didn&#39;t get. Not this year!<br/>

will be 3 in Feb (oh can&#39;t forget hubby&#39;s birthday in Feb too). My birthday is in <br/>
June and I always felt sorry for those kids who had birthdays around christmas...<br/>
swore I would never do that to my kids LOL! Ahh well. I just spread out my oldest&#39;s<br/>
presents over the two (my kids are the only grandkids on both sides, so they get<br/>
royally spoiled over the holidays). I have a few ideas for kyle that he did not get<br/>
for Christmas, so that should work...I like the idea about an experience though...might<br/>
work when my guys are a bit older..right now they expect presents!<br/>

I&#39;ve got the same issue -- dd turned 8 on 12/21.  She ends up getting <br/>
all her gifts at once; we just make sure some of the gifts under the <br/>
tree has birthday wrap.  There are usually things she wants, or I <br/>
think she would like, that she doesn&#39;t get, so those become <br/>
suggestions for friends who ask when she has her party in January.  <br/>
Consumables are always good -- art kits, craft projects, etc.  So are <br/>
tickets for theatres, museums, amusement parks, etc.<br/>

___<br/>
I used to consign all of my kids stuff.  I owned a consignment/resale store <br/>
for a few years... That was a GREAT set up..I got thier clothes for nearly <br/>
nothing and then ended up making $$ on them.. But, that was before I had baby <br/>
#4, Jon Phillip, who is now 7.  He&#39;s the only one still in kids size <br/>
clothing.  Ethan is on the top end in boys size 16-18, going into a mens <br/>
small.  I could still consign thier clothes, (even though adult sizes dont go <br/>
as well as kids) but I got lazy!!..I have SOOO MUCH piled up, its <br/>
overwhelming.  I have just got to tackle it.. Get it all out, wash it, <br/>
organize it.. etc etc.   When I did the  outgrown clothes thing every season, <br/>
I pretty much stayed on top of it.. But, after I sold the store, I started <br/>
letting it pile up and then just procrastinated getting it all together.   Im <br/>
the same way with my clothes.. GEEZ, I have a ton I need to get rid of too.. <br/>
<br/>
And.. On the other topic.. Close to Christmas birthdays<br/>
<br/>
Ethans is in Sept, Annas in Oct, Landons in Nov.   None of them are too close <br/>
to Christmas to really have any effect on what or how much they get, but, Its <br/>
like I have 3 months in a row of birthday parties and celebrations.. THEN its <br/>
Thanksgiving. THEN Christmas!  Dh&#39;s bd is in March, Mine and JPs are in <br/>
April..  Then its a long break til we do it all over again.   Actually, there <br/>
is a birthday ( or 2) in my extended family in every month of the year.   <br/>

&lt;&lt; &quot;What do you buy a kid that just had Christmas&quot;!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s birthday is January 14, and what he gets for his birthday is usually <br/>
whatever he might have been disappointed not to get for Christmas!  This year <br/>
it will be a video game.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m inviting people over, because he had no birthday plan.  They&#39;re big kids <br/>
now and lots of his friends drive, so if they get here and decide to go out <br/>
and do something that will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
He will be fourteen on the fourteenth, and that won&#39;t ever happen again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438673744">My birthday and sons birthday is Dec 20.  5 days before Christmas and a <br/>
shared occasion.  We make an ENORMOUS deal of his birthday all day <br/>
long, getting excited about it the day before and making the cake then <br/>
too.  We celebrate my birthday with dinner out (although we both get <br/>
the birthday song and a free desert each).<br/>
<br/>
We keep all of the balloons on the floor and streamers up until Dec. <br/>
22.  That morning we take them down and start getting all excited about <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
For us, birthdays are a big thing.  We make Christmas more of a day <br/>
off, family rest and fun day and don&#39;t do many gifts- usually just a <br/>
few big or one expensive gift.  We make birthdays about the person and <br/>
how special they are and how blessed we are to have that person in our <br/>
lives and Christmas is more family and a celebration of our faith as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
So to sum up- lots of gifts or surprises on the birthday and fewer on <br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this helps,<br/>

We had a great holiday and on Monday we got to Two Towers, finally!!  Now I&#39;m sifting through the books,  making sense of all.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-427840644">Thanks Sandra,   thought you&#39;d know,   that&#39;s kind-of a big part of the movie,  I&#39;m surprised they take those kind-of liberties.  Got me really depressed.     Thought I missed something when I read it.<br/>
 <br/>
These books are amazing,   I had never read them through and am doing so right now.   Tolkien was incredible!  The history and the details he had to have come up with,   the 4 CD pack we got is awesome too,  little bit about Tolkien and how he came up with some of it.   We&#39;ve watched 2 of the appendicies and this afternoon we&#39;re going to watch the other 2.   Then its onto the commentaried version of the film.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t read this when I was younger,  Alec, 9yr son, has attempted reading it but its a bit above him.   He reads more and more tho&#39; as he watches more and more.<br/>
 <br/>
Leads to great conversations,  in the appendicies it talks about the maker of the armour,  really cool.<br/>
 <br/>
Also just found Ian McKlellan&#39;s web site and it has some great pics of them when they were filming.   Fun!<br/>

No.<br/>

Hurons do.  The &quot;tree cattle&quot; gather outside, and the orcs who run away run <br/>

<br/>
YES!  His journal entries with snapshots are GREAT!! I was glad when I came <br/>
across those.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**4 CD pack **<br/>
I meant 4 DVD pack,  I&#39;m showing my age, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I say &quot;CD&quot; all the time and my kids calmly say &quot;DVD&quot; and I <br/>
dispassionately say &quot;whatever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They figure I&#39;ll die before I get it.<br/>
I figure I don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
If they didn&#39;t want them to be called the same thing, why did they make them <br/>
LOOK the same way?  And putting them in different sized plastic cases doesn&#39;t <br/>
change anything.  And the fact that some are DVD-ROM things AND  music (CD) <br/>
AND can be played in a DVD player does NOT help me get it straight.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I came to feel better about Faramir&#39;s loss of integrity (and <br/>
Frodo&#39;s, there for a minute) at the hands of Peter Jackson & company:<br/>
<br/>
The Bible spawned and supports LOTS of different denominations of <br/>
Christianity. The old testament spawned and supported Judaism, Islam and <br/>
Christianity.  They all pick and choose and translate and focus in their own <br/>
ways.   It&#39;s all the same book, in a real way.<br/>
<br/>
So I figure I can worship Tolkien&#39;s vision of Faramir but still go to Peter <br/>
Jackson&#39;s church on special occasions.<br/>

the Fellowship, leaving out Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wights, which <br/>
didn&#39;t have much impact on the story in the first place, and adding <br/>
the great horse chase scene with Arwyn (it was nice to have at least <br/>
one woman doing some action in the movie as there isn&#39;t much in the <br/>
book). <br/>
But the 2nd movie seemed to change a lot more things, and for less <br/>
clear reasons. I was really surprised to see them leave the whole <br/>
Ent/Huron part out of the Helm&#39;s Deep scene, and I have no idea why <br/>
they would do that. Also can&#39;t imagine why they cast Eowyn as such a <br/>
waif. Have to wait until the Director&#39;s cut DVD with voice-over to <br/>
see why, I guess. <br/>

the making of the movie, but more about Tolkien&#39;s childhood and young <br/>
adulthood and the things that shaped his vision of the story. It has <br/>
a fascinating part about his interest in the Tolovana, a largely <br/>
spoken/song history of a people from the far north of Finland (I <br/>
think, if my memory serves). Also a fair bit about his participation <br/>

Hobbit/LOTR world were written by him in the trenches). Netflix has <br/>
this DVD, and some local movie rental places do as well.<br/>

the Hobbit a year earlier. That was a perfect time to read it, as age <br/>
11/12 you still have that magical belief, but you&#39;re poised on the <br/>
edge of teenage passionate involvement with things. I remember my two <br/>
best friends and I would ride our horses far into the woods and <br/>
pretend to be three elven queens. We would gallop through the forests <br/>
with the dark forces in imaginary chase behind us. Maybe that&#39;s why I <br/>
love that chase scene with Arwyn so much, come to think of it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re reading LOTR right now (I&#39;m reading out loud to the kids), and <br/>
enjoying it all over again. And I agree, that 4-disk set is great! <br/>
The kids have been fascinated with all the detail on how such a <br/>
monumental piece of fantasy was created on screen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893789580">We are also new fans of LOTR and Tolkien. A friend of ours <br/>
bought Nick &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; video, which lead to <br/>
numerous books and guides based on the movies. Nick then <br/>
listened to the BBC audio &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and we saw the <br/>
movie Christmas day. We plan on seeing it again. We just <br/>
bought the book &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, and are very anxious to <br/>
get started on that. It is such a fabulous story, and has led to so <br/>
many interesting discussions. Even my dh, who was reluctant to <br/>
watch the movie, has become a big fan. <br/>
<br/>
I ran into some opposition when friends found out how <br/>
passionately Nick loves the story. They believe that he is too <br/>
young (8) to fully appreciate the books, and that he should not be <br/>
exposed to them at all until he is &quot;much older&quot;; same goes for <br/>
Shakespeare. The strongest opposition came from the woman <br/>
who gave him the video in the first place. Apparently we should <br/>
be sticking with &quot;Flat Stanley&#39; and &quot;Mooch the Messy&quot;. As they say <br/>
here in NY, forgeddaboutit... <br/>
<br/>
As for Alan Rickman, we just saw HP 2, and he looked dreadful.  <br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still love him, he still has a sexy voice, but <br/>
let&#39;s hope he looks a little less, um, puffed up in the next <br/>
installment.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t agree.  My dad read all the Tolkien books aloud to us when my<br/>
brother was only 6.  (I was eight.)<br/>
<br/>
Later, I first read The Hobbit to myself when I was 11 and lying in a<br/>
hammock on a warm day at camp.  It was great, but it was especially<br/>
great because it was hauntingly familiar.<br/>
<br/>
I think the stories that you hear when you are really young sink in<br/>
deeply and become a part of your soul.  Of course Shakespeare and<br/>
Tolkien would be great choices for that.<br/>

I read every single one of the Nancy Drew books that was in print, up<br/>
until I was twelves.  So if there&#39;s a special circle in hell for readers<br/>
of formulaic fiction, uh, save me a seat!<br/>
<br/>
(My son&#39;s current read aloud taste is Starfleet Academy stories about<br/>
the early days of Worf, Geordie and Capt. Janeway.  I may be doubly<br/>
damned. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 <br/>
I had a teacher in 4th grade who was totally into Tolkien and had us reading The  Hobbit.   It was very difficult at the time,  I remember this, but I also remember that it was the one thing that kept my interest.    Everything else seemed sooo boring.   I am definitely glad she introduced it to us, even tho&#39; I didn&#39;t do that well on the tests,  when I read it myself I missed alot,  yet it still seaped  into me.  And we got to watch the cartoon and dissect the plot and characters with that too.<br/>
 <br/>
I really wish I would have had a class in middle school or high school that would have assigned LOTR,    I would have loved it,  oh well,  I can love it now.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t agree.  My dad read all the Tolkien books aloud to us when my<br/>
brother was only 6.  (I was eight.)<br/>
<br/>
Later, I first read The Hobbit to myself when I was 11 and lying in a<br/>
hammock on a warm day at camp.  It was great, but it was especially<br/>
great because it was hauntingly familiar.<br/>
<br/>
I think the stories that you hear when you are really young sink in<br/>
deeply and become a part of your soul.  Of course Shakespeare and<br/>
Tolkien would be great choices for that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Kelli!<br/>
<br/>
Your message reminded me of when I was in high school.  In the 10th grade I <br/>
think it was we read Tennyson&#39;s Idylls of the King.  It was dry stuff with <br/>
language that shot straight over my head.  But, I had a GREAT teacher.  She <br/>
was really animated and fun and pointed stuff out and explored some of the <br/>
denser language with us.  The result was that I actually enjoyed that <br/>
class.  In fact, I never even cut that class (just all the others).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful to that teacher for showing me the possibilities where <br/>
literature is concerned.  It&#39;s interesting:  Liam (8yo son) loves to read <br/>
at night but definitely lobbies to have me do the reading rather than his <br/>
dad.  I think it&#39;s because I try to dramatize the reading (change my voice <br/>
for the different characters, etc.), and dh just plain reads.  I have Mrs. <br/>
Costello to thank for that.  I remember the day she introduced <br/>
&quot;unscrupulous&quot; as a vocabulary word.  She always presented vocabulary words <br/>
in some funny way; she mimed or acted out the different parts of the word <br/>
so we would remember it.  The -pu- part was the funniest of all.  In <br/>
retrospect, I think she probably could see how goofy working on vocabulary <br/>
words really was.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enough of that!  Happy New Year, everyone!!<br/>
