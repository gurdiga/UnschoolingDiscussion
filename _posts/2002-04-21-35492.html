<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157695807"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;No, Camille, what I said was *IF* he is unhappy I&#39;d worry.  I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt;there and can&#39;t assess his happiness, she is.  And she did say one<br/>
&gt;thing that made me wonder if he is getting frustrated, she talked<br/>
&gt;about him stressing out over some of the things she talked about.<br/>
&gt;Which is why I said *IF*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bridget<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say by and large he&#39;s ecstatic. He has a lot of smiles, a lot of laughs, <br/>
and is just coming to this stage where he finds certain words funny -- last <br/>
night he rolled on the floor laughing over the phrase &quot;more pudding&quot; which <br/>
he was saying in this bizarre gravelly voice that was making husband and me <br/>
blow coffee out our noses from laughing so hard. :)<br/>
<br/>
So, while he is in general happy, and in general all this alphabet business <br/>
makes him very happy, it also makes him very intense. When he can&#39;t find the <br/>
letter M for example, from the magnet set, he gets upset to the point of <br/>
screaming. When he can&#39;t find a certain book that he thinks he needs to go <br/>
along with whatever video... he will tear the house apart and end up in a <br/>
pool on the floor weeping. That&#39;s what I mean by stressed out. I have seen <br/>
him get obsessed before. There was a counting/numbers obsession and before <br/>
that an Elmo obsession. But nothing like this. This is causing big roller <br/>
coasters of extreme joy and extreme angst.<br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t really necessarily bad I suppose. But I find *myself* now sort <br/>
of feverishly putting the alphabet stuff (blocks, books, etc) away thinking <br/>
&quot;IS IT ALL THERE? IS IT IN ORDER?&quot; because I&#39;m anticipating Benny feeling <br/>
awful if it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So... since the happy/unhappy was an issue... I will report officially that <br/>
he is 90% happy, and 10% frustrated. Which, for a two-year-old, I&#39;d say is <br/>
pretty normal? Part of this is that I am not used to being around kids and I <br/>
have nothing to compare him to really.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

Funny you said this, I who am raising one of these children (now 14 and never <br/>
a dull moment) thought just the same thing, LOL. You can bet your life will <br/>
never be boring!<br/>

were in your shoes, I would be careful to watch for increasing <br/>
frustration and irrational mood swings.  I also would educate myself <br/>
about OCD and other illnesses like that just for a little more peace <br/>
of mind.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Camille? <br/>
<br/>
Did I get the wrong book? I can&#39;t find my copy - but the book I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
talks a LOT about how to set up an environment and plan in advance in order  <br/>
to help a kid who is easily frustrated and angered to have enough time and <br/>
space and support to learn to handle things. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if that was the wrong one -- I&#39;ll dig around in my boxes of books and <br/>
hope I didn&#39;t give it away already.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it could be the book I was thinking of and it could have had other <br/>
stuff that I might also have objected to -- I tend to read through these <br/>
kinds of books pretty quickly and if they give me some great insight I tend <br/>
to forget about the rest of what they might say, since I take what makes <br/>
sense to me and leave the rest.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure people here aren&#39;t looking for some authority to blindly follow - <br/>
but someplace to get ideas to consider - that they&#39;ll use as launching pads <br/>
for more ideas of their own.<br/>
