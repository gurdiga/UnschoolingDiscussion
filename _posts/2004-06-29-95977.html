The above were three books that my library had that are picture books.  The <br/>
books below have pictures and sections that parents can read to younger <br/>
kids about homeschooling childhoods that both parents and child might find <br/>
interesting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744711391">Nichole, sorry, those weren&#39;t links, just the copy line of the library <br/>
listing of the book.   I didn&#39;t realize that they would come across as web <br/>
links.  Just check your library on-line system to see if they have them.<br/>
