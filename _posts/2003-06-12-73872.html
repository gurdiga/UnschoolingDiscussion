<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687667041">I just wanted to say that I totally agree.  Who needs preschool?  I used to volunteer at a church-sponsored preschool and their most frequent complaint was why weren&#39;t the parents teaching them the alphabet, time, numbers, etc.  The teachers couldn&#39;t teach them those things in the time they had with them in a group setting.  In reality, it was child care with a thin layer of educational content.<br/>

Anyway, I just thought it was really cool to see the 2.5 y.o. connections <br/>
being made tonight. And he said &quot;Appo&quot; when I pulled the apple from the fridge <br/>
instead of the usual &quot;tthhhh&quot;.:) Quilts and apples......who needs preschool?<br/>
