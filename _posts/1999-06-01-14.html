That is just what I was thinking.  Especially looking at her unstable<br/>
background and possible abuse issues, I think she will need a lot of<br/>
healing and settling in time.  Time for her to know that we love her, and<br/>
are not going to send her back or reject her, no matter what may be in her<br/>
past.  Time for her to come to terms with her past, and I am almost certain<br/>
that she will need counseling.  Unless she turns out to be much more well<br/>
adjusted than we expect.<br/>
<br/>
One of our homestudy questions is &quot;What experiences or characteristics do<br/>
you think will enable you to care for a hard to place child?&quot;  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what to tell them, except that we will be patient and will love her<br/>
unconditionally.  We will seek couseling for her if she needs it, and do<br/>
anything else we can to help her.....What else IS there?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing feels quite like opening yourself, your family and your parenting<br/>
up to the scrutiny and judgement of the homestudy processed, to see if you<br/>
will be &quot;approved.&quot;  How many people can do that with no trepidation?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943630945">Hi, Nancy.  How about telling them you are flexible and will be able to adjust<br/>
and accomodate to match her natural learning style. :-)  Hey, homeschoolers are<br/>
expert at this!  ~ Shannon<br/>
