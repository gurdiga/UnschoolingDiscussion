&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It&#39;s my feeling that the posts I read of Ned&#39;s about &#39;schools&#39; a few days<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ago were very ontopic for unschooling but a few people on the list kept<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; asking him to be quiet.  I really didn&#39;t get that at all.  I understand<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; many<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t agree and are afraid of what newbies will think but in my experience<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the time someone finds &#39;unschooling&#39; they have already learned a little<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of what Ned was speaking of (gatto and similar info.) anyway and it&#39;s not a<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; big surprise to hear someone here speak of these things.<br/>

&gt; Not sure how my name got attached to that but it wasn&#39;t a quote from me.<br/>

<br/>
Luz and I received an email  -- privately with a message that seemed to be<br/>
to me. asking for our newsletter and unschooling information packet.<br/>
<br/>
The message seemed to come from this address:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lurningathome@...">lurningathome@...</a><br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and was signed by  Joyce<br/>
<br/>
When I returned an email to that address, the recipient was not named Joyce<br/>
and had not sent the original message. Please try again, and...<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else who would like to receive our unschooling info packet, just<br/>
email us at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nedvare@...">nedvare@...</a>   It&#39;s free, of course, always.<br/>
