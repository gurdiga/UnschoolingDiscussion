&lt;&lt; It&#39;s <br/>
odd that someone would create something so beautiful for such a bazaar <br/>
purpose.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They probably just lifted it from elsewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
The sentiments are great for unschoolers, in any case!<br/>
<br/>
Someone did the math for us (somewhere) once about how many people <br/>
chain-letter petitions would go to [not as many as they hope, and some people <br/>
would get them (very) repeatedly] and how thoroughly uncountable they are in <br/>
any case, and yet people send them to me all the time, thinking somehow they <br/>
will help get women out of prison somewhere or keep PBS on the air or keep <br/>
&quot;the government&quot; from charging us five cents per e-mail, on and on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211048626">when I recently had my daughter, Nora (who is 4 months) I started going to these new mother groups on Tues mornings just to meet some other moms and get out of the house right after having her. There were about 20 women and for the first two months we all were so in love with our babies and I felt so connected to them all. Friendships have always been hard for me as we moved alot when I was a kid and I always kind of missed out on solid friendships... so anyways, around three months all of the mommies went back to work, almost all of them to crazy hours and train rides in to the city (we live near Boston) and I remember the turning point was when I went to a morning get together at one of the mommies houses in Rowley. I pulled in to her huge house in my used (very old but trusty and roomy for kids:) car and looked around at all of the other mom&#39;s cars (these really really expensive cars), and I felt all of the sudden insecure, like that shoudl be us, like I was cheating my kids out of something because we had not been keeping up with the Jones&#39;, now greanted it was a fleeting thought but it was a turning point for me and it was the initiation of me looking into homeschooling. I realized that my husband (who works really hard and supports us just fine) and I had made a conscious decision that we chose our kids above the riches, the rat race....ect. It was a nice night when I drove home and realized what we had done without even really trying, we did what came natural to us and it feels right to us. Just my thoughts on the poem and the reflections of the last writer. Kelli<br/>
