<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418849066">About a year ago on a couple of the lists I&#39;m on, we talked about NAFTA and<br/>
the danger of allowing just any trucks on U.S. highways.  Anyone who has<br/>
traveled extensively in Mexico and/or owns a trucking outfit knows that the<br/>
conditions of commericial vehicles are pathetic AND extremely dangerous with<br/>
the vast majority not having any insurance and a good percentage of the<br/>
drivers not being licensed.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the roads are dangerous enough and now Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and<br/>
California in particular can look forward to even more problems on their<br/>
roads!<br/>
<br/>
All the bright boys that thought up NAFTA ought to be shot!<br/>

&gt; Bush to Open Country to Mexican Truckers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; February 7, 2001<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By STEVEN GREENHOUSE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Bush administration indicated yesterday that it would reverse a<br/>
&gt; Clinton administration policy and begin allowing Mexican trucks to<br/>
&gt; haul goods throughout the United States, notwithstanding concerns<br/>
&gt; about the trucks&#39; safety problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Administration officials disclosed the plan on the same day that a<br/>
&gt; dispute-resolution panel ruled that the United States was violating<br/>
&gt; the North American Free Trade Agreement by not already allowing<br/>
&gt; Mexican trucks to enter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;The president has said that Nafta trucking provisions should be<br/>
&gt; implemented, and we intend to do that,&quot; said Clair Buchan, a White<br/>
&gt; House spokeswoman.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The proposed change, long sought by Mexico, comes just 10 days<br/>
&gt; before Mr. Bush travels to Mexico.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The president has not decided on the exact timing of the move,<br/>
&gt; administration officials said, noting that it remained unclear<br/>
&gt; whether he would agree to a limited opening of the border or a<br/>
&gt; broad one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The plan is expected to generate protests. Union officials voice<br/>
&gt; fears that Mexican truckers, who often earn one-fourth as much as<br/>
&gt; unionized American truckers, will take American jobs. And consumer<br/>
&gt; groups, noting that 41 percent of Mexican trucks failed American<br/>
&gt; inspections at the border, argue that the trucks will endanger<br/>
&gt; Americans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the Teamsters union, said, &quot;We will<br/>
&gt; continue to fight the opening of the border until the Mexican<br/>
&gt; government can guarantee their standards are higher and the U.S.<br/>
&gt; can guarantee that we have the inspection facilities to keep unsafe<br/>
&gt; trucks out.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The administration&#39;s move surprised some union leaders, because<br/>
&gt; Mr. Bush has courted the Teamsters more than any other union.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Under Nafta, the United States was supposed to give broad access<br/>
&gt; to Mexican trucks in 1995, but President Bill Clinton, under heavy<br/>
&gt; pressure from his union allies, kept the provision from taking<br/>
&gt; effect, saying Mexico had to do more to address safety problems<br/>
&gt; first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  That year, the Mexican government, invoking Nafta&#39;s provisions,<br/>
&gt; asked that a five-member panel be set up to determine whether<br/>
&gt; Washington was violating the accord.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  In its decision, the panel - two Americans, two Mexicans and a<br/>
&gt; British chairman - unanimously ruled that the United States would<br/>
&gt; be in violation if it did not begin considering applications from<br/>
&gt; Mexican trucking companies. More than 160 applications are pending.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;The decision says the Department of Transportation must consider<br/>
&gt; applications on individual merit and may not refuse authority<br/>
&gt; across the board to all Mexican companies,&quot; said an American trade<br/>
&gt; official who had read the decision, which is to be released today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  The official said the panel made clear that the United States was<br/>
&gt; entitled under Nafta to set its own safety standards and to ensure<br/>
&gt; that Mexican trucking companies meet them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;As we move forward, the United States will not compromise highway<br/>
&gt; safety in any way,&quot; the official said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Currently, Mexican truckers can drive up to 25 miles north of the<br/>
&gt; border. Then they normally transfer their loads to American trucks.<br/>
&gt; Each year, about five million commercial trucks cross the border,<br/>
&gt; hauling about three-fourths of the $250 billion in United<br/>
&gt; States-Mexico trade.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Mexican officials say opening the border will save American<br/>
&gt; consumers millions of dollars by lowering transportation costs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;The cost has been lost business opportunities for Mexican<br/>
&gt; trucking companies,&quot; said Lu√≠s de la Calle, under secretary in<br/>
&gt; Mexico&#39;s Economy Ministry. &quot;The system we have today is archaic. To<br/>
&gt; change tractors at the border creates lines, which means more lost<br/>
&gt; time and greater costs of doing business.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  A 1996 letter that Mr. Bush, then Texas&#39; governor, signed with the<br/>
&gt; governors of Arizona, California and New Mexico, said, &quot;This<br/>
&gt; transborder trucking delay robs the entire U.S.- Mexico border<br/>
&gt; region of the full economic benefits that Nafta promises.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Under Nafta rules, the United States could continue to keep the<br/>
&gt; trucks out, but then it would have to compensate Mexico by, for<br/>
&gt; example, agreeing to let it impose punitive tariffs on some<br/>
&gt; American goods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Critics warned that opening the border could backfire politically<br/>
&gt; for Mr. Bush if Mexican truckers caused accidents that killed<br/>
&gt; Americans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &quot;It is imperative that we continue to limit access for these<br/>
&gt; dangerous trucks even if it means paying trade sanctions,&quot; said<br/>
&gt; Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a consumer safety<br/>
&gt; group. &quot;It is impossible to inspect every truck, and we cannot<br/>
&gt; knowingly put drivers at risk by inviting dangerous rigs onto U.S.<br/>
&gt; highways.&quot;<br/>
