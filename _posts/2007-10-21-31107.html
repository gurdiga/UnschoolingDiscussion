<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550319427">Thought I&#39;d do an October post regarding my new Yahoo group for grandparents<br/>
called  GRANDleap (a take off from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/L-E-A-P</a> )<br/>
We&#39;re up to 45 members, 12 more since my September post.  I just wanted to<br/>
remind everyone to ask your parents if they&#39;d like to hop on board.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter where they are in their thinking. We are all here to support<br/>
each other. Here&#39;s the link, Thanks! Collette<br/>
