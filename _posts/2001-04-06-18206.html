&gt; Well.... yeah... my great-great grandfather was one of the first <br>
&gt; people into what&#39;s now Sonoma County; his homestead was where the <br>
&gt; Santa Rosa airport is now. Burke Hill Road, somewhere up north on Hwy <br>
&gt; 101, is named for him. When it got too crowded around Santa Rosa he <br>
&gt; sold the homestead and took the first wheeled wagon into some big <br>
&gt; valley up by Ukiah.<br>
<br>
 </span></blockquote>That is so cool! We&#39;ve been to the SR Airport lots (also Ukiah - great natural foods co-op there!) and I managed a barn about 10 minutes away from the Airport for a couple of years. It&#39;s kinda cool to hear some of the history of my old stompin&#39; grounds!<br>
<br>
I sold insurance a long time ago, and while doing some calls, I ended up talking to an older lady who had also grown up in Sonoma County, and she remebered when it was all fields and there was a train that went from Healdsburg to Santa Rosa (or Sebastopol.. I don&#39;t zackly remember...) It&#39;s so neat to get a glimpse into what an area used to look and be like... from an individual perspective. I love history in that way... from the stories of people.<br>

Thanks!<br>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Nina, the train did a fork at Healdsburg.&nbsp; You 
could go with the Express which went through SR (the old train depot and hotels 
which are all stone, are still standing and have been renovated) or the Local 
which went to Sebastopol.&nbsp; The one that went to Sebastopol went riight down 
the middle of the street through downtown Sebastopol.&nbsp; They only took those 
tracks up in the 70s.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The line still goes through SR and Healdsburg and 
will be up and running this summer.&nbsp; By next summer they are hoping to have 
it open from Marin to Humboldt with excersion trains running.&nbsp; They are 
buying up old Pullman&#39;s (real antiques with all that cush red 
velvet).</font></div>
