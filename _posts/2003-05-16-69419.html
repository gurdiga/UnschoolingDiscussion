    That was one of the reasons I left the room. So the Dads could speak.<br/>
Please tape this. I really want to hear but also want the Dads to speak<br/>
freely. There side is important to maybe understand my own dh.<br/>
<br/>
    He leaves us, or me, alone on how things are handled but I really would<br/>
like for him to be more involved. My questions would be how do I encourage<br/>
him? How can I help him see and use the same respectful language and<br/>
lifestyle without correcting him? The way he was raised has a lot to do with<br/>
it. He won&#39;t read what I suggest. How can I help him along? Oh and he won&#39;t<br/>
come to the conference. I&#39;ve tryed. ;-)<br/>
    Kelly thanks again for all you&#39;ve done. It can&#39;t be said enough. I&#39;m<br/>
sure it&#39;s ruff on you and your family.<br/>

&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>
is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>
excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>
the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>
analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>
grace.&quot;<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Conference-dads<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last year we had a &quot;Reluctant Dads, Reluctant Husabands&quot; presentation.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately (or fortunately???), it was attended by many women. Ben thought<br/>
&gt; that it was a little difficult for the dads to &quot;open up&quot; because they kept<br/>
&gt; being cut off by the women! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He&#39;s requested some time to approach JUST the dads and let them air concerns<br/>
&gt; and questions. I&#39;m not sure *when* this will be, but Ben wants to get the<br/>
&gt; husbands/dads alone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;ll happen, I just haven&#39;t &quot;scheduled&quot; it. Let your husband know. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
