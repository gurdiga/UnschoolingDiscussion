<div id="ygrps-yiv-330654146">I cannot *imagine* what races through your mind when you&#39;re laying in the<br/>
hospital in the CCU and still having young kids you need to nurture and<br/>
love. I&#39;d go crazy. Somehow in my warped mind, it would be easier to deal<br/>
with if one was old, had grown kids and....well, you get my point.<br/>
wow.&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
