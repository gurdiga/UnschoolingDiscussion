<div id="ygrps-yiv-531909556">I&#39;ve been reading the Christmas traditions with great interest as i <br/>
would love to start something new and a little different for Sterling <br/>
to build memories on.  Growing up, we had the usual routine &quot;get to sleep so <br/>
Santa could come, wake up early to open presents, big traditional <br/>
dinner, play with toys all afternoon, eat turkey or ham sandwiches <br/>
that evening from the leftover dinner&quot;.   I can&#39;t really think of any <br/>
one thing that was unique and special that set our family&#39;s Christmas <br/>
apart from anyone else&#39;s.  In that respect, i&#39;d like Sterling&#39;s to be <br/>
different in some way.<br/>
<br/>
We usually have the big dinner and leftovers later that evening <br/>
although i&#39;m leaning toward getting away from this for the reasons <br/>
many of you mentioned...  more time to enjoy each other and less time <br/>
in the kitchen on the holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Sterling is 3yo.  Every Christmas so far, we open a few gifts from <br/>
relatives xmas eve and let him stay up late to get him good and tired <br/>
so he&#39;ll go to sleep quicker with all the built up anticipation of <br/>
Santa&#39;s arrival.  <br/>
<br/>
Christmas week, the bedtime story is &quot;Santa Mouse&quot; several nights.  <br/>
On Christmas Eve, we leave a piece of cheese in the tree for Santa <br/>
Mouse as well as the milk and cookies for Santa and carrots for the <br/>
reindeer.   We read &quot;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; as the last <br/>
thing before lights out.  <br/>
<br/>
Christmas Day is pretty routine relative to what most people do <br/>
regarding presents, playing, dinner, etc.  However, one of the first <br/>
thing Sterling looks for is not whether Santa ate the cookies, but <br/>
whether Santa Mouse ate the cheese!!  We take the cheese and leave a <br/>
small special gift from Santa Mouse in it&#39;s place.   his reaction is <br/>
so precious!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to reading more ideas!!<br/>
