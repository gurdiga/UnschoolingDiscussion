<div id="ygrps-yiv-720147655">My sister emailed me this from the AKhomeschoolers email list. I thought <br/>
you&#39;d all enjoy it....it&#39;s so true. Thank goodness unschoolers realize the <br/>
importance of all this!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&quot;If I had my child to raise all over again,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d finger paint more, and point the finger less.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d do less correcting, and more connecting.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d take my eyes off my watch, and watch with my eyes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would care to know less, and know to care more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d take more hikes and fly more kites.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d stop playing serious, and seriously play.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would run through more fields and gaze at more stars.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&quot;I&#39;d do more hugging, and less tugging.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I would be firm less often, and affirm much more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d build self-esteem first, and the house later.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;d teach less about the love of power,<br/>
&gt; &gt;And more about the power of love.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362773416">Its sad because it seems like this poem was written as a reflection.  The <br/>
writers children are already grown, and she is regretful.   I&#39;m glad that I <br/>
have realized this BEFORE my kids were &quot;raised&quot;   But the poem is a great <br/>
reminder that I am doing the right thing and I won&#39;t have to regret not doing <br/>
them<br/>

I love this. I have printed it out to remind myself just to be with my kids<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
I love your quote. My son Jess loves the Owl and the Pussycat poem. He<br/>
recited it once at a concert. Not long after that we were at a friend&#39;s<br/>
house having dinner and he found a runcible spoon on the table so everyone<br/>
got to hear the poem again! He was so delighted to discover that they<br/>
actually existed outside of the poem! I just love the enthusiasm kids have.<br/>
It&#39;s so full of life.<br/>
