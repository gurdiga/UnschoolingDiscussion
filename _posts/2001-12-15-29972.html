<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855027180">Greetings fellow unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
Yesturday I was told that my son is an Indigo Child. While the term was <br/>
vaguely familiar (there goes that mommy brain) I took some time to <br/>
research it on the web.<br/>
<br/>
I was very interested to see that a lot of learning disabilities, ADD <br/>
(AHD?) people are really misunderstood Indigos. A lot of it made sense, <br/>
since the LDs are being more and more diagnosed.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely commend all of you unschoolers, no matter what method you <br/>
choose to unschool. We are the future for radical change in educational <br/>
methods.<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be,<br/>
Kolleen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032662749">Kolleen, Could you expand on this &quot;Indigo child&quot; ? I have never heard of this <br/>
before and you have piqued my interest! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Thanks! <br/>
Blessed Be,<br/>
