&lt;&lt; I realize that.  I just posted because there is another side to the <br/>
story and I thought that a more narrow definition of spanking (versus <br/>
hitting and beating) would clarify the other side.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We all know the other side, Mike.  You&#39;re not telling us anything new at all.<br/>
We know about Jesus, too.  Many here are former fundamentalists.  Some are <br/>
currently fundamentalists.  But I doubt there&#39;s anyone here who learned <br/>
anything new about grace or Jesus or Baptists from your posts.  But those who <br/>
were already irritated with proselytization are more irritated now.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that the main objection to the UN&#39;s proclamation (or whatever <br/>
status it has) on Rights of the Child is among fundamentalist Christians who <br/>
want to protect their right to whip children.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty embarrassing for those in the U.S. who would prefer for them to <br/>
just stop, that in front of all the other countries our country is saying, <br/>
&quot;NO, children don&#39;t have rights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So you came here looking for support.  Go to the Christian homeschooling <br/>
boards if you want supporters for the rights of spankers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Even if they argue with her <br/>
or oppose her like Myranda is accused of doing, in that situation she <br/>
will also not YELL or scold.  She only does it online. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I scolded a mom at the library for spanking her child.  I told a grown <br/>
teenaged boy who had come to my house to get money from his mother that if he <br/>
wanted to talk to his mom that way (he was being hateful to her in front of <br/>
some other homeschooling families) he needed to go to HER house to do it, <br/>
because I didn&#39;t want him doing it at my house.  He was stunned, but he said <br/>
&quot;okay,&quot; and got the money and left.<br/>
<br/>
I will speak up when I think someone is harming another person.<br/>
<br/>
I will tell my children when I think they&#39;re wrong, but my children are more <br/>
responsive than you and Myranda are to discussion of important issues. If one <br/>
of my kids started to defend spanking, I might raise my voice.  But there&#39;s <br/>
no earthly reason they would.  When they&#39;ve seen it they&#39;ve been appalled and <br/>
said things like &quot;Why can&#39;t she think of something better to do?&quot; or &quot;That <br/>
kid wasn&#39;t hurting ANYTHING, doing [whatever it was].&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Insulting our integrity, Mike, will not defend your position.  It only makes <br/>
you look desperate.<br/>

<br/>
In response I would note that while there may (I know of none) be<br/>
groups who oppose the treaty because of spanking, there are other<br/>
reasons to find that the treaty is not acceptable, such as the no<br/>
parental right to notice of abortion. as explained in the<br/>
International Planned Parenthood Federation brochure on it:<br/>
<br/>
. decide yourself whether to be sexually active or<br/>
not<br/>
. enjoy a safe and healthy sex life in which you<br/>
protect yourself and are protected by your partner<br/>
against disease and illness<br/>
. feel completely well and happy in your body and<br/>
your mind<br/>
. decide if, when and how many children to have<br/>
... .<br/>
If you tell a medical person or a teacher something that you don&#39;<br/>
t want anyone else to know, then he or she should respect your<br/>
privacy. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585106783">Sandra, why would you assume that the child would be put up for adoption? Why would you assume that parents of pregnant teens never told their children about sex? Thus far, I&#39;ve agreed with all of your principles if not the way you state them/carry them out, but seriously, this just brought tears to my eyes and my stomach is in knots. <br/>
<br/>
If a grandmother is willing to take and raise a grandchild as her own, why should she not be given that chance? Why should the daughter who is still under her parents roof and usually still 100% supported by her parents, be allowed to decide the fate of a child totally on her own, without a clear thought in her head and fear in her heart? Why shouldn&#39;t a father have a right to his own child? <br/>
<br/>
Abortion has it&#39;s place, but not as a method of birth control born out of fear of the unknown! Do you realize how many more babies would die just because Suzy doesn&#39;t want to tell Mom she&#39;s pregnant? Is that a good enough reason to justify killing a child, denying that little person a right to life? Excuse me while I go vomit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181457848">Many folks, not just parents and not just those who oppose<br/>
abortion, might reasonably object to a policy that favors a child<br/>
making a major medical decision - including not only whether, but<br/>
which provider and with what funds - in the absence of those who<br/>
love them best and have more experience with alternatives.<br/>
Further, even those who think that a minor might be able to make<br/>
those decisions in some cultures can reasonably object to a<br/>
blanket provision that in all cultures and in all circumstances<br/>
the UN imposed decision making process should be required as a<br/>
matter of law.<br/>

the baby is up for adoption, he shouldn&#39;t have any rights at all over that <br/>
baby because he didn&#39;t marry the mother.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that this new &quot;right&quot; of fathers came about because the states <br/>
are tracking bio-dads down and suing them for child support rather than just <br/>
give the mom and baby welfare money.  <br/>
<br/>
If he and the mother didn&#39;t have a couple relationship and didn&#39;t intend to <br/>
have a baby, and he&#39;s gone and uninformed, he is only the father by a very, <br/>
very slim thread.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sandra, why would you assume that the child would be put up for adoption? <br/>
Why would you assume that parents of pregnant teens never told their children <br/>
about sex?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do us all a favor and don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know that happens a LOT in <br/>
conservative Christian families.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you realize how many more babies would die just because Suzy doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to tell Mom she&#39;s pregnant? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how many teenaged girls kill themselves rather than tell their <br/>
dads that they&#39;re pregnant?<br/>
<br/>

reason to justify killing a child, denying that little person a right to <br/>

Instead of vomiting and reading some more, how about you go spend time with <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m against abortion in nearly all circumstances - I would say it&#39;s okay<br/>
in cases similar to ones where a procedure that necessarily results in<br/>
one of a pair of conjoined twins dying  would be okay. I don&#39;t really<br/>
have any desire to argue the abortion question on this list, but I wanted<br/>
to reply to this. I think both biological parents on a child should have<br/>
the right to say, at or before birth, that they want to be parents or<br/>
don&#39;t want to be parents. If abortion is legal, then I think both parents<br/>
should have to agree, and neither should want to raise the child (and be<br/>
a parent) or place the child for adoption. If the dad can be forced to<br/>
pay, he should be allowed to chose  whether or not he wants to be a<br/>
parent during the same time frame the mother gets to chose. MHO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told Rain for years that I&#39;d be really, really upset if she had an<br/>
abortion, and that if she becomes pregnant I will do whatever she wants<br/>
me to do to help her avoid that, from raising the child myself to helping<br/>
her out while she&#39;s pregnant or whatever. I&#39;d make the same offer to most<br/>
kids I know...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332927275">If abortion is legal, then I think both parents<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; should have to agree, and neither should want to raise the child <br/>
 </span></blockquote>(and be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a parent) or place the child for adoption. If the dad can be forced <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pay, he should be allowed to chose  whether or not he wants to be a<br/>
&gt; parent during the same time frame the mother gets to chose. MHO.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been through 5 childbirths.  If someone had a right to decide, <br/>
other than me, that I had to go through 9 months of pregnancy and<br/>
labor and all that, that does to my body, I would freak out!!<br/>
NOT that I wouldn&#39;t do it again if I became pregnant.  But the <br/>
thought of someone *making* me do it, is inconcievable.<br/>
I can imagine the multitude of negative feelings I would have.<br/>
It&#39;s just not a good idea...<br/>
