<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842495008">I believe that if you pick and choose your therapist well, you can use<br/>
them for diagnostics and not necessarily continue to see them.  There<br/>
have to be a few therapists out there who are willing to do that.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - When she was in school, they did a full round IEP testing on my<br/>
younger daughter.  It showed exactly what I knew it would but the<br/>
principle of the school said, and I quote, &quot;We don&#39;t like that particular<br/>
test, so we are going to ignore the results of that one.&quot;  We started<br/>
homeschooling within 6 months and did not ignore the results of that<br/>
test.  She is a visual learner with a problem processing verbal<br/>
information.   Knowing that helped me to know which things she would like<br/>
to do and which she would probably not - and that was very important for<br/>
me to know because she is the one who would go along with anything just<br/>
because it is her personality.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I&#39;m glad I ask you because I want to diffuse this misunderstanding <br/>
&gt; immediately! I do *not* believe there is a proper age to be reading. <br/>
&gt; My concern with dd is that she *wants* to read but struggles, etc. <br/>
&gt; I am *not* forcing her to see a therapist but I question the wise <br/>
&gt; women on this list about the wisdom of doing this or not. I want to <br/>
&gt; know what others think. Personally, I prefer to steer clear of <br/>
&gt; therapists because I didn&#39;t find them to be very helpful for my <br/>
&gt; personal situation a long time ago. <br/>
&gt; With regard of pushing to learn basics.... again, I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; what&#39;s right to do or *not* do.  I wonder if kids need that basic <br/>
&gt; knowledge of adding & subtracting & reading to be *able* to do all <br/>
&gt; the other glorious things their little hearts lead them to! I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; KNOW!!! I did teach the basics with one child but not with the <br/>
&gt; other, as stated earlier. The one that is unhappy is the one not <br/>
&gt; taught. <br/>
&gt; I believe this list has enough room to be open for discussion of <br/>
&gt; variations on how to get to a comfortable level of unschooling and <br/>
&gt; problems, ideas and support surrounding these issues.<br/>
