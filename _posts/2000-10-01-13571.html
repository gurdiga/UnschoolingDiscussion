&gt; **&gt;Town Hall Question<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;August 31, 2000<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am a mother of six children and enjoy the freedom of home schooling. I<br/>
&gt; &gt;have not heard you address this issue. Do you feel parents should have<br/>
&gt; &gt;the freedom of choice to home school their children? This is a concern<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt;mine and I would like to hear your view of this subject.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yvonne Myrick<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Yvonne, thank you for visiting my website and asking an important<br/>
&gt; &gt;question about educating our children. As you well know, parents are a<br/>
&gt; &gt;child&#39;s first teachers. Home schooling is a growing effort by many<br/>
&gt; &gt;parents to direct the education of their children. There are no U.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Department of Education regulations related to home schooling. States<br/>
&gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and reporting, to assure<br/>
&gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement or<br/>
&gt; &gt;discourage parents from teaching their children in their home.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase individual<br/>
&gt; &gt;attention for children. It can also increase parental involvement in<br/>
&gt; &gt;their children&#39;s lives. These elements are essential to improving<br/>
&gt; &gt;education for our children attending public schools as well. My<br/>
&gt; &gt;administration would be fully committed to making sure more students in<br/>
&gt; &gt;public schools get individual attention through Head Start, voluntary<br/>
&gt; &gt;universal preschool, and smaller classes. I wish you and your children<br/>
&gt; &gt;great success in home schooling. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615762767">I don&#39;t think anyone should cast their vote on the basis of a single issue.<br/>
Homeschooling is but one of the factors you must evaluate when deciding who<br/>
to vote for.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is a homeschooling forum, I will stay away from other issues and<br/>
point out the following:<br/>
<br/>
Almost 1 in 10 of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are<br/>
members of the NEA. The NEA (National Education Association - the largest<br/>
teachers union)has nearly 2.5 million members and the AFT (American<br/>
Federation of Teachers - another union) has more than 1 million members. In<br/>
the sphere of political influence, these two unions are extremely well<br/>
funded, represent 3.5 million members, and influence many people because<br/>
they have the image of representing &quot;education&quot; rather than being seen as a<br/>
unions that represents teachers. They have been against school choice,<br/>
accountability for teachers, charter schools, public money to support any<br/>
form of education other than government run schools, and school reform.<br/>
Their primary mantra is that all the educational problems would be solved if<br/>
more money was given to government run schools and teachers. (Private school<br/>
teachers are paid less than government school teachers and that the cost of<br/>
attending private school is less per student than the cost of government<br/>
school. Most people agree that private schools are doing better than the<br/>
government schools, so how can more money be the issue?)<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s look at what Gore said in his response and I think you will see that<br/>
the words reveal some biases. Applying a Clintonesque interpretation of the<br/>
meaning of words, I see the following:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; States<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>
&gt; reporting, to assure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement . . .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So he would do nothing to alter states that have set parameters like testing<br/>
and reporting, but is the statement carefully worded to allow changes in<br/>
states that do not require testing or reporting?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase individual<br/>
 </span></blockquote>attention for &gt; &gt; &gt;children. It can also increase parental involvement in<br/>
their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;These elements are essential to improving education for our children<br/>
 </span></blockquote>attending<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does anybody else detect that typical bias that sure, some people can<br/>
homeschool successfully, but not many? How many opponents to homeschooling<br/>
start off with saying that homeschooling can be very successful for &quot;some&quot;<br/>
families followed by a &quot;but&quot; and their list of objections. Notice that Gore<br/>
doesn&#39;t even say that homeschooling can be successful, only that it can<br/>
increase &quot;individual attention&quot; on the children and increase parental<br/>
involvement. He mentions that these are important for public school kids<br/>
too, and immediately uses that to segue into his initiatives for government<br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
In his response, Gore does not use any adjectives to describe homeschooling.<br/>
He seems to be very careful to not say anything positive about it, while not<br/>
being negative either.<br/>
<br/>
Clinton and Gore have been very reserved about homeschooling and have<br/>
expressed<br/>
concerns that while it can work out fine, accountability needs to be in<br/>
place to make sure the parents are doing their job.<br/>
<br/>
Clinton said while he would not choose it for his own child, home schooling<br/>
can work well when students and parents are made to answer for the students&#39;<br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We should say, &#39;Look, there&#39;s a good way to do this and a not-so-good way<br/>
to do this,&quot;&#39; and require that home-schooled students meet academic<br/>
benchmarks, he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if you&#39;re going to do this,&quot; he added, &quot;your children have to prove<br/>
that they&#39;re learning on a regular basis, and if they don&#39;t prove that<br/>
they&#39;re learning then they have to go into a school -- either into a<br/>
parochial or private school or a public school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Gore campaign has criticized Bush&#39;s stance on homeschooling as follows:<br/>
<br/>
   &quot;Bush has repeatedly called for more accountability in public schools,<br/>
    but has made no effort to apply those standards to home schooled<br/>
    children. In Texas, Bush has supported home schooling, despite the<br/>
    fact that Texas mandates no regulations on attendance or achievement<br/>
    standards for home schooled students and requires no certification<br/>
    for home school teachers. Texas officials have even criticized the<br/>
    Texas system for offering the parents of truant children a way to get<br/>
    around the system without actually educating their children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gore has even been against vouchers and school choice because of the<br/>
influence of the NEA, and Liberman had to retreat from his long held stance<br/>
of supporting vouchers once he got the VP nomination.<br/>
<br/>
The record in Texas (which has one of the least restrictive homeschooling<br/>
laws in the nation) is a pretty good indicator of the Bush attitude about<br/>
homeschooling. Bush has a strong stand on public school accountability,<br/>
which I do not see as a conflict. Schools should be held accountable to<br/>
parents who are entrusting them to educate their children. Most parents with<br/>
children in public schools would definitely want that school accountable for<br/>
their education efforts. However, parents who take full responsibility for<br/>
the education of their own children do not have to be held to the same<br/>
standards. They are providing a service for themselves and their own<br/>
children and can judge if it is meeting their needs.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some comments by someone who lived in Gore&#39;s home state:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I lived in TN a few years ago when we were putting in a mobile home on some<br/>
&gt;land.  I swear we had to get a permit for blowing our noses!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;to homeschool your elementary kids was pretty simple, just<br/>
&gt;have a high-school diploma or GED and tell what curriculum you&#39;ll be using<br/>
&gt;to school your child(ren), *but* unless you had your BA you couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;homeschool your middle or high schoolers unless you had an umbrella school.<br/>
&gt;TN seemed to be extremely regulated in all areas.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the area of education, I think it is clear that one candidate wants to<br/>
focus on improving government education and one candidate wants to focus on<br/>
improving education opportunities in a variety of formats.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-927213063">I don&#39;t see any quotable sources (besides unnamed) to support what you are <br/>
saying.  I think that to &quot;translate&quot; what Gore is saying and then quoting <br/>
&quot;unnamed&quot; sources to support your opinion is weak at best.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that not all members of the NEA are against homeschooling since <br/>
my sister and sister-in-law are both members and teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Bush&#39;s accountability adds to more testing.  So now, the children will be <br/>
focusing even more on passing these &quot;tests&quot; and not on true learning.  It is <br/>
a good thing that homeschooling will be flexible under Bush, since the kids <br/>
who are in public school will only be learning how to test and it will no <br/>
longer even be an option for us.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;question about educating our children. As you well know,<br/>
&gt; &gt; parents are a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;child&#39;s first teachers. Home schooling is a growing effort by many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;parents to direct the education of their children. There<br/>
&gt; &gt; are no U.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Department of Education regulations related to home<br/>
&gt; &gt; schooling. States<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; reporting, to assure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discourage parents from teaching their children in their home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase<br/>
&gt; &gt; individual<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attention for children. It can also increase parental<br/>
&gt; &gt; involvement in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their children&#39;s lives. These elements are essential to improving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;education for our children attending public schools as well. My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;administration would be fully committed to making sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; more students in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools get individual attention through Head<br/>
&gt; &gt; Start, voluntary<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;universal preschool, and smaller classes. I wish you and<br/>
&gt; &gt; your children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great success in home schooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687014693">Let&#39;s take a good look at Dubya&#39;s letter:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education, in every form, must be concerned primarily about results.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is straight out of a Farris campaign for testing.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Home-schooling has shown those results. Research shows that children<br/>
taught at home consistently score higher on national standardized tests of<br/>
reading, math and language skills.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reference to H$LDA backed research using testing.<br/>
<br/>
Although some have called home-schooling a &quot;non-traditional&quot; approach to<br/>
education, the idea goes way back - and is mentioned in the Book of<br/>
Proverbs: &quot;Hear, my son, your father&#39;s instruction. And do not forsake your<br/>
mother&#39;s teaching.&quot; That&#39;s about as traditional as it gets. As President, I<br/>
will work to protect and preserve this noble tradition in America.<br/>
<br/>
Again, a reference straight from the 3R&#39;s backed Farris approach to<br/>
homeschooling.  And exactly whose &quot;noble tradition&quot; will he use as the<br/>
model?  H$LDA&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
And, looking close to home, which I figure brother Jeb is, Florida is a<br/>
mess and is knee deep in Farris manipulated garbage in homeschooling and<br/>
Gothard in public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda who doesn&#39;t want Farris or H$LDA or Gothard in her business!<br/>

&gt; they&#39;re learning then they have to go into a school -- either into a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;    &quot;Bush has repeatedly called for more accountability in public schools,<br/>
&gt;     but has made no effort to apply those standards to home schooled<br/>
&gt;     children. In Texas, Bush has supported home schooling, despite the<br/>
&gt;     fact that Texas mandates no regulations on attendance or achievement<br/>
&gt;     standards for home schooled students and requires no certification<br/>
&gt;     for home school teachers. Texas officials have even criticized the<br/>
&gt;     Texas system for offering the parents of truant children a way to get<br/>
&gt;     around the system without actually educating their children.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Gore has even been against vouchers and school choice because of the<br/>
&gt; influence of the NEA, and Liberman had to retreat from his long held<br/>
 </span></blockquote>stance<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of supporting vouchers once he got the VP nomination.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The record in Texas (which has one of the least restrictive homeschooling<br/>
&gt; laws in the nation) is a pretty good indicator of the Bush attitude about<br/>
&gt; homeschooling. Bush has a strong stand on public school accountability,<br/>
&gt; which I do not see as a conflict. Schools should be held accountable to<br/>
&gt; parents who are entrusting them to educate their children. Most parents<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children in public schools would definitely want that school accountable<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their education efforts. However, parents who take full responsibility<br/>
 </span></blockquote>for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the education of their own children do not have to be held to the same<br/>
&gt; standards. They are providing a service for themselves and their own<br/>
&gt; children and can judge if it is meeting their needs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are some comments by someone who lived in Gore&#39;s home state:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I lived in TN a few years ago when we were putting in a mobile home on<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yvonne, thank you for visiting my website and asking an important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;question about educating our children. As you well know,<br/>
&gt; &gt; parents are a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;child&#39;s first teachers. Home schooling is a growing effort by many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;parents to direct the education of their children. There<br/>
&gt; &gt; are no U.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Department of Education regulations related to home<br/>
&gt; &gt; schooling. States<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; reporting, to assure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and progressing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discourage parents from teaching their children in their home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase<br/>
&gt; &gt; individual<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attention for children. It can also increase parental<br/>

&gt; &gt; your children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great success in home schooling.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; **&gt;Town Hall Question<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yvonne, thank you for visiting my website and asking an important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;question about educating our children. As you well know,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parents are a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;child&#39;s first teachers. Home schooling is a growing effort by many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;parents to direct the education of their children. There<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are no U.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Department of Education regulations related to home<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; schooling. States<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have set parameters, such as regular testing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reporting, to assure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that children in home school settings are learning and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>progressing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nothing in my education proposal would alter this arrangement or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;discourage parents from teaching their children in their home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For those who have the means, home schooling can increase<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; individual<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attention for children. It can also increase parental<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; involvement in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their children&#39;s lives. These elements are essential to improving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;education for our children attending public schools as well. My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;administration would be fully committed to making sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more students in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;public schools get individual attention through Head<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Start, voluntary<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;universal preschool, and smaller classes. I wish you and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great success in home schooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202381466">Sunday I didn&#39;t get any mail from two of the e-groups lists.  I sent a test<br/>
message to 5 e-group lists and to a couple of other group lists.  The other<br/>
3 e-group lists came in hours apart and the other 2 never showed up at all.<br/>
