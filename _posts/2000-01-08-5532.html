i&#39;m like this though i only have one son, who is 4 and we manage.   it may take<br/>
a bit of time because the kids will need to make an adjustment but if she&#39;s<br/>
honest with them i believe respect for everyone&#39;s needs can be reciprocal.   we<br/>
do have days when we drive each other nuts but much more often than not we just<br/>
work things out.  i&#39;m forwarding some excerpts (which i sent under a different<br/>
thread but i think it fits here as well) that you might want to pass on.   if<br/>
there is enough interesting things around the kids, eventually, will happily<br/>
involve themselves and become self-directed.   who knows maybe her kids are a<br/>
bit like her and will enjoy the time alone.<br/>

i thought i would pass on some excerpts from and article &quot;an unschooler&#39;s<br/>
lament:  what&#39;s so hard to<br/>
understand&quot; by mary griffith (the author of two handbooks for homeschooling and<br/>
unschooling).  the article<br/>
was published in the mag paths of learning.<br/>
<br/>
&#39;i discovered three elements common to unschooling families:<br/>
<br/>
an environment conducive to exploration and experimentation.  to put the matter<br/>
bluntly, we unschoolers<br/>
have lots of stuff around to play with.   the nature of that stuff varies with<br/>
the interests and needs of each<br/>
family; from books overflowing their shelves, to pots and pans to stack and<br/>
bang, to backyard garden to<br/>
cultivate, to a screaming fast computer, our homes have lots of easily<br/>
accessible materials around for children<br/>
to investigate.   if we want our kids to learn by following their own<br/>
interests, we need to offer them plenty to<br/>
catch those interests.<br/>
<br/>
adults as models and facilitators.  unschooling parents, like most other<br/>
parents, learn rapidly that &quot;do as i say,<br/>
not as i do&quot; does not work very well with children.   unschooling kids need<br/>
people around them who provide<br/>
models of learning by the way they live and in activities they pursue.   if we<br/>
parents are not obviously<br/>
curious about and interested in the world around us, if we ourselves never ask<br/>
questions and search for<br/>
answers, if we never just try things and see what happens, it&#39;s unlikely that<br/>
our kids will do so, either.<br/>
<br/>
trust that children will learn.   for most people, this is the big obstacle to<br/>
understanding unschooling and<br/>
allowing it to work.   perhaps the conventional school education that created<br/>
our own model of learning<br/>
creates an impression that learning is supposed to be difficult or boring, or<br/>
that learning cannot and will not<br/>
occur unless someone is explicitly teaching, providing information in little<br/>
age-appropriate packets, giving<br/>
quizzes on wednesdays and tests on fridays.   eventually, once we&#39;ve bitten our<br/>
tongues and sat on our hands<br/>
and held our breaths long enough to let our kids learn to trust their own<br/>
abilities, we discover that we can<br/>
trust their abilities as well.   in fact, we discover that it&#39;s almost<br/>
impossible to stop our kids from learning, that<br/>
kids, already intensely curious, are eager to indulge their curiosity.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
she goes on to say:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;of course,  even better than applying manufacturing models of more recent<br/>
vintage than the industrial<br/>
revolution to education and learning would be to drop the dehumanizing<br/>
industrial models entirely and start<br/>
treating both children and adult learners as full, active participants in the<br/>
educational process.   in other<br/>
words, instead of looking at improving instructional delivery systems or<br/>
accountability procedures, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
we talk seriously with our kids about their particular educational paths,<br/>
learning from them how they learn<br/>
best and what they find helpful or obstructive to their learning processes?<br/>
aren&#39;t our kids entitled to direct a<br/>
process that prepares them for their own future?&#39;<br/>
<br/>
she concludes by saying:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;however, let me be clear: &quot;because it works&quot; isn&#39;t a sound enough reason for<br/>
me to advocate unschooling in<br/>
particular and, more generally, treating our children as full partners in our<br/>
lives.   our children are fellow<br/>
human beings - they are our colleagues in the making of the world, in the<br/>
creation of our joint future.<br/>
treating them as fully human, with respect and decency, recognizing them as<br/>
people just like us, is what we<br/>
owe them and what we owe ourselves.   it&#39;s simply the right thing to do.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
though this is purely philosophical  i hope it will be of some use to you.  for<br/>
me having a strong grasp of the<br/>
underlining concept helps me work with all the many of variables we face each<br/>
day.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337492877">I have a friend who is teetering on the brink of removing her kids from <br/>
school.  She has a pretty progressive ideas about education, but is a little <br/>
afraid of unschooling because she thinks she would have to do it 24 hours a <br/>
day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year.  She&#39;s afraid her 3 kids wouldn&#39;t give <br/>
her a minute&#39;s peace and that if she was trying to paint, sew or cook when a <br/>
kid came up and wanted a book read to him or a frog dissected she would feel <br/>
guilty if she said &quot;Not now.&quot;  I think she wants to know how many hours and <br/>
minutes she needs to give her kids each day before she turns off the guilt <br/>
button and attends to her other priorities.<br/>
<br/>
For me, sometimes I find my son&#39;s questions thrilling enough that I have the <br/>
strength to push back my bedtime and participate in what he&#39;s doing while <br/>
yawning, and other times I tell him that I&#39;ll be available to do what he <br/>
wants in the morning, but now I&#39;ve collapsed.  Interruptions when I&#39;m awake <br/>
and working are not much of a problem for me.  I&#39;m not a linear person, and <br/>
it&#39;s pretty easy for me to handle a brief interruption and go back to what I <br/>
was doing.  (And sometimes I download mail or hunt for something on the <br/>
internet with a kid in my lap while reading a picture book.)  My friend <br/>
really likes long, uninterrupted blocks of time to think and do.  Does this <br/>
make her a bad fit for homeschooling in general and unschooling in <br/>
particular?  Her kids are 1, 4.5 and 6.5.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Betsy</div>

12 -- the answer is 12.  This is what I always tell the kids when they ask me <br/>
something that has no answer -- and once in a blue moon I am right.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the answer is that there is no answer.  Unschooling (even <br/>
non-unschooling) doesn&#39;t just stop because it gets to be 11:00.  But is <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to start because it is 8:00 either.  <br/>
<br/>
You set up your days as you like.  She doesn&#39;t need to become completely <br/>
unstructured just because that&#39;s how I am -- or more structured because <br/>
someone else is. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;  My friend <br/>
 really likes long, uninterrupted blocks of time to think and do.  Does this <br/>
 make her a bad fit for homeschooling in general and unschooling in <br/>
 particular?  Her kids are 1, 4.5 and 6.5.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like long, uninterrupted blocks of time too.  Don&#39;t get them very often -- <br/>
but I do like them.  <br/>
<br/>
I take my time.  Take it.  Don&#39;t wait for everything to be done -- it never <br/>
is.  <br/>
I prioritize -- kids, then me & hubby, then errands, then business stuff, <br/>
then, way down the list, housework.   In the me part is where I get to sit <br/>
outside and read, type on the internet way too long, watch dumb TV to wind <br/>
down, take a long bath, etc.  Sometimes I feel deprived that I don&#39;t get more <br/>
time, but it&#39;s enough.  It really is.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is balanced against the time I would be spending driving the kids <br/>
back and forth to school, doing homework, attending PTA and teacher meetings, <br/>
etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you have to be a whirlwind of a hser to be a success.  <br/>
Sometimes quiet reflection is a good thing.  Maybe her kids will get a chance <br/>
to see it in action as they observe her. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big commitment but well worth it, imo.<br/>
