<div id="ygrps-yiv-2129315239">Hi everyone,<br/>
  I am new to the list so I&#39;ll introduce myself  some.  I live in Southern <br/>
California, the desert portion and oh is it ever hot today!  I am 31 yrs old, <br/>
mom of three kids ages 6, almost 9 and a 10 yr old.  I&#39;m seriously looking to <br/>
home school the 8 yr old who is behind in school and can&#39;t seem to catch up.  <br/>
He is a visual learner which isn&#39;t always the way teachers teach in schools.  <br/>
The year has just begun and already I&#39;m at wits end.  I talked to his teacher <br/>
last week and voiced my concerns and her comments were &quot;Well, he isn&#39;t the <br/>
lowest in the class and you can always retain him next year.&quot;  Sheesh, that <br/>
didn&#39;t fill me with a lot of hope.  The school has decided he compensates so <br/>
qualifies for no extra help though he is 2 grade levels behind.  I guess you <br/>
have to be 3 or 4 grade levels behind to get help around there which just <br/>
does not make sense to me.  So last week I started making calls for <br/>
information on homeschooling.  Our little ol&#39; district has no Independent <br/>
Study Program unless the kdis are sick and that only lasts for 6 weeks max so <br/>
I have to declare my home as a private school.  I am waiting for the R4 to be <br/>
mailed and that&#39;s where I am now.  My other two kids are doing good in school <br/>
so I will leave them there for this year but my daughter has told me that <br/>
she&#39;d like to be homeschooled next year.  <br/>
  Already I have some people telling me how they&#39;ll miss out on the social <br/>
aspect of school and how tough it will be for me to do this.  I doubt my son <br/>
will miss much socially since he plays sports thru the city programs and goes <br/>
to the recreation center too.  That hardly worries me.  I&#39;m not worried about <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; them because once I sat down to think about lessons I realized <br/>
that there are a lot of lessons just waiting to be taught right here around <br/>
the house.  He&#39;ll have opportunities right here that the school could never <br/>
provide.  So I am optimistic.  I&#39;m going to hang around here for bit, if you <br/>
all don&#39;t mind, and learn from you too.  <br/>
  My dad always hollered after me every morning on my way out to school, <br/>
&quot;Learn things!&quot;  It became a joke and I&#39;d tell him the same thing when he <br/>
went to school for work.  Now it has become a motto of sorts... we never stop <br/>
learning.  I enjoy learning and want my son to enjoy it too, not dread it.  <br/>
  Well that was a little longer than I expected it to be.  :-)   I look <br/>
forward to getting know everyone.<br/>

him, but simply on a different track altogether!  Remember (as I think<br/>
you already know), this &quot;behind/ahead&quot; stuff is artificially created to<br/>
begin with; it has absolutely nothing to do with who your son, and your<br/>
family, really are!<br/>

many of us have had that the school is not -- and doesn&#39;t envision<br/>
itself as -- a helping organization.  And there are so many teachers who<br/>
go into the system thinking they are there to help and just get ground<br/>
up...)<br/>

<br/>
I bet it&#39;s not going to take your kids too long to deschool.  They&#39;re <br/>
young and haven&#39;t been in ps very long.  The figure I hear the most <br/>
often is 1 month for every year in school.  Of course,  even after <br/>
deschooling,  there are always periods where it looks like nothing is <br/>
happening.  In reality,  information that has been learned is usually <br/>
being processed.  My son (now 13) has been out since he was 10 and <br/>
I&#39;d say the 1 month for every year was about right.  I often had to <br/>
reassure him during those times that this would work.  Good luck!<br/>

year it took until March for me to see the very first thing she actually<br/>
did on<br/>
her own because she wanted to.  Now it is September and just in the last<br/>
couple<br/>
of weeks has she actually picked up a book to read for the enjoyment of<br/>
reading!  Hang in there, be patient and do your best to relax.  It takes a<br/>
while, some say 1 year for every year of ps.  I&#39;m counting on that being much<br/>
much less - well I can hope anyway!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61888017">Hi I am happy to be part of such an active list. I am actually an unschooler<br/>
wannabe and a former first grade ps teacher. I actually think I was an<br/>
unschooler as a ps teacher as I always threw away the lesson plans and let<br/>
the kids guide the day based on their interests. I am not worried about<br/>
doing that part of the unschooling with my own children who are now 7 my son<br/>
Kyle and soon to be 8 daughter Melissa. I gave my kids the choice as we live<br/>
in rural America to go to ps school and after carefully observing my<br/>
limited choices I chose a few good teachers and still have had many bad<br/>
days where I write long letters to the principle and superintendent and then<br/>
scrap them after I have written them as I realize I really don&#39;t want to<br/>
change the system (I want to just be a homeschooler and be with my kids). I<br/>
did need the time away from my kids for personal time as their birth<br/>
experiences were so traumatic and their early years were hard for a variety<br/>
of reasons can barely speak about it suffice it to say that they are both<br/>
lucky to be alive and my first  pregnancy was identical twins and my first<br/>
born died at birth, so I decided from that experience that staying home and<br/>
raising my babies was the most important thing I could do and had no desire<br/>
to return to teaching. I live in New Hampshire whose motto&quot;live free or die&quot;<br/>
applies to everyone (it seems)  but homeschoolers although it is much more<br/>
common here.<br/>
parents do have to write a yearly curriculum and have it approved by the<br/>
Superintendent. If anyone else here is from NH please let me know I am<br/>
interested in how you did it. Because these authority figures represent my<br/>
boss and all the narrow minded politicians in the world I am scared to death<br/>
of the homeschooling process as well as taking the kids out of school. I<br/>
know I can do this (I am and was a teacher) but I don&#39;t want to be a slave<br/>
or live in fear that they will give me a hard time taking the kids out of<br/>
school next year. Lately, I have entertained the idea of just lying and<br/>
saying we are moving but it is too small a town. I read some posts of<br/>
someone who wants to move back to City life ( I can relate) and I&#39;ve also<br/>
been the mom who went to the library story times in more than one town. Of<br/>
course I hated some of them but now and then the librarian would take off<br/>
her shoes put on her guitar and we&#39;d all go outside and sing. The other town<br/>
library was so laid back they would also have an art activity and a snack<br/>
time and all the moms hung out. I didn&#39;t go too much just when I needed a<br/>
break from out tiny apt. now we also live in a bigger space and none of the<br/>
neighbors here home school. I realize being a teacher is politically correct<br/>
for doing it (it is just I am so against those curricula I&#39;d have to create<br/>
which I&#39;d be so good at if I didn&#39;t feel so afraid.) I think my biggest fear<br/>
is that my kids will hate being home with me and beg me to send them back to<br/>
school! It hasn&#39;t happened to me over the summer or when they are on<br/>
vacation<br/>
or when they are home sick. Anyway, I know I am rambling but did want to let<br/>
you all know my fears and that I am also happy to be here seeing how you all<br/>
are doing it and enjoying reading your topics and honesty about the<br/>
prejudice you encounter.And what to say on the playground I really got a<br/>
kick out of the one about taking a recess it is so true all kids need a good<br/>
long recess outside at a playground! Even though moving near a city is<br/>
tempting I think the prejudice is even greater there as people near cities<br/>
tend to think their ps district is the best and up here no one blames you!<br/>
I&#39;d sure love to hear from anyone who has taken their kids out of school and<br/>
how hard it was and any thing you&#39;d like to share and if they have more than<br/>
one child how they can afford to have the adventures and stuff that keep<br/>
life from getting too boring. My dream is to take a cross country trip with<br/>
the kids and study nature and different coastal  environments travel the<br/>
entire Atlantic seaboard and end up in the Florida Keys . I think I&#39;d have<br/>
to sell my house first and am not quite ready to do that yet. I was lucky<br/>
enough to go to a High school that did have a program like that. I learned<br/>
to ski and camp (things my parents never did). I know my good educational<br/>
experiences can help my hs experience with my kids and I know I will also<br/>
relax once I have taken the plunge and this getting ready to do it is the<br/>
hardest part of all. I am meeting a hs mom up here whose son is my<br/>
daughter&#39;s age and never been to ps school. I imagine it is easier if you&#39;ve<br/>
never gone but I may be wrong!<br/>

Hi Kristen
<p>You will always hear stories about unschooling not working. I have one
that I know from personal experience, where the 3 kids have turned out
variously illiterate, totally lacking in self esteem, a bully and a thief.
Their mother was into John Holt and unschooling from the time the eldest
was a baby.
<p>But you see it&#39;s all a matter of definition, and IMO she didn&#39;t understand
what unschooling was all about. For example, when her daughter wanted to
attend a gym class instead of just the play-around-with-the-equipment session,
because she wanted to learn how to do things properly, she was told no.
When one wanted to learn to read it was told no. And so on. This woman
thought unschooling was taking your kids to lots of places, having lots
of toys, books, etc - offering an enriched environment - but NEVER teaching
them anything, because teaching is the root of all evil. And to her, responding
to a child asking &#39;what does this word say?&#39;, was teaching, so she wouldn&#39;t
do it. IMO this was neglect, not unschooling.
<p>In my experience, some kids thrive on structure - I have one like that.
I am trying to help him find his own ways of structuring his life. He loves
workbooks - discovered them through another homeschooler and begged for
them for his birthday! He likes to have a schedule printed up of all our
commitments, so he can work out times to do his maths, music practise etc.
My husband taught him to use MS Projects or some such thing so he could
timetable his day! But this isn&#39;t forcing anything on him, it&#39;s enabling
him to live how he likes, within a disorganised family &lt;g&gt; Others thrive
on serendipity, and going with the flow.
<p>On a more subtle level, and this is the level I&#39;m still at :-(&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you don&#39;t believe in unschooling in your gut and in your head and in
your whole being you will run into some problems. The kids will sense that
you don&#39;t totally trust them, that you have things you believe are more
important than what they want to do, that you have expectations.
<p>The more you can trust them, the more successful unschooling will be.
If you can&#39;t trust totally, then I think that the next best thing is to
be honest with your kids about what is happening - at the same time as
striving towards fixing up your own head! That&#39;s where I&#39;m at: I keep trying,
but I&#39;m open with the kids about why I appear contradictory - it&#39;s because
of my past, not because of their present and future.
<p>Unschooling is to do with the environment the kids live in. You can&#39;t
unschool successfully as a method. You need to provide an environment rich
in opportunity, experiences and, most essentially, trust.

&gt;will not work. I have 5 children 8,6,4,2,1. Ever since they were born<br/>
&gt;I have let my heart lead the way. With breastfeeding, sleeping<br/>

&gt;I am so glad to have found this place to share ideas and thoughts<br/>
&gt;with like minded people. I love to watch the freedom of my children<br/>
&gt;in play, not laboring over their workbooks, yet I feel somehow I am<br/>
&gt;being negligent as a parent. Thank You for this place and your kind<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, Rhonda.  Welcome to the list.  <br/>
<br/>
We started homeschooling when my middle son was 11.  We quickly grew into <br/>
unschooling.  He deschooled for a couple of years, but he was never inactive. <br/>
 He played a lot of video and computer games, learned some programming, built <br/>
stuff with Legos and Mindstorms, and enjoyed the internet.  At 14 he learned <br/>
to drive and also took philosophy at the local vo-tech college.  At 15 we <br/>
moved to a location where he could more easily get to work without a car, and <br/>
he began working.  First in fast food restaurants, becoming a shift leader <br/>
and getting lots of hours, and then at 17 he went to work full-time at an <br/>
adult-type job, building electrical panels.  While he was doing that, he got <br/>
a car and a part-time job in a retail clothing store.  <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there he moved in with his dad and went back to public school.  <br/>
Sometimes it is hard to find other homeschooled teenagers who won&#39;t be more <br/>
worried about what church you attend than what kind of person you are.  So, <br/>
he needed some friends and he got a lot of them. I posted on his experiences <br/>
there just yesterday, so I won&#39;t go into it.  But he came home again for the <br/>
same reasons he left the first time.  It&#39;s *school*.  @@<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, he quit his full-time job last August because he realized he was only <br/>
17 and working two jobs and he felt he was wasting his &quot;childhood&quot;.  Since <br/>
then he has pursued his dream of becoming a rock star, and actually is in a <br/>
band that has concerts and a website and recently recorded a demo. ( &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.essex.cjb.net&quot;&gt;<br/>
http://www.essex.cjb.net&lt;/A&gt; That&#39;s him on the opening screen with the pink hair <br/>
and orange shirt.)  He&#39;s 18, now.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is not what I would have envisioned for him when he was 11.  But <br/>
unschooling taught me to see that what I want for him is not important.  I <br/>
shudder to think what things might have been like if he had been further <br/>
repressed in school like he was.  I was taking him to therapy for depression <br/>
when he was SEVEN, for cryin-out-loud.  Directly related to school.  <br/>
<br/>
Your son *will* break out on his own, but it is very likely it won&#39;t look <br/>
like anything you could have imagined.  You will do much better just being in <br/>
the relationship with him, and knowing him and loving him as he changes, and <br/>
he knowing you and loving you as you change.  Relationship is the thing many <br/>
people discount or leave out of unschooling when they describe it.  But to <br/>
me, it&#39;s the one necessary element.<br/>

had even heard of homeschooling, let alone unschooling, so it helped that I<br/>
did some college (starting with a community college) later, in terms of<br/>
getting jobs.  Now most people have heard of homeschooling, so he could<br/>
probably put that on a job application.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have five, now ages 17, 21, 22, 26, and 28; four boys and a girl <br/>
in the middle. None of them has ever been interested in playing the <br/>
college game - as our worldly-wise 22 yo daughter puts it: &quot;Why <br/>
should I strap myself to tens of thousands of dollars in college <br/>
bills when I could be learning pretty much the same kinds of things <br/>
but letting someone else pay *me* for it?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Between them, the kids have done quite a few different kinds of jobs, <br/>
from waitressing at a ski resort to driving a tow truck in Alaska to <br/>
being an industrial electrician to being a foreman in charge of <br/>
constructing commercial steel-frame buildings. They&#39;ve all learned <br/>
their skills on the job, getting paid as they went, and whenever one <br/>
has decided to try something new they&#39;ve been enticed to stay on with <br/>
raises in pay and other perks and promised a job there again if they <br/>
ever want to return. Sometimes they&#39;ve taken a drop in pay to follow <br/>
an interest, like our 26 yo son Jim, who decided he was tired of <br/>
being an electrician for high $$ and wanted to see some more of the <br/>
country... So he took a six-week course in truck driving (while <br/>
working as an electrician) and has been trucking all across the <br/>
western states since last September, driving an 18-wheeler and just <br/>
loving it! He&#39;ll have enough experience by next month to be able to <br/>
take his wife and two little girls with him - I can just hear the <br/>
excitement in their voices when we talk on the phone these days.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s something unschooling does for kids - it allows them <br/>
to look at things a little differently and not be afraid to change <br/>
something that&#39;s not necessarily working for them. It was a serious <br/>
switch for Jim to leave his high-paying electrician&#39;s job, because <br/>
they&#39;d just bought ten acres with a house and barn last summer. But <br/>
he&#39;d always dreamed of driving big rigs, and his wife encouraged him <br/>
to follow his dream, taking a job to help make ends meet until Jim <br/>
got his first trucking checks.<br/>
<br/>
Most of our kids have said they&#39;re just collecting skills, exploring <br/>
avenues, figuring some day they&#39;ll start their own businesses and run <br/>
things their own way. They see jobs as pretty much a means to an end, <br/>
paying the bills while learning things and meeting people, while <br/>
running one&#39;s own business (as they&#39;ve always seen their parents do) <br/>
is the best way to really get ahead. But they&#39;re all aware that <br/>
running one&#39;s own business is a *major* commitment, so none of them <br/>
are ready to take that leap just yet. They&#39;re all still exploring the <br/>
options, checking out the territory, unschooling (unjobbing?) <br/>
themselves. (Is this the list we discussed the unjobbing book on a <br/>
couple of weeks ago, or was that our other unschooling list?)<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, several of the kids our kids grew up with are taking the <br/>
college route, and our kids are appalled at the financial burdens <br/>
they&#39;re starting out with. When they come to visit it&#39;s usually a <br/>
primary topic of conversation: &quot;Well, I&#39;m almost through school and <br/>
now I need to find a good job to start paying off the debt...&quot; One <br/>
girl says she&#39;s planning to just stay in college forever because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t think she could ever pay off the bills if she left. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure how that works - you don&#39;t start paying &#39;til you get out? Some <br/>
of the kids&#39; friends have received scholarships, but as one friend of <br/>
our daughter said recently - if I&#39;d known how little that big <br/>
fancy-sounding scholarship would really cover I&#39;d have run the other <br/>
direction!<br/>
<br/>
And of course yours truly was unschooled, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother <br/>
story, which is probably somewhere in this list&#39;s archives anyway. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

school for a few weeks (senior year). Primarily for the socializing <br/>

we have with our kids, and they all have with each other. They do <br/>
annoy each other from time to time - that&#39;s life - but the current <br/>
flowing under it all is a deep, abiding love for one another.<br/>

Wow. It seems there are now over 50,000 posts to this list, and the <br/>
YahooGroups search function only lets you search a couple thousand of <br/>
them at a time. I clicked back through about 25,000 of the posts with <br/>
a couple of keywords I thought might work, but nothing came up. It&#39;s <br/>
after 3 am here and I need some sleep. Will try another route in the <br/>
morning - or just rewrite something when I can.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t yell on-line.  &lt;g&gt;  But, you can&#39;t really do that, either.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is, well, unschooling.  If you&#39;re using a curriculum for math,<br/>
&gt; Bible and English, you&#39;re using an eclectic form of homeschooling.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; your choice, but you can&#39;t unschool without letting go.  Really, truly,<br/>
&gt; letting go.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi!,<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list also.  I have enjoyed reading your posts and am really<br/>
excited about all of you and your thoughts and unschooling.  I feel like I<br/>
was a great unschooling mom until my daughter turned 4 and I had to put her<br/>
in a &quot;really good&quot; preschool so she could learn &quot;real&quot; stuff!  Then after<br/>
she was mostly changed into a different person than I was and she was prior<br/>
to her &quot;really good&quot; schools, I took her out abruptly 4 weeks into 3rd<br/>
grade.  Now 3 years later of home &quot;schooling&quot;, neither one of us can stand<br/>
it.  The first year we did school at home and the second year, I told her<br/>
mom had to do research and find a different way and I made announcements<br/>
every day to her that she was going to get soooo far behind her friends.<br/>
Now this year we are much more relaxed but still trying to follow a schedule<br/>
and (you will all love this), I tell her she can&#39;t read the books she&#39;s<br/>
dying to get into because we have to read the assigned books first!!<br/>
So now my soul, and I know her soul, is crying out to be different or free<br/>
or something!! So I&#39;m going to keep reading unschooling stuff but I want to<br/>
know what do to with her.  Do I say, &quot;well, now you can the books you always<br/>
wanted to?&quot; &lt;g&gt;  Do I just stop the scope and sequence stuff?  COLD TURKEY?!<br/>
I hope to join in your writings more often now and will be asking you more<br/>
questions!<br/>
Thanks, Lisa  (mom to Megan (10) and Nathan (5, who is unschooled so far<br/>
because I am beginning to see the light!)</div>
