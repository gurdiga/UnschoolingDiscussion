&gt; **********************************************************<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi Amy,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also had doubts in the beginning.If I could do it all over again<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would just be with my son and NOT concentrate on school so much<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; bonding and connecting instead. We get dissconnected from our kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; when they are in school.I think once you get the connection the<br/>
&gt; fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; begins and the journey happens - natrually. Naturally is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; keyword - I was trying to do school things when I first got my son<br/>
&gt; &gt; home out of fear. This is my second year and it&#39;s more relaxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; because we just live and have fun.  I would describe it as a way<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; life.  I still tell the school oh yeah he is reading and doing<br/>
&gt; math<br/>
&gt; &gt; just to shut them up - but in our home and in my heart I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; everything will happen all natrually :) I let my son guide and<br/>
&gt; &gt; direct me I listen to him carefully for what he desires to know<br/>
&gt; &gt; about.  That is what I&#39;m doing for myself now as an adult and what<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; gift it is  to be able to do it as a child with the help of your<br/>
&gt; &gt; parents.  I have let go of all my fears of the video game thing -<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; never wanted to buy one for fear that he would play all day and<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn. Well guess what he plays all day and still learns.  I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; how will he learn how to read and I find that he is asking &quot;what<br/>
&gt; &gt; does this say - and that ??&quot;  The wheels are turning for him<br/>
&gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is something he wants.  He does math in his own way and we play<br/>
&gt; &gt; lots of games.  You have fun and your together but theres great<br/>
&gt; &gt; learning involved in it. That is the beauty of being home you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; time to do what you love and why shouldn&#39;t you.He does what he<br/>
&gt; loves<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I do what I love and then we do what we love to do together :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Theres many lessons to be learned in life - everything is a<br/>
&gt; learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; exsperience.  Everything - moving to a new home and remodeling<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; &gt; is what we did our first year of home school LOL... Your son might<br/>
&gt; &gt; be feeding on your fear ... I don&#39;t know but I think my son use to<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel mine.  Now I see he is more relaxed now that I am.  He also<br/>
&gt; &gt; sees me explain my philosopy to other people. I also tell him not<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; worry about others and what they think because you have to do<br/>
&gt; whats<br/>
&gt; &gt; right for yourself. They do not live our life and we don&#39;t owe<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; ANY explanations.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your doing the right thing Amy. Love, Live and learn and be happy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Connect and know that everything works out - natrually :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; If there&#39;s a discrepancy between documents about Jesus&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; life, and one of the documents is older...the older document is<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; trusted over the newer one. That&#39;s how it is with all ancient<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; writings.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s not how historiography works in general.  A newer biography<br/>
&gt; is often<br/>
&gt; &gt; trusted over an older one, and history is written for specific<br/>
&gt; purposes and<br/>
&gt; &gt; different purposes by different historians, so you get different<br/>
&gt; slants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you wanted to find out about Grant&#39;s life, would you rather read a<br/>
&gt; biography written today by a historian who researched Grant&#39;s life,<br/>
&gt; or would you read Grant&#39;s memoirs?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BUT! what if something came to light that claimed to be a portion of<br/>
&gt; Grant&#39;s memoirs that had never been seen before, but mentions things<br/>
&gt; that dispute all other primary sources? Would the historian trust the<br/>
&gt; newer stuff that goes against all other sources, including the<br/>
&gt; memoirs from the pen of the man, or would he let the newer stuff go<br/>
&gt; as not reliable?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What if Grant never wrote anything? Maybe someone close to him, who<br/>
&gt; saw what happened, would be a reliable primary source? If a newer<br/>
&gt; biography on Grant were published, and the historian cited sources<br/>
&gt; that have been deemed unreliable by authoritative Grant scholars?<br/>
&gt; What if the new biography mentions many events that are nowhere else<br/>
&gt; mentioned? Do you believe the new biography if it doesn&#39;t check out<br/>
&gt; with sources closer to the actual man?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IMO, the older documents (closer to the source) are going to be<br/>
&gt; closer to the true events, and thus more trustworthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I would say that the main discrepancy about what books are in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; canon is between having the apocrypha or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s a modern view.  A historical view needs to see things all<br/>
&gt; along the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way.  There are many Bible-worshipping protestants (Baptist and<br/>
&gt; thereabout) who<br/>
&gt; &gt; have no idea there are other books in the Catholic Bible, or how<br/>
&gt; they got in,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or why they got out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your point? I&#39;m confident that I don&#39;t fall in the category of &quot;have<br/>
&gt; no idea&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Any objective scholar will acknowledge that Biblical<br/>
&gt; documentation is<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; among the best, if not THE best, in existence.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A scholar who raises a question will show he&#39;s not objective?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; absolutely not. There&#39;s nothing wrong with raising questions AT ALL.<br/>
&gt; Objectivity would be searching all sources, both higher criticism<br/>
&gt; (which group disbelieves in supernatural or miraculous)and the<br/>
&gt; scholars who do allow for the supernatural or miraculous. (don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; if that group has a name or label for their methods.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a researcher wants answers to his questions, best ask everyone he<br/>
&gt; can find who might know anything about the subject, basing his<br/>
&gt; research criteria on quality of scholarship NOT on doubting OR<br/>
&gt; believing that the Bible is reliable. Even scholars who are inclined<br/>
&gt; to the higher criticism camp, acknowledge the extremely high level of<br/>
&gt; quality of Biblical documentation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Okay, but my point was to try and refute the notion which is<br/>
&gt; widely<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; taught, that &quot;all holidays celebrated originally by the Catholic<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; church have their origins in pagan traditions.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What I think people mean when they say that is that the holidays<br/>
&gt; celebrated<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the United States have pagan origins concerning the traditions<br/>
&gt; with which<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are celebrated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You mean, &quot;The things we do traditionally TO celebrate these<br/>
&gt; holidays.&quot; Right? Like lighting the Yule log or whatever...???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, I think I get that now. :&#92; I think. But there still is a panic<br/>
&gt; in evangelicaldom about following practices that originate in pagan<br/>
&gt; tradition. They don&#39;t want to do things that are not commanded nor<br/>
&gt; recommended in the Bible, but it is a misguided attempt at Christian<br/>
&gt; living, IMO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the only generally &quot;celebrated religious holidays&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; here outside Thanksgiving and 4th of July are Christmas and<br/>
&gt; Easter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, T&#39;giving is a religious feast day, in that giving thanks to God<br/>
&gt; was part of the intent of The First Thanksgiving, but it is also<br/>
&gt; American, not Catholic, in origin. Goes to show, the puritans weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; against feasting and celebrating, per se. Just didn&#39;t like the<br/>
&gt; Catholic versions of things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; and of course 4th of July is a United States thing, not universal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Valentine&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; Day was a medieval Saint&#39;s Day (most days were, and still are in<br/>
&gt; the Catholic<br/>
&gt; &gt; church and for purposes of baby-naming and the particulars of the<br/>
&gt; daily<br/>
&gt; &gt; mass), and Hallowe&#39;en, but the traditions don&#39;t have to do with<br/>
&gt; church or Jesus,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I disagree. If a day is named after a saint...well, isn&#39;t a saint a<br/>
&gt; part of the Church? Aren&#39;t &quot;All Saints&quot; a part of the church? Then,<br/>
&gt; Valentine&#39;s and Hallowe&#39;en have to do with the church. And the church<br/>
&gt; has to do with Jesus...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; blessings, HeidiC<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Looking at all the history of religion through a 2003 American<br/>
&gt; Protestant<br/>
&gt; &gt; lens is too distorting.  It&#39;s not at all objective.<br/>

&gt; has been (regarding schooling OR the candy bowl). It is far more<br/>
&gt; important what you do than that you don&#39;t set limits. The point is you<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t NEED to set limits if you do other things instead. In a way,<br/>
&gt; setting limits could be just thought of as laziness and inattentiveness<br/>
&gt; on the part of the parents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So - for Heidi and the other experimenters - you need to remember that<br/>
&gt; there is a whole lot more to it.<br/>
&gt; You have to be willing to make food for the kids to eat - food that<br/>
&gt; they like - food that appeals to them - food that is available and<br/>
&gt; ready when they feel the urge to eat. You have to keep your eyes on<br/>
&gt; their behavior and their attitude - and learn to recognize when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; getting a little low - that their blood sugar might be dropping. You<br/>
&gt; have to learn to go in and slice up an apple and sprinkle it with some<br/>
&gt; cinnamon and put it and some cheese chunks on a plate and just slide it<br/>
&gt; over in front of them when they are involved in an activity. You have<br/>
&gt; to learn to make some little finger sandwiches and have them ready in<br/>
&gt; baggies so the kids can grab them out of the refrigerator. You have to<br/>
&gt; have cereal to use as a quick munchie. Etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If candy and cookies and things like that are sitting around and<br/>
&gt; available, that&#39;s the first thing people will grab if they&#39;re a little<br/>
&gt; hungry and need a snack or if they sense their blood sugar dropping.<br/>
&gt; You have to have appealing-to-kids and quick-to-grab food be as easy to<br/>
&gt; get to as the candy bowl.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As kids get older, they will go in and fix their own real food - they<br/>
&gt; will be used to having something more substantial than a pile of candy<br/>
&gt; when they are hungry and that won&#39;t be so appealing.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;        Maybe several of us could use some encouraging perspective from<br/>
&gt; unschooling moms whose sons USED to be like this and aren&#39;t anymore!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kirby and Marty used to be like that and aren&#39;t anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They take a shower every day because they want to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There were times when I would just go in and open the windows in Kirby&#39;s<br/>
room<br/>
&gt; and aim a fan out to vent the boy-smell, but I didn&#39;t do it hatefully,<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; gently.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I&#39;d ask one of them to change his shirt if we were going<br/>
somewhere,<br/>
&gt; and he would.  Sometimes I&#39;d say &quot;If you&#39;re going with [whoever], maybe<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; should plan enough time to take a shower.&quot;   I didn&#39;t say &quot;If you don&#39;t<br/>
take a<br/>
&gt; shower you can&#39;t go.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The time came when they started smelling their friends.  And there were<br/>
jokes<br/>
&gt; about the smell of the gaming shop (MANY teen boys, no windows), and at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; anime convention where Kirby goes, he spoke on a panel this year about how<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; have the best experience at a con, and one of their points was take a<br/>
shower.<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe it&#39;s partly a boy thing, and partly a dweebish thing.  In my<br/>
(limited,<br/>
&gt; as to boys) experience, jockish boys are more likely to take showers than<br/>
&gt; sedentary kinds of boys, but for while early in puberty they all seem to<br/>
need them<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing worth thinking about is that it might be one of the triggers<br/>
&gt; for separation of mothers and sons.  We have a lot of other teenaged boys<br/>
here,<br/>
&gt; and though sometimes I&#39;ve smelled the scent of one, they never stank, but<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; own boys did (to me).   I&#39;ve talked to other moms about that too, and<br/>
they&#39;d<br/>
&gt; not had any complaints about my boys, but thought their own boys needed a<br/>
shower<br/>
&gt; QUICKLY.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Putting that one bite of broccoli on their plate and telling them to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have memories of gagging on string beans once, when my dad insisted<br/>

&gt; - they were fresh (that was in the mid-50s and we mostly ate canned<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A gentle urge to encourage them to try something is one thing, but<br/>
&gt; putting something on their plate and insisting they put it INTO their<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Nearly two years after TV limits removed<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just another comment or two on the limiting topic...I just never had any<br/>
&gt; limits on much of anything and so my children never learned to think that<br/>
&gt; something was better than something else.  Like cake vs. carrots at dinner<br/>
&gt; or games vs. TV for recreation.  I never limited anything to make<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; else look better. &quot;If you don&#39;t eat those carrots, you can&#39;t have the<br/>
cake.&quot;<br/>
&gt; In fact, when they were very small and noticed that I was making something<br/>
&gt; yummy and got excited, I&#39;d put it right on their plate with the meat and<br/>
&gt; potatoes.  Sometimes they would eat the cake first and then the meat.  I<br/>
&gt; wanted them to see/understand that sometimes you want to eat cake and<br/>
&gt; sometimes you want the steak.  Sometimes you want to read a book and<br/>
&gt; sometimes you want to watch TV.  Sometimes you want to ride your bike and<br/>
&gt; sometimes you want to stay in and color.  Neither choice is neccessarily<br/>
&gt; &quot;bad&quot; and your particular behavior doesn&#39;t make one thing better than<br/>
&gt; another.  My husband has stories of falling asleep at the table because he<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t finish his dinner and couldn&#39;t get down until he had done so.  His<br/>
&gt; mom tries to withhold dessert from our kids if they don&#39;t &quot;clean their<br/>
&gt; plate.&quot;  I always override and &quot;spoil&quot; the kids! Geesh!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This is a child who can watch TV whenever she wishes.  When the<br/>

&gt; than watching TV.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t mean to suggest that playing a game is always better than<br/>
&gt; watching TV.  I just wanted to put this out for those who are new to the<br/>
&gt; idea of not limiting TV.  It is one more example of a kid who does not<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; TV limits and does choose to do other things besides watch TV.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Right. We always have had a fruit bowl out and available, and the<br/>
&gt; fruit disappears pretty quick, too. I have all kinds of foods<br/>
&gt; available all the time, just making the candy available in addition<br/>
&gt; to what has pretty much been here all along. I could be more on top<br/>
&gt; of keeping carrot and celery sticks cut and ready to eat, but the<br/>
&gt; kids have never been bashful about grabbing a carrot and peeling it<br/>
&gt; to munch, and I imagine they&#39;ll be doing as much of that as they<br/>
&gt; always have.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, our first 36 hours of Bottomless Candy Bowl. Because it was all<br/>
&gt; chocolate, I&#39;ve already had requests for more variety...check...and<br/>
&gt; have refilled it three or four times, and people are grabbing a piece<br/>
&gt; or two as they pass by. I&#39;ve also requested that wrappers don&#39;t get<br/>
&gt; left on surfaces or on the floor. It isn&#39;t all gone; people aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; just sitting with a pocketful and eating it as fast as they can shove<br/>
&gt; it in their mouths. They&#39;re having a piece here and there throughout<br/>
&gt; the day, much as they do with pieces of fruit, cheese, muffins, and<br/>
&gt; other snack stuff.<br/>

&gt; **He hustled through the hoops as fast as he could, and got that work<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; He learned that the freedom he has at your house is so worthwhile that<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s willing to put a lot of effort to get the payoff of having more<br/>
&gt; time at your house.  ;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, okay he was doing his assigned work in a slapdash fashion.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think doing it very carefully and ponderously would have been a great<br/>
&gt; thing either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If more kids had the opportunity to speed up their &quot;school day&quot; and have<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi, JJ<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m basically in the same boat with you with my 9 year old.  I think<br/>
&gt; that perhaps one&#39;s nose becomes quickly accustomed to one&#39;s own odors,<br/>
&gt; so that a stink that others can smell is just unnoticeable to the boy<br/>
&gt; exuding it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to just be lighthearted and teasing about it, but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want my son to have to hear from other kids that he smells bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will work on trying to keep the tub nicer.  (I bathe without my<br/>
&gt; glasses, so I notice a lot less than everyone else, regrettably.)<br/>

&gt; **You have to be willing to make food for the kids to eat - food that<br/>
&gt; they like - food that appeals to them - food that is available and<br/>
&gt; ready when they feel the urge to eat. You have to keep your eyes on<br/>
&gt; their behavior and their attitude - and learn to recognize when they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; getting a little low - that their blood sugar might be dropping. You<br/>
&gt; have to learn to go in and slice up an apple and sprinkle it with some<br/>
&gt; cinnamon and put it and some cheese chunks on a plate and just slide it<br/>
&gt; over in front of them when they are involved in an activity. You have<br/>
&gt; to learn to make some little finger sandwiches and have them ready in<br/>
&gt; baggies so the kids can grab them out of the refrigerator. You have to<br/>
&gt; have cereal to use as a quick munchie. Etc.**<br/>

&gt; Hi, Pam -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for taking the time to spell this out.  It really does help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve had beaucoup candy around this week, but not much yummy mealtime<br/>
&gt; food prepared by me.  I&#39;ve got to fix this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son had a small meltdown about food yesterday (after I beat him at a<br/>
&gt; board game, which may have been part of the issue), so today at the<br/>
&gt; store I concentrated more on what he wanted and less on what I approved<br/>
&gt; of.  (I usually do buy him what he wants, but on a budget and with some<br/>
&gt; effort to avoid transfats.)  Today he said &quot;I had fun at the grocery<br/>
&gt; store.&quot;  (Imagine my surprise, chagrin, and resolution to make it more<br/>
&gt; fun more often.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got lucky and his favorite cereal, which is normally $5 per box, was<br/>
&gt; on sale for $2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; It&#39;s kind of discouraging to hear that the problem only developed<br/>
&gt; &gt; with puberty for many of your sons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember that my younger brother had the aversion to showers.  Then,<br/>
after<br/>
&gt; a few years of that, he did a 180 and you could never get the kid *out* of<br/>
&gt; the shower.  Many years later, after I married, I watched my husband&#39;s<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; younger brother go through the same cycle.  Seems to be starting a bit<br/>
&gt; earlier with my son, but he&#39;s not so stinky just yet.  It&#39;s just something<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; expect and will get through.<br/>

&gt; Yeah,  Alec too,  he goes through phases.  Like when we were in Mexico he<br/>
had to buy a necklace to wear and some types of pants he really likes.  But<br/>
I guess I am glad that he&#39;s not too worried about his appearance right now.<br/>
Like what others will think and all that.  He is definately his own person.<br/>

&gt;   Wow,  this is interesting.  Maybe that&#39;s why Alec is sleeping in our<br/>
room at night.  He just does not want to sleep by himself anymore.  His<br/>
sister, who is 9,  just decided she wanted her own room and here we have her<br/>
older bro who wants to sleep with Mom and Dad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m OK with it, I know it won&#39;t last.  Its created a closeness between<br/>

2<br/>

&gt; Have you tried taking a radio or tape player into the bathroom for him, so<br/>
&gt; he can listen to music while he bathes?  Or maybe pulling the shower<br/>
curtain<br/>
&gt; closed, but leaving the bathroom door open so he can chat with you while<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; are going about you business?<br/>

&gt; three pregnancies. I had been on a low fat diet from my early teens<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; of my father&#39;s health concerns. I thought too much protein was bad. I now<br/>
&gt; try to eat a gram of protein for every kilo of body weight - a kilo is<br/>
&gt; about 2.2 lbs. If I eat less I find I crave sugar and other simple carbs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My sons knew this from their early days. A couple of days after halloween,<br/>

some<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, technically contraception has already been banned by the Catholic<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, the Catholic Church has never ever ever accepted contraception,<br/>
&gt; even when it was really lousy (still is...all those nasty hormones and<br/>
&gt; things!).  None of the other Christian religions accepted it, either,<br/>
until<br/>
&gt; the 1930s.  Martin Luther and John Calvin and some other big name<br/>
