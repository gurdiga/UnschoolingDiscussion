<div id="ygrps-yiv-515836238">California must be a great state to unschool in.  Unschooling in PA is like <br/>
being at war with the Klingons (anyone who has ever watched a Star Trek show, <br/>

the millenium, for goodness sake.  It&#39;s time we had total and complete <br/>

anything but sit on the sofa and watch TV -- of course, I didn&#39;t allow this <br/>

challenge.  And since we started with only 3 months left in the year, I felt <br/>
we were under a microscope.  However, I DID get her to read.  My daughter <br/>
eats books for breakfast -- if they are novels (grin).  I manage to get in a <br/>
few fictional history books, though.  We will see.  I will see if she likes <br/>
this cyber charter thing first, and if she doesn&#39;t, we&#39;ll quit, and totally <br/>
unschool -- and fight.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing is if they challenge me, she&#39;ll have to go to regular public school <br/>
until I win, which could take a while, and I don&#39;t want her in the local <br/>
district at all.  So, I guess I&#39;d have to find a way to get her out of the <br/>
state! Ironically, I live 20 minutes from New Jersey -- one of the easiest <br/>
states to homeschool in!!! (Murphy&#39;s Law).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596296611">I have a 13 year old daughter so I understand your challenges motivating a<br/>
teenager.  It took a LONG time to overcome (or undue) what a life in the PS<br/>
did to her.  She was a typical girl, I think, but she HATED school.  From as<br/>
early as kindergarten, she&#39;d go out the door kicking and screaming.  Every<br/>
day for her was an ordeal.  She always did well in school, once she got<br/>
there, but her last year was a series of stomach aches, migraines, colds,<br/>
flus, sore throats, and anything else she could manifest to get out of<br/>
going.<br/>
<br/>
I too fell into the trap of replicating school at home when we first<br/>
started.  (I took my son out of school several months later too).  I did<br/>
this for about 6 weeks and saw that I was no better a force-feed teacher<br/>
than her public school teachers (surprise, surprise).  So I left them alone.<br/>
After several months, my daughter started watching the news.  Now the news<br/>
is on her TV all the time as she chats with her world-wide pen pals.  She&#39;s<br/>
also taken up instruments, writes stories, and is a fierce debater on any<br/>
topic thrown at her.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned in my introduction, I enrolled them in the Chicago Sudbury<br/>
School at the end of last year.  They&#39;ll be starting there again in late<br/>
August.  The best thing about Sudbury, for my kids, is it gives them other<br/>
kids to associate with (all mixed ages).  My daughter has begun watching<br/>
other news type programs so she&#39;ll be able to participate in the debates she<br/>
has with her schoolmates.  Sudbury doesn&#39;t have grades, classes, regular<br/>
school hours or even a curriculum, but somehow they manage to conform to the<br/>
private school legal requirements.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are very mixed feelings about HSLDA, but I joined.  As an<br/>
Atheist, I found it difficult, but I believed that their heart and motives<br/>
were in the right place.  I also saw that no other lobbying group had sprung<br/>
up to help home schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I lived in NJ and now live in Illinois.  The two best States to live in to<br/>
home school.  We considered living in another area once because of the job<br/>
opportunity but looked at their home school laws and decided against it.<br/>
<br/>
Why not get a NJ address?  Then you&#39;ll be out of the radar of the public<br/>
schools and will be more able to do what you know to be right for your<br/>
daughter.  The other option is to band together with other PA home and<br/>
unschoolers in your area and get a P.O. box type address for your private,<br/>
school without walls.  Appoint one parent as principal, another as teacher,<br/>
another as school secretary, etc.  Have a monthly or quarterly meeting<br/>
(local park sounds like a good place)--take minutes, fill out report cards,<br/>
etc.  If any of your group (or you) are religious, link up with your local<br/>
church and run your private home schools through them.  Separation of church<br/>
and state laws will stop the meddling immediately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738665689">I think the problem may be that you are trying to show too much information <br/>
to the school district. What the law says is that you have to show a <br/>
representation of your work, not the entire year. And as far as the log, the <br/>
same thing goes. Show them a sample of it. And keep a list of books or <br/>
reading material read, whatever that may be. There are also some pretty <br/>
friendly unschooling evulators out there, but I am not sure if you are <br/>
unschooling or not?? There are choices to make. . . you don&#39;t have to be a <br/>
part of the system if you choose not to, but I know many people are able to <br/>
live comfortably within the realms of the current law while unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A very helpful collection of information is at<br/>
http://expage.com/page/folchslda (More Information on HSLDA). It should help<br/>
clarify what HSLDA&#39;s true intent is.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, it&#39;s unlikely that they will represent unschoolers even if you do pay<br/>
your dues. (Or for that matter anyone if your case doesn&#39;t suit their needs.<br/>
You are *not* buying legal insurance.) I believe it states so in their<br/>
application.)<br/>
<br/>
Though they aren&#39;t a lobbying group, National Home Education Network (NHEN)<br/>
(http://www.nhen.org) is a national group. Personally I think our inclusive<br/>
state groups are our best sources for watching and alerting us about<br/>
important state legislation that could effect us as homeschoolers. I don&#39;t<br/>
want an outside partisan group coming in and telling the state what is best<br/>
for us.<br/>
