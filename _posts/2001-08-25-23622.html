<div id="ygrps-yiv-330216343">Thanks for all the great ideas on art supplies and thoughts on art.<br/>
I am really needing feedback on &quot;unschooling art&quot;.  (I know we are not<br/>
supposed to think in subjects - sorry!)  OK, I&#39;m trying to put my<br/>
thoughts into type here:<br/>
In school, I learned that &quot;I wasn&#39;t good at art&quot;.   I have read Drawing<br/>
with Children and Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, but the bottom<br/>
line is that I seldom sit down to draw or paint myself.  So now I have a<br/>
child who has gone through reams of paper, covering it with letters,<br/>
scribbles, pictures, etc.  She clearly enjoys doing this.  Also, she is<br/>
very good and has really made some great pictures.  I have considered art<br/>
lessons because I think she might enjoy seeing different techniques<br/>
demonstrated.  However, I think it would be hard to find someone willing<br/>
to work with a 6 year old without believing that the 6 year old needs to<br/>
be taught.  In other words, I don&#39;t want her to attend &quot;art school&quot;,<br/>
especially considering that she hasn&#39;t asked for it!  The lessons that I<br/>
have noticed locally all seem rather schoolish.<br/>
We do read books about art and artists and go to museums.  I do supply<br/>
lots of paper.  We have pastel chalk, colored pencils, felt markers, and<br/>
some paint.  Should I just leave it at that?  Will she really let me know<br/>
if she wants more?  How will she know what is out there to ask for?  Do<br/>
kids always make it clear what they are asking for?  Am I just projecting<br/>
my desire to be better at drawing onto my child?  She really shows an<br/>
interest in drawing that my other child doesn&#39;t.<br/>
Guess I am just looking for reassurance here.  Unschooling makes sense to<br/>
me, but I still need some ideas on the details!  My local support for<br/>
unschooling is dwindling, as their kids get older and they begin to<br/>
decide to unschool &quot;everything but math&quot;, or that their kids are really<br/>
&quot;better behaved when the parent insists on a certain amount of schoolwork<br/>
each day&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She may want to do more formal art lessons at some point, but I think<br/>
there are plenty of other ways to learn. My daughter found some books on<br/>
how to draw cartoons when she was 7 and spent a few weeks learning those<br/>
techniques and drawing some amazing stuff. The same year, she took a<br/>
great clay class where the instructor really worked at facilitating, not<br/>
controlling - the kids made what they wanted, there were procedures for<br/>
using tools and glazes (for safety and neatness) but they were basically<br/>
free to explore, and she would sometimes stop by and offer tips on things<br/>
they could do so the piece wouldn&#39;t crack in the kiln, or to help it<br/>
stand up better. Very cool. The kids were around 5-10 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we&#39;ve done is just sit and sketch together. Sometimes<br/>
watching someobne else and seeing what techniques they use is helpful.<br/>
I&#39;m amazed at some of the things I&#39;ve drawn, just by looking at the lines<br/>
and shapes that I see. <br/>

Ya know, what I to is expose expose expose my children, however I do not <br/>
force the exposure. From there I leave it up to them to pursue what their <br/>
interested in. I&#39;ve recently been looking into the various areas of the arts <br/>
including instrumental, theatrical, vocal, dance, etc etc. I will present the <br/>
information on classes and &quot;schools&quot;, etc, that are available to my children <br/>
and let them decide of they want to pursue any of those areas. I know some <br/>
unschoolers feel that the child doesn&#39;t need to be exposed, that they will <br/>
let you know when they are intersted, but I still feel that unless they are <br/>
exposed to it, they won&#39;t know it&#39;s out there. However, I will never force my <br/>
child to come with me to view an art gallery, museum, theatrical school, or <br/>
anything. For the most part they don&#39;t object to being exposed. They often <br/>
find things quite interesting, even if they have no interest in pursuing the <br/>
subject.<br/>

I&#39;ve never heard that argument.<br/>
Not from unschoolers.  I think it&#39;s a false characterization.<br/>
<br/>
The not forcing I&#39;ve heard lots of families say, but the failure to make the <br/>
offer in the first place is foreign to my experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857096130">I&#39;ve gotten this from several unschoolers at one of my local homeschool <br/>
groups. I spoke to them about bringing my children with me when I volunteer <br/>
at our local elderly home and how I was hoping to expose my children to <br/>
people of different generations as we dont&#39; have elderly family members in <br/>
our lives. I was told that if my children needed the elderly contact they <br/>
would let me know. They way I saw it my children wouldn&#39;t feel the want for <br/>
contact with elderly people if they haven&#39;t been around them. There are other <br/>
examples, but that is the one that stood out in my mind of unschoolers <br/>
feeling children will let parents know when they need something and that the <br/>
children don&#39;t need exposure.<br/>
