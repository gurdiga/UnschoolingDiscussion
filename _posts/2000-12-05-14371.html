<div id="ygrps-yiv-641727684">okay y&#39;all. so i had this idea.<br/>
tonight i was thinking about how sad it is that the awesome zine Dropout is <br/>
defunct (i just found that out last night), and i was thinking about how it <br/>
would be cool to pick it up again, but then i realized how that isn&#39;t very <br/>
feasable since i don&#39;t know how to contact anyone about it. SO i was <br/>
thinking that instead, it would be really awesome to create an alternative. <br/>
a punk-esque zine about being unschooled youth, being in school, dropping <br/>
out, activities and resources, et cetera. not -only- for unschoolers, but <br/>
for unschoolers, those wanting to drop out, those who /cant/ drop out, but <br/>
have experiences they want to get out of their system, etc. So. i need <br/>
help. i need submissions out the ying yang (well-thought-out articles and <br/>
poems and photographs and essays are preferable but send whatever inspires <br/>
you!), quotes and clips from literature, etc., by teens and young adults.<br/>
ALSO, if anyone&#39;s interested in helping emoi with this project, /do/ let me <br/>
know, eh?<br/>
email me personally please.<br/>
