 </span></blockquote> Hi Lynda,   There is a good article you might find useful at:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/pruning/other.html">http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/pruning/other.html</a>        It is all <br/>
about pruning fruit trees, and there is a section on an espalier system.  <br/>
I&#39;ve never espaliered trees before, but it looks very interesting.  I hope <br/>
you find this article useful!                   Karen</div>
