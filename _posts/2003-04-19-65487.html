<div id="ygrps-yiv-515505047">&lt;&lt; Yahoogroups is the largest email list provider (pay or free) and they send<br/>
out literally tons of mail. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;literally tons&quot;? &quot;Tons&quot; is a weight, not a volume. &quot;Literally&quot; should not be <br/>
there if the &quot;tons&quot; is referring to volume (which it is)!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes, this (not getting all/any/some/most list emails) has been an <br/>
ongoing problem for me with two other lists I&#39;m on for the past month. If you <br/>
(whoever&#39;s reading this) wants to make sure not to miss anything, then just <br/>
go to Yahoo Groups, and read the posts there (that are all kept permanently <br/>
in archives, even if the posts got bounced from reaching your particular <br/>
box).    HTH, Lara............</div>
