<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644807507">I would definitely call the owner of the house and ask him to look into it. <br/>
One of my daughters friends have just recently moved back into their house <br/>
after a year because of mold. They were all getting sick and suspected <br/>
something as they had roof problems also. They called their insurance <br/>
company and they took care of it from there. The whole inside of the house <br/>
had to be gutted and redone. It was all covered but they were out of the <br/>
house and in an apt. for a year. Definitely something to get taken care of <br/>
though.<br/>
