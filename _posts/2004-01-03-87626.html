<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770592126">Some of my current interest that I&#39;m trying out or learning more about are:  <br/>
scrapbooking, using a little of the French I picked up living in N. Africa in <br/>
high school, homeschooling, civil war historical fiction, classical novels, <br/>
the piano, using the computer and digital camera,cooking healthy meals and using <br/>
more fruits and veggies.<br/>
My son likes to scrapbook with me and thinks it&#39;s funny when I read <br/>
children&#39;s books to him in French...maybe he&#39;ll want to learn someday.<br/>
Happy learning!  Good luck with all those languages!<br/>
