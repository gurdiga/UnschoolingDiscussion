<div id="ygrps-yiv-687634288">Hi.  I&#39;m Lynn, mother of ds16, dd12, dd10, and dd7.  Dh is a <br/>
historian/college prof.  I love reading, writing, playing the piano, <br/>
knitting socks, and sometimes gardening.  We moved to Oregon from <br/>
Iowa a year and a half ago.  I miss old friends who I could really <br/>
laugh with. Here I seem to meet people who are really busy or really <br/>
serious.<br/>
My new year sruggles: <br/>
Many years ago, I homeschooled ds for two years, and felt like I was <br/>
not &quot;homeschool mother material,&quot; since I had a terrible time making <br/>
myself say &quot;No, you have to do your math,&quot; when he wanted to play <br/>
outside instead.  So, we went the school route for the next 5 years.  <br/>
Every September, I felt soooo blue.  The last spring my kids were in <br/>
school, I was becoming so frustrated about the amount of school-<br/>
induced stress in their lives, and I took to the internet to read <br/>
again about homeschooling.  For the first time, I read about <br/>
unschooling.  It was such a relief.  I can do that!<br/>
BUT--after two years of unschooling, I felt I wasn&#39;t so good at that <br/>
either!  Ds felt he was wasting too much time and that he needed to <br/>
be told what to do.  Dd10 was afraid she wasn&#39;t learning as much as <br/>
her schooled peers.  (Dd12 loved it and learned tons.)  But in light <br/>
of the others, DH encouraged me to try more of a mixed approach: some <br/>
subjects with books and assignments, the rest self-directed. So this <br/>
past fall, that&#39;s what we did.  But as the new year begins, I find <br/>
myself so reluctant to get out those books again.  It&#39;s not like they <br/>
will be met with any enthusiasm!  You know, with my dd10, I feel like <br/>
she&#39;s saying, &quot;I&#39;m hungry, but I don&#39;t want to fix myself anything to <br/>
eat, but I don&#39;t like what you serve either.&quot;  Arg!  I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
a boring cook!  I want to serve up some gourmet fare, but I&#39;m low on <br/>
ideas.  Well, really, I must admit, I don&#39;t want to have to come up <br/>
with the ideas!<br/>
After writing this out, I think I will just leave those books on the <br/>
shelf, and try to serve a few &quot;hors&#39;d&#39;oevres.&quot;<br/>

I let your post through but I did want to ask that you read a couple of weeks <br/>
before posting, since this is a huge (really huge, almost 1400 people) list.  <br/>
But that said, I sympathize with your problem and I enjoyed your intro, and <br/>
I&#39;d like to recommend this collection:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>
<br/>
Also, the message boards at www.unschooling.com are pretty easy to go to for <br/>
reading already-deposited blocks of ideas.<br/>

<br/>
One of the best idea-sources I&#39;ve ever seen is a book called Trust the <br/>
Children by Anna Kealoha.  All kinds of ideas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We went through this so maybe it&#39;s just a stage. My son Pete (16) used to <br/>
tell me he wasn&#39;t learning anything that I was the teacher and I needed to assign <br/>
something. So we would talk about it and I would assign something and he <br/>
would come back later and tell me how boring that was and that he didn&#39;t want to <br/>
do it. I explained that it was his idea to begin with so to do what he wanted <br/>
but I can&#39;t do it both ways.   This went on for a time, both boys went through <br/>
periods where they also compared themselves to friends and neighbors in school <br/>
and worried we were not doing the same things. We lived through it, as time <br/>
went on their thinking changed as much as mine. Eventually they were telling me <br/>
about unschooling which cracked me up, I don&#39;t remember ever telling them <br/>
about unschooling that I know of. We are not the people we were 5 years ago but <br/>
it took some pain to get here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125349298">Hi Lynn,<br/>
<br/>
Your post caught my eye because I am in Oregon too! I also love <br/>
reading, writing, playing the piano, gardening, AND I want to learn <br/>
to knit. ;) <br/>
<br/>
I relate so much to this: &quot;I&#39;m hungry, but I don&#39;t want to fix <br/>
myself anything to eat, but I don&#39;t like what you serve either.&quot; I&#39;m <br/>
37 years old and am still in the process of deschooling myself. I <br/>
imagine that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with your kids. Their intuition of <br/>
what they need and the motivation that comes from their own desire <br/>
and interest is in there somewhere, it&#39;s just that they are still <br/>
burdened by the anti-life messages and habits school gave them. I <br/>
can testify that it&#39;s a lot easier said than done to fully live <br/>
according to an unschooling philosophy when you&#39;ve spent most of <br/>
your life filled to the brim with the school mentality. You slip <br/>
back into the old bad habits even when you&#39;re not aware of it, which <br/>
is demoralizing. More time wasted! And yet... you *still* don&#39;t <br/>
want &quot;to fix yourself anything to eat&quot;. It&#39;s awful to be in that <br/>
headspace!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say to just keep encouraging them to not rely on others (even <br/>
you) to create their lives for them, and to support them in <br/>
discarding any negative elements in their approach to life, but NOT <br/>
to keep them busy. That&#39;s one thing you&#39;re not obligated to do for <br/>
*any* human being (nor would it be good for them.) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Linda: if we live close enough, I&#39;ll teach you how to knit. E-mail me <br/>
off-list if you like.  I noticed in your intro that you are also into <br/>
birth issues.  I share that interest with you as well.  My girls were <br/>
all born at home, one in the Netherlands, where home birth is a more <br/>
common and more &quot;managed by the experts&quot; than here.  But for that <br/>
one, the midwife was late.  It was my favorite birth.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I think thought habits are harder to break than physical ones.  <br/>
I think DH and I end up undermining our children&#39;s confidence with <br/>
what remains of our school mentality, and when I notice us doing <br/>
that, yes, it is demoralizing!  Not only is time wasted, but damage <br/>
is done.  And repairs must be made.  It would have been easier to <br/>
have just kept my mouth shut in the first place.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things I have done in that regard recently: <br/>
1. Let dc know that they can skip around in math books; they don&#39;t <br/>
have to be done cover to cover.  They already skipped around at will <br/>
in other books, but not math.  <br/>
2. Realized that I had an odd concept of &quot;appropriate times.&quot;  I grew <br/>
up with movies and games reserved for evenings, and just realized <br/>
that I still was thinking that that&#39;s when those things should be <br/>
done.  Silly.  What are we waiting for?  <br/>
<br/>

Thanks for your note, Linda.<br/>
