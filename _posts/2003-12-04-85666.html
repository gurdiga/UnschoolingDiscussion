ANYWAY..I know that I&#39;m rambling..I just wanted to share my thoughts with <br/>
others who understand. Sometimes I feel rather lonely because I don&#39;t know anyone <br/>
else who unschools in my area. <br/>
************************<br/>
Beth, consider this an invitation. Gather the kids in the car soon, drive a <br/>
couple hours north, and come to Salem for a couple days. We&#39;ll kick Julian out <br/>
of his room and you can stay here. We&#39;ll do some fun things and we can talk <br/>
about unshooling and you and your kids can meet Julian and see how unschooled <br/>
kids turn out. <br/>
