I remember reading in &#39;Living Joyfully with Children&#39; about their bedtime <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357670637">Hi Kolleen,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the idea.  My girls got up this morning about 1/2 hour before we were to leave and then just sat around as if there was nothing to do.  I asked what time they wanted to leave for basketball and said fine if they were ready, I would drive them, otherwise they would have to ride their bikes.  One minute before it was time to leave, I told them I would be out in the car.  My 12 yo followed and I started the car and pulled out the drive way.  When I got to the bottom of the driveway, my 10 yo came running out of the house and hopped in the car.  I was hoping I would not have to drive away without her but if she tested me I would have to.  The 12 yo did not eat any breakfast and now that it is 11:45, she is complaining of a headache and is in a terrible mood.  Oh well, I guess I can put up with it if she learns something from it.<br/>

What if the consequence of them choosing bedtimes and waketimes is no <br/>
basketball.  Suggest that if they can&#39;t get up and ready on time, they can&#39;t <br/>
play.  You mention they might not eat, or be grouchy which affects everyone.  <br/>
No basketball would affect only them, and perhaps the thought of no <br/>
basketball would motivate them to go to bed early the night before.<br/>

importance of getting up on time and eating breakfast.<br/>
You could then offer to either get them up yourself or buy them an alarm<br/>
clock. You can say that you will be ready to leave at 9.45 but after<br/>
that you will do your own thing. If they truly want to do basketball,<br/>
they&#39;ll get up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045612013">Ask them if they want the help (you waking them up) or if they want to take<br/>
control of that issue themselves.  If they want that control, ask them if<br/>
they&#39;d like a clock radio or some other type of alarm clock.  Have a<br/>
discussion about how they will feel if they don&#39;t leave enough time for<br/>
food, etc.  Leave it an open ended discussion so they will feel that if they<br/>
choose to &quot;do it themselves&quot; and it doesn&#39;t work, they won&#39;t feel like<br/>
loosers if they then have to ask you for help (such as waking them up).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110766515">We have a dance schedule to adhere to. It&#39;s up to dd to get up, get <br/>
ready, eat lunch, etc.  (she&#39;s 15) She has been late once that I can <br/>
recall and it was such a hassle for *her*; it didn&#39;t affect anyone <br/>
else but she was embarrassed walking into an already started class. <br/>
She&#39;s self-correct that situation. <br/>
The other factor is the drive time. I&#39;ve told her it takes me 25 <br/>
minutes to get *anywhere* in town and that&#39;s really true. She has to <br/>
allow me 30 minutes or she&#39;ll be late. Well, as teens do, she kept <br/>
fudging over into my time knowing I *have* been known to drive like a <br/>
maniac to get someplace on time. After several of those kinds of <br/>
trips, I warned her that I wasn&#39;t going to cover for her <br/>
time-problems anymore. We had one *more* late appt. (only be a few <br/>
minutes) but that was the last one. <br/>
I think they will be conscious enough to try to get there on time on <br/>
their own after only one embarrassing late entrance. Let them know <br/>
about the drive time, though.<br/>

&lt;&lt; You all have convinced me to give my two dd&#39;s (12 and 10) more freedom to <br/>

ready and have breakfast.  I figure now if they are in charge of when they go <br/>
to bed, they should darn well be in charge of getting themselves up and ready <br/>
in time for their basketball. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would ask them if they would like you to wake them up in time for basketball<br/>
practice days or would they like an alarm clock?  I would ask them if they <br/>
would<br/>
like a reminder the night before <br/>
basketball practice so that they can go to bed earlier if they feel the need.<br/>
I always let my kids know tomorrow is such and such you might want to<br/>
go to bed now so that you can get up early tomorrow to do that activity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What happens if they are late?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does the coach tell them they can&#39;t play, does he have any consequences?<br/>
I know that when my kids were late to an activity they didn&#39;t like coming<br/>
in after it got started and &quot;catching up&quot; so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt; What happens if they don&#39;t have enough time to eat breakfast and then get <br/>
grouchy because of problems with blood sugar.  Sure they are the ones that <br/>
feel bad but ultimately the whole family suffers because they are grouchy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would (and this is just me personally) bring some healthy snacks, like<br/>
cereal or granola bars or maybe even a bag of baby carrots and a couple<br/>
of bottles of water.  Something that isnt&#39; a lot of trouble for you, or maybe<br/>
you could ask them to pack these snacks the night before if they choose<br/>
to sleep in later.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt; How do I instill the importance of being on time?  I know many adults <br/>
that are chronically late and I personally feel it is rude to the people that <br/>
are either waiting or have to be interrupted when they arrive.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I think some folks are always early or on time and others are late.  My <br/>
parents always modeled being on time etc and I tend to be one of those folks<br/>
that are often late. Not all the time and not to everything but I understand <br/>
the<br/>
consequences. If we are late to a play or field trip where we are meeting our<br/>
group I darn well better be on time or I might not get to go in (and I <br/>
probably<br/>
paid in advance so I would lose out on $ also).  I try very hard to not make<br/>
friends wait for me if we have set up a specific meeting time and place and<br/>
am usually successful with that.  But if its a group setting and no one is<br/>
specifically waiting for me I could be very late.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think setting them up to succeed, in terms of the night before reminders and<br/>
the snacks will make them much more willing to see the importance of being<br/>
on time to this activity, rather than natural consequences (of which there are<br/>
none, you paid for the activity I assume and the coach is probably not going<br/>
to say you can&#39;t do it--on the other hand you  might say that since the <br/>
activity costs $ you may not sign them up for other activities if they can&#39;t <br/>
be<br/>
there for the entire time slot-I don&#39;t think you should have to waste your<br/>
money either).<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt; I know I ultimately have no control over whether they decide that being on <br/>
time and being responsible with their commitments are not important but I <br/>
feel I should do my best as their parent to help them with this.  Help!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well yep thats it in a nutshell and why I mentioned my personal history also. <br/>
 I<br/>
personally can&#39;t stand to be somewhere too terribly early (although I am <br/>
getting<br/>
better at it).  I am one of those folks who used to get to airports 20 <br/>
minutes <br/>
before takeoff. You better believe I will be there two hours before our next<br/>
flight with the changes in airport security though!  I think discussing why <br/>
you<br/>
think being on time is important to you and a good trait to have.<br/>

Thank you everyone for the good suggestions.  I think I will try getting some sort of agreement on what they want or need in this situation but I do want them to take full responsibility for this whole thing.  They have alarm clocks and this practice is not so early they should have trouble getting up so I am going to try the approach that if they need me to get them up, maybe they also need me to tell them when to go to bed.  I will not be communicating any of this in an I told you so voice (I hope).  This should be a win win situation.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What happens if they don&#39;t have enough time to eat breakfast and then get <br/>
grouchy because of problems with blood sugar.  Sure they are the ones that <br/>
feel bad but ultimately the whole family suffers because they are grouchy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would (and this is just me personally) bring some healthy snacks, like<br/>
cereal or granola bars or maybe even a bag of baby carrots and a couple<br/>
of bottles of water.  Something that isnt&#39; a lot of trouble for you, or maybe<br/>
you could ask them to pack these snacks the night before if they choose<br/>
to sleep in later.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; How do I instill the importance of being on time?  I know many adults <br/>
that are chronically late and I personally feel it is rude to the people that <br/>
are either waiting or have to be interrupted when they arrive.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I think some folks are always early or on time and others are late.  My <br/>
parents always modeled being on time etc and I tend to be one of those folks<br/>
that are often late. Not all the time and not to everything but I understand <br/>
the<br/>
consequences. If we are late to a play or field trip where we are meeting our<br/>
group I darn well better be on time or I might not get to go in (and I <br/>
probably<br/>
paid in advance so I would lose out on $ also).  I try very hard to not make<br/>
friends wait for me if we have set up a specific meeting time and place and<br/>
am usually successful with that.  But if its a group setting and no one is<br/>
specifically waiting for me I could be very late.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think setting them up to succeed, in terms of the night before reminders and<br/>
the snacks will make them much more willing to see the importance of being<br/>
on time to this activity, rather than natural consequences (of which there are<br/>
none, you paid for the activity I assume and the coach is probably not going<br/>
to say you can&#39;t do it--on the other hand you  might say that since the <br/>
activity costs $ you may not sign them up for other activities if they can&#39;t <br/>
be<br/>
there for the entire time slot-I don&#39;t think you should have to waste your<br/>
money either).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I know I ultimately have no control over whether they decide that being on <br/>
time and being responsible with their commitments are not important but I <br/>
feel I should do my best as their parent to help them with this.  Help!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well yep thats it in a nutshell and why I mentioned my personal history also. <br/>
I<br/>
personally can&#39;t stand to be somewhere too terribly early (although I am <br/>
getting<br/>
better at it).  I am one of those folks who used to get to airports 20 <br/>
minutes <br/>
before takeoff. You better believe I will be there two hours before our next<br/>
flight with the changes in airport security though!  I think discussing why <br/>
you<br/>
think being on time is important to you and a good trait to have.<br/>
