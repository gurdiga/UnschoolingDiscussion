We have dealt with this with one of our older boys. I would suggest going the <br/>
route of seeing a licensed clinical social worker.  We had very good luck <br/>
doing this. Our social worker saw our son several times and it was he (our son) <br/>
who finally thought medication might be warranted. The social worker referred <br/>
us to an adolescent psychiatrist who eventually did prescribe an <br/>
anti-depressant. But the psychiatrist kept close tabs, didn&#39;t push the medication and <br/>
consulted regularly with the social worker. The medication, combined with the <br/>
therapy with the social worker, worked wonders. If you want more specifics or have <br/>
other questions, email me offlist. I&#39;d be happy to provide whatever information <br/>
I can.<br/>
