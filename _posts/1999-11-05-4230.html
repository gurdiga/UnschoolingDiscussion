<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226546298">I enjoyed Aaron Falbel&#39;s article &quot;Beyong GWS: Growing Without Education&quot; on<br/>
pages 28-31 of the Sept/Oct issue of &quot;Growing Without Schooling.&quot;  Anyone<br/>
who questions the idea of education, will find this article well worth<br/>
reading.  I found the magazine at a local library.<br/>
<br/>
In it (page 28), Falbel includes a 1976 quote by John Holt:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education...now seems to me perhaps the most authoritarian and dangerous of<br/>
all the social inventions of mankind.  It is the deepest foundation of the<br/>
modern slave state, in which most people feel themselves to be nothing but<br/>
producers, consumers, spectators, and &#39;fans,&#39; driven more and more, in all<br/>
parts of their lives, by greed, envy, and fear.  My concern is not to<br/>
improve &#39;education&#39; but to do away with it, to end the ugly and antihuman<br/>
business of people-shaping and to allow and help people to shape<br/>
themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The essay is packed with interesting thoughts.  Here is one other I found<br/>
particularly good:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education teaches us that we must adapt ourselves to society as it is, that<br/>
we must keep pace with the dictates of &quot;progress,&quot; that life is a race, and<br/>
that we need education to get ahead of the next guy or else we&#39;ll be left<br/>
behind.&quot;  pg. 30.<br/>
<br/>
When we reject the mindset that life is a race, we loosen the stranglehold<br/>
which education has over us.  Thus freed, we might begin to learn things for<br/>
more authentic and natural reasons.  We may then begin to fully enjoy the<br/>
delight of discovery, of intellectual stimulation, of the deep and<br/>
ever-changing diversity and endless wonder our world.<br/>
