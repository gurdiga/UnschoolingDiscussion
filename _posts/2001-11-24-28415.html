occasionally posting for I guess 8 months or so. I am so tired of the single <br/>
mindedness of some that I have been deleting off and on so I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
read yet another nitpicking stint. It isn&#39;t just that, if ones opinion is the <br/>
only right opinion there is no room for growth. No one person is an <br/>
authority, the universe is too spirited for that. <br/>
<br/>
   The bitterness and venom that some posters write w/ really have turned me <br/>
off. I am so close to unsubing but then I get a tidbit of unschooling wisdom <br/>
and stay. I Thank you Sandra for you insights and stories, I know unschooling <br/>
will work for us. You have encouraged me w/out knowing it.<br/>

Where do you live?  Here in Texas, it can be done very easily.  A social<br/>
worker simply has to show up and take them.  She/he requires no proof or<br/>
even concerns about possible abuse until the show cause hearing several days<br/>
later.<br/>
