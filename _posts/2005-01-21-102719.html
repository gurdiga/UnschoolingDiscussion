<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468041445">Since this is a New Year.. and my family and I plan on attending the Live & <br/>
Learn Confrerence in Oct 05...it&#39;s so near our home town for a change!! I <br/>
thought this might be a good time to say &#39;hello&#39; again. I&#39;m Julie in MO.. <br/>
mom of 3 dd&#39;s.. ages 20, 14, and 9 yrs... the oldest is on her own, and will <br/>
be making me a &#39;grandma&#39; soon... We live in the country.. I raise dairy <br/>
goats, love gardening/herbs, and riding my motorcycle. We have a couple <br/>
horse&#39;s, but I want to sell them this year to make room for more goats! My <br/>
14 yo is a poet and guitar player.. 9 yo is an amazing artist and learning <br/>
to air-brush too. We tried the school at home stuff.. but it failed of <br/>
course... total unschoolers&#39;s for the past 8 or so years....I really look <br/>
forward to meeting many of you in person this October! I hope to be more of <br/>
a poster and less of a lurker in the future! Julie in MO</div>
