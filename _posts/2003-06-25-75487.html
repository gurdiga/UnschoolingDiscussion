II think this post is decidedly hurtful. There are those of us who have researched and questioned; we have looked at the reports; we have shared these with you.<br/>
<br/>
So - in the face of that - your daughter says &quot;That&#39;s the stupidest thing I&#39;ve ever heard.&quot;  &quot;You are hurting my feelings talking about this.&quot;  (How is that possibly hurting her feelings?&quot; ) Then with a seemimngly very smug attitude you dismiss it!! That&#39;s the weakest  thing I&#39;ve read all month.<br/>
<br/>
Whether we like it or not - <br/>
Dairy products are filled with chemicals and poisons.<br/>
That&#39;s a fact.<br/>
Global agri-businesses are concerned with getting as much milk out of a cow as possible. They are pumped w/ so many things that the cows are unable to walk - they are all &#39;milk&#39;. The agri-businesses support each other. This company sells chemicals to that company who sells machines to that company who run dairy farms. The global businesses are in bed together and yes, for the most part - it&#39;s the same group that owns the media.<br/>
<br/>
The cows are not walked or washed. They are born, bred, drugged, milked, slaughtered and sold.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than look into what is being said here.....it&#39;s dismissed.<br/>
<br/>
Under what definition of open-minded is that?<br/>
Under what definition of intelligent is that?<br/>
<br/>
I hate it that dairy products aren&#39;t good for humans. I absolutely hate it!! Why? Have you ever had Edy&#39;s Ice Cream? or Hagan Daz? During my moon period - I love chocolate ice cream.........<br/>
<br/>
How about cheese?<br/>
My stars, if I had a dollar for every bag of Smart Food popcorn I&#39;ve eaten....or a dollar for every cheese snack or cheese dish.....<br/>
But when I looked at the facts, really looked at the facts - dairy products are bad for us.<br/>
<br/>
You can dismiss it - but that won&#39;t help your daughters skin.<br/>
I was lucky - I had great skin. - I had very little dairy, liots of vegetables, liots of fruits, lots of water, lots of excercise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Refusing to examine what is the dairy industry...and what it does to us...... is just plain foolish.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not like you.<br/>

Wait, Paula didn&#39;t say we were stupid.  Paula&#39;s daughter thought that<br/>
the *idea* of her giving up dairy was &quot;the stupidest idea ever&quot;, which,<br/>
having been a tempery teen myself, I think means she finds the idea<br/>
threatening and unpleasant.  Her autonomy is important to her,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443449263">Hi,<br/>
Thanks for your post. I&#39;m referring to the agri-businesses that produce most of our dairy products. I know there are organic dairies.  What dairy we (as a family) do use comes from one.<br/>
However, the bulk of the dairy - butter, cheese, yogurt that we ( as a nation) consume - the bulk of the dairy that gets added to our snacks,  or that we get in restaurants - these come from agri-businesses.   While it&#39;s true that I do live in New England - not exactly big sky country - I find it hard to believe that these massive places - &quot;farms&quot; w/ 100,000 cows and more are only selling to city folk. <br/>
<br/>
It is, of course a personal choice whether or not to take any of this information seriously or dismiss it.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
Janis<br/>

As much as I agree with lots of what you said here, Janis, I disagree that<br/>
Paula was being hurtful or smug.  She made a suggestion to her teen who<br/>
dismissed it.  The reality of teens is that there isn&#39;t much we can do when<br/>
they dismiss our suggestions.  Maybe the girl will think about it and decide<br/>
to try going dairy free some other time, but it won&#39;t happen if her mother<br/>
keeps pushing the idea.<br/>

write, and whether you trust, as you have no way of knowing, that I know of <br/>
what I speak. This is not a US list, it is an international one, and though <br/>
many things in Canada are simmilar to the US, the dairy industry is not one <br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying that what you said about agri-business cows is untrue. I am <br/>
saying that it is not true for all non-organic dairy farms, at least not in <br/>
Nova Scotia. I am not saying that everything is rosy in Nova Scotia dairy <br/>
farms, but it certainly is much better than the mega-farms you describe.<br/>
<br/>
Now if you want to discuss chicken farms or hog farms - yikes! Those are <br/>
scary places. I really do have a degree in agriculture and most of what I <br/>
learned scared me. That&#39;s why I majored in soil physics.<br/>

area.  I&#39;ve visited a few of them, been friends with the families who owned them. <br/>
 The cows free graze til milking  time ( twice a day)  Then they come in to <br/>
be milked.   They know thier routine, the cows will start in to the barn at <br/>
milking time. ( I do mean LOTS of cows, hundreds) They hook them up to milking <br/>
machines, its fascinating to watch.    And dairy cows are definitetly not used <br/>
for beef, there are beef farms around here too.  It could be a regional thing, <br/>
I don&#39;t know.  The milk, eggs, meat and produce around here is generally <br/>
homegrown and sold locally.  YUMMY!<br/>
