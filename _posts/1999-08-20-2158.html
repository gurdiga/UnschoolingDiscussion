<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004494589">Hi Olivia,<br/>
<br/>
We have been talking about this on our local e-mail loop as our school<br/>
district has also asked more from us than what is required by law.  Get a<br/>
copy of your state laws and find out what is required of you.  If it does<br/>
not state that you are required to have a certain amt. of days or hours<br/>
then you don&#39;t need to provide that info.  If you know that your school<br/>
board is very thorough on looking at your portfoilo and you feel that<br/>
they could give you extra problems by questioning everything that you do-<br/>
maybe you should comply OR recieve counsel from the HOMESCHOOL LEGAL<br/>
DEFENSE ASSOCIATION-  www.hslda.com.  <br/>
<br/>
Here in Florida attendance is not required or a daily log needed , but<br/>
they ( here in Osceola Co.) wanted a daily log and hours recorded from<br/>
us.  I was able to find help through our state orginization called the<br/>
Florida Parent Educators Association.  <br/>
<br/>

   Date: Fri, 20 Aug 1999 01:52:41 -0400<br/>
   From: Olivia &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:liv2learn@...">liv2learn@...</a>&gt;<br/>
Subject: journals and portfolios<br/>
<br/>
Question...<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who uses daily journals, logs and portfolios to satisfy their<br/>
state&#39;s assessment requirement:  how much detail about daily or weekly<br/>
activities do you provide?  Do you just list some highlights or write<br/>
in-depth descriptions of activities?  How much material do you put in a<br/>
portfolio? Should I start collecting it throughout the year, or just<br/>
gather<br/>
up things near the time when the assessment is due? <br/>
<br/>
Also, my school dept. required me to agree to a &quot;minimum of 900 hours of<br/>
instruction.&quot;  How can I prove (or the school dept. disprove) that I met<br/>
this requirement through what I write in our log?  I know my son is<br/>
learning something every day, but my daily journal may not reflect this<br/>
to<br/>
the satisfaction of the school superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Olivia<br/>

there but all very incomplete and vague at best.  aside from noting <br/>
several appearingly interesting subjects on their main page, i was <br/>
able to go directly too some really good info on the MT hslaws.  <br/>
but perhaps when i go back and start really digging into their <br/>

wrong.  However, I now think this is tied into the HSLDA &quot;recommendation&quot;.   <br/>
I have heard from other lists that they are good for info, but when you <br/>
really need them in a legal sense, they are very strict in their parameters <br/>
for representation.  Use them for what you need, but keep in mind Charlotte&#39;s <br/>
warning.<br/>

Click on Support Group in your area (or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
He lists links to state sites for each state where you can get the laws and <br/>
sometimes summaries of them directly from the state homeschooling group(s).  <br/>
I found the HSLDA summary of the Mass case law to be so bare bones as to be <br/>
unusable.  But with that boilerplate format, it looks complete.  Anyone <br/>
trying to use HSLDA&#39;s summary could have been put through the wringer by <br/>
their local school committee and wouldn&#39;t have had a clue about their rights.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to find out the other side ot the HSLDA story, you can <br/>
download the  HSFAR files (and read some of the others above them) at Home <br/>

<br/>
Well, gee Michele, why didn&#39;t ya just ask?<br/>
<br/>
Laws in Montana are pretty simple, I mean kids have to have vaccinations, <br/>
with a religious exemption available, the only thing that I&#39;ve found the <br/>
Superintendents want is a letter simply stating that the kids will be <br/>
homeschooled.  You are supposed to keep attendance.<br/>
<br/>
You are on the Montana Homeschool list aren&#39;t you?  Montana&#39;s Homeschool law <br/>
is under 20-5-102.  20-5-102 says:<br/>
<br/>
20-5-109. Nonpublic school requirements for compulsory enrollment exemption. <br/>
To<br/>
qualify its students for exemption from compulsory enrollment under 20-5-102 <br/>
, a nonpublic or home school shall:<br/>
<br/>
(5) in the case of home schools, notify the county superintendent of schools, <br/>
of the county in which the home school is located, in each school fiscal year <br/>
of the student&#39;s attendance at the school. <br/>
<br/>
20-5-111. Responsibilities and rights of parent who provides home school -- <br/>
rights of<br/>
child in home school. Subject to the provisions of 20-5-109 , a parent has <br/>
the authority to instruct his child, stepchild, or ward in a home school and <br/>
is solely responsible for:<br/>
(1) the educational philosophy of the home school;<br/>
(2) the selection of instructional materials, curriculum, and textbooks;<br/>
(3) the time, place, and method of instruction; and<br/>
(4) the evaluation of the home school instruction. <br/>
<br/>
The whole law at that moment can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mtche.org/mchelaw.htm">http://www.mtche.org/mchelaw.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen anything where it says you must have certain numbers of hours <br/>
per grade like HSLDA&#39;s sites says you have to.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What does that mean?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It means that HSLDA will spew lots of stuff.  Keeps the head honcho&#39;s money <br/>
coming in to the tune of a 6 figure income.  Last I saw on the IRS filings <br/>
well over $100,000.  <br/>
<br/>
Sending out shock alerts, and claiming to represent homeschoolers while <br/>
running for public offices and lobbying congress on issues unrelated to <br/>
homeschooling seem to have ecked out a nice living.  <br/>

Another private list that I&#39;m on did a review of their state laws in that <br/>

of the laws were way outdated.  <br/>

 It means that HSLDA will spew lots of stuff.  Keeps the head honcho&#39;s money <br/>
 coming in to the tune of a 6 figure income.  Last I saw on the IRS filings <br/>
 well over $100,000.  <br/>
 <br/>
 Sending out shock alerts, and claiming to represent homeschoolers while <br/>
 running for public offices and lobbying congress on issues unrelated to <br/>
 homeschooling seem to have ecked out a nice living.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The latest figures I saw were in HEM. (Home Education Magazine)  Mike Farris <br/>
was paid $230,000 and the organization&#39;s overall budget for employees is over <br/>
$2 million.  They took in $5.3 million in 1997.  The amount spent on helping <br/>
to defend homeschoolers?  $188,000.<br/>

Where is YOUR money being used?<br/>

&gt; that I&#39;ve found the Superintendents want is a letter simply stating<br/>

one which was only a couple of weeks ago now.  the MT list is very <br/>
quiet so far which is fine since i&#39;m still trying to get organized <br/>
with the overwhelming amount of email i&#39;m getting each day now from <br/>
several lists!  i haven&#39;t even had a chance to intro myself on the<br/>
MT list yet either.  the wasted searching i mentioned above was <br/>
actually done prior to my learning of this list and the MT <br/>
homeschooling list.  <br/>

member, you cannot access the actual statutes, you only get their summary of <br/>
the law.  In MY state, they &quot;hide&quot; a very crucial part of the law in their <br/>
summary, one that makes it easier to be an unschooler in the state of WA.  <br/>

&gt; .  If you know that your school<br/>
&gt; &gt; board is very thorough on looking at your portfoilo and you feel that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they could give you extra problems by questioning everything that you<br/>
do-<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe you should comply OR recieve counsel from the HOMESCHOOL LEGAL<br/>
&gt; &gt; DEFENSE ASSOCIATION-  www.hslda.com.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please note, that many times the information provided by HSLDA is<br/>
incorrect.<br/>
&gt; As a matter of fact, the information provided about Alabama has changed<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; the years, but the statute has not.  I would solely depend on what this<br/>
&gt; business has to say about any of our state laws.<br/>

&gt; Surely you mean you would NOT soley depend....<br/>
