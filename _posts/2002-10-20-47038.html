  <br/>
I have a dog question and if you&#39;re too young to know the answer I don&#39;t<br/>
want to hear about it.&lt;g&gt;  What kind of dog was Spot?  The Dick and Jane<br/>
Spot.  He was some kind of Spaniel I think, black and white but I don&#39;t<br/>
have a picture and I can&#39;t remember what he was.  My son has been asking<br/>
since I told him about those old Dick and Jane books.   He would need to<br/>
know the breed of their dog. <br/>
Come Kelly.  Come and see.  Come, come.  Come and see.  Come and see<br/>
Spot. <br/>

There are new homeschoolers every day, and there&#39;s always some percentage of <br/>
them who have been told and so they&#39;re sure that we all MUST join HSLDA, and <br/>
that Christian homeschoolers invented homeschooling and made it legal in 50 <br/>
states, and sometimes a few who express puzzlement about why anyone would <br/>
CHOOSE to homeschool if the lord hadn&#39;t commanded them to.<br/>
<br/>
This comes up the same way how will they get into college what about algebra <br/>
what about socialization and will they ever read come up.<br/>
