<div id="ygrps-yiv-703355632">hi,<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m sending a comment made on another list i&#39;m on  followed by my response.<br/>
-susan<br/>
austin,tx<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from taffie:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The main family was clearly a school-at-home type. Naturally the<br/>
&gt; socialization issue came up and a strong emphasis on that not everyone<br/>
&gt; can homeschool, are they doing enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Did you catch how surprised that Oprah was when the second family<br/>
&gt; mentioned they had homeschooled all the way through all 12 grades? The<br/>
&gt; kids were now in college and I thought it was great that the one son<br/>
&gt; mentioned the national homeschool basketball game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oveall, considering how anti-homeschooling the studio audience was, this<br/>
&gt; was a good intro for them into homeschooling. I think if an unschooling<br/>
&gt; family had been featured it would have been just so far out of the realm<br/>
&gt; of possibilities to the mindset of the people there, they wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; been able to process it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So a door has been opened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my response:<br/>
<br/>
i thought exactly the same thing (and we&#39;re unschoolers).  the families they<br/>
chose were very good for an<br/>
introduction and an unschooling family or any discussion about child-led hs,<br/>
imo, would have literal blow their<br/>
minds.  i really felt the audience had reached their max in terms of being<br/>
introduced to &#39;new material&#39;.  but to be<br/>
fair i think most hs&#39;ers (not all), particularly people who started hs after ps<br/>
had failed them, begin with<br/>
school-at-home and gradually relaxes as they bond more and learn to trust<br/>
themselves and their children.  imo,<br/>
it&#39;s a natural process when acquiring a new skill and i believe hs is just<br/>
that, a new skill for both the parents and<br/>
the children.  all in all it was hopeful and i was not disappointed with<br/>
oprah&#39;s behavior and remarks (yes i did<br/>
catch her reaction i think hs is a &#39;culture shock&#39; for her but the nice thing<br/>
is she&#39;s appeared open to it, which has<br/>
not always been the case for her)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744042106">hi,<br/>
<br/>
on another list someone said this was NOT the show, just a segment piece, and<br/>
that the hs show is being set for a later date.    this was just a follow up to<br/>
questions raised from a previous show regarding teenages, where the dr, in the<br/>
seg shown yesterday, said ps were not doing their job and a number of hs wrote<br/>
in saying that&#39;s why they hs.<br/>
<br/>
-susan<br/>
p.s. i contacted them as well<br/>

&gt; Well, they were contacted by me.  But they didn&#39;t call!  Told hubby he was<br/>
&gt; going to have to watch the kids and everything!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m sorry I missed the show now.<br/>

Click on talk about the show, and add your feelings to the 80+ posts that are<br/>
there already.  It was letters from hsers that Oprah producers to do a piece on<br/>
hsing in the first place - I believe it will be letters that can also repair<br/>
the damage done.  (BTW, some folks have already talked about unschooling - now<br/>
is the time to add your 2 cents!! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
