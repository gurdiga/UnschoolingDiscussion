Hi Anita,<br/>
<br/>
Back several lifestyles ago, I was a speech pathologist.  I think your idea <br/>
is good as long as he can make the sound correctly, and it sounds like he <br/>
can.  He might not even hear when he&#39;s lisping and when he&#39;s not, so he might <br/>
need your help discerning that.  Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044831153">Oh please do be careful here with what kind of self image he is getting out<br/>
of all of this, I had a lisp when I was a kid , probably still do, I was put<br/>
into speach classes one year at school, they made me stand on my head and<br/>
say silly sally sells sea shells on the sea shore over and over this was to<br/>
feel how the toung was supposed to be positioned in the mouth when using an<br/>
s anyway my point being I am very self concious as an adult about having a<br/>
lisp, and most people say they have never even noticed one! and I am<br/>
concious of it most of the time going out of my way to try and make sure it<br/>
is not there!  how many hours days or months of my life have been wasted<br/>
trying to make sure no one would notice because obviously it was not<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; or I would not have been sent to speach over it!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;speech therapy once a week.  We practice at home about 4 times a week.  He<br/>
&gt;was making excellent progress unti we took a vacation and didn&#39;t practice<br/>
&gt;for several weeks.  He has lost some of the skills he had acquired and is<br/>
&gt;not making much progress.  His main problem is with  &quot;s.&quot;  He sticks his<br/>
&gt;tongue out between his teeth when he says it.  He needs to practice not<br/>
&gt;doing so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the problem is that he&#39;s not trying.  He doesn&#39;t seem to perceive<br/>
&gt;there is a problem,though now that he&#39;s regressed adults have a hard time<br/>
&gt;understanding him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My question is &quot;how can I help motivate him?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have decided I will no longer interpret what he says to adults.  My idea<br/>
&gt;is for him to experience their not understanding him so he realizes he has<br/>
&gt;a problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any other ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
