<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721744933">December 1, 2003 (AP). At New York&#39;s Kennedy airport today, an individual  later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board  a plane in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a calculator.<br/>
<br/>
At a hastily-called press conference, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he believes  the man is a member of the notorious al-Jebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Al-Jebra is a fearsome cult,&quot;  Ashcroft said. &quot;They pursue their processes by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a  search of absolutes. They use secret code names like &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and refer frequently to &quot;unknowns&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But as the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, there are 3 sides to every triangle,&quot; Ashcroft declared. &quot;We have determined they belong to a common denominator of the Axis of co-eval with coordinates in every country.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, &quot;If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am gratified that our homeland defenders has given us a sine that they are protracting us from these math-dogs who are willing to disintegrate us with calculus disregard.  Murky statisticians love to inflict plane on every<br/>
sphere of influence,&quot; the President said, adding: &quot;Under the circumferences, we must differentiate their root,  make our point, and draw the line.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
President Bush warned, &quot;These weapons of math instruction have the potential to decimal everything in their math on a scalene never before seen unless we become exponents of a higher power and begin to factor-in random facts of  vertex.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bush concluded: &quot;To al-Jebra, I say: &#39;Read my ellipse. Though you may  continue to multiply, your days are numbered as the hypotenuse tightens around your neck.&#39;&quot;<br/>
