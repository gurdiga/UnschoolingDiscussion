<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702422954">Someone (can&#39;t remember who) wrote:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I say &quot;NO paper, you will not get a piece of paper&quot; and they impose<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oversight on my  family, I cannot act surprised.**<br/>
<br/>
Ned responds: <br/>
No, I won&#39;t act surprised, but I will have made my point that the demand is<br/>
wrong, unnecessary, ridiculous under the circumstances, and is being uphelp<br/>
to cover, or save, the asses of ignorant people.<br/>
<br/>
And Betsy asks,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Has anyone seen the Barbara Hershey movie where she plays an activist in<br/>
&gt; S. Africa who is jailed for her political activities?  I&#39;m totally<br/>
&gt; blanking on the title.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sincerely hope, Betsy, that you are trying to point out that it takes<br/>
courageous people, such as the character Hershey played (I can&#39;t remember<br/>
that title either), to overturn bad laws. A good example was Mandella, who<br/>
spent 27 years in a small cell, trying to end Apartheid.   Was it worth it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-820956784">For those who think it&#39;s no big deal to have homeschool laws making <br/>
us hand in things to schools, what would you do if you were a <br/>
complete, total unschooler who lives in PA?  At the end of the year, <br/>
you have to hand in a portfolio with samples of the student&#39;s work, <br/>
along with a letter from a qualified evaluator stating that progress <br/>
has been made.  If the school district doesn&#39;t like it they can <br/>
initiate due process and ask for a more proof that education has <br/>
occured.  So imagine you unschool and don&#39;t have workbook pages to <br/>
hand in.  You could hand in some brochures of places you&#39;ve been, <br/>
maybe photocopy a penpal letter your child writes, and if you&#39;re <br/>
luckky, you&#39;ll find a mathmania or puzzlemania book they&#39;ve done.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind you&#39;ll be handing this portfolio in next to total school <br/>
at homers who will hand in thick scrapbooks filled with all kinds of <br/>
things that will impress school officials.  You&#39;ll also have to hand <br/>
in a log, which the law states is a list of books you&#39;ve read but <br/>
which some people interpret as a log of daily activities similar to a <br/>
teacher&#39;s lesson plan.  Oh yeah, and also the results of standardized <br/>
tests in grade 3, 5, and 8. <br/>
<br/>
So do you...<br/>
<br/>
1. Spend a day or two making your child fill in worksheets to fill a <br/>
portfolio? <br/>
 2. Hand in the skimpy portfolio and risk court? <br/>
 3.  Go underground and not hand in anything? <br/>

If I were in Pennsylvania I would hand in quotes and testimonials from other <br/>
people, and keep a scrapbook diary-style, with commentary about open <br/>

<br/>
I would summarize the progress in short-paragraph prose, if I feared legal <br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
If they gave me trouble I would register with Clonlara.<br/>
<br/>
But in my real life I live in New Mexico and I don&#39;t register, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
take the kids for testing before the law was changed.<br/>

an employee in another (if you happen to find bordering states that<br/>
    don&#39;t have income tax in one and don&#39;t have sales tax in another <br/>
figure you have just put 25 to 30 percent of your income back in your<br/>
    pocket (and so have your customers) who do likewise.<br/>
<br/>
    Makes it harder for any one state to push you around with stupid <br/>
laws too.<br/>

You could do what I did recently, NOT move into that beautiful state due to<br/>
their laws, and let them know exactly why.<br/>
If I lived there already, I would go underground while looking for a new<br/>
life out of state and then tell them exactly WHY i left the state.<br/>
This way, they get NOTHING from our family (money, support, etc) and I don&#39;t<br/>

the state than my risking my childrens lives and futures. I would NEVER ask<br/>
my children to put themselves at risk for MY conviction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147270098">Thanks Joyce. :)  I already am involved, although not as actively as <br/>
some.  Karen and Norma are awesome ladies.  We have a bill written <br/>
and now we need to get the education committee to vote it out of <br/>
committee.  It would be easier if there weren&#39;t homeschoolers in the <br/>
state lobbying against the bill because they feel the need <br/>
accountability. SIGH!!!<br/>
<br/>
But in the meantime, we still have to decide how to comply.  <br/>
<br/>
And even in the state with the best homeschooling law, there is still <br/>
a chance that a social worker is going to try to get you on something <br/>
related to homeschooling.  That&#39;s why I believe that a better <br/>
homeschool law is a nice first step, but an end to compulsory <br/>
education would be even more awesome. That would end the state&#39;s <br/>
interest in education and get them off our backs altogether. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314317611">It&#39;s easy to homeschool/unschool if you all you have to do is follow <br/>
the law, even in restrictive states like PA.  The problem is that <br/>
many school districts ask for documentation that is above and beyond <br/>
the law. Superintendents have an incredible amount of power and there <br/>
is nothing punitive in the law against them if they abuse their <br/>
power.  They do it all the time.  Homeschoolers give in because they <br/>
don&#39;t have time and money to go to court and fight every time school <br/>
districts abuse their power.  <br/>
<br/>
Superintendents don&#39;t even need to have probable cause to initiate <br/>
due process against homeschoolers.  But they usually don&#39;t initiate <br/>
due process because that would cost them money.  So they threaten <br/>
families with truancy charges.  <br/>
<br/>
Many people succesfuly homeschool/unschool following only what the <br/>
law says and no more.  However, you have to live in the right <br/>
district in order to get away with it.  And even if you do live in <br/>
the right district, you have to hope the district doesn&#39;t hire a new <br/>
superintendent.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This may be true in PA. But it wouldn&#39;t be safe to assume that the same<br/>
attitude exists across the US. When I&#39;ve been asked for more than the case<br/>
law allows, all I do is quote the appropriate passage.<br/>
<br/>
Though I&#39;ve never read all the state folders on homeschooling message boards<br/>
to see the problems people have, the times where people have posted in the<br/>
general areas in a panic about being asked to do too much have not led to<br/>
dire consequences. That doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen only that it isn&#39;t<br/>
rampant across the US.<br/>
<br/>
The best way for homeschoolers to help themselves is to contact their state<br/>
homeschooling group. Most have webpages. Most have FAQs to tell you how to<br/>
handle superintendents who ask too much. If that fails, there&#39;s always<br/>
Google!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a list of state groups at National Home Education Network<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the cases I have seen it is usually the principal of a particular school <br/>
that doesn&#39;t know the law, who is the one that gives the most grief to <br/>
parents wanting to homeschool. IMO, nine times out of ten, you don&#39;t have to <br/>
have money to fight ignorance. <br/>
A principal of a local school tried to tell a friend of mine that she <br/>
couldn&#39;t homeschool. She even threatened my friend with truancy charges. <br/>
(Sent by registered mail, with the date she was expected to show in family <br/>
court to answer the charges against her.) Now my friend had registered her <br/>
homeschool with the KDOE, and she had notified the principal of the school <br/>
that her son would not be returning. She still had to go through this, <br/>
almost. I went with her to a meeting with the principal, armed with a copy of <br/>
the statute about private schools. (Kansas doesn&#39;t recognize homeschooling, <br/>
we fall under the private school statute.) I asked the principal to show us, <br/>
in writing, where the law says we can&#39;t homeschool. She couldn&#39;t do it, she <br/>
apologized for being wrong, and that was it. <br/>
Nine times out of ten, things like this are because of uninformed or <br/>
misinformed people. Nine times out of ten, four words do the trick. &quot;Show me <br/>
in writing.&quot; (Then again, there is that tenth time. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
