<br>I read this last week. &nbsp;It is not very well written. &nbsp;I have written back and 
<br>forth with Brad Withers, author of the petition. &nbsp;He seems like a very nice, 
<br>very concerned, very frustrated hser in NY State. &nbsp;He wants to do something 
<br>to help hsers but I don&#39;t think he got as many responses as he wanted from 
<br>this petition. &nbsp;I also believe that he is reconsidering the petition idea all 
<br>together and is looking to get involved in other ways as well.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184190109"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">Also testing is TOTALLY a state-by-state thing, and any activity (anywhere) 
<br>which attempts or suggest anything about federal regulations about 
<br>homeschooling is going to get a huge *NO* response from most homeshoolers.
