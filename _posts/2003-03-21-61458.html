<div id="ygrps-yiv-1337659773">Hi Everyone. <br/>
I have been reading all of your letters for a while<br/>
now, and love your insights. I don&#39;t actually have<br/>
kids. In fact, I am in college. I was unschooled until<br/>
8th grade, when I made the choice to go to H.S. - A<br/>
choice I now regret but at the time seemed like I good<br/>
idea because I too felt like I was &quot;behind&quot;. I was<br/>
amazed by high schoolers lack of motivation and<br/>
excitement for learning. For the first year or so I<br/>
soaked everything up. I loved it. However, the farther<br/>
I went the less I learned for the sake of learning and<br/>
the more I did it for the grade. I got so wrapped up<br/>
in getting good grades and spending time with my<br/>
friends that I lost track of my beautiful family and<br/>
my passions. At first I got straight A&#39;s because I<br/>
worked hard. Later I worked hard to get straight A&#39;s.<br/>
I stopped being able to do all the cool things I had<br/>
done when I was unschooled. My parents just sat back<br/>
and let me do what I said I wanted. I graduated at the<br/>
top of my class and got several great scholarships. I<br/>
spent my freshman year of college at a small private<br/>
school in Kansas. I was not happy. This year, I<br/>
transfered to the University of Northern CO in<br/>
Greeley. I am enjoying it, but I still feel stifled<br/>
and stuck into routines that I would rather not<br/>
follow. A couple of weeks ago I finally started<br/>
reading the teenage liberation handbook (My mum has<br/>
been leaving it around for ages). It depresses me to<br/>
think how &#39;normal&#39; my life has become. I am majoring<br/>
in Art and Biology, and I love my classes, but I hate<br/>
the passivity of the public educations learning<br/>
process. I want to get out and see the world. I want<br/>
to take bike trips accross the country, I want to sew<br/>
a quilt, plant a garden, travel the globe. I feel like<br/>
I never have time to pursue my passions. Once again I<br/>
am wrapped up in getting good grades. I feel like I<br/>
have to so I can get good scholarships that will allow<br/>
me to afford to pay gallons of money to a school I am<br/>
not really sure is teaching me more than I would learn<br/>
on my own. So I think about all these things, and<br/>
wonder if I should just quit. Rise out of school. But<br/>
I don&#39;t really ever hear of college students doing it.<br/>
You can argue that a H.S. diploma is not necessary,<br/>
but you cannot say the same thing about a college<br/>
degree. I would love to hear what your thoughts are<br/>
about my situation. Thank you for listening.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310964310">I understand what you&#39;re saying. I wasn&#39;t homeschooled, and I went to<br/>
University and did that whole routine - I learned to live the system and<br/>
did just fine doing so (well, one has to wonder what I missed out<br/>
on...but that&#39;s another thread). My husband hated High School and he<br/>
hated University. When we got married he had two years left for his<br/>
degree. It was a real struggle for him. Finally he decided to quit. We<br/>
looked at our situation. He had a business, and loved it. He is a<br/>
finance guy - does personal finance for people. The stuff he was<br/>
learning in his finance degree was corporate finance and really didn&#39;t<br/>
apply to his work. Finally, after much deliberation, he decided to quit.<br/>
Sometimes he regrets that he quit simply because he quit. He does want<br/>
to finish his degree one day - but truthfully, I don&#39;t think it will<br/>
have that much impact on his income, or anything else. It&#39;s just a<br/>
personal goal he has.<br/>
 <br/>
I do think University education can be valuable - but you have to be<br/>
careful how you go about it. You have to make sure that you&#39;re really<br/>
learning the things you love and doing it for you, instead of jumping<br/>
through the hoops the school system has set up. That&#39;s what I did....and<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I really obtained a &#39;higher education&#39; by going to<br/>
University. I just got a piece of paper.<br/>

People say it all the time. <br/>
<br/>
It depends what you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Too many people just want to go to college to get a degree because they&#39;ve <br/>
been tld it&#39;s necessary.  Necessary for what?<br/>
<br/>
Too often a college degree is necessary to make parents happy.   And then the <br/>
new graduate has to pay off loans, often with money made at a job for which <br/>
that degree was not necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to teach, so I needed that degree.  Most of the people I went to <br/>
school with had no idea what they wanted.  Some went into law or medicine, so <br/>
what they learned as undergrads helped them, but it didn&#39;t matter which <br/>
degree they had to get into the advanced program, they just needed any old <br/>
degree and good entry exams.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trapped it&#39;s because of your belief in the necessity and perhaps <br/>
because of your fear of a time line which I don&#39;t think you will find carved <br/>
into the rocks in Colorado or tattooed onto your body anywhere.   It&#39;s in <br/>
your mind.  It&#39;s a learned idea you&#39;re defending.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could take a year off Bethany. I did. Admittedly that was in England when it was all free.<br/>
I spent the year back-packing round the world and returned too university feeling much better. Some of it still grated and looking back, having a degree has been irrelevant to my life.<br/>
A year out would allow you figure out what you want to do. Take that bike tour. Try the world of jobs. Maybe you&#39;ll go back, maybe you wont.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

Let me tell you about my sister, it may help.  My sister is 25 now, <br/>
she went to public school all her life, got really good grades, the <br/>
whole thing.  She got into a good college with scholarships.  She <br/>
spent 2 and a half years at college and hated it.  She didn&#39;t know <br/>
what she wanted to do so she felt like she was wasting her time and <br/>
money.  She was disgusted by the apathy of the other students and she <br/>
finally left.  Of course the family thought she was crazy, but she <br/>
knew it was what she needed to do.  She moved to New Mexico from <br/>
Virginia and hooked up with a temp agency.  She did a variety of jobs <br/>
and made enough money to support herself while she tried to figure <br/>
out what she wanted.  One of the temp jobs led her to the right path <br/>
and she went back to school 3 years after she dropped out.  She is <br/>
now in acupuncture school and loving it.  She says dropping out of <br/>
school was the best thing she ever did.  She would probably have a <br/>
degree in business now if she had stayed and she would be miserable.  <br/>
If you would like to email her, contact me offlist and I will give <br/>
you her email address.  She would be glad to help someone follow <br/>
their heart.<br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of options in this world, you don&#39;t have to stay <br/>
in one that isn&#39;t working for you.  College will always be there, you <br/>
can go back whenever you want.  Use this time to get to know yourself <br/>
and your dreams.  If you do go back to college one day it will mean <br/>
so much more to you.  I hope this helped.  Good luck with whatever <br/>
you decide.<br/>

  On Wednesday I took Sierra to get her haircut. The guy that was doing it was talking to her and naturally ended up asking her what grade she was in. She told him she didn&#39;t do school and we started to talk about homeschooling. He was saying he has heard a lot of people lately homeschooling. We talked about diploma&#39;s and GED&#39;s and college. He was telling me that most of his friends that went to college are making less money now than he is cutting hair!<br/>
