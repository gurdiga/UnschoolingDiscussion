He wants to open them all (sometimes even 2 of the same kind when there is an old opened one and a new one) and pour all into different glasses. Most of the time he may have a sip, then the rest just sits there and I end up throwing it out.&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">Or: We go by a bakery and he picks out 4 different items (and we still have stuff from the day before that is kinda old by now - so I don&#39;t even mention that).

Sometimes he was fine with that, sometimes he really wanted that full bowl, and sometimes either way there was still waste.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139690110">First, this isn&#39;t going to last forever. He&#39;s 3. He&#39;s curious.<br/>
<br/>
Second, for now, perhaps don&#39;t buy 4 cartons of milk that he can open. Or pour it into smaller glasses. Let him know he can have as much as he wants and that you&#39;ll keep refilling. And why are you throwing it out? Pour it back.<br/>
<br/>
Third, why are you opening new packages? Just state as a fact that you want to wait until the old is finished before you open the new one. It&#39;s *okay* if he doesn&#39;t accept that. Don&#39;t try to get him to agree. Just keep calmly stating it as fact. Offer something else. Be calm.<br/>
<br/>
*** when I look at cost it may end up being $100-150 a month for wasted food that way. ***<br/>
<br/>
Is he really opening but not eating $3-$5 worth of food *everyday*? That&#39;s sounding like you&#39;ve mentally inflated it because it bothers you. <br/>
<br/>
Also, he has no concept of money or waste. And he can&#39;t understand. But you can. You can say no gently. Again, it&#39;s okay if he doesn&#39;t agree with your value. You can offer substitutes. You can distract him with something else.<br/>
<br/>
*** Is this necessary to support him, to not feel any limits? ***<br/>
<br/>
But life does have limits. It also has limits of common sense. Don&#39;t impose artificial limits. Like letting him have one cookie when there&#39;s a dozen sitting on the counter. That&#39;s different than opening a new bag when there&#39;s an old one already opened. There isn&#39;t a learning advantage to opening a new package. (Unless there&#39;s a prize inside :-)<br/>
<br/>
*** Or is this a case for leadership and say: You can have it all. <br/>
But finish one first. Or: Only put in a little and then come back for more. ***<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re a leader then that makes him a follower.<br/>
<br/>
Be a partner. He isn&#39;t capable of understanding the effect of his choices. See the bigger picture for him. Help him explore, just in a more sensible way.<br/>
<br/>
*** I don&#39;t have as big an issue with the bakery stuff because I think <br/>
of it as junk - so if he ends up not eating all of it, yay! But with the organic<br/>
 &quot;good stuff&quot; it&#39;s way more of an issue ***<br/>
<br/>
It will get in the way of supporting him to divide what he loves into good and junk whether it be food, TV, books, activities. To him it&#39;s liked or not (yet) liked. Divide the world the same way.<br/>
<br/>
*** What about coke, coffee, alcohol? You draw a line somewhere, right? ***<br/>
<br/>
I assume you mean Coca Cola?<br/>
<br/>
Does he want Coke, coffee and alcohol?<br/>
<br/>
At 3 when you only have one it&#39;s easy to keep the stuff away. By the time you have more kids, you&#39;ll be a lot more relaxed and not need to worry so much! :-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not likely he&#39;ll like coffee. If he wants a sip, warn him it&#39;s bitter. <br/>
<br/>
Alcohol is the same. Let him have a sip if he asks. It&#39;s very likely he&#39;s not going to like the taste. And it&#39;s unlikely a little kid will like the woozy feeling.<br/>
<br/>
If he does like the taste and is intent on finishing a glass, gently take it away. Let him know since his body&#39;s small if he has too much he&#39;ll get sick. (This is true.) If it&#39;s beer he likes, have some soda for times when you&#39;re drinking beer. It might be the bubbles he likes. Maybe root beer since it has a similar foam. There are natural alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually he&#39;ll probably want Coke but there&#39;s no reason to have it around at 3. If you had older kids, he&#39;d be drinking it and you&#39;d already know it wasn&#39;t anything to worry about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183898708">&lt;&lt;My son (almost 3) wants to often open new stuff when we still have some
 of the old left. Then that spoils and I have to throw it out. I get 
irritated and angry in those situations. I am torn between trying not to
 put any limits on what foods/drinks to have and being concerned about 
wasting... Some examples: We have rice milk, oats milk, spelt milk and cow milk. 
He wants to open them all (sometimes even 2 of the same kind when there 
is an old opened one and a new one) and pour all into different glasses.
 Most of the time he may have a sip, then the rest just sits there and I
 end up throwing it out. 
<br>
 
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br><br> </span></blockquote>Buy plastic shot glasses, or tiny play tea cups, and use those.&nbsp; Don&#39;t fill them to the top.&nbsp; Make it a tea party, with cookies.&nbsp; Make it fun.&nbsp; Finish what he doesn&#39;t, if you feel like it, or throw it in a smoothie or a milkshake.&nbsp; Buy less of it, like, two different types at a time, instead of 4, if the waste bothers you to the point of being irritated and angry.<br>

<br>
 &lt;&lt;We go by a bakery and he picks out 4 different items (and we still 
have stuff from the day before that is kinda old by now - so I don&#39;t 
even mention that). We take them home and he may eat one completely, 
another a quarter and the other just a couple of bites or not at all. I 
end up throwing the rest out.&gt;&gt; 
<br><br>Let him pick two.&nbsp; If there are 4 that he wants, that&#39;s 2 today, 2 tomorrow.&nbsp; Be cheerful about it. If you know he can&#39;t finish 4 and it makes you upset with him, then don&#39;t buy him 4.&nbsp; <br>Or buy him 4.&nbsp; Or, sometimes buy him 4.&nbsp; Because it is generous and it makes him happy.&nbsp; Cut them up into small pieces and freeze things that can be frozen and reheated without being gross.<br><br>For a couple of months last year the grocery store we go to was making these awesome looking donuts, with brightly colored sugar-crystal icing, in blue, orange, and yellow. They were SO attractive!&nbsp; Every time we went, my then 3.5 yr old wanted one of each color.&nbsp; We went every few days, and every time he asked, I bought him one of each color.&nbsp; He LOVED it. He loved having the donuts, one of each color, more than he loved eating them.&nbsp; He didn&#39;t finish any of the donuts completely, I don&#39;t think.&nbsp; But they were cheap (maybe 80 cents each) and he was so happy every time, that alone was more than worth the money.&nbsp; He counted them, named the colors, arranged them into &quot;mickey mouse shape&quot; and ate some, and was happy.&nbsp; I could have been angry and irritated that he was wasting them by not eating them, but I value his joy too.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t see that as waste. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
 
If they had been more expensive, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to buy them for him as often.&nbsp; I&#39;m glad I could do that though.&nbsp; They don&#39;t make them any more, and he still talks about them.<br>

<br>
 &lt;&lt;Waste is definitely an issue for me (that&#39;s why the inner temper 
tantrum) but when I look at cost it may end up being $100-150 a month 
for wasted food that way&gt;&gt;<br><br>Then take a hundred dollars and set it aside for other learning things, like toys and games and outings and other fun stuff.&nbsp; Cut down on your grocery budget. If that much food is going to waste, and it&#39;s making you upset, then you probably don&#39;t need to buy as much as you are buying, and that money could probably be put to much better use.&nbsp; <br><br>&lt;&lt;.&nbsp; It&#39;s not the way I&#39;d like to spend my money 
but we can afford that&gt;&gt;<br><br>Feel grateful for that your abundance-- that you have the luxury to buy all kinds of different foods, and lots of it--that wasted food for your family doesn&#39;t mean someone is going hungry until pay day. <br>There&#39;s a saying, &quot;have an attitude of gratitude&quot; - it really makes a difference.&nbsp; It can help put things into better perspective. It might help you see more clearly how to cut back on what waste you can while still being generous, and it will help cut back on the energy wasted by negativity.<br><br>&lt;&lt;Is this necessary to support him, to not feel any limits? Or is this a 
case for leadership and say: You can have it all. But finish one first. 
Or: Only put in a little and then come back for more. 
<br>
 
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br><br> </span></blockquote>I think exploring the reasons why the waste upsets you might help you get clearer with yourself about what your supportive options are; and when it makes sense to set a limit, versus when you&#39;re being more of an adversary, less of a partner.&nbsp; <br><br>Help him be a responsible family member by limiting the amount of food that goes to waste.&nbsp; He can&#39;t do that. Get smaller serving dishes, use monkey platters with small amounts of each item, include things *you* will eat too, so that so much *isn&#39;t* going to waste, but he can still see a lot of food and variety in front of him, which might be what he wants.&nbsp; <br><br>My son likes to organize &#39;picnics&#39; at our living room coffee table.&nbsp; He wants to see lots of different food options, even if he isn&#39;t going to eat them.&nbsp; I have small airtight containers with lids, and I&#39;ll bring out 4 or 5 things (or he picks them) in those containers.&nbsp; He&#39;s happy to talk about them and look at them, offer them to me or his brother or his toys, and maybe eats a bit of one or two things, and then after he&#39;s done, I put the rest away.&nbsp; I know when I bring it out, most of it won&#39;t get eaten, so I plan for that, to limit the amount of food that&#39;s wasted.&nbsp; He gets excited about doing it, about seeing all the different foods.&nbsp; It&#39;s less about feeding.&nbsp; He is so happy and chatty and generous at his &#39;picnics.&#39;&nbsp; The food not being eaten is the least important or noticeable part of it. <br><br>My son also is very sensitive to food textures, and if things get even slightly stale he won&#39;t eat them.&nbsp; Some foods go stale, or change texture, after a short time, so I keep those things sealed or in air-tight containers, and pick up what he doesn&#39;t eat quickly.&nbsp; I give him those foods in small bowls, and refill it as many times as he asks.&nbsp; Other foods can sit out longer without feeling much different in your mouth (like cheerios), and those can stay out for half the day, and be stored in their box or bag.<br><br>When he wants to open a new package of something, and there is some of the old stuff left, it is usually because for him it is stale, or the texture is off.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t make him finish it before opening a new one.&nbsp; I open a new one for him, so that he can enjoy his food.&nbsp; Just like I would do for myself, if I felt like the old stuff tasted stale or off or icky.&nbsp; <br>Then I maybe buy a smaller package next time, or see if they sell it in single-serve size packs.&nbsp; Or, I just don&#39;t buy it if he isn&#39;t eating much of it lately, and no one else is really interested in it, and I find something else that appeals to him more.&nbsp; Lots and lots of possibilities and choices other than being angry about wasted food, or making him finish something he doesn&#39;t want to eat before letting him have what he wants.<br>

<br>
 &lt;&lt;&nbsp; It&#39;s getting 
better but it&#39;s still hard to totally relax around it. I swallowed hard 
the other day when he picked out cocoa puffs… gulp. I still need to 
relax more, I know.... Hah! I just noticed when I re-read my post that I don&#39;t have as big an

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518138745"><div><span style="word-spacing:normal;line-height:1.25;">What about buying foods from the bulk section at the grocery store? The place we shop at has lots of different cereals and snacks and you can buy a serving&#39;s worth at a time. That&#39;d allow for a lot more variety without as much waste as buying whole boxes that go unfinished. Glass jars keep stuff fresher longer.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Our family has been going to a Mexican bakery and some of the pastries don&#39;t look like what they taste like. Sometimes the color doesn&#39;t match the flavor, or it&#39;s not as sweet at it looks. We&#39;ve gone with a &quot;pick one you know you like and one that looks interesting&quot; strategy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As far as opening two of the same kind of milk -- to avoid the problem, can you keep the unopened one out of sight until the first one is finished? &nbsp;I&#39;m thinking top shelf of the fridge, in the back.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Michelle&nbsp;</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-157596600"><div dir="ltr"><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">Thank you everyone for your suggestions and input. </span></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;">I feel so much more relaxed about the issue. I had it in my head that unless I have a justifiable reason to say no, I should say yes. Since we can afford the waste, I had no reason to say no. I thought if I said no then I would in some way make him feel limited, powerless, controlled etc. But saying yes, pick 2 and then we come back for more if you want more, feels so much better. At the same time, I seem more ok with some of the waste. Maybe because I feel freer to say no if needed.</span></div>

Be gentle.&quot;</font></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif">Duh! I&#39;m saying now. But it did not occur to me. Like &#39;if I am going to say No I need to be firm/annoyed. If I&#39;m all calm and gentle then I could actually just give it to him. Obviously it&#39;s not bothering me.&#39; Not sure if I&#39;m making sense but by now it&#39;s just a mystery to me that it didn&#39;t occur to me. Like calm and gentle when someone else said no or the store is closed etc. no problem but if I&#39;m imposing then it&#39;s different. </font></div>

<div><font face="arial, sans-serif">It seems like I have such a long way to go there. I did some more reading, followed some links. But this is turning my world upside down. I feel some resistance there. Like: It can&#39;t all be wrong what has been found. I read one article about sugar rush and how it&#39;s a myth. It&#39;s mind-boggling to me. But I&#39;ll keep reading… </font></div>


<div><br></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif">And two more suggestions I found really helpful:</font></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif">To him it&#39;s liked or not (yet) liked. Divide the world the same way. (Joyce about junk vs. organic) I definitely have to work on that but I can already tell how that will make a difference.<br>


</font></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif">See his joy (Lisa). I saw that today. What a difference in attitude.</font></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif">And thank you for all the other suggestions like buying tiny dishes, getting smaller sizes, buy in the bulk section, and definitely that it&#39;s temporary! </font></div>



<div><font face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;">Your responses made a difference!</span><br></div><div><font face="arial, sans-serif">Christine </font></div></div></div>
