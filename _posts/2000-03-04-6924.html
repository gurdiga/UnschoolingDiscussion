<div id="ygrps-yiv-924831937">i&#39;m not at all offended. Â  if i remember/understand it right, from<br/>
sus&#39;s other post, her &#39;mother&#39; doesn&#39;t really act like a mother so why<br/>
bestow that title on her. it appears to me sus just giving her &#39;mother&#39;<br/>
the title that best fits her actions and the role her &#39;mother&#39; has<br/>
chosen. at least that&#39;s how i interpreted it:)<br/>

Thanks, Susan. I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself.  And to those who<br/>
were offended  by &quot;the title&quot; , I apologize.  I don&#39;t want to offend<br/>
anyone, as a matter of fact, I&#39;d like to feel like I have some friends<br/>
out there, somewhere.This has been a very stressful time, and I tend to<br/>
get a little lonely.<br/>
Thanks to all who  offered advice  and words of encouragment.  It&#39;s nice<br/>
to know that I&#39;m not the only mother in the world who has a child who<br/>
spins in circles when he&#39;s tired !! I&#39;m just gonna try to relax and let<br/>
my boy be a boy, even if that means letting him bounce off the walls !!<br/>
