<div id="ygrps-yiv-1461542875">No, NO.....I am not asking for a definition.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have homeschooled for two years.  Started out with structure and soon went <br/>
straight to unschooling.  So I know what unschooling is.<br/>
<br/>
My question is regarding my daughter (age 11).  She is approaching middle <br/>
school age.  She has requested to take Spanish at the middle school.  She <br/>
also is looking for a math and science curricullum.  She is the one who is <br/>
requesting this and I am helping her find what she wants.  (Her dad asked <br/>
her, joking, what about history and she stated she didn&#39;t want a <br/>
curricullum...she would rather read fun books&lt;g&gt;).   I have pretty much left <br/>
her education choices up to her.  She is the one asking for the curricullum.  <br/>
But now I feel kinda weird saying we are unschoolers?  In my mind, we <br/>
are...she is doing what she wants.  If that leads to structure...thats her <br/>
choice.  does this make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Would you all consider her still an unschooler?  <br/>

Christina - first - if she is asking for stuff, let her have it.  BUT my <br/>
other recommendation would be this:  There are some FUN science books out <br/>
there that aren&#39;t curricula.  They aren&#39;t dry texts either.  Get her some <br/>
biographies of great scientists.  Get her a chemistry set and some Science <br/>
Crafts for Kids books.  She probably has it in her head that Science can&#39;t be <br/>
learned from &quot;just reading&quot;.  If she STILL wants to find a curriculum, great <br/>
- at least she knows it can still be &quot;fun&quot;.  <br/>

OH, I am definantly letting her have the materials.  Like I said, I just <br/>
follow her lead:-)<br/>
<br/>
Great ideas on the Science.  I think that is the direction she wants to <br/>
go......<br/>
<br/>
THANKS<br/>

wants to do it. i would suggest showing her other options about how to<br/>
learn what she wants to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811312880">Yes, what you are saying makes sense... it is a little weird.  But I have<br/>
one child that is very methodical, about everything, not just learning.<br/>
Okay, not about picking up her clothes either, but almost everything.   I<br/>
find her way agonizing, I&#39;d rather move from experience to experience, from<br/>
one tool to another.<br/>
<br/>
I have also seen this over and over in 11-12 year olds. It&#39;s like they are<br/>
getting their ducks in a row because so much else is changing and<br/>
unfamiliar.  They want something to be nice and orderly and consistent,<br/>
because their bodies and thoughts sure aren&#39;t.  :)<br/>

Lisa,<br/>
  this sounds like my 11yo, too!!! She also says she needs more space from <br/>
me,and along with more independence, more responsibilities(but only the <br/>
responsibilities _she_ wants!!!).  She also seems to need more time with <br/>
friends. We live in a semi-rural area and have to drive everywhere, so we try <br/>
to combine visits with errands etc. My dd seems to have finally found a <br/>
group--Girl Scouts wasn&#39;t her thing, but 4H seems to be. We are part of a <br/>
home school 4H group and there are lots of 11-14yo girls.<br/>
  Sarah now wants to do more structured things, especially math related <br/>
things. She&#39;s chosen and is working on the Key To:... math books.  She also <br/>
asks me to write paragraphs with lots of errors that she can correct. Both my <br/>
kids like Mad-Libs, too.<br/>
 I would be lying if I said I don&#39;t get anxious at times--but that anxiety <br/>
usually has more to do with me,than with what my kids are doing or learning. <br/>
And whenever I&#39;d pulled out the &quot;anxious mom school at home costume&quot; we were <br/>
all miserable.<br/>
