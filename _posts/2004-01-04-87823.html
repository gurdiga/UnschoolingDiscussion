<div id="ygrps-yiv-510946361">I like the digest version myself, I can just scroll through and read.  The <br/>
only downside, response time from me can be slow.  Still, digest is worth the <br/>
read vs. filling my email box.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143944875">I sort by subject, scroll down to the bottom, delete the spam, check if there <br/>
is any other kind of mail from less busy lists, read those, close my mailbox, <br/>
reopen, sort by subject to check for more spam, then sort by oldest first and <br/>
read straight through.<br/>
<br/>
But now I&#39;m going to no mail for at least a few days so I can take care of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That would be even more efficient if you filtered your mail into a separate <br/>
mailbox for each list. Both Eudora and Outlook Express will do that, <br/>
probably others as well.<br/>
