&gt; test might be to ask if you&#39;re treating their use of it the same as you<br/>

&gt; invested in them using the mainstream educational methods, and using<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them in the  &quot;right&quot; way?<br/>
<br/>
To tell you the truth, I have nothing invested in textbooks. They were<br/>
all given to me, and I don&#39;t know that I would exert any great effort to<br/>
search them out and buy them if they weren&#39;t. I do pick up different<br/>
workbooks here and there because they look like something that may at<br/>
sometime be interesting to my children, but they are always free to say<br/>
&quot;no&quot;. I keep the workbooks in the same area as I do coloring books, arts<br/>
and crafts scraps, play dough, you name it. But I have to admit, I do<br/>
cringe when my 3yo takes a brand new workbook and colors pictures all<br/>
over it. I literally have to turn my back, but I don&#39;t stop her. But I<br/>
can&#39;t stop from feeling it&#39;s a waste, and not &quot;proper use&quot;. Is there any<br/>
hope for me???<br/>

&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; doing anything that resembles learning in school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I mean is a lack of motivation to make decisions. Maybe motivation<br/>
is the wrong term. She has a very hard time making decisions. Everything<br/>
from selecting what color vitamin to take, to what clothes to wear, to<br/>
what she should be doing with her time. After much reflection on the<br/>
posts yesterday, I think the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree. I<br/>
myself have a hard time making decisions. I analyze, weigh, seek<br/>
approval, and take many precautions before making a move. For this<br/>
reason, I don&#39;t tend to get a lot done in a timely manner, but when<br/>
things are done, they are usually correct. I was never forced to make my<br/>
own decisions. There was always someone, whether it be parents, teachers,<br/>
friends, ready to make decisions for me. I guess if I want my children to<br/>
know it is ok to make their own decisions, without having to concern<br/>
themselves with acceptance, the possibility of making mistakes, and such,<br/>
I better improve at it myself. I guess whatever mistakes I make with my<br/>
children can&#39;t possibly screw them up nearly as much as the stifling of<br/>
the spirit perpetuated by schools.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This trust thing is a problem. I know in my heart that it is what&#39;s<br/>
needed, just can&#39;t seem to let go of the &quot;what-ifs&quot;.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I think embracing that goal is key to getting unschooling and <br/>
&gt; getting it to<br/>
&gt; work. If we expect the kids to progress in a particular direction,<br/>
&gt; unschooling will be frustrating -- and obviously not work! It&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; designed<br/>
&gt; to do that!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t expect my children to progress in any particular direction. I<br/>
don&#39;t concern myself with their educational capabilities ie: reading,<br/>
writing, arithmetic. I am sure that will all come in time when they are<br/>
ready. I am more concerned about there emotional well-being, and want<br/>
them to thrive and be able to find there own happiness in life, without<br/>
them feeling like I deprived them of something in childhood. Thanks for<br/>
the insight.<br/>

I think it just takes time being around natural learning.  After a dozen <br/>
instances when your kids show you something amazing they&#39;ve learned when you <br/>
didn&#39;t know they were, you&#39;ll stop worrying.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to show my kids Roman numerals one day.  For some reason I had come <br/>
across something at the house with Roman numerals, and I know Marty&#39;s <br/>
interested in all things mathish, so I called them over and said &quot;Hey, I want <br/>
to show you something real cool,&quot; and in a column I started writing some <br/>
numbers, like <br/>
i <br/>
iv<br/>
vi<br/>
x...<br/>
<br/>
and Marty (who was nine, I think, maybe) pointed at the vi and said &quot;That&#39;s a <br/>
six.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was deflated.  I wasn&#39;t going to get to see the spark come on in Marty&#39;s <br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How did you know that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mega Man.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I was never forced to make my<br/>
own decisions. There was always someone, whether it be parents, teachers,<br/>
friends, ready to make decisions for me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WHOA!!!  Don&#39;t go there.<br/>
Don&#39;t blame others for not having made you do something.<br/>
Maybe it just IS genetic, and you&#39;re getting along okay.  You&#39;re employed and <br/>
you reproduced.<br/>
<br/>
A Canadian university did a big study of twins separated at birth.  Two grown <br/>
men who organized their desks and closes almost exactly the same was as the <br/>
other twin, VERY meticulous organizers, were asked why they thought they were <br/>
so fastidiously neat (i.e. anal, but they didn&#39;t ask it that way).   One said <br/>
because his mother was a slob and he never wanted to be that disorganized and <br/>
the other said because luckily his mother had taught him to be neat.<br/>
<br/>
They were putting their clothes in the same kind of order.  They were putting <br/>
their staplers in the same place.<br/>
<br/>
Their mothers had nothing to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess if I want my children to<br/>
know it is ok to make their own decisions, without having to concern<br/>
themselves with acceptance, the possibility of making mistakes, and such,<br/>
I better improve at it myself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you can just say &quot;It&#39;s okay to be slow to  make decisions.  I&#39;m that <br/>
way too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They probably don&#39;t mind at ALL wanting to be more like you.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This trust thing is a problem. I know in my heart that it is what&#39;s<br/>
needed, just can&#39;t seem to let go of the &quot;what-ifs&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But trust is earned.  And when you see natural learning working, you&#39;ll come <br/>
to trust it.<br/>
