&gt; I&#39;m wondering about what to do with Abby, as far as reading<br/>
&gt; goes...she seems like she wants to read, but she hates it when I<br/>
&gt; try to instruct her.  She gets upset and starts drifting.  But, on her<br/>
&gt; own, she&#39;ll write down letters and ask me what they say.  Her<br/>
&gt; favorite thing to write is &quot;I love u&quot;.  Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Just keep on answering her questions! She&#39;s working it out; she&#39;ll let you<br/>
know what she needs from you. Keep on reading to her, and take your cues<br/>
from her, and she&#39;ll do fine.<br/>

letters and washable markers and a white board and tons of paper to practice <br/>
on and sometimes the sandbox with a stick is great too.  She soudns like <br/>
she&#39;s doing great!<br/>
