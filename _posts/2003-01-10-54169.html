&lt;&lt; I have been told by 3 different dentists that there is almost no<br/>
 reason to fill a baby tooth - though pediatric dentists make a<br/>
 killing doing it.  I do believe I would get a second opinion,<br/>
 given that these baby teeth are about to go by the wayside<br/>
 anyway.  As to how to deal with a cavity prone kid with bad<br/>
 dental hygiene, dunno - except to suspect that there is a<br/>
 relationship between the prior dental pressure and treatment and<br/>
 current resistance. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree completely with this.<br/>
I would have my child swish with some diluted hydrogen peroxide every few <br/>
days rather than worry about filling baby teeth.<br/>
Unless it&#39;s extremely rotten, a cavity is not going to hurt the tooth coming <br/>
in.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
