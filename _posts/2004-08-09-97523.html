<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731519641">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think the<br/>
factory farming, the pollutants from the food industry<br/>
and other industries, the destruction of the<br/>
rainforest for beef production to name a few things<br/>
are an exaggeration.  Why do you feel they are.<br/>
I think scare tactic ecology is loaded terminology<br/>
that was referred to in the list rules Pam just sent<br/>
to the list.  ....But there is still the core truth of the<br/>
way the planet is being destroyed in so many ways by<br/>
so many people.  It is not scare tactic ecology. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe &quot;destroy the earth&quot; is a phrase that is unnecessarily big and scary<br/>
for a kid to be having in the forefront of his mind, especially if it makes<br/>
him feel powerless and small.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unnecessarily big for adults.   But it&#39;s not new at all.<br/>
<br/>
Came across this yesterday and laughed:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Throughout recorded history, human beings have looked around at the world <br/>
and exclaimed, &quot;Everything is falling apart!&quot;  And they have always been wrong.  <br/>
The sun rose in the morning, and there was a world.  Maybe not the greatest <br/>
world, but a world. Still, that nagging human sense remains:  things are <br/>
getting bad, and they can only get worse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s from the literature section of a book called Condensed Knowledge, by the <br/>
editors of &quot;Mental_floss.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Hermann Kahn, the brilliant futurist, understood this well. In his last work of prescience <br/>
(The Coming Boom, 1982), Kahn foresaw our current predicament. &quot;The question <br/>
remains,&quot; he wrote then, &quot;whether President Reagan -- and ultimately his successors -- <br/>
can maintain and build on the opportunities of the present.&quot; To do so, he predicted, it <br/>
would be &quot;important to the coming boom to reestablish an ideology of progress&quot; which <br/>
would &quot;do as much to hasten the coming boom and give it staying power as any single <br/>
policy maneuver can.&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pff.org/publications/ecommerce/">http://www.pff.org/publications/ecommerce/</a><br/>

<br/>
Part of his viewpoint is that many people look at &quot;change&quot; as bad, while &quot;progress&quot; implies <br/>
change that is good or productive. Even reframing the discussion to how we can <br/>
&quot;progress&quot; creates energy and optimism which then fuels the kind of change we need.<br/>
<br/>
He also espoused the idea that technology is responsible for solving the problems it <br/>
creates and often inspires solutions that contribute to boom. He doesn&#39;t shrink from the <br/>
problems technology creates, but he stands in warm relief against the &quot;limits to growth&quot; <br/>
model that is oriented toward predictions of doom and offers conservation as the only <br/>
option for preservation of our way of life.<br/>
