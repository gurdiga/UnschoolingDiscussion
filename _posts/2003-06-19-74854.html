concious she goes straight for the nose!! I think the boogers are a side <br/>
benefit!!<br/>
I read in the book Skin, the Criticial Importance of Touching( I am not <br/>
positive of title)<br/>
that it is believed that the reason people pick noses is that when nursing <br/>
the nose is against the breast and stimulated, so the picking and poking of the <br/>
nose is comforting and an attempt at creating that breasty feeling. Makes <br/>
sense to me and sounds kind of nice when faced with a nose picker. <br/>
When I worked in daycare we just gently suggested they might need a kleenex <br/>
or to find a quiet place. It seemed to work. The little guffers seem to just <br/>
forget they are with people and get right down to a good pick.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy in BC, now has a kid that is a picker.<br/>
