Our dollar store had a variety of plastic swords with scabbards that you can <br/>
loop a belt through.  Getting a few is nice so that siblings, friends and <br/>
parents can play, too.  I spend many days with a bandanna over my hair, one hoop <br/>
earring in, and a sword stuck in my belt loop, fighting off sea monsters in <br/>
between loads of laundry.  Aye and avast!<br/>
    <br/>
And by the way, what&#39;s the Redbeard connection?  (I just Googled it and found <br/>
out that Redbeard refers to Khair ad Din, a Muslim privateer in the early <br/>
1500s who had a big part in making the Ottoman Empire.)  Sounds cool.<br/>
<br/>
Glad things are going so much better.  I&#39;m curious -- when you say Social <br/>
Services is offering to have someone come in once a week -- is this someone they <br/>
pay for, or someone that works for them (a social worker?) or how does that <br/>
work?  Just wondering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106125777">Hmmm that would be a good idea too...<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not certain of the &quot;Redbeard&quot; connection. Paul says that there was a pirate known by that appelation who &quot;hung out&quot; on the Cape Fear River in North Carolina, and that there is a family connection...it could just be legend. I have no idea if it&#39;s documented or not.<br/>
 <br/>
The connection to Fireball Roberts though is documented.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924296295">Our (NC&#39;s) pirate is Blackbeard.  He&#39;s thought to have started around<br/>
1713, and continued his pirating until he was killed in a battle at<br/>
Ocracoke Inlet on November 22, 1718.  <br/>
<br/>
Redbeard--Khayr ad-Din (known as the pirate &#39;Redbeard&#39; and as<br/>
&#39;Barabossa&#39; to Europeans), with his brother Andruj,  expelled the<br/>
Spanish and gained control of Algiers for the Ottoman sultan Khalif in<br/>
1529.<br/>
