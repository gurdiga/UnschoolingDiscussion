Maybe &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Shakespeare might or might not have cared. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
If he had google he would have known EVERYTHING.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to do google either because I was afraid SO much cool stuff <br/>
would come up I wouldn&#39;t make it to the grocery store and to finish making <br/>
cookies and to Kinko&#39;s to make extra copies of music for a rehearsal <br/>
tonight...<br/>
<br/>
Funny that I&#39;d avoid learning something because it might be TOO much fun!! <br/>
Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
And right now I was online to order some more reading glasses, and the boys <br/>
want their phone line back, darn it.<br/>
<br/>
Off to make food...<br/>

of course in new orleans it&#39;s hard to tell a party season from a non party season.. but at least there were king cakes at the mardi gras season parties.. which of course multiplied the closer mardi gras got.. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139145919">One of the sad losses with government schools is the loss of<br/>
common culture to understand so many references, like &quot;twelfth<br/>
night.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Catholic Church - and following on it, some other<br/>
denominations - keep a calendar through the year, a calendar of<br/>
seasons and events.  The first day of the new church year is the<br/>
first Sunday of Advent, which is the 4th Sunday before Christmas.<br/>
Advent is a season of prayerful preparation, like a mini-Lent.<br/>
The third Sunday in Advent is called Gaudete Sunday, BTW.<br/>
Christmas Vigil is December 24; the feast of Christmas, December<br/>
25.  The next 12 days are a celebration of the feast of<br/>
Christmas.  There are several Saint&#39;s days scattered into the<br/>
season and some cultural events, such as boxing day in England (a<br/>
gift giving day 12/26).  The Twelfth Day of Christmas is the<br/>
Feast of the Epiphany, or arrival of the three wise men/kings.<br/>
Depending on where you are, Epiphany is either a season that<br/>
lasts until Lent or an event followed by a season called<br/>
&quot;ordinary time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Lent, called the slow fast, is the great penitential season of<br/>
the Church.  Various sacrifices and observances have been<br/>
commonly employed to mark the season.  Shrove Tuesday/Mardis Gras<br/>
refer to the same day - the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, marking<br/>
the last unfettered day before the fast.  Shrove relates to<br/>
shriven, which is a term for being granted absolution after a<br/>
sacramental confession.  In preparation for Lent folks would<br/>
receive the sacrament of Penance in order to observe  a worthy<br/>
Lent.  Fat Tuesday (English translation of Mardis Gras) refers to<br/>
the need to get rid of all the eggs, butter, meat and yummy stuff<br/>
before Lent - think pancake suppers with bacon and sausage in<br/>
many places.  As a secular matter the dead of winter (as in<br/>
Jan/Feb) works well for a social season - there&#39;s not a heck of a<br/>
lot else you can do, and the Church had no great events to<br/>
preclude extending the preparation for Lent all the way back to<br/>
Epiphany,<br/>
<br/>
Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, is celebrated as a day of<br/>
fasting, with members of many denominations wearing ashes on<br/>
their foreheads as a sign of penance.  The ashes are prepared<br/>
from the palms used the year before on Palm Sunday.  Lent<br/>
continues for 40 days, culminating in Holy Week.  Holy Week<br/>
starts with Palm Sunday, commemorating the entrance of Jesus into<br/>
Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover.  You hang out then until<br/>
Thursday, which is the beginning of the Tridiuum (3 days - kinda<br/>
catchy, huh?).  Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday/Gruendonnerstag)<br/>
celebrates the institution of the Eucharist and is usually<br/>
celebrated with the symbolic washing of feet as Jesus washed the<br/>
disciples&#39; feet.  New holy oils are consecrated for the year;<br/>
frequently some step in the reception of new members to the<br/>
church is taken then.  The traditional name of Maundy comes from<br/>
&quot;commandment&quot; or mandatum in the Latin - the new commandment of<br/>
love, given at the Last Supper.<br/>
<br/>
Good Friday I think remains pretty well understood culturally;<br/>
the suspension between words that is Holy Saturday has no bearing<br/>
on those who are not churched.  Easter similarly is easy, but<br/>
perhaps the &quot;Octave&quot; is not.  Easter is celebrated for 8 days<br/>
after the Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
... and the year continues.  For many years the only source of<br/>
calendar or of terms was the Church.  Without context, you miss a<br/>
huge amount of the richness of our literature and art. ... not to<br/>
mention practical housekeeping.  The first Sunday of Advent is<br/>
called &quot;Stir up Sunday&quot; as in &quot;Stir up you power, Oh Lord&quot; and<br/>
was how a housewife kept count that it was time to stir up the<br/>
Christmas dishes that required long seasoning, like fruit cakes.<br/>
Fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>

I think the business of government schools *is* common culture. Common<br/>
*American* culture -- which partly (or largely?) consists of a common<br/>
denominator that most people could relate to. &quot;Everyone&quot; (ie, the majority<br/>
that counted) celebrated Christmas on Christmas day. So culturally<br/>
(recognized by schools, government, business, media) Americans celebrate one<br/>
day of Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
I think the media plays an even bigger part in passing on a common culture<br/>
than schools do. My childhood Christmases were pretty much like Norman<br/>
Rockwell and Charlie Brown and the sitcom families on TV. Not, I think,<br/>
because my parents tried to copy those specific images, but because those<br/>
and others showed us how Americans celebrated Christmas. There were cultural<br/>
and family variations, but the media gave us the foundation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116269263">I think that because the subject was a Christian reference, you<br/>
assumed more than I was saying.<br/>
<br/>
To me an important aspect of understanding any culture is<br/>
understanding its religion - and if you value cultural<br/>
competence, you will pursue some degree of knowledge about the<br/>
prevalent faiths.  The idea that separation of church and state<br/>
eliminates religion as an intellectual topic is a very common<br/>
mistake in government schools.<br/>
<br/>
Our common culture is filled with many faiths and most are more<br/>
complex than the screen shots and sound bites, though that<br/>
superficial level is also part of the common culture.   While I<br/>
have a particular faith, I also make sure that I am aware of the<br/>
major aspects of other faiths that I encounter and that the kids<br/>
are exposed to culture of those faiths.  ...Of course the 5 y.o.<br/>

But if in the U.S. the curriculum included comparative religion, many of the <br/>

<br/>
And the law that gives them freedom of religion outweighs any law or <br/>
principle about what kids get to learn in school.<br/>
<br/>
So a Catholic teacher can&#39;t be made to pretend even for a minute that other <br/>
religions are legitimate paths to truth and heaven.  It can&#39;t be a <br/>
requirement of one&#39;s job to make a speech to impressionable children that <br/>
says it&#39;s as good to be a pagan as to be Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
Some sanitization is required unless robots become the teachers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282349784">To the extent that culture is understood to include the culture<br/>
of various religions and to the extent that religion is banned in<br/>
government schools under the rubric of separation of church and<br/>
state (bonus points if you know the religious basis of &quot;rubric&quot;),<br/>
anything has to be better.<br/>
<br/>
More seriously, yes I think there has been a decline in our<br/>
attention to learning common culture, that is facilely handled by<br/>
dismissing religion from school, but that actually is defeatism<br/>
about whether it is possible to become passingly familiar with<br/>
the different faiths that are regular parts of our experience in<br/>
today&#39;s world.  Passingly familiar enough to laugh at the moyel<br/>
line in Arafat converts to Judaism joke.  Passingly familiar<br/>
enough to understand the source of the outrage when the Taliban<br/>
destroyed the giant Buddahs.<br/>
<br/>
Because we have so institutionalized education through government<br/>
schools that the core, required knowledge for teachers is how to<br/>
teach rather than what to teach, we are where Sandra posited -<br/>
bereft of teachers who can hold to one set of beliefs and<br/>
respectfully explain others.  Government schools with their<br/>
emphasis on producing the product of a high school graduate drive<br/>
that institutional requirement by their pervasiveness.  IMHO, as<br/>
always, LOL.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m still not sure at what point in time you&#39;re comparing today&#39;s education<br/>
to. When has a &quot;well read&quot; type of education ever been imposed on the<br/>
masses? (Let alone successfully imposed.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Government schools with their<br/>
&gt; emphasis on producing the product of a high school graduate drive<br/>
&gt; that institutional requirement by their pervasiveness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s what parents (as a mass) want. Most parents see the purpose of<br/>
education as providing a foundation for a stable career that will provide<br/>
their children with security. Mass education isn&#39;t for understanding the<br/>
world. It&#39;s to get a good job. It&#39;s one of the reasons why innovative<br/>
schools aren&#39;t spreading like wild fire. Only a few parents want them. Most<br/>
parents are scared for their children&#39;s futures. They want guarantees. They<br/>
want to see results that are leading to a specific destination. They want<br/>
phonics. And drill work. And homework. And memorization.<br/>
<br/>
Education of the past was for different purposes. It wasn&#39;t one size fits<br/>
all. (Nor should it be.) The cultural education you&#39;re refering to was only<br/>
for the elite who were training for their place in society where they might<br/>
encounter the equivalent of the &quot;moyel line in Arafat converts to Judaism<br/>
joke.&quot; They were training for careers that would employ knowledge like that<br/>
(at least in the social end of their careers) like lawyer or banker or owner<br/>
of a company. So for them it was, to an extent, practical knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Others were learning for specific careers like bookkeeping or blacksmithing.<br/>
If they learned about their culture it was from living life not from their<br/>
schooling (which might have been on the job training). (And their culture<br/>
extended no further than English and Protestant so there wasn&#39;t nearly as<br/>
much to learn.) They wouldn&#39;t have needed to understand the &quot;moyel line&quot;<br/>
because no one else in their social class would have understood it.<br/>
<br/>
And then there was everyone else from the great unwashed illiterate masses<br/>
to those who had the leisure to dabble in cultural literacy.<br/>
<br/>
Except for those who actually do need it in their careers, an education that<br/>
has the leisure to focus on impractical social and cultural knowledge is for<br/>
the elite who don&#39;t have to worry about competing for a good job and<br/>
supporting themselves.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;posit&quot; it in the way that I propose or suggest.  I&#39;m stating <br/>
practical facts.<br/>
<br/>
Telling someone WHAT to teach, if it goes against their religion, goes <br/>
against their rights as Americans.   Telling them they HAVE to respectfvully <br/>
explain a religion which they consider to be of Satan and leading to Hell <br/>
would 1) cause them to go against what they think God wants, and 2) cause a <br/>
TON of hypocricy and sarcasm in classes which kids would pick up on.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather a child hear nothing than to get totally wrong information.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the school&#39;s duty to tell children about their own or anyone else&#39;s <br/>
religion.  Not in the U.S.  There is NO POSSIBLE WAY it would be done in any <br/>
balanced way, because people are people, and many of them are religious <br/>
people.  And how would a skeptic or a fundamentalist Moslem or a wounded <br/>
survivor describe Christianity?  You probably wouldn&#39;t want them to do it to <br/>
YOUR child.<br/>
