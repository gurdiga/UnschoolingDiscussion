<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683874797">I was looking into a class that 10yod was interested in.  I asked the<br/>
instructor if parents were allowed to sit in on the class.  She said she&#39;d<br/>
never been asked that before.  She was concerned that it would alter the<br/>
spontaneity for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
It really bugs me that her first response is that it&#39;s a bad idea for<br/>
parents to be involved in a class with their kids.<br/>

they like having me there.  Second I don&#39;t trust people who would object to <br/>
have parents there.  That is a problem with a lot of classes.  And so often <br/>
class type of things aren&#39;t separated by ability or interest they are <br/>
separated by age or &quot;grade&quot;.  My boys love to do things together.  And the <br/>
age difference always puts them in separate groups so they don&#39;t want to <br/>
attend.<br/>
