Games, not school, are teaching kids to think. <br/>
By James Paul Gee <br/>
  <br/>
The US spends almost $50 billion each year on education, so why <br/>
aren&#39;t kids learning? Forty percent of students lack basic reading <br/>
skills, and their academic performance is dismal compared with that <br/>
of their foreign counterparts. In response to this crisis, schools <br/>
are skilling-and-drilling their way &quot;back to basics,&quot; moving toward <br/>
mechanical instruction methods that rely on line-by-line scripting <br/>
for teachers and endless multiple-choice testing. Consequently, kids <br/>
aren&#39;t learning how to think anymore - they&#39;re learning how to <br/>
memorize. This might be an ideal recipe for the future Babbitts of <br/>
the world, but it won&#39;t produce the kind of agile, analytical minds <br/>
that will lead the high tech global age. Fortunately, we&#39;ve got Grand <br/>
Theft Auto: Vice City and Deus X for that. <br/>
  <br/>
After school, kids are devouring new information, concepts, and <br/>
skills every day, and, like it or not, they&#39;re doing it controller in <br/>
hand, plastered to the TV. The fact is, when kids play videogames <br/>
they can experience a much more powerful form of learning than when <br/>
they&#39;re in the classroom. Learning isn&#39;t about memorizing isolated <br/>
facts. It&#39;s about connecting and manipulating them. Doubt it? Just <br/>
ask anyone who&#39;s beaten Legend of Zelda or solved Morrowind. <br/>
  <br/>
The phenomenon of the videogame as an agent of mental training is <br/>
largely unstudied; more often, games are denigrated for being violent <br/>
or they&#39;re just plain ignored. They shouldn&#39;t be. Young gamers today <br/>
aren&#39;t training to be gun-toting carjackers. They&#39;re learning how to <br/>
learn. In Pikmin, children manage an army of plantlike aliens and <br/>
strategize to solve problems. In Metal Gear Solid 2, players move <br/>
stealthily through virtual environments and carry out intricate <br/>
missions. Even in the notorious Vice City, players craft a persona, <br/>
build a history, and shape a virtual world. In strategy games like <br/>
WarCraft III and Age of Mythology, they learn to micromanage an array <br/>
of elements while simultaneously balancing short- and long-term <br/>
goals. That sounds like something for their résumés. <br/>
  <br/>
The secret of a videogame as a teaching machine isn&#39;t its immersive 3-<br/>
D graphics, but its underlying architecture. Each level dances around <br/>
the outer limits of the player&#39;s abilities, seeking at every point to <br/>
be hard enough to be just doable. In cognitive science, this is <br/>
referred to as the regime of competence principle, which results in a <br/>
feeling of simultaneous pleasure and frustration - a sensation as <br/>
familiar to gamers as sore thumbs. Cognitive scientist Andy diSessa <br/>
has argued that the best instruction hovers at the boundary of a <br/>
student&#39;s competence. Most schools, however, seek to avoid invoking <br/>
feelings of both pleasure and frustration, blind to the fact that <br/>
these emotions can be extremely useful when it comes to teaching <br/>
kids. <br/>
  <br/>
Also, good videogames incorporate the principle of expertise. They <br/>
tend to encourage players to achieve total mastery of one level, only <br/>
to challenge and undo that mastery in the next, forcing kids to adapt <br/>
and evolve. This carefully choreographed dialectic has been <br/>
identified by learning theorists as the best way to achieve expertise <br/>
in any field. This doesn&#39;t happen much in our routine-driven schools, <br/>
where &quot;good&quot; students are often just good at &quot;doing school.&quot; <br/>
  <br/>
How did videogames become such successful models of effective <br/>
learning? Game coders aren&#39;t trained as cognitive scientists. It&#39;s a <br/>
simple case of free-market economics: If a title doesn&#39;t teach <br/>
players how to play it well, it won&#39;t sell well. Game companies don&#39;t <br/>
rake in $6.9 billion a year by dumbing down the material - <br/>
aficionados condemn short and easy games like Half Life: Blue Shift <br/>
and Devil May Cry 2. Designers respond by making harder and more <br/>
complex games that require mastery of sophisticated worlds and as <br/>
many as 50 to 100 hours to complete. Schools, meanwhile, respond with <br/>
more tests, more drills, and more rigidity. They&#39;re in the cognitive-<br/>
science dark ages. <br/>
  <br/>
We don&#39;t often think about videogames as relevant to education <br/>
reform, but maybe we should. Game designers don&#39;t often think of <br/>
themselves as learning theorists. Maybe they should. Kids often say <br/>
it doesn&#39;t feel like learning when they&#39;re gaming - they&#39;re much too <br/>
focused on playing. If kids were to say that about a science lesson, <br/>
our country&#39;s education problems would be solved. <br/>

You can&#39;t teach a tree to grow.  You can discourage or prevent it.<br/>
And the nature of our culture and of school, I think, especially, discourage <br/>
and prevent thinking without consciously intending to.  So they end up with <br/>
bunch of stunted and deformed trees and would like to figure out a way to <br/>
teach them to grow.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve seen trees planted in perfect places for them grow HUGELY strong and <br/>
big, and I&#39;d rather see my kid planted in front of Nintendo with his roots in <br/>
the sewer getting all that rich detritus of life without even thinking about <br/>
it than to see him lined up and told not to talk, not to play, not to draw <br/>
pictures, not to write notes to his friends, put that comic book away, don&#39;t <br/>
look out the window, check your answers, don&#39;t drum your fingers, stop <br/>
playing with your pencil, don&#39;t tap your foot, blah-blah-blah, bl<br/>

on the heating pad, or ice bag, or in the tub..<br/>
She&#39;s been watching tons of TV.; playing the game boy, watching Bey Blade and some other shows like that, many, many cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s ok.<br/>
I really do.<br/>
I think.<br/>
I want her to read - something.....<br/>
