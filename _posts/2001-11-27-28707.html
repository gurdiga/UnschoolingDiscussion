<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713733862">my response:<br/>
my children are ages 15.5  and almost 11 (December). Both girls. Oldest wants to become a doctor. Youngest wants to be a rock star (seriously!). She talks of nothing else and hasn&#39;t for years. <br/>
I believe I understand what&#39;s expected especially of the doctor one, moreso than the rockstar one. I&#39;ve researched all the &quot;how to become a doctor&quot; and books written by doctors, as well as interviewed several doctor/friends  and they all basically come away with the same thing... it&#39;s important to stand out in your 4 yr college as the best at *whatever* your major(and that can be anything, including a dancer!)  and secondly, it helps if that major is in the sciences.  So, to that end, I consider myself capable of telling my child what she needs to do now in order to get to point &quot;b&quot;. In the context of what technology will be available then, I have no way of forseeing that, either and don&#39;t pretend to. We&#39;re talking different wave lengths here, I think, Susan.<br/>

when he father went to school the nuns back in Ireland all told him they<br/>
were preparing him for what lay ahead... and then the Great War started<br/>
and he came to the United States and everything was different, and the<br/>
nuns hadn&#39;t prepared him for any of it...<br/>
<br/>
We never know. Mostly, I find value in being able to adapt and learn, and<br/>
if Cacie can do that I&#39;ve sure she&#39;ll be fine.<br/>

She&#39;s done her own research and also read the same books I read. Further, she&#39;s shadowed several doctors in surgery at our local teaching hospital (Bowman Gray School of Medicine in NC). She&#39;s worked with children in a physical therapy type setting. She&#39;s teaching herself Anatomy & Physiology from a college reference book. <br/>

While she was teaching gymnastics (her parttime job consisting of 8 hrs a week), I went to borders and bought the books for us to read. I also made the phone call for her to shadow the doctors around. Heck, I even *drove* her to the hospital because she&#39;s not a licensed driver yet and I felt the 10 mile walk was just too far.<br/>

to jump through the standard hoops. I did say, though, that you were<br/>
looking at the conventional road, and you are.  As an unschooler, she has<br/>
the freedom to take on an internship, now, before college, whenever...<br/>
she could spend hours every day at a hospital, she could volunteer and<br/>
really get into it now... when my dad looks at applicants for the<br/>
residency program, he doesn&#39;t necessarily pick the ones with the highest<br/>
GPA, or the ones from the &quot;best&quot; schools. That&#39;s just not enough anymore,<br/>
and often the ones with the highest scores don&#39;t have what it takes to<br/>
succeed as a doctor.  But someone who says, &quot;I took an EMT class when I<br/>
was 16 at the community college, then spent a summer in Mexico<br/>
volunteering for Cruz Roja, and now I&#39;m working towards becoming an ER<br/>
doctor&quot; would sure stand out from the crowd, and would clearly know a lot<br/>
more about it than the average applicant. Yes, you need a 4 yr degree and<br/>
you need to have the prereqs covered, but that&#39;s really not a lot to do,<br/>
and there&#39;s so much more out there...<br/>

You are making assumptions about our situation that you do not know. She already *does* do other things besides academic stuff.<br/>

  &gt; reply:I have, Dar. And I&#39;d be interested in knowing how you think <br/>
  &gt; one can become a licensed physician (neurosurgery, in particular) <br/>
  &gt; without jumping the standard hoops. I&#39;d be *very* interested.....<br/>
<br/>
  I believe you are misquoting me. Nowhere did I say that she wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
  to jump through the standard hoops. I did say, though, that you were<br/>
  looking at the conventional road, and you are.  As an unschooler, she has<br/>
  the freedom to take on an internship, now, before college, whenever...<br/>
  she could spend hours every day at a hospital, she could volunteer and<br/>
  really get into it now... when my dad looks at applicants for the<br/>
  residency program, he doesn&#39;t necessarily pick the ones with the highest<br/>
  GPA, or the ones from the &quot;best&quot; schools. That&#39;s just not enough anymore,<br/>
  and often the ones with the highest scores don&#39;t have what it takes to<br/>
  succeed as a doctor.  But someone who says, &quot;I took an EMT class when I<br/>
  was 16 at the community college, then spent a summer in Mexico<br/>
  volunteering for Cruz Roja, and now I&#39;m working towards becoming an ER<br/>
  doctor&quot; would sure stand out from the crowd, and would clearly know a lot<br/>
  more about it than the average applicant. Yes, you need a 4 yr degree and<br/>
  you need to have the prereqs covered, but that&#39;s really not a lot to do,<br/>
  and there&#39;s so much more out there...<br/>

<br/>
  Why, is that what you&#39;re trying to do? The timing of your appearance here<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; She&#39;s done her own research and also read the same books I read. <br/>
  &gt; Further, she&#39;s shadowed several doctors in surgery at our local <br/>
  &gt; teaching hospital (Bowman Gray School of Medicine in NC). She&#39;s <br/>
  &gt; worked with children in a physical therapy type setting. She&#39;s <br/>
  &gt; teaching herself Anatomy & Physiology from a college reference book. <br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s wonderful! <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t see myself doing that sort of stuff for my daughter<br/>
  &gt; in 7 years... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; Well, I am glad to help my dd anyway I can and this was just one of <br/>
  &gt; the ways. While she was teaching gymnastics (her parttime job <br/>
  &gt; consisting of 8 hrs a week), I went to borders and bought the books <br/>
  &gt; for us to read. I also made the phone call for her to shadow the <br/>
  &gt; doctors around. Heck, I even *drove* her to the hospital because <br/>
  &gt; she&#39;s not a licensed driver yet and I felt the 10 mile walk was just <br/>
  &gt; too far. Go figure.....<br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes people stoop to sarcasm when they can&#39;t really logically<br/>
  support their points. Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
  I already drive my daughter to things that interest her, because she<br/>
  can&#39;t do that for herself. That&#39;s what I&#39;m there for. I&#39;m also here to<br/>
  help out when she wants it, but she&#39;s pretty independent now at 8.  I<br/>
  think would be concerned if at 15, she couldn&#39;t find her own books at the<br/>
  bookstore, or make her own phone calls to people to request a job shadow.<br/>
  Are you not at all concerned that she&#39;ll presumably be off to college in<br/>
  2 or 3 years, and she&#39;s still so dependent on you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792825883">When I was 16 and out on my own (with some parental support in the form of<br/>
travelers checks sent to me in the mail), figuring out what to do with my<br/>
life, I ended up staying for a couple of months at the house of a carpenter<br/>
in Maine who worked for Shelter Institute (which helps people learn to build<br/>
their own houses). I remember reading aloud parts of The Sheepskin Psychosis<br/>
(a book which questions the true financial value of college tuition as an<br/>
investment), because he kept insisting that I belonged in college (Id been<br/>
accepted through early admissions, then ducked out and the last moment and<br/>
was swearing Id never go).<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing about this scene, with me pacing around in front of the<br/>
woodstove declaiming and him shaking his head, was that he had gone all the<br/>
way through college and med school, and started his residency, before<br/>
realizing that hed never really wanted to be a doctor  that it had been<br/>
his parents idea, and that what he really wanted to do was to work with his<br/>
hands in a more elemental way. Hed also told me that hed discovered while<br/>
doing his emergency room rotation that he was powerless to help most of his<br/>
patients. Theyd come to him with some horrible problem that could only<br/>
truly be resolved through major lifestyle changes, and all he could do was<br/>
write them a prescription so they would go away and he could get on to the<br/>
next one.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could have gone into some form of alternative medicine, given that<br/>
such an enormous amount of effort and money had gone into getting him<br/>
through med school. But, hey, wait  if were going to think of somebodys<br/>
life as an investment, maybe all this trouble could have been avoided if<br/>
hed gotten a taste of the reality of being a doctor way back as a teenager!<br/>
<br/>
In my early teens I wanted to be either a doctor or a lawyer because they<br/>
were the most difficult college majors I knew of. I suspect a lot of teens<br/>
want to be doctors and lawyers because of this, or because of all those<br/>
flashy TV series about these two professions. Also, its a really safe thing<br/>
to say when all those adults start coming at you with the question, What do<br/>
you want to be? (Its also a safe thing for parents to say to their<br/>
relatives and acquaintances.)<br/>
<br/>
Not saying thats necessarily the case here, of course  I dont know Sarah<br/>
s daughter. But an unschooling teen has a great advantage in being able to<br/>
take the time to explore options live, in the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
When I was that age, hospitals accepted volunteers starting at age 14.  Vets<br/>
 offices might give her more close-up experience in medical procedures.<br/>
<br/>
Later: Just caught this before it escaped my outbox, and after reading Sarah<br/>
s response to Dar. Okay, so it sounds like Sarahs daughter is already<br/>
doing what I was suggesting.<br/>

To which you responded:  &quot;it&#39;s interesting how you focus on Horizon, since<br/>
that&#39;s<br/>
the charter I said I had no personal experience with&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Your original statement was: &quot;I don&#39;t work for Horizon, but I have friends<br/>
who do. They<br/>
are probably one of the most unschooling-friendly in the bay area - they<br/>
actually do inservices for their ES&#39;s on different methods of homeschooling,<br/>
including unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which IS a defense of charters schools, Horizon in particular.<br/>
<br/>
As to your comment/opinion for which you offer no support, (biweekly work<br/>
samples), I didn&#39;t say anything about biweekly anythings.  I posted copies<br/>
of what is in Horizons website and they state &quot;The learning records must be<br/>
sent to the Lincoln office electronically within seven (7) rotations of the<br/>
earth after the learning period of no more than 20 school days.&quot;  While<br/>
&quot;learning records&quot; can constitute &quot;work samples,&quot; 20 days does not<br/>
constitute biweekly.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Except that that wasn&#39;t my introductory post, since I&#39;ve bopped on and off<br/>
this list for quite a while. Perhaps that was just the first time you<br/>
noticed me&quot; which was precisely my point.  &quot;You&quot; decided that the other<br/>
poster was new, which wasn&#39;t correct.  &quot;You&quot; are taking acception to being<br/>
judged by the standards you set in your post to judge another list member.<br/>

you did post that Horizon requires work samples every 4 weeks -Message<br/>
#27326 - to contradict my statement that Horizon only required work<br/>
samples twice a year. I got email from a friend a couple of weeks ago<br/>
where she mentioned that it was indeed still twice a year.<br/>

delurking)&quot;.  It was pretty easy to check the website and see that she&#39;d<br/>
been here a few months. Unlike you, I don&#39;t make those kinds of<br/>
