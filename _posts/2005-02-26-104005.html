She is  seven and three months old.  At what point, if ever, should I  be<br/>
concerned enough about her speech to seek professional help?  I&#39;ve  talked to<br/>
her before about her R&#39;s.  She knows that she cannot speak  the true R sound<br/>
and I&#39;ve had her focus on how I say a word with R in it so  that she<br/>
recognizes that the word is spelled with an R not a W.  I  certainly don&#39;t<br/>
want to do anything to discourage her from writing and she  doesn&#39;t care very<br/>
much that her invented spelling is difficult for some to  read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Holly couldn&#39;t pronounce &quot;r&quot; at that age, but she wasn&#39;t starting to spell  <br/>
yet.  When she wanted to write, she would dictate and then copy it back  down <br/>
in her own hand.  But even after she got better at &quot;r&quot; she would often  ask if <br/>
a word had a &quot;r&quot; in it, so that she could think about how it would be  <br/>
spelled. She could hear other people&#39;s &quot;r&quot; usually, but when spelling she was  going <br/>
from her own pronunciation.  (Or if someone wasn&#39;t understanding what  she was <br/>
saying, she would ask if the word had an &quot;r&quot; so they could help figure  out <br/>
what she meant by plugging an &quot;r&quot; in.)  <br/>
<br/>
I had some friends who  were speech therapists, and two of them did single <br/>
(casual) sessions with Holly,  one at a party, and one at a restaurant.  She <br/>
used to practice saying  &quot;Roger Rabbit&#39;s buried treasure&quot; while she was working <br/>
on making the &quot;r&quot; because  that phrase has initial/beginning, mid and <br/>
terminal/end sounds.<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry at seven, though.  Offer to help spell the words that  had <br/>
&quot;r&quot; and maybe (if she thinks it would be fun, otherwise no) maybe make 3x5  <br/>
cards with the words she has needed to write before and might need to write  <br/>
again.  Then she can go to her own words set and find them again for  spelling <br/>
purposes (and see those r&#39;s).<br/>
