Good for you for figuring it out - and helping him to!<br/>
<br/>
My son is allergic to dyes and some preservatives.  The initial symptoms<br/>
are behavioural but if there is continued exposure he gets rashes and<br/>
asthma.  He also has a problem with wheat.  The terms allergy and<br/>
sensitivity are interchangeable in my mind and the mind of the old man<br/>
Physician we used to see.  Not so much in the minds of these newer<br/>
&quot;upstart docs&quot; these days.  But whatever you call it the symptons are the<br/>
same.  When he eats wheat, he has severe intestinal problems.  Bloating,<br/>
loss of bowel control combined with constipation (which is possible, I<br/>
never would have believed it if I hadn&#39;t seen it - over and over and<br/>
over), upset stomach, gas, gas, and more gas, etc.  We have restricted<br/>
his diet for about two years now and if no caring person gave him a<br/>
&quot;little treat&#39; because we are so mean to him, he was for the most part,<br/>
fine.  He is nine now though and I want him to assume more of the<br/>
responsibility for food choices so I started letting him cheat.  A lot. <br/>
He was miserable.  I sat him down and explained why he is sick and we<br/>
went over what he had been eating.  He seems to have gotten it but I know<br/>
from experience that we will have to go through the cycle several more<br/>
times before he really gets it.<br/>
I&#39;ve been through it before with middle daughter and milk and with older<br/>
daughter and corn.  I control (and yes, I do believe that a three year<br/>
old may need some parental control in this issue) it long enough for them<br/>
to feel good (or get old enough to handle it) then I put the<br/>
responsibility on them, because I won&#39;t be here forever.  &#39;Old enough&#39;<br/>
was different for each one.  Jenni was ready at 5, Rachel was never<br/>
really in my complete control and never will be, but I stopped trying to<br/>
get her to listen at about 9, and Wyndham is 9 and just starting to get<br/>
it.<br/>
Oh, BTW - I&#39;ve been though it myself with several substances so I do know<br/>
what it is like to have to watch others eating something you can&#39;t have<br/>
and really like.  <br/>
One thing you can do to help the diet go over better - find a good<br/>
natural food store and experiment.  There are loads of wheat and<br/>
dairy-free products available if you know where to look.  Jenni like<br/>
Tofutti best of the &quot;ice creams&quot;.  Barbara&#39;s Bakery is good for wheat<br/>
free stuff.  And I found some cookies he liked but I forget the brand<br/>
name just now.  There are lots of groups for this too.  Most of them will<br/>
be more than willing to share recipes and stuff.  But finding good<br/>
alternatives helps A LOT.  For example, we made Mac and Cheese last night<br/>
for dinner.  Wyndham has special corn pasta for his and Jenni eats plain<br/>
Mac or mixes plain mac into a spoonful on mac and cheese so she gets the<br/>
flavor with just a bit of milk, which she can handle occasionally.     <br/>

&gt;   My son has both eczema and asthma.  I&#39;ve never heard anyone claim <br/>
&gt; that there are emotional factors involved with them.  I have heard <br/>
&gt; lots and lots of claims, and research, of the direct dietary factors <br/>
&gt; involved.  My son and I don&#39;t drink milk or eat wheat.  Neither of <br/>
&gt; us are allergic, but we are &quot;sensitive&quot; to them.  Without them in <br/>
&gt; our diet, my son no longer has stomach cramps, night terrors, <br/>
&gt; eczema, his astma is under control without drugs, and his behavior <br/>
&gt; has changed significantly (we both also have Tourette Syndrome, and <br/>
&gt; the behavioral &quot;co-morbidities&quot; that go along with TS have <br/>
&gt; disappeared.)  My son hates his new diet, but is very, very happy <br/>
&gt; with the changes that have gone on in his body.  He&#39;ll get used to <br/>
&gt; the diet eventually, and there is no way that I will allow him to go <br/>
&gt; back to his old ways of eating.  The diet hasn&#39;t caused me any more <br/>
&gt; stress than eating the old way, it&#39;s just replaced the stress of <br/>
&gt; having a sick, cranky, anxious, depressed child, with a healthy <br/>
&gt; child who is generally not happy at dinner time.  <br/>

     In three words I can sum up everything I&#39;ve learned about life: it<br/>
goes on.<br/>
