<div id="ygrps-yiv-66069317">So it&#39;s contradictory, I know, but in working on my games page<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve found some things that should be of interest, variously, to some  <br/>
of you.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Russian dice game that has a game sheet you can print out  <br/>
here:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s too hard for me; too many rules and numbers.  I glazed over.   <br/>
But I had never seen or heard of it, so I bring it here for those of  <br/>
you for whom numbers and rules about them sound fun!<br/>

There are some pencil-and-paper games in general.  Sprout looks  <br/>
good.  It has numbers, but only one rule. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those who prefer games based on words and letters, two easy things:<br/>

Yesterday Holly was alphabetizing her favorite movies for MyPage, and  <br/>
&quot;showed me her work.&quot;  We talked about oddities of alphabetizing, how  <br/>
phone books put all the capitalized things together, like radio and  <br/>
TV stations, rather than interspersed, and about it being a little  <br/>
variable.  The video store puts numeric names before A; the phone  <br/>
book doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s something I sent her from the games googling:<br/>

&gt; The ones on the right side are alphabets, and I thought of your  <br/>
&gt; alphabetical order, because one of them skips some letters!  That&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; cool!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are lots of games on that site, if you click whatever box is  <br/>
&gt; at the bottom, but I thought these were cool.  Some online dot-to- <br/>
&gt; dot games are irritating, but this one&#39;s easy.<br/>
