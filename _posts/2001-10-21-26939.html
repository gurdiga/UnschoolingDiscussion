<br/>
Just stuff that we will eat anyway mainly.  Lots of pinto beans (just need<br/>
water and a heat source), matches, can opener, knife, canned tuna, canned<br/>
fruit, ramen noodles, candles, flashlight, batteries, battery operated<br/>
radio, etc..<br/>
<br/>
As far as the first aid kit, just made sure to replace all the basics we had<br/>
used up.  Bandages, antibiotic cream, pain killer, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I don&#39;t think we will really need it, but it would come in<br/>
handy even in the case of a bad storm or whatever.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Now I am taking just the opposite approach.  We are going about our lives <br/>
as<br/>
 normal. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   I think it is great if people continue as normal. But w/ a 5 year old I <br/>
can not imagine being on a plane where they subdued another passenger then <br/>
landed. I know it would be incredibly difficult to get my child onto another <br/>
plane to cont. Then I may be stuck in PA. w/ my family. No thanks! Maybe if I <br/>
weren&#39;t traveling so far alone w/ a young child. Plus add a few hours for the <br/>
new security checks and it makes for a very long tense day. I am fine w/ the <br/>
new security measures but 15 hours in airports w/ a highly spirited child is <br/>
not my idea of fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891377199">Thanks, Julie, and everyone else.  I guess I was just making sure <br/>
everyone didn&#39;t know some special thing to have on hand that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
heard about!<br/>
