<div id="ygrps-yiv-475400925">We&#39;re unschooling by default.  My son Jimmy was in Early Intervention <br/>
preschool from ages 3-5, and it was not a good fit.  By the end of the second year, <br/>
I knew we were going to homeschool.  In PA you don&#39;t have to do anything <br/>
official until age 8, and since he was only 5, I felt I had plenty of time to get <br/>
my ducks in a row.  I worked in preschool for 15 years, and was practically <br/>
rubbing my hands together in excitement at the prospect of &quot;teaching him at <br/>
home&quot;.<br/>
  I went out and bought &quot;The Carolina Curriculum for Special Needs <br/>
Preschoolers&quot;.  I was in checklist heaven.  Here was EVERYTHING a kid &quot;needs to know&quot;, <br/>
from catching a ball to making a sandwich.  So I made lots of lists.<br/>
  The next thing I did was read everything I could find about homeschooling.  <br/>
And I joined lots of yahoo groups.  PA has some crazy hs laws, so if a group <br/>
was about PA homeschoolers, I joined.  One was called PA Unschoolers.  That <br/>
was the first time I heard that term.  I was intrigued by the whole idea, so I <br/>
joined Unschooling Dotcom.<br/>
  In the meantime, I learned a few things.  One, I could toss a ball forever, <br/>
but I can&#39;t make him catch it if he didn&#39;t want to.  Two, while I was busy <br/>
with my lists, Jim had learned most of his letters and numbers by fooling around <br/>
with his computer games.  And from being  with people all day who talk to him <br/>
and listen to him, his speech has improved dramatically.  <br/>
  So, by the time I learned about unschooling, I already had proof that it <br/>
worked.  That a child could learn without being &quot;taught&quot;.  And just because <br/>
we&#39;re unschooling by default, it doesn&#39;t make it faulty or inferior.  <br/>

PS  One day, instead of running away, he stayed put and caught the ball.  <br/>
Then he laughed, dropped it, and ran away.</div>
