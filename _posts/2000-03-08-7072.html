<div id="ygrps-yiv-901964644">Just a suggestion to the list owner. Perhaps at the bottom of every<br/>
message you could put the instructions for unsubscribing? I&#39;ve noticed<br/>
on Onelist that many (many, many) people forget how they subscribed and<br/>
try to unsubscribe as this person did. Onelist has an option for a<br/>
tagline. In the tagline you could put the simple instructions of how to<br/>
unsubscribe. <br/>
<br/>
For &quot;The Prisoner&quot; - go to onelist.com. Then go to your lists. Then<br/>
check unsubscribe for this list. <br/>

Success Stories* on time and it&#39;s scheduled for June release.  15 &quot;grown&quot; hsers,<br/>
12 youngsters, mostly teens.  Some of them were unschoolers, others more<br/>
traditional, all loving the work they&#39;ve chosen.  They&#39;re quite a bunch I&#39;m glad<br/>
to have gotten the chance to meet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832386921">You have to put the unsubscribe in the mailing address for it to work.  I <br/>
believe it is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com">unschooling-dotcom-unsubscribe@egroups.com</a>??  or maybe <br/>
unsubscribe goes first??<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, sorry to see you go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575490847">It has been great talking to everyone and receiving a lot of information.  I <br/>
feel I have to say goodbye for a while so that I can spend more time with my <br/>
children.  Lately, I think I&#39;ve been spending too much time on the computer.  <br/>
I get so many emails from this list and all of them are so interesting that I <br/>
can&#39;t seem to get away.  When I look at the time, I can&#39;t believe how long <br/>
I&#39;ve spent on the computer.  My children really need my undivided attention, <br/>
even when they are watching tv and I&#39;m not really into it.  I want to be with <br/>
them.<br/>

Thank you for all your help!!<br/>

it&#39;s best to stop reading about it and just do it.<br/>
<br/>
But we&#39;ll still be here if you need us :-)<br/>
