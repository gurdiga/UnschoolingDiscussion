&lt;&lt; Avery is going to be much more traumatized by the abuse at his brothers <br/>
hand,that you are allowing,than any trauma a spanking would cause Jaiden.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The spanking says the other physical abuse was within a range of <br/>
acceptability.<br/>
<br/>
The spanking says an older bigger person CAN and sometimes SHOULD hit a <br/>
smaller one.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have 5 children and am an extremely permissive parent,but one thing I <br/>
have zero tolerance about is an older sibling  physically or mentally harming <br/>
a younger sibling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How about having zero tolerance for an older person physically or mentally <br/>
harming a younger person.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I explain to them that I&#39;ll allow no one to  hurt any of my children and <br/>
that includes them hurting each other.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It takes some mental gymnastics, smoke and mirrors NOT to see that spanking <br/>
is hurting.  if you claim not to allow anyone to hurt any of your children <br/>
but that does NOT include an adult/parent hurting them, you&#39;re blinding <br/>
yourself to simple truth.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a lie for any spanking parent to say they will not allow anyoen to hurt <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why Jaiden is doing it does not matter because there is no why that could <br/>
justify him harming Avery.<br/>
please don&#39;t let him hurt Avery anymore.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why parents spank doesn&#39;t matter, because there is no justifiication for <br/>
harming children.<br/>
Please don&#39;t let yourself hurt your children anymore.<br/>
