<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012785730">Hey, Kim, turn off your lights and air conditioner &lt;g&gt;  We don&#39;t want<br/>
anymore blackouts up here in cool northern CA &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think SF or one of the other Bay Area cities is one of those looking at<br/>
outlawing cell phone use by drivers.  I think it was on KRON and they did a<br/>
study that showed that fender benders and running of red lights had risen by<br/>
some astronomical figure since folks started yakking on the cell phones.<br/>
<br/>
The National Public Services Research Institute did a study that showed<br/>
there was a 20% to 29% &quot;chances of a highway-traffic situation going<br/>
unnoticed&quot; (red lights, lane excursions, etc.) by cell phone users.  The<br/>
study also showed that folks in the 50-80 yo group were twice as likely to<br/>
be distracted by cell phones.  What is interesting about this study is that<br/>
they don&#39;t consider these numbers to be &quot;significant.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
The Insurance Research Council did a study a few years ago that is one of<br/>
those &quot;it just goes to show&quot; surveys.  &quot;an overwhelming number of cellular<br/>
phone owners (84 percent) believe that using a phone while driving is a<br/>
distraction and increases the likelihood of an accident&quot; but 61% use them<br/>
anyway.  Go figure!<br/>

<br/>
The New England Journal of Medicine also did a study and it showed that<br/>
folks using cell phones were 4 times more likely to have accidents.<br/>

<br/>
And a 1999 report by the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the<br/>
University of South Florida found existing studies show the chances of<br/>
having an accident while driving and talking on a mobile phone increased<br/>
anywhere from 34% to more than 300%.<br/>
<br/>
35 states are looking at legislation and three states have some sort of<br/>
minor legislation (FL, CA and Mass).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797023951">After I told DH about the UNC study, he said the &#39;outside distractions&#39; that caused the accidents were probably other cell phone users that caused the crash by not paying attention!<br/>
