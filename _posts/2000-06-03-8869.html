How did your daughter do on the shorter trip?<br/>
Great, I suspect.  Does she know/ and will call you if she feels like she is <br/>
in trouble?  Does she follow personal safety advice and practices?  Do you <br/>
trust her instincts? Will she check in every week, just to ease her mothers <br/>
mind on a pre-designated day?   ... maybe postcards when she arrives at her <br/>
next designation with a few words...(a book of post card stamps  and your <br/>
home address labels would be a nice &quot;see you when you get back&quot; gift.  If so, <br/>
then I know she will have a great safe adventure.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be important to keep someone informed on her whereabouts <br/>
once she gets there.  So if something happens, NOT  THAT IT WILL AND IS VERY <br/>
UNLIKELY, but it is better than having the whole country to look for her.  It <br/>
is a great way to avoiding a iternary, but still have some safety, keeping <br/>
you informed on her trip, and give you peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
How exciting for her?  I would of loved to HAVE the courage <br/>
to do something like that at here age!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
just some thoughts...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545576484">Give her an ATT cell phone.  I think they also have a pre-programmed 9ll<br/>
button on them!  My son bought his wife one because she travels a lot with<br/>
her parents (they are in their 70&#39;s) and they are good in all states<br/>
without roaming charges and you get 1000 minutes a month.  He wanted to<br/>
feel that she had an extra measure of safety and, as he put it, &quot;she won&#39;t<br/>
let me buy her a Doberman to take with her, so this was the next best<br/>
thing.&quot;<br/>

greyhound bus and going out to Eugene, OR, to visit a friend for a couple<br/>
of weeks. Then she&#39;s using a 30-day Amtrak pass to go wherever the mood<br/>
takes her around the country. She&#39;ll be staying in hostels mostly, and says<br/>
she wants the experience of arriving in a city in the morning w/o knowing<br/>
where she&#39;ll be staying or what she&#39;ll discover. Sounds nice and<br/>
adventurous to a stranger, but a bit frightening to a parent!<br/>
