&gt;<br/>
&gt;We did<br/>
&gt;have the perks of staying home from school on Jewish holidays, <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Around here the schools are really, really strict about attendance. <br/>
 There are some penalities for even missing 3 days in a semester (don&#39;t <br/>
miss any and you don&#39;t have to take semester tests).  Anyway, the school <br/>
where my eldest son attended penalized him for taking an extra day to <br/>
attend a college day for high schoolers.  They insisted that he do that <br/>
on &quot;holidays&quot; (like the college would be open!).<br/>
<br/>
Your post got me to thinking if there is any leeway for religious <br/>
observances there now.  I&#39;m fairly certain that the most &quot;exotic&quot; <br/>
religion in that small Arkansas town where my son went to school was <br/>
Catholic.  (The snake handlers are considered more orthodox.)  I wish I <br/>
had thought of religious observances when I was fighting for him at the <br/>
school.  It would have given me a whole new argument in his favor!<br/>
<br/>
Were you ever penalized for taking those days off?  I can&#39;t imagine how <br/>
they would handle it now!<br/>
