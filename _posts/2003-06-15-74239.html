<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026432271">What about tea parties and manners?  I think this conversation is talking about a little boy, but for little girls who love tea parties, couldn&#39;t that be a neat way to learn manners and have a whole lot of fun doing it?

Party, ...what would a polite person do, in various situations and <br/>
make some of them outrageous...I can just see us giggling over <br/>
the &quot;up pinky!&quot; and the &quot;stir your tea counterclockwise ONLY, dear&quot; <br/>
and stuff, along with &quot;How to Introduce Someone to a Friend&quot; <br/>
and &quot;What to Say When Someone Says Something Nice to You.&quot; Practice <br/>
eye-contact, polite responses, and such, along with &quot;Please don&#39;t rub <br/>
your teeth clean with the tablecloth&quot; LOL (wasn&#39;t that a &quot;manner&quot; in <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995095816">Okay, Sandra, so if I have a tea party with Margaux and BJ, which they love doing anyway, and I just act the part of the high mannered person, then I suppose that would teach them something.  Of course I&#39;d do it with a British accent and Margaux would soon follow suit, if she wouldn&#39;t already be speaking in that manner.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have a tea party just to teach or anything just to teach.  I&#39;ve learned, even through my very limited experience, that it&#39;s the best way to get a child disinterested in something once beloved to her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957821553">Heidi, I really like that whole post.  I wonder if maybe you could set up the whole thing without the kids knowing about it.  Does your older girl ever get into the tea parties anymore?  Could you make masks of Keanu Reeves, the Pope (no disrespect meant), your mayor, your mother, and others (print out their faces and glue them on paper bags)?  Then, the next time a tea party arises or a dinner or your next supper, you could come out and put on a show, you know?  That would be surprising and fun, I bet.  Just an idea.<br/>

<br/>
Your ideas were great!!<br/>
<br/>
Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
Kass and Kree rarely play tea party anymore. However, Kass is a tea set <br/>
collector, so every now and then she gets the urge. Funny though, the only proper <br/>
etiquette they use is the pinky thing. They think that&#39;s funny. I watched them <br/>
play out a scene unbeknownst to them, and it played out just like our coffee <br/>
nites do. My coffee nite pals all lurk here so they know what I mean. Instead <br/>
of chatting about their children as we do, they chatting about their pets. <br/>
Instead of chatting about hubby&#39;s, they chatted about neighbors. It was quite <br/>
hysterical. I&#39;ve never considered using that time for etiquette practice, but then <br/>
again, the apples don&#39;t fall far from the tree. I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d <br/>
question the rank thing too. Hmmmm. I feel a discussion coming on. DH is home from <br/>
work today, so he can chime in from the military POV. Could make for an <br/>
interesting day.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that brings me to my next thought. Kass and Kree love when they get <br/>
down the wine glasses, pour apple juice in them and pretend to have a fancy <br/>
swaree&#39;. So perhaps with older children, something in that realm would be <br/>
appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

<br/>
You said &quot;I think&quot;.<br/>
*You* think he needs the tea party to learn manners.  Has he expressed<br/>
disappointment in his own social skills and asked for help from you?<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of people &quot;think&quot; their kids should be potty trained at<br/>
two, reading at five, memorizing multiplication tables at seven and <br/>
passing college entrance exams at fourteen.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s young and he needs the niceties modeled to  and for him in a real<br/>
and meaningful way.  If that hasn&#39;t happened yet he can hardly be blamed<br/>
for being &quot;clueless&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Here we great each other nicely when one of us comes home, we say please<br/>
and thank you.   We say hello and goodbye.    That&#39;s just a reality of<br/>
our lives together and it&#39;s Dylan&#39;s reality too.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve always coached him he may have just relied on you and not<br/>
developed his own understanding about social niceties.   If you model<br/>
instead he&#39;ll gain awareness.   He&#39;s a little kid.  He&#39;s not meeting the<br/>
Pope, he&#39;s not applying for jobs, he&#39;s not the host at a fine restaurant.<br/>
  People skills develop at different times for different people just like<br/>
reading skills and writing skills and make your own sandwich skills. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be fine if he has fine examples. <br/>

Right.  So do it with REAL &quot;math.&quot;  Real situations.   Not &quot;worksheets&quot; or <br/>
fake teaparties.<br/>
(Though the role-playing scenario did seem to have some merit.  Having a <br/>
spectacularly fake teaparty where people played other people is a more fun <br/>
scenario than a family just being more formal because they want to practice.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know why that struck my yucky.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Rank? I never even THOUGHT of rank before this thread. So, how would <br/>
<br/>
rank figure into introducing a friend to my gramma?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Grandma ranks, unless the friend is a bride at her own wedding. &lt;g&gt;  (Or the <br/>
hostess of a party in her own home, or the governor or mayor, or the featured <br/>
artist at a gallery opening, or...)  Out in the wilds, like at a mall, if <br/>
you&#39;re with your grandmother and a friend of yours arrives, you should tell your <br/>
grandmother who this friend is and how you know her, I think.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Introduce my <br/>
<br/>
friend to my gramma, or my gramma to my friend? THAT is a fascinating <br/>
<br/>
facet of this, that I never EVER knew before. Propah Protocol.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why I use the pope and a dog, or the president and your little <br/>
brother.  It&#39;s harder to think about it when they&#39;re more or less same <br/>
age/gender/social status than if they&#39;re more extreme.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s situational, especially in the U.S. where rank is allegedly levelled <br/>
out.  It&#39;s more in flux, at least.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Could you make masks of Keanu Reeves, the Pope (no disrespect meant), your <br/>
mayor, your mother, and others (print out their faces and glue them on paper <br/>
bags)?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Name tags.  Or hats/headbands.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t eat and drink properly with a mask.</div>

Good point.  <br/>
It&#39;s never too late to learn those kinds of manners.<br/>
Heck, I was just lately in an exchange in which some adults said they had  <br/>
never thought of the individuals&#39; relative rank when they made introductions.  <br/>

have a president over, as well as The Queen. A Quaker (or, what sect <br/>
is it that won&#39;t remove their hats?) meets The Queen! <br/>

But remember, part of my analogy was a supervisor who could see that, <br/>
with a little Algebra Education, Robby would be more qualified for <br/>
the next job promotion.<br/>
<br/>
Supervisor=caring adults in his life (me)<br/>
<br/>
next job promotion=ability to function socially, thus enhancing his <br/>
life a bit<br/>

Does that fly, or no?<br/>
