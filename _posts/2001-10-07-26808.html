<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752648164">&lt;&lt;Inspirational reads&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like stories about real people and real events.  One of my<br/>
favorites is &quot;South&quot;, story of the Endurance&#39;s crew who were stranded in the<br/>
Antarctic for almost 2 years and managed to make their way back across the<br/>
ice to civilization, without much in the way of equipment and without loss<br/>
of life.<br/>
<br/>
Another is &quot;Che Guevara:  A Revolutionary Life&quot;, story of Fidel Castro&#39;s<br/>
buddy who gave up the life of a doctor in Argentina to fight what he saw as<br/>
cruel injustices.  (This book  also gives tremendous insight into the mental<br/>
processes of guerrilla fighters and terrorists, how they can do a tremendous<br/>
amount with very few people.  Example:  Castro took over Cuba with an<br/>
initial &quot;army&quot; of less than 20 men)<br/>
<br/>
Both books show how people fought against tremendous odds, reaching down<br/>
into their cores, to obtain their goals.<br/>

&gt; Hi Pam,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m wondering what kind of book store you have in your home. I love this<br/>
&gt; idea. Do you make any money?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enough to support a family in a not-inexpensive (but not the most expensive)<br/>
part of California. We are looking to move to a less expensive part of the<br/>
state, or maybe to Oregon, probably by this coming summer.<br/>
<br/>
We sell used, rare and collectible books on line through a variety of<br/>
databases as well as eBay.<br/>
<br/>
I started casually, selling off a few books I didn&#39;t want, for fun, on eBay.<br/>
When I decided to &quot;get serious&quot;, I discovered I am extremely good at buying<br/>
books to resell, which is the entire key to success in this business.<br/>
<br/>
In July 2000, my husband quit his day job and joined the business. Today, we<br/>
have ourselves, one part-time employee, and ship between 600 and 1000 books<br/>
per month.<br/>

Wow that is fantastic!  My parents who are antique dealers started selling on<br/>
ebay 1 yr ago.  My mother is very knowledgeable and well known in her fields,<br/>
she picks up and item for a couple dollars and sells it for $100&#39;s.  My dad<br/>
who is 72 is taking<br/>
computer classes to further his knowledge and takes the most fantastic pics<br/>
I have seen on ebay.  My dad wishes he would have gotten on ebay years <br/>
ago its such a wonderful medium as they are older now and its less physical<br/>
work (they still have a space in one antique mall). Good for you Pam and your<br/>
family.  I love to hear about unique stories such as that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834242451">Hi Pam<br/>
Do you ship by mail? What if the buyer is not satisfied? Do you accept returns etc? I would really like to get into this. I love books and I&#39;ve been looking for a way to make some money but stay home with my kids. What kind of places do you go to find books? Do you have your own web site? Do you sell from your house at all, like a store front? How do you know what a book is worth? Is there a good book about this that I should have to help with pricing. Thanks for your help!!!  You may have saved me from having to give up on unschooling for a while!!!! You can e-mail me privately if you want. I don&#39;t want you to waste time on me but if there&#39;s a bit of advice that you could share that is a must know etc...I would appreciate it sooooo much!!!<br/>
Thanks for everything and anything,<br/>
