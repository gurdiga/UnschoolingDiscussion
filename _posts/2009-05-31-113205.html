<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300983992">Hi,<br/>
My family has been hsing for 9 years.  I&#39;m transitioning into unschooling this summer.  I tried to do this before but my daughter freaked a little.  I didn&#39;t tell the kids we were changing our way of schooling.  I just gradually stopped assigning things to do.  My son (9) happily moved on with his life but my daughter(13) was concerned about her education and asked for the schedule back.  I don&#39;t think she really likes the schedule.  It often takes her 3 weeks to complete a week of assignments.  I obviously don&#39;t enforce the schedule.  Have I ruined her?!<br/>
<br/>
I read Teenage Liberation HB and have ordered a copy for her.  Any ideas on how to transition her this summer without saying&quot;unschool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Background: I always loved unschooling.  My husband required us to have structure.  I&#39;ve moved from school district independent study to charter to R4 (CA private school) over the years.  Upgrading our independence over the years. I know now he trusts me enough to do my own thing or  let the kids do their own thing.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a million other things to say but I&#39;ll go slow :)<br/>

Whether people here say yes or no doesn&#39;t change whatever damage has  <br/>
been done.   There are other factors about your relationship we can&#39;t  <br/>
know, and about her own personality and natural traits.   &quot;Ruined&quot; is  <br/>
a harsh word, but it&#39;s not a yes or no question.  Harmed, maybe, but  <br/>
harmed what?   Harm to the ability to relax into natural learning was  <br/>
harm done to most of us by school.  School at home can cause that  <br/>
harm, too.<br/>

<br/>
Kids who have been doing lessons or being schooled have earned the  <br/>
summer off.  There shouldn&#39;t be anything about school or unschool in  <br/>
summer, should there?<br/>
<br/>
July 24 is Learn Nothing Day.   Maybe you could talk to her about  <br/>
that.  Maybe if she can think about a way of life in which it&#39;s  <br/>
impossible to have a day without learning she will start to understand  <br/>
it.<br/>

Rather than having granulated &quot;own things,&quot; find family things.  Find  <br/>
things in dyads, or things that change the environment of the house in  <br/>
ways that facilitate learning.<br/>
