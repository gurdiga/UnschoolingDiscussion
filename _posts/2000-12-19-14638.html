<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753843855">I&#39;ve been following the breastfeeding discussion with fond memories, esp.<br/>
those of bf&#39;ing by the lights of the Christmas tree. My girls are beyond<br/>
that now..but sure enjoyed the warm fuzzies that all of your posts brought<br/>
back to my memory.<br/>
<br/>
So here are some &#39;unschooling discussion questions, and mostly ramblings..<br/>
I&#39;m still trying to let go of all of the trappings of &#39;school&#39;.. and really<br/>
be an unschooling family. But I cannot quite worrying if what the girls do<br/>
with their days is enough??? Even after reading so many unschooling books,<br/>
and going to a Gatto seminar..(And buying his latest book!) I know I should<br/>
have all of this figured out by now.. We have been hm&#39;schoolers for 8yrs<br/>
too!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 16yr old and has always been more &#39;bookish&#39;.. and does her own<br/>
thing so well..(Mostly art, piano and gymnastics) But she was in ps for the<br/>
first 2 yrs and then more traditional hm&#39;school until she was older. She is<br/>
very artistic and is thinking about college.. But I worry if she will really<br/>
be prepared?? She has never learned how to write well, except letters to<br/>
penpals..will she handle all the note taking and college essays? Her time<br/>
has always been spent doing art, working out in the gym or just messing<br/>
around outdoors..as she loves biology.<br/>
<br/>
My younger two, ages 10 and 5 spend their days mostly playing pretend<br/>
games..like dress-up, roll-playing with their dolls and plastic animal<br/>
collections.  We do read allot together, play a few games(mom has to be<br/>
talked into that, as I&#39;m not much of a game person)..they love the computer,<br/>
but mostly just for the fun things - Crayola Paint n&#39; Play Pony &  Madeline<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We have been loosely using Sonlight Curriculum for the past 3 years, but<br/>
this year it has been such a pain trying to follow the TM at all.. I<br/>
continue to cling to it, as a way to keep decent looking records I guess.<br/>
That&#39;s another problem I have, making what the girls do with their<br/>
time..sound educational on paper.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 yo just recently learned to read, and does love books. But cannot do<br/>
traditional math at all. Any attempts at normal math-type workbooks, turn<br/>
into crying sessions and I have bought so many different things. She is<br/>
great at counting her money and figuring out how much she has, when she<br/>
wants to buy something at the store. I wish I were more creative in the math<br/>
area, but I really don&#39;t enjoy math either. (but I sure don&#39;t want to<br/>
cripple my girls in this area) I finally just put all the workbooks and math<br/>
manipulative in a &#39;math learning center&#39; and told her she can use them when<br/>
or if she wants too..so far nothing happening with it tho.<br/>
<br/>
Ok..this is getting pretty long, I just wish I could hang out with one of<br/>
you for a day and watch how your family unschools..knowing how you and your<br/>
family spend a day or a week would be helpful. Do any of you have older<br/>
teens that have went on to college or who are living on their own?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
