<div id="ygrps-yiv-36017361">I want to let everyone know that I just received a copy of Valerie&#39;s new <br/>
book. I wish I could say it&#39;s MY copy, but it is a raffle donation. I read it this <br/>
evening. It&#39;s a quick read and should be a MUST in every Unschooler&#39;s <br/>
library. It&#39;ll make a great Christmas present for in-laws! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations, Valerie!<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, and I loved the forward by Laurie---so sweet!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064636168">Thank you Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been to this list to read in weeks. Decided to do some <br/>
catching up tonight and am so glad I did. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. <br/>
And if you want your own copy &lt;g&gt; I have 4500 copies lining the <br/>
walls of my living room right now. <br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie (who is barely over the soreness from unloading that <br/>
semi-trailer of books)<br/>
