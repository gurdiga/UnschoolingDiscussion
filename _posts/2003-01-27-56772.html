&gt;   &gt; That being the case, I have to wonder where all the other (mostly<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Pauline) teachings came from if not from Judaism.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Kristen<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Pauls teachings were influenced by mithraism.<br/>
&gt;   This is why you see the change from the gospels where they write as if Jesus was a living physical person to Pauls writings where Jesus&#39;s life is rarely, if ever mentioned. It has become all spiritual<br/>
&gt;   and faith based by then.<br/>
&gt;   There&#39;s a really good site showing the parallels between Pauline writings and Mithraism but for some reason I ain&#39;t bookmarked it.<br/>

&gt;   Shyrley gets the gold star!!!!  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who has read about that connection and the many other pagan connections.<br/>
&gt;   Kristen<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mithraism itself isn&#39;t pagan as such. In fact, at one time it was hot contender for religion of western civillisations. It has a god, a saviour who is his son, born on earth to save humanity. It might even<br/>
have the virgin birth, star and crucifixtion. Or that might be Tammuz who is 1000 years older than Christianity. He was born of a virgin, there was a star, wise men, evil king who killed kids under 2,<br/>
crucifiction and resurrection too.<br/>
Mithras did all those things too. And he&#39;s coming back. As is Tammuz and Horus and Krishna and a bunch of others.<br/>
