youngest of the group of regulars around the English language theatre in<br/>
Giessen, Germany.  I drive 45 minutes each way to that theatre, but it&#39;s<br/>

I suspect his love of the stage comes from being dragged to way too many<br/>
rehearsals and performances with me.  I used to play pit orchestra for a<br/>
theatre in Washington state, before we moved to Germany.  He often sat alone<br/>
in the audience and was transfixed.  He also loves dance, especially tap,<br/>
which comes from seeing the show dancers, I think.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughters enjoy doing their shows for you, by all means invite the<br/>
family.  But maybe you can consider searching for theatre opportunities in<br/>
nearby towns and cities.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate many things about community theatre, not the least of which is<br/>
that it costs nothing to be a volunteer but your time and gas money.  So<br/>
many kids activities are expensive.  Also, if you get regularly involved<br/>
someplace, the grown-ups really adopt them.  That&#39;s been especially<br/>
important for us, since my husband is often away, but most any child will<br/>
enjoy and benefit from the attention of grownups other than their own<br/>
parents.  Kids also see adults other than their parents in stressful<br/>
situations and how they cope, adults who do things their parents would never<br/>
do, etc.  It&#39;s a wonderful experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628584757">We are in a smaller town,  but we have a playhouse.    My daughters  5 & 8,  are going to be in the summer production of Winnie the Pooh.   This is their first play.   They get to be animals in the forest,  dress up, sing and dance!   We are so excited!<br/>
<br/>
I have never been in a play,  but I&#39;ve always had a secret desire to do so.   I sit and watch and dream.  Maybe I&#39;ll get my courage up,  being there with the girls.....we&#39;ll see...<br/>
