 Beginnings of the Conflict<br/>
By Denis Mueller<br/>
<br/>
Theodore Herzl is considered the father of Zionism. He felt that Jews across<br/>
the world would always be susceptible to anti-Semitism as long as there was<br/>
no Jewish State. At first, he looked at Argentina and then Uganda before<br/>
settling on Palestine for the Jewish homeland.<br/>
<br/>
Arab nationalism was a simple idea. It was a search for long lost Arab<br/>
identities. For hundreds of years the Arabs had been under the occupation of<br/>
the Ottoman Empire. At the early part of the 20th century, there was a<br/>
possibility for these two movements to co-exist. This is a story of that<br/>
lost opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of the 20th century, about a half a million Arabs lived in<br/>
Palestine and about 50,000 Jews. The budding discontent within the Ottoman<br/>
Empire provided the new Zionist movement with its first real choice. Should<br/>
they work with the Arabs against the Turks and join the upcoming revolt or<br/>
should they try to acquire an international charter for a Jewish homeland?<br/>
Unfortunately, the early Zionists sided with the Turks, but a small minority<br/>
advocated working with the Arabs.<br/>
<br/>
The Arab leaders faced a dilemma of their own. Should they work with the new<br/>
settlers or oppose them? This is not as unusual as it sounds today. The<br/>
early deputies of Palestine spoke of the common Semitic heritage among the<br/>
two people. But Jewish leaders felt that getting along with the Arabs was<br/>
secondary to the establishing of a Jewish homeland. What they needed was the<br/>
help of a European state to help them establish a charter.<br/>
<br/>
At first, Herzl went to the Sultan but the conversations went nowhere. Then,<br/>
he approached Kaiser Wilhelm who considered the idea briefly but the Kaiser<br/>
was rigid anti-Semite who eventually sided with the Turks. Finally, Herzl<br/>
turned to the British who liked the idea because it was a way to extend the<br/>
British control and protect the Suez Canal.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing happened until the outbreak of the First World War. But the war<br/>
opened the doors of opportunity for the Jewish State. In November of 1917,<br/>
the Zionists achieved their aim with announcing of the Balfour Declaration.<br/>
The reasons for the British decision are many; an effort to engage the<br/>
United States in the war, the fear of a Bolshevik revolution and British<br/>
interests who saw this as a way to maintain a foothold in the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
The British also made a pact with France to divide the Middle East in<br/>
spheres of influence. So the British had made three separate pledges. One<br/>
was the establishment of a Jewish state; the other was with France and the<br/>
third with the Arabs who they promised independence if they would fight on<br/>
the British side in WWI. All were in contradiction of each other.<br/>
<br/>
The leader of the Arabs was Emir Faisel, who was fighting the Turks with the<br/>
hopes of creating a great Arab kingdom; T.E. Lawrence, who was a British<br/>
agent in Cairo aided him in this.  Lawrence was extremely anti-French and<br/>
saw the Arab Nationalist movement as a way to cheat the French and extend<br/>
British control over the area. Faisel, for his part, was sympathetic with<br/>
the aims of a Jewish state. He felt it should be part of his great kingdom.<br/>
In a letter to Felix Frankfurter, he stated:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We know the Arabs and Jews are racial relatives...We shall do everything we<br/>
can, as far as it depends on us, to assist the Zionist proposals by the<br/>
Peace Conference, and we shall welcome the Jews with all our hearts on their<br/>
return home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was no idle boost. Two months earlier, Faisel and Welzmann, under the<br/>
guidance of Lawrence, had drawn up such a plan. The agreement never<br/>
happened. After the war, the French invaded Damascus and drove Faisel out of<br/>
Syria. The Zionists were rewarded by the British and talk of a great Semite<br/>
State disappeared. But the possibilities were there, it was a defining<br/>
moment that was missed, and the people of the Middle East have paid for it<br/>
ever since.<br/>
