<div id="ygrps-yiv-29663716">I had the best day yesterday. Stacie wanted to stay with Martin, so we <br/>
spent the day with Tiffany (our 4 yo). Boy did she bloom in the past 4 <br/>
months! I have a quiet, somewhat sullen child, who never talks loud enough <br/>
for the car radio to be on. <br/>
    She got up yesterday and wanted to know about the lights on the side of a <br/>
smokestack. Yes, I understand they are just beacons, but to Tiff.... WOW! She <br/>
learned how the lights work in the van, what a jump was (yep, our battery <br/>
died...) and even how the &quot;stuff&quot; gets in the filled donuts. This is my <br/>
dream! And Tiffany, again WOW. <br/>
    This AM I am still lightheaded from her. She just sailed through the day. <br/>
I even ?? her on the things we spoke about last night. Other than the <br/>
airplanes flying UNDER the lights (yes, that is backwards, over honey.) she <br/>
was retaining EVERYTHING! Even that Daddy went to the police station and she <br/>
saw pictures of the dogs that work there! YES!!!<br/>
    I had to share this with all of you! For those who met Tiff, you know <br/>
that this is spectacular! For those who haven&#39;t- This is spectacular! LOL <br/>
    A word of note, in proofreading, I see it looks like Dad was in trouble. <br/>
That is not right. Wanted to set record for that. Today will be another <br/>
blooming day for the princess, we will be on the road. I hope she keeps this <br/>
up, I am so amazed, I just had to share! <br/>
<br/>

Isn&#39;t it so cool when you are there to see the lightbulbs flashing in<br/>
their brains!<br/>

The darn trouble with cleaning the house is it gets dirty the next day<br/>
anyway,<br/>
so skip a week if you have to.  The children are the most important<br/>
thing.<br/>
