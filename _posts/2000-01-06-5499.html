<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123849959">Thanks to the many who wrote with kind words for others during this<br/>
Pokemon discussion. I&#39;m really happy to hear so many encouraging voices<br/>
on this list and that there are so many who can politely agree to<br/>
disagree.  It is great that so many feel that the tone of the list is<br/>
important. Thanks for brightening my day! <br/>
