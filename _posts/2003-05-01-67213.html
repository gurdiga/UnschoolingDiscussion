&lt;&lt; Yes,  I&#39;ve been meaning to ask about this too,  Ren has mentioned it also<br/>
 and so has Kathryn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, actually I mentioned Unity. Which is not related in any way to <br/>
Unitarian.....just similar names.<br/>
Unity does use the teachings of Christ, but does not take the Bible <br/>
literally. They explore the symbology in it and believe in a common thread <br/>
among all holy books.<br/>
The concepts are that God is in everyone, throughout all of the universe and <br/>
there is not a judgemental atttitude about other religious/spiritual paths.<br/>
Although most I&#39;ve come in contact with have a very hard time with <br/>
fundamentalists.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, they sell books on Buddhism and other spirituality and religions in <br/>
their bookstore...it&#39;s very open, but still a &quot;christian&quot; church (though not <br/>
considered mainstream at all).<br/>
Many members explore para-psychology, reincarnation and such.<br/>

Oh,  OK,  just me confused.   I&#39;ll do some googling about it.   I don&#39;t<br/>
think there is a Unity church here,  just a Unitarian.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll read up.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I am not really sure <br/>
 that I feel like I need (or want) a church, but the seeming lack <br/>
 of &quot;doctrine&quot; within the UU church did catch my eye.  (Plus the fact <br/>
 that I also found out a small group of secular homeschoolers meet at <br/>
 the UU church here, as well as an astronomy group...two of my <br/>
 passions!)  Any input from an insider (or otherwise) would be great!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I felt the same way about church...wasn&#39;t feeling the need for one at all.<br/>
But a really fabulous person at unschooling.com (AnneO) would occasionally <br/>
mention her church and it surprised me, because of the very open way she was. <br/>
I didn&#39;t figure there was a church like that other than UU, and I had decided <br/>
that wasn&#39;t for me already.<br/>
Unity seemed to fit more of what I needed. And after going a few times I just <br/>
felt I had found my home. It&#39;s more &quot;focused&quot; than UU (for lack of a better <br/>
word) and I enjoyed that part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a link to the Unity School of Christianity, I couldn&#39;t find the <br/>
regular page that I thought was in my favorites. But this explains some Unity <br/>
beliefs and has a search if you want to find a church in your area to see <br/>
what you think.<br/>

&gt; **They celebrate easter, christmas, passover, winter/summer solstices (we<br/>

&gt;  joined another class to decorate easter eggs. :o**<br/>

I have wondered if I should expose my kids to group worship type things but I think they are as reserved as I am. My daughter enjoyed a pagan Beltane celebration a few years back but we were actually<br/>
there cos I was/am a warden of the stone circle where it took place. It was fun to watch but so far I&#39;ve never felt the need for outward stuff. Going somewhere, dressing up in robes, waving staffs about<br/>
type thing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one day.....if it&#39;s not too early ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not really into groups either.  I consider myself a UU, because I&#39;ve<br/>
attended occasionally, and their beliefs really resonate with me.  I<br/>
tell people I&#39;m a &quot;lapsed Unitarian&quot; because I don&#39;t attend these days. <br/>
But now that I&#39;m living in a new town and looking for new friends, I<br/>
think I might start going again, more for the &quot;socialization&quot; than for<br/>
the spiritualization.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley, if you don&#39;t end up going back to the UK right away, you might<br/>
find the UU church (or fellowship) a source of likeminded people in your<br/>
conservative wilderness.  I do think UU&#39;s tend towards being<br/>
left-leaning, bicycle riding, oddly dressed vegetarians.  &lt;g&gt;  You might<br/>
like them.  They don&#39;t all fit that stereotype, but I have really cool<br/>
elderly bike-touring relatives who are active UUs and live in North<br/>
Carolina.  <br/>

You sound like my hubby. :o) He and Jason (6 yo) stay home while<br/>
Kyle (3 yo) and I go. Jason went a couple of times but told me<br/>
that he did not really like having to do the craft project, that<br/>
he would rather just  play cars. Kyle loves playing with his<br/>
friends so we have a fun time.<br/>
<br/>
I find that I do enjoy getting together with others and exploring<br/>
what I believe. I enjoy the rituals (lighting of a chalice, hymns<br/>
etc). I have fond memories of church when I was little, I enjoyed<br/>
youth group and being part of a community. As I got older I just<br/>
found that I did not believe what they talk about at most christian<br/>
churches. <br/>
<br/>
Going to the UU services gives me an opportunity to think about<br/>
what I believe and how I fit in with the great world. It also<br/>
allows lots of chances to get involved with doing good things...<br/>
environmentally, politically and socially that I might not do<br/>
on my own. Not to mention getting to meet lots of people of<br/>
a variety of ages. I also like exposing my kids (well, at least<br/>
Kyle) and myself to a variety of beliefs, many of which I do not<br/>
know that much about.<br/>
<br/>
it is not for everyone though. I have a friend that still found<br/>
it &quot;too churchy&quot; and my hubby just does not need others to<br/>
be explore his beliefs. It has led to some great discussions between<br/>
the two of us which have been really enlightening. <br/>
