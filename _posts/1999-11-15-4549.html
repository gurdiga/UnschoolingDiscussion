<br/>
We disagree immensely.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;  I know I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have had numerous (when young) experiences of just missing out on being<br/>
drugged by my own paranoid tendencies, cookies, punch, bottles of beer,<br/>
I always was paranoid at the right moment on qt least 4 separate<br/>
occasions.  Drugs didn&#39;t agree with me...except alcohol which I<br/>
absolutely loved at first drink. That being said......&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear of your credentials.  I too have had much experience, with<br/>
friends, relatives, and I&#39;ve counseled.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Most people who experiment with drugs (in the broadest definition of<br/>
drugs e.g. nicotine, caffeine, alcohol,) do not become addicted.  Of all<br/>
of the available drugs nicotine is the most addictive and dangerous in<br/>
terms of health consequences.  Alcohol would come second.  &quot;Hard&quot; drugs<br/>
do not come close to destroying as many lives as nicotine and alcohol.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is terribly untrue.  It has now been proven that cocaine is addictive.<br/>
 Acid is horrifically dangerous.  Heroin is addictive...<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, my topic wasn&#39;t on &quot;addiction&quot;.  However, I have known of<br/>
many many high school and college students, who died on their first try -<br/>
healthy (not heart problems or asthmatics.  Athletes were some.  <br/>
<br/>
One experience with acid can result in flashbacks for life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Inhalants are very dangerous.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Glad you agree.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Addicted individuals who are unable to deal with their addictions are<br/>
often people who have histories of physical, mental, emotional, and/ or<br/>
sexual abuse which contributes to their addiction problems.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is grossly untrue!  Again, many casual uses lead to addiction -<br/>
physical addiction (not mental).  I&#39;ve known adults who will admit to being<br/>
raised in as fair a fashion as their siblings, and did not suffer any of<br/>
the things you sight.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless.  Furthermore, it has been proven that certain chemical<br/>
makeups are more prone to certain addictions than others (not all cases,<br/>
some).  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are strong puritanical, anti-pleasure, Calvinistic currents within<br/>
some of the anti-drug thinking that currently holds sway with many<br/>
people.  This confuses the issue and makes it difficult to educate<br/>
people as to the real dangers of drugs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am far far from anti-pleasure.  I thank God for the example he used me as<br/>
in college to show friends that they could have a wonderful and better time<br/>
without drugs and alcohol!<br/>
<br/>
I pray to the good Lord, that my son find pleasure in life and health, and<br/>
the joy - not in drugs.  <br/>
<br/>
Those who chose the advice I mentioned fine.  Those who don&#39;t, fine.  I for<br/>
one am GRATEFUL for all that my father taught me about drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, as a college student, I met many many students who began<br/>
using drugs recreationally, not out of psychological problems.  I know of<br/>
some who became addicted; some who had braindamage from sheer pleasure use<br/>
(not addicted in any way).  Some die; some quit.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Generally people who come from intact, functional families (not a huge<br/>
number) don&#39;t have major drug problems.  Of course many people who come<br/>
from grossly dysfunctional families don&#39;t think that they do because<br/>
mystification is a common phenomena in dysfunctional families.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not true.  And again, &quot;casual&quot; &quot;recreational&quot; use has many many tragedies.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Children have been lied to about the nature of drugs, drug use,<br/>
addiction in the same ways they have been lied to about the nature of<br/>
learning, education, and things as basic as &quot;feelings&quot;.  This greatly<br/>
increases the risks of them throwing out the rational cautions with the<br/>
silly hogwash.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My father did not lie to me, nor do I lie to my son.  I pray to God he<br/>
knows he can enjoy life far and safely with the joy of the Lord and the<br/>
life He has given us, and that drugs could never offer this pleasure, and<br/>
they are dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
As for alcohol, I do not say folks should not drink.  However, when they<br/>
do, they need to be taught NOT to drink and drive.  I&#39;ve know of children<br/>
killed by a drunk driver, out drinking for the &quot;first time&quot;.  There&#39;s a lot<br/>
to be said for first time users of drugs and alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
I would pray that parents would teach their children not to use drugs. <br/>
Furthermore, I recall my parents telling me as a teenager: if I ever wanted<br/>
to smoke cigarettes, I was NEVER to take one from a friend.  They would buy<br/>
them for me.  This was told to me right after they found out I had tried<br/>
smoking.  I had never smoked again.  Nevertheless, I am grateful for what<br/>
they taught me, and for the Lord&#39;s protection.  In this case, I&#39;ve never<br/>
seen in personally, but have heard reliable sources (and my father being a<br/>
police officer and one major source, and none more honest than he, never<br/>
exaggerated or lied about what he saw) aside from my many first hand<br/>
experiences as a teacher, councilor and friend, that folks lace cigarettes<br/>
and than pass them on to friends.<br/>
<br/>
I find it very sad that you link &quot;anti-drug&quot; with &quot;anti-pleasure&quot;. <br/>
Actually, the opposite is true.  My dh was a very strong cocaine user years<br/>
ago.  He did not come from an &quot;abused&quot; family.  He can tell you that true<br/>
pleasure comes when you have a good time with your full faculties<br/>
functioning, and not downed with drugs.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039465328">goodness...again.<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s gone but for the record....<br/>
<br/>
This is terribly untrue.  It has now been proven that cocaine is<br/>
addictive.  Acid is horrifically dangerous.  Heroin is addictive...<br/>
<br/>
Yes of course heroin and cocaine are addictive.  Yes one experience with<br/>
psychedelics can result in lifelong problems.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Addicted individuals who are unable to deal with their addictions are<br/>
often people who have histories of physical, mental, emotional, and/ or<br/>
sexual abuse which contributes to their addiction problems.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is grossly untrue!  Again, many casual uses lead to addiction -<br/>
physical addiction (not mental).  I&#39;ve known adults who will<br/>
admit to being raised in as fair a fashion as their siblings, and did<br/>
not suffer any of the things you sight.<br/>
<br/>
There are certainly people who use drugs casually who become addicted.<br/>
As for self reporting as a means of getting a clear picture of a persons<br/>
history it leaves much to be desired.  I recall one individual telling<br/>
me about her model childhood telling me that I might get to meet her<br/>
mother who would be visiting her in hospital if they could get a matron<br/>
as she was doing time for murder.  However there are of course people<br/>
from pretty stable loving families who have problems with addictions.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless.  Furthermore, it has been proven that certain chemical<br/>
makeups are more prone to certain addictions than others<br/>
(not all cases, some).<br/>
<br/>
We agree. some people are more prone to addiction than others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are strong puritanical, anti-pleasure, Calvinistic currents<br/>
within<br/>
some of the anti-drug thinking that currently holds sway with many<br/>
people.  This confuses the issue and makes it difficult to educate<br/>
people as to the real dangers of drugs.&gt;&gt;  I still stand by this<br/>
statement although certainly people can and do find enormous pleasure<br/>
and joy in living completely drug free.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, as a college student, I met many many students who began<br/>
using drugs recreationally, not out of psychological<br/>
problems.  I know of some who became addicted; some who had braindamage<br/>
from sheer pleasure use (not addicted in any way).<br/>
 Some die; some quit.<br/>
 Yep I agree lots of people use drugs recreationally, those with<br/>
problems fare less well in terms of addiction.  Yep some people brain<br/>
damage themselves from drug use.<br/>
<br/>
My father did not lie to me, nor do I lie to my son.  I pray to God he<br/>
knows he can enjoy life far and safely with the joy of the Lord<br/>
and the life He has given us, and that drugs could never offer this<br/>
pleasure, and they are dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Some people maintain that God created drugs for the use of his people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I find it very sad that you link &quot;anti-drug&quot; with &quot;anti-pleasure&quot;.<br/>
Actually, the opposite is true.  My dh was a very strong cocaine<br/>
user years ago.  He did not come from an &quot;abused&quot; family.<br/>
<br/>
Same problem as above. People have a hard time recognizing abuse when<br/>
they see it.  There are many &quot;normal&quot; ways of raising children which are<br/>
horrendously abusive.  Alice Miller writes extensively on the difficulty<br/>
that people have with identifying the abuse to which they are subjected.<br/>
<br/>
Again putting it all in the big perspective. Many, many thousands more<br/>
people die each year from tobacco related illness than from all of the<br/>
other drug related illnesses, overdoses, sudden deaths, etc. combined.<br/>
60,000 people in Canada alone compared with about 1000 deaths directly<br/>
linked with drug use.  The illness related deaths connected with drug<br/>
use is higher but can&#39;t hold a candle to the big legal killer, champion<br/>
of premature death in the world. Tobacco.<br/>
<br/>
We do disagree immensely.  I can live with this.  I do consider that you<br/>
may be right in your view.  I don&#39;t think so but I have changed my mind<br/>
on a number of subjects on a number of occasions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-248552225">Did you think it was a tirade?  I think I upset her and she disagreed<br/>
immensely.  And maybe when she cools off (if she was hot under the collar)<br/>
she will be back.  I think I may have touched a sensitive area.<br/>
