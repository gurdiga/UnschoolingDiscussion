&gt; The list of things Americans don&#39;t say did get too rough.  Sorry.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to blame Shyrley because she&#39;s English and she asked the question,<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t tone down my response.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I may be way too immune to bad language (I was reared on George Carlin<br/>
albums) to be objective on this, but IMHO neither you nor Shyrley nor anyone<br/>
else in the discussion has anything to apologize for (except maybe out of<br/>
kindness for inadvertantly stomping all over sensibilities, but STILL...<br/>
nah.)<br/>
<br/>
This is a discussion, interesting to some and no doubt not to others, on an<br/>
adult mailing list. If it&#39;s so awful people feel the need to unsubscribe, I<br/>
feel for their state of mind as they go through everyday life in this wicked<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Just skip the thread if you find it boring or offensive. Heaven (no pun<br/>
intented) knows religion posts put MY teeth to sleep and I get myself over<br/>
it.<br/>

Pam, tetchy</div>
