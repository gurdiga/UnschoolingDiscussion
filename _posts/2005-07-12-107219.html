<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273936678">Oops, sorry I forgot to insert &quot;San Francisco Bay Area Unschoolers <br/>
Potluck...&quot;   Of course if you want to come from Australia, we&#39;d be delighted!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Almost time for the Unschoolers Potluck Supper and Games:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wed. July 13, starting at 5 PM at Redwood Park in Oakland.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We will meet at Redwood Park&#39;s Roberts Recreation Area, in the picnic<br/>
&gt;area above the parking lot (the grassy field by the playground near<br/>
&gt;Roberts Pool). For more information about the location, please see<br/>
&gt;www.ebparks.org/parks/robrec.htm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please bring:<br/>
&gt;     * a dish to share,<br/>
&gt;     * something to drink,<br/>
&gt;     * a picnic blanket and/or folding chairs,<br/>
&gt;     * your own plates and eating utensils<br/>
&gt;     * flashlight for flashlight tag, if desired<br/>
&gt;     * any other games/rec equipment you want<br/>
&gt;There may be a charge for parking, so please be prepared with small bills<br/>
&gt;or coins (or East Bay Parks card).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;re planning a get-to-know-each-other game (optional, of course), hoping<br/>
&gt;to keep it not too long or lame, but just as a way to get to know each<br/>
&gt;other more easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ll also bring a big parachute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any questions?  Please contact either Robyn Talman at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ratalman@...">ratalman@...</a> or<br/>
&gt;Pam Tellew at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamtellew@...">pamtellew@...</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We hope to see you there!<br/>
&gt;Robyn Talman and Pam Tellew<br/>
