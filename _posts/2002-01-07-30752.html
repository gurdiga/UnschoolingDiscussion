&gt;I&#39;m wondering...if you think TV watching is dangerous to children...do you<br/>
&gt;mean &#39;all TV viewing&#39;?  ALL children?  all ages?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hello all... I&#39;d like to tell you of _our_ experience with TV.<br/>
<br/>
Children model. And they also pursue life as passionately (or <br/>
dispassionately) as their parents.<br/>
<br/>
My son has recently become an advid TV viewer. Like 5 hours + a day at <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
We were in Canada for 3 weeks and he watched it for a total of 3 hours. <br/>
He had children to play with, a fun house to visit - roasting <br/>
marshmellows on the wood stove, snowball fights with crayola modeling <br/>
clay, kids are allowed to take apart the couches and cushions for forts <br/>
as long as they get put back etc. (get the pix?) And three other children <br/>
of various ages around.<br/>
<br/>
I admit, there are times when a particular TV show might come on and I <br/>
stop what I&#39;m doing and watch it. Also, he may try to ask something of me <br/>
and I might not give him my 100% in my answer (yes, yes, I definately <br/>
have my *darker* side at times when reacting to situations). And I have <br/>
definately corrected the TV thing BUT...<br/>
<br/>
As far as his father *yikes!*<br/>
Here&#39;s a man who turns on the TV as soon as he walks in from work, stays <br/>
up late watching it (even when his son says - papa, were going to bed <br/>
now, do you want to join us) and THEN complains the kid watches too much.<br/>
<br/>
He hasn&#39;t correlated his moodiness to the TV viewing either. You know, he <br/>
gets grumpy, were playing games making noise having a blast, he comes in <br/>
and barks all over our parade, we go watch TV until the grumpiness leaves.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, TV won&#39;t be a big deal when there&#39;s lots of happiness, <br/>
lightness, activities, other children, and lovely things of such going on.<br/>
<br/>
If it is an issue, then look deeply at yourself, look deeply at the <br/>
atmosphere in the house, look deeply at the situation.<br/>
<br/>
IF you can take all of them and say the kid has options, the house is <br/>
light, there are children around THEN let him watch TV. He&#39;s choosing it <br/>
as a qualified choice. Not as an escape option.<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,<br/>

I didn&#39;t mean to leave your circumstance out of this. My apologies.<br/>
<br/>
As you have stated in your last post on how you watched your son go from <br/>
happy to sad and all the other pains that come with that.<br/>

Its hard to list the alternate circumstances as there are with any <br/>
conversation. That is, and still keep the conversation on a certain path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887025524">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Back to TV again. My kids have free access to TV, unlimited time and channels, and we have digital cable - many channels.<br/>
<br/>
Today they watched TV for probably less than an hour while eating breakfast. They left the room where the TV was to do other things. I turned the TV off because no one was watching it. It hasn&#39;t come back on all day. We are listening to Styx greatest hits at the moment. The kids are eating a late lunch and singing along. Earlier today my 8 yos begged me to do schoolwork with him. We did a math page and a spelling lesson and he opted for a spelling test with 20 words (got 5 wrong - but 15 right!) They are now done eating and still singing along and playing indoor hockey in the hallway.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow they may choose to watch more TV, or less or none. I don&#39;t really keep track. Who knows what the day will bring. It&#39;s exciting not knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Life is great. Life is good. TV is not sensationalized in our house, it&#39;s just another thing to do out of many other things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Karin<br/>
having a great Monday because we are unschooling<br/>

I think you&#39;re right, Kolleen. There is usually something to be discovered<br/>
(rectified, addressed... choose your word)  when a child displays an<br/>
insatiable appetite for tv.<br/>
De-schooling is rectifying a problem and part of that process is that a<br/>
child will usually zone out for awhile. Most of these kids will do this by<br/>
watching a lot of tv. If the kid continues on for what the parent considers<br/>
an unreasonable amount of time (I&#39;m thinking over a year here but each<br/>
family differs), then the parents might need to look at all the other<br/>
factors that could be causing (or has caused) this child to escape from his<br/>
reality.  That could be a traumatic event that happened at school or home. <br/>
In most cases, though, the tv becomes just another tool to use or enjoy. I<br/>
remember taking a field trip several years ago to the local tv station. We<br/>
gathered in the lobby to wait for everybody to get there and naturally,<br/>
there was a big-screen tv for all to view. The kids who had limited tv were<br/>
GLUED to the tube and were like zombies when somebody spoke to them. The<br/>
kids who were *not* limited with tv were more interested in the surroundings<br/>
and how things work, etc. It was interesting to watch because there was not<br/>
just two families involved (one tv and one not) but an entire group of<br/>
unschoolers! I reinforced my belief to not limit tv.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652789951">Hi Sarah,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate here, but could the reason the TV was limited for those particular children have been because they are particularly sensitive to TV type stimuli?  Just a thought.  My nephew has no limits placed on him (for anything), my children have some, when my girls spent the week with him this past summer, they wound up playing games and doing things with their aunt because their cousin was too busy watching TV or playing video games.  When we see him at the grandmothers house, he is fun to play with because the TV is not on although, during a few hour visits with us this past Christmas, he warned us that he would not respond to anyone while &quot;The Simpson&#39;s&quot; were on.  Not a healthy situation in my opinion.  This boy is an only child and has grown too accustomed to these things for entertainment.  I agree with Kolleen about the need for the environment to be full of stimulating things for kids to do including other kids to play with however once the pattern is set with too much TV, it might be hard to break.  What do you think?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

readily come to mind are situations where the parents can&#39;t stand to hear<br/>
the constant noise of tv or they find little value in the shows.  <br/>

So I would be looking at the parents of this kid and wondering why they aren<br/>
t taking him out and about to stimulate some interests other than tv.  Why<br/>
isn&#39;t he building with legos? Why isn&#39;t he building a soapbox car? Why isn&#39;t<br/>
he pulling out a game he normally plays every Friday night with his Dad? Why<br/>
isn&#39;t hetelling your kids about some cool secret passage he&#39;s just<br/>
discovered in the computer game, Myst? Is this a public schooled kid? Is he<br/>
using his outside-of-school time just to chill? Has he already been<br/>
conditioned into thinking that a social life is when kids similar in age are<br/>
lined up side by side but not interacting; rather thay are staring at the<br/>
front of the room/tv? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also agree with Kolleen that the environment needs to be a stimulating one<br/>
and we (parents) should be taking the kids out to various places (science<br/>
museums, clubs, art galleries, etc.) These can be things the parent is<br/>
interested in, not necessarily the children although often the kids will<br/>
develop an interest when exposed to something new.  I love to do art stuff<br/>
and I take the kids with me to all sorts of places to get inspiration and<br/>
new ideas. My kids also see things on tv that generate an interst and it&#39;s<br/>
my job to take that opportunity to expand their world in that area. (note:<br/>
and to also realize when it&#39;s just a passing curiosity and not a real<br/>
passion. In other words, don&#39;t go out and buy some expensive item just<br/>
because they said &quot;I wonder...&quot; about it. Wait for some &#39;truer&#39; signs)<br/>

<br/>
I agree. But then again, I think you might be thinking of kids such as the<br/>
cousin you mentioned (see above numerous questions as my response. Usually,<br/>
imo, there is an underlying reason for somebody to want to vegg out on tv.<br/>
Get to the root of the situation and you have the answers.<br/>

My dd is in the same grade as he is and this summer when they visited she had not been homeschooled yet.  My kids have always played with each other or friends but I made sure there was a balance.  My nephew has always been able to do what ever he wants. His mother tried to take him to museums and other outside places but he never wants to leave the house so they don&#39;t go.  They even took him to a phychologist to make sure his behavior was normal.  The guy said he really doesn&#39;t have any problems.  The questions you asked are why isn&#39;t he pulling out the legos, the soapbox car, or the game?  My question is why isn&#39;t his mother talking to him about this?  Why is she doing everything for him, even playing with his cousins.  Maybe the problem is in the fact that he is not asked to contribute to the family in any way.  They have a cleaning lady and he never has to pick up after himself.  His parents even tie his shoes for him when he asks.  They figure when he is ready to do it himself he will.  I don&#39;t see him develping any coping skills.   <br/>
<br/>
These are such complicated issues.  Why do some kids thrive in an environment with many choices and other kids find it overwhelming.  I have another nephew whose parents have asked nothing of him.  Everything they did was to make his life easier.  He is now 15 and had to be admitted to a mental facility for severe depression and anxiety.  The diagnoses is that he has no coping skills and that he needs them to be able to deal with teenage issues. This is a little off the TV topic but I think it has some relevance.<br/>

the few occasions these kids had to watch. I don&#39;t think you can make any <br/>
long-term generalizations, though, about what all this means in the long<br/>
run. <br/>
<br/>
I have two old friends who grew up w/limited TV in their homes. I<br/>
always felt sorry for them bc they weren&#39;t allowed to watch as much as<br/>
I was. I knew both of these women in high school and we all went to<br/>
college together. Both spent a lot of time watching TV freshman year, as I<br/>
remember (this was also the early days of MTV). After this period of<br/>
initial bingeing, both went on to develop their adult viewing habits; <br/>
one of them is a moderate watcher today, the other has no TV in her home. <br/>
But overall, who spent more time, and IMO wasted more time, watching TV in<br/>
those formative early years? Who spent more time reading, playing and<br/>
doing, IMO again, more worthwhile things? I don&#39;t think their being<br/>
limited in their TV watching had negative effects on them being able to<br/>
make choices for themselves, either as kids or adults, bc they had freedom<br/>
in other areas of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I don&#39;t think those kids being glued to the TV is<br/>
indicative of much, in the long run. Just my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
I believe that kids like the one you have described are not so unusual; they<br/>
are just &#39;screaming&#39; louder than the others that they hate being controlled!<br/>
They use *any* situation they can to regain control.... even to go to the<br/>
lengths of contolling Mommie to tie his shoes! There so precious little that<br/>
he has control over, it&#39;s like he is willing to do anything to feel in<br/>
charge somehow.  To make him do chores (and not have the cleaning lady)<br/>
would only add more to his overloaded plate of being out of control. NOT<br/>
that I think kids shouldn&#39;t have responsibilities at home... I do. But this<br/>
particular situation you mention is all about a kid rebelling the way he<br/>
knows how to his life situation.  Your dd, who has been controlled in the<br/>
same way is more adaptable and more of a person who doesn&#39;t resent being<br/>
told what to do. (will I get torched by the list if I point out that most<br/>
women are categorized as &quot;people pleasers?&quot; :(  )<br/>
I just remembered reading something ages ago when my kids were babies...<br/>
something along the lines that babies need to feel secure. If they don&#39;t,<br/>
they act out, hoping to get some feedback from the parents that offers them<br/>
a secure feeling.  *Maybe* that&#39;s the problem with this kid. <br/>
Just to relate this back to the thread we were on, you could also say that<br/>
unlimited tv for an infant is bad; the infant is dependent on the parents to<br/>
take care of him... and that includes taking him out and exposing him to<br/>
things other than tv. At some point, though, the infant becomes a child and<br/>
will learn self-control, responsibility and all the other stuff we&#39;ve been<br/>
saying that some of us believe (and that is, that elementary aged kids are<br/>
old enough to be self-limiting with tv, given other alternatives are present<br/>
.. trips outside the house, a set of legos and games available, etc. ).<br/>

sure his behavior was normal.  The guy said he really doesn&#39;t have any<br/>
problems.  The questions you asked are why isn&#39;t he pulling out the legos,<br/>
the soapbox car, or the game?  My question is why isn&#39;t his mother talking<br/>
to him about this?  Why is she doing everything for him, even playing with<br/>
his cousins.  Maybe the problem is in the fact that he is not asked to<br/>
contribute to the family in any way.  They have a cl! eaning lady and he<br/>
never has to pick up after himself.  His parents even tie his shoes for him<br/>
when he asks.  They figure when he is ready to do it himself he will.  I don<br/>
t see him develping any coping skills.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are such complicated issues.  Why do some kids thrive in an<br/>
environment with many choices and other kids find it overwhelming.  I have<br/>
another nephew whose parents have asked nothing of him.  Everything they did<br/>
was to make his life easier.  He is now 15 and had to be admitted to a<br/>
mental facility for severe depression and anxiety.  The diagnoses is that he<br/>
has no coping skills and that he needs them to be able to deal with teenage<br/>
issues. This is a little off the TV topic but I think it has some relevance<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again... somewhere along the line, an individual needs to be given choices<br/>
(do you want peas or potatoes?... to a toddler). Then you progress from <br/>
this or that&quot; choices to a broader spectrum... (what would you like for<br/>
dinner tonight?). If you&#39;ve never had to choose between peas or potatoes,<br/>
how the hell are ya gonna choose between more weightier issues faced in the<br/>
teen years?!<br/>
I hope I&#39;m making sense. I am in my mind but with the keyboard and without<br/>
facial expressions and my wild hand gestures, who knows! &lt;g&gt; <br/>

rather protect his mind and spirit now, in what I perceive to be these<br/>
crucial early years. If that means it&#39;ll take him longer to learn<br/>
that TV isn&#39;t magical and wonderful, so be it. It&#39;s a small price to pay,<br/>
for me, since I think the effects of TV are a lot more harmful than most<br/>
parents do.<br/>

<br/>
BTW, I appreciate the overall anti-flame tone of this list. It&#39;s great to<br/>
be able to argue points w/out folks getting personal and nasty. Despite<br/>
restricted bedtimes and limited TV, I&#39;m pretty much a hardcore unschooler<br/>
in every other way I can think of. But y&#39;all have definitely made me<br/>
think. If I ever ever experiment and decide to take away those<br/>
restrictions, I will definitely keep you all apprised.<br/>

It&#39;s difficult to talk about specific children/families because we&#39;re all<br/>
different.  However, the way Sarah phrased it above is true no matter whose<br/>
children/families we&#39;re talking about.<br/>

those other station &quot;nuts.&quot;  So they got me hooked on the Trading Spaces<br/>

At anyrate, kidlet #5 asked me to watch tv with him about 2 months ago and<br/>
we were flipping through the stations looking for something to watch and we<br/>
thought we found a pretty good movie.  I mean, Keifer Southerland isn&#39;t<br/>
exactly a television series person and who&#39;da thought this CIA/spy thriller<br/>
type thing would be a series and not a movie.<br/>
<br/>
It is called 24 and is about 24 hours in the life of this agent.  Each show<br/>
is exactly one hour out of the 24 hours in his life.  Kewl concept complete<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415098036">Ahem..And in this house it is Survivor and ER..<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is fascinated with Maternity ward and trauma; life in the ER as well, she watches those and Zoom most often (When she&#39;s not watching SpongeBob Squarepants..Someone please show me the educational portion of that show??? I loathe it :(...but we dont limit it during the day, at night though we do since we now have only 1 tv, she has to &#39;share&#39; with us then!)<br/>

  Hi Nichoel :-)<br/>
<br/>
  I SO abhorred that show. I thought it was gross, not funny, &quot;off&quot;. This is<br/>
  strange because I, as well as my entire family, are a bit &quot;off&quot; and we<br/>
  embrace weirdness. This show just really got on my nerves. Then, after<br/>
  listening to the kids and my husband laughing about it and talking about it,<br/>
  I found myself watching one of the shows while knitting one evening. It was<br/>
  something about swearing, and one of the creatures on the show, when asked<br/>
  what &quot;that&quot; was, said &quot;oh, THOSE are &quot;sentence enhancers&quot;, you just sprinkle<br/>
  a little bit on top of anything you say, and *POOF*, you&#39;ve got yourself a<br/>
  spicy sentence sandwich!&quot; So then Sponge Bob was walking all over the place<br/>
  swearing. The swearing was actually bleeped with babbles of nonsense. At the<br/>
  end, another one of the creatures explains to Sponge Bob that they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
  be talking like that. I tell you, I was laughing so hard! I still don&#39;t care<br/>
  much for the animation, but I see the humor in a lot of it. I am trying to<br/>
  stick with a &quot;laughter is the best medicine&quot; mindset regarding the show now.<br/>
<br/>
  Take care,<br/>
