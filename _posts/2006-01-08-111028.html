<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025105201">It&#39;s Elvis&#39;s birthday.  He&#39;s dead, so he doesn&#39;t care, but it would  <br/>
have been his birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I was never a big Elvis fan, though I know many of the songs in the  <br/>
visceral way that people know familiar recordings and if you&#39;re  <br/>
hearing an alternate version it&#39;s jarring.  My favorite ever is &quot;I  <br/>
Can&#39;t Help Falling in Love With You.&quot;  I like his recording, and I  <br/>
much enjoy UB40&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So I was letting my thoughts zing here and there, as they do, and  <br/>
&quot;letting them&quot; is an odd thought because they just do it, and  <br/>
thinking about memories and connections and unschooling.   I have  <br/>
some newly-thought thoughts about it, but first I want to exhume and  <br/>
put here something I wrote a long time back, and will post the other  <br/>
in other places.<br/>
<br/>
This is here, too:<br/>

(there&#39;s more at the website, and where it says &quot;back to the present&quot;  <br/>
below it means back to the present when it was published years ago)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How Elvis Appears to Unschoolers<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once long ago, in 1993, on Prodigy&#39;s Homeschooling bulletin board, I  <br/>
wrote this, and it conjured Elvis:<br/>
Some time back there was a request for songs to be sung which would  <br/>
be educational. As music itself is a discipline, I think any music  <br/>
can be used as an educational tool. It can tie in with physical  <br/>
activity, mathematics, physics, history, geography, art, language,  <br/>
and it can be used to get kids excited and awake, or calm and asleep,  <br/>
or anything in between. I don&#39;t mean singing about math or history,  <br/>
either, but discussing the form of the music, the rhythm, the moods,  <br/>
the origins, the instruments on which it is traditionally played, the  <br/>
length and pattern of the verses (or phrases, or whatever), what its  <br/>
purpose is (a march, background music for a movie or for an 18th  <br/>
century fireworks show, a lullaby, a love song), etc.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t miss this fun and easy opportunity to tie different &quot;subjects&quot;  <br/>
together by using a song as a jumping off place to many different  <br/>
discussions. If you need ideas, name a song here and see how many  <br/>
suggestions you can get for it!<br/>
<br/>
So that sat out in public for nearly two hours before someone wrote.  <br/>
&quot;Ok, I&#39;ll try that. &#39;Blue Suede Shoes&#39;.&quot;<br/>
I had never been an Elvis fan. Still, it was rich with potential. The  <br/>
next ten paragraphs here were the response:<br/>
<br/>
Look up pictures of the 50&#39;s. What was happening in those days? Where  <br/>
did Elvis Presley come from?<br/>
<br/>
What was the deal with Black music in those days? What was new that  <br/>
benefited Elvis&#39;s career? (Television! Cheap color movies!) How was  <br/>
his induction into the army (combined with his popularity) used by  <br/>
the government? Find some old magazines with articles showing him in  <br/>
uniform, in his barracks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What is suede, anyway? How is it made? How far back in history was  <br/>
there suede? How is leather tanned? How would suede be made blue? How  <br/>
does dye work? (Visit Tandy leather, or a shoe repair place. Tie-dye  <br/>
something.)<br/>
<br/>
Talk about slang. Much of what was slang in the 50&#39;s is mainstream  <br/>
English now. What is slang that hasn&#39;t yet died out or been accepted  <br/>
by a larger group?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready and [go,  <br/>
cat] go&quot;: With &quot;four to go,&quot; what is that used for outside this song?  <br/>
Is it fair to just steal words from just anywhere for song lyrics?  <br/>
Sure it is! Look for some other examples. (It might take months of  <br/>
casual listening to find another example, but there are lots.)<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;slander&quot;? (Check &quot;libel&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
If the children are trained in music, you can talk about syncopation.  <br/>
If they&#39;re up on music technology, discuss the simple mixing that  <br/>
went on at recording studios in the 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s, before  <br/>
stereo was common (and before mono was no more). Listen to the  <br/>
quality of the bass line and compare it to a modern recording with a  <br/>
broader spectrum and newer technology on storage and playback. Find  <br/>
something that explains how magnetic tape works for sound recording  <br/>
and CD&#39;s and phonograph records. (Usborne&#39;s music and science books  <br/>
have some stuff about this, and encyclopedias have too.)<br/>
<br/>
What instrument did Elvis Presley play? Do you have a guitar at your  <br/>
house, and could the kids learn a few chords? (Blue Suede Shoes can  <br/>
be played with four, I think, in a simplified form.) What other  <br/>
instruments are on the recording? What time signature is the song in?  <br/>
What key? How could you find out? (pitch pipe, keyboard)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the difference between rock&#39;n&#39;roll and jazz? Blues? (This  <br/>
might be easier by identifying samples-i.e. multiple choice-than by  <br/>
definition.)<br/>
<br/>
These are just the things I&#39;m thinking of as fast as I can type. Some  <br/>
would be too hard for some kids, some might not interest the parents  <br/>
or kids, but every one could lead to something else, which could lead  <br/>
to something else again. Looking through old Life or Look magazines  <br/>
would reveal lots of civil rights activity, the Korean War, the first  <br/>
days of Camp David, advertisements for modern gas appliances,  <br/>
discussions of the new suburban homes (40-yr-old houses, shown as  <br/>
brand new cutting-edge technology), and advertisements for  <br/>
automobiles (with the prices, even in those days), and Elvis might be  <br/>
just a tiny thought on the side of learning about the 50&#39;s. How did I  <br/>
do? Others should add more!<br/>
<br/>
So, back to the present now, I was amazed at how much had poured out.  <br/>
That led to my &quot;Everything is Educational&quot; belief which has turned  <br/>
into folders and workshops. Elvis had finally really captured my  <br/>
attention.<br/>
A few years later my kids asked about Hawaii and were amazed that I  <br/>
was already alive when Hawaii became a state and remembered reading  <br/>
about it in Weekly Reader at school. &quot;Tell us more.&quot; I thought of  <br/>
Elvis again, and went and rented &quot;Blue Hawaii.&quot; We ate pineapple. I  <br/>
found an umbrella I had bought at a thrift shop that was manufactured  <br/>
in Hawaii before statehood. That started our &quot;unit&quot; on Hawaii, but as  <br/>
I explained things to them ideas were coming together and being taken  <br/>
apart in my own mind.<br/>
<br/>
When &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; was new, Americans were seeing some of their first  <br/>
BIG, color photos of Hawaii, and some of their first moving footage.  <br/>
TV was still in black and white, and newspapers were too. Even most  <br/>
magazines were full of black and white photographs.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about Germany, the Berlin Wall, prejudice, colonization,  <br/>
plantations, volcanos, latitude, oceanography, music, fashion,  <br/>
realities in wealthy families which don&#39;t apply to poorer familes,  <br/>
cultural traditions, the changing culture after WWII... We talked  <br/>
about commercial airlines, engineering and economics. We got more out  <br/>
of a movie that was never intended (except for the tolerance and anti- <br/>
prejudice messages) than I expected we would. And still I left things  <br/>
out. The actress wasn&#39;t really half Hawaiian (I&#39;m guessing), but I  <br/>
left that for my kids to figure out later on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Part of what this sort of exploration takes is the willingness to let  <br/>
go of an &quot;outline&quot; or of a hope that you will find something, and an  <br/>
ability to go with what you do find. It&#39;s the big airplane hangar  <br/>
door to unschooling, through which, if you can leave the schoolish  <br/>
building your own mind has built, which has &quot;academics&quot; sorted and  <br/>
stacked against old walls with bad memories, you can see that light  <br/>
of the real world outside. Just move out toward those cliffs and  <br/>
flowers and see what kind of birds are out there.<br/>
<br/>
So take up a glass of pineapple juice while &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; blares  <br/>
in the background. Here&#39;s hoping you see Elvis soon!<br/>
<br/>

  If you&#39;re feeling interested in statistics, and are up for a good laugh, google &quot;Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&quot;  It&#39;s a website regarding a letter that was written to the Kansas City School Board about teaching intelligent design/Creationism in science classes.  In any event, there&#39;s a really funny part in which the author makes a correlation between global warming and pirates.  Give it a read, if you like.  :) <br/>

<br/>
I can even tie that to the conference!:) We stopped there in 1998 on<br/>
our way to Springfield and then again this October, on our way to St.<br/>
Louis for Live and Learn.<br/>
<br/>
Aaron Jansen was traveling with us from Pensacola, and we stayed in a<br/>
hotel right up the street from Graceland. We drove past it in the<br/>
morning so he could say he&#39;d seen it...he&#39;d been through Memphis many<br/>
times and never saw Graceland.:)<br/>
<br/>
But it wasn&#39;t Elvis that we were excited about that day..it was the<br/>
Peabody ducks. So off to the Peabody hotel we went.<br/>

  Several years ago I drove my daughters to Memphis because they were enchanted with Brittany Spears at the time and she was there in concert.  What turned out to be the most fun for all of us was hanging out on Beale street and seeing the musicians just stop on a corner and play a sax or trumpet,it was great!  The cajun food was awesome as well.  The second thing they loved most was the Peabody Hotel because of the ducks.  We have more photos of the ducks than we do anything else:0)  We never made it to Graceland either.  I love going on trips that don&#39;t have an itinerary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898409243">I&#39;ve never been an Elvis fan. I was born in 1975 and I have no idea of just when he died. I don&#39;t get the idolization of a guy just because of his singing voice, particularly as he spiraled into drug abuse and other problems before he died. <br/>
   <br/>
  That said...We used to live in Homosassa, FL and my husband worked at the Coast Guard station up the road in Yankeetown. To get to Yankeetown, you pass through Inglis. Inglis&#39;s claim to fame is proudly announced on a marker board that Elvis filmed a movie there. I couldn&#39;t tell you which one though. <br/>
   <br/>
  That&#39;s as close as I&#39;ve gotten to the whole Elvis thing other than occasionally saying &quot;Thank you, thank you very much&quot; in jest on occasion. <br/>

While I&#39;m not a huge Elvis fan (I adore some of his music though) and<br/>
I think the idolization can get nutso, I also know his hugeness is not<br/>
&quot;just because of his singing voice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you understand the culture and history, surrounding his generation<br/>
and music of the time, you&#39;ll understand just how revolutionary he<br/>
was, in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
Look him up at Wikipedia, it&#39;s pretty good, here&#39;s an excerpt:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to Rolling Stone magazine &quot;it was Elvis who made rock &#39;n&#39;<br/>
roll the international language of pop.&quot; A PBS documentary once<br/>
described Presley as &quot;an American music giant of the 20th century who<br/>
singlehandedly changed the course of music and culture in the mid-1950s.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883351170">Elvis (from the many documentaries I&#39;ve endured that my husband  loves...LOL) <br/>
took a lot of his ideas and style of music from the Black culture  he grew up <br/>
around.  That&#39;s part of the reason he was so controversial,  especially being <br/>
from the south.<br/>
 <br/>
I saw a comedy recording of Billy Connelly, and he said when Elvis came on  <br/>
the scene it was like going from this mild sort of Perry Como stuff to  <br/>
gutteral ROCK AND ROLL...(not his words, but can&#39;t explain the way he  did.)  He said <br/>
it felt like they finally had their OWN music instead of  their parents <br/>
music.  <br/>

and I remember the hoopla surrounding his arrival in our fair city.  I <br/>
also remember exactly where I was when I found out he was dead (kinda <br/>
like others have that JFK memory) and how sad it was for him to die when <br/>
he was fat and ugly, a far cry from the beautiful young man he used to <br/>
be (I always linked musicians to how I saw my daddy - a young Johnny <br/>
Cash or a young Elvis). <br/>
<br/>
My favorite Elvis story (though it may be untrue...) is him getting <br/>
arrested for lewd behavior (the whole pelvis shaking thing) and how a <br/>
strip of heater hose was discovered in his pants &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lilo and Stich, my kids are Elvis experts!  They have no ties <br/>
to the &quot;purity&quot; of his music and love the remakes/remixes on the <br/>
soundtrack.  We&#39;ve had great talks on the Beatles vs Elvis camps of <br/>
Gramma&#39;s time and how most of this area stuck by the &quot;All American&quot; <br/>
young man and completely rejected &quot;those foreigners,&quot; which is why I <br/>
grew up with very little Beatles music in my life (though Grampa played <br/>
a lot of Hank Williams for me and I can&#39;t quite understand why Hank <br/>
would be thought of as a good role model for anyone...&lt;g&gt;)<br/>

became his own person, and made his own kind of music, very different from his  <br/>
father.  Right at the peak of everything he fell from a cliff and badly  <br/>
disfigured his face.  That&#39;s why he has such a heavy beard, dark glasses,  longer <br/>
hair and a hat all the time.  There&#39;s a pretty good biographical  movie about <br/>
him starring Richard Thomas (John Boy).<br/>
 <br/>
No one is perfect, but I&#39;d say he did a few things OK.  My husband  actually <br/>
met him when he was performing for Marines overseas in Japan, and  said he was <br/>
very friendly and good to his fans.  I don&#39;t know as much about  his dad <br/>
though, so the whole point may be mute if the post was about him!!<br/>

I met John Boy and used to have his autograph around here somewhere and I  <br/>
was almost an extra in a movie he made in the town I went to high school  in.  I <br/>
rode my bike to town and watched the filming every day for  about a week.  <br/>
Dennis Quaid was in it, too, but I didn&#39;t know that until  recently.  I really <br/>
wish NOW I had known who Dennis Quaid was then!<br/>

&gt;&gt;and  I can&#39;t quite understand why Hank<br/>
&gt;&gt;would be thought of as a good role  model for anyone..&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;Was the original post about Hank Sr. or Hank Jr.?  I know that Hank  Jr. was <br/>
&gt;very manipulated by his mother (who wanted him to be a carbon copy of  his <br/>
&gt;dad, mostly for the money). <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was Hank Sr -- I grew up knowing the words to &quot;Whiskey Weed Women&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;m sure my grampa would have freaked if he ever heard Snoop Doggy Dogg <br/>
singing &quot;Gin & Juice&quot; but I guess the topic was okay for ol&#39; Hank &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
on an aside: has anyone else heard the country version of Gin & Juice??  <br/>
It&#39;s hilarious!  It&#39;s by The Gourds. <br/>

  It&#39;s one of our all-time faves here...we like to compare the two versions.  My girls love to jam out in the van when it comes on. ;-)<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for the heads-up on the band, BTW...we have seen Phish AND Government Mule credited as doing the bluegrass version, but we&#39;d never seen the Gourds listed.   <br/>
