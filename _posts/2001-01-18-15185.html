      </span>Welcome to the online news source for anyone who drinks milk or 
      consumes other dairy products&#8230;and depends on the news media to report 
      suspected health concerns accurately and honestly.</p>
      <p class="ygrps-yiv-1477809464MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span

      </span>Here you will find behind-the-scenes details about how a large 
      share of America&#8217;s milk supply has quietly become adulterated with the 
      effects of a synthetic hormone (bovine growth hormone, or BGH) secretly 
      injected into cows&#8230;and how pressure from the hormone maker Monsanto led 
      Fox TV to fire two of its award-winning reporters and sweep under the rug 
      much of what they discovered but were never allowed to broadcast.<span

 color="#ff0000">After a five-week trial and six hours of deliberation which 
      ended August 18, 2000, a Florida state court jury unanimously determined 
      that Fox &quot;acted intentionally and deliberately to falsify or distort the 
      plaintiffs&#39; news reporting on BGH.&quot;&nbsp; In that decision, the jury also 
      found that Jane&#39;s threat to blow the whistle on Fox&#39;s misconduct to the 
      FCC was the sole reason for the termination... and the jury awarded 
      awarded $425,000 in damages which makes her eligible to apply for 
      reimbursement for all court costs, expenses and legal 
      fees.<br><br></font><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span>The whistle-blowing journalists, twice refused Fox offers of 
      big-money deals to keep quiet about what they knew, filed their landmark 
      lawsuit April 2, 1998 and survived three Fox efforts to have their case 
      summarily dismissed.&nbsp; It is the first time journalists have used a 
      whistleblower law to seek a legal remedy for being fired by for refusing 
      to distort the 
      news.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      journalists, who happen to be married to each other, have not been offered 
      full-time work in the mainstream media since their experience at Fox and 
      in court.&nbsp; This website, created by former television news producer 
      Jon Duffey, was posted on the day the whistleblower suit was filed.&nbsp; 
      It continues to provide details of the suit and subsequent appeals, as 
      well as recent developments regarding rBGH and other genetically 
      engineered foods.&nbsp;</p>
