That&#39;s not unschooling.  That&#39;s a school.<br/>
<br/>
People on this list are everywhere, all over, not in Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested in reading this list to learn more, that&#39;s great.  You <br/>
really should!<br/>

<br/>
Thank You. <br/>
<br/>
The central question in this work, (the question that defines what we are and <br/>
what we are doing) is whether we hold an agenda for the child. A Full Table <br/>
does not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833613759">go to www.afulltable.com and click on &quot;slide show&quot; for pictures which some may have found not a child friendly environment. <br/>
<br/>
There is also a link on the left side of the homepage for &quot;founders&quot;  and also for &quot;staff&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I get the feeling this is a new endeavor with perhaps not many students as yet?<br/>
<br/>
Like I said,  NOT unschooling, but definitely &quot;out of the box&quot;  for those families who seek an alternative school and have the financial resources to  choose whatever they wish :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Boarding schools for 4 year olds are not unheard of.  Particularly from an <br/>
international perspective.   It may not be unschooling but I am glad to hear <br/>
of interest in establishing an alternative to heavily structured residential <br/>

grandchildren or wards.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.<br/>
<br/>
And if one of my kids for some reason really couldn&#39;t stand being here <br/>
because of a sibling and I had the money to send him or her off to give that <br/>
one and the other sibling some space, a swimming pool in Arizona would be <br/>
Holly&#39;s choice, probably.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, if there were lots more Summerhill kinds of schools, what would <br/>
become of unschooling.    DJ Brewer (probably not on this list) has taken in <br/>
lots of kids at her house, starting with one extra to her four, and then <br/>
another extra, and eventually they bought a bigger house, and... one thing <br/>
led to another and now he has a school.  It&#39;s a LOT like unschooling, but <br/>
there are realities of having other people&#39;s kids in that make it not at all <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting ebb and flow, thinking about what would be better in <br/>
larger groups, and then what the larger group will affect, etc.<br/>

main reasons for keeping my boys home is that I wanted to be a parent.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t want someone else &quot;raising&quot; my boys for 8 hours a day.  I wanted to be <br/>
their guiding light.<br/>
