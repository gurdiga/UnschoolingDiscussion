<div id="ygrps-yiv-634732830">Good Morning!<br/>
<br/>
I just joined the list and have checked out the website. Very<br/>
impressive. I am involved in a couple of other homeschool/unschool email<br/>
loops, but this one is by far the most active! I honestly don&#39;t know if<br/>
I&#39;ll be able to keep up with it, even in digest form. I&#39;ll try....<br/>
<br/>
I am 44 yrs old and live outside of Charleston, SC; I was raised in<br/>
Illinois, about 40 miles west of Chicago. Nice small town, cornfield in<br/>
the backyard, went to ps in a great school system (Geneva, IL). I did<br/>
not go to college, which has always been my regret. I was not a good<br/>
student. It wasn&#39;t until probably my early 30&#39;s that I really found an<br/>
interest in certain things and most of what I have learned (and I&#39;m<br/>
still learning and loving it) has been since then. For the past seven<br/>
years, I&#39;ve worked at my church, first as bookkeeper and then as<br/>
Ministerial Assistant to the Pastor. I quit my job in January, but am<br/>
still the Women&#39;s Ministry Director.<br/>
<br/>
We have 3 children: <br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter is married and just bore our first grandchild in<br/>
February. She and her husband live here in our town, although I fully<br/>
expect them to move one of these days. She is 9 hours shy of receiving<br/>
her BS in Math from Winthrop University. Jennifer was a model student in<br/>
school ... always studied, loved learning and was &quot;teacher pleaser,&quot;<br/>
never got in trouble, took advance classes, and had a wonderful public<br/>
school experience. She always had a motivation to go to college, and it<br/>
happened. She is 22 yrs old now.<br/>
<br/>
Our middle child, a son, had a TERRIBLE high school experience. While we<br/>
always worked hard never to compare the two, he just wasn&#39;t turned on to<br/>
what they were teaching in school. He&#39;s a *very* social person, and<br/>
school was great FUN for him in that respect. However, early on, the<br/>
administration marked him because of some stupid (though not serious)<br/>
pranks JB was involved, and for five years (yes, 5) it was like a prison<br/>
for him. He was *always* either being suspended or receiving detention<br/>
for having his shirt untucked, being tardy, etc., etc. You know the<br/>
tune. His high school years were h*** for him and us, and it really took<br/>
a toll on our marriage as well. My husband was adament that he graduate<br/>
(he was a hs drop-out who earned a GED) and he was *constantly* on JB&#39;s<br/>
case about homework, etc. Looking back on it now, I realize what a waste<br/>
of energy that was. Finally, when JB had earned enough credits to<br/>
graduate, turned out he was failing one course (CP Chemistry) by TWO<br/>
POINTS. Failing the class would mean he&#39;d have to go to summer school<br/>
and graduate with a summer school ceremony ~ after FIVE YEARS in high<br/>
school. My husband and I met with the principal and the chemistry<br/>
teacher. We asked him to double-check his gradebook, which he did; still<br/>
two points shy of passing. We asked if JB could do some extra work to<br/>
make up the two points so he could &quot;walk&quot; with his class and get out of<br/>
there. The answer was no. No extra work, no giving him the two points.<br/>
That was it. THEN we find out, after asking the guidance counselor to do<br/>
a double-check on his credits, that he was actually only ONE HALF CREDIT<br/>
shy of the required 20 credits, but guess what? They still made him take<br/>
a summer course (correspondence, because he SWORE he&#39;d never set foot in<br/>
that school again) and he finally did graduate. He was 18 then; he&#39;s 20<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest daughter just finished her sophomore year. Meg has always<br/>
been a &quot;marginal&quot; student (their term) and showed no motivation or<br/>
interest in school at all. Very much like her brother, only not so much<br/>
into the &quot;social&quot; thing at school. She struggled with her studies and<br/>
could never focus or concentrate. She will be 17 yrs old this fall.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I&#39;ve always been a working mom. We always said I<br/>
&quot;had&quot; to work. But then late last year, some things in my life started<br/>
to change ~ me! I don&#39;t know if it was a mid-life crisis or what, but I<br/>
really started taking stock of my life and what time was left in my<br/>
life. My husband and I talked about it and I decided (with him in<br/>
agreement) that in my heart I really wanted to be home, and always had.<br/>
I love being home. I think maybe the experience with JB, and the things<br/>
we were going through with Meg in high school now, taught us something.<br/>
Anyway, I decided to quit my job and stay at home for a couple of<br/>
reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) To offer to babysit my new grandson during the day (my daughter and<br/>
sil both work full-time). I want to be present in this child&#39;s life<br/>
during the time that I can ... my kids unfortunately never had this in<br/>
their lives. <br/>
<br/>
2) To get to know Meg. At the time I quit, I had not even DREAMED of<br/>
homeschooling. I only knew that, being a &quot;low-maintenance&quot; child, she<br/>
had virtually raised herself, and that I needed to get to know her and<br/>
connect with her.<br/>
<br/>
3) I felt like my time working at the church was good, but I was really<br/>
spinning my wheels doing a little bit of a lot of things; I wanted to<br/>
concentrate on making a positive contribution to this world on a more<br/>
personal level. How, I don&#39;t know; am still on that journey.<br/>
<br/>
So, I prayed for God to show me just how I was to do this thing with<br/>
Meg. And that&#39;s where the homeschooling thing happened. I felt like God<br/>
told me to pull her out of ps and homeschool her. This was something I<br/>
NEVER would have imagined! I knew a little bit about it because some<br/>
families in our church homeschool their little ones (no teens), but my<br/>
interpretation of homeschooling was &quot;school in a box&quot; and I KNEW that<br/>
that would never work for my kids and I really had a kind of negative<br/>
view about homeschooling. Most people in my church use A Beka and I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t fathom setting Meg in front of a VCR all day with a workbook.<br/>
Er go, my negative opinion of homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I decided to go on the quest by myself. I started reading everything I<br/>
could about homeschooling; I did lots of internet research; joined some<br/>
homeschool email groups; networked with anyone I could find who was<br/>
homeschooling, asking questions, etc. And then, while flipping through<br/>
The Elijah Company catalog, I came upon the concept of unschooling.<br/>
Bingo. I knew that was the way to go, both for me and for Meg.<br/>
Unschooling is exactly what I think I&#39;ve been doing to myself all these<br/>
years, and knowing Meg the way I do, I believe it&#39;s right for her.<br/>
<br/>
She was very open to it ~ high school was becoming a burden for her. She<br/>
was getting terrible headaches; teachers would bring up her brother&#39;s<br/>
name and be sarcastic to her about him; and then it got to where she<br/>
wasn&#39;t wanting to go at all. <br/>
<br/>
When we finally made the decision to JUST DO IT, I must admit, it was<br/>
difficult. As someone said, unschooling isn&#39;t a method, it&#39;s a different<br/>
way of thinking and, I would say, of living, as well. And since NO ONE<br/>
around us unschools, it was pretty scary. But we knew she couldn&#39;t ride<br/>
it out until the end of the school year, so about a month ago we joined<br/>
a homeschool association (to make it legal) and I called them up and<br/>
told them she was never coming back.<br/>
<br/>
Resistance? Yes, some of her teachers have had very sarcastic things to<br/>
say to her; when she went back to the school one day to turn in a<br/>
textbook, the principal (a Ph.D.) ~ who knew why she had pulled out of<br/>
public school ~ smiled and said to her, &quot;So, you quitting school?&quot;<br/>
THings like that REALLY REALLY REALLY make me mad, but after all the<br/>
reading I&#39;ve done, I understand their FEAR.<br/>
<br/>
So.....we begin. The timing is good for deschooling since it&#39;s summer.<br/>
It&#39;s been amazing to see the change in Meg, and so quickly. She&#39;s become<br/>
fascinated with the baby and I think is learning so much just by being<br/>
around him here every day; the other night she went to the store for me<br/>
to pick up some things and she came back with a cage and a NEWT! She<br/>
said, &quot;Mom... it&#39;s educational!&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;Go for it!&quot; (BTW,<br/>
his name is Duke.) And for the past few days,I&#39;ve &quot;caught&quot; her playing<br/>
the &quot;Where in the US is Carmen San Diego&quot; on the computer ...<br/>
(geography), on her own. It&#39;s so cool. We&#39;re very excited as we look<br/>
forward to the fall and the things we want to do ... museums, concerts,<br/>
reading, etc. She still has a long way to go, don&#39;t get me wrong. She<br/>
misses her friends a lot, and the &quot;unstructure&quot; is something so new to<br/>
her, after being herded from stall to stall all day long in school. But<br/>
I really believe this is the right thing to do, and something that<br/>
honors God and my family, as well as my heart.<br/>
<br/>
Let me say this about our son, too. He&#39;s been out of school for a couple<br/>
of years now. He just finished taking 3 classes at a tech college, which<br/>
he failed. He started out going to class, but then quit. He&#39;s just not<br/>
interested. But now, that&#39;s okay with me and with his Dad. (Well, with<br/>
me anyway; his Dad is trying to understand.) We&#39;ve come to terms with<br/>
the fact that JB will find his niche when it&#39;s his time. Right now, he&#39;s<br/>
working as a waiter and LOVES it because he&#39;s such a people-person. I<br/>
doubt he&#39;ll want to be a waiter for the rest of his life, but he&#39;s still<br/>
on the road to self-discovery, and it&#39;s neat to sit back and watch. He&#39;s<br/>
turned in to a very &quot;responsible, productive citizen.&quot; And that happened<br/>
AFTER he was out of school.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had homeschooled JB when he as in high school, but for whatever<br/>
reason, I wasn&#39;t led to do it at that time. <br/>
<br/>
Two more comments, and then I&#39;ll close:<br/>
<br/>
1) I want to say that the book that gave me the confidence to make my<br/>
unschooling decision was Grace Llewellyn&#39;s &quot;The Teenage Liberation<br/>
Handbook ~ How To Quit School And Get A Real Life and Education.&quot; It is<br/>
fabulous! I think everyone who is homeschooling or thinking of<br/>
homeschooling a teenager should read it. Also, John Gatto&#39;s, &quot;Dumbing Us<br/>
Down,&quot; helped me get a grip on, as he puts it, &quot;the hidden curriculum of<br/>
compulsory schooling.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
2) Regarding &quot;are our kids learning?&quot; I think the biggest weapon Satan<br/>
uses in this world, and especially in the church because I see it<br/>
everyday, is comparison. So many moms and dads are so obsessed with<br/>
comparing their children to another&#39;s children. It&#39;s destructive. My<br/>
kids are my kids and designed uniquely from any others. Just let your<br/>
kids be who they are and let them develop at their own pace. Comparison<br/>
breeds dissatisfaction and jealousy and envy. Not good things. Our kids<br/>
will learn when they are ready. I know I did.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so long, but I am just so excited about unschooling and<br/>
about finally &quot;taking charge&quot; of my life, it&#39;s exhilerating! <br/>
<br/>
As for comments people make to me about unschooling, I just ignore them.<br/>
I think that the women who say negative things to me about my decision<br/>
are secretly feeling that they wish they had the courage to do what I<br/>
did for the sake of my daughter. (Most women stay at home when the kids<br/>
are little, not when they are teens.) When I challenge them to do the<br/>
same, they say, &quot;Well, we can&#39;t financially...&quot; blah blah blah I used to<br/>
say that, too. But it&#39;s working out so far. Where there&#39;s a will,<br/>
there&#39;s a way, for sure!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to learning even more...<br/>

Your so close to us!!<br/>
We love Saluda, and were just there yesterday playing with our very best and<br/>
favorite friends.<br/>
You should come visit us some time.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;  I know live about 4 hours from you, near Tryon, NC&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t been able to catch up entirely on all the digests of the last day,<br/>
&gt; but I wanted to do a quick intro and tell Ann in NC that I&#39;m near Greenville,<br/>
&gt; SC, not far away. Also we&#39;re looking hard and heavy into moving up your way.<br/>
&gt; We want to move to Saluda which is right down the road from you. We have real<br/>
&gt; estate guides from up there coming out of our ears right now! It&#39;s probably a<br/>
&gt; pipe dream until our 18 year old gets out of college though :( Maybe we can<br/>
&gt; meet sometime?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been homeschooling my 8 year old son for a year now. I&#39;m didn&#39;t unschool<br/>
&gt; this year but I&#39;m so intrigued by it. My husband is supportive of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling but not of unschooling. He is an engineer so he insists that we<br/>
&gt; cover math every day. I love math myself and want my son to enjoy it so I<br/>
&gt; like working with him on it. Other than that we were pretty loose, but I<br/>
&gt; cannot claim the unschooling tag. We are taking a little summer break from<br/>
&gt; even the math right now and my son has delighted us by immediately wanting to<br/>
&gt; learn about Native Americans and ancient Egypt. If the summer continues like<br/>
&gt; this, perhaps my husband will look more favorably upon unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have two older children, daughters 18 and nearly 22. They weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; homeschooled but now that they see how much fun their brother has, they wish<br/>
&gt; they had been. I never considered it when they were young since I thought<br/>
&gt; homeschooling could only be very structured and very religious, neither of<br/>
&gt; which we were. There are many many homeschoolers in Greenville but they are<br/>
&gt; nearly all fit that profile. (Greenville is the home of Bob Jones University,<br/>
&gt; known for very structured homeschooling materials) Since we don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; join a statement of faith homeschool group, we don&#39;t have too many homeschool<br/>
&gt; families to hang out with. I have met a few though and I&#39;d love to meet more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s about it for us. I&#39;m enjoying this list but I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; ever catch up with all the mail!!<br/>

     Your letter was Awesome!  Don&#39;t apologize for it being long, I loved it. <br/>
 It brings up alot of my own public school memories (I got good grades, but <br/>
school was hell for me) as well as my own childrens.  I think that alot of <br/>
people (especially me) need to be reminded about how bad the public school <br/>
system is and how it is failing our children.  That itself will help give up <br/>
the courage to go on with what we are doing, and the encouragement to know <br/>
that it is the right thing to do.  Thank you!<br/>
