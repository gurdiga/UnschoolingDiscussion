<div id="ygrps-yiv-178602609">Hello!  I noticed a few families are from Mass.  I have yet to meet any<br/>
unschoolers close to us and was wondering if anyone knows of groups in<br/>
central or western Mass.  We live in south central Mass.  but I have<br/>
only found one group and they are located closer to Boston.  Thanks<br/>
again for your help and encouraging emails!  Sharon</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-356554413">Hi Sharon - Have you joined ma home learning association or ma homeschoolers<br/>
on yahoogroups?  I know of a few homeschooling groups, but I haven&#39;t met any<br/>
other unschoolers yet.  The groups I know of are:  LEAF Network (covers<br/>
Blackstone Valley area), South Shore Home Schoolers (Bridgewater/Halifax<br/>
area),  PALS (in Plymouth), and one on the Cape that I can&#39;t think of the<br/>
name of, but can find if you want it.  You could check out the MHLA website<br/>
for a group near you.<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking we should put together a MA unschooling dotcom picnic.<br/>
We&#39;d love to finally meet another unschooling family.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222209588">Hi Rue!  We would love to meet others, too!  A picnic is a great idea.<br/>
Do you live out towards Boston?  Thanks for all of the info.  I have<br/>
looked online and that&#39;s where I found the unschooling group in<br/>
Arlington/Belmont area which is about an hour from us.  The local<br/>
homeschool group is just that - a HOME SCHOOL group so it would be nice<br/>
to meet other unschoolers IRL.  Thanks again Rue!  Sharon<br/>
