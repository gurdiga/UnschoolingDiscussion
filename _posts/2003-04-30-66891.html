<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wonder if any families have ever ACTUALLY made their kids consume their<br/>

<br/>
On a vaguely related side-note, I got in trouble constantly as a kid in<br/>
school for eating paper. I never knew why I did it, but I couldn&#39;t stop<br/>
myself. Years later I discovered that I had always been horribly anemic and<br/>
had a condition called &quot;pica&quot; in which people eat stuff like clay, dirt,<br/>
chalk, paper, ice, etc. Typical, the teachers punished me for an illness<br/>
that was curable by an iron tablet a day. But I&#39;ll throw this out in case<br/>
anyone ever has a kid who does this (especially excessive ice chewing can be<br/>
indicative) so you&#39;ll know what&#39;s going on. Oh yeah, I also got in trouble<br/>
at home for chewing too much ice. My mom had my dad take the ice maker in<br/>
our freezer apart.. I wish someone had just *told* me and helped me fix it!<br/>

wow I didn&#39;t know it was a condition...As a child I ate bits of paper off and on (among a couple other things) and an strong desire to chew coal.  I still occasionally like the smell of gasoline at the station, but not near as much as when I was growing up.<br/>
