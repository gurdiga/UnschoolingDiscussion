<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494055974">Hi,<br/>
My first question has to do with food.  I have an 8 (almost 9yo) <br/>
daughter who is not able to tell when she is full.  She ends up eating <br/>
beyond a point of fullness and gets stomach aches and sometimes sick.  <br/>
I don&#39;t allow her freedom of eating because of this (she has had <br/>
freedom in the past and she eats till she is sick and she is also <br/>
overweight because her metabolism is very slow).  If I am trying to <br/>
move towards a RU lifestyle, what would you suggest I do with this <br/>
situation?  Right now she can eat when she is hungry, but I control the <br/>
portion size so she doesn&#39;t over eat and get sick.  If she still feels <br/>
hungry after what I give her, I ask her to have a glass of water and <br/>
wait 15 minutes, if she still feels hungry, she can have more.  Yes, <br/>
this probably is controlling, but I don&#39;t want her getting stomach <br/>
aches/sick all the time.  She just does not recognize when she is full, <br/>
so I am trying to help her focus on her body and what it is saying to <br/>
her.  Any thoughts?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Deece</div>

<br/>
There is an actual medical condition that manifests itself as an inability<br/>
to sense fullness. I&#39;m sure that someone will be able to supply the name and<br/>
more info on it. I seem to recall that it is futile to hope that time and<br/>
experience would bring about a change in the physical sensations *if* your<br/>
dd is suffering from it.<br/>
<br/>
However it is still possible for *both* of you to become informed, seek a<br/>
diagnosis, gain understanding, and to discuss and agree together to<br/>
strategies to manage the condition, so that they are mutual - a partnership<br/>
rather than &quot;top down&quot;. Your dd may have ideas that are even better than<br/>
yours for how to achieve a healthy eating process while still preserving her<br/>
sense of self determination.<br/>
<br/>
Unusual medical conditions and extreme situations tend to be held up as<br/>
exceptions to living the Principles of Freedom and Autonomy. They don&#39;t have<br/>
to be exceptions even if the children&#39;s situations are exceptional.<br/>

================<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m sure that&#39;s so, but it&#39;s worth considering that if there are stresses  in <br/>
her life and eating just FEELS good, the stress should be looked at.   And I <br/>
think any doctor would ask all those kinds of questions too, about safety  and <br/>
calm surroundings and other forms of comfort and positive regard from others  <br/>
around her.<br/>
 <br/>
And those who have dealt with controls and then taking them away, or SAYING  <br/>
they&#39;re gone but just moving them to an unspoken level have probably all seen  <br/>
kids who gorge and binge and obsess, knowing the controls will return.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s worth looking at those factors and not assuming first that it&#39;s a  <br/>
biochemical glitch.<br/>
 <br/>
Lots of parents claim children &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t tell&quot; when maybe the  <br/>
kids just haven&#39;t had a chance to really experiment with feeling it themselves <br/>
 without a running commentary or judgment from those around them.  &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
enough.&quot;  How many MILLIONS of times have parents said &quot;That&#39;s enough&quot; to a  <br/>
child as though they, the parents, can tell what&#39;s &quot;enough&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s enough crying.<br/>
That&#39;s enough TV.<br/>
That&#39;s enough playing.<br/>
That&#39;s enough question-asking.<br/>
That&#39;s enough food.<br/>
That&#39;s enough laughing.<br/>
That&#39;s enough singing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595241235">The medical condition is called Prader-Willie Syndrome where the <br/>
switch to say &#39;I&#39;m full&#39; never clicks. You might also consider <br/>
having her thyroid function checked - underactive thyroid can slow <br/>
metabolism and lead to all sorts of other things (tiredness, <br/>
depression, when she gets older, reproductive issues, etc). It is <br/>
easily corrected with medication in most cases.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s old enough to gather info with you, including what constitutes <br/>
a &quot;portion&quot; of meat or a &quot;portion&quot; of veggies or whatever. Many <br/>
nutrition books use common objects as reference - for instance, <br/>
a &quot;serving&quot; of meat is the size of a deck of cards. That way there&#39;s <br/>
not a lot of tedious weighing and measuring, just a rough <br/>
eyeballing - maybe keep a deck of cards handy at first even.<br/>
<br/>
But, my first step would be a thorough physical (including a blood <br/>
test and all - blood test is the only way to confirm thyroid <br/>
function as far as I know. That would help include or exclude <br/>
physiological issues little PWS. If there is something that needs <br/>
addressing, address it *together*. <br/>
<br/>
If there isn&#39;t anything physiological, then look to what else is <br/>
happening - for instance, I read when I eat breakfast - it slows <br/>
down my eating so I can register when I&#39;m done (it takes something <br/>
like 20 minutes to register &quot;Full&quot; so if you eat rapidly, you can <br/>
easily overeat) - at dinner, I have DH and DS to talk to but they&#39;re <br/>
still asleep when I eat breakfast. On the other hand, focusing on <br/>
other things aside from what you are eating can also lead to &quot;robot&quot; <br/>
eating where you keep going and going without noticing that it&#39;s <br/>
your sixth cookie because you were wrapped up in a show about <br/>
mummies. What works for each person will vary. Sometimes including a <br/>
beverage with the meal helps. Sometimes it creates a full feeling <br/>
too quickly and precludes getting all the nutrients necessary from <br/>
the food. Does she eat out of boredom? stress? control needs? is it <br/>
always or at specific times of day? specific types of food? in <br/>
particular situations (like is it more likely if you&#39;ve been running <br/>
errands all morning)? Is she &#39;allowed&#39; regular high fiber and <br/>
protein snacks (whole grain crackers and cheese for instance)? Is <br/>
she eating mostly high-glycemic foods? They cause spikes and drops <br/>
in blood sugar which can cause a feeling of &quot;hunger&quot;. Look into <br/>
providing mostly low glycemic foods (oatmeal for instance instead of <br/>
white toast, bagels, cereal).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-605222782">Thank you all for the ideas and suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I talked with dh and we decided to start with a physical (thanks for <br/>
the suggestion of seeing a nutrionist, I will look into that, also) and <br/>
see if anything comes of that.<br/>
<br/>
If that is fine, we will work with dd to come up with ways to honor <br/>
her, yet keep her healthy.  <br/>
<br/>
We are in the process of changing our eating habits as a family (though <br/>
dh is having a rough time, he&#39;s a meat and potato kind of guy) to more <br/>
whole foods.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, again.<br/>

<br/>
A year ago I strove to change my own eating habits, and my husband joined me <br/>
because he wanted to lose a few pounds and mostly because he always supports <br/>
me by being my partner for hard stuff. <br/>
<br/>
He was always a meat and potatoes kind of guy. Ate vegetables because he knew <br/>
he was supposed to but didn&#39;t really like any except beets. He ate a lot of <br/>
crackers and chips rather automatically while watching tv.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a year later, he packs salads for his workday lunches instead of <br/>
sandwiches and chips, by choice. For the first time in his life he&#39;s eating several <br/>
servings of fruits and vegetables every day.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I&#39;m still working on changing my habits. Life&#39;s funny that way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
