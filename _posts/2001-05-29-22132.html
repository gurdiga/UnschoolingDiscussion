<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025547701">I just wanted to correct my earlier typos!<br/>
<br/>
  I am not a QUILTER, but I am enjoying the posts, I find it inspiring to<br/>
hear how others are inspired. It only seems natural that an endless amount<br/>
of interests show up on this site. If you quilting enthusiasts would not<br/>
have shared,  I would not have thought about quilting; the beauty, the art,<br/>
the comfort, the people that I have known who are or were QUILTERS.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149541328">The short version of my situation is that my dd&#39;s, 6th<br/>
and 8th grade, are attending public school due to the<br/>
custody agreement I have with my ex-husband. Dh and I<br/>
have chosen to homeschool/unschool our 9yo and 16mo<br/>
ds&#39;s. That choice lets you know my basic philosophy on<br/>
education. My dilemma is this: dd Ryan, 6th grade, is<br/>
an exceptionally bright person and very social. This<br/>
means she is not &quot;performing&quot; well in school. I just<br/>
got a phone call from one of her teachers(very nice<br/>
lady, by the way) letting me know that she only has a<br/>
29% in civics and a 41% in writers workshop because<br/>
she hasn&#39;t been turning in her assignments. This is<br/>
the norm for Ryan, she loses things or forgets to turn<br/>
them in, or doesn&#39;t feel like doing them. The funny<br/>
thing is these are two of her favorite classes.<br/>
Anyway, I guess my question is how do I help Ryan<br/>
&quot;succeed&quot; in public school when I don&#39;t agree with the<br/>
system, and homschooling is not an option? I should<br/>
also mention that as far as public schools go, this is<br/>
the best our district has to offer, and I know her<br/>
teachers quite well. Any help would be much<br/>
appreciated, thanks!:-)<br/>

relationships are much more important to her than<br/>
tasks. She has lots of friends and enjoys the classes<br/>
but could care less about paperwork, except writing<br/>
assignments when they turn her on.<br/>

it shouldn&#39;t take much effort to not mention her<br/>
grades to him:-) Thanks for the feed back:-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836065569">I am curious (as a divorced mother married to a divorced father whose kids<br/>
are undergoing great educational change as of late) - does it LITERALLY say<br/>
in your custody agreement that the children have to go to a PUBLIC SCHOOL?<br/>
what if you wanted a private school - is that out? What if you found a<br/>
charter homeschool (still considered a public school)?<br/>
<br/>
That said - I totally agree with what someone else said about deciding what<br/>
her priorities are. Maybe you can talk to her about her future. What are her<br/>
goals? How does she need to live now to meet her future goals? Do her goals<br/>
include college? If so, what type? Community? University? Ivy League? I know<br/>
a lot of adults who really regret &quot;slacking off&quot; in highschool because it<br/>
made attending their first choice college impossible. Teens can&#39;t usually<br/>
plan for their futures this far in advanced to make the connection that<br/>
slacking off in highschool means missing out on the college experience of<br/>
your choice. Or at least not until it&#39;s too late. Maybe she has NO desire to<br/>
go to college at all. In which case, who CARES what her report card says.<br/>
The ONLY point of those report cards is to assess where a person is at so<br/>
they can get into college. Or graduate.<br/>
<br/>
Another option - how old is she? Can she take her GED and get out early?<br/>
This is something I (a straight-A student) wanted more than anything. I<br/>
HATED school, it was holding me back from life! In my area only criminals<br/>
and pregnant girls took the GED so I chickened out but I *did* graduate a<br/>
semester early (in Jan instead of June) and got so much slack for that but<br/>
have never regretted it. It did not hinder me getting into college. It freed<br/>
me to learn what *I* wanted sooner rather then later.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if she likes the social aspect then she might not willingly take<br/>
(and pass) the GED or care to graduate early (and miss out on prom and other<br/>
senior &quot;rites&quot; - something I REALLY did not regret).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122587">I know this may sound kind of dumb, but why does she need to &quot;succeed&quot; in public school? Is<br/>
she supposed to get A&#39;s? Does she need to please her Dad? What does &quot;succeed&quot; mean here?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this sounds blunt but I&#39;m trying to think how I would be if for some reason my son<br/>
was forced to go to ps. I think ( and, of course, I could be completely wrong!), that I<br/>
would still try to help my son figure out what he wants to do with it, what his goals are,<br/>
what he wants to get out of it, how he can cope with ps and still do/be what he wants, etc.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s not possible...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Another option is just to get out early. In my Junior year, I worked <br/>
out an agreement with the University of Oregon to admit me without my <br/>
high school diploma OR a GED. I took the SAT tests a year early, and <br/>
on the strength of my SAT scores I got in. With the help of a good <br/>
guidance counselor in my high school, I arranged with my high school <br/>
to get high school credits for my college classes and so I graduated <br/>
high school after my first year of college, going through graduation <br/>
with my regular class. I still remember the discussion I had with my <br/>
high school principle when the counselor and I presented my plan to <br/>
him. He was very concerned about me missing out on &quot;your senior year, <br/>
the best year of your life&quot;. Bwahahahahahahaha<br/>
Interestingly enough, I just found some really bad poetry I wrote <br/>
during that last semester of public school, including the following <br/>
(pithy, but poignant) segment: <br/>
<br/>
See the happy teens<br/>
going to their school<br/>
see them go to classes that<br/>
turn them into mindless fools<br/>
see them, aren&#39;t the happy<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t want to die<br/>
maybe they can tell you<br/>
why the suicide rate&#39;s so high<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the principle only knew! I was sooooo happy to escape. I guess an <br/>
unschooler was born... I found out later that the only reason he <br/>
wanted me to stay is that I was supposed to be a National Merit <br/>
Scholar, but I wouldn&#39;t qualify if I didn&#39;t stay in *his* school. I <br/>
was going to make his statistics look worse, so he didn&#39;t want me to <br/>
go. Bleh.<br/>
<br/>
On another track, my DH was basically failing school and also hated <br/>
it. He left about the same time I did, but &quot;dropped out&quot;. Then <br/>
someone convinced him to go through a local community college and he <br/>
took classes there and then got his GED. That&#39;s another route to <br/>
take. He enjoyed classes 100% more when he got to choose them.<br/>
<br/>
Just some options...<br/>

.......there may be a clue in that statement. It may<br/>
not actually be a school issue at all.<br/>
OR it could even be hormones kicking in......?  Is it<br/>
vacation time where you are? Some progress in<br/>
communication might be achievable now.  Is there an<br/>
&quot;alternative&quot; school in your area or Grassroots type<br/>
Free Schools?  Maybe an &quot;umbrella&quot; school would meet<br/>
the custody agreement?  Perhaps Ryan has some ideas of<br/>
her own that could help. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981281658">Did you know you can be officially enrolled in a private school and <br/>
still homeschool?  For instance - my dd is enrolled, officially, in a <br/>
private distance learning school called Laurel Springs. We&#39;re in NC <br/>
and Laurel is in CA. They supply the materials and a teacher (more of <br/>
a helper who suggests and keeps the records) but we still can veto <br/>
curriculum we don&#39;t like and do all the &#39;teaching&#39; at home. I think <br/>
this is what&#39;s called being under an &#39;umbrella school&#39;.  There are <br/>
many of these schools with options of being totally online or not.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t that fulfill the custody requirement yet still be able to <br/>
have the kids at home?  Just thought that this could be <br/>
your &#39;loophole&#39; around that agreement problem.<br/>

flexible and will suit the curriculum to the child&#39;s learning style. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-664961795">In what way do you find Laurel Springs more flexible?  We use Clonlara.<br/>
They basically just handle the school system for us and leave us alone.  We<br/>
are not required to use a curriculum.  If there is someone even more hands<br/>
off (although I&#39;m not sure how that would be possible) I&#39;d be interested in<br/>
knowing more about them.  Thanks ~Rue<br/>

<br/>
Right. Clonlara School is one of many.  Laurel Springs is more<br/>
flexible and will suit the curriculum to the child&#39;s learning style.<br/>
Other schools include Oak Meadow, Trent and Abbington Hill - just to<br/>
name a few.  Go to a search engine and plug in &#39;distance learning<br/>
schools&#39; and you&#39;ll get a bunch of websites to explore.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360652769">Sorry...I realized when I was finished I had more to ay than I <br/>
thought................When I took the GED test in 1988 , I was 17..not <br/>
pregnant(..yet) and definitely not a criminal..just wanted to see if I was <br/>
ready to go to College because I hated everything about high school. I <br/>
received a state diploma after passing and it has never hindered any future <br/>
employment or education because here in Maryland they issue you a high school <br/>
diploma when you pass the test.<br/>
Both of my parents received their GED / diploma in Michigan and I don&#39;t think <br/>
it was the same there (but this was also in the 60&#39;s). But the piece of paper <br/>
meant nothing to them and neither had kept it. My father is a warehouse <br/>
worker but my mother got a good government job and makes an insanely high <br/>
salary with her GED. My original plan after having my children was that they <br/>
receive diplomas from their school ( as in ..not take the easy way out..the <br/>
test) and go on to college if they chose. After going out in the world and <br/>
meeting so many people with varied degrees of education, I saw little <br/>
difference between the &quot;formally - schooled &quot; and &quot;self-taught&quot;. I want my <br/>
children to be happy and feel successful no matter what they do and from my <br/>
experience neither a diploma or degree actually ensures that.<br/>

MAYBE if she&#39;s good an adult orchestra would let her sit in for rehearsals, <br/>

Is there a community orchestra anywhere nearby?  I<br/>
played with the Ocala Symphony (Florida) when I was<br/>
11.  It was a wonderful experience.  The older, more<br/>
experienced musicians just seemed to carry me along!<br/>
It didn&#39;t require an audition that I remember. And<br/>
nobody took time to rempremand me for anything (like<br/>
in a school situation).  And what applause does for<br/>
the ego! Even 11 year old who was all teeth, elbows,<br/>
knees, and feet.<br/>

redundant and post anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a community orchestra there?  I played with<br/>
the Ocala Symphony (Florida) when I was 11.  What a<br/>
wonderful experience it was.  The older, more<br/>
experienced musicians just seemed to carry me along!<br/>
There was no audition that I recall (this was 40 years<br/>
ago) and no one bothered to reprimand me for anything<br/>
(as would occur in a school situation).  And what<br/>
applause does for the ego, even an eleven year old<br/>
that is all teeth, elbows, knees, and feet! I was the<br/>
only youngster.  It didn&#39;t seem to bother anyone,<br/>
though, except my mother, who drove me to rehersals.<br/>
She had other things she wanted to do.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
