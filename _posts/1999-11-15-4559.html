<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944388797">I finally got in touch with the lady last night! <br/>
This is a black Shetland colt. It is 6 months old. The person selling has a <br/>
large horse farm for carriages, and is depleting part of her business. Today, <br/>
we shall go and see what she has to offer. There are 15 horses for sale, from <br/>
the colt to older full size horses. I know that I would have to have the <br/>
children break the colt and that with it only growing to 4 ft, chances are <br/>
the children will have a horse, not me. It is my dream to have horses, <br/>
though. Regardless of papers, breed, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for answering. I was close to tears when dh gave the &quot;ok&quot; and <br/>
handed me the telephone! Now to find a place for it to go. I think that the <br/>
city would go nuts over a horse (they hated the chickens)...<br/>

       I think that I will move closer to the gym, that way between sets,<br/>
       I can run home and eat something sweet to keep up my energy! s.<br/>
