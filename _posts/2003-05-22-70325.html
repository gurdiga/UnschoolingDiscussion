<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646103635">As far as other unschooling books:<br/>
<br/>
**I just thought of another one that really grabbed me when I read it about 7 years ago.  It&#39;s called Real Lives- eleven teenagers who don&#39;t go to school by Grace Llewellyn.  I read it when my daughter was 3 and was just amazed at all the possibilities for older kids.**<br/>
<br/>
Yes!   I just remembered the same thing with Teenage Liberation Handbook.   Although my kids are only 10, 8 and 6,  I read Teenage Liberation Handbook a couple of years ago.   It had so many ideas that would helpful for anyone who is unschooling.    It helped me in deschooling my thinking.<br/>
<br/>
It also really gave me alot of information on how to answer questions from others who don&#39;t get how unschooling can move right into adult life.<br/>
<br/>
I learned alot from that book.  More than I even realized.<br/>
