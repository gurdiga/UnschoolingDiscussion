<div id="ygrps-yiv-315728848">Okay, Deb.  You&#39;ve inspired me to share our day yesterday.  :)<br/>
<br/>
We awoke to the sound of rainfall outside.  A slow, steady, relaxing rain that makes you want to lounge in bed all day.  My daughter was snuggled up beside me and smiling sweetly from her dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Mady (6) somehow talked her brother Alex (9) into painting her toenails (because he does such a gooooood job) for her.  It was the cutest thing I had seen in a while........he was kneeling in the floor painting toes, while she sat in the chair looking like a pampered princess.  I did find out later that it was actually a business proposition that got Alex interested.  He was charging her 25 cents per toe/finger and he easily told me that she would be giving him $5 of her allowance on payday.  :)<br/>
<br/>
A while later, I found the kids sitting under the patio cover listening to the rain fall onto it.  I could see the excitement in their eyes as they asked me, &quot;Hey Mom, can we go play in the mud?&quot;   Now, I am sort of a perfectionist and I don&#39;t like things dirty.  I usually don&#39;t intentionally let them get covered head to toe in mud, but I decided it is surely to be a learning experience, right?  (we&#39;ve been completely unschooling for 4-5 months now and I am still doing my best to deschool myself!)  Needless to say, they had a blast.  After the gigantic mud pie construction, they discovered how fun it was to rub the mud all over each other which of course, had to be removed by spraying each other with the water hose.     After their subsequent showers, wrapped in their fuzziest robes, they had steaming hot chocolate for afternoon snack.  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t long before something else fun was started.  Alex got his Hot Wheels out and they had crash up derby in the kitchen floor.   They used all the blocks, Legos, and Lincoln Logs to build towers to crash into.  While Alex was building, Mady got tired of waiting and got out a math workbook and did a couple of pages.  She had to have me check for accuracy as soon as she was finished (which of course my baby did wonderfully!) and then hang it on the fridge for all to see.<br/>
<br/>
Then the fort building started.  I truly guess I have lost the battle for the living room.  We don&#39;t have a playroom so the kids have taken over my tastefully decorated living area.  They had forts built from one end of the room to the other.  Alex got out his video camera and started filming a sequel to &quot;War of Wars&quot; which he filmed last week for his Mimi.  For his birthday last year, she got him almost every GI Joe doll and accessory available.  She is in the Army Reserve and very military oriented.  He filmed his dolls (excuse me, It was requested I use the term, soldiers........) ahem, ....soldiers in the midst of a ferocious battle.  It was kinda Toy Storyish.  Anyway, they were now doing a sequel with Barbie and her friends with the Soldiers.  Barbie&#39;s house was eventually bombed (you could &#39;hear&#39; the fighter pilots coming) but everyone made it out okay.  Whew!<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful day for us all!  I even had time to do some reading myself.   We now have to plan Daddy&#39;s birthday party ....it&#39;s tonight....and people are coming over.......eeek!  I guess the forts will have to be put away for another rainy day.  <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271327879">Kimber,  don&#39;t tell that entrepreneurial son of yours people pay good<br/>
money to have mud smeared on them at expensive spa&#39;s!   LOL.  What a fun<br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>
Our neighbor doesn&#39;t let her kids play in the rain.  Dylan loves the<br/>
rain, in the summer when it&#39;s warm, and is always out in it.  She came<br/>
over a few weeks ago with her littlest boy and told me... came over TO<br/>
tell me, that HER kids don&#39;t play in the rain because they could get sick<br/>
and she didn&#39;t think it was fair that Dylan was out there, right across<br/>
the street, where her kids could see, playing in the rain.  I said, no<br/>
that&#39;s not fair that they can&#39;t play in the rain too, and I was amazed<br/>
about the illness because he&#39;s ten now and has never gotten sick from it.<br/>
 She looked at her little boy and said, sternly, &quot;GO HOME&quot;  and then told<br/>
me she didn&#39;t appreciate me saying stuff like that in front of her<br/>
kids...   She didn&#39;t seem to think it was a problem that she was in my<br/>
yard, in front of my kid telling me WE shouldn&#39;t be outside because HER<br/>
kids weren&#39;t allowed in the rain.... well, whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
Your mud story made me happy.  = )  You want to come and be my neighbor?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of when we first moved to Hawaii years ago. The two older<br/>
ones were about 5 and 3 and they decided to make one part of the backyard<br/>
into a mud garden. On one of their first days doing this they decided to<br/>
paint themselves from head to toe with the mud (2 very pale British kids --<br/>
completely naked). they were caked in bright red mud which we discovered an<br/>
hour or two later also left them stained bright red! They were kind of<br/>
muddy/streaky colored for about 3 days after that. After a few more weeks<br/>
they were so brown the future mud wars didn&#39;t show up as badly as at first,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24693577">LOL, My son (when younger) pulled off Barbies head and threw it because he<br/>
thought she was using Ken (which was his doll) Later that day we played<br/>
badmitton (sp) with her poor ole head. My oldest, who is a feminist says<br/>
Barbie is a tramp :)<br/>
<br/>
Had to share, even if it is an over-share :)<br/>

&#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that is<br/>
more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095595261">We had a great rain day a couple of weeks ago.  It was warm, so I <br/>
told the kids to go out in bathing suits(didn&#39;t want a bunch of wet <br/>
clothes to wash).  It was one of those really HARD down pours and <br/>
they stood on our front deck screaming with joy from the feeling.<br/>
It lightened up a bit and they took the umbrella from our deck table <br/>
and put it on the play set out back and made a fort.<br/>
They were out there for over an hour and my 5 yo came in with blue <br/>
lips(at which point I offered him a raincoat, but he opted for hot <br/>
chocolate instead).  Amazingly, noone got sick!?<br/>
Playing in the rain is a thrill no child should be denied.<br/>

A couple of weeks ago, we were to have our first meeting of a Nature <br/>
Club that I just organized.  I have just invited about 6-8 other <br/>
homeschooling families to go on nature walks with us once a month (I <br/>
go with my girls every week).  Anyway, on the first day, I woke up <br/>
and it was raining!  Of course, this being San Diego, it wasn&#39;t cold <br/>
or anything.  So I called everyone and told them that we were still <br/>
going, but I would leave it up to them to go or not.  Every single <br/>
person showed up!  Even people with babies and toddlers.  We went <br/>
for a creek walk, climbed rocks, splashed in the creek and got <br/>
rained on for three hours.  What a blast. I am so grateful to have a <br/>
nice group of unschoolers around.  <br/>

I&#39;d love to hear how you organized the nature walks, did you just call<br/>

How do you decide where to go and do all of you just get yourselves<br/>
there, or do you have a van or what?<br/>

Homeschoolers always cancel summer park days here when it rains!  What&#39;s<br/>
up with that?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Deb<br/>
Well, I have to admit, that even though I love all the homeschoolers <br/>
around, the crowding of this area is hard to take some days. Also, <br/>
it can be hard to find &quot;nature.&quot;  For our Nature Club we mostly will <br/>
go to state and county parks in the area. <br/>
<br/>
The way I got it going was this:  I have been toying with the idea <br/>
of starting some type of co-op activities that would be friendly for <br/>
bringing preschoolers and toddlers along, since most of my friends <br/>
have these! I thought of doing an art day, a games day, things liek <br/>
that.  I wanted it to be free and not require too much commitment <br/>
from people, since I always hate the feeling of waking up and <br/>
realizing I commited to some activity that doesn&#39;t sound good that <br/>
day!  I asked around and everyone I talked to said it sounded great, <br/>
so I armed myself with two books:  <br/>
Walking San Diego--it maps out easy to difficult walks all over the <br/>
county with info about native habitats, etc.<br/>
Sharing Nature with Children--an old book by Joseph Cornell that has <br/>
simple awareness and appreciation activities for kids.  I will pick <br/>
out one or two activities each time, but I just leave it open to the <br/>
mood whether we actually do them or not.<br/>
Then, each week, my girls and I go check out one or two of the <br/>
walks.  When we find one that will work for a group, we invite <br/>
everyone by e-mail. <br/>
Well, I was hoping to get two or three other families to share our <br/>
walks, but already I have eight, and more interested.  Yikes!  <br/>

I called some of the homeschoolers around here, not to many these days,<br/>
and no unschoolers, but none of them were interested.  I thought it would<br/>
be fun for the kids but the moms just aren&#39;t into hiking, etc. <br/>
There have been park days here but they only last an hour and my kid&#39;s<br/>
just getting warmed up by the time the other kids are being dragged home.<br/>

We go anyway, and we have fun.  = )<br/>
