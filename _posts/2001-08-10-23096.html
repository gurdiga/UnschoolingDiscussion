<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060163593">My boys aren&#39;t circumcised.  This next part might not make as much sense to <br/>
the Brits and Canadians:   I had Kirby in an HMO hospital and they asked once <br/>
about circumcision and I said no, the &quot;no&quot; counted.<br/>
<br/>
I had Marty two and a half years later in a county-funded, university-run <br/>
teaching hospital.  They asked me THREE TIMES, three different people, three <br/>
different shifts.  That, frankly, is dangerous in this country because LOTS <br/>
of boys are done without them asking the parents as it used to be so routine. <br/>
 I said either to write it big on a chart or get me a permanent marker so I <br/>

I was talking to my uncle who is 68 and was born at home.   He was asking <br/>
question about my dad, who would be 75 now but he&#39;s not living.  My uncle <br/>
wasn&#39;t circumcised.  My dad was circumcised when he was 8 because he got an <br/>
infection.  <br/>
<br/>
It became common when &quot;scientific&quot; hospital births became so common, in the <br/>
1950&#39;s, I guess.  The mom wasn&#39;t even awake from her full anesthesia before <br/>
the poor baby was cut.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of like an innoculation, one scientific (I use the word sarcastically) <br/>
justification given was that eastern European Jewish women never got cervical <br/>
cancer.  And their husbands were all circumcised.  Therefor we should <br/>
circumcise all American boys so their future wives would never get cervical <br/>
cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
Well, if their future wives were eastern European Jews, that would work out <br/>
great because I read later an &quot;ooops&quot; report which said it was genetic, that <br/>
they didn&#39;t get cancer, not caused by &quot;cleaner&quot; penises.  <br/>
<br/>
I can only think of it in short bursts because it&#39;s so sad, but I do press <br/>
information on pregnant friends and I press it hard because I can&#39;t bear the <br/>
thought of the sorrow of someone saying &quot;I didn&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;Why didn&#39;t you <br/>
tell me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Many nurses and doctors in New Mexico are against it and won&#39;t do it, advise <br/>
against it, and  won&#39;t participate in the procedure.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a website of a group called NoCirc but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s .com or <br/>
.net or what.  Don&#39;t go there if you&#39;re clinically depressed and you had your <br/>
boys circumcised.  Maybe just don&#39;t go there if you&#39;re clinically depressed <br/>
period.  Save it to ruin a brighter day.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t look, though, it will keep on happening.<br/>

Although I had my boys at home,  with the first one  I did pre register at a<br/>
hospital as a &quot;back-up&quot; in case of problems.<br/>
Right there on the preadmitting form (legal size page filled with small print<br/>
multiple paragraphs)  was a sentence authorizing circumcision if the child was<br/>
male.    Only because I am a compulsive reader as well as generally mistrustful<br/>
of signing long waiver/consent forms did I even see it.<br/>
I marked it out and wrote in a specific NON-consent for the procedure but I<br/>
imagine that many mothers never even realize they have given written consent for<br/>
a surgical procedure and no one will ask them even once after the son is born!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903626998">When my oldest son was about to be born his dad and I talked about <br/>
circumcision and I went along with the &quot;he should look like me <br/>
argument&quot;.  The day our son was born his dad got stuck in New York <br/>
and didn&#39;t make it back to Calif in time...long story.  Anyway, the <br/>
day after his birth the dr came to my hospital room (we had a C-<br/>
section)and asked if I still wanted a circumcision.  Our son was born <br/>
10 lbs 15 oz and was 22 1/2 inches long.  The dr explained that <br/>
because of his size he would have to take him into an operating room <br/>
and give him a general anesnetic to perform this operation.  I of <br/>
course said &quot;WHAT??&quot;  This seemed extreme even in my post operative, <br/>
confused mind.  I then followed with &quot;no way - no how&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
When I spoke with dad on the phone that day he went ballistic.  <br/>
(Being 3000 miles away and unable to get a flight back home was <br/>
causing him a lot of grief...Stress was sending him way over the top <br/>
that day.) I ended up hanging up on him (twice).  When he had calmed <br/>
down he called back again and listened when I told him what the dr <br/>
had actually said.  His response was &quot;Don&#39;t let that quack anywhere <br/>
near my son!&quot;  When we all got home safely we had a long talk (daddy <br/>
talked with two other doctors) and we decided circumcision was not <br/>
going to happen.  Since then (1985) he has read a lot about this <br/>
procedure and is thankful I made this decision. When our youngest son <br/>
was born the subject never even came up.  Uninformed decisions about <br/>
health care are made every day in stressful situations.  I wish I had <br/>
had some kind of a health care advocate with me that day who was not <br/>
connected with the dr or the hospital or the insurance company.<br/>

&gt; What they don&#39;t tell either is the number that are bungled!  Many boys have<br/>
&gt; to go in later and have the circumcision redone!<br/>
<br/>
Those might be the lucky ones.   In the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s  doing &quot;bloodless&quot;  laser<br/>
circumcisions became a fad.     Some medical schools ended up forbidding their<br/>
students and interns from doing the procedure after several unfortunate<br/>
incidents where it was suggested that the infant be raised as a girl  with<br/>
gender transforming surgery planned for the future.  (this was before the more<br/>
modern studies  suggesting that gender identification is determined by more than<br/>
physical anatomy).   That was also a period of infighting as to whether the<br/>
ob-gyn or pediatrician should do the surgery   (since ob-gyn is a &quot;surgical&quot;<br/>
specialty).   There were areas where boys foreskins were cut before leaving the<br/>
delivery room---sometimes even before the umbilical was cut.<br/>
<br/>
Vicki---who lived with an ob-gyn resident in the late 70&#39;s.<br/>

  I didn&#39;t realize until all this went on how little men know about <br/>
how this operation is done.  My ex (who falls apart at the mention of <br/>
blood) had no idea what the procedure was until he personally talked <br/>
with the dr.  Like I said, the second time around there was never any <br/>
discussion about circumcision.  Neither one of us were going to let <br/>
this happen to our sons.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Is this standard practise in county hospitals? Is there <br/>
any thing else I should watch out for when having  a <br/>
baby in an American hospital? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t finish making my whole point (Sorry)--which is that it&#39;s not only a <br/>
government funded hospital used to dealing with people who don&#39;t know or care <br/>
as much as lots of the people in this discussion, but it&#39;s a teaching <br/>
hospital so little groups of interns come through all the time and they are <br/>
often going by the favorite book of their teacher, and the residents are <br/>
nervous about who they have to answer to, and it&#39;s just not as <br/>
straightforward as business at a private or HMO hospital.    <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Birth plan&quot; is a buzz word you can use, though.  Write up what you want and <br/>
don&#39;t want, get them to fasten it in your folder, have copies for others when <br/>
you get there, and remind them it exists.   It might save you some time <br/>
trying to negotiate or defend your knowledge between contractions.<br/>
<br/>
Things have changed a lot in the past twenty years, gradually but steadily.  <br/>
There are still some backwards stubborn places that haven&#39;t thrown out the <br/>
old literature or policies.  I had to argue to keep Holly in the room with <br/>
me, even though she was my third.  That was less than ten years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
But on the better news front, a friend just had a three-month-premature baby <br/>
three days ago and they waited for her milk to come in before giving him <br/>
anything except IV fluids into his umbilical cord/stump/place/thing.  No <br/>
formula of any sort.  Cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223431694">When my first son was born we ended up with an unexpected C-Section <br/>
and Daddy in an airport 3,000 miles away.  My best friend is an RN.  <br/>
She went with me to the hospital.  I don&#39;t remember a lot about that <br/>
first delivery, but I do remember the look on my friend&#39;s face when a <br/>
snippy little nurse suggested I wasn&#39;t trying hard enough!!  My <br/>
friend was a charge nurse in another hospital.  She had the most <br/>
wicked smile on her face all the time she was chewing out that <br/>
nurse.  My doctor was at my bedside in less than five minutes and we <br/>
had a whole new set of nurses.  My friend was even allowed in the <br/>
operating room even though we had been told this wasn&#39;t going to be <br/>
possible since she was from another hospital.<br/>
<br/>
The second son was born with a scheduled C-section with Aunt Judi by <br/>
my side all the way through....Best advice...take your own bossy <br/>
nurse with you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809503044">We did not circ our sons (born in &#39;93 and &#39;00).<br/>
<br/>
I had never really given it much thought, but when I was pg with my first<br/>

doing it, even though my dh was circ&#39;d (he really didn&#39;t care if our sons<br/>

So, we didn&#39;t. We are unusual for our neck of the woods, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608690333">I didn&#39;t have any problems.  The doctor had a form stating how much a<br/>
circumcision would cost, and I had to sign it saying I understood.  And then<br/>
he had a form saying whether or not I wanted the baby circumcised if it was<br/>
a boy.  It was required, and I had to initial a bunch of places saying I<br/>
understood the procedure and the risks of it all, and then choose yes or no.<br/>
I chose no, but it would have been very difficult to be misunderstood with<br/>
what I had to go through.  There was even a booklet with diagrams and stuff<br/>
and I had to sign a thing saying I was given it.<br/>
<br/>
I guess they must have had some law suits around here or something for them<br/>
to be so thorough!  Both of my births (one in California at a regular<br/>
hospital, one in Oregon at a university hospital) had similar procedures as<br/>
far as making sure I signed a bunch of forms and got a bunch of information<br/>
about circumcision.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t have any problems with any of the other things...<br/>
Didn&#39;t have an episiotomy - said I didn&#39;t want one, doctors said fine, they<br/>
usually don&#39;t do them anyway.  My first doctor actually told me if I said I<br/>
don&#39;t want one, and they did one, it is considered battery and they&#39;d get<br/>
into a lot of trouble.  Just put everything in writing.  I would assume the<br/>
same would go for circumcision, if it is against your will, that would be<br/>
battery.<br/>
I just did up a birth plan, but it turned out I didn&#39;t need one.  My last<br/>
birth they even offered to dim lights, help me into various positions,<br/>
suggested rocking in a rocking chair, taking a shower, brought in soothing<br/>
CDs to play... they were great! Automatically put the baby immediately to my<br/>
breast before the cord was even cut.<br/>
So not all hospitals are nasty :)<br/>

Yes on colostrum, as much as she could pump out (not much) and they&#39;re giving <br/>
3ccs of milk at a time through a tiny feeding tube (through the mouth into <br/>

thought I was straange when I said no circ, no formula and I want my son<br/>
with me as much as possible. When my second was born and needed an oxygen<br/>
tent, I refused to leave his side and they threatened to medicate me. i<br/>
learned to fight for my rights and assert myself but when I had my third,<br/>
they formula fed, even though I gave instructions not to. He had a hard time<br/>
starting on the breast because of it. we persevered though.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t finish making my whole point (Sorry)--which is that it&#39;s not only<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; government funded hospital used to dealing with people who don&#39;t know or<br/>
care<br/>
&gt; as much as lots of the people in this discussion, but it&#39;s a teaching<br/>
&gt; hospital so little groups of interns come through all the time and they<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; often going by the favorite book of their teacher, and the residents are<br/>
&gt; nervous about who they have to answer to, and it&#39;s just not as<br/>
&gt; straightforward as business at a private or HMO hospital.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Birth plan&quot; is a buzz word you can use, though.  Write up what you want<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want, get them to fasten it in your folder, have copies for others<br/>
when<br/>
&gt; you get there, and remind them it exists.   It might save you some time<br/>
&gt; trying to negotiate or defend your knowledge between contractions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Things have changed a lot in the past twenty years, gradually but<br/>
steadily.<br/>
&gt; There are still some backwards stubborn places that haven&#39;t thrown out the<br/>
&gt; old literature or policies.  I had to argue to keep Holly in the room with<br/>
&gt; me, even though she was my third.  That was less than ten years ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But on the better news front, a friend just had a three-month-premature<br/>
baby<br/>
&gt; three days ago and they waited for her milk to come in before giving him<br/>
&gt; anything except IV fluids into his umbilical cord/stump/place/thing.  No<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-813620260">I&#39;m almost afraid to jump in. Sigh. This one causes so much pain. I grew up<br/>
Jewish, and had pre-Rabbinical training, and actually at one time headed a<br/>
Jewish religious school.  Of course that was almost 30 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Now I refuse to attend circumcisions.  Of course, people will do what they think<br/>
&quot;best&quot; for their child, or at least what their &quot;jealous God&quot; demands. From what<br/>
we think we know, the idea of circumcision came from the Egyptians, and the<br/>
attempt of the ancient Hebrews to look like them.  We know this because Moses<br/>
actually had to command the circumcision of Hebrews while they were in the<br/>
desert -- most were uncircumcised.  So we can say that if the Jews of this time<br/>
knew of the legacy of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc., etc., that legacy<br/>
definitely did NOT include circumcision.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the jealous God could have wanted a piece of an earlobe, or the left<br/>
little toe.  An interesting sign too -- most ancient tribes tatoo themselves or<br/>
self-mutilate in order that it be seen by others.  Ancient Hebrews did it only<br/>
to be seen in the bedroom.  Figure that one out.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, people have strange customs.  As long as it isn&#39;t done in hospitals with<br/>
money from my health insurance, or hospitals supported by federal or state<br/>
funds, I guess I&#39;ll have to live with it.  There are lots of other things (like<br/>
state-funded taverns, oops, I mean baseball parks) that I have to live with to<br/>
(even public schools!)<br/>

&gt; be the go-between to help mom get the birth she wants.  After the birth she<br/>
&gt; can also help with housdehold things, controlling the guests, making sure<br/>
&gt; mom gets her rest, etc.<br/>

<br/>
i had a doula and a midwife at my birth. my doula travelled with this midwife <br/>
but she also assisted in many hospital births. she made me food and drinks <br/>
while i labored, she did some housework, she took over to help me when my <br/>
s.o. needed to sleep. i think of a doula as an all around personal nurse for <br/>
labor.<br/>
i don&#39;t know if this is common with all doulas, but she was also studying to <br/>
be a midwife, was a reflexologist, and had extensive knowledge about herbs.<br/>
<br/>
some hospitals now are employing doulas. this may be a pro con situation <br/>
worth looking into. while they may be easily accessible it&#39;s important that <br/>
you&#39;re sure she&#39;s on your side should a conflict with the hospital come up.<br/>

Subject:        	[Unschooling-dotcom] Circumcision<br/>
<br/>
My boys aren&#39;t circumcised. This next part might not <br/>
make as much sense to <br/>
the Brits and Canadians: I had Kirby in an HMO <br/>
hospital and they asked once <br/>
about circumcision and I said no, the &quot;no&quot; counted.<br/>
<br/>
I had Marty two and a half years later in a county-<br/>
funded, university-run <br/>
teaching hospital. They asked me THREE TIMES, three <br/>
different people, three <br/>
different shifts. That, frankly, is dangerous in this <br/>
country because LOTS <br/>
of boys are done without them asking the parents as it <br/>
used to be so routine. <br/>
I said either to write it big on a chart or get me a <br/>
permanent marker so I <br/>
could write it on his belly, because the answer was no.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having moved here from England a few months ago I&#39;d <br/>
never heard that circumcision is routine in America. <br/>
I&#39;ve batteld with the INS to let us in vaccinated, I <br/>
home-educate following an autonomous approach and am <br/>
ready to do battle with the state when they find out. <br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m ready to take on hospitals too, straight <br/>
after a caesareansection I&#39;m not usually at my best.<br/>
<br/>
Is this standard practise in county hospitals? Is there <br/>
any thing else I should watch out for when having  a <br/>
baby in an American hospital?<br/>
Sigh.<br/>

i just can&#39;t resist here.....there&#39;s no chance of an <br/>
unwanted circumcision at <br/>
a home birth! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wish I could, but after three C-Sections....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i have heard stories of families heavily persuaded into <br/>
choosing to <br/>
circumcise-not really knowing their options, but none <br/>
in the last few years <br/>
that just plain weren&#39;t asked.<br/>
<br/>
I repeat the suggestion of the &#39;birth plan&#39;, but also <br/>
making sure that <br/>
someone else is able to back it up if you may have some <br/>
weak times. ha ha.<br/>
<br/>
another option is a doula. they serve many purposes, <br/>
one of which can be to <br/>
run interference between a birthing mother and hospital <br/>
&#39;authority&#39;.<br/>
