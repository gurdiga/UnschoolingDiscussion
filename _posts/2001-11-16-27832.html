<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613583023">I worked at the polls on election day in a nearby public elementary <br/>
school.  Posted in the teacher&#39;s lounge was this sign:<br/>
<br/>
IF IT&#39;S ANYTHING LESS THAN IMMEDIATE OBEDIENCE, IT&#39;S DISOBEDIENCE<br/>
<br/>
Goddess forbid the kids taking a moment to ponder, or question...but, <br/>
of course, I guess in this particular elementary school, to question <br/>
was, well, out of the question.  Grateful we&#39;re here, grateful I <br/>
followed my gut to unschooling...<br/>
