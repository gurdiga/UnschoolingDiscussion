<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638055974">&lt;&lt;also, (totally diff. subj.) can anyone speak to the neccessity of having a <br/>
child hold a writing utensil &quot;the correct way&quot; and why it is important (or <br/>
not?) and whether it matters in what direction letters and numbers are <br/>
formed (bottom up instead of the customary top down on say, a &quot;L&quot;)? i am <br/>
really feeling unqualified on the decision of whether to correct my dd in <br/>
these ways. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello all!  I use to be on this list quite a long time ago, so I doubt if anyone would remember me.  I just thought I jump right in and answer this question.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I hold my writing utensil with the pads of my fingers and a number of adults have tried to correct me.  I would hold the pencil &quot;the correct way&quot; until out of their site and then go back to holding it my way.  I still occassionally get comments from people when I am writing but it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I suppose if it did I could learn how to hold it correctly.  I guess in my long winded sort of way I am trying to tell you that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s neccessary to correct your child on how to hold her pencil.  If the attention bothers her later than I&#39;m sure she will teach herself.  :)  The same also goes for forming the letters.  If it becomes difficult for her to write cursive then I&#39;m sure she will make the adjustments.  I&#39;m not saying that you can&#39;t show her, but if you try to force it on her she will most likely resist.   :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am looking for a good site for making fraction equivalencies <br/>
&gt;easier to<br/>
&gt;&gt; understand. I have used baking (and doubling recipes) and<br/>
&gt;manipulatives<br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if there was anything else really wonderful out<br/>
&gt;there.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This would be for my daughter who is in late elementary level<br/>
&gt;...grade<br/>
&gt;5/6.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How about sewing or making something. Using a measuring tape?  The<br/>
&gt;clock is<br/>
&gt;also useful, especially for comparing quarter of an hour to a quarter<br/>
&gt;of a<br/>
&gt;dollar.  Order two pizza&#39;s and cut them up until you have little<br/>
&gt;bitty<br/>
&gt;pieces. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If she were younger I would suggest Bath Math.  Save all kinds of<br/>
&gt;containers, all sizes and play with them in the bathtub. How many<br/>
&gt;quarts<br/>
&gt;fill up the gallon, how many gallons fill a teaspoon.   You can add<br/>
&gt;food<br/>
&gt;coloring to some of the jugs and mix colors that way too.  But she&#39;s<br/>
&gt;probably to old for this idea. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, remember sometimes understanding comes in spurts. What seems<br/>
&gt;like a<br/>
&gt;struggle this week may be a breeze in a two months.<br/>

&gt;Thank you Lisa...<br/>
&gt;some great ideas. The pizza is one I really like.<br/>
&gt;But especially for reminding me of the &#39;ages and stages&#39; of learning.<br/>
&gt;Point<br/>
&gt;well made. I am definitely getting better at this...perhaps I am more<br/>
&gt;relaxed with the fact that when they rub their eyes and groan  it is<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;clear sign that the material is either not of interest (right now)or<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;they are just not ready ( maybe later).  :) <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;So....now I will be waiting for input from the rest of you on this<br/>
&gt;subject!!!  *grin*<br/>
&gt;i thought i would pass on some exerts from and article &quot;an<br/>
&gt;unschooler&#39;s<br/>
&gt;lament:  what&#39;s so hard to understand&quot; by mary griffith (the author of<br/>
&gt;two<br/>
&gt;handbooks for homeschooling and unschooling).  the article was<br/>
&gt;published in<br/>
&gt;the mag paths of learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&#39;i discovered three elements common to unschooling families:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;an environment conducive to exploration and experimentation.  to put<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;matter bluntly, we unschoolers have lots of stuff around to play<br/>
&gt;with.<br/>
&gt;the nature of that stuff varies with the interests and needs of each<br/>
&gt;family; from books overflowing their shelves, to pots and pans to<br/>
&gt;stack and<br/>
&gt;bang, to backyard garden to cultivate, to a screaming fast computer,<br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt;homes have lots of easily accessible materials around for children to<br/>
&gt;investigate.   if we want our kids to learn by following their own<br/>
&gt;interests, we need to offer them plenty to catch those interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;adults as models and facilitators.  unschooling parents, like most<br/>
&gt;other<br/>
&gt;parents, learn rapidly that &quot;do as i say, not as i do&quot; does not work<br/>
&gt;very<br/>
&gt;well with children.   unschooling kids need people around them who<br/>
&gt;provide<br/>
&gt;models of learning by the way they live and in activities they pursue.<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt;we parents are not obviously curious about and interested in the<br/>
&gt;world<br/>
&gt;around us, if we ourselves never ask questions and search for answers,<br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;we never just try things and see what happens, it&#39;s unlikely that our<br/>
&gt;kids<br/>
&gt;will do so, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;trust that children will learn.   for most people, this is the big<br/>
&gt;obstacle<br/>
&gt;to understanding unschooling and allowing it to work.   perhaps the<br/>
&gt;conventional school education that created our own model of learning<br/>
&gt;creates an impression that learning is supposed to be difficult or<br/>
&gt;boring,<br/>
&gt;or that learning cannot and will not occur unless someone is<br/>
&gt;explicitly<br/>
&gt;teaching, providing information in little age-appro[riate packets,<br/>
&gt;giving<br/>
&gt;quizzes on wednesdays and tests on fridays.   eventually, once we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;bitten<br/>
&gt;our tongues and sat on our hands and held our breaths long enough to<br/>
&gt;let<br/>
&gt;our kids learn to trust their own abilities, we discover that we can<br/>
&gt;trust<br/>
&gt;their abilities as well.   in fact, we discover that it&#39;s almost<br/>
&gt;impossible<br/>
&gt;to stop our kids from learning, that kids, already intensely curious,<br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;eager to indulge their curiosity.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;she goes on to say:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&#39;of course,  even better than applying manufacturing models of more<br/>
&gt;recent<br/>
&gt;vintage than the industrial revolution to education and learning would<br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;to drop the dehumanizing industrial models entirely and start treating<br/>
&gt;both<br/>
&gt;children and adult learners as full, active participants in the<br/>
&gt;educational<br/>
&gt;process.   in other words, instead of looking at improving<br/>
&gt;instructional<br/>
&gt;delivery systems or accountability procedures, shouldn&#39;t we talk<br/>
&gt;seriously<br/>
&gt;with our kids about their particular educational paths, learning from<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt;how they learn best and what they find helpful or obstructive to<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;learning processes?   aren&#39;t our kids entitled to direct a process<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;prepares them for their own future?&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;she concludes by saying:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&#39;however, let me be clear: &quot;because it works&quot; isn&#39;t a sound enough<br/>
&gt;reason<br/>
&gt;for me to advocate unschooling in particular and, more generally,<br/>
&gt;treating<br/>
&gt;our children as full partners in our lives.   our children are fellow<br/>
&gt;human<br/>
&gt;beings - they are our colleagues in the making of the world, in the<br/>
&gt;creation of our joint future.   treating them as fully human, with<br/>
&gt;respect<br/>
&gt;and decency, recognizing them as people just like us, is what we owe<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt;and what we owe ourselves.   it&#39;s simply the right thing to do.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;though this is purely philosophical  i hope it will be of some use to<br/>
&gt;you.<br/>
&gt;for me having a strong grasp of the underlining concept helps me work<br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;all the many of variables we face each day.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Respecting children&#39;s choices<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;this is a great story.  it shows a great level of empathy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think if i concentrate on the values i believe are important, like<br/>
&gt;honesty,<br/>
&gt;tolerance, kindness, respect, she can go through as many &#39;fads&#39; as she<br/>
&gt;wants and<br/>
&gt;come out with things that really matter.<br/>
&gt;fads and peer pressure do cause problems but nothing they will not<br/>
&gt;encounter<br/>
&gt;when they&#39;re adults.  i think it&#39;s very important for kids to develop<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;strength and courage to think for themselves rather than be completely<br/>
&gt;sheltered<br/>
&gt;(though they do need a certain degree so they don&#39;t become<br/>
&gt;overwhelmed) and as<br/>
&gt;adults be confronted with situations that are vastly different than<br/>
&gt;what they<br/>
&gt;are use to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i was just reading the editorial in a new mag paths of learning which<br/>
&gt;is about<br/>
&gt;how compassion/altruism is developed.  richard prystowsky, the author,<br/>
&gt;states<br/>
&gt;that:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&#39;one of the most important of these points [how altruistic attitudes<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;behavior are developed] is that... parental influence was a<br/>
&gt;monumentally<br/>
&gt;influential factor in rescuers&#39; (of victims of the holocaust)<br/>
&gt;attitudes and<br/>
&gt;behavior towards those whom they helped (or tried to help).&#39;<br/>
&gt;also:<br/>
&gt;&#39;...the perceptions of altruistic rescuers: compared to the<br/>
&gt;perceptions of<br/>
&gt;nonrescuers, &quot;significantly more frequently, [rescuers] perceived<br/>
&gt;themselves as<br/>
&gt;like other people, sharing a fundamental humanity&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;finially, he suggests that we:<br/>
&gt;&#39;...ask ourselves how we might develop an ever-stronger ethic of<br/>
&gt;caring so that,<br/>
&gt;more often than not, we can teach with compassion and model this<br/>
&gt;teaching for<br/>
&gt;our children, our students, our communities and the world at large.  <br/>
&gt;...<br/>
&gt;primarily, we want to choose a path of teaching, living and learning<br/>
&gt;that helps<br/>
&gt;us to create the kind of world in which violence would be unknown and<br/>
&gt;rescuer<br/>
&gt;behavior, thus, unnecessary.&#39;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;just some interesting ideas.<br/>

&gt;&gt; My daughter is 8 and when she first became interested, i mean<br/>
&gt;obsessed :-), i<br/>
&gt;&gt; became a little concerned.  I don&#39;t want to dictate what she can and<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;&gt; interrested in though; i want her to learn to make her own choices<br/>
&gt;and not<br/>
&gt;&gt; rely on someone else to tell her what to do, so i just let it go.  I<br/>
&gt;found<br/>
&gt;&gt; that she isn&#39;t into it because it&#39;s cool to be, she really loves<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;&gt; characters and the shows.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have also found some positive aspects to the craze.  One thing,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; something that   just about every kid knows something about, and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s an easy<br/>
&gt;&gt; ice breaker.  She starts conversations with kids all the time with<br/>
&gt;pokemon.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I notice they may start with pokemon, but they end up talking about<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;&gt; playing other things after a while.  And at the few burger king<br/>
&gt;trading<br/>
&gt;&gt; nights we&#39;ve been to, it all begins with pokemon, but after a while<br/>
&gt;the kids<br/>
&gt;&gt; end up in the play area making up new games and just playing.<br/>
&gt;&gt; One of the best &#39;pokemon experiences&#39; i had was when i was with my<br/>
&gt;daughter<br/>
&gt;&gt; at the swap meet, and she told the vendor that he was selling a<br/>
&gt;certain card<br/>
&gt;&gt; for much less than it was worth.  He looked it up, and sure enough,<br/>
&gt;she was<br/>
&gt;&gt; right.  He was very impressed and thanked her for telling him. <br/>
&gt;Afterwards,<br/>
&gt;&gt; she said she really wanted the card, and had enough money to buy it<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I guess we all missed that one.  I am on other lists that are a<br/>
&gt;real<br/>
&gt;mix of folks and we have discussions all the time about religion<br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt;any problem.  But, it doesn&#39;t start off assuming everyone is a<br/>
&gt;certain<br/>
&gt;religion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I went back and read my original post and I guess, not being face<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;face, the first part came off too strong.  I was passing on a warning<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;a lawyer posted on a another list (actually, his was a threat) that it<br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;not legal to post complete articles without posting that you have the<br/>
&gt;author&#39;s permission, that you can &quot;snip&quot; and then link but not post<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;whole thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to the comments on the article, that had to do with the person<br/>
&gt;writing<br/>
&gt;the article and had nothing to do with religion, just his manipulation<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;Biblical verse to suit his personal opinions.  that can hardly be<br/>
&gt;called a<br/>
&gt;flame war of an attack on religion, not by any stretch of the<br/>
&gt;imagination!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  this is a great story.  it shows a great level of empathy. <br/>
&gt;  I think if i concentrate on the values i believe are important, like<br/>
&gt;honesty, tolerance, kindness, respect, she can go through as many<br/>
&gt;&#39;fads&#39; as she wants and come out with things that really matter. <br/>
&gt;  fads and peer pressure do cause problems but nothing they will not<br/>
&gt;encounter when they&#39;re adults.  i think it&#39;s very important for kids<br/>
&gt;to develop the strength and courage to think for themselves rather<br/>
&gt;than be completely sheltered (though they do need a certain degree so<br/>
&gt;they don&#39;t become overwhelmed) and as adults be confronted with<br/>
&gt;situations that are vastly different than what they are use to. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   i was just reading the editorial in a new mag paths of learning<br/>
&gt;which is about how compassion/altruism is developed.  richard<br/>
&gt;prystowsky, the author, states that: <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  &#39;one of the most important of these points [how altruistic attitudes<br/>
&gt;and behavior are developed] is that... parental influence was a<br/>
&gt;monumentally influential factor in rescuers&#39; (of victims of the<br/>
&gt;holocaust) attitudes and behavior towards those whom they helped (or<br/>
&gt;tried to help).&#39; <br/>
&gt;  also: <br/>
&gt;  &#39;...the perceptions of altruistic rescuers: compared to the<br/>
&gt;perceptions of nonrescuers, &quot;significantly more frequently, [rescuers]<br/>
&gt;perceived themselves as like other people, sharing a fundamental<br/>
&gt;humanity&quot;. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  finially, he suggests that we: <br/>
&gt;  &#39;...ask ourselves how we might develop an ever-stronger ethic of<br/>
&gt;caring so that, more often than not, we can teach with compassion and<br/>
&gt;model this teaching for our children, our students, our communities<br/>
&gt;and the world at large.   ...   primarily, we want to choose a path of<br/>
&gt;teaching, living and learning that helps us to create the kind of<br/>
&gt;world in which violence would be unknown and rescuer behavior, thus,<br/>
&gt;unnecessary.&#39; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  just some interesting ideas. <br/>

&gt;    My daughter is 8 and when she first became interested, i mean<br/>
&gt;obsessed :-), i <br/>
&gt;    became a little concerned.  I don&#39;t want to dictate what she can<br/>
&gt;and can&#39;t be <br/>
&gt;    interrested in though; i want her to learn to make her own choices<br/>
&gt;and not <br/>
&gt;    rely on someone else to tell her what to do, so i just let it go. <br/>
&gt;I found <br/>
&gt;    that she isn&#39;t into it because it&#39;s cool to be, she really loves<br/>
&gt;the <br/>
&gt;    characters and the shows. <br/>
&gt;    I have also found some positive aspects to the craze.  One thing,<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;    something that   just about every kid knows something about, and<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s an easy <br/>
&gt;    ice breaker.  She starts conversations with kids all the time with<br/>
&gt;pokemon. <br/>
&gt;    I notice they may start with pokemon, but they end up talking<br/>
&gt;about or <br/>
&gt;    playing other things after a while.  And at the few burger king<br/>
&gt;trading <br/>
&gt;    nights we&#39;ve been to, it all begins with pokemon, but after a<br/>
&gt;while the kids <br/>
&gt;    end up in the play area making up new games and just playing. <br/>
&gt;    One of the best &#39;pokemon experiences&#39; i had was when i was with my<br/>
&gt;daughter <br/>
&gt;    at the swap meet, and she told the vendor that he was selling a<br/>
&gt;certain card <br/>
&gt;    for much less than it was worth.  He looked it up, and sure<br/>
&gt;enough, she was <br/>
&gt;    right.  He was very impressed and thanked her for telling him. <br/>
&gt;Afterwards, <br/>
&gt;    she said she really wanted the card, and had enough money to buy<br/>
&gt;it at the <br/>
&gt;    low price, but she knew that that was the wrong thing to do.  I<br/>
&gt;told her i <br/>
&gt;    was proud of her.  I think if i concentrate on the values i<br/>
&gt;believe are <br/>
&gt;    important, like honesty, tolerance, kindness, respect, she can go<br/>
&gt;through as <br/>
&gt;    many &#39;fads&#39; as she wants and come out with things that really<br/>

&gt; We did this experiment, too. I think it was from Robert Krampf&#39;s<br/>
&gt;Experiment<br/>
&gt;of the Week<br/>
&gt;  We also did stuff on observations--we have soem acreage and woods.<br/>
&gt;My dh<br/>
&gt;and i walked into the woods and put stuff all over that didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;belong(potholder, clothes pin, toy, hair tie, etc) then we went into<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;wood with a bunch of kids and they tried to find the stuff that<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
&gt;there naturally.<br/>
&gt;We also made sound maps--you sit quietly outside with a paper and<br/>
&gt;pencil.<br/>
&gt;Indicate on the paper some land mark ie: a tree, the house and/or the<br/>
&gt;road.<br/>
&gt;Listening carefully, map out the sound that you hear and where they<br/>
&gt;are.  My<br/>
&gt;kids heard birds, cars, trucks, the dogs&#39; tags rattling, the wind, an<br/>
&gt;airplane among other things<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;they have a web site and their first issue is free (the issue this<br/>
&gt;article is in is the second issue).   i enjoy the mag very much.  i<br/>
&gt;find<br/>
&gt;it intelligent and thought provoking as well as some what diverse -<br/>
&gt;not<br/>
&gt;just homeschooling but includes many different alternatives to<br/>
&gt;mainstream thought on education.   they include writes of students<br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;is a very nice addition.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I have never really understood why adults try to trick kids into<br/>
&gt;learning<br/>
&gt;&gt; stuff &quot;without them realizing it.&quot;  To my way of thinking, learning<br/>
&gt;isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; some awful tasting medicine to be disguised and forced down, but<br/>
&gt;something<br/>
&gt;&gt; wonderful to be celebrated and enjoyed! I don&#39;t try to hide<br/>
&gt;learning<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hear, hear!  I thought that needed repeating.<br/>

&gt;Same goes for the concept of &quot;taking a break&quot; from learning.  Um...<br/>

&gt;hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;their new site is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pathsoflearning.com/">http://www.pathsoflearning.com/</a> and it has a link to<br/>
&gt;their<br/>
&gt;old site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;the excerpt is from the new (2nd) issue of a new mag.  they are<br/>
&gt;offering their<br/>
&gt;1st issue free and it&#39;s certainly worth it -in my opinion.   though<br/>
&gt;personally<br/>
&gt;i don&#39;t use, and will probably never, use many of the ideas presented<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;knowledge of the different approaches and philosophies used by<br/>
&gt;different people<br/>
&gt;is invaluable to me.   i love diversity.   i believe the more you know<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;better equipped you are at choosing and modifying what works for you<br/>
&gt;and your<br/>
&gt;family individually.  this mag gives me a lot of info to bolster my<br/>
&gt;own<br/>
&gt;philosophical beliefs because it&#39;s view is educational not just<br/>
&gt;homeschooling<br/>
&gt;so articles are written by people from many different alternative<br/>
&gt;perspectives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;just my opinion,<br/>

&gt;&gt; how much I enjoyed this post.  Can you tell us more about the<br/>

&gt;you mean<br/>

&gt;Subject: spelling bees also writing correction<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hi again unschoolers!  i de-listed for the holiday season and have<br/>
&gt;just read <br/>
&gt;a day or two of digests before this post to re-join!  i see that there<br/>
&gt;is <br/>
&gt;another no-caps erin here!  hi!  i will be erin m., i guess!  hope<br/>
&gt;alot of <br/>
&gt;familiar voices are still here, as well as some valuable new ones!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;i have just a couple of threads on my mind to start me back...<br/>
&gt;first, is anyone participating in their local competition of the <br/>
&gt;scripps-howard spelling bee later this month?  i am wondering how the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;different areas are handling homeschoolers who participate, as i<br/>
&gt;volunteered <br/>
&gt;to coordinate our local support group bee, not knowing that our<br/>
&gt;&quot;region&quot; had <br/>
&gt;not much experience with homeschoolers participating (a single<br/>
&gt;participant <br/>
&gt;here and there) and so we have been doing a lot of problem solving and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;creative co-operating with the county, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;also, (totally diff. subj.) can anyone speak to the neccessity of<br/>
&gt;having a <br/>
&gt;child hold a writing utensil &quot;the correct way&quot; and why it is important<br/>
&gt;(or <br/>
&gt;not?)  and whether it matters in what direction letters and numbers<br/>
&gt;are <br/>
&gt;formed (bottom up instead of the customary top down on say, a &quot;L&quot;)?  <br/>
&gt;i am <br/>
&gt;really feeling unqualified on the decision of whether to correct my dd<br/>
&gt;in <br/>
&gt;these ways.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks for any input!!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;How does it look to whom?  Frankly it&#39;s insulting to be told to sit<br/>

&gt;there a<br/>

&gt;peeping<br/>
&gt;through the curtains at us who are going to gossip to the neighbors?<br/>
&gt;The initial address of the letter in question &quot;As Christian<br/>

&gt;completely<br/>
&gt;lump everyone together on this list as Christian. I take exception to<br/>
&gt;that,<br/>
&gt;not being Christian, as do a number of other list members.  As others<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;mentioned, this is an INCLUSIVE list.  There are plenty of lists out<br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt;that are slanted towards particular religious views, and in particular<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;large number of Christian Homeschooling lists.  I would like to see<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;list remain open and welcoming to those of all faiths.  <br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi erin,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not an expert, but I would guess that the direction of the letters<br/>
&gt;would <br/>
&gt;become more important when the child begins to write in cursive.  I<br/>
&gt;think the <br/>
&gt;letters would join together better if they were written in the<br/>
&gt;&quot;standard&quot; <br/>
&gt;direction.  As far as the pencil &quot;grip&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much<br/>
&gt;about it.  <br/>
&gt;I have always held my pencil incorrectly (resting on my ring finger<br/>
&gt;instead <br/>
&gt;of my middle finger), and have suffered no consequences other than<br/>
&gt;mildly <br/>
&gt;sloppy handwriting.  I would concern myself more with how tightly the<br/>
&gt;child <br/>
&gt;is holding the pencil.  I discovered that one of my sons holds his<br/>
&gt;pencil in <br/>
&gt;a death grip - his little knuckles were turning white.  When he<br/>
&gt;remembers to <br/>
&gt;loosen up a bit his writing is more legible and he enjoys writing more<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;because he doesn&#39;t get fatigued.  Again, I&#39;m only qualified to offer<br/>
&gt;my <br/>
&gt;opinion - YMMV.<br/>
