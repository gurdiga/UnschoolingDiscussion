&lt;&lt; So romantic - I&#39;ve always wondered about those people, what happened <br/>
 to them, did they live happily ever after? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, I think that is the best part about old books. I get shivers down my <br/>
spine just thinking of the history of this seemingly insignificant item in my <br/>
hands. Who read it? What were they like? Did Olga enjoy the gift of Lorna <br/>
Doone that Edith gave her?<br/>
It&#39;s a great way to think about time periods and the goings ons of that time.<br/>
I have the Cook and Peary versions of finding the North Pole...before the <br/>
whole debate began raging. It was still the 1800&#39;s.<br/>
I have this adorable book that reflects the views of men on women...fable <br/>
style, very funny, from the early 1900&#39;s. It has this fabulous picture of the <br/>
author and everything. I love it.<br/>
Funny how books can do so much for some of us, especially the really old <br/>
ones. I hope to have a wonderful collection to sit back and enjoy along with <br/>
my memories of unschooling one day.....<br/>
If you ever come across a decent first edition of the First Jungle Book, <br/>
please let me know Helen.  I have the first American edition of the Second <br/>
and would love to have the pair!!!<br/>
