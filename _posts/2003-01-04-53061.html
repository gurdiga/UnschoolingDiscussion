wish I had just made mac and cheese from a box.. LOL.... BUT, I must say, <br/>
when they do really like what I prepared ( which, fortunately, is more often <br/>
than not)  its worth every ounce of effort and every minute of time it took <br/>
to get it just right..  Needles to say, when I get it right, we have it <br/>
OFTEN.. . lol<br/>
