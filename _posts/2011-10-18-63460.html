<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781662485">My son wrote this little story about his character so he could be part of a game on Terraria ( an online game).<br/>
Sure there are many errors but I think that for a 9 year old that never ever had any lessons on anything related to reading or writing it is pretty good. Probably better than many kids his age in school.<br/>
I have friends that are very relaxed homeschoolers that still make their kids write a paragraph a day. <br/>
I know my son writes and reads a lot on his own terms. He does a lot of research on his games reading online forums, watching and reading comments on YouTube, reading guides and sites.<br/>
It is all because of his passion for video gaming.<br/>
