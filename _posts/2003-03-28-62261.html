<div id="ygrps-yiv-261803752">***They will watch the same show three times in one day. When I ask them<br/>
about it, they don&#39;t really seem<br/>
to know why they watched it again.***<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say something about this.  Even people who make children&#39;s<br/>
shows know that they like to watch the same things over and over.  On<br/>
the Teletubbies they even have them saying &quot;Again, again&quot; after watching<br/>
the video on one of their telly tummies and then they show the same<br/>
video again.  Just like children - they are children.<br/>
<br/>
My kids used to ask to see the same videos over and over, have the same<br/>
books read to them over and over (The Little Prince, Harriet the Spy,<br/>
Holes, any book from the Series of Unfortunate Events series, etc...),<br/>
tell them the same stories about me or their father as children over and<br/>
over, etc....<br/>
<br/>
I read books that I really enjoy over, sometimes 3 or 4 times (Catcher<br/>
in the Rye, Mists of Avalon, Autobiography of a Yogi, etc...)  There&#39;s<br/>
nothing abnormal about it, it&#39;s what people do.  I&#39;ve seen Camelot at<br/>
least 4 times, Hair countless times, Love and Death 15 times in one<br/>
summer, About a Boy twice, Matrix twice, etc...<br/>
<br/>
People like to watch and read things that interest them, I do, so does<br/>
my husband and so do my kids.  I wouldn&#39;t want some one telling me that<br/>
I couldn&#39;t watch McClintock (is that how it&#39;s spelled?) again.  Just<br/>
like I&#39;m not going to tell my kids not to watch Star Wars for the<br/>
umpteenth time.<br/>
