&lt;&lt;  Her behavior is really disrupting the rest of the house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While I understand the frustration of a child that changes their mind <br/>
frequently, and doesn&#39;t have the capability to explain herself (My Sierra is <br/>
very much that way) the worse thing you can do is try to make her talk about <br/>
it.<br/>
She&#39;ll tell you later, if she trusts that you won&#39;t push or make a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, showers are completely up to each individual, it&#39;s a fun time <br/>
for the little ones, not required.<br/>
Usually, they want to get in with me...that&#39;s how I get them clean. But if <br/>
Jalen (only 2 years old) says no to a bath or shower, I don&#39;t make him..ever.<br/>
If he&#39;s really, really dirty and absolutely must be cleaned off, I do a quick <br/>
wipe down.<br/>
Children don&#39;t need baths every day.<br/>
They don&#39;t even need them every other day (and I have kids that enjoy a creek <br/>
and muddy woods in the back yard) to grow up healthy and happy.<br/>
If bath time is a fun treat, it&#39;s usually easy enought to get a child <br/>
interested. Those colorful, fizzy tablets have been a hit around here! <br/>
BUT, if a child is playing and wants to keep goofing off, bath time should <br/>
take a back seat to that.<br/>
Flexibility is a huge part of joyful unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to make a child do something, rather than invite them to do <br/>
something, you&#39;re setting yourself up for a battle of the wills. And my <br/>
Sierra shuts down if you push also. So don&#39;t. I know it&#39;s hard, sometimes our <br/>
desire to have the child just do what we say takes over...but it&#39;s still <br/>
wrong, and a mindfullness about the why&#39;s of our own behavior will help a lot.<br/>
I know my own lack of control as a child makes me act in controlling ways <br/>
sometimes. It&#39;s the fear of not having control that we are really <br/>
feeling...it comes out as anger, but it&#39;s usually fear masked.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Same here.  Kirby hated baths, and we would say &quot;Do you want to wash your toy <br/>
dishes?&quot; or &quot;Do you want to play with the toy boats?&quot; and get him naked and <br/>
wet that way.   But as a sixteen year old who isn&#39;t made to take showers, he <br/>
takes a shower every day.  Once in a while, maybe every month, he might go a <br/>
day without, if he has no work, noplace to go and isn&#39;t feeling very good.  <br/>
But if he has work or karate or anything planned, he just gets in the shower.<br/>
<br/>
Holly pretty  much takes a shower or a bath every day, partly for <br/>
hair-grooming purposes.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty is more like an every two or three days guy, but I&#39;ve very rarely said, <br/>
&quot;Really, you need to take a shower&quot; over the years, and here they are doing <br/>
it because they want to.<br/>
<br/>
Without the option, they can&#39;t possibly want to do it, or do it because they <br/>
want to either one.<br/>
