<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642596909">I have had 3 kids in diapers for 3.5 years now. (I currently have my <br/>
twin 3 year olds and the 1 year old in them)  I am sick and tired of <br/>
changing diapers, especially the GIGANTIC poopy ones.  I have used <br/>
cloth until the last six months or so because I was always changing <br/>
pants that were wet with pee. I could never get those darn cloth <br/>
diapers (I have several different brands and types) to fit and stay <br/>
on correctly once they hit about age 2.5. <br/>
I have tried every method under the sun (potty training) and that is <br/>
where the problem lies.  I should&#39;ve listened to the rational voice <br/>
that told me to just leave it be, S & G will use the potty in their <br/>
own sweet time.  But I didn&#39;t.  Now we are back to diapers once <br/>
again and I have to de-program my boys who say to me when they poop <br/>
in the diaper &quot;momma not get mad at my poop&quot;.  &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
I&#39;d like to resort to the cloth again, much easier on the budget, <br/>
but honestly, rinsing out 3 kids&#39; crappy diapers really does get to <br/>
me. I admit it, I don&#39;t have the &quot;poop patience&quot; any more! <br/>
<br/>
So, to anyone that will listen to a person who has had much <br/>
experience with &quot;potty training&quot;.....DON&#39;T DO IT! (I have six kids. <br/>
Fortunately three of them do not still wear diapers!) Just go with <br/>
the flow even if you feel like you just can&#39;t take yet another <br/>
diaper change.  Then you won&#39;t have to undo all of your mistakes <br/>
like me :-(</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922911106">Oh, yeah...I can relate!!  I don&#39;t have twins, but I have a 4 yo, 3 yo and a<br/>
1 yo.  My 4 yo, Stella, spoiled me.  I didn&#39;t do ANYTHING.  My husband<br/>
brought a potty chair home one day when she was about 18 mos old.  I said,<br/>
&quot;put it in the playroom, and I&#39;ll tell her what it&#39;s for.&quot;  I did.  She<br/>
played with her dolls in it--every way, except the way it was intended!<br/>
LOL... but the week she turned 2, she told me she didn&#39;t want to wear<br/>
diapers anymore, she wanted to use a potty like me.  (She has always been<br/>
extremely verbal--I joke that I can&#39;t remember when she couldn&#39;t talk!)<br/>
Anyway, that was that.  She never used a diaper again, even at night!)<br/>
<br/>
Annie, the now 3 yo, is a completely different person with a totally<br/>
different maturation schedule for nearly everything!  I sometimes wonder if<br/>
my one year old will quite using diapers before her! LOL...Anyway, I, too<br/>
have gotten REALLY impatient with her, mostly because she has shown me that<br/>
she can remember to go potty, and if she is naked, she often does go for<br/>
both pee and poop.  But if she has anything on, she just goes in her pants.<br/>
Very inconvenient for me, especially since she often insists on &quot;training&quot;<br/>
pants or panties.  I did realize about a month and a half ago, that I needed<br/>
to quit showing any emotion about it at all, including happiness or<br/>
excitement when she goes in the potty.  I just say, &quot; You sound pleased with<br/>
yourself!&quot; when she tells me she went on the potty, and leave it at that.<br/>
Poker Face.  It&#39;s working.  She&#39;s going more often than ever, and we are all<br/>
a whole lot more relaxed.  She has been going around naked as much as<br/>
possible and that is helping too.  I do mightily look forward to when she is<br/>
going on the potty even when she has pants on.  OH, and I almost<br/>
forgot...technically, she isn&#39;t using a &quot;potty&quot;. She also INSISTS on using<br/>
the big toilet, even though she is very short and can hardly reach (doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to use a stool either...sigh...), so I really have to help her<br/>
alot....along with changing what seems like BAZILLIONS of cloth diapers with<br/>
the baby as well.  He is by far the most difficult to change of any of my<br/>
kids, and more difficult than even my friends&#39; &quot;difficult changers&quot;.<br/>
Ugh...He&#39;s got some MOVES, I tell you!  Sometimes, I actually have to lay my<br/>
legs on top of his arms to keep him still enough to get a diaper on him.  I<br/>
SO look forward to passing my prefolds along to someone else! haha...<br/>
<br/>
I know it will come.  I just have to BREATHE in the meantime!<br/>

You are so right about the diapers leaking when the kids get bigger. I found<br/>
that leaking was a cue to go up a size in the covers. Also when Jayn was<br/>
bigger I was double diapering with the &quot;outside&quot; one in the butterfly fold,<br/>
with the inner trifold. I was using the Velcro fastening covers with the<br/>
elastic legs with gussets at the leg opening.<br/>
<br/>
I was fortunate for most of Jayn&#39;s infancy to have a diaper service that did<br/>
not want you to rinse, but just dump the whole thing into the sealed<br/>
container. By the time Jayn was really big, I was just washing about a dozen<br/>
per week, mostly pee, and I was rinsing in the toilet in the case of poo.<br/>
