   We all overreact sometimes, at least I do. &lt;G&gt;  I would want my children<br/>
to know more than the PBS schedule, that&#39;s for sure.  Although some days<br/>
around here I think all the boys know are computer and video game strategies<br/>
and pokemon..... but then I sit and listen to the pokemon talk and I realize<br/>
there is a whole host of important things going on, things found ont those<br/>
boring school worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
 One of the things that has helped me in this journey is getting up and<br/>
getting out of our house.  We went to the dam about two weeks ago.  We<br/>
talked about currents, fish, the health of the lake, why we needed a dam,<br/>
locks, barges -- it was a great day. Unschooling requires the parent to be a<br/>
detective sometimes.  The neat this that once you hone your skills of<br/>
observation, you discover the children really are learning more than the PBS<br/>
schedule.  PLUS you learn how to put neat stuff in their path, so they do<br/>
come across the things you think are important.  I&#39;ve purchased books and<br/>
other materials just to have on hand.....just in case someone had an attack<br/>
of the academics. &lt;G&gt;  Some of it has actually been used.  Matter of fact, I<br/>
bought an used Oak Meadow First grade package.  We&#39;ve used some of the ideas<br/>
on creating special books for each child.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you tell us what things you would like the kids to be doing, and<br/>
let us brainstorm ways of doing them.  We&#39;ll see if our creative powers are<br/>
still here, or whether they&#39;ve gone to sleep with the spring allergies<br/>
everyone is having.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hi  lisa,<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure whah I mean. It&#39;s just that dh has his reservations, as do I ,<br/>
 about sending our kids into the world knowing nothing but the PBS sched.<br/>
 O.K. Perhaps I&#39;m overreacting here, but I still have my concerns. Any advice<br/>
 would be appreciated.<br/>
 Amy &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny -- PBS schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, what I did (so take it for what it&#39;s worth!) as a sanity check at the <br/>
beginning of hsing was to go to the state&#39;s standards.  They are online here <br/>
in Florida.  Look under the Dept. of Ed listings.   These are a line-by-line <br/>
explanation of what the schools are supposed to be teaching the kids in each <br/>
grade.<br/>
<br/>
I found these to be reassuring that, even tho we have tended more and more <br/>
toward relaxed hsing and unschooling, we are still hitting all the bases.  <br/>
The standards were not at all stringent in my estimation -- more of a <br/>
minimum.  But they were a sanity check for me.<br/>
<br/>
And there is a series out called What your X Grader Should Know.  Some people <br/>
say they have been very happy using this as a guide.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can use all of these tools, and more, and still happily hs, with <br/>
or without a formal curriculum or part of one.  But I think it takes time to <br/>
figure out what is best for you and yours.  And then that changes at just <br/>
about the time you get it all figured out!  :):)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
