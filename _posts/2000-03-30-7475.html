<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396936573">This is a snip:<br/>
probablyworking, having a child in school and a two yr old are absolutely as<br/>
draining-- esp the running around -- if not more so than being home with<br/>
several ages all day.  just my opinion.<br/>
(end snip)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve appreciated everyone&#39;s thoughts on recharging batteries. I think when <br/>
you give to others as much as mothers do, you need to nurture yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the times I have spent as a stay-at-home mom have been MORE tiring <br/>
than when I work, I think because the day seems so long, whereas my work <br/>
schedule breaks things up a bit. Also, I don&#39;t do that much running around <br/>
on account of the kids; I&#39;ve limited things like sports and lessons outside <br/>
school because we have little enough time together as it is (sigh). And <br/>
school is 3 blocks away. I am looking forward to summer; I have been turning <br/>
over in my mind the idea of doing away with school in our lives. Just wish I <br/>
had friends nearby like some of you all. But there is an unschooling group <br/>
in the area that I plan to visit so maybe I&#39;ll find some likeminded souls.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Carol and all, for the comments.<br/>
