I have a question for everyone in the northeast and canada.  Me and <br/>
dh have decided that we want to relocate.  Huge decsion for us!  <br/>
Right now we are in the preliminary stages of getting the business <br/>
ready to sell, figuring out how his parents will survive or if they <br/>
should come with us and of course where our business would do well.  <br/>
We are considering the northeast (narrowed down to VA, MD, DE, CT, <br/>
ME, MA, PA, NH, VT and even considering PEI in Canada.  <br/>
<br/>
1: How are these states for homeschooling, obviously unschooling in <br/>
terms of being relaxed?<br/>
2. We really want to live a more relaxed, laid back lifestyle.  Any <br/>
recommendations on cities that have an appreciation for that instead <br/>
of what car you drive? (we live in Boca Raton, FL now pretty much a <br/>
place of excess and we have had our fill)<br/>
3. completely OT: We run a british grocery business and bakery.  We <br/>
would like to continue that and specialize in teas and such.  Anyone <br/>
know any places that are needing of such a thing or would appreciate <br/>
artisan baking and the such.  <br/>
Go to Portland, Maine. With a very short car ride you can be in a pretty <br/>
rural area, but the city is big enough and has LOTS of culture. AND it&#39;s only a <br/>
couple hours to Boston. I think the homeschooling laws are pretty easy, and it&#39;s <br/>
hard to get too much more laid-back than Mainers. The city has had a major <br/>
renaissance. ANd I bet a British Grocery store would do well there.<br/>
