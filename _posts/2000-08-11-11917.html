<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742403507">I&#39;m partially answering your question but also making a suggestion.  I&#39;ve had <br/>
hamsters and don&#39;t consider them to be good pets for children.  They are <br/>
prone to bite and not very friendly.  I&#39;m sure some may have had different <br/>
experiences but I&#39;ve owned quite a few and my dd has one now (given to her by <br/>
friends who were bored with it).  The thing has already bitten both of us and <br/>
she is too afraid to handle it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I have also owned quite a number of rats and they make far superior pets.  <br/>
They love people (get them from a breeder who handles them from birth) and I <br/>
have never been bitten by even one of them.  They are much smarter and more <br/>
active.<br/>
<br/>
As for protecting them from the other pets, get a cage that locks securely.  <br/>
We had our rats with our cat and kept them in a wire cage that locked very <br/>
tightly.  The cat could come up to the cage and smell them but it was <br/>
impossible for her to reach them.  She even managed to knock the cage off the <br/>
table once but other than being shaken up a bit they were safe until we got <br/>
to them.  We even put the rats out on the lawn once in a while and they were <br/>
safe from any neighborhood animals too.  The fish tank kind of cage doesn&#39;t <br/>
give them enough protection, the lids can be pried up and if knocked over it <br/>
could break or even suffocate the animal.<br/>

&lt;&lt; O.K., now that I&#39;ve made a short story long.. my 7 yo dd now wants a <br/>
hamster, so  now that I&#39;m older and more responsible (sometimes), I&#39;m doing <br/>
my homework. My 2 biggest concerns are determining the sex of the hamster <br/>
before we buy it (especially making sure if it&#39;s pg or not) and what to do <br/>
about our dog and cats. We&#39;re already planning on keeping them in her room, <br/>
but I&#39;m worried they might sneak in. Any suggestions or advice appreciated.<br/>

I have lots of experience with hampsters and mice, animal lover that I am :0) <br/>
 First, I would suggest a &quot;teddy bear&quot; hampster, as they are usually very <br/>
calm.  Second, if it is a boy, you will see very large....um, whats a nice <br/>
way to put this.....round things hanging from the underside/rear of the <br/>
animal (geez!  I hate these delicate descriptions!) :0).  Now for how to keep <br/>
the animal, we have always had cats and hampsters (usually considered a bad <br/>
combination), but if your hampster lives in a glass fish aquarium (without <br/>
the water&lt;g&gt;), you should not have a problem.  A plastic frame with mesh, <br/>
that fits perfectly on the aquarium, may be purchased at the pet store to <br/>
keep the little critter safe from the bigger critters.  Make sure you use <br/>
pine shavings, not cedar, as cedar can cause respiratory problems in <br/>
hampsters.  An enclosed hampter excercise ball can also be purchased in the <br/>
pet store, and is a lot of fun.  It is a plastic ball with air vents that you <br/>
can put the hampster in and close up, then he can run around the house <br/>
without causing damage, or being eaten by the bigger critters.  Hope this <br/>
helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598771330">Well, we told the kidlets NO hamsters.  They don&#39;t live very long and most<br/>
kids get tired of them real quick as there isn&#39;t much you can do &quot;with&quot;<br/>
them.  My little sister had about a dozen &quot;Rosie&#39;s&quot; when she was little and<br/>
each time one died my mother would sneak in a new one.  I&#39;m not sure who<br/>
was fooling who &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, that said, I would buy from a private party, not a pet store.  If you<br/>
buy a habitrail instead of one of the wire cage type things be sure that it<br/>
isn&#39;t in the sun or in a hot area of the room (by a heater or air vent)<br/>
because the habitrails heat up like an oven.<br/>

I need some advice here. I had hamsters when I was young, but I must admit<br/>
was pretty niave about them and their care. Then right before my husband<br/>
and I got married we got one and surprise! three days later it had babies.<br/>
I held on to them (or at least the ones the mom didn&#39;t eat) for 5 weeks<br/>
then brought the whole litter and mom and cage to the pet store, put ti<br/>
downa and walked out. Part of me felt bad, but I really felt that I had<br/>
fufilled my obligation and we we&#39;re leaving for our honeymoon. O.K., now<br/>
that I&#39;ve made a short story long.. my 7 yo dd now wants a hamster, so  now<br/>
that I&#39;m older and more responsible (sometimes), I&#39;m doing my homework. My<br/>
2 biggest concerns are determining the sex of the hamster before we buy it<br/>
(especially making sure if it&#39;s pg or not) and what to do about our dog and<br/>
cats. We&#39;re already planning on keeping them in her room, but I&#39;m worried<br/>
they might sneak in. Any suggestions or advice appreciated.<br/>

Rats have a rather large &quot;package&quot; as well, we refer to this as his <br/>
&quot;manhood&quot;.  *grin*  We prefer female rats, however, their temperament seems <br/>
calmer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rats are great pets!  I never thought I&#39;d want one.  Ds was after me and I <br/>
kept saying &#39;no!&#39;.  Then I was introduced to one and liked her personality. <br/>
(Can a rat have a &#39;person&#39; ality?  Maybe I should change that to <br/>
&#39;temperament&#39;.)  She turned out to be one of the best pets we&#39;ve ever had!  <br/>
We could let her out in the room we were in and play with her, (although I <br/>
was not willing to allow free-roaming!)  She would even come when we called <br/>
her.  We put our&#39;s on a little leash and took her for walks outside.  They <br/>
are clean and friendly.<br/>
