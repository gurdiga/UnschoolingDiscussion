<div id="ygrps-yiv-840832321">Hi all!  Thanks for such a warm welcome.  :)<br/>
I also have one son who is gifted and I found out by accident when he was<br/>
four that he knew how to read already.  I also think it was his love for the<br/>
children&#39;s shows because I sure didn&#39;t teach him to read!<br/>
It is my 4 year old that is lagging so far behind I just don&#39;t know what to<br/>
do with her but keep waiting for her to be ready to school with me.  I<br/>
thought I was gonna show everyone how much better schooling at home is with<br/>
her because she will be my first one who is entirely schooled at home.  But<br/>
she is NEVER gonna be ready to start.  Ugh!  Now my husband is asking if<br/>
maybe we should let her go to school for a year to get her started.  Maybe<br/>
it would help, he says.  :(<br/>
After having my first 3 babies in the hospital and studying midwifery long<br/>
enough to know what exactly the medical folk do to screw up a perfectly good<br/>
labor and make you grateful they &quot;saved&quot; your baby, I feel it would take a<br/>
lot of courage for me to birth at the hospital!  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you,<br/>
<br/>
Kandice<br/>
If I could show you how to make $300-$800+ mo. part-time at home with no selling, inventory,or huge <br/>
start-up cost, would you like to hear about it?   NOT Amway!  ;)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:kandyc@...">kandyc@...</a>  <br/>

<br/>
My son liked Elmo&#39;s world, and watched it a few times, but only if I<br/>
remembered to turn it on 15 minutes before the end of the show.  If I turned<br/>
the TV on at the beginning of Sesame street, he&#39;d watch a while and then<br/>
wander away.  I wasn&#39;t sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oddly, Brenda, when I watched it was when we were stationed in Germany! I was <br/>
*just* pregnant and living in the Amelia Earhart Hotel next to the Mainz <br/>
hospital. The only tv was Armed Forces (preprogrammed, Sesame Street one hour <br/>
everyday, no other channels). And there was nothing I liked about it. I&#39;m <br/>
sure my constant nausea didn&#39;t help! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I hated Shari Lewis when I was little and wasn&#39;t thrilled to see (hear) her <br/>
come back, but my kids all loved it.    I came to appreciate it through <br/>
Kirby&#39;s eyes.  He was always interested in voices and puppets anyway, and <br/>
when she came along and was doing ventriloquism right in front of him, he was <br/>
enchanted.<br/>
<br/>
There are complaints I could make about Sesame Street, about specific moments <br/>
or little videos which are really outdated and I wish they hadn&#39;t shown.  I <br/>
wish they had promoted breastfeeding instead of showing bottlefed babies.  <br/>
But musically it&#39;s wonderful.  Every musical style ever was represented.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re not so musically inclined that it wasn&#39;t <br/>
fun.   Because I see it primarily as a music show, and they&#39;re good at that.<br/>
<br/>
Jim Henson and Frank Oz were really good musicians (Frank Oz probably still <br/>
is, but he&#39;s directing movies more than being Bert or Miss Piggy now), and <br/>
they did all that in funny voices.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I saw a video on Sesame Street that showed kids getting ready for <br/>
preschool, and showed kids what a fun thing preschool was.  I wish, <br/>
when they do things to get kids excited about school and show them <br/>
getting on these cool yellow school buses, that they would also show <br/>
the kids at home who don&#39;t go to school, and how much fun they&#39;re <br/>
having too.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course that&#39;s not true of only Sesame Street, but of most tv shows <br/>
in general. <br/>
