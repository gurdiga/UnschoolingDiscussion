<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420812104"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I fully realize that there are some here who believe a passive session of <br/>
&gt; watching TV is as valuable to a developing mind as an active session of <br/>
&gt; looking for bugs, playing in a sandbox, taking a hike through the <br/>
&gt; woods and <br/>
&gt; chasing the local jackrabbits and squirrels, or building forts out of <br/>
&gt; boxes.  I frankly think the TV is not a good substitute for anything that <br/>
&gt; involves activity. <br/>
