I just &quot;shared&quot; this with the group a minute ago  :~&gt;<br/>
LOL....we must be on the same wavelength<br/>
I also was concerned about the relevancy since I haven&#39;t been joining in the <br/>
conversations lately  ;~)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the repeat, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just couldn&#39;t let the &#39;No&#39; side win--such an awfully worded question; and <br/>
of course the socialization issue---AACK<br/>

Attention homeschooling and unschooling friends<br/>
I just got this, went there, and am sharing. It isn&#39;t spam if it is <br/>
verifiable so I better not get flamed. It is relevant and it is real. I was <br/>
just there.   Mary/in Idaho/starfreedom (whatever)<br/>

          p.s., sorry for any repeats guys.</div>
