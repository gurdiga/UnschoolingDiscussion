<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049691551">Wow Shannon, thanks for all that info. We live in<br/>
Ocean County NJ and where we live there are few lights<br/>
so night viewing of the plants is awesome! And we<br/>
don&#39;t have a telescope! The moon is my favorite! What<br/>
county in NJ are you in?<br/>
Keep looking up ^ <br/>
Jill<br/>

&gt; My dd is only 17 m/o, but I&#39;ve been unschooling<br/>
&gt; myself lately (lol!) and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been looking at a lot of cool websites on<br/>
&gt; astronomy so I thought<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d share a few.<br/>

&gt; This is the Astronomy<br/>
&gt; Picture of the Day. This is their caption -<br/>
&gt; &quot;Discover the cosmos! Each<br/>
&gt; day a different image or photograph of our<br/>
&gt; fascinating universe is<br/>
&gt; featured, along with a brief explanation written by<br/>
&gt; a professional<br/>
&gt; astronomer.&quot; I go here everyday and look at a<br/>
&gt; fascinating pic and read<br/>
&gt; the explanation. Plus, the explanations are usually<br/>
&gt; full of links, so I<br/>
&gt; spend awhile clicking and learning. Tho I have to<br/>
&gt; admit, some days and<br/>
&gt; some links are a bit over my head. Not all! But<br/>
&gt; some.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is absolutely great. Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.seds.org/">http://www.seds.org/</a><br/>
&gt; which is Students<br/>
&gt; for the Exploration and Development of Space. I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t even checked it<br/>
&gt; all out yet. I spend all my time at their The Nine<br/>
&gt; Planets Solar System<br/>
&gt; Tour<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I<br/>
&gt; spent the first day following all the moon links.<br/>
&gt; And another day<br/>
&gt; following all the sun links. Those are my two<br/>
&gt; favorites that I keep<br/>
&gt; going back to. I haven&#39;t completed the tour yet, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; taking my time :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally Thursday&#39;s Classroom<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thursdaysclassroom.com/.">http://thursdaysclassroom.com/.</a> This is<br/>
&gt; a NASA website for teachers and students with ideas<br/>
&gt; for study and<br/>
&gt; classroom (but fine for us too). I ended up<br/>
&gt; following their links to<br/>
&gt; read about the South Pole and diary entries of some<br/>
&gt; college students who<br/>
&gt; went there (they are trying to figure out if it will<br/>
&gt; be a good location<br/>
&gt; for astronomy). It changes on a regular basis, tho,<br/>
&gt; so the topic will<br/>
&gt; not always be the same. <br/>
