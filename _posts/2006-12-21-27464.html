<div id="ygrps-yiv-296188028">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say Merry Christmas to you all!<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s been a great year in this unschooling journey and I look forward to <br/>
sharing more with you in 2007.<br/>
<br/>
This group has been such a wonderful source of learning, support and <br/>
strength for me this year and I thank you all for being a part of that.<br/>
<br/>
May your Christmas be a safe and happy one filled with much love.<br/>
<br/>
Kindest Wishes<br/>
<br/>
Kim</div>
