<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ned - do you and Luz see this happening? Unschooling parents refusing to give<br/>
&gt; their child help? I haven&#39;t seen that. The unschooling parents I have seen<br/>
&gt; seem to all be incredibly resourceful, supportive, involved, observant,<br/>
&gt; intuitive, responsive facilitators. It wouldn&#39;t occur to me to worry that a<br/>
&gt; kid might want to learn to read and that an unschooling parent would not<br/>
&gt; figure out how best to help them or get help for them. Is that really<br/>
&gt; something you worry about?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --pamS<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pam, for your info, I have definitely seen this happen! One parent with<br/>
two teenage boys borrowed some of my books on unschooling and thought<br/>
that was the perfect solution to her homeschooling problems: her boys<br/>
were not very enthusiastic about learning, and she had apparently<br/>
enforced some things on them. Now introduced to unschooling, she decided<br/>
she would never force them to do anything they didn&#39;t want to and would<br/>
let them do what they wanted on their own instead, to be sure she didn&#39;t<br/>
do the wrong thing. She is a friendly loving lady. But three years<br/>
later, her 16 year old son still cannot read. He occasionally says he<br/>
wants to and wants help but she can&#39;t give it to him and doesn&#39;t model<br/>
what to do or look into it far enough to come up with the right help to<br/>
give him. So she rather complacently does nothing rather than &quot;violate&quot;<br/>
him. He is 6 feet tall, a nice boy but embarrassed to have anyone see<br/>
him trying to read, even his father.  HE made some slight progress with<br/>
some easy readers I gave her that I thought would interest him, and they<br/>
did, but she hasn&#39;t taken it further.<br/>
<br/>
Another woman I know got the &quot;don&#39;t tell him what to do for<br/>
homeschooling&quot; bug and her 10 year old son heartily subscribes to this<br/>
flaunting it to everyone around him. She did take him out of some school<br/>
or other; she is busy working as a single mom, and just kowtows to him<br/>
when he says &quot;I don&#39;t have to learn anything!&quot; No modeling, no other<br/>
ideas put forth for him, just yeah - that&#39;s the philosophy we are<br/>
following, she says.<br/>
I invited them to go with a group of homeschoolers for whom I had<br/>
arranged a rather neat field trip to a nature park where the naturalist<br/>
used to be an archeologist and he showed us artifacts he had made using<br/>
methods of the early Americans in our region. We got to use<br/>
spear-throwers and carve holes in rock using sand and bamboo, chop wood<br/>
with shell axes and stuff like that. IT was really fun! But this boy was<br/>
rude to everyone including the naturalist and selfish. The mom left him<br/>
off another day with a different group activity of this naturalist, and<br/>
he was asked not to come back because he wouldn&#39;t stick with the group<br/>
when they walked through the woods. Obviously, he needs time to chill<br/>
out and decompress, but his mom was not giving that to him. SHe was<br/>
still trying to find other places for him to be and not exerting much<br/>
influence for the positive with him because she didn&#39;t know how to. With<br/>
her version of unschooling, she felt she didn&#39;t have to; she was<br/>
following her understanding of the philosophy and thought be being let<br/>
be somehow he would magically do well. <br/>
<br/>
A third story: a mom with two little boys about 3 and 4 1/2 and one 8<br/>
year old daughter. SHe quit her job and took her kids out of preschool<br/>
and school to spend time with them. But again, her version of<br/>
unschooling was  not restricting them in any way - letting them be free<br/>
to do exactly what they want. She extolled the virtues of letting them<br/>
take off their clothes and jump in the mud, run, play. Sounds so free,<br/>
doesn&#39;t it? I&#39;ve done it! BUt these kids were running in circles, not<br/>
communicating with anyone, not really aware of their environment. Like<br/>
kids act when they are tired but still playing frantically. In fact when<br/>
they came along with me to a park, these kids could not listen to and<br/>
speak to anyone else there. THey were wild, and the mother ended up<br/>
sending her daughter back to public school because she hated being home<br/>
with her brothers and couldn&#39;t get her mother&#39;s attention and help. I<br/>
spoke with this lady today. She thought she was going to find other moms<br/>
to exchange kid time with. Would you want to? I am going to write up<br/>
some very specific things for her to read and think and practice so her<br/>
daughter can come home again maybe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I provide an umbrella school service in Florida so parents can do what<br/>
they want to do with their kids and not have to register with the county<br/>
or send in any tests to the government. I have parents at all phases of<br/>
transition in how they homeschool. Some of the worst are the ones who<br/>
use &quot;letting them learn on their own and do only what they want to&quot; as a<br/>
substitute for really getting involved with their kids and understanding<br/>
and helping them. <br/>
<br/>
I do find people can be very confused by the unschooling philosophy and<br/>
though something about it sounds right to them, they get hung up in not<br/>
doing anything so that they won&#39;t do the wrong thing! I try to help them<br/>
transition, cut out the workbooks, add lots of doing things out and<br/>
about in life, and reading together, and talking together. I try to help<br/>
them shorten their learning curve and lighten up on school-like things,<br/>
and get to know and appreciate their kids.<br/>
<br/>
So I find that less dogma of any sort is better. Better to just be<br/>
explicit and give lots of examples of what TO DO than what not to. And<br/>
new unschooling parents do have things TO DO - like talk and listen,<br/>
find out things themselves, model an interest in researching thing and<br/>
going places, doing things and enjoying life. These are positives.<br/>
Leaving their kids alone to do what they want does not encompass how to<br/>
be a parent - the moms usually need a new view of their roles. <br/>
<br/>
It is actually too close to what many have done by leaving their kids<br/>
off at a school. Don&#39;t interfere - learning will happen.... Nobody grows<br/>
or changes if the kids are just left to be by themselves and don&#39;t have<br/>
a loving parent there to interact when needed. New homeschoolers often<br/>
have to make a real effort to BE with their kids when they have so<br/>
conveniently been without them for so long.<br/>
<br/>
 I think a discussion of the different aspects of learning vs teaching<br/>
is very helpful .... up to a point. All people do both, I think, teach<br/>
and learn in the natural scheme of life. Learning that there is a<br/>
give-and-take in these things is very valuable.  Making &quot;teaching&quot; a<br/>
forbidden word is foolish in my eyes and misplaces the correct emphasis<br/>
with a somewhat arbitrary stance. That is just too confusing for many<br/>
people.  Time and effort is better spent in making clearly what you mean<br/>
by unschooling with lots of examples, as people are asking for and<br/>
giving now with &quot;what my homeschooling day is like&quot; and various<br/>
suggestions. Everyone finds there own way of doing it in the end, but<br/>
the examples and support of others do help.<br/>
<br/>
Another viewpoint for you to consider.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Just like I think that MOST PEOPLE will hear you say &quot;Kids need phonics&quot; and<br/>
&gt; think you mean &quot;Kids need to be taught to read using a formal comprehensive<br/>
&gt; phonics program&quot; - I also think MOST PEOPLE hear the word &quot;teach&quot; or<br/>
&gt; &quot;teacher&quot; and think of someone deciding what, when, where, and how kids are<br/>
&gt; supposed to learn something and then testing and grading how well they do at<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now - I&#39;m going to be pretty darn sure that long-time unschoolers don&#39;t mean<br/>
&gt; either of those things. If I hear a long-time unschooler say, &quot;Yeah- I taught<br/>
&gt; my daughter how to do long division,&quot; it doesn&#39;t bring up those connotations<br/>
&gt; to me. In that case, knowing how unschooling workds, I&#39;m going to assume this<br/>
&gt; came about because the kid wanted to do something and the parent offered the<br/>
&gt; information and so on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT - here, on this list, with nearly a thousand people and MANY of those<br/>
&gt; people who are just trying to figure out what all this unschooling stuff is<br/>
&gt; all about - many of those people start out not even able to conceive of what<br/>
&gt; unschooling is - it seems to me that people are going to be very confused and<br/>
&gt; even misled if you say either that kids need phonics or that kids need to be<br/>
&gt; taught. Again - I GET the point - I just think that in THIS context it is<br/>
&gt; something that we have to stop and clear up every time it gets said because<br/>
&gt; it is so easily and so likely misconstrued.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is okay - words can have multiple levels of meanings. &quot;I am my child&#39;s<br/>
&gt; first and most important teacher.&quot;  &quot;I am my child&#39;s parent and I am NOT my<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s teacher.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have said both of those and meant them and they didn&#39;t contradict each<br/>
&gt; other IN the contexts in which I said them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - in a context where there are lots of new-to-unschooling people -<br/>
&gt; remembering that &quot;phonics&quot; and &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; have connotations to<br/>
&gt; them that we don&#39;t mean - it is more helpful to avoid those terms and just<br/>
&gt; talk more descriptively about what we mean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234531259">Good post- I get your point that people might think that saying &quot;no teaching&quot; <br/>
means saying that the parents shouldn&#39;t demonstrate anything, explain <br/>
anything, pick out interesting videos or books, help kids learn <br/>
anything...etc.<br/>
<br/>
But I do think that from the examples given, that it has been clear that <br/>
nobody was ever saying that. Sandra, for example, has talked at length about <br/>
helping her kids learn all kinds of things. I&#39;ve recently posted some ways to <br/>
help kids learn some math stuff. I think that anybody reading for more than a <br/>
few days would realize that the point of not using the word &quot;teach&quot; is to <br/>
retrain old patterns of thinking - to help people break away from thinking <br/>
that kids only learn what teachers teach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is actually too close to what many have done by leaving their kids<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THIS makes sense - sort of. I mean - I can imagine it, even though I can&#39;t <br/>
say I&#39;ve EVER seen it in practice. Except that people who don&#39;t want to <br/>
interact and support their kids&#39; learning would just leave them IN school -- <br/>
at least that&#39;s what makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t interfere - learning will happen.... Nobody grows&gt;  or changes if the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids are just left to be by themselves and don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; a loving parent there to interact when needed. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had this discussion on this list a month or so ago - people were posting <br/>
about this exact thing - and were attacked for supposedly saying that kids <br/>
needed to be &quot;entertained all the time.&quot; Just can&#39;t win, can we? &lt;G&gt; But - <br/>
yes I agree with this point. I just don&#39;t think it is a big issue. I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen unschooling parents who didn&#39;t work hard to enrich their kids&#39; lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t equate unschooling with leaving kids alone and not supporting their <br/>
interests. That is the opposite of unschooling, in my book.<br/>
<br/>
New homeschoolers often<br/>

&gt; conveniently been without them for so long.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think they do - yes. Sometimes they have to make an effort to observe them <br/>
carefully - and not to DIRECT them all the time, too.<br/>

&gt; give-and-take in these things is very valuable.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - that&#39;s one point. The big point is that now that the  kids are out of <br/>
school, they don&#39;t need mom or dad to become their &quot;teacher&quot;  or to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
them -- they don&#39;t need a teacher if they aren&#39;t &quot;doing school.&quot;  See - here <br/>
I&#39;m using teacher and teach in the very common usage where teach means that a <br/>
teacher decides what should be learned, when, how and tests whether it was <br/>
learned. Unschoolers reject that and it would be easier to keep that clear if <br/>
we used &quot;help kids learn&quot; instead of teach, I think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of the same people saying that &quot;you don&#39;t need to &quot;teach&quot;&quot; and &quot;you <br/>
don&#39;t need to become their &quot;teacher&quot;&quot; are also those of us who post <br/>
b&#39;zillions of ideas and anecdotes about our unschooling lives. So - yeah - I <br/>
agree with you and do it all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know someone who uses Calvert Curriculum. She is the teacher in that family <br/>
and is spending her summer trying to figure out what she&#39;s going to teach her <br/>
son in the fall. She&#39;s sweet and joyful and loves her kids and interacts <br/>
really nicely with them and pays close attention to their interests and does <br/>
her best to support them. They all are happy and content with how things are <br/>
working. That doesn&#39;t make it unschooling. Why not? Well - because all the <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;  - including the planning, carrying out, and assessment -- is <br/>
incompatible with unschooling, that&#39;s why. If someone comes here and wants to <br/>
know about unschooling and she says, &quot;Well, look at all the &#39;teaching plans&#39; <br/>
and pick out which kind of teacher you prefer to be and buy the curriculum <br/>
and teach it to your child,&quot; it would be really wrong of us not to step up <br/>
and say, &quot;That isn&#39;t unschooling.&quot; If we want people to understand, they need <br/>
to understand that traditional-style &quot;teaching&quot; in the widest meaning of the <br/>
word is not necessary then it would be more clear if we didn&#39;t confuse the <br/>
issue so  much..<br/>

of learning rather than teaching, that it can help new unschoolers to lose <br/>
that word *for awhile*.  The only people that seem to use the word <br/>
&quot;forbidden&quot; in connection with the word teach are the ones complaining <br/>
about the fact that it&#39;s &quot;forbidden&quot;.  Same with talk about &quot;rules&quot; for <br/>
unschooling.  Someone suggests that it might help to think of something a <br/>
certain way, and soon after someone complains about all the unschooling <br/>
&quot;rules&quot;.<br/>
