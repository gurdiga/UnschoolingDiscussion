<div id="ygrps-yiv-80410806">I have the hotel information for the 2005 Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference.<br/>
 <br/>
We will be just across the river from St Louis---actually in Illinois. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ll be at the Four Points by Sheraton in Fairview Heights, IL. You can  <br/>
check out the hotel at    _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html_">http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html)">http://www.starwoodhotels.com/fourpoints/index.html)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
The Central Reservation number is 1-800-325-3535.  <br/>
If you&#39;d like  to call the hotel directly: 1-618-622-9500. <br/>
 <br/>
Be sure to mention the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference in Fairview  <br/>
Heights, IL to get our low, low conference rate of $80/night. There are a very  <br/>
few suites at $110/night.<br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re planning to come a few days early or stay late, you can get the  <br/>
conference rate extended by asking.<br/>
 <br/>
The conference will be FOUR days this year, due to popular demand!  &lt;G&gt; So <br/>
we&#39;ll be starting on THURSDAY morning instead of Friday and going  through <br/>
SUNDAY---so October 6th through the 9th, 2005.<br/>
 <br/>
I met with our web designer on yesterday to iron out the website, so that  <br/>
should be up very soon. I&#39;ll post when it&#39;s up and running.<br/>
 <br/>
Looking forward to seeing you all there! And please feel free to cross-post  <br/>
at other unschooling e-lists/sites.<br/>
