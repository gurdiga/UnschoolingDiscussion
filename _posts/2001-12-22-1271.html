&lt;&lt; A special &#39;hello&#39; to Sandra.. I&#39;m a big fan of yours.. reading your site..<br/>
listening to you on the unschoolers forum..and also your articles in Home<br/>
Education magazine.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oooh thanks!<br/>
It&#39;s nice to get feedback (other than the occasional &quot;you&#39;re mean and you <br/>
suck&quot; stuff I get sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m curious about your spiritual journey..raised<br/>
Southern Baptist..but now?? What changed for you?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gradually in a way and swiftly in a way, I examined everything I could get <br/>
near enough to look at, asked everyone who would talk what they believed and <br/>
why, and so gradually in that there was a smooth curve, but swiftly in that <br/>
there were few breaks on my part, my beliefs evolved.<br/>
<br/>
And I really do see it as an evolution.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen others go through the more or less the same series of thoughts and <br/>
&#39;tests&#39; and settlings, in more or less the same order, and come to the same <br/>
basic conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
My parents were variably Baptist and Nazarene.  My dad&#39;s parents were more <br/>
stable (Baptist) and my mom&#39;s family was moving around a lot but she <br/>
identified with Pentacostals and Baptists in the generic sort of <br/>
independent-church West-Texas-in-the-30&#39;s and 40&#39;s way.  <br/>
<br/>
When my parents were first together they weren&#39;t going to church.  My dad&#39;s <br/>
parents did; my mom&#39;s had quit when their kids were grown, I think.<br/>
<br/>
They/we tried church again when they thought I was old enough to need it, but <br/>
they didn&#39;t agree on which church, and how to act, and why it was important, <br/>
so I went with neighbors because I really liked to go.<br/>
<br/>
We moved, I wasn&#39;t in church for a while, and when I was nine started going <br/>
again, on my own (making parents drive me, and often--for years I went five <br/>
times a week, as Baptists are wont to do when they&#39;re in the choir, and <br/>
girl&#39;s auxiliary and training union and prayer meeting).  I was going to be a <br/>
missionary.  I studied hard.  I studied too hard.  I read everything they had <br/>
to read, spent my own allowance on stuff from the home office in Tennessee, an<br/>
d about the time I had topped out on available reading material, started <br/>
doing guitar mass (folk mass, in a group of four musicians, of whom I was the <br/>
lead when they all looked at me and shrugged because I had more experience <br/>
and knew more songs).  So I would go to 9:30 at the Catholic church, and down <br/>
the road for 11:00 Baptist service.<br/>
<br/>
At school we had an English teacher who was interested in eastern religion.  <br/>
She had us read philosophical stuff--Ayn Rand (gagged me philosophically, but <br/>
I liked Atlas Shrugged as a novel, and I liked Anthem), and Siddhartha.  She <br/>
taught us meditation, and stuff about Hinduism and Buddhism.  I had already <br/>
bought a series on comparative religion with my own money (crummy series--I <br/>
wish we had had some of the kids&#39; books that are out now!!), and I was THERE. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Did some church-hopping with two Catholic friends who were just curious.  <br/>
We&#39;d make a list, and go to services in town on Sundays.  Jerry Lopez and <br/>
Rudy Roybal.  Someone asked me about their whereabouts last month; I had not <br/>
a clue.  They were a year older than I was.  We never even used to go to <br/>
lunch afterward.  Couldn&#39;t afford it, I guess, but we&#39;d take turns driving <br/>
each other to some other church, like a team of archeologists.<br/>
<br/>
I did some more of that in college.  Just curious to the bone about what the <br/>
differences and similarities were.<br/>
<br/>
It was the early 70&#39;s and there were constant meetings of new (to us) <br/>
groups--Moonies, Baha&#39;i, 3H0 (American Sikhs)--I went to lots of those kinds <br/>
of intro sessions and series of lectures and got their literature.  I <br/>
listened to on-campus evangelists.<br/>
<br/>
Still I identified myself as Baptist, and felt saved and all.  Gradually, as <br/>
I read more and prodded people to see what their point of false-smile was and <br/>
where they really were intolerant, I came to be embarrassed to be Baptist.  <br/>
Too much willful ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the stats on members and attendance were important at my hometown <br/>
church, I tried to get them to undo my membership.  They had no way to do <br/>
that.  They could transfer it to another church, but they had never had <br/>
anyone just ask them to remove them from the rolls.  <br/>
<br/>
Went to college.  Went to Catholic mass at the Neumann center fairly often <br/>
because it was walking distance.  Went to Lutheran and really like <br/>
Presbyterian.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Went with&quot; (3.5 year relationship) a Hindu, Devender Singh, from India (by <br/>
way of New Jersey, where he went to high school) through college.  He, too, <br/>
was interested in all religious matters, and was into church-hopping <br/>
sometimes.  He could answer all kinds of questions about Hinduism, and told <br/>
me about Jains, and Sikhs, and used to go with me to intro meetings of <br/>
various groups.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still and always I was curious about other people&#39;s lives, and in the idea of <br/>
&quot;religious experiences&quot; themselves.  Studied psychology (minored in school) <br/>
and folklore (second minor in anthropology), always with an eye to learning <br/>
and religion--how fairy tales were used to tap into the subconscious and what <br/>
characters people identified with, and what was scary or soothing or instruct<br/>
ional in mythology.  <br/>
<br/>
While I was teaching and in my first marriage, I didn&#39;t go to church at all.  <br/>
Spent most weekends reading students&#39; writings (teaching composition.)  Got <br/>
involved in the SCA which took lots of weekend time.<br/>
<br/>
Got involved in Adult Children of Alcoholics, which was the most <br/>
religious/spiritual thing I had done for a long time.  (And it&#39;s not, but <br/>
compared to what I had been doing it was.)<br/>
<br/>
La Leche League was the most physical of any &quot;study&quot; I had done to that <br/>
point, as it involved not ideas and feelings so much as attending to another <br/>
person&#39;s physical needs. And the definition of physical needs <br/>
formed/overlapped a range of things that tied in with learning and <br/>
spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
So where I had always been, there I still was--surrounded with questions and <br/>
ideas about which parts of us are &quot;for learning&quot; or &quot;for spirituality&quot; or <br/>
&quot;natural&quot; or &quot;common to all humans.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And where I was, here I am.<br/>
<br/>
Ask me more if you want.  I don&#39;t mind.<br/>
