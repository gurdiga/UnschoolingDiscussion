Ginny<br/>
Dust if you must <br/>
<br/>
Dust if you must, but wouldn&#39;t it be better, <br/>
<br/>
To paint a picture or write a letter, <br/>
<br/>
Bake a cake or plant a seed, <br/>
<br/>
Ponder the difference between want and need? <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Dust if you must, but there&#39;s not much time, <br/>
<br/>
With rivers to swim and mountains to climb, <br/>
<br/>
Music to hear and books to read, <br/>
<br/>
Friends to cherish and life to lead. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Dust if you must, but the world&#39;s out there <br/>
<br/>
With the sun in your eyes, the wind in your hair, <br/>
<br/>
A flutter of snow, a shower of rain. <br/>
<br/>
This day will not come around again. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Dust if you must, but bear in mind, <br/>
<br/>
Old age will come and it&#39;s not kind. <br/>
<br/>
And when you go and go you must, <br/>
<br/>
You, yourself, will make more dust. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
A house becomes a home when you can write &quot;I love you&quot; on the furniture. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
