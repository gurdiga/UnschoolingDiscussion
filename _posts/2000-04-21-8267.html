&lt;&lt; My family is currently researching the un-schooling approach (and we are <br/>
pleased so far) and I wanted to come out of lurkdom and ask if their was <br/>
anyone by chance on this list that is a part-time aerobics instructor and <br/>
homeschools as well???    I&#39;m finding that this is one thing that I cannot do <br/>
with my children (13 & 7) there, even though it is an hour a day, twice a <br/>
week that I teach, I find it hard to have the time to prepare for my classes. <br/>
 I&#39;m beginning to think that I cannot have my own interests out of the house <br/>
and homeschool at the same time.....anyone been through something similar?  I <br/>
must make my priorities straight, I know... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We unschool, and I&#39;ve been teaching aerobics part-time for 6 years <br/>
(currently, I&#39;m taking a break because of my voice).  What, exactly, are you <br/>
having difficulty with?  I find that when I&#39;m working on a new routine, I do <br/>
have to work on it in the evening, when dh is home, or get someone to take <br/>
care of the kids while I go to the gym to work on it (or, before the baby, <br/>
tell the kids *not to bother me* for an hour while I work).  I&#39;ve been <br/>
teaching at 3 different places - once a week at each place - so, even if I <br/>
keep the same routine for awhile, the participants don&#39;t get *too* tired of <br/>
it since each class only gets it once a week.  Lately, I just don&#39;t have as <br/>
much creativity to come up with a lot of new stuff, either, but I have a 15 <br/>
mo (along with an 8 yo and a 12 yo) so my energies are spread rather thin &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always found it important, though, to keep my own outside interests, <br/>
otherwise I focus *too* closely on what my kids are doing.  I can be more <br/>
relaxed (and &quot;go with the flow&quot; more) when I have another focus.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475992277"><p>Hi Laura!</p>
<p>Thanks so much for responding and are your vocal cords injured because of teaching? Anyhow, I am having difficulty with just what you wrote:&nbsp; making the time to create new choreography.&nbsp; I teach 2 times a week and I&#39;m constantly changing my routine every week.&nbsp; Not the whole thing, but about 2 combos.&nbsp; I teach a step class and a class we call &quot;Cardio Smorgasbord&quot;, which is a little bit of everything, Latin, Step, Hi-Low, Military Drills and kickboxing.&nbsp; Soon I&#39;ll be certified to teach BodyPUMP, and I cannot wait because the routines will already be pre-choreographed and I don&#39;t have to find the time (except for learning it initially) to make up new choreography.&nbsp; I find that I&#39;ve spent up to 4 hours searching for choreog. on the net (turnstep.com &amp; vitasvibe.com) and practicing what I&#39;ve found.&nbsp; I am the type A personality that if I want to do it, I dive head over heals into it and nothing else around me exists.&nbsp; So, I&#39;ve felt guilty that my kids only have my extra attention for short amounts of time during the days I teach because I&#39;m trying like heck to put my routines together.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mind you, we&#39;ve only been doing the &quot;relaxed&quot; unschooling approach for a little under a year.&nbsp; When I see my kids not plunging into&nbsp;work-books or the like, I STILL get all stressed!!&nbsp; I think I have to be&nbsp;constantly with&nbsp;my kids 24 hours a day or I&#39;m not doing the homeschooling right.&nbsp; My 14 year old daughter takes care of my 7 year old son while I&#39;m gone teaching, which is great for me, I can get a break away from my little home.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;also workout at home to videotapes or with the gym in my garage to cross-train.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only been teaching since January and I was fine with my homeschooling then, it was about the same I have it now, but my kids a little busier with music, karate &amp; tennis lessons.&nbsp; Where is the balance?&nbsp; Do I sound stressed or what?&nbsp; My hubby is a great help by spending time with them during the evenings, but it&#39;s so hard to practice at night because of all the places they have to go for lessons and activities.&nbsp; The only time I have is during the day, but isn&#39;t that the time I&#39;m supposed to have free for my kids?&nbsp; Early mornings are out because we do breakfast and chores.&nbsp; Does it sound like I need to take a break too like you are?</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, I hope I made sense&nbsp; :o)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Myra</p>

&lt;&lt; Thanks so much for responding and are your vocal cords injured because of <br/>
teaching? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it&#39;s taken me awhile to respond.  We&#39;re running around like crazy <br/>
getting ready for my daughter&#39;s First Communion next week, with a party <br/>
afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
The club that I used to teach for didn&#39;t have a very good microphone, and <br/>
every time it broke we would end up having to shout.  I&#39;m not very loud, and <br/>
I injured my voice.  For awhile, I&#39;d lose my voice every time I had a cold <br/>
and sore throat.  Now that I&#39;m not teaching, I&#39;ve actually had a few colds <br/>
and not lost my voice.  I&#39;m not sure at this point whether I&#39;m going to go <br/>
back to teaching or not (certainly not at *that* club!).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fairly type A, and I find that that&#39;s a temptation for me too.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does it sound like I need to take a break too like you are?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily, but you may want to relax your standards a bit  - something <br/>
I&#39;ve been struggling with lately.  What with having a baby last year and <br/>
homeschooling, I&#39;ve not been able to change my routine as often as I&#39;d like.  <br/>
But, until my voice got really bad, it was still important to me to teach, <br/>
even though I wasn&#39;t able to do as much with it as I wanted to at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I find that I&#39;ve spent up to 4 hours searching for choreog. on the net <br/>
(turnstep.com & vitasvibe.com) and practicing what I&#39;ve found.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I knew about turnstep, but I hadn&#39;t heard of the other one.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
I also find that taking other instructors classes helps me come up with new <br/>
moves.  Not that I&#39;m necessarily using their moves, but it seems to put me in <br/>
a good frame of mind to come up with new ones of my own. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My hubby is a great help by spending time with them during the evenings, <br/>
but it&#39;s so hard to practice at night because of all the places they have to <br/>
go for lessons and activities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you bring a tape recorder and headphones and mentally run through your <br/>
routine while you&#39;re waiting for them at lessons?  I actually came up with a <br/>
new routine once while I was waiting in the jury pool for jury duty.  I <br/>
brought a notebook, and my headphones and went through my tape and wrote down <br/>
a new routine while sitting there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I am the type A personality that if I want to do it, I dive head over <br/>
heals into it and nothing else around me exists.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very much this way too.  Not that, with a toddler, I get much time to do <br/>
things this way.<br/>
<br/>
I once went to a talk that Madeleine L&#39;Engle gave at Duke University.  I was <br/>
in graduate school part-time at that point, and I had a 2 yo.  There was a <br/>
question and answer period at the end, and I asked her how she was able to <br/>
change focus from her intense mental world in her writing to focusing on her <br/>
children and their needs (I was having difficulties at this point!).  Her <br/>
response was that the children are young for such a short time - not that she <br/>
stopped writing altogether, but that it wasn&#39;t possible for it to be as <br/>
central as it could be at other times (she wrote at night, and often fell <br/>
asleep over the typewriter!).  <br/>
<br/>
I think it sometimes takes awhile to find a balance, though - especially when <br/>
starting something new like homeschooling.<br/>
