Hello Mary,<br/>
<br/>
For me to print a diploma would not be enough for him.  If the collage would not except it, the CJ would not want it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input!<br/>

I just can&#39;t imagine it.<br/>
If you want someone ELSE to write out the diploma, get in touch with Wes <br/>
Beach of Beach High School.  He&#39;s online I think and he &#39;helps&#39; kids <br/>
graduate, homeschooling.<br/>

But I know people who made up their own school, printed a diploma out and <br/>
that&#39;s where the child said they graduated from. It would be a non acredited <br/>
private school. A college doesn&#39;t ask to see the diploma, at least none that <br/>
I know of. Then along with where the child graduated from they would want <br/>
what their requirements would be. SAT or whatever.<br/>

CJ is home against his will, then? Well, that&#39;s not what I wanted to comment <br/>
on anyway. CJ would likely benefit greatly from researching exactly what the <br/>
colleges he is interested in will want from him, rather than speculating and <br/>
complaing he won&#39;t learn anything or have the proper tickets. :) He can start <br/>
with From Homeschool to College and Work by Allison McKee and College <br/>
Admissions for Homeschoolers by Cafi Cohen. If those aren&#39;t enough to get him <br/>
off and running on his own research...<br/>

<br/>
Cafi Cohen has a website, too, and so does Karl Bunday, who has been keeping <br/>
a list of colleges which have accepted homeschoolers (not specifically <br/>
unschoolers, just all kinds of homeschoolers).  You could find them by going <br/>
to www.google.com and putting in the name from above (both odd names, I know, <br/>
but I spelled them correctly above) and the word college.<br/>
