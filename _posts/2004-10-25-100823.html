&lt;&lt; For those who haven&#39;t had the chance to teach (or don&#39;t &quot;sleep with the <br/>
<br/>
enemy&quot; &lt;g&gt; like I do), another way to really vividly see what Sandra <br/>
<br/>
describes is to borrow the keen eyes of John Holt and read &quot;How Children <br/>
<br/>
Fail&quot;.  (His other books are good, too.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That paragraph is really artsy.  <br/>
It&#39;s beautiful.<br/>
Aside from it agreeing with me--that&#39;s now what I&#39;m commenting on. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;. . .to borrow the keen eyes...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
That and what built up to it,  really sweet.<br/>
