<div id="ygrps-yiv-483353390"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; If there&#39;s a way I find unschooling imperfect, it&#39;s related to walking<br/>

out of step, it&#39;s still annoying sometime.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase Kermit, it&#39;s not easy being different. But it&#39;s better. I have<br/>
felt isolated and misunderstood but I think most people do at some point in<br/>
their lives. I feel it less now than ever though. I guess because my<br/>
relationship with my husband is so good now and the kids and I are becoming<br/>
good friends. It&#39;s hard to feel lonely when you get to hang out with your<br/>
best friends all the time!<br/>

  Oh, Julie,<br/>
  This is so sweet and true for us also.   When people say they can&#39;t be with their children as much as I am,  I am now feeling that I wouldn&#39;t know what to do without them!   Its a great thing.<br/>
