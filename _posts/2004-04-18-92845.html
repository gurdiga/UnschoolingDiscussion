<br/>
In terms of the criteria to which i was responding, which was &quot;usefulness,&quot; <br/>
and in the context of unschooling, yes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But then I furnished documentation of my longheld belief that happiness does <br/>
NOT come from &#39;being useful,&#39; but from finding joy.<br/>

would justify saying that my own children&#39;s lives are worth more than the <br/>
lives of most other people&#39;s children. <br/>
<br/>
       And even supposing that it could, and did, I doubt there&#39;s usefulness <br/>
OR joy in widely pronouncing this belief to mothers whose own children <br/>
therefore must be leading those lesser lives. So it makes little sense to me in any <br/>
context. Sorry.  JJ<br/>

----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Well it doesn&#39;t transfer to any context.<br/>
It was particular to the criteria presented as to what earned one the right <br/>
to happiness.<br/>
(With which I disagreed.)<br/>
