half-nelson-like grip and take her down like he&#39;s in a rodeo! &gt;&gt;<br/>

When I was a kid my dog was a grown, older long-haired shepherd mix of a sort <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen outside of New Mexico.   I liked her, but she didn&#39;t wrestle.<br/>
<br/>
Our next door neighbors got a boxerish mutt named Brandy, and Brandy and I <br/>
would wrestle to a pin when I was ten or eleven.  He was GREAT!  He was strong <br/>
and would play rough, but we were both careful not to hurt the other one.  He <br/>
would pin me, his feet on my limbs and his breath in my face, or I would pin <br/>
him shoulder down and let him up and go again.  We were evenly matched there for <br/>
a while, and he needed more play (and I guess I did too), so we were good for <br/>
each other.<br/>
