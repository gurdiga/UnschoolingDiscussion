<div id="ygrps-yiv-265038221">If you&#39;ll recall, Paul has been saying we need to do more academics. We were talking about it tonight as Sarah was looking at some new workbooks at Kmart. Sarah came up with the idea of having a &quot;Portfolio&quot; time once a week where we do workbooks or whatever specifically in order to build her portfolio. We talked about what it might include in addition to just workbooks, etc. and I think this might work out well for us. <br/>
