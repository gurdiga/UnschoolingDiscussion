==I&#39;ve had to shift this to non-toy items, too. My kid used to LOVE to pull<br/>
every Kleenex out of the box (this was big at about 18 mos.). It felt so<br/>
wasteful to me. And then I thought, &quot;If this were a CRAFT project, that cost<br/>
99 cents and got this much joy and mileage, I would be THRILLED.&quot; So, we go<br/>
through a lot of toiletries and Dawn dish soap for making bubbles. It&#39;s not<br/>
waste, it *is* value!==<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I *finally* got this about transparent tape.  My kids love the stuff and I<br/>
used to cringe and suggest they save some for another potential craft<br/>
project or whatever.  But since I&#39;ve been reading this list, I&#39;ve been<br/>
questioning all my &quot;no&#39;s &quot; and becoming more aware of the way I try to<br/>
control things, so I questioned why it was so bad for them to use up the<br/>
tape and came to the conclusion that it&#39;s not.  The dollar store sells it<br/>
cheap, and they are endlessly entertained--Spent 5 bucks, give them 4 rolls,<br/>
put aside one for myself and have one less thing to monitor/worry about!.<br/>

===============<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this is so it! Good for you, Andrea!<br/>
<br/>
Jennefer--this is exactly how unschooling happens. More, more, more <br/>
moments like this and before you know it, you&#39;re unschooling like all <br/>
these experienced folks with older kids. At least, that&#39;s how I think it <br/>
happens. ;)  Focus on more moments like this in your home. When you say <br/>
&quot;no,&quot; ask yourself &quot;why no?&quot; No&#39;s are a very vague thing that tend to be <br/>
much more about the parent than the child. Instead of saying no, try to <br/>
identify *specifically* what *you&#39;re* concern is. For example, instead <br/>
of saying &quot;no,&quot; say &quot;I&#39;m concerned that x might happen.&quot; Then your child <br/>
has specific information to make a decision.<br/>
<br/>
This applies even with little children and something as basic as <br/>
crossing a street or parking lot safely. My youngest *never* wanted to <br/>
hold my hand. I&#39;ve had to revamp, become very creative and minimize <br/>
controls with him in ways I never had to worry about with my first two. <br/>
With Sam, I would tell him that my biggest job was to keep him safe and <br/>
holding his hand let me know he was safe, but if he could let me know he <br/>
was safe in another way that would be okay, too. He has been walking by <br/>
my side within grabbing distance and eye shot for at least 2 years--he&#39;s <br/>
4 now.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about that through the whole back and forth over age <br/>
appropriateness. My kids have always seemed quite capable even at the <br/>
age of 2. In fact, it always surprises me when I look back at pictures <br/>
and think, my goodness they look like such babies, because I never <br/>
remember thinking of them that way. They were always people to <br/>
me--people who needed my help to enable them to problem solve in a big <br/>
world. Most of the stuff they couldn&#39;t do or couldn&#39;t get I always <br/>
figured was because the world wasn&#39;t the right size, not that they <br/>
weren&#39;t old enough. I can remember imagining what it would be like if I <br/>
walked around in a world where everything was at least two times too big <br/>
for me, too high, too heavy. Kind of like Jack in the Giant&#39;s world, you <br/>
know?  Probably, for me, it was reading Montessori, but I can remember <br/>
back in college when I worked in the World Bank Daycare Center, and my <br/>
favorite room to work in was the 2&#39;s because they were so incredibly <br/>
amazing (and with much less attitude than the 5s and 6s!). With the 2s <br/>
you could show them something one time and they picked it up; it was <br/>
just new to them. Kind of like having a visitor from another country: <br/>
I&#39;m just the ambassador and facilitator--they&#39;re not stupid or <br/>
incapable. I&#39;m not saying anyone here thinks young kids are stupid or <br/>
incapable, but there are lots of folks out in the world who seem to <br/>
treat them that way and make money by perpetuating that idea.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL Me too! It is really hard to get out of that mind-set of &quot;wastefullness&quot;. <br/>
My mother is REALLY big on that... I try to compromise with myself by going <br/>
to all the sales this time of year and getting bunches of everything we&#39;ll <br/>
probably need for the next year at the super-low sales prices. We got 6 rolls of <br/>
transparent tape (800 yards each!!) for 29 cents a roll (one for me, the rest <br/>
for him), spiral bound notebooks of 70 sheet lined paper for 19 cents each (5 <br/>
for each of us), pocket folders for ... I think 7 cents each-THAT was a big <br/>
one, this year, since Wyl draws so much and writes some, and we just don&#39;t have <br/>
enough space to hang everything (since he never wants to take any of the old <br/>
down), so we now have pocket folders to make &quot;art portfolios&quot; out of-a pack of <br/>
10 pencils for 39 cents, and a couple packages of Crayola 24 pack crayons for <br/>
39 cents each. So, I feel much more relaxed about the constant usage of <br/>
everything, and he gets to feel free with his creativity. We also have an endless (?) <br/>
supply of paper, since my mom gets scrap printer paper from her work and we <br/>
also have a huge roll of blank newsprint paper that we can get refilled for <br/>
free whenever its empty-we just take it to our local newspaper, and they fill it <br/>
up again! He&#39;s big into skeletons and bats, lately-and getting pretty good <br/>
with scrap paper, celophane tape and crayons!!<br/>
<br/>

starving children in africa talk a lot when I was small, and then she <br/>
switched to the that is what is making you fat talks by the time I <br/>
was 12 or 13 and would really try to limit my food. I used to dig for <br/>
change in the car and the couch so I could get &quot;junk&quot; at school. <br/>
I was 5 ft 6 inches and weigh less than 120 pounds by the time I was <br/>
14. I had a helluva time finding bras, since I was a 32 DD. You had <br/>
to special order those. I have some major food and wastefulness <br/>
issues, and I&#39;m really trying not to pass them on to my kids. But <br/>
it&#39;s really, really hard to stop those tendencies when they were <br/>
drummed into you from a very early age.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep, yep! Right with you, there! My dad also had a saying, &quot;You don&#39;t get the <br/>
delicious if you don&#39;t eat the nutritious&quot;-which seemed rediculous to me as a <br/>
kid at the time-what was the point of overstuffing yourself with dinner just <br/>
so you could get that reward of the sweet at the end? But my opinions as a <br/>
child were not valid, and I knew it, so I kept my opinion to myself and stuffed <br/>
away. My max weight as a 5&#39; 11&quot; adult was 335lbs. It took my husband telling me <br/>
for YEARS that I didn&#39;t have to finish something (ESPECIALLY at a <br/>
restaruant-where I&#39;d paid &quot;good money&quot; for the food on my plate) for me to really get it. <br/>
I&#39;ve also realised as an adult that my parents&#39; attitude also put far more <br/>
value on the &quot;sweet&quot; than it should-and I still haven&#39;t gotten over that, yet.<br/>
I find it really easy to avoid the &quot;starving children&quot; aspect with Wyl. Its <br/>
almost a rebellion thing-I get a HUGE thrill out of saying, &quot;You&#39;re done with <br/>
your meal-you just don&#39;t want any more? Well, that&#39;s fine. Yes, you can have <br/>
some cookies.&quot; My parents looked stunned at me, exchange &quot;the look&quot; with each <br/>
other, and get that whole attitude that I&#39;m ruining a perfectly good boy. And <br/>
I&#39;m smug in my assurance that I&#39;m helping him to learn how to make his own <br/>
choices and be a great man, someday! :~) He will often walk away from the table for <br/>
20 minutes or so, anyway, and be hungry again, and come back and eat the rest <br/>
of his meal-no questions asked, no begging for more cookies. He&#39;s hungry and <br/>
the food was good, so he eats it. I&#39;m afraid, though, that I do pass along <br/>
some of that &quot;extra value&quot; on the sweets to him, though.... Hopefully, as I come <br/>
to terms with this, my input will lessen, and since he most likely won&#39;t have <br/>
the food issues I did/do (cleaning the plate or be selfish and wasteful), <br/>
maybe the sweet won&#39;t hold as high a value for him-and maybe he&#39;ll be able to get <br/>
through it easier. We can work on it and hope. Very hard, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Had to chuckle lol at this - we&#39;ve been playing word games with DS <br/>
lately. We were in VoldeMart (lol) and the sign said &quot;Invisible <br/>
tape&quot; and lo and behold it was all gone. I asked DS if he wanted <br/>
some Invisible tape and handed him an invisible roll of tape. We&#39;ve <br/>
gotten a lot of mileage from playing with that one (he realizes that <br/>
it is called that because it &quot;camouflages&quot; itself onto whatever you <br/>
put it on.<br/>
<br/>
Wish I knew how to post a picture here - I&#39;ve got a shot of DS at <br/>
about 3 1/2 happily winding the whole house in a ball of red yarn <br/>
right after we moved in - the stair railings, door knobs, furniture, <br/>
around the hallway, etc. (the kitchen/dining room, hallway, living <br/>
room form a circle to go round and round from hallway to kitchen to <br/>
livingroom to hallway).</div>

That&#39;s a party game we do at every birthday.  We call it spider web and wrap<br/>
yarn all over the house like a big spider web with a gift tied at the end of<br/>
each string. (one for each kid)  The kids start at the beginning of their<br/>
string and work their way to the end and to the gift.  Everyone always seems<br/>
to enjoy it and everyone gets a prize.  The prizes are always hidden at the<br/>
end of the string in a drawer or something.<br/>
