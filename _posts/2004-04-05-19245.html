<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423625020">Hi folks!<br/>
I wanted to let people know that the Whale Watch for the conference right now <br/>
is almost full. The company may be able to run a second boat (right now it&#39;s <br/>
tentatively booked, but she thinks that might not happen), but we won&#39;t know <br/>
for a bit. <br/>
<br/>
So, starting right now, I will be keeping a waiting list for Whale Watch <br/>
tickets. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, we already have over 50 families from all over the US and a few <br/>
from Canada registered!<br/>
