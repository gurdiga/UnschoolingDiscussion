<div id="ygrps-yiv-154686695"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the key here is:<br/>
&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; I never liked to clean&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;*~*Elissa Jill*~*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree. I am a big ol&#39; slob and my organized engineer husband is<br/>
the &quot;uptight&quot; one.. I don&#39;t mind a bit of clutter and dust, which used to<br/>
drive my mother into conniptions. I would rather have it clean, sure, but<br/>
not if I&#39;m the one who has to do it. Clearly, if it were a priority to me,<br/>
I&#39;d get off my butt and clean &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 I try to stay on top of the dishes and laundry, the rest can go to Hades<br/>
most days.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d be different if my mother hadn&#39;t always been nagging at<br/>
me to clean my room or help around the house. At age 35, I choose not to<br/>
blame it on her. It&#39;s my responsibility at this point.  I wish Dh would do<br/>
more, but after being married to him for nearly 13 years I have gotten<br/>
better about not<br/>
nagging him, since if simply I request once and then shut up about it, he&#39;s<br/>
more likely to do it.<br/>
Ds is going to be 3 next week, so it&#39;s early yet, but I think he&#39;s like his<br/>
Dad and will tend to dig in his heels under pressure.<br/>
