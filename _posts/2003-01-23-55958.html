<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284459908"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My daughter, who&#39;s 4, always wants to wear summer clothes.  I don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; problem with that when we&#39;re in the house, although others do.  I tell them<br/>
&gt; if she&#39;s cold she&#39;ll put more clothes on.  However, it&#39;s hard for me to let<br/>
&gt; it go when we have to go outside.  She doesn&#39;t want to take extra clothes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you put some warmer clothes into a bag and carry them yourself? Then if<br/>
she wants them, they&#39;re right there, and nobody has to go back inside,<br/>
especially if they&#39;re big enough to go on over what she has.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess I don&#39;t know to what extent do we bend over backwards to let our kids<br/>
&gt; do whatever they want, without making our lives so difficult.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To the same extent I&#39;d try to help anyone I loved do whatever they wanted,<br/>
even if it was sometimes difficult. I do try to find things that work as<br/>
smoothly as possible, and that does involve some really creative thinking<br/>
sometimes. Many of the handy ideas I put into use every day came right from<br/>
this list :) and others like it.<br/>
