All I can say is that most of the people didn&#39;t leave the room. Whether they <br/>
agreed with the presenter or not, I can not say. <br/>

&lt;&lt;   The <br/>
 Bible DOES say if you spare the rod, you spoil the child &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could you please quote me the verse that says &quot;spare the rod spoil the child&quot;?<br/>
It does not exist.<br/>
There is talk of a rod and using it as guidance.<br/>
Like you, I never saw it as something you were supposed to hit with. I <br/>
picture a sheperd using it to keep the sheep from dangerous cliffs and the <br/>
like.<br/>
Not something he hit them with when they didn&#39;t do what he wanted.<br/>
But I don&#39;t use the Bible as my sole guide to life. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all <br/>
accurate, I think there is major human dabbling and alterations.<br/>
All in all it is a wonderful piece of history, and I have gained many <br/>
wonderful spiritual lessons and been uplifted.<br/>
But I like to think that God gave me a brain and the powers of reasoning to <br/>
use them, even where the Bible is concerned. After all, I don&#39;t think he <br/>
wrote it!! :)<br/>

<br/>
BUT.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible does say, &quot;Do not withold discipline from a child; if you <br/>
punish him with the rod, he will not die.  Punish him with the rod <br/>
and save his soul from death.&quot;  (Proverbs 23:13-14 - NIV)The rod <br/>
is definitely indicated as a tool for punishment int his verse.  Not <br/>
that I support this, just that the Bible does indicate that the rod is <br/>
to be used for punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while &quot;Save the rod and spoil the child&quot; is not in the Bible, <br/>
Proverbs 13:24 does say that &quot;He who saves the rod hates his <br/>
son.&quot;  Not a far cry different.<br/>
