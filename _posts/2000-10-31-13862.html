I am *just a little further* ahead of where you are with <br/>
unschooling.  After removing my then 11yr old from school we did <br/>
school at home and moved onto unschooling because it didnt work.<br/>
For 4 months my dd has been deschooling - I waited and waited and <br/>
waited for something to happen....becoming more and more desperate. <br/>
Suggesting things - starting things - but all she wanted to do was <br/>
watch TV.  I bought a mathwork book. (This is the only structured <br/>
thing I insisted she do)......and waited.<br/>
Toni is a night owl and a late riser. I am the opposite and I found <br/>
this hard to handle - but I allowed her body clock to take over.  I <br/>
learned not to nag.  I also learned that Toni is at her best late <br/>
afternoon and early evening - I also found that she works better with <br/>
noise.......<br/>
Toni did 5 pages of math yesterday while watching TV and got most of <br/>
them right!! This is happening more and more.  She has several e-pals <br/>
who she now correspondces with several times a week - before i used <br/>
to TELL her to answere these emails and she would leave them - Now <br/>
that i leave her to her own device as far as *school* goes, we get <br/>
much more done.<br/>
So dont give up.  These lovely people on these message boards kept <br/>
telling me it *would happen* - I didnt believe them!!!!  But honestly <br/>
*It will happen* just be patient..<br/>

Im so glad your daughter came around, it gives me somthing to look forward <br/>
to. I was so confident when I began this I guess  I didnt figure in all the <br/>
little obstacles. Like......LIFE!! Heheehe My mother told me a million times <br/>
that if I would just pay attention I would be alright, didnt listen to mom.<br/>
That was a lesson learned in real life......&quot;Look before you leap!!&quot; <br/>
My daughter is also a night owl, not sure if its her clock or mine but I have <br/>
no complaints about it.<br/>
