I think you and he should plan a movie marathon.  A movie or two a day, <br/>
together, with anyone else who wants to join.  I think if you watch a diverse <br/>
enough set of movies (one can just lead to another, or you could follow <br/>
certain actors, or themes, and change it whenever you want to) that you will <br/>
touch on almost every subject and have opportunities for discussions which <br/>
will help him and you know how much he knows, and how analytical he can be.  <br/>
Don&#39;t make it schooly at all, just make it be like an extended vacation <br/>
project.  But it will involve <br/>
literature/plot/character/geography/history/human development and motivation, <br/>
and all kinds of other &quot;real&quot; stuff.<br/>

<br/>
is that what you would recommend for any child who is healing from the school experience?  what a great idea!  it seems particularly good for older kids.<br/>
<br/>
as a single mom of a 10 year old who will not be going back to school, it has been an interesting process to determine just how much my son does know and is interested in.  it is amazing and wonderful how much i have really learned about him just because he is home and with me.  even just a few great moments here and there thruout the day are incredibly rich, compared to before, when our time together was spent helping him get  ready to go to school or to do stupid and meaningless homework assignments.<br/>
<br/>
it has also been painful, as i realize how much time with him i have lost to him being gone in school.<br/>
<br/>
i am blessed with his presence, and i am so thankful for the support and wisdom of the people on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-389415336">He needs time to find out who he is.  You might encourage him to volunteer <br/>
for Volunteers for America or another program that will help him discover <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
 I found myself that when I was getting back into college, community <br/>
college was fantastic.  Usually the teachers there live in &quot;the real world&quot; <br/>
and work in the field they teach.<br/>
<br/>
 Also, if he&#39;s interested in music, sound recording is a very good field to <br/>
get into in California.  I would encourage him to get to know himself and <br/>
have fun.  You might want to employ the services of a professional ADD <br/>
coach, who can get him goal oriented without nagging because the ADD coach <br/>
would be an objective outsider who is on your son&#39;s &quot;side&quot;.  You are too of <br/>
course, but kids don&#39;t always see it that way.<br/>

Urgh!  I would find that infuriating, and it would probably make me want<br/>
to roll in scummy gutters or join a lethargic cult just to defy them! <br/>
(I&#39;m not very mature, despite my advanced age.)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in N. Calif., you all could see a lot of teenagers who don&#39;t<br/>
go to school, and their families, at the HSC conference in Sacramento,<br/>
around August 16th.  (I&#39;m not very mature, AND I have a terrible memory<br/>
for dates.)  This is usualy a big confidence boost for me.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
if it would work for you.<br/>

There should be something to click on in the upper right hand corner.<br/>
<br/>
More and more people don&#39;t go to school and are THRILLED about it.<br/>
<br/>
A friend, a nice one, honestly, asked me if I would let my son (8) go to<br/>
school later, if he wants to.  He and I just looked at her like she was<br/>
slightly insane.  We  really can&#39;t imagine WANTING to go to school.<br/>

OK, enough ranting.  I hope your son has a nice life, doing what he wants.<br/>

Go with your gut, Leslie!! Your son sounds like he really needs some time to <br/>
deschool, even though he&#39;s technically beyond &quot;school age&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew went through a very similar experience. He had a horrible school <br/>
experience and was finally able to drop out of high school at 16. He spent a <br/>
couple of years just decompressing and finding himself. He&#39;s 19 now and is <br/>
thankfully emerging as his true self again. He&#39;s writing, reading <br/>
voraciously, creating art and music, and figuring out for himself what path <br/>
he would like to take as far as his working life goes. His mom and family <br/>
have been his support through this process and the results for him have been <br/>
priceless.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about being &quot;too protective&quot;. It&#39;s about supporting one another. <br/>
Your son is lucky to have you in his corner.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
