<div id="ygrps-yiv-194406313">******&quot;But, what about socialization?!&quot;************<br/>
<br/>
I have started to ask &quot;What does &#39;socialization&#39; mean to you?&quot; or even simply &quot;What do you mean?&quot; or even cocking your head to the side, raising your eyebrow(s) and going &quot;huh???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
try it... it&#39;s fun... the looks you get... &lt;BEG&gt;  then the stuttering &lt;ROFL&gt; and stammering or downright anger &lt;ROFPIMP&gt;  *sigh* some people&#39;s kids...<br/>
