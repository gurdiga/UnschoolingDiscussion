And, whatever inconveniences that <br/>
may cause me are totally outweighed by his obvious joy at getting to <br/>
snuggle with me.  He is so happy and joyful, and it is the simplest thing <br/>
to do.  I feel so grateful that I can do that little thing for him and see <br/>
him be so happy!  It has always been that way, and I know that one day it <br/>
won&#39;t be.  One day, he&#39;ll probably get himself off to bed (hard to <br/>
imagine!) and he won&#39;t wiggle and squirm with joy to be next to me.  <br/>

Thank you Marji - <br/>

This is such a great reminder to me as I am in the &quot;snuggle me&quot; stage. Sometimes it does cause inconvience as I am going to college, running a home business etc. that make night time a good time to sit and work. I hate to admit this but more often than not in the last 5 weeks since school started up for me again said No to the snuggling because I had to get work done.  Boy - is that crazy or what?? It&#39;s like those Hallmark commercials where the kids keeps asking the busy parent for the book and they keep saying &quot;in a minute&quot; the minute never comes so there they are buying this Hallmark card to make up for it. <br/>
<br/>
My 8 dd and I are reading the Secret Garden together. You know how many times she has begged for &quot;just one more chapter&quot;  Most often I do indulge - but there are evenings where I am less than congenial about it. <br/>
<br/>
And this is the thing you reminded me of Marji - It will all come to an end to quickly and my teenagers won&#39;t be begging me to snuggle them and I will have the time to do this... so I have to do it now ;-)<br/>
