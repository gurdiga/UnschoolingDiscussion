Yep. I was actually born with my thumb in my mouth, or so the story goes.<br/>
My mother was stressing out when there was no crying sound right after giving <br/>
birth, and the doc was busy tying the cord, she asks what is going on and he <br/>
says &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, everything is fine, she&#39;s just sucking her thumb&quot;<br/>

&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>
