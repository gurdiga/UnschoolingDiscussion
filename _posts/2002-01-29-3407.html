&gt; Jessica.... I wrote this afternoon about<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; wonderful time I had with Zak making<br/>
&gt; chocolate covered strawberries... Then<br/>
&gt; Max got up and we were still making them.<br/>
&gt; He wanted to help.  I kept him<br/>
&gt; away from the stove and made sure it was<br/>
&gt; off and I turned away for 5 seconds<br/>
&gt; and Max (2,5 yrs) put his hand on the<br/>
&gt; burner.... Hubby walked in from work 3<br/>
&gt; mins later and we ended up at the<br/>
&gt; hospital.  He has 2nd degree burns on his<br/>
&gt; right hand, possibly 3rd,  we are taking<br/>
&gt; him to the burn unit tomorrow<br/>
&gt; morning at 7am, the first time they can see<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what does this have to do with toxic<br/>
&gt; in-laws and mothers?  I called my<br/>
&gt; mother and asked her if she would watch Zak<br/>
&gt; in the morning so that hubby and<br/>
&gt; I can go together and she&#39;d been drinking<br/>
&gt; (again)... She started saying all<br/>
&gt; kinds of strange things such as &quot;You need<br/>
&gt; to be careful THEY don&#39;t take your<br/>
&gt; children away&quot;... &quot;Whose they?&quot; was my<br/>
&gt; response.... She started going on<br/>
&gt; about CPS, Welfare, they were only<br/>
&gt; intersted in the kids and could think I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; burned him deliberately.... Of course this<br/>
&gt; was just the joyful news I needed<br/>
&gt; to hear when I was already having a hard<br/>
&gt; time with the fact that he was with<br/>
&gt; me when he got burned.  She even asked me<br/>
&gt; &quot;where were you&quot;.... I didn&#39;t need<br/>
&gt; to justify myself but out of habit did (I<br/>
&gt; thought that one had gone by the<br/>
&gt; wayside)... I turned to put a plate in the<br/>
&gt; sink and in 5 seconds his hand<br/>
&gt; was on the stove...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My parents not only don&#39;t support<br/>
&gt; homeschooling, they have no clue was<br/>
&gt; unschooling is and don&#39;t want to learn<br/>
&gt; anything, read anything or know<br/>
&gt; anything about it.  They are unsupportive<br/>
&gt; in the decisions we make for our<br/>
&gt; children.  I guess I&#39;d just been sucked in<br/>
&gt; lately to my mother being nice.<br/>
&gt; I forget she&#39;s like the Black Widow Spider<br/>
&gt; who will do anything to get you<br/>
&gt; into her net and then strike.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you can imagine I&#39;m feeling a bit<br/>
&gt; overwhelmed tonight and your thoughts<br/>
&gt; and prayers for a swift recovery of my<br/>
&gt; adorable Max would be appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dawn<br/>
&gt; btw, we&#39;re in the same boat with the toxic<br/>
&gt; inlaws, too. in fact, their<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; extremely negative (verbal, in front of our<br/>
&gt; child) response to our choice to<br/>
&gt; opt<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; for &quot;this homeschooling bulls**t&quot; (the last<br/>
&gt; in a string of negative<br/>
&gt; responses to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; just about every parenting choice we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; made) has caused us to pretty much<br/>
&gt; cut<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; off contact. Jessica Kelly<br/>

That&#39;s about all you can do! Remove yourself and<br/>
children from any toxic effects! Grandma or<br/>
who(what)ever!! And don&#39;t trust drunks to care for<br/>
your children, even in emeregancies. It is OK to love<br/>
the toxic %$#$#*^%!!, just don&#39;t trust them with your<br/>
children. <br/>
