&lt;&lt; Thank you :-) It was awesome meeting you too. You seem like an earth<br/>
 motherly type, radiating calm and peace :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>

She does, she does!! I got to be Marji&#39;s roommate the entire weekend, what a <br/>
privilege. I miss her so much, that calm, peaceful energy just radiates <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
