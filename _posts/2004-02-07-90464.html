<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145259579">If anyone here is unschooling their child w/DS<br/>
would you please email me off-list?<br/>
I would especially love to know how far<br/>
you have found you can go towards giving<br/>
them the reins and still have developmental progress.<br/>
Thanks <br/>
Take care,<br/>
