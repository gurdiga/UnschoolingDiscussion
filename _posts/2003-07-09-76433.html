The Oregonian, Clark County, Washington, by Holley Gilbert, July 01<br/>
Headline:  Former educator admits abusing child<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oregonlive.com/metronorth/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/metro_north_news/1057061240177681.xml">http://www.oregonlive.com/metronorth/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/metro_north_news/1057061240177681.xml</a><br/>
VANCOUVER - &quot;A former Battle Ground educator... resigned in May as <br/>
assistant principal for Character, Academics and Marketplace, the <br/>
district&#39;s alternative high school program, and Homelink, a <br/>
home-school program.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gave me a start, to say the least. Larry Peirson, the man accused of the molestation, was in charge of Homelink, my first homeschooling experience.<br/>
It was a homeschoolers &quot;school&quot; where one could sign up for 1-4 classes a week at no charge to the family (publicly funded). We took music, computer and science classes there the first two years we homeschooled. It was a great way to start for me, because we had fun and I was around loads of other homeschoolers (gave me some confidence in that early, jump-off-the-cliff stage).<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is, this man that was in charge of the school, was a very prominent Christian. Almost everyone at the school was Christian families...I wonder how they&#39;re feeling about their beloved leader now?<br/>
Ugh.<br/>
