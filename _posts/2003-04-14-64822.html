<div id="ygrps-yiv-986579027">Just out of pure curiousity, and to confirm what I thought had taken place, I <br/>
went back to the archives to follow the &quot;Christian thread&quot;   If anyone really <br/>
cares,  and just to completely, and with documented sources, wants to see how <br/>
the thread started (without sorting through hundreds of posts), the original <br/>
post was # 63844, Ang&#39;s reply was #63846, which started the &quot;Christians <br/>
again&quot; thread.  Then in post #<br/>
63902, another reference was made to &quot;Christian homeschoolers&quot;  and I <br/>
responded with post #63910.    Sometimes it makes things more clear to go <br/>
back to the beginning and read from there<br/>
