Why is it perfectly acceptable to respect your kid acheiving readiness for reading &quot;late,&quot; but not &quot;early?&quot;  My 3 yo is reading (and he has never had any phonics or any other lessons); if there was a high school science text or a vcr owner&#39;s manual around here, I assure you he would read it.  He might not &quot;get&quot; some of it, but he would absolutely comprehend a great deal (and would try to understand what he didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; by asking me a slew of questions).  Yesterday, he must have been reading my new book in the bathroom (The Well Dog Book), because he came out and called the dog and showed me her ear is called a &quot;pinna,&quot; and her heel is her &quot;hock,&quot; and her forehead is her &quot;stop.&quot;  His comprehension must be better than mine, because I am almost done w that book, had already read that section, and I didn&#39;t catch these terms.  Are you saying I should try to prevent my son from reading b/c it might strain his eyes?  Why would reading strain his eyes?  If he<br/>
 wasn&#39;t ready to read, he wouldn&#39;t be reading.<br/>
Sorry to be offended, but I thought unschooling was all about recognizing and respecting that every child has their own time table for learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941018609">I&#39;m sorry, Millie. Didn&#39;t mean to offend. I do think, if a kid&#39;s <br/>
ready, he or she will read, no matter the age. One friend, when we <br/>
first started homeschooling, had a boy whose first word was read when <br/>
he was two, and he hadn&#39;t slowed down as of age 11, when we knew <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
But what I&#39;m talking about is teaching &quot;reading&quot; to little kids, who <br/>
are capable of piecing together the sounds of words, without the <br/>
comprehension. English is really not that hard to learn. The schools <br/>
make it seem so, for their own reasons. With all of my kids, except <br/>
my late starter, a teensy weensy bit of phonics was all that was <br/>
needed, and then they were on to real reading. Not reading to show <br/>
off, nor reading &quot;primer&quot; or &quot;reader&quot; type books, but real books. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My 3 yo is reading (and he has never had any phonics or any other <br/>
&gt;lessons); <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you didn&#39;t pick him up at age three and say &quot;Okay. Gonna learn to <br/>
read.&quot; and then put him through phonics.<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;S what I find ludicrous about those ads for phonics programs. <br/>
Extensive phonics is not necessary for kids who are ready to read. <br/>
Extensive phonics will make zero difference, for kids who are not <br/>
ready. I&#39;ve experienced both.<br/>
<br/>
and yes, I&#39;ve seen bad eyesight in kids who learned early, or who <br/>
read a lot (myself included), while eyes remain stronger in kids <br/>
whose reading started a little bit later. <br/>
<br/>
The difference in our current society is, while early reading is <br/>
beamed upon with great pride and respect, late reading is seen as <br/>
something to be avoided and fretted over and worried about. To the <br/>
detriment of the late starting reader.<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s the point of my post. Not dissing early starting readers at <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
sorry about the offense. None was intended.<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>
