<div id="ygrps-yiv-434078787">You guys can buy this book which was JUST republished for CHEAP (way cheaper <br/>
than used copies have been going for, IF you could find one, and I don&#39;t even <br/>
ever lend mine out anymore).  I&#39;m SO glad this is back in print.  You can all <br/>
get one and you won&#39;t need this list anymore at all!  (well maybe <br/>
sometimes...)<br/>
<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we took over the John Holt bookstore, we never thought we would have<br/>
<br/>
the chance to carry a new book by John Holt (who died in 1985). Okay, it&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
not a &quot;completely&quot; new book, but it is largely new. Long out of print (with<br/>
<br/>
used copies often going for much more than the original purchase price!),<br/>
<br/>
the classic &quot;Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path to Education&quot; has now been<br/>
<br/>
updated and re-released.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The new version is entitled &quot;Teach Your Own - The John Holt Book of<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling.&quot; Appropriately enough, it has been updated and edited by<br/>
<br/>
Patrick Farenga, the president of Holt Associates. Pat has combined personal<br/>
<br/>
stories and the resources from his own book, &quot;The Beginners Guide to<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling,&quot; with this classic work by the father of the modern<br/>
<br/>
homeschooling movement. The original was published in 1981 and was the<br/>
<br/>
source of inspiration for many parents considering homeschooling. Holt&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
words are every bit as inspiring today and show a timeless common-sense that<br/>
<br/>
will have nodding your head in agreement as you read along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This book will help you avoid the trap of turning your home into a miniature<br/>
<br/>
school. Instead, you will be encouraged to take advantage of the flexibility<br/>
<br/>
homeschooling offers you to provide an educational experience that is nearly<br/>
<br/>
impossible to duplicate in schools. If you are already homeschooling but<br/>
<br/>
have ever had moments of self-doubt, or wondered how to face relatives who<br/>
<br/>
question your decision, then this book will restore your confidence and<br/>
<br/>
remind you of the many benefits of the path you have chosen. If you are just<br/>
<br/>
getting started or only considering homeschooling, then this book will help<br/>
<br/>
open your eyes about the many possibilities and will supply you with a<br/>
<br/>
wealth of information and resources to help you on your way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Legal advice and suggestions for countering common objections to<br/>
<br/>
homeschooling are included. An extensive bibliography and several appendices<br/>
<br/>
will provide you with information on other books, correspondence programs,<br/>
<br/>
curriculum suppliers, helpful private schools, homeschooling organizations,<br/>
<br/>
learning materials, and opportunities and activities. This is a &quot;must have&quot;<br/>
<br/>
book for every homeschooler!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
List price is $18.00, but for a limited time is available from FUN Books for<br/>
<br/>
$12.50.  Go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.fun-books.com/specials.htm">http://www.fun-books.com/specials.htm</a><br/>
