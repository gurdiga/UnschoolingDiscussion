needs the deschooling not him (LOL).... I just asked him if he wanted to help <br/>
me put a map of the US together (a puzzle) and he said &quot;no mommy I&#39;m going to <br/>
play on my computer and learn all about the human body and how it works (It&#39;s <br/>
a CD I have from DK).... Soon I will stop pushing things on him in the hope <br/>
that he&#39;ll learn what I think he needs to learn.... But give me a break guys <br/>
it&#39;s only been 3 days (LOL)<br/>
