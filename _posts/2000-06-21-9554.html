<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214108699">Thanks all for the wonderful feedback on the NW and other places you guys <br/>
live.  Living in Seattle would be no problem for me as I&#39;m born and bred in <br/>
England and so the rain is second nature for me(LOL)... My kids are born in <br/>
the desert though... Although Zak loves to wear socks, long pants and a long <br/>
shirt on very hot days (something I find very distressing with 110 heat!!!).<br/>
<br/>
The hard part for us is that my parents are here and very involved with their <br/>
grandchildren.  My mother is retired... I came to motherhood later at 36 and <br/>
40 and so my mother was really ready for grandmahood.  She sees them several <br/>
times a week and Zak will go to hers for the entire afternoon one day a week. <br/>
 Also when I work on the radio she has the baby until I&#39;m done, which is <br/>
usually about 2 hours.  So we have to balance the needs of having our kids <br/>
have grandparents and our needs to be in a much cooler area and also around <br/>
more unschoolers.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll make that decision today... I think <br/>
I&#39;ll go put on the pork chops instead.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296607296">Hye, we have hot days.  The fact that we&#39;ve probably had all <br/>
we&#39;re getting this year makes no difference, IMNSHO &lt;big grin&gt;  <br/>
Those grandparents are darned handy to have around (if they <br/>
don&#39;t drive you nuts &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
