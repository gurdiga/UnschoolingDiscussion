<br/>
at the end of the day your house is a shambles and you breath and SMILE <br/>
wow a lot of learning happened to day.<br/>
<br/>
when the other homeschoolers ask you how you get your kids to do their <br/>
school work you say we don&#39;t have school work we unschool<br/>
<br/>
Very sad actually. On my first visit to the local homeschool group one <br/>
of the moms said she threatens her kids to send them to school <br/>
sometimes when they balk at doing their school work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-424788956">Kelly,   you must have some really cool friends!<br/>
 <br/>
When I try and talk to people about it they either 1) look at me like I&#39;m from outer space  or 2) look at me like I&#39;m from outer space.           After I say we don&#39;t use curriculum they will eventually say, &quot;well I guess as long as they are being taught what they need,&quot;  by then I&#39;m usually just kind-of nodding my head and saying,  &quot;yeah&quot;.     <br/>

Its especially hard to talk to people when even the thought of homeschooling, let alone unschooling, is foreign.<br/>

I can think of a few.<br/>
Unschooling if:<br/>
<br/>
LEGOs mean much more to you now than just toys on the floor.<br/>
you don&#39;t know how to pronounce or spell some of the home<br/>

This would be great,  I know alot of people around me don&#39;t know who Viggo Mortensen is (or Aragorn for that matter)  and probably know who David Duchovny is, but havn&#39;t watched him alot because they would probably think X-files is too &#39;out-there&#39;.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826107999">Mom&#39;s Night Out...wow, what a concept. We live in an area where <br/>
homeschooling is majorly frowned upon by the dominant religion <br/>
(Mormonism) and we are the only ones at our church who homeschool, <br/>
AND people at our church are totally non-supportive of homeschooling. <br/>
The nearest town with a homeschool group is an hour away, so we gave <br/>
up on regular meetings with them in our first year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never gone on a mom&#39;s night out with a bunch of homeschooling <br/>

<br/>
wow. Consider yourselves blessed to have a group that does that!<br/>

there were some nice fun people there.<br/>
We hardly ever see anyone now. Just one other Mum will let her kids play with mine. I&#39;m pretty lonely and fed up but I&#39;m not going to pretend to be something I&#39;m not just to have company. I&#39;ll just keep<br/>
taking Prozac and counting the days till we leave :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Wow, I must have it so lucky. I&#39;d say that most of the families in<br/>
&gt; &gt; our homeschool group range from relaxed homeschooling to radical<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling. I can&#39;t imagine it even being a topic of conversation<br/>
&gt; &gt; at a MNO,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am in two homeschool groups, for the play group mostly, but I am one of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; only unschoolers there.  I can only name one other unschooler at one<br/>
group.<br/>
&gt; The others are soooooooo school at home.  But the topic usually ends up<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; me and what I do and how our days look.  And the mothers are always<br/>
telling<br/>
&gt; me how great my kids are.  Asking me how I get them interested in things,<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; they learn &quot;what they need to learn&quot;.  Have yet to have an answer from any<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; them as to what &quot;they NEED to learn&quot;  and for what.  But anyway I agree<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; Kelly, I am the Martian and they want to know everything about this alien<br/>
&gt; creature and how it works.  LOL<br/>

I am in about the same situation you are, and I decided that making that<br/>
drive to the MNO was really important (just this year, and I have been<br/>
homeschooling for eight years, just started unschooling).  I really, really<br/>
think this is worth it.  It helps you stay sane and feel a little less<br/>
lonely.  I also have a town and church who don&#39;t agree with homeschooling<br/>
(and I&#39;m not even telling them we are unschooling!), so I know what it likes<br/>
to be the lone ranger.  It really is worth the drive for me!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t necessarily what she can do but what she wants to do.  My boys have <br/>
always loved plants.  I do to.  They love to help me pick out flowering <br/>
plants for the flower garden adn seeds for the veggies and love to get dirty <br/>
and plant.  Spring is coming.  Maybe you 2 coudl start some seedlings <br/>
indoors.  Do you enjoy plants.  She may not stay interested in all the <br/>
details like watching you look up how to set up a growing light but she is <br/>
watching you involved in something and she is learning a lot about life.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I let my boys find what they are interested in.  I find it so amazing <br/>
to watch and follow them on their journey.  And I learn a lot myself.  I just <br/>
let my boys do what they want to do.  Sometimes that is playing for hours on <br/>
the computer.  Sometimes that is playing for hours outside. sometimes it is <br/>
more specific.  Like if they have a certain question.  I don&#39;t feel it is my <br/>
job to find their interests.  I answer questions and I also ask and answer my <br/>
own questions out loud.  So they can hear the thought process.  I try to help <br/>
them if they need help. And find answers to questions.  We do lots of things <br/>
together.  Like planting the garden, or swimming, or drawing.  I also try to <br/>
follow my passion.  My passions is quilting and I think they learn a lot <br/>
about life by watching me involved in something I love.  And they ask <br/>
questions about that too. I know I love to talk about my passion so if they <br/>
are interested in something I ask questions of them as well and give them a <br/>
chance to talk.<br/>
Waaaay to long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349369762">Hi Erin<br/>
<br/>
Well, my best friend also homeschools, and we get together several <br/>
times a month, either the families together, or just her and me. I <br/>
get time away, although not necessarily with a group of moms. I&#39;ll <br/>
have to check with the nearest group and see if they have anything <br/>
like that. Now, a question:<br/>
<br/>
You said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and I have been<br/>
&gt; homeschooling for eight years, just started unschooling)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could you describe your journey to unschooling? This concept seems to <br/>
be capturing my imagination, and I&#39;d like to have some input about <br/>
experienced homeschoolers making the decision to loosen the reins and <br/>
let the kids go for it. What authors have been influential? Did any <br/>
experience with some set curriculum turn you off of &quot;doing school at <br/>
home&quot;? What about anxiety? Did/do you worry that the kids might never <br/>
learn to (fill in the blank), if you left them alone? <br/>
<br/>
Were you one who already answered my post on this topic? LOL If so, <br/>
I&#39;ll go back into the archives.<br/>
<br/>
anyways.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the input!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t qualify as a former homeschooler who loosened reins since I always <br/>
homeschooled, but I&#39;m interested, too, in how people switch out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m especially interested in this:<br/>
<br/>
It seems when somone takes a kid out of school, or switches from <br/>
school-at-home after a child is nine or so, they still credit &quot;school&quot; with <br/>
the fact that the child can read and add and multiply.<br/>
<br/>
Those being the first pass of bug-a-boos, I wonder if it&#39;s harder for THAT <br/>
set of unschoolers to believe that algebra (for the second set of bug-a-boos) <br/>
and grammar and &quot;just come.&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OH MY.. I really feel good that maybe I can contribute and not be seen as .. <br/>
???  anything but helpful.<br/>
<br/>
 I DONT credit &quot;school&quot; with much at all that my kids have learned.. Not <br/>
reading, not math.. maybe some history and science that they wouldnt have <br/>
read on thier &quot;own&quot;  but they have only retained what they found interesting <br/>
in those subjects..   When I hear folks  talk about phonics and teaching  <br/>
kids to read.. ..even with my kids going to school, that seems like a foreign <br/>
concept  to &quot;teach&quot; a kid how to read.   I read to my kids since they day <br/>
they were born.  Landon loved it.. from an infant he was entralled with books <br/>
and being read to..  He would sit for hours and let us ( ask us) to read to <br/>
him . He started talking when he was 9 mos old.. ( NO KIDDING) He could carry <br/>
on a converstaion with an adult when he was two.. I mean a REAL conversation. <br/>
  He started reading pretty much on his own when he was about 5.. I will <br/>
never forget.. We had a Richard Scarry story book. . . my first reading book <br/>
or something.. The first story was.. See See, I see a bee!  Oh Oh.. the bee <br/>
sees me!   I see the bee and the bee sees me.. ect ect.. You get the idea.   <br/>
I read the story to him. then , he read to me.  He didnt memorize it. he read <br/>
it.. He learned the word &quot;see&quot; and then just went from there.. It was easy as <br/>
pie for him. <br/>
<br/>
  Anna was pretty much the same way.. She was reading easily in <br/>
kindergarten..    I know she had &quot;phonics lessons&quot;  but.. I really dont think <br/>
they had anything to do with her learning to read.  <br/>
<br/>
 Ethan.. I read to him just like the other.. He HATED it.. wouldnt sit <br/>
still.. squirmed.. wandered off.. Even if Landon and Anna tried to read to <br/>
him. no go.. I continued to read to them. they read to themselves and to each <br/>
other.. Ethan sometimes joined in for few minutes.. but usually not.   He <br/>
never liked books.. Wasnt  interested in reading.  He was tested at 5 ( <br/>
because of some behavioral concerns at preschool)  I was already pretty sure <br/>
that he was ADHD.   They said he was about 18 mos behind developmentally... I <br/>
could buy that.. he did &#39;act&quot; like he was bout 3 and half a lot of the time.  <br/>
They more or less told me.. &quot;He will fail in school, he may not read til he&#39;s <br/>
older ( than &#39;average&quot;) he will struggle.. etc etc.. OH GEE THANKS.. what a <br/>
wonderful label for my child.  Anyway, when he went to school, he couldnt <br/>
recognize all of his letters..   But, by the end of kindergarten, he could <br/>
read.  Was it the phonics?  The &quot;lessons&quot;?  &quot;school&quot; in general?  I dont <br/>
think so.  Although, the phonics program that the charter school they <br/>
attended had a WONDERFUL approach to learning to read. ( which, I am <br/>
sure.helped a lot, rather than hindered his reading) .. I think he just <br/>
learned to read when he was ready.  I never &quot;worked&quot; with him. .Other than to <br/>
continue to read to him.   They didnt have homework at all .. They did send <br/>
books home and we read them together.   He had a teacher sent straight from <br/>
heaven.  I DO credit a lot of his success to her.. as a person, a loving, <br/>
caring, intelligent individual... she was wonderful for Ethan.   Basically, <br/>
we got lucky.  He was also fortunate to have her in 1st grade too.  ( I <br/>
single handedly &quot;saved&quot;: my kids school from the sole motivation of Ethan <br/>
having Mrs Douglas again for 1st grade. . another , long story)  Now, Ethan <br/>
resists reading..  He still doesnt care for books.. He may pick one up and <br/>
read a few pages, but hes never finished a chapter book.  Books as gifts,  he <br/>
rolls his eyes..  Library.. hates it.. But, he CAN read.. he just doenst like <br/>
to.  <br/>
<br/>
  JP learned to read much like Anna and Landon. he just did it.. ( he had a <br/>
teacher from HELL in Kindergarten... I KNOW he didnt learn anything from her) <br/>
   Hes almost 8 now. and he reads like a typical 8 year old.. He would still <br/>
rather me read to him aloud. but he will read to me if he really likes a <br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
I think kids are either &quot;wired&quot; for reading and math .. Some &quot;get it&quot;.. some <br/>
dont.  None of my kids are proficient in math.. Im not either.   Landon didnt <br/>
learn his times tables til he was ??? later than 5th grade.. He had the great <br/>
fortune of skipping the 6th grade. . went straight on in to pre algebra.. and <br/>
got to use a calculator.. .. I asked him one day.. Landon, how did you learn <br/>
your times tables ?  He said.. I dont know.. over time I guess I just <br/>
memorized them. some of them I still dont know.  And, yeah, hes failed in <br/>
math.  He failed Algebra 1, part A as a freshmen, and he failed Geometry this <br/>
year.  Shrug.. I hate it for him.. mostly because I KNOW he could have passed <br/>
it if he really tried.(honestly, he didnt do his homework or study,,I never <br/>
made my kids do homework). and because its just time &quot;wasted&quot; that he has to <br/>
repeat the classes... but it was his choice to fail. <br/>
<br/>
  Anna is the better than any of the rest of us in math.  But she has been a <br/>
&quot;model&quot; student in everything.. She loves to do &quot;work&quot;  , loves to &quot;excel&quot; , <br/>
loves to please and succeed..   Anna should be the poster child for the <br/>
perfect public school student.   Smart, popular, polite, caring, concerned, <br/>
every body loved her from students to staff..  Honestly, I got the most flack <br/>
from everyone for taking Anna out of school.. And, she has hinted several <br/>
times that she wishes she hadnt &quot;quit school&quot;   She&#39;s bored, lonely, <br/>
unmotivated, and feels quilty and useless.  <br/>
<br/>
Ethan.. not wired for math or reading.  .. He did pick up reading, I think <br/>
from &quot;exposure&quot;  But, math.. not yet. Im not really worried though.. At least <br/>
at home hes not being demeaned and berated because he is &quot;behind&quot; or stupid.  <br/>
Ethan likes to build things.. Move things.  Ride things.. He likes speed and <br/>
motion.  Hes just got his strengths in different areas.. NOT &quot;academics&quot; per <br/>
se..  Thats why staying at home, and NOT going to school is wonderful for him<br/>
<br/>
JP.. he more like Anna in his &quot;learning style&quot;  he learns pretty easily and <br/>
picks up stuff with just a little &quot;guidance&quot; and support.. But, hes got the <br/>
little boy peronality that tends more toward playing and having fun than <br/>
&quot;working&quot; or showing progress.  <br/>
<br/>
Gosh, I think I just basically rambled on more than answering the question.. <br/>
But, the bottom line is.. Although my kids have been in school.. ( and one <br/>
still is)  I dont really credit &quot;school&quot; with much they&#39;ve learned at all.  <br/>
Anna has had some really good times at school.., so has Landon.. But they <br/>
were all social things. not academics.AND, yes, they learned &quot;real life&quot; <br/>
stuff about relationships, interacting, and about society in general.  . They <br/>
also had some really good teachers who enriched thier lives and had positive <br/>
influences on them as &quot;really good people&quot;   But, all the busy work, tests, <br/>
homework, etc.. theyve done.. basically a waste of time and energy, a source <br/>
of stress, and nothing but a headache for them and me.<br/>

It might help you to read this on deschooling yourself.   When you don&#39;t find <br/>
her interests strange but you&#39;re glad of her differences, it will be a big <br/>
step toward natural learning.  But she&#39;s so young that you have time to stay <br/>
several steps ahead of her.<br/>
