<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546328410">My husband and I are leaning toward unschooling once we hit the road, <br/>
hopefully this fall.  Right now my mother homeschools the kids.  She <br/>
really wanted to do this (have been homeschooling seven years) so I <br/>
let her.  I &quot;substitute&quot; teach LOL.  We just purchased a 35&#39; GMC <br/>
transit bus and are going to start converting it to a motorhome soon. <br/>
We (DH and I) have been discussing how on earth we are going to <br/>
continue with schooling the way we are now.  We have come to the <br/>
conclusion that there is no way we will be able to.  We have decided <br/>
that unschooling is going to be the best for our family at this time. <br/>
We plan on putting a &quot;library&quot; on the bus and I have already begun <br/>
buying up appropriate books for when they want to read, lots of games,<br/>
and of course our computer.<br/>
<br/>
I DREAD telling my mother.  She already thinks I don&#39;t care about the <br/>
schooling of my kids because I generally step aside and let her do it.<br/>
I know, some out there will be wondering why I just don&#39;t &quot;take over&quot;.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t think I do a complete enough job.  She never comes right <br/>
out and says so but I&#39;ll hear muttered comments about how &quot;behind&quot; my <br/>
kids are.  And I always feel that since she is the main &quot;teacher&quot; it <br/>
isn&#39;t on my shoulders that they&#39;re &quot;behind&quot;.  It will be an <br/>
interesting conversation to say the least!!<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand the relative interogation.  In fact, we have <br/>
quite a few that &quot;suggest&quot; we put them in public school for high <br/>
school, and a lot of other well meant advice.  I just nod and say &quot;Oh <br/>
ya.  Uh-huh.  Hmmm.&quot;  I say just ignore them.  I do!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696336332">Oh Molly how wonderful for your children to travel and really see life.  I do<br/>
not have the courage to do such a thing...I&#39;m a hermit/homebody.<br/>
Your children can only benefit...and anyone who cannot see that is living in<br/>
a very small (self centered) world....<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
And if your coming near us in NC, let us know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864041277">I have been thinking what else you might be able to do when people question <br/>
unschooling. My favorite by far is to remind the questioner that everyone <br/>
has something to show us, because our world is where we learn,  so if you <br/>
are really concerned my kids need something, plan to hang out with them. <br/>
Show them what you are afraid they are missing. Allowing my once skeptical <br/>
family to also facilitate in our adventure has shown the family my kids have <br/>
meaningful questions, they think, they talk, they make eye contact. They <br/>
know how to play at the park and order from menues. They can help with <br/>
little kids and set a table.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having my own struggle with other ps kids not treating my kids too well. <br/>
I&#39;m using the same comments to them, even telling the worst of the bunch <br/>
things like your baby sisters teach us things. These girls are barely 4 <br/>
months and were premature. Everyone has something to show us and it is <br/>
important to listen and believe eachother.<br/>
<br/>
I also make scrap books, or provide the materials for the kids to make their <br/>
own. Mainly for momentoes in the future. We write letters too, as a family <br/>
documenting our adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you stop getting hassled and your family starts trusting you more,<br/>
<br/>
