<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667019254">I hope you get a reply from a more scientific mind with a better memory for facts than mine but I do know that yes there are a lot of chemicals in processed white sugar that cause a lot of reactions in children especially (not that mine don&#39;t eat it) and that sugar in it&#39;s processed form is chemically much different than the sugar that results from other foods naturally breaking down in your body.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My ds is sensitive to all cane products. So it&#39;s not the fact that <br/>
it&#39;s sugar, it&#39;s the cane itself.<br/>
All sugars/starches are converted to glucose in the body, that much <br/>
is true. But how quickly they convert to glucose hugely affects the <br/>
biological response and how healthy it is. That&#39;s why the glycaemic <br/>
index (gi) was invented, to try and rate how quickly foods break <br/>
down to glucose.<br/>
Also, you&#39;ve got to remember that some sugars have trace minerals <br/>
and other healthful side benefits. Honey has minerals, same with <br/>
maple syrup, but corn syrup has none of those benefits and a high gi <br/>
to boot. The more processed a sugar is, the more healthful compounds <br/>
are taken out.<br/>
So there&#39;s a lot more to it than just what it ends up being at the <br/>
end of the process. How hard your body has to work to make it become <br/>
glucose affects more than you think. If your body has to dump a ton <br/>
of insulin to get the desired result, it&#39;s a lot harder on your body.<br/>
