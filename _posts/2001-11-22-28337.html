&gt; at all, its in the form of penny drives (not to knock the charity, but it<br/>
&gt; doesnt tend to get at the roots of big problems). If you were a teen,<br/>

<br/>
My response:<br/>
I wasnt referring to purely environmental issues or the ones that get<br/>
labelled as such (save the whales, etc.), but to issues clearly connected<br/>
to social consequences that the general public cares about at least to some<br/>
degree (starvation, war, terrorism, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that teens should have choices, and I know that some, given the<br/>
choice, will gravitate toward something like the stock market.<br/>
<br/>
But I cant help thinking that anybody (whether teen or adult) who bases<br/>
their life work and worth solely on something like making lots of money in<br/>
the stock market must, somewhere deep inside, have a pesky, itching<br/>
dissatisfaction eating away at them. Eventually it catches up with them,<br/>
maybe in the form of a mid-life crisis.<br/>
<br/>
What I meant to say when I referred to those teens allowed a measure of<br/>
freedom in the alternative schools of some years back is that they might<br/>
have had a chance to put their head up and look around at the big picture<br/>
earlier than most in this society, so they got a head start on the mid-life<br/>
crisis.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe some people are oblivious to these things all their lives, and<br/>
even when they catch a televised glimpse of starving kids, or whatever, they<br/>
dont make any connections at all and it doesnt trouble even their<br/>
subconscious minds in the least.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know  its hard to make valid general statements about what might<br/>
be troubling our teens, but I think people tend to overlook the possibility<br/>
that part of it is the big issues.<br/>
<br/>
That doesnt mean I would try to force a teen (or a child) to see the issues<br/>
the way I do. (I especially dislike environmental ed programs that try to<br/>
raise kids consciousnesses about pollution, etc., before theyve ever had<br/>
a chance to just muck around and have fun in the woods.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I might have explained myself better if I had put what I was trying<br/>
to say in more personal terms. I think that, given that my husband and I<br/>
feel his job is not really contributing to anything very positive in the<br/>
world, wed better do something about getting him a job we both believe in<br/>
before our son gets old enough to pick up on our dissatisfaction,<br/>
frustration and cynical complacency and grow into a troubled teenager<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
If we were fully convinced that the company my husband works for is doing<br/>
terrific things to help people all over the world - for example, by<br/>
stimulating the economy (no matter how much pollution this produces or<br/>
energy it wastes) or by providing people in poor countries with jobs<br/>
(however meager the pay or miserable the working conditions), maybe our son<br/>
wouldnt notice or be bothered by global issues.<br/>
<br/>
But, without looking very deeply into the particular practices of this<br/>
specific company, we suspect its doing things we wouldnt choose to do on<br/>
our own. Our son will eventually pick up on our ambivalence, if we dont<br/>
change something, and will be disappointed in us.<br/>
<br/>
That would be a hard blow, and one I think a lot of young people are hit<br/>
with as they try to figure out what to do with their own adult lives.<br/>

what message would that give to him. . . I know that is something I am <br/>

about the mistakes I make. I think it&#39;s so very valuable for a young person <br/>
to see their parent say, you know, I have done this or am doing this and it&#39;s <br/>
a mistake or its now who I want to show up as in this world. . . just being <br/>
able to see that the person they view somewhat as a god can make mistakes and <br/>
admit them is one of the most important lessons I have been able to give to <br/>

what message would that give to him. . . I know that is something I am<br/>
looking at. . . and how I might pass that on to Lelia. We are discussing it<br/>
together though. . . I like being able to do that with her. . . being open<br/>
about the mistakes I make. I think it&#39;s so very valuable for a young person<br/>
to see their parent say, you know, I have done this or am doing this and <br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
a mistake or its now who I want to show up as in this world. . . just being<br/>
able to see that the person they view somewhat as a god can make mistakes <br/>
and<br/>
admit them is one of the most important lessons I have been able to give to<br/>
them.<br/>
