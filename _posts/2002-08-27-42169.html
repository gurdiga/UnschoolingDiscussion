Thanks, Mary.<br/>

I would still like for Ned to give us the details HE knows, because if he&#39;s <br/>
going to be going around asserting simply that someone was shot for <br/>
homeschooling he should have the facts right at hand.  And I&#39;m a day behind <br/>
on e-mail, so maybe he has done so, but if he does NOT answer this question <br/>
and some others pretty soon, I&#39;m going to request that he be removed from <br/>
this list.  It&#39;s over a dozen questions now, I&#39;m sure, that people have asked <br/>
Ned directly that he has just flatly ignored.  If he&#39;s going to pour <br/>
vitriolic rhetoric over us all with NO attempt at responsibility for the <br/>
&quot;facts&quot; he&#39;s presenting, I think it is vastly more damaging than it&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
I might not get my way if I ask, and that&#39;s fine.  But I&#39;m past tired of the <br/>
one-way &quot;information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The world is a big place.  The internet is a big place.  People who want Ned <br/>
can find him very easily.  <br/>
