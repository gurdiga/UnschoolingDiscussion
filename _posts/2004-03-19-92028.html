&lt;&lt; Walking up to a school-at-homer and telling them they are all wet and<br/>
<br/>
unschooling is the only way to go isn&#39;t going to get me very far.  Having<br/>
<br/>
them see me with my kids, spend time with us playing and learning, modelling<br/>
<br/>
unschooling for them might. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  My kids are out there.  Lots of homeschoolers in town here know my <br/>
kids.  Lots of them know me.  Lately fewer of the new ones do, though, because I <br/>
can no longer stand to sit on a park bench with a mom while the kids play, and <br/>
have her complain to me that she can&#39;t figure out how to make her kid do his <br/>
math.  Or to debate with someone whether she should make her kids write for <br/>
their own good.  They&#39;re five or six.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to do one-on-one face-to-face same-old explanation that really <br/>
she doesn&#39;t have to do that at all.  But I&#39;m not willing to smile wanly and say <br/>
&quot;yeah, that&#39;s hard; good luck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The problem in these cases is how much work do I want to have to do to <br/>
maintain my own integrity?  I don&#39;t want to seem to agree with &quot;they have to do <br/>
their work&quot; talk, and I don&#39;t want to recite the precepts of unschooling three <br/>
times a playgroup hour.<br/>
<br/>
(I know there are alternatives, and I&#39;ve been there and done that, and my <br/>
current plan is to mostly hang out with homeschoolers I already know.)<br/>
