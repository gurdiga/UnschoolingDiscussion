<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060339140">Cats reach their maximum velocity at 10 to 12 stories (I think). This is partially remembered data from an AVMA High-Rise Syndrome article.  They can and do survive, but not without injury.  So 10 or 100, it does not matter.  Cool!   Body shape helps slow them and yes, they can and do turn over.  That info I read in a recent kid&#39;s magazines.  It had photos of this (shorter fall ; )<br/>
<br/>
Great trivia!  <br/>

them turn their head, spot the ground and bring the rest of their body <br/>
into line before hitting. It&#39;s fascinating to see that level of <br/>
coordination and muscle control and all.</div>
