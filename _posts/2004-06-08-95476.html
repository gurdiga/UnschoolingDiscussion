<br/>
I was thinking about this issue just this weekend when reading an article on<br/>
Toddler Pathologies in the April 19th issue of _New York Magazine_. Here&#39;s a<br/>
link to the article <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/health/features/n_10180/">http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/health/features/n_10180/</a><br/>
, which encapsulates nicely the early pressure placed on parents in the<br/>
North East corridor--Washington, DC on through to Boston and probably<br/>
elsewhere, though I can&#39;t speak to that. The article specifically refers to<br/>
NY City&#39;s upscale population, but truth is, this pressure trickles down the<br/>
socio-economic scale, less-concentrated perhaps, but still very much a<br/>
reality for most parents here. The Head-Start programs that are pushing to<br/>
all-day pre-K in this area are no exception. An article in the Washington<br/>
Post a couple months ago interviewed a Northern Virginia Principal who<br/>
wanted to eliminated naps from all-day Pre-K in an effort to keep up with<br/>
early academic race. He was quoted as saying something along the lines of<br/>
&quot;this isn&#39;t baby stuff anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the above reason, but there&#39;s also a sense of the continuity of<br/>
trusting a child to learn and providing a warm, supportive atmosphere that<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop just because children reach compulsory school age. So often<br/>
we&#39;ll say to new unschoolers or those thinking about it, &quot;how did your child<br/>
learn to walk, to talk, etc.&quot;. In that sense most of us do unschool our<br/>
children from birth--some just lose that sense of trust and give in to the<br/>
anxiety-producing rhetoric of experts.<br/>
