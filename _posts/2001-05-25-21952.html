<h4>The Mowery Family</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549248945">Yes, I do believe this is the song!  Wherever did you find this?  Did you just do a search?  Was there sheet music, because I can&#39;t quite remember the tune.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my, Dana will be so thrilled - what a song for a kid to love - perhaps it was the presentation.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again!<br/>
Off to search engines,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Peel Me A Grape <br/>
<br/>
Peel me a grape, crush me some ice <br/>
Skin me a peach, save the fuzz for my pillow <br/>
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice <br/>
You&#39;ve got to wine and dine me <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to fool me bejewel me <br/>
Either amuse me or lose me <br/>
I&#39;m getting hungry, peel me a grape <br/>
<br/>
Pop me a cork, french me a fry <br/>
Crack me a nut, bring a bowl full of bon-bons <br/>
Chill me some wine, keep standing by <br/>
Just entertain me, champagne me <br/>
Show me you love me, kid glove me <br/>
Best way to cheer me, cashmere me <br/>
I&#39;m getting hungry, peel me grape <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how to be an agreeable chap <br/>
Love me and leave me in luxury&#39;s lap <br/>
Hop when I holler, skip when I snap <br/>
When I say, &quot;do it,&quot; jump to it <br/>
<br/>
Send out for scotch, call me a cab <br/>
Cut me a rose, make my tea with the petals <br/>
Just hang around, pick up the tab <br/>
Never out think me, just mink me <br/>
Polar bear rug me, don&#39;t bug me <br/>
New Thunderbird me, you heard me <br/>
I&#39;m getting hungry, peel me a grape <br/>
<br/>
