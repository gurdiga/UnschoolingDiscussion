<div id="ygrps-yiv-926602178">My dh, James, who some of you met at the last conference, is a Licensed<br/>
Amateur Radio Operator, ie a Ham. He is interested in leading a funshop<br/>
activity about Ham radios at the next conference. His idea is to set up a<br/>
temporary station at the hotel - this does not entail construction of any<br/>
kind btw. Hams do a thing called Field Day several times a year in different<br/>
parts of the country. I guess his notion is to do a kind of mini field day<br/>
if there are enough other hams interested amongst the attendees. He asked me<br/>
to field (heh,heh) the idea and gauge the interest level.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
His second idea for an activity is to create a temporary geocache somewhere<br/>
interesting near the hotel, and offer maps and compasses, or the loan of GPS<br/>
units, to enable anyone who wants to, to join in the treasure hunt of<br/>
geocaching. I know that this hobby has been mentioned on the list in the<br/>
past - similar to letterboxing. James at one time had the first and only<br/>
cache in the LA area - finally it was removed from near the airport probably<br/>
by security personnel. It really can be quite a fun thing to do. The idea is<br/>
to find it using the aforementioned tools, open the box, take something,<br/>
leave something else, and make a note in the journal. There was an<br/>
enthusiastic e-list going for a while with people finding it challenging to<br/>
discover James&#39; well hidden box. One finder once left Margarita fixings<br/>
including tequila, but for the conference the contents would be kid<br/>
appropriate. We thought about the idea of including some disposable cameras<br/>
for the finders to take their photo, and we would be able to publish those<br/>
to the web later. Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227581949">I like both ideas! I will ask Sarah what she thinks later after she awakens. We both are interested in geocaching, and are looking into GPS units; we have plans to get the supplies today to start letterboxing actually!<br/>
