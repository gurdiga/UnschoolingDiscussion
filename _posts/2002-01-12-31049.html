<div id="ygrps-yiv-620652253">Hey all, I had this forwarded to me, and thought it was really poinient. It reminds us to keep sight of what is really important in our lives, enjoy.<br/>
        Candy Oliver<br/>
I ran into a stranger as he passed by, <br/>
&quot;Oh excuse me please&quot; was my reply. <br/>
He said, &quot;Please excuse me too; <br/>
I wasn&#39;t watching for you.&quot; <br/>
We were very polite, this stranger and I. <br/>
We went on our way saying good-bye. <br/>
But at home a difference is told, <br/>
how we treat our loved ones, young and old. <br/>
Later that day, cooking the evening meal, <br/>
My son stood beside me very still. <br/>
As I turned, I nearly knocked him down. <br/>
&quot;Move out of the way,&quot; I said with a frown. <br/>
He walked away, his little heart broken. <br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how harshly I&#39;d spoken. <br/>
While I lay awake in bed, <br/>
God&#39;s still small voice came to me and said, <br/>
&quot;While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use, <br/>
But the children you love, you seem to abuse. <br/>
Go and look on the kitchen floor, <br/>
You&#39;ll find some flowers there by the door. <br/>
Those are the flowers he brought for you. <br/>
He picked them himself: pink, yellow and blue. <br/>
He stood very quietly not to spoil the surprise, <br/>
and you never saw the tears that filled his little eyes.&quot; <br/>
By this time, I felt very small, <br/>
and now my tears began to fall. <br/>
I quietly went and knelt by his bed; <br/>
&quot;Wake up, little one, wake up,&quot; I said. &quot; <br/>
Are these the flowers you picked for me?&quot; <br/>
He smiled, &quot;I found &#39;em, out by the tree. <br/>
I picked &#39;em because they&#39;re pretty like you. <br/>
I knew you&#39;d like &#39;em, especially the blue.&quot; <br/>
I said, &quot;Son, I&#39;m very sorry for the way I acted today; <br/>
I shouldn&#39;t have yelled at you that way.&quot; <br/>
He said, &quot;Oh, Mom, that&#39;s okay. I love you anyway.&quot; <br/>
I said, &quot;Son, I love you too, <br/>
and I do like the flowers, especially the blue.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Are you aware that if we died tomorrow, the company that we are working <br/>
for would easily replace us in a matter of days. But the family we left <br/>
behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to think <br/>
of it, we pour ourselves more into work than to our own family an unwise <br/>
investment indeed, don&#39;t you think? So what is behind the story? Do you <br/>
know what the word FAMILY means? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104020519">this made me cry.  and cry and cry and cry...sobbing kind of crying which I<br/>
never never do...<br/>
<br/>
thank you for sending this.  I needed to read something like this in a big<br/>
way to remind me how often I am DISrespectful to my children but how I would<br/>
be horrified to speak to a stranger this way.<br/>
<br/>
I printed it off and put it on my bathroom wall so that I have to look at it<br/>
every day.  I hope when I have company that it makes them stop and think<br/>
too.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815913966">I am glad you liked it.. It had the same effect on me. After sobbing a while, I had to sit down and tell Courtney how thankful I was for her, and how much I loved her. I think it is a great idea to print it out, I think I will do the same.<br/>
