&gt; there is no one else available to watch the kids, and they are too young to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was great Pam as it bought up more issues other than this.  The reason <br/>
Steve takes the kids when I&#39;m working is so that they are not making too much <br/>
noise or bankging on my door, or Max (nearly 2) coming looking for me and <br/>
crying at my door.  That sounds terrible and as I thought about it decided <br/>
that I need to change my work schedule again so that doesn&#39;t need to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Whew this is exhausting thinking of the chances that I need to make in order <br/>
to unschool him in the way I&#39;d really like too and to have a lifestyle I <br/>
really want. (LOL)<br/>
