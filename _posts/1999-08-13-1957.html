<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123145514">You said:<br/>
{Ya&#39;ll will like this... One day, when Matt was about 6, he was walking<br/>
through the kitchen. He stopped to look at the poster on the fridge. I<br/>
asked, &quot; Matt, do you know the sound the letter B makes?&quot;<br/>
He said, &quot;yes.&quot;<br/>
And kept walking.........}<br/>
<br/>
What a hoot!  Interestingly, Cody can&#39;t &quot;hear&quot; the difference between &quot;B&quot;<br/>
and &quot;M&quot;  (Hmm - maybe this should be in the &quot;Potty - Learning&quot; thread?)<br/>
When I realized that I just figured, &quot;Forget this - how confusing is this<br/>
going to be!&quot;     I always point out to him, &quot;Hey, how&#39;d you know that&quot; When<br/>
he tells me something where he obviously had to &quot;read&quot; a word - like right<br/>
now he has a library book of &quot;collectible&quot; Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars and<br/>
he said &quot;Look, here&#39;s a Nintendo Truck&quot;  Sure, it&#39;s a Logo - but never the<br/>
less it is a form of &quot;decoding&quot;  I guess I feel the more he sees how he uses<br/>
reading, and the more he believes he&#39;s capable of reading, the sooner he&#39;ll<br/>
want to figure it all out for himself.  Meanwhile, I&#39;m not reading things to<br/>
him that I find boring.  I remember with my older son I was reading , I<br/>
think, Hatchet by Gary Paulson and it was a great book, but not a very good<br/>
read aloud, and I just said &quot;You know, I&#39;m not really interested in this<br/>
book and It really doesn&#39;t &quot;flow&quot; so if you want to know how it turns out<br/>
you&#39;re going to have to read it yourself&quot;<br/>
And he did....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173392664">The best system is to teach the vowel sounds first (yes, you can do it<br/>
yourself!) --short vowels that is. Then teach a few consonant sounds to make<br/>
simple words like cat and rat. I have all the details in my book and more<br/>
&quot;how to start&quot; info at my website.<br/>
