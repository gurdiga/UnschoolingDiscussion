 Hi all, we have a snake in need. A tiny baby garter anake, less than a <br/>
quarter inch in diameter, doesn&#39;t seem interested in insects - we got it from <br/>
a friend, it&#39;s been captive for about two weeks now. Does anyone know how we <br/>
can get the little guy to eat? His<br/>
 skin is getting flacid, we&#39;re worried about the little guy! Thanks in <br/>
advance. Logan<br/>

change it&#39;s water every day.  I have never had a snake, but I read they can <br/>
eat live fish, and that you could give it goldfish.   ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200976927">How long is it?     Diameter doesn&#39;t give that much to go on for age.<br/>
Have you tried   small worms?<br/>
<br/>
I am asking my son for information but his main response is that garter<br/>
snakes are &quot;hard captives&quot;<br/>

Garters are born ready to survive on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Why let the poor thing suffer if he&#39;s not thriving.<br/>
I&#39;d release him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817240506">My son the herper says wild caught garter snakes just don&#39;t do well at all<br/>
in captivity.    Babies are about 3 inches long and eat worms.  Adults  and<br/>
even juveniles may eat fish or frogs but it all depends on where it came<br/>
from.    They have a very wide range  where they are found in the wild.<br/>
So you have to worry not only about finding the right size but whether  it<br/>
will even be attracted to it in its very stressed state.<br/>
<br/>
Really the best thing is to release it.        It you know what kind of<br/>
terrain it was originally captured from,   it would be good to try to<br/>
release it somewhere similar and preferably in a place without a lot of<br/>
human traffic. .  But if you have a garden,   that would probably be fine<br/>
too and you could hope to see it again :-).             It is probably not<br/>
starving yet.   Reptiles can go long periods without food.  It is the stress<br/>
which is harming it.<br/>
<br/>
Evening a good time to turn it loose---especially if you are in a part of<br/>
the country with sizzling afternoons.    Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.:   When my children were much younger they were usually very receptive<br/>
to the idea that an animal needed to go find its mama   or that the mama<br/>
needed to get back to her babies!      Stretching the  science a bit does<br/>
not seem to have harmed them or made them distrustful of me:-).       It was<br/>
a means for them to understand &quot;humane&quot;  treatment.</div>
