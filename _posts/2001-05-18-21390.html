<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053119133">Ok, this is where I will probably get alot of reply from everyone...<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time convincing my dh that homeschooling is the absolute way<br/>
to go with both our dd&#39;s. This is more of a lifestyle change realization that I<br/>
will work with him on. He&#39;s really worried about having to be the sole&quot;bread<br/>
winner&quot; in our family and having to really adjust to a financial budget.<br/>
Both of us hated school, but never really had any problems until about 4th<br/>
grade. That seemed to be the &quot;burnout&quot; age when school definately became a<br/>
problem. A problem I have, is just like all newcomers to unschooling, I am<br/>
afraid that I will not be able to teach my girls properly. Everyday, I am<br/>
becomming more and more convinced though, that I can do this. I also do not have<br/>
a lot of children in my direct neighborhood that my dd&#39;s play with now, so I am<br/>
worried about socialization. Knowing that if I am not working, I will not be<br/>
able to have my dd&#39;s join ballet, karate, or whatever, because our funds will be<br/>
reduced so much. I already am looking for the village&#39;s &quot;free&quot; stuff for kids,<br/>
but I dont know if that will be enough. The only thing that I know that will<br/>
come out of this, will help with is that my dd&#39;s might learn to get along better<br/>
with each other if they are always together. Currently the older (6) is always<br/>
playing &quot;boss&quot; with the younger (3).<br/>
I get alot of the same questions/comments that I currently have a hard time<br/>
answering since I have not been hs&#39;g yet;<br/>
&quot;What about socialization?&quot; &quot;Your girls are so shy right now, they need the<br/>
stimilization and socialization from others&quot;<br/>
&quot;Everyone goes to school, you did, your husband did, &quot;I&quot; did, and we all did<br/>
fine, why go against the norm&quot; &quot;you do not have a teaching degree, how far do<br/>
you think you teach them, if you do not know all the subjects?&quot; &quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>
worried about college?&quot; (my answer to that has always been no, since I never<br/>
went to college except to take a course one time that I really wanted to learn<br/>
about, and even then, I did not take the licensing exam at the end because I<br/>
realized that subject really sucked and I no longer cared about it)<br/>
Ok, so now I ask for everyone&#39;s help and advise. I&#39;ve never really been a &quot;stand<br/>
up and speak for yourself&quot; type person, always been in the background just<br/>
listening to what everyone says and takes the good & bad with all information<br/>
and sortof just does what it is I really think will work. But this is not just<br/>
my life that I am affecting, its my dh&#39;s and my dd&#39;s.<br/>

you start &quot;showing troubles&quot; and then you can stop drinking it. By<br/>
that time, the damage is done. Personally, I&#39;d avoid the poison and<br/>
I&#39;d avoid public school. I think it poisons children&#39;s minds with the<br/>
concepts that they need someone else to teach them in order to learn,<br/>
that adults can and should control every aspect of their lives, that<br/>
what 30 other children their own age think about their clothes<br/>
matters more than anything else in the world, that what those in<br/>
authority say about an issue is the definitive word, and many more<br/>
things that I really don&#39;t want my kids to learn. If I ever started<br/>
having doubts as to whether or not I should send my kid to PS, I<br/>
would go back and read John Taylor Gatto&#39;s &quot;Six-Lesson Schoolteacher&quot;<br/>
again and again until I stopped :-)  (<br/>

<br/>
The reason kids look forward to going to public school is the<br/>
overwhelming propaganda and cultural machine that makes sure kids get<br/>
excited about it. Maybe you could talk to your daughter about her<br/>
specific concerns - what is it exactly that she wants from school.<br/>
More time with friends? Different crafts and opportunities to learn?<br/>
Riding a bus?? All of these things are things that you can arrange<br/>
for her without also burdening her with school.<br/>
<br/>
For me, school is a place where  the magic that lives inside each<br/>
child is methodically extiguished. I want to keep the magic alive for<br/>
my children as long as they want it to burn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837966857">&quot;What about socialization?&quot; &quot;Your girls are so shy right now, they need the<br/>
stimilization and socialization from others&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote an article for themestream on homeschooling shy children.  It is at<br/>
my website and called &quot;should you home school shy children&quot; if you want to<br/>
read it.  What it pretty much boiled down to for me, is that children do not<br/>
become less shy when they are left in a room full of people.  They need to<br/>
learn confidence first where they feel safe and then they will feel like<br/>
they can open up more with new people.  Putting shy children into the school<br/>
situation often makes them draw more into themselves because they don&#39;t feel<br/>
comfortable.  Don&#39;t send them to school for this reason.  :0(<br/>
<br/>
There are many opportunities for socializing if you look around.  You will<br/>
probably find a whole bunch of people home schooling right near you if you<br/>
find someone to connect you to them.  They are like the underground<br/>
railroad.  You would never know they are there unless you know where to<br/>
look.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyone goes to school, you did, your husband did, &quot;I&quot; did, and we all did<br/>
fine,<br/>
<br/>
It depends on what you consider fine. I got great grades.  I learned how to<br/>
take tests and was very good at it.  I retained only the stuff that<br/>
interested me which is what you children will do whether they go to school<br/>
or are schooled at home.  Unschooling is following their interests so they<br/>
have the greatest chance to retain what they learn as it all interests them.<br/>
Also, It took me over ten years to get back my self esteem that was lost in<br/>
school. It isn&#39;t on my report card, but it is part of me.  I hated all the<br/>
fakeness.  I never felt comfortable being anyone but myself and so I didn&#39;t<br/>
fit in very well.<br/>
<br/>
why go against the norm&quot; &quot;you do not have a teaching degree, how far do<br/>
you think you teach them, if you do not know all the subjects?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heck, if you went to school you should be able to teach them everything you<br/>
learned  :0)  Of course if you didn&#39;t retain it then why are you even<br/>
worried about teaching it to your kids.  What did you learn in school that<br/>
you use every day still?  Could you have learned it another way?  How much<br/>
did you forget and does that effect your life now?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;aren&#39;t you<br/>
worried about college?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If your kids want to go to college, they can find a way.  If they have to<br/>
work at it to go at least they won&#39;t drink themselves silly for the first<br/>
two years.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve never really been a &quot;stand<br/>
up and speak for yourself&quot; type person,<br/>

<br/>
Me too!  I just let my life speak for itself. The only people that I discuss<br/>
unschooling with are the ones who ask and seriously want to know.  The<br/>
others I just blow off.  If they ask how the home schooling is going.  I<br/>
just say &quot;Great!  We love the lifestyle!&quot;  That is all they need to know<br/>
even though I feel somewhat like a liar saying it because we DON&#39;T DO<br/>
SCHOOL!!!!  If you interact with your kids, you will see what their<br/>
interests are and you can help them to find the materials they want to<br/>
further their interests.  I like the word facilitator.  I am my children&#39;s<br/>
facilitator.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138850686">I read lots of books going into homeschooling and unschooling.It seemed to<br/>
give me faith in kids learning. Having dh meet older homeschooled kids can<br/>
be convincing. Do they seem like socially maladjusted individuals who know<br/>
nothing? Usually homeschooled kids don&#39;t. They seem impressive in that they<br/>
are willing to talk to adults and know what their passions are. I get the<br/>
question &quot;Are you going to do this with other people or what?&quot; I feel like<br/>
saying sarcastically,&quot;No, I am planning on sealing him in a mayonnaise jar<br/>
and have no contact with the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Think of schools- they don&#39;t usually allow much interaction between kids.<br/>
Most talking is by the teacher. Friendships can form but bullying happens<br/>
too.Not the most kind and gentle place. Friendships can happen outside of<br/>
school, and it needn&#39;t be expensive ballet classes. Being in the world means<br/>
that children see everyday life and learn to interact with different ages,<br/>
genders, classes, and cultures of people. A family at a homeschool intro<br/>
meeting I went to told about volunteering to teach reading to foreign<br/>
students and that seemed like one example of a wonderful opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
My 4 year old has surpassed my knowledge of lots of things already. It has<br/>
made me get interested and learn about stuff I didn&#39;t know already. No<br/>
teacher can know it all, but a parent can guide a child to find information<br/>
he or she is interested in. Read books, notice passions, get materials. Your<br/>
little ones will learn.<br/>
<br/>
When the material gets too tough, you can learn things together, and you can<br/>
just hand over resources. You can also call on other people to be mentors<br/>
for your kids.<br/>
If they want to learn something, they will. Most kids are curious and want<br/>
to learn, to make sense of the world around them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949384527">Don&#39;t sweat it!  It will come with time and without a lot of effort.<br/>
<br/>
I have health problems that have me pretty close to home bound.  We<br/>
homeschool our 12 yr old son.  As my health has deteriorated over the last<br/>
couple of years, I have worried some about his opportunities to get to know<br/>
people.  You know what?  He is quite friendly and outgoing.  Waves at people<br/>
as we are driving by.  Converses with anyone we meet at the store or other<br/>
outings, etc.  Lack of social skills is NOT a problem!  He is a charming and<br/>
polite boy.  (So far...shhh...13 is just around the corner!  &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Friends and other relationships will develop from your normal every day<br/>
routines...whatever that is!  In your examples, you (and your DD) will get<br/>
to know others at story time or at the park and make friends or at least<br/>
passing acquaintances.<br/>
<br/>
When my DS was younger, he actually met and made a great pal in the line<br/>
waiting to buy stamps at the post office!  He and another boy about his age<br/>
hit it off so well that his mother and I made arrangements to meet again for<br/>
a play date and things went from there.  Turned out to be a good experience.<br/>
What has surprised me over the years is that this was not the only time<br/>
something like this happened.<br/>
<br/>
What thrills me is to watch DS as he interacts with adults or older youth.<br/>
It is wonderful to see that he is able to follow the conversation about many<br/>
varied topics.  He knows how to express interest in subjects other people<br/>
want to share with him and he knows how to share his interests with others.<br/>
<br/>
Being &#39;isolated&#39; has not hurt him.  It has influenced the type of people he<br/>
has interactions with (he may know more about hospitals, doctors, physical<br/>
therapists, chiropractors, or other medical specialties than most boys his<br/>
age, for instance).  But when you stop and think about it, isn&#39;t the life<br/>
experience of every child unique to that child?<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073836185">Excellent points and interaction in a school setting is quickly becoming<br/>
ever less and less.  Many schools have done away with any recess time for<br/>
all but the youngest students.  They are definitely not encouraged to<br/>
interact with each other in class, so where are they going to have all these<br/>
greatly touted socializing opportunities?<br/>
<br/>
(It amazes me that I was actually concerned about this when we began this<br/>
adventure!  I really can relate.  I remember being quite concerned.  Now, I<br/>
