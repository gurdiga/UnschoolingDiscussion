<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203619515">In digest 2186, Sheila asks:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So what would you do with a 5 year old who is asking to learn how to<br/>
&gt;&gt;read?  Would you teach him phonics?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Sheila<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My response:  I hope we hear from others who have suggestions...but this is<br/>
the situation I was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
My short answer is NO, I would try not to TEACH the child anything. I would<br/>
give the child the tools so that he will learn with the least possible<br/>
teaching. You say the child is asking to learn; he is not asking to be<br/>
taught. The difference is significant.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, this child has the motivation -- he&#39;s curious to know what the<br/>
books say. And he has a reason -- he wants to know what the authors are<br/>
talking about.  Now the kid needs only one thing: The HOW...How does reading<br/>
happen? <br/>
<br/>
The hope that many of us have, I&#39;m sure, is that someone has been reading<br/>
stories to this child for several years, so that he knows the joys of<br/>
stories and that it involves turning those marks on the pages into spoken<br/>
sounds, and that a skill is needed. He wants to acquire the skill.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it&#39;s not just books. It&#39;s signs that give helpful instructions<br/>
like STOP and DONT WALK, OPEN AT 9am, CLOSED,  or MARKET or PARKING ON<br/>
WEEKDAYS ONLY, POISON, EXIT,  FAMILY PLANNING: ENTRANCE IN REAR, etc.<br/>
<br/>
(My wish is that the child will not be told that reading happens by magic,<br/>
even though learning can be said to be magical at any level. Skill is<br/>
needed.)           <br/>
<br/>
If the child knows that the print needs to be deciphered (decoded) in order<br/>
to turn it into familiar sounds, you&#39;re halfway home. If the child already<br/>
knows the alphabet, and/or knows that letters have distinct sounds (has<br/>
phonemic awareness), most of the problem is already solved...he is<br/>
definitely ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is to determine what the child already knows and try to help<br/>
him build on that. One way to find out is to get a copy of Cat In the Hat<br/>
(or something similar with simple regular words...there are hundreds of such<br/>
children&#39;s books) and read it out loud, slowly of course, while he looks at<br/>
the pages. Point to the words as you read them. If, while you&#39;re reading,<br/>
the child says, &quot;I get it. I can read it now,&quot;  then you&#39;ve done your job<br/>
for now. <br/>
<br/>
The breakthrough to reading by a child might be surprisingly quick. That<br/>
depends on readiness, motivation, and other factors. If the child is<br/>
confident enough of his/her new skill to try to read other books by<br/>
him/herself, you can relax even more...s/he&#39;s on the way. Often, children<br/>
like to read a familiar book many times over. It seems to give them<br/>
confidence in their skills as they gain them.<br/>
<br/>
Reading different books helps children learn more words as they progress,<br/>
and requires them to test their skill at decoding unfamiliar words on their<br/>
own,  but when s/he asks you what a new word is, it&#39;s probably best simply<br/>
to read the word and let him/her continue (instead of asking him/her to<br/>
sound it out for you.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is for the child to be able to recognize that the letters (for<br/>
example, C-A-T) have distinct sounds that make up the words.<br/>
<br/>
There might be questions about capital letters and lower case letters that<br/>
you might need to answer, but I would advise against turning a child&#39;s<br/>
questions into teaching sessions. My son&#39;s favorite saying was from<br/>
Churchill who said, I love to learn but I hate being taught. Who doesn&#39;t?<br/>
...well, not everyone hates it, especially when we&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
A curious note: I once read an interview (or was it on the radio?) given by<br/>
Dr. Seuss. In it, he said that his publisher requested that his book, Cat In<br/>
The Hat, and several others, contain words that used the most basic<br/>
principles of phonics, and the publisher gave Seuss an actual list of words<br/>
that were to be included.<br/>
<br/>
When Dr. Seuss (not his real name) was given his honorary degree (Doctor of<br/>
Letters) from Harvard, he announced that he could now call himself, Dr. Dr.<br/>
Seuss.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I liked so many things in this post, but this is the kind of statement that <br/>
just doesn&#39;t read true for me. And I&#39;m afraid it will scare some parents <br/>
whose kids don&#39;t respond to phonics like this. It makes me think that <br/>
parents are going to think something is wrong if their child knows these <br/>
phonetical connections but is still not reading. Is not ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
Casey knew her alphabet by 18 months of age. No kidding. She knew the sounds <br/>
that letters made by 3. No kidding. She was a writer (at 3) and asked me to <br/>
spell things for her by giving her the letter sound instead of the letter <br/>
name. So she definitely had the connection between printed letters, their <br/>
sounds and words. She was NOT however ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
She tried on and off to start reading. She really wanted to be like her <br/>
older brother. She was a fabulous and independent writer. She is very <br/>
bright. She was still NOT ready to read. Whatever else needed to happen for <br/>
her, besides a phonics awareness, had not happened yet.<br/>
<br/>
I think she had many sight words by 4 and 5, but wasn&#39;t able to sound out <br/>
c-a-t until later. She&#39;s 8 now and reading fluently. She still uses all the <br/>
options for new words available to her. She sounds out, guesses within <br/>
context, uses picture clues or asks. It all counts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The breakthrough to reading by a child might be surprisingly quick.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or it might be surprisingly slow. There is no way I would have predicted how <br/>
long it would take Casey to get it all. If she had been 6 when she first <br/>
understood the letter/sound connection, and then took 4 or 5 years to become <br/>
a reader, I might have worried that something was wrong. Then she would be a <br/>
&quot;late&quot; reader. I think everyone out there needs to understand that kids <br/>
develop when and how they develop. For each child, the reading process will <br/>
be unique. It may follow a typical pattern but at a very different rate. Or <br/>
it may be, as you say, surpisingly quick, seemingly skipping over all the <br/>
typical steps.<br/>

Kirby too.  Very precocious with basic &quot;phonics&quot; (because of plastic letters, <br/>
songs, Sesame Street and other games and toys).<br/>

He didn&#39;t read until he was nearly nine.  And he learned to read Nintendo <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Will, too!  And Will, neither.  As I said, he became a fluent reader at 7.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been cleaning stuff out and found a bunch of the books he wrote and <br/>
drawings he made during his &quot;Arkansas period&quot;.  Sometimes it&#39;s my <br/>
handwriting in the books, but the stories are really good.  During that <br/>
time, when he was 3, he learned how to read and write 2 words:  Will, <br/>
and the name of his best friend, Grady.  Will and Grady figure greatly <br/>
in those books.  :)<br/>

&quot;THE LTL GRL&quot;.) She wrote 5 or 6 of them in a row when she was 5. The little <br/>
girl was usually walking in the forest or making friends with small animals. <br/>
But one time the little girl got in a big time fight with her mom. :-/ Casey <br/>
swears it has nothing to do with *her* mom. ;-) In later, more sophisticated <br/>
versions of her stories, the little girl got a name (Gabrielle) and met up <br/>
with this way cool alien that morphs into a rabbit and takes her into space.<br/>
