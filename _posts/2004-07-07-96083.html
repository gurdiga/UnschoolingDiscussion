<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114558305">I used to think unschooling meant unit studies and following a child&#39;s interests, <br/>

interests, I sometimes find myself evaluating their choices instead of looking at my child - <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve learned that knowing my child as he is, is more important than shaping him into <br/>
someone I think he ought to be.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, I&#39;m still nervous about things like times tables, basic math operations, and <br/>
handwriting for one of my children (10 years old). He still doesn&#39;t show interest in basic <br/>
math (even though we&#39;ve done games and tricks to make it more tantalizing) and his <br/>
handwriting has deteriorated (he doesn&#39;t remember which way &#39;d&#39;s and &#39;b&#39;s go or 9s and 6s <br/>
etc.) The basics that most school teachers look for aren&#39;t there. He does read, though.<br/>
<br/>
Otoh, he&#39;s memorized four poems by Robert Browning just because he likes them, he&#39;s <br/>
played hundreds of hours of Star Craft (both on his own and online), loves to be read to, <br/>
plays lacrosse, now enjoys his first dog and is an avid bird watcher. He&#39;s also much more <br/>
helpful around the house since we let go of the schedule to make it happen. And I&#39;m <br/>
continually surprised by what he does know just from listening to our family <br/>
conversations, movie watching and gaming.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s truly a great kid. I don&#39;t doubt he&#39;s learning. But the truth is, I do worry that he may <br/>
not learn some of these essentials. And I don&#39;t know how to represent his learning to our <br/>
year end evaluator given that he has nothing written to show for this year.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts to help me?<br/>

That&#39;s really young.  Few kids that age have really great handwriting.<br/>

That&#39;s the big one for us.  The knowledge taken in effortlessly from a big <br/>
life.<br/>

<br/>
Are you in contact with locals in your area?  See what they do that&#39;s <br/>
sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
Does his list need to be in handwriting?  Why not computer/printed?<br/>

necessary part of existing on this planet, then he will come up on it again<br/>
and again..<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions for evaluator:<br/>
<br/>
Take lots and lots of pictures, tape your son reciting a poem, take an<br/>
&quot;educational view&quot; of your child&#39;s games and make a note of the skills he is<br/>
using while playing those games,  .....basically, instead of trying to fit<br/>
what your child is doing into some kind of pre-conceived format for an<br/>
evaluator, look at what your son is doing and ask yourself how those things<br/>
can be recorded.<br/>
