<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867288892">Hello all....<br/>
I have a question I hope someone can help me with.   Another <br/>
homeschooler keeps calling me to get together.  She just started a <br/>
home school support group in this area and has 20 mothers signed <br/>
up.  That&#39;s all fine and dandy even if I personally am not a meeting <br/>
person and know for a fact that this woman just doesn&#39;t <br/>
&quot;get&quot; unschooling. No matter how many times I have informed her I am <br/>
an unschooler, she asks me the same thing every time she ends up <br/>
conversing with me &quot;what curriculum do you use?&quot;  Anyway, I just <br/>
found out that at the next meeting she is bring someone in from the <br/>
Home School Legal Defense organization and reccomending that <br/>
everyone join.  When she called me (since I didn&#39;t go to their last <br/>
meeting) and asked me if I belonged I said no, and that I never <br/>
would.  Well, she pushed and pushed and I didn&#39;t have a definitive <br/>
answer as to why not, and wondered if any of you can lead me to some <br/>
good articles on this subject.  I used to be like that with <br/>
immunizations, I knew I didn&#39;t want them but not exactly why.  Now I <br/>
know exactly why and my doctor didn&#39;t hassle me because I knew <br/>
exactly why.  I want to be very sure on this subject so I can <br/>
explain it to this woman and get her off my back.....  :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46619188">Why I haven&#39;t joined hslda<br/>
<br/>
Because I don&#39;t need to or want to.<br/>
Real simple...<br/>
<br/>
but why do you feel compelled  to give an answer?  I can understand re the doctor.  S/he will be treating your kids and you want someone who isn&#39;t going to make trouble for you.  If s/he knows that you understand the reprecussions of your decision, if s/he feels you aren&#39;t just making the decision because it is the current fad, then you don&#39;t have an adversary, you have an advocate...or you find yourself another doctor!  <br/>
<br/>
But what business is it of hers what org. you belong to?  Let&#39;s say I started a club for people with left-handed children, and you had a left handed children but really didn&#39;t care to join the club...why would you need to give reasons?  Isn&#39;t it enough that you don&#39;t want to?  This isn&#39;t a matter of health, it is a matter of desire.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t owe the woman any type of explanation...<br/>
<br/>
Why not say: because I don&#39;t want to.  Why are you so interested? Maybe then she&#39;ll clue you into why she cares so much.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can be silly: maybe  act real mysterious and say something like: They told me not to! and when she says who, just go They did! soto voice, all the while looking around in a spooked sort of way...<br/>
<br/>
As far as the curriculm goes tell her your children wrote it.  It costs $550 for the first child, and $350 for each additonal child.  Does she want to buy it?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, just mho.  Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329502099">&lt;&lt;I want to be very sure on this subject so I can <br/>
explain it to this woman and get her off my back.....  :o)<br/>
Mary&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t work!!<br/>
<br/>
This person is well-meaning, but close-minded, rude and controlling.<br/>
Sounds just like some of the school administrators folks have had to<br/>
deal with! You do **not** have to explain yourself to anyone so wholly<br/>
unconnected with you and your family. (shades of Eliza Bennett)<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing that you are not feeling feisty towards this person, but<br/>
are feeling wearied. It seems like she is asking &quot;why&quot; not out of a<br/>
desire to learn a new philosophy (as the people on this list do) but<br/>
rather to gain ammunition for her argument. <br/>
<br/>
My solution to this type of thing is refusal to engage. Firstly I check<br/>
the caller ID on my phone and don&#39;t feel compelled to answer the phone.<br/>
Then, if I have answered the phone, I would try &quot;I&#39;m glad that works for<br/>
you&quot; and then stop, not referring to my reasons at all. Stopping is the<br/>
hardest part. Sometimes I have to just say, &quot;Oh I have to go now, Jayn<br/>
needs me. Bye&quot;, if I wish to avoid the stress of an argument. (Usually<br/>
it is my mother on the other end of the line, launching into a criticism<br/>
of my husband - harder to avoid than a stranger). If you meet up with<br/>
her and she says she left a message-didn&#39;t you get it, don&#39;t get on the<br/>
defensive. Try &quot;Oh did you&quot;. You don&#39;t have to disclose that you deleted<br/>
it unheard, muttering expletives to yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Someone once said,<br/>
&quot;A man convinced against his will,<br/>
Is of his own opinion still&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This person seems like she is enthusiastic and &quot;believes in&quot; HSLDA. You<br/>
won&#39;t change her mind regardless of how lucid your arguments may be. She<br/>
will see your demur as an attack on her choices. She will not stop<br/>
harassing you while you give her an opening because she will believe she<br/>
is helping you. The only way for tranquility that I have found is not to<br/>
engage her at all on the contested topic. <br/>
<br/>
The doctor is a different situation, providing a service that you pay<br/>
for, and the choice for her/him could be to lose your business<br/>
altogether, plus the doc has hundreds of patients to worry about. This<br/>
other woman is on a mission, and you are one of only 21 for her focused<br/>
attention. I bet she does school-at-home too. ;D<br/>
<br/>
I guess the gist of my suggestion is **you** can choose the type of<br/>
interaction you have with her, just as you have evidently made the<br/>
choice not to attend her meetings. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is exactly the kind of situation that can happen when I would use my <br/>
infamous and possibly rude comment of &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br/>
You will learn very quickly why she is asking, to learn or to argue. If she <br/>
says that you should join then ask her why, if she says how great it is then <br/>
ask her why. I would turn it around quickly and let her be put on the spot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-521650645">Good one Rachel Ann!  I don&#39;t understand why everyone thinks its their business to worry about other peoples lives. Have you asked her why she is a member? Just a thought.   I would love it if someone asked &quot;are you enjoying homeschooling?&quot;  or &quot;are your children happy?&quot;  That would be nice.  <br/>
I know I told my dh last night that I don&#39;t remember ever being this happy.  I feel so fortunate to have found unschooling.  And my kids are soooo happy!I love that cheesy face!<br/>

If all of us here refused to engage, a lot of information would NOT be<br/>

.... Never trying is never knowing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion about disengaging was because Mary&#39;s (it was Mary wasn&#39;t<br/>
it?) stated issue was how to get the woman &quot;off her back&quot;, not &quot;how do I<br/>
help my friend see the negatives of HSLDA?&quot; My reply was not about HSLDA<br/>
specifically, but about how to lessen the intrusion into Mary&#39;s life of<br/>
a person who demonstrably, according to the original post, (1) does not<br/>
listen, and (2) is annoying her. <br/>
<br/>
Since unschooling is about giving the information that is asked for,<br/>
rather than imposing information on an unwilling victim, I am sure<br/>
no-one on this list would be advocating not answering genuine questions<br/>
if we have knowledge to share. That was not my intention at any rate.<br/>
<br/>
Only Mary can be the judge of the receptiveness of this woman (I feel<br/>
like calling her Madam X or something) from their previous interactions.<br/>
Other than that she could choose to be a &quot;subversive&quot; influence by<br/>
distributing the HSLDA information gleaned from these websites to the<br/>
other 20 families. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be as simple as saying to her, &quot;These websites helped me<br/>
make my decision.&quot; Notice the finality of the past tense. Or maybe that<br/>
would let Mary in for a lengthy dissertation on the problems of<br/>
discerning veracity from internet sites. How much energy does Mary want<br/>
to expend in this direction? I don&#39;t know, but I bet Mary has a very<br/>
clear idea.<br/>

page. (It&#39;s subtitled: Do You Know All You Need to Know in Order to Decide<br/>
Whether it is in Your Best Interest to Join?) But in case it doesn&#39;t, here&#39;s<br/>
a direct link:<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t know all the ins and outs, but it&#39;s possible that if your<br/>
acquiantence can get enough people together to join as a group, then the<br/>
rate that she personally pays (and you and the other members pay) may be <br/>
less. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then she would have said that.<br/>
<br/>
I think if one person gets lots of others to join maybe theirs is discounted <br/>
or free.<br/>
<br/>
I vaguely remember hearing that many years ago.</div>

&lt;&lt; Maybe it would be as simple as saying to her, &quot;These websites helped me<br/>
make my decision.&quot; Notice the finality of the past tense.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like that one!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277919489">Sandra or anyone else who might know,<br/>
I am just now learning about all these things that your below links involved.<br/>
Have the Seelhoffs began publishing again? I checked their Gentle Spirit and it was last updated &#39;91.  Do you know what has become of them recently?<br/>
I am just appalled at these stories.  I can&#39;t believe that people can actually claim to be Christian and then be such vindictive people!<br/>
I think the Seelhoffs could make a movie and never have to worry about finances again!  Maybe they already did OK with their settlement.<br/>
All I know is that its pretty unbelievable!!<br/>
Sitting in disbelief,<br/>

then she&#39;ll clue you into why she cares so much.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Most of us know why she cares so much.  What SHE doesn&#39;t know is why anyone <br/>
would decline to join.<br/>
<br/>
Information is power.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It seems like she is asking &quot;why&quot; not out of a<br/>
desire to learn a new philosophy (as the people on this list do) but<br/>
rather to gain ammunition for her argument.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would give her reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Those who DO subscribe to HSLDA seem to do so without checking past the sales <br/>
pitch they&#39;re given.  Those who do look further are usually shocked.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My solution to this type of thing is refusal to engage. Firstly I check<br/>
the caller ID on my phone and don&#39;t feel compelled to answer the phone.<br/>
Then, if I have answered the phone, I would try &quot;I&#39;m glad that works for<br/>
you&quot; and then stop, not referring to my reasons at all.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How do others learn more without input?<br/>
If all of us here refused to engage, a lot of information would NOT be being <br/>
shared.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This person seems like she is enthusiastic and &quot;believes in&quot; HSLDA. You<br/>
won&#39;t change her mind regardless of how lucid your arguments may be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Never trying is never knowing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here who isn&#39;t sure why it IS worth answering questions about HSLDA <br/>
should look at one or more of these links:<br/>

Cheryl published several more issues after the settlement, but the magazine <br/>
folded gracefully the second time.   There is a discussion forum online, <br/>
still, I believe.<br/>
