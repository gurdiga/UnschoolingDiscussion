<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086405936">Okay.  I know that this topic has been sort of discussed to death, and I&#39;m <br/>
sorry if my particular question has already addressed.  I have been trying to <br/>
read all of the posts on the subject (and there are many...LOL) and I am <br/>
wondering where some of you stand on the sexual content of so many shows and <br/>
movies.  My son is 11.  I, personally, do not have a problem with the violent <br/>
aspect because my son is pretty clear on his comfort level.  The same is true <br/>
of really emotional stuff (death of a parent, friend, pet...stuff like that). <br/>
 The trouble is that there are so many shows and movies that I know he would <br/>
love (for their other content...like magic, adventure, etc.) but sometimes <br/>
the sexual content is almost pornographic (okay, I&#39;m exaggerating here, <br/>
LOL... I just find it beyond my comfort level.)  Not just people in bed <br/>
together where it is implied that there has been sex (which is how it was <br/>
when I was growing up.  Most of it went over my head. LOL).  Should I let his <br/>
comfort level be our guide in these cases too?  If so, how?  I really <br/>
struggle with this, because I feel like I go way overboard with this aspect <br/>
of TV restriction.  Still, there are some things that I feel are not good for <br/>
him to be exposed to.  Do most of you just skip the show when this is the <br/>
case?  Do you let your children be the judge?  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343688754">I guess I&#39;m backwards from a lot of people.  It shocks me that so many<br/>
people say they don&#39;t have a problem with violence but they have a<br/>
problem with sex.  I mean, violence is people hurting each other, and<br/>
sex is people loving each other.  If I was going to censor one and keep<br/>
the other, I&#39;d definitely censor the violence and keep the sex.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742069030">Graphic violent sex is not appreciated by my kids - they prefer that I <br/>
let them know that I think they&#39;ll not be happy to have watched it. And <br/>
I prefer that too.<br/>
<br/>
Funny sex, loving sex - even if pretty graphic - is okay with us.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lot more likely to warn them about gory violence or super super <br/>
sad stuff. Or jump-out-and-startle-you kinds of scary movies - those <br/>
they don&#39;t much like.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are now 12, 15, and 18 -- but this was true when they were <br/>
younger, too.<br/>

Two of Holly&#39;s favorite shows these days are Dharma and Greg and Friends.<br/>
<br/>
Both discuss sex a lot.  Many jokes abot sex.  Some she gets, and some she <br/>
doesn&#39;t, but when it&#39;s handled lightly that way it doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
Dharma and Greg is about the sex lives of married couples--the conservative <br/>
parents who rarely have sex, the hippy parents who ALWAYS have sex, the main <br/>
couple, and the crazed Jane and Pete.<br/>
<br/>
Friends is more about unmarried sex.  I just blame that on New York.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If I were homeschooling because of being fundamentalist Christians those <br/>
shows would both be really offensive to me, I&#39;m sure.  And I would shame <br/>
Holly for even WANTING to watch them.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not a fundamentalist Christian, and I don&#39;t want to shame Holly.<br/>
<br/>
For all we know she will become the world&#39;s greatest sex therapist or <br/>
relationships counsellor and what she&#39;s watching and thinking right now is <br/>
better preparation for her future than anything else on the earth we could <br/>
do.  Or maybe she&#39;s just interested in the outfits and interior decoration.   <br/>
I don&#39;t know, but it doesn&#39;t matter, either.<br/>
<br/>
And my other question is on WHAT shows is there graphic sex?  I don&#39;t see <br/>
much or any on TV (but we don&#39;t have cable, either). <br/>
<br/>
I rented &quot;Unfaithful&quot; to watch myself, and I did warn Holly away from it.  I <br/>
paused it when she passed through.  I failed to notice Marty walking up <br/>
behind me once during a particularly rough and dirty moment, but he&#39;s also 14 <br/>
and mostly probably wondered why I&#39;d be interested in that story.  But it&#39;s a <br/>
pretty wonderful movie, just not something kids can really even begin to <br/>
understand, since it has so deeply to do with relationships they haven&#39;t <br/>
begun to have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497273266">On cable channels, there is graphic explicit pornographic sex going on.  And Howard STern is the king of it all.<br/>
<br/>
On one show, he had 2 naked girls, and a group of men playing &quot;anal ring toss&quot;.  I won&#39;t go into describing how it was accomplished.  It was on bec, dh was flipping through channels and he gets a kick out of howard stern, but even he couldn&#39;t believe this one.<br/>
<br/>
I found it very disturbing.<br/>
<br/>
There is another show called &quot;Real Sex&quot; and they showed how they make molds of &quot;private parts&quot; for use by those who want them.  I don&#39;t care that those molds exist, but I didn&#39;t really need to SEE how they were made.<br/>
<br/>
So, I do get a little concerned over what my kids might be stumbling across when they stay up later than I do.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Still, there are some things that I feel are not good for  him to be<br/>
exposed to.  Do most of you just skip the show when this is the case?  Do<br/>
you let your children be the judge?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess I really don&#39;t have much of an answer for you but I do know<br/>
what you mean. We have cable here so when someone mentioned Howard Stern and<br/>
Real Sex, we get all that here. Howard Stern is always shadowed out so I<br/>
think the kids would be past it without realizing what&#39;s going on. Real Sex<br/>
is nudity in all it&#39;s glory.<br/>
<br/>
My 3 youngest right now aren&#39;t even interested in that kind of stuff.<br/>
Certain love scenes make them uncomfortable enough now to not want to watch.<br/>
We respect that. I&#39;m not exactly sure when that will change. If we are<br/>
watching something now with more than just nudity in it, like a Real Sex<br/>
thing, I will change the channel if the kids come into the room. But<br/>
thinking about my oldest, who is 17 now, I never restricted her tv. She<br/>
always had a tv in her room. Something the others don&#39;t have. We&#39;ve always<br/>
had cable. She was free to find them if she was looking and probably come<br/>
upon them by accident. I guess I just trusted that she would ask me if<br/>
something came up she was curious about. I never really thought about it. I<br/>
do remember my husband commenting that maybe at 2 in the morning, she might<br/>
be watching something &quot;not appropriate.&quot; I just never thought it was a<br/>
problem. We were always pretty open with Tara. And she was/is a school kid,<br/>
so I would think that might make matters worse.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to ask her when she comes home if she ever went hunting. Now I&#39;m<br/>
curious.<br/>

I would think the show that we watch which has the most sex is Buffy: the<br/>
Vampire Slayer.  Lots of &quot;comic book&quot; violence, but also some real emotional<br/>
things about violence.  It also has lots of sex and sex talk.  These are<br/>
teen to twentysomethings discovering themselves and love in what is<br/>
basically a war zone.  Buffy&#39;s most recent relationship (with a vampire no<br/>
less) had a fair bit of S&M references, lots of skin (mostly his  YUMMY!!!)<br/>
and some scenes of public (although very subtle) sex.  I&#39;m frequently AMAZED<br/>
at what they get past the censors.  I think we&#39;ve seen everything on Spike<br/>
except his actual plumbing and bum.  (For which I personally am thankful.<br/>
Can you tell I fancy the man??)<br/>
<br/>
There is NO way my seven year old caught most of that.  He gets that Buffy<br/>
and Spike have a complicated relationship and aren&#39;t sure how they feel<br/>
about each other, but the rest???<br/>
<br/>
Of course, he&#39;s also used to seeing his dad and I hugging while naked (no<br/>
nudity issues in this house) and kissing in front of him.  We keep anything<br/>
else private, but aren&#39;t afraid of showing physical affection.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054450599">When Tara came home last night I asked her about the tv restriction thing. I just asked her if she ever remembers searching for or finding shows on cable that were sexually intense. (like that phrase?) She said she never went looking for them. When she was younger, they were icky. When she was older, she just didn&#39;t have the curiosity or taboo that her friends did. She knew they were there because she would come upon them every once in awhile, but never really went looking or sat and watched for long. She says she remembers watching older soap opera kind of shows. Not sure what she meant but it was implied sex and more talk than action. She liked those as she matured.<br/>
<br/>
I must say I was a little surprised by the answer. I thought maybe she would tell me she would sneak at night to see something. Then again, what was to sneak if it was always there!!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a good point.  Shows like Howard Stern wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
tantalizing or whatever they&#39;re supposed to be if our culture had a<br/>
healthy view of sexuality.  I&#39;ve watched Howard Stern, and his whole<br/>
show is built around, &quot;This is bad, this is dirty, look how sinful we<br/>
are.&quot;  I want to tell him, &quot;It&#39;s just the human body.  Get over it.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I mean, can you imagine other animals wearing clothes, and then prancing<br/>
around taking them off to shock each other? It&#39;s silly.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s as silly as a homeschooling book I read once that said we should<br/>
expose children to art, but to go through the art books ahead of time<br/>
and put black marker over the &quot;dirty&quot; parts.  If we&#39;re going to censor<br/>
sexuality, let&#39;s not have flowers around.  I mean, they put their sexual<br/>
parts all out in the open and give off an aroma to draw everyone to<br/>
them!  It&#39;s scandalous!  Have they no shame?!<br/>

foreplay.<br/>

is rarely without his.  I find it interesting that he bought an old Pokemon<br/>
