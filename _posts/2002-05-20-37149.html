me to be any improvement if you care about real learning. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I worked for the charter school for homeschoolers I (briefly, until<br/>
I could unload them) had a group of Waldorf families. This is *exactly*<br/>
how they did numbers, at least for the primary-aged kids. They all had<br/>
personalities... and the &quot;four processes&quot; (addition, subtraction,<br/>
multiplication, and division) were all characters, gnomes or kings or<br/>
something (or maybe it was King Equals), and they would act out various<br/>
arithmetical equations with acorns or rocks or glass &quot;jewels&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I was not impressed, but then, I&#39;ve not been impressed by much of<br/>
anythuing from the land of Waldorfia<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005544995">I&#39;m constantly on a rant that Americans can&#39;t do math. It&#39;s everywhere <br/>
and most folks just tune it out or chalk it up as something mysterious. <br/>
Math is so totally cool all by itself, if someone needs to dress it up, <br/>
then they don&#39;t get it, imho.<br/>
<br/>
My 8yo started out using a math text. When she was six she got a <br/>
different answer than the workbook. She explained to me why her answer <br/>
made sense. She was right - the question was so poorly explained, that <br/>
her answer was more logical. (the diagram didn&#39;t match the question, and <br/>
she answered by the diagram.)  We stopped using that book. She still <br/>
likes math books, but we use them as a jumping off point, or to check <br/>
things. The more we use math, the better she likes it and the more <br/>
interesting it gets. Math is fun, and it isn&#39;t mysterious, and it&#39;s <br/>
everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Too many of us parents were both bored to tears and terrorized by math <br/>
in school, that we think we can&#39;t do it. We can, btw, we use it all the <br/>
time -- when we cook, go shopping, paint a room, pay our bills, watch <br/>
sports, do crafts, in music, and all sorts of places.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t calm down -- keep yelling. :-)  People need to get it -- anyone <br/>
can do math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-291547174">oh i almost forgot a website i found that explains a lot of the math &quot;rules&quot; <br/>
that have us puzzled and we discussed here.....i haven&#39;t read any of it but <br/>
it sounded like the examples given on this list......apologies if it is not <br/>
helpful for unschooling, you decide :0)<br/>
