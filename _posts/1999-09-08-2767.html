<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036917228">The following is an actual question given on a Texas A&M chemistry<br/>
midterm:<br/>
&quot;Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?<br/>
Support your answer with a proof.&quot;  Most of the students wrote<br/>
proofs of their beliefs using Boyle&#39;s Law (gas cools off when it<br/>
expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant.<br/>
One student, however, wrote the following:<br/>
<br/>
==========================================<br/>
<br/>
First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.<br/>
So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and<br/>
 the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that<br/>
 once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls<br/>
 are leaving.<br/>
<br/>
As for how many souls are entering Hell, let&#39;s look at the<br/>
different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these<br/>
religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you<br/>
 will go to Hell.  Since there are more than one of these religions<br/>
 and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can<br/>
 project that all people and all souls go to Hell.<br/>
<br/>
 With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of<br/>
 souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate<br/>
 of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle&#39;s Law states that in<br/>
 order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same,<br/>
 the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives<br/>
 two possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
 (1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which<br/>
  souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will<br/>
  increase until all Hell breaks loose.<br/>
<br/>
 (2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the<br/>
  increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will<br/>
  drop until Hell freezes over.<br/>
<br/>
 So which is it?<br/>
<br/>
 If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Sheryl Atkinson<br/>
 during my Freshman year, &quot;That it will be a cold night in Hell<br/>
 before I sleep with you,&quot; and take into account the fact that I<br/>
 still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her,<br/>
 then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-387364666">Thanks D.J. I saw this about 2 years ago in &#39;Peasants at Heart&#39; (I think the<br/>
name was), a tiny newsletter for homesteader types way over here in New<br/>
Zealand!  I don&#39;t know if the bit about it being &#39;an actual question given<br/>
on a Texas A&M chemistry midterm&#39; is true but I enjoyed rereading it just as<br/>
much as I did the first time. :-)  So even if we disagree on some things, we<br/>
can enjoy a shared sense of humour!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290349198">I am glad you enjoyed the tretise on whether hell is exothermic or<br/>
endothermic.  I thought it was brilliantly written and wondered myself<br/>
that an Aggie (an A&M student) could write such a thing.  It was pretty<br/>
funny, whoever wrote it.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that we differ much, Carol.  Good luck.  Glad to be a part of<br/>
this list.<br/>
