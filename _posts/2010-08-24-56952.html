<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387351163">ANYONE sending any link to this list should write something about why  <br/>
they&#39;re sending it.  Otherwise it looks like spam.<br/>
Moderators might just delete the post without opening the link  <br/>
(probably will), and if I&#39;m the moderator who comes by it first, I&#39;ll  <br/>
put the poster on moderation.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s an honest non-Spam &quot;amazing resource,&quot; talk about it in light  <br/>
of unschooling or don&#39;t send it at all, please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394281804">Here&#39;s what I thought... It&#39;s funny how people are criticizing Sal Khan&#39;s<br/>
wonderful free resource. Their thing is to bicker about whether it&#39;s a<br/>
library or a learning resource. It&#39;s past time for better ideas about how<br/>
children learn best. When they&#39;re interested. When they have a need or<br/>
desire for the information, there is now free access to information. That&#39;s<br/>
a good thing! I love Khan&#39;s YouTube channel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677745296">Another great free resource is MIT&#39;s opencourseware site. We arent schoolish a bit, but this is a great site for all kinds of various info. on all kinds of topics.  Its nice to have access to college course material, from home for free.  <br/>

<br/>
I ran across the story about his academy, and wanted to share with a group of people I thought would find it valuable.  Unschoolers are the only people I know, as a group, who would find non-credit information like this valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I will elaborate.<br/>

Sure, but there was nothing in the URL that indicated that it led to  <br/>
anything about advanced math or science.<br/>
<br/>
People need to know what a link is going to be before they click it,  <br/>
and have enough information to know whether it&#39;s worth their time and  <br/>
interest.<br/>
