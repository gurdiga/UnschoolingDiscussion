But what do I do when they complain that the topics<br/>
did not come into completion in their minds?  This drives me NUTS!  I put a<br/>
lot of effort into doing what we do do  together.  Then to find she feels<br/>
like there are too many loose ends is frustrating.  Perhaps this is a<br/>
symptom of deschooling we are working through.  But it has driven me this<br/>
year to take on more indepth unit studies - we kind of go with the flow, I<br/>
don&#39;t plan much out, but I gather massive amounts of info on one topic -<br/>
oceans is the biggie right now - and we go and go and go as along as they<br/>
are interested.  Then I push a little to completion - to draw it all<br/>
together if you will.  Trying to end the loose string effect for dd.<br/>
-------------<br/>
IMHO, if unschooled learners has loose strings in their minds, the<br/>
strings belong to them.  One of the reasons we unschool is because<br/>
I would get really irritated when I put alot of time and effort into a<br/>
project/unit study/whatever and they lost interest before I was through<br/>
giving them the knowledge of my efforts.  Clearly, my problem.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter feels there are loose ends let her tie them together. She<br/>
will if it&#39;s important to her.  Otherwise, she&#39;s a passive learner waiting<br/>
for you to tie things up - like someone would for her in school.  I would<br/>
just ask her what else she wants to know and where she thinks she could find<br/>
the answers to her questions.  Then turn it over to her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Becky, thanks so much.  I&#39;m going to try this.  Between this and the new<br/>
&#39;schedule&#39; thing she is going through I do feel she is comparing her 4<br/>
years of ps to the hsing experience she is having.  She is really into<br/>
getting her work &#39;done&#39; and I suspect that is also a throw back from<br/>
school.  Unfortunately the 6 yog is also attempting this same scenario -<br/>
trying to be like big sister I suppose as she has never been to ps.  Becky,<br/>
did we figure out where each other live?  Any chance of meeting at a park<br/>
or something?<br/>
<br/>
I guess this brings me to the point of asking if there are other<br/>
unschoolers out there that had kids in ps?  I&#39;m the only one in my support<br/>
group out here and there is not a lot they seem to be able to tell me in<br/>
overcoming these challenges.  I want to get rid of the I want to get &#39;done&#39;<br/>
syndrome as well as that rotten schedule - uck!  She is a great kid but<br/>
does want to be told what to learn and how to learn it.  She has only been<br/>
out of ps 1 year so perhaps I&#39;m expecting a bit too much just yet.  Hmmmmm,<br/>
so much to unravel.  :o)<br/>
