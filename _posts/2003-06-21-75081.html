  I have a few acquaintances who have PhD&#39;s. It&#39;s pretty interesting to<br/>
  listen to them sometimes. Sometimes though they get into these<br/>
  conversations where they seem to be trying to prove how smart they are.<br/>
  They talk in big words and such. Being the smart alec I am I often stop<br/>
  them and ask them what the heck this or that means - and the one thing<br/>
  I&#39;ve found is sometimes they&#39;re full of it! They make up words and BS<br/>
  their way through many many conversations! I don&#39;t suppose all PhD&#39;s are<br/>
  like that - but it&#39;s fun to run into the ones who are and to blow up<br/>
  their persona of genius they&#39;re trying to portray.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; Your friend is full of stereotypes, isn&#39;t he?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  But he has a PhD so he Must Be Right.<br/>
