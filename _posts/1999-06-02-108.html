&gt;Ah, the one that says treat folks like you would like to be treated. ;)  I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t know about you all, but I don&#39;t have time for those things. :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I definately concur, and can say, from first hand experience that it is no<br/>
fun to be on the recieving end of other people&#39;s skewed ideas and misplaced<br/>
anger!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Onelist has a great number of accessories we can use.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So how do we access these, or make use of them for a comprehensive member<br/>
listing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Matter of fact I spent 8 days of May in ABQ New Mexico <br/>

&gt;living wonderful, full, productive lives who have not one factiod about <br/>
&gt;chemistry stored in their brain..... that is stored as *chemistry* .  :) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did warn you that you would have to translate my list of what I think<br/>
constitutes a &quot;good education.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;&lt;They should have a pretty good<br/>
&gt; idea what the history of our Nation and the world are, both celebrated and<br/>
&gt; shameful events/circumstances. They should understand how ours, and maybe<br/>
&gt; some other major political systems operate, and their place in them. They<br/>
&gt; will need a woking knowledge of computers and their trappings as well.  A<br/>
&gt; thorough education should also include an appreciation of, and perhaps<br/>
&gt; experience creating, the fine arts, a healthy dose of multi-cultural<br/>
&gt; experiences and some theology. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would agree that these things are important, but I&#39;m not sure that each<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;every person needs to touch on these things in order to be *educated*.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;.  Also remember, this is the<br/>
&gt; opinion of a single, fallible individual, and I may be leaving something<br/>
&gt; out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We all leave something out!! I have no interest in knowing so many things.  <br/>
&gt;Ancient Chinese History just holds nothing for me...... but to another it <br/>
&gt;could be life changing.  Now ask me about babies, midwifery, unschooling. <br/>
&gt;some theology, politics....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is precisely what I was talking about when I said different<br/>
individuals would find different focuses and interests within and outside<br/>
of all that I mentioned.  Of course, when I mention touching on world<br/>
history, I don&#39;t mean ALL of it.  Unless you aspire to a career as a docent<br/>
or professor or something.  I harbor great interests in herbalism,<br/>
paganism, native American cultures, medieval Europe, theology, child<br/>
psychology, fantasy and myth and a number of other things that I have<br/>
focused on more than other things in my own self learning.  The description<br/>
I gave is my own personal list of what comprises a &quot;good&quot; education for ME.<br/>
 I would also hope that my children would want to emulate some of that list.<br/>
<br/>
It is my strong belief that education is a lifelong adventure and I hope my<br/>
children never want to stop learning.  I look forward to a lifetime of<br/>
discovery with them, and the enjoyment of experiencing their &quot;firsts&quot; from<br/>
my now very special perspective as a mother.<br/>
<br/>
My hope for this list and the contacts made here is that we can all ramble<br/>
around together, live and learn together, maybe some of us get to know each<br/>
other personally - the better to enrich each others&#39; lives!<br/>
