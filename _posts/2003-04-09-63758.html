Just watching it has inspired me to write again.  I&#39;m going to mourn big<br/>
time when this season is over.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, these are the types of shows that I was originally referring to.  <br/>
Buffy, Charmed, Friends, etc.  These shows are adventurous, interesting, <br/>
funny, etc., respectively.  I really think that my son would enjoy them, but <br/>
they do seem to have an awful lot of sex.  My son is comfortable with what he <br/>
can stand in terms of violence, and has no problem changing the channel or <br/>
foregoing a movie or program because it&#39;s more than he has a tolerance for.  <br/>
I have never really given him the chance to gauge his preferences regarding <br/>
sexual content.  Now I feel that I have made a mistake.  Truly, though, there <br/>
are some things that I would simply not want him exposed to (Howard Stern <br/>
definitely comes to mind), but some shows (Dharma and Greg, Friends, <br/>
Everybody loves Raymond, etc.) deal with sex in a light and fairly realistic <br/>
manner (which is good).  I know that this is more about my own hang ups than <br/>
anything else, I just don&#39;t want to pass those hang ups on to my son.  Hmm.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going with this, I guess that I just don&#39;t want to <br/>
shield him unnecessarily or, on the other hand, be neglectful.  I&#39;m hoping <br/>
for a healthy balance.  Is that possible??? LOL!  Thanks for all the <br/>
feedback!  I&#39;m open to any ideas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the thing about Buffy, Charmed, etc is that they put sex in the<br/>
context of grown up relationships.  That&#39;s not to say there is no casual<br/>
sex.  But it used to be that there was either married sex or fornication.<br/>
Then any sex was ok.  Now it seems like there are some shows where it&#39;s all<br/>
fornication (night time soap opera kinds of stuff) or shows that demonstrate<br/>
the wider variety of sex that actually happens in life.  IE, some people<br/>
wait until they get married, some don&#39;t, some play around, etc.  Shows like<br/>
Buffy really show how each of those choices affect a person.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way that you&#39;d talk about WHY a person is acting violently, I<br/>
think it&#39;s important to talk about WHY a person would choose to be sexual in<br/>
that situation.  The balance comes less from what he sees, and more from how<br/>
you react to it.<br/>
