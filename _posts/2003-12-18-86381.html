<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433771288">Hi~<br/>
   I have just recently relaxed our Television &quot;rules&quot; and have let them <br/>
self-regulate...which IS working by the way. ( kids are 7 and 5).<br/>
<br/>
  I had to laugh this morning though..my son (7) was excited and animated as <br/>
he told me he loves to get up by 7am to watch TV. <br/>
He said he LOVES the half hour commercials. <br/>
<br/>
What??? Then it dawned on me that he meant those Informercials...hahaha. I <br/>
had to smile.<br/>
 <br/>
 But what was cool was that he started decribing all the products he has seen <br/>
and how they work..in DETAIL!  And he was just so fascinated about it. He has <br/>
an &quot;inventor&quot; streak in him &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~Marcia ...who&#39;s happy he made no mention of purchasing the products just <br/>
that he enjoys watching them....hahaha<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are &quot;Seen on TV&quot; stores around now. So it might be really fun to <br/>
go in and see those products &quot;live&quot; too. Sometimes they are out of the <br/>
box and working. Sometimes they&#39;re cheap enough to buy one just to have <br/>
closer look at it.  We&#39;ve bought a few things based on infomercials - a <br/>
food dehydrator was one and it is great. Also bought &quot;space bags&quot; - <br/>
plastic storage bags that you suck all the air out of with a vacuum <br/>
cleaner in reverse so things like blankets or sleeping bags that you&#39;re <br/>
storing can take up very very little room.<br/>
<br/>
I have a cool book called, &quot;Why Not: How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to <br/>
Solve Problems Big and Small&quot; byÂ  Ian Ayres, Barry Nalebuff  which is <br/>
about how to be creative and inventive and come up with marketable <br/>
ideas in response to everyday life problems - they have a website <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://whynot.net/">http://whynot.net/</a>&gt; and on it they have a place where many people have <br/>
posted their inventive ideas for products. These are very interesting, <br/>
many would be interesting to a 7 yo kid, too - there is a &quot;doggy <br/>
doorbell,&quot; a &quot;beeping golf ball,&quot; and wrist-watch cell phones and much <br/>
much more.<br/>

<br/>
And outside the pocket fisherman, there&#39;s very little violence.<br/>
Even INSIDE it there&#39;s very little violence, and I doubt they sell them <br/>
anymore anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I like the intensity of the presentation on those things.   There are <br/>
emotions in the voice and delivery that you just hardly hear anywhere else.  <br/>
Sometimes combinations of intensity and joy and desperation and expansiveness.  Maybe <br/>
aspiring actors should watch a couple.  When I was broken-legged sometimes I <br/>
would fall asleep with the TV on (I fell asleep a lot when the narcotics were <br/>
still a part of my life) and would wake up to something about leg exercises, <br/>
and that never felt good to see. &lt;g&gt;  Or food prep stuff, and I couldn&#39;t get to <br/>
the kitchen at all.  But for a mobile, whole person, they&#39;re not so <br/>
emotionally damaging. LOL.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kat had problems waking up and not being able to get back to sleep for a<br/>
while so she ended up watching late night television. She not only learned a<br/>
lot about gems from the home shopping networks but that patter that they<br/>
use. She used our video camera to make several of her own commercials and<br/>
perfectly captured that same tone and urgency to buy now! ;-)<br/>

       My dd sang with some of her theatre people as choir to a big church <br/>
production downtown -- by invitation. not membership -- and there was PLENTY of <br/>
intensity and emotion in all the speaking parts by the regular churchgoers.  <br/>
<br/>
       Don&#39;t have to buy the message (in either case) to appreciate the <br/>
delivery. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right.<br/>
Infomercials have something in common with some kinds of sermons. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Buy this product and you will be HEALed-eh.<br/>
Praise the Lord.  Only $19.95, and not available in any other church.<br/>
