<br/>
I agree.  If not aikido, karate or something.  Not the street-fighting <br/>
schools (you can tell from their ads and the stuff that will be on the door <br/>
or in the front office whether they&#39;re teaching from a calm, more spiritual <br/>
place, or whether they&#39;re kick-boxing afficionados into tournaments and heavy <br/>
competition).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Go to the museum and <br/>
say, &quot;Shoot, you can draw better than that!  Maybe you should be a world <br/>
famous artist so you can support me in the style to which I&#39;d like to be <br/>
accustomed!&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t say that last part.  It&#39;s just one more way to make a kid fail, if <br/>
parents say &quot;You could be rich and famous.&quot;   Having been a kid who got that <br/>
kind of pressure regularly, I can say for sure it&#39;s irritating and you can <br/>
live the rest of your life in the shadow of the imaginary &quot;success&quot; you never <br/>
wanted anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But the rest of that advice about a drawing kid seemed wonderful!  <br/>
Especially, I think, for the mom to draw too, so maybe he can have a chance <br/>
to do something with and like her, or maybe even to do something better than <br/>
she can.  It would help his confidence to see that someone who can do some <br/>
things way better can do something worse, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-335342743">I was supposed to earn my way through college playing the violin.  I played<br/>
for 5 years and was pretty good at it, but quit in high school.  My memory<br/>
of quitting is that I was tired of having to carry the violin around, back<br/>
and forth to school and home for practice and use at both places.<br/>
<br/>
Dh says that is ridiculous, that nobody would ever quit for that reason.<br/>
<br/>
The comment below makes me wonder if the pressure to accomplish something<br/>
for others was a subconscious factor in my decision to quit.  I knew I could<br/>
play well, but I certainly wasn&#39;t GREAT at it.<br/>
