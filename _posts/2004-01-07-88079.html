<div id="ygrps-yiv-833859781">&quot;SO, I guess my <br/>
question is, when letting your kids have full control over the food, do they <br/>
eat enough vegetables and the such?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, that depends on what &quot;enough&quot; vegetables means.:)<br/>
I can tell you a few things about my kids that are completely free to choose what/when they eat.<br/>
At Sunday, Sierra did a sheet at church about her favorites. Her favorite food? She said Brocolli. Hmph! Not ice cream, not pizza, not candy or chips...BROCOLLI. And she was serious. She loves steamed brocolli with a bit of balsamic vinegar dripped over. She&#39;s 6 years old.<br/>
<br/>
Jared (10) is my most health conscious as of late. Formerly a picky eater, and very skinny, he became quite curious and interested in various foods when we became radical unschoolers three years ago. By giving him total freedom (we never made the kids clean up their plates or that kind of nonsense, but we were pushy about &quot;healthy&quot; foods vs. &quot;junk&quot;) he regained his natural curiosity and experimented with all sorts of food and now enjoys baking also. He has turned down pizza in favor of carrots and apples, decided recently that he wants to be a complete vegetarian and positively adores salad.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (14) is more of a typical American kid as far as food goes. Loves pizza and tacos and such. Chips and soda are part of his week usually. But he&#39;s also very aware of his body and what makes him feel rotten. After binging a bit on sweets, he&#39;ll usually beg me to make a protein rich meal (&quot;I need some REAL food Mom&quot;.) I just walked out in the kitchen and he&#39;s eating cake for breakfast (left over from last nights party), good thing I put some whole wheat flour and organic eggs in there.:) <br/>
<br/>
My little guy (almost 3) is a typical toddler, snacking from whatever is left out or available. I often make platters of small sandwiches, chopped up veggies with dip and fruit, it tends to disappear over the course of our day. He loves gum and sweets too. I blame breast milk for that.(insert sarcastic voice here)....<br/>

definitely Teresa&#39;s Mac and cheese.<br/>

Oh yeah, my boys have always had total control of their food as well.<br/>
