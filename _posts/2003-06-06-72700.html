&gt; <br/>
&gt; You asked in SOME post, SOME where, whether your logic fit in with <br/>
&gt; Holt. I clicked around some, trying to figure out where you were <br/>
&gt; coming from in the math/calculator thread. Couldn&#39;t find what you had <br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; LOLAnyway, I think getting into the problem IS the way to think well, <br/>
&gt; whether math probs or otherwise. Not fishing around for the right <br/>
&gt; answer, but seeing oneself IN it, and figuring it out from there. If <br/>
&gt; you posted about that, then yeah, you were following Holt logic!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; L I find Yahoo lists difficult to follow a thread. In fact! I <br/>
&gt; went &quot;up thread&quot; on a topic today, and ended up reading something <br/>
&gt; posted in the year 2000.!!!<br/>

<br/>
This is Rhonda. I was actually the one that asked you for clarification on <br/>
the Holt thought process. It was about when I was young and in school I could <br/>
never show my work in math. I always put myself in the problem and found my <br/>
answer that way. I gave the train analogy to Timbuctoo. LOL I thought you meant <br/>
that my though process was very Holt like and probably why I frustrated most <br/>
teacher and myself for not being able to to their way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for answering though, sorry Mary, I probably pasted something with <br/>
your name on it.<br/>
