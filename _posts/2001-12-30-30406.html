<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415590168">I have an old 4-door sedan (89 Toyota Camry) with sliding lap/shoulder belts <br/>
in the back seat, plus lap belts only in the middle of the back seat. My 4yo <br/>
ds Nicky has outgrown/destroyed (with scissors -- *not* a good idea in the <br/>
car) his child safety seats. I understand I&#39;m supposed to use a booster seat <br/>
now, but it seems like it would slide around in the back seat, since the way <br/>
they work is you sit the child in it, then strap child and seat in.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there have a child car safety arrangement they&#39;re happy with <br/>
for a kid this age, that they could tell me about? Right now I just buckle <br/>
Nicky into the lap belt and let the shoulder part go behind him -- but it&#39;s <br/>
loose, and he is always wiggling out of it to go draw on the floor or <br/>
whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548891167">We use a booster seat and it works great! The one we use is called a<br/>
Kangaroo seat and it is corduroy covered foam. It lifts the child high<br/>
enough so that the lap and shoulder strap land in the right position. When<br/>
we bought ours, which is now being used by child #3, I took them out to the<br/>
car to check how they fit before I purchased one. Depending on the shape of<br/>
your seats one may work better than another. I also have an apparatus that<br/>
you fit on the seat belt like a glove that adjusts the shoulder strap so<br/>
that the seat belt can do the work it&#39;s designed for. This sleeve or glove<br/>
can easily be removed and transferred to any car that your child finds<br/>
themselves in. Here in Toronto there are several stores that specialize in<br/>
child safety equipment and there is a fair amount of selection these days.<br/>
Just using the lap belt without the shoulder support is useless. From the<br/>
research I&#39;ve read, should you get rear ended with your child or yourself in<br/>
a lap belt only you have a very good chance of snapping your spine and<br/>
crushing your inner organs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503812836">Hi, Annette!<br/>
<br/>
My four-year-old ds uses a carseat I got him at a year old. The 5-point straps<br/>
are removed and it&#39;s used as a booster now to position the shoulder belt. I<br/>
liked it so much I got an identical one for my 2-year-old dd. It&#39;s a Cosco<br/>
convertable with a dark blue cover, very affordable.<br/>
<br/>
Over the holidays when we were riding 3 adults and the two little guys around,<br/>
we took his carseat out (I know, bad mommy) and he really missed it, because he<br/>
couldn&#39;t look around and see behind him. OTOH, he&#39;s not a guy that tries to<br/>
escape. If I had one of those, I&#39;d look for a real carseat with a 5-point<br/>
restraint that went up that big. They do make them, and they&#39;re required in some<br/>
countries, I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
<br/>

for the shoulder strap which keeps it off her neck and where it is <br/>
supposed to be.  Here in CA as of Tu. children 6 and/or under 60 pounds<br/>
are to be in such seats.  My daughter is 6 but she weighs no where near<br/>
60 pounds!  <br/>
