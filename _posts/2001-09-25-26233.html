<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637901757">I&#39;m not sure if it was this list or another, but I&#39;ve heard other mom&#39;s talk <br/>
about children&#39;s allergies.  My son is allergic to dairy and eggs, since <br/>
birth, but now I&#39;m wondering about other stuff too.  Seems like I&#39;ve heard <br/>
someone talk about preservatives and other unnatural stuff, just wanted a bit <br/>
more specific info.  Like he gets wired on sugar, but sometimes when he has <br/>
candy, he behaves like he&#39;s had dairy or eggs.  I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s dyes or <br/>
preservatives or something. So just wondering what were allergies for other <br/>
kids. Any feedback would be great....Thanks!<br/>
