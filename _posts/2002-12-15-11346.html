**********************************************<br/>
<br/>
(To the tune of &quot;If You&#39;re Happy And You Know It Clap Your Hands&quot;)<br/>
If we cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.<br/>
If the markets hurt your Mama, bomb Iraq.<br/>
If the terrorists are Saudi<br/>
And the bank takes back your Audi<br/>
And the TV shows are bawdy,<br/>
Bomb Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
If the corporate scandals growin&#39;, bomb Iraq.<br/>
And your ties to them are showin&#39;, bomb Iraq.<br/>
If the smoking gun ain&#39;t smokin&#39;<br/>
We don&#39;t care, and we&#39;re not jokin&#39;.<br/>
That Saddam will soon be croakin&#39;,<br/>
Bomb Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we have no allies, bomb Iraq.<br/>
 From the sand dunes to the valleys, bomb Iraq.<br/>
So to hell with the inspections;<br/>
Let&#39;s look tough for the elections,<br/>
Close your mind and take directions,<br/>
Bomb Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
While the globe is slowly warming, bomb Iraq.<br/>
Yay! the clouds of war are storming, bomb Iraq.<br/>
If the ozone hole is growing,<br/>
Some things we prefer not knowing.<br/>
(Though our ignorance is showing),<br/>
Bomb Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s one for dear old daddy, bomb Iraq,<br/>
 From his favorite little laddy, bomb Iraq.<br/>
Saying no would look like treason.<br/>
It&#39;s the Hussein hunting season.<br/>
Even if we have no reason,<br/>
Bomb Iraq.</div>
