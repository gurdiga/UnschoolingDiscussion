<div id="ygrps-yiv-540695281">Thank you Melisa.  I though I was the only one thinking this way all of <br/>
sudden.  It is hard if you did not start with that philosophy from the <br/>
start.  If you did, then the children first learned by seeing you do it, <br/>
later by doing it too.  They get the idea that it is a &quot;particip-action&quot; <br/>
thing.  It is not so much a chore as part of living. By now my 16 years <br/>
old can do anything &quot;housework&quot; including some home maintenance and <br/>
maintenance of the family vehicles. They have their own accounts and <br/>
budget.  They have enough life skills to take care of themselves.<br/>

&gt;learning from life.  Life may mean some things that have to get <br/>
&gt;done.  We have to wash dishes or we dont have anything to eat off of, <br/>
&gt;or to cook with. We have to change the oil in the car or it wont go. <br/>
&gt;We have to wash clothes, or we will all have to go naked.  (Nobody <br/>
&gt;wants that).  I also believe that by teaching my sons these life <br/>
&gt;tasks they are learning things that will benefit them.  I teach them <br/>
&gt;to cook, to keep the house decent, to do their laundry, to balance a <br/>
&gt;checkbook, ect.  Is this not unschooling?  I have to say that it is.  <br/>
&gt;It is general responsibility and though I do agree that they get to <br/>
&gt;choose and their day is centered around that, they must also learn <br/>
&gt;that some things just have to happen in life.  I would be <br/>
&gt;irresponsible as a parent if I didnt teach them what it took to <br/>
&gt;live.  To pay bills and to take care of what it takes to take care of <br/>
&gt;their families if and when they have them.  <br/>

Please, don&#39;t *ever* regret choosing a book or computer game or whatever <br/>
attracts you over cleaning your house.  If you feel the desire to read, <br/>
then read!  If a game calls your name, then play!  If your child wants to <br/>
snuggle, then snuggle!<br/>
<br/>
I think that maybe if you let yourself really enjoy your non-cleaning <br/>
choices as you make them (and later), then you&#39;ll find it easier to later <br/>
(maybe even months or years later!) choose to tidy up.  I mean, if &#39;tidying <br/>
up&#39; keeps you from books and sun and kids and games, then sure, why <br/>
*wouldn&#39;t* you avoid it!  How awful!  &#39;Tidying up&#39; sounds like such an <br/>
inhibiting thing when it should be freeing, and fun and <br/>
satisfaction-bringing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe let yourself decompress from thinking tidying up is more important <br/>
than books and games.<br/>
It&#39;s just another choice, is all.  Right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144789108">Something else that works for me is to do what I want and then commit myself to 10 minutes of cleaning or doing one cleaning thing (like washing dishes).  Then go back to what I was doing for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Or, on my way to the bathroom or whatever, just do whatever is in my path.<br/>
