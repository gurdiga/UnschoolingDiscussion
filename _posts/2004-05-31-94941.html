You might get close and then have to google around a bit to tweak your <br/>
results.  But, we&#39;ve found really cool information starting with those <br/>
field guides.<br/>

A note to newbies, after you get over the programmed shock of <br/>
unschooling, it becomes natural to just flow with it. I learned this <br/>
the hard way. I was fighting it in myself, not feeling the truth of <br/>
how natural it is. I wish no one had to go through that. I am not <br/>
thinking about how much my child might be learning through her bug <br/>
love and hunting, I just know she is.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678524031">Hello,<br/>
            My name is Jillian and I am the mother of 3 wonderful kids<br/>
(arent they all). They are Beth (6 but will be 7 in June), Jerome (4 ½)<br/>
and Eddie (3). Ive been lurking on the board for a month or so now.<br/>
Ive been slowly taking everything in. I recently found unschooling<br/>
(about 3 months ago) and have been slowly trying to put it into<br/>
practice. Its not really a switch from what we were doing with Beth<br/>
since she has never been to school. I am lucky enough to get to stay<br/>
home while my husband works. Im going to write a small bit about each<br/>
of us so you can get to know us. We dont really know many people who<br/>
either homeschool or unschool. We live out in the boonies (and by<br/>
boonies I mean its long distance to call any of our neighbors) on a 10<br/>
acre plot of land in Northeast Kansas. Anyway, on with the introduction<br/>
Me (aka Mommy or Jillian)<br/>
            Im 26 and have been married since my 19th birthday to the<br/>
best man in the world (ok so Im bias). I have recently found something<br/>
that I am very interested in. Its photography. Ive never really had<br/>
anything that I have been passionate about until now. Here are a few<br/>
links to some of the pictures I have taken recently. I think I am<br/>
getting better at it but its just trial and error. I cook and clean and<br/>
play. Thats about it and thats just fine by me. I dont really have<br/>
any friends around me but thankfully I have the internet and I still get<br/>
to talk to my best friends from childhood online. I dont go out much<br/>
(other then the once a week volunteer for a day care in a gym in Topeka)<br/>
but I am more of a homebody anyway. I enjoy music and just being silly.<br/>
Anyway here are some photo links (they were all taken in our yard)<br/>

 <br/>
Joe (aka Hubby)<br/>
            Hes a soon to be 32 year old computer and gaming guy. He is<br/>
the IT Director for a mental health place in Topeka. He loves gaming and<br/>
has been playing RPGs for years. He even wrote a book for the Lord of<br/>
the Rings role playing game (Maps of Middle-Earth: Cities and<br/>
Strongholds). He was really pleased with them because he drew up the<br/>
maps and the guy who drew the maps for the movies copied them for the<br/>
book. Hes a great guy and is really smart. The kids learn so much from<br/>
him. He is very patient and loving and its awesome. <br/>
Here is his picture<br/>

 <br/>
Beth (aka BethieLou)<br/>
            Shes really excited about finally turning 7. She just<br/>
learned how to ride a normal sized kids bike and she rides all over the<br/>
yard. She loves butterflies, bugs, flowers, playing with magnets,<br/>
drawing and just being a great kid. We had started her on a curriculum a<br/>
while back but once we found unschooling we all decided that it was<br/>
better. I recently got to throw away all the papers that came with the<br/>
curriculum and it made me very happy. She loves to read. She will read<br/>
all the time. Its cool because she will also read to her brothers and<br/>
they just love that. <br/>
Here is her picture<br/>

 <br/>
Jerome (aka Romy)      <br/>
            Hes 4 ½ and just an awesome kid. He has some anger trouble<br/>
but we have been talking about it and he is really smart and he is<br/>
finally starting to understand how to control his anger instead of just<br/>
letting it fly off the handle at his brother or sister. He also just<br/>
learned to ride a bike this weekend. He is so happy with himself (and we<br/>
are so proud too!) that he rides around the driveway like there is no<br/>
tomorrow. He just learned today how to get the bike going by himself<br/>
without a push from mom or dad. The smile on his face was priceless.<br/>
Hes a big lover of all things mechanical. He loves puzzles and can<br/>
pretty much look at a puzzle once (not huge ones but kid sized ones) and<br/>
put it back together with little trouble. Hes a big hugger and kisser<br/>
and I love that a lot. <br/>
Here is his picture<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/romy/romyjingy3.jpg">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/romy/romyjingy3.jpg</a><br/>
 <br/>
Edward (aka Eddie Spaghetti)<br/>
            Hes 3 and just crazy as the day is long. We will spend<br/>
hours just being silly and rolling around in the grass. He loves bugs<br/>
and is the only person in the house brave enough (except for Daddy) to<br/>
take the june bugs back outside when they sneak in. His favorite thing<br/>
is to ride on the Harley power wheels motorcycle around the yard. Hes<br/>
trying to learn how to ride a bike because he wants to be like everyone<br/>
else. He has scraped knees but he still keeps trying. He is also a big<br/>
lover guy and will sit on my lap and cuddle for hours. He likes cars and<br/>
ninjas. Hes a big Ninja Turtle fan as well. <br/>
Here is his picture<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/eddihandsome.jpg">http://img31.photobucket.com/albums/v94/jemandala/eddihandsome.jpg</a><br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, thats probably a pretty long introduction and I apologize but I<br/>
just wanted to become acquainted with the group and start contributing<br/>
when I can. I figure if you know more about us then it will be easier<br/>
for you to help me out with suggestions and such. I am still new to all<br/>
of this and have changed a whole lot since I started this unschooling<br/>
journey. We are working on being more mindful parents and helping our<br/>
kids find what they need and not telling them what they need. Its<br/>
working well so far. The kids are happy and I am happy. My house may not<br/>
always been clean and my laundry will never been done but we are living<br/>
and happy and to me thats all that really matters. <br/>
Thanks for putting up with my long windedness. Its 4 in the morning<br/>
and I just cant sleep so I tend to ramble. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-867172996">Welcome to the list.  I hope you find lots of what you&#39;re looking for here, <br/>
informationally, at least :0)<br/>
<br/>
I have been on the list for a while and it has helped me loads.  Unschooling <br/>
no longer seems like something we do, it&#39;s just the way it is around here.  <br/>
Unfortunately, my oldest (Andrew 6) is still in Kindergarten but we are down to <br/>
2 weeks and he is looking forward to it being over, while he chooses to stay <br/>
in.  The way we live has always followed this philosophy, but we never &quot;named&quot; <br/>
it.  This past year of Kindergarten has put a strain on the natural flow of <br/>
things but we have all learned a valuable lesson and look forward to life as it <br/>
was and as it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Your post was very informative, Beth sounds like a great kid and tell Jerome <br/>
congrats on the bike riding, that is a major accomplishment in such a young <br/>
life.  As for Eddie, power wheels rule until you can power them yerself :0)<br/>
<br/>
I checked out yer pics, nice.  I am into photography too but by no means an <br/>
expert.  I just love taking pictures of stuff all the time.  I thought about <br/>
scrapbooking but I was too overwhelmed by my stacks and boxes and discs and <br/>
albums of pics to even find a starting point.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, enjoy the list.  I do immensely.  I just don&#39;t post much because I feel <br/>
like I&#39;m on the outskirts right now while our lives remain chaotic with this <br/>
foreign thing called Kindergarten.  I wanted to welcome you because I got a <br/>
warm welcome right from the beginning and it felt good.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the list, I enjoyed reading about you and your kids. I <br/>
especially liked looking at your photos, the last one was really <br/>
good. We rarely get weather like that here - I love those big anvil <br/>
clouds piling against the horizon, and we sure don&#39;t have a horizon <br/>
like that either (too many hills!). Photography is one of my big <br/>
passions too, and there&#39;s some great resources for learning about it <br/>
out there as well. I started out with an old 35 mm camera and my dad <br/>
got me the Time/Life series of books on photography at a garage sale. <br/>
Now, I love digital because I can take so many pictures (my husband <br/>
used to complain about my film &quot;habit&quot;, LOL - thousands of photos a <br/>
year can get expensive!)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my favorite weather pic (sunset, from 3 years ago): <br/>

<br/>
and a couple from this month of my kiddos, Mackenzie (7.5): <br/>

and Asa (4.5):<br/>

<br/>
Like you, my kids haven&#39;t been to school - it&#39;s so nice not to have <br/>
to stop this great path of life/learning that we&#39;re all on. Plus, I&#39;d <br/>
miss them a ton if they ended up going off to school. Time enough for <br/>
that when they&#39;re 18 or so...<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to your new bike riders. I really need to take Asa out to <br/>
the bike path. We live on such a hill that there&#39;s nowhere flat she <br/>
can ride here, except our garage. She really wants to get the hang of <br/>
riding without training wheels and soon (this girl is always in a <br/>
hurry to do anything big brother can do!)<br/>
<br/>
So welcome to the list, I hope you enjoy and get lots out of it.<br/>

<br/>
Your county extension agent will know and be able to identify some bugs. <br/>
If she cant she&#39;ll send your critter to an entomologist at the university<br/>
and get an ID.   (they kill the bug in order to send it and get an ID -<br/>
just so you know.  That may or may not appeal to your daughter.  Your<br/>
county agent won&#39;t kill it if you take it to her, just if you want her to<br/>
send it in to the entomologist.) <br/>
<br/>
Or you could take your bug to the entomologist yourself, but be warned,<br/>
bug people will talk to you all day and show you every bug in their<br/>
collection. &lt;g&gt;  (you can take the live bug) <br/>
<br/>
Your state university&#39;s dept. of entomology probably has a website where<br/>
you&#39;d find information specific to your area.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a listserv we found that Dylan uses.  If you send questions and<br/>
/or photo&#39;s you get answers and usually website addresses to look up more<br/>
info about your critter.<br/>
<br/>
BUGNET has been formed to meet the need for a &quot;non-professional&quot;<br/>
entomology mailing list, i.e. to serve as a resource for teachers and bug<br/>
enthusiasts to ask questions to professional entomologists. To subscribe,<br/>
send an email message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:listproc@...">listproc@...</a> with a blank subject<br/>
line and body text consisting of &quot;subscribe bugnet John Doe&quot; where John<br/>
Doe is your real name. For messages to the subscribers, send to<br/>

Eric Eaton identifies bugs and draws wonderful bug illustrations.  He has<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308044187">Hi Kimmy~Insectlore.com has great information on insects. We found the info <br/>
to be short, informative and to the point. My mother purchased a butterfly <br/>
pavilion and ladybug lantern from them for my son, Shane. So far we received <br/>
caterpillars and half survived long enough to emerge as butterflies. We were <br/>
planning on releasing them a few days after emerging when we learned that they might <br/>
lay eggs after a week and Shane wanted to see that happen. Three died so we <br/>
let the last two go free w/out egg laying and are now awaiting &quot;replacement&quot; <br/>
caterpillars for the ones that died in chrysalis state. The ladybugs should be <br/>
here any day now and we&#39;re hoping some hang out for a while in our garden and <br/>
protect our plants.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of any other sites but there are books on id&#39;ing bugs...we <br/>
really like dk books for stuff like that. Have you tried a search on Google?<br/>
