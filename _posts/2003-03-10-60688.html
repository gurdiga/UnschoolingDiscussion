<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326643920">The editors of Home Education Magazine have created a new list: HEM Recipes!<br/>
<br/>
To join the list visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Recipes">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HEM-Recipes</a><br/>

Or send a blank email message to: mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HEM-Recipes-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">HEM-Recipes-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
This list is designed to be an archive and storehouse of the best <br/>
recipes from homeschooling families and friends of homeschooling! <br/>
This is meant to be a wide-ranging resource list, a place to not only <br/>
post your favorite family foods and Kids in the Kitchen ideas for <br/>
learning, but for craft recipes (silly putty, goop, gak, bubblestuff, <br/>
playdough, fingerpaints, etc.), science experiments (baking soda <br/>
volcanoes and food color rainbows), recipes for learning and living, <br/>
and classics such as this old favorite, which isn&#39;t really a &quot;recipe&quot; <br/>
per se, but indicates the wide range of resources we&#39;ll be featuring:<br/>

Children Learn What They Live<br/>
By Dorothy Law Nolte<br/>
<br/>
           If children live with criticism,<br/>
                They learn to condemn.<br/>
           If children live with hostility,<br/>
                They learn to fight.<br/>
           If children live with ridicule,<br/>
                They learn to be shy.<br/>
           If children live with shame,<br/>
                They learn to feel guilty.<br/>
           If children live with encouragement,<br/>
                They learn confidence.<br/>
           If children live with tolerance,<br/>
                They learn to be patient.<br/>
           If children live with praise,<br/>
                They learn to appreciate.<br/>
           If children live with acceptance,<br/>
                They learn to love.<br/>
           If children live with approval,<br/>
                They learn to like themselves.<br/>
           If children live with honesty,<br/>
                They learn truthfulness.<br/>
           If children live with security,<br/>
                They learn to have faith in themselves and others.<br/>
           If children live with friendliness,<br/>
                They learn the world is a nice place in which to live.<br/>
