<br/>
The answers to these questions so often don&#39;t seem to be heard or are sort of <br/>
overlooked. I think that&#39;s because they don&#39;t entirely sound like &quot;answers&quot; <br/>
to people who are looking for another concrete rule to replace the one <br/>
they&#39;re giving up. What we really give them are very general principles and <br/>
examples of how those play out in our own specific and idiosyncratic lives - <br/>
but that&#39;s hard to &quot;get&quot; when you&#39;re looking for a rule.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t have a rule that says &quot;bedtime is at 9 pm,&quot; then what bedtime <br/>
rule DO we have? Lost of times people think that the new rule is then ONLY, <br/>
&quot;bedtime is whenever it happens.&quot; They think that means the parents stop <br/>
thinking about the child&#39;s sleep needs. But, in all the families that I know <br/>
who have no rule about bedtimes, the parents are consciously and actively <br/>
helping their kids get a good sense of taking care of their sleep needs. The <br/>
rule doesn&#39;t just flip-flop from bedtime to &quot;no bedtime&quot;  -- there is a whole <br/>
huge different way of handling and learning about sleep needs that replaces <br/>
the entire concept of a &quot;bedtime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To change the subject but make the same point...<br/>
<br/>
 People at park day were having a conversation about video games and some of <br/>
us were talking about not setting limits on them. As usual, someone assumed <br/>
that that meant that our kids would be spending 24 hours a day, day after <br/>
day, only on that with no other interests developing, etc. So we were talking <br/>
about that - about all the OTHER stuff that we do and how they learn etc. <br/>
(You&#39;ve heard it all before, here, so I&#39;m not repeating all that - but it was <br/>
a lot of discussion there at the park.)<br/>
<br/>
Then - there was this startling moment when one person said, &quot;But it is so <br/>
expensive to buy video games - how can you let them have unlimited video <br/>
games without going broke? We could never afford that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Silence.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Talk about flip-flopping. She took us arguing against rules like &quot;You <br/>
may have exactly one hour per day of video game time,&quot; or &quot;You may spend the <br/>
afternoon playing absolutely anything you want as long as it doesn&#39;t involve <br/>
tv or videogames&quot; as saying that we&#39;d buy our kids an unlimited stock of <br/>
whatever videogames they wanted?<br/>
<br/>
Well - some of the kids happened to BE there right then and heard that bit <br/>
and THEY reacted immediately with, &quot;We usually have to buy our OWN games.&quot; <br/>
She was somewhat bewildered, I think. In fact, I think it was news to her <br/>
that we didn&#39;t control the videogame time of our kids with arbitrary rules. <br/>
<br/>
The thing that amused me  was that she&#39;d heard &quot;unlimited videogames&quot; as <br/>
meaning that we would BUY them whatever they wanted whenever they wanted <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about a failure to communicate!!! When we say what we do NOT do (we <br/>
don&#39;t have bedtimes, for example) we sometimes can&#39;t even imagine what people <br/>
might be thinking we do do &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987488327">My granny always said that people should go to bed when the sun goes down, and get up when it comes up. She also swore that children who spent their lives in the sun (whether outside or in a house full of open windows) grew up to be healthier and smarter!

that got out of control and one girl knifed another girl killing her. This was<br/>
a very &quot;safe&quot; suburban community and the girl who did the killing was from<br/>
a very rich family. I wasn&#39;t as interested in the story as I was in watching<br/>
the teens they talked with. One of the things that stood out was several teens saying<br/>
that these drinking parties were their time to get away from their parents. To <br/>
just be able to be themselves. They just wanted to get away from their parents for<br/>
awhile.<br/>
<br/>
I found this sad. I have a few friends with teenagers and they all tell me to <br/>
enjoy my kids while they are young, that once they grow up, they don&#39;t listen<br/>
to you or respect you. Not a very nice picture of the future.<br/>
<br/>
It is so nice to hear Pam and Sandra and others here with teens say that it does not<br/>
need to be this way. I have been making some conscious changes in the way that I <br/>
interact with the boys (mostly looking for ways to say yes and when disagreements <br/>
happen I have been modeling (by becoming involved with) how to reach a solution,<br/>
rather then just telling them what to do) and things seem to be running smoother. <br/>
I know that I have been better able to handle some things that normally would <br/>
have turned into a shouting match. And it seems as if the boys are being more <br/>
cooperative lately. It might be that I am just looking for it more, but even if <br/>
that is the case that is a good thing! <br/>

I can also atest to the fact that there is life after adolescents!! And my <br/>
16 year old is a school child. We did indeed have out share of problems but <br/>
I really attribute that to me not knowing and having the proper info to deal <br/>
with her and the way she was brought up as a small child. Of course some of <br/>
it has to do with how her life was and also I believe school and peer <br/>
pressure goes in with that. But we were able to weather the storm.<br/>
<br/>
When she comes with us on park days with the homeschoolers, I&#39;ve had so many <br/>
moms of young girls say they hope they can be the way Tara and I are with <br/>
each other when their daughters are teens. Everyone says we always look like <br/>
we are enjoying each other so much. You know why?? We are!!!<br/>
<br/>
She has no problem being very affectionate with me in public and even when <br/>
her friends are around. She is even amazed at how her friends feel about <br/>
their parents. She&#39;ll be the first to admit how much she loves her mommy. <br/>
When she went away in the summer on a week cruise, she cried in bed every <br/>
night with her best friend that she missed me! When she came home, she made <br/>
me promise I would never leave her!!! I wasn&#39;t the one that left!!!! She <br/>
does know she will leave us one day, but she said it will only be down the <br/>
street!!!!<br/>

don&#39;t get to experience this. Our culture seems to push early<br/>
&quot;independence&quot; and forced separation from parents and then when the teen<br/>
years come around parents wonder why their teens don&#39;t want to be around<br/>
