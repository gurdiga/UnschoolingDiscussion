A Morning in the Bauer Home School<br/>
<br/>
by Susan Wise  Bauer<br/>
<br/>
Classical education with four children aged 12, 10, 7, and  3.<br/>
<br/>
5 AM I get up and go downstairs for coffee. Okay, I know this is  revoltingly<br/>
early, but I’ve discovered that getting up early and finishing up  my own<br/>
jobs allows me to lie on the sofa like a slug in the evenings after  the<br/>
children go to bed. This fall, I’m teaching two classes at William &  Mary,<br/>
so I have plenty of grading to do. This morning, I blow the grading off  and<br/>
work on my newest writing project instead: W. W. Norton has asked me  to<br/>
write a history of the world for grown-ups. The Assyrian Kings List  is<br/>
remarkably hard to convert into stirring narrative.<br/>
<br/>
7 AM Emily  wails. I go into her room; she’s sitting up in bed clutching her<br/>
blanket. “I  had a nightmare!” she screams when she sees me. “What was it?” <br/>
I<br/>
ask. “There  was a dark dark CAVE!” Emily yells. “I was in a dark dark CAVE!”<br/>
“It was just  pretend,” I say; this is my usual response, but she’s not<br/>
buying it today.  “It was DARK!” she says, accusingly. So I turn on her lamp.<br/>
“Were you all  alone in the cave?” I ask. “No,” she says, in a voice of <br/>
doom.<br/>
“ALL OF THE  BROTHERS were there!” Hmm. I’m not sure whether that’s part of<br/>
the nightmare  or not. I lay her down, change her diaper, and give her a<br/>
bottle (I know,  three is too old for a bottle, but she’ll drink it and go<br/>
straight back to  sleep).<br/>
<br/>
7:30 AM Shower, dress, dry hair, put on shoes. This isn’t one of  my William<br/>
& Mary days, so we have a lot of school to get through. My  husband Peter<br/>
will take over at 3 PM to do math, geography, and handwriting;  he’ll send<br/>
Daniel (7) over to see my mother for a reading lesson and he’ll  supervise<br/>
some of the tasks that Christopher (12) and Ben (10)) can do on  their own<br/>
(typing, Latin vocabulary cards, spelling worksheets).<br/>
<br/>
8 PM  I go get everyone up. Christopher is already up reading; he’s an early<br/>
riser  and has already been out to do some of his chores. Ben is sound<br/>
asleep; he’s  a late riser, and when I try to wake him up he curls into a<br/>
ball and puts his  head under his knees. I get Emily and put her in his bed.<br/>
Daniel comes out of  his room and stands in the middle of the floor. “Time to<br/>
get dressed,” I say.  “I don’t have any clothes,” he says. I walk him back <br/>
to<br/>
his room, take out  his clothes and put them in a stack on the floor. He<br/>
looks at them. “Oh,” he  says. “Those clothes.”<br/>
<br/>
8:10 Christopher is waiting by the door to go out.  All three boys generally<br/>
take the dogs for a long walk before breakfast; we  live on a farm, but since<br/>
it’s hunting season, we keep the dogs in their pen  for most of the day. Ben<br/>
is dressing. Emily is in the middle of Ben’s bed  making a stuffed animal<br/>
pyramid. Daniel comes out of his room with no clothes  on and a Lego robot in<br/>
one hand. “Mom,” he says, “do you know why this guy is  special?” “Get<br/>
DRESSED,” I say.<br/>
<br/>
8:15 Ben and Christopher are standing  by the door. Daniel hops out of his<br/>
room on one foot, wearing two socks and  nothing else. “Mom!” he says. “If<br/>
people only had one leg, they would keep  falling over!” “PANTS,” I say.<br/>
<br/>
8:20 Daniel is wearing socks and pants and  nothing else. I tell Christopher<br/>
and Ben to go out and start feeding the dogs  while I dress Daniel.<br/>
<br/>
8:30 I put Emily in her high chair with raisins and  start on breakfast. By<br/>
the time the boys come back in, eggs and toast are  ready. Daniel goes and<br/>
gets his two favorite Lego robots to keep him company.  Ben and Christopher<br/>
ask if they can read at the table. “Yes,” I say, pleased  to see this love<br/>
for words. They produce Bloom County and The Ultimate Guide  to Spiderman:<br/>
His Life and Ways. Oh, well.<br/>
<br/>
9 I clear the table and run  the boys through their chores: Christopher<br/>
vacuums, Ben cleans up Emily’s  room, Daniel sweeps down the steps. He’s<br/>
still sweeping by the time the older  boys are done. I tell Christopher to<br/>
start on his Latin (we always do this  first thing) and Ben to go do his<br/>
reading. Right now he’s reading all the way  through the Little House on the<br/>
Prairie series. He’s up to Farmer Boy; this  has nothing to do with the<br/>
period of history we’re learning, but Ben is going  through a<br/>
comic-book-and-Star-Wars-junior-novel stage, so I’m doing my best  to broaden<br/>
his little horizon.<br/>
<br/>
9:10 Christopher has forgotten all the  Latin he ever knew.<br/>
<br/>
9:15 I tell Christopher to go run around the house.  He goes, sheepishly.<br/>
When he comes back in he says, “Sorry.” “Is your brain  in gear?” I ask.<br/>
“Er,” he says, “mostly.”<br/>
<br/>
9:20 Daniel is still  sweeping the stairs. Christopher has forgotten what a<br/>
direct object is. I  give Emily crayons and paper and trace her hands while I<br/>
make up about fifty  short sentences with direct objects and make Christopher<br/>
identify them.  “Okay, okay,” he says, after sentence forty-five. “I get it.”<br/>
<br/>
9:25 I  explain the passive pluperfect to Christopher. He looks at the forms.<br/>
“You  have to be kidding,” he says.<br/>
<br/>
9:30 Ben emerges, having finished his  chapter, and asks if he can practice<br/>
his piano. “What was your chapter  about?” I say. “They went to a place and<br/>
did something,” he says. “Go back  and read it again,” I say, “and tell me<br/>
where they went and what they  did.”<br/>
<br/>
9:40 Christopher has completed one of his five drill sentences.  Daniel is<br/>
still sweeping the steps. Emily announces, “I have to go potty.” I  take her<br/>
into the bathroom and sit beside her. Christopher yells, “Help!”  “Try to do<br/>
it yourself,” I yell back. There is a long silence. When I come  back to the<br/>
kitchen, he’s on Sentence 2.<br/>
<br/>
9:50 Ben comes back out.  “They went into town and sold WHEAT!” he says<br/>
triumphantly. “Good job,” I  say. “Go practice your piano.” I look up the<br/>
stairs. Daniel is sitting on the  fourth step, sweeping his head with the<br/>
brush. “STAIRS,” I say.<br/>
<br/>
10 AM  Daniel finishes the stairs. “Go get First Language Lessons,” I say.<br/>
Emily is  now under the table tickling Christopher’s feet. “Mom,” Christopher<br/>
says, “I  can’t think.” He is now on Sentence 3.” I say, “Emily, what are <br/>
you<br/>
doing?”  “I loving Pipher,” Emily says.<br/>
<br/>
10:15 Christopher finishes Sentence 5.  “Okay,” I say. “Good job. That only<br/>
took you an hour and ten minutes. Can I  give you a brain massage?” “I think<br/>
I need some sugar,” he says. I feed  everyone cookies and send Christopher to<br/>
practice his trumpet. Emily is  bored; I tell Ben to quit practicing his<br/>
piano and read her a book while I do  Daniel’s grammar. Today, his lesson is<br/>
action verbs. We repeat, “A verb is a  word that does an action, shows state<br/>
of being, links two words, or helps  another verb” five times; then I read<br/>
action verbs while he acts them out.  Ben and Emily abandon their book and<br/>
join in. Christopher appears. “I want to  do it too,” he says. Soon they are<br/>
screaming, jumping, running, yelling,  falling, wrestling, and singing all<br/>
over the house. I try, “Whisper! Sleep!  Think!” These are much less popular<br/>
action verbs.<br/>
<br/>
10:30 I send  everyone outside while I drink a cup of coffee. Christopher<br/>
offers to push  Emily on the swing. While they’re out I look at their school<br/>
lists;  Christopher still has a massive amount of work to do this morning. I<br/>
go  outside too, and Emily and I feed the dogs Milk-Bones through the fence<br/>
while  the boys charge off into the distance.<br/>
<br/>
11 AM I yell, “Time to come in!”  Eventually the boys reappear. “Aw,”<br/>
Christopher says, “we were just getting  going.” “What were you playing?” I<br/>
ask. “Space Age,” he says. “I’m a Space  Age kitty!” Daniel announces.<br/>
Christopher says, “We had to have Space Age  kitties in the game so Daniel<br/>
could play.” Then he stage-whispers, “Ben and I  pretend he’s a Lizardman<br/>
General, but he thinks he’s a kitty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
11:10  Christopher goes back to his trumpet. I put Emily back in her chair<br/>
with her  crayons. She’s not buying it. “Want to go show Grammy my shoes,”<br/>
she says.  “Not right now,” I say. “Ben, go get your grammar.” “Want to show<br/>
Grammy my  ballerina skirt,” she says. “Not right now,” I say. Small silence.<br/>
“Want to  show Grammy my belly,” she suggests. “We’ll go see Grammy later,” <br/>
I<br/>
say. I  put on her ballerina skirt and play “Hall of the Mountain King” on<br/>
the stereo  while she and Daniel run around the room in circles. Meanwhile I<br/>
go through  Ben’s grammar lesson with him; today he’s supposed to diagram<br/>
sentences from  the Rod & Staff fifth-grade book. His grammar has improved<br/>
since we  switched from the A Beka workbooks; he’s a very reluctant writer,<br/>
but for  some reason copying out the exercises from the non-consumable Rod &<br/>
Staff  book has proved easier for him than completing the workbook pages.<br/>
<br/>
11:30  Christopher finishes his trumpet and comes back out. “Reading,” I  <br/>
say.<br/>
“Yeah!” Christopher says and disappears again. He’s reading The Once  and<br/>
Future King, and has announced that it is his VERY FAVORITE BOOK EVER.  This<br/>
warms my heart. I adored this book when I was twelve.<br/>
<br/>
11:40 Ben  has done one of his eight sentences. I give him M&Ms. Sugar is a<br/>
vital  component of the successful home school.<br/>
<br/>
11:45 Emily falls over while  skidding around a corner and starts to bellow.<br/>
I turn off the music, pick her  up, and send Daniel to get his spelling book.<br/>
<br/>
12 noon Ben has done two of  his eight sentences. I set the buzzer and tell<br/>
him that if he’s not finished  in ten minutes, I’ll give him eight more.<br/>
<br/>
12:05 Ben has finished his  grammar lesson. I tell him to play with Emily<br/>
until Dan’s spelling is  finished.<br/>
<br/>
12:20 Christopher’s finished reading. I don’t ask him questions  about The<br/>
Once and Future King; I clearly remember this book taking me into a  universe<br/>
so real that I didn’t want to talk about it. Instead I decide to do  history<br/>
with everyone simultaneously. I give Emily the math pattern blocks,  which<br/>
she pours on the floor and sits on. “These are my eggs,” she says. “I  will<br/>
have a baby chicken. Can I go show Grammy my baby chicken?” “Later,” I  say.<br/>
I tell the boys to get their colored pencils while I clear the table.  We’re<br/>
still doing medieval-renaissance history, because (like a lot of  other<br/>
people) we’re waiting on publication of Vol. 3 of The Story of the  World. I<br/>
give all three boys the map of the Franks and have them color the  three<br/>
separate territories while I read aloud. When I get to Clovis I give  them<br/>
the coloring page of Clovis’s baptism. “Was he really a  Christian?”<br/>
Christopher asks. “He promised to become a Christian before he  even knew<br/>
what Christianity was all about,” I say. “Listen.” I reread the  story of the<br/>
baptism. “What do you think?” I say. “Nope!” Ben says  cheerfully. “We can’<br/>
t<br/>
know for sure,” I say, “but I think the chances are  against it.” Daniel<br/>
says, “Look! He doesn’t have any clothes on in this  picture!”<br/>
<br/>
12:40 I put Ben in front of the Usborne Internet-Linked History  Encyclopedia<br/>
and tell him to read the section on the Franks and write down  the three most<br/>
important things he learns. When I get the Kingfisher History  Encyclopedia<br/>
out, Christopher groans and says, “Do I have to outline today?”  “You can do<br/>
a composition instead,” I say. “About what?” “Er,” I say,  thinking. “Er, <br/>
how<br/>
about comparing Clovis to King Arthur?” “That’s a lot,”  Christopher says,<br/>
dubiously. “You can type it,” I say, “and today you can  make a list of<br/>
comparisons, and then actually finish the composition itself  tomorrow.”<br/>
Christopher agrees and goes off to his room, where he has a  computer (NOT<br/>
connected to the Internet). Daniel says, “Can I go play with  Legos?” “Who<br/>
was the history lesson about?” I ask. “A guy without clothes,”  he says.<br/>
Emily announces, “POTTY!” “Okay,” I say, “go play Legos.”<br/>
<br/>
1  PM Lunch. Christopher has made a list of comparisons, Ben has written  two<br/>
sentences. I tell him to write one more before he can eat. While everyone  is<br/>
stuffing down PBJ and chips, I decide that our diet has too much sugar  and<br/>
salt in it and bring out a bag of baby carrots. “Three for everyone!”  I<br/>
announce. There; that’ll balance out their diets, right?<br/>
<br/>
1:20 PM  It’s rest time. Pete will be back soon to take over school at 3  PM.<br/>
Christopher hasn’t yet done his grammar or his writing. I pull out his  Rod &<br/>
Staff book, review the lesson with him, and tell him to finish it  along with<br/>
his Wordsmith lesson during rest time, before he does anything  else. I’ll<br/>
check it when he’s finished. Christopher’s independence level  (except for<br/>
Latin) has rocketed during this past year; I’m beginning to think  that I<br/>
might actually survive middle school. I settle Emily down for her  rest, send<br/>
Daniel to play with Legos (again) and sit down with Ben and his  Prima<br/>
Latina. Today we’re doing new vocabulary words and new endings. We  talk<br/>
about each word and I give him index cards to make new vocabulary  flash<br/>
cards. “Finish them in your room,” I say, “and then you can listen to  your<br/>
tape and play.” All of the boys are listening to books on tape  during<br/>
naptime; Ben is listening to The Dragonslayers, Daniel to Mrs.  Piggle-Wiggle<br/>
’s Farm, and Christopher to Cheaper by the Dozen.<br/>
<br/>
With  everyone in his room, I sit down to take stock of the morning.<br/>
Christopher  hasn’t done his logic; he has taken a scunner to Jim Nance,<br/>
unfortunately,  and I’m about ready to pitch it and try something else. My<br/>
options are  limited. Maybe I’ll do the Critical Thinking Press books with<br/>
him for a year  and then try to find a tutor. I did Dan’s spelling and<br/>
grammar with him, but  I didn’t get to copywork; my mother usually does some<br/>
handwriting with him  after his afternooon reading lesson, though, so I’ll<br/>
ask her to fold copywork  into her lesson. Although Daniel is seven, he’s a<br/>
young seven (his birthday  is the last week of October), and we’re hovering<br/>
between first and second  grade work with him. I see that Ben was supposed to<br/>
do typing this morning  for me because it’s a heavy math day for Pete, but I<br/>
forgot. I draw an arrow  on his chart over to Pete’s side of the chart and<br/>
write in, “Typing if you  have time?” Just then Emily yells. I go in her<br/>
room. “I had a NIGHTMARE!” she  bellows. “You weren’t asleep,” I tell her. <br/>
At<br/>
three, Emily doesn’t sleep any  more during rest time; she plays with toys on<br/>
her floor. “There was a TALKING  BEAN in my closet!” she announces. “It’s a<br/>
friendly bean,” I say. “It’s time  to get up,” Emily says. “Not yet,” I <br/>
say.<br/>
“Yes, it is. I have to go see  Grammy and tell her about the talking bean.”<br/>
“LATER,” I say. When I go back  out I write on Pete’s side of the school<br/>
chart, “Take Emmy to see Grammy.” I  go upstairs and prop my feet up. In a<br/>
few minutes I need to go work on the  grading I blew off first thing this<br/>
morning. (Rest time comes first,  though.)<br/>

 <br/>
I<br/>
ask. “There  was a dark dark CAVE!” Emily  yells.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
 <br/>
I have this to say about that:<br/>
 <br/>
Holly, at 13, has never had a nightmare.  I found that out the other  night <br/>
when I had one, got up at 2:00 to roam the house and found her still  awake.  <br/>
She let me hang around in her room, tell her my dream, and play  with her rats. <br/>
 She asked me what a nightmare was.<br/>
 <br/>
And a few days before that she had asked me what &quot;ashamed&quot; meant.<br/>
 <br/>
Wow.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-“Mom,” he says, “do you know why this guy is  special?”  “Get<br/>
DRESSED,” I say.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well!<br/>
She never will know, and soon the remaining potential for specialness will  <br/>
fade away with the other silliness of childhood.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-He’s up to Farmer Boy; this  has nothing to do with the<br/>
period  of history we’re learning, but Ben is going  through  a<br/>
comic-book-and-Star-Wars-junior-novel stage, so I’m doing my best  to  broaden<br/>
his little horizon.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Huh.<br/>
Farmer Boy was rather lame, if I recollect correctly.<br/>
Darned if my kids, who have never read it, have BROAD horizons, and not  <br/>
little ones bounded by Latin flashcards.    <br/>
 <br/>
Yet ten minutes ago, as I was microwaving the lunch I just finished, Holly  <br/>
was asking me to definition of &quot;giddy&quot; and how to spell it, because she had <br/>
been  IMing her friend in London who said &quot;gitty&quot; was a kind of alley.  I made up <br/>
 my definition and said I&#39;d never looked it up, though, just learned it from  <br/>
hearing it.  Holly went and got the American Heritage (she had several  <br/>
options, but went for that one) and looked it up.  It had part of my  definition <br/>
(the light-headedness) but not the sudden happiness.  I said  even if that&#39;s not <br/>
a primary definition, it&#39;s not a word to use about traumatic  things or <br/>
death.  There&#39;s a suggestion of joy in it.<br/>
 <br/>
Yesterday she and Kirby were talking about some spelling of some word and  <br/>
she said it was from Greek because of the &quot;ph.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=9:10 Christopher has forgotten all the  Latin he ever knew.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It won&#39;t be the first time, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
If he were learning which English words came from Latin and doing it just  <br/>
for fun, as Holly does, he would not only remember all he had discovered, but be <br/>
 eager to discover more.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I make up about fifty  short sentences with direct objects and  make <br/>
Christopher<br/>
identify them.  “Okay, okay,” he says, after sentence  forty-five. “I get it.<br/>
”-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Probably next week he will have forgotten all the direct objects he ever  <br/>
knew.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-“What was your chapter  about?” I say. “They went to a place  and<br/>
did something,” he says. “Go back  and read it again,” I say, “and  tell me<br/>
where they went and what they  did.”<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
GRoSS!!!  Practicing the piano has to be WAY better than reading a  chapter <br/>
that wasn&#39;t worth a damn in the first place.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=- “I think<br/>
I need some sugar,” he says. I feed  everyone cookies  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I bet they needed protein and freedom.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-We repeat, “A verb is a  word that does an action-=-<br/>
 <br/>
WHAT!?  Verbs just lie there.  They don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; actions.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I tell Ben to quit practicing his<br/>
piano and read her a book while I  do  Daniel’s grammar.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Evil non-music-loving woman.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Soon they are<br/>
screaming, jumping, running, yelling,  falling,  wrestling, and singing all<br/>
over the house. I try, “Whisper! Sleep!   Think!” These are much less popular<br/>
action verbs.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe playing piano could&#39;ve been one.<br/>
Maybe &quot;choosing&quot; or &quot;resting&quot; or &quot;daydreaming.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
-=- he’s a very reluctant writer,<br/>
but for  some reason copying out  the exercises from the non-consumable Rod &<br/>
Staff  book -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I understand the term, but I hate the term &quot;non-consumable&quot; for books, as  <br/>
they are neither eaten nor burned to ashes.  But in the way that a  person might <br/>
consume a book out of eager joyful non-stop reading, I suppose it  makes <br/>
sense that they&#39;re non-consumable.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-11:40 Ben  has done one of his eight sentences. I give him  M&Ms. Sugar is <br/>
a<br/>
vital  component of the successful home  school.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Holy shit.<br/>
Sugar will be a vital component of his life to come.  When he has  cleaned <br/>
the stairs or read or paid the bills or washed the car, he will reward  himself. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-I’m beginning to think  that I<br/>
might actually survive middle  school.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I bet she survived middle school YEARS ago.<br/>
I wonder if her children will survive.<br/>
 <br/>
Too bad she&#39;s more concerned about her own comfort and endurance.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Christopher  hasn’t done his logic;-=-<br/>
<br/>
The parents haven&#39;t done THEIR logic.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-My options are  limited.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Bummer.  And she&#39;s the one doing all the limiting.<br/>
 <br/>
Well that was sad but fun.  Our lives in comparison to hers are  great.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly had asked me to wake her up at 10:30 this morning, so I did.   Marty <br/>
needed to go to the orthodontist for the big plan unveiling (they got his  <br/>
photos and molds all out and showed us the deal, and I signed many  papers).  He <br/>
usually goes to work at 11:00, but came home and ate and then  went.  Holly <br/>
stayed to talk to her friend by IM (which is why she wanted to  get up; they had <br/>
an appointment).  Kirby came home.  He is sleeping at  the dojo while the <br/>
sensei is out of town.  It&#39;s in a bad neighborhood, and  he&#39;s watching movies at <br/>
night, teaching in the daytimes, and coming home to play  Halo II or to go to <br/>
work otherwise.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Doing nothing,&quot; perhaps the Bauer mom would say.<br/>

Okay, I  got to about 9:40 before I completely rebelled and refused to <br/>
read anymore  about their horrid life. I don&#39;t even *want* to know what <br/>
happens next and  how grueling the following hours must be. Argh! Thank <br/>
goodness I don&#39;t  live in that house!<br/>

I absolutely could not finish reading this either.  My sister who  lives next <br/>
door has some of Susan Bauer&#39;s books.  I know she  is very structured with <br/>
their homeschooling lives.  I  shudder to think that even part of  their day <br/>
looks like this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67144604">Kelly - what the **** are you doing reading stuff like this and passing <br/>
it on to us?  I bet tomorrow morning there will be hundreds of <br/>
unschooling mothers waking screaming from nightmares:  &quot;I was trapped in <br/>
a cave with Susan Wise Bauer and a ravenging hoarde of Passive <br/>
Plueperfects!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have we all got the support we need when we wake from this nightmare? <br/>
 Or will our partners and / or children just tell us, &quot;Pull your self <br/>
together, it&#39;s only make believe. Get a grip. Suck on this bottle of <br/>
whisky and go back to sleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I used to think that I pushed my eldest son too much when we <br/>
started homeschooling years ago - ha!  Push! I don&#39;t know the meaning of <br/>
the word! What i now call homeschooling and pushing, I think this woman <br/>
would call neglect!  let alone what she would thing of unschooling!<br/>

I had AP English and tested out of college English.  I took college<br/>
honors English classes anyway because it was interesting.  I wrote<br/>
numerous grade-A papers and a B.S. and M.S. thesis.  I&#39;ve published<br/>
articles in major scientific journals.  <br/>
 <br/>
All this to preface and emphasize that I haven&#39;t got a freaking clue<br/>
what passive pluperfect is, nor did the lack of learning it (at 12,<br/>
even!) keep me from attaining all sorts of academic success.  I&#39;m<br/>
astounded that people actually think cramming this stuff into kids is<br/>
important.  I bet they would think I&#39;m the one who&#39;s missing out, too.<br/>
Argh.  I wonder how many laps around the house that poor kid will have<br/>

 <br/>
Huh.<br/>
Farmer Boy was rather lame, if I recollect correctly.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We recently re-read through the Little House series, mostly me reading aloud to the kids at bedtime.  I had read it to them once before, about 6 years ago.  I was amazed at how many details were different than I remembered.  We all thought Ma was mean, but also discussed that the author focused on Laura and Pa, not really developing Ma as a character.  About all she ever said was, &quot;Oh Charles!&quot;  For awhile, any one of us saying that would make us all laugh.<br/>
<br/>
When we got to Farmer Boy, the girls asked me to skip it.  So I did.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A Morning in the Bauer Home School<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; by Susan Wise  Bauer<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Classical education with four children aged 12, 10, 7, and  3.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5 AM I get up and go downstairs for coffee. Okay, I know this is  <br/>
&gt; revoltingly<br/>
&gt; early, but I’ve discovered that getting up early and finishing up  my <br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; jobs allows me to lie on the sofa like a slug in the evenings after  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; children go to bed. This fall, I’m teaching two classes at William &  <br/>
&gt; Mary,<br/>
&gt; so I have plenty of grading to do. This morning, I blow the grading <br/>
&gt; off  and<br/>
&gt; work on my newest writing project instead: W. W. Norton has asked me  <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; write a history of the world for grown-ups. The Assyrian Kings List  is<br/>
&gt; remarkably hard to convert into stirring narrative.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7 AM Emily  wails. I go into her room; she’s sitting up in bed <br/>
&gt; clutching her<br/>
&gt; blanket. “I  had a nightmare!” she screams when she sees me. “What was <br/>
&gt; it?”<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; ask. “There  was a dark dark CAVE!” Emily yells. “I was in a dark dark <br/>
&gt; CAVE!”<br/>
&gt; “It was just  pretend,” I say; this is my usual response, but she’s not<br/>
&gt; buying it today.  “It was DARK!” she says, accusingly. So I turn on <br/>
&gt; her lamp.<br/>
&gt; “Were you all  alone in the cave?” I ask. “No,” she says, in a voice of<br/>
&gt; doom.<br/>
&gt; “ALL OF THE  BROTHERS were there!” Hmm. I’m not sure whether that’s <br/>
&gt; part of<br/>
&gt; the nightmare  or not. I lay her down, change her diaper, and give her <br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; bottle (I know,  three is too old for a bottle, but she’ll drink it <br/>
&gt; and go<br/>
&gt; straight back to  sleep).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 7:30 AM Shower, dress, dry hair, put on shoes. This isn’t one of  my <br/>
&gt; William<br/>
&gt; & Mary days, so we have a lot of school to get through. My  husband <br/>
&gt; Peter<br/>
&gt; will take over at 3 PM to do math, geography, and handwriting;  he’ll <br/>
&gt; send<br/>
&gt; Daniel (7) over to see my mother for a reading lesson and he’ll  <br/>
&gt; supervise<br/>
&gt; some of the tasks that Christopher (12) and Ben (10)) can do on  their <br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; (typing, Latin vocabulary cards, spelling worksheets).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8 PM  I go get everyone up. Christopher is already up reading; he’s an <br/>
&gt; early<br/>
&gt; riser  and has already been out to do some of his chores. Ben is sound<br/>
&gt; asleep; he’s  a late riser, and when I try to wake him up he curls <br/>
&gt; into a<br/>
&gt; ball and puts his  head under his knees. I get Emily and put her in <br/>
&gt; his bed.<br/>
&gt; Daniel comes out of  his room and stands in the middle of the floor. <br/>
&gt; “Time to<br/>
&gt; get dressed,” I say.  “I don’t have any clothes,” he says. I walk him <br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; his room, take out  his clothes and put them in a stack on the floor. <br/>
&gt; He<br/>
&gt; looks at them. “Oh,” he  says. “Those clothes.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:10 Christopher is waiting by the door to go out.  All three boys <br/>
&gt; generally<br/>
&gt; take the dogs for a long walk before breakfast; we  live on a farm, <br/>
&gt; but since<br/>
&gt; it’s hunting season, we keep the dogs in their pen  for most of the <br/>
&gt; day. Ben<br/>
&gt; is dressing. Emily is in the middle of Ben’s bed  making a stuffed <br/>
&gt; animal<br/>
&gt; pyramid. Daniel comes out of his room with no clothes  on and a Lego <br/>
&gt; robot in<br/>
&gt; one hand. “Mom,” he says, “do you know why this guy is  special?” “Get<br/>
&gt; DRESSED,” I say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:15 Ben and Christopher are standing  by the door. Daniel hops out of <br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; room on one foot, wearing two socks and  nothing else. “Mom!” he says. <br/>
&gt; “If<br/>
&gt; people only had one leg, they would keep  falling over!” “PANTS,” I <br/>
&gt; say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:20 Daniel is wearing socks and pants and  nothing else. I tell <br/>
&gt; Christopher<br/>
&gt; and Ben to go out and start feeding the dogs  while I dress Daniel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 8:30 I put Emily in her high chair with raisins and  start on <br/>
&gt; breakfast. By<br/>
&gt; the time the boys come back in, eggs and toast are  ready. Daniel goes <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; gets his two favorite Lego robots to keep him company.  Ben and <br/>
&gt; Christopher<br/>
&gt; ask if they can read at the table. “Yes,” I say, pleased  to see this <br/>
&gt; love<br/>
&gt; for words. They produce Bloom County and The Ultimate Guide  to <br/>
&gt; Spiderman:<br/>
&gt; His Life and Ways. Oh, well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9 I clear the table and run  the boys through their chores: Christopher<br/>
&gt; vacuums, Ben cleans up Emily’s  room, Daniel sweeps down the steps. <br/>
&gt; He’s<br/>
&gt; still sweeping by the time the older  boys are done. I tell <br/>
&gt; Christopher to<br/>
&gt; start on his Latin (we always do this  first thing) and Ben to go do <br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; reading. Right now he’s reading all the way  through the Little House <br/>
&gt; on the<br/>
&gt; Prairie series. He’s up to Farmer Boy; this  has nothing to do with the<br/>
&gt; period of history we’re learning, but Ben is going  through a<br/>
&gt; comic-book-and-Star-Wars-junior-novel stage, so I’m doing my best  to <br/>
&gt; broaden<br/>
&gt; his little horizon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:10 Christopher has forgotten all the  Latin he ever knew.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:15 I tell Christopher to go run around the house.  He goes, <br/>
&gt; sheepishly.<br/>
&gt; When he comes back in he says, “Sorry.” “Is your brain  in gear?” I <br/>
&gt; ask.<br/>
&gt; “Er,” he says, “mostly.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:20 Daniel is still  sweeping the stairs. Christopher has forgotten <br/>
&gt; what a<br/>
&gt; direct object is. I  give Emily crayons and paper and trace her hands <br/>
&gt; while I<br/>
&gt; make up about fifty  short sentences with direct objects and make <br/>
&gt; Christopher<br/>
&gt; identify them.  “Okay, okay,” he says, after sentence forty-five. “I <br/>
&gt; get it.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:25 I  explain the passive pluperfect to Christopher. He looks at the <br/>
&gt; forms.<br/>
&gt; “You  have to be kidding,” he says.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:30 Ben emerges, having finished his  chapter, and asks if he can <br/>
&gt; practice<br/>
&gt; his piano. “What was your chapter  about?” I say. “They went to a <br/>
&gt; place and<br/>
&gt; did something,” he says. “Go back  and read it again,” I say, “and <br/>
&gt; tell me<br/>
&gt; where they went and what they  did.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:40 Christopher has completed one of his five drill sentences.  <br/>
&gt; Daniel is<br/>
&gt; still sweeping the steps. Emily announces, “I have to go potty.” I  <br/>
&gt; take her<br/>
&gt; into the bathroom and sit beside her. Christopher yells, “Help!”  “Try <br/>
&gt; to do<br/>
&gt; it yourself,” I yell back. There is a long silence. When I come  back <br/>
&gt; to the<br/>
&gt; kitchen, he’s on Sentence 2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 9:50 Ben comes back out.  “They went into town and sold WHEAT!” he says<br/>
&gt; triumphantly. “Good job,” I  say. “Go practice your piano.” I look up <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; stairs. Daniel is sitting on the  fourth step, sweeping his head with <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; brush. “STAIRS,” I say.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10 AM  Daniel finishes the stairs. “Go get First Language Lessons,” I <br/>
&gt; say.<br/>
&gt; Emily is  now under the table tickling Christopher’s feet. “Mom,” <br/>
&gt; Christopher<br/>
&gt; says, “I  can’t think.” He is now on Sentence 3.” I say, “Emily, what <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; doing?”  “I loving Pipher,” Emily says.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10:15 Christopher finishes Sentence 5.  “Okay,” I say. “Good job. That <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; took you an hour and ten minutes. Can I  give you a brain massage?” “I <br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; I need some sugar,” he says. I feed  everyone cookies and send <br/>
&gt; Christopher to<br/>
&gt; practice his trumpet. Emily is  bored; I tell Ben to quit practicing <br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt; piano and read her a book while I do  Daniel’s grammar. Today, his <br/>
&gt; lesson is<br/>
&gt; action verbs. We repeat, “A verb is a  word that does an action, shows <br/>
&gt; state<br/>
&gt; of being, links two words, or helps  another verb” five times; then I <br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; action verbs while he acts them out.  Ben and Emily abandon their book <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; join in. Christopher appears. “I want to  do it too,” he says. Soon <br/>
&gt; they are<br/>
&gt; screaming, jumping, running, yelling,  falling, wrestling, and singing <br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; over the house. I try, “Whisper! Sleep!  Think!” These are much less <br/>
&gt; popular<br/>
&gt; action verbs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 10:30 I send  everyone outside while I drink a cup of coffee. <br/>
&gt; Christopher<br/>
&gt; offers to push  Emily on the swing. While they’re out I look at their <br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt; lists;  Christopher still has a massive amount of work to do this <br/>
&gt; morning. I<br/>
&gt; go  outside too, and Emily and I feed the dogs Milk-Bones through the <br/>
&gt; fence<br/>
&gt; while  the boys charge off into the distance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11 AM I yell, “Time to come in!”  Eventually the boys reappear. “Aw,”<br/>
&gt; Christopher says, “we were just getting  going.” “What were you <br/>
&gt; playing?” I<br/>
&gt; ask. “Space Age,” he says. “I’m a Space  Age kitty!” Daniel announces.<br/>
&gt; Christopher says, “We had to have Space Age  kitties in the game so <br/>
&gt; Daniel<br/>
&gt; could play.” Then he stage-whispers, “Ben and I  pretend he’s a <br/>
&gt; Lizardman<br/>
&gt; General, but he thinks he’s a kitty.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11:10  Christopher goes back to his trumpet. I put Emily back in her <br/>
&gt; chair<br/>
&gt; with her  crayons. She’s not buying it. “Want to go show Grammy my <br/>
&gt; shoes,”<br/>
&gt; she says.  “Not right now,” I say. “Ben, go get your grammar.” “Want <br/>
&gt; to show<br/>
&gt; Grammy my  ballerina skirt,” she says. “Not right now,” I say. Small <br/>
&gt; silence.<br/>
&gt; “Want to  show Grammy my belly,” she suggests. “We’ll go see Grammy <br/>
&gt; later,”<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; say. I  put on her ballerina skirt and play “Hall of the Mountain <br/>
&gt; King” on<br/>
&gt; the stereo  while she and Daniel run around the room in circles. <br/>
&gt; Meanwhile I<br/>
&gt; go through  Ben’s grammar lesson with him; today he’s supposed to <br/>
&gt; diagram<br/>
&gt; sentences from  the Rod & Staff fifth-grade book. His grammar has <br/>
&gt; improved<br/>
&gt; since we  switched from the A Beka workbooks; he’s a very reluctant <br/>
&gt; writer,<br/>
&gt; but for  some reason copying out the exercises from the non-consumable <br/>
&gt; Rod &<br/>
&gt; Staff  book has proved easier for him than completing the workbook <br/>
&gt; pages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11:30  Christopher finishes his trumpet and comes back out. “Reading,” <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; say.<br/>
&gt; “Yeah!” Christopher says and disappears again. He’s reading The Once  <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Future King, and has announced that it is his VERY FAVORITE BOOK EVER. <br/>
&gt;  This<br/>
&gt; warms my heart. I adored this book when I was twelve.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11:40 Ben  has done one of his eight sentences. I give him M&Ms. Sugar <br/>
&gt; is a<br/>
&gt; vital  component of the successful home school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 11:45 Emily falls over while  skidding around a corner and starts to <br/>
&gt; bellow.<br/>
&gt; I turn off the music, pick her  up, and send Daniel to get his <br/>
&gt; spelling book.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12 noon Ben has done two of  his eight sentences. I set the buzzer and <br/>
&gt; tell<br/>
&gt; him that if he’s not finished  in ten minutes, I’ll give him eight <br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:05 Ben has finished his  grammar lesson. I tell him to play with <br/>
&gt; Emily<br/>
&gt; until Dan’s spelling is  finished.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:20 Christopher’s finished reading. I don’t ask him questions  about <br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; Once and Future King; I clearly remember this book taking me into a  <br/>
&gt; universe<br/>
&gt; so real that I didn’t want to talk about it. Instead I decide to do  <br/>
&gt; history<br/>
&gt; with everyone simultaneously. I give Emily the math pattern blocks,  <br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; she pours on the floor and sits on. “These are my eggs,” she says. “I  <br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; have a baby chicken. Can I go show Grammy my baby chicken?” “Later,” I <br/>
&gt;  say.<br/>
&gt; I tell the boys to get their colored pencils while I clear the table.  <br/>
&gt; We’re<br/>
&gt; still doing medieval-renaissance history, because (like a lot of  other<br/>
&gt; people) we’re waiting on publication of Vol. 3 of The Story of the  <br/>
&gt; World. I<br/>
&gt; give all three boys the map of the Franks and have them color the  <br/>
&gt; three<br/>
&gt; separate territories while I read aloud. When I get to Clovis I give  <br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; the coloring page of Clovis’s baptism. “Was he really a  Christian?”<br/>
&gt; Christopher asks. “He promised to become a Christian before he  even <br/>
&gt; knew<br/>
&gt; what Christianity was all about,” I say. “Listen.” I reread the  story <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; baptism. “What do you think?” I say. “Nope!” Ben says  cheerfully. “We <br/>
&gt; can’<br/>
&gt; t<br/>
&gt; know for sure,” I say, “but I think the chances are  against it.” <br/>
&gt; Daniel<br/>
&gt; says, “Look! He doesn’t have any clothes on in this  picture!”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 12:40 I put Ben in front of the Usborne Internet-Linked History  <br/>
&gt; Encyclopedia<br/>
&gt; and tell him to read the section on the Franks and write down  the <br/>
&gt; three most<br/>
&gt; important things he learns. When I get the Kingfisher History  <br/>
&gt; Encyclopedia<br/>
&gt; out, Christopher groans and says, “Do I have to outline today?”  “You <br/>
&gt; can do<br/>
&gt; a composition instead,” I say. “About what?” “Er,” I say,  thinking. <br/>
&gt; “Er,<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; about comparing Clovis to King Arthur?” “That’s a lot,”  Christopher <br/>
&gt; says,<br/>
&gt; dubiously. “You can type it,” I say, “and today you can  make a list of<br/>
&gt; comparisons, and then actually finish the composition itself  <br/>
&gt; tomorrow.”<br/>
&gt; Christopher agrees and goes off to his room, where he has a  computer <br/>
&gt; (NOT<br/>
&gt; connected to the Internet). Daniel says, “Can I go play with  Legos?” <br/>
&gt; “Who<br/>
&gt; was the history lesson about?” I ask. “A guy without clothes,”  he <br/>
&gt; says.<br/>
&gt; Emily announces, “POTTY!” “Okay,” I say, “go play Legos.”<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1  PM Lunch. Christopher has made a list of comparisons, Ben has <br/>
&gt; written  two<br/>
&gt; sentences. I tell him to write one more before he can eat. While <br/>
&gt; everyone  is<br/>
&gt; stuffing down PBJ and chips, I decide that our diet has too much sugar <br/>
&gt;  and<br/>
&gt; salt in it and bring out a bag of baby carrots. “Three for everyone!”  <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; announce. There; that’ll balance out their diets, right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1:20 PM  It’s rest time. Pete will be back soon to take over school at <br/>
&gt; 3  PM.<br/>
&gt; Christopher hasn’t yet done his grammar or his writing. I pull out his <br/>
&gt;  Rod &<br/>
&gt; Staff book, review the lesson with him, and tell him to finish it  <br/>
&gt; along with<br/>
&gt; his Wordsmith lesson during rest time, before he does anything  else. <br/>
&gt; I’ll<br/>
&gt; check it when he’s finished. Christopher’s independence level  (except <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; Latin) has rocketed during this past year; I’m beginning to think  <br/>
&gt; that I<br/>
&gt; might actually survive middle school. I settle Emily down for her  <br/>
&gt; rest, send<br/>
&gt; Daniel to play with Legos (again) and sit down with Ben and his  Prima<br/>
&gt; Latina. Today we’re doing new vocabulary words and new endings. We  <br/>
&gt; talk<br/>
&gt; about each word and I give him index cards to make new vocabulary  <br/>
&gt; flash<br/>
&gt; cards. “Finish them in your room,” I say, “and then you can listen to  <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; tape and play.” All of the boys are listening to books on tape  during<br/>
&gt; naptime; Ben is listening to The Dragonslayers, Daniel to Mrs.  <br/>
&gt; Piggle-Wiggle<br/>
&gt; ’s Farm, and Christopher to Cheaper by the Dozen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With  everyone in his room, I sit down to take stock of the morning.<br/>
&gt; Christopher  hasn’t done his logic; he has taken a scunner to Jim <br/>
&gt; Nance,<br/>
&gt; unfortunately,  and I’m about ready to pitch it and try something <br/>
&gt; else. My<br/>
&gt; options are  limited. Maybe I’ll do the Critical Thinking Press books <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; him for a year  and then try to find a tutor. I did Dan’s spelling and<br/>
&gt; grammar with him, but  I didn’t get to copywork; my mother usually <br/>
&gt; does some<br/>
&gt; handwriting with him  after his afternooon reading lesson, though, so <br/>
&gt; I’ll<br/>
&gt; ask her to fold copywork  into her lesson. Although Daniel is seven, <br/>
&gt; he’s a<br/>
&gt; young seven (his birthday  is the last week of October), and we’re <br/>
&gt; hovering<br/>
&gt; between first and second  grade work with him. I see that Ben was <br/>
&gt; supposed to<br/>
&gt; do typing this morning  for me because it’s a heavy math day for Pete, <br/>
&gt; but I<br/>
&gt; forgot. I draw an arrow  on his chart over to Pete’s side of the chart <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; write in, “Typing if you  have time?” Just then Emily yells. I go in <br/>
&gt; her<br/>
&gt; room. “I had a NIGHTMARE!” she  bellows. “You weren’t asleep,” I tell <br/>
&gt; her.<br/>
&gt; At<br/>
&gt; three, Emily doesn’t sleep any  more during rest time; she plays with <br/>
&gt; toys on<br/>
&gt; her floor. “There was a TALKING  BEAN in my closet!” she announces. <br/>
&gt; “It’s a<br/>
&gt; friendly bean,” I say. “It’s time  to get up,” Emily says. “Not yet,” I<br/>
&gt; say.<br/>
&gt; “Yes, it is. I have to go see  Grammy and tell her about the talking <br/>
&gt; bean.”<br/>
&gt; “LATER,” I say. When I go back  out I write on Pete’s side of the <br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt; chart, “Take Emmy to see Grammy.” I  go upstairs and prop my feet up. <br/>
&gt; In a<br/>
&gt; few minutes I need to go work on the  grading I blew off first thing <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; morning. (Rest time comes first,  though.)<br/>

Those poor children!  Especially Daniel -- an hour sweeping the stairs!?  I want to rescue him and tell him that at my house he could frolic naked on the unswept stair all day.  <br/>

She witholds food until Ben&#39;s work is done, and threatens to assign more work if the work already given isn&#39;t done?  And all those one word commands yelled at the children.  In her own word, not once did she say a kind word to any of those children in 5 hrs time.  Not one I love you, no praise for work well done.  Just &#39;have you done that yet -- okay, here&#39;s more to do&#39;  <br/>

 Those sweet kids.All those beautiful, memorable moments that could have<br/>
been and never will.<br/>
<br/>
It made me think about something Sandra says on the Peaceful Parenting tape<br/>
(I think) about wasting our relationship on what they do with their<br/>
toothbrush between times. Those words have really stuck in my mind and have<br/>
helped me stop saying unneccessary controlling stuff. I just breathe and<br/>
remind myself  it&#39;s not that important.<br/>
<br/>
When I look back over the past year, I&#39;m so thankful that we have had time<br/>
to hug and share jokes and eat chocolate cake for breakfast if we want. A<br/>
couple of days ago, Mia (5) and Jacob (8) were playing with these little sea<br/>
creatures from their Christmas crackers. They filled an empty container with<br/>
water and played on the table for a little while then asked for something<br/>
bigger. So I got them a tub which they filled and played with on the floor<br/>
for an hour, collecting all sorts of stuff to make a mini ocean. That tub<br/>
became too small so I found them a really big one and they collected rocks<br/>
from outside and turned it into a lake for their creatures and their<br/>
dinosaurs. At 2pm (some hours later) they realized they hadn&#39;t eaten lunch<br/>
so I made them something to eat. They had such a great time together.<br/>
<br/>
Just an ordinary day really but after reading that, it&#39;s sounding pretty<br/>
special.<br/>

UGH!<br/>
I missed that bit.<br/>
I hate that oh so snotty tone that some folks get when they discuss such <br/>
lowly things as comics or Harry Potter.<br/>
Within the comic genre new myths are created everyday, old Gods <br/>
resurected and another hero is sent on yet another quest. Superheros <br/>
inspire and the good guys do win. Comics run from funny to inspiring to <br/>
horror to disqusting. Now I perfer my comics to be darker and with more <br/>
complex charecters like John Constaintine, Swamp Thing, Wolverine or The <br/>
Sandman. A  touch of the supernaturel is really great. magic is good....<br/>
Why do folks think that because there is art along with the words <br/>
(Sequential art as Will Eisner, who died last week, named it) it is <br/>
somehow a lesser form of storytelling? &quot;From Hell&quot; even had footnotes, <br/>
for heavens sake.....<br/>
Of course some of it sucks but there is a ton of books out there that <br/>
suck so bad (Farmer Boy, anyone? Boring...There are better books out <br/>
there that describe that time and life) and they don&#39;t even have cool <br/>
art to help you make it through.<br/>
Right now my ds (who is 12, hates reading and might read on a early <br/>
third grade level) is beginning to work though (his own idea) the whole <br/>
75 issues of The Sandman.<br/>
Of course I&#39;m reading it with him because: A. it is a comic for adults <br/>
and will need my explinations and to feed him words and B. God I just <br/>
love these!<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve mentioned before what a total Neil Gaiman fangirl I am. <br/>
The man is a writing God.<br/>
Within this story arc he will encounter: Loki, Thor, Marco Polo, G.K. <br/>
Chesterton (of course as a man and land mass), The Godess Bast, <br/>
Shakesphere (along with his son, wife and daughter) The Hectate (Madien, <br/>
Mother, Crone among other incarnations), Lucifer,  Orpheus and Eurydice, <br/>
Hades and Persephone, Eve, Cain and Able, Muses, The Emporer of the <br/>
United States, The Furies, Auberon and Titania...well you get the idea. <br/>
But with all that and the tangents we can go off on, people like Ms. <br/>
Bauer would look down on that as time not well spent.<br/>
Luckily her opinion is not one I care about.<br/>
<br/>
That is we&#39;ll do it after we play HeroScape again.<br/>
Cool game.<br/>
Fun Times.<br/>

since he was little, he has thousands of them, and still collects <br/>
them (he&#39;s 34). Everytime i drive him to the comic shop, there are <br/>
only adults in there, never kids. And there is a HUGE online comic-<br/>
fan community, with people who have alot of knowledge of the genre. <br/>
His love of comics led him to Old Time Radio, and he&#39;s even <br/>
corresponded with people who&#39;ve written books on the subject. One of <br/>
his major projects is collecting old radio shows onto disc(MP3? i <br/>
dunno), and he lately has been buying original art from one of his <br/>
favorite comic artists. He posted somewhere (a msg board i think)<br/>
something about one comic, questioning whether the penciller was one <br/>
guy or another, and the artist actually emailed him to discuss it. <br/>
Pretty cool. I think most people dont know that very often, with a <br/>
comic, one person does the story, another the lettering, another the <br/>
artwork, etc. There is SO much information in that one &quot;little <br/>
phase&quot; of comics.<br/>
<br/>
How different this mother is from me, who actually encourages <br/>
Seamus&#39; comic reading (i was hoping he might get more into reading <br/>
by reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics, and he did, for awhile), is <br/>
willing to buy him any comic he wants, and my brother will often <br/>
pull out issues with interesting stories, and read them out loud to <br/>
my son. Very happy, very positive, lots of learning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-739811720">Now I perfer my comics to be darker and with more<br/>

&gt; Sandman. A  touch of the supernaturel is really great. magic is good....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was a superhero freak myself - and there&#39;s some brilliant stuff in the<br/>
genre. Chris Claremont&#39;s work on X-Men, Louise Simonson on Thor was great,<br/>
Anne...Anne something on Daredevil and gosh, go dig up old copies of<br/>
Strikeforce Morituri (Can you tell I was a Marvel fan?). It&#39;s funny how the<br/>
Greek, Norse, etc myths are revered but we can&#39;t recognize the modern<br/>
equivilent to those sagas in our own culture. For some a really beautiful<br/>
example of how good an ordinary comic can be pick up Astonishing X-men. I<br/>
haven&#39;t bought a comic book in ages (no one seems to sell them but the comic<br/>
stores anymore!) but keep up to date with Wizard and recently dug up all my<br/>
old books (Alpha Flight - Canada&#39;s own team and proud to have had the first<br/>
mainstream gay hero). But Astonishing X-Men (Joss Whedon of Buffy fame is<br/>
writing this title) is going to lure me out I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476966112">The recent post about comic books and such, made me remember one of my<br/>
most prized possessions.:)<br/>
My David Mack comic books! Yes, I still adore comic books, but these<br/>
particular ones are absolutely beautiful. His art is not typical for a<br/>
comic book, but more collage style, with incredible drawings swirled<br/>
through.<br/>
They aren&#39;t laid out in typical format either. The story lines are<br/>
very Japanese influenced. His &quot;Alchemy&quot; series are the ones I&#39;ve been<br/>
collecting, you can also get some of the older ones in book form.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you folks that love art and have thought comics where<br/>
inferior, should really take a look at these. They&#39;re amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an interview with him and a few shots of the<br/>
art.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/107352351149206.htm">http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/107352351149206.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
David Mack quote:<br/>
~I don&#39;t have a style. I never have. If someone looks at one thing I<br/>
did and decides to call that particular piece &#39;my style,&#39; that is<br/>
between them and reality.~<br/>

<br/>
This is the cover story in the Entertainment Weekly that came in the <br/>
mail yesterday.  Look for Natalie Portman on the cover.  (And for any of <br/>
you that have seen pictures of Ms. Portman looking like she had her head <br/>
shaved recently, this is why.)<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this graphic novel (and now movie) is very political.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045241937">Hi, thanks Betsy<br/>
                   I don&#39;t know who Natalie Portman is, I&#39;m assuming <br/>
she&#39;s an actress? I should&#39;ve said I&#39;m in the UK, not sure if we get <br/>
Entertainment weekly here. I&#39;m from the same region (The Midlands) as <br/>
Alan Moore (author of V for Vendetta), he&#39;s just a bit further south <br/>
than me.<br/>
