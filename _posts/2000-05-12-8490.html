<div id="ygrps-yiv-784677910">Hi everyone,  this came from the unschooling list I am on .  Please read <br/>
this and maybe forward on.  Thanks,   ~Karen                                    <br/>
                                                                                <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply">  &gt;--- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cbirth@egroups.com">cbirth@egroups.com</a>, &quot;Judith Gips&quot; &lt;comadre@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>
 &gt;my friend Patty is fighting the CPS in Alameda County CA for seizing<br/>
 &gt;her<br/>
 &gt;children because a relative of the children&#39;s father (their father is<br/>
 &gt;a<br/>
 &gt;sometimes violent homeless man who has no chance of gaining custody<br/>
 &gt;of his<br/>
 &gt;sons) reported that the 9 year old twin boys were &quot;socially isolated&quot;<br/>
 &gt;and<br/>
 &gt;&quot;unable to relate to anyone but their mother.&quot; the children have been<br/>
 &gt;in<br/>
 &gt;three placements in the past several weeks. I know these children<br/>
 &gt;from the<br/>
 &gt;Berkeley YMCA, where they swim, play basketball, join group arts and<br/>
 &gt;crafts<br/>
 &gt;projects, and generally are a part of the community. Please read and<br/>
 &gt;circulate this letter - it is a lesson in the absurd, and it could<br/>
 &gt;happen to<br/>
 &gt;anyone. Patty is a down to earth older mother who gave birth to twins<br/>
 &gt;at age<br/>
 &gt;45 after long term infertility, and she has been following the<br/>
 &gt;Independent<br/>
 &gt;Studies curriculum supervised by the Berkeley Unified School District.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;Needless to say this has not increased my respect for the child rescue<br/>
 &gt;establishment. Homeschooling is not the only item that could generate<br/>
 &gt;such a<br/>
 &gt;bizarre set of events - any over-zealous neighbor or social worker who<br/>
 &gt;doesn&#39;t like your religion or lack thereof, your family bed, your<br/>
 &gt;letting<br/>
 &gt;children play naked in the backyard, your messy house, diet, longterm<br/>
 &gt;breastfeeding, style of dress or choice of family acctivities could<br/>
 &gt;get<br/>
 &gt;something like this nightmare going. Official documents blame<br/>
 &gt;Ptaricia for<br/>
 &gt;using &quot;manipulative charm&quot; with the children because she told<br/>
 &gt;them, &quot;Smile<br/>
 &gt;and tell the truth if anyone asks you questions.&quot;<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;Please note that a legal defense fund has been established on Patty&#39;s<br/>
 &gt;behalf<br/>
 &gt;- if you or anyone or any group you trust could contribute even a<br/>
 &gt;little, it<br/>
 &gt;would be wonderful. Thanks, friends, Judith<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
