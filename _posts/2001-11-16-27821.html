<div id="ygrps-yiv-1216546023">I&#39;d like to very politely request that subject lines stop being changed to<br/>
bash people. I think it&#39;s really, really, REALLY rude (and I&#39;ve read all the<br/>
Miss Manners books several times) to top a whole thread of messages with<br/>
something snarky directed at one person.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can someone please explain to me why Sandra can say just about<br/>
&gt; anything she wants here, including subtly bashing one&#39;s entire gender<br/>
&gt; with something like, &quot;And it is easy for some parents, especially<br/>
&gt; dads, to expect more of children than they are emotionally and<br/>
&gt; intellectually ready to understand.&quot; and not one of you calls her on<br/>
&gt; it.  Yet when she insults someone to the point where they get nasty<br/>
&gt; back you are right there to jump in and defend her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She has paid off the entire list in gold doubloons. She is not really Sandra<br/>
Dodd at all, you see, mild-mannered SCA unschooling Mom. She is actually<br/>
Hugh Heffner, posing as Sandra from her (I mean his) mansion retreat.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of an odd question, isn&#39;t it? What do you think is the answer?<br/>
<br/>
But, sure, I&#39;ll play too:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;And it is easy for some parents, especially<br/>
&gt; dads, to expect more of children than they are emotionally and<br/>
&gt; intellectually ready to understand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The qualifier is SOME PARENTS.<br/>
<br/>
The use of qualifiers (I think, I believe, in my experience, sometimes, some<br/>
people, some parents, some dogs, etc.) is what makes the difference.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the &quot;especially dads&quot; part, it still is qualified by the some, and<br/>
I happen to agree with her. I&#39;m not a great one for politically correct, I&#39;m<br/>
afraid. I think men and women are often different, in parenting and out of<br/>
it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1756439721"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ...something snarky directed at one person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guilty.  I was snarky and I&#39;m sorry.  I apologize to the one I<br/>
snarked.  <br/>
I&#39;m sorry Bridget.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She has paid off the entire list in gold doubloons.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now this is just truly and deeply wrong.  She paid me with chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Pam,<br/>
I am humbled.<br/>
