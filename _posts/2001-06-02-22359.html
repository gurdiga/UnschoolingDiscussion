what does bother me is the way they are shoved in my face when I do not want <br/>

rebellion factor of shoving it in our faces and down our throats just to<br/>
prove they *can* with no thought about whether they *should*.<br/>

I sure wish I could find a good filter.  Anyone with suggestions for a<br/>
filter that will keep out obvious porn while allowing reasonable access for<br/>
research options like medical sites?  For now we&#39;ve been having the kidlet<br/>

AOL) and I&#39;m getting a bit tired of doing that.<br/>

  We have filtered access.  I do not know where you are located but I will<br/>
give you the phone # and you can call and see if they have service in your<br/>
area. The filterer is Veracom.  The # is 877-227-2332.<br/>
It filters out porn and has listing for medical sites on its home page. <br/>
Good Luck!! <br/>

plan.  If you have access to the internet (through cable or whatever), AOL<br/>
is only $10 (??) extra which will save you a few bucks while you search for<br/>
a filter.  (They also have an AOL mail plan so you can get just the mail<br/>
feature for $4 or so.)  The information should be in the Help area about<br/>
access but of course you need to know about it in order to think to check it<br/>
out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-454028290">I agree. This is one of the reasons I do not let my children surf the web unsupervised. I accessed a porn site through a search on child education. Part of it is the addictiveness of it. I wonder how many people have become addicted to porn who were not originally intending to use the web for porn? I think some of these people do it to try to lure more people into their perversions.<br/>
