<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705939274">I really think it depends on the child.  Adriane (12) takes lots of classes<br/>
and such.  She is at gymnastics 7 hours a week, karate 2 hours, dog training<br/>
1 hour.  She is in 4-H and is a club officer and a council delegate.  She is<br/>
in the rabbit project, goat project, sewing project and organic gardening<br/>
project.  She is co-chair of the Youth Day committee.  But she LOVES it.<br/>
She keeps up with her schedule, she knows she can quit anything at any time.<br/>
Adriane needs the social stimulation (think the Olsen twins but nicer and<br/>
that is Adriane).<br/>
<br/>
Zach is 10. He plays baseball during season and takes karate a couple of<br/>
times a week.  He is in 4-H but isn&#39;t interested in doing anything but<br/>
raising his goat.  Zach likes to have lots of free time to interact with<br/>
objects in motion through space (any object, any space).<br/>
<br/>
Marsie is 6 and takes a gymnastics class once a week.  She likes being in<br/>
flux, going from activity to activity as she sees fit (something that<br/>
doesn&#39;t jive too well with classes).<br/>
<br/>
If I hear of a class I think the kids might like, or a movie they might<br/>
like, or a museum exhibit they might like, etc., I ask them and of course<br/>
they tell me how they feel about it.<br/>
