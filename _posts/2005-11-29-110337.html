i have a daughter who is 17 months old.<br/>
she has a fantastic kid size rocking chair that she<br/>
loves and lately she has been climbing up and standing<br/>
on it.<br/>
the natural consequence of that could be that she<br/>
falls. i guess that another natural consequence is<br/>
that her balancing skills get really really good, but<br/>
i seem to focus more on the *falling* chance. <br/>
i don&#39;t want to tell her to *stop*. i *do* not want<br/>
her to get hurt and i feel like i&#39;d be mean if i just<br/>
let her figure it out herself. ????<br/>
what i do tis tell her that she has more of a chance<br/>
of falling if she stands on the rocker than if she<br/>
sits and i move closer to her if i was further away. <br/>
i&#39;m really not sure what to do.<br/>
i think about when she learned to crawl and sit up and<br/>
walk and how i never stepped in or directed her, but<br/>
would just *be* close by for support-physical or words<br/>
wise, if she needed it. <br/>
i feel like what i&#39;m doing in regards to the rocker is<br/>
still along those same lines but i&#39;m doubting myself.<br/>

thank you guys so much for all of your responses.<br/>
i really appreciate them, they&#39;ve been really helpful<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can you maybe toss a cushion on the floor in front of and behind the <br/>
rocker? I know the feelings you speak of - I&#39;ve got a DS who is <br/>
quite a climber (climbing furniture at 6 months! and we&#39;re talking <br/>
climbed onto the couch, over the arm onto a straightback chair and <br/>
was trying to get onto a 6 ft tall bookcase!) I&#39;ve learned two <br/>
things over time: 1 - he has a way better sense of balance and <br/>
position than I do (his body-sense I guess you might call it - he <br/>
*knows* where he is, what he wants to do, and whether he can and how <br/>
to do it) 2 - injuries happen sometimes from the most innocuous <br/>
things. DS has had two broken bones and he&#39;s 7 1/2. The first was <br/>
running indoors - indoor/outdoor carpeting over concrete slab. <br/>
Landed oddly when he tripped (he was 18 months old at the time) and <br/>
made a nice clean break in his right radius near the wrist. Who&#39;d&#39;a <br/>
thunk it? - he&#39;d done the same thing a gazillion times during his <br/>
toddlerhood. Then, right at about 4 yrs old, he and some other kids <br/>
were playing in and around a big box (the big old Gateway computer <br/>
boxes). They were climbing in and out for quite a while. DS had gone <br/>
in and out several times already. Then one time the box took a tip <br/>
and dumped DS out and he broke his left humerus just above the <br/>
elbow. He had been in and out bunches of times and even taken <br/>
spills. Just that one time the landing was a bit off. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of thoughts - practice falls. Roll off the couch and stuff <br/>
and make it play to fall safely. Also, maybe look for a balance <br/>
board type thing, kid size - something that she can use to develop <br/>
balance (which she seems to be enjoying) that is designed for the <br/>
process rather than her rocker (after all, it is that gift-giving <br/>
time of the year).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly it - provide a level of calm support so that both you <br/>
and the child feel relatively secure. At first it may be you stand <br/>
in close or even hold a hand (depending on the situation) then you <br/>
can gradually, as confidence grows, step back or step away entirely <br/>
and toss in a cushion on the off chance...<br/>
<br/>
*soapbox time*<br/>
I also am a firm believer that every parent should learn basic first <br/>
aid and CPR and have an up to date first aid kit on hand, easily <br/>
accessible. It&#39;s a great way to beat the &#39;what if...?&quot; worries <br/>
without making everyone nutso by hovering. As with anything, <br/>
information and practice lead to a level of confidence that results <br/>
in a measure of calm even in crisis.<br/>
*end of soapbox*<br/>
(FWIW we have 4 first aid kits - one in each glovebox, one small one <br/>
in my purse, and one in the bathroom that really needs a new case <br/>
since stuff falls all over the place too easily - and we&#39;ll probably <br/>
sub divide it into two, one for upstairs and one for downstairs, <br/>
when we do that)<br/>

<br/>
Kind of related, many years ago something that started my shift to<br/>
unschooling was a realization I had regarding treating my kids the same way<br/>
I would treat my spouse, a friend, or even myself. The parenting methodology<br/>
we had read would say things like if your child forget something as you were<br/>
leaving, not to turn around and go back so they could get it so they will<br/>
remember next time. Or, if they left laundry in the washer, bag it up so<br/>
they won&#39;t do it again. A &quot;natural consequence&quot;.  I just couldn&#39;t do it,<br/>
because when I forgot something, I was willing to turn around and go get<br/>
whatever it was (and my memory what it is, it happens a lot!) and I don&#39;t<br/>
always get to my laundry and I love it when someone switches a load into the<br/>
dryer for me. I just couldn&#39;t justify treating my children in a way that<br/>
seemed so disrespectful and was such a double standard from the way I wanted<br/>
to be treated.  What has happened is my children and more than happy to<br/>
accommodate me forgetting things and they will gladly switch whoever&#39;s<br/>
laundry needs to be switched.  Instead of creating dependent, irresponsible<br/>
children that the books warned would happen, I have children that are<br/>
thoughtful, considerate and understanding. And oddly enough, they forget<br/>
things a lot less than I do.  Anyway, the above comment just reminded me of<br/>
this, because I had more than one person tell me I was doing my kids a<br/>
disservice. Humph. Shows what they know. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, right.<br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;principle&quot; behind that, I guess, is that &quot;kids need to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And kids DO learn, but too many poor kids are learning that their parents are <br/>
mean and coldhearted and are willing to ruin clothes and risk illlness and <br/>
ensure unhappiness to &quot;make them learn.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
If the parents go by the principles that taking care of clothes is good, then <br/>
the only thing they could do would be to put those clothes in the dryer.   <br/>
And if they live by the principle that generosity breeds generosity, they could <br/>
put someone else&#39;s clothes in the dryer with a happy heart.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Amen.<br/>
<br/>
Holly made me a Boca burger earlier because I was craving a burger and we <br/>
weren&#39;t able to go out.    It was her idea, and even asked me if I wanted cheese, <br/>
and came back later to ask if I had liked it.   (I&#39;ve never had one <br/>
before--only she and Keith have eaten them.)   I did like it, but I liked her <br/>
generosity and thoughtfulness even more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I had more than one person tell me I was doing my kids a<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could tell them next time that you&#39;re being supremely selfish, <br/>
because you want to have kids who will love you for life and do things for your <br/>
grandchildren and be generous with you and others, rather than kids who learn to <br/>
leave home at 18 and hardly look back.   (It would just go over them like <br/>
water over a rock, though.)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; likely to fall. But I do get up from what I&#39;m doing and move closer  <br/>
&gt; to him whenever he&#39;s doing something that looks extra-risky or that  <br/>
&gt; he hasn&#39;t done before, and I do manage to keep him from tumbling--or <br/>
<br/>
&gt; at least break a fall--once in awhile. I say, &quot;That looks like fun.  <br/>
&gt; Let me spot you!&quot; My older son, 4, will ask me to spot him if he  <br/>
&gt; wants to try something he&#39;s not sure about, and it helps him try  <br/>
&gt; things that would be scary otherwise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this might not look too different from hovering in an anxious <br/>
<br/>
&gt; manner (smile) but I try to communicate a calm if-needed presence,  <br/>
&gt; not &quot;oh my god you&#39;ll crack your noggin if you don&#39;t get down right  <br/>
&gt; now!&quot; And I back off after the baby has tried something a few times  <br/>
&gt; with good results.<br/>

&gt;&gt;i have a daughter who is 17 months old.<br/>
&gt;&gt;she has a fantastic kid size rocking chair that she<br/>
&gt;&gt;loves and lately she has been climbing up and standing<br/>
&gt;&gt;on it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;the natural consequence of that could be that she<br/>
&gt;&gt;falls. i guess that another natural consequence is<br/>
&gt;&gt;that her balancing skills get really really good, but<br/>
&gt;&gt;i seem to focus more on the *falling* chance.<br/>
&gt;&gt;i don&#39;t want to tell her to *stop*. i *do* not want<br/>
&gt;&gt;her to get hurt and i feel like i&#39;d be mean if i just<br/>
&gt;&gt;let her figure it out herself. ????<br/>
&gt;&gt;what i do tis tell her that she has more of a chance<br/>
&gt;&gt;of falling if she stands on the rocker than if she<br/>
&gt;&gt;sits and i move closer to her if i was further away.<br/>
&gt;&gt;i&#39;m really not sure what to do.<br/>
&gt;&gt;i think about when she learned<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-563940070">hiya all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t come out of lurker status often but this touched history for <br/>
us.<br/>
 <br/>
When David was 1 year old he was standing on a rocking chair at his <br/>
preschool. It was on either hardwood or tile floors. Not being <br/>
watched too closely he began rocking it. It fell back and severed the <br/>
tip of his middle finger. They were not able to reattach it. It is <br/>
the same height as the ring finger.<br/>
<br/>
He is 11 now, that nail grows wierd. And that is just one of the many <br/>
tales he loves to hear from his picninny mom. About how I rushed out <br/>
of school, ran to the hospital, almost fainted dead away at my baby <br/>
crying so badly- and- so - did not want to see that stub they could <br/>
not attach. Looking back at it now- almost wish he&#39;d been older so we <br/>
could have had a funeral for it. &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
<br/>
That and the neon green poop are his favorites......<br/>
<br/>
Be Well,<br/>
Rach & David</div>
