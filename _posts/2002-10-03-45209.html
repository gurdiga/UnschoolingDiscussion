<div id="ygrps-yiv-381361341">Good morning, I just wanted to say thank you to everybody for their <br/>
words of wisdom. I&#39;m hoping that we may be on our past this hurdle in <br/>
our family. Yesterday Jason(dh)was able to come home early and he <br/>
took Avery out so that I could spend some time with Jaiden. I asked <br/>
him to come sit with me on the couch and started talking to him about <br/>
when he was a baby and telling him all about the years before Avery <br/>
came then I started making up a story about what it would be like now <br/>
if we didn&#39;t have Avery. He stoped me and told me that I forgot about <br/>
Avery and I asked him if he wanted me to include Avery and he said <br/>
yes, because Avery is his favorite brother and he loves him soooooo <br/>
much and he would be sad if we didn&#39;t have Avery anymore. Then I <br/>
asked him why he likes to hurt Avery so much and he said that he <br/>
dosen&#39;t like to hurt him he&#39;s just mad at him, because now that we <br/>
have Avery he has to wait for everything, he never gets to be first <br/>
anymore and that makes him mad and sad nad he just ends up hurting <br/>
Avery because he&#39;s there. So we talked about the things that he <br/>
misses by not being the only one.  We also talked about him letting <br/>
me sleep in the mornings, and he told me that the reason he wakes me <br/>
up is because he&#39;s hungry, thirsty, and he isn&#39;t allowed to use the <br/>
vcr by himself. (we don&#39;t have cable and we can&#39;t get reception so <br/>
it&#39;s movies only at our house). And I remembered that before Avery, <br/>
Jason and I used to set up some snacks, a juice box, a bed on the <br/>
floor, and a movie so that he could come out and turn the tv on and <br/>
press play and he had everything that he needed. We stoped after we <br/>
had Avery, got lazy I guess. So I promised jaiden that I would set <br/>
him up in the morning again like I used to if he would try to let us <br/>
sleep a liitl longer in the morning. Jason and I also spent some time <br/>
talking last night about how we have been neglecting some of Jaidens <br/>
needs because with Avery requiring so much from us, and Jaiden being <br/>
so self suficiant(sp?) we forget that he&#39;s 4 (just turned) and he&#39;s <br/>
not grown up and that it&#39;s not fair of us to expect him to behave as <br/>
one. We both agreed that we have to make sure that he gets more one <br/>
on one with both of us. And that he needs to see us putting him first <br/>
sometimes.  So this morning I had his bed made up, his snack waiting, <br/>
and a movie all ready to go and I got to sleep until Avery woke up <br/>
@1.5 hours later :-)<br/>

P.S. I wanted to put my $0.02 in about spanking. My parents spanked <br/>
me and my brother, more than that my uncle made them a paddle that <br/>
had my name carved into one side and my brother&#39;s name carved into <br/>
the other. One side for my spankings, one side for my brothers. They <br/>
used to say that if we got hit with the wrong side it was because we <br/>
had made them so mad that they couldn&#39;t read and so we deserved <br/>
another swat with the right side.  So, I have some major problems <br/>
with spanking</div>

<br/>
That&#39;s really sweet!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad he was able to open up and talk and that you came to some good <br/>
conclusions!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he IS old enough to use the VCR by himself.  If you let him change <br/>
tapes while you&#39;re sitting there, you might be more confident about his <br/>
changing his own tapes while you&#39;re asleep.<br/>
