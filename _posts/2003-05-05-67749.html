<div id="ygrps-yiv-286754972">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking around her all week and didn&#39;t realise that most people introduce themselves before they start jumping. Sorry if you were wondering where on earth I came from<br/>
<br/>
I live in Australia and unschool my three sons - aged 11, 8 and 6.  I logged in to search for some on-line support.  I find the amount of e-mails a bit daunting though and seem to be jumping on the computer all the time just to check the mailbox. I will probably subscribe as the need arises and unsubscribe as the mail gets overwhelming. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211042814">Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I just read the messages at the site without receiving the email.  <br/>
IMO, that would be daunting!  Just an idea for you.<br/>
