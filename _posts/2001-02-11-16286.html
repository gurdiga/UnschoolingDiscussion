<div id="ygrps-yiv-269893983">Our library has all of the Harry Potter books on tape.  My 8dd listened<br/>
to the tape and read along in the book.  Her idea!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, they are not my favorite books.  I think that Harry would be<br/>
a mental wreck if he really had been raised in a closet and so<br/>
abused/neglected.  I don&#39;t like the way that Hermione is put down for<br/>
studying so hard.  I think it&#39;s phony that witches and wizards don&#39;t get<br/>
to do magic until after they go to Hogwarts.  And why would a magic<br/>
family like the Weasleys be so poor?  Why couldn&#39;t you just magic your<br/>
kids new school clothes, etc.  But HEY, it is FICTION!<br/>
