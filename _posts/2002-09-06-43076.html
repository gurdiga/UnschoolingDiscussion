My 5 and 9 y.o. seem to be at odds the most, it must be the age.<br/>

When they start squabbling a lot, that is usually a signal that I need to get <br/>
involved in their world more. Either by running distraction for the little <br/>
ones, or by getting us all involved in something fun or out to a new place <br/>
that gets us all distracted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708552519">I agree with Ren,  I have 9ys, 7yd and 5yd(I don&#39;t know all of your guys&#39; abbreviations yet).   And if I&#39;m there to run interference we have a great time, but they are all so much the same age that they don&#39;t understand the maturity levels.  My 9 y, is great with my 5y, but then my daughter in between gets her feelings hurt.  She thinks her brother likes his little sister better because she sees him so gentle with her.  He isn&#39;t quite as understanding when it comes to her.  I&#39;m sure because they are only 19 months apart.   Although now they have been on the new playstation for 3 hours and I havn&#39;t had to interfere at all!  So, so far so good!<br/>
Kelli, feeling almost euphoric to be home with the kids! <br/>

&lt;&lt; . No one person is at full fault for a squabble - &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Never? Never ever? Around here there are obvious things that could be avoided <br/>
the next time. Sometimes there is no fault, but a lack of understanding.<br/>
When Trevor is not understanding his sisters five year old mental <br/>
capabilities and expects her to think like a 12 y.o. I can easily point out <br/>
her developmental differences (without her present) and ask him to not expect <br/>
certain things of her.<br/>
When Jared is hanging in Trevors room Waaaay past the welcome point, or <br/>
antagonizing him, he needs skills for dealing with his desire for a big <br/>
brother/friend at that moment.<br/>
Helping them learn another persons cues, understanding differences and how to <br/>
cope with different situations means pointing out how it could be done <br/>
different the next time.<br/>
Usually squabbles start for a reason.<br/>
No one is advocating blame. But there is always a reason for the squabble and <br/>
if you help them figure it out, they will gain skills to handle it better in <br/>
the future.<br/>
Blame isn&#39;t the point. But getting to the bottom of it is important sometimes.<br/>
It takes patience, it takes listening skills and understanding.<br/>
But being the advocate is important sometimes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204041388">I&#39;m so glad this is being discussed since I was meaning to bring it up.<br/>
<br/>
What seems at root of much of the unhappiness and fighting at our house is <br/>
competition for me and my time.  They both have been getting really mad and <br/>
resentful when they both want something from me at the same time.  (And daddy <br/>
usually won&#39;t do, they say.)  Right now their interests don&#39;t overlap much - <br/>
they are 3 and 8 - and they both often want me to do something with them at <br/>
the same time. (The one thing they&#39;ve been doing together is watching videos <br/>
and they always want to do it together, so that doesn&#39;t give me videos as a <br/>
way to have one on one time with the one not watching.) The three year old <br/>
really really has a hard time waiting and I&#39;m always thinking, &quot;gee, Sam <br/>
didn&#39;t have to wait when he was three, why should Nicky?&quot;  But that really <br/>
doesn&#39;t go over well with Sam.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just not feeling like I have enough loving attention to go around.  And I <br/>
only have two kids!   I really feel like I haven&#39;t figured out how to <br/>
unschool  (parent?) with two kids.  Most of the homeschoolers around here <br/>
deal with this by putting the youngest in preschool.  But I don&#39;t want to do <br/>
that!  Anyone else deal with this and how?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Kirby&#39;s worst time was when he was 12, and we all would shake our heads <br/>
 and take deep breaths and just hope he would grow out of it, which he did, <br/>
 beautifully. &gt;&gt;<br/>
    <br/>
You don&#39;t know how good that is to hear. I am so frustrated some days at <br/>
Trevor&#39;s lack of patience or sympathy to his younger sibs. He can be so <br/>
wonderful and nice, but if they annoy him watch out! Name calling and barking <br/>
at them to stay away are almost every day fare.<br/>
He&#39;s also been very angry towards me over seemingly trivial stuff lately.<br/>
I think we&#39;re going headlong into puberty here. Hope it&#39;s just the 12 <br/>
transition....<br/>

&lt;&lt; !  My kids are 5 and 8 for God&#39;s sake!  We&#39;re not <br/>

<br/>
Really? So just because the law doesn&#39;t call it domestic violence because <br/>
there is no respect for kids in our society, that makes it ok?<br/>
If your children were doing the same thing at 20, it would be considered <br/>
domestic violence and it would not be acceptable.<br/>
For some reason, our sick society accepts children being hit, shamed and <br/>
otherwise abused in the name of &quot;discipline&quot;. <br/>
If the same acts are commited by any adult, it&#39;s illegal.<br/>
If your children are hurting each other, it&#39;s only ok because they&#39;re <br/>
children. Can you see  the wrongness in that?<br/>

 No Sandra, you&#39;re lost again. I wasn&#39;t the one that used the word squabbles <br/>
 and I posted this after the whole squabble postings and after all the <br/>
 &quot;saying NO posts&quot; got heated. I sincerely wanted an answer and also thought <br/>
 a change of thought would help. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember your original post Mary.<br/>
I also remember extensive answers to it.<br/>
Like the idea of telling a child to first use words, secondly get help from a <br/>
parent and resorting to hitting last.<br/>
That was Sandra&#39;s example, I read about real life stories from her where this <br/>
helped her children not learn to hit.<br/>
I read so many posts about this.<br/>
I guess the answers weren&#39;t what you wanted.<br/>

am sorry, but you can&#39;t have it both ways. If we genuinely try to answer a <br/>
posted question, then you can take it or leave it. But the question has to be <br/>
genuine as well.  And we sometimes reply to a question with a hypothetical <br/>
answer, but you can&#39;t post a hypothetical question and get upset that the <br/>
*real* question wasn&#39;t answered. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. <br/>

both get replied too then should I get upset?<br/>

I get totally grossed out to the max from people eating boogers and tend to<br/>
make serious gagging and retching sounds. Not laughingly but really gagging<br/>
and retching. I also say that I don&#39;t want to see that because it makes me<br/>
physically ill. The first time my now 14 yo (who only surfed for porn one<br/>
time by googling &lt;Britney Spears boobs&gt;) must have been pretty affected by<br/>
my seriously ill response and hasn&#39;t done it in front of me again. According<br/>
to one of my &quot;monitoring&quot; sources (Emily) he still eats them just not in<br/>
front of me!<br/>
I have also talked about getting ill and different germs and their<br/>
environments and why they belong in their particular place (booger germs<br/>
don&#39;t belong in your intestinal tract)<br/>

&gt;How are we supposed to know which question you ask is real or hypothetical? <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;am sorry, but you can&#39;t have it both ways. If we genuinely try to answer a<br/>
&gt;posted question, then you can take it or leave it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh for God&#39;s sake because when Sandra and I were talking about something I <br/>
said, and she was telling a story I simply asked her by name, &quot;well what if <br/>
such and such happened?&quot; She answered.<br/>
<br/>
Then later on I posted a question concerning a problem I&#39;m having. If I ask <br/>
someone what they would do in a certain situation does that mean I can&#39;t ask <br/>
another question for my own concerns???<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like I came up with something out of the blue that no one was <br/>
already talking about just to get a conversation going.<br/>

*know* all the time what someone posted three days ago, and if you post one <br/>
question, you can&#39;t get all huffy when it gets mixed in with four others. <br/>

three up, or any other human failure that might happen. We make mistakes. We <br/>
don&#39;t get all questions answered, we don&#39;t know if all questions are serious <br/>
and so we take them all seriously, or as best we can.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one said you did. And even if you did, that would be great too! This is <br/>
just MHO but I think you should take a few deep breaths. We go through this <br/>
all the time, someone doesn&#39;t understand what someone else has written, or <br/>
they *read* more into a post than is there. No biggie, we all do it, just try <br/>
to read with the idea that everyone here is offering advice based on their <br/>
own personal experiences. No one is judging, or calling anyone else a crappy <br/>
parent. Its hard, I know especially for those of us (not saying this applies <br/>
to you, this is a general you) who don&#39;t have the support group, or a <br/>
supportive family. But we can&#39;t run around clarifying every statement. Or <br/>
making sure the person a post is intended for understands it is for them. The <br/>
posts are for all of us, not just one of us. Just breathe, relax, we are all <br/>
walking the same path, there are no nasty MIL&#39;s or nosy neighbors here. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741289641">If it&#39;s an on-going problem, you could consider the possibility of <br/>
buying another computer.  Especially for very little kids who don&#39;t <br/>
use the internet and only want a computer for computer games <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962623863">Use a kitchen timer. When the alarm sounds off, it&#39;s time to give it <br/>
up to the next person. I have a 5 year old and a 2.5 year old and two <br/>
computers and we still have to do this! Also, there is not <br/>
negotiating when mommy and daddy have to work. When it is work, it is <br/>
work and they gotta wait until we are done. No exceptions --we do <br/>
most of out work  from home, so they know when we mean business.<br/>

several years.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a funny story. I have always believed in using the correct words <br/>
for body parts. When my son was little he asked me what the stuff in his nose <br/>
was called. For the life of me I couldn&#39;t think of what it was called and <br/>
what came out of my mouth was &quot;Gookies&quot; (pronounced like cookies). That stuck <br/>
for a long time. So, when my daughter started picking her nose, she&#39;d pick <br/>
it, eat it and say, &quot;Mmmmm, gookies&quot;. Anyone who overheard her thought she <br/>
was saying &quot;cookies&quot;.<br/>
