on Wellbutrin. The first two were hellacious; apparently my serotonin levels<br/>

I&#39;d like. The Wellbutrin has been a godsend and I hope to get off it soon. I<br/>
don&#39;t feel &quot;happy&quot; with it; I just feel like myself. And FWIW, I loathe<br/>
medication. I won&#39;t take aspirin till day 2 of a headache. I can count the<br/>
times I&#39;ve been on antibiotics on one hand. It took years before I broke<br/>
down and agreed to antidepressants and I wish it had been sooner.<br/>

They don&#39;t know how it acts. It&#39;s in the aminoketone class and unrelated to<br/>
other antidepressants. I had every side effect known, plus a few they<br/>
didn&#39;t, on SSRI&#39;s (Prozac and that crowd). It pissed me off (now *there&#39;s* a<br/>
cure for depression!) that the original studies downplayed the side effects<br/>
so much. With Wellbutrin, there were no side effects, unless you count the<br/>
weight loss, which was a great one. And that may have only been because I<br/>
felt good and exercised and quit self-medicating with junk food. (Although I<br/>
still say there ain&#39;t nothing that won&#39;t be better with a Ding Dong and a<br/>
Diet Pepsi on board.)<br/>
