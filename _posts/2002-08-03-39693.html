Strong beliefs and the desire to make unschooling easier for people coming to <br/>
it now than it was for people who started ten years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Those who can come online and ask a question and get conflicting answers <br/>
within a day or an hour will never need to know what it was like to wait two <br/>
months for another issue of Growing Without Schooling because you&#39;d already <br/>
read the John Holt books twice.<br/>
