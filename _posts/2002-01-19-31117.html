+ I think I just wanted to understand more about what the<br/>
+ average unschooler believes about &quot;pushing&quot;.  Reading the old<br/>
+ email, you mentioned that your children didn&#39;t learn multiplication<br/>
+ tables until they saw they needed them.  Once they started<br/>
+ learning them, did you make them stick to some sort of program<br/>
+ or schedule until they had them memorized?<br/>
+<br/>
+ When do you &quot;make&quot; them complete something, or do a job,<br/>
+ or whatever - if at all?  Do they have to &quot;finish what they start&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok.....I wish I could read what I wrote last time so I&#39;d remember where I<br/>
stopped or what I could explain better now, but I&#39;ll just give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t been to the unschooling.com website, you might enjoy reading<br/>
it.  If you ask these kinds of questions there, I think you&#39;ll get some<br/>
pretty stark responses, but I&#39;m sure they would contribute to your<br/>
understanding of unschooling.  Remember that, like most philosophies,<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; is a place on a continuum--not a specific set of absolutes.<br/>
So what you hear from one unschooler will be different from what you hear<br/>
from another.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, to pick up at multiplication tables....my (older 2) children still don&#39;t<br/>
really KNOW their multiplication tables.  They know HOW to multiply and they<br/>
know enough of them to figure out most problems in a relatively short amount<br/>
of time, but they still don&#39;t have them all memorized.<br/>
<br/>
I think when the last time we wrote, I had encouraged them to learn them and<br/>
they more or less agreed with me and were working on it.  However, to answer<br/>
your question about &quot;sticking to it&quot;, the answer is &quot;no&quot;--at least this<br/>
particular time.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime I come up against a preconceived notion of &quot;what they should learn&quot;,<br/>
I step back and reconsider it.  If my children don&#39;t balk at it, I don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily have a reason to reconsider it, but if they do then I try to<br/>
look at it through their untarnished eyes.  (Their untarnished eyes are my<br/>
greatest tool in this unschooling journey!  They haven&#39;t been brainwashed by<br/>
the institutional school system as I was.)  What is the point of memorizing<br/>
multiplication tables?  If my kids know how to figure out the answers to<br/>
multiplication problems, does it matter how fast they do them?  Under what<br/>
circumstances would they NEED to do multiplication quickly?  How quickly?<br/>
When do I use multiplication in my daily life and what are the consequences<br/>
of doing it more slowly?  What are the consequences of doing it wrong?  What<br/>
motivates me to do it correctly and/or quickly?  What tools do I<br/>
always/sometimes/never have at my disposal when I&#39;m doing multiplication?<br/>
At what age will my children need to have multiplication tables memorized?<br/>
Is it different if they&#39;re an artist or a businessman or an astronaut or a<br/>
lawyer or a sales clerk or a homemaker or a chef or a ballerina?  How long<br/>
would it take an adult to memorize them if they chose to?  How many adults<br/>
have them fully memorized?  (It still takes me longer to remember the upper<br/>
7s, 8s and 9s myself.)  What is the practical definition of &quot;memorized&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;d still prefer that they memorized their multiplication tables and I<br/>
won&#39;t stop encouraging this from time to time, I don&#39;t really think it is<br/>
urgent for them to memorize them....nor is it necessarily important for them<br/>
to memorize them at all.  I think I probably discussed with you the<br/>
differences between &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  (Teaching is only very<br/>
distantly related to learning--and only if the &quot;student&quot; is motivated to<br/>
learn.)  The differences even apply to &quot;encouraging&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  Only<br/>
THEY can &quot;learn&quot;.  It is an internal process over which I have no control.<br/>
If you disagree with this, imagine a scenario where it could be true<br/>
(teacher and uninterested student) and I think you can agree.  It (relative<br/>
futility of teaching) doesn&#39;t stop being true just because it is an<br/>
&quot;important&quot; thing to know.  Part of unschooling is giving up that which you<br/>
have no control over anyway.  There are ways to manipulate control, but<br/>
they&#39;re usually not good for the HUMAN BEING over which control is being<br/>
asserted.  And this whole issue of &quot;control&quot; is what I see as the primary<br/>
harm inflicted by institutional schools (and, in turn, what makes<br/>
Libertarian politics so hard for some people to grasp).<br/>
<br/>
For me, the &quot;balancing act&quot; of unschooling is weighing what I think is<br/>
important to know in life with who I hope my children will be as human<br/>
beings.  (&quot;Weighing&quot; it means the two things are sometimes equal; sometimes<br/>
one side or the other is more important; sometimes they&#39;re both on the same<br/>
side of the scale.)  It&#39;s also always interesting to talk with other<br/>
homeschooling parents to see the differences in what THEY think is important<br/>
to know.  Or, for that matter, to look at various states&#39; mandatory<br/>
curriculums.<br/>
<br/>
My son enrolled in a correspondence school last January.  He will be<br/>
skipping basic math in order to take Algebra I, II and Geometry (for the<br/>
benefit of college admissions).  In order to do Algebra, there are some<br/>
basic math concepts that he hasn&#39;t yet learned.  (Rules for multiplying,<br/>
dividing fractions, for example.)  So, I found a &quot;review&quot; math book that has<br/>
all math concepts from K-8th grade.  He&#39;s used it some, but not much since<br/>
he hasn&#39;t started Algebra yet and doesn&#39;t really have much incentive yet.<br/>
However, for him, math is very logical and he can understand these concepts<br/>
in just seconds, where it took me years of elementary school review to &quot;get<br/>
it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This correspondence school (American School) was his idea (I have mixed<br/>
feelings about it), but we&#39;ve paid for it so I expect him to do what he said<br/>
he would do.  However.....just last night I went back to tell him goodnight<br/>
and he was reading (as always).  I had planned to talk with him about<br/>
picking up his American School texts again (following a vacation to<br/>
Germany).  But when I went back there, the book he was reading was a physics<br/>
book (The Handy Physics Answer Book) that wasn&#39;t part of his American School<br/>
work.  I just felt that I couldn&#39;t tell him to put down that valuable book<br/>
that he picked on his own in order to read a text book that was (at that<br/>
moment, at least) less interesting to him.  He&#39;s always been very interested<br/>
in physics, in fact, and reads a lot about physics, physics philosophy, and<br/>
physicists.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also been learning (teaching himself) how to play the guitar.  Even<br/>
that, I can rationalize, may be more important for HIS LIFE than memorizing<br/>
his multiplication tables or working in a Biology textbook.  Maybe his life<br/>
path will lead him to be the next James Taylor.  Would I rather he be an<br/>
accountant if it is his nature to be a musician?  Or maybe learning the<br/>
guitar will do nothing more than bring him personal pleasure in life.  Is<br/>
that to be discouraged over multiplication tables?  Unschooling allows<br/>
people to become who THEY choose to be...who they are TALENTED at being.<br/>
<br/>
I spend a lot of time explaining how unschooling works with my son--my<br/>
oldest.  That&#39;s because of several complex reasons.  First, he is the oldest<br/>
and I&#39;ve been &quot;figuring him out&quot; for the longest now.  Second, his<br/>
particular interests are &quot;conventional&quot; and numerous.  He&#39;s interested in<br/>
many scholarly things and I can visualize him as a successful (and happy)<br/>
adult in many different vocations.  Third, my second child is more difficult<br/>
to explain in terms that would help you understand unschooling.  She even<br/>
challenges MY ideas about unschooling on a daily basis!  I&#39;ve only recently<br/>
been able to see an adult life for her that makes sense to me and still<br/>
holds true to my unschooling beliefs.  My third child is more like my first,<br/>
though her interests are quite different from my oldest&#39;s.  (One important<br/>
thing they have in common is a passion for reading, which my second child<br/>
lacks.)  I&#39;ll have to explain more about that in another letter, though, if<br/>
you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
OK, the second part of your question had to do with &quot;finishing what they<br/>
start&quot;.  I touched on this with regard to Matthew&#39;s choice of American<br/>
School above.  We&#39;re paying about $1000 for it and I do expect him to finish<br/>
what he started--this commitment he chose to make.  However, on a day-to-day<br/>
basis, it&#39;s more complicated than that (as per the example I gave above).  I<br/>
want him to finish it, but I&#39;d rather he be true to himself.....if the two<br/>
things happen to be in conflict.  I hope they won&#39;t be, but if/when they<br/>
are, we&#39;ll take it one issue at a time.  Anyway, I&#39;ll try to explain<br/>
something with a more short-term example.....<br/>
<br/>
Again, I would have to start with asking myself, &quot;what are the consequences<br/>
of NOT finishing this particular thing?&quot;  In the long term, I believe that<br/>
it is a good character trait to finish what you started....usually.  I can<br/>
agree that in general terms, it is a good value to have.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>
able to stick with something, even if it is not too enjoyable, for a greater<br/>
reward.  (The key, often being &quot;reward&quot;--tangible or intangible.)  But in<br/>
reality, most of us start WAY more things than we finish.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve also done some reading that suggests that starting projects may be<br/>
as important, or more important, to a child (and perhaps to an adult) than<br/>
finishing them....that they are a necessary part of the process of learning.<br/>
I&#39;ll use art projects as an example.  When my children were about 4-6 years<br/>
old, they went through a process where they worked on an art project to the<br/>
point of destroying it.  They would add glue or paint or markers or glitter<br/>
to a project to the point of it disintegrating.  Often they would start a<br/>
project and lose interest in it before it was done...or more likely, it was<br/>
hard to determine what &quot;done&quot; was.  Art was just always a work in progress.<br/>
The ACT of creating WAS the purpose.<br/>
<br/>
While I think it&#39;s probably easier to see this with art than with other<br/>
&quot;subjects&quot;, I can see many parallels.  Institutional school has told us the<br/>
following lies:  1. Learning is accomplished when you have a<br/>
visible/complete/correct product.  2. Learning is linear and sequential.  3.<br/>
Learning is measurable.  4. Education means learning a specific set of<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I believe that learning is often invisible, always incomplete,<br/>
takes place with both correct and incorrect &quot;products&quot;, is almost never<br/>
linear nor sequential, is only vaguely measurable and does not include any<br/>
particular set of universal information.  So....if your question is &quot;should<br/>
I make them finish what they start&quot;? then I would say that learning is never<br/>
finished nor, in my house, is it often formally &quot;started&quot;.  It&#39;s just an<br/>
ongoing process.<br/>
<br/>
On a more concrete level (which is what I&#39;m sure you&#39;d rather I explain!),<br/>
there ARE projects that do have a beginning, middle, and end in our home.<br/>
Specific house-cleaning chores are one thing that comes to mind (but one of<br/>
the only things!).  In that case, I do ask that they be completed because<br/>
they affect other people.  At the moment, I can&#39;t think of other situations<br/>
where I insist on &quot;completion&quot;.  Matt&#39;s American School stuff is a<br/>
possibility....we do have money invested in this particular project....I<br/>
just don&#39;t think money is a sufficient enough reason to insist on<br/>
completion.<br/>
<br/>
Does that at all answer your question?<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, the bottom line is that IF a thing is important to know--in<br/>
REAL LIFE important and/or interesting for that INDIVIDUAL to know, they can<br/>
and will learn it.  If you can think of things you&#39;ve learned as an adult, I<br/>
think that will make sense to you.<br/>
<br/>
For me, a recent example is the learning that I&#39;ve done because of recent<br/>
world events.  I can&#39;t say that I necessarily enjoy learning about Islam and<br/>
Middle East history, but I am now motivated to learn such things as I feel<br/>
they may have an impact on my life and livelihood.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing....as a mother, I have those natural desires for my children<br/>
to be successful.  I want them to be free of financial worries and to be<br/>
able to spend time with their children and do enjoyable things with their<br/>
lives.  I have a (also natural, I think) fear that unschooling won&#39;t provide<br/>
these things.  But I try to balance that with the reality of what I *see* in<br/>
them and also, as I said, to acknowledge the lack of control I have over<br/>
these things.  Also, I really do feel that unschooling will allow them to<br/>
excel in the things that THEY are good at and enjoy.  Every person in<br/>
history who we know to be successful accomplished that in an area in which<br/>
they had a natural talent.  THAT is the natural order of things--not the way<br/>
the schools have manipulated education.<br/>
<br/>
In closing--here&#39;s a related, funny cartoon I read this morning.  (Can&#39;t<br/>
find the illustration online--it is from Dave Coverly at<br/>
www.speedbump.com --October 4 cartoon.)  One old woman to another as they<br/>
look at a man reading:  &quot;That&#39;s my boy, Mark...He&#39;s 39, but he&#39;s already<br/>
reading at a 42-year-old level...&quot;  Lower caption reads, &quot;Mrs. Randolf takes<br/>
mother&#39;s pride too far.&quot;<br/>

Have a nice Thanksgiving,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;+ I think I just wanted to understand more about what the<br/>
&gt;+ average unschooler believes about &quot;pushing&quot;.  Reading the old<br/>
&gt;+ email, you mentioned that your children didn&#39;t learn multiplication<br/>

&gt;+ When do you &quot;make&quot; them complete something, or do a job,<br/>
&gt;+ or whatever - if at all?  Do they have to &quot;finish what they start&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok.....I wish I could read what I wrote last time so I&#39;d remember where I<br/>
&gt;stopped or what I could explain better now, but I&#39;ll just give it a try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you haven&#39;t been to the unschooling.com website, you might enjoy reading<br/>
&gt;it.  If you ask these kinds of questions there, I think you&#39;ll get some<br/>
&gt;pretty stark responses, but I&#39;m sure they would contribute to your<br/>
&gt;understanding of unschooling.  Remember that, like most philosophies,<br/>
&gt;&quot;unschooling&quot; is a place on a continuum--not a specific set of absolutes.<br/>
&gt;So what you hear from one unschooler will be different from what you hear<br/>
&gt;from another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ok, to pick up at multiplication tables....my (older 2) children still don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;really KNOW their multiplication tables.  They know HOW to multiply and they<br/>
&gt;know enough of them to figure out most problems in a relatively short amount<br/>
&gt;of time, but they still don&#39;t have them all memorized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think when the last time we wrote, I had encouraged them to learn them and<br/>
&gt;they more or less agreed with me and were working on it.  However, to answer<br/>
&gt;your question about &quot;sticking to it&quot;, the answer is &quot;no&quot;--at least this<br/>
&gt;particular time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anytime I come up against a preconceived notion of &quot;what they should learn&quot;,<br/>
&gt;I step back and reconsider it.  If my children don&#39;t balk at it, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;necessarily have a reason to reconsider it, but if they do then I try to<br/>
&gt;look at it through their untarnished eyes.  (Their untarnished eyes are my<br/>
&gt;greatest tool in this unschooling journey!  They haven&#39;t been brainwashed by<br/>
&gt;the institutional school system as I was.)  What is the point of memorizing<br/>
&gt;multiplication tables?  If my kids know how to figure out the answers to<br/>
&gt;multiplication problems, does it matter how fast they do them?  Under what<br/>
&gt;circumstances would they NEED to do multiplication quickly?  How quickly?<br/>
&gt;When do I use multiplication in my daily life and what are the consequences<br/>
&gt;of doing it more slowly?  What are the consequences of doing it wrong?  What<br/>
&gt;motivates me to do it correctly and/or quickly?  What tools do I<br/>
&gt;always/sometimes/never have at my disposal when I&#39;m doing multiplication?<br/>
&gt;At what age will my children need to have multiplication tables memorized?<br/>
&gt;Is it different if they&#39;re an artist or a businessman or an astronaut or a<br/>
&gt;lawyer or a sales clerk or a homemaker or a chef or a ballerina?  How long<br/>
&gt;would it take an adult to memorize them if they chose to?  How many adults<br/>
&gt;have them fully memorized?  (It still takes me longer to remember the upper<br/>
&gt;7s, 8s and 9s myself.)  What is the practical definition of &quot;memorized&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While I&#39;d still prefer that they memorized their multiplication tables and I<br/>
&gt;won&#39;t stop encouraging this from time to time, I don&#39;t really think it is<br/>
&gt;urgent for them to memorize them....nor is it necessarily important for them<br/>
&gt;to memorize them at all.  I think I probably discussed with you the<br/>
&gt;differences between &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  (Teaching is only very<br/>
&gt;distantly related to learning--and only if the &quot;student&quot; is motivated to<br/>
&gt;learn.)  The differences even apply to &quot;encouraging&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.  Only<br/>
&gt;THEY can &quot;learn&quot;.  It is an internal process over which I have no control.<br/>
&gt;If you disagree with this, imagine a scenario where it could be true<br/>
&gt;(teacher and uninterested student) and I think you can agree.  It (relative<br/>
&gt;futility of teaching) doesn&#39;t stop being true just because it is an<br/>
&gt;&quot;important&quot; thing to know.  Part of unschooling is giving up that which you<br/>
&gt;have no control over anyway.  There are ways to manipulate control, but<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re usually not good for the HUMAN BEING over which control is being<br/>
&gt;asserted.  And this whole issue of &quot;control&quot; is what I see as the primary<br/>
&gt;harm inflicted by institutional schools (and, in turn, what makes<br/>
&gt;Libertarian politics so hard for some people to grasp).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For me, the &quot;balancing act&quot; of unschooling is weighing what I think is<br/>
&gt;important to know in life with who I hope my children will be as human<br/>
&gt;beings.  (&quot;Weighing&quot; it means the two things are sometimes equal; sometimes<br/>
&gt;one side or the other is more important; sometimes they&#39;re both on the same<br/>
&gt;side of the scale.)  It&#39;s also always interesting to talk with other<br/>
&gt;homeschooling parents to see the differences in what THEY think is important<br/>
&gt;to know.  Or, for that matter, to look at various states&#39; mandatory<br/>
&gt;curriculums.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My son enrolled in a correspondence school last January.  He will be<br/>
&gt;skipping basic math in order to take Algebra I, II and Geometry (for the<br/>
&gt;benefit of college admissions).  In order to do Algebra, there are some<br/>
&gt;basic math concepts that he hasn&#39;t yet learned.  (Rules for multiplying,<br/>
&gt;dividing fractions, for example.)  So, I found a &quot;review&quot; math book that has<br/>
&gt;all math concepts from K-8th grade.  He&#39;s used it some, but not much since<br/>
&gt;he hasn&#39;t started Algebra yet and doesn&#39;t really have much incentive yet.<br/>
&gt;However, for him, math is very logical and he can understand these concepts<br/>
&gt;in just seconds, where it took me years of elementary school review to &quot;get<br/>
&gt;it&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This correspondence school (American School) was his idea (I have mixed<br/>
&gt;feelings about it), but we&#39;ve paid for it so I expect him to do what he said<br/>
&gt;he would do.  However.....just last night I went back to tell him goodnight<br/>
&gt;and he was reading (as always).  I had planned to talk with him about<br/>
&gt;picking up his American School texts again (following a vacation to<br/>
&gt;Germany).  But when I went back there, the book he was reading was a physics<br/>
&gt;book (The Handy Physics Answer Book) that wasn&#39;t part of his American School<br/>
&gt;work.  I just felt that I couldn&#39;t tell him to put down that valuable book<br/>
&gt;that he picked on his own in order to read a text book that was (at that<br/>
&gt;moment, at least) less interesting to him.  He&#39;s always been very interested<br/>
&gt;in physics, in fact, and reads a lot about physics, physics philosophy, and<br/>
&gt;physicists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He&#39;s also been learning (teaching himself) how to play the guitar.  Even<br/>
&gt;that, I can rationalize, may be more important for HIS LIFE than memorizing<br/>
&gt;his multiplication tables or working in a Biology textbook.  Maybe his life<br/>
&gt;path will lead him to be the next James Taylor.  Would I rather he be an<br/>
&gt;accountant if it is his nature to be a musician?  Or maybe learning the<br/>
&gt;guitar will do nothing more than bring him personal pleasure in life.  Is<br/>
&gt;that to be discouraged over multiplication tables?  Unschooling allows<br/>
&gt;people to become who THEY choose to be...who they are TALENTED at being.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I spend a lot of time explaining how unschooling works with my son--my<br/>
&gt;oldest.  That&#39;s because of several complex reasons.  First, he is the oldest<br/>
&gt;and I&#39;ve been &quot;figuring him out&quot; for the longest now.  Second, his<br/>
&gt;particular interests are &quot;conventional&quot; and numerous.  He&#39;s interested in<br/>
&gt;many scholarly things and I can visualize him as a successful (and happy)<br/>
&gt;adult in many different vocations.  Third, my second child is more difficult<br/>
&gt;to explain in terms that would help you understand unschooling.  She even<br/>
&gt;challenges MY ideas about unschooling on a daily basis!  I&#39;ve only recently<br/>
&gt;been able to see an adult life for her that makes sense to me and still<br/>
&gt;holds true to my unschooling beliefs.  My third child is more like my first,<br/>
&gt;though her interests are quite different from my oldest&#39;s.  (One important<br/>
&gt;thing they have in common is a passion for reading, which my second child<br/>
&gt;lacks.)  I&#39;ll have to explain more about that in another letter, though, if<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re interested.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK, the second part of your question had to do with &quot;finishing what they<br/>
&gt;start&quot;.  I touched on this with regard to Matthew&#39;s choice of American<br/>
&gt;School above.  We&#39;re paying about $1000 for it and I do expect him to finish<br/>
&gt;what he started--this commitment he chose to make.  However, on a day-to-day<br/>
&gt;basis, it&#39;s more complicated than that (as per the example I gave above).  I<br/>
&gt;want him to finish it, but I&#39;d rather he be true to himself.....if the two<br/>
&gt;things happen to be in conflict.  I hope they won&#39;t be, but if/when they<br/>
&gt;are, we&#39;ll take it one issue at a time.  Anyway, I&#39;ll try to explain<br/>
&gt;something with a more short-term example.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, I would have to start with asking myself, &quot;what are the consequences<br/>
&gt;of NOT finishing this particular thing?&quot;  In the long term, I believe that<br/>
&gt;it is a good character trait to finish what you started....usually.  I can<br/>
&gt;agree that in general terms, it is a good value to have.  It&#39;s good to be<br/>
&gt;able to stick with something, even if it is not too enjoyable, for a greater<br/>
&gt;reward.  (The key, often being &quot;reward&quot;--tangible or intangible.)  But in<br/>
&gt;reality, most of us start WAY more things than we finish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And I&#39;ve also done some reading that suggests that starting projects may be<br/>
&gt;as important, or more important, to a child (and perhaps to an adult) than<br/>
&gt;finishing them....that they are a necessary part of the process of learning.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll use art projects as an example.  When my children were about 4-6 years<br/>
&gt;old, they went through a process where they worked on an art project to the<br/>
&gt;point of destroying it.  They would add glue or paint or markers or glitter<br/>
&gt;to a project to the point of it disintegrating.  Often they would start a<br/>
&gt;project and lose interest in it before it was done...or more likely, it was<br/>
&gt;hard to determine what &quot;done&quot; was.  Art was just always a work in progress.<br/>
&gt;The ACT of creating WAS the purpose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;While I think it&#39;s probably easier to see this with art than with other<br/>
&gt;&quot;subjects&quot;, I can see many parallels.  Institutional school has told us the<br/>
&gt;following lies:  1. Learning is accomplished when you have a<br/>
&gt;visible/complete/correct product.  2. Learning is linear and sequential.  3.<br/>
&gt;Learning is measurable.  4. Education means learning a specific set of<br/>
&gt;information.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Instead, I believe that learning is often invisible, always incomplete,<br/>
&gt;takes place with both correct and incorrect &quot;products&quot;, is almost never<br/>
&gt;linear nor sequential, is only vaguely measurable and does not include any<br/>
&gt;particular set of universal information.  So....if your question is &quot;should<br/>
&gt;I make them finish what they start&quot;? then I would say that learning is never<br/>
&gt;finished nor, in my house, is it often formally &quot;started&quot;.  It&#39;s just an<br/>
&gt;ongoing process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On a more concrete level (which is what I&#39;m sure you&#39;d rather I explain!),<br/>
&gt;there ARE projects that do have a beginning, middle, and end in our home.<br/>
&gt;Specific house-cleaning chores are one thing that comes to mind (but one of<br/>
&gt;the only things!).  In that case, I do ask that they be completed because<br/>
&gt;they affect other people.  At the moment, I can&#39;t think of other situations<br/>
&gt;where I insist on &quot;completion&quot;.  Matt&#39;s American School stuff is a<br/>
&gt;possibility....we do have money invested in this particular project....I<br/>
&gt;just don&#39;t think money is a sufficient enough reason to insist on<br/>
&gt;completion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does that at all answer your question?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For unschoolers, the bottom line is that IF a thing is important to know--in<br/>
&gt;REAL LIFE important and/or interesting for that INDIVIDUAL to know, they can<br/>
&gt;and will learn it.  If you can think of things you&#39;ve learned as an adult, I<br/>
&gt;think that will make sense to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For me, a recent example is the learning that I&#39;ve done because of recent<br/>
&gt;world events.  I can&#39;t say that I necessarily enjoy learning about Islam and<br/>
&gt;Middle East history, but I am now motivated to learn such things as I feel<br/>
&gt;they may have an impact on my life and livelihood.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One last thing....as a mother, I have those natural desires for my children<br/>
&gt;to be successful.  I want them to be free of financial worries and to be<br/>
&gt;able to spend time with their children and do enjoyable things with their<br/>
&gt;lives.  I have a (also natural, I think) fear that unschooling won&#39;t provide<br/>
&gt;these things.  But I try to balance that with the reality of what I *see* in<br/>
&gt;them and also, as I said, to acknowledge the lack of control I have over<br/>
&gt;these things.  Also, I really do feel that unschooling will allow them to<br/>
&gt;excel in the things that THEY are good at and enjoy.  Every person in<br/>
&gt;history who we know to be successful accomplished that in an area in which<br/>
&gt;they had a natural talent.  THAT is the natural order of things--not the way<br/>
&gt;the schools have manipulated education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In closing--here&#39;s a related, funny cartoon I read this morning.  (Can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;find the illustration online--it is from Dave Coverly at<br/>
&gt;www.speedbump.com --October 4 cartoon.)  One old woman to another as they<br/>
&gt;look at a man reading:  &quot;That&#39;s my boy, Mark...He&#39;s 39, but he&#39;s already<br/>
&gt;reading at a 42-year-old level...&quot;  Lower caption reads, &quot;Mrs. Randolf takes<br/>
&gt;mother&#39;s pride too far.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have a nice Thanksgiving,<br/>
