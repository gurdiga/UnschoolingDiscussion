watched Looking for Richard the other night. It undid a lot of the damage <br/>
that school had done to my interest in Shakespeare. Lars didn&#39;t watch it, <br/>
but he did comment that, &quot;Aren&#39;t there some other ones like that?&quot;  Are there?<br/>
There were two trailers on it, one for the diCapricio version of Romeo and <br/>
Juliet and one called Paradise Road, about a group of women who were <br/>
Japanese prisoners during WWII. I&#39;ve ordered both of them from the library, <br/>
so we&#39;ll see.<br/>

&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;<br/>
Review by John J. Puccio <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/StrictlyBallroom-1045568/">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/StrictlyBallroom-1045568/</a> <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Most audiences are probably more familiar with the name Baz Lurhmann <br/>
from his second and third films, &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; <br/>
than from his 1992 directorial debut, &quot;Strictly Ballroom.&quot; Yet when <br/>
one compares the three films, it is the first that takes the honors. <br/>
Still, you have to admire Lurhmann as a man who takes chances. <br/>
In &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; he updated Shakespeare&#39;s Verona to Southern <br/>
California and traded in the Bard&#39;s swords for automatic weapons. <br/>
In &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; he took a grand opera plot and turned it on its <br/>
head with modern pop tunes and outrageous costumes. They were daring <br/>
risks that paid off for some viewers and turned off others, like me.<br/>
<br/>
 But &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; shows all the signs of these films to come <br/>
without resort to the gimmickry of the later efforts. For <br/>
me, &quot;Ballroom&quot; remains Luhrmann&#39;s best all-around movie to date.<br/>
<br/>
The film is a romantic musical-comedy set in the milieu of Australian <br/>
ballroom dance competitions. At first it takes the mock-documentary <br/>
approach of a &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; &quot;Waiting for Guffman,&quot; or &quot;Best in Show&quot; <br/>
and goes for easy lampooning. Luhrmann, who cowrote the story and <br/>
screenplay, pokes fun at the over-serious self-importance of the <br/>
dance competitors, the nastiness and backbiting, the fierceness of <br/>
the competitions, and the irregularities of the judging. Elaborate <br/>
hairstyles and whimsical hairpieces get particularly cheeky, humorous <br/>
treatment. But as the story goes on, it loses track of this satiric <br/>
core and develops into a warmhearted, Cinderella-style romance, with <br/>
an ending that will leave you cheering. For once, I appreciated a <br/>
film&#39;s divergence from its initial focus.<br/>
<br/>
Paul Mercurio stars as a young dance competitor, Scott Hastings, a <br/>
fellow raised to be a champion. He and his parents, Doug and Shirley <br/>
(Barry Otto and Pat Thomson), former dance competitors themselves, <br/>
have high aspirations for Scott&#39;s winning the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix <br/>
Championships, apparently the World Series/Super Bowl of ballroom <br/>
dance contests. <br/>
<br/>
But Scott wants to be his own man, so to speak, and amplify his own <br/>
flashy dance steps, something his parents and the Australian Dance <br/>
Federation won&#39;t allow. In fact, Scott gets so fancy with his <br/>
improvisational moves that his partner leaves him in despair. What to <br/>
do? He reluctantly picks up a beginning dancer, Fran (Tara Morice), <br/>
who shows promise; but she&#39;s a plain-looking girl, downright <br/>
unattractive and clumsy by dancing-contest standards. Nevertheless, <br/>
Scott gives her a chance with him, they develop a Spanish dance <br/>
routine, and, of course, the unsightly bud eventually blossoms.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to see how &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; evolved from this film, <br/>
especially in the music, the glitz, the glamour, the romance, the off-<br/>
kilter humor, and the fanciful sets, even to a rooftop romp. <br/>
<br/>
Then, too, the complications are similar in nature. In &quot;Strictly <br/>
Ballroom&quot; the dance contests are built up as the biggest things since <br/>
the World Olympics, and politics dominate everything from the dance <br/>
steps to the participants&#39; choice of partners. The story&#39;s <br/>
antagonist, Barry Fife (Bill Hunter), is ceaselessly trying to <br/>
manipulate things, from the affairs of the Dance Federation to <br/>
everyone involved in it, a veritable Machiavelli of the mambo. Well, <br/>
the tango, actually, but mambo is more alliterative. And besides the <br/>
tango, there&#39;s the waltz and a bit of flamenco. There&#39;s music for <br/>
everyone. The plot is predictable, to be sure, but it&#39;s fun to follow <br/>
along, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 Mercurio and Morice are easygoing, likable young people, and <br/>
eventually everybody gets involved in the spirit of the dancing, even <br/>
Fran&#39;s parents.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

Hi Nancy - Is there anything in that movie that would upset a sensitive<br/>
viewer?   Rowan, who&#39;s six, gets very upset if a character goes through any<br/>
kind of emotional trauma, and I&#39;ve been trying to find someone who&#39;s seen it<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462186604">Sorry - I meant &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; -- here is Roger Ebert&#39;s review:<br/>
<br/>
STRICTLY BALLROOM<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ----------<br/>
<br/>
Date of publication: 02/26/1993<br/>
<br/>
By Roger Ebert<br/>
The plot of &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; is as old as the hills, but the  <br/>
characters in the movie seem to come from another planet. Surely nobody  <br/>
in Australia dresses like this, talks like this, takes ballroom dancing  <br/>
as seriously as this? They do? The true weirdness of the movie comes  <br/>
when we begin to realize the director didn&#39;t make everything up; only  <br/>
real life could possibly have inspired a world this bizarre.<br/>
<br/>
The movie, which crosses Astaire and Rodgers with Mickey and Judy and  <br/>
adds a dash of Spinal Tap, is a comedy posing as a docudrama about  <br/>
competitive ballroom dancing in Australia. Everyone in the movie takes  <br/>
the sport, or art, with deadly seriousness, and their world revolves  <br/>
around the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Championships (which, despite  <br/>
its grand name, seems to be a local event). Like synchronized swimming  <br/>
(the most hilarious event in Olympics history), competitive ballroom  <br/>
dancing is essentially lighthearted fun spoiled by lead-footed rules.<br/>
<br/>
The film&#39;s hero is Scott (Paul Mercurio), a pleasant young man with a  <br/>
mad light in his eyes, who, according to the pseudodocumentary that  <br/>
opens the film, was born to win the Pan-Pacific. But then he  <br/>
jeopardizes his chances by recklessly ignoring the rules, and forcing  <br/>
his partner to join him in a dance routine that was (gasp!) spontaneous  <br/>
and improvised.<br/>
<br/>
His partner is enraged, and leaves him. His mother, a former  <br/>
championship dancer, is beside herself. The estimable Barry Fife (Bill  <br/>
Hunter), the autocratic czar of ballroom contests, is deeply offended.  <br/>
Only the good-hearted Fran (Tara Morice) believes in him, and offers to  <br/>
become his partner. This is despite her lack of experience, her general  <br/>
ungainliness, and her homely appearance. Familiar with the great  <br/>
tradition of come-from-behind movies, however, we somehow suspect that  <br/>
if she ever takes off those glasses, and does something with her hair .  <br/>
. .<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was directed and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, who,  <br/>
according to the movie&#39;s press materials, has been fascinated with the  <br/>
insular world of Australian competitive ballroom dancing since he was a  <br/>
youth. The story, by Luhrmann and various collaborators, was first  <br/>
staged as an amateur production 10 years ago, and has been through many  <br/>
incarnations leading up to this film, which is so tightly packed with  <br/>
characters and situations that it seems, in its own way, as obsessed as  <br/>
the dancers themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Luhrmann, like many first-time directors, is intoxicated with the  <br/>
possibilities of the camera. He uses too many wide-angle shots, in  <br/>
which the characters look like blowfish mugging for the lens, and too  <br/>
many story lines, until we worry we may have lost track of something,  <br/>
but what works is an exuberance that cannot be faked. As Scott and Fran  <br/>
prepare for the Pan-Pacifics, as Barry Fife struggles to retain his  <br/>
stranglehold on competitive dancing, as Scott discovers that his meek  <br/>
and silent father was once a Pan-Pacific contender, the movie hurtles  <br/>
toward a conclusion sanctified by &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and so many  <br/>
other movies we could hold a trivia contest just by naming them.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s best about the movie is the sense of madness and mania running  <br/>
just beneath its surface. In one sense, the characters care about  <br/>
nothing but ballroom dancing. They eat, drink and sleep it, and talk of  <br/>
nothing else. Their costumes alone are a tip-off that they&#39;ve had no  <br/>
contact with the real world for years. Yet in another sense, ballroom  <br/>
dancing is simply the strategy they use to hold the world at bay. They  <br/>
are profoundly frightened of change, and have created an insular little  <br/>
world, with rigid rules and traditions; here they can be in control, as  <br/>
the larger world goes haywire. Scott&#39;s attempt to introduce anarchy -  <br/>
and new dance steps - into their tiny enclave is all the funnier  <br/>
because he, too, cares about nothing but dancing. He doesn&#39;t even want  <br/>
to be a rebel. But it&#39;s in his blood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-49966920">I&#39;m surprised that Ebert found the plot too complicated. Or that he<br/>
complained about stylized camera work that was so evidently deliberate<br/>
and planned. A tidbit about the film is that the actor portraying Fran&#39;s<br/>
father was the Spanish National flamenco champion or some similar title.<br/>
His dancing is cool. The film is full of some of the grand actors of<br/>
their generation in Australia. I once designed costumes for a play with<br/>
Pat Thomson. She was a wonderful raconteur and world traveler,<br/>
entertaining all of us during rehearsals, as well as really good in the<br/>
show. Paul Mercurio is the son of a well known (Australian) character<br/>
actor Gus Mercurio. When I was working wardrobe on &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;<br/>
in Sydney in the early eighties, it was rumored that Paul had been<br/>
slated to take over the part of the son (the &quot;juvenile&quot; as it is called<br/>
in musical theater), which was played by Gerry Sont (an old friend of<br/>
mine from high school, now a soap star in Australia). It didn&#39;t happen<br/>
at the time, although the dancing required for that particular character<br/>
was incidental, unlike the Cagelles, who had some pretty big and fancy<br/>
dancing. <br/>

It may.  I don&#39;t want to give it away, but it has the legend of the selkie in <br/>
it (Irish/Scottish story of woman/man who can turn from a seal into a human <br/>
and back again) so someone in the story has to deal with this happening.  Also, <br/>
there&#39;s a scene where a child is washed out to sea (it turns out good later <br/>
though) that is particularly sad/scary.  Maybe not the best for a sensitive <br/>
young one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700806776">I wonder how many subscribers to this list recently put that into <br/>
their netflix que.  Because I just did and was told there would be a <br/>
short wait(no big deal because it&#39;s 51 on my list! lol)  But I smiled <br/>
when I thought that, because it&#39;s such an old movie so there&#39;s a good <br/>
chance that they will be shipping out that movie from one unschooling <br/>
house to another for quite awhile. :)<br/>
