<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258675376">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I know this is personal, but I am hoping a bunch of<br/>
well self educated <br/>
folks like you might be able to help me research a<br/>
problem that I <br/>
discovered today. <br/>
<br/>
I had some abdominal pain for a few weeks, but it got<br/>
really worse the <br/>
last few days. I have been overweight my whole life,<br/>
and 100 lbs. over <br/>
for the last few years so I thought the pain was <br/>
all just all my fault for being so fat. It got so<br/>
strong, sharp, and <br/>
weird the past week so I made an appt with a gyn to<br/>
get checked out. <br/>
<br/>
I went to the gyn lady doc today (she is such a neat<br/>
person, very good <br/>
doc), and found through exam and ultrasound, a 16 mm<br/>
reason for my <br/>
pain. For those of us like me who have no idea <br/>
what 16 mm is, think about 6.3 inches, about the size<br/>
of a cantaloupe. <br/>
Ouch! She said it was an ovarian cyst and has to come<br/>
out. I do want it <br/>
out, it really hurts. I have surgery scheduled for <br/>
Wed. 5 Dec. I had a c-sction almost 7 years ago so I<br/>
have some idea <br/>
what recovery will be like. Not looking forward to the<br/>
hard part, but <br/>
really looking forward to feeling better when it&#39;s all<br/>
<br/>
done and healed. <br/>
<br/>
Any info or experience any of you might have on this<br/>
topic would be <br/>
really appreciated. I know it&#39;s not really the topic<br/>
of the list, so <br/>
you could send it to my email instead of the list if<br/>
that&#39;s <br/>
ok.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to search the net for info also. I&#39;ll be<br/>
online till dec 5th <br/>
surgery. I don&#39;t know after the 5th when I will be<br/>
back online but I&#39;ll <br/>
get back on when I can.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go back and try to get more sleep. <br/>
<br/>
May love guide and protect you<br/>
Makana&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Makana,<br/>
I don&#39;t have any advice or info to offer, but I just<br/>
want to express my sympathy and to wish you well. I&#39;ll<br/>
send some healing thoughts your way. <br/>
<br/>
Meghan :-)<br/>
