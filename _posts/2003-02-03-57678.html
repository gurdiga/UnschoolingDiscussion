<div id="ygrps-yiv-393579167">Dear people,<br/>
<br/>
I am Caroline and new on this list. I am a woman from Holland and <br/>
with my family, I am in the process of immigrating to Canada. We have <br/>
three children, age 2, 7 and 9. In Holland we are not allowed to <br/>
homeschool or unschool (can you believe that in a democratic, free <br/>
country...sigh...), to my big frustration! Of course my youngest one <br/>
is not going to school yet, but the other two are, and I find the <br/>
effects disastrous. My 7 year old son is very clever, he reads and <br/>
does things that are way above his level, but since he goes to school <br/>
he has lost most of his interest in learning - he hates it. He says <br/>
at school they have to do exercise after exercise of things he <br/>
already knows and it is BORING. Of course it is. He wants to know <br/>
about Robin Hood and learn how to do archery and that kind of stuff. <br/>
My hands itch to dive into it with him, but when he comes home from <br/>
school he is simply to tired to do anything but hang around. <br/>
My oldest daughter (9) is a very creative girl, very expressive, but <br/>
in school they pay attention almost only to the cognitive side of <br/>
things, which is not her strong side. What I see now, is that she is  <br/>
completely forgetting who she really is. Doesn&#39;t paint, draw, sing <br/>
anymore. IS very fake and tells me frankly she is not happy and <br/>
doesn&#39;t even know why.<br/>
So, you can guess, one of the first things I want to do when we are <br/>
in Canada is unschool my children. Now I have heard that the first <br/>
time of unschooling, after they have gone to school already, is very <br/>
tough, because they don&#39;t know how to inspire themselves anymore, and <br/>
they don&#39;t know what their interest really is. I am not looking <br/>
forward to that period, but I definitely will deal with it, because I <br/>
want the true spirit of my children back. Does any of you have any <br/>
experience with this?<br/>
I have another question as well. My oldest daughter is at this point <br/>
(as a reaction to her unhappiness in school I think) quite dominant <br/>
in her presence, she wants a lot of attention and talks alot, laughs <br/>
quite foolishly about everything, is angry and so on. My youngest <br/>
daughter of two of course copies everything, and also her behaviour. <br/>
When my oldest is in school she plays totally different, is singing <br/>
and in fantasygames - has a break, so to say, from her sister. One of <br/>
the things that i think will be difficult for me in homeschooling is <br/>
her continuous presence, and the young one copying everything, <br/>
including all the things that are fake and unreal. I understand that <br/>
it is very possible that my oldest&#39;s behaviour will change over time <br/>
when she is not going to school anymore, but before that she is <br/>
definitely having some negative effect on her brother and sister. Do <br/>
any of you recognize this and if yes, how do you deal with it?<br/>
I hope you can give me an answer on this, I&#39;d love to hear your <br/>
experience!<br/>
THank you very much,<br/>
kind regards,<br/>
Caroline van Daal</div>

Coincidentally, I just recently stumbled across another family who emigrated <br/>
from Holland for educational freedom (to the U.S.) You might find <br/>

Hey, I said that.  But I meant if you stay in your own HOUSE. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
It is easy to unschool in Nova Scotia. You submit a plan for the year in <br/>
September and a review for the year in June. Use some &quot;educationese&quot; and <br/>
the unschooling can sound very cirriculum-like.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few Dutch immigrants here, too, most of whom came over <br/>
shortly after WWII.  My sister is married to a Van de Reep whose family <br/>
came from Haarlem.<br/>

Oh he is so good with his coughing spells that Mr. Poe has and his general<br/>
deep and throaty voice.<br/>
Some are narrated by Lemony Snicket himself - also very good.<br/>
And just WHO is Beatrice, anyway? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t get into them, though, because of the dark and depressing<br/>
nature of the books.<br/>
But my boys and I enjoy them!<br/>
<br/>
I have heard rumors of a movie in the works for Series of Unfortunate Events<br/>
with Jim Carey as Count Olaf.<br/>
Now that would be good!<br/>

beginning of the books.<br/>
I have the first one right here. It says:<br/>
<br/>
To Beatrice -<br/>
darling, dearest, dead.<br/>
<br/>
He also mentions Beatrice from time to time in the books.<br/>
<br/>
I have a book called &quot;Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Biography&quot; which is<br/>
pretty funny.<br/>
You see, Lemony Snicket is a very secretive guy, and one will RARELY ever<br/>
get a glimpse of him.<br/>
In the whole book that I have, he is always turned away or somehow obscured<br/>
from the view of the camera.<br/>
I think I remember reading somewhere that Lemony Snicket is the pen name for<br/>
the guy who really writes the books.<br/>
Wait - I&#39;ll see if I can google it real quick.<br/>
Yeah - the authors real name is Daniel Handler.<br/>

I love the very different and dry sense of humor that comes through in all<br/>
the books.<br/>
It&#39;s very refreshing to read the way he writes those books - I think he&#39;s an<br/>
&quot;out of the box&quot; thinker. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
To also to a lesser extent Bill Murray, the Austin Powers guy (or at least<br/>
that character) and Tim Allen.  It&#39;s funny because I&#39;ll enjoy movies they&#39;re<br/>
in and then thinking back get an uncomfortable feeling about having enjoyed<br/>
it. (Though that&#39;s not true of Groundhog&#39;s Day and The Santa Clause. And I<br/>
adore Galaxy Quest! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think I get this feeling of insincerity. Even if the endings show a turn<br/>
around for the character, the whole rest of the movie is all about scamming<br/>
people into believing they&#39;re sincere and that unconsiously overwhelms the<br/>
ending in my memories of the movie.<br/>
