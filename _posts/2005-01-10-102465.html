<div id="ygrps-yiv-398746687">Well, we are back.  Jackson&#39;s father died while we were in South  Dakota.  We <br/>
arrived on Wednesday night and spent 2 days with him.  He  was talkative and <br/>
alert for those 2 days and we spent that time talking with  him, having meals <br/>
with him and even stayed up and celebrated the new year with  him.<br/>
 <br/>
Then we got a call on Saturday morning from Jody, Jackson&#39;s brother, saying  <br/>
that his dad was failing fast.  We went out to the house, Jackson&#39;s dad had  <br/>
been staying with Jody for about 2 weeks, and Jody was shaving his dad with  <br/>
tears running down his face.  It was very touching when you think about the  <br/>
family dynamics.  They were never a touchy-feely family.  Never hugged  or said <br/>
&quot;I love you&quot; etc.  Their parents were not openly  loving to them when they were <br/>
children, locking them in the basement and  closet as punishment, spanking <br/>
etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Jackson helped his brother finish shaving and changing his dad then they  sat <br/>
there with him one on each side holding his hands until he died.  He  <br/>
acknowledged their presence with nods and seemed to understand what they were  saying <br/>
up until about 30 minutes before he died.  Jackson got the chance to  tell <br/>
his dad that he loved him, something very emotional for Jackson.  <br/>
 <br/>
The boys did well.  I let them be as involved or not involved as they  liked. <br/>
 Dallen (10) wanted to see Grampa George before he died so he  sat on <br/>
Jackson&#39;s lap for a few minutes before he died and Jackson  and Dallen cried <br/>
together.  He said Good-bye to Grampa George and  wanted to sit with me for a while, <br/>
so we went into the livingroom and just sat  there for a few minutes crying.  <br/>
At that point Phillip (7) joined us on the  couch and cried too.  Then their <br/>
cousin Wesley came and said that sometimes  when he is feeling sad he plays on <br/>
the PS2 and that helps him feel a little  better so they all went to the family <br/>
room to play PS2.  After Jackson&#39;s  father died I asked each of them if they <br/>
wanted to see him one more time and  Dallen did.  He went up to Grampa George <br/>
(reclined in his recliner still)  and touched his hand and said Good-bye <br/>
again.  Phillip did not want to go  so he didn&#39;t, he continued to play on the PS2.  <br/>
 <br/>
We spent the day with family and making phone calls to extend out  stay.  <br/>
When we went home that night I let the boys know that if they needed  to talk <br/>
about anything they could.  Dallen cried during the prayer service  and funeral.  <br/>
But is doing well.  There were extra hugs all week,  extra &quot;I love you&quot;s  <br/>
more touching, and the boys took it upon  themselves to draw pictures of our <br/>
immediate family, giving them to Jackson  and I as presents.  Very nice and <br/>
heartfelt.  They have seemed to need  to do more together as a family since then.  <br/>
And that is OK too.  <br/>
 <br/>
It was all very nice and sweet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-669147291">How great that you gave the boys a choice whether to be with or away at all <br/>
those stages of their grandfather&#39;s death.   You did a really good thing, it <br/>
seems.   Thanks for the details about the healing things done by your husband <br/>
and his brother, too.  Sounds way better than it could have been with just a few <br/>
changes.  They did good things too.<br/>
