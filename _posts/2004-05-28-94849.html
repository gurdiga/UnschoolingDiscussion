<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I am!  I am!  That&#39;s the main thing I try to communicate to the<br/>
kids everyday, but other than Sarah, the 10 yo, they are still just<br/>
too ego-centric to have any real empathy outside of how it will<br/>
affect them.  (ie:  If mom&#39;s feeling happy, she won&#39;t yell.)  Just<br/>
hearing someone recognize that I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed helps.  Thank<br/>
you so much Robyn.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me alot of the &quot;Playful Parenting&quot; advice I&#39;ve read<br/>
about, and I&#39;m trying to get better at this.  It&#39;s hard for me not<br/>
to just react sometimes, but I will keep trying.  I remember being<br/>
so much more relaxed and playful with my older son when he was<br/>
little.  I was so much younger and less stressed out, I guess.  He<br/>
was easy and there was only one of him.  Now I am having trouble not<br/>
feeling resentful, guilty and tired-out.  I do have moments when I<br/>
am being very mindful in my interactions with my children, where I<br/>
feel true compassion for them and remember that they are young and<br/>
learning, and my love for them flows easily and abundantly.  At<br/>
those times, I can more easily figure out what they need and I am<br/>
more creative in my efforts to help them. I just wish I could be<br/>
that mindful and peaceful more often.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>acquiring<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; siblings presumably.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sarah is very helpful, actually, because she plays with the girls (3<br/>
and 4 yo) so much, but I don&#39;t want to take advantage of her for the<br/>
very reasons you mention.  I&#39;m quite money poor at the moment, so I<br/>
can&#39;t pay her that way, but I do reward her in other ways (she<br/>
collects shells and when I find a particularly nice one, I give it<br/>
to her as a thank you.  I also spend time with just her after the<br/>
kids go to bed, even when I&#39;d just rather be alone.  She enjoys<br/>
this, I think (as do I most of the time!)  I will say that she is<br/>
every bit as messy as they are if not more so.  She is her mother&#39;s<br/>
only child, and is only with me temporarily.  Her mother has never<br/>
expected her to clean up after herself and is very relaxed about<br/>
clutter.  (how I wish I could be that way at times!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, part of the reason I&#39;m feeling so overwhelmed is because<br/>
since Sarah has been here, my four year old, Stella, wants to do<br/>
nothing but play with her big sister.  When I ask her to help me<br/>
tidy her room for instance, she answers, &quot;No.  I&#39;m playing with<br/>
Sarah&quot; in a really snotty voice.  This really ticks me off<br/>
sometimes.  Her attitude towards me is so ugly when her sister is<br/>
here.  So, I guess there is a tradeoff in having Sarah&#39;s help.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One thing that some folks use is to spread out a large groundsheet<br/>
 </span></blockquote>on which<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to do art work or puzzles. It can be a quick tidy to pick up the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>aside in a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; higgledy piggledy manner.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read about doing this before, but forgot--thanks.  I could do<br/>
this in the patio area of the house we are in, and actually we<br/>
already do use the patio for particularly messy art.  The huge patio<br/>
is enclosed, the floors are concrete and since it still has much of<br/>
the owners construction mess in it and isn&#39;t a place where I want to<br/>
hang out, I don&#39;t really care what the kids do in it.  They have<br/>
been painting in there and playing with chalk.  I even let them just<br/>
leave the paints out and I periodically check and see if the brushes<br/>
need caring for, etc...  This is huge for me!  My natural tendency<br/>
is to nag them about taking care of their things, and to put<br/>
everything in it&#39;s place again.  :)  A drawback to the patio is that<br/>
it isn&#39;t heated, and we live on the Washington coast where it often<br/>
gets chilly even in summer.  I suppose we could put a space heater<br/>
in there for those days, although it&#39;s huge and un-insulated, so<br/>
that could be expensive.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel badly about banishing them from the house to play.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t asked them how they feel about it, though.  If we spruce up<br/>
a particular area with shelves for their puzzles and supplies, it<br/>
could be their very own baby-free play-space!  They may go for that<br/>
and if they have some say in how it&#39;s set up, they&#39;ll really be<br/>
happy.  It could be a new project!  Especially with dad coming--he<br/>
could help by building the shelves or whatever. I know they want to<br/>
find a mutually agreeable solution to the problems we&#39;ve been<br/>
having.    <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>older ones<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in their activities to one place, perhaps you can make a &quot;safe<br/>
 </span></blockquote>room&quot; or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fenced off area for the baby to be mobile and free in.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Believe me, this would be a wonderful option, except the floor plan<br/>
in this house prevents it, unless I wanted to gate him inside one of<br/>
the bedrooms, which I wouldn&#39;t do.  He likes to be a part of the<br/>
action too much and I wouldn&#39;t be able to supervise him.  As it is,<br/>
he really screeches when all the girls are outside and he can see<br/>
them through the sliding glass door or the low window, but can&#39;t go<br/>
out himself because I&#39;m busy inside.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>standard as the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; public or shared areas of the house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tend to agree with and strive for this, even though I have trouble<br/>
with it (I hate going into their room to help them dress or tell<br/>
them bedtime stories, only to step on and break a toy that was<br/>
hidden under some clothes on the floor--it hurts and they&#39;re out<br/>
another toy!)This is something I have been specifically working on.<br/>
In fact, I privately decided to ignore the mess in their room--just<br/>
let it be however they wanted it.  I succeeded for about 36 hours!<br/>
I just couldn&#39;t stand that clean and dirty clothes were left all<br/>
over the room, along with puzzle pieces(all mixed together willy<br/>
nilly) and library books (I have to point out damage to a book<br/>
nearly every time I return them to the library!) and markers and<br/>
pastels, etc...  Besides the fact they can&#39;t possibly enjoy their<br/>
things if they are lost, hidden or broken, the house doesn&#39;t belong<br/>
to me and I don&#39;t want them ruining the (unfortunately)white carpets<br/>
with art supplies.  (An acquaintance is renting this house to us<br/>
VERY CHEAPLY because we are experiencing some financial hardship<br/>
right now, and I really don&#39;t want her to regret helping us out.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL--This is probably good advice.  Thank you for the link.  It took<br/>
me a long time to post here for help and support.  I&#39;m glad I did,<br/>
but as usual, I&#39;m embarrassed by admitting my inability to cope, and<br/>
also by the fact that when I do start talking, I REALLY unload.  I<br/>
constantly worry that I&#39;m so needy that I will just drive people<br/>
away.  I also have the fear of having to be there for yet another<br/>
person--even a friend. (Does this make sense?)<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh, I am a mess.  I&#39;m sorry this is so long, and I hope I don&#39;t<br/>
sound like I&#39;m finding excuses to not try the things you mention.<br/>
It&#39;s just that I try all the time and just seem to continually fail<br/>
overall.  I do really appreciate your comments and suggestions.  I<br/>
just need more.  Maybe the main help I need is in breaking my<br/>
reactive habits.  How do you go from a very verbally reactive person<br/>
to one who takes a few moments to calm down before she speaks or<br/>
acts?  How do you change for good, and not just for days or<br/>
moments?  Practice, I guess?  Any ideas?<br/>
