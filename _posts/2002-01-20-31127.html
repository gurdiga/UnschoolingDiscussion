<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615320216">In writing that last post, I was thinking about all the different things in<br/>
our lives that influence how we think/feel about things, our values and<br/>
priorities.  One of my &quot;hot buttons&quot; is when people see themselves as<br/>
victims of their life&#39;s choices.  (I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re doing this, Pat--I<br/>
know that much of what you&#39;re writing is theoretical in order to understand<br/>
your own values....and with all I know you&#39;re competent at, I don&#39;t see you<br/>
in that role at all...the conversation just prompted these new thoughts for<br/>
me...giving you some insight into some of my own strong feelings about<br/>
certain things.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a sister who is mentally ill and an alcoholic.  She really relishes<br/>
the &quot;victim&quot; role and feels like life has been so unfair to her.  I do<br/>
believe that some of her choices are crippled because of her mental illness,<br/>
but also see so many times when she did have rational, clear-thinking<br/>
choices and she chose the victim route intentionally.  She has caused our<br/>
family a lot of heartache because of it.  That&#39;s why &quot;empowered choices&quot; are<br/>
a particularly touchy subject for me.  <br/>
<br/>
An old friend of mine made very different parenting choices from me, but I<br/>
could look at her life and see *why* she made those kinds of choices.  Her<br/>
own childhood was very unstable and she valued &quot;independence&quot; very strongly<br/>
as she had learned as a child that she couldn&#39;t count on anyone.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
judge her for these choices--or even think any less of her at all for them.<br/>
I whole-heartedly understood why she was compelled to make these choices.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.....regarding all of the educational and parenting choices dialogue,<br/>
and knowing how much Pat is wrestling with some of these ideas, I just<br/>
wanted to say I really respect her--and many of the rest of you as I&#39;ve seen<br/>
you post--for the courage to examine your ideas....as I examine my own.   We<br/>
all make choices for heart-wrenching and heart-filling reasons.  Just<br/>
because these are my ideas doesn&#39;t mean I think for a minute that they&#39;re<br/>
right for Pat or for anyone else.  And my ideas are rarely set-in-stone!<br/>
Dialogue like this just helps me examine them--a process I enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

I also have a strong aversion to the &quot;victim mentality&quot;.  This is probably because I have worked very hard to overcome a difficult childhood and not be a victim myself.  My siblings,all three,on the other hand, have never overcome their difficulties.  My parents are both dead. When my siblings and I get together at holidays, we often talk about our childhood.  As I see how their lives have been affected, I have become more angry at my parents for their ignorance. My siblings on the other hand can&#39;t understand this.  They say they forgive my parents because they say they didn&#39;t know any better and they themselves never want to be judged for the flaws they have as parents.  Unfortunately, their children are already suffering. I remember when I was dealing with my own problems and I found out what was causing them, I got very angry and it was that anger that gave me the energy to move forward. I want to be a good parent.  It is very important to me.<br/>
<br/>
Leslie and all others on this list, I am not thin skinned and appreciate your unedited thoughts and opinions.  That is why I ask.  <br/>
