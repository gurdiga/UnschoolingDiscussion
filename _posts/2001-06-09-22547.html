<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048094284">Hello from Melbourne...<br/>
<br/>
Now my main interest in unschooling is because I have a bright-eyed, <br/>
curious, nearly one year old son whom I would like to see stay that way!<br/>
though I&#39;ve actually been interested in Education for much longer than that<br/>
 (first my own, and then others as I studied this in University).<br/>
<br/>
Although I have a degree in Elementary Education from Illinois State <br/>
University, I developed other interests (mostly due to teacher &quot;glut&quot; at <br/>
the time I graduated), continued studies and became a librarian. So, my <br/>
other area of interest with home education lies in how librarians and libraries<br/>
 can help support learners. [If you have any stories or examples on both the <br/>
&quot;postive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; experiences with librarians and libraries as home <br/>
educators I would be interested in hearing about these. This is still a strong <br/>
area of interest for me and I would like to help librarians and libraries continue<br/>
 to improve even if I never &quot;officially&quot; work in one again. ]<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful to those who  have &quot;documented&quot; their journey online!<br/>
I think from what I&#39;ve been reading on  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/">http://www.unschooling.com/</a> and other <br/>
such sites that it is time I hit the books,  did some serioius study, thinking, and <br/>
develop my philosophy of education. So far I&#39;ve had trouble locating resources <br/>
[even going to the State Library of Victoria] has only produced small amounts. <br/>
I have however signed up to go to a conference on this coming Monday for <br/>
homeschoolers and a follow-up one in October so I think this more direct approach <br/>
will be fruitful. <br/>
<br/>
Back to my main interest... all those that have actually started unschooling from <br/>
word go (birth) I&#39;d be interested in finding out more about what I can be doing.<br/>
I&#39;m trying to be an observant and patient parent, but could use help in the &quot;providing<br/>
an environment&quot; and knowing how to help not hinder learning and creativity.<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Monica K. Green<br/>
<br/>
Also, if there are any others in Australia on this list I wouldn&#39;t mind an e-mail from you!<br/>
It&#39;s good to know one is &quot;not alone&quot;.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-294471410">So it seems from Betsy and Tami&#39;s letters that one issue<br/>
would be the amount of books allowed to be borrowed <br/>
from the library.  I guess in the city library case, Betsy, you&#39;d <br/>
definitely would want each family member to have a <br/>
card of their own. <br/>
<br/>
I would think not only transport (whether carrying or little red wagons)<br/>
would be something you&#39;d need to solve, but also keeping track of the<br/>
amount of books (each book even...) in order to return them. I&#39;m sure<br/>
you both and probably others would have suggestions on this topic.<br/>
<br/>
Other issues I thought about... (granted these would effect schooled children too)<br/>
Also, what about the environment of the library... is it an inviting place<br/>
for children as well as adults to explore, or more like a supermarket of<br/>
books and the exploring takes place at home within the covers?<br/>
<br/>
How much interaction do librarians provide to children, parents? <br/>
Are they accessible? <br/>
<br/>
What my main issue so far with libraries has been trying to actually locate<br/>
resources even on the background for home education. I&#39;m online tonight <br/>
and am finding probably more than I thought was there (State Library of <br/>
Victoria) because I&#39;m approaching the search with names of authors instead <br/>
of trying to search by keyword and subject.Thanks to what I&#39;ve found online recently.<br/>

(For a second there I thought Betsy took my term &quot;support&quot; as in physical, I know<br/>
while working in the library I definitely had days in which the cart was holding me<br/>
up as I shelved books!)<br/>

Our library gives a printout when you check the books out.  Before they did <br/>
that, there were times when I set all the spines of the books on the <br/>
photocopy machine and made my own list.<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque doesn&#39;t charge for overdue, and they&#39;ll send you a notice listing <br/>
the books you have out, so that covers it here.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I missed the beginning of this but here&#39;s our setup if it helps.<br/>
<br/>
1 smallish regular library 2 miles away -- very helpful librarians, <br/>
after-school homework times, children&#39;s section, pretty much a normal library <br/>
I would think.<br/>
<br/>
Another one very similar, a little smaller, about 20 minutes away, but near <br/>
my son&#39;s piano so we browse there while we wait.<br/>
<br/>
BUT -- the big library is neat!  The adults have the downstairs and the kids <br/>
have the upstairs.  Upstairs has an activity room with lots of bins full of <br/>
stuff -- science stuff or train tracks or videos and a game that go together <br/>
or puzzles or origami books ad supplies or dinosaur stuff, etc.  Then they <br/>
have a kid-sized couches and tables reading area.  There are bean bags on the <br/>
other side for the bigger kids.  Lots of computers -- although during the <br/>
summer there was an actual waiting period of about 5 minutes to get on one <br/>
last week.  Then the books -- smaller kids one one side of the room -- older <br/>
kids on the other.  Everyone wanders back and forth but it is well-organized. <br/>
 The librarians do not check out books.  That is done downstairs on the way <br/>
out -- for yourself if you don&#39;t want to wait for a librarian to do it.  So <br/>
the librarians and aides (3-4 I&#39;m guessing) are available to help and answer <br/>
questions.  They also have speakers come in -- magician, bat lecture, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really nice set up and all on line too if you want to check on <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
And they are very nice to hsers.  Not specifically desigend for us but very <br/>
nice.<br/>
<br/>
And they have recently started having more evening and Sunday afternoon hours.<br/>
<br/>
We like it!<br/>

Ours has both a shoulder strap with padding and a carry handle. Have used it for a few years now without problems. Regular totes last about two months with my kids.<br/>
