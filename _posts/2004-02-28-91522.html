<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116868641">I am looking for resources to research a little more on homeschooling <br/>
in Pennsylvania.  I know it&#39;s a more difficult state to be a <br/>
homeschooler in.  I currently live in IN but would like to move back <br/>
home with my children soon to PA where all our family is.  My two <br/>
daughters are only 4 and 1.5, so I have a little time to research.  <br/>
I&#39;m looking to talk to homeschoolers/unschoolers who have &quot;gotten <br/>
around&quot; the laws in PA and just how they did that.  Or if anyone <br/>
knows of yahoo or msn groups of PA home/unschoolers that can keep my <br/>
supplied with hints and tips to get around PA laws... I want to be <br/>
prepared and do my homework before moving to PA and defending my <br/>
choice to NOT enroll my kids in public school.<br/>
<br/>
All help and advice would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021451989">My children aren&#39;t yet old enough to have to register (8 in PA), so I haven&#39;t yet had to deal with the laws.  My understanding is that it varies greatly depending on where in PA you live.  In Pittsburgh where I am, it is very easy as I understand it, there are several unschooling friendly evaluators and no one wants to see your portfolio.  If you are considering the Pittsburgh area, the email list for the homeschooling group  that I am in is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:palscommunity@yahoogroups.com">palscommunity@yahoogroups.com</a>.   It is non-religious, tending toward the crunchy and has many people unschooling.<br/>
