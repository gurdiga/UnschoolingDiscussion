<div id="ygrps-yiv-237309077">Hi, I gave an answer to the person asking about the<br/>
Pharoah game, but it went to her email and not to the<br/>
group. Sorry. :( I don&#39;t  know what I did wrong. But<br/>
anyway, you can find the game at Walmart and probably<br/>
other places. I admire my son because he doesn&#39;t<br/>
accept gifts of slaves from other rulers, even though<br/>
the slaves would save him money on labor. He knows<br/>
it&#39;s just a game, but the idea of owning even pretend<br/>
slaves is abhorrent to him. *sniff* I&#39;m so proud! :)<br/>
In this series, there are also games of Zeus, King<br/>
Arthur, Cleopatra, etc. We&#39;re all hoping a Queen<br/>
Elizabeth I game will come out sooner or later. Juli<br/>
