<br/>
Get yourself a copy of the &quot;Pink Book&quot;  Go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.k12.wa.us/LearnTeachSupp/HomeBased/">http://www.k12.wa.us/LearnTeachSupp/HomeBased/</a> and click on the link for<br/>
Resources: Washington State&#39;s Laws Regulating Home-Based Instruction &quot;Pink<br/>
Book&quot; (pdf).  This is the state law.  Read it for yourself, as it is the<br/>
parent&#39;s responsibility to know their state law.  (Maybe you already have<br/>
this.)<br/>
<br/>
Then contact WA and local support groups to find out how other&#39;s interpret<br/>
the law.<br/>
<br/>
Check out Washington Homeschool Organization for accurate information on<br/>
homeschool laws in WA, support groups, and more.  www.washhomeschool.org<br/>

I have used FLO for the annual assessment and have been very happy with it.<br/>
The state wants us to cover 11 subjects.  (The subjects are all listed in<br/>
the pink book.)  FLO has a form that lists the subjects.  I made lists under<br/>
each heading of the things my child did for that subject.  After I return<br/>
the form to them, a certificated teacher looks it over, comments, and sends<br/>
it back.<br/>
