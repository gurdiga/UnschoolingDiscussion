<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447867044">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying this list for months and have learned a great deal <br/>
from you all. My dilemma may seem odd to you -- it seems odd to me! <br/>
But I would love to have the feedback of this wise and experienced <br/>
group to a decision I&#39;m currently facing over whether to send my <br/>
older daughter to kindergarten part-time next year.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my situation: I&#39;ve been committed to homeschooling my kids <br/>
(now 2 and 5) since the late &#39;80&#39;s, before I even knew when or <br/>
whether or with whom I&#39;d have them. I&#39;m still committed to <br/>
homeschooling them, and unschooling is the way I&#39;d like to go. <br/>
But . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square <br/>
miles) in northern California with a truly wonderful elementary <br/>
school. Four grades in two classrooms, K-1 and 2-3, with about 25 <br/>
students altogether. (From 4th grade through high school kids are <br/>
bussed 1/2 hour to the next town.) We have no preschool or organized <br/>
childcare, so it&#39;s the first such experience for most of the <br/>
kindergartners. The kids have a beautiful meadow and a small grove of <br/>
redwood trees to run around in, in addition to swings, slides, ball <br/>
court, etc. There are two teachers, two part-time aides, and some <br/>
volunteers. The head teacher, an accomplished fiddler in her spare <br/>
time,  has 27 years at this school and loves our quirky  little <br/>
community (think &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; without the snow and you get a <br/>
good feel for our town), and it loves her. The kindergarten <br/>
curriculum is very play oriented, with lots of time for free play <br/>
with blocks, dress up, art, etc. They sing every day. The kids are <br/>
taught by word and deed to respect and be interested in and care for <br/>
one another. And they do. The school has the feeling of a loving <br/>
extended family. <br/>
<br/>
In the ten years I&#39;ve lived here, more than one person has used the <br/>
word &quot;magical&quot; to me in talking about their experience at this <br/>
school. More than one teenager or twentysomething has said, in <br/>
essence, &quot;School is (was) horrible, but my kindergarten year with <br/>
Judy was wonderful and it gave me warm, fuzzy memories I&#39;ll treasure <br/>
my whole life.&quot; I&#39;ve always known this school was pretty special, and <br/>
have joked that if anything could lure me away from homeschooling, it <br/>
would be this teacher. Now, having spent a day there with my daughter <br/>
last week, it&#39;s not a joke anymore!<br/>
<br/>
This is probably the best chance my kids will ever have to experience <br/>
group life in a positive, nurturing setting. Girl Scouts, 4-H, <br/>
gymnastics lessons (all at least 1/2 hour away), camp, whatever, just <br/>
don&#39;t have the same continuity and intimacy that this school offers, <br/>
and there&#39;s no cohesive HS support group in our area. Our tiny town, <br/>
which I love,  has a very strong identity and this school is a big <br/>
part of it, and I&#39;d like my daughter to bond and develop some <br/>
friendships with the other kids her age in our community.<br/>
<br/>
The school is very flexible and will let my daugher attend just three <br/>
days a week, for a total of 11 hours. (The teacher, knowing I planned <br/>
to homeschool, has been asking me hopefully since my daughter was two <br/>
whether she&#39;d get to have her in her class.) WE could take time off <br/>
for travel anytime. My daughter seems ready and will be even more so <br/>
by fall. She already knows and likes at least half the kids who would <br/>
be in her K-1 class.<br/>
<br/>
The experience she would have is exactly what I&#39;d want for her for <br/>
kindergarten -- the chance to mix it up in a happy, supportive group <br/>
and learn something about herself in relation to other people, both <br/>
adults and children. &quot;Socializing&quot; in the most positive sense of the <br/>
word, if you will. Academically she&#39;d learn a few things and have <br/>
some fun, but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m aiming for at this point in <br/>
her life. Since it&#39;s a mixed K-1 classroom, she&#39;s not likely to be <br/>
bored in the areas she&#39;s ahead in, and the kids all work at their own <br/>
pace anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the fact that it&#39;s not what I had originally planned, at <br/>
this point I can&#39;t think of any reason not to send her. Even dh, who <br/>
is *very* anti-school (though he&#39;d never heard of homeschooling till <br/>
he met me!), think it&#39;s a good idea. And this is where I&#39;d like some <br/>
help -- am I missing something? Are there pitfalls I&#39;m not aware of <br/>
or questions I should be asking myself (or someone else) that I&#39;m <br/>
not? We would want only to do the kindergarten year. First grade very <br/>
possibly, but it would take up many more hours in the week, and I <br/>
also think that more than one or two years at school it would hold <br/>
her back intellectually. (Besides, I&#39;d miss her too much!) The one <br/>
concern I have is that she may resist staying home for first grade <br/>
after having enjoyed kindergarten. (Though a well-timed month-long <br/>
trip that October may help her over that!)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re still reading, sorry I went on so long! But I wanted to <br/>
give as thorough a picture as possible of our situation. Any <br/>
thoughts, ideas, experiences, you can offer to help me make the right <br/>
decision would be very much appreciated. No flames, please, but I <br/>
welcome insights and discussion from all points of view.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for your wisdom (and patience!)<br/>

I guess it just depends on what you want for your child. I personally find<br/>
any group that is fashioned similar to school too limiting.  We had a home<br/>
school play group and even though all the mom&#39;s were there (and were quite<br/>
nice) and there were only 6 families, it ended up feeling like school.  We<br/>
learned to wait in line, to listen to apologies when we got knocked down<br/>
(sometimes), to question why someone would do such and such, to feel left<br/>
out...... I could go on and on.  Some people think children need to deal<br/>
with adversity as kids in order to learn to deal with it as an adult.  I do<br/>
not agree with that.<br/>
<br/>
I found that having a close friend or a few close friends is much more<br/>
rewarding than being aquaintances with a larger group of peers.  It sounds<br/>
all warm and fuzzy, but will it really be all that?  Is your child an<br/>
introvert or an extrovert?  My own introverted children just do not enjoy<br/>
groups of people as well as they enjoy one on one playdates.  One of my<br/>
daughters expressed that she wanted to go, ( I think it sounded appealing)<br/>
but she always looked lost and miserable while she was there.  If you are<br/>
doing it because you think it is her only chance to have that warm fuzzy<br/>
feeling of caring and belonging to a group, I think your thoughts are as<br/>
misguided as mine were. (no offense intended) It is just that it sounds<br/>
better on the outside than it really is in real life.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry that I am unable to articulate what I am feeling.  I wish I could<br/>
get my thoughts on to paper better.<br/>

     *Sounds like fun.  Go with her - they do allow moms and dads to <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a guess...but I will about bet there are many who will disagree with<br/>
what I&#39;m about to say...<br/>
<br/>
You have listed  a lot of wonderful reason TO send your daughter to this<br/>
program.  As I read your post, it occurs to me that about the only problem<br/>
you have with making that decision and feeling comfortable with it is that<br/>
it is labeled &#39;kindergarten&#39; and &#39;public school&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So, if it were me, I would remind myself that no one else knows my child or<br/>
my circumstances as well as I do and make the decision my family will be<br/>
most comfortable with.  The rest of the crowd be hanged.<br/>
<br/>
I am making a couple of assumptions here.  One is that you are not required<br/>
to commit to 12 years of ps just because DD goes to ps kindergarten (I don&#39;t<br/>
think that&#39;s the case anywhere in the country, but you never know).  And<br/>
that any extra hoops you may have to jump through to extricate your DD. from<br/>
the system after next year will be worth it to you.  (In some cases it is<br/>
MUCH easier to start out as homeschoolers than to leave the ps system to<br/>
homeschool.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I do have one caution...it may be difficult for your DD to leave<br/>
behind her friends next year and return home to continue her education.  If<br/>
it were me, I&#39;d be sure to take steps to help her with that future<br/>
adjustment from the beginning.  But that&#39;s me.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth...go for it!  Enjoy the rich environment your daughter<br/>
will be exposed to.  Attend with her on a regular basis, if you can.  Make<br/>
it a family affair.  That may make it easier for DD to make the adjustment<br/>
to being back home after her kindergarten year and you&#39;ll know what&#39;s going<br/>
on because you are there with her.<br/>
<br/>
I see no reason to reject a program that fits your lifestyle, needs and<br/>
desires.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck either way!<br/>
<br/>
Personal story so you have a little idea of where I&#39;m coming from...our<br/>
youngest child has never attended ps.  His birthday is late in the year, so<br/>
he missed the dates to attend kindergarten the same year his cousins started<br/>
school (4 of them born the same year and very close to each other).<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to go and was very prepared by all the ps standards.  I asked the<br/>
school if they would waive the birthday requirement and they would not even<br/>
entertain the idea.  I was peeved at the time.  In fact, it got really<br/>
interesting because my ds (youngest of the pack of 4 cousins) was the most<br/>
excited about the idea of school, was actually reading and had been doing<br/>
mental math for over a year at that time.  OTOH the other cousins, who were<br/>
required to attend ps (by their parents...they are all aware of homeschool<br/>
options), hated going to school!  Every one of the families had a struggle<br/>
getting the little darlings to cooperate and get to school on time and<br/>
behave themselves while they were there.<br/>
<br/>
My DS and I?  We have totally enjoyed homeschooling and never looked back.<br/>
He quickly lost any sense of missing out and there has been more than one<br/>
occasion where the cousins are obviously jealous because DS doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
do school all day every day.  I would never have believed it at the time,<br/>
but the local district actually did me a favor by keeping us out of the<br/>
system at the only time I&#39;ve ever been tempted to join their ranks.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I would never judge someone else for making a different<br/>
decision.  IMO that&#39;s what homeschooling is about:  keeping the options open<br/>
so families can make the decisions that are best for them.  I just thought<br/>
you might like to know how it worked out for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725206396">Ok, just to play devil&#39;s advocate, here are some questions:<br/>
<br/>
What if your child doesn&#39;t feel like singing everyday?<br/>
If you are looking for the feeling of a loving extended family, why not just<br/>
use your own?<br/>
You say you want her to have friendships with the kids her age in town, then<br/>
later say she already knows half the kids.  Does she need to go to school to<br/>
meet the other half?<br/>
Why has this teacher wanted to get your daughter in her class so badly?  Is<br/>
she opposed to home schooling?<br/>
Are you under the impression that all of the socialization that takes place<br/>
will be positive?<br/>
Do you feel confident that in being taught some academics she won&#39;t lose<br/>
some of her innate curiosity and desire to learn on her own?<br/>
Do you want to put your life on a school schedule?<br/>
Is your daughter comfortable having to ask someone&#39;s permission to use the<br/>
bathroom?<br/>
Are you and she comfortable with her having to eat on the school&#39;s schedule<br/>
instead of her own?<br/>
Are you and she comfortable with her having to sit down when she wants to<br/>
run, listen when she wants to sing, draw when she wants to jump, be inside<br/>
when she wants to be outside?<br/>
<br/>
These are the first questions that came to mind for me.  I agree with<br/>
whoever posted that if it feels right to your family, then it&#39;s right.  I<br/>
also think that if I wasn&#39;t really sure, I wouldn&#39;t do it.  Usually when I<br/>
doubt something, there&#39;s a good reason (even if I can&#39;t put my finger on<br/>
it).   My daughter did go to kindergarten, I liked her teacher and spent 2<br/>
days a week in her classroom, and it did not feel right to us for the<br/>
reasons above and many others.  For us it was a year wasted when we could<br/>
have been enjoying each other&#39;s company.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, this is just our experience.  - Rue<br/>

Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying this list for months and have learned a great deal<br/>
from you all. My dilemma may seem odd to you -- it seems odd to me!<br/>
But I would love to have the feedback of this wise and experienced<br/>

But . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square<br/>

students altogether. (From 4th grade through high school kids are<br/>
bussed 1/2 hour to the next town.) We have no preschool or organized<br/>
childcare, so it&#39;s the first such experience for most of the<br/>
kindergartners. The kids have a beautiful meadow and a small grove of<br/>
redwood trees to run around in, in addition to swings, slides, ball<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
 I have experienced that if you start them off in a school setting you have<br/>
a hard time getting them to unlearn the grade thing. My middle son went to<br/>
1/2 year of kindergarten & he now is 2nd grade age (this fall) & still<br/>
worries about what grade he&#39;s in. If you are going the unschooling route<br/>
this can be very confusing for them.<br/>
 If she already knows & likes other children that would be in her class then<br/>
wouldn&#39;t she be able to continue with a relationship with them without going<br/>
to school?<br/>
 I have 3 boys ages 3, 7 & 9.  Their social interaction with children their<br/>
own age is the thing that is least important to their development. My<br/>
children interact with all ages of people much better than other children<br/>
who are in a formal school setting.<br/>
 I imagine she still has to ask permission to go to the restroom.<br/>

at specific times/ages) and she enjoys it, why not.  However, IMHO, if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy it and you should be prepared to pull her out as soon as she<br/>
shows, not necessarily verbalizes, that she isn&#39;t a happy camper.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets have choosen to &quot;do&quot; school type things over the years and if<br/>
they don&#39;t live up to their expectations, out the door they go.  Not to say,<br/>
as has been hinted by some obnoxious family members (THE mil from h*ll &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
that they are quitters, simply that they made informed decisions.  Which,<br/>
watching a 6 yo weigh in her own peculiar little way the pros and cons can<br/>
be a learning experience all in itself.  (Sitting on floor next to her<br/>
dollhouse with dolls sitting on each floor and asking them questions which<br/>
she answers, then she asked then for a consensus, although I haven&#39;t the<br/>
foggiest how she knew to use that word).<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Kindergarten dilemma (very long, sorry)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been enjoying this list for months and have learned a great deal<br/>
&gt; from you all. My dilemma may seem odd to you -- it seems odd to me!<br/>
&gt; But I would love to have the feedback of this wise and experienced<br/>
&gt; group to a decision I&#39;m currently facing over whether to send my<br/>
&gt; older daughter to kindergarten part-time next year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my situation: I&#39;ve been committed to homeschooling my kids<br/>
&gt; (now 2 and 5) since the late &#39;80&#39;s, before I even knew when or<br/>
&gt; whether or with whom I&#39;d have them. I&#39;m still committed to<br/>
&gt; homeschooling them, and unschooling is the way I&#39;d like to go.<br/>
&gt; But . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square<br/>
&gt; miles) in northern California with a truly wonderful elementary<br/>
&gt; school. Four grades in two classrooms, K-1 and 2-3, with about 25<br/>
&gt; students altogether. (From 4th grade through high school kids are<br/>
&gt; bussed 1/2 hour to the next town.) We have no preschool or organized<br/>
&gt; childcare, so it&#39;s the first such experience for most of the<br/>
&gt; kindergartners. The kids have a beautiful meadow and a small grove of<br/>
&gt; redwood trees to run around in, in addition to swings, slides, ball<br/>
&gt; court, etc. There are two teachers, two part-time aides, and some<br/>
&gt; volunteers. The head teacher, an accomplished fiddler in her spare<br/>
&gt; time,  has 27 years at this school and loves our quirky  little<br/>
&gt; community (think &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; without the snow and you get a<br/>
&gt; good feel for our town), and it loves her. The kindergarten<br/>
&gt; curriculum is very play oriented, with lots of time for free play<br/>
&gt; with blocks, dress up, art, etc. They sing every day. The kids are<br/>
&gt; taught by word and deed to respect and be interested in and care for<br/>
&gt; one another. And they do. The school has the feeling of a loving<br/>
&gt; extended family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the ten years I&#39;ve lived here, more than one person has used the<br/>
&gt; word &quot;magical&quot; to me in talking about their experience at this<br/>
&gt; school. More than one teenager or twentysomething has said, in<br/>
&gt; essence, &quot;School is (was) horrible, but my kindergarten year with<br/>
&gt; Judy was wonderful and it gave me warm, fuzzy memories I&#39;ll treasure<br/>
&gt; my whole life.&quot; I&#39;ve always known this school was pretty special, and<br/>
&gt; have joked that if anything could lure me away from homeschooling, it<br/>
&gt; would be this teacher. Now, having spent a day there with my daughter<br/>
&gt; last week, it&#39;s not a joke anymore!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is probably the best chance my kids will ever have to experience<br/>
&gt; group life in a positive, nurturing setting. Girl Scouts, 4-H,<br/>
&gt; gymnastics lessons (all at least 1/2 hour away), camp, whatever, just<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have the same continuity and intimacy that this school offers,<br/>
&gt; and there&#39;s no cohesive HS support group in our area. Our tiny town,<br/>
&gt; which I love,  has a very strong identity and this school is a big<br/>
&gt; part of it, and I&#39;d like my daughter to bond and develop some<br/>
&gt; friendships with the other kids her age in our community.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The school is very flexible and will let my daugher attend just three<br/>
&gt; days a week, for a total of 11 hours. (The teacher, knowing I planned<br/>
&gt; to homeschool, has been asking me hopefully since my daughter was two<br/>
&gt; whether she&#39;d get to have her in her class.) WE could take time off<br/>
&gt; for travel anytime. My daughter seems ready and will be even more so<br/>
&gt; by fall. She already knows and likes at least half the kids who would<br/>
&gt; be in her K-1 class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The experience she would have is exactly what I&#39;d want for her for<br/>
&gt; kindergarten -- the chance to mix it up in a happy, supportive group<br/>
&gt; and learn something about herself in relation to other people, both<br/>
&gt; adults and children. &quot;Socializing&quot; in the most positive sense of the<br/>
&gt; word, if you will. Academically she&#39;d learn a few things and have<br/>
&gt; some fun, but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m aiming for at this point in<br/>
&gt; her life. Since it&#39;s a mixed K-1 classroom, she&#39;s not likely to be<br/>
&gt; bored in the areas she&#39;s ahead in, and the kids all work at their own<br/>
&gt; pace anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Apart from the fact that it&#39;s not what I had originally planned, at<br/>
&gt; this point I can&#39;t think of any reason not to send her. Even dh, who<br/>
&gt; is *very* anti-school (though he&#39;d never heard of homeschooling till<br/>
&gt; he met me!), think it&#39;s a good idea. And this is where I&#39;d like some<br/>
&gt; help -- am I missing something? Are there pitfalls I&#39;m not aware of<br/>
&gt; or questions I should be asking myself (or someone else) that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not? We would want only to do the kindergarten year. First grade very<br/>
&gt; possibly, but it would take up many more hours in the week, and I<br/>
&gt; also think that more than one or two years at school it would hold<br/>
&gt; her back intellectually. (Besides, I&#39;d miss her too much!) The one<br/>
&gt; concern I have is that she may resist staying home for first grade<br/>
&gt; after having enjoyed kindergarten. (Though a well-timed month-long<br/>
&gt; trip that October may help her over that!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;re still reading, sorry I went on so long! But I wanted to<br/>
&gt; give as thorough a picture as possible of our situation. Any<br/>
&gt; thoughts, ideas, experiences, you can offer to help me make the right<br/>
&gt; decision would be very much appreciated. No flames, please, but I<br/>
&gt; welcome insights and discussion from all points of view.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many thanks for your wisdom (and patience!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-769523592">It sounds to me like you are feeling conflict because<br/>
you *want* to send her, but feel it goes against a<br/>
valued and long held conviction... is that right?<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is that first of all convictions are<br/>
intended to serve you, not the other way around... if<br/>
you are absolutely rigid in the application of them,<br/>
you and those around you can miss things you may<br/>
otherwise find to be wonderfully enriching, or you<br/>
could hurt yourself or others.  Life, situations<br/>
change, and guidelines for living should have some<br/>
give so that they fit your situation... a conviction<br/>
that you should spend an hour naked outdoors in the<br/>
sun every day may work wonderfully in New Mexico...<br/>
and be rather less healthy during a winter in<br/>
Minnesota.  <br/>
<br/>
So.  Your convictions re school was made long before<br/>
you ever knew about this kindergarten.  If your child<br/>
wants to try it, and you think it may be good for her,<br/>
there is no reason to think of it in terms of<br/>
irrevocable decisions... you can always pull her out<br/>
again if she isn&#39;t happy.  The point is to do whatever<br/>
*you* and *she* thinks will make her happy.  Use that<br/>
as your guideline.  IMO, of course.<br/>

Thanks for your thoughts. I would definitely pull her if she were <br/>

telling me about another part-time homeschooler whose mom was there <br/>
all the time. The mom would not let the kid out of her sight and the <br/>

My concern with this would be as someone else has <br/>
mentioned, the shedding of the grade-system, or taken <br/>
further, the deschooling needed if she were to leave, <br/>
cos it really doesn&#39;t matter how idyllic it is, it&#39;s <br/>
still a school.  Even Summerhill&#39;s still a school <br/>
(though very different :-) )  The systems of appraisal, <br/>
whatever reward-system existed, the expectations to <br/>
conform...  those things, unless absolutely compatible <br/>
with your own home-life would need to be unlearnt.  And <br/>
I can also envisage that after such an idyllic start to <br/>
school she would be greatly disillusioned by the later <br/>
stages of school (vis the people who&#39;ve told you how <br/>
awful the rest of their school career was) but still <br/>
find it difficult to shed those attributes which school <br/>
would instill.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m basically thinking &#39;why run the risk of needing to <br/>
deschool?&#39;  Why spend that time undoing what needn&#39;t be <br/>
done in the first place.  I&#39;m also thinking &#39;Where&#39;s <br/>

  &gt; (now 2 and 5) since the late &#39;80&#39;s, before I even knew when or<br/>
  &gt; whether or with whom I&#39;d have them. I&#39;m still committed to<br/>
  &gt; homeschooling them, and unschooling is the way I&#39;d like to go.<br/>
  &gt; But . . . we live in a very small town (pop. about 700 in 100 square<br/>
  &gt; miles) in northern California with a truly wonderful elementary<br/>
  &gt; school. Four grades in two classrooms, K-1 and 2-3, with about 25<br/>
  &gt; students altogether. (From 4th grade through high school kids are<br/>
  &gt; bussed 1/2 hour to the next town.) We have no preschool or organized<br/>
  &gt; childcare, so it&#39;s the first such experience for most of the<br/>
  &gt; kindergartners. The kids have a beautiful meadow and a small grove of<br/>
  &gt; redwood trees to run around in, in addition to swings, slides, ball<br/>
  &gt; court, etc. There are two teachers, two part-time aides, and some<br/>
  &gt; volunteers. The head teacher, an accomplished fiddler in her spare<br/>
  &gt; time,  has 27 years at this school and loves our quirky  little<br/>
  &gt; community (think &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; without the snow and you get a<br/>
  &gt; good feel for our town), and it loves her. The kindergarten<br/>
  &gt; curriculum is very play oriented, with lots of time for free play<br/>
  &gt; with blocks, dress up, art, etc. They sing every day. The kids are<br/>
  &gt; taught by word and deed to respect and be interested in and care for<br/>
  &gt; one another. And they do. The school has the feeling of a loving<br/>
  &gt; extended family.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; In the ten years I&#39;ve lived here, more than one person has used the<br/>
  &gt; word &quot;magical&quot; to me in talking about their experience at this<br/>
  &gt; school. More than one teenager or twentysomething has said, in<br/>
  &gt; essence, &quot;School is (was) horrible, but my kindergarten year with<br/>
  &gt; Judy was wonderful and it gave me warm, fuzzy memories I&#39;ll treasure<br/>
  &gt; my whole life.&quot; I&#39;ve always known this school was pretty special, and<br/>
  &gt; have joked that if anything could lure me away from homeschooling, it<br/>
  &gt; would be this teacher. Now, having spent a day there with my daughter<br/>
  &gt; last week, it&#39;s not a joke anymore!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; This is probably the best chance my kids will ever have to experience<br/>
  &gt; group life in a positive, nurturing setting. Girl Scouts, 4-H,<br/>
  &gt; gymnastics lessons (all at least 1/2 hour away), camp, whatever, just<br/>
  &gt; don&#39;t have the same continuity and intimacy that this school offers,<br/>
  &gt; and there&#39;s no cohesive HS support group in our area. Our tiny town,<br/>
  &gt; which I love,  has a very strong identity and this school is a big<br/>
  &gt; part of it, and I&#39;d like my daughter to bond and develop some<br/>
  &gt; friendships with the other kids her age in our community.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; The school is very flexible and will let my daugher attend just three<br/>
  &gt; days a week, for a total of 11 hours. (The teacher, knowing I planned<br/>
  &gt; to homeschool, has been asking me hopefully since my daughter was two<br/>
  &gt; whether she&#39;d get to have her in her class.) WE could take time off<br/>
  &gt; for travel anytime. My daughter seems ready and will be even more so<br/>
  &gt; by fall. She already knows and likes at least half the kids who would<br/>
  &gt; be in her K-1 class.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; The experience she would have is exactly what I&#39;d want for her for<br/>
  &gt; kindergarten -- the chance to mix it up in a happy, supportive group<br/>
  &gt; and learn something about herself in relation to other people, both<br/>
  &gt; adults and children. &quot;Socializing&quot; in the most positive sense of the<br/>
  &gt; word, if you will. Academically she&#39;d learn a few things and have<br/>
  &gt; some fun, but that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m aiming for at this point in<br/>
  &gt; her life. Since it&#39;s a mixed K-1 classroom, she&#39;s not likely to be<br/>
  &gt; bored in the areas she&#39;s ahead in, and the kids all work at their own<br/>
  &gt; pace anyway.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Apart from the fact that it&#39;s not what I had originally planned, at<br/>
  &gt; this point I can&#39;t think of any reason not to send her. Even dh, who<br/>
  &gt; is *very* anti-school (though he&#39;d never heard of homeschooling till<br/>
  &gt; he met me!), think it&#39;s a good idea. And this is where I&#39;d like some<br/>
  &gt; help -- am I missing something? Are there pitfalls I&#39;m not aware of<br/>
  &gt; or questions I should be asking myself (or someone else) that I&#39;m<br/>
  &gt; not? We would want only to do the kindergarten year. First grade very<br/>
  &gt; possibly, but it would take up many more hours in the week, and I<br/>
  &gt; also think that more than one or two years at school it would hold<br/>
  &gt; her back intellectually. (Besides, I&#39;d miss her too much!) The one<br/>
  &gt; concern I have is that she may resist staying home for first grade<br/>
  &gt; after having enjoyed kindergarten. (Though a well-timed month-long<br/>
  &gt; trip that October may help her over that!)<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; If you&#39;re still reading, sorry I went on so long! But I wanted to<br/>
  &gt; give as thorough a picture as possible of our situation. Any<br/>
  &gt; thoughts, ideas, experiences, you can offer to help me make the right<br/>
  &gt; decision would be very much appreciated. No flames, please, but I<br/>
  &gt; welcome insights and discussion from all points of view.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Many thanks for your wisdom (and patience!)<br/>
  &gt;<br/>

  Hi Lynda,<br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks for your thoughts. I would definitely pull her <br/>
  if she were <br/>
  unhappy. The main reason I want to send her is that I <br/>
  think this <br/>
  particular year at this particular school might help <br/>
  her blossom in <br/>
  certain ways. If it&#39;s not a positive experience, <br/>
  though, then there <br/>
  is no point. <br/>
  <br/>
  BTW we are in Mendocino County. <br/>
  <br/>
  Very cute story about the dolls and the &quot;consensus&quot;!. <br/>
  We were in the <br/>
  car the other day and Willis (my 5 y.o.) was asking <br/>
  lots of questions <br/>
  about how the world began and how did the first person <br/>
  get here and <br/>
  what would happen if all the people died, and do ducks <br/>
  have ears, and <br/>
  at one point as I was answering one of her questions, <br/>
  she said, &quot;Mom, <br/>
  another quesiton just popped into my head. If it&#39;s all <br/>
  right with <br/>
  you, I&#39;d like to move on now.&quot; I was glad it was dark <br/>
  and she <br/>
  couldn&#39;t see my smile!<br/>
  <br/>
  Again, thanks for your thoughts. <br/>
  <br/>
  Ashley<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
  My concern with this would be as someone else has <br/>
  mentioned, the shedding of the grade-system, or taken <br/>
  further, the deschooling needed if she were to leave, <br/>
  cos it really doesn&#39;t matter how idyllic it is, it&#39;s <br/>
  still a school.  Even Summerhill&#39;s still a school <br/>
  (though very different :-) )  The systems of appraisal, <br/>
  whatever reward-system existed, the expectations to <br/>
  conform...  those things, unless absolutely compatible <br/>
  with your own home-life would need to be unlearnt.  And <br/>
  I can also envisage that after such an idyllic start to <br/>
  school she would be greatly disillusioned by the later <br/>
  stages of school (vis the people who&#39;ve told you how <br/>
  awful the rest of their school career was) but still <br/>
  find it difficult to shed those attributes which school <br/>
  would instill.  <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m basically thinking &#39;why run the risk of needing to <br/>
  deschool?&#39;  Why spend that time undoing what needn&#39;t be <br/>
  done in the first place.  I&#39;m also thinking &#39;Where&#39;s <br/>
  Sandra???&#39;<br/>

  I guess it just depends on what you want for your child. I personally find<br/>
  any group that is fashioned similar to school too limiting.  We had a home<br/>
  school play group and even though all the mom&#39;s were there (and were quite<br/>
  nice) and there were only 6 families, it ended up feeling like school.  We<br/>
  learned to wait in line, to listen to apologies when we got knocked down<br/>
  (sometimes), to question why someone would do such and such, to feel left<br/>
  out...... I could go on and on.  Some people think children need to deal<br/>
  with adversity as kids in order to learn to deal with it as an adult.  I<br/>
do<br/>
  not agree with that.<br/>
<br/>
  I found that having a close friend or a few close friends is much more<br/>
  rewarding than being aquaintances with a larger group of peers.  It sounds<br/>
  all warm and fuzzy, but will it really be all that?  Is your child an<br/>
  introvert or an extrovert?  My own introverted children just do not enjoy<br/>
  groups of people as well as they enjoy one on one playdates.  One of my<br/>
  daughters expressed that she wanted to go, ( I think it sounded appealing)<br/>
  but she always looked lost and miserable while she was there.  If you are<br/>
  doing it because you think it is her only chance to have that warm fuzzy<br/>
  feeling of caring and belonging to a group, I think your thoughts are as<br/>
  misguided as mine were. (no offense intended) It is just that it sounds<br/>
  better on the outside than it really is in real life.<br/>
<br/>
  I am sorry that I am unable to articulate what I am feeling.  I wish I<br/>
could<br/>
  get my thoughts on to paper better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747846022">actually I think you articulated well...Naomi is an introvert as well and has a hard time making a bunch of friends whereas I&#39;m outgoing and I make friends easily...trying to keep in touch is another matter however &lt;G&gt;. She has 3 friends at this time that I know of...that she likes to keep close touch with...Tasha (short for Natasha), Kristen and Colette. She does have friends at the church...namely the pastors daughter, Anne. But Anne&#39;s cousins who are twins and around the same age can be mean to Naomi and she has gotten to the point where she just doesn&#39;t want to associate with them at all or gets her feelings hurt easily. I&#39;m praying and trying to help her find ways where she can associate with the group without getting hurt or as the case may be lately getting angry enough to walk off in a huff.<br/>
