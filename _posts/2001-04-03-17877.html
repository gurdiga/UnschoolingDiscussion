&lt;&lt; Bobbie, I think it is better to think too much than not at all.  There are <br/>
too many people that walk around with their heads up their you-know-whats so <br/>
we have to do the thinking for them. I do think a lot but I don&#39;t worry...I <br/>
take action. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if there&#39;s no action to take, thinking a lot can be turned to <br/>
compassion.  Think soothing thought-blankets over the other people who are <br/>
irritating you.  If another driver turns without a signal or some irritating <br/>
thing, give them the possibility that they&#39;ve had a horrible day and if you <br/>
were their friend you could follow them home and give them a hug (instead of <br/>
thinking they&#39;re stupid and didn&#39;t take driver&#39;s ed or they hate you and <br/>
wanted you to rear-end them).  <br/>
<br/>
If you think zippy 110-mph all the time, consciously aim it toward a happy <br/>
memory, maybe get some postcards and address them to far away friends, and <br/>
when you&#39;re about to think yourself into a frenzy that needs calming tea or <br/>
diarrhea (I&#39;m not planning to learn to spell that, I just throw some letters <br/>
on it and sometimes it&#39;s right and often it&#39;s wrong) medicine, sit and write <br/>
something sweet to one of your friends and THAT will add to your store of <br/>
happy memories.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a kind of behavioral reconditioning, but it&#39;s cheap (free) and easy <br/>
(when you remember) and will truly make a difference in your calmness and <br/>
happiness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-571221632">Thankyou, Sandra. These are things I used to do, but<br/>
have really been out of it lately, who knows why.<br/>
Belated adjustment to Dad&#39;s death, or awkward<br/>
adjustment to new house, life, relationship...who<br/>
knows. I really don&#39;t think in as morbid of a way as I<br/>
sounded in that post, but like I said, when I worry<br/>
without reason and I know I&#39;m doing it, then I feel<br/>
like I am being a very morbid person...in comparison<br/>
to the very peaceful, compassionate  person I was<br/>
awhile ago. ( I actually got teased by my family for<br/>
being that way to an extreme, so they felt guilty any<br/>
time they complained about anyone or thing. &lt;g&gt;)I know<br/>
all these things that have been suggested to me, all<br/>
the breathing excercizes and yoga and relaxation<br/>
techniques, etc. work for me, but I am just trying to<br/>
put them into practice lately, and having a hard time<br/>
doing it in the hectic-ness of daily life. Thanks to<br/>
everyone for suggesting and caring and actually<br/>
reading that long tangent of mine. I was not as<br/>
troubled as I seemed, but I tend to get carried away<br/>
when writing about...anything. :)<br/>
Thanks, again. Caring posts are so nice to hear. <br/>
