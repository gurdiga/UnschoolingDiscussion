<div id="ygrps-yiv-910838541">We tend to be the local hang out for every stray dog around.  I like to<br/>
think it is because our home sends love and harmony out into the universe<br/>
rather than because the dogs know a sucker when they see one.<br/>
<br/>
Currently a border collie has discovered us.  It is obvious that she has<br/>
been beaten severely in the past.  She is actually a great dog, doesn&#39;t<br/>
bark, stays on the front porch, doesn&#39;t chase cars or walkers.  We&#39;ve about<br/>
decided to let her stay rather than take her to the local no-kill shelter,<br/>
BUT....she likes to herd the cat.  It wouldn&#39;t be so much of a problem<br/>
except the cat is 18yo, half blind, etc..  The cat is somewhat traumatized.<br/>
(So am I actually, watching this wonderful cat become feeble is very sad...A<br/>
couple of years ago, he regularly routed a boxer out of our yard...)<br/>
Anyway, any ideas would be helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A couple of years ago we were adopted by a wonderful Boston terrier. She had <br/>
also been a beaten, neglected dog, and she too chased the cat. I didn&#39;t want <br/>
her to do this, but I also didn&#39;t want her to feel even more abused. I had <br/>
noticed that when Darin would walk around her and talk she cowered and shook. <br/>
(now she is his baby and *someday* they are going to get married!) I decided <br/>
to just observe and the next time I caught her with the cat, I issued one <br/>
sharp *NO!* and it was all over. She looked at me, ducked her head and <br/>
whimpered, that was it and she has never bothered the cat again. Dogs that <br/>
have been abused, and have kept a sweet temperament rather than turning mean <br/>
as they usually do, can be taught with firm, gentle, loving discipline. If <br/>
she is as sweet and good-natured as you say, then it shouldn&#39;t take much to <br/>
correct her. Good luck! I hope you get as sweet a dog as we did!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122700719">Hi Julie,<br/>
        I don&#39;t know if this will work for you, but it did for me.<br/>
Get the dog and cat together and praise and pet both of them. Tell them that <br/>
they are a good cat and good dog and that the other is good too. All the <br/>
while praising them and petting both of them.  Repeat this quite often util <br/>
they both know that they are not in competition. Even feeding them together <br/>
at the same time is good.  <br/>
           Give it a try and let me know :0)<br/>

<br/>
Our dogs and cats have always gotten along really well, and I think this sort <br/>
of stuff is what helped us too.  We just kind of asked and expected them to <br/>
be nice, and they eventually were.  Reassurances and reminders turned to them <br/>
all flopping out and sleeping together, and sharing food and water dishes <br/>
without fighting.<br/>
