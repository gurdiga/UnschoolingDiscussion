school?&nbsp; </font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We started hs&#39;ing because our oldest was advanced 
and we knew that he would be bored (read &quot;in trouble&quot;) in ps.&nbsp; We moved 
into the unschool mode gradually as I realized that teh kids were learning more 
when I wasn&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; them.&nbsp; We continue to unschool because it has 
become a part of our lives, sort of like eating!&nbsp; </font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">How many children do you 
have, how old, and names(if you wish)?&nbsp; </font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Three, Stephan, 12, Kyra, 10, and Joel, almost 
8.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s 
most recent interest(s)?&nbsp; </font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Stephan loves computers, cars and guns.&nbsp; He is 
designing a web page about his 4-H projects, and reads constantly.&nbsp; Kyra 
loves horses.&nbsp; She reads about horses, talks about horses, dreams about 
horses.&nbsp; Did I mention that she likes horses? :-)&nbsp; Joel loves to fix 
and build things.&nbsp; He spends a lot of time in the workshop hammering and 
nailing.&nbsp; He is allowed to use the electric sander and drill alone, but 
must have help to use the table saw.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh boy!&nbsp; Do we ever!&nbsp; Fish, birds, cats, 
dogs, chickens, ferrets, geese, ducks, iguanas, goats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, 
and sometimes pigs.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We are city transplants to the country and hope 
never to move back to the city!&nbsp; Also, I am learning Scots Gaelic and if 
(okay this is a long shot!) anyone else knows this language I would love to 
write back and forth!</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402905139"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Why do you un/home school?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cos there&#39;s too much pressure on the little&#39;uns in our school <br/>
system, and cos I don&#39;t think school&#39;s a good place for learning, <br/>
etc etc...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How many children do you have, how old, and names(if you wish)? <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heather who&#39;s 4&1/2 (and who my mum keeps calling &#39;old <br/>
fashioned&#39; like there&#39;s something wrong with that...) and Abi who&#39;s <br/>
3&1/2<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  they both like the &#39;puter and the TV, we read at bedtime, <br/>
would like to do more during the day, I don&#39;t feel like discussing <br/>
books when I&#39;m close to falling asleep myself.  They go to drama <br/>
class and gym, and love spending time with their gps, baking and <br/>
gardening (as if they couldn&#39;t do that here &lt;g&gt;)They do a lot of <br/>
pretending games, I love to listen from a different room while they&#39;re <br/>
playing together.  I ought to write them down.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; WHat area does your family live in?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yorkshire, England<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; DO you have any pets?   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>2 cats, Arnie and Tribble<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add<br/>
 </span></blockquote>er, well, not much.  <br/>
