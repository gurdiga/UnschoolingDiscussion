35.  How old are you Erin?  And what car do you drive?  Kimme</div>

&lt;&lt; I only feel like I have a lot of catching up to do as an adult<br/>
 because there are a lot of things I have an interest in that I wish I<br/>
 already knew (e.g. Latin & piano) - and that I could have learned back<br/>
 then if I&#39;d known how to be diligent. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
this is the case with many of us adults!  home/unschooled or not...  many <br/>
teens arent in a place to be diligent bc they are busy growing, sleeping, <br/>
eating, being.  if it had been forced upon you then, w/out your pro-activity, <br/>
you may have rejected it anyway...  <br/>
