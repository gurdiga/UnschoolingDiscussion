<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180487774">I&#39;ve got a great book on child-rearing and education here.  From what I<br/>
understand, it was a &#39;bestseller&#39; in it&#39;s day.<br/>
<br/>
The author:                   Jean Jacques Rousseau (yep, the same guy who<br/>
developed the idea of the Social Contract--a key concept in 18th century<br/>
revolutionary France.)<br/>
The publication date:    1762<br/>
The title:                        Emile<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m using the William Boyd translation from 1956).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ON THE ART OF LIVING:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is not enough merely to keep children alive.  They should be fitted to<br/>
take care of themselves when they grow up.  They should learn to bear the<br/>
blows of fortune; to meet either wealth or poverty, to live if need be in<br/>
the frosts of Iceland or on the sweltering rock of Malta.  The important<br/>
thing is not to ward off death, but to make sure they really live.  Life is<br/>
not just breathing: it is action, the functioning of organs, senses,<br/>
faculties, every part of us that gives the consciousness of existence.  The<br/>
man who gets the most out of life is not the one who has lived longest, but<br/>
the one who has felt life the most deeply.&quot;  pg. 15<br/>
<br/>
I would add: Life is not just stay in school, graduate, get a &quot;good&quot; job,<br/>
live the American dream, retire, yada, yada, yada.  It&#39;s much much deeper<br/>
than that.<br/>
<br/>
This sort of reminds me of the line from the movie &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;<br/>
which goes something like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t read and write poetry because its cute. We read and write poetry<br/>
because we are members of the human race. And the human race is full of<br/>
passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering: these are noble pursuits<br/>
necessary to sustain life but poetry, beauty, romance, love. These are what<br/>
we stay alive for.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ON THE DUTIES OF FATHERS:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A father has only done a third of his duty when he begets children and<br/>
makes provision for them.  To his species he owes men; to society he owes<br/>
social beings; to the state he owes citizens.  Every person who fails to pay<br/>
this triple debt is blameworthy, even more so if he only pays it in part.<br/>
The man who cannot fulfill a father&#39;s duties has no right to become a<br/>
father.  Neither poverty nor business nor concern for public opinion exempts<br/>
him from the obligation to look after his children and educate them<br/>
himself.&quot;  pg. 19<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ON HAPPINESS:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We can never know absolute good or evil.  Everything in this life is mixed.<br/>
We never experience pure sentiment, or remain in the same state for two<br/>
successive moments.  Weal and woe are common to us all, but in differing<br/>
measure.  The happiest man is the one who suffers least: the most miserable<br/>
the one who has least pleasure.  Always the sufferings outweigh the<br/>
enjoyments.  The felicity of man here below is therefore a negative state,<br/>
to be measured by the fewness of his ills.  Every feeling of pain is<br/>
inseparable from the desire to escape from it: every idea of pleasure<br/>
inseparable from the desire for its enjoyment.  Privation is implicit in<br/>
desire, and all privations are painful.  Consequently unhappiness consists<br/>
in the excess of desire over power.  A conscious being whose powers equalled<br/>
his desires would be absolutely happy.&quot;  pg. 34<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ON LEARNING TO READ:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Great stress is laid on finding better methods of teaching children to<br/>
read.  Reading cases and cards have been invented, and the child&#39;s room has<br/>
been turned into a printer&#39;s shop.  Locke suggested the use of dice.  Fancy<br/>
all this elaborate contrivance!  A surer way that nobody thinks of is to<br/>
create the desire to read.  Give the child this desire and have done with<br/>
the gadgets and any method will be good.&quot;  pg. 51-52.<br/>

Usually it&#39;s easier to be a success than to be a human.</div>
