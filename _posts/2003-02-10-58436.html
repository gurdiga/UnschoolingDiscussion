<br/>
&gt; If they don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; &quot;unschool&quot; as it is truly know, and find this list too far out there and not<br/>
&gt; for them, why do such people think of it as a bad thing to call what they do<br/>
&gt; eclectic or relaxed or unit study or school at home and find a board that<br/>
&gt; supports that if that is what they truly want to do?  Why do some want to<br/>
&gt; have the label &quot;unschooler?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is and has been for awhile the million dollar question. &lt;g&gt; I wish I<br/>
knew, too.<br/>
<br/>
My first guess is arrogant and egotistical (i.e, that they&#39;ve met or read of<br/>
unschooling families and want to be associated with the calm and kindness<br/>
and respect that seems inherent to them). It could be dead wrong.<br/>
<br/>
My second guess is that they think of unschooling as simply un-schooling (a<br/>
confusion perhaps not unreasonable) so when they say, &quot;We unschool<br/>
everything except math&quot; they simply mean they just &quot;don&#39;t do school&quot; for<br/>
everything except math, no more no less.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is and always has been an annoying term, and if John Holt were<br/>
alive today I&#39;d tell him so. &lt;g&gt; Unfortunately, it&#39;s part of the language of<br/>
homeschoolers now, so what to do?<br/>
<br/>
From time to time various unschoolers have toyed with finding a new way to<br/>
describe who we are and what we do, instead of using &quot;unschooling&quot; which<br/>
inadequately describes us as what we DON&#39;T. I like some of the terms, but<br/>
none of them have really grabbed me to the point of wanting to adopt them. I<br/>
wish one would.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is me, when I came here. I thought it was just a matter of not using<br/>
a curriculum, or having scheduled lessons. Unschooling, in my limited<br/>
book knowledge of it, was simply not schooling. I&#39;ve come to learn that<br/>
it is more of an all encompassing way of life. Unlike any kind of<br/>
*schooling*, which usually ends at a specific time, *unschooling* never<br/>
ends.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I like some of the  terms, but none of them have really grabbed me to<br/>

<br/>
In my opinion, the word *schooling* should be ditched altogether. It<br/>
carries too much baggage. How about:<br/>
life-learners<br/>
world-learners<br/>
child-led learning<br/>
liven&#39;learners<br/>
CLAP&#39;ers (Children Learning Alongside Parents)<br/>
LOBy (Learning Outside Box)<br/>
LIL learners (Lessons In Life)<br/>
Okay, I&#39;ve gone over the edge!lol<br/>

I was thinking more along the lines of happy children clapping. Oh well,<br/>
when you think about it though, don&#39;t others avoid unschoolers like the<br/>
clap! Okay, I&#39;ll stop now before I say any more incredibly stupid things.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  So many people see children as just children.  I totally agree with <br/>
the celebrating childhood part.  Non unschoolers also see what I do as <br/>
somehow forcing my boys to &quot;grow up&quot; to fast.  Like I am forcing them to make <br/>
their own choices.  They don&#39;t see understand I value and trust the choices <br/>
they make.  And that I feel that my boys, being children, have a different <br/>
perspective on things and have valuable contributions to make to my life.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t just me &quot;filling them up.&quot;  It is more of a 2 way street.<br/>
<br/>
Just some random thoughts.  Pretty random.  LOL did they make any sense.<br/>
