<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119327659"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;        1.  Where do you stand with TV?  If children chose, may they chose to<br/>
&gt; watch TV all day.  My 15 year old would never do anything else if I would let<br/>
&gt; her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes she would. (I know I&#39;m being presumptuous, but she really would eat,<br/>
sleep and go to the bathroom at least -- well, I *hope* she would go to the<br/>
bathroom &lt;g&gt;. Those alone would lead to other things. She might even speak<br/>
occasionally, such as, &quot;Mom, where&#39;s the TV Guide?!&quot; and &quot;Are we out of<br/>
Cheetos?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The first thing is that she really has to believe you are not going to<br/>
restrict her again. This might take some time. The second thing is that you<br/>
will have to really believe and act like whatever amount of TV she is<br/>
watching is just fine with you and you would not rather see her with a book<br/>
or a puzzle or a rocket science project.<br/>
<br/>
Some people, given no restrictions, watch more TV than others. My husband<br/>
watches more than I do. I watch more than my sister does. So there&#39;s that<br/>
factor.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the factor (and this is the biggest one, I think) that if<br/>
something is limited, it is more craved, and binged on, and that includes<br/>
TV. If you actually lifted the TV restriction I am willing to bet actual<br/>
money that MAYBE for one full week of her waking hours she would do little<br/>
but watch TV. Maybe. After that, she&#39;s going to want to wash her hair. Look<br/>
out a window. Go for a walk. Bake a cake. Read a book. Something. After a<br/>
month or two, she&#39;s going to be approaching her own &quot;natural&quot; TV rhythms.<br/>
That&#39;s assuming the following paragraph is true:<br/>
<br/>
And, last for now, if she has other choices of things to do (books, people,<br/>
places to go, organized activities if she&#39;s into those) she will turn from<br/>
the TV to do them (maybe not in the first week or much for the first month;<br/>
maybe not ever as often as you&#39;d prefer).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        2.  Cleaning there rooms.... Do you require that your kids keep their<br/>
&gt; room clean or just close the door.  I&#39;m afraid I would run out of dishes if I<br/>
&gt; did this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At my daughters&#39; age we clean their room for them and sometimes ask for<br/>
their help and sometimes they do some without being asked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about what I&#39;ll do &quot;when they&#39;re older&quot; because I do want to<br/>
respect their privacy (right now they don&#39;t care, I&#39;ve asked) but on the<br/>
other hand, I&#39;d prefer not to have things actually growing in there. &lt;g&gt; I<br/>
will not require them to clean their rooms. I will not poke my nose through<br/>
their stuff. I imagine what I might do if I need to is say, &quot;I&#39;m missing 17<br/>
plates, can you have a look in your room when you have a chance and bring<br/>
them if they&#39;re there?&quot; and, if I need to, &quot;My darling one, your room smells<br/>
like a pack of rabid hogs in heat, the odor is permeating my pores and last<br/>
week as I walked down the street garbage collectors crossed to the other<br/>
side to avoid me. Will you clean it or at least let me do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        3.  What about when their messiness intrude on others space.  I have a<br/>
&gt; child that always leave their clothes on the bathroom floor.  It drives<br/>
&gt; everyone else crazy to have to step over it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Put a hamper in the bathroom and the person who is driven crazy can toss<br/>
them in there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;        4  How do your husband on board.  And I also have my Mother moving in<br/>
&gt; and Father-in-law living with us (he has Alztimers and after my dad died Mom<br/>
&gt; got very lonely and is moving in with us.)  I know my Mom will have a really<br/>
&gt; hard time with my daughters messy room.  Do I let my daughter deal with her<br/>
&gt; grandma?  She told grandma she would do better when she gets moved in which<br/>
&gt; should be in the next few months.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Grandma would have to adapt here, I&#39;m afraid. Grandma would be permitted to<br/>
keep her room in any state of cleanliness (or lack thereof) she wished, and<br/>
would have to respect everyone else&#39;s right to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Husbands are trickier, because they do think they have some say in rearing<br/>
their children. ;) I send mine lots of posts from lists like this. &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s<br/>
really, really, really great. But he&#39;s not quite so far along as I am. If he<br/>
were unwilling to talk and listen, I don&#39;t know what I would do besides run<br/>
interference so his attitude affected the kids as little as possible. If he<br/>
were really awful, I think I&#39;d find him a good home.<br/>

Kirby gave me permission to go through his room last fall.  We put up new <br/>
shelves and I organized most (not all) of his stuff.  What I didn&#39;t touch is <br/>
the walk-in closet.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s closet and room really need a pass through.  Were I not gimped up, I <br/>
would ask him to do it with my help or to scoot so I could do it without his <br/>
help, but it will have to wait a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I think the next time I feel the huge urge to organize (in part, in both <br/>
cases, to find things which aren&#39;t theirs which are suspected of being lost <br/>
in their glaciers of stuff), I will say &quot;If there&#39;s anything in there you <br/>
don&#39;t want me to see, locate it and put it in a safe place elsewhere in the <br/>
house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Probably  neither of my guys would have anything secret.  But if they DID, I <br/>
bet they&#39;d end up cleaning out a fair amount of stuff just to get to their <br/>
sensitive possessions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198438605">Lately my son has spoken of his sadness, frustration and disappointment<br/>
that his friend always beats him (in their backyard games of football or<br/>
cricket).<br/>
<br/>
Being aware that we often don&#39;t want to be told how to &quot;fix&quot; our<br/>
problems, I&#39;ve tried to listen and empathise.  I have to admit that I<br/>
have also at different times suggested different ways to look at it,<br/>
offered reassurance that his own skills will improve over time and with<br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
I find it easier to empathise without advising when the disappointment<br/>
is related to football because he is not ambitious in that area - but he<br/>
has for years expressed ambitions to play international cricket, so I<br/>
worry about the effect of these experiences on his self-image.<br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s helpful, but my college swim coach told us that <br/>
everyone who has ever won has also lost, and probably many more times <br/>
than they won. He used to enter us into events that he knew we would <br/>
lose, just to keep us humble. I had grown up with a you-must-win <br/>
mentality from previous coaches, so I found his attitude very <br/>
refreshing. He was always pushing us to try new things, even if we <br/>
knew we wouldn&#39;t be &quot;good&quot; at them. He always emphasized that what <br/>
defined &quot;good&quot; lay in the enjoyment of the sport, not in the winning <br/>
or losing. He really lived this example too, since he still swam in <br/>
Master&#39;s swimming and had a lifelong love of many different sports. A <br/>
lot of people who were very into competitive sports at an early age <br/>
were completely burnt out by college, but he felt that he would be a <br/>
success if he could help us all to enjoy what we were doing as much <br/>
as wanting to win. I don&#39;t know exactly how to pass any of that on, <br/>
but I found it very inspiring at the time.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the best things I do for my kids is to let them see me <br/>
lose, and let them see that I still really enjoy myself. I remember <br/>
one of the first triathlons that my son watched me finish, he came <br/>
running up and asked me if I had won. When I said &quot;no&quot;, he looked <br/>
incredibly disappointed, so I explained that I might not ever win, <br/>
but that I did this sport because I loved it, and that was what was <br/>
important. So, in small ways or big, if there are ways that we show <br/>
our kids that winning isn&#39;t everything, I think that goes a long <br/>
ways. Maybe when playing cards or some non-sport activity, you could <br/>
discuss it in a context that isn&#39;t so personally threatening to him?<br/>
