had a blank one since then. And here I was being miffed at the computer for<br/>
being so enigmatic about wanting to be restarted. It should have just<br/>
crashed like it usually does ;-)<br/>

Are you using Outlook Express? Maybe there was some weird email that reset<br/>
something.<br/>

  Is anyone else experiencing email with the subject stripped off? Even couple<br/>
  I know I changed the subject of have shown up with no subject. I&#39;m wondering<br/>
  if it&#39;s my email program or service provider or if it&#39;s Yahoo that&#39;s doing<br/>
  this.<br/>
<br/>
  If it&#39;s just me and mine are going out without subjects, I apologize, but<br/>
  apparently it&#39;s out of my control!<br/>
