<br/>
Exactly how am I supposed to stop him?  If I were to try to control it, it<br/>
would simply damage our relationship and he would shoot up as soon as he was<br/>
out of my sight.<br/>
<br/>
If he wanted help, I wouldn&#39;t force hospitalization either.  I worked too<br/>
much rehab to waste my money trying to force someone to get clean the way I<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
There is a difference between telling someone you are concerned about them,<br/>
trying to find out what is bothering them, doing what you can to help....and<br/>
imposing your will on them.<br/>

Notice that I am addressing you by name because in THIS post I am actually<br/>
talking about you.  In my previous post which you copied and responded to, I<br/>
did not address you by name and was therefore not talking about you.  The<br/>
post to which you referred was a general post.  For future reference please<br/>
note that I am many things but not a coward who must hide personal attacks<br/>
in some kind of vague wording.  If I have a problem with something you said<br/>
and want to address it, I will address you in a very straightforward manner.<br/>
