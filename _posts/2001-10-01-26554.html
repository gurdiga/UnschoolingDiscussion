<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967876634">Don&#39;t think anyone has touched on this.<br/>
My 11 year old son is getting very hesitant to go anywhere without me.<br/>
Playing with friends is OK, no problem. he is gone for hours all over the<br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter who is 20,  takes him on occasion, and he sometimes starts<br/>
crying and wants to be taken back home.<br/>
He gets very sad, almost to the point of making himself sick.<br/>
And she was like a second mama to him when he was younger. Now, he wants<br/>
me to come with them.<br/>
<br/>
I am lucky, as she is the only one he feels good about going with. Not, that<br/>
their has been alot of offers by anyone else.<br/>
Help, do I push him to go more often? Anyone else go through this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113011518">YES :) I have an 8yo dd who will not let me go anywhere without her. I am <br/>
going with my grandmother on a &quot;gambling&quot; cruise thing, never been to one <br/>
and kinda excited on one hand because I will get to spend sometime with her <br/>
(my grandmother) and ive never done anything like this (gambling cruise). <br/>
Other hand, I know I&#39;ll miss them awful! Elly is my youngest and last :( I <br/>
am not able to have anymore I enjoy her clingyness ( is that a word? :)), <br/>
she is not happy about this at all. I have promised to take pictures and <br/>
bring back surprises though :)<br/>
All my kids will want to spend nights with my mom or thier aunt, but i <br/>
almost always get a call around 1 am to &quot;come get me please mom&quot; :)<br/>
I dont have any solutions, just wanted to say (type :)), that I can relate.<br/>
