forgets about everything else.  <br/>
<br/>
He forgets to eat.  When he is hungry and doesn&#39;t know it because he&#39;s<br/>
very focused on something else, he is very temperamental.  I have found<br/>
that taking him some food at regular intervals, sitting quietly beside<br/>
him,  and engaging him, will get him interested in eating ( snarf! )  and<br/>
then he&#39;s fine.  <br/>
<br/>
He plays all kinds of video games,  with no restrictions ever and has a<br/>
brilliant mind for puzzles, games, geometric shapes, blueprints,<br/>
schematics, ( good story here; When we moved into this house we had it<br/>
re-wired.  He looked at the electrition&#39;s plans for a few minutes and<br/>
said, &quot;I think you&#39;ve forgotten the door bell here, and the motion sensor<br/>
light on the north side.)  No kidding!  He was seven!    His fine motor<br/>
skills are exceptional as is his hand - eye coordination.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377518233">I&#39;ve been reading this thread and kept my mouth shut but there seems to be a<br/>
very big misconception.  One size does NOT fit all.  Yes, some parents don&#39;t<br/>
wait long enough to see if their children &quot;deschool,&quot; however, not all<br/>
activities have anything to do with deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If a child sits for hours and hours in front of the boob tube, video games<br/>
or other venues which can be (please, before folks jump on their high<br/>
horses, read what I wrote &quot;can&quot; be, not &quot;are&quot;) mindless unactivities, does<br/>
NOT mean they are deschooling nor does it mean they will stop doing this at<br/>
some point and move on to other activities.<br/>
<br/>
The fallacy of using a label such as &quot;deschooling&quot; is that some children who<br/>
have never been to school nor have they ever been in an environment that was<br/>
controlling will still sit like mindless little bloob in front of the tube.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone (an inclusive word including children) is an individual and the<br/>
important thing is to discover and encourage that individuality to the best<br/>
of the parents ability.  Sometimes parents must make choices for their<br/>
children because in that INDIVIDUAL child&#39;s case, they cannot or will not<br/>
make choices that are good for them.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest kidlet is one who does not stop.  She has no self regulating<br/>
&quot;button&quot; that tells her when she is tired and NEEDS sleep.  She goes on and<br/>
on and one until she literally makes herself sick, physically sick.  When<br/>
she was little she had a bedtime.  Now that she is older we have discussed<br/>
this and when she is beyond tired, I tell her to go look at what she calls<br/>
her &quot;saggy, baggy&quot; tired eyes and then she takes herself off to bed.<br/>
<br/>
The is no such thing as &quot;A&quot; definition of unschooling, nor is there any one,<br/>
single &quot;correct&quot; way of doing it.  Sometimes folks forget that the whole<br/>
idea of unschooling is to allow a child to be an individual AND that<br/>
sometimes, some adult help is needed.<br/>
<br/>
So, Tara, here is your encouragement and the pat on the back that needs to<br/>
be handed out more frequently.  All steps toward unschooling are good steps,<br/>
even baby steps and even when one sometimes takes one step backwards as long<br/>
as one&#39;s next steps are a vigorous forward!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just musing here, and this may not be a good idea at all.<br/>
How about tying his game playing to his behavior.  Any time his behavior <br/>
deteriorates right after playing video games, he doesn&#39;t play again for a <br/>
certain amount of time.  Or there&#39;s a limit on his playing time.  Then he <br/>
can try again.  I&#39;m thinking that maybe it will let him see for himself <br/>
what it does to *his* behavior.  And someone else mentioned food.  That&#39;s <br/>
also a very good idea.  &quot;You can keep playing as soon as you&#39;ve eaten some <br/>
food to get your blood sugar up.&quot;<br/>

Or is that when he&#39;s asked to stop?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I would also like to second Lori&#39;s statements. Those of us <br/>

concerns to gather the strength and support we could beneit from in <br/>
times of need.  Yes, we are going through the &quot;deschooling&quot; process <br/>
as well.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And?  Are people here not offering freely their own experiences, and ways <br/>
they tried that failed, and beliefs they had that have changed?  Part of the <br/>
deschooling process needs to be to REALLY look at what IS going on, rather <br/>
than looking at what you wish were going on.  <br/>
<br/>
If we all make soothing noises here, it will take longer than if we point out <br/>
potential problems.  I don&#39;t think soothing &quot;support&quot; of every idea no matter <br/>
what direction it&#39;s headed is what busy new unschoolers need.  I think they <br/>
need REAL advice, and real help.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, you could eventually figure it out on your own, but if you really wanted <br/>
to do that you might not have come here to read.   And lots of schooly stuff <br/>
has to be undone, so the more that&#39;s avoided in the first place, the sooner <br/>
children think in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But there are days we are doubting, questioning, and sometimes having a <br/>
private <br/>
MELTDOWN!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So have all of us, and we&#39;re trying to help others get through the doubts <br/>
sooner and easier.<br/>

You cannot tell by looking at someone what they are thinking, and they ARE <br/>
thinking.  They&#39;re either thinking of what they&#39;re looking at and hearing, or <br/>
they&#39;re thinking of something else and using &quot;I&#39;m watching a show&quot; as a <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know any &quot;mindless little bloobs.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those who have children who are mindless little bloobs should have <br/>
their own list, because I don&#39;t like the phrase or the lack of respect behind <br/>
it, and I think it&#39;s a strawman created for the purposes of this discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448196778">If one of MY sons sat all day in front of a &#39;boob tube&#39; then, yes, I&#39;d <br/>
be very worried - even if it was the 18yo! I&#39;m sure any other aging <br/>
Kiwis or Aussies on the list will understand my feelings.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a child sits for hours and hours in front of the boob tube, video games<br/>

&gt; this at<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right! That&#39;s what I&#39;d be scared of! Stopping looking and moving on to <br/>
other activities! Arrrrgh!<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Cause my understanding of &#39;boob tube&#39; is a very tight fitting ribbed <br/>
sleeveless t-shirt that starts just above the boobs (breasts) and <br/>
finishes just below them!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to introduce a note of frivolity but I just cracked up!<br/>
<br/>
I do get fed up with my lot watching too much tv, playing too much <br/>
playstation and computer games, but they come up for air eventually. I <br/>
have 4 sons aged 11, 14, 18, 20, so I&#39;ve seen it come and go for years. <br/>

&gt; Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Deschooling-video games<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;          I HAVE let my son play video games for hours in hopes that<br/>
&gt; &gt; he would tire of them.  He did not.  His temperament became<br/>
&gt; &gt; unbearable and I firmly believe that video games have a negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; impact on the brain. Some studies have been done to show that video<br/>
&gt; &gt; games affect humans self-control capability.  I don&#39;t know if this<br/>
&gt; &gt; can be said of all cases but I can attest to its effects on my son.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He becomes aggresive and loses his temper easily after spending long<br/>
&gt; &gt; amounts of time playing video games.  These are not violent games but<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are &quot;action&quot; games.  He does fine with games like Sim City or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pokemon (gameboy version). By the way, I have played numerous<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nintendo and Playstation games with him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;         As in all cases, some recommendations will work with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; children but not with others.  I will NEVER again allow my son to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; immersed in the &quot;gaming&quot; world.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;         I would also like to second Lori&#39;s statements. Those of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; new to unschooling would like to have somewhere to turn with our<br/>
&gt; &gt; concerns to gather the strength and support we could beneit from in<br/>
&gt; &gt; times of need.  Yes, we are going through the &quot;deschooling&quot; process<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well. It is hard to erase 15+ years of repeated brainwashing. Yes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we are devouring books on unschooling, reading websites,and talking<br/>
&gt; &gt; with like-minds (when available). No, we may not have all the support<br/>
&gt; &gt; we would like from family or even spouses. WE ARE TRYING! We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; DOING! We are learning all the time... right along with our children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are loving, we are biting our tongues, we are enjoying. But there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are days we are doubting, questioning, and sometimes having a private<br/>
&gt; &gt; MELTDOWN!!  Those quiet hours when the kids are in bed and you<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder....<br/>
&gt; &gt;        I would LOVE to always have the faith in myself,in the natural<br/>
&gt; &gt; progression of life, but sometimes I falter. Everyday, I get<br/>
&gt; &gt; stronger. Please be there not to judge but to show the way when<br/>
&gt; &gt; others faith may be lost. Sometimes a simple word such as &quot;patience&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; can speak volumes and may be just what is needed.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; You cannot tell by looking at someone what they are thinking, and they ARE<br/>

&gt; they&#39;re thinking of something else and using &quot;I&#39;m watching a show&quot; as a<br/>

&gt; patterns.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you site a source for this? I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did find<br/>
(over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind: Subliminal<br/>
Programming&quot;:  by Dick Sutphen:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while<br/>
&gt; viewers were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain<br/>
&gt; activity by a ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were<br/>
&gt; in an altered state . . . in trance more often than not. They were<br/>
&gt; getting their Beta-endorphin &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland<br/>
&gt; of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young<br/>
&gt; viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off<br/>
&gt; whenever the children&#39;s brains produced a majority of alpha waves.<br/>
&gt; Although the children were told to concentrate, only a few could<br/>
&gt; keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is<br/>
associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific skills<br/>
and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical and artistic<br/>
awareness, space and pattern perception, insight, imagination, generating<br/>
mental images to compare spatial relationships. (No connection is made<br/>
between right brained activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>
<br/>
From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a right<br/>
brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently wrong with right<br/>
brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing and imagining and being<br/>
insightful. <br/>
<br/>
The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all normal<br/>
individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes closed. These<br/>
waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves generally appear when the<br/>
nervous system is active, that is, during periods of sensory input and<br/>
mental activity. (Not that it says generally.)<br/>
<br/>
(Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep sleep<br/>
but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>
<br/>
Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and by<br/>
relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism<br/>
(thinking, calculating). It is the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed<br/>
adults - it is present during most of life especially beyond the thirteenth<br/>
year when it dominates the resting tracing. (Alpha waves are also present<br/>
during meditation and hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant rhythm<br/>
in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>
<br/>
That would suggest people aren¹t thinking when they watch TV. But does that<br/>
make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I¹ve learned from<br/>
watching TV. How can learning take place without thinking? There is also<br/>
research into Controlling Computers With Neural Signals (in Scientific<br/>
American at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)">http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)</a> which uses Alpha<br/>
and Mu waves. If alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those<br/>
waves be used to perform a computer action if we have to stop thinking in<br/>
order to generate them?<br/>
<br/>
What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudoscience. They<br/>
are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that doesn¹t mean<br/>
alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but that doesn¹t mean<br/>
that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta means lack of thinking)<br/>
-- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>
<br/>
To get a more complete picture we¹d need to know what the waves look like<br/>
when we¹re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or playing a<br/>
video game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or gazing down at a<br/>
sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would indicate anything. It would<br/>
just be more data on how the brain operates.) If alpha waves increased<br/>
during those times, should we stop those things? Or does it merely mean that<br/>
³thinking stops alpha waves² and ³beta is present during mental activity²<br/>
are too simplistic and don¹t adequately describe what¹s going on?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197644472">OOooo . . .I would love to have seen Wyndham&#39;s results on that about six<br/>
months ago.  I bet he would have looked dead &#39;cuz that&#39;s how he looked<br/>
from the outside.  Mindless bloob about describes it perfectly.  When we<br/>
dragged him away he was this bright intelligent child after a while, when<br/>
he was watch all TV all the time he barely communicated at all.  In fact<br/>
you could walk in the room and talk to him and he would not even know it,<br/>
it was like he just went completely away.<br/>
<br/>
I have no regrets about my actions in limiting his TV and nothing anyone<br/>
here says is going to change that.  Some may say things like, &quot;you only<br/>
see what you want to be true.&quot;  But perhaps it kinda, sorta is the other<br/>
way &#39;round.  Perhaps they think that everyone should do exactly what they<br/>
did and what worked for them precisely because they have never met one<br/>
like mine.  And I give them the benefit of the doubt and listen (except<br/>
to the condescending stuff) but find that usually, it comes down to<br/>
trusting that I see the situation more clearly here living in it than<br/>
they do, especially considering that they have no contact with 5 of the<br/>
people involved, only contact with me.<br/>
<br/>
So once again, my advice is to trust your instincts.  But step back and<br/>
look at the situation to be sure.  I have two that were fine with<br/>
unlimited TV and one that is definitely not fine.  It actually took my a<br/>
long time (probably longer than it should have) to step in and stop it<br/>
because I believed so much in them taking responsibility for themselves<br/>
(after all it had worked with the first two).<br/>

PS Lynda, I suspect that obsession with things electronic is a genetic<br/>
predisposition - he gets it from me.  Through the years I have had to<br/>
take conscious control of Tetris, Poppit, Carnival, Galaga, TV and the<br/>
Internet.  It took me a LONG time to recognize it in myself.  Now, if<br/>
something starts interfering with my life, I recognize it faster because<br/>
I saw it in my son.  The worst was when I was obsessed with a stand alone<br/>
arcade game because I had to be wherever the machine was a LOT!<br/>

<br/>
Not all right brain activity is non-thinking, just because it&#39;s non-verbal.<br/>
<br/>
I can play piano without thinking IF I&#39;m familiar with the piece.  (I don&#39;t <br/>
play by ear with both hands, only from music, so I&#39;m talking about reading <br/>
music.)  If I don&#39;t know the piece, I&#39;m thinking in words and note names and <br/>
conscious awareness of things like &quot;triplets&quot; or &quot;repeats&quot; or &quot;thirds&quot; but <br/>
once I&#39;m familiar with the structure of the piece and what it&#39;s supposed to <br/>
sound like, I play it straight from eyes to fingers without any brain-noise <br/>
about words.  It&#39;s then that it sounds like music to me and I can play it <br/>
with expression.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like I&#39;m still thinking, but thinking in a different language.<br/>
<br/>
And when I have a piece in that state (not perfectly played, but reading it <br/>
that visual and non-verbal way, kind of like when you can read a passage <br/>
without having to sound out any words, just b glancing and going straight to <br/>
meaning), I can carry on a conversation with someone and still play.<br/>
<br/>
And about the study you saw, Joyce, having wired all those subjects up and <br/>
shown them a video (I presume they used the same program for all tests, or it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be worth much scientifically), did they show them something soothing <br/>
and with pattern art and peaceful music?  Or Jaws?  Or something with <br/>
sub-titles?  (That would be interesting to track--like teens watching anime <br/>
in Japanese with sub-titles, which Kirby does LOTS at his anime club <br/>
meetings.)   I&#39;d like for them to show Holly a musical when she knows the <br/>
music but hasn&#39;t seen the staging and costumes and dancing.  That would not <br/>
be hypnotic.  They might be tempted to give her a sedative to keep her wired <br/>
up in the chair and not up pointing &quot;LOOK!&quot; or singing and dancing, or <br/>
calling for the remote to rewind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033325474">&quot;How we choose to describe someone shapes our attitude towards them.&quot;<br/>
Joyce <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for these ideas Joyce. You reminded me of an observation my sister made last week. It may seem totally unrelated to many of you but I think it&#39;s part of this discussion. She remarked that it looked like my bust had shrunk :~) In fact I&#39;m the same size as I&#39;ve been for most of my life but she has always perceived me differently.We&#39;re in our 40&#39;s and we see each other several times a week, and spend the summers together at our family cottage, so it&#39;s not as if she forgot, it is simply the way she perceives me. It&#39;s especially interesting as it pertains to a physical attribute, rather than a perception of  personality or behavior, which is what I&#39;d tend to consider to be the more subjective. <br/>
<br/>
Our propensity to believe that we&#39;re rational thinkers, leads us to imagine that what we see and believe is the truth, rather than a perceived reality, based on our personal assumptions. We search for and surround ourselves with people, research and ideas, that support us rather than challenge us because of the comfort we naturally seek. It&#39;s not about right or wrong it&#39;s more about trying to make meaning and find comfort that stands in the way of really free thinking. We tend to gravitate toward what we conceive of as concrete and we&#39;re weary of abstract ideas which are harder to communicate and are more often misunderstood. Being a parent and feeling responsible for the outcome of another&#39;s life is a frightening endeavor however inconsequential our role may in fact be. <br/>
<br/>
Standing by and watching our children &quot;waste&quot; their time with activity that we perceive/know will lead to negative outcomes is as difficult with grown children/people as it is with young ones who we have &quot;control&quot; over. The difference is that an older child/person might, at some point, insist on their autonomy being respected and will spend their time with those they perceive as respecting them. The little ones feel shame and anger but it takes them sometime to learn what to do with it.  They are totally dependent on our benevolence and they know it. I&#39;ve see the fear in my children&#39;s eyes more times than I&#39;d like to admit. They don&#39;t know what a parents love feels like, they truly fear that my feelings could change and I might reject them. I nursed them all until they were 4 or 5, they sleep with us in our family bed until they decide they want more privacy, we remind them that their home is with us and for as long as we&#39;re alive we&#39;ll share all that we have, and still, I see that fear in their innocent faces when I push them or show them my disapproval. <br/>
<br/>
If your worried about TV and Video games offer them an alternative activity that they will agree to. Take them to the park or for a bike ride, play a game together, involve them in the cooking or the house work etc... I&#39;ve always found that when the kids are young they&#39;d rather do something with me than anything else. That changes with teens and once they&#39;re sexual you can say good bye to the good times for a while! I&#39;m too old to get on this roller coaster again and I fear that their heartbreaks and mistakes are harder for me to endure than my own were.<br/>

  &gt; &quot;LIKE&quot; was the operative word.   &quot;LIKE mindless little bloobs&quot; is a<br/>
  &gt; descriptive phrase used to describe how they may look as they sit there.  It<br/>
  &gt; does not say anything whatsoever about the child&#39;s ability to think.  Please<br/>
  &gt; try to read what I wrote, not what you have decided I am writing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; And, actually a study was done that shows that some children, a limited<br/>
  &gt; number, do not think while &quot;zoning&quot; in front of the boob tube.  Some<br/>
  &gt; children actually go into an almost sleep/dream state, a sort of<br/>
  &gt; self-hypnosis inwhich they brain waves patterns indicate no active thought<br/>
  &gt; patterns.<br/>
<br/>
  Can you site a source for this? I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did find<br/>
  (over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind: Subliminal<br/>
  Programming&quot;:  by Dick Sutphen:<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while<br/>
  &gt; viewers were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left-brain<br/>
  &gt; activity by a ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the viewers were<br/>
  &gt; in an altered state . . . in trance more often than not. They were<br/>
  &gt; getting their Beta-endorphin &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland<br/>
  &gt; of the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young<br/>
  &gt; viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off<br/>
  &gt; whenever the children&#39;s brains produced a majority of alpha waves.<br/>
  &gt; Although the children were told to concentrate, only a few could<br/>
  &gt; keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!<br/>
<br/>
  Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is<br/>
  associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific skills<br/>
  and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical and artistic<br/>
  awareness, space and pattern perception, insight, imagination, generating<br/>
  mental images to compare spatial relationships. (No connection is made<br/>
  between right brained activities and being in a trance like state.)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a right<br/>
  brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently wrong with right<br/>
  brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing and imagining and being<br/>
  insightful. <br/>
<br/>
  The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all normal<br/>
  individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes closed. These<br/>
  waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves generally appear when the<br/>
  nervous system is active, that is, during periods of sensory input and<br/>
  mental activity. (Not that it says generally.)<br/>
<br/>
  (Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep sleep<br/>
  but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>
<br/>
  Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and by<br/>
  relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any mechanism<br/>
  (thinking, calculating). It is the major rhythm seen in normal relaxed<br/>
  adults - it is present during most of life especially beyond the thirteenth<br/>
  year when it dominates the resting tracing. (Alpha waves are also present<br/>
  during meditation and hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant rhythm<br/>
  in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>
<br/>
  That would suggest people aren¹t thinking when they watch TV. But does that<br/>
  make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I¹ve learned from<br/>
  watching TV. How can learning take place without thinking? There is also<br/>
  research into Controlling Computers With Neural Signals (in Scientific<br/>
  American at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)">http://www.sciam.com/1096issue/1096lusted.html)</a> which uses Alpha<br/>
  and Mu waves. If alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those<br/>
  waves be used to perform a computer action if we have to stop thinking in<br/>
  order to generate them?<br/>
<br/>
  What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudoscience. They<br/>
  are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that doesn¹t mean<br/>
  alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but that doesn¹t mean<br/>
  that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta means lack of thinking)<br/>
  -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>
<br/>
  To get a more complete picture we¹d need to know what the waves look like<br/>
  when we¹re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or playing a<br/>
  video game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or gazing down at a<br/>
  sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would indicate anything. It would<br/>
  just be more data on how the brain operates.) If alpha waves increased<br/>
  during those times, should we stop those things? Or does it merely mean that<br/>
  ³thinking stops alpha waves² and ³beta is present during mental activity²<br/>
  are too simplistic and don¹t adequately describe what¹s going on?<br/>

This happens to my mother every time I talk about unschooling.<br/>
Deb L<br/>
<br/>
My mother, like most in our society, can finally cope with the idea of &quot;homeschooling&quot;! I wouldn&#39;t dare shake her up any more just yet :~D It&#39;s taken her 12 years to get to where she is now.<br/>

our house and we make alot of noise.  So when there is a show on that <br/>
I really want to watch.  I have to really pay attention to hear and <br/>
understand the show.  Tommy (hubby) always pokes fun at me cause I <br/>
don&#39;t hear anything around me.  He&#39;ll come in the room and talk to <br/>
me...but I&#39;m in my own little world TRYING to watch my show ..hehehe<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t limit the t.v.  I limit the shows that the children watch.  I <br/>
don&#39;t like them watching rugrats or cartoons all day (since we have <br/>
seen all the shows a million times anyway).  Some shows are <br/>
great...the children learn ALOT from them.  Some people learn more in <br/>
this way, than in reading.  BUt everyone is different!!<br/>

that one! I am struggling, usually without support from or against views of <br/>
family and friends, with LOTS of stuff in my life, unschooling is only one of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
As parents we all come into this arena of life from varying backgrounds. <br/>
Usually, we&#39;re doing the best we can with what we&#39;ve got. Not spanking may <br/>
come quite naturally to one mother while it is a huge leap in changing <br/>
philosophy to another. Support and  compassion make more changes that cold <br/>
truth and judgement.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also learned that making mistakes is a very important necessary, part of <br/>
learning.  <br/>
<br/>
And as far as the specifics, tv, workbooks, bedtimes, etc. I think that love, <br/>
openness and willing to change are more important than doing everything <br/>
&#39;right&#39;. Some of us may not be &#39;pure&#39; unschoolers, but we&#39;re a far cry closer <br/>
than we were when we started. <br/>
<br/>
And, yes Lynda, big pats on the back for all of us!!<br/>
