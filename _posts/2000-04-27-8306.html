<br/>
A dentist can make a special splint that is worn in the mouth at night.<br/>
The splint forces the jaw (painlessly) into the proper position. <br/>
Eventually the muscles of the jaw are conditioned too and help with<br/>
realignment.<br/>
<br/>
A &quot;professional&quot; could explain this more precisely.<br/>
