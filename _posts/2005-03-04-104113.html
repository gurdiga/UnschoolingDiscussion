<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067439848">It has  taken years of conditioning to get my parents and MIL to this <br/>
point of  leaving us alone...their training began the day my MIL fed my <br/>
exclusivly  breast-fed, top of the chart 4 month old &quot;cereal&quot; when we <br/>
left him (along  with bottles of breast milk) with her for 4 hours while <br/>
we went to dh&#39;s  class reunion....she never tried to usurp our position <br/>

=============================<br/>
 <br/>
When I read things like that, I have sympathy for the  <br/>
babysitter/in-law/parent.<br/>
 <br/>
I think feeding a four month old cereal was very bad, but as to &quot;usurping  <br/>
the position of parents,&quot; I think it&#39;s better to talk to the kids about dealing  <br/>
with the relatives than to command the relatives to behave as we would.<br/>
 <br/>
If I ever babysit a grandkid and a parent uses his position to try to make  <br/>
me spank or punish or put a child to bed in a dark room because the clock says  <br/>
8:00, I will absolutely refuse to do it, even if they&#39;re paying me cash by <br/>
the  hour.<br/>
 <br/>
If I babysit other people&#39;s kids and they tell me how their child is to be  <br/>
treated to the minutest detail, they can take their kids on away with them,  <br/>
because what they&#39;re really doing is leaving a child at MY house, where children <br/>
 have survived and are happy.  I would want a WHOLE lot of money per hour,  <br/>
and to be in someone else&#39;s house to do the work, to follow someone else&#39;s <br/>
rules  to the letter.  A lot of money.  Not less than $50 an hour to go  against <br/>
my beliefs.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well a 4 month old can&#39;t really deal with a memaw who&#39;s spooning food<br/>
into his mounth instead of that bottle he&#39;d rather have.<br/>
Of course this all had to do with the discussion about dyslexia and<br/>
ds&#39;s choice of using the word as a way to &quot;deal&quot; with relatives. <br/>
We are lot better now about not throwing ds into situations he would<br/>
not be able to deal with and with helping him workout how he will deal<br/>
with things that come up.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Usurping&quot; is probably not the best word and my &quot;tounge-in-cheek&quot; tone<br/>
(which was in my head when I wrote that) did not come across to well.<br/>
I can sound harsh at times.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel so bad for folks when I read how relatives constantly<br/>
grill them on their lives and how they are raising/educating their<br/>
kids. Some parents and in-laws can be very contolling. It seems to be<br/>
a constant theme for homeschoolers and unschoolers alike. We do not<br/>
have that problem, from a woman who can be quite controlling with her<br/>
other sons wives, and I think it all stems back to that 1st incident.<br/>
Its strange, she and I have a better relationship (what little there<br/>
is) then she has with any of the other DILs.<br/>
The truth is ds did not suffer any ill effects from the food and in<br/>
hindsight there were other choices I could have made, from not being<br/>
so uberpro-breastfeeding (to the point of being obnoxious at<br/>
times...new mom/1st baby syndrome and all that) to not going to the<br/>
reunion since I knew what my MIL was like.<br/>
<br/>
Usurping is a harsh word and when I read it, it does sound like a<br/>
parent who feels their kid is a posession and I will make your life<br/>
misrable if you do not follow all of our instructins. I guess respect<br/>
for the choices we are making would work, but the truth is would be<br/>
hard pressed to respect the wishes of a DIL that wanted me to spank my<br/>
grandkids too. Or force them to do &quot;school work&quot; at my house.....I&#39;d<br/>
hate having to force anyones kid to do homework after being in school<br/>
all day.<br/>
I&#39;m with you, if you have a whole list of things your kid can do at my<br/>
house, I&#39;d just rather them not come.<br/>
<br/>
But where do you draw the line as an unschooling parent? What is<br/>
non-negotiable? If its not usurping<br/>
(hmmmm...presuming/preempting/appropriating/supplanting) to do things<br/>
like feeding a vegitarian child meat, forcing an unschooling child to<br/>
&quot;do&quot; schoolish stuff, or spanking a non-spanked kid (all in the<br/>
context of younger/complacent/fearful kids who would not/could not<br/>
fight back but go along)then what is it? <br/>
Besides just being plain rude.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941162824">This reminds me of an incident that my SIL had when my MIL babysat for her daughter.  My MIL spanked her daughter for repeatedly jumping on MIL airbed (like the Sleep Number bed) even when asked to please stop etc. There have also been dog incidents were my niece was particularly mean to the animals. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, my SIL freaked out - which has saved the rest of us from this potentially happening at our house. <br/>
<br/>
But I do think it stems from the fact that my MIL was not doing any different than she did with her kids and feels that all  they &quot;turned out fine&quot;. I don&#39;t think there was malice intended - but she was reacting in the same way she had reacted to her kids. My SIL was particularly sensitive because her own father had been abusive and so there is no spanking on her end.<br/>
<br/>
I had a time with my MIL when she thought I babied Chase too much because he never would just be put in his crib and go to sleep. He always wanted to be rocked and nursed and if he didn&#39;t fall asleep nursing - he didn&#39;t sleep. She believed in the &quot;cry it out theory&quot;. So we have often been at odds - but I will say that she recognizes that I just do things differently. I can tell by some comments that she makes that she thinks I am too permissive, not organized(scheduled), etc.  She has babysat a few times when I have worked a week-long intensive University course and has everyone regimented. Naps scheduled, shoes must always be worn outside, laundry is all done and folded - chores are regimented. My husband thinks its great - he grew up this way. I think its insane. I can see the benefits of some of her ideas - but I am just not that way. I don&#39;t like to wear shoes outside in summer - I don&#39;t mind if they splash in puddles - and I am really unstructured. She really thinks this is detrimental, that kids need to learn discipline etc. <br/>
<br/>
I do wish my husband would relax a bit more - and not feel as if life needs to be run like an army camp. After 12 years of marrige I think its growing on him - and seeing how happy anf free our kids are.... His view has been changing - but slowly.<br/>

~~~<br/>
It&#39;s a good question.  I&#39;m going to be a grandmother and my grandson&#39;s  <br/>
mother will get her teaching degree before his birth.  <br/>
 <br/>
We bump heads on a lot of things.  I try really hard not to bump into  hers <br/>
if I can help it.  I stopped sending her the cool articles I run  across on <br/>
this list about co-sleeping, etc.  (An issue she has taken a  stand against.)  <br/>
She is capable of changing--she recently decided to stay  home with the baby <br/>
until the spring semester of school, instead of spending all  summer looking for <br/>
a teaching job for the fall and then giving birth just as  classes are about <br/>
to start!  <br/>
 <br/>
I expect I will get to keep the baby for a weekend here or there.  I&#39;m  the <br/>
only one of his grandmothers who doesn&#39;t work.  It will be convenient  for them <br/>
and they love to travel, so I&#39;m certain it will come up.  (I do  suspect Jake <br/>
will be more likely to want the baby with him all the time, since  he won&#39;t <br/>
get to know the baby until he gets back from Iraq, so my supposing  could all <br/>
change.)  I can&#39;t give it breastmilk unless she&#39;s pumping, and  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
she&#39;ll be nursing (although I did send her Dr. Spears&#39; book).   I&#39;ve been saving <br/>
Will&#39;s crib for the grandbabies, but I&#39;ve already decided this  baby is <br/>
sleeping with me, if I get to have it overnight.  So much better  for the baby.<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;ll think I&#39;m spoiling it.  She will think the baby will not want  to go <br/>
to sleep in its own bed when it gets home.  I&#39;m just not going to  care that <br/>
much what she thinks of it, and I&#39;ll probably not tell her unless it  comes up.  <br/>
Oh, not that I&#39;ll lie or anything.  I will give her every  reason to trust <br/>
me, while minimizing conflict.  I&#39;ll be walking that subtle  balance between <br/>
preserving relationship/influence and losing both.  So much  more ticklish with <br/>
daughters-in-law, it seems.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Karen,<br/>
I am facing a similar situation.  My little sister is pregnant with her <br/>
first baby and will be a single mom.  I will be caring for the baby <br/>
while she works.  She seems receptive to AP and plans to breastfeed, but <br/>
she has not read anything I have given her nor has she taken much of my <br/>
advice about pregnancy diet, etc.  I too am walking the line.  It seems <br/>
so much harder when the child in question is a family member--a beloved <br/>
niece or nephew or grandchild.  It&#39;s giving me some perspective on what <br/>
it must be like for my family when they see me doing things that are <br/>
&quot;wierd&quot; with my kids.  Co-sleeping was a big one for my mom--she was <br/>
genuinely afraid I would smother the baby.  Oh, and homebirth was <br/>
another big one.  And right now my little sis is living with my mom so <br/>
there is a lot of what I consider negative influence for me to try to <br/>
counter without damaging my relationship with my mom or my sister.  It&#39;s <br/>
all very tricky.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, some of the best advice I got about this was from my <br/>
mother.  When my first was little, I was really worried about letting <br/>
him spend any time at all with my MIL because she is a very negative and <br/>
judgmental person and I was afraid she would hurt his feelings or that <br/>
it would &quot;rub off&quot; on him.  My mom advised me that ds and MIL will need <br/>
to work out their own relationship and I can not control it.  As long as <br/>
he still wants to pursue the relationship with her, which he does, who <br/>
am I to step in and tell them how to interact?  Of course I do draw the <br/>
line at spanking and punishments, but really I don&#39;t have to because ds <br/>
would simply choose not to visit her if she did that.  She knows it too, <br/>
and she knows I wouldn&#39;t make him go.  And when he was a baby he was <br/>
never alone with her so I didn&#39;t have feeding issues or anything.  So <br/>
for right now this is working.  Perhaps as you grandparent your little <br/>
one you can discuss this idea with your DIL--that you and your <br/>
grandchild will have a different relationship than they will have with <br/>
each other, but that&#39;s OK.  Am I making any sense?<br/>

&gt; preserving relationship/influence and losing both.  So much  more <br/>
&gt; ticklish with<br/>
&gt; daughters-in-law, it seems. <br/>

Perhaps  as you grandparent your little <br/>
one you can discuss this idea with your  DIL--that you and your <br/>
grandchild will have a different relationship than  they will have with <br/>
each other, but that&#39;s OK.  Am I making any  sense?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, of course you are!  <br/>
 <br/>
I keep thinking as the time grows near that the biological changes will  <br/>
happen and that will ease the transition for all three of us.  I almost  feel like <br/>
*I* am going through biological changes...well, I am what with the  gray hair <br/>
and what-not.  But I also feel like the very thoughts I have  about this <br/>
grandchild are changing me.  And of course, thoughts are  the genesis of every <br/>
action.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am so grateful my kids have relationships with their grandparents!   I hope <br/>
Mandy can be grateful for me some day.  :)<br/>

Hey  Karen - David Elkind has a book about grandparenting<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!  I was thinking of writing one.  Not that I&#39;d ever get it  finished.  <br/>
But I was also thinking of looking some up.<br/>
 <br/>
From this side of the road, the best grandparenting book still has to be  <br/>
Living Joyfully with Children.<br/>
