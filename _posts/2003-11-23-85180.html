&gt;just slapped the tar out of me, put her hands to her mouth and ran out of<br/>
&gt;the room crying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was stunned.  She later apologized and so did I.  I always, from the<br/>
&gt;moment it happened, felt that my behavior played a major part in that<br/>
&gt;incident.  I had a good mom, a very loving mom that I provoked past her<br/>
&gt;ability to cope.  I was abusive to her and she couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  I<br/>
&gt;never felt that she abused me.....she protected herself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember a similar incident from when I was around the same age. Yes, I <br/>
*did* provoke my mild-mannered father into spanking me. No, it wasn&#39;t the <br/>
best solution, and he realized it almost right away. (My parents rarely <br/>
spanked. In fact that&#39;s the only one I remember.)<br/>

When I was a late teen my mom and I had a fight where I started storming up <br/>
the stairs screaming horrible things to her, when she threw a rather large <br/>
coffee table book that she was holding at me. I looked down at her horrified, and <br/>
both of us cracked up, then apologized. I don&#39;t think we ever had another <br/>
out-of-control fight like that again.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about that is, that while we were both out of control and furious, <br/>
it wasn&#39;t a big adult using the power of size and authority over another. And <br/>
my mom didn&#39;t consciously throw that book -- pure reflex.<br/>
<br/>
I am not advocating that we start hitting or throwing things at our teenager <br/>
-- just that some of these examples are different.  As Shannon knew, because <br/>
she didn&#39;;t WANT to hit her little boy, and asked for help. <br/>
<br/>
Brian, you asked about what if your kid does something totally socially <br/>
unacceptable. Lots of people here have met my son Julian, who, at 14 is a charming <br/>
and very sweet boy. He&#39;s never  been a difficult kid, and has never been <br/>
spanked.<br/>
<br/>
One time when he was pretty young and very, very angry he did something <br/>
truly, horribly, awfully socially unacceptable. (I won&#39;t go into the details, <br/>
because he wouldn&#39;t want me to. Just trust me. It was BAD!)  He wasn&#39;t spanked. He <br/>
wasn&#39;t even yelled at. The enormity of our disappointment and upset with him <br/>
was enough for him to really get it. And nothing like that ever happened again.<br/>
<br/>
I work with parents a lot, and I can tell you that the less likely a parent <br/>
is to spank or otherwise physically or emotionally punish a child, the less <br/>
likely that child is to behave badly. I have seen that punishing and spanking <br/>
make kids angry and scared and out of control.<br/>
