share for helping us with the program and all?<br/>

&gt; Another thing they are into is Roblox. I read about it on here and the boys<br/>
&gt; love it but were getting kind of frustrated last night cause they couldnt<br/>
&gt; figure something out. J didnt want to give B a turn till he did. I didnt<br/>
&gt; know either and cant do things like that without time to concentrate. Funny<br/>
&gt; thing is I get much more frustrated than they do. My husband just takes over<br/>
&gt; so we dare not ask him! Anyway, they finally tired and went to bed so I sat<br/>
&gt; up for several hours last night playing the game and figuring things out.<br/>
&gt; Now I am armed with a few answers anyway... Although not as many as you<br/>
&gt; might think after playing that long.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the insights.<br/>
