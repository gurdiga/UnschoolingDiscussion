any of the shows that irritate me so because he would watch science stuff<br/>
instead.  BUT I don&#39;t necessarily think one is all good and the other all<br/>
evil.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159526508">You know, I think I see a fundamental problem with this discussion that I<br/>
didn&#39;t see until now.  When I or someone else says, &quot;I need to do<br/>
something because TV seems to be having very destructive effects on my<br/>
child.&quot;  Many of you answer as if we said, &quot;TV watching is bad for<br/>
children.&quot;  (The quote I included with my post is what caused the thought<br/>
to gel - I saw the words &quot;our children&quot; and realized that some of you<br/>
discuss these things as if there is a sameness to our children.)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t come to the conclusion that I need to limit my son&#39;s TV because<br/>
I read studies about Alpha Waves - I haven&#39;t looked at them.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
make decisions based on a book by a child psychologist (or several books)<br/>
- I don&#39;t read them.  I didn&#39;t make the decision based on what I think<br/>
other parents around me were doing - peer pressure never was an issue for<br/>
me.   I saw a problem in my family, analyzed it, discovered it stemmed<br/>
from obsessive TV watching and I did something about it.  I don&#39;t believe<br/>
Pokemon is evil, I don&#39;t think you should have to limit YOUR child<br/>
because of an effect on mine.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think though, that I may have something to offer to another mom who<br/>
says, &quot;My son gets violent when he watches TV all day.&quot;  And my advice is<br/>
not going to be turn it off entirely.  It may help others to know they<br/>
are not alone.  I can offer anecdotal evidence of how I handled it with a<br/>
caution that her experience may vary.  I can offer my support in whatever<br/>
she decides about the issue.  But, what I won&#39;t do, is criticize her<br/>
thought that maybe the TV is bad for her son - because only she is there.<br/>
 Only she really sees if there is a cause and effect.  It would be<br/>
arrogant of any of us to assume she is less able to judge the situation<br/>
than we are.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Standing by and watching our children &quot;waste&quot; their time with <br/>
&gt; activity that we perceive/know will lead to negative outcomes is as <br/>
&gt; difficult with grown children/people as it is with young ones who we <br/>
&gt; have &quot;control&quot; over. The difference is that an older child/person <br/>
&gt; might, at some point, insist on their autonomy being respected and <br/>
&gt; will spend their time with those they perceive as respecting them. <br/>
&gt; The little ones feel shame and anger but it takes them sometime to <br/>
&gt; learn what to do with it.  They are totally dependent on our <br/>
&gt; benevolence and they know it. I&#39;ve see the fear in my children&#39;s <br/>
&gt; eyes more times than I&#39;d like to admit. They don&#39;t know what a <br/>
&gt; parents love feels like, they truly fear that my feelings could <br/>
&gt; change and I might reject them. I nursed them all until they were 4 <br/>
&gt; or 5, they sleep with us in our family bed until they decide they <br/>
&gt; want more privacy, we remind them that their home is with us and for <br/>
&gt; as long as we&#39;re alive we&#39;ll share all that we have, and still, I <br/>
&gt; see that fear in their innocent faces when I push them or show them <br/>
&gt; my disapproval. <br/>
