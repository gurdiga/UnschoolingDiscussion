<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336175101">I&#39;m trying to get rid of the virus... I hadn&#39;t rebooted, so I don&#39;t think I emailed it to anyone, but my antivirus software was outdated and wouldn&#39;t remove it.. and the symantec directions for manual removal didn&#39;t work completely.  I still have one infected file left and am getting ready to try to remove it from MS-DOS because I can&#39;t delete it from Windows.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43653021">I was &quot;out there&quot; yesterday (but I&#39;m new here so no one noticed *tears*) in between taking the guys to the zoo.  What a mad house.  There were 3 or 4 preK and K groups there being dragged around by their chaparones. What a switch, they were dragging their kids and I was being dragged by mine.<br/>
<br/>
I do not have a computer, only an e-mail unit, so I&#39;m not able to open attachments.  But I learned a lot about viruses yesterday.  I&#39;m asking myself again - do I really want one, a computer that is, not the illness.  You folks sound like you had a real mess on your hands.<br/>

It&#39;s better for the computer than turning it on and off all the time.  I <br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">LOL!! I never said you were ignorant girl! Or anyone else 
for that matter....Actually it does work for me because with most internet web 
based programs out there today, in order for people to access it 24/7, they have 
to keep their computers up all the time don&#39;t they? They do have maintenance in 
the off hours as well...usually from 3-5 am...some do it more often than others. 
BBS&#39;s are not as common anymore but there are still a few die hards out there. 
The Internet has really grown in the last few years by leaps and bounds and even 
I am still amazed by all thats out there. Its mind boggling....sometimes I do a 
random search on something, and boy....it sorta explodes the mind on how many 
web sites come up....but it is also fun to explore. My daughter doesn&#39;t get on 
it much....she&#39;s more the active type at this time. Maybe later she will as her 
interest grows and as she grows older. Even though my computer is on 24/7, I do 
have a weekly maintenace set up with Norton Utilites program. It does it every

sorry about that &lt;G&gt; ... that IS how I FEEL sometimes w/ all this <br/>
internet talk/gobbledygook, just flies right over my head (don&#39;t <br/>
forget, Pris is OLD) :)<br/>
<br/>
k, now I get it, makes perfect sense, I mean about the internet <br/>
service being available 24/7 (duh on me) ... so???  does this explain <br/>
why my computer seems to *BURP* (for the lack of a better word) <br/>
usually c. midnight ~&gt; b/c the internet co is doing their <br/>
maintenance???  the screen goes BLANK then blue screen then <br/>
NOTHING ... this USUALLY happens when I&#39;m right in the middle of an <br/>
impt e-m to my 7 mth old grandbaby, Kinsey (YES, Gramby e-mails AND <br/>
calls her long distance, too!!! &lt;VBG&gt;) ... well, grrrrrrrrrr, that <br/>
just might explain it, ya think???   I&#39;ll have to get the &#39;Norton&#39; <br/>
program, currently we have McAfee/something???  <br/>
<br/>
oh, be careful while doing those internet searches ... last year I <br/>
had a RUDE awakening when I did a search for *TOYS* ... <br/>
<br/>
Pris in TX (dss 12/10) ~&gt; who&#39;s TRYING to get used to her new <br/>

Depends on the computer.  I have such a dinky amount of RAM that I have<br/>
to reboot often because my computer starts to bog down.  Someone on one<br/>
of my lists also said that turning off your monitor saves a lot of<br/>
electricity, so when I leave my puter on I just shut off the monitor.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes, we leave ours on all the time (unless there&#39;s a thunderstorm).  <br/>
It&#39;s better for the computer than turning it on and off all the time.  I <br/>
learned this from my friend who manages the computer lab at our <br/>
local university. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard okay on Macs, not okay on PCs.  (Probably there are other factors.)<br/>
<br/>
We leave the Mac on.<br/>
We turn the PC off every night.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just superstition. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-915394105">That *sounds* right, but I find that mine stops working as well after <br/>
it&#39;s been on for too long... by the end of 8-12 hours, it just isn&#39;t <br/>
able to work all the programs correctly, gets weird little glitches, <br/>
freezes up etc.  If I turn it off, even for a few minutes, it seems a <br/>
lot better when I reboot.  Why would that be the case?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663726748">The head of networking at the city I use to work at said that pc&#39;s should<br/>
only be on as long as you are using them.  PCs run &quot;hot&quot; and Macs don&#39;t,<br/>
whatever that means.  At anyrate, he said that they &quot;live&quot; longer if you<br/>
turn them off.<br/>
<br/>
Now, being cyber and computer challenged, I followed his advise, I mean,<br/>
after all he got paid the big bucks.  Seems to have worked cause we still<br/>
have some dating back to before the cavemen and they are all alive and well<br/>
&lt;g&gt; Old HP touch-screens, even a VIC-20 (which is great for letting kidlets<br/>

your tv screen with an American flag and the national anthem).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866402784">Hi,<br/>
I am out here but I haven&#39;t conquered the bug yet.  Of course I am fairly <br/>
computer illiterate and dh the computer geek is out of town for awhile longer <br/>
yet.  We have two computers so I can go on the other one and go to my isp and <br/>
read my mail there, but it is a pain in the butt.  My computer with the virus <br/>
crashed after I loaded and ran McAffee on it.  Dh had just re-loaded my <br/>
computer before he left because it had been acting funny, but he hadnt re-<br/>
loaded the anti-virus software as he didn&#39;t have time. He has been out of town <br/>
a lot lately.   It detected 4 corrupt files with the virus but didn&#39;t offer to <br/>
clean them and then it died and keeps rebooting itself and dying over and over <br/>
again.  So, I am reading little and posting little and looking forward to dh&#39;s <br/>
return so I can have my e-mail back.  I really miss it!  <br/>
