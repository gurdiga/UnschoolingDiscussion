<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804630597">Hi there<br/>
<br/>
Here, in New Zealand, we have a female Primeminister...I think, the first<br/>
female Primeminister Elect.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be her aim to get as many mothers working as possible.  For<br/>
instance, if I were to put my 3 year old in to daycare, I could get 50<br/>
free hours per week.<br/>
<br/>
Since I want to keep her close, I get nothing whatsoever.  I cheekily<br/>
asked if they would pay for her swimming lessons (at $10 a week, not the<br/>
@$150 they would pay if she were in daycare), but alas...the money is only<br/>
available if you send the child away from her family.<br/>
