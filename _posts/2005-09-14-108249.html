he should have opted for Rich Kream early on - still can take on some <br/>
euphemisms and innuendo overtones but not as blatant perhaps (might <br/>
sound more like a dessert).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331933945">i am too. :)  this reminds me of the HUGE fit my MIL threw when she <br/>
found out we were planning on naming our baby boy sebastian.  she <br/>
actually made up a list of what she considered more suitable/acceptable <br/>
names while at a party with her friends and handed it to me as if it <br/>
were doing us some favor!  after swallowing my initial reaction of <br/>
wanting to punch her for being so rude, i decided to ask her what she <br/>
thought was so bad about the name.  she replied, *all the kids will call <br/>
him bastard!!*  HUH?!  all this coming from a woman who named HER boys <br/>
noel and seth. *shrug*<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  my parents thought i was immune to name-calling too with such a <br/>
sweet common name, but no...i was called *lisa pizza, old lady with a <br/>
cane* whatever that means!  made me cry every time just because they <br/>
said it ugly-like. :(  oh...and my last name rhymed with pecker anyways! <br/>
;)  seems school kids will find a way to make fun of a kid no matter <br/>
what if they&#39;re going to!<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;btw...what *is* a normal grandma? ;)  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you really want a normal grandma for your kids? I envy my son and <br/>
dil when I think of all the crap I had to put up with from my parents <br/>
and inlaws over all kinds of things. I&#39;m not a normal grandma. Nor is my <br/>
grandchildren&#39;s other grandma normal. We have both homebirthed, home <br/>
educated (she didn&#39;t unschool - more &#39;eclectic&#39;), use homeopathy and <br/>
other alternative therapies etc. I remember once when dil was pregnant <br/>
with her 1st baby, someone was quizzing her about her intention to have <br/>
a home birth, and then turned to me and asked, &quot;So how do you feel about <br/>
it? Aren&#39;t you concerned for your grandchild&#39;s safety?&quot; with a very <br/>
obvious expectation that I was going to say something negative. Her face <br/>
changed to horror when I responded that, no, I wasn&#39;t but I would be if <br/>
she had it in hospital, and that i had had two home births myself and <br/>
that dil&#39;s mother had had 3, so neither of us were likely to criticise. <br/>
You could hear her thinking that our whole family was insane, and she <br/>
moved away quickly ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess what I&#39;m saying is - a &#39;not-normal&#39; grandma can be a good thing!<br/>

I&#39;ve got! It&#39;s hard when you still feel 18, and get a shock when passing <br/>
a mirror to see this old woman looking back! How did that HAPPEN??!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m home alone (out in the country) tonight and I&#39;ve just spent 2 hours, <br/>
lights out, dancing in the moonlight, in my bra on a very early spring <br/>
night, to very loud Jimi Hendrix and Rolling Stones music - now I&#39;m worn <br/>
out, and figured it was time to get properly dressed before dh and the <br/>
teenager boys arrive home. Okay, so do we change the definition of a <br/>
normal granny, or shall I just enjoy being abnormal? I have a feeling <br/>
that &#39;normal grannies&#39; don&#39;t do this stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really sad for all of you. One difference, perhaps, is that it <br/>
is something my sibs and I grew up with - my mom&#39;s stroke hit when she <br/>
was 28 - I was just over 5, my brother was around 3 and my sister was <br/>
about 3 months old. The fact she survived with minimal long term <br/>
damage to anything is amazing (my dad recognized the symptoms and hied <br/>
right to the hospital ASAP). That she lived long enough to see her <br/>
kids grow up, much less her grandkids, is a source of gratitude and <br/>
delight because there were times throughout our childhood and young <br/>
adulthood when she could have rolled over in bed and collapsed and <br/>
died.<br/>
