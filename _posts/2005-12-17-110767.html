<div id="ygrps-yiv-308725147">Hi folks... In addition to being an unschooling mom and sometime Conference  <br/>
Diva, I am a Director of Religious Education at a Unitarian Universalist <br/>
church.  I am planning a program for church, and wanted to talk about Charles <br/>
Follen, who  was a Unitarian minister and is credited with (at least publicly) <br/>
bringing the  tradition of Christmas trees to the US. You can find this story <br/>
here: _The Follens and the  Christmas Tree | Follen Church Society_ <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://follen.org/?q=FollenChristmasTreeHistory)">http://follen.org/?q=FollenChristmasTreeHistory)</a>  <br/>
 <br/>
In looking for information, I found this tidbit:<br/>
 <br/>
By 1834 Follen, who was coming up for the equivalent of tenure at Harvard,  <br/>
was a confirmed and uncompromising abolitionist. &quot;But radical abolitionism did  <br/>
not sit well with most Northerners, even with the Boston Unitarian  <br/>
establishment, whose members were offended by what they regarded as its vulgar  style <br/>
as well as its constant insistence that abolition be total and  immediate.&quot; <br/>
Harvard did not renew Follen&#39;s contract in 1835. Fortunately, his admirers  <br/>
found him a salaried position directing the education of two children whose <br/>
rich  merchant father had died in Boston. <br/>
Unfortunately, Follen proved to be a radical in education too. He believed  <br/>
that education, instead of drilling lessons by rote, should draw out the  <br/>
character and energies already present in a child&#39;s young soul. These  progressive <br/>
ideas, Nissenbaum relates, represented &quot;the kind of approach that  struck many <br/>
people (including many Unitarians) as leading inevitably to an  <br/>
indiscriminate parental indulgence of children in their immature desires and  whims.&quot; <br/>
As his detractors apparently maneuvered against him, the abolitionist  <br/>
educator and staunch Unitarian stuck to his principles - and lost his job only  <br/>
weeks before Christmas of 1835. <br/>
&quot;Through these trying hours, as always,&quot; writes Nissenbaum, &quot;Follen  <br/>
maintained his characteristically calm, patient demeanor, but he did not retreat  a <br/>
single inch. He was a man of extraordinary principle and tenacity.&quot; <br/>
