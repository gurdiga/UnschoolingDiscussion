In all fairness to your teacher, crayons back then contained high levels of <br/>
lead.  I commend your teacher for freaking out on you.  I wish more teachers <br/>
had and had a better knowledge of the dangers lead to children.  Millions of <br/>
children were poisoned when you were a child and no one was aggresively <br/>
protecting them from this insidious poison.  Unfortunately, if you were <br/>
coloring your lips with the crayon, you probably did get a good dose of lead <br/>
in you at that time :o(<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to artistry and creativity... but it can be crushed by the damage lead <br/>
causes to the brain, not just ranting educators who insist you color in the <br/>
lines and be like everyone else :o)<br/>
