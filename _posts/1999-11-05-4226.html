<div id="ygrps-yiv-12021685">A friend of mine asked me if I&#39;d post a question for her:<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a single parent and works about three full days a week.  Her son, 13, <br/>
stays home by himself.  Although they consider themselves unschoolers, she <br/>
leaves him a list of things to do (&quot;school&quot;work and housework) and he&#39;s fine <br/>
with that.  Inevitably, though, he spends hours and hours on the computer.  <br/>
She&#39;s worried about the situation and wants to know if there are other single <br/>
mothers out there with computer-obsessed sons and how they handle the <br/>
situation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a 13 year old son who does sometimes spend a lot of time on the <br/>
computer - usually when he is trying out a new game or working on <br/>
programming.  He seems to be good at achieving a balance.  He&#39;ll <br/>
decide that he&#39;s getting frustrated because he&#39;s been on too long and <br/>
will switch to another activity.  I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re striving <br/>
for - trying to achieve that healthy balance.  I guess my question <br/>
would be - what is he doing when he&#39;s on the computer?  Is he <br/>
on the internet?  We have an agreement that my son will let me know <br/>
when he&#39;s online and we frequently review safety measures for the <br/>
internet.  Also,  what role is the computer playing.  Does he stay on <br/>
for hours because he really enjoys it,  or is he avoiding doing other <br/>
things, escaping, etc.  I think these are the same questions we would <br/>
ask ourselves if caught up intensely in an activity.  I would talk to <br/>
him about balance, etc.  If he&#39;s not a long time unschooler,  this <br/>
might be the way he&#39;s deschooling.  Just some thoughts.....<br/>
