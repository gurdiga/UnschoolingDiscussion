 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing here that you&#39;re asking about the different kinds of vegetarians <br/>
but I&#39;m not sure. If that is it, then there are a few basic types of <br/>
vegetarians: lacto-ovo vegetarians eat dairy products and eggs along with <br/>
vegetarian foods, lacto vegetarians would use dairy products but no eggs, ovo <br/>
vegetarian would use eggs but no dairy. Complete vegetarians eat no animal <br/>
products at all. To really be considered a vegan, from what I&#39;m reading, you <br/>
need to take it a step further and as much as possible rid yourself of animal <br/>
products in everything (meaning no leather, no wool, no honey...plus there <br/>
are hidden animal ingredients in many many foods). It&#39;s basically impossible <br/>
to be 100% vegan since if you drive a car your tires contain animal products, <br/>
if you go to the movies, the film contains gelatin, and so on. Vegans try to <br/>
minimize the exploitation of animals as much as they possibly can, realizing <br/>
that it&#39;s not a perfect world. I still have my leather shoes and occasionally <br/>
use honey so I guess I&#39;m not a true vegan but I&#39;m getting there :)<br/>
<br/>
If that wasn&#39;t what you were asking, I&#39;m sorry. I just couldn&#39;t tell exactly <br/>
what you meant by vegan terminology. I&#39;ll be glad to try again if you ask!<br/>
