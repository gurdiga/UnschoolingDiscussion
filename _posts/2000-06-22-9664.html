muster that she&#39;ll somehow take what I&#39;m saying to heart and actually <br/>
BE more careful than she would be otherwise. It is not remotely just a <br/>
sort of blessing, when I say it to her, it is maybe more like trying to <br/>
cast a spell, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791492694">I always tell my dh to drive careful, wear seatbelt, take a walk, take a breathe, relax ect and he tells me all the time that when I do that he feels so loved. It&#39;s nice to know people really legitamitely (sp:) care about you. I have also been trying extra hard to be kind to all the members of my house when they are sick. This is something that was NEVER done for me and so it is not something that would come naturally to me. Gosh, what a difference a simple tea and a little babying does for somebody:) Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385366150">I happen to be in the middle of transcribing a journal from when I was<br/>
18 and first in recovery.  In one of my entries I mentioned that my dad<br/>
told me two whole times to be careful as I was leaving to go to a<br/>
meeting as it had been raining.  I wrote that never, since I was 16 and<br/>
first started driving, driving in rain and fog so thick you couldn&#39;t see<br/>
your house from the driveway every night taking my boyfriend home, never<br/>
had he told me to careful.  It made a huge impact!  I remember the<br/>
feeling very well - like he actually cared.<br/>

Me too.. and all of that stuff that Sandra also said..   I have never<br/>
taken <br/>
&quot;be careful&quot; as an insult or as insincere.    I know when I tell my<br/>
someone I <br/>
love  to &quot;be careful&quot; when they go out, go to work, go to school or<br/>
leave to <br/>
engage in otherwise &quot;dangerous&quot; activiites. I  just want them to know<br/>
that I <br/>

comforting <br/>
reminder to me too when someone who loves me urges me to be careful.<br/>
It means <br/>
they want me to come back :-)<br/>

got into middle school (and my sister in about 4th grade) she got a job during <br/>
our school hours, so we didn&#39;t get it as much when we got older cause mom was <br/>
at work.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids love being babied when they&#39;re sick.  I love babying them (and my <br/>
husband) too!  It&#39;s one of those times you REALLY feel needed :o)<br/>
