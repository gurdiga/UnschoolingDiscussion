<div id="ygrps-yiv-568447549">We have been homeschooling for a year (officially but actually her whole life LOL).  My Daughter is almost 8 and very bored.  We have been doing workbooks and she reads A LOT but only likes Babysitter Club books mostly.  She is an EXCELLENT reader.<br/>

So, she doesn&#39;t know many Geography, History, etc facts.  How does she learn these if she has no interest? Or the multipication tables?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227126923">OK.  Well, first of all, and as a former high school geography teacher, <br/>
let me suggest to you that if she has no interest in geography and <br/>
history facts then why bother with it.? Now, I see in the rest of your <br/>
post that you mention THE STATE and testing.  I&#39;m not sure how to deal <br/>
with that.  We live here in Texas where testing is not required.  We are <br/>
very free here.  The only thing I can think of is just tell your child <br/>
that THE STATE requires her to know certain things, etc.  I would make <br/>
it very clear to her that it&#39;s not that important to you.  You just want <br/>
her to learn what is interesting and important to her.  But, because THE <br/>
STATE requires this, and this, and that, she must learn it otherwise she <br/>
will have to go back to school.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that with many states you have to fall below the 40% mark <br/>
for several years in a row before the state will force you to put your <br/>
child in school.  I would go the unschooling route for as long as you <br/>
can until perhaps the last year when you explain to her the consequences <br/>
and allow her to make her choice.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are only 7 years old and we live in Texas where the <br/>
homeschooling laws are very lenient, so I can only tell you what I would <br/>
do.  I really don&#39;t have any experience with your situation.  What state <br/>
do you live in, by the way?  And what are the specific requirements of <br/>
homeschoolers that the state dictates?  Maybe someone else on this list <br/>
can help you further.  I wish you luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478965549">Hi Melissa,<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the site below and I see that your state is not a very good <br/>
one to unschool your children.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/ME.asp">http://www.hslda.org/laws/analysis/ME.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
I copied what they require as far as standardized tests are concerned.  <br/>
Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Standardized Tests: Parents complying with the home school rules (under <br/>
option 1 above) have several options. An annual assessment must be filed <br/>
with the State Department of Education which must consist of one of the <br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
1.	annual standardized test or,<br/>
2.	a local test or,<br/>
3.	review of progress by a Maine certified teacher or a local advisory <br/>
board selected by the superintendent or a home school support group that <br/>
includes a Maine certified teacher. Rules Sec. 3(J).<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I&#39;m not sure if it is possible to unschool in a state like <br/>
Maine.  They require annual testing.  Can you find out how many years in <br/>
a row your child can fail the test before she&#39;s required to go back to <br/>
school?  I think the longer a child has the opportunity to unschool, the <br/>
better.  The older s/he is, the better s/he will be able to put up with <br/>
the bull the state requires without much harm to her psyche.  That&#39;s my <br/>
personal opinion.  I honestly don&#39;t know how else to advise you.<br/>
<br/>
If you have not read John Holt&#39;s &#39;Learning All the Time&quot;, please do so.  <br/>
It is an excellent introduction to unschooling.  Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Punished <br/>
by Rewards&quot; is also an excellent book.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246629266">Hi Melissa,<br/>
I&#39;m in NC but we also have a testing requirement. I the past when I worried that low test scores would *matter* (they don&#39;t here), I used practice books such as Scoring High or Gruber&#39;s (found at Borders or B&N). For about 3 weeks prior to the testing date, we&#39;d review some of each chapter and when we&#39;d come across something totally unfamiliar, I&#39;d show her just enough to get by. For example, when they started asking multiplication questions, I explained that multiplication is just lots of addition. She caught on and it didn&#39;t become a problem for dd#1.  DD#2, however, doesn&#39;t have an inkling about multiplication and when she gets to that section of the test, I tell her to do whatever she likes (*knowing* now that in NC, the test results do not matter). <br/>
Sometimes, the practice tests have sparked an interest in something I hadn&#39;t exposed them to before. Other times, it&#39;s just a necessary evil that I explained as a state-mandatory thing we had to do if we want to continue to homeschool. <br/>
Another thing about NC is that you don&#39;t have to order the grade-appropriate test. For instance, dd#2 who is 10 and would be considered a 5th grader in the system, takes the 2nd grade test. I&#39;m at liberty to order the test I feel is appropriate for her ability. Maybe that&#39;s also the case in Maine.<br/>

&gt; law such<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425115472">Curiosity got me and I checked that link you provided, Mimi.  I think unschooling is do-able ... just read the rules carefully. This one is the toughest imo:<br/>
  1.. assistance by a satisfactory support system (either a certified teacher, approved private school, approved home school that has operated for one year, or a local home school support group approved by the Commissioner) at least 4 times each year; <br/>
I&#39;d join a local support group if it was me. The rest of the law, though, is very easy to do. We have to keep an attendance record in NC and it&#39;s such @@..... you just grab a day-planner, mark every single day as a learning day and jot down a summary of what you all did during the day. If you&#39;re ever called on it, you&#39;ve got enough notes to translate it into educationeze and please those in govt.  After awhile, you begin to think in those terms when you do something so that a simple trip to the park can be translated into: history (historical markers were in the park :-), geography, math, spelling..... you get the idea.... you can incorporate just about anything into an &#39;educational experience&#39;.<br/>

Families are able to unschool in PA and NY - both states considered to<br/>
be the most difficult in the nation.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577121273">Well, I&#39;d gotten antsy with ds (10 yr) doing nothing but Pokemon Gameboy and<br/>
Motocross Madness for the last 2-3 weeks. So the other day I asked him to<br/>
humor me and read something, anything, for 30 minutes. A little while later,<br/>
he calls to me from the other room: &quot;Mom, what&#39;s S-E-M-E-N?&quot; After I picked<br/>
myself up, I walked in and nonchalantly asked what he was reading. Any<br/>
guesses?<br/>
<br/>
The Bible. Leviticus. Jewish cleanliness laws. So I told him what it was,<br/>
and he cheerfully went back to the computer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537441176">Yeah, I hear what you&#39;re saying. Does the 1 yr old like a sling? Stroller? Parks are free and not crowded. Sometimes the zoo isn&#39;t crowded and if you get a membership it&#39;s pretty cheap to go often.<br/>
<br/>
Go over to unschooling.com&#39;s message boards and they&#39;ll help with that overwhelmed &quot;stuck in the box&quot; feeling.<br/>

Meanwhile, sometimes it helps to write down the &quot;schooly&quot; components of what they&#39;re already doing like &quot;reading 1.5 hours&quot; &quot;math--fractions&quot; (made cookies together), &quot;art&quot; (cut out the cookies), etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610745660">Hi Melissa!  I have 3 children.  My oldest is an 8 year old daughter <br/>
and my two youngest are boys, ages 4 and 2.  I have only recently <br/>
made the switch from extremely relaxed homeschooling to total <br/>
unschooling and I am absolutely loving it!  I don&#39;t think that you <br/>
have to be very creative to unschool.  You just go with the flow.  I <br/>
can give you an idea of how my day went today.  Maybe that would help <br/>
you a little bit.  All of my children love to go to the library&#39;s <br/>
story hour program.  We&#39;re blessed with a very friendly library who <br/>
was willing to change their idea of a preschool story hour into a <br/>
story hour for children of all ages because of all the homeschooled <br/>
kids who show up!  My kids like to go places together as a family <br/>
rather than segregate into age groups, so the story hour situation is <br/>
perfect for us.  Anyway, we slept in later than we should have so we <br/>
were rushing around frantically, dd rushing to get the pets cared for <br/>
this am and us barely grabbing a piece of toast before we went out <br/>
the door.  My 8 and 2 year old went today.  My 4 yo has always gone <br/>
with us but since his dad was home from work today, he wanted to stay <br/>
home with him.  Since it is an unusually warm Dec. here in PA, they <br/>
went outside in the yard and played baseball and played on the <br/>
swingset! (phys ed) Dd had a pleasant surprise today because her 2 <br/>
best friends showed up for story hour today.  After reading 3 <br/>
stories, the librarian handed out 3 Christmas coloring pictures. <br/>
(language arts and art) They colored their pictures and talked, <br/>
accompanied each other to the bathroom, and walked around the library <br/>
talking and giggling like girls like to do.  Dd wanted to borrow <br/>
Magic School Bus videos, but since they can only be borrowed for 2 <br/>
days I told her no  because I wouldn&#39;t be going back into town in the <br/>
next two days.  After the library, we went to the grocery store to <br/>
hand in coloring pictures.  The last time we were there they handed <br/>
the kids coloring sheets and said that if they brought them back to <br/>
the store colored, they would get free iced tea.  Well, they told us <br/>
that we can&#39;t hand them in until Saturday, when they are having <br/>
children&#39;s day--face painting, Santa, etc.  Dd pointed out that if we <br/>
come back to the grocery store on Saturday we&#39;ll already be in town <br/>
and then we could return the Magic School Bus videos.  So, we went <br/>
back to the library and picked up the videos.  We got home, had a <br/>
quick lunch of leftover mashed potatoes, and then I got on the <br/>
computer to do some Christmas shopping while the kids watched their <br/>
magic school bus vids and played. (Science)When I was finished <br/>
shopping, I sat down with dd and read some Christmas books she had <br/>
picked out from the library.  One of the stories was about two <br/>
children who had moved from Colorado with lots of snow to California <br/>
with no snow and they were afraid santa wouldn&#39;t be able to go there <br/>
because his sled needed snow. (Note:  Geography!)  Then the boys and <br/>
I made a batch of Christmas cookies together.  We heated up leftovers <br/>
for supper.  After supper, as I was straightening up the living room <br/>
and came across an I Spy book that ds had wanted to do with me.  I <br/>
called him in and asked him if he would like to do it.  He said yes <br/>
and we did it for awhile, until we came to a page with a big dominoes <br/>
set up where dominoes fall and knock a train down some track, which <br/>
knocks a ball off a shelf which falls on a clothespin which opens and <br/>
lets a piece of string out which knocks something else over...that <br/>
kind of thing.  Ds was fascinated with it and we decided to try to <br/>
build something like that ourselves.  Dd joined in and did her own <br/>
contraption while ds and I worked on one. (science--physics) Pretty <br/>
soon, ds was working pretty much independently and I was just sitting <br/>
there keeping him company.  The 2 year old wanted in on the action, <br/>
though and kept messing up his brother&#39;s work so I took the two year <br/>
old in the other room and played with the duplos with him.  Well, <br/>
before long the 4 year old made his way in with us and started <br/>
building duplos with us. (math) The 4 yo took over the building I had <br/>
started so I sat there sorting the legos from the duplos and putting <br/>
some cheap imitation legos that no one plays with in a seperate bag <br/>
to sell at a yard sale.  At 8:00, dh and I watched survivor in one <br/>
room while the kids watched the Charlie Brown Christmas special in <br/>
another.  After survivor, the boys and I played with the playmobil <br/>
nativity set for awhile and then the 4 year old and I read 10 <br/>
terrible dinosaurs (math) and a magic school bus book (science).  The <br/>
2 year old listened in here and there but doesn&#39;t sit very long for <br/>
stories yet.  Then I sent everyone up to brush teeth and get ready <br/>
for bed, but dd thought she saw a snake under her radiator.  I <br/>
cleared everything off the radiator cover (hair stuff and jewelry), <br/>
pulled it out, and got the &quot;snake&quot; (a pony tail holder that had <br/>
fallen underneath the radiator).  She ended up staying up late <br/>
because as long as it was pulled cleared off, I dusted it off and had <br/>
her organize all her stuff which had gotten extremely messy.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope my sample day was a help to you and that I didn&#39;t bore <br/>
you with all that!  <br/>
<br/>
Some stuff my dd likes that maybe yours would too:<br/>
Has your eight year old ever read the American Girl stuff?  They&#39;re <br/>
great and if she really gets into it, there&#39;s a neat board game that <br/>
she might like. Dear America books are great too, although they tend <br/>
to throw in a few mature themes into them so I always make sure I <br/>
read them with dd the first time through.  We got a kit through <br/>
scholastic that has a craft with supplies that you make after you <br/>
read the book. Dd loves that.  She also likes the Pony Pals and <br/>
Boxcare children.  We got a Little Women audio tape from the library <br/>
which dd absolutely loves.  We listen to it in the car.  We&#39;re <br/>
Christians, so some of the books we like to read are Christian too.  <br/>
Dd likes the Ruby Slippers School series, the Mandie series, and we <br/>
recently bought an Elsie Dinsmore book that looks interesting.   Does <br/>
she like to play board games? Dd loves yatzee, name that country, <br/>
sorry, Guess who, checkers, and Monopoly.   Does she play with <br/>
computer software?  Dd&#39;s favorites are the Cluefinders 3rd and 4th <br/>
grade adventures and the Music Doodle Pad. She really wants Carmen <br/>
Sandiego for Christmas (which she&#39;s getting) Ds likes Ready for Math <br/>
and Ready to Read with Winnie the Pooh.  She is also excited about <br/>
sewing some bedding for her doll bunk beds that her dad made for her <br/>
and she also wants me to help her sew doll clothes for her American <br/>
girl dolls this winter.  That is going to be interesting since I&#39;m <br/>
not much of a seamstress, but I&#39;ll force myself to stay calm for her <br/>
sake!  She also loves her pets--a rabbit, cat, and a fish tank which <br/>
is filled with some things she&#39;s caught in streams and ponds herself--<br/>
minnows, newts, snails as well as a frog and a fish we bought at a <br/>
pet store.  She wants me to look into breeding bunnies for sale to <br/>
medical facilities, which would make for a real interesting house!  <br/>
(Is saying that going to get me into trouble on this list? lol) She <br/>
also likes the Top Secret Adventures kit by Highlights, which covers <br/>
world geography.  (Disclaimer:  I don&#39;t encourage her to do it so <br/>
that she learns geography.  It is entirely her idea.) She also enjoys <br/>
cooking and baking and often chooses her own recipe, goes with me to <br/>
the store to get ingredients, and cooks/bakes entirely on her own <br/>
(with me close by to help if I&#39;m needed).  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, maybe your daughter&#39;s interests will be completely <br/>
different than my daughter&#39;s!  Don&#39;t just do something with her <br/>
because you feel she *should* be interested in it.  Just watch her <br/>
and see what she likes to do.  It might take awhile before you see <br/>
something creative emerging, but sooner or later, she&#39;ll ask you to <br/>
play a game with her, or take her somewhere, even do her hair fancy.  <br/>
Whatever it is, do it with her, even if it doesn&#39;t &quot;seem&quot; <br/>
educational.  It might lead to something &quot;educational&quot; but even if it <br/>
doesn&#39;t, you had a fun time doing something together as mother and <br/>
daughter!  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573199954">I&#39;ll share a few thoughts on meeting state homeschool requirements.  <br/>
I haven&#39;t read Maine&#39;s laws except for reading a quick summary on <br/>
HSLDA, so I&#39;m not sure how much of this applies to you.  Take what is <br/>
helpful from this and disregard the rest.  I&#39;m from PA.  We have to <br/>
take standardized tests in grades 3, 5, and 8 AND be evaluated by <br/>
a &quot;qualified&quot; evaluator yearly AND hand in samples of students&#39; work <br/>
to the school district yearly. (Be glad you don&#39;t live here!)  <br/>
However, I&#39;ve learned a few things from some homeschoolers who have <br/>
been complying longer than I have.  First, we have to take <br/>
standardized tests in math and reading only and the school district <br/>
can&#39;t legally hold our scores against us.  Perhaps that&#39;s the case in <br/>
your state?  Does it matter how well they score?  If the requirement <br/>
is just that you take the test and not that you score a certain way, <br/>
then don&#39;t worry about it.  It seems your law offers the option of <br/>
having a certified teacher evaluate you.  I would probably choose <br/>
that option if I were you.  Start hunting down an unschooling <br/>
friendly evaluator.  I would see if there&#39;s a statewide homeschool <br/>
email list in your state and start asking if any evaluators are <br/>
unschooling friendly.  There are a few in PA who do distance <br/>
evaluations for homeschoolers in other parts of PA.  We mail her <br/>
samples of the work and then she does the interview (very friendly <br/>
and informal) with the child over the phone.  So consider that as an <br/>
option.  Depending on the specifics of your law, even if you can only <br/>
find an unschooling friendly evaluator in another part of the state, <br/>
a distance evaluation might work for you.  <br/>

&gt; How do I get away from the workbook syndrome LOL and think out of <br/>

<br/>
You sit down and you figure out what you feel is important. Once you <br/>
figure out what you believe, stick to it and don&#39;t worry about what <br/>
others think.  As a Christian, one of the reasons I was led to <br/>
unschooling is because I realized that I was worrying so much about <br/>
academic stuff that the real important things were suffering.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t taking proper care of the house which made life stressful for <br/>
dh.  I wasn&#39;t spending enough time studying the Bible on my own.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t spending enough time in prayer.  I stopped and asked myself <br/>
why I had time to do math workbooks but not sit down and read my <br/>
Bible for 15 minutes!  And, how did I expect my children to ever <br/>
develop a close relationship with the Lord if I never set the <br/>
example?  Which was more important--mastering math facts at 8 years <br/>
old or developing a relationship with the Lord?  Learning the grammar <br/>
rules or having a relatively stress free family life?  I also had the <br/>
humbling realization that I can&#39;t possibly know what the Lord has in <br/>
store for her life, so I would be much wiser to just led the Holy <br/>
Spirit lead her and be there to train her as He leads her.  <br/>
<br/>
Your reasons might not be my reasons.  You have to decide for <br/>
yourself what you feel is important in your life and in your <br/>
children&#39;s lives and then go do it. <br/>

Leonhardt&#39;s &quot;Parents Who Love Reading, Kids Who Don&#39;t&quot;. It describes how <br/>

described myself as &quot;almost an unschooler&quot; so I&#39;m not sure if my take <br/>
on it would be the same now as it was then.  Back then I would have <br/>
described it as &quot;ok for someone who needs to get over being a school-<br/>

person to whom I lent the book a call and see if she still knows <br/>
where it is.  <br/>

I&#39;m 3/4 of the way through How Children Learn by John Holt.  I also <br/>
got The Continuum concept but my daughter is giving me that for <br/>
Christmas and she has it pretty well wrapped.  I&#39;ll have to wait <br/>
until after Christmas to read that one.  Any other recommendations?  <br/>

&gt; I copied what they require as far as standardized tests are concerned.<br/>
&gt; Here it is:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Standardized Tests: Parents complying with the home school rules (under<br/>
&gt; option 1 above) have several options. An annual assessment must be filed<br/>
&gt; with the State Department of Education which must consist of one of the<br/>
&gt; following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. annual standardized test or,<br/>
&gt; 2. a local test or,<br/>
&gt; 3. review of progress by a Maine certified teacher or a local advisory<br/>
&gt; board selected by the superintendent or a home school support group that<br/>
&gt; includes a Maine certified teacher. Rules Sec. 3(J).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To be honest, I&#39;m not sure if it is possible to unschool in a state like<br/>
&gt; Maine.  They require annual testing.  Can you find out how many years in<br/>
&gt; a row your child can fail the test before she&#39;s required to go back to<br/>
&gt; school?  I think the longer a child has the opportunity to unschool, the<br/>
&gt; better.  The older s/he is, the better s/he will be able to put up with<br/>
&gt; the bull the state requires without much harm to her psyche.  That&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; personal opinion.  I honestly don&#39;t know how else to advise you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have not read John Holt&#39;s &#39;Learning All the Time&quot;, please do so.<br/>
&gt; It is an excellent introduction to unschooling.  Alfie Kohn&#39;s &quot;Punished<br/>
&gt; by Rewards&quot; is also an excellent book.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] OK here is my question :0) How do<br/>
&gt; &gt; they learn??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   OK.  Well, first of all, and as a former high school geography<br/>
&gt; &gt; teacher,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   let me suggest to you that if she has no interest in geography and<br/>
&gt; &gt;   history facts then why bother with it.? Now, I see in the rest of your<br/>
&gt; &gt;   post that you mention THE STATE and testing.  I&#39;m not sure how to deal<br/>
&gt; &gt;   with that.  We live here in Texas where testing is not required.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt;   very free here.  The only thing I can think of is just tell your child<br/>
&gt; &gt;   that THE STATE requires her to know certain things, etc.  I would make<br/>
&gt; &gt;   it very clear to her that it&#39;s not that important to you.  You just<br/>
&gt; &gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt;   her to learn what is interesting and important to her.  But, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; THE<br/>
&gt; &gt;   STATE requires this, and this, and that, she must learn it otherwise<br/>
&gt; &gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt;   will have to go back to school.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I have noticed that with many states you have to fall below the 40%<br/>
&gt; &gt; mark<br/>
&gt; &gt;   for several years in a row before the state will force you to put your<br/>
&gt; &gt;   child in school.  I would go the unschooling route for as long as you<br/>
&gt; &gt;   can until perhaps the last year when you explain to her the<br/>
&gt; &gt; consequences<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and allow her to make her choice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   My boys are only 7 years old and we live in Texas where the<br/>
&gt; &gt;   homeschooling laws are very lenient, so I can only tell you what I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt;   do.  I really don&#39;t have any experience with your situation.  What<br/>
&gt; &gt; state<br/>
&gt; &gt;   do you live in, by the way?  And what are the specific requirements of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   homeschoolers that the state dictates?  Maybe someone else on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; list<br/>
&gt; &gt;   can help you further.  I wish you luck.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; We have been homeschooling for a year (officially but actually her<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; whole life LOL).  My Daughter is almost 8 and very bored.  We have been<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; doing workbooks and she reads A LOT but only likes Babysitter Club<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; books mostly.  She is an EXCELLENT reader.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; So, she doesn&#39;t know many Geography, History, etc facts.  How does she<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; learn these if she has no interest? Or the multipication tables? Or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; everything else the state wants her tested on every year? She has NO<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; interest in &quot;school stuff&quot; so I am coming here to ask what is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; unschooling exactly and how does it work?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I am so interested you cannot even imagine! I have 5 children...almost<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 8, almost 6 (Autism), 4, 3, 1.  I just want to fit school in with life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; HELP!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Melissa<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; P.S. Specific things to do would be wonderful, I have NO imagination at<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; all on what to do besides book work.<br/>

I think the last one, Linda Dobson&#39;s &quot;The Art of Education,&quot; is <br/>
probably the one I turn to most when I need reminding why we do this. <br/>
Of course, I edited that book... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
