Have you met/talked to anyone who advocated violence in the name of<br/>
protesting today?  <br/>
The only people I see harming innocent women and children are the Taliban<br/>
and our government.<br/>
Some of the time, you seem to think that protest is okay and other times<br/>
you seem to associate ALL protesters with the minority of violent<br/>
protesters in the 60&#39;s.  (for the record - Wendy and I have had an<br/>
ongoing conversation elsewhere about a similar topic)  I really don&#39;t<br/>
want ot disect the 60&#39;s with you, Lynda can probably do it better anyway,<br/>
but I don&#39;t think there were many in the 60&#39;s who advocated violence.  I<br/>
think the media just played it up to look like there were, sort of like<br/>
the media was doing to Homeschoolers with Andrea Yates, the Idaho mom and<br/>
Thomas Lavery.<br/>
<br/>
And who do think is ASKING for propaganda?  I don&#39;t think I understand<br/>

better than ours.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442440272">Well, upon rereading this . . . it is nowhere near as coherant as I<br/>
thought it was.  What I am trying to say is that I don&#39;t understand what<br/>
you mean to say, not,  &quot;I don&#39;t understand you.&quot; as in the &quot;are you<br/>
crazy?&quot; connotation it carries when worded that way.  You seem to<br/>
contradict yourself and I am truly confused and wondering what you really<br/>
mean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848169827">Here&#39;s how the media works.  I&#39;ll use a high profile case that most everyone<br/>
heard about, Patty Hearst.  The media told you about a poor little rich girl<br/>
who was kidnapped and how the evil (notice that word again) SLA used her for<br/>
their own ends.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the reality.  Patty hung around Berkeley and was a radical sh*t<br/>
disturber from the get go.  She was arrested on at least 3 occasions that I<br/>
personally know of for &quot;intent to insite a riot.&quot;  One of her more enfamous<br/>
speeches was about &quot;make yourself available&quot; blah, blah, blah &quot;so your<br/>
capitalist warmongering dog parents will have to buy your safety.&quot;  She<br/>
continued on to outline the plan.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I went to school with Nancy Ling, later to add the last name Perry.<br/>
Nancy was quiet, comfortable, not rich, an Honor student, student body<br/>
official, and very concerned about what was happening in our world.  We all<br/>
use to go down to Berkeley and hang around People&#39;s Park complaining and<br/>
protesting about what was going on.  By then the 3 classes that we knew the<br/>
best (ours, the before and the one after us) numbered about 700 kids and<br/>
already over 70 of the boys we went to school with had died.  We were not<br/>
happy campers.<br/>
<br/>
We all knew Patty.  We all hung out together.  A favorite place was Jack<br/>
London Square.  Patty continually talked about how to set up &quot;kidnapping&quot;<br/>
and how to get the borgouise (o.k., so I can&#39;t spell &lt;g&gt;) dogs (meaning<br/>
parents) to &quot;cough up their blood money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She was NOT kidnapped.  She was the &quot;brains&quot; of the plans to kidnap folks.<br/>
There were two or three others but they never made the news.  Maybe because<br/>
her father owned the news???  Her arrest records have &quot;vanished.&quot;  Those of<br/>
us who use to hang around the coffee shops were all contacted and threatened<br/>
if we said boo about what really happened.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY PEOPLE who they could positively ID as having been at the last<br/>
planning meeting were killed in a fire in LA!<br/>
<br/>
What the average citizen does not realise is that most of the violence that<br/>
is attributed to radical protesters has usually been perpetrated by the<br/>
government.  If you look into any group the Feebs have taken on you will<br/>
find a gun fight and a fire!<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to note that both the LA fire and the Waco fire have some<br/>
real close similarities, &quot;they fired on us&quot; and &quot;we only used tear gas<br/>
cannisters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The average citizen needs to know that the Feebs give seminars to local<br/>
police departments that supposedly are to show how to dismantle pipe bombs.<br/>
There was one held here at College of the Redwoods.  Shortly thereafter Judi<br/>
Berry was injured and ultimately died from injuries received from a pipe<br/>
bomb.  There was another seminar held shortly before a vehicle that belonged<br/>
to AIM activists blew up from a pipe bomb.<br/>
<br/>
The average citizen needs to know that the Feebs train groups and<br/>
individuals to infilitrate organizations and to do violent acts in the name<br/>
of the organization they want to look bad.<br/>
<br/>
Take Alcatraz for instance.  There was NO damage done to any building except<br/>
for some grafitti on the front of the building declaring it Indian land.<br/>
ALL the media and all the polls were in favor of the island being given back<br/>
to the Indians as the law dictates (any abandoned federal land belongs be<br/>
rights to any local tribe that applies for it).  The Feebs and government<br/>
were getting hundreds of calls and letters each day telling them to back off<br/>
and follow the law and give back the land.  A group of 3 white men brought<br/>
over a boat with food.  They supposedly were supporters of the effort.  Two<br/>
nights later there were fires in the buildings and a major fire.  The next<br/>
day the three men left and their names turned out to be phoney.  The press<br/>
were fed some inflamatory information saying the Indians had deliberately<br/>
set fire to the building which was considered to be of historical<br/>
significance (by who no one could ever figure out) as a way of thumbing<br/>
their noses at the white community.<br/>
<br/>
Take the protests in Seattle.  All you read about or saw on television was<br/>
the group that were breaking up windows and stealing things.  Those folks<br/>
were NOT part of the protestors.  They were a group that has Feeb ties that<br/>
routinely show up to cause violence so that the average citizen will<br/>
correlate the protest with violence.<br/>
<br/>
The list goes on but I&#39;ll shut up now &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, who is sure she just heard a big sigh of relief &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; the protests weren&#39;t usually violent - or at least not much more violence<br/>
than one would expect from having so many people in one space - UNTIL<br/>
the government became violent until trying to stop them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Outside the Student Union Building at the University of New Mexico in May, <br/>
1970, there was a NON-violent protest, stopped by National Guardsmen with <br/>
bayonets.  One student was skewered; didn&#39;t die.  Bled on the concrete, which <br/>
sympathizers put something clear like verethane over and the bloodmarks <br/>
stayed there a long time that way.  <br/>
<br/>
The next fall there was teargas sprayed on campus a couple of times.  A <br/>
pregnant friend opened a door to the outside and stepped right into a cloud <br/>
of teargas.  She was okay, but it scared us all.<br/>

of the violence in Seattle was caused by the police.  Same with Quebec City <br/>

to the place where she and others were sleeping and beat the tar out of <br/>
them.  Then they confiscated all her belongings and deported her.  She had <br/>
