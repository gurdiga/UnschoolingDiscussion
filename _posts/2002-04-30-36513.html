<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639935226">Ok, I am new here and totally confused over this ice-cream issue, and am<br/>
actually finding it quite hysterical...though, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve missed<br/>
something.  Also, can someone please tell me what TCS is?  I won&#39;t get<br/>
involved with the ice cream and choice conversations...I am dealing with<br/>
similar issues. ha!<br/>
Take care all!<br/>
