&quot;What am I not doing with them that they can watch tv<br/>
all day long?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are you playing games and interacting with him several<br/>
hours a day? Do you have him help you make cookies and<br/>
go to the store and hang out the laundry and take him<br/>
to the park or playground? Are you reading books he<br/>
likes to him and washing the puppy and taking long<br/>
walks in the woods?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about letting the kids go it alone. <br/>
It is about freeing them up and helping them discover.<br/>
 Unschooling actually seems to take more parental<br/>
involvement than school-out-of-a-box homeschooling.<br/>

I was spending too much time on the internet at one point and it was hurting my kids and my family. I had to change my habits. Talk with him about his behaviour maybe? Sit down and watch the questionable shows with him? I don&#39;t think the answer is to switch off the TV and censor his shows however. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get more help from other onthe list.<br/>

How old is he?  I notice you&#39;re expecting a new baby, (congratulations!) <br/>
has your time with Nicolas been limited lately?   Is he getting people<br/>
time from the TV that he might not be getting from you because you&#39;re<br/>
more tired right now? <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s feeling separated from you at the moment I think it&#39;s smart of<br/>
him, human of him, to seek out other people.  He&#39;s found some on TV that<br/>
are pretty interesting.   <br/>
<br/>
Even though he has all those toys and books and art supplies he probably<br/>
wants someone to interact with while he does them.   He might not be<br/>
choosing them because if it&#39;s people time he&#39;s craving those things won&#39;t<br/>
fulfill him if his only option is doing them alone. <br/>

<br/>
I think all the claims about TV affecting behavior and attitude are<br/>
hooey.  I think what affects behavior and attitude is feeling like no one<br/>
wants to do anything with you so TV is all there is.  And I think not<br/>
eating the right kinds of protein and energy supplying foods makes a<br/>
little body tired and grumpy and uncomfortable.    So, maybe you could<br/>
make a nice plate of cheese cubes and sliced apples or something and sit<br/>
with him and hold his hand and be lovey, and talk about what he likes<br/>
about the program.   You could offer to play a game you know he likes. <br/>
You could offer to read to him, go for a walk with him, play with toys<br/>
with him.   If you offer, take into consideration the thing he&#39;s watching<br/>
might really be important to him and he might like to watch it to the<br/>
end.  Maybe together you could find a great time for playing or reading. <br/>
 Even if he still prefers to watch TV you could be there with him some of<br/>
the time, talking to him, playing a little, touching him. <br/>
<br/>
Would he like to sleep with you at night and is that possible?  Creating<br/>
closeness between you will decrease his need for finding companionship<br/>
through television, if that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. <br/>

It&#39;s different with everyone, but it also takes a change in the parent&#39;s view of things to be able to notice the changes.  What is it that you&#39;re looking for to change?  Whatever it is, make sure you&#39;re not waiting for him to start doing &#39;schoolish&#39; things on his own.  <br/>

<br/>
Are you playing with him?  Are you doing arts and crafts with him?  Reading to/with him?  Going outside with him?  Those things may not seem fun if he feels like he&#39;s left to himself to do them.  Sometimes doing things with someone is a lot more enjoyable than just having a big pile of stuff sitting there waiting for someone to &#39;do&#39; it.  <br/>
<br/>
~~I know its not unschooling<br/>

<br/>
Everyone is different.  Why should reading be such a huge part of someone&#39;s life?  Or building?  Or cleaning?  Or singing?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe right now he LIKES the TV.  Maybe next month he&#39;ll be into something else.  I would sit and watch his shows with him, talk to him about them, ask questions why he likes this show over that one, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If you could give us some more info it would be helpful.  How old is he?  How long have you been unschooling?  Did he go to school before this?  What did he like to do before he started on his TV binge?  <br/>
<br/>
If you feel like you&#39;re in a rut with him, get out of the house!  Change things around.  New things to see and explore.  New places to shop.  Anything to change what you&#39;re doing will help.  And it will help you as much as it will him.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can give us a better picture of what&#39;s going on maybe we can help more.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; problem with the television. Nicolas likes to watch TV ALL DAY LONG.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*******************************************<br/>
<br/>
From an unschooling perspective, I think the first question to ask yourself<br/>
is...does NICOLAS have a problem with TV?  The issue is about him, not you<br/>
(I always hate that part &lt;grin&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Then, does the fact that YOU have a problem with tv indicate to Nicolas that<br/>
he better hurry up and watch it before you get fed up and decide to take his<br/>
freedom away again?<br/>
<br/>
I used to be very controlling about the tv, naps, bedtimes, you name it, I<br/>
controlled it....all in the name of doing what was &quot;best&quot; for my kids.  When<br/>
we completely let go about 3 years ago, Adriane was 10.  She sat in a<br/>
recliner and watched tv for about 3 months.  I mean she rarely moved at all.<br/>
She got grumpy and mean which is very much against her nature so I pointed<br/>
out that lots of people and animals get grumpy when they aren&#39;t getting much<br/>
movement, much fresh air, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Adriane ignored that advice....can you imagine that &lt;grin&gt;?  She continued<br/>
to sit and watch....then I noticed her flipping channels more.  So I would<br/>
invite her on outings with me and the younger kids.  Sometimes she would go<br/>
(I would point out that she seemed happier being out of the house....I never<br/>
demonized tv, just talked about what was happening to her body).<br/>
Eventually, she made the connection about too much sedantary life and not<br/>
feeling well.<br/>
<br/>
She now goes in spurts.  Somedays she is up in her room reading and doing<br/>
jigsaw puzzles all day, or maybe out playing with the little kids (they<br/>
built a launcher and send my son flying through the air), or she might watch<br/>
tv all day.  But I notice that most of what she watches is dealing with<br/>
relationships, social interaction, morals, etc., stuff a 13yo is dealing<br/>
with in her head that she may or may not want to share with her mom.<br/>
<br/>
In defense of &quot;fluff&quot; tv, Adriane used to watch all the Disney teenie-bopper<br/>
shows over and over, Lizzie Mcguire, Smart Kid, Sister Sister.  I truly<br/>
thought my head might explode, then something happened to make me realize<br/>
there is no such thing as &quot;fluff&quot; tv, books, music, anything.....that it ALL<br/>
counts as Sandra says.<br/>
<br/>
When she was about 11, Adriane was watching a show and the joke was that a<br/>
black kid didn&#39;t know who Harriett Tubman was.  Adriane laughed like she got<br/>
the joke.  I asked her if she knew who Ms. Tubman was and she said yes.  She<br/>
had learned about the underground railroad watching Sister Sister.  Go<br/>
figure.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry its so long....just wanted to say, relax, enjoy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;How long does it take to really see any changes?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you really changed?<br/>
Are you just leaving them at home day after day hoping they&#39;ll find the whole <br/>
world at home?   Get out into the outside world more often!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is a concern for me, because he likes to watch the shows<br/>
that promote more violence and selfish attitude and less of a moral<br/>
theme. They also tend to get him VERY excited and I notice him acting<br/>
out a lot. I KNOW this happens.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you watch with him?   I think spending your time separate from him could <br/>
be the problem.    Rent videos you would both enjoy and discuss the stories, <br/>
the filmaking, the locations, the acting, the characters.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;AND, the thing I most worry about is his<br/>
eating habits when in front of the TV...he will munch out of boredom and<br/>
this is just not healthy. He is a bit overweight already and snacking<br/>
all day wont help him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is he making his own snacks?  Take him good food once in a while.<br/>
If he&#39;s bored, you&#39;re not doing as good an unschooling-mom job as you could <br/>
be doing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have tried to &quot;let go&quot; and let him watch TV all day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Letting go of controlls isnt the whole deal.  You need to create a rich <br/>
environment, and provide stimulating experiences.  Even though unschooling isn&#39;t <br/>
teaching from a curriculum, it&#39;s not something kids should or can be expected to <br/>
do themselves.  You should still be spending LOTS of time with them, on them, <br/>
around them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, then he starts in with the bad attitude and the nasty tone of<br/>
speaking to all of us and I cant tolerate it. I know its not unschooling<br/>
if I limit&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not unschooling if you ignore him and build up resentment about him not <br/>
doing your job, either.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I would sit and watch his shows with him, talk to him about them, ask <br/>
questions why he likes this show over that one, etc.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a warning to offer about this.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ask in a belittling and judgmental way if you can avoid it.  Don&#39;t say <br/>
&quot;Why could you possibly like THIS stupid show?  It&#39;s ridiculous.  I can&#39;t <br/>
believe anyone would watch it. &quot;   Not even a little of it, if you can help it.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell me The Friendly Giant was a stupid show, and I should <br/>
turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
The Friendly Giant was being nicer to me than my mom was, by FAR, even before <br/>
she came in and reminded me that she was ignorant and hateful.<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes Fear Factor and Ripley&#39;s Believe it or Not.  I&#39;ve teased her a <br/>
little bit, and I regret it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty likes Jerry Springer.  He knows it&#39;s mostly bogus stuff, but it&#39;s so <br/>
far out of his own experience (since he lives in a peaceful place without <br/>
exposure to insane relatives, unlike my own childhood) he&#39;s interested.   I&#39;ve <br/>
teased him a bit, andI wish I hadn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So what I decided to do was to tell them stories about my own childhood <br/>
fascinations.  The National Enquirer started off not being about celebrities at <br/>
all, but about gruesome car wrecks, trainwrecks, and violent unsolved crimes.   <br/>
Or freakish happenings like people down wells, earthquake photos (before you <br/>
could get live satellite video), and a man who saved his wife when she fell by <br/>
grabbing her by her long braids and pulling her up.<br/>
<br/>
I liked those photos a LOT when I was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
And I told them about Queen for a Day, one of the most pathetic tv shows <br/>
EVER, which I also watched as a child, feeling my compassion well up for that poor <br/>
family living without electricity who only wanted a hand-crank washing <br/>
machine (or whatever the sad stories were).  I missed the Depression and WWII, but <br/>
the 50&#39;s could be sad enough.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t saying &quot;I&#39;m so proud of you for watching freak shows on TV,&quot; I was <br/>
saying &quot;I understand the urge; did it myself, though I had to augment with <br/>
newsprint.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; In other words, you may not see what you&#39;re hoping for while you&#39;re so <br/>
fixated on it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or you might be looking for a moth and ignoring all those butterflies coming <br/>
out and flying around.<br/>
<br/>
I went to find a link to an article just to find it&#39;s not online.  Huh.  <br/>
Bummer.  <br/>
<br/>
Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
appeared in Nov/Dec 2001 HEM<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll See It When You Believe It<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Following years of sporadic claims by people who claimed they had tried <br/>
unschooling but it hadn&#39;t worked for them, I started tracking their similarities <br/>
and, as usual, I learned something new.  And, as usual, I thought I should share <br/>
it so others might not have to wonder for ten years.  <br/>
<br/>
So here is a snapshot of what I thought I knew when I sat down to write this <br/>
one day not too long ago:  Some people don&#39;t know what unschooling is supposed <br/>
to look like.  <br/>
<br/>
If I went to the flea market to buy a torque wrench but I didn&#39;t know what <br/>
one looked like, I would have a pretty hard time just finding one by looking <br/>
around.  It probably wouldn&#39;t be on a table with clocks made of cross-cut cedar.  <br/>
Looking through a tray of cassette tapes wouldn&#39;t help.  It would be <br/>
especially difficult if I didn&#39;t even know what a torque wrench was for.  I might look <br/>
all through those wirey-boards and steel boxes computer-repair guy brought.  <br/>
I could look for hours through cloth and paperback books and come home saying <br/>
&quot;Going to the flea market for a torque wrench doesn&#39;t work.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to go to the flea market regularly, pre-motherhood, to buy medieval- <br/>
and Rennaisance-suggesting things to re-sell in the SCA.  It was fun.  I used <br/>
to make enough to pay our way to tournaments by setting up my little homemade <br/>
tent and some tables covered with pewter and silver-plated bowls and plates, <br/>
cast aluminum tankards or goblets, hand-blown glasses from Mexico, fur collars, <br/>
little wooden jewelry chests, old-looking jewelry, leather bags, brocade <br/>
curtains (without fiberglass or rubber), interesting little knives, wooden trays <br/>
and bowls, and so forth.  I&#39;d sell them cheap, too.  I learned a lot doing that, <br/>
and had fun.<br/>
<br/>
The Albuquerque flea market is huge.  I would stand, walk, and pull my cart <br/>
for two or three hours, scanning for shiny metal dishes, wood, leather, certain <br/>
designs.  But most of the stuff got only enough glance to determine it was <br/>
NOT what I was looking for.  I ignored piles of baby clothes, electronics, <br/>
plastics and hand tools.  Many a torque wrench lay unseen.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers come away from a small school and into the big wide world.  Some <br/>
say &quot;Here is the wide world, and we will be in it and learn from everything <br/>
around us.&quot;  Then they proceed to scan specifically for math, history, science, <br/>
reading and writing.  Because they went to school, math to them looks like <br/>
flat paper with numbers on it.  History looks like books many words and a few <br/>
maps and illustrations, all arranged in chronological order.  Science is wide <br/>
open—it might be a microscope, or a bug cage or some rocks and a magnifying <br/>
glass, until the kids are older, and then it will start looking like numbers on <br/>
flat paper, or maybe a book on anatomy, or the feared and revered &quot;Periodic Chart <br/>
of the Elements.&quot;  Reading and writing should look like reading and writing <br/>
have always looked—books without illustrations (eventually, and the sooner and <br/>
thicker the better), and reports with straight margins and numbered pages.<br/>
<br/>
They scan their children&#39;s lives every day for schoolish things.  They&#39;re <br/>
looking for spiral notebooks and they ignore sunsets.  Looking for a 50-minute <br/>
session of history to prove attention span, they miss a pioneer dress-up game <br/>
and an attempt to build a catapult.  <br/>
<br/>
As a final stop before giving up, some come and declare their failure to <br/>
those who told them about unschooling.  They tell us it didn&#39;t work for their <br/>
family, and that after all, they are the experts in their children, and so they <br/>
know that their own family is not creative enough to unschool, and their <br/>
children crave structure.  Sometimes it seems they think those who say &quot;Unschooling <br/>
is So COOL!&quot; are deluded nuts who don&#39;t care much about their children.  Other <br/>
times I think they see our children as brilliant and theirs as dullards.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have come to believe that they just ignored the million things looking <br/>
for the five or six.  <br/>
<br/>
They thought if they left the kid alone for a month he might spontaneously <br/>
create a four-subject routine, with some music, art and sports put in for <br/>
extracurricular balance.  They envisioned that their child might say, at the age of <br/>
fourteen (give or take a few) years, &quot;I&#39;m ready to learn biology now,&quot; which <br/>
would be the beginning of nine months of study, with three dissections and some <br/>
tadpole measuring, maybe some plant genetics.  By May they should declare <br/>
whether they were more interested in botany or life sciences (step one in &quot;do you <br/>
want to go to medical school?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
When a science-minded kid loves to take the dog down by the river and look <br/>
for wild berries and snakes, some parents say, &quot;My kid just wants to play.  He&#39;s <br/>
not interested in learning.  He&#39;ll never learn science just playing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Each little experience, every idea, is helping your child build his internal <br/>
model of the universe.  He will not have the government-recommended blueprint <br/>
for the internal model of the universe, which can look surprisingly like a <br/>
school, and a political science class, a small flat map of the huge spherical <br/>
world, a job with increasing vacations leading to retirement, and not a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled children can organize their knowledge in free and better ways.  <br/>
They never need to feel they are through learning, or past the point that they <br/>
can begin something new.  Each thing they discover can be useful eventually.  <br/>
If we help provide them with ever-changing opportunities to see, hear, smell, <br/>
taste, feel, move and discuss, what they know will exceed in breadth and depth <br/>
what any school&#39;s curriculum would have covered.  It won&#39;t be the same set of <br/>
materials—it will be clearer and larger but different.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How will they learn everything they need to know?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do the best of the high school graduates know everything they need to know?  <br/>
No, and at some point, ideally, they start learning on their own.  Some fail <br/>
to get to that point, though.  Unschooled kids have a head start.  They know <br/>
how to find what they need to know, and they have not been trained to ignore <br/>
things that won&#39;t be on the test.<br/>
<br/>
When parents see how and what their children are actually learning instead of <br/>
just scanning for the half dozen school-things, unschooling will make sense <br/>
to the parents.  If you wait for school to congeal from a busy life, you&#39;ll <br/>
keep being disappointed.  If you learn to see everything instead of just school <br/>
things, unschooling will start working for you.  When you see it you will <br/>
believe it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How long does it take to really see any changes?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Longer than you have given it and it will come with more changes from you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Nicolas likes to watch TV ALL DAY LONG. I<br/>
have only seen him walk away a couple of times and returns to it at<br/>
once.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay now we know he really doesn&#39;t watch tv &quot;all day long.&quot; There are park<br/>
days and sports camp days and up until recently he was swimming every day<br/>
too, (inside information!) wasn&#39;t he? No tv there. So tv all day long means<br/>
more than you are comfortable with. And that&#39;s okay, it just means it&#39;s a<br/>
problem for you and not him. Plus you have said that there are times when<br/>
you just can&#39;t take it anymore and turn it off and make him do other things.<br/>
So that is a limit on him and he&#39;s probably not comfortable with turning it<br/>
off himself because he never knows when you might come and do that. Best to<br/>
get in all the tv time he can before that happens.<br/>
<br/>
I know you think tv is waste of time or not at all the uselful tool some<br/>
think it to be. Again fine for you. But Nicolas is obviously getting<br/>
something from it that isn&#39;t coming from other things he could be doing. Sit<br/>
with him and find out what those things are. Maybe from watching and talking<br/>
to him about the shows, no matter how stupid you think they are, you can<br/>
find that he does have other interests besides just sitting. He&#39;s not just<br/>
sitting, there are things going on his mind that would probably astound<br/>
you!!<br/>
<br/>
Also keep track of the times he isn&#39;t watching tv and let those times<br/>
convince you he isn&#39;t watching all day long. Instead of focusing on how much<br/>
he watches, start with how much he doesn&#39;t. I bet as time goes on, if you<br/>
can let go of the limits,  those non watching times will decrease. If you<br/>
can&#39;t let go of the limits, just be aware that his tv time will be more<br/>
important to him than ever because he won&#39;t know when it ends.<br/>
<br/>

Good point.  Always talk to your kids like you&#39;re talking to an adult.  (Or at least someone you have respect for, lol.)  Listen to what you&#39;re saying to them, and ask yourself how you would feel if someone was talking to you in the same way.  If you feel good about it, cool!  If not, then don&#39;t say it!  <br/>

Kirby&#39;s playing a new X-Box game.  Pirates of the Carribean.  You have to <br/>
recruit a crew for your ship, learn to read maps and avoid storms, etc.  If too <br/>
many on your crew have a negative attitude, your crew won&#39;t work together well, <br/>
so when you&#39;re recruiting, it said, you don&#39;t want people with bad attitudes. <br/>

Doh.  I mean not counting when the issue it was in was current.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-429388843">***I used to do this (even make whole families) using Sears and Roebuck <br/>
catalogues. Very absorbing, with backstories for all of them. And it<br/>
never <br/>
occurred to me to &quot;play&quot; it with anyone. I was relating to the paper<br/>
people <br/>
directly, like some omniscient being.  &lt;G&gt;  ***<br/>
<br/>
People in the Sears catalog were my victims. My brother and I used to<br/>
&quot;tie&quot; them to the rail road tracks ( he had a Lionel train)  and we&#39;d see<br/>
how many times the train could run them over before they were cut into<br/>
pieces.   I don&#39;t think any of them were married first but I would have<br/>
loved the idea of hysterical loved ones watching the approaching train in<br/>
horror. <br/>

pool and while all the Barbies were enjoying their leisurely swim a Ken <br/>
head would fly into the pool out of nowhere (well, obviously it was one <br/>
of us popping his head off and tossing it into the bucket for kicks).  <br/>
We&#39;d make all the dolls scream in horror and try to stampede out of <br/>
their pool while they all screamed &quot;Dead head!!!!&quot; (not in reference to <br/>
the Grateful Dead&#39;s fans lol).  Good times!  ;)<br/>

And you grew up violent?<br/>
(Maybe you got it out of your system. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever imagine people who piss you off being photographed, published, <br/>
cut out and put on the Lionel tracks?<br/>
<br/>
If so, I guess catalogs and model trains are just as dangerous to developing <br/>
psyches as toy guns and watching westers and cop shows.<br/>
(They probably are exactly as dangerous, which is to say *not.*)<br/>

I think what&#39;s dangerous is so many people blindly listening to (and believing in) some of the crackpot &#39;experts&#39; and their theories on raising children.  <br/>
<br/>
An idiot can go to college and get an &#39;education&#39;, but what you may end up with is an educated idiot.<br/>

You might just get an idiot with a diploma who never understood anything and <br/>
doesn&#39;t remember the short-term-memory memorization he did for the tests.<br/>

******************************************<br/>
<br/>
One of my school-at-home friends was over the other day after we had gone to<br/>
see &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; and she was telling me how she didn&#39;t know much about<br/>
Japanese history, how interesting the movie had been, etc..  Then it came up<br/>
that she couldn&#39;t wait for  Christmas vacation to be over so the kids could<br/>
get back to learning.  Their minds were going to mush from just playing<br/>
video games all day.  (Of course, I&#39;m thinking who made the rules of<br/>
Christmas vacation for homeschoolers?)<br/>
<br/>
I asked if she thought her kids would be willing to help me figure out how<br/>
to play &quot;Romance VII&quot;, a game set during the Samurai period but that was<br/>
rather complicated.  I told her it involved role playing, decision making, a<br/>
study of history, strategy, etc..  My kids are gone for a week and I thought<br/>
it would be nice to be able to show them how to play when they got back.<br/>
<br/>
My friend looked at me like I grew 2 heads.  She said she was sure they<br/>
would love it but the point was she didn&#39;t want them playing any more vidoe<br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
I continue to be baffled at why parents think it is necessary to suck all<br/>
the joy out of their kids&#39; days. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

&gt; Kirby&#39;s playing a new X-Box game.  Pirates of the Carribean.  You have to<br/>
&gt; recruit a crew for your ship, learn to read maps and avoid storms, etc.<br/>
If too<br/>
&gt; many on your crew have a negative attitude, your crew won&#39;t work together<br/>
well,<br/>
&gt; so when you&#39;re recruiting, it said, you don&#39;t want people with bad<br/>
attitudes.<br/>
&gt;   He said &quot;What is &#39;elated&#39;?&quot;  And I said really happy, so happy you feel<br/>
