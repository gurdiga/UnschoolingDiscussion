<div id="ygrps-yiv-437670805">Hi I am Sherilyn and this is the first time that I have posted, <br/>
though I have been reading for a while.  I have six-year-old gifted <br/>
daughter, Kennedy and a four-year-old developmentally delayed <br/>
daughter, Victoria and I find that unschooling is perfect for both <br/>
of them.  I love to watch them both spend the day doing things that <br/>
are perfectly right for them, unaltered by someone else directing <br/>
their time and energy.  Because they unschool, they are able to <br/>
focus on the things that interest them and learn about their own <br/>
strengths and talents rather than concerning themselves with what <br/>
everybody else is doing and whether or not they exceed or fall below <br/>
the average expectancy.  Kennedy never has to worry about being <br/>
bored with what is going in the classroom or having her creativity <br/>
squelched because she has to follow the approved classroom <br/>
procedures.  Victoria never has to experience feeling substandard or <br/>
stupid because she isn&#39;t encountering developmental or academic <br/>
milestones at the same rate as other children her age.  I believe, <br/>
as a result, they are and will be much happier children than if they <br/>
went to school.</div>
