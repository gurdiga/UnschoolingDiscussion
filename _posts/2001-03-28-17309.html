 </span></blockquote>4 of my children *have* grown up. One is over seas.  One is a father <br/>
of 2 boys.  I cant believe how they have grown!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why dont you grow up&quot;!!  I sometimes cry to myself &quot;WHY did you grow <br/>
up&quot; - I loved those days when my kids were small.  When everything <br/>
was an adventure, and finding jelly fish on the beach was exciting.  <br/>
Life was a wonderment (Made up word!)<br/>
<br/>
I have one dd left at home now - and I am hanging on to her childhood <br/>
for as long as I can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11465371">Oh Sue, don&#39;t cry...take my 4 yr old daughter who is driving me up the<br/>
wall!!  (I&#39;m only kidding)<br/>
It is hard to see them grow, and at the same time it is hard to live<br/>
with them!  Parenting!!!!<br/>
This doesn&#39;t make me cry, but makes me smile huge, and I will send it to<br/>
another Mom I know that struggles through daily life.  :)  But still<br/>
loves it!<br/>
<br/>
Sue, I bet your baby is a great person!!  The wonderful memories you<br/>
must have to share...not even counting the wisdom!!!!!!!!  Share the<br/>
wisdom!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742865620">um...this is me sniffling my eyes out. what a touching<br/>
piece of work. Especially since today I was not<br/>
feeling well and neither of the kiddos were either and<br/>
it was one of those &quot;could we just have a MOMENT of<br/>
quiet without whining???&quot; dayz. le sigh. Now I&#39;m going<br/>
to go lay next to them and kiss their little helpless<br/>
heads and hope they don&#39;t hold my bad mood today<br/>
against me and grow up completely tomorrow. :)<br/>
Thanks for sharing.<br/>
