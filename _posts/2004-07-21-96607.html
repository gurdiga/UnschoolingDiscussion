           I know this is not what you are really looking for, but in May I<br/>
joined a group Hogwarts Summer Correspondence School. They are a group of<br/>
homeschool moms doing things for their kids through the summer. Yes, I know<br/>
it has the word &quot;school&quot; in it. But Bj has had a lot of fun with this. The<br/>
first morning he woke up to envelopes scattered from the front door all the<br/>
way to our bed. They were from Hogwarts, some from Hagrid, some from Pro.<br/>
Dumbledore, some from Pro. Snape and all the rest of the teachers at<br/>
Hogwarts. He made a Owl post bag that we hang in a tree in our yard and at<br/>
night our owl picks it up, in the bag is things he has done in the day.<br/>
They(the owls) send more things for him to do or every flavor beans or maybe<br/>
chocolate frogs. He made Hydro vomit as one of his potions one day. He has<br/>
had a lot of fun with this. And he does only the things he wants too. As<br/>
some of this is very schooly. He gets email&#39;s from some of the teachers. <br/>
We have had alot of fun with this, and I was thinking that you might want to<br/>
check it out. <br/>
Who said,&quot; there are no witches and wizards?&quot; lol <br/>
Better look again!!!!<br/>

<br/>
I have actually thought about doing something like that.  Hogwarts classes <br/>
and such, the owl post sounds like a great start.  Thanks.<br/>
