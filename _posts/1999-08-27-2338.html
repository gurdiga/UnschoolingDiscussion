<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043114215">My dh and I have had many, many discussions on having kids with many<br/>
relatives and friends.  Most of them think we are NUTS for choosing to raise<br/>
our children ourselves.  (Of course, they also say we are nuts for<br/>
homeschooling, having eight pets and living in a house they think is too<br/>
small!!)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I do NOT understand why people have kids and then leave them in<br/>
daycare for 10+ hours a day.  This makes no sense....get them up early, drop<br/>
them at daycare, pick them up after work, stuff some dinner into them and<br/>
put them in bed.  I do NOT understand why people have kids when they do not<br/>
intend to ever be with them!!<br/>
<br/>
I believe if you choose to have children you should realize this is a HUGE<br/>
committment....both in time and energy.  I would NEVER have had kids if I<br/>
KNEW I was going to place them into someone else&#39;s hands five days a week,<br/>
10-12 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
I do realize that some families have children, intending for one parent to<br/>
be home with them....then something happens and the parents must work.  I am<br/>
not speaking of these families.  I have so many relatives that work to<br/>
supply the THINGS they WANT in their lives.  When all is said and done, it<br/>
does not matter how big your house is, how many fancy cars you have.  I<br/>
believe what matters is how you have raised your children.  If you child is<br/>
with someone for the majority of their waking hours, he/she will learn the<br/>
values of the person they are with , NOT their parents.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is pretty sad when a baby knows a caretaker better than her/his<br/>
own parents.  I have seen this over and over.....I watched a little girl for<br/>
50+ hours a week.  One weekend, I was at THEIR home for a party...the little<br/>
girl fell....she would NOT go to her parents for comfort...she came to ME.<br/>
Isn&#39;t there something wrong with that picture?  I suppose I should have been<br/>
flattered that this little one trusted me so much...but shouldn&#39;t it be her<br/>
MOTHER or FATHER that she seeks out for comfort?  Incidentally...the mom<br/>
quit her job three weeks later to be with her daughter!<br/>
<br/>
No, not everyone is cut out to be a full time mom or dad.  But I don&#39;t think<br/>
everyone is cut out to be a parent either.  I am blessed to have been able<br/>
to be home with my children for the last ten and a half years.  I am given<br/>
the full support of my husband....this is where I belong.  Never, ever,<br/>
would I give my &#39;job&#39; to someone else!!  When people ask me &quot;When are you<br/>
going to get a job?&quot;  I remind them firmly that I HAVE a job...it is just<br/>
not paid in the traditional way!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day!!<br/>

This reminds me of a wise saying I once heard and try to always remember:<br/>
What difference will it make in one hundred years....what kind of house you<br/>
lived in and what kind of cars you drove? What will make a difference in one<br/>
hundred years is your presence in the life of a child.<br/>

<br/>

living in a &quot;small&quot; house, adopting an older child, not caring about<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hear Hear!  I completely agree!  We see so many folks doing things that are<br/>
negligent, careless and downright dangerous with their children.  We just<br/>
shake our heads and sigh.  Our favorite refrain is &quot;I guess they must have<br/>
spares&quot; because the families around here tend to be large and closely<br/>
spaced.  Some people should not only not be trusted with other people&#39;s<br/>
children, but are not fit to be trusted with their own.  <br/>
<br/>
A family near here recently lost two sons (10 and 13) to a terrible<br/>
tragedy.  The boys had built a Cave/Tunnel/Hide Out in a gravel pile at a<br/>
nearby landfill and it caved in on them.  The parents say they had told the<br/>
boys &quot;again and again&quot; to stay away from there, but I had to wonder where<br/>
they thought these kids were spending all of their time.  Didn&#39;t they<br/>
wonder when they were gone for hours and hours during the afternoons<br/>
building this thing?  Didn&#39;t they keep tabs on where their kids were?  That<br/>
tunnel was not dug overnight, or even in a week.  They had it shored up and<br/>
were spending time there with another boy who escaped the collapse.  I<br/>
really feel for their loss, as I have two sons myself, but I don&#39;t<br/>
understand what they were doing with their time that was so important that<br/>
their lack of attention cost them two of their children.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll<br/>
be more careful with their remaining children (I hope.)<br/>
