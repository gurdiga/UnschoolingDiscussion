I think more often it is that their expectation was that unschooling would <br/>
&quot;work&quot; in the sense that kids would choose, on their own, to learn what <br/>
schooled kids are being taught - on approximately the same timetable. <br/>
Reality is that our unschooled kids do NOT do that - they sometimes learn <br/>
things WAY  later or not at all - and that feels like &quot;not working&quot; and <br/>
they give up on unschooling. We who consider it an overwhelming success in <br/>
our families - see other &quot;lessons&quot; learned (how to direct ones own <br/>
learning/life, for example) as more significant than much of the content of <br/>
a school curriculum. Our criteria for success are different.<br/>
<br/>
My niece is 16 and in public school where she gets mostly A&#39;s and is in the <br/>
gifted program. She said she&#39;d been working on a project for her history <br/>
class - about the French revolution. I asked her what she thought was <br/>
important about it - why would they be studying about it? She had no clue, <br/>
but she could list the chapter headings in her textbook.<br/>
<br/>
So - my kids know a lot about the French revolution - their interest comes <br/>
from their love of the musical, &quot;Les Miserables.&quot; Roxana read the book <br/>
itself, several times (if you haven&#39;t read it - it includes a LOT of <br/>
political stuff). That background gave her the ability to pick up a lot <br/>
more just from stuff that appeared before her. She knows much more about it <br/>
than I do. So - just because I felt like it - I asked her why SHE thought <br/>
that it was important to study the French revolution. Her first answer was, <br/>
&quot;Well - I could just talk about why history is important - as in how we <br/>
need to learn from it in order not to repeat it, but I guess you were <br/>
asking more specifically about this one part of history?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; I <br/>
answered. She went on to think aloud about what made this particular bit of <br/>
history especially important - she speculated on its impact on western <br/>
europe in general, on the spreading of ideas of democracy and freedom for <br/>
nonaristocrats, and perhaps influencing the eventual ideas of communism and <br/>
so on.  What struck me was that she was THINKING about it - as opposed to <br/>
just trying to &quot;remember and repeat&quot; what she&#39;d been told by her <br/>
teacher/textbook. That THINKING is one of the goals of unschooling, imo, <br/>
and so what I saw looked like &quot;success&quot; to me. Some people might have seen <br/>
her inability to list the major events of the French revolution, in correct <br/>
chronological order and naming exactly where they took place, as a failure.<br/>
<br/>
I think some people DO think that unschooling is failing when their kids <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;keep up&quot; or learn the school content curriculum by their own choice.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I think some people DO think that unschooling is failing when their kids <br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s under the category of &quot;didn&#39;t trust that it would work,&quot; but <br/>
Pam&#39;s right--there&#39;s a prior level of lack-of-understanding where the parents <br/>
might not even loosen up enough to realize that unschooling for fifteen years <br/>
will produce a child who knows fifteen years worth of stuff which will be a <br/>
larger body of knowledge than a kid who spent that time in school, but it <br/>
will not be the same body of knowledge.  And ANYone who thinks learning (or <br/>
anything else) happens on a smooth curve hasn&#39;t charted many things!<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were watching Liberty&#39;s Kids the other day, and Benjamin Franklin <br/>
was in France, where there was talk of the unrest there.  I told Holly they <br/>
had a revolution right after ours.  She already knew.<br/>

As I was reading, and enjoying, my inner grump was muttering &quot;Schools<br/>
don&#39;t encourage thinking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I stopped and thought a few seconds more and realized that it&#39;s not<br/>
so much the *institution* of school but the *practice* of testing and<br/>
quantifying that REALLY discourages thinking.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Right answers&quot;, bah, humbug.<br/>

PS  (My husband has only been teaching for two weeks so far this<br/>
semester, but I know from what he tells me that he&#39;s already referenced<br/>
Les Miserables AND the Santyana quote about repeating the past.  Maybe<br/>
I&#39;ve been spending so much time on the list that all you guys best ideas<br/>
are starting to ooze out of my pores.  Creepy!&lt;g&gt;)</div>
