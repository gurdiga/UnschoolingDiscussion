<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019330233">I don&#39;t remember off hand if anyone on list is from NC, but I have a question.  We<br/>
are now living in NJ and this is the 2nd year I&#39;ve been hs&#39;g my 7ds & 9ds.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t call myself a &quot;pure&quot; unschooler, but probably just about there! :)  NJ has<br/>
wonderful laws - basically none!  We must provide &quot;equivalent&quot; instruction, but<br/>
there are no mandatory tests, records, etc.  Wonderful!  I read that NC requires 9<br/>
mos of school and annual standard testing with results ready to be shown at any<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any unschoolers here in NC that are not doing that?  Is it enforced<br/>
strictly?  We&#39;re thinking of the Charlotte area - are there any/many groups in that<br/>
part of the state?  I&#39;ve looked at asst&#39;d links online, but thought maybe locals<br/>
would know of details not readily available on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any info!<br/>

We have lived in NC for about 5 years.  The law isn&#39;t hard to follow.  There <br/>
are requirements and suggestions.  Many get those confused.  You are required <br/>
to keep attendance forms (sheet with places to make checkmarks provided by <br/>
the dep&#39;t of nonpublic education), immunizations on file (or the form saying <br/>
you are exempt), and to take a nationally standardized test once a year.  <br/>
They ask for copies of the test results and attendance be sent in every few <br/>
years if they ask.  It sounds worse than it is.  Many people use the Sylvan <br/>
test at home on their computer, or get the Hewitt test and self administer.  <br/>
You might end up with a support group that wants you to follow all the <br/>
suggestions, (such as school for x number of hours in the mornings and have <br/>
someone else administer the tests) but these are not requirements.  There are <br/>
no minimum scores required for the tests.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the visible hsers I&#39;ve met are affiliated with a church group.  I <br/>
found a network of loosely affiliated families that do some activities <br/>
together.  But we aren&#39;t tightly organized.  You might want to check out the <br/>
egroup lists for the NCLOOP and the NCSecular for info about local groups.  <br/>
There is a state group NCHE that seems to be tied somewhat to HSLDA and <br/>
another state group called FLT Families Learning Together that seems to have <br/>
at least several unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on where you move to in the Charlotte area you may experience some <br/>
cultural difference from NJ.  Spring and fall are beautiful times of year <br/>
here.  And they last longer than they do in NJ.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212944407">I have a friend who lives in NC that is an unschooler and here is what she<br/>
said about NC.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda<br/>
<br/>
NC requires that an annual recognized test be administered (such as Iowa,<br/>
CAT) *but* many parents administer that test themselves and are quite lax<br/>
about stringent time limits, etc.  Further, in my 9 yrs of hsing, I&#39;ve never<br/>
been interviewed, asked for the test results (they only require that you<br/>
ADMINISTER the test... not provide them with the details!). We&#39;re required<br/>
to keep an &quot;attendance record&quot; (what a JOKE!) which they may ask to see, but<br/>
*their* form that they provide for this is simply a basic calendar where you<br/>
check off the days that you&#39;ve &quot;had school&quot; (which imo is open to<br/>
interpretation!).  You *do* have to have 180 days of &quot;school&quot; but again....<br/>
what &quot;school&quot; is is open to interpretation!.<br/>
Tell your friend we&#39;re unschoolers (completely) and we don&#39;t have a single<br/>
problem. If you can &quot;x&quot; out 180 days on a calendar, pay $25 per kid to order<br/>
a test (and do with it as you please), you&#39;re in business around here. I&#39;m<br/>
in Winston-Salem but same holds true for the Charlotte area. Also, tell you<br/>
friend that NC is heavily populated with the Christian Fundamentalist<br/>
Homeschoolers and that she may find herself hard-pressed for friends to hang<br/>
out with her kids. That&#39;s the BIGGEST complaint I hear over and over again.<br/>
She can write me if she&#39;d like.... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:puddles@...">puddles@...</a></div>
