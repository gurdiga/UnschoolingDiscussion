<div id="ygrps-yiv-437691580">Hi Jodye,<br/>
I really liked your posting and found myself sitting in front of the screen<br/>
nodding as I read! LOL By the way, my first child flat out refused to nurse<br/>
from my left breast so feeling terribly wicked I simply fed her from the<br/>
right one all the time!! I didn&#39;t dare tell anyone but hey, it worked! She<br/>
nursed until about a year and thrived.<br/>
Recently a friend had the same issue with her 11 month old boy refusing one<br/>
breast and she too merely began feeding him solely from the other - no harm<br/>
done! Just a thought for next time maybe? (((hugs)))<br/>
<br/>
Namaste<br/>
