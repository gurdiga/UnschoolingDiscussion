<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317878311">Hi all, I need some encouragement.<br/>
I have 3 children 8 and 10 and 22 (gone from the nest.)<br/>
Our homeschooling experience has been the first on and off in and out of<br/>
school. second unschool until end of first grade when 4 buddies moved away<br/>
and he was very lonely. We sent hime to the local Waldrof school. His siter<br/>
followed in k the following year and I taught music there. after two years<br/>
we decided the school was a challenging community to be part of in many<br/>
ways. Last year I stated homeschooling. We did fun projects and story<br/>
lessons and feild trips on north american indians of our area. that was fun<br/>
for about 2 months. but it got old the kids said we don&#39;t really want to do<br/>
this can we just do our own thing. I said great. From then to mid sept they<br/>
did what they liked. Abbie has taught herself the piano is doing<br/>
scrapbooking, in gymnastics, swimming dog 4h and sometimes reads a little<br/>
but she is at go dog go level. She is very tenacious and likes to challenge<br/>
herself. I feel comfortable unschooling her because she does stuff that is<br/>
recognizable learning. Nikolas on the other hand hangs out rides his bike<br/>
reads harry potter for the eigthieth time  does his chores sometimes and has<br/>
gone through his bank account of sixty dollars on candy. This year i decided<br/>
to do structured school with him using oak meadow 5th grade. he seemed to be<br/>
needing some structure because he was always upset and tense and seemed to<br/>
be asking for something but I wasn&#39;t sure what. well he doesn&#39;t like it, not<br/>
at all. I am doing a lot of nagging on everything and restricting him if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t do his work. (I know y&#39;all are cringing. He often has tantrums and<br/>
is very reclcitrant. Yet when he finally does begin his work 90% of the time<br/>
he likes it is proud and says he likes doing it as says he wished he hadn&#39;t<br/>
put up a fuss. but he almost always balks the next time. The reason I chose<br/>
to be structured woth him is to give him a chance to work hard at something<br/>
and stay with it. he avoids complicated projects, work, thinking etc. Or<br/>
this is the waty he seems to me. He likes to be very comfotable  and know<br/>
something well before he might risk tryng something new. which happens only<br/>
at urging. Anyway in my heart I am a true unschooler and would like to give<br/>
hime the chance to follow something. Everytime drop academis expectations I<br/>
get panicky he just hangs out in his room or on his bike and I don&#39;t even<br/>
see him. He is not interested in doing projects with abbie and I. Can<br/>
someone help talk me to me more about this. My head says he should be my<br/>
heart says  let go of those academic expectations. ( he reads well and is<br/>
good at math already) I hope this is not to long a diatribe. YOu all seem so<br/>
comfotable hanging out and following your kids leads. I can do that with<br/>
abbie because she is so curious but nikolas has me stumped. Hubby also<br/>
thinks work is very important. tahnk you for listening<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842302980">Hi Josie!!! I have a 7 yr old who also just eats up anything he can get his hands or eyes on! I&#39;m extremely comfortable because I see him learning every day! My 5 yr old son, however, still does not even recgonize his letters. He doesn&#39;t know how to tie shoes, he doesn&#39;t know how to spread peanut butter on a piece of bread. He is lazy - does not want to try anything new that might take effort. His favorite sayings are &quot;it&#39;s too hard&quot; and &quot;I can&#39;t&quot;.  I offer to include him with whatever we&#39;re doing, and let it go if he&#39;s not interested. When we go places, I ask him to let me know if he sees anything he&#39;d like to know more about, and he never does. I worry about him, but since he&#39;s still so young I try not to. No matter what though, I&#39;ve found out, mom&#39;s are going to worry! Just let go, try to relax, and if he still hasn&#39;t decided he wants to do anything by college-age, then you can worry!

 </span></blockquote>A five year old doesn&#39;t need to recognize letters.  They are not allowed<br/>
to be home alone, they are not allowed to drive, have a job, vote.  The<br/>
only reason a five year old would NEED to recognize letters is if he was<br/>
in school and it was an inconvenience to his teacher for him not to.  <br/>
<br/>
Buy Velcro shoes.  Or tie them for him.  <br/>
<br/>
Make his sandwich for him, or show him how ten times if he wants you to. <br/>
We understand that learning to walk and talk takes time but we think<br/>
other skills are supposed to be automatic.  Some people need to see a<br/>
thing many times before they understand it.  Some people need help with<br/>
the doing for a long time before they&#39;re ready to do it on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if you never say lazy in front of him he will know that&#39;s what you<br/>
think of him.  That can&#39;t help him be a better person and it doesn&#39;t make<br/>
you look like a better mom in his eyes.  It&#39;s only going to hurt, and<br/>
hurt in a way that will last his whole life and you can&#39;t really want<br/>
that for your little man.  That&#39;s really, really harsh, and not a nice<br/>
way to talk about someone who needs your loving attention.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe things really are too hard.  Not every five year old is ready for<br/>
this stuff.  You have a little baby don&#39;t you?   Has your five year old<br/>
been expected to do more for himself since the baby came?   He must seem<br/>
like a big boy to you compared to the little one, but five is very small.<br/>
 Very, very small, and maybe he&#39;s overwhelmed.   Maybe he&#39;d like to be<br/>
your little baby again.  You could baby him some and he will grow<br/>
happily.   When people feel good about themselves they can accomplish<br/>
much more than people who feel, and have heard, that they can&#39;t do<br/>
anything and they&#39;re lazy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-654144218">How about unmotivated? Unmotivated gets the adult thinking about what <br/>
the problem could be and what they could do to motivate the child. <br/>
<br/>
Lazy is such an ugly label that usually says more about the person <br/>
saying it than the one it is attached to.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re feeling a bit lazy (fill in stressed out, over-whelmed, <br/>
needy) with all the youngsters so that you aren&#39;t able to provide the <br/>
right kind of encouragement that fits *his* needs? See what I mean? <br/>
The label &quot;Lazy&quot; just gets in the way of getting to a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Kids do things at different times and see things and life in different <br/>
ways from their parents. Half the fun of being a parent is figuring <br/>
out the unique abililies and ways of seeing the world that our <br/>
children have. Negative labels limit both parents and children, they <br/>
get in the way of solutions and they hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I didn&#39;t hear plenty of those ugly labels when I was a child. <br/>
I have to consciously *not* use them with my own children. And, by <br/>
doing so, I&#39;ve managed to heal some of the pain those labels caused me <br/>
when I was a child. And, the more I practice not using them, the <br/>
easier it gets. We can reprogram those negative tapes that play in our <br/>
heads, and sometimes we don&#39;t even realize are there, until we hear <br/>
our parent&#39;s negative words coming out of our mouths directed at our <br/>
own children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374575477">Ok, Ok,  lets remember that we are all learning.<br/>
I used to think the same thing about my son, because he wouldn&#39;t get up to do a whole lot, but I really, really thought alot about it.   I really think I had been so hard on him for his first years that he didn&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m trying to be much more accepting and just be understanding and loving.  I also have a 5 yr old and she kind-of recognizes her letters and she doesn&#39;t tie her shoes, and you know what, it doesn&#39;t matter.  They will learn when they learn.  I have to keep telling myself that they grow up sooo fast and what&#39;s the big deal to just help her with things, she&#39;s only 5!!!      And even my son who is 9 is still only 9!  It is still so young. <br/>
We expect so much from our children at such young ages, we don&#39;t allow them to be kids.  My son is just now willing to try things because I have been laying off him for the last 6 months or so.  For so long I&#39;m sure I just would do everything for him and not encourage him or anything.  If I were him I wouldn&#39;t do anything either, I would be &#39;lazy&#39; too.<br/>
Looking at our children in different ways really opens eyes. Look at them as individuals give them respect like you or I  would want.   Regarding encouragement---Relax and have fun!  And you know what before you know it that &#39;lazy&#39; kid will be doing everything with you.  And life will be good.   (I miss Mary!  Where is she?)<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like you are very comfortable with your daughter and how she <br/>
unschools herself. That&#39;s great when you have a kid like that, especially <br/>
when just starting out. Makes it so much easier to trust them and you, <br/>
right? But alas, not all kids will be that easy for you to be that <br/>
comfortable right away.<br/>
<br/>
Now your son that you are concerned about, is he the 10 year old one? I ask <br/>
in great disbelief because to me 10 is well, just so darn young. Some kids <br/>
aren&#39;t even reading at that age let alone doing math. He was in and out of <br/>
school and also &#39;doing school&#39; at home too right? How long did you just let <br/>
him be to deschool? Doesn&#39;t sound like it was long enough to me. You started <br/>
to freak a little and think he &#39;needed&#39; structure. Well it doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
like that is working either.<br/>
<br/>
If you ask me, I would just let him play and don&#39;t worry about suggesting <br/>
any kind of busy work for him. Still nothing wrong with asking him what he <br/>
would like to do though and if he is the one who suggests something <br/>
structured, that&#39;s a different story. Just him balking at it suggests to me <br/>
it&#39;s doing him no good though, no matter what he says afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
I say let them both do what they need to do right now, no matter how <br/>
educational it seems or not. Two totally different kids with different <br/>
methods of living and learning. I think if you can relax and just sit back <br/>
from afar, given enough time for your son, you&#39;ll see it all working out.<br/>
<br/>
Now your husband is a different story!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281009799">OK, I think ya&#39;ll may have misunderstood me since I was typing so quickly. I&#39;m not expecting him to know these things, just stating that he doesn&#39;t, as opposed to his brother who was eager to learn and could do these things by age 3. He does have velcro, or just slip-on shoes, I do make his sandwiches and either me or big brother does most everything else for him. I don&#39;t call him lazy, we don&#39;t even use that word, he&#39;s just very fondly nicknamed our little lazybones and has been since he was about 8 mths old. Brett&#39;s our silly goosey, we use both nicknames the same. Oh, and he still gets the exact same treatment from us as he did before we had the baby. Heck, I still look at my oldest son as a baby! He tells me all the time to stop babying him. <br/>
Sorry for the misunderstandings, I&#39;ll try to remember to save the posting for when I have longer to re-read over what I typed!!!<br/>

  Very, very small, and maybe he&#39;s overwhelmed.   Maybe he&#39;d like to be<br/>
  your little baby again.  You could baby him some and he will grow<br/>
  happily.   When people feel good about themselves they can accomplish<br/>
  much more than people who feel, and have heard, that they can&#39;t do<br/>
  anything and they&#39;re lazy.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-320037311">I guess some people would/could see &quot;lazy&quot; as a negative word, but we don&#39;t. Neither DH or I grew up hearing that word used, and we use it only, like I said, as a fond nickname &quot;lazybones&quot;, and we have &quot;lazy Sunday&#39;s&quot; about once a month when we eat leftovers all day, watch tv, read, or play games all day, and just enjoy being with each other - we don&#39;t do a single thing we don&#39;t feel like doing (well, except for feeding the animals). Sometimes on our lazy days we&#39;ll go to the beach or a park and just sit and watch the clouds and people go by. Lazy, to us, is a warm-fuzzy-snuggly-type word used more to describe a just-wanna-take-it-easy mood or day. <br/>
Myranda<br/>
<br/>
  How about unmotivated? Unmotivated gets the adult thinking about what <br/>
  the problem could be and what they could do to motivate the child. <br/>
<br/>
  Lazy is such an ugly label that usually says more about the person <br/>
  saying it than the one it is attached to.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe you&#39;re feeling a bit lazy (fill in stressed out, over-whelmed, <br/>
  needy) with all the youngsters so that you aren&#39;t able to provide the <br/>
  right kind of encouragement that fits *his* needs? See what I mean? <br/>
  The label &quot;Lazy&quot; just gets in the way of getting to a solution.<br/>
<br/>
  Kids do things at different times and see things and life in different <br/>
  ways from their parents. Half the fun of being a parent is figuring <br/>
  out the unique abililies and ways of seeing the world that our <br/>
  children have. Negative labels limit both parents and children, they <br/>
  get in the way of solutions and they hurt.<br/>
<br/>
  Not that I didn&#39;t hear plenty of those ugly labels when I was a child. <br/>
  I have to consciously *not* use them with my own children. And, by <br/>
  doing so, I&#39;ve managed to heal some of the pain those labels caused me <br/>
  when I was a child. And, the more I practice not using them, the <br/>
  easier it gets. We can reprogram those negative tapes that play in our <br/>
  heads, and sometimes we don&#39;t even realize are there, until we hear <br/>
  our parent&#39;s negative words coming out of our mouths directed at our <br/>
  own children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117683631">No objections there! I&#39;ve never done more than ask if they want to do something, or offer it up as an option, to either one of the boys. My oldest jumps at the chance, while the youngest doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s fine with me. :-)<br/>
Myranda<br/>
  Ok, Ok,  lets remember that we are all learning.<br/>
  I used to think the same thing about my son, because he wouldn&#39;t get up to do a whole lot, but I really, really thought alot about it.   I really think I had been so hard on him for his first years that he didn&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m trying to be much more accepting and just be understanding and loving.  I also have a 5 yr old and she kind-of recognizes her letters and she doesn&#39;t tie her shoes, and you know what, it doesn&#39;t matter.  They will learn when they learn.  I have to keep telling myself that they grow up sooo fast and what&#39;s the big deal to just help her with things, she&#39;s only 5!!!      And even my son who is 9 is still only 9!  It is still so young. <br/>
  We expect so much from our children at such young ages, we don&#39;t allow them to be kids.  My son is just now willing to try things because I have been laying off him for the last 6 months or so.  For so long I&#39;m sure I just would do everything for him and not encourage him or anything.  If I were him I wouldn&#39;t do anything either, I would be &#39;lazy&#39; too.<br/>
  Looking at our children in different ways really opens eyes. Look at them as individuals give them respect like you or I  would want.   Regarding encouragement---Relax and have fun!  And you know what before you know it that &#39;lazy&#39; kid will be doing everything with you.  And life will be good.   (I miss Mary!  Where is she?)<br/>
  Take Care,<br/>

<br/>
Okay, I certainly don&#39;t want to overwhelm you because I think you may get a <br/>
bit of response on this one. But I do have to say &#39;something.&#39; And only <br/>
because the way you put it sounds as if deep down inside, it does bother <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
So I think what really helps is not just to have people say stop worrying. <br/>
That NEVER works for me. But maybe just hearing that we all have kids or <br/>
know kids like that and they are fine and productive and loving and caring <br/>
and smart, will help.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you never say what you said on list to your son, he&#39;s going to get <br/>
that idea from you. Trust me on this one, he will. My Sierra, who is almost <br/>
7 in a few months, was very quiet when she was younger when it came to being <br/>
around new people or even family she wasn&#39;t familiar with that much. She was <br/>
labeled shy of course. I tried very hard to not have people say that around <br/>
her and never used it myself out loud, point was I was thinking it cause <br/>
what other way could I explain it? Well why should I have to explain it????? <br/>
She obviously wasn&#39;t ready for whatever it was everyone else thought she <br/>
should do. I relaxed and eased way up and never made excuses for her, I just <br/>
let her be. She&#39;s a darn bubbly little thing now who&#39;s has loud and screamy <br/>
(in a happy way) than any other kid I know.<br/>
<br/>
My Joseph, almost 8 in a few months, was never one to be with us as a <br/>
family. We would rent a movie for family night and he would never make it <br/>
even half way through. He would get up and go to his room to play. When we <br/>
would all play inside, he would go outside. When we would play ball ouside, <br/>
he would leave and go to his room. It was so obvious that it really started <br/>
to bother me that there was a problem. Thank God my husband picks up that <br/>
unschooly behavior when I sometimes faulter!!! He said to let him be, he was <br/>
fine, he needed his own time right now and it was no big deal. Although we <br/>
both were bothered that he wouldn&#39;t be with us.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short, somewhat, he&#39;s fine now and very involved in whatever we <br/>
all do. He still needs his time alone and we give it to him now just as we <br/>
did before. He just learned by the way to tie his bathing suit this year. He <br/>
has velcro sneakers!!!<br/>
<br/>
Relax and realize that these are our babies yet and so very young at the <br/>
ages most of us are speaking of. Believe me when they are 16, you will <br/>
wonder where all the years went and want that little couch potatoe candy <br/>
eating crying for mommy little rug rat back. Enjoy each day for each day and <br/>
watch and learn right along with them. They will grow and learn and blossom <br/>
before you know it. Don&#39;t rush, don&#39;t judge and don&#39;t label. It really does <br/>
more harm than good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Myranda!!! Your little guy isn&#39;t lazy, he is 5! Jack is almost 6.5 and he <br/>
still can&#39;t tie his shoes either. Moly learned to tie hers in one day when <br/>
she was just turned 4. A friend of ours was teaching her 6yo dd and Moly just <br/>
sat a watched. When she came home that night she *just knew how* Jack can&#39;t <br/>
make a pb sandwich either. And many times he says something is *too hard* as <br/>
well. It probably is too hard. Whenever his Dad tries to help him with tying <br/>
shoes, Jack says *I can&#39;t* and I believe him. I doubt his little hands are <br/>
coordinated enough for it yet. Darin says if he can play video games as well <br/>
as he does, he should be able to tie shoes. I don&#39;t agree. But I want to <br/>
issue a gentle, loving warning to you, comparing your children can be <br/>
dangerous. What one does at 4, another might not be able to or be ready to do <br/>
at 6. Its all apples and oranges. And calling them lazy (even if you just do <br/>
it in writing, you must think it and if you think it, your kids will pick up <br/>
on it. Even if you never say it.) <br/>

deschooling myself and at 39 it&#39;s still an ongoing process. <br/>

I really think hanging out and riding a bike and reading Harry Potter<br/>
again and spending money the way one likes is much more &quot;educational&quot;<br/>
than sitting down to geography lessons or any other school work. <br/>
Especially if your ten.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there has been a lot of change and indecision at your<br/>
house, what with school and unschooling and curriculums and such.  I know<br/>
my own ten year old is like a living emotions receptor.   He can sense<br/>
any discomfort, stress, uncertainty and the like in the family.  Maybe<br/>
your son is having a hard time understanding what it is he wants because<br/>
you&#39;re not certain yourself.   It&#39;s hard to feel good about yourself when<br/>
you&#39;re little if you think your mom&#39;s unhappy with you, no matter what<br/>
you do.  Make sure, first thing, that he knows the stuff he likes to do<br/>
is ok with you.  And then work hard deschooling yourself.  He will be<br/>
able to sense your disapproval and anxiety and it will affect the way he<br/>
interacts with your family.   Try to find something positive in what he&#39;s<br/>
doing.   If the only thing you can find is that it makes him happy, let<br/>
that warm your heart.  Happy is wonderful.<br/>
  <br/>
I would have a heart to heart with him.  Tell him you think he&#39;s<br/>
wonderful and that you want to try this weird  thing called unschooling. <br/>
Tell him there are people in the world who believe playing Gameboy and<br/>
riding bikes and hanging out are better than any thing he could do at<br/>
school, and that you want to be one of these wacky people.  Explain it<br/>
might take time for everyone in the family to get really comfortable<br/>
with, especially him.  Let him know you&#39;ll help him do the things he<br/>
discovers he wants to.   <br/>
<br/>
This could be such a cool family adventure.  Your son sounds just right<br/>
to me.  When you start feeling better about unschooling he will too.  <br/>
<br/>
I would definitely stop the curriculum and the nagging and the<br/>
restrictions.&lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s a good place to start unschooling.  Think about<br/>
what he really likes and find a way to let him do it.  Find a way to be<br/>
happy with who he is.<br/>

you can find is that it makes him happy, let that warm your heart.  Happy is <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I would have a heart to heart with him.  Tell him you think he&#39;s<br/>
wonderful and that you want to try this weird  thing called unschooling. <br/>
Tell him there are people in the world who believe playing Gameboy and <br/>
riding bikes and hanging out are better than any thing he could do at <br/>
school, and that you want to be one of these wacky people.  Explain it might <br/>
take time for everyone in the family to get really comfortable with, <br/>
especially him.  Let him know you&#39;ll help him do the things he discovers he <br/>
wants to.<br/>
<br/>
This could be such a cool family adventure.  Your son sounds just right<br/>
to me.  When you start feeling better about unschooling he will too.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely stop the curriculum and the nagging and the<br/>
restrictions.&lt;g&gt;  That&#39;s a good place to start unschooling.  Think about<br/>
what he really likes and find a way to let him do it.  Find a way to be<br/>
happy with who he is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list before just recently and I have to say that I think <br/>
this is one of the best posts I have ever read. Plain and simply said with <br/>
no I can write a book jargon. Especially the part about a kid feeling good <br/>
about themselves if they think the parent isn&#39;t happy with them. I&#39;m <br/>
printing this out for my husband. (not too much to read!) He&#39;s a great guy <br/>
and a great dad but sometimes just a little harder on the kids than I want.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Deb. this is good.<br/>

There&#39;s no fondness, really, in such insults. <br/>
<br/>
My sister was called &quot;Cow&quot; by  my mother many times, and not lovingly.  She <br/>
said it because my sister would be the last to get in the car and the last to <br/>
get out.  Sometimes the last to come into the house on a cold day.  &quot;Hurry <br/>
up, COW!&quot; she would say.<br/>
<br/>
My mother had been called &quot;Goose&quot; by her own parents.<br/>
<br/>
I call my daughter &quot;Holly&quot; and tell her I love her, and to take her time.<br/>
<br/>
Names stick.<br/>
&quot;Lazy&quot; isn&#39;t nice and can&#39;t be made nice by smiling or by saying &quot;I&#39;m saying <br/>
this because I like you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, lazy because he&#39;d rather miss a meal than have to actually get up and <br/>
walk to the table. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to be at the table with people who are calling him <br/>
lazy.  I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If food is important, take it to him where he is!  Maybe take yours too!  <br/>
Or pick him up and hug him and say you want to eat with him and carry him to <br/>
the table.<br/>
Or get him to help you finish up the meal and garnish and present.<br/>
Or go out.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t call him lazy.<br/>

Listen... how labeling (&quot;he&#39;s our little lazybones&quot;), even lovingly, our <br/>
kids can really set them up for filling roles rather than just Being Who <br/>
They Are.  If you can get a copy of that book from the library, I think you <br/>
will really enjoy reading that section!  It&#39;s an eye-opener!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;recgonize&quot; but when speed-typing with a baby standing up by pulling on <br/>
&gt;your hair, you tend to not be as particular about wording. &lt;g&gt;   Oh, he <br/>
&gt;has learned to recgonize and spell his name this last month, so I am <br/>
&gt;thankful for that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would also suggest (I haven&#39;t read all the other answers yet, and someone <br/>
else may have said these things, probably much more eloquently) that you <br/>
take a look at how you may be pushing him to do things on your clock rather <br/>
than his clock.  We all do the things *we* need to do when *we* see the <br/>
need to do them.  He may just enjoy sitting there doing nothing but being <br/>
with his own thoughts and feelings.  How delightful it is to have the space <br/>
to do that.  Recognizing letters and spelling your name is something you <br/>
have to see the need for before you want to learn to do it.  If he feels <br/>
rushed or pushed into learning things he may not be getting the freedom to <br/>
learn things from his own internal desire.  There&#39;s a huge difference I think.<br/>

&gt;any discomfort, stress, uncertainty and the like in the family.  Maybe<br/>
&gt;your son is having a hard time understanding what it is he wants because<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re not certain yourself.   It&#39;s hard to feel good about yourself when<br/>

&gt;able to sense your disapproval and anxiety and it will affect the way he<br/>
&gt;interacts with your family.   Try to find something positive in what he&#39;s<br/>

  Okay, I certainly don&#39;t want to overwhelm you because I think you may get a <br/>
  bit of response on this one. But I do have to say &#39;something.&#39; And only <br/>
  because the way you put it sounds as if deep down inside, it does bother <br/>
  you.<br/>
<br/>
  So I think what really helps is not just to have people say stop worrying. <br/>
  That NEVER works for me. But maybe just hearing that we all have kids or <br/>
  know kids like that and they are fine and productive and loving and caring <br/>
  and smart, will help.<br/>
<br/>
  Even if you never say what you said on list to your son, he&#39;s going to get <br/>
  that idea from you. Trust me on this one, he will. My Sierra, who is almost <br/>
  7 in a few months, was very quiet when she was younger when it came to being <br/>
  around new people or even family she wasn&#39;t familiar with that much. She was <br/>
  labeled shy of course. I tried very hard to not have people say that around <br/>
  her and never used it myself out loud, point was I was thinking it cause <br/>
  what other way could I explain it? Well why should I have to explain it????? <br/>
  She obviously wasn&#39;t ready for whatever it was everyone else thought she <br/>
  should do. I relaxed and eased way up and never made excuses for her, I just <br/>
  let her be. She&#39;s a darn bubbly little thing now who&#39;s has loud and screamy <br/>
  (in a happy way) than any other kid I know.<br/>
<br/>
  My Joseph, almost 8 in a few months, was never one to be with us as a <br/>
  family. We would rent a movie for family night and he would never make it <br/>
  even half way through. He would get up and go to his room to play. When we <br/>
  would all play inside, he would go outside. When we would play ball ouside, <br/>
  he would leave and go to his room. It was so obvious that it really started <br/>
  to bother me that there was a problem. Thank God my husband picks up that <br/>
  unschooly behavior when I sometimes faulter!!! He said to let him be, he was <br/>
  fine, he needed his own time right now and it was no big deal. Although we <br/>
  both were bothered that he wouldn&#39;t be with us.<br/>
<br/>
  Long story short, somewhat, he&#39;s fine now and very involved in whatever we <br/>
  all do. He still needs his time alone and we give it to him now just as we <br/>
  did before. He just learned by the way to tie his bathing suit this year. He <br/>
  has velcro sneakers!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Relax and realize that these are our babies yet and so very young at the <br/>
  ages most of us are speaking of. Believe me when they are 16, you will <br/>
  wonder where all the years went and want that little couch potatoe candy <br/>
  eating crying for mommy little rug rat back. Enjoy each day for each day and <br/>
  watch and learn right along with them. They will grow and learn and blossom <br/>
  before you know it. Don&#39;t rush, don&#39;t judge and don&#39;t label. It really does <br/>
  more harm than good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603800419">My suggestion to you would be to get yourself over to FUNbooks.com (no I am not affiliated, just a thrilled customer) and order the Living is Learning guide for his age group, they are about $13 and worth 10 times that. I have the PreK, K and 1st grade one, and boy has it let me breathe easier *S*<br/>
There are lists,of what is typically &quot;expected&quot; in school of children this age, along with all the things that can fill these requirements, making it easier for you if you need to report to your state, and then lists of all kinds of things they can use to gain these skills as well, like games, books, videos, places to go etc. <br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] I need LOTS of encooouragement<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Hi all, I need some encouragement.<br/>
  I have 3 children 8 and 10 and 22 (gone from the nest.)<br/>
  Our homeschooling experience has been the first on and off in and out of<br/>
  school. second unschool until end of first grade when 4 buddies moved away<br/>
  and he was very lonely. We sent hime to the local Waldrof school. His siter<br/>
  followed in k the following year and I taught music there. after two years<br/>
  we decided the school was a challenging community to be part of in many<br/>
  ways. Last year I stated homeschooling. We did fun projects and story<br/>
  lessons and feild trips on north american indians of our area. that was fun<br/>
  for about 2 months. but it got old the kids said we don&#39;t really want to do<br/>
  this can we just do our own thing. I said great. From then to mid sept they<br/>
  did what they liked. Abbie has taught herself the piano is doing<br/>
  scrapbooking, in gymnastics, swimming dog 4h and sometimes reads a little<br/>
  but she is at go dog go level. She is very tenacious and likes to challenge<br/>
  herself. I feel comfortable unschooling her because she does stuff that is<br/>
  recognizable learning. Nikolas on the other hand hangs out rides his bike<br/>
  reads harry potter for the eigthieth time  does his chores sometimes and has<br/>
  gone through his bank account of sixty dollars on candy. This year i decided<br/>
  to do structured school with him using oak meadow 5th grade. he seemed to be<br/>
  needing some structure because he was always upset and tense and seemed to<br/>
  be asking for something but I wasn&#39;t sure what. well he doesn&#39;t like it, not<br/>
  at all. I am doing a lot of nagging on everything and restricting him if he<br/>
  doesn&#39;t do his work. (I know y&#39;all are cringing. He often has tantrums and<br/>
  is very reclcitrant. Yet when he finally does begin his work 90% of the time<br/>
  he likes it is proud and says he likes doing it as says he wished he hadn&#39;t<br/>
  put up a fuss. but he almost always balks the next time. The reason I chose<br/>
  to be structured woth him is to give him a chance to work hard at something<br/>
  and stay with it. he avoids complicated projects, work, thinking etc. Or<br/>
  this is the waty he seems to me. He likes to be very comfotable  and know<br/>
  something well before he might risk tryng something new. which happens only<br/>
  at urging. Anyway in my heart I am a true unschooler and would like to give<br/>
  hime the chance to follow something. Everytime drop academis expectations I<br/>
  get panicky he just hangs out in his room or on his bike and I don&#39;t even<br/>
  see him. He is not interested in doing projects with abbie and I. Can<br/>
  someone help talk me to me more about this. My head says he should be my<br/>
  heart says  let go of those academic expectations. ( he reads well and is<br/>
  good at math already) I hope this is not to long a diatribe. YOu all seem so<br/>
  comfotable hanging out and following your kids leads. I can do that with<br/>
  abbie because she is so curious but nikolas has me stumped. Hubby also<br/>
  thinks work is very important. tahnk you for listening<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150021038">OK.... if you think lazy is a word to describe:&quot;a just-wanna-take-it-easy<br/>

doing things he does not want to do, when you yourself say he is a<br/>
lazybones, which to me says he is a laid back kid who does only what he<br/>
wants to and not what you feel he should be doing? By your definition you<br/>
are saying he is the kind of kid who does not do things he feels pressured<br/>
to do...maybe he is just enjoying being!<br/>
I still don&#39;t like the &quot;name&quot; but *sheesh* by your very definition of the<br/>

I guess some people would/could see &quot;lazy&quot; as a negative word, but we don&#39;t.<br/>
Neither DH or I grew up hearing that word used, and we use it only, like I<br/>
said, as a fond nickname &quot;lazybones&quot;, and we have &quot;lazy Sunday&#39;s&quot; about once<br/>
a month when we eat leftovers all day, watch tv, read, or play games all<br/>
day, and just enjoy being with each other - we don&#39;t do a single thing we<br/>
don&#39;t feel like doing (well, except for feeding the animals). Sometimes on<br/>
our lazy days we&#39;ll go to the beach or a park and just sit and watch the<br/>
clouds and people go by. Lazy, to us, is a warm-fuzzy-snuggly-type word used<br/>
more to describe a just-wanna-take-it-easy mood or day.<br/>
Myranda<br/>
<br/>
  How about unmotivated? Unmotivated gets the adult thinking about what<br/>
  the problem could be and what they could do to motivate the child.<br/>
<br/>
  Lazy is such an ugly label that usually says more about the person<br/>
  saying it than the one it is attached to.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe you&#39;re feeling a bit lazy (fill in stressed out, over-whelmed,<br/>
  needy) with all the youngsters so that you aren&#39;t able to provide the<br/>
  right kind of encouragement that fits *his* needs? See what I mean?<br/>
  The label &quot;Lazy&quot; just gets in the way of getting to a solution.<br/>
<br/>
  Kids do things at different times and see things and life in different<br/>
  ways from their parents. Half the fun of being a parent is figuring<br/>
  out the unique abililies and ways of seeing the world that our<br/>
  children have. Negative labels limit both parents and children, they<br/>
  get in the way of solutions and they hurt.<br/>
<br/>
  Not that I didn&#39;t hear plenty of those ugly labels when I was a child.<br/>
  I have to consciously *not* use them with my own children. And, by<br/>
  doing so, I&#39;ve managed to heal some of the pain those labels caused me<br/>
  when I was a child. And, the more I practice not using them, the<br/>
  easier it gets. We can reprogram those negative tapes that play in our<br/>
  heads, and sometimes we don&#39;t even realize are there, until we hear<br/>
  our parent&#39;s negative words coming out of our mouths directed at our<br/>
  own children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335575629">I&#39;m not trying to be defensive, just correct  the incorrect view you seem to have gotten from my post. I am thankful he has learned to recgonize his name, we&#39;ve been putting the boys names on their things since they were babies so we could tell whose stuff is whose, it&#39;s nice that he can recgonize it now after over 5 years of seeing it. Why shouldn&#39;t it be? He is getting better at doing some things like getting dressed in the mornings and going to the bathroom when he needs to, shouldn&#39;t I be thankful of that too? That doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s getting &quot;less lazy&quot;, he&#39;ll always be our little lazybones at heart, it&#39;s just the way he is. Just like Brett will always be our curious one, that&#39;s just the way he is. It&#39;s their personalities, nothing negative or wrong with it. Tyler would rather laze around and just enjoy the days slowly going by, while Brett would rather be doing something to help the day go by faster. And that&#39;s perfectly fine. I don&#39;t think it would be half as much fun if they&#39;re personalities were more alike. I think it may be the view of the word lazy as a negative that makes it hard to understand where I&#39;m coming from. <br/>
Myranda<br/>
  I don&#39;t think we misunderstood at all, and typing quickly doesn&#39;t make<br/>
  you say things you don&#39;t mean.. Your recent posts are full of<br/>
  contradictions. You say you&#39;re not expecting him to know these things,<br/>
  and then you say you&#39;re &quot;so thankful&quot; that he learned to recognize and<br/>
  spell his name last month.You say you don&#39;t see &quot;lazy&quot; as a negative<br/>
  word, and then you say he&#39;s your little lazybones but he&#39;s &quot;getting<br/>
  better&quot;. If you don&#39;t see &quot;lazy&quot; as a negative, then why would becomes<br/>
  less lazy be &quot;getting better&quot;? I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re trying to fool us<br/>
  or yourself. To really learn and grow, I&#39;ve found that it helps to take<br/>
  in the things that people are saying and look at them honestly - you<br/>
  don&#39;t need to immediately go on the defense. <br/>

You are ignoring us completely.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know his heart, and you cannot and SHOULD not say what he will <br/>
&quot;always be.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s just the way you define him, not necessarily the way he is.  <br/>
<br/>
But if you keep up that definition you will create truth in a way which is <br/>
NOT as good as you had hoped.<br/>
<br/>
To say Brett is curious says the others aren&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t be, because <br/>
that&#39;s Brett&#39;s thing.<br/>
<br/>
People are very sweetly and wisely asking you to consider damage you might be <br/>
doing.  People are telling personal tales of similar situations and saying <br/>
they wished it had stopped, and you&#39;re saying &quot;You&#39;re all wrong, I won&#39;t <br/>
stop, I won&#39;t think about it, nothing I&#39;m doing is bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Tyler would rather laze around-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know what he&#39;s thinking or what his motivations are, but you&#39;re <br/>
using language that characterizes it by your observations.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-and just enjoy the days slowly going by, while Brett would rather be doing <br/>
something to help the day go by faster.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Days don&#39;t go by faster.  Every one has 24 hours. <br/>
<br/>
-=-I think it may be the view of the word lazy as a negative that makes it <br/>
hard to understand where I&#39;m coming from. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think we all understand very well.<br/>
I think you should stop defending yourself for a week or two and really <br/>
honestly look at what &quot;lazy&quot; means.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685174159">You would have to be here to understand. Lazybones is not an insult, any more than calling Brett a silly goose or a curious cat is. We all have nicknames that fit our personality, and we all call each other by them. They sometimes get giggles, always smiles, and are sure to brighten up a gloomy mood. It&#39;s something special we do as a family, and we all love it. They are free to say if it bothers them (and I don&#39;t think they&#39;d hesitate since they don&#39;t hesitate to say if anything else bothers them). They have let us know in no uncertain terms that they do NOT want to be called sweetie, honey, or anything &quot;mushy&quot; like that. <br/>
<br/>
One thing I don&#39;t understand - just because I listed some things that he couldn&#39;t do or didn&#39;t want to do, several of you told me that I should be doing it for him. Why would you think I wasn&#39;t already doing it? Did I say something that made you think that I would force him to do something he didn&#39;t want to do? We practice what is now known as attachment parenting with our children, if they need or want something, we&#39;re there to provide it. They know this, and come to us with or for anything. <br/>
Myranda<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s no fondness, really, in such insults. <br/>
<br/>
  My sister was called &quot;Cow&quot; by  my mother many times, and not lovingly.  She <br/>
  said it because my sister would be the last to get in the car and the last to <br/>
  get out.  Sometimes the last to come into the house on a cold day.  &quot;Hurry <br/>
  up, COW!&quot; she would say.<br/>
<br/>
  My mother had been called &quot;Goose&quot; by her own parents.<br/>
<br/>
  I call my daughter &quot;Holly&quot; and tell her I love her, and to take her time.<br/>
<br/>
  Names stick.<br/>
  &quot;Lazy&quot; isn&#39;t nice and can&#39;t be made nice by smiling or by saying &quot;I&#39;m saying <br/>
  this because I like you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;Yes, lazy because he&#39;d rather miss a meal than have to actually get up and <br/>
  walk to the table. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to be at the table with people who are calling him <br/>
  lazy.  I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
  If food is important, take it to him where he is!  Maybe take yours too!  <br/>
  Or pick him up and hug him and say you want to eat with him and carry him to <br/>
  the table.<br/>
  Or get him to help you finish up the meal and garnish and present.<br/>
  Or go out.<br/>
<br/>
  But don&#39;t call him lazy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Labels can hurt, though, whether they&#39;re intended as insults or even as <br/>
loving commentary on our personalities.  Labels can impose restrictions on <br/>
who we are based on others&#39; expectations.  I don&#39;t think I can say it as <br/>
well, but it had never occurred to me until I read &quot;How to Talk...&quot; by <br/>
Faber and Mazlish.  Saying things like, &quot;She&#39;s my good girl&quot; can actually <br/>
be hurtful in the long run.   When I was a kid, I was &quot;the smart one.&quot;  It <br/>
messed me up because I couldn&#39;t just be me.  I felt judged and trapped by <br/>
my label.   If I wasn&#39;t always living up to being the &quot;smart&quot; one, I was <br/>
criticized for it and I was letting other people down just for being <br/>
me.  Brett could start feeling trapped by being dubbed the &quot;curious&quot; <br/>
one.  What if he did something that was not consistent with being <br/>
curious?  Would he have to endure comments (not just from you, either) <br/>
about not being true to his role?  What if your son did something that was <br/>
not consistent with being a lazybones?  Can you imagine that he might have <br/>
to listen to surprised people say, &quot;Gosh, you did that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people are cast into roles in a family, their motivation can subtly <br/>
shift from doing things for our own reasons to doing things to fulfill the <br/>
role (expectation).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m making sense, but I think it really merits closer <br/>
looking in to.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911995923">Hi Marji!<br/>
Yes, I remember reading that book years ago! It was good! But, as with anything, we take what works for us and leave the rest. I have fond memories of the nicknames I grew up with, and the boys love theirs, and I love the ones they have for me. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, both boys are left alone to do whatever they want to do. I&#39;ll let them know if something&#39;s going on so they can take part if they want to, but that&#39;s it. Neither of them are pushed into anything, never have been. That&#39;s what unschooling&#39;s all about, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Myranda <br/>
  Myranda, I can remember reading in the book How to Talk So Kids Will <br/>
  Listen... how labeling (&quot;he&#39;s our little lazybones&quot;), even lovingly, our <br/>
  kids can really set them up for filling roles rather than just Being Who <br/>
  They Are.  If you can get a copy of that book from the library, I think you <br/>
  will really enjoy reading that section!  It&#39;s an eye-opener!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;He&#39;s getting better a tiny bit at a time. Now he&#39;ll at least go and do <br/>
  &gt;things when we&#39;re out, when just last summer he wouldn&#39;t. Sorry about the <br/>
  &gt;&quot;can&#39;t even recgonize&quot;, though, I should have put &quot;can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;doesn&#39;t <br/>
  &gt;recgonize&quot; but when speed-typing with a baby standing up by pulling on <br/>
  &gt;your hair, you tend to not be as particular about wording. &lt;g&gt;   Oh, he <br/>
  &gt;has learned to recgonize and spell his name this last month, so I am <br/>
  &gt;thankful for that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I would also suggest (I haven&#39;t read all the other answers yet, and someone <br/>
  else may have said these things, probably much more eloquently) that you <br/>
  take a look at how you may be pushing him to do things on your clock rather <br/>
  than his clock.  We all do the things *we* need to do when *we* see the <br/>
  need to do them.  He may just enjoy sitting there doing nothing but being <br/>
  with his own thoughts and feelings.  How delightful it is to have the space <br/>
  to do that.  Recognizing letters and spelling your name is something you <br/>
  have to see the need for before you want to learn to do it.  If he feels <br/>
  rushed or pushed into learning things he may not be getting the freedom to <br/>
  learn things from his own internal desire.  There&#39;s a huge difference I think.<br/>
<br/>
  Warmly,<br/>
<br/>

There are people who insist that because people laugh and interact when <br/>
they&#39;re tickled that tickling is nice.  But there are kids who come to hate <br/>
(really, truly, avoid with emotion and dread the sight of) a relative, even a <br/>
parent, for tickling against their will.  Tickling can really hurt, and it&#39;s <br/>
physically abusive when one person says &quot;STOP&quot; and the other (a parent, or <br/>
adult) won&#39;t stop.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to pop my toes when I was little.  Pull them HARD until they <br/>
popped, and I never ever liked it, but that didn&#39;t stop her.  SHE thought it <br/>
was fun, so she thought I should think it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Using names with negative connotation will erode esteem and wholeness as <br/>
surely as rain and wind erode rock.  The kids won&#39;t know it hurts until <br/>
they&#39;re hurt.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said &quot;I&#39;m not hurting you,&quot; regardless of my feelings and statements.<br/>
