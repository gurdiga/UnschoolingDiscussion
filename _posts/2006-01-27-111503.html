<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023419321">The following is from the Car Talk site.  The link was sent to me by  <br/>
one of the fine unschooling moms &quot;from the AOL days, &quot; MsTerrE  <br/>

Busy season, busy January, sorry I&#39;m so behind in passing on the good  <br/>
stuff.<br/>

The text is below for those who don&#39;t like to follow links, and all  <br/>
of this can be deleted by anyone not interested in reading stuff from  <br/>
non-unschooling parents.  I think it&#39;s wonderful, though.  (The bio  <br/>
is fun, too, and illuminating, and touching, and inspiring.)<br/>

<br/>
The New Theory of Learning<br/>
<br/>
by Thomas L. Magliozzi<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few people actually read my bio, in which I refer to the New Theory  <br/>
of Learning. Some people asked, &quot;What is the New Theory of Learning?&quot;  <br/>
Well, here it is.<br/>
<br/>
This is not really a &quot;rant.&quot; In fact, it&#39;s one of the few topics that  <br/>
I think I actually know something about. And it&#39;s not really new. The  <br/>
problem is that it&#39;s so old we seem to have forgotten it and been  <br/>
caught up in so-called &quot;modern&quot; methods of teaching.<br/>
<br/>
The theory derives from many years of teaching experience. Nearly all  <br/>
of this teaching has been to MBA candidates. But, since I wrote this  <br/>
(about a year ago) I&#39;ve been noticing how even little kids learn, and  <br/>
I&#39;m more and more convinced that the New Theory may apply at ALL  <br/>
levels of learning. Let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
Premise I: THE LITTLE RED SCHOOLHOUSE THEORY<br/>
<br/>
I was a college professor for decades, during which time I became  <br/>
convinced that education had not progressed much beyond the Little  <br/>
Red Schoolhouse theory of learning. We put an expert in a roomful of  <br/>
people and the expert proceeds to tell them everything he knows.<br/>
<br/>
A major problem with this approach is that we ask people to sit and  <br/>
listen for long periods of time. Studies indicate that under such  <br/>
circumstances, we have an attention span of 20-30 minutes, and we  <br/>
retain about 20 percent of what we hear. This so-called &quot;teaching&quot;  <br/>
doesn&#39;t result in much learning. It results in, maybe, someone  <br/>
remembering enough to pass a test. It&#39;s not learning. It&#39;s passing a  <br/>
test. You walk away from the test and the valve in your brain opens  <br/>
and POOF--out goes the information to make room for the subject of  <br/>
the next test. An old Chinese proverb offers some guidance here.<br/>
<br/>
Tell me and I will surely forget.<br/>
Show me and I might remember.<br/>
But make me do it, and I will certainly understand.<br/>
<br/>
Listening does not lead to understanding; doing does lead to  <br/>
understanding. Does the cobbler teach his son how to cobble by  <br/>
telling him about it? Does the doctor learn to perform appendectomies  <br/>
by reading about them? No. They DO IT.<br/>
<br/>
 From my own personal experiences, doing something does lead to more  <br/>
learning. Perhaps your experience bears this out as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, the first element of the New Theory is that students must &quot;do&quot; as  <br/>
opposed to sitting and listening.<br/>
<br/>
Premise II: ONLY REAL REALITY IS REALITY<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are various teaching methods that allow &quot;doing&quot; (for  <br/>
example, in MBA programs we use cases and term projects).<br/>
<br/>
A word about cases (which I have used for nearly all my years of  <br/>
teaching). The MBA case is an attempt to make the student &quot;do it.&quot;  <br/>
But it&#39;s a somewhat feeble attempt. First of all, because the student  <br/>
very soon learns how to analyze cases and to feed back to the  <br/>
instructor what s/he knows the instructor wants to hear. Secondly,  <br/>
cases very soon get boring. Cases are dead, flat pieces of paper.  <br/>
They are an attempt to bring reality into the classroom, but they  <br/>
fail because they are very poor substitutes for real reality. The  <br/>
medical intern may spend some time on cadavers, but would you want a  <br/>
doctor trained on cadavers to operate on your heart? Me either.<br/>
<br/>
The second element of the New Theory, then, is this: If you&#39;re going  <br/>
to DO it, you must do it with real people in real situations.<br/>
<br/>
Some may argue against this part of the theory on the following  <br/>
grounds. &quot;What happens to the syllabus?&quot; &quot;How can one predict that  <br/>
the real situation will offer all the opportunities for subject  <br/>
matter that the expert deems necessary for this course?&quot; The answer  <br/>
is that you can&#39;t predict that it will. In fact, you can be pretty  <br/>
damned sure it won&#39;t. It will offer far more! One of the benefits of  <br/>
REAL reality teaching is that it becomes--of necessity-- <br/>
multidisciplinary. You don&#39;t encounter issues that all &quot;fit&quot; into one  <br/>
course. In MBA programs, for example, nearly all problems involve  <br/>
everything: marketing, finance, organizational behavior, operations  <br/>
research. You CAN&#39;T isolate anything. Everything depends on  <br/>
everything else.<br/>
<br/>
Premise III: THE BACKWARDS LEARNING THEORY<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a critical issue. People in the Little Red Schoolhouse  <br/>
environment have little (or no) idea of why they should want to know  <br/>
what the expert knows. In essence, we give them answers before they  <br/>
can really understand what the questions are. Sometimes, we tell them  <br/>
what the questions are. But mostly, they have no real understanding  <br/>
of the relevance of the questions to their lives. Example: &quot;Now I&#39;m  <br/>
going to teach you how to read financial statements.&quot; They ask, &quot;Why  <br/>
would I want to know that?&quot; No matter how we answer, they interpret  <br/>
it as, &quot;Because you will then be able to get a higher-paying job.&quot;  <br/>
This is supposed to motivate people to want to learn. It doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
Motivation literature is very clear on this point. It tells us that  <br/>
real motivation doesn&#39;t derive from external rewards (like money or  <br/>
grades) but from intrinsic rewards (wanting to know and deriving  <br/>
satisfaction from, for example, solving a problem). Our current  <br/>
techniques motivate students to struggle to remember enough to pass  <br/>
an exam.<br/>
<br/>
Question:<br/>
Why are we trying to teach people who don&#39;t really want to learn?  <br/>
Motivation is the key. Of course, we know that some people are self- <br/>
motivated. They have a desire to learn everything and anything. We  <br/>
don&#39;t have to worry about them. But others need to know why they  <br/>
should listen to you or me. Most of the problem here is that people  <br/>
are in colleges who don&#39;t belong in colleges. How the heck can an 18- <br/>
year-old kid know anything about anything--or more importantly, care  <br/>
about anything, besides the opposite sex? We fill up schools with  <br/>
kids wasting their parent&#39;s money and looking for a place to  <br/>
socialize. There are better, less expensive, and more productive ways  <br/>
to do that. But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed about the relationship between learning and  <br/>
motivation. Maybe you&#39;ve noticed it, too. Have you ever been faced  <br/>
with a problem like any of the following? Maybe you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
decide how to deal with a particularly difficult person. Or maybe  <br/>
you&#39;re staring at a pile of numbers and you don&#39;t know what the hell  <br/>
it all means. Or, you&#39;re trying to decide whether to invest some  <br/>
money in a company and you can&#39;t make sense of the financials. Or-- <br/>
whatever. It&#39;s a problem for which you WANT an answer.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s take the first example--a difficult person--just to follow  <br/>
through on what you might do. You simply don&#39;t understand why the  <br/>
person is behaving the way she is behaving. If you understood why,  <br/>
you might be able to figure out what to do. Faced with such a problem  <br/>
you might seek out an expert--someone who understands people&#39;s  <br/>
behavior. He might give you some insights. He might suggest that the  <br/>
problem really isn&#39;t unique. Lots of people act this way under  <br/>
certain circumstances. YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT IN SUCH A SITUATION YOU  <br/>
ARE LISTENING VERY INTENTLY. QUITE UNLIKE THE WAY YOU LISTEN IN A  <br/>
CLASSROOM. He, the expert, might even suggest some things you might  <br/>
read to find out more. You can&#39;t wait to get to the library. You find  <br/>
books, articles. You read.<br/>
<br/>
Think about HOW you&#39;re reading in this situation. Is it the same as  <br/>
the way you read textbooks when you were a student? It sure as hell  <br/>
isn&#39;t. The difference is that you&#39;re INTERESTED in finding the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it some more. What do you actually do under these  <br/>
situations? Do you read everything? No. You&#39;re looking for answers to  <br/>
specific questions. What happens is this. You look at a lot of books  <br/>
and articles until you find something that seems relevant. You read  <br/>
it. Something strikes a chord: maybe a word, maybe a theory, maybe a  <br/>
description of a certain personality type that matches the one you&#39;re  <br/>
dealing with. Now you go in search of more info on that personality  <br/>
type. You find more books. They lead you to more. And pretty soon,  <br/>
you know what to do and how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
While all this was happening, how might you have felt? Were you  <br/>
saying to yourself, &quot;God, I wish I didn&#39;t have to read all this?&quot; Did  <br/>
you yawn a lot? Did you ask, &quot;Why am I reading this?&quot; Hell no. You  <br/>
probably wished you had more to read. More people to answer your  <br/>
questions. You were--LEARNING!<br/>
<br/>
Notice what happened. You worked backwards. You started with the  <br/>
problem. A problem that you had a need or desire to solve. You  <br/>
started somewhere--either with an expert or a book--and you went  <br/>
whereever it took you. And you went more than willingly; not with  <br/>
someone dragging you, kicking and screaming. You went because you  <br/>
wanted to go. Because you knew it was taking you where you wanted to go.<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s the third element of the New Theory:<br/>
<br/>
Work backwards. Start with the problem and go wherever it takes you.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the theory that&#39;s been evolving for me over all my years of  <br/>
teaching. Don&#39;t let an &quot;expert&quot; stand in front of people and tell  <br/>
them everything s/he knows. This is mostly just an ego trip for the  <br/>
expert, and a very boring experience for the victims. The overhead  <br/>
projector has done more to destroy learning than any other thing I  <br/>
can think of.<br/>
