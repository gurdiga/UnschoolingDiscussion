<div id="ygrps-yiv-389191944">#1, I have a visceral and moral objection to anonymous websites, especially <br/>
when they give information in first-person (what &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot; believe or do).   <br/>
  There&#39;s one website that has some of my articles, and I don&#39;t mind that, <br/>
but there was a glitch in it so I&#39;d like to let them know so they could repair <br/>
it, but there&#39;s not a mailing address or name anywhere, and no way to figure <br/>
out who to contact.   <br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s one that&#39;s new to me.   In looking for a link to something else, <br/>
I ended up on a site that&#39;s just tons of homeschooling links and <br/>
advertisements.   I thought while I was there I&#39;d look and see if I was still listed as a <br/>
contact, and request to be removed.   I found a link to a site for <br/>
homeschooling info for New Mexico, and while that&#39;s local, I&#39;m not even giving you the <br/>
link so never mind.   It&#39;s nine short pages with fairly useful kinds of info, but <br/>
CLEARLY not by someone who considers unschooling a possibility or an option, <br/>
and I guess by what I&#39;m quoting below she doesn&#39;t even know it exists.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-People choose to home school for a variety of reasons. Some people believe <br/>
that it is a calling from God. Others do it because of the poor academic <br/>
standards found in many public schools. Some parents want to avoid negative <br/>
influences (gangs, drugs, sex, etc.) in public schools. These days, many families <br/>
have become fearful for their children’s safety in the public schools.-=-<br/>
<br/>
End of the variety of reasons; none applies to my family.<br/>
  <br/>
-=-Most families have several reasons for home schooling. In our case, we <br/>
chose to home school because of falling academic standards and because much of <br/>
the curricula found in our local schools is morally objectionable to us as <br/>
Christians. Then again, I have heard of atheists and pagan worshippers who home <br/>
school because they believe that the schools are too Christianized!-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not only does is she not familiar with unschooling, she&#39;s not too clear on <br/>
what &quot;pagan&quot; means if she thinks someone worships pagan, but that&#39;s okay... <br/>
ideas can be dangerous, if you&#39;re afraid of ideas.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Whatever the reason, all home school parents have this in common: We have <br/>
a passionate belief that our children do better at home, learning our values, <br/>
studying curricula which have been carefully selected by us.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Uh.... Yeah.   No.<br/>
I mean<br/>
Yes, yes and not even.<br/>
<br/>
So I live in New Mexico, which is fairly invisible and unknown, and I <br/>
practice parenting and not-having-kids-in-school in an invisible and unknown way.   <br/>
<br/>
I have got to be one of the invisiblest people around!!!!   <br/>
At least I&#39;m not a pagan worshiper, though.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, it&#39;s probably for the best that unschooling is a stealth creature.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pagan worshipper is a common phrase malaprop.  I&#39;ve heard it.  I doubt <br/>
she invented it.  Probably originally an abbreviation of pagan *idol* <br/>
worshipper.  Ah well like you say, it doesn&#39;t pay to think too much if <br/>
it&#39;s too real a danger in one&#39;s mind to look at ideas.  I heard the <br/>
opposite for a second when you said that about worshipping pagan: <br/>
christian worshipper-- Would it be blasphemous to capitalize that? <br/>
Yeh. <br/>
  The Christian worshipper.  I swear I&#39;ve heard that said too, probably<br/>
<br/>
followed by the words &quot;of God&quot;.<br/>
