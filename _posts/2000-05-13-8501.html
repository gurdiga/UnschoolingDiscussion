<br/>
Just had to ask, do all pet turtles smell or has yours died?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428736489">wow you are really s.w. of us! anyway you could try the Ohio unschoolers<br/>
list or Ohio home schoolers list something like that, anyway they are very<br/>
very informative,<br/>
attatched is my notification letter I am sure we probably provided to much<br/>
info, we use a neighbors scope and sequence book to come up with what would<br/>
be covered  under each subject and  then made a list of computer software,<br/>
games and  the geosafari they would use, but I didn&#39;t even list one book or<br/>
curriculum!!! no questions asked!<br/>
good luck I hope this helps, it was very scary for us, as nobody showed us<br/>
what they had sent in, our neighbors homeschool, but were very closed<br/>
mouthed about how to notify, they didn&#39;t show us anything or talk much about<br/>
it so we just dove in and gave it a shot, I think this year we may not send<br/>
as formal a one or maybe we will just send the same exact one with more<br/>
computer games added to the list as our collection has grown! I don&#39;t think<br/>
they read it anyway!!!<br/>

ratsitting the other two, but we do have two dogs, one rat , one hampster,<br/>
and one gerbil!!!<br/>
I would have many more if I lived outside the city limits! maybe thats why<br/>
my husband opted  to add onto the house rather than move to the country, he<br/>
was just scared!!<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Notification<br/>
&gt;Since you can&#39;t be held to what you include in your notification, what a<br/>
&gt;lot of people I know do is to print out the World Book scope and sequence<br/>
&gt;from their web site and include that as the &quot;intended curriculum&quot; and then<br/>
&gt;go through their house and community and list resources they might use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I did for our first year. I said we would refer to<br/>
this (and some other curriculum-sounding materials) as a &quot;framework&quot; for my<br/>
son&#39;s &quot;independent studies&quot;, and included in the ending paragraph that this<br/>
course of study &quot;will be subject to modifications&quot; as new ideas and<br/>
interests are explored. Then I listed all the software, books, games, etc.<br/>
that we have available, either at home or in the community, by subject. Of<br/>
course, after all that stress of preparing this letter, the school system<br/>
returned a form to fill out, asking me to repeat what I had just said in<br/>
the letter, and requiring my signature. Sheesh! I am writing a lot less for<br/>
next year.<br/>
