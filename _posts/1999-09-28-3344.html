&lt;&lt; &lt; I believe it is a violation of someone&#39;s privacy rights to tape them <br/>
 without <br/>
  their consent.... but I&#39;m not a lawyer, so look for a source of better <br/>
  information.  I don&#39;t think you would be able to admit the tapes as <br/>
 evidence.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 Ahha! This could very well be true. The thing to do is to get on tape with <br/>
 him, and plainly state, *Name*, I am taping this and all telephone <br/>
 conversations that are happening. That is what I did to my exhusband. He <br/>
 sotpped calling for a time. &gt;&gt;<br/>

    Well she has let him know that he is leaving these messages on the <br/>
answering machine and that that means she has tapes of his behavior.  He says <br/>
that he doesn&#39;t care.  When he blows up like that, he just wants her to know <br/>
how he feels, and he doesn&#39;t care who else hears them.  He even thinks that <br/>
other listeners will agree with him about what he is saying!   The guy is <br/>
truly amazing!!!NOT<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472472413">For some reason I was reminded of that case where the ex-wife killed her <br/>
ex-husband and his new wife.  Bamberek or something like that.  Tapes of her <br/>
phone calls and phone messages were used in court against her.<br/>

Ya know, I would send in a copy of the tapes when I wrote the letter to FOC. <br/>
JUST A COPY! Let natural curosity hit them and do the work. I would write in <br/>
a letter that *Name* is doing this, this, this, and this. Here is a copy of <br/>
ONE of the tapes I have that shows that these are disruptive and insulting. I <br/>
would like to know what i am to do in the event that one of my children be <br/>
present when I review messages on my machine. <br/>
Ask and ye shall receive??? Just sqeak those wheels until FOC comes along <br/>
andgreases them in a acceptable manner!<br/>
