<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310544070">One of my sisters took the CBEST a month or so ago and failed the math part. <br/>
This is the test that all teachers and credential-seekers have to take to <br/>
teach in California. My sister has severe math phobia.<br/>
<br/>
She can take it again on June 8th. She has a WONDERFUL job offer for fall - <br/>
at 3 times her current pay rate and a job she really really wants to do. But <br/>
she can&#39;t have the job if she doesn&#39;t pass this test on June 8th. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been intensively tutoring her, every chance we get. <br/>
<br/>
She has a REALLY hard time being willing to TAKE time to think about the <br/>
&quot;sense&quot; of what she&#39;s doing. She wants to just memorize computational <br/>
techniques and not &quot;think&quot; about meaning at all. But --- it doesn&#39;t work. She <br/>
can&#39;t retain the methods of doing the computations and she can&#39;t figure out <br/>
which to use in what problems AND the multiple choice test answers are all <br/>
based on common mistakes in applying computational techniques - so when she <br/>
makes one of those common mistakes, the answer IS there and she chooses that <br/>
and then gets the problem wrong. (We have lots of practice tests.)<br/>
<br/>
So - finally, today, we had MANY hours together in an empty house- no <br/>
interruptions. I convinced her to just play along with me - give me a couple <br/>
of hours to NOT just show her how to do computations, but to help her get the <br/>
underlying meaning of what she was doing. <br/>
<br/>
We played games. Now, these were very pointedly math games - we didn&#39;t play <br/>
just any old games - I made these up or got them from books and they were <br/>
very specifically designed to build an understanding of specific mathematical <br/>
ideas. (Remember, she isn&#39;t a kid and we don&#39;t have time for these concepts <br/>
to build up, slowly and naturally, over time. AND she suffers from truly <br/>
sever math phobia.)<br/>
<br/>
But - they were games. I mean - they were NOT really obviously and directly <br/>
showing her how to solve problems on the test.<br/>
<br/>
We played one game that helped her understand fractions, for example. I made <br/>
strips of colored paper -- one 12 inches long, cut one into 2 6-inch pieces, <br/>
cut another into 4 3-inch pieces, another into 8 pieces and another into 16 <br/>
pieces. All different colors. I made a spinner with the numbers 1/2, 1/4, <br/>
1/8, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/16 on it. To start, I covered the long strip with the <br/>
two halves. Then she spun and had two choices --- she could &quot;trade&quot; one of <br/>
the pieces on the long strip for other strips - as long as they were <br/>
equivalent to the one she took off the long strip AND contained at least one <br/>
strip that was the fraction she&#39;d spun. The other option was to simply remove <br/>
the fraction she&#39;d spun from the long strip IF she had such a piece there. <br/>
The goal was to uncover the long strip in as few spins as possible. I had her <br/>
play it a bunch of times just as a solitaire game while I made strips for <br/>
myself and then we played against each other, trying to be the one to get our <br/>
long strip uncovered first - alternating turns.<br/>
<br/>
By the time she&#39;d played a while, she had a MUCH better &quot;number sense&quot; about <br/>
fractions. Before that, she&#39;d constantly made the mistake of thinking things <br/>
like 1/8 was smaller than 1/10 -- because instead of understanding about <br/>
fractions, she&#39;d just see the 8 and 10 and think 10 is bigger and so 1/10 <br/>
must be bigger. After we&#39;d played this game, it was obvious to her that the <br/>
bigger denominator, the smaller the fraction since it meant something is <br/>
divided into more, and therefore smaller, pieces. She no longer has to try to <br/>
MEMORIZE that a bigger denominator means a smaller fraction - it is just <br/>
something that is clear to her. She also &quot;gets&quot; the relationship between <br/>
fractions. <br/>
<br/>
After she&#39;d played a while with those pieces, I added 1/3, 1/6, and 1/12 <br/>
pieces and created a new spinner with those added (took off 1/2 from the <br/>
spinner).  <br/>
<br/>
Later, when we were working on using fractions - I kept these pieces all <br/>
sitting out, lined up in strips, so she could look at them while adding or <br/>
subtracting. Having spent time PLAYING with them, they were her friends and <br/>
it was automatic for her to reach for them to figure out things like 1/3 plus <br/>
1/4. (She covered both the 1/3 and the 1/4 strips up with 12ths so she could <br/>
see that the 1/3 strip was equivalent to 4 1/12ths and the 1/4 strip was <br/>
equivalent to 3 1/12ths and so together they were 7/12ths.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have &quot;taught&quot; her how to do this umpteen times, but this time she <br/>
&quot;discovered&quot; it for herself, using &quot;toys&quot; she&#39;d been playing with. I could <br/>
see the light go on and that was it -- she quickly absorbed all the other <br/>
stuff about fractions. We covered everything else in another hour or two and <br/>
then went on to play some decimal games and covered decimals and percentages. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SHE was amazed at how quickly she was able to really TRULY learn so much <br/>
material after she&#39;d spent some time &quot;just playing.&quot; She felt the difference <br/>
in her grasp -- the difference between UNDERSTANDING and memorizing a <br/>
computational technique.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also gone to a psychologist recently, at my suggestion, to get help <br/>
with techniques to reduce her panic during math tests. She got LOTS of help - <br/>
breating and physical muscle relaxing exercises and self-talk exercises to <br/>
practice several times a day, which she&#39;s been doing for almost 2 weeks.  It <br/>
seems to have really really helped - even during our study session her <br/>
anxiety seemed far less obstructive today.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought this was something some of you might find interesting.<br/>
