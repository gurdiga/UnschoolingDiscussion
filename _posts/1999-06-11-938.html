<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360693681">This list has been the very support group I have been looking for as an<br/>
unschooler!  I enjoy listening to the lively debate about the essence of<br/>
unschooling and hows and whys of doing it.  My own experience in learning<br/>
to unschool has been a mix of highs and lows.  The lows include being<br/>
badmouthed around the extended family for my steely conviction to<br/>
unschool and the highs include the personal discoveries of how wonderful<br/>
a person I am and what I have to offer my children as they grow up.  One<br/>
of the defining moments of discovery was to read a book (reviewed in Home<br/>
Education Magazine, I believe) about the vicious effects of our<br/>
behaviorism-driven society.  It&#39;s called &quot;Punished By Rewards&quot; by Alfie<br/>
Kohn. The subtitle reads &quot;the trouble with gold stars, incentive plans,<br/>
A&#39;s, praise, and other bribes.&quot;  After reading that book, curriculum<br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly be an option for me!  <br/>
     That said, I can appreciate that some homeschoolers do stand in a<br/>
nether world between structured learning and child-led learning.  It is<br/>
difficult to find that support which you desire when neither &quot;group&quot; is<br/>
matching your interests fully.  Unschooling has traditionally been<br/>
understood to mean &quot;without curriculum&quot; so that is why the passionate<br/>
words to keep this list &quot;curriculum free&quot;.  I take what I need from the<br/>
dialog and respect that which I don&#39;t need.  If this list becomes a<br/>
definitive outpost for all those seeking support and information on<br/>
unschooling, all the better!  <br/>
