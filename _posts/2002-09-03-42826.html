 </span></blockquote>Hi, Mindy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves tonight,<br/>
and one point that the author makes is that children sometimes need time<br/>
between interests.  Processing time, or whatever.  Is it possible your<br/>
daughter is just between interests at the moment?<br/>
<br/>
I find that lots of my son&#39;s ideas come as outgrowths (sometimes very odd<br/>
ones...) of things we do together.  When he complains of being bored,<br/>
sometimes I stop and think that we really haven&#39;t been doing much lately.<br/>
So we plan a trip, or pull our a new puzzle or an old game, or whatever.<br/>
Eventually something seems to catch on and pull him out of the rut.<br/>
<br/>
I read a couple of the Classical Education (also called Thomas Jefferson<br/>
Education) books a while back, and besides realizing that I could never do<br/>
that -- I don&#39;t have the patience for that approach, I really liked a point<br/>
that the author made.  His response to parents who complained that their<br/>
children weren&#39;t interested in math or didn&#39;t like reading it was to ask<br/>
when *they* had last read some Euclidian Geometry or such.  It reminded me<br/>
to think about what I&#39;m doing myself.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are all sorts of things she&#39;s learning from &quot;just playing<br/>
all day&quot;, too.  Kid&#39;s work is play.<br/>
