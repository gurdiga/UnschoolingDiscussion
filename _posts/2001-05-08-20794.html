<div id="ygrps-yiv-984125130">There have been so many post re spanking and discipline, I had to check to see which list I joined.  I finally just deleted them without reading, so if someone else has already said something to this effect, I am sorry for the repeat.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve only been here a few weeks but I was really looking for a group of folks that we tolerant and understanding of the differences in the choices people make.  The past few days have been one post after another hammering the same subject.  Most, if not all, of us have thrown in our two cents.  Move on.  As with the way we choose to &quot;school&quot; our children differently from the vast majority, we also choose to raise our children differently.  Isn&#39;t it all about doing what is best for US and OUR different situations?  I am constantly having to watch what I say about the way we school.  I was hoping this was a place where I could throw out a thought/feeling/opinion on a topic and NOT be attacked for being different than the majority.  We all know what that feels like.  We are a group of unschoolers, we are not the majority or even a big minority.  We are looked upon as just too different.  Shouldn&#39;t this be the one place (in my case the only place) <br/>
where a person feels comfortable being different?  This time, re disciplice, I feel into the majority.  What if, the next time I toss in my two cents, I am the minority?  Maybe I&#39;ll just lurk for a while.  <br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, the spanking/discipline thing is a dead horse.  Just like with unschooling, we are all different and all of our children will be just fine, spanked or not. <br/>
