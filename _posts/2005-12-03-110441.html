the same question with the same<br/>
response at least two more times.  Then she changed<br/>
her question to, <br/>
&quot;Is Santa Claus Real?&quot;  I answered<br/>
honestly.  She repeated her question again and I think<br/>
I asked her <br/>
what she wanted me to tell her.  She said,<br/>
&quot;The TRUTH!&quot;  so I answered honestly again.  Then I<br/>

little heart break and she started bawling.-=-<br/>

kinder than blunt honesty.  Asking repeatedly or<br/>
expressing disbelief in the answer is an indication<br/>
that&#39;s not the answer she wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done gifts the way my parents did, which is<br/>
wrapped gifts are from known, real people.  Only the<br/>
Christmas stocking is from Santa.  That has been a<br/>
help as the kids figured it out or asked.  Nothing<br/>
changed but the idea about the stockings.<br/>

-=-Just thought I&#39;d share our experience.  Any advice<br/>
or comfort?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell her you&#39;re sorry she&#39;s sad, and<br/>
ask her whether she thinks it would&#39;ve been better if<br/>
you had just told a little of the truth at a time. <br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll have good ideas for other families.<br/>
<br/>
I also think things like that shouldn&#39;t be told while<br/>
you&#39;re driving.  It&#39;s like announcing a death.  There<br/>
are reasons for all that getting a box of kleenex<br/>
handy and sitting down with the person and being close<br/>
enough to hold a hand and giving a hug.<br/>

This is what I do too!!! We&#39;ve sometimes hired a Santa to come over on Christmas Eve, but the kids have figured out that the big garbage bag I carry out just before he arrives is filled with their presents.  They&#39;ve requested his return again this year :)  <br/>
<br/>
On a lighter note: Two boys were discussing the existence of Satan after church one day... One boy says, &quot;I figure it&#39;s just like Santa -- probably our dads&quot; <br/>
