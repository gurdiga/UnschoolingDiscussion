lessons!  I love it!  I usually &gt;practice about an hour a day and can hardly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always wanted to learn piano; my mother, on the other hand, didn&#39;t have<br/>
much interest in it because she&#39;d had lessons foisted on her from the time she<br/>
was a little girl. I&#39;d played viola in elementary school, but there were no<br/>
more lessons afterwards. I started taking piano again when I was 17 and it was<br/>
available as a class in school. I loved it! I&#39;ve made plans to take it up again<br/>
shortly.<br/>

I totally agree!<br/>

    Hafidha,                                                                    <br/>
            I have a young son ( 5yo) that is also very shy.  Looking back, <br/>
is there anything that ,in your opinion, would have helped you with your <br/>
shyness?  Do you think your parents could have or should have handled things <br/>
differently, so that you would maybe have been more comfortable in new <br/>
situations?  I remembered being extremely shy as a child, and I definitely <br/>
did not want to be pushed into anything, and I don&#39;t want to push my child <br/>
too much, either; however, sometimes he needs that encouragement... to find <br/>
out that things can be fun to do.  Yesterday we went to an Easter egg hunt.  <br/>
Before we left to go, my little boy expressed how he was scared.  I told him <br/>
that we were going to go ahead and go, and that he could see what it was like <br/>
when we got there, and that if he decided that he did not want to do it, that <br/>
he did not have to. Well, he ended up taking part,and enjoying it, so I was <br/>
happy for him, but the shyness is something we have to deal with continually. <br/>
So, if you, or anyone else, would have any thoughts on dealing with shyness, <br/>
I&#39;d like to hear them.  Thanks in advance!                                      <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you handled it well--providing encouragement and your<br/>
reassuring presence, taking just one step at a time, going andletting him<br/>
decide then.<br/>
<br/>
My son was somewhat shy or clingy.  We did much what you do.  He has<br/>
gradually gotten over it.  He still does better in smaller groups than in<br/>
large groups.  He took steps as he was ready.<br/>
