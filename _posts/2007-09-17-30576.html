BE:<br/>
Yes, Sandra, John Holt deserves much credit for making Homeschooling<br/>
popular.<br/>
But John was a preceded by Ivan Illich with whom he became a close<br/>
colleague.<br/>
Both were driven by their concern that education trapped society into<br/>
the status quo.<br/>
In 1970 Ivan wrote &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; the message of which has been<br/>
largely lost by by modern homeschoolers.<br/>
Below is a review of that seminal book.  I wrote it on Ivan&#39;s death. It<br/>
may have some relevance to you valuable work.<br/>

<br/>
Bill, I enjoyed reading your article on Ivan Illich.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very interested in the legacies of these men and where they would <br/>
stand now.<br/>
<br/>
Last week at the Live and Learn Conference, someone came up to me and <br/>
said that she had been talking with some Waldorf folks down at the <br/>
playground a bit concerned about the apparent love of technology by <br/>
most of the parents and children at the conference. I think a lot of <br/>
Waldorfy parents start looking into unschooling as their children age <br/>
because it seems, to them, to be a logical progression. Several of the <br/>
Waldorf websites mention unschooling very positively. But I don&#39;t think <br/>
they are prepared for what unschooling really is. I hope they weren&#39;t <br/>
too turned off...hard to say.<br/>
<br/>
But yesterday as my principal-friend Gillian (yes, my best friend is a <br/>
teacher/principal! &lt;G&gt;---LOTS of interesting dicussions there!) and I <br/>
were painting Duncan&#39;s room (he&#39;s getting a more grown up room), I <br/>
mentioned the Waldorf parents at the conference. Gill had been offered <br/>
a job 30 years ago to work in a Steiner school in Germany. She chose <br/>
not to because of the four year training period. But she wasn&#39;t all <br/>
that *up* on the philosophy, so we talked a bit about it.<br/>
<br/>
She was wondering why/how the philosophy had progressed from the early <br/>
1900s to now. What would Steiner had thought about where his movement <br/>
had gone? Would he have changed with the times? TV (BIG Waldorf no-no, <br/>
but it didn&#39;t even exist during Steiner&#39;s lifetime)? Legos? Video games <br/>
(yeah---right! I doubt it!)? Computers? (SURELY!!)<br/>
<br/>
Well, that also got us taking about John Holt. We know that Holt became <br/>
more and more radical as he aged. And many unschoolers (me included) <br/>
have been accused of taking his philosophy &quot;too far.&quot; That he really <br/>
just meant HOMEschooling. But I can&#39;t find anywhere in his writings <br/>
where school at home was ever considered an option. I think he saw that <br/>
as simply a stepping stone to real unschooling: some parents might need <br/>
to do a little &quot;school-at-home&quot; to get their feet wet before they <br/>
diving into unschooling. You know---just a little paddling/treading <br/>
before they took the plunge? I don&#39;t think he ever meant for parents to <br/>
bring school home in any way or shape. I think he figured they would <br/>
SEE that learning happened all the time, that children are natural <br/>
learners if they just took the children OUT of school and had them at <br/>
home a bit. The &quot;schoolwork&quot; would simply disappear after a while when <br/>
the parents figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holt UNDERSTOOD that we are natural learners. ALL of us!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say for sure that he would have embraced video gaming, but I <br/>
really think he would *certainly* have seen its value just by observing <br/>
children at play! He would have to have seen the huge connections being <br/>
made and joy in the faces of the children while they play and learn. I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine his suggesting that they were harmful in any way.<br/>
<br/>
He was incredibly progressive. Embracing new technologies would have <br/>
been right up his alley to me! He had to have loved challenges and <br/>
learning anything new. Can&#39;t you see him at level 68 in WoW? &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have &quot;we&quot; taken Holt too far? Possibly. But I think he was clearly <br/>
moving in a more radical direction in his last book, and I think he <br/>
would have had to have been appalled at the school-at-homers (doh!) <br/>
that are driving the learning right out of their children by being so <br/>
much like school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see more discussion about Holt & Illich and how others <br/>
think their thinking would have progressed.<br/>
<br/>
And not that it matters *here*---but Rudolf Steiner and Maria <br/>
Montessori as well (I can do them on my own. &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-592477892">-=-During the 1970s a few scattered families broke away from  <br/>
government schools and started homeschooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
During the 1960&#39;s there were hippie families in New Mexico who were  <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, Sandra, John Holt deserves much credit for making  <br/>
Homeschooling popular.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t make it &quot;popular.&quot;  He made it possible for people who&#39;d  <br/>
never heard of it, and understandable for those who were afraid of  <br/>
it.  It wasn&#39;t a fad, it wasn&#39;t &quot;popular.&quot;  It was, for some  <br/>
families, a life-and-death option, a desperation.  For others it was  <br/>
an interesting social experiment.  For others it was living more  <br/>
fully by the principles that had caused them to separate from  <br/>
tradition in other areas of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
John  Holt is inspirational.  His writings were inspirational to my  <br/>
education professors in the early 1970&#39;s.  When I was teaching,  <br/>
others I taught with were also John Holt fans.  The early-&#39;80&#39;s book  <br/>
&quot;Chop Wood, Carry Water&quot; which inspired many people  to live more  <br/>
mindfully  cited John Holt, and Growing Without Schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Ivan Illich wasn&#39;t corresponding with families who wanted to  <br/>
homeschool; John Holt was.<br/>
Illich had influences too.  We could walk backwards through history  <br/>
or we could look at what&#39;s happening now.<br/>
<br/>
I unschool because Carol Rice-McClure and Lori Odhner did.  There are  <br/>
other families that have unschooled because Pam Sorooshian and I did  <br/>
(or other families they knew or corresponded with).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling as a straight-out substitute for using a curriculum  <br/>
doesn&#39;t go very far toward people&#39;s families being like mine is.  The  <br/>
reason I&#39;ve written and written is that there&#39;s a whole lot more to  <br/>
it.  It&#39;s a way of being, of seeing, of thinking.  It&#39;s a philosophy  <br/>
that goes beyond schoolish/non-schoolish concerns.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s writings got me inspired to be a school reformer when I  <br/>
was still a teenager.  I taught in my 20&#39;s.  I was as radical as I  <br/>
could be under the circumstances, and I walked away because it  <br/>
couldn&#39;t be changed.  I did other things that also prepared me for my  <br/>
unseen future.<br/>
<br/>
I still like to read John Holt&#39;s stuff, but nothing in the past can  <br/>
change the facts involved in my chldren&#39;s current lives.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is working in Texas and really liking it.  He said it&#39;s okay  <br/>
now for me to say that he works for Blizzard (a video-game company),  <br/>
though their employees are not allowed to discuss any particulars of  <br/>
what they do at work.<br/>
In Pam&#39;s family, Roya is about to return from a summer working in the  <br/>
Alaskan wilderness.  Roxana&#39;s going to France in February for a  <br/>
semester.<br/>
<br/>
These kids who were unschooled without reservations, unschooled  <br/>
deeply and fully, are growing up confident, busy, and whole.  They  <br/>
don&#39;t have to merge with the real world; they were always part of the  <br/>
real world.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of confidence in unschooling when it&#39;s done fully and  <br/>
really lived, not just dabbled in or acted out or talked about.<br/>

<br/>
Very awesome! How exciting to share with my video-gamers that even video  <br/>
game careers can be unschooled. Even when the gamer magazines, gamer experts and  <br/>
industry insiders all say college is needed to get into that field. Thank you <br/>
 for sharing that!!<br/>
 <br/>
Updates on the older unschoolers are always good reading at our  house.<br/>

  I&#39;m one of those who unschools because Sandra did -- because she talked about it at homeschooling conferences, because she wrote articls about it and posted them online, because I saw her children at a local homeschooling conference and was just so taken with what incredible kids they were/are.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve never found the writings of Holt or Illich particularly helpful. Sure, Holt&#39;s ideas are wonderful, but I find his writing too dry and academic -- and he never had kids!  I needed to hear about unschooling from someone who&#39;d actually lived it.  <br/>
