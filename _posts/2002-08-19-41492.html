<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They are. But for some people who question the need to teach their children<br/>
&gt; math it&#39;s a natural extension to question the need to teach their children<br/>
&gt; anything else. If living life is enough for history, then why should<br/>
&gt; figuring out teeth brushing be any different?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned&#39;s turn: <br/>
To me, unschooling does not mean  not  teaching your child. It simply means<br/>
not doint to them what schools do, which is force them to think about<br/>
certain things, to study those things in certain ways using certain books<br/>
and certain people called teachers, all with schedules and in certain<br/>
locations. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore, UNschooling is narrowly defined simply by the absence of forced<br/>
schooling. It allows the child to be a free learner, to follow his/her<br/>
curiosity as much as possible. The parent&#39;s role in it is to be available to<br/>
help when that curiosity needs satisfying. At those times, a parent can be a<br/>
great help, and, I believe, should try to be. For example, if a child wants<br/>
to be &quot;schooled&quot; in a subject, then that is the child&#39;s choice in how to<br/>
follow his/her curiosity about it. What keeps it under the description of<br/>
UNschooling is the lack of force and the initiative coming from the kid.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if a kid is interested in history, then simply &quot;living life&quot;<br/>
will not teach the kid much about the subject. Such a child needs resources<br/>
about history in order to learn to the degree s/he is curious.<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically, it is possible for a kid to spend a great deal of his/her<br/>
time studying things -- even school subjects -- and still be an UNschooler.<br/>
The difference is in the compulsion and the absence of it.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, maybe a dentist is the right person to tell a child about the<br/>
benefits and joys of clean teeth, and perhaps a few ideas about the<br/>
consequences of badly maintained ones.<br/>
<br/>
Like sitting in school, sitting in front of a TV is a passive experience,<br/>
and the learning is second-hand. In both cases, we are hearing, seeing,<br/>
other people&#39;s experience, not having our own. Therefore, it is a parent&#39;s<br/>
duty, if possible, to provide the children with as much first-hand<br/>
&quot;hands-on&quot; experience as we can...ride a horse, sail a boat, dig in the<br/>
sandy beach, skip stones on the water, play sports, climb, camp,  build a<br/>
fort, pick apples, dance, sing, play music, shoot arrows, write stories,<br/>
cook meals, grow food, take care of animals, swim, etc,etc.<br/>
<br/>
And from doing those things, and of course a thousand others,  their<br/>
curiosity will be piqued and will trigger and lead to all the (passive -<br/>
from books, etc)  learning they will need.<br/>

<br/>
This happened to us! We were at the orthodontist and he started lecturing me about my son needing to clean his teeth more/better. I said he needed to speak to my  13 yo son as my son was the one brushing ( or not) the teeth. He did - and in a  much nicer tone than the one he was using to me! Turned out, this has inspired my son ( and all of us!) to be more diligent with teeth brushing! ..Leonie<br/>

Glad to see the words if possible written in here.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday while doing some running around a very talkative nice lady<br/>
told my son he must love homeschooling because of all the wonderful field<br/>
trips and other the other things she thinks &#39;all&#39; of us homeschoolers do.<br/>
My son looked very confused!  We don&#39;t go on all kinds of trips for a few<br/>
reasons, one being that we only had a run down unrelable second car until<br/>
very recently and most importantly neither ds 7 nor dd 5 are interested yet<br/>
in doing these kinds of things.  A relation of mine, who is a new<br/>
&#39;homeschooler&#39; thinks it&#39;s my &#39;job&#39; to *make* them go now that I have a much<br/>
better newer car. I have learned through these few years of parenting &#39;my&#39;<br/>
children that any happy learning they do needs be from them and not me.<br/>
They won&#39;t even let me pick books to read together from the library anymore.<br/>
:P~~~<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s taken me, and I&#39;m still learning, a long time to be this layed back<br/>
with our learning experiences.  It&#39;s always a struggle especially when I get<br/>
the feeling yet again that I might still be doing it wrong somehow.  ;)<br/>

Take a cup or so of cornstarch, and add water already tinted green (about a tablespoon at a time and stir after each addition).  You will know you have the right consistency when you can squeeze it into a ball, but it will &quot;melt&quot; and run through your fingers.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577430625">White glue, cornstarch, water and borax, plus pigment of your<br/>
choice.  I use a bottle (8oz) of the world&#39;s most generic white<br/>
glue mixed with a half cup of cornstarch  in a mixing bowl.<br/>
Dissolve 1 tsp of borax in half a cup of water, tinted with food<br/>
coloring or paint pigment if desired.  Mix keep mixing if sticky.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great for playing with, because you can vary the recipe and<br/>
get very different results - much beyond  a factor of 3 and it<br/>
isn&#39;t much good, but with an afternoon to play a kid can observe<br/>
and record a bunch of  variations and have a great time doing it.<br/>
The trick is in the amount of borax, but if he likes the goop,<br/>
he&#39;ll figure that out.<br/>
<br/>
Make a paste of some more of the borax (or of cream of tartar)<br/>
and spread over blueberry stains in carpet; when it is dry,<br/>
vacuum, then remove any remaining stain with ammonia or ammonia,<br/>
plus a little wood alcohol.<br/>

<br/>
Yes - my kids  still &quot;reach out&quot; for things, even though they are not toddlers, - for things in our home, in our community - and I am there with them, spending time and talking. I think a lot of things can be learned by &quot;living life&quot; together - for example, we recently watched Jurassic Park. Ostensibly, we were just hanging out, watching  a video, because my 13 yo likes anything directed by Stepehn Spielberg. :-) However, the video sparked a huge interest in dinosaurs for the younger two - they have been looking at dinosaur books,  we bought dinosaur models, they have made and are playing a dinosaur game. We are &quot;learning Science&quot; and goodness knows what else just by hanging out together and following our passions/interests... Living life together...Leonie<br/>

&quot;Resources about history&quot; can <br/>
&gt; be family trips, movies, novels, conversation, trivia <br/>
books.  &quot;Resources <br/>
&gt; about history&quot; don&#39;t need to be lessons or books specifically about <br/>
history <br/>
&gt; in the traditional sense.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me for my timing, I have had struggled keeping up with the <br/>
volumes of posts on this list :0) <br/>
I know this is a late reply to this topic, but i just had to share. <br/>
My first sample for history for this years portfolio will be a family <br/>
trip to the Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. I am a descendant <br/>
of a famous football family that was pre-NFL. We are having a family <br/>
reunion at the Hall and we will get to see special archived items not <br/>
out in the display for the public to see. I have made a simple <br/>
website about my football heritage, will links to other articles <br/>
about these football brothers. I find it fascinating, but I am <br/>
biased :o)<br/>
Hope someone may enjoy this...<br/>
