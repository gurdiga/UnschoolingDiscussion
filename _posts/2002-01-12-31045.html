<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999776298">Women can be rabbi&#39;s. . . in fact, I know a couple of them. There is a huge <br/>
Jewish population here, and the women I know have been Rabbi&#39;s for a pretty <br/>
long time. . . I am thinking about 20 or 30 years. <br/>
<br/>
I guess where I come from on Dr. Laura is that she has some good points on <br/>
certain things and some things I strongly agree with and somethings I <br/>
strongly disagree with. She is extremely homophobic which I find so unusual <br/>
because I know quite a few Jewish people who are the most accepting of all <br/>
religions I have found. So, in my own personal life there are people that I <br/>
strongly disagree with on some issues. I try to not condemn the person and <br/>
see the good they have to offer to me. I am sure I have traits that others <br/>
find horrible and I would hope they would not judge me on that one thing or <br/>
whatever things they disagree with me on. <br/>
<br/>
I always find for myself when a person brings out a very stong reaction in <br/>
me, then it is time for me to look within because there is something there to <br/>
teach me. . . something about myself that I am resisting or disliking or some <br/>
other issue. It never fails for me. <br/>
