<div id="ygrps-yiv-817178814">I&#39;ve probably told you this before, Sandra.  My dad hates morning  glories, <br/>
as do most of the old folks we know.   They grow wild in the  cotton fields and <br/>
are a menace to those who had to pick cotton by hand.   They&#39;re considered <br/>
invasive weeds.  <br/>
 <br/>
I got to hear again how much he hated them 2 years ago when I planted a  <br/>
sunflower house and grew morning glories and moonflowers up the sunflower  stems.  <br/>
He just couldn&#39;t understand it.  <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s right about the cotton fields.  At the same house where we had  the <br/>
sunflower house, we were surrounded by cotton fields.  Cotton is highly  fumigated <br/>
and sprayed.  Yet, when I walked down the tractor paths in  the spring with <br/>
my dogs, there they were, where nothing but cotton could  live--morning glories <br/>
valiantly trying to clog the ends of the rows.  <br/>
 <br/>
I learned a little about why he hates them so much this last year in my  <br/>
vegetable garden.  The previous owners had planted morning glories there  before <br/>
and I couldn&#39;t stop them from growing up around my tomatoes and my  cucumbers.  <br/>
I finally just gave up and put some tomato cages near them so  they could <br/>
climb.  My cats LOVED to sit under the tomato cages in the hot  weather, under a <br/>
shade of morning glory vines.  Yet, the old seeds churned  way under by the <br/>
tiller sprouted all summer and I picked out little sprouts  until the frost.  <br/>
But I did pull all the vines out out while they  were still green and blooming, <br/>
before they went to seed. <br/>
 <br/>
I still love the way they look, but they simply *thrive* here and, like  <br/>
honeysuckle, one has to be sure that&#39;s what one REALLY wants.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
OH YEAH! <br/>
I forgot to mention that.<br/>
 <br/>
My dad used to get a farming magazine, and every issue had advertisements  <br/>
for stuff  that would kill &quot;bindweed&quot; and had beautiful photos of healthy  <br/>
morning glories. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll put your reminder in there.   And it&#39;s true, if people live  right next <br/>
to (or are engaged in) commercial farming, I&#39;m selling them  weeds.  Bummer.  <br/>
Still, it&#39;s not as crazy as shipping a tumbleweed,  which is the seeds of <br/>
thousands of its kind.   I don&#39;t think  tumbleweeds will grow in the eastern or <br/>
southern U.S., and I HOPE NOT now that  people have made it their business to <br/>
mail them around.  I hope they won&#39;t  grow in Japan.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And this:<br/>
 <br/>
My parents used to pick cotton.  My dad only picked his family&#39;s own  cotton, <br/>
but my mom&#39;s family were itenerant cotton pickers for most of the time  she <br/>
was growing up, and lived in little rental houses near cotton fields,  <br/>
different places different times.  She tells stories of being glad to have  little <br/>
brothers because it was easier to watch the babies in the shade of the  wagon <br/>
than it was to pick the cotton, which her older siblings were having to  do, and <br/>
which she and the younger boys eventually had to do too.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think the menace is to the pickers, but to the growers, as the  vines <br/>
can stunt or kill the plants or &quot;bind up&quot; the growth.  I could  be wrong.  <br/>
That one place in Texas was selling cotton too.  I could  plant some together <br/>
with morning glories and see which one wins. &lt;g&gt;   (But cotton won&#39;t grow very <br/>
well this far north.)<br/>
 <br/>
The morning glory and sunflower combo sounds pretty cool!  We have a  new <br/>
stand of bamboo we liberated from where a dumpster was being build last year  <br/>
(turned out it was for a new school being built out of an old warehouse grocery  <br/>
store).  I put sunflowers in front of it, figuring if the sunflowers want  to <br/>
hang too far over the driveway that I could tie them to the bamboo.<br/>

You&#39;re right.  My dad picked his family&#39;s own cotton.  Which  means he had to <br/>
get rid of the weeds in the rows.<br/>
 <br/>
Bamboo is invasive down here, too.  Also not native.  <br/>
 <br/>
Tumbleweeds probably wouldn&#39;t grow here, because it is so verdent and  green, <br/>
except in winter.  But even then there&#39;s something dormant holding  the soil <br/>
together.<br/>

 <br/>
After Karen mentioned them, I resolved to go and buy some seeds.<br/>
In the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, there used to be a common packet of seeds that had  two <br/>
or three kinds of morning glories, and moonflower.  And it seemed  that each <br/>
pack had 20 or 30 morning glory seeds and one or two moonflower  seeds (which <br/>
were bigger).<br/>
 <br/>
My sister had one come up, but mine never did that I know of.  <br/>
 <br/>
For a while, ten years or so back, I had Heavenly Blues, a particular  strain <br/>
of fancy morningglories.  The blooms are a little bigger, and the  seeds are <br/>
distinctive, and I used to pick those separate and have given lots  away.  <br/>
When we moved, I thought I&#39;d just get seeds back from someone  who&#39;d grown some, <br/>
but ended up never getting it together to do  that. <br/>
 <br/>
Unless you plant them new and keep the seeds separate and gather heavenly  <br/>
blues separate, they merge back into the various shades of pink and purple, it  <br/>
seems.   <br/>
 <br/>
There are some little wild morning glories here and the flowers are pale  <br/>
blue and small, and the vines are more dry and smaller, but I&#39;ve never tried  to <br/>
gather seeds from them even though they come up in my yard sometimes.<br/>

 <br/>
There&#39;s another thing that makes no sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people will practically freak out if people pull a deep-root weed  out <br/>
and don&#39;t get ALL of the roots.  We have two things growing that grow  from <br/>
roots here, vinka (sp?) and mint.  If we really wanted to get rid of  it we&#39;d <br/>
have to dig it out.  But if we just want to discourage it, pulling  it would be <br/>
discouraging.<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes people just love to overreact, I think.  The same people who  freak <br/>
out because you picked flowers or didn&#39;t water enough or disturbed  something <br/>
they DO want growing will freak out just as bad if you &quot;just&quot; pull  <br/>
dandelions out before the flowers go to seed, saying that won&#39;t kill the  plant.   <br/>
Well... it will keep the seeds from maturing.  That&#39;s  something.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- and you can&#39;t just throw &#39;em on the compost pile <br/>
either as they&#39;ll  just go nuts and contaminate your next garden anyhow!  <br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well, there is that, maybe.  But they shouldn&#39;t be using compost  that&#39;s less <br/>
than a year old anyway, if they don&#39;t want seeds from the year  before.  <br/>
Seeds will sprout and then the plants will die in the compost, or  they will rot <br/>
(if the compost is kept wet enough).  <br/>
 <br/>
Sounds like the going nuts was on the part of the people who were losing  con<br/>
trol of their garden.   All that advice to thin plants and to plant  them 3/8&quot; <br/>
deep (not 1/4 and not 1/2&quot;) seems to me to be over-controlling  behavior. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Better&quot; or just quicker?<br/>
 <br/>
Extending what I&#39;ve learned as a mom to other biological areas of the  world, <br/>
I don&#39;t think faster is always better, nor that nicking parts off is the  way <br/>
to go.  Too many people my age had too many parts nicked off of  them.   It <br/>
seems that seeds would really have the knowledge and  ability to become the <br/>
plant they need to be without people messing with  them.<br/>
 <br/>
I used to soak morning glory seeds or put them in wet paper towels (which,  <br/>
in New Mexico, don&#39;t stay wet unless you put all that in a plastic bag), but I  <br/>
figured out that the seeds probably really would rather be in wet DIRT, not <br/>
in  wet paper towel in a baggie on the counter.  So I just started planting  <br/>
them earlier and watering them more.<br/>

When I had the huge patch of tumbleweeds (Russian Thistle) I was told that same thing.  Don&#39;t pull them because where you pull one, several more will come up.  That apparently is not true, because every year I&#39;ve had fewer and fewer.  The trick is to grab the plant just above the dirt and pull slowly so as to get all or most of the tap root out.  It is easisest when the plant is smaller and is not an unpleasant task if the weather is not too hot.  It is rather satisfying when the entire root comes up in once piece.  With larger plants, it helps to use a garden fork or spade to loosen the soil.  Tumbleweed seedlings are quite easy to identify because of the red coloring.  As Sandra Dodd wrote, &quot;Most of that red stem/root was under the ground, but as they grow the stem is red at first, when they do start stretching up. There&#39;s nothing the least bit red later on.&quot;  Sandra Dodd, &quot;Tumbleweeds,&quot; n.d., &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tumbleweeds">http://sandradodd.com/tumbleweeds</a>&gt; (2 May 2005) <br/>

I think that&#39;s up there with cut your hair to make it grow. Unadulterated  <br/>

 <br/>
We were told that kind of things about cholla cactus too, but it just  simply <br/>
makes NO sense whatsoever.  Whether you cut it, pull it, shove it  over, <br/>
stack it to rot or burn it, it&#39;s being severely discouraged. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

The roots just rot in the ground as far as I know.  The seed makes  the whole <br/>
plant.  They&#39;re not annuals, in other words, and always come up  from seeds.<br/>

Better, in my case.  The ones I tried growing without nicking only had about<br/>
a 50% germination rate, the nicked ones all grew.  I watered all of them the<br/>
same, since I start them in flats inside.  All of the veggies, annuals and<br/>

even some orchids.  It,s beautiful.<br/>

We have 3 huge potted tropical-type plants on our patio and they get<br/>
completely stripped of foliage every time we have a typhoon�sometimes 3 a<br/>
month�and for 2 years now, they have always come back. When I think of all<br/>
the digging my kids do in the pots and the odd stuff they toss in there,<br/>
�for the plants to eat�  I really can�t believe the things are alive at all.<br/>
It sometimes makes me wish for a yard�we have large balcony/patio things on<br/>
two levels that wrap 3/4 around the house on two levels, but nothing else.<br/>
Oh well�bikes, scooters, and trucks grow well out there, and we often get a<br/>
good crop of sidewalk chalk drawings!<br/>

I&#39;ve  probably told you this before, Sandra.  My dad hates morning<br/>
glories,<br/>
as do most of the old folks we know.   They grow wild  in the  cotton fields<br/>
and<br/>
are a menace to those who had to pick  cotton by hand.   They&#39;re considered<br/>
invasive  weeds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH YEAH!<br/>
I forgot to mention that.<br/>
<br/>
My dad used to get a farming magazine, and every issue had advertisements<br/>
for stuff  that would kill &quot;bindweed&quot; and had beautiful photos of healthy<br/>
morning glories. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put your reminder in there.   And it&#39;s true, if people live  right next<br/>
to (or are engaged in) commercial farming, I&#39;m selling them  weeds.  Bummer.<br/>
Still, it&#39;s not as crazy as shipping a tumbleweed,  which is the seeds of<br/>
thousands of its kind.   I don&#39;t think  tumbleweeds will grow in the eastern<br/>
or<br/>
southern U.S., and I HOPE NOT now that  people have made it their business<br/>
to<br/>
mail them around.  I hope they won&#39;t  grow in Japan.<br/>

lol.  It seems to me that Japan must get much more rain than Albq., as  does <br/>
Arkansas, and that&#39;s what makes morning glories a weed.  But we  don&#39;t get as <br/>
much rain as the Pacific Northwest, where I&#39;ve been told they think  English <br/>
Ivy is an invasive weed and not to be planted.  I&#39;ve always wanted  a an oak <br/>
covered in English Ivy, but it has never happened for me in  Arkansas.  (need <br/>
more deep shade and fewer hot summers)<br/>
 <br/>
Just a little lesson in biodiversity, I guess.<br/>

We don&#39;t have big oak trees (little scrub-oak in the mountains, kinda  <br/>
scrawny bushes that make little acorns and turn red in fall), but I did have ivy  <br/>
nearly kill a tree we have by choking it off, and it&#39;s going up another tree  <br/>
now.  It&#39;s beautiful on the tree, and I don&#39;t know when to decide to chop  it <br/>
back.  It&#39;s an Arizona cypress making a big shade in our front yard, and  the <br/>
ivy is six feet up or so, but not wrapped all around it.<br/>

More water would probably wrap it all around the tree.  Maybe not in  Albq. <br/>
(can you tell I can&#39;t remember how to spell it?), but around here we can  cut <br/>
vines during the growing season with abandon and they will make themselves  new <br/>
again in a matter of days.  The honeysuckle on the fence was cut from  12&#39; <br/>
across all the way to the ground in February (it hadn&#39;t even gone completely  <br/>
dormant), and now it has filled up all of a 4 feet section of fence and half way <br/>
 through the 4&#39; sections on either side.  I go out every day and pull  <br/>
tendrils away from the hostas growing in its shade.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826836695">Field Bindweed is a member of the morning glory family, as are those Heavenly <br/>
Blue morning glories, and sweet potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
Morning Glories are annuals in most of the US - they grow from seed each year <br/>
and won&#39;t overwinter. Field Bindweed is a perenial, storing 2 to 3 years <br/>
worth of food in an extensive underground root network. It can regrow from very <br/>
small pieces of root left behind after cultivation. Like morning glory, bindweed <br/>
is a vining plant, twining around whatever it encounters on it&#39;s way upward <br/>
to the sky. <br/>
<br/>
Field bindweed flowers start out white and turn pink. They look like morning <br/>
glory flowers but are usually smaller. The leaves are narrower than morning <br/>
glory leaves, more of an arrowhead shape than a heart shape.<br/>
