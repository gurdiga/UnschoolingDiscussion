 </span></blockquote>Its very strained. She can&#39;t help making little critical comments about how the kids will go to Oxford Univerisyt if they play Play-station all day. When I try and explain unschooling she is sneering<br/>
etc etc<br/>
The woman is driving me crazy!!!!!!<br/>
Sh&#39;e&#39;s also going on about food and exercise (my poor dog has had about 20 walks in 2 days cos the woman is a compulsive exerciser).<br/>
She&#39;s commented on Rhodri&#39;s beautiful long strawberry blond hair and said it would look nice on a girl.<br/>

Argh.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that it does.  I, too, have strawberry blond hair.  It is<br/>
striking and almost everytime I go somewhere I have total strangers<br/>
comment on it.  My hair is really long, too, and today I am getting it<br/>
cut really short (I&#39;m nervous).  [I&#39;ve been told by strangers to never<br/>
cut my hair, too.]  I&#39;ve been growing it really long to donate to Locks<br/>
of Love.  So, if your son is ever wanting to cut his hair, have him<br/>
check out  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.locksoflove.com">http://www.locksoflove.com</a>  Red and strawberry blond hair are<br/>
the most needed.  <br/>
