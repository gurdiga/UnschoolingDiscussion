<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990419335">and therefore so will our nights!<br/>
<br/>
My husband is seriously thinking of moving his office home. Something we <br/>
have had in past years but never in this house with this many children and <br/>
this particular occupation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure how this will all work out with our family situation. It <br/>
changes a lot once I start thinking about it. What about the kids making <br/>
noise? What about the house being alive so early in the morning? What about <br/>
the kids natural habit of sleeping late and going to bed late? They may be <br/>
able to be undisturbed early in the a.m. but I won&#39;t be and if I have to <br/>
wake early then I won&#39;t be staying up late like they are all use to now. <br/>
Does this mean no more soccer games in the hall during the day? Will we have <br/>
to take ALL our play outside like &quot;normal&quot; people?<br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, what I thought I would have loved most, having Joe home all <br/>
day, is stressing me out. What about the kids and what we have been use to <br/>
for ages now??<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any experience with this? I&#39;m thinking it will actually disrupt <br/>
our unschooling life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050147568">Mary,<br/>
We have had that situation for nearly a year. In the beginning it was <br/>
difficult, especially during summer when other neighbor kids were over too <br/>
and the noise level went up. There were adjustments on both sides, we did <br/>
have to learn to tone things down a bit. But my hubby says he became <br/>
accustom to it (the noise) . Kind of like moving next to a busy street when <br/>
you&#39;ve had quiet before. Pretty soon you don&#39;t even hear the noise.<br/>
It is great eating lunch together and if I have to run an errand or go to <br/>
the dentist it has worked well. We have saved a bundle on gas, his commute <br/>
was really bad before and he pops in to play a game or take a few minutes <br/>
to read with the kids when he wants to take a break. He welcomes it now <br/>
when the kids want to come and ask him something or show him their artwork <br/>
etc.<br/>
On the down side I would definitely recommend a separate phone line and an <br/>
office area where he can actually close a door.<br/>
I just love having him here. It feels so cozy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596193054">My husband works in the film business, so it has always been some months<br/>
home and some months away at work 12 - 16  hour days for 6 days a week.<br/>
However 18 months ago it became apparent that he needed a knee<br/>
replacement, and his is still in the final stages of recovering from the<br/>
surgery. He has been home, on worker&#39;s compensation for the whole time.<br/>
It has been a wonderful blessing for us to have him here for so much of<br/>
Jayn&#39;s toddlerhood. I think she would really miss him if he wasn&#39;t<br/>
around. Of course he is not trying to get work accomplished, but does<br/>
spend a lot of time on the computer and his ham radios in our &quot;office&quot;<br/>
in the dining room. We live in a one bedroom apartment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband absolutely hates Jayn&#39;s habit of sleeping late, and mine.<br/>
Regardless of what I may have accomplished in the morning in my pyjamas,<br/>
I have not &quot;started my day&quot; unless I am dressed. I have noticed that<br/>
Jayn&#39;s most enriched play happens in the night after dinner, but he<br/>
still gets upset that she is late to bed. However, he blames me for her<br/>
sleep habits, and not her. He&#39;s probably right. I still like to live<br/>
theater hours, after a life in the theater. Unfortunately it sometimes<br/>
leads to harsh words between us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes dream of the larger home we will one day have, with James<br/>
and all his electronic /computer junk in a shed at the bottom of the<br/>
garden. But then I will probably miss having him around. Sometimes he<br/>
gets snippy about the house not being clean enough, particularly when he<br/>
hasn&#39;t been home to see what all Jayn and I have been doing all day<br/>
instead of cleaning up her toys. Another reason to dream of a house<br/>
where there might actually be a playroom to at least store Jayn&#39;s toys<br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What amazes me is how helpless he is - I don&#39;t mean because of his knee<br/>
- he can now walk fine. He will literally sit around for hours being<br/>
hungry and cranky, until I cook breakfast. &quot;Why don&#39;t you just cook<br/>
yourself some bacon and eggs?&quot;. Also I end up fetching his drinks, and<br/>
doing all of his word processing for different hobbies etc for him.<br/>
Beware Mary! You could end up being an administrative assistant/gopher.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But in the end, I like that he is with us so much.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally do prefer Jon to work outside the home for his sake <br/>
as much as mine. I like when he has other people to interact <br/>
with besides us and I like when we have that freedom at home to <br/>
do what we want without the extra pressure to accomodate his <br/>
needs for quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m right with you.<br/>
<br/>
But in our case, it&#39;s also inevitable that he will be working form <br/>
home again. So we are already thinking about what to do.<br/>
<br/>
Can you husband work in a room that is not where you are? My <br/>
dh worked upstairs when we had him home before. This time <br/>
he&#39;d be in an office that has a door that we close. If we can keep <br/>
him &quot;sealed off&quot; we can have more freedom to be noisy if we <br/>
must.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it helped us when I would let him know our daily schedule <br/>
so that he could plan for the work that took more concentration <br/>
for when we were out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how involved your dh is in parenting when he&#39;s <br/>
home, but mine is very involved and that was also a distraction <br/>
for him. If he wonders what everyone&#39;s doing or if they are doing <br/>
what they &quot;should.&quot; I know now it will be easier now that we are <br/>
unschooling since he buys into the philosophy. Before we were <br/>
trying to make sure certain things got done. :)<br/>
<br/>
Well, not a lot of help, but lots of empathy. Good communication <br/>
is the key.<br/>

 our unschooling life. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it does interfere with the free flow of things at times. We are forunate <br/>
in that dh isn&#39;t in his &quot;office&quot; (a desk in the middle of the entry area) <br/>
much. He is out building most of the time.<br/>
But yeah, it does affect things. I think the fact that he needs to go to bed <br/>
earlier than us affects things more than the working at home issue. The kids <br/>
have learned to tone it down after certain hours. Dh has also put a bed in <br/>
the basement we&#39;re finishing so he can go to sleep when we don&#39;t feel like <br/>
toning it down at night!! Poor guy.<br/>
He&#39;s so congenial about the whole thing though.<br/>
It takes some creative solutions to meet everyone&#39;s needs, but it is a <br/>
wonderful thing to have access to your spouse more often than the average <br/>
family.<br/>
Mark is able to work his schedule around things more often than not (there <br/>
ARE customers to keep happy, so it&#39;s not total freedom or anything) and he <br/>
works a lot less hours away from home than any other Dad I know, so the kids <br/>
get to spend a lot more time with both of us...which is really awesome.<br/>
And it enables me to enjoy a part time job, which I wouldn&#39;t even dream of if <br/>
dh wasn&#39;t home a lot.<br/>
There&#39;s positives and negatives about any work situation, you have to look at <br/>
the big picture and decide which outweighs the other.<br/>
For us, it&#39;s been extremely positive and we could never go back to having dh <br/>
work for someone else. I will be self employed in about 1.5 years from now, <br/>
after I complete massage therapy school. Yippeee!!<br/>

business purposes.<br/>
Part of my dh&#39;s frustration has been having his desk up here right in the <br/>

office space... great solution.<br/>

Well the thing here witht he noise is not really being a bother to my <br/>
husband. He spends a lot of time on the phone, and it&#39;s his clients that <br/>
would be bothered by it. Not sure it will sound very professional.<br/>
He will definitely have another business line and we would be putting the <br/>
&quot;office&quot; in our bedroom. That&#39;s really the only place for it. The <br/>
office/library/computer room is all open and not an option. We really have <br/>
no other room on our house. The bedroom is plenty big enough for it. We <br/>
would just have to take out the couch that&#39;s in there now. Thing is, our <br/>
bedroom is right by the playroom and other bathroom and at the end of the <br/>
hall. (there goes those soccer games again!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629405595">If my husband, who is TOTALLY a morning person, worked from home, he would be <br/>
up bonking around at 6:00 a.m.  When we were childless I remember MANY times <br/>
reminding him the neighbors might still be asleep, so not to use power tools, <br/>
and I remember him seeming very resentful about the very idea that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t use power tools at 7:00 on a Sunday morning on his own personal 1/10 <br/>
of an acre!<br/>
<br/>
But if he did need to work from home, I would just tell the kids that that&#39;s <br/>
the deal.  If his job makes the house payment, they need to live with <br/>
whatever noise is involved, even if it&#39;s him singing along to sea shanties or <br/>
something.   If they woke up every morning naturally (from unnatural noise <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) they would naturally start going to sleep earlier after a while.<br/>

around here. He also spends a lot of time with the children too. When he <br/>
comes home from work, he spends about 2 hours just with the kids. If <br/>
anything, having him home soon might get me some more time with him!! I <br/>
don&#39;t worry about all that. I do worry though about the kids and I having a <br/>

&gt; My husband is seriously thinking of moving his office home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is involved in &quot;his office&quot; -- is it just him and computer in a<br/>
designated room, or is it him, an assistant, a secretary, and clients<br/>
dropping by from 8 to 5? :)<br/>
<br/>
Our &quot;office&quot; is at home -- there&#39;s a computer desk on my side of the bed,<br/>
and a computer desk on Wally&#39;s side of the bed. Our commute is brutal -- we<br/>
have to actually turn over and fall out of bed onto our desk chairs, LOL.<br/>
And our girls are often to be found sprawled all over said bed while we&#39;re<br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
We have no clients coming by. We have no set work hours. It doesn&#39;t affect<br/>
our sleeping patterns or playing patterns or housekeeping (well, except that<br/>
if we&#39;re busy with work the housekeeping falters before playtime does &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking at worst-case-scenario -- i.e, he has specific hours of<br/>
operation and has clients coming by -- I&#39;d think it&#39;s going to mean more<br/>
changes for you than if he can set his own hours and is working via phone,<br/>
fax and computer line.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213520181">My husband works from home.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a government contractor and he has an office set up in the basement, with faxline, computer, phone, etc.<br/>
<br/>
He heads down to the basement in the morning, usually by 8am, and he comes up at lunchtime for about 1/2 an hour, and then goes back downstairs and comes up again around 5pm.<br/>
<br/>
It really doesn&#39;t affect our schedule at all.  I&#39;m usually up by 6am, since I have a nursling who gets up fairly early.  My older three children usually wake up between 8 and 9am.  The baby is down by 8pm and the older three usually straggle to bed between 9 and 10pm.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been doing this for almost 3 years.  The first six months were the hardest, as we each adjusted to the change, but now we wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
The children have been taught that when Daddy goes downstairs, he&#39;s working, just as if he worked away from home.  Unless it&#39;s an emergency, we try to stay out of his hair, but he doesn&#39;t mind being interrupted occasionally to show him something cool made with Legos, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s great for me!!!!  I can make dentist appointments or take the older children skating or to their piano lessons without having to worry about juggling all four children at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!!<br/>

&gt; down.  Then finally, laying down the law and turning the stuff off and the<br/>
&gt; lights out.. Then they go to sleep in about 15-20 mins.. Still, its a couple<br/>
&gt; hours after Dh NEEDS to be asleep.. And also NO &quot;private&quot; time for us. ..<br/>
&gt; So, what to do?   This is not something that can just &quot;work&quot; its self out.<br/>
&gt; Its already been almost 3 mos of sleep deprivation for him.   We dont have<br/>
&gt; months for them to self regulate or learn new principles.   We have ran out<br/>
&gt; of creative options.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t run out. :) It might feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
One option that leaps out to me immediately is to stay with the kids when<br/>
your husband goes to bed so that they&#39;re not rampaging through the house<br/>
while you&#39;re in one room &quot;warning&quot; them from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Haul out some good crafts or board games or reading books or a video and<br/>
stay up with them.<br/>
<br/>
This does, obviously, cut into the goal of having alone-time with your<br/>
husband every evening, but it&#39;s probably an unrealistic goal for now, for<br/>
most nights.<br/>
<br/>
So, look for your alone-time at more creative times of day -- get up early<br/>
together while the little darlings are asleep and spend an hour together<br/>
before he has to leave for work. Spend time together on a weekend afternoon<br/>
while the kids are at the neighbors or grandma&#39;s or sleeping in or<br/>
skateboarding in the kitchen ;).<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, as you work with them each evening and model for them and with<br/>
them doing quiet things after Dad&#39;s gone to bed, they&#39;re going to start<br/>
thinking of it on their own. But it definitely sounds like they need you up<br/>
at night with them now -- they&#39;ve shown that repeatedly until nighttime is a<br/>
war in the house instead of a nice peaceful calm time where Dad snoozes and<br/>
the rest of you do something fun but much quieter.<br/>

There are office noise tapes available that you can get.  I think.  <br/>
Your dh could play those when he talks with clients so it might cover <br/>
up the kid noise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Theresa,<br/>
<br/>
Can you be with the kids at night so dh can sleep?  If you can be <br/>
available for them in the late evening doing more quiet type things <br/>
like playing cards or another game, reading books together, watching a <br/>
movie with them with the volume down a bit and lights out or down low <br/>
it could be calming for the kids. (might induce sleepiness) How about <br/>
head phones for the television? and video games?<br/>
<br/>
  I think to have the transition work you need to be there for them <br/>
helping them along then eventually they will do it on their own.<br/>
<br/>
If dh is wanting time with you are the kids willing to be on their own <br/>
for a bit and you spend time with him before he goes to sleep then you <br/>
spend time with the kids after that?<br/>
<br/>
Helpful?<br/>

home, but mine is very involved and that was also a distraction<br/>
for him. If he wonders what everyone&#39;s doing or if they are doing<br/>
what they &quot;should.&quot; I know now it will be easier now that we are<br/>
unschooling since he buys into the philosophy. Before we were<br/>
trying to make sure certain things got done. :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband is very involved with the kids but not as far as wondering if <br/>
they are doing what they &quot;should&quot;. I might be afraid that he would be out <br/>
playing with them and not working like he &quot;should&quot;!!! I even asked him today <br/>
if that would be a problem. Him being tempted to come out and play!! I think <br/>
it&#39;s a real thought as he&#39;s looking into an office with cheaper rent!!!<br/>
<br/>
So he may move and he may still come home. Joe and I met while we worked <br/>
together and we both have worked together in business after that too. We get <br/>
along very well being together all day so that&#39;s not a problem at all. It&#39;s <br/>
just the flow of the house I worry about.<br/>
<br/>
Not definite yet. He&#39;s worried about having the business here for safety <br/>
reasons. Not that anything happened in the past but it&#39;s on his mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-603922853">Thanks Ren for the positive feedback. I have been real hesitant about Joe <br/>
coming home to work. Something I thought I would never feel. I remember how <br/>
sad Joseph was when Joe ended a home business years ago and wasn&#39;t around <br/>
like Joseph had been accustom to. I forgot about that and I also forgot <br/>
about how wonderful it was to have Joe home all the time, even if he was in <br/>
the bedroom most of the time. He was still THERE and we knew it and he would <br/>
come out often. He has free time now any time he wants it, but it&#39;s still <br/>
not the same. I do miss him being here.<br/>
<br/>
Now I feel really selfish. We can adjust easy enough. It would certainly be <br/>
worth it. Especially for Alyssa now. She&#39;s never known daddy to be home all <br/>
the time. The other kids remember. She asks every day where daddy is and if <br/>
we can go see him at the office. She&#39;s a daddys girl, something the other 2 <br/>
really weren&#39;t. He loves that!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again. I&#39;m actually thinking I will be disappointed now if he decides <br/>
to move instead!!!<br/>

aint gonna happen...LOL.. esp if I am up late with the kids.. I&#39;m not <br/>
&quot;interested&quot; enough in a booty call at 4am.    We already take advantage of <br/>
the weekend opportunities.. ( which are pretty rare).    Maybe I need to <br/>
&quot;move the party&quot; downstairs to the living room.  I could sit up and read or <br/>
watch TV with them.. .. The only other challange with me staying up late is <br/>
that I still have to get up at 7am and take Landon to school. BUT hes getting <br/>
his liscense soon and will driving himself.. so I could probably survive a <br/>
few more weeks.. I can always crawl back in bed when I get home from taking <br/>
him..    <br/>
<br/>
Well, this is maybe an alternative worth trying. thanks for the suggestion.<br/>

in their with them, they would be quieter.  I KNOW Dh, wouldnt really like <br/>
going to bed alone.. :-)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of it as an alternative, but as the first pass.  Until kids are <br/>
older, the parents can&#39;t both just go to bed at the same time and say &quot;Okay, <br/>
take care of yourselves quietly.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen that work.  I&#39;ve never really seen it tried.<br/>
<br/>
So once again our &quot;simple advice&quot; was incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
Here each child settles into something at some point.  A video, or being <br/>
online, or drawing or reading. Something.    Or the older kids might be <br/>
playing a card game, but they do that in the room farthest from sleepers and <br/>
they shut the door.  And I rarely go to bed before the youngest is taken care <br/>
of as far as practicalities--dressed for bed (if applicable), bed&#39;s made, <br/>
there&#39;s water, kleenex, whatever they might need.   Then if they have other <br/>
plans, going to bed won&#39;t be a problem when the time comes.<br/>
<br/>
Except in cases when I&#39;m too sick to stay awake, I don&#39;t go to bed and leave <br/>
the whole crowd going full speed.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when they have company there&#39;s more of a party atmosphere, and <br/>
that&#39;s okay with me.  Then I might go on to sleep with them all wide awake, <br/>
after making sure they have a plan for where the guests will sleep.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;You might be able to do some additional soundproofing between your bedroom <br/>
and the rest of the house. Can you trade out the playroom with a bedroom <br/>
(even if it&#39;s smaller) so the playroom noise is further away?<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what to do about the soccer games. &lt;g&gt; Maybe your dh and kids can <br/>
reach an agreement to have a set soccer game in the hall every day during <br/>
&quot;lunch hour&quot; ;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm.....now there&#39;s an idea. Soundproofing the bedroom. Could come in <br/>
handy. &lt;BEG&gt; The bedroom isn&#39;t finished anyway from when we moved in so it&#39;s <br/>
not like we would be messing it up. We would be doing ourselves a favor!!<br/>
<br/>
Moving the playroom, not a choice. It&#39;s in the back of the house and only <br/>
has a sliding glass door, pass through window from the kitchen and you have <br/>
to go through it to get to the pool and yard. Through the room not the <br/>
window! Not exactly an ideal bedroom!<br/>
<br/>
As far as organized soccer games, not very unschooly but it will have to do. <br/>
Either that or outside with the soccer net. Not as much fun though!!!<br/>
