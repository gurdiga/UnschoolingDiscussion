<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869424448">Hi All,<br/>
I am withdrawing from this Christian thread. I fail to see how this will benefit Brianna & me in any way. I was raised Catholic, lived in a Catholic home, in a Catholic neighborhood, attended Catholic school; entered a convent. I later left the convent.  Later, I rec&#39;d my degree in history; I took many classes on religion; anthropology of religion, etc. I am now a pagan. A tree hugging, dirt worshipping, daughter of the Goddess. This works for us. <br/>
BTW - thanks for the urls.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Janis<br/>
