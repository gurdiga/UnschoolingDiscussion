<div id="ygrps-yiv-733892704">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever required my kids to stay in something they wanted to<br/>
quit.  I have discussed it with them - Did it not turn out to be what they<br/>
wanted or expected? (which, I think, has been the case most of the time),<br/>
Did things change on them?  (a musical dd was involved in added a bunch of<br/>
Saturday rehearsals at the last minute (along with the Wednesday<br/>
rehearsals), and we were already busy those Saturdays.  That time, we talked<br/>
about it with the director and dd just missed a few (she was only a chorus<br/>
member)), How would they feel if they left?, or How would they feel if they<br/>
stayed? But I emphasize to them that the choice is all theirs.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are pretty persistent in things they care about so that&#39;s not a<br/>
concern of mine.<br/>
