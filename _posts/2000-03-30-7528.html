<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151685271">I have a paper mache project to work on.  It calls for wheat paste.  Is there <br/>
a paste I can make from common household stuff, or do I have to buy something <br/>
specific?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685188033">Thanks, Bridget-- I also remembered that Nat&#39;l Geog. Mags often have great <br/>
pull-outs, maps and such, and  a constellation diagram could  possiblybe <br/>
found,too.  Likewise, newsstands and bookstores carry such an array of mags., <br/>
that it is likely there are mags. about astronomy with all kinds of diagrams <br/>
available. Sorry to go on and on, I guess I&#39;m on a roll...:)                    <br/>
