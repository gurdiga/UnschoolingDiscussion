<div id="ygrps-yiv-691156512">My mother was Mommy until I was about 6 or 7, and then it went to Ma, in <br/>
that clipped off Irish way, just like my brothers did and she did to her <br/>
own mother. I thought my friends who called their moms mommy were <br/>
babies!  Now Mom and Ma are interchangeable.  When we moved to Arkansas <br/>
when I was 11, I tried out &quot;Mama&quot; and she said, &quot;Don&#39;t you dare!&quot;.  lol.<br/>
<br/>
I was called Mama first (my kids were all born and raised in the South) <br/>
and now it&#39;s Mom, except when they have more time to talk or they want <br/>
something.  ;)  &quot;Mommy&quot; didn&#39;t sit well with me because it still carried <br/>
that &quot;helpless baby whining&quot; connotation to me from when I was 8.  lol.<br/>
<br/>
Being raised in Chicago those first 11 years, though, my mom&#39;s mother <br/>
was Gramma to all the grandkids, until all the big burly Irish <br/>
boy-cousins became tough talking teens and they shortened it to Gram. <br/>
 We all followed suit.  (They shortened everyone&#39;s name, though...I was <br/>
called Kar(e)...no one has ever shortened my name except them.)  Then <br/>
she passed and my oldest son was born (just that quick) and my mother <br/>
became just Gram from the very start, and she&#39;s always been very happy <br/>
about it.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-85624963">Just wanted to say thanks, you guys, for sharing what you call your mom/dad/relatives.<br/>
I have personally never heard an adult woman call their mom &quot;mommy&quot;, other than me and my sis&#39;s.<br/>
So I guess it&#39;s not so bad afterall. I don&#39;t feel so weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927706035">We use Auntie, too. :) And Brittany usually calls me Mama (when asking <br/>
questions, &quot;Mama, why does...?&quot; and &quot;Mommy!&quot; when she needs me from a<br/>
distance &lt;g&gt;). Michael-Anne still calls me Mommy, mostly. Both, when in the<br/>
mood, roll their eyes and call me &quot;Mom&quot;. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Both Grandmas are Grandma (Grandma Mary and Grandma Judi for clarification)<br/>
and Papa (Wally&#39;s Dad) is just Papa since the girls only have one of those.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to be Grandmama some day. &lt;g&gt; I wonder if I can put in a bid with<br/>
them now?<br/>
