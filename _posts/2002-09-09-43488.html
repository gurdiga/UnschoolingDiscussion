<div id="ygrps-yiv-686389269">**&gt;&lt;&lt; great danes and 18 year old virgins. or vice versa. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;18 year old great danes?<br/>
&gt;That would put some people off porn forever, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A wonderuful Danish person having sex with a virgin, what could possibly<br/>
be <br/>
wrong with that??<br/>
See how tricky those word things can be? LOL!**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me... (and this is NOT a sexual reference) ... we have a<br/>
book called Shrink Lits, with funny poems summarizing and parodying<br/>
great works of literature.<br/>
<br/>
The one for Beowulf includes the immortal words &quot;Monster Grendel&#39;s<br/>
tastes are plainish.  Breakfast?  Just a couple Danish.&quot;<br/>
