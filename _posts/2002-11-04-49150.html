<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289884559">I remember someone&#39;s daughter looking for a Barbie skateboard (Ren?) but<br/>
thought maybe other girls might like one too.  So,  I  just received the<br/>
Fisher-Price Xmas catalog and it&#39;s in there.  You can order online at<br/>
Fisher-price.com or 800-747-8697<br/>
It&#39;s F7-P77559...$22.  and of course they even have pink and purple<br/>
protective gear if she wants to go all out! <br/>
<br/>
Just thought this might save someone from hunting it down in December.<br/>
And no I don&#39;t make commision off of it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
