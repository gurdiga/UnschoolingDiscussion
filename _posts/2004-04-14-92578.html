<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187247249">The best thing about Alison McKee&#39;s book (From Homeschool to College and <br/>
Work) is that she details exactly how they went about constructing a functional <br/>
document that colleges found useful and informative, entirely after the fact, <br/>
when their son suddenly changed his mind and wanted to head to college, thus <br/>
showing that it&#39;s possible, if stressful, to pull it together without clear <br/>
records.<br/>
