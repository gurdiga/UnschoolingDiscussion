QUIET  when the &quot;teacher&quot; is speaking!!! &lt;BWEG&gt;<br/>

Hi, Kelly --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I would call it a &quot;funshop&quot; but Marty Layne did a cool<br/>
discussion-starting thing in a session at the Sacramento conference. <br/>
(Two years ago?)<br/>
<br/>
Her workshop was on burnout.  She asked for people to describe in a few<br/>
words what kind of burnout related problems they were having.  She wrote<br/>
these on the white board until it was full.  Then she gave everyone<br/>
three votes and quickly tabulated which items on the list people were<br/>
interested in.  Then, starting with the top vote getter she had people<br/>
in the room raise their hands (?) and give their suggestions about how<br/>
to handle the problem.  (She may have encouraged only concrete stuff<br/>
from people who had experienced the same problems, I don&#39;t remember.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a neat way to harness the knowledge of the experienced<br/>
homeschoolers in the room.  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose lots of variations on this format (or other formats) are possible.<br/>

Hi, Kelly --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s a great speaker and a great personality, however I think anybody<br/>
could &quot;facilitate&quot; a discussion in this fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I think your conference sounds great, but I live in California on a tiny<br/>
budget, so I&#39;m not at all likely to come.  (I only have to drive for a<br/>
little over an hour to get to the Sacramento conference.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you have another fabulous event, though.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  (Don&#39;t shoot me, but how hard is it to get a bunch of<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling moms to talk? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
PPS  (Maybe I&#39;ve been deleting too fast, but I don&#39;t remember seeing you<br/>
begging people for funshop ideas.  Have you been noodgeing them off-list?)</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not too hard! &lt;G&gt; But it&#39;s not just talking---we want fun, hands-on things <br/>
going on all weeknd. Last year we had funshops on soap-making, static <br/>
electricity, playing with your food, tricks that&#39;ll impress and gross-out <br/>
your friends, kudzu basket weaving, paper making, budget games to make, <br/>
hand-spinning, Mother Goose Rhymes, magicians, artists (slide show, <br/>
UNweaving, and UNequilibrious art) among other things! So it&#39;s more than <br/>
&quot;just talking&quot;.<br/>
