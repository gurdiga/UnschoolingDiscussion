<div id="ygrps-yiv-1225050455">I also have FMS...or at least that&#39;s the best diagnosis there is so far.<br/>
(I&#39;ll be checking out the link to NAET (?) that was posted...thanks for the<br/>
tip).<br/>
<br/>
The description that was allured posted was pretty good and I definitely<br/>
agree about Devin Starland&#39;s books.  Excellent resource.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been dealing with this condition for at least 10 years, diagnosed for<br/>
the last 7 or 8.  It can be very debilitating and frustrating.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
fortunate because my doctors believe me.  OTOH if one more person tells me<br/>
that I&#39;ll feel better if I exercise...!!!...well, it will not be pretty.<br/>
Pretty hard to exercise when my goal for the week is to get dressed more<br/>
days than not.  I often have to use a wheelchair when I go out.  For the<br/>
last several months, if there is not someone around to push my chair I can&#39;t<br/>
go anywhere.  The most recent doc assures me that the odds are in my favor<br/>
that I will have a remission, especially since I&#39;ve been in such pain for so<br/>
long.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendations:  Do anything that feels like it will be helpful.  I&#39;ve<br/>
had more than one doc tell me that I can probably do more for myself than<br/>
they&#39;ll be able to do for me.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be afraid to insist on pain meds if you need them and don&#39;t be afraid<br/>
to fire any doc that won&#39;t listen to you.  If the office staff is not<br/>
cooperative and you can&#39;t gain access to the doctor, find another.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel that if you have to take time off from normal every day<br/>
activities that your children will suffer irreparable harm.  They&#39;ll simply<br/>
grow in a different direction than you had originally planned.<br/>
<br/>
Learn all you can about this condition or any others that may mimic it.  I&#39;m<br/>
not confident that I have a complete diagnosis at this time, but the docs<br/>
have pursued every reasonable path to try to identify something else.  Until<br/>
more is learned or there is reason to repeat tests, I&#39;m stuck with FMS as a<br/>
primary diagnosis.  Unfortunately, insurance companies try to use the &#39;it<br/>
doesn&#39;t exist/isn&#39;t a real illness&#39; excuse to deny assistance.  I&#39;m starting<br/>
the battle now for a power chair.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re comfortable with joining a support group, I highly recommend it!<br/>
An online group is great because you don&#39;t actually have to GO someplace to<br/>
participate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll add to the other offer...if there is anything I can do to help, feel<br/>
free to send me a note on or off list (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Brownville77@...">Brownville77@...</a>).  I&#39;d be happy<br/>
to help in any way I can.  This can be a very lonely condition.  I&#39;m lucky<br/>
if I get out more than once a week these days.  Getting to a doctor or any<br/>
other appointment is a major ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps,<br/>
