<br/>
i think some, perhaps even most births, are traumatic.   but i for one had a<br/>
great birth - he was born in water with a 3 hr labor so it was easy and with no<br/>
intervention - he just popped out of his own accord, 5 weeks early:)   i realize<br/>
this was true of this birth and every birth is different.  so in the advent that<br/>
a birth is traumatic (a shoulder get stuck, a breech presentation etc.),<br/>
especially if there&#39;s a lot of physical intervention (i.e. lots of yanking,<br/>
pulling, twisting, suctioning etc.) a parent would probably be well advised to<br/>
seek out a chiropractor.<br/>
<br/>
in response to what they did before chiro&#39;s,  my guess would be they probably<br/>
did lots of massaging so the muscles didn&#39;t get stuck and maintain the<br/>
misalignment, but rather the muscles would be encouraged, through the act of<br/>
massage, to relax and resume their original positions thereby correcting and<br/>
pulling the bones back into the proper places. in many cultures there have been<br/>
and are lots and lot of rituals surrounding the days following a birth (some<br/>
extend for a month or more), i would be surprised if these rituals didn&#39;t<br/>
address (on some level) the issue of the birth process and aid in the child&#39;s<br/>
transition (physical, emotionally and spiritually) from the womb.<br/>

&gt; maybe you and some others with an understanding of chiro can help me see what<br/>
&gt; the justification for birth being so traumatic is?  how can something so<br/>
&gt; natural by design cause such havoc on the system?  what did people do before<br/>
&gt; chiropractic?  i have heard this before but it has never made sense to me and<br/>
&gt; i am willing to listen...  also, why the continual adjustments?  what do we<br/>
&gt; keep doing to ourselves in the course of our days where we&#39;d need to keep<br/>
&gt; going and going to keep getting adjusted?  i guess the thought of being so<br/>
&gt; dependent is unappealing, too.<br/>
