<div id="ygrps-yiv-231111505">Logan, my three year old son, just accidentally knocked over Paul&#39;s ashtray on the desk. I just waited to see what he&#39;d do. He said &quot;Oops&quot; then picked up the ashtray and asked me to hold it. He picked up the butts and dropped them into the ashtray, then got a wet-wipe and wiped up the ashes from the desktop. Then he said &quot;Thanks&quot; and took the ashtray from me and put it back down where it&#39;d been. <br/>
 <br/>
I kinda wish Paul had been awake to see it...he can over-react to messes and thinks my non-reacting &quot;well, let&#39;s clean this up&quot; and &quot;making messes on purpose isn&#39;t a good idea because then someone else has to stop what they&#39;re doing to clean it up, or some one could get hurt from the spill or stepping on the toy&quot; kind of attitude is wrong and letting them be irresponsible, etc. <br/>
 <br/>
But judging by that...I don&#39;t think so....and overall, here lately Logan is starting to take more care of his things on his own like taking his plate to the sink after eating or offering to help me if I&#39;m doing something. I&#39;d rather have that attitude than &quot;chores&quot; done with a grump or sulk.<br/>

I see it more and more with my kids as time goes on, and it is *so* sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Holly and Keith discovered cat puke on a windowsill.  We joked <br/>
that it was good that it was a north window where it was refrigerated and not <br/>
south, where it would have cooked.    I expected that after the chit chat, I <br/>
would clean it up.  But Holly went and got a wet paper towel, and I left the room <br/>
without making a deal about it (but feeling happy).  In a while she came and <br/>
said that it was too dried up to get.  I told her to just leave a wet rag on it <br/>
and I&#39;d clean it up later, then.<br/>
<br/>
But it was puke and it didn&#39;t default to me-the-mom!!<br/>
<br/>

And I think the kids blossom and get bigger from doing adult things because <br/>
they want to, instead of kid-things they have to do because they&#39;re small.<br/>
