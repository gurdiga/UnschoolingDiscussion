<div id="ygrps-yiv-441478073">I&#39;ve been pondering this ever since an argument broke out on another <br/>
message group between some Well-Trained Mind homeschoolers and some <br/>
unschoolers, and the last comment in the discussion was that we all <br/>
choose our method based on a combination of our own learning styles <br/>
and our children&#39;s learning styles.  I was wondering how true this is.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about the way I learned, and I was a verbal/linguistic <br/>
learner with just enough logical/mathematical ability to do well in <br/>
school.  For me, reading is the key to learning.  I always broke out <br/>
in hives when I had a teacher who preferred to have us work in groups <br/>
or do projects or play games.  I just wanted to read the book and <br/>
take the test and that&#39;s that.  Even in college, I did well in <br/>
the &quot;lecture&quot; portion of science classes but I was such an idiot in <br/>
labs that one T.A. forgot his English and started screaming at me in <br/>
Chinese.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I wanted to homeschool before I had kids, and I assumed it <br/>
would be all the things I loved about school -- lots of books and <br/>
workbooks (I even bought workbooks for K-6 and kept them in a box <br/>
until finally the last time we moved I threw them in a dumpster).<br/>
<br/>
My son had his own reality.  I had all the books about child <br/>
development and I made charts on the computer and printed them out <br/>
for my binder.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he didn&#39;t do anything according to the schedule of child <br/>
development.  He didn&#39;t walk &quot;on time&quot;, or talk &quot;on time&quot;, or use the <br/>
potty &quot;on time&quot;.  Meanwhile, he was exploring his environment and <br/>
coming up with all kinds of great stuff that wasn&#39;t even on the <br/>
charts.  He was about two when I threw away the books and charts (and <br/>
that was before I even knew how late he&#39;d actually talk or use the <br/>
potty).<br/>
<br/>
So because of the clash between his learning style and mine, I was <br/>
forced to explore multiple intelligences and unschooling.  But I <br/>
wonder ... if he was more like me, maybe I&#39;d be one of the Well-<br/>
Trained Mind parents, or Charlotte Mason (that&#39;s the kind of <br/>
education I wish I&#39;d had!).  If I was homeschooled, I&#39;d want my <br/>
parents to give me a huge stack of books and send me to my room.  My <br/>
son would be devastated if he had to spend time in a room by himself <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any insight into this?  Do we choose unschooling <br/>
because of our learning style or our child&#39;s learning style or <br/>
because it&#39;s &quot;right&quot;?  If you had a child who loves to read and do <br/>
workbooks, would you school at home instead?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556830481">Okay, I am new to homeschooling and new to this list, but, I&#39;d like <br/>
to share my thoughts. I think we do need to have a teaching style <br/>
that works best for our children, no matter what we would like to <br/>
consider ourselves. Otherwise, they aren&#39;t learning as much as they <br/>
could be. And, I think all homeschooling families are a big mixture <br/>
of styles, whether they know it or not. I&#39;m sure unschooling families <br/>
still read books, and Well-Trained Mind or others still go on hands <br/>
on field trips once in a while. The advantage to homeschooling, or <br/>
maybe we should just call it homelearning, to suit everyone, is that <br/>
we can pick and choose what we like, what works for us, and what <br/>
doesn&#39;t. I think those of us that were schooled traditionaly growing <br/>
up, feel that we need a style to call ourselves, so that we can <br/>
better explain to others what we are doing. It is kinda difficult to <br/>
explain to someone, &quot;well, sometimes we read books, and sometimes we <br/>
watch the discovery channel, and then sometimes we just go out in the <br/>
back yard and dig for bugs&quot;. lol It&#39;s all learning, and our kids will <br/>
get all the knowledge and skills they need, one way or the other. <br/>
And, think about it, aren&#39;t we still learning? So, if they don&#39;t get <br/>
it all from us, they&#39;ll learn it themselves. And, possibly, every <br/>
year it will change, as our children change. I think little ones need <br/>
a little more structure, to start out their learning, but as they <br/>
grow, and become more independant, they can go off on thier own more. <br/>
Basically, it all comes down to the fact that we need to just do what <br/>
works for us, our own families. We don&#39;t have to be accountable to <br/>
anyone but our kids. Learn from them, as they will learn from us, and <br/>
everyone will be happy. :) <br/>
<br/>
Wow, as I re-read that I amazed myself! lol I am still trying to find <br/>
my &quot;style&quot; and methods, and I think I just did. I hope this all makes <br/>
sense to everyone, and maybe even helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516382822">&lt;&lt; It&#39;s all learning, and our kids will <br/>
<br/>
get all the knowledge and skills they need, one way or the other.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you get all the knowledge and skill you needed growing up?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One way or the other&quot; could be used to defend lots of dubious things.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think little ones need <br/>
<br/>
a little more structure, to start out their learning, but as they <br/>
<br/>
grow, and become more independant, they can go off on thier own more. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know for a fact that little ones do NOT need more structure, and that <br/>
structure can be the death of natural inquiry and peaceful learning.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t &quot;whatever@yahoogroups&quot; and it&#39;s not a subsidiary of &quot;whatever.com.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups,&quot; of www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Basically, it all comes down to the fact that we need to just do what <br/>
<br/>
works for us, our own families. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you feel so strongly about &quot;whatever&quot; this list will probably not be much <br/>
fun for you, because most of us have left the world of &quot;whatever&quot; to really <br/>
focus on how natural learning can work in our lives.<br/>

<br/>
The fact that they hate any kind of writing and told me so every day made me<br/>
question what I was  doing and look at other methods, which was when I<br/>
stumbled upon unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And in discovering unschooling, I realized that it was right not only for<br/>
them but I could see how much I needed it too.<br/>
<br/>
I love that my kids are different to me and I hate that my kids are<br/>
different to me. It&#39;s fantastic and frustrating at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, do we choose unschooling  because of our learning style or our<br/>
child&#39;s learning style or  because it&#39;s &quot;right&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think for all of those reasons. Because of our learning styles and those<br/>
of our children&#39;s it is right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304867966">&lt;&lt;&lt;Does anyone have any insight into this?  Do we choose unschooling<br/>
because of our learning style or our child&#39;s learning style or<br/>

<br/>
Sorcha&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
*I* choose unschooling because it speaks to my heart.  Yes, I feel it *IS* <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; way!  However, I think it is the right way for children, not all <br/>
parents.  I don&#39;t think many people are willing to commit to it deeply <br/>
enough to allow it to happen.  I think there are parents who would love <br/>
nothing more than for Kindergarten to start just to get a break.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know many children who, given the preferred circumstances (cooperative, <br/>
respectful, patient, loving parents), would balk at unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My Nicholette is a workbook junkie.  She craves &quot;homework&quot; and begs for it <br/>
daily.  So, yes, we &#39;school at home&#39; with her.  I consider it unschooling <br/>
because this is what SHE chooses.  I never ask her.  Her favorite store is a <br/>
local homeschooling store.  She runs wild from aisle to aisle, grabbing <br/>
anything and everything.  She pours through workooks, textbooks, kits, you <br/>
name it.  We generally have to devote an entire day to it because she isn&#39;t <br/>
reading fluently so she asks me to read her samples of each book to decide <br/>
which she likes best.  Currently, she is using a mix of Oak Meadow, <br/>
Singapore Math, Explode the Code and Getty Dubay Italics.  She wants me to <br/>
read her the teacher manuals aloud, so I do.  She likes taking tests to see <br/>
what she remembers.  She even asked me to buy gold stars to put on the pages <br/>
she completes.  She never asks me to grade them or anything, and I never <br/>
offer to.  Her books are full of gold stars and she beams with pride each <br/>
time she opens them. &lt;bwg&gt;  I suspect this is influence from her ps friends <br/>
and possibly our old ps and school at home days with her big sister.  Maybe <br/>
it will pass, maybe it won&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
Haleigh is a mix.  She will go months without picking up anything remotely <br/>
related to curriculum then suddenly bring in a textbook and ask me what she <br/>
should do.  Because I don&#39;t want her to feel like I *expect* her to do <br/>
textbook work, I turn the question around and ask her what looks <br/>
interesting.  She always has an answer, so that&#39;s what I suggest!  Last <br/>
week, she was holed up in her room till the wee hours reading the first <br/>
three Harry Potter books for the first time.  It took her a little under <br/>
four days to read them all.  She hasn&#39;t read since.  &lt;g&gt;  This week, she has <br/>
been on a cleaning spree, cleaning anything she can get her hands on.  Who <br/>
knows what next week will bring...<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I think you can school at home and still be an unschooler.  <br/>
Personally, I believe it is the direction of the child that constitutes <br/>
unschooling.  If you follow their lead, completely, you are allowing them to <br/>
unfold in their own way, in their own time.  So many unschoolers get wrapped <br/>
up in rejecting anything remotely related to public school.  Buzz words like <br/>
curriculum, lessons, and teaching scare them and send them in a defensive <br/>
frenzy.  Teaching a child how to bake bread is a lesson.  You&#39;re still <br/>
teaching.  It&#39;s still a lesson.  Heck, even the recipe is your guiding <br/>
&#39;curriculum&#39;!  Does that mean we should throw out baking bread because it <br/>
sounds schoolish???  I wouldn&#39;t but you can answer that question for <br/>
yourself......*you*, of course, being whomever *you* are...not pointing <br/>
fingers &lt;g&gt;...<br/>

I was just like you in school.  I could filter through material <br/>
quickly, ace the tests. etc.  When I first looked at unschooling, I <br/>
loved the concept but was too scared to trust my kids.  I bought the <br/>
workbooks and began planning our units.  Well, my son would have no <br/>
part of it.  He would get through a few letters in the handwriting <br/>
and he was falling out of the chair, crying, etc.  To be honest if he <br/>
had &quot;taken&quot; to the traditional way of schooling then I probably would <br/>
not have looked more into unschooling.  Now, maybe eventually I would <br/>
have found it because I was always drawn to it.  But ultimately <br/>
making the decision to trust him has been my best although I struggle <br/>
daily with my &quot;schooly&quot; side.  That &quot;schooly&quot; part of me would be <br/>
much happier if he would just do the workbooks.  But I know this is <br/>
the better path and in the long run easier.  For now, I think I am <br/>
the one seriously deschooling myself!<br/>

&gt; &gt; consider ourselves. Otherwise, they aren&#39;t learning as much as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; could be. And, I think all homeschooling families are a big mixture<br/>
&gt; &gt; of styles, whether they know it or not. I&#39;m sure unschooling<br/>
&gt; families<br/>
&gt; &gt; still read books, and Well-Trained Mind or others still go on hands<br/>
&gt; &gt; on field trips once in a while. The advantage to homeschooling, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe we should just call it homelearning, to suit everyone, is<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we can pick and choose what we like, what works for us, and what<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t. I think those of us that were schooled traditionaly<br/>
&gt; growing<br/>
&gt; &gt; up, feel that we need a style to call ourselves, so that we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; better explain to others what we are doing. It is kinda difficult<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; explain to someone, &quot;well, sometimes we read books, and sometimes<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; watch the discovery channel, and then sometimes we just go out in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; back yard and dig for bugs&quot;. lol It&#39;s all learning, and our kids<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; get all the knowledge and skills they need, one way or the other.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And, think about it, aren&#39;t we still learning? So, if they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; it all from us, they&#39;ll learn it themselves. And, possibly, every<br/>
&gt; &gt; year it will change, as our children change. I think little ones<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; a little more structure, to start out their learning, but as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; grow, and become more independant, they can go off on thier own<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Basically, it all comes down to the fact that we need to just do<br/>
&gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; works for us, our own families. We don&#39;t have to be accountable to<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone but our kids. Learn from them, as they will learn from us,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; everyone will be happy. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow, as I re-read that I amazed myself! lol I am still trying to<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; my &quot;style&quot; and methods, and I think I just did. I hope this all<br/>
&gt; makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense to everyone, and maybe even helps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; message group between some Well-Trained Mind homeschoolers and<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unschoolers, and the last comment in the discussion was that we<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; choose our method based on a combination of our own learning<br/>
&gt; styles<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and our children&#39;s learning styles. I was wondering how true this<br/>
&gt; &gt; is.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was thinking about the way I learned, and I was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; verbal/linguistic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; learner with just enough logical/mathematical ability to do well<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; school. For me, reading is the key to learning. I always broke<br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in hives when I had a teacher who preferred to have us work in<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or do projects or play games. I just wanted to read the book and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; take the test and that&#39;s that. Even in college, I did well in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;lecture&quot; portion of science classes but I was such an idiot<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; labs that one T.A. forgot his English and started screaming at me<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chinese.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I knew I wanted to homeschool before I had kids, and I assumed it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be all the things I loved about school -- lots of books and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; workbooks (I even bought workbooks for K-6 and kept them in a box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; until finally the last time we moved I threw them in a dumpster).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My son had his own reality. I had all the books about child<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; development and I made charts on the computer and printed them<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for my binder.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he didn&#39;t do anything according to the schedule of child<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; development. He didn&#39;t walk &quot;on time&quot;, or talk &quot;on time&quot;, or use<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; potty &quot;on time&quot;. Meanwhile, he was exploring his environment and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; coming up with all kinds of great stuff that wasn&#39;t even on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; charts. He was about two when I threw away the books and charts<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that was before I even knew how late he&#39;d actually talk or use<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; potty).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So because of the clash between his learning style and mine, I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forced to explore multiple intelligences and unschooling. But I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder ... if he was more like me, maybe I&#39;d be one of the Well-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Trained Mind parents, or Charlotte Mason (that&#39;s the kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; education I wish I&#39;d had!). If I was homeschooled, I&#39;d want my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parents to give me a huge stack of books and send me to my room.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; son would be devastated if he had to spend time in a room by<br/>
&gt; &gt; himself<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; every day.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any insight into this? Do we choose unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because of our learning style or our child&#39;s learning style or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it&#39;s &quot;right&quot;? If you had a child who loves to read and do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; workbooks, would you school at home instead?<br/>

May I gently suggest *not* leaving the group just yet??  There are hundreds <br/>
of people on this list to glean knowledge and ideas from so don&#39;t dismiss <br/>
everyone!  Speaking from my own experience, if you stick it out, you just <br/>
might appreciate comments that smart in the beginning.  Believe me, I&#39;ve <br/>
been there! &lt;bg&gt;  While it is quite possible someone may misunderstad what <br/>
you said, you may find that later in your unschooling journey, you just may <br/>
agree with them!  That&#39;s happened to me, too!<br/>
<br/>
Then again, there will always be someone who disagrees with you and you <br/>
them.  Don&#39;t sweat it!<br/>
<br/>
Stick around, read and learn and most of all, keep an open mind!<br/>

You know, I think you took what I said all wrong. I don&#39;t believe in<br/>
whatever. We can never really have all the knowledge we need. We<br/>
learn new things everyday. Maybe this list isn&#39;t for me then, if I<br/>
can&#39;t express my opinion and thoughts. I thought it was very well<br/>
written.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778295398">If you had a child who loves to read and do <br/>
workbooks, would you school at home instead?<br/>
<br/>
No -because when you find them hiding out behind the toy box -dying to finish the book they are reading (which is not at all school-related)  before you find them and try to have them read about the constitution - you realize there is a great gulf between reading what you love - because you love it and reading because it is on the curriculum list. ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
This was a particular ah-ha moment for me and my daughter ... and I remembered myself in 6th grade sneaking &quot;Pet Cemetery&quot; by Stephen King into my class and &#39;hiding&#39; it in my school book - pretending to be listening when instead I was engrossed in this book. I was often annoyed by the time I had to &#39;waste&#39; when I could be reading. Although the educational value found in Pet Cemetery could certainly be debated!<br/>
<br/>
I have read some of Charlotte Mason&#39;s books - and I love the way she describes reading books that the author wrote because they had a purpose for writing them ( as opposed to &#39;readers&#39;) - Sometimes though I still read books that really don&#39;t add anything to my intellect other than enjoyment. <br/>
<br/>
My 4 year old loves workbooks. We have a K-1 Math book I got at a yard sale - and all the problems are in boxes. She just colors in all of the boxes. She loves workbooks - but not in the way the were meant to be used ;-)<br/>

I read a lot of Stephen King when I was in school too.  I&#39;d read <br/>
during study hall, and at home I&#39;d pretend I had a ton of homework <br/>
and close my bedroom door and read.  And I *did* learn a lot from his <br/>
books.  One thing I learned was that the skills to be a <br/>
technically &quot;good&quot; writer and the skills to be a popular author <br/>
aren&#39;t the same skills.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s one serious downside to a Charlotte Mason education -- <br/>
with all the wonderful books that are published each year, it would <br/>
be a shame to stick to a reading list of dusty old books with archaic <br/>
language and characters that modern kids can&#39;t relate to.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure that was her intention; if she were alive today perhaps her <br/>
suggested reading lists would look quite different.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a problem with classical education too.  Would ten year old <br/>
kids really get more out of reading Homer than Harry Potter?  I <br/>
seriously doubt it.  I went through a phase when I was about ten when <br/>
I wanted to read all the &quot;classics&quot; (by classics I meant Charles <br/>
Dickens and Treasure Island).  A few years ago I picked up Great <br/>
Expectations and realized that most of it went completely over my <br/>
head when I was ten.  I remembered the story but I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; most <br/>
of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531603364">A few years ago I picked up Great <br/>
Expectations and realized that most of it went completely over my <br/>
head when I was ten.  I remembered the story but I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; most <br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did the same with Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Fin. I am enjoying them much more as an adult than I ever did as a kid. The fun thing is that the copy I have was my husband&#39;s from school and he had to underline all the &quot;hard words&#39;. Some of those words are never used today - and others kind of grew on you as you heard them used them in everyday life.  I would venture to say that he didn&#39;t learn that vocabulary from school!  My 8 year old enjoys the read aloud but I don&#39;t think she would pick it up herself. <br/>
<br/>
I went through a Danielle Steele - Trashy Romance Novel phase when I was in High School.  I wouldn&#39;t enjoy those books now as I don&#39;t find them &quot;good&quot; writing any longer.  Not that they were good writing then either ;-) But I just finished Lovely Bones and loved it!<br/>
<br/>
In any case - we do enjoy many things that are considered classic literature - however we do read our share of Calvin & Hobbes and Captain Underpants. ( I hate these - but my children love them - luckily for them my husband finds them funny...) and my 5 year old is way into any kind of non-fiction regarding construction, building, and robots. I think we have completely exhausted the library supply of these!<br/>
<br/>
I tried following a unit study approach 2 years ago. It was Life in America - based on US History. They had a rather extensive list of books to read - drawing a lot from the American Girl books. We found we would get off on a tangent and just sit and read the whole book - rather than read the 2 chapters that were suggested and do the activity. It finally came down to my daughter really just not having any interest in  the revolutionary war. So from that point we just stopped. She now  loves the show Liberty&#39;s Kids - but I think the curriculum approach got kind of dry. The American Girl books were fun- I thought the whole set -up of this curriculum was cool- but found myself falling into the structure of having to complete the next lesson on guns - even if she hated it! I then realized this wasn&#39;t learning! <br/>
<br/>
I read the Well Trained Mind as well and really thought it sounded wonderful. Some of the ideas from the book have been  incorporated into life. We have the book &#39;English from the Roots Up&quot; and write a root word on our wipe off board once a week. We also like the game Rummy Roots.  - but this is fun! The overall structure of the approach was rather daunting to me.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte Mason placed a lot of emphasis on nature as well - and that has played a lot into our day. We have been actively bird watching. I have been writing down the types of birds we see in the back of my bird book. My 5y ds now writes birds down as well. It will take him so long to write &#39;Blue Jay&#39; but he really wants to do this! He walks around with a clipboard and asks how to spell things. He doesn&#39;t get all the letters correct - but I am finding it so exciting to see him learning - without any phonics lessons, or workbooks etc.  but because he feels a need to write down whatever he finds important.<br/>
<br/>
So overall, I can see how some of the ideas in these books are good ones - I also can&#39;t see us following anything like this structurally because it creates too much stress - and then when life happens -or interests change - it just doesn&#39;t work - at least for us. Maybe others have found it to be different -<br/>

  aren&#39;t the same skills.  <br/>
<br/>
  I guess that&#39;s one serious downside to a Charlotte Mason education -- <br/>
  with all the wonderful books that are published each year, it would <br/>
  be a shame to stick to a reading list of dusty old books with archaic <br/>
  language and characters that modern kids can&#39;t relate to.  I&#39;m not <br/>
  sure that was her intention; if she were alive today perhaps her <br/>
  suggested reading lists would look quite different.  <br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s a problem with classical education too.  Would ten year old <br/>
  kids really get more out of reading Homer than Harry Potter?  I <br/>
  seriously doubt it.  I went through a phase when I was about ten when <br/>
  I wanted to read all the &quot;classics&quot; (by classics I meant Charles <br/>
  Dickens and Treasure Island).  A few years ago I picked up Great <br/>
  Expectations and realized that most of it went completely over my <br/>
  head when I was ten.  I remembered the story but I didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; most <br/>
  of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288915149">Very interesting, Sorcha.  I know I, myself, have chosen <br/>
homeschooling because it is a situation that my son is more comfortable with. <br/>
 We have a relaxed pace around our home.  Sometimes he works out of <br/>
workbooks, and that&#39; s because he likes that approach and enjoys it.  It is <br/>
conversation and analysis that are so difficult for him.  I am contemplating <br/>
homeschooling my other son (11 y/o) when we move in June (to Florida).  It <br/>
would be an ideal time to start, since he would be having to begin a new <br/>
school, anyway, but I will need to hook up with some groups there, so he can <br/>
make friends. . .<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve been pondering this ever since an argument broke out on another <br/>
&gt; message group between some Well-Trained Mind homeschoolers and some <br/>
&gt; unschoolers, and the last comment in the discussion was that we all <br/>
&gt; choose our method based on a combination of our own learning styles <br/>
&gt; and our children&#39;s learning styles.  I was wondering how true this is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking about the way I learned, and I was a verbal/linguistic <br/>
&gt; learner with just enough logical/mathematical ability to do well in <br/>
&gt; school.  For me, reading is the key to learning.  I always broke out <br/>
&gt; in hives when I had a teacher who preferred to have us work in groups <br/>
&gt; or do projects or play games.  I just wanted to read the book and <br/>
&gt; take the test and that&#39;s that.  Even in college, I did well in <br/>
&gt; the &quot;lecture&quot; portion of science classes but I was such an idiot in <br/>
&gt; labs that one T.A. forgot his English and started screaming at me in <br/>
&gt; Chinese.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew I wanted to homeschool before I had kids, and I assumed it <br/>
&gt; would be all the things I loved about school -- lots of books and <br/>
&gt; workbooks (I even bought workbooks for K-6 and kept them in a box <br/>
&gt; until finally the last time we moved I threw them in a dumpster).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son had his own reality.  I had all the books about child <br/>
&gt; development and I made charts on the computer and printed them out <br/>
&gt; for my binder.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, he didn&#39;t do anything according to the schedule of child <br/>
&gt; development.  He didn&#39;t walk &quot;on time,&quot; or talk &quot;on time,&quot; or use the <br/>
&gt; potty &quot;on time.&quot;  Meanwhile, he was exploring his environment and <br/>
&gt; coming up with all kinds of great stuff that wasn&#39;t even on the <br/>
&gt; charts.  He was about two when I threw away the books and charts (and <br/>
&gt; that was before I even knew how late he&#39;d actually talk or use the <br/>
&gt; potty).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So because of the clash between his learning style and mine, I was <br/>
&gt; forced to explore multiple intelligences and unschooling.  But I <br/>
&gt; wonder ... if he was more like me, maybe I&#39;d be one of the Well-<br/>
&gt; Trained Mind parents, or Charlotte Mason (that&#39;s the kind of <br/>
&gt; education I wish I&#39;d had!).  If I was homeschooled, I&#39;d want my <br/>
&gt; parents to give me a huge stack of books and send me to my room.  My <br/>
&gt; son would be devastated if he had to spend time in a room by himself <br/>
&gt; every day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any insight into this?  Do we choose unschooling <br/>
&gt; because of our learning style or our child&#39;s learning style or <br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s &quot;right&quot;?  If you had a child who loves to read and do <br/>
&gt; workbooks, would you school at home instead?<br/>

failed another &quot;test&quot; I kept waiting for someone to tell me what the <br/>

could look in the back of the book and find out what the answer was <br/>
supposed to be.  It took a long time to realize that life is not <br/>
school and there aren&#39;t cut and dry answers to everything.  It took a <br/>
long time to develop judgement of my own.  And it was hard coming to <br/>
terms with the fact that when I made a mistake there wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
be a right answer written in red and passed back to me.<br/>

&gt; Sorcha<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a child who &quot;loves to read and do workbooks&quot; and I choose to <br/>
unschool.  We did do the school-at-home method for 2 months, and <br/>
while she loved it, I got very bored with it.  And I do have to admit <br/>
I LOVE looking at curricula.  I loved workbooks and flashcards and <br/>
wall charts.  But I did not like going by the &quot;scripts&quot; that the <br/>
teachers&#39; manuals have.  It didn&#39;t feel like teaching, it felt like <br/>
parroting.  <br/>
<br/>
The main reason I decided I would homeschool (before I even had my <br/>
daughter) was because I knew that though I always made A&#39;s in school, <br/>
I never was remotely challenged to meet my potential.  When I <br/>
graduated from my community college, I was offered a full-tuition <br/>
scholarship to New College in Sarasota.  That is an &quot;honors&quot; college <br/>
where there are no grades, you design your own degree, and study what <br/>
you choose.  The teachers are mainly there for support and guidance <br/>
when asked for it.  (At least that is what the college claimed to be, <br/>
I never went or knew anyone who went...I chose instead to move to NC <br/>
and get married.)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted so badly to go to that college, because I felt like some <br/>
actual learning might take place there.  But anyway, I ended up <br/>
going to UNC-Chapel Hill and majoring in a field <br/>
where the teachers (and I use that term loosely) are there to do <br/>
their research, and oh, they have to teach a pesky class to get their <br/>
pay.  It was a real awakening, because they certainly had no desire <br/>
to teach.  You basically had to teach yourself.  Boy did I suck at <br/>
that.  (Physics and differential equations are kinda hard things to <br/>
start self-learning.)  So I knew then and there that any child of <br/>
mine would not be so dependent upon being spoon-fed information.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-forward to the A Beka months.  Can you say spoon-fed with a <br/>
vengeance?  My daughter craves being &quot;taught.&quot;  She loves it.  I love <br/>
teaching her.  And that is why I choose to unschool.  Life is not <br/>
about being spoon-fed.  You don&#39;t find the best things in life until <br/>
you pick up your plate and lick it.  I want to see her smile at me <br/>
with pudding on her forehead.  That is where true living (and <br/>
learning) begins.<br/>
<br/>
And I can&#39;t finish this post without also saying that I unschool <br/>
because I have found a kinship in this group unlike any other in the <br/>
homeschool community.  You girls cuss.  Many of you listened to heavy <br/>
metal in the eighties.  Every sentence is not followed by, &quot;Praise <br/>
God.&quot;  And here we are expected to THINK, not just mindlessly <br/>
babble.  I feel like I fit in with this crowd.  So to some extent, it <br/>
seems many of us who have chosen unschooling may or may not have the <br/>
same learning style, but there is certainly a personality style that <br/>
seems to permeate at least the more vocal members of this group.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519375116">Hi Tory!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, is your scholarship transferable???  Cause I want IN on that college!!  <br/>
I&#39;ve never even heard of such a thing!  I&#39;ve been itching to go back to <br/>
school.  It&#39;s taken me 12 years to attain &#39;sophomore&#39; status because I only <br/>
enjoy it for so long.  I&#39;m in one of those schoolish phases where I want to <br/>
feel all smart and nerdy for a little while.  The BEST class I&#39;ve ever taken <br/>
was a microbiology class at our local junior college.  The Prof would waltz <br/>
in, turn out the lights and start the most bizarre slide shows.  We&#39;d all <br/>
sit there mesmerized by the grossest things...it was great!  If anyone ever <br/>
fell asleep in class, he would actually make us all whisper so they could <br/>
sleep!  THEN, he&#39;d hold Saturday classes for make-up in case any of us <br/>
happened to snooze on the clock.  He always thought the best part of school, <br/>
for him, was Kindergarten, because in Kindy, you could sleep, play and have <br/>
snacks!  LOL  So, we all took turns bringing snacks to every class.  He&#39;d <br/>
cover up the &quot;No Food or Drinks&quot; sign with an &quot;important&quot; memo and tell us <br/>
to hide it if anyone came in.<br/>
<br/>
It all sounds so childish, but I learned more in that class than any other <br/>
in my LIFE!  I was 16 with a new baby (quit high school and got my GED) and <br/>
he even let me bring her to class with me!  If all teachers were like that, <br/>
we&#39;d have kids churning out degrees like crazy!  If they only knew.......<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Ten years ago, I was in correspondence with another homeschooling mom, <br/>
structured, Christian unschooler from Illinois.  (The family moved, and <br/>
divorced, and are not in that state now, and not homeschooling, but that&#39;s <br/>
not the story.)<br/>
<br/>
The mom had joined the SCA but was far from experienced people who could meet <br/>
her.   I made her my apprentice (nonsense for people who don&#39;t know the SCA, <br/>
but you can gloss over it like a weird phrase in a Dickens novel and just <br/>
keep going &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I gave her was a little hand-made book which was a list of <br/>
virtues and concepts, one calligraphed on each page, by me, book by me, in a <br/>
little pouch I made for it.  I asked her to consider those things and look <br/>
for examples of them in her everyday life.  <br/>
<br/>
A month or two later I saw her and she showed me the little book.  She had <br/>
looked each word up in the dictionary and written out the definition.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s NOT at all what I had hoped for her to do or learn.  <br/>
<br/>
[I shuddered just now, remembering that.]<br/>

learning<br/>
from life.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  Now don&#39;t jump me for doing this, okay? &lt;bg&gt;  Just for sh**s and <br/>
giggles, I looked up the word lesson.  Of course, there are various <br/>
interpretations depending upon usage, but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Lesson: new or better knowledge: some useful knowledge or sense that results <br/>
from direct experience<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not calling my kids to the table saying, &quot;Ok children, today we are <br/>
going to learn how to make bread!&quot;  I may decide to make bread today and <br/>
more likely than not, at least two of the girls want to come in and help.  <br/>
The excitement spreads and I end up with five sets of hands ready to knead.  <br/>
Haleigh wants help in understanding how to read the recipe.  Nicholette <br/>
wants to knead but isn&#39;t sure how.  Lauren wants to break eggs and Hannah <br/>
and Ethan are purely interested in how much flour it takes to cover the <br/>
entire kitchen.  By the time the dough goes into the oven, Haleigh and <br/>
Nicholette are the only two still aware of the fact that we are making <br/>
bread.  The other kids are making car tracks in the floury floor.<br/>
<br/>
So, in the definition above of &#39;lesson&#39;, all the kids have had their own <br/>
making of a &#39;lesson&#39; in baking bread.  In this sense, I still see it as a <br/>
buzz word.  I find that in the ps community, they think they *own* the word <br/>
&#39;learn&#39; as well.  I&#39;m sure everyone here has probably heard at least one <br/>
person say, in response to &#39;we home/unschool&#39;, &quot;How will they LEARN blah, <br/>
blah, blah???&quot;  As if being in ps was the only way to &#39;learn&#39; anything!  We <br/>
(unschoolers) just happen to hold on to that particular word and don&#39;t <br/>
solely connect it with &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see that those new to unschooling (and maybe even some of the <br/>
vets)  may still hold on to the ps baggage associated with those words.  But <br/>
personally, I can see the &quot;lessons&quot; in learning without specifically having <br/>
to verbalize or analyze them as such.   For all intents and purposes here, <br/>
though, I am willing to work on excluding them from my vocabulary for the <br/>
sake of those who cannot make the distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to cause another uproar, just attempting to explain the <br/>
meaning as I see it, use it and understand it.<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, grabbing the umbrella :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If people keep the &quot;buzz words&quot; they also keep the concepts and the baggage<br/>
and the expectations.  There are serious and profound advantages to moving<br/>
from curriculum/lessons/teaching to life/opportunities/learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969600387">Heather, <br/>
I had similar experiences.  We dabbled in Waldorf homeschooling for my daughter&#39;s K year.  Mostly we did circle time and really got into the seasonal celebrations.  I&#39;ve always loved celebrating the seasons, but I learned about new ones I hadn&#39;t heard of before like midsummer and also found some new traditions to add to our regular celebrations.  That was a wonderful thing to learn about.  Now, we don&#39;t follow anything else from Waldorf, but those things we learned about have enriched our family ever since.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago I read some information about Charlotte Mason homeschooling.  Although we never implemented any of the techniques in a structured way, I was impressed with the emphasis on nature study.  I am a field biologist by training, but hadn&#39;t done much since the kids were born.  So, I started keeping a nature journal for my own benefit.  Now my daughter has one as well, but she works on it in her own way and time.  We have a great time getting out our journals, pens and paints and getting out in nature.<br/>
<br/>
I am thankful that I found out about these things because they have enhanced my life.  I think in that way they have become interesting to my children, but I didn&#39;t necessarily plan on that happening.<br/>

I read the Well Trained Mind as well and really thought it sounded wonderful. Some of the ideas from the book have been  incorporated into life. We have the book &#39;English from the Roots Up&quot; and write a root word on our wipe off board once a week. We also like the game Rummy Roots.  - but this is fun! The overall structure of the approach was rather daunting to me.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte Mason placed a lot of emphasis on nature as well - and that has played a lot into our day. We have been actively bird watching. I have been writing down the types of birds we see in the back of my bird book. My 5y ds now writes birds down as well. It will take him so long to write &#39;Blue Jay&#39; but he really wants to do this! He walks around with a clipboard and asks how to spell things. He doesn&#39;t get all the letters correct - but I am finding it so exciting to see him learning - without any phonics lessons, or workbooks etc.  but because he feels a need to write down whatever he finds important.<br/>
<br/>
So overall, I can see how some of the ideas in these books are good ones - I also can&#39;t see us following anything like this structurally because it creates too much stress - and then when life happens -or interests change - it just doesn&#39;t work - at least for us. Maybe others have found it to be different -<br/>

&gt; I think for all of those reasons. Because of our learning styles and those<br/>
&gt; of our children&#39;s it is right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe that no matter what my children&#39;s learning style was I would be <br/>
unschooling.  For me it is more than just a method of getting information.  <br/>
It is the freedom my children have to choose, what, when, why and how they <br/>
learn.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe when a group of homeschoolers is talking about curriculum or <br/>
different &quot;school at home&quot; methods it is easy to say you have to find what <br/>
method works for you and your family, and for your children&#39;s learning style. <br/>
 But when talking about unschooling I think it can fit with any learning <br/>
style.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278310392">I guess another reason I ask is because my son is not the type who <br/>
would do well in school.  It would crush him.  He&#39;s very strong-<br/>
willed and very much a thinker, but he will only follow instructions <br/>
if they sound more interesting than what he was already planning.  If <br/>
my child had been more of a compliant Suzy Sunshine, I can see myself <br/>
buying a Kindergarten curriculum and sitting down at the dining room <br/>
table every day at eight in the morning.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has such a forceful personality, and is so opinionated, that <br/>
if public school was the only option I would feel sorry for his <br/>
teacher as well as him.  There&#39;s just no getting him to do what you <br/>
want unless it&#39;s what he wants.  I can remember growing up, my mom <br/>
considered me &quot;defiant&quot;, &quot;disobedient&quot;, &quot;mouthy&quot;, and all those other <br/>
lovely things, and she felt it was her job to beat me into <br/>
submission.  When my son was little I decided not to think of him in <br/>
those terms and to let him grow up without breaking his spirit.  And <br/>
believe me, school would break his spirit.  But if he&#39;d been a <br/>
different kind of child, I&#39;d have been a different kind of parent, <br/>
and likely I&#39;d write some book in ten years bragging about my child <br/>
reading in Latin when he was four years old.<br/>
<br/>
One time my son was browsing the library and came across a book about <br/>
IQ testing and asked me what it was.  I told him it was a test.  He <br/>
wanted to take it.  The first question had a bunch of pictures and it <br/>
asked if you would find any of them in a garden.  He said, &quot;Yes, the <br/>
cat.&quot;  I told him it&#39;s quite likely you&#39;d find a cat in a garden.  <br/>
What about the flowers, though?  He said, &quot;No, you wouldn&#39;t find a <br/>
vase of cut flowers in a garden.  That would be silly!&quot;  And then he <br/>
wandered off to look at something different.  And I thought about how <br/>
much smarter he is than whoever made the test, and I knew I was <br/>
making the right decision to let his mind grow its own way rather <br/>
than training it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541905845">At the risk of posting too much, I&#39;ll add that for my son&#39;s entire <br/>
life I&#39;ve been hearing my mom&#39;s commentary on him, which has ranged <br/>
from &quot;Maybe he&#39;s mentally retarded; you should have him tested&quot; <br/>
to &quot;He might be a genius&quot; to &quot;I think he must be like Edison or <br/>
Einstein and he&#39;s really a genius but he seems mentally retarded&quot;.  I <br/>
was wondering if other unschoolers have children who elicit such <br/>
comments.  I doubt school-at-homers have children like him, because <br/>
they&#39;d give up crying and either send him to school or unschool.<br/>
