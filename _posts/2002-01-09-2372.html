&lt;&lt; Wow, was I really surprised to see what was going on there! It&#39;s<br/>
funny, I just  thought - how could anyone not like her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How sweet of you to say that.<br/>
<br/>
But apparently it&#39;s really easy for people not to like me.  They assume <br/>
whatever I say was a personal attack on them and they start accusing me of <br/>
running people away from unschooling.  I guess it helps if they&#39;re already <br/>
paranoid and insecure, and wanting someone or something else to blame it on.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t recommend about moving, because I&#39;ve rarely done it!  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re spot-on about the people condescendingly saying you/I/people shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be prejudiced against fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers but just deal <br/>
with them politely where they are.  They don&#39;t WANT us where they are, and <br/>
will make that blatantly clear.    (Is &quot;blatantly clear&quot; contradictory?  <br/>
Maybe...)<br/>

Welcome to this list!<br/>

positive! It&#39;s temporary - only 2 - 3 years! I am ever thankful for<br/>
lists like this where one can touch base with like minded folks, if only <br/>

<br/>
Hi Alice. Glad you decided to come out of lurkdom. :o) I have very recent <br/>
experience in dealing with what you have just described! Two years ago, job <br/>
considerations forced us to move from left-leaning, liberal, hippie haven <br/>
Boulder, CO to Utah, land o&#39; the Mormons. Now I have nothing against <br/>
Mormons, but I ain&#39;t one. Nor am I conservatve, Republican or traditional in <br/>
most ways. It was a big culture shock for us to move here. But, it has also <br/>
turned out to be one the best experiences in my life. I&#39;ve been able to grow <br/>
and learn more about myself in these two years than ever before. Here&#39;s what <br/>
I&#39;ve learned.<br/>
<br/>
First, I stopped trying to fit in or say what people wanted to hear so I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t offend them. There was no way I would ever fit in here, so I just <br/>
decided to be very obvious about being different. Wore it on my shirtsleeve <br/>
(or my bumper sticker) so to speak. I spoke my mind a lot and shared my <br/>
political and spiritual beliefs with anyone who would listen. I was loud and <br/>
positive about unschooling. No wavering, because I am positive this is right <br/>
for us. And guess what? All the other Utah &quot;freaks&quot; started coming out of <br/>
the woodwork to talk to me. Turns out I wasn&#39;t the only one. Just the only <br/>
one comfortable enough to speak up. I have actually found quite a few folks <br/>
like minded enough to make living here bearable for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Second, don&#39;t knock virtual friendships. They have been a lifesaver! When <br/>
the people and the politics and the religion make me nuts, I go on line for <br/>
a reality break. I always laugh when my comptuer has logged me off of the <br/>
internet. The message I get is &quot;Do you want to reconnect?&quot; and I think, <br/>
&quot;Yes! I NEED to reconnect. Get me to some sane people NOW!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Third, for the kids&#39; sake, I say yes a lot. Yes to sleepovers, yes to <br/>
driving far distances to find friends, yes to more expensive hobbies since <br/>
it&#39;s what&#39;s available now. We spend much time in the car since our real life <br/>
friends can be 30 miles away. We listened to some awesome books on tape that <br/>
way, though. There&#39;s an upside to everything. Which brings me to number <br/>
four.<br/>
<br/>
I had to calm myself down and accept the move for what it is, a temporary <br/>
stop on the path. I tried to figure out what I was supposed to learn from <br/>
the experience, and then tried to allow myself to be open to the lessons as <br/>
they came. I&#39;m still here, so I guess I&#39;m still learning. Although we are <br/>
trying to plan an escape to Oregon this year. :o) Wish us luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825999808">--Hey Alice, good to see you here!! You&#39;re so sweet.<br/>
Just for the record (and especially anyone that might be in NC) Alice <br/>
is the cooooolest unschooler and fun person to talk to!<br/>
She is a true radical unschooler that is so confident in unschooling <br/>
she&#39;s an inspiration!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am sooo sad that Pensacola&#39;s about to lose you.....but I am <br/>
positive you will find some cool people up there.<br/>
I think someone at unschooling.com responded to your posts and said <br/>
there were quite a few NC unschoolers....there just HAS to be.<br/>
Do what I did and search for unschoolers to start your own support <br/>
group.<br/>
Search everywhere! Even the local &quot;support&quot; groups can be a <br/>
source...as long as they&#39;re willing to allow a radical to put an ad <br/>
in their newsletter. haha<br/>
Post yourself at the homeschool registry...it may help open doors <br/>
even if their isn&#39;t anyone else there yet.<br/>
When people log on and see &quot;unschooler&quot; they write ya!!<br/>
And keep going to unschooling.com of course, it&#39;s amazing the <br/>
connections I&#39;ve made there.<br/>
Best wishes to ya Ali! I&#39;m gonna miss you.<br/>

Well, I never did do this. I realized right away I wouldn&#39;t ever fit in<br/>
either. I&#39;m a terrible actor and wouldn&#39;t have known what to say that<br/>
wouldn&#39;t offend them even if I wanted to try to fit in.  But I couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand how an *entire group of people* could not like me so much. I<br/>
mean, hey, not everybody&#39;s gonna like ya, ya know? But _everyone_ _not_<br/>
liking you? That freaked me out - and made me a bit sad. I never had<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to hear that and really happy for you. I haven&#39;t given up<br/>
hope. I&#39;ll just have to be a bit more outgoing. And developing a thick<br/>
skin won&#39;t hurt either. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Second, don&#39;t knock virtual friendships.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh no! I didn&#39;t mean to sound like that!  I know how helpful lists like<br/>
this can be. They _have_ been a life saver for me, too. But now that the<br/>
kids are getting older, it&#39;s them I&#39;m more concerned about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Third, for the kids&#39; sake, I say yes a lot. Yes to sleepovers, yes to<br/>

<br/>
Well, we&#39;re pretty used to the travelling part. When we were in NY, we<br/>
were about 45 minutes away from anybody. Books on tape are handy for<br/>
long rides in the car aren&#39;t they? Or when kids are a little under the<br/>
weather. Like now. They&#39;re both listening to &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; as we<br/>
speak (well..... ah.... write).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I had to calm myself down and accept the move for what it is, a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>temporary<br/>
stop on the path.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That thought helps me an awful lot. It is only temporary. And another<br/>
positive thing if it turns out to be NC (I did say might, but they&#39;re<br/>
pretty good odds on going there) is that it is a whole lot closer to NY.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Just for the record (and especially anyone that might be in NC) Alice<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is the cooooolest unschooler and fun person to talk to!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She is a true radical unschooler that is so confident in unschooling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she&#39;s an inspiration!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, all you linguists out there. Is there a word for when someone whom<br/>
you find inspiring also finds you inspiring?  LOL (did you follow that<br/>
:-) )<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyway, I am sooo sad that Pensacola&#39;s about to lose you&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I do still have six more months, but I have the feeling they&#39;re<br/>
going to &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fly&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; by.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think someone at unschooling.com responded to your posts and said<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there were quite a few NC unschoolers....there just HAS to be.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch, but they&#39;re all way over towards the middle of the<br/>
state or off in the mountains. Now that we&#39;ve met you guys, I&#39;m getting<br/>
too picky. I want folks in _my own town_! Dag-nab-it! ;-)  (guess I&#39;ll<br/>
try to quell those unrealistic expectations)<br/>
And you know, I&#39;ve been trying to get back onto those boards all day<br/>
today and I keep getting an error message that says &quot;unable to locate<br/>
unschooling.com&quot;. I&#39;m using a bookmark, so I know it&#39;s spelled right.<br/>
Anybody know what&#39;s up with that?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Post yourself at the homeschool registry...it may help open doors<br/>
 </span></blockquote>even if their isn&#39;t anyone else there yet.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I was planning on doing that when we got there and got a local email<br/>
address. Do you know the isp I have now (in FL) is a _national_ company.<br/>
I can even get a local access number in the little town (pop ~600) in NY<br/>
(for when we go there in the summers - what can I say, even an email<br/>
junkie on vacation), but they don&#39;t have any local numbers for<br/>
Jacksonville, NC ! So I&#39;m going to have to change my email. :-(  Maybe<br/>
I&#39;ll just go to a bigger &quot;national&quot; one. But I am going to write in to<br/>
my current isp, they keep adding numbers and cities all the time.<br/>

O.K. I&#39;m emerging from lurkdom.  <br/>
I&#39;m Margot, and I&#39;m a 38 year old.  (That&#39;s supposed to be like &quot;I&#39;m Margot and I&#39;m an alcoholic&quot; but it doesn&#39;t work in print.)  <br/>
I only know one person who lives in NC, but she happens to be a fairly radical person.  She delivered both of my children  - homebirth.  (In California that practically makes her an outlaw.) She moved there (Henderson, NC) completely of her own free will about 4 years ago and is ecstatically happy there.  I&#39;m not sure what she does for friendship there, but I will add that I know that her twin sister moved there as well and they spend a great deal of time together.  She&#39;s a goddess worshipper though, and some people still do trust her to deliver their babies. . . . <br/>
Also, one of my best friends who also homeschools is considering moving there, to Winston-Salem.  It&#39;s a big question for her - for a lot of reasons that I couldn&#39;t possibly explain, even if I were willing to divulge them.<br/>
<br/>
My point - look out! ooo-hooo-oo-hoooo-oooo (spooky laugh).  We&#39;re everywhere!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797019722">Wow! Good page... I like:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Other parents were puzzled as to why we saw what they regarded as &#39;good&#39; schools, which today would no doubt get OFSTED approval, as &#39;educational impoverishment zones&#39;. &#39;A good uniform means a good school&#39;, they declared. &#39;And probably a bad education based on uniformity&#39;, we responded. John Gatto had an explanation for this puzzled response: &quot;It is the great triumph of compulsory government monopoly mass-schooling that ... only a small number can imagine a different way to do things.&quot; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So what did our policy of damage limitation look like? The first item was a principle: we would never pretend the school was right when it was wrong. If it proved necessary and with our son&#39;s approval, we would take the trouble to challenge the school when it was in the wrong, even if this meant we were labelled &#39;nuisance&#39;, &#39;interfering&#39;, or &#39;bad&#39; parents. Part of this principle was never to shirk a dialogue with our son about what was happening in school and its implications. Thus, when a teacher, unable to find a guilty party punished the whole class, we pointed out that this was a common fascist procedure, but also why the authoritarian system pushed teachers into this corner. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is such an important point. Many, many parents, when they<br/>
enroll their children in school, hand over their their critical<br/>
faculties. I don&#39;t know if it is because we are socialized, as former<br/>
school members ourselves, to be &quot;nice&quot; middle class people and not make<br/>
waves or what. When homeschoolers talk to parents who have done this,<br/>
the ones who buy totally into the system and cannot imagine an<br/>
alternative, I think that what they are really seeing is the successful<br/>
implementation of schooling from the earlier generation. <br/>
<br/>
And then there is the homework. Even the critical parent who bucks the<br/>
system and tries to hand to their child the tools of personal decison<br/>
making can be brought up short when turned, against their will, into the<br/>
school&#39;s de facto presence at home with the responsibilities of the<br/>
homework police.<br/>
