<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165837649">****True Christians (I can&#39;t speak for the ones in these examples of<br/>
child abuse) get new hearts from God and act differently from then on.<br/>
Mike****<br/>
<br/>
I truly do not understand why Christians think the have all the truth on<br/>
their side when it comes to raising children.  Can I not be a good and<br/>
righteous person without believing in their God?  Am I not a moral<br/>
person because I don&#39;t worship in their churches, or send my children to<br/>
bible school?<br/>
<br/>
Just because they believe in God and his only begotten son, go to<br/>
church, and proselytize at me, does not make them good and moral people.<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t I believe in reincarnation, and Buddha, and the Goddess (Mary,<br/>
perhaps for the Christians out there) and believe in God and not go to<br/>
church and not spout my very personal and private beliefs all over the<br/>
place for people to discuss and for me to then get pissed off about<br/>
because no one agrees with me?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not ok for people to believe what they<br/>
believe and allow others to have that same freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Kate<br/>
A little confused about why we are still discussing this when we know no<br/>
one is going to convert another, and a little pissed off that I am<br/>
having to use my delete button so often lately - I miss this list.  I<br/>
liked the bible thread, not the conversion thread.<br/>
My 2 cents - feel free to ignore.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I truly do not understand why Christians think the have all the truth on<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some Christians believe they have all the truth about everything. It&#39;s all<br/>
in the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
As long as it goes no further than I have the truth and you don&#39;t, I&#39;m right<br/>
and you&#39;re wrong ... So what? (Assuming we&#39;re not talking about using the<br/>
Bible to justify doing horrendous things.) If you try imagining what the<br/>
world looks like from the view point of someone who believes the Bible<br/>
literally, then that attitude makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can I not be a good and<br/>
&gt; righteous person without believing in their God?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And why does it bother you that someone might believe otherwise? How does it<br/>
change who you are or lessen who you are? (It&#39;s just a thought to ponder.)<br/>
<br/>
Tolerance is often defined with respect to those who are different than we<br/>
are. But the true test is being tolearnt of those we disagree with. (As long<br/>
as they aren&#39;t harming others.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No matter how strongly someone is convinced they&#39;re right, they don&#39;t have<br/>
any power over us unless we let them. So what if they get angry? Their anger<br/>
has no effect unless we let it in and let it rile us up. If we look at anger<br/>
as a pot that&#39;s turning up it&#39;s own flame, we don&#39;t need to jump in the<br/>
boiling water or turn down the flame. Disengage and just let it boil ;-)<br/>

it&#39;s wrong to treat children as lesser beings. I argue with others who would<br/>
like the freedom and peace to believe otherwise. Christians have as much<br/>
right to believe I&#39;m going to a fiery pit when I die, and that I could avoid<br/>
it if I&#39;d just accept Jesus Christ as my Savior as I do to believe that<br/>
they&#39;re wrong.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not ok for people to believe what they<br/>

<br/>
Because central to Baptist belief is that they have a mandate from God to try <br/>
to convert everyone quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Buddhists and pagans have no such mandate.<br/>
Jews have no such mandate.  <br/>
<br/>
So while they&#39;re living their happy lives, Baptists (if they want to consider <br/>
themselves REAL Baptists) will continually try to bring them the Good News of <br/>
Jesus (and Mormons and Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses will too).<br/>
<br/>
Their religions can&#39;t for a second &quot;accept&quot; anything else.  That&#39;s the first <br/>
rule of their religion, that is the one true way.<br/>
<br/>
There are others in the world, but they&#39;re not Hindu, Buddhist, Shinto or any <br/>
other tree/rock/ancestor worshippers.<br/>
<br/>
The three named above are the ones most common in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
JWs and Mormons have an obligation to do it in person.  Baptists used to, <br/>
more than now.  Now they can fulfill their obligation by giving money to <br/>
Billy Graham or some TV station that broadcasts preaching all day.<br/>
<br/>
Truly, we can&#39;t just decide to get along.  Any baptist who says &quot;Sure, it&#39;s <br/>
just as valid if you believe something different&quot; is NOT doing what Jesus <br/>
told them to do (as they read the Bible).  Even if the other thing you do is <br/>
be JW or Mormon.  ESPECIALLY if the other thing you do is be Catholic.  So <br/>
their first line of bad guys is the other Christians.<br/>
<br/>
Anything out of the ordinary is blamed directly on Satan.  Like Harry Potter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004062546">You&#39;re right, of course, and I know it.  It just frustrates me.  I was<br/>
raised Catholic by a Catholic mother who came from a Catholic family,<br/>
etc....  But she continued to grow spiritually beyond those boundries<br/>
and I will always love her for being able to see outside the box she<br/>
grew up with (and her mother grew up with and her mother, etc...) and<br/>
allow my sisters and me room to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the reminder.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you, Joyce.  I have very dear friends who don&#39;t agree with my<br/>
beliefs and vice versa, we love and respect one another deeply.  We are<br/>
always honest with each other and thus we can calmly discuss issues we<br/>
differ on, we NEVER get angry or defensive.<br/>
<br/>
I used to get angry when others were sarcastic or belittling, now I just<br/>
get sad because it means they don&#39;t know (maybe don&#39;t want to know) ME. <br/>
I&#39;m even more sad when I see those who share some of my beliefs behaving<br/>
the same way, PEOPLE are more important than an urge to prove one is<br/>
superior.<br/>

<br/>
Mike, I don&#39;t think most people who belittle others are even aware of<br/>
what they are doing.  Having been on both sides of a lot of fences have<br/>
let me see the same behavior on both sides.  When one is convinced of<br/>
their rightness, on either side, they don&#39;t see the way they are<br/>
addressing the other side as demeaning.<br/>
<br/>
The upside is this, when I meet people are truly generous, tolerant and<br/>
treat all people with respect, in spite of differing views I know I&#39;ve<br/>
discovered someone I want to know.  I&#39;ve got a few of those in my life<br/>
now and I do everything I can to treat them the same way.  They are<br/>
jewels.<br/>
