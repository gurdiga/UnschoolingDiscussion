<div id="ygrps-yiv-764194725"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My dh watched Ed, Ed, Eddy with him <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and said the way in which some of the characters talked to eachother <br/>
showed alot of rudeness although I have not seen that one.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put in my vote against Ed, Edd and Eddy!  But even I have to agree that <br/>
it IS sometimes pretty funny. At the LEAST, they prompt discussions on the <br/>
situations and reactions----and that large vocabulary! Now, Cow and Chicken? <br/>
well, I STILL haven&#39;t found anything redeeming about THAT one! &lt;G&gt; But Duncan <br/>
gutgiggles all through it----so at least HE finds it entertaining! THAT&#39;s the <br/>
redeeming quality!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The <br/>
 </span></blockquote>fairly oddparents really gets under my skin and that one we do not <br/>
allow because I think he is too young.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, *I* happen to LIKE Fairly Oddparents! &lt;G&gt; Go figure! I like The Rugrats, <br/>
too, but am in the minority there!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; IS he making an <br/>
 </span></blockquote>intelligent choice or just staring like a dog foaming at the mouth  <br/>
watching shows that corporate america has put out there marketed to <br/>
little boys (harsh but how I feel. At this point I feel the only <br/>
reason he is watching is because it is on cartoon network.  I have <br/>
tried to discuss that just because it is on that channel does not <br/>
mean it is a good choice.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well first off,  the words &quot;intelligent choice&quot; kind of  makes me feel icky. <br/>
It&#39;s just a choice. Is there NOTHING better on?  To HIM? Then he&#39;s making a <br/>
choice that&#39;s important to him at the time. Duncan did the cartoonnetwork ONLY <br/>
for a couple of years, so I&#39;ve been there. He&#39;s seven now----and his choices <br/>
are becoming more &quot;refined&quot; and more &quot;mature&quot;----but I wouldn&#39;t say they&#39;re <br/>
necessarily more (or less) &quot;intelligent&quot;. There&#39;s *something* he&#39;s getting out of <br/>
Cartoon Network that YOU&#39;re not seeing. And he&#39;s not the only one!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am struggling with balancing that with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>giving hime the freedom to make his own choices.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give him the choices NOW, and you won&#39;t be worrying so much about his future. <br/>
MAKE his choices now FOR him, and HE&#39;ll be worrying in the future.<br/>
