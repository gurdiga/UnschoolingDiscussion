<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>
<p><small><time>12 Aug 2002, at  5:41pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762250486">When our now 24 yo boy was 9 he got into re-enacting/LARP, which<br/>
in turn led to many of his passionate interests and a few brief<br/>
side trips into things like archeology (hot dusty work that<br/>
doesn&#39;t let you got to the bathroom in comfort when you want to<br/>
according to him at age 14).  This site has some links that will<br/>
get you started on Civil War re-enacting, which by my memory is<br/>
the most active of the &quot;real life&quot; groups in Iowa:<br/>

Your SCA kingdom is here, if that seems more appealing (it was<br/>
briefly for our boy, though he moved on to full fantasy LARP):<br/>

| You intelligent people crack me up!<br/>
| How much time can be wasted insanely arguing back and forth<br/>
| with a bunch of us trying to have decent discussions.<br/>
| Get each others private emails and email your arguments to each<br/>
other, would<br/>
| you?<br/>
| I am not wanting &quot;to hear about it&quot; really.  (I only get the<br/>
emails in<br/>
| groups, not individually..)<br/>
|<br/>
| I like the stimulating conversations that engage us all.<br/>
| Have you ever heard your neighbors yelling outside at each<br/>
other and wished<br/>
| they&#39;d keep it private?<br/>
| That is how it feels here, IN MY OPINION!<br/>
|<br/>
| So let&#39;s start talking about something new!<br/>
|<br/>
| New Topic:<br/>
|<br/>
| ** unschooling ideas for historical interests of 9 yr. old<br/>
boys.<br/>
| Any ideas or stories are welcomed.  Thanks!<br/>
|<br/>
| Oh, I live in Iowa.  Are you all aware of the Underground<br/>
Railroad being<br/>
| prominent here in our state?  I just recently learned about<br/>
this.  Very<br/>
| fasinating!  Even went to a house/museum and toured it.<br/>
|<br/>
| How about Hoyt Sherman?  Any one ever hear of him?  His mansion<br/>
is set up<br/>
| here in Des Moines and has a fasinating story of women in Iowa<br/>
in the late<br/>
| 1800s wanting to get away from the prarie talk and more into<br/>
prestigious<br/>
| topics from their lives back east, including the art and<br/>
paintings.  It ends<br/>
| up now, 100 yrs. later, the women still hold on to his home and<br/>
have millions<br/>
| of dollars of art in it.<br/>
| It is awesome.  I just heard of it and toured it this summer.<br/>
|<br/>
| Let&#39;s chat!<br/>
