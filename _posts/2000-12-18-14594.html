<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639024736">Don&#39;t mean to be flippant or trivilaise your problem, <br/>
but my first thought was &#39;get a bigger bed!&#39;  or <br/>
another bed where dh can sleep while you nurse.  I made <br/>
the mistake of having a Mirena fitted when dd2 was <br/>
about 15mo, my nipples got v sensitive and I could no <br/>
longer sleep through nighttime nursings, so I can <br/>
definitely empathise.  This has been the problem for <br/>
me, really, it&#39;s made me fed-up and probably prolonged <br/>
the whole thing.  Seriously, it won&#39;t kill your <br/>
relationship with your dh as long as you talk about it, <br/>
keep talking, so if there&#39;s a way for the two of you (I <br/>
mean you child and you...) to co-sleep, then do it!  <br/>
They do &#39;unschool&#39; into their own beds eventually, or <br/>
so I&#39;m told :-)  It&#39;s not abuse as long as they can <br/>
choose, they do naturally outgrow the need, and htey do <br/>
have the need.  You might find that the nursing gets <br/>
less if he&#39;s in your bed, the company is something he <br/>
needs just as much.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from that, I don&#39;t know what to suggest.  All the <br/>
figures, all the anecdotes, the books I&#39;ve read, the <br/>
presentations I&#39;ve seen tell me that co-sleeping is, <br/>
like breastfeeding, the biological expectation of the <br/>
child.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888601577">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this list and was going to wait to post till I&#39;d had time to<br/>
introduce myself properly. (I know, hahaha, on ever having the time to do<br/>
anything properly!) But this post caught my eye and, while I tried to reply<br/>
to Amy privately, either the list won&#39;t allow that or I couldn&#39;t figure it<br/>
out, so here&#39;s a public, long-winded reply (for which I apologise, though I<br/>
should admit upfront that I do tend to be long-winded!).<br/>
<br/>
I went through a similar stage with my younger daughter (now 2.3) when she<br/>
was about that age. This was just around the time I transistioned her from<br/>
our bed to a queen sized futon she shares with her older sister (5<br/>
tomorrow!). (We went with the queen sized bed so the two could sleep<br/>
together and so I could lie down with them when necessary.) It didn&#39;t seem<br/>
at the time as if the transition had anything to do with her suddenly<br/>
increased night nursing, though it&#39;s possible. But she suddenly went from<br/>
1-2 times a night to 4-5 and, like Amy, I thought I was going to go nuts and<br/>
seriously considered night weaning her, though I&#39;d been committed to kid-led<br/>
weaning. Well, this went on for about three weeks, during which time I never<br/>
got around to figuring out how I&#39;d go about the night weaning. And, lo and<br/>
behold, one night she slept through 12 hours from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. and has<br/>
done so ever since. If she wakes up in the middle of the night even twice a<br/>
month that&#39;s a lot, by contrast to her sister who wakes up to come and find<br/>
me at least five nights out of seven. (And now dd2 nurses twice a day, first<br/>
thing in the morning and last thing before sleep, and occasionally at other<br/>
times if she&#39;s stressed or bored.)<br/>
<br/>
All of which is to say that this could well be just a stage, and you could<br/>
well have a happy surprise at the end of it. In hindsight, it almost seemed<br/>
as if dd2 was stocking up on the night nursing before her big switch to<br/>
sleeping the night through (which she had never before done, not once.) And,<br/>
in hindsight, I&#39;m really glad I didn&#39;t interfere, but let her have what she<br/>
needed. I didn&#39;t cut her off, and she learned to sleep through the night all<br/>
by herself. Of course, YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve really enjoyed the postings on this list since I joined and<br/>
look forward to more in the months and years to come.<br/>
<br/>
(Okay, a quick intro for those of you who are still with me -- I&#39;m Ashley ,<br/>
mom to Willis, now 5, adopted from China at 11 months,  and Frances,<br/>
bio-baby, age 2.3. I&#39;ve been committed to homeschooling since way before I<br/>
had kids, even while I was doing my teacher training at Bank Street College<br/>
in the late 1980&#39;s. We live in rural northern California. There are a lot of<br/>
homeschoolers in our area, though I haven&#39;t really tapped in to the local<br/>
network yet. We&#39;re pretty unstructured at this point. I marvel at how much<br/>
the girls are processing and &quot;working&quot; and learning as I watch them play. I<br/>
am very lucky in that they get along very well and are happy to play<br/>
together all day long. My biggest concern at this point is finding ways to<br/>
keep my younger happy while I do stuff with my older. Since they do get<br/>
along so well, they always want to be together, and if I set up something<br/>
fun to occupy the younger, the older wants to do it to instead of what I&#39;d<br/>
had in mind, and if I do something with the older, the younger wants to join<br/>
in even if she then gets bored and wanders off. Naps are not the answer --<br/>
if either of my kids nap they are awake till midnight, and they have planty<br/>
of stamina to get through the day and evening without napping, so we don&#39;t<br/>
do naps.) This is not a huge problem; we muddle through well enough despite<br/>
the distractions and interruptions, but I&#39;d be interested to hear how others<br/>
handle this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Enough about us. I enjoy this list, and find it&#39;s helped me focus a little<br/>
better on how I want to approach things. It is well worth the time -- and<br/>
that&#39;s saying a lot, since I have NO time!)<br/>
<br/>
My best wishes to all of you, and good luck to Amy!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472175795">Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly how sleep deprived you must feel since my 18-month-old<br/>
is a frequent nurser throughout the day and night and has always been. Of<br/>
course us having a family bed and me being able to fall asleep during her<br/>
night nursings makes a huge difference. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve read somewhere<br/>
that the time from one year to around 18 months is a time when your child<br/>
will nurse like a newborn. That&#39;s certainly true with us. It could also have<br/>
a lot to do with developmental stuff, teething, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think my first piece of advice for you would be to try to make the family<br/>
bed work by putting the mattress of your bed on the floor and adding another<br/>
mattress to it, or by placing ds&#39;s crib (I assume that&#39;s what he sleeps in)<br/>
next to your bed as a sidecar. That way he&#39;d be right by you yet you&#39;d still<br/>
have more space.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your son would also be satisfied with some back rubs or another form<br/>
of comfort to replace some of those nursings. I&#39;ve heard other moms say<br/>
their kids didn&#39;t nurse as often if they left a light on somewhere nearby or<br/>
if they gave them a high protein snack like cheese right before bed to<br/>
satiate any hunger pangs they might have at night.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can come up with a solution to help you out of your sleep<br/>
deprived state. Otherwise, I&#39;d say nap with him during the day if that&#39;s at<br/>
all possible (probably hard to do with other children around, huh?).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890108419">Hi Amy;<br/>
<br/>
I know and understand your desperation!  I&#39;ve been through this same<br/>
scenario 3 times myself.  I can assure you ABSOLUTELY, your 16 month old<br/>
will indeed be able to sleep on his own, without nursing when he is<br/>
mature and ready, on his time.  My toddlers regularly went through<br/>
phases of excessive nursing at night.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s teething or<br/>
growth spurts or renewed separation anxiety, but I have encountered<br/>
periods with hourly nursings or worse at night...there have been times<br/>
when after the 12th nursing I have lost count!  It doesn&#39;t last, it&#39;s<br/>
only a phase, (though it may last longer than you&#39;d care to hope for...)<br/>
and my kids are all doing very well now.  Don&#39;t let a misinformed doctor<br/>
discourage you!  Can you sneak even a 15-20 minute nap in during the day<br/>
to recharge your batteries if you are feeling sleep-deprived? Maybe even<br/>
a couple of quickie naps through the day will help you to hang in.  Or<br/>
can you nurse lying down during the day?  I know for me, even those 5<br/>
minutes of being horizontal during the day, for every or most nursings,<br/>
can really help the body to rest and relax.  I know it&#39;s rough but if<br/>
you can continue to endure, know that your baby is nursing regularly<br/>
through the night because he needs to.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supporting you and sending cyber naps your way now!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944927243">Hi, I just wanted to add that, sometimes little ones are really<br/>
*thirsty* (or even hungry) at night, and would benefit from a<br/>
good drink of water (or a snack). See that they get enough to<br/>
drink before bed, and offer a drink of water instead of the<br/>
breast in the night. This sometimes worked for us.<br/>
<br/>
When my little ones were a just about two, I&#39;d sometimes tell<br/>
them that I was *so* tired, and ask if they&#39;d please have water<br/>
instead, or just nurse for a minute or two. They were often able<br/>
to be very considerate of my needs. (So sweet.)<br/>
