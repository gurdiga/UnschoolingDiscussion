<div id="ygrps-yiv-626022585">&lt;&lt;Hey Kris,<br/>
<br/>
Where in Oregon are you?  We&#39;re in Northern CA (about 5 hrs <br/>
drive from Medford).<br/>
<br/>
Meghan&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We live just south of Portland in a little town called Lake Oswego.  We<br/>
like it here and rarely miss California, especially because we were in<br/>
such an arid place.  I love the green and rain.<br/>
<br/>
We almost made a trip to Sacramento in April for my mom&#39;s 80th birthday<br/>
but Jonathan got sick on the way.  We spent the night in Grant&#39;s Pass and<br/>
had to come home the next morning, poor guy was bad off.  The last time<br/>
we took a trip somewhere (Minnesota) he got VERY sick too, I&#39;m thinking<br/>
we might call a halt to &quot;trips&quot; until he&#39;s a bit older.<br/>
<br/>
Kris<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s carsickness, I had it lots as a kid and I know what helped me (but I <br/>
rarely got such considerations):  nobody smoking in the car, and getting to <br/>
sit in the front.  <br/>
<br/>
The other kids thought I was just faking sick to get to sit in the front.  <br/>
NO, I was truly very pukingly sick.  But then my parents both smoked <br/>
cigarettes in the car.<br/>
<br/>
If none of those factors (those or the wristbands) will help, then maybe <br/>
Dramamine?  I&#39;ve outgrown my motion sickness pretty  much, but when I was in <br/>
my 20&#39;s Dramamine was the only way I could use airplanes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549262136">Hey Kris.  I have a question about Oregon.  I would absolutely love, love,<br/>
love to move to Oregon...specifically Portland or Lake Oswego.  And you live<br/>
in Lake Oswego and moved from California .  Here¹s my question; how have you<br/>
adjusted to the lack of sunshine?  That is the only thing stopping us from<br/>
moving from Southern Cal.  I have visions of weeks and weeks with no sun.<br/>
Is that the case?  How do you adjust?  Do you get depressed?  Portland is<br/>
always rated as one of the best places to live and lots of people just love<br/>
it, but what about <br/>
the sun!!! :)<br/>

I will give those a try for my daughter, she gets car sick but Jonathan<br/>
was sick with a bacterial infection and then a virus.  On the first trip<br/>
we traveled by train to Minnesota and he became violently ill.  I took<br/>
him to a doctor there and they think it was just the introduction of a<br/>
new ecoli from the local water.<br/>
<br/>
On this last trip he came down with high fever and vomiting from an<br/>
influenza virus.  Overall it just seems to be bad timing and<br/>
circumstance.<br/>

Hi Isabel<br/>
<br/>
Well, I love the rain and even bemoaned the lack of it in San Diego so it<br/>
wasn&#39;t too much of an adjustment for me.  I have had one episode of<br/>
depression that I can remember and thankfully we had a couple days of sun<br/>
right then.  I mentioned this to my doctor and she said that even when<br/>
it&#39;s overcast you get the benefits of the sun if you go outside for a<br/>
bit.<br/>
<br/>
Oregonians do everything in the rain; mow the lawn, eat outside (under a<br/>
cover), go for walks, etc.  There are a lot of available indoor<br/>
activities and people here seem to look forward to the winter months as<br/>
their time to cocoon.  Some of my friends have a few full spectrum lights<br/>
around the house, they say it helps so I&#39;m gonna give it a try next<br/>
winter.<br/>
<br/>
My one recommendation would be to find a place which offers the kids some<br/>
space to move.  I live in a small space but I try to keep a space in my<br/>
living room for jumping, wrestling, etc.  My furniture is open ground for<br/>
climbing and jumping.  However, kids don&#39;t seem to mind playing in<br/>
jackets, gloves and rain boots either.  We have a membership to the<br/>
Children&#39;s Museum which is good for a few hours of wandering.<br/>
<br/>
We have a long summer here too with a lot of sun and temps around 80,<br/>
sometimes around 100 but not for long periods.  Lake Oswego is a pretty<br/>
little town but the lake is not a good choice for swimming, very silty<br/>
and leeches.  There are plenty of indoor pools available though.  We are<br/>
not actually &quot;in&quot; Lake Oswego even though our address says we are, it&#39;s<br/>
more like Lake Grove.  We are just across the freeway from Tualatin and<br/>
Tigard and it&#39;s only about 10 minutes in different directions to<br/>
Portland, Beaverton, Oregon City and Milwaukee.<br/>
<br/>
Kris<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572134990">Hi all. I just had to pop in and say how much I&#39;m enjoying all the Oregon <br/>
info. We&#39;re planning a move to Corvallis as soon as we can sell our house <br/>
here in Utah.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hot and dry and sunny here in Utah most of the time. Very dry. Except <br/>
for when we&#39;re snowed in under two feet of snow in the winter. Actually, <br/>
forget the winter. It&#39;s been snowing here on and off this past week! (I&#39;m in <br/>
the mountains.) I&#39;m looking forward to the Oregon rain and mist. :o)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
