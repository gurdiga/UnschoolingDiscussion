An audio program for the child that wants to do cartoon voices?<br/>

Money to go to SC ;)<br/>

Tax break for a bigger vehicle? (this is an issue for us right now)<br/>

A tax credit for a computer purchase (needed for the parent and the child)<br/>

Here in Maine the students in 6th grade get a laptop.  (my son would love to <br/>
have one to do all his Xbox code searches, Ebay, Game sites, research places <br/>

<br/>
Hmm, a tax credit would be nice.<br/>
Just thinking out loud, this has been on my mind for a couple months.<br/>
Not only do we loose an income (by choice I know) but we spend funds we dont <br/>
have to raise wonderful children and PS gets paid to what? Yell, punish, <br/>
squash hopes and dreams bla bla bla....<br/>
I want my tax dollars back! <br/>

$37,000&quot;.  Grrrr.  For a job where you&#39;re home by three, have <br/>
weekends off and a &quot;year&quot; is 36 weeks, $37,000 is decent money.  In <br/>
my hometown, my high school was shut down (I was in the last <br/>
graduating class) because of lack of funds.  The teachers were making <br/>
$60,000 and the average citizen was making about $20,000 when the <br/>
mill wasn&#39;t on strike (the mill is *always* on strike).  The teachers <br/>
went on strike to try to force the parents to pass *another* levy for <br/>
more money and the parents said no.<br/>

<br/>
I would like to earn that much too, however I suspect the teachers<br/>
believe that the $37,000 is low in comparison to other &quot;professionals&quot;<br/>
who are degreed - doctors, lawyers. The idea is that to attract the<br/>
&quot;best minds&quot; to teaching it should have parity, and that there is a high<br/>
turnover and ratio of people leaving the profession. Unfortunately for<br/>
the teaching profession, the actual good results of homeschoolers, show<br/>
that the level of education on the part of the parents, is less<br/>
important than love, compassion, interest, commitment and time-spent<br/>
together. Nonetheless, if by some horrible circumstance my dd had to<br/>
attend school, I&#39;d hope she had a new idealistic teacher still full of<br/>
compassion, interest, commitment and joy, who had yet to become jaded<br/>
and burnt out by the system.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I thought I hear a lot about teachers not being paid enough for the work <br/>

<br/>
They have to go to college some of those summers.  Full time grad student <br/>
rates, and the school doesn&#39;t pay for that.  Few other professions force <br/>
people to keep going to college.  Lots of other kinds of companies will pay <br/>
for classes.<br/>
<br/>
I made diddly when I taught.  My first year was under $8,000, 1974/75.  They <br/>
pressed to raise it all over the place.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith eventually, ten years of putzing,  got through engineering and math <br/>
classes enough to graduate with a minor in theatre and started low in his <br/>
field at over $30,000.  So what he has to go to work every day?  He spends <br/>
half the day sitting by himself listening to music and surfing the internet, <br/>
answering his e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Being with 30 to 130 kids all day in a school is NOT easy, and for all that <br/>
my kids aren&#39;t there, if any of you think being a teacher is easy, go <br/>
substitute for a week or two and see if you&#39;d do that for less that most <br/>
people make.<br/>

teachers and many are in back-breaking jobs for twelve hours a day <br/>
year-round.  Teaching is middle class.  It&#39;s not poor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451822219">My dad was making about 50,000 when he retired from teaching.  Plus <br/>
he often got jobs during the summer on top of that.  I can&#39;t remember <br/>
exactly how long it&#39;s been since he&#39; retired, but it&#39;s been 5-10 <br/>
years.  I think 50,000 is awfully good money!  We&#39;re living on less <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251190463">I was playing around on Google to see just where people are coming <br/>
from on the topic of income and I noticed that Albuquerque has an <br/>
average household income of $50,000 while my hometown has an average <br/>
household income of $26,000.  So that&#39;s why Sandra thinks $37,000 is <br/>
less than most people make and I think it&#39;s not bad money!  I moved <br/>
to Columbus because we were sick of being dirt poor and even in <br/>
Columbus the average household income is $40,000 which is still <br/>

I don&#39;t get the glare, but I have, in the past, accused my teacher mom<br/>
and my teacher grandma of talking and acting as if they were the only<br/>
adult in the room.  I see how the habit could be developed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45461983">Definitely &quot;teacher talk.&quot;  Although, many teachers I know do not engage in<br/>
this type of speak...s-i-l seems to have mastered it!  I am typically left aghast<br/>
at her comments, not quite sure how to respond to her baited words...in front<br/>
of extended family.<br/>
<br/>
Which can be good...it seems to throw her off when I don&#39;t respond, as if she was<br/>
hoping for a juicy argument.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that my oldest is 12, and capable of holding his own in a conversation...he&#39;s<br/>
doing an excellent job of demonstrating his home learning all by himself.  <br/>
S-i-l&#39;s husband loves him...they sit and talk for hours when the family<br/>
gets together.  He tells me what a pleasure it is to talk with my young man, and<br/>
how it&#39;s so fascinating to see the way he is absorbing so much info by focusing<br/>
on the things that interest him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even want to think about the trouble he is in when he gets home.   : )<br/>

  That must be what me a DH call &quot;teacher Talk&quot;.  You know, they talk <br/>
  to everyone in the same manner they talk to their students.  The <br/>
  sort, look down their nose, whatever are you thinking glare.   My SIL <br/>
  is so condescending has such a know it all manner that she turns most <br/>
  of us off.  What a shame for her and her poor husband &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I was playing around on Google to see just where people are coming <br/>
<br/>
from on the topic of income and I noticed that Albuquerque has an <br/>
<br/>
average household income of $50,000 while my hometown has an average <br/>
<br/>
household income of $26,000.  So that&#39;s why Sandra thinks $37,000 is <br/>
<br/>
less than most people make and I think it&#39;s not bad money!  I moved <br/>
<br/>
to Columbus because we were sick of being dirt poor and even in <br/>
<br/>
Columbus the average household income is $40,000 which is still <br/>
<br/>
considerably less than Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh!  Thanks.  Good.<br/>
<br/>
The first town I ever heard of offering beginning teachers over $20,000 was <br/>
El Paso.  <br/>
It&#39;s not that El Paso has a high average; it&#39;s that nobody wanted to live in <br/>
El Paso, so it was bonus pay.  We were amazed, $20,000+  (I think it as <br/>
$24,000 starting, and I think it was early 80&#39;s and I have a bad memory for <br/>
numbers so I could be wrong.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815258278">IMO - $63,000 is way too much!<br/>
Here in RI, the town of Lincoln - drowning in red ink, wanted to cancel the last two days of school. That would have saved the town well over something like $300,000 ( or was it $500,00?)<br/>
Anyway - the union said NO - they couldn&#39;t lose the income.<br/>
