<br/>
An editorial here that appeared yesterday in a Japanese newspaper <br/>
concerning a part of the &quot;education crisis&quot; that rarely gets reported: <br/>
the severe lack of library books available for schoolchildren in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Are Japanese public school students getting dumbed down? Read the <br/>
following article for a look at yet another aspect of contemporary <br/>
education in Japan. <br/>

DON&#39;T SHORTCHANGE YOUNG READERS<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/geted.pl5?ed20001003a1.htm">http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/geted.pl5?ed20001003a1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Despite all the talk about the need for educational reforms, little <br/>
serious attention is being paid to a fundamental way in which Japan&#39;s <br/>
schoolchildren are being shortchanged. Except among the educators <br/>
directly involved, few have expressed concern over the Education <br/>
Ministry&#39;s announcement that libraries in elementary and junior high <br/>
schools nationwide are lacking the astonishing total of more than 65 <br/>
million books -- books they should have if they were following the new <br/>
standards set by the ministry in 1993.<br/>
<br/>
This means that, on average, each school is short 2,600 library books <br/>
that could be providing a wide range of information and knowledge to the <br/>
nation&#39;s children. The 1993 standards were intended to raise the number <br/>
of books on school library shelves by 1.5 times, on the basis of the <br/>
number of pupils enrolled. Yet fully 70 percent of the elementary schools <br/>
and 80 percent of the junior high schools acknowledged in a survey <br/>
conducted in May 1999 that they have fewer books on their shelves than <br/>
are recommended. This is so even though the Education and Home Affairs <br/>
ministries together have been allocating some 10 billion yen a year to <br/>
municipalities to help them meet the new targets.<br/>
<br/>
Too many schools are failing to do so, since some 14 percent of <br/>
elementary school libraries and nearly 22 percent of junior high school <br/>
libraries have fewer than half the books they should. The reason for this <br/>
is not because enrollments are down, but because in the face of budget <br/>
shortfalls some schools are using the funds for other purposes. Local <br/>
school boards are entitled to do this, but it strongly suggests that the <br/>
invaluable role school libraries can play in supplementing textbook <br/>
education is still not sufficiently recognized or appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
This is regrettable at a time when so much attention is being focused on <br/>
the global information-technology revolution in which Prime Minister <br/>
Yoshiro Mori wants Japan to play a leading role. The great advantage that <br/>
good books can provide in stimulating young imaginations and encouraging <br/>
the development of natural curiosity is still minimized by an educational <br/>
system that emphasizes textbook learning above all.<br/>
<br/>
School library-book shortages also stem in part from the fact that such <br/>
libraries, and indeed all libraries for the general public, are a recent <br/>
historical development here. Japan&#39;s literacy rate rose to nearly 100 <br/>
percent after school attendance became compulsory in the Meiji period <br/>
(1868-1912), but the achievement was reached largely through textbooks <br/>
authorized by the Education Ministry. That suited the political and <br/>
military leaders of the time.<br/>
                                                                <br/>
When the first public library in the country opened in Tokyo in 1872, a <br/>
few private schools had modest libraries, but most schools&#39; book <br/>
collections were negligible. A greatly different situation began to <br/>
develop soon after the end of World War II. Under the guidance of <br/>
Occupation authorities, the Education Ministry issued a School Library <br/>
Handbook in 1948. Two years later, in 1950, the Japan School Library <br/>
Association was established, and this was followed by enactment of the <br/>
School Library Law in 1953, authorizing funds to support public school <br/>
libraries. Since all schools in the country now have libraries, why are <br/>
so many of them still failing to adequately provide the supplementary <br/>
resources that pupils need?<br/>
<br/>
One more reason is that it is not only books that are in short supply. <br/>
Japan also suffers from a severe shortage of trained librarians. When <br/>
Education Ministry officials surveyed the schools last year, only 574 <br/>
registered librarians were recorded nationwide.<br/>
<br/>
The ministry is now calling on prefectural boards of education to train <br/>
and hire more school librarians. Any school with more than 12 classes <br/>
will be required to have a trained librarian on the staff from the start <br/>
of fiscal 2003. That means the hiring of some 24,000 librarians by <br/>
elementary and junior high schools around the country are needed, but the <br/>
aim is realistic only if bureaucrats and the public are made aware of the <br/>
vital role they can play.<br/>
<br/>
Qualified librarians could help to stem the premature predictions being <br/>
heard in some quarters of the imminent demise of the printed book. It is <br/>
true that publishers are lamenting falling book sales and their lists are <br/>
increasingly heavy with &quot;manga&quot; comics for adults. It is equally true <br/>
that the Internet and other communications advances are creating new ways <br/>
for books to reach the hands of readers. None of this means that the book <br/>
is dead. A nation that does not promote reading will never be able to <br/>
take full advantage of the IT revolution. One way to ensure that books do <br/>
not disappear is to ensure that school libraries are able to fulfill <br/>
their promise.<br/>
