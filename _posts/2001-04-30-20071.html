<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not picking on your Johanna, just wanted to clarify<br/>
for everyone.  My name is Nanci, and there is at least<br/>
one Nancy on the list, so trying to keep us straight.<br/>
<br/>
We are moving to the Pacific NW, in the Seattle Area,<br/>
most likely near Federal Way at first.  We are working<br/>
on buildng an intentional community in that area (as<br/>
some of you know) and some of our community members<br/>
live in Federal Way, so we are trying to live close to<br/>
them before we buy land for our community.<br/>

hope the move goes well. I keep hoping for more people in my area that believe in unschooling. Not a lot in my neck of the woods. And sorry for the name spelling.<br/>
