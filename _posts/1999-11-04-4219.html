<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058915239"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I worry about...toddler programs that are geared for<br/>
&gt;children entering the school system.  Franklin and Little Bear are the<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;because they&#39;re about &quot;days in life of&quot;.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I Love Little Bear!  Explain to me how it could focus on an IS schooling<br/>
mentality when Little Bear does not go to school and in fact spends his<br/>
time unschooling by wandering around playing in the woods, doing cooking<br/>
experiemnts at home, using his imagination and playing with his friends.<br/>
The only edpisode I have ever seen which even mentioned school was one in<br/>
which his best freind Emily had to start attending school and so would be<br/>
gone from the Forest until the following summer.  So Little Bear taught<br/>
himself to read and write (with a little help from Mother and Father Bear)<br/>
at home so that he could send letters to her.  Anyhow, I was just curious<br/>
what you found negative about it, since we all love it so much at our house.<br/>
