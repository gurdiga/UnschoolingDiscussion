<div id="ygrps-yiv-620122410">I loved your post...<br/>
<br/>
I am new so would be happy to provide information.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you un/home school?  We have decided to un/homeschool because our <br/>
children are very bright, articulate, and creative.  I do not want that <br/>
taken away from them by someone telling them that their individualism <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter, what society wants them to be is much more important.  They <br/>
must be like everyone else! (YECK)<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have, how old, and names?  2 children, 1 son Mac <br/>
who is 5 and one daughter Mara who is 3.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Well, Mac has been <br/>
interested in trains since he was 18 months old.  That is still ongoing.  <br/>
However, he has added skyscrapers and bridges to his interests.  He is also <br/>
interested in reading and has just started reading some books on his own.  <br/>
Mara doesn&#39;t really have any outstanding interests at this time.  She really <br/>
likes board games and animals.<br/>
<br/>
WHat area does your family live in?  The Northeast.<br/>
<br/>
Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
DO you have any pets?   yes, 5 cats, one dog and 2 fish<br/>
<br/>
ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  We also are very spiritual.  We are very <br/>
active members of our Unitarian Universalist church.  I have to add <br/>
something that my son said to me today, as I felt that it was the most <br/>
wonderful thing anyone has every said to me.  &quot;Mom, when I was inside you, I <br/>
could see everything there.&quot;  Dad then proceeded to ask if he could see my <br/>
heart.  &quot;Oh, yes.  That was my favorite part.  Your heart is beautiful Mom&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I too am extremely grateful at having found this list and have been enjoying <br/>
your posts.  I wish that we weren&#39;t so busy right now (dance recitals) so <br/>
that I could reply to more...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277372977">Ok, here goes:<br/>
<br/>
 Why do you un/home school?  We have decided to un/homeschool because of all <br/>
the reasons already mentioned.  Both my hubby and I feel that we would have <br/>
been better off homeschooled.  We both were extremely bored in school which <br/>
led my hubby into a lot of trouble.  I would have loved to be given the <br/>
freedom to learn at my own pace.  I believe I would have been much happier <br/>
and not felt so stupid.  I don&#39;t want that for our children.  I want them to <br/>
learn because they love it.  As I finally do now.<br/>
 <br/>
 How many children do you have, how old, and names?  2 children, 1 daughter <br/>
Alexis, a.k.a. Ali, who is three and one son Matthew who is 1<br/>
 <br/>
 What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Matthew loves buttons, <br/>
knob, doors, holes and anything that goes in them.  He is into pulling things <br/>
behind himself, including a hand held massager (by the cord, no less), which <br/>
is his favorite.  Ali has discover a seris of phonics books called Word Bird, <br/>
which she loves.  I think she is starting to decode our language, some.  So <br/>
we have been reading tons of those.  She loves the outdoors, but we live in <br/>
an apt. so we have little space to run and be free.  The next move is for <br/>
more outdoor space!<br/>
 <br/>
 WHat area does your family live in?  The Southheast.<br/>
 <br/>
 Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  I don&#39;t know <br/>
that much about them, yet.  I am still overcoming my fears that they will <br/>
learn what they need to when they need it.  That is why I am starting early.  <br/>
hee hee  While my heart believes this theory, my head is lagging behind.<br/>
 <br/>
 DO you have any pets?   yes, 1 cats, one dog <br/>
 <br/>
 ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  My little ones and I are very involved in <br/>
volunteering for La Leche League and we are getting ready to start an <br/>
Attachment Parenting group in the town we just moved to. Both my hubby and I <br/>
are new to natural living but we are getting there.  Right after our move, we <br/>
get stuck in a tv rut,  so now we are battling out of that.  <br/>
<br/>
Well better run, we are off to pick blueberries this morning.<br/>
chat later<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

This recipe is from &quot;Tightwad Gazette&quot; Volume 1, p. 292, and she says she<br/>
got it from the &quot;Yankee&quot; magazine.  We have made it several times.<br/>
<br/>
3 cups uncooked oatmeal<br/>
2 cups unbleached flour<br/>
1 cup wheat germ<br/>
3 Tbsp sugar<br/>
1 tsp salt<br/>
3/4 cup oil<br/>
1 cup water<br/>
<br/>
Mix ingredients and roll out onto two cookie sheets.  (author recommends a<br/>
plastic tumbler for rolling)<br/>
Sprinkle with salt, lightly roll again to press salt in.  cut into squares<br/>
or diamonds.  (A pizza cutter works well.)  Bake at 350 degrees.  After 20<br/>
minutes, begin checking.  The outer ones are usually done first.  Remove<br/>
crackers as they turn golden brown and hard.<br/>
  optional:  add a few tablespoons of poppy or sesame seeds.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I loved your post...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am new so would be happy to provide information.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you un/home school?  We have decided to un/homeschool because <br/>
&gt;our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; children are very bright, articulate, and creative.  I do not want <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taken away from them by someone telling them that their <br/>
&gt;individualism<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t matter, what society wants them to be is much more <br/>
&gt;important.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;They<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; must be like everyone else! (YECK)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How many children do you have, how old, and names?  2 children, 1 <br/>
&gt;son<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Mac<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who is 5 and one daughter Mara who is 3.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Well, Mac has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in trains since he was 18 months old.  That is still <br/>
&gt;ongoing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, he has added skyscrapers and bridges to his interests.  He <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in reading and has just started reading some books on his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;own.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mara doesn&#39;t really have any outstanding interests at this time.  <br/>
&gt;She<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likes board games and animals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WHat area does your family live in?  The Northeast.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  Yes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DO you have any pets?   yes, 5 cats, one dog and 2 fish<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  We also are very spiritual.  We <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; active members of our Unitarian Universalist church.  I have to add<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something that my son said to me today, as I felt that it was the <br/>
&gt;most<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wonderful thing anyone has every said to me.  &quot;Mom, when I was <br/>
&gt;inside<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could see everything there.&quot;  Dad then proceeded to ask if he could <br/>
&gt;see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heart.  &quot;Oh, yes.  That was my favorite part.  Your heart is <br/>
&gt;beautiful<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Mom&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I too am extremely grateful at having found this list and have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;enjoying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your posts.  I wish that we weren&#39;t so busy right now (dance <br/>
&gt;recitals)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I could reply to more...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273240455">Why do you un/home school? Because we want  o ur children to have an<br/>
education that does not pressure them into being people they don&#39;t want to<br/>
be. Because we want our children to be able to study physics and biology one<br/>
day and to learn by watching Dragon Tales the next. Because we want our<br/>
children to grow up to be free thinking, accepting, well rounded<br/>
individuals.<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have, how old, and names: 3 girls, Samantha 7, Dana<br/>
4, Casey 2<br/>
<br/>
-&gt;  What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Samantha; reading<br/>
chapter books (where the red fern grows- right now) and math; Dana; learning<br/>
to read and write (esp. her name); Casey; getting over her most recent ear<br/>
infection and nursing like a newborn<br/>
<br/>
WHat area does your family live in?  Northern MA<br/>
<br/>
Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state? State&#39;s pretty<br/>
good (one of the best in the u.s. so I&#39;m told) My city is excellent; the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452191598">Why do you un/homeschool: Because I want to be there when my girls make new <br/>
discoveries and to see the excited looks on their faces.  Because I believe <br/>
that I am their first teacher and I don&#39;t want to pass their education off <br/>
to someone else to take care of.  Because I had very bad experiences as a <br/>
child in the public school system and wish that I had been homeschooled.  <br/>
Because I&#39;m selfish and I really miss my kids when they are away from me.  <br/>
And because I want my girls to do what they want to do and go at their own <br/>
pace without having someone elses agenda and labels pushed on them.  I could <br/>
go on and on but I think that basically says it. =)<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have?  I have two girls.  Lili who is 4 and Tacy <br/>
who is 2.<br/>
<br/>
What are your childrens most recent interests?  Lili is really into fish and <br/>
going to the beach right now.  She also loves puzzles, counting, learning <br/>
EVERYONES name, cooking, playing in the sprinkler,and her favorite show is <br/>
the Crocodile Hunter.  Tacy is really into Dinosaurs, playing dress up, <br/>
taking things apart, playing in her puddling pool, teletubbies, and <br/>
coloring.<br/>
<br/>
What area does your family live in?  We live on Terciera Island, in the <br/>
Azores Archipelago which is a territory of Portugal.  We are a military <br/>
family so I&#39;m not quite sure of the homeschooling laws but as far as I&#39;m <br/>
aware the military is very supportive of homeschooling as a lot of families <br/>
on the island homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any pets?  OY! We have two cats, fish, turtles, a dog and her 5 <br/>
puppies, and my daughter is really pushing for a Lillygoat.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you would like to add?  I think its wonderful to find this <br/>
list for help, ideas and support.   Both my husbands family and my own are <br/>
against my homeschooling the girls and its nice to have someone to go to if <br/>
I need help or have questions.  I spent the past hour reading everyones <br/>
introductions and its nice to see that everyone has so much in common.  We <br/>
are new to unschooling but so far I&#39;m really happy with it.  We are trying <br/>
to live naturally and eat organic foods but Military life is NOT conducive <br/>
to the kind of lifestyle I think would be ideal for my family,however I am <br/>
trying to get around that.  Right now we are in base housing with a tiny <br/>
community yard that I can&#39;t garden in, but we are hoping to move off base <br/>
into the local Portuguese community, into a nice little house with a yard.  <br/>
My husband is southern baptist but I can&#39;t say I have a clue as to how I <br/>
would classify my beliefs aside from the fact that I am not christian.  I am <br/>
still trying to learn more about different religions.  I saw that some of <br/>
you were Unitarian Universalist.  I don&#39;t know anything about that religion <br/>
but would love to learn if you could send me some good links? I look <br/>
foreward to hearing more about all of you in the coming months on this list.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;HI All!!   I just thought it would be a good idea to do some sort of intro, <br/>
&gt;which we may have already done. I get kinda confused on who&#39;s who.  And <br/>
&gt;since we have so many new people everyday, it would be nice to know more <br/>
&gt;about them.  So I&#39;ve listed a few categories, and filled my answers in <br/>
&gt;myself, so we can all get to know each other better.  This would be very <br/>
&gt;helpful to me, to get to know people better.  Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why do you un/home school?  I un/homeschool because I want the best  for my <br/>
&gt;child. I believe he is a unique, and wonderful individual who has the right <br/>
&gt;to learn at his own pace, and cultivate the skills that are inherent in him <br/>
&gt;naturally.  So that when he grows up he may choose a labour of love, that <br/>
&gt;best suits him, and that he will consider to be his life work, rather than <br/>
&gt;serve his community in a position that does not encourage his spirit to be <br/>
&gt;whole.  The public school system does not offer the means to achieve this <br/>
&gt;goal.  His emotional, spiritual, mental, and educational health depends on <br/>
&gt;his freedom to choose his own path of learning, and I am here to provide <br/>
&gt;him with the resources to cultivate his dreams, so he can make them come <br/>
&gt;true(we can go on forever with this one , eh&#39;?)<br/>
&gt;How many children do you have, how old, and names(if you wish)?  1 son, 4 <br/>
&gt;almost 5, Zain<br/>
&gt;What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Math concepts, through <br/>
&gt;asking various, and many people&quot;How old are you?&quot;, and many follow-up <br/>
&gt;questions, He is comparing and figuring in his head........Magicians,,we <br/>
&gt;read book last night about magicians, and he was real interested, so for <br/>
&gt;his birthday next month , I&#39;ve just arranged to have a real magician come, <br/>
&gt;doves, wands, and all...WHAT fun! Pajama Sam games, and carrying little <br/>
&gt;gadgets in his pockets for saving the day.  (his favorite clothes are the <br/>
&gt;ones with many pockets)<br/>
&gt;WHat area does your family live in?  The Pacific Northwest, a beautiful <br/>
&gt;green, lush area.<br/>
&gt;Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  I need to <br/>
&gt;know more about them,  but as I have not run into any peroblems yet, I am <br/>
&gt;satisfied at this point.<br/>
&gt;DO you have any pets?   yes, 3 dogs  Bart, Cucca, & cedar   a wolf hybrid,a <br/>
&gt;sharpei, and a mix of the two    2 cats, Zalia, & Grandma  2 birds, finches <br/>
&gt;  Fred & wilma, and 3 fish<br/>
&gt;ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  We are avid plant and tree lovers..we <br/>
&gt;own a small Tree company, and I am a wildcrafter, and study <br/>
&gt;herbalism.....My honey is Dana, and I am Michelle..sometimes called <br/>
&gt;Snakefootwoman(my given name) We love Nature, Sweatlodge, and have a deep <br/>
&gt;connection with SPIRIT.  Many Blessings!  I;m intensely greatful for this <br/>
&gt;list, because it provides lots of information, supprt, and discussion...a <br/>
&gt;Big Thanks for all on the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There are no rules with this request.  Do as you please.          Michelle<br/>
&gt;(P.s) Add any appicable questions you feel are helpful to your own needs at <br/>
&gt;knowing people.<br/>

to spend the majority of their time with me and their father and each other, <br/>
because I don&#39;t want to miss a moment of their incredible little lives (it <br/>
goes much too quickly anyhow and I was never much good at sharing ; ).  <br/>
 How many children do you have, how old, and names(if you wish)? Jessica <br/>
almost 7, Zach 5 1/2, Jared 3<br/>
 What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)? Everything!  Lego, books, <br/>
pretend play using dolls, lego, playmobile, themselves....creating, building, <br/>
dreaming, climbing, riding, living<br/>
 WHat area does your family live in?  SoCal<br/>
 Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state? yes but <br/>
concerned about recent rash of hsers being harrassed and hauled into court <br/>
whom are following the current laws (in Nor Cal)<br/>
 DO you have any pets?   2 very old black labs : )<br/>
 ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add:  I enjoy gardening, but I am not the <br/>
&quot;best&quot; gardener out there (read, sometime I forget to water and things die!), <br/>
I love to scrapbook, garage sale or antique, hanging out with unschooling <br/>
friends, field trips, practice natural health, extended breastfeeding, <br/>
homebirth. As a family we enjoy rving; in the winter we ride motorcyces, <br/>
quads, dune buggy in the desert--in the summer we do the same in the higher <br/>
mountain regions.  Also in the summer we go to the lake or river and do water <br/>
sports.  This fall plan to take a two week rv trip across several northwest <br/>
states.  I have dreams of spending more time on the road exploring the US as <br/>
dh schedule allows.  I can&#39;t think of anything more pleasant and educational <br/>
than that!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727397000">Think this is a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you un/home school?  We unschool because I have seen what the school <br/>
system has done to my 17 yo daughter.  Unfortunately I was unaware of the <br/>
possibility of homeschooling until a few years ago and did not feel <br/>
comfortable with it then.  I put my son in ps for kindergarten and it was a <br/>
disaster.  It was then that I decided my two son&#39;s would not be hurt by the <br/>
system like my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have, how old, and names?  3 children, Danielle 17, <br/>
Joshua 7, and Brandon 11 months.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Being a teenager, Danielle <br/>
works two jobs, goes to school and wants her own car more than life itself.  <br/>
Joshua loves baseball, watching Zoomafoo (sorry about spelling) an animal <br/>
show and playing with his action figures.<br/>
<br/>
What area does your family live in?  Southeast<br/>
<br/>
Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
DO you have any pets?   yes, 1 cat and 2 mice (good mixture huh)<br/>
<br/>
Any thing else you&#39;d like to add:  I have just recently decided to try <br/>
unschooling instead of a structured homeschooling.  It has been very scary <br/>
and confusing but this list has made it easier.  It is nice to have somewhere <br/>
to turn when you feel you are not doing what is best for your child or you <br/>
need a pat on the shoulder once in a while.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15526868">Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, during a confrontation with my biological mother she <br/>
admitted to naming me Bridget Mary for more than the fact that she liked the <br/>
name.   My father wanted to name me Jessica Catherine and as far as he knew <br/>
thats what my name would be.  Well my Mother was mad at my father for <br/>
getting her pregnant as she didn&#39;t want me in the first place so she decided <br/>
at the last minute to name me Bridget (because my father didn&#39;t like the <br/>
name) and  Mary (because she was supposedly Catholic at the time) Apparently <br/>
she also thought that having the initials B.M. or B.S. (my maiden name is <br/>
Schwaderer) would be a cute way of getting back at my father too.  After <br/>
that I didn&#39;t want my name anymore so I changed it to Holly because I liked <br/>
it and my friends said that the name Holly suited me better anyway.   <br/>
However, now that I go by Holly I kind of feel like a fake using that name <br/>
sometimes and wonder If I overreacted to my biological mothers hurtful <br/>
comments by changing my name.   Either way, thats how I came to be called <br/>
Holly. =)  I didn&#39;t mean for it to be such a long story =)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795884651">holly-that is a very intresting story! mine is boring-i am bridget because <br/>
both of my grandmothers were bridget and my aunt is mary bridget as well as <br/>
her eldest daughter. that is why emma-my 19 month old-is not bridget-there <br/>
are so many of them in my family-anyway in irish bridget is brid, pronounced <br/>
breet pretty much-so maybe that could be an option for you...holly is so <br/>
pretty though!<br/>
