inserted. I cleaned it up and approved it anyway because I wanted to<br/>
comment on it.<br/>

I wish I could ask Maria Montessori why there is so much need for such<br/>
extensive teacher training in Montessori methods if education is so natural<br/>
and spontaneous.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this because it reminds us that physical activity, exploration,<br/>
investigation, practice, etc. are all a very significant part of learning.<br/>
However, &quot;listening to words&quot; or &quot;linguistic intelligence&quot; ala Howard<br/>
Gardner may be overvalued in schools, but it isn&#39;t worthless.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Around three years ago, just before I was choosing nurseries for my son, I came across Montessori&#39;s account while she was managing the Children&#39;s House in Rome. I liked what I read, so chose Montessori nurseries. As my son didn&#39;t want me to leave him, after battling with the management, I was allowed to stay during sessions so I was able to observe what&#39;s happening there. I didn&#39;t like it at all, far from Montessori&#39;s philosophy. The teachers are not concerned about children&#39;s learning but only about filling in portfolios to give to parents. We went through several Montessori nurseries as they invariable asked me to leave him alone and then my son didn&#39;t want to go to that place anymore. In some of these, the only resembles to Montessori method is in some of the toys they have, but none of the teachers were displaying any sort of knowledge of Montessori&#39;s philosophy in their interaction with children, or maybe they have forgotten it after being faced with real children.<br/>
<br/>
Current Montessori teachers actually don&#39;t quite understand how children learn and the whole thing is just business.</div>

As a Montessori teacher I&#39;d like to ask her some questions myself !  some things just don&#39;t translate well between the idealistic  training and what is expected of me.  Though there is a Montessori school in Lawrence, KS that does an excellent job from what I&#39;ve seen so there are some out there.<br/>
<br/>
It goes one step further than Montessori training - they get snooty about which training it is as well.  For example I&#39;m Montessori trained and certified by the American Montessori Society BUT Association Montessori International does not recognize my training as valid - I cannot attend any of their refresher courses, I cannot teach in their schools, etc.  AMI looks down their noses at any other training as not being pure enough or rigorous enough, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When we pulled our son out of my school, my main gripe was that if it had been a Montessori school based upon her original teachings he would have been happy not miserable and failing (well probably).<br/>
<br/>
The training I received on Montessori theory was priceless, but the way the academic side of it translates to public school where we still have to give tests, show academic growth, etc.  It has become another curriculum - I truly believe it is a better one than sitting at desks in rows, following a text book and doing work sheets, but it could be so much more than what it is if we could simply let children grow and develop at their own pace doing the things that draw their interest.<br/>

&gt; A friend of mine has an early childhood education degree and in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>process of earning the degree she had a chance to observe a Montesorri<br/>
classroom.  She recounted how a teacher &#39;corrected&#39; a child while playing<br/>
with blocks.  The little boy was pretending that his blocks were cars and<br/>
was happily making car sounds and having a pretend race.  The teacher took<br/>
the blocks from his hands and showed him that they were to be used for<br/>
building, not imaginative play....<br/>
<br/>
My friend stated that she nearly cried for this little boy.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason that these schools don&#39;t want parents around is because<br/>
they know that they aren&#39;t fulfilling the hype.<br/>
