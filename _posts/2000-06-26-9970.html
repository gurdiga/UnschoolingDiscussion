We&#39;ve made a point of telling our kids that we will pay for HALF of<br/>
college or university.<br/>
They have to come up with the other half. They are the ones deciding<br/>

responsibility for the financial burden.<br/>
<br/>
I pay good money to kids who do extra jobs to lighten my load ( I have<br/>
MS for those who don&#39;t know ).It beats paying a house cleaner to come in<br/>
once a week. This they either spend or put in the bank. They have ample<br/>
opportunity to make money for college without even leaving the house. If<br/>
they choose to spend what they earn that&#39;s their choice but we&#39;re still<br/>
only paying for half of college etc.<br/>
<br/>
Outside work costs them time travelling and sometimes money for travel,<br/>
uniforms etc.<br/>
Safety is another reason I&#39;d rather they work close to home or at home.<br/>
They also get paid crap wages for hard menial work at places like<br/>
McDonald&#39;s etc.<br/>
<br/>
They all have chores to do because they are part of the family but other<br/>
larger jobs I pay a decent wage for.<br/>
<br/>
Example ... Katie got paid $20 for doing some very heavy yard work<br/>
(dismantling a rock garden with very large rocks ... some the size of<br/>
three basketballs in length ).<br/>
Whe wasn&#39;t expecting to get paid but she put in such an all out effort I<br/>
felt she deserved fair compensation.<br/>
She also babysits and for awhile was a odd jobs girl for an elderly<br/>
neighbour until the neighbour moved.<br/>
<br/>
When they make their own way in the world they learn how to be<br/>
responsible for their money and themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Buzz .... I would never turn my kids away from our home. They know they<br/>
will always find food and a bed here if they need it. They&#39;ll also find<br/>
bathrooms to be cleaned....and yard work etc... to do to help compensate<br/>
for their room and board ;-)<br/>

What a wonderful observation!  I agree totally that we rise or sink to<br/>
other&#39;s expectations.  One of my pet peeves is the whole teenage culture<br/>
here in America.  My grandparents, actually even my parents, were supporting<br/>
themselves by the time they were 17.  We give our kids such mixed messages<br/>
today!  On the one hand we allow them to dress like adults, especially young<br/>
girls, let them engage in adult behaviors, yet shield them from the<br/>
consequences of their actions with &quot;he/she is just a kid&quot;.  No wonder they<br/>
are confused!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884597567">I have to respond to this.  Sue, you are so right.  We shelter our children <br/>
from so many things.  I agree when they are young that they shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
exposed to many things.  There does come a point in time, however, when <br/>
children are old enough to be responsible for themselves and it&#39;s not 18!  I <br/>
think that most kids are more than capable of being responsible by 16 or <br/>
younger.  I know that I basically have been responsible for myself (other <br/>
than food, shelter) pretty much since I was 14 years old.  If I had a job, <br/>
then I bought my school clothes.  I paid for college (haven&#39;t finished, but <br/>
will some day).  I paid for my very used car and my gas.  I couldn&#39;t agree <br/>
with you more (having a sister who is 24 and living at home, at least she <br/>
did mostly pay for college and her car).<br/>

&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] institutionalization of children<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, 26 Jun 2000 07:25:32 +0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is an unschooling issue in my mind.  Unschooling, &quot;un-daycare-ing&quot;,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s the same thing.  It&#39;s all about the de-institutionalization of<br/>
&gt; &gt; children!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sonia<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sonia,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This one little paragraph of yours summed it all up for me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This country, wonderful in so many ways has it&#39;s children<br/>
&gt;institutionalized more than any non-communist country, it also has<br/>
&gt;more of it&#39;s adults institutionalized [imprisoned] than any other<br/>
&gt;country in the world.   Is this a co-incidence?   I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the over institutionalization of the population along with the<br/>
&gt;overly prolongued childhood is a lot to do with the current situation.<br/>
&gt;  It came as a real surprise to me that even 50 years ago most<br/>
&gt;Americans finished high school and that even then quite a large<br/>
&gt;percentage went on to college.  What surprised me even more is<br/>
&gt;that so many parents work so long and hard to pay to get their kids<br/>
&gt;through college.  By the time a person is in college thay should be<br/>
&gt;making their own way in life, but here so many of them are<br/>
&gt;supported by Mommy and Daddy well into their 20&#39;s driving brand<br/>
&gt;new cars that were graduation gifts, carrying a credit card so they<br/>
&gt;can spend Mommy and Daddy&#39;s hard earned money when they<br/>
&gt;should be earning their own.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Way too may times I&#39;ve heard someone in their 20s refered to as<br/>
&gt;&quot;just a kid&quot;....  people tend to rise [or sink] to other&#39;s expectations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823325296">I had to reply to this.  I too have been responsible for my self and others <br/>
since I was 14.  Actually younger but that was not on a constant basis.  I <br/>
told my 17yo today (after a heated discussion of something she feels that I <br/>
am responsible for providing) that she has some choices to make.<br/>
<br/>
She is a wonderful child.  Did not grow up with everything in the beginning <br/>
but when I was able I tried to make up for past time.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  She <br/>
works two jobs and saves money well however, her money is her money.  She is <br/>
willing to give you a loan but of course you pay it back.  Now that I stay at <br/>
home and unschool her two younger brothers (she did not homeschol) she feels <br/>
I am being unfair to her.  She does nothing around the house unless tied in <br/>
chains to do so on the idea that she works.  I can&#39;t give them everything <br/>
they want anymore and do not want to do so.  I have realized my mistakes and <br/>
I know it will take some time to undo the harm.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have good morals however, have become very materialistic.  VERY MUCH <br/>
WORKING ON THIS!!  After Hurricane Andrew my daughter went to every house in <br/>
the neighborhood that had old people and helped them clean up the mess, paint <br/>
thier house and anything else that had to be done for free.  She was the <br/>
saint of the neighborhood.  What happened to that little girl?  Me that is <br/>
what happened.<br/>
<br/>
I have just started this quest of rehabilitation (as I grew up with <br/>
absolutely nothing and made my own way) and have realized it is not going to <br/>
be easy.  BUT it is necessary for their own sake.  Any ideas and prayers are <br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for listening,<br/>

When you have it figured out, please let me know as I too have created to <br/>
little monsters.  My parents worked so hard to give us what we had and I <br/>
really appreciated it.  I remember one Xmas when they gave my sister and I <br/>
bikes (me a ten speed and her a banana seat) and when we walked on the porch <br/>
and saw them, my sister just shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  I <br/>
thought my Dad was going to kill her!!  I wouldn&#39;t have blamed him and I see <br/>
that happening with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas out there for us??<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I had to reply to this.  I too have been responsible for my self and others<br/>
&gt;since I was 14.  Actually younger but that was not on a constant basis.  I<br/>
&gt;told my 17yo today (after a heated discussion of something she feels that I<br/>
&gt;am responsible for providing) that she has some choices to make.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;She is a wonderful child.  Did not grow up with everything in the beginning<br/>
&gt;but when I was able I tried to make up for past time.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  She<br/>
&gt;works two jobs and saves money well however, her money is her money.  She <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;willing to give you a loan but of course you pay it back.  Now that I stay <br/>
&gt;at<br/>
&gt;home and unschool her two younger brothers (she did not homeschol) she <br/>
&gt;feels<br/>
&gt;I am being unfair to her.  She does nothing around the house unless tied in<br/>
&gt;chains to do so on the idea that she works.  I can&#39;t give them everything<br/>
&gt;they want anymore and do not want to do so.  I have realized my mistakes <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;I know it will take some time to undo the harm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My kids have good morals however, have become very materialistic.  VERY <br/>
&gt;MUCH<br/>
&gt;WORKING ON THIS!!  After Hurricane Andrew my daughter went to every house <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;the neighborhood that had old people and helped them clean up the mess, <br/>
&gt;paint<br/>
&gt;thier house and anything else that had to be done for free.  She was the<br/>
&gt;saint of the neighborhood.  What happened to that little girl?  Me that is<br/>
&gt;what happened.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have just started this quest of rehabilitation (as I grew up with<br/>
&gt;absolutely nothing and made my own way) and have realized it is not going <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;be easy.  BUT it is necessary for their own sake.  Any ideas and prayers <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you for listening,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lorrie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801954025">I think this is a great idea. I have fibromyalgia and I often have days<br/>
(like today) when the fatigue and pain become so overwhelming, i don&#39;t think<br/>
i&#39;ll be able to get off the couch much less hs my kids. the support from a<br/>
list like this would be great.<br/>
