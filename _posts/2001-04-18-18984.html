<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032375132"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot; Valerie Stewart&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:vlos@...">vlos@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt;    ***This is my take also. I had a midwife and homebirths. In this state,<br/>
&gt; it was required of the midwife to take blood twice (to test for possible<br/>
&gt; Downs and spinal bifida) but that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting. Both of my babies were born in Washington and neither of my<br/>
midwives gave me these blood tests. I had to sign some sort of paper saying<br/>
yes, they had offered and I refused, and that was that. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s<br/>
required in Washington that they test you, only that they offer the test.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It was understood that if the baby<br/>
&gt; was a Down&#39;s baby, this would just give us time to prepare for that, and<br/>
&gt; that if the baby had spinal bifida, then a vaginal birth wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>been<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a great idea. Again, preparation, abortion wasn&#39;t even mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand the &quot;time to prepare&quot; argument, but these blood tests are so<br/>
notoriously innacurate that I think more often than not, they give people<br/>
time to panic, grieve, despair, come to terms with the condition of their<br/>
baby, only to realize upon the birth of a normal, healthy baby that they<br/>
spent those 6 months of pregnancy in mental hell for nothing. I&#39;ve known two<br/>
women now who were told that they were having Down&#39;s babies, only to<br/>
discover at birth that their babies were chromosomally normal (what a relief<br/>
that they didn&#39;t miscarry from an amnio or have an abortion - not that women<br/>
are be told that their baby was normal after they aborted it, I&#39;m sure).<br/>
I&#39;ve also had friends who ran the gamut of tests, ultrasounds, etc. and were<br/>
told that their baby was fine, only to have it be born with a fatal heart<br/>
defect. Personally, I&#39;d rather have the peace during the pregnancy. There<br/>
are so many unknowns at birth that cannot be foretold, that I believe the<br/>
best preparation for me was a peaceful and happy mind and heart for the<br/>
duration of my pregnancies. I know others may make different choices<br/>
though...<br/>

     Yes,  I felt this way also!  When I was pregnant the second time, I <br/>
skipped one of the blood tests for that reason and later, at 7 mos, my doctor <br/>
had me go in for an ultrasound because I was gaining so fast and we all <br/>
discovered it was two babies  (a shock but a good one).  Had I had the blood <br/>
test, it would have come out abnormal because of the twins (he said back at <br/>
the time he offered it that this was one reason for an abnormal result).  We <br/>
would have been stressed out for no reason.  But I do understand, as you say, <br/>
that others may feel differently and have different choices (being prepared, <br/>
as was mentioned).<br/>
     Just a weird sidenote...I was pregnant with my 4th (3rd time) in Germany <br/>
(my husband is retired Air Force) and they closed the base hospital so I was <br/>
going to a German doctor.  I asked him what would happen if I went overdue <br/>
and he said he would have me come in every day after the due date to take <br/>
samples of amniotic fluid.  I asked what if I chose not to have that done and <br/>
he said he was the expert in that area.  I ended up going back to the U.S. <br/>
early because I was so uncomfortable with the situation.  I had thought that <br/>
Europe was more natural about births but Germany was the exception and had <br/>
much less of a patients&#39; rights movement than the U.S.  My landlady (and <br/>
friend) over there said they call them the gods in white coats.<br/>

<br/>
That would be about the equivalent of inducing labor, I bet, by sampling with <br/>
a big enough needle to break the sac.<br/>

I&#39;ve needed LaMaze breathing more AFTER I had kids and heard more doctor- and <br/>
