<div id="ygrps-yiv-555225385">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
I have a one child a 6 year old boy.  Before school started our home and<br/>
the neighbors where often the center on children coming to visit.  Once<br/>
school started no one comes over.  I wasn&#39;t impressed with most of the<br/>
children.  The next door neighbor girl who is 8 gets along well with my<br/>
son and both sets of parents like knowing where our children are, which<br/>
house and such. Another neighbor recently moved in two houses down that<br/>
has a 7 year old boy that we&#39;ve had over, which may be helpful.   Most<br/>
of the other parents just want to make sure their children are within a<br/>
two block radius.   Unfortunately when you get more than two children<br/>
particularly schooled children they  start to only want to play with<br/>
kids near their age or gender.  My son has friends of many ages and<br/>
genders.  My son doesn&#39;t always react in ways they&#39;d expect, he&#39;s<br/>
somewhat high energy and physical.  It&#39;s been helpful that he has a pet<br/>
turtle and this gives others something to relate to.<br/>
<br/>
Since school started and the other kids are gone it&#39;s been difficult and<br/>
he says he misses the kids.  I have a hard time not letting him wander<br/>
and he sometimes goes farther that I find acceptable.  It&#39;s fortunate<br/>
that we don&#39;t have much traffic on our streets.  I know he can handle<br/>
himself it&#39;s the other kids I worry about.  We do schedule daily outings<br/>
(this helps both of us).  We are doing weekly outings with another<br/>
homeschooling family, nature walks and such.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s tricky unschooling an only child at times.  Does anyone else have<br/>
an only child they are unschooling?<br/>
