<div id="ygrps-yiv-635998853">Hello! I&#39;m Sang and I joined... well, probably close to a month ago, now. I <br/>
waited and read for my two weeks, so here I am. I found when I started reading <br/>
that it was very hard to read and not post, so I decided to just leave them in <br/>
my mailbox to read later. I&#39;m up to April 3rd, now, and MAN, I wish I could <br/>
re-visit some posts! LOL<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much I will contribute to this board, as I consider our <br/>
&quot;type&quot; of homeschooling to be eclectic/unschooling and I don&#39;t quite &quot;mesh&quot; with a <br/>
couple of things I&#39;ve seen here. However, I do like a lot of the ideas I see <br/>
here, and I love the support I see, so I will hang around for a while until <br/>
you all get sick of me! LOL I feel I can learn good things here, and even though <br/>
I do get into debates on my other boards sometimes, I feel this is a good way <br/>
to learn things-a real give and take of ideas. Not that I&#39;m looking to stir <br/>
up trouble, mind you! ;~)<br/>
DH and I are raising a 5 year old son and have another child due in November. <br/>
We are in NE Ohio, DH loosly follows Native American faith, I am atheist, and <br/>
the kiddo is still learning what he thinks/believes. We follow a lot of AP <br/>
(attachment parenting) beliefs, but don&#39;t really feel we&#39;re truly &quot;crunchy&quot;-in <br/>
fact, we don&#39;t feel we fit into any catagory neatly! LOL We&#39;re pretty <br/>
eccentric, taking bits and pieces of things from anywhere and everywhere. Before DS was <br/>
born, I was horrified at the thought of anyone homeschooling a child, or <br/>
basically most of the parenting ways we now practice! LOL I&#39;m a major &quot;live and <br/>
learn&quot;-er. I morph easily when I&#39;ve done my research and find I like what I&#39;ve <br/>
learned. <br/>
This group really seems close-knit and the caring and support you show each <br/>
other is something I really like. Hope I don&#39;t step on too many toes in my <br/>
quest for knowledge, and my sharing of same. I do love to share! :~)<br/>
Oops-didn&#39;t mean for my intro to be so long! LOL Anyone feel free to email me <br/>
privately any time. Sanguinegirl83 @ aol.com.<br/>
