<div id="ygrps-yiv-871728530">I feel that I have been Pagan all my life and when I chose to follow Wicca as <br/>
the pathway to express my spirituality...I felt that it was a good framework <br/>
to break down destructive traditions that have created nueroses in our <br/>
society and my particular life...<br/>
<br/>
After examining unschooling and home schooling as well as how I TRULY felt <br/>
about public schools, government, institutionalization of anything and <br/>
everything, grading curves, how children should be brought up to become <br/>
effective and happy members of our society...and comparing my own particular <br/>
efforts to get back to the basics of what is important in life as well as <br/>
simplifying life...and...I can go on an on...I find that Unschooling is <br/>
another reflections of living my beliefs and spirituality.<br/>
<br/>
I am also a radical lesbian feminist (that is one of those labels that gets <br/>
tacked on from time to time)...and I just don&#39;t agree with how our society <br/>
socializes boys to become men...a few years ago I was at a loss of how to <br/>
counter that socialization...and now I hope it is not to &#39;late&#39; to <br/>
de-socialize and re-socialize...<br/>
<br/>
Now don&#39;t get me wrong...I do NOT hate men...in fact I love them just as much <br/>
as I love women...I thoroughly believe that it is a mother&#39;s responsibility <br/>
to bring up boys to become caring loving fathers and husbands and the <br/>
fundamentalist feminist stand that suppression of women is all men&#39;s fault <br/>
and patriarchal society&#39;s fault is quite mistaken.  Remember boys come first <br/>
from mothers and then from fathers...and I can go on and on about this as <br/>
well...<br/>
<br/>
I applaud SAHM&#39;s, I don&#39;t particularly think that I could be one...but I also <br/>
do not think that I can participate in marriage as defined by our society <br/>
today either...I have alot of pride for women who choose to stay home and <br/>
raise children...I feel that is as much a valid choice for women as the <br/>
choice of becoming a career woman or a working mom...or choosing not to have <br/>
children...or choosing to have as many children as God sees fit to grant one <br/>
family...I feel lucky that God has granted me the determination to make the <br/>
choices I have made...if that makes any sense...<br/>
<br/>
Okay...I will stop for now...<br/>
Thanks for listening...or is that seeing<br/>
