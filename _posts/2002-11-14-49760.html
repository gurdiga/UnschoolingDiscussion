<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975257556">When I was a kid my mom sent me to piano lessons. I did really well, <br/>
at first. Problem was I had a really good &quot;ear&quot; and I kind of cheated <br/>
by asking the teacher to play a piece first so I could hear it. Then <br/>
I pretended to read the music and just played what I remembered. He <br/>
eventually figured out what was going on. Darn! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my mom was telling her friend about this while my brother and <br/>
I played nearby. Suddenly my little brother (who was 5 or 6 at the <br/>
time) piped up and said &quot;I can play by ear too!&quot;, then walked over to <br/>
the piano and started banging on the keys with the side of his head!!!<br/>
<br/>
My brother is now 39 and we STILL tell this story whenever we get the <br/>
chance!  Beth</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960055591">Just read this and had to laugh!  <br/>
My youngest did the same thing, I mean about memorizing the music.  He got <br/>
away with it for 2 years, then got so advanced he had to start sight reading <br/>
and his game was up! LOL<br/>

more important (not sure if that is the right word, but it is the only<br/>
one coming to me right now) then reading music. Anyone can be taught to<br/>
read music. It is the ear to hear the pitches and the feeling that is<br/>
important.<br/>

Cute story!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289660948">I agree!!! I took piano for several years, but could never hear if what I was doing was right. Instead, I got used to the feel of where my fingers were on the keys.... kinda like how I can type without looking at the screen or my keyboard and just *know* when I type something wrong. I think it would be much easier to be able to hear if you&#39;re doing it right or wrong. My piano teacher used to fuss at me all the time because I couldn&#39;t hear my mistakes. <br/>

True.  But unless you tell someone to play something note for note, you lose <br/>
CONTROL!!<br/>
It did always seem to me in school that precision was stressed over <br/>
musicality, and mechanics over tone.<br/>
