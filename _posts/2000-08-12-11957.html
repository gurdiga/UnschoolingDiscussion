Try pouring cooking oil over it and let it sit for a while, then try to get <br/>
them apart.  If this does not work, try calling a nice department store <br/>
(Dillards maybe) and ask for their china department, then ask one of their <br/>
people.  Hope this helps!  :0)<br/>

Might work.  Seems like I heard that suggestion somewhere once upon a time...<br/>

are stuck this way is to tap the bottom of the glass firmly and voila! they <br/>
