<div id="ygrps-yiv-580066219">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I mostly lurk on this list, but I wanted to let you all know about a <br/>
conference for parents that is taking place in downtown Minneapolis <br/>
this summer.  July 16-18 are the dates and lots more info can be <br/>
found at the web-site www.mamagathering.org. There will be lots of <br/>
unschoolers there and we are hoping for more! Please check it out and <br/>
forward freely.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
mama gathering is back in 2004 to pack another mean mama punch of the <br/>
tastiest, sexiest, most defiant fun around. it&#39;s the only time of <br/>
year when you can kick it with your mama homegirls from all over the <br/>
globe, and this july it will touch down in minneapolis, minnesota, <br/>
where rest assured it is only cold in the winter. so bring your <br/>
shades, spaghetti straps, sandals, and something to show off those <br/>
fab stretch marks, cuz this is gonna be one hot scene.<br/>
<br/>
by day, get empowered at some of the smartest, edgiest workshops <br/>
around. from parenting topics to social justice issues to artist&#39;s <br/>
offerings, there&#39;s bound to be something for everymama. this time is <br/>
yours to learn, teach, network, and reinforce that the hand that <br/>
rawks the cradle truly does rule the world. and while you exchange <br/>
wisdom and experiences with your mama cohorts, turn your kiddos loose <br/>
to take part in supervised kid activities and workshops, broken down <br/>
by age for the best fit available. all workshops and kidshops will be <br/>
held at the quality inn hotel in downtown minneapolis, where a block <br/>
of rooms will be mama gathering&#39;s home base.<br/>
<br/>
by night, venture out into the city for some luscious night life. <br/>
both friday and saturday evenings will feature off site shindigs <br/>
accessable by shuttle. whether you wanna kick back or kick it up a <br/>
notch, the gathering&#39;s unique, kid-approved venues, gourmet grub and <br/>
stage shows will inspire you to mix it up and boogie down. and where <br/>
you take it from there...well, that&#39;s entirely up to you.<br/>
<br/>
so, come one, come all to the biggest, baddest, most subversive <br/>
parenting conference and party of the year! whether you&#39;re pierced or <br/>
pinstriped, geeky or glam, a teenage mom or mom of teenagers, whether <br/>
you drive a beemer, drive a junker, or drive yourself nuts trying to <br/>
get your stroller on the bus, whether you breastfed, formula fed, or <br/>
were so sleep deprived you don&#39;t remember, this is your gathering, <br/>
mama.<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ll see you there.</div>
