<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289998027">Hi me again<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to my best friend tonight about this, and we both had a <br/>
chuckle about &quot;they will learn whatever math they need as they need <br/>
it&quot; (sorry, that IS going to be the toughest *gasp* Don&#39;t do Math? <br/>
*gasp*) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I told her about my teenage daughter&#39;s journey into English <br/>
History via Tolkien, and she said &quot;because it interested her&quot; and I <br/>
said &quot;That&#39;s RIGHT! these unschoolers say that&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed <br/>
to do, let the kids follow what they are interested in...&quot; and she <br/>
was getting it. And I asked her what her kids shine in, is it the <br/>
fill in the blanks, lists of spelling words, pages of math problems, <br/>
or do they shine in areas where they&#39;ve achieved a passion by going <br/>
after something they love to do? (She has always relied heavily on<br/>
4-H, with a traditional curriculum for academics, and her kids are <br/>
truly WONDERS.)<br/>
<br/>
She agreed there, too...where her kids have excelled the most has <br/>
been in areas where they&#39;ve taken off of their own volition and gone <br/>
for it, for fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a lot of value in this concept. <br/>
<br/>
wow<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, Heidi</div>

&lt;&lt; I think there&#39;s a lot of value in this concept.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to run live unschooling chats, in a scheduled chatroom, two hours a <br/>
week, on AOL.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we would get people who would come in figuring they could easily <br/>
just show us the total error of our ways.<br/>
<br/>
A man came in once (which was rare by itself) and asked this question:<br/>
<br/>
*Are you willing to risk your children&#39;s future on your &quot;theories&quot;?*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Everyone does.  Those whose theory is that schools are best for their kids <br/>
are taking the same kind of risk only they will blame someone else if it <br/>
doens&#39;t work out.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *Are you willing to risk your children&#39;s future on your &quot;theories&quot;?*<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, think about this. The man was probably thinking of the success <br/>
(or, I could say &quot;success&quot;) of traditional teaching paradigms <br/>
throughout the history of Western Civilization. People who were <br/>
tightly structured, learning Latin, Greek, Calculus, Philosophy, <br/>
through tutelage AT HOME with structured, scheduled, guided learning  <br/>
through their childhoods (the Founding Fathers, e.g,) grew into men <br/>
who completely changed the history of the world. The traditional <br/>
methods have been used to elevate the average literacy levels in this <br/>
country, as someone pointed out somewhere else, so that America has  <br/>
had by far the highest literacy rate in the world. <br/>
<br/>
To the man who said that, this paradigm looked MIGHTY successful, <br/>
don&#39;t you think? Trusting his children to such a (proven) method must <br/>
have seemed better to the guy than just letting the kids explore <br/>
without a lot of interference. <br/>
<br/>
Now! can I guess the unschoolers&#39; reply? Which I don&#39;t disagree with, <br/>
mind you. &quot;The men who became America&#39;s Founders, were highly <br/>
educated, true, but they are only a small minority of the population. <br/>
And who is to say that the Founders weren&#39;t following their own <br/>
interests, too, and that those interests just happened to bring them <br/>
to the place they arrived at as men? Other people in the populatin at <br/>
that time were NOT movers and shakers, but people have followed their <br/>
own interests for eons, going into vocations that they were good at <br/>
because they explored everything around them...&quot; etc. I could also <br/>
say something about how the education of the 17th century was apples <br/>
compared to the (rotten) oranges that today&#39;s Government System <br/>
offers. <br/>
<br/>
how&#39;d I do? Is that an unschoolers&#39; reply? LOL<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is one.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The goals&quot; of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Children are growing up.  Mine are particularly important to me. &lt;LOL&gt;<br/>
They WILL grow up and they WILL learn (unless they die or have a debilitating <br/>
brain injury).<br/>
<br/>
SO... I would like to provide a way for them to avoid school if they don&#39;t <br/>
want to go to school.  Mine have had the option and have chosen to stay home.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to provide this option until they&#39;re past the state&#39;s compulsory <br/>
attendance age.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s a goal of my parenting, not the goal of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I trust that if they have a life full of the opportunity to see, hear, taste, <br/>
smell, touch, discuss and ponder interesting things that their learning will <br/>
be constant, and their own knowledge will build and intertwine and grow <br/>
inside them where I can&#39;t see, and they will be more and more confident and <br/>
interesting as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
So far so good.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read more granulated ideas, I have lots of things linked from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
but there&#39;s not a list of &quot;the goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And darn it, there&#39;s not even going to be an opportunity to take the special <br/>
unschooling SAT test to prove I know it really well!!!  (If I could have <br/>
[morally and legally] made a living taking standardized tests, I&#39;d be rich!)<br/>

school?&quot;...but I think it was about twins Marilla and Anne had <br/>
adopted. Starting their educations at age 5 was a German concept <br/>
(Kinder-garten=Child&#39;s Garden) that became popular before the Great <br/>
Depression. I have a friend who goes by the following guideline: when <br/>
a child has lost his first two front teeth, and can reach his arm <br/>
over the top of his head to touch the lobe of the opposite ear, start <br/>
teaching him. This is something I&#39;ve tried to do around here, all <br/>
along: let the little kids PLAY and nothing else. Well, chores and <br/>
obedience to their parents and we have a Bible time every day.<br/>

What are *your* goals?<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t goals of unschooling. (Though I may have worded it that way.)<br/>
But there are goals that unschooling can help us achieve. Living life<br/>
joyfully. Self-discovery and self-fulfillment. Pursuing dreams. Providing an<br/>
atmosphere for natural learning. And so on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378447721">This is an interesting thread...  I have always admired Abraham Lincoln, who <br/>
came from a  poor backwoods family, had the benefit of very little formal <br/>
schooling in his early years, yet &quot;schooled&quot; himself (with little <br/>
encouragement from his father, no less!) and discovered a passion (the law) <br/>
that fired his imagination and spurred him on to his place in history.<br/>
<br/>
I use this as inspiration in unschooling my own son.  I constantly encourage <br/>
him to experiement with many different subjects and projects and ideas, with <br/>
the hope that he will eventually find his own &quot;passion&quot; that will light the <br/>
fire in his heart and soul for his own life&#39;s work.<br/>
At the moment, he has informed me that he &quot;hates&quot; reading, math, history and <br/>
writing.  I asked him what he does like, and he replies &quot;movies!&quot;  I really <br/>
like movies!<br/>
   This weekend, we are going to explore various occupations related to the <br/>
movie industry.  I suggessted to him that he could start a school publication <br/>
where he critiques the current movie offerings in our town each week.  He lit <br/>
on that idea right away, and spend several hours reading other critics&#39; <br/>
reviews, synopsises, and then writing his own take on the movies he&#39;s seen so <br/>
far.<br/>
<br/>
So, without struggle, he enjoyed some reading, some writing, some history <br/>
(background on the movies subject), and math while figuring the gross profits <br/>
of the various studios, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Much better than battles with worksheets and textbooks!<br/>

There are movies which deal in matters which would help him understand or <br/>

thought nineteen ways, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a DVD player, you probably already know that the &quot;tradition&quot; with <br/>
DVDs is coming to be that they have a voice-over track option where someone <br/>
who worked on the movie (sometimes many someones) will tell you all KINDS of <br/>
cool stuff about when it was being made.   We&#39;ve really enjoyed the extras on <br/>
DVDs.  It&#39;s amazing.  Like film school without having to buy any expensive <br/>
textbooks or write any papers, without having to listen to lectures or watch <br/>
any foreign movies you have no interest in whatsoever. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

We watched part of Searching for Bobby Fisher last weekend. Only part, cos the video from the store was of really poor quality - made viewing difficult. But my 7 yo was so inspired by what we saw - the boy in the film is, I guess, a chess prodigy. My son had the chess set out, asking anyone to play games, the chess set is still out and people are playing chess at various times...Leonie W. <br/>
