<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441617465">Re: The Sims<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always wondered if this was worth buying.<br/>
Guess maybe it is.<br/>
What is the best one to start with?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have a question about the Sims... my daughter (age 11) has been <br/>
&gt; into Roller Coaster Tycoon, and her cousin (age 13) said she should <br/>
&gt; try the Sims because it&#39;s great and it&#39;s kind of the same premise.  <br/>
&gt; So I finally bought it a couple weeks ago and brought it home, only <br/>
&gt; to discover it had a rating of &quot;T&quot; for Teen, which the box says is <br/>
&gt; rated that for animated sexual situations.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went onto a computer software review site to find out why the <br/>
&gt; rating, and they said basically if you flirt a lot it could lead to <br/>
&gt; such things, but if you stay away from flirting, then it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; for <br/>
&gt; younger kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you &quot;Sims Experts&quot; agree?  Did you find anything objectionable in <br/>
&gt; the software?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, it&#39;s absolutely worth buying. Lots of fun, problem solving...oh, <br/>
forget the list of the educational value...there&#39;s probably plenty, but it&#39;s <br/>
just lots of fun.<br/>
<br/>
You have to buy The Sims first, then you can add expansion packs. You can <br/>
also download stuff from the internet.<br/>
<br/>
It is rated Teen. The first pack mostly involves people kissing, and when <br/>
they REALLY like each other they grab each other&#39;s butts.  If you get the <br/>
Living Large expansion pack, it includes a &quot;Love Bed,&quot; where there&#39;s an <br/>
option to &quot;Play in bed.&quot; The involves the Sims getting naked (which is <br/>
blurred out...the Sims are not graphic kinda folks), going under the covers <br/>
completely and lumps jiggling around. There are giggling sounds.  The next <br/>
expansion pack, House Party, has a cake that either a male or female dancer <br/>
jumps out of and dances sort of suggestively.<br/>
<br/>
My almost 12 year old son and his friend recently spent an entire day having <br/>
one character gather many &quot;lovers,&quot; male and female, and &quot;making out&quot; with <br/>
them. Some they &quot;played in bed&quot; with. Every time they&#39;d get another &quot;lover&quot; <br/>
they&#39;d gleefully run in and tell me about it. These are two YOUNG twelve year <br/>
olds--first time really expressing any interest in sexuality like this (other <br/>
than those conversations wih their respective parents.)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have any problem with it because I know what kind of values both <br/>
boys have (and Friend&#39;s parents are VERY good friends of mine...I might have <br/>
discouraged this if it had been another friend). You may have different <br/>
feelings about it. <br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I find the Sims fine on his stuff. Adults will only sleep <br/>
(Sleep, not other stuff) with other adults who are &quot;friends.&quot; (Based on <br/>
relationship score). They&#39;ll only &quot;&quot;Play in bed&quot; with adults they &quot;love.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The other potential concern would be &quot;animated violence.&quot; Sims who hate each <br/>
other sometimes slap or fight. However, it&#39;s programmed in that men do not <br/>
hit or fight women, and  NO ONE hits or fights kids.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much for the detailed information... I decided to let my 11 <br/>
year old try it, with the cautions you mentioned, and the warning not <br/>
to spend too much time on those pursuits, but generally to trust her <br/>
judgement and good sense.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

She is a mysterious woman.<br/>
