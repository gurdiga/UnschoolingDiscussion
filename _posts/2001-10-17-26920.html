Perspectives<br/>
<br/>
In August I decided that the theme of the Septemeber issue of this<br/>
newsletter would be &quot;perspectives&quot;. Life has thrown me a few curve<br/>
balls this year, my father has become bedridden, a dear friend has entered<br/>
the last phase of living with liver cancer, and three of my children all<br/>
became<br/>
fluent readers at the same time. Even in my own reading I was finding<br/>
different perspectives of old issues, leaving me to rethink things I<br/>
already thought I knew.<br/>
<br/>
Then those ill-fated planes flew into the World Trade Center and forever<br/>
changed our lives, the lives of our children, and their children&#39;s<br/>
children. I couldn&#39;t find a perspective, much less write with one, as life<br/>
was now an ever-changing kaleidoscope of images, feelings and worries.<br/>
<br/>
During the last month I felt twinges of envy for our curriculum using<br/>
brothers and sisters. The main battle cry of unschooling is that we use<br/>
*real life* as the vehicle for our families learning. Real life was no<br/>
longer what I wanted to offer my children. I wanted to offer them the safe<br/>
haven of badly written textbooks. Texts so devoid of meaning that their real<br/>
questions would be truncated before they could even think of them. I don&#39;t<br/>
have very many answers to the questions that now face us. How refreshing it<br/>
would be to be able to say, this is the *right* answer to the question at<br/>
the end of the chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my children, used to living authentic lives, had no interest in<br/>
changing course now. They still wanted their very real lives. I suspect no<br/>
one will be surprised when I say they led me to my own safe haven. They<br/>
asked questions, offered opinions and they keep tabs on how the work in NY<br/>
is progressing, but by and large they are living their normal lives,<br/>
reading, playing computer games, going places and of course they continue to<br/>
eat me out of house and home.<br/>
<br/>
I watch them as they absorb the actions of the world around them, and then<br/>
continue on with the job at hand, which is the simple living of their own<br/>
lives. My world is not so simple, and since their father is an Army<br/>
Reservist, it&#39;s possible that their world won&#39;t stay simple forever, but for<br/>
now we are breathing deeply and moving ahead. By looking with the<br/>
perspective of my children, I am able to one again gain a bit of<br/>
perspective, at least enough to bring you this month&#39;s unschooling<br/>
newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
In this issue you&#39;ll find websites and other resources that challenge our<br/>
perspectives, from online kaleidoscopes to the very raw drawings of Afghani<br/>
children.<br/>

Former Hostages File Suit<br/>

<br/>
Strange happenings in this war on terrorism --<br/>
<br/>
The former hostages are suing Iran for monetary damages after their 444-day<br/>
captivity, which followed the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy in the<br/>
capital city of Tehran. They say a law passed in 1996 allows Americans to<br/>
sue in civil court countries on the State Department&#39;s list of state<br/>
sponsors of terrorism.<br/>
<br/>
The Justice Department said this week that the 1996 law does not trump the<br/>
accord that freed the hostages in the first place.<br/>

RAWA, Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan<br/>
www.rawa.org<br/>
<br/>
RAWA has been in existence since 1977. Read that again. 1977 means that<br/>
Afghani women have been fighting fundamentalism for 32 years. I give you the<br/>
main url in hopes that you will have your perspectives challenged but be<br/>
warned this site contains graphic and horrific information. The pages that<br/>
were the most compelling to me, as an unschooler, were the drawings by the<br/>
children. It gives our phase &quot;learning from life&quot; a whole new twist. For<br/>
their pictures visit - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://rawa.fancymarketing.net/kid-pic.htm">http://rawa.fancymarketing.net/kid-pic.htm</a><br/>

<br/>
You know, I always thought of kaleidoscopes as a child&#39;s fantasy toy. Never<br/>
did I realize the mathematics hidden within those mesmerizing pictures. This<br/>
site takes you to some high class &#39;scopes like these --<br/>
<br/>
Euclidean plane kaleidoscopes<br/>
Spherical kaleidoscopes<br/>
Hyperbolic kaleidoscopes<br/>

Can you guess who would put out an online journal aptly named The<br/>
Perspective? Come on guess.<br/>
<br/>
Nope.<br/>
<br/>
The Perspective - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theperspective.org/">http://www.theperspective.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
The Liberian Democratic Future (LDF) is a group of Liberians from different<br/>
ethnic backgrounds, genders, religious beliefs and political persuasions who<br/>
are dedicated to pluralistic, democratic Liberia. The Liberian Democratic<br/>
Future has great passion for democracy, peace with justice and equal<br/>
opportunity for all Liberians, which are not only necessary but in deed<br/>
critically imperative if we are to transcend the wounds and deep division of<br/>
our civil conflict. In recognition of this national need, LDF has decided to<br/>
launch a medium of dialogue - THE PERSPECTIVE.<br/>
<br/>
As a unique upscale newsmagazine, The Perspective is significantly different<br/>
from other Liberian publications. Rather than dance around the problems, The<br/>
Perspective will confront the issues head on by concentrating on telling the<br/>
truth, exposing the root causes, underlining contributing factors and<br/>
identifying the class divisions which are the undercurrent of the various<br/>
problems in Liberia<br/>
<br/>
Reading through this site makes our own Revolutionary period seem quaint and<br/>
almost naive.<br/>

drawing in our theme of perspective. Hope you enjoy the sites below!<br/>

What comes to mind when you think of 3-D glasses, holograms, and virtual<br/>
images? Ordinary objects coming alive? Looking at things in new, exciting<br/>
ways? Just as these modern-day 3-D innovations have caused a sensation in<br/>
our time, the use of perspective in art caused a visual/sensual response in<br/>
the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://library.thinkquest.org/3257/">http://library.thinkquest.org/3257/</a><br/>

Healing and Dying<br/>
<br/>
Below are websites with very different perspectives on healing and dying. As<br/>
I watch my father deal with becoming bedridden and what is the last stage of<br/>
his life, I find myself longing for a way to both hold on and to let go all<br/>
within the same moment. It&#39;s hard and frustrating work, hampered by the fact<br/>
that we only have a superficial relationship. During this time I also hold<br/>
in contrast of my friend living the last stages of liver cancer. Her<br/>
strength and joy while facing all that she must leaves me with the same<br/>
sense of awe I have when watching a Harvest Moon rise into the night&#39;s sky.<br/>
How could something be so big and so beautiful and still be so untouchable?<br/>

The Art of Healing: A Tibetan Buddhist Perspective<br/>
by Bonnie Pasqualoni<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/tibetan-art-of-healing.htm">http://www.dharma-haven.org/tibetan/tibetan-art-of-healing.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
I beseech you, Medicine Guru,<br/>
whose sky-colored holy body of lapis lazuli<br/>
Signifies omniscient wisdom<br/>
and compassion as vast as limitless space,<br/>
please grant me your blessings.<br/>
<br/>
Tibetans use an ancient form of medicine known as Gso-wa Rig-pa or &quot;The<br/>
Knowledge of Healing&quot; whose origins are believed to be based on the<br/>
teachings of the historical Buddha. Tibetan medicine is held in high esteem<br/>
in Tibet and central Asia.<br/>
<br/>
In the Tibetan medical tradition, the concept of well-being takes into<br/>
account the full dynamics of mind, body and spirit to achieve an effective<br/>
and comprehensive healing strategy. It is immersed in Buddhist tradition,<br/>
which differs from non-Buddhist medicine in that it utilizes three types of<br/>
therapeutic intervention: medicinal entities, the power of mantra (a<br/>
creative, repetitive sound) and the power of meditative stabilization<br/>
(Donden, p. 215). In doing so, the Tibetan healing traditions transport us<br/>
into a strange world of interconnectedness between macrocosmic principles<br/>
and their microcosmic manifestations; harmony and balance between the cosmic<br/>
macrocosm and the human microcosm is believed to be essential for health and<br/>
well-being. This is true not only in the sense that balance is required for<br/>
health, but also in the somewhat deeper sense that such balance is the<br/>
essence of health; balance among the physical, psychological and spiritual<br/>
elements of human existence is health.<br/>

Share the Care<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/reviews/coping/books/share.html">http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/reviews/coping/books/share.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Share the Care was born when a group of women, including the authors, got<br/>
together to try to help a friend who had been suffering with cancer. Each<br/>
author approached the situation from very different perspectives based on<br/>
their unique situations and experiences. Sheila describes herself as an<br/>
&quot;burnt-out caregiver.&quot; As one of the few people that their friend had<br/>
already been relying heavily upon as her cancer progressed and she became<br/>
increasingly debilitated, she now was struggling as she attempted to balance<br/>
the new caregiver demands being placed on her by her ailing mother. She was<br/>
skeptical of the group, their willingness and ability to meet the increasing<br/>
demands over a sustained period of time.<br/>
<br/>
Despite each author&#39;s concerns, the group was formed, and for a period of<br/>
three and one half years, provided almost total care to their friend until<br/>
her death.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the authors have compiled not only the story of this group and their<br/>
experiences, but have turned the trials, tribulations, and the wisdom gained<br/>
into a practical guidebook for caregivers of seriously ill persons. Share<br/>
the Care gives the reader a step by step directions for creating and<br/>
sustaining an &quot;alternate family&quot; to share the practical and emotional<br/>
responsibilities of caregiving<br/>

Jewish Healing Perspectives<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I woke up and said, &quot;Dang! I&#39;m getting old, and ugly, and my<br/>
body hurts more than it used to!&quot; Consequently, I began to search through<br/>
the literature and the traditions of Judaism to see what my ancestors had<br/>
written about healing. I quickly realized that more has been said throughout<br/>
Judaism&#39;s long history than one individual could ever hope to reclaim.<br/>
Nevertheless, I did find both general principles and specific advice and<br/>
also bits of wisdom that seemed to speak directly to what I needed to know<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Transforming the World - by William Martin<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The world inists on achievement and progress<br/>
and it is full of enmity and strife.<br/>
Can you see all this and still help your children<br/>
maintain their trust and hope and peace?<br/>
Can you accept the world as it is,<br/>
yet live according to a different standard?<br/>
Can you let your children see<br/>
a way of living<br/>
that transforms,<br/>
heals<br/>
nurtures,<br/>
and loves?<br/>
<br/>
If you complain about politics<br/>
and gripe about taxes,<br/>
and stew about the sorry state of things<br/>
your children will learn to whine instead of laugh.<br/>
If you can see in every moment<br/>
a chance to live,<br/>
to accept,<br/>
and to appreciate,<br/>
your children will transform the world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, may it be so!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s it for MidOctober. See you next month!<br/>
