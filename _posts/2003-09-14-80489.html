<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777763951">&quot;And having the distance helps them to see more clearly. It<br/>
could be another room in the house, outside or at a park, just a walk away<br/>
from the group. I do it in my own home around our family and pass that same<br/>
respect on when we&#39;re out with others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same here. I think it&#39;s not only respectful of other folks, to remove the distressed child, it&#39;s also more respectful of the child so they can continue the melt down in private.<br/>
And allowing verbal abuse to take place is not an acceptable form of tantrum in my home. Melt downs happen, but I respect myself too much to allow someone to direct all their rage at me. It is possible, I have to believe, to help an intense person direct their rage in healthier ways.<br/>
