<br/>
Procovery Certificate of Empowerment<br/>
<br/>
By: Kathleen Crowley*<br/>
* Adapted with gratitude from “Certificate of Empowerment” by Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
As bearer of this certificate you are no longer required to depend on the <br/>
advice of experts. You may step back and view the entire world—not just your <br/>
home, neighborhood or town, but the whole Earth—as a procovery-oriented <br/>
learning experience, a laboratory containing medicines, therapies, <br/>
strategies, sources of support, ways to heal and to grow, and ideas without <br/>
end. Although collections of these treasures have been located in hospitals <br/>
and clinics for your convenience, they are to be found in prayer, bubble <br/>
baths, animals, sunsets, snowfall, romance, music, art, mathematics, physics, <br/>
engineering, foods, and everywhere else, too. <br/>
<br/>
This authorizes you to experiment; to make mistakes; to try new things and to <br/>
“backslide”; to passionately embrace that which energizes, inspires and <br/>
heals you, no matter how “outside” of the medical model it may be; and to <br/>
accept that you are the world’s greatest authority on you. <br/>
<br/>
You are entitled to build and create new dreams, and view them as a force as <br/>
powerful as medicine. <br/>
<br/>
This authorizes you to trust that procovery is possible for all individuals; <br/>
that healing a life can heal an illness; that there are infinite ways to in<br/>
itiate and promote healing no matter how grave the illness and no matter how <br/>
serious the limitations of systems and symptoms; and that hope is a life <br/>
force in and of itself.  To trust that there are as many paths to wellness as <br/>
there are to illness and that supporting individual paths to procovery will <br/>
ultimately result in mass and lasting change not only in individuals but also <br/>
in health care systems. <br/>
<br/>
You have leave to Just Start Anywhere. Today. <br/>
<br/>
Each person who reads and understands this is authorized to extend these <br/>
privileges to others, by reproducing and distributing this certificate or by <br/>
creating another of his/her own design. Those who don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>
obtain approval in order to experiment, to move toward procovery, to think, <br/>
or to do things they&#39;ve never seen others do are exempt, as they didn&#39;t need <br/>
permission in the first place. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I found it looking for the other one.<br/>
I don&#39;t even know what procovery IS! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-179735738">Kathleen is a beautiful, lovely person I ran into on an unschooling board (on AOL,<br/>
maybe) a year or so ago. Her &quot;procovery&quot; is from a book she wrote that apparently<br/>
encourages people to take control of their own lives and the treatment of their<br/>
(perhaps incurable) chronic diseases or problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630794123">I like this part you are no longer required to depend on the advice of<br/>
experts.&quot;   Far too many folks wait for &quot;permission&quot; from the &quot;experts&quot;<br/>
before they sail forth.<br/>
