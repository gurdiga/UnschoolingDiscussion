<div id="ygrps-yiv-253724419">Dear fellow unschooler members, I have learned so much being a member of<br/>
this unschooling group this year.  Now, I need your help.  I am recruiting<br/>
independent account managers for Schoolpop.  The ideal account manager is an<br/>
organized stay-at-home mom or former teacher who is involved with local<br/>
schools, wants work out of their home, set their own hours and make good<br/>
money.  I thought you might know of someone in your area who would be just<br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
Schoolpop is going to be carrying Over and Above Kids Art of Learning<br/>
Program.  Schoolpop offers a hassle-free program for PTAs to raise money by<br/>
selling name-brand educational products such as Leap Frog below retail price<br/>
and with no inventory processing. I am on the lookout for community leaders<br/>
to introduce and represent Schoolpop&#39;s offerings to schools and PTAs. An<br/>
independent account manager would set his/her own hours, earn money every<br/>
sale made by the participating schools, receive an exclusive territory with<br/>
no upfront costs and help make a difference in the community.   If you know<br/>
of anyone who would be an ideal independent account manager, have them check<br/>
out www.shop.schoolpop.com and then contact ME DIRECTLY at 252 361 5437 or<br/>
