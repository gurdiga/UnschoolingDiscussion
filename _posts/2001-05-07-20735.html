&lt;&lt;  So at this point it becomes a matter of opinion and<br/>
 of where each person draws their line, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to<br/>
 argue that there aren&#39;t lines to be drawn at all. It is possible to<br/>
 understand that some folks feel that a small amount of violence is not<br/>
 harmful to their kids. It is also possible to understand that others feel<br/>
 quite strongly that any amount of violence is too much for any child.<br/>

trying to say.  It is not intolerance to have strong convictions about <br/>
something being good or wrong and I think most people have these convictions <br/>
in some form.<br/>
