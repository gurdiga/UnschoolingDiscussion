&lt;&lt; .With closer family ( older kids? spouse?) I would feel free to journal <br/>
some of our days and/or moments (I do this anyway) and show it to them as an <br/>
example of  how well unschooling is working...Leonie W.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just had an idea!! Maybe keep a journal on a webpage, and if relatives are <br/>
nosy, give them the URL.  Let that be the best of the activities and news of <br/>
your kids, AND you could put in good posts and links from online unschooling <br/>
discussions, and if they REALLY care, they can go there and read the updates.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413534348">I also think this is a great idea and my son would really enjoy it.  My problem is I have no idea how to go about doing it?!  Does anyone have some suggestions of how I would start it up?  Thanks Kelli<br/>
