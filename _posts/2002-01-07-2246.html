<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904609830">The only one that has bothered me so far was turning 19.  Isn&#39;t that weird?<br/>
But I was so aware of moving into adulthood, I truly mourned the loss of my<br/>
adolescence.  I had it figured that you had a lot of fun growing up, got<br/>
married, had some kids, hung around for awhile and died.  Didn&#39;t seem like<br/>
much to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
I have always had a very, very strong sense of my mortality.  I remember<br/>
thinking even as a kid &quot;OK, I have used up such and such fraction of my<br/>
life.&quot;  Helps keep me very much living in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who now has trouble recalling how old she is unless she does the<br/>
math, but thinks 38 is about right  :)</div>
