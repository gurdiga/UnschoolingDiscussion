<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717287914">We&#39;ve tried a number of things and interestingly, all three kids have asked<br/>
for (and get) a different system.  10yo ds wants to &quot;earn&quot; his money.  He<br/>
sort of gets about $5 /week automatically because he takes care of the dog<br/>
regularly and does &quot;morning things&quot; which basically means take care of<br/>
yourself without being reminded so I don&#39;t have to wory about it when it&#39;s<br/>
time to go somewhere.  After that, if he wants more money he can do chores<br/>
or garden or any number of other things that help the family.  He typically<br/>
finds something he wants to buy and then does extra work until he has enough<br/>
money for it.<br/>
  8yo dd wants a steady amount each week. She gets $7 and doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
earn it by doing specific things.  She helps out about the same as he does,<br/>
but it isn&#39;t linked to a dollar amount.  3yo dd just wants to be able to<br/>
spend money on a toy when we go to the store and sometimes she says &quot;can I<br/>
get some money if I help you clean?&quot;  I give it to her but I still buy her<br/>
what she wants usually.  It adds up to about $5 to $10/week but I don&#39;t keep<br/>
track so much with her.    All the kids keep their money in the bank of Mom<br/>
and withdraw when they want.  Usually if we are going to an amusement park<br/>
or farmers market or something like that they will ask for the cash before<br/>
hand so they have more autonomy when they want to buy something.  The only<br/>
element missing at this point is the long-term savings.  We have some (not a<br/>
lot) of money in IRAs for them but they don&#39;t put any away themselves.<br/>
