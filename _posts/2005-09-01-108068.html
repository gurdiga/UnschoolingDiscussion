On August 23, 2005, ZoloWear voluntarily recalled 177 slings sold <br/>
between<br/>
May and August 2005 due to a manufacturing error. ZoloWear slings <br/>
should<br/>
have three rows of stitching securing the webbing and fabric together. <br/>
Some<br/>
of the slings in the recall lots have short webbing, so only one row of<br/>
stitching holds the webbing in place. This stitching can break, posing <br/>
a<br/>
fall hazard to young children.</div>
