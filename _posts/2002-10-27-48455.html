Yes.  It&#39;s just hard to run much of a Children&#39;s Liberation movement<br/>
without pissing off their parents.<br/>

&gt; a discussion once in which one mom said she felt strongly that she only<br/>
&gt; wanted her children to socialize with Christian families&#39; children.   And<br/>
&gt; another mom came on not long after and said being Christian wasn&#39;t enough for<br/>
&gt; her.  She wanted to know what KIND of Christians they were.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So many people here have commented that it&#39;s nice to have us as neighbors,<br/>
and they&#39;re sorry we&#39;re moving, because it&#39;s been &quot;such a blessing to have<br/>
good Christian neighbors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever cared if I had good Christian neighbors or good Muslim<br/>
or Pagan or atheist or whatever neighbors, I just want GOOD neighbors.  To<br/>
heck with what they believe!!!!<br/>

Sorry it&#39;s so crappy there for you Shyrley. I&#39;m a keep to myself kind of <br/>
person so neighbors don&#39;t sway me one way or another. Although I do love my <br/>
neighborhood. Upper middle class but not snobby at all. Very diverse just on <br/>
my street alone. I like that. I do have 3-4 women here though that are <br/>
rather nosey. I don&#39;t like that. There have already been stories around as <br/>
to why no one sees my kids playing in the streets. And I can&#39;t believe your <br/>
neighbor had the balls to ask you how you can afford to live where you do. I <br/>
would have given him some kind of smart ass answer. Live and learn huh? <br/>
Hopefully your 2 years will go quick!!!<br/>
