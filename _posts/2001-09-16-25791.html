<br/>
Eighth grade was truly more advanced then in some ways than 8th grade is now, <br/>
but on the other hand there were things they didn&#39;t touch then or have any <br/>
concept of that 8th graders now in school have.<br/>
<br/>
Many things in the world are covered by the &quot;six of one, half a dozen of the <br/>
other&quot; rule.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, modern American schools have problems.<br/>
<br/>
And in all cases, critical thinking and checking sources is always, always a <br/>
good thing.  If someone tells you something, check it out yourself.  <br/>
Sometimes people just make a mistake for being stressed or in a hurry (as I&#39;m <br/>
sure Dr. Chopra did about the &quot;2000 years&quot; thing), and then there are other <br/>
people who want quick easy answers and don&#39;t care much about the truthful <br/>
reality behind what they&#39;re saying.<br/>

not.  But the fact is the supposed expose of the test as an &quot;urban legend&quot;<br/>
turns out to be as dubious as the test itself!  &quot;Snopes&quot; was unable to track<br/>
the &quot;legend&quot; to its fictitious source, nor come up with any evidence that it<br/>
was in fact falsified. So he relies on deductive reasoning, based on a series<br/>

Better evidence than those who claimed it was an 8th grade test had.<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t want to go to the site, the copy of the original (the <br/>
library doesn&#39;t have an original) says &quot;applicant,&quot; doesn&#39;t say student, <br/>
doesn&#39;t say 8th grade.  It could be an application to get into college, or <br/>
for a job, or to teach.  It doesn&#39;t say.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the library is unable to produce their copy, or if there are no extant <br/>
copies found of something someone allegedly transcribed, then it is <br/>
reasonable to assume someone made up at least part of the info which is being <br/>
sent out as whole truth.<br/>
<br/>
Such tests would be a matter of public record, with thousands of copies, not <br/>
all in one place.<br/>
<br/>
People will not learn as much from a black and white sketch of something as <br/>
they will from a 3-D model, or from touching and seeing the real thing.<br/>
<br/>
To cling to something from one piece of evidence (and electronic copy, not <br/>
even real, period paper copy) isn&#39;t sufficient for knowing or understanding.<br/>
<br/>
There are different levels of belief, and I think it&#39;s important for <br/>
unschoolers to go for multi-faceted, multi-dimensional versions of ANYTHING <br/>
they want to believe or pass on to their children.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier someone recommended *a* history series.  If an unschooled child is <br/>
interested in any period of history or any incident, I think they parents <br/>
should scout around for at least five or six pieces of input--movies, videos, <br/>
historical reports (first-hand, eye-witness reports), photos or archeological <br/>
evidence--and never ever think that reading one version of something which is <br/>
the author&#39;s impression should be enough to begin to &quot;know.&quot;  It can spark an <br/>
interest, but can&#39;t constitute a body of knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps online in some history of testing areas there are documented 8th <br/>
grade tests from different states.  Instead of defending something <br/>
questionable, it would be more useful to do the research to find something <br/>
more easily defended, if the material is of interest to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131338976">Good heavens there is so much faulty logic, incorrect information and <br/>
leaps from what was actually said/done to what is being &quot;corrected.&quot;  <br/>
I can now understand more fully why there are so many arguments and <br/>
misunderstandings on this list.  A poster, an adult, responded to a <br/>
post I made with a request for suggestions.  The request was for <br/>
something for this adult to read, a request for suggestions.  Another <br/>
poster made a couple of suggestions.  That would appear to come under <br/>
the description this list being a place to share information.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Smokey Valley Genealogical Society, they, not the <br/>
library have the original document.  Unless one can prove otherwise, <br/>
which deductive reasoning, based on faulty syllogisms does not do, <br/>
then there is no better evidence.  Are you sure you went to their <br/>
site?  The site specifically states &quot;<br/>
<br/>
EXAMINATION GRADUATION QUESTIONS <br/>
OF SALINE COUNTY, KANSAS <br/>
April 13, 1895 <br/>
J.W. Armstrong, County Superintendent.<br/>
<br/>
That certainly doesn&#39;t equate to there being a question of it being <br/>
an application for anything.  At that point in time at that <br/>
particular school district you graduated in the 8th grade, therefore <br/>
it doesn&#39;t need to say 8th grade if it is &quot;the&quot; graduation exam.  <br/>
<br/>
Also the parameters of conduct for school districts of this century  <br/>
are being applied to a school district in another period in time.  <br/>
Many, many documents have been lost or were never saved.  There are a <br/>
few genealogists on this list you can clarify for you just how many <br/>
records and documents have been lost or were never saved.  Were all <br/>
those documents still available it would make a much easier job for <br/>
those that are tracing their ancestors.  Unfortunately they are not.<br/>
<br/>
I see no suggestions from this post.  I only see jumping to <br/>
conclusions and misinterpreting other posts.  A sharing of &quot;I really <br/>
enjoyed,&quot; &quot;I learned so much from,&quot; or &quot;have you read&quot; would go <br/>
further toward expaning horizons than a lesson in go find it yourself <br/>
and a dictate that one should not rely on only one body of work.  I <br/>
am willing to accept that the requestor is an adult and would come to <br/>
that conclusion themselves and not criticise what hasn&#39;t happened <br/>
until it does happen.<br/>
<br/>
There was no &quot;a&quot; source, there was no discussion of an unschooled <br/>
child&#39;s interest in history and it would appear that the person who <br/>
should have done more research or more accurate research is the one <br/>
giving the lecture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240714402">When in doubt, go straight to the source.  From the Smokey Valley <br/>
Genealogical Society:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I hope that I can answer your questions re: the 1895 School <br/>
Examination. <br/>
<br/>
The original test was loaned to our society by Mr. R.L. Armstrong, <br/>
long time Saline County Clerk.  The test was administered to county <br/>
grade-school students by his father, County Superintendent, J.W. <br/>
Armstrong in 1895.  The test was included in a book that we <br/>
published, &quot;Early School Records Saline County, Kansas 1875-1915&quot; in <br/>
1989.  The test was included in the book&#39;s &quot;Introduction&quot; merely as a <br/>
curiosity and to allow those who were researching their ancestors in <br/>
Saline County to experience some of the things their ancestors would <br/>
have experienced during their school years. <br/>
<br/>
We have a copy of the original.  The original was returned to the <br/>
Armstrong family after the society had copied it.  I don&#39;t know which <br/>
urban legends site you refer to, but I had a lengthy correspondence <br/>
with the &quot;snopes&quot; site last year, and sent him a copy of our copy, <br/>
which is a copy of the original document (a copy with no one holding <br/>
onto the test.) They wanted to know if I had seen the original of the <br/>
copy, which I had not.  However, I know members of our society who <br/>
have seen the original at the time it was copied, and also in a box <br/>
in the basement of our County Courthouse.  Both J.W. and R.L. <br/>
Armstrong have since passed away.  The original is now in the <br/>
possession of one of their descendants.  R.L. Armstrong had several <br/>
children and we have not been able to locate the original as many of <br/>
them no longer live in this area.  In searching the County <br/>
Courthouse, I found references to the test in J.W. Armstrongs own <br/>
hand in ledgers that were kept by the Superintendent, but did not <br/>
locate the test that was there when located in the basement.  Since <br/>
that time the school records have been moved from the basement to the <br/>
2nd floor.   <br/>
<br/>
Even though I have not myself seen the original test (I wish I could <br/>
say that I had), I do know the women who saw it and copied it.  Based <br/>
on the reputation and personal relationships that I have had with <br/>
these women, some of whom are also now deceased, I can honestly say <br/>
that I believe 100% that this is a copy of the original test.  Even <br/>
the copy shows the age of the document.  It appears to have been <br/>
printed on a printing press.  Many think it could only be an <br/>
authentic 1895 document if it were hand-written.  We did have <br/>
printing presses in 1895. <br/>
<br/>
I put the test on our website in about 1995, again, simply as a <br/>
resource for those researching their ancestors, as I also put some of <br/>
our school records on the site.  It sat there quietly and without <br/>
comment for all this time. About 2 years ago, the controversy began.  <br/>
Lately, I have seriously thought about removing it, but stubborness, <br/>
I guess, keeps me from doing it.  I think the test has been mis-used <br/>
by those who would use it to point fingers at the educational <br/>
institutions of today and say that students of today could not answer <br/>
the questions.  That may be true, I can&#39;t answer the questions, but I <br/>
seriously doubt that students of 1895 could answer the questions that <br/>
students of today find quite simple.  It&#39;s kind of like &quot;describe <br/>
Monrovia, Hecla, Juan Fermandez and Orinoco&quot; vs. &quot;describe Iran, Iraq <br/>
and Bosnia&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
You can only take a test on what you have been taught, and some of <br/>
the things that are in this test are no longer necessary for students <br/>
to learn. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that I have helped you to put the 1895 test into it&#39;s proper <br/>
context. <br/>
<br/>
If I can help further, please let me know. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>

&gt; I could care less whether students in 1895 could answer the <br/>
questions or<br/>
&gt; not.  But the fact is the supposed expose of the test as an &quot;urban <br/>
legend&quot;<br/>
&gt; turns out to be as dubious as the test itself!  &quot;Snopes&quot; was unable <br/>
to track<br/>
&gt; the &quot;legend&quot; to its fictitious source, nor come up with any <br/>
evidence that it<br/>
&gt; was in fact falsified. So he relies on deductive reasoning, based <br/>
on a series<br/>
&gt; of faulty syllogisms.   Interesting, but....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565442904">This thread so far has been a learning experience for me. Maybe there <br/>
will more to learn from it. I saw the &quot;8th grade education test&#39; <br/>
thing on a another list and was wowed by it. Then someone posted it <br/>
wasn&#39;t true. I went to the website and read the wasn&#39;t true part and <br/>
said to myself well they really aren&#39;t telling with real evidence its <br/>
not true either. I had forgotten that part but remembered that somone <br/>
directiong me to the possibility that it might not be true did effect <br/>
me. So when I saw it on this list I passed on the website that <br/>
suggested it might be false. I see know it might have been better to <br/>
say here&#39;s a link that suggests it might be false. Someone else has <br/>
almost gone to the source. Now we might be able to assume that the <br/>
original source persons are correct after all. Yet in my mind there <br/>
is enough doubt that as a good reporter(if I wanted to be one) I <br/>
would go to libraries and historical societies around my area and see <br/>
if I could find similar documents. The next thing would be to read <br/>
diaries, newspapers of the time period.  <br/>

questions about the Internet.<br/>

&gt; &quot;I hope that I can answer your questions re: the 1895 School<br/>
&gt; Examination.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The original test was loaned to our society by Mr. R.L. Armstrong,<br/>
&gt; long time Saline County Clerk.  The test was administered to county<br/>
&gt; grade-school students by his father, County Superintendent, J.W.<br/>
&gt; Armstrong in 1895.  The test was included in a book that we<br/>
&gt; published, &quot;Early School Records Saline County, Kansas 1875-1915&quot; in<br/>
&gt; 1989.  The test was included in the book&#39;s &quot;Introduction&quot; merely as a<br/>
&gt; curiosity and to allow those who were researching their ancestors in<br/>
&gt; Saline County to experience some of the things their ancestors would<br/>
&gt; have experienced during their school years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have a copy of the original. </span></blockquote></div>
