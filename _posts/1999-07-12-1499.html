<div id="ygrps-yiv-960728946"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:KSeebose@...">KSeebose@...</a><br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m sensing indifference from my 7 year<br/>
&gt; &gt;old, at just the beginning of my research..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have an 8 yo daughter, and She cannot handle anything that has a lot of<br/>
&quot;real-life&quot; killing. In other words, if it&#39;s in a video game or a cartoon, it&#39;s<br/>
pretend. If it&#39;s &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; it&#39;s real people, and she can&#39;t bear it.<br/>
The indifference you sense may be real fear of learning about something so<br/>
horrible. I think I must have been 10 or 11 before I even really understood the<br/>
Diary of Anne Frank, and more years after that before I realized what kind of<br/>
horrors really occurred. I&#39;m 44 years old, and still cringe when I see<br/>
&quot;Schindler&#39;s List,&quot; -- the very thought that human could do that to human makes<br/>
my blood run cold -- and the fact that systemaatic slaughter based on race is<br/>
still happening in the world makes it even more chilling.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you save your research results for when your children are a<br/>
little older, and in the meantime, do a theme study on something a little less<br/>
frightening. Or if you are really determined to use this theme, search out some<br/>
of the fiction  books about children who lived during those times, and keep<br/>
things very basic. Hiding in an attic in Amsterdam is a lot less frightening than<br/>
going to the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Or maybe switch your emphasis to how<br/>
children in the US viewed the &quot;Home Front&quot; during World War II (the Molly books<br/>
of the American Girls series are set in this time frame).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your research, and when you&#39;re done, perhaps you&#39;d share some<br/>
websites with us?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-111465154">Perhaps if you look at the main message you feel is most important to you <br/>
about the holocaust. Can you apply that to a situation she has interest in or <br/>
can relate to? You can still have her learn the moral or gain the character <br/>
without exposing her to information she is not currently interested in. Just <br/>
a thought, since it does seem important to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-873809805">All the thoughts are good ones...  :-)  I think I like the reference to the <br/>
Sound of Music -- great movie, GREAT music (I&#39;m a music geek at heart..) and <br/>
just enough of a reference I think for a 7 year old...  It&#39;s funny... I&#39;ve <br/>
avoided telling her more than she needs about sex because I heard you should <br/>
only answer to the questions that the ask.  (Where does a baby come from?  <br/>
... A mommy&#39;s uterus... etc.  Not the long involved answer about ovulation <br/>
predictor test, too much wine, etc.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughts...<br/>
