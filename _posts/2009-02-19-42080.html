<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289167796">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am going to be launching a new site in a few weeks, and I am wondering if<br/>
you all can give me your thoughts on the idea and tell me if it would be<br/>
something you might be interested in using. It will be a site that we can<br/>
buy ,sell, or trade items that we are done playing with, or the things are<br/>
no longer exciting in our homes and it is time to pass them on. I know for<br/>
us how much fun it is to find items that are &quot;new&quot; to us, and I also know<br/>
that we have many things that need new homes. I am thinking of charging a<br/>
membership fee, and then there will be a bulletin board where everyone can<br/>
list their items.  The other idea is to have a misc grab bag type option<br/>
where a family could put three or four things together and it would be a<br/>
surprise to the family receiving the items. I would love to hear your<br/>
feedback on this idea so that I can &quot;tweak&quot; things before I launch it. Thank<br/>
you for your thoughts!<br/>

In India, when we meet and greet and we say &quot;Namaste&quot;, which means: I honor<br/>
the place in you where the entire universe resides, I honor the place in you<br/>
of love, of light, of truth, of peace. I honor the place within you where if<br/>
you are in that place in you and I am in that place in me, there is only one<br/>
of us. ~Ram Dass<br/>

If we have not peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong<br/>
together.<br/>

I should say that there was some discussion earlier today in the chat  <br/>
room of an online bake sale/books/toys/stuff as a fund raiser for  <br/>
unschooling.info and the costs of my chatroom and website.  I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
want you to think I lifted your idea.  Schuyler and I talked about it  <br/>
more a few hours before your e-mail came.  I&#39;m not set up to do it,  <br/>
but it&#39;s a definite plan.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t necessarily conflict with your plans, but it seemed worth  <br/>
declaring.<br/>
