<div id="ygrps-yiv-906812611">I own another list called GayHomeschoolers, for parents who are gay or <br/>
lesbian, people with gay kids, allies, etc. who are homeschooling or thinking <br/>
about it. One member recently posted this, which I thought was pretty funny <br/>
and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think one of the issues I have is dealing with the polarities that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tend to exist in the homeschooling community at large. While the most <br/>
rabid of the religiously fundamentalist homeschoolers * (in any of <br/>
the religions) in our area tend to be isolationist, there are still <br/>
more than a few folks I&#39;ve dealt with in more tolerant/welcoming <br/>
groups that need to be helped to understand that its okay to take a <br/>
different path.<br/>
<br/>
*to be differentiated from the  rabidly fundamentalist unschoolers I <br/>
know, who are gregarious to a fault and perhaps proselytize more than <br/>
the religious :)&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share ;)<br/>
