<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582035086">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Oh, hey, now this could be fun! You&#39;re<br/>
geographically close enough that<br/>
we could actually go out together :-)<br/>
<br/>
Dar&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds great to me!<br/>
I wish you were out here now. Tamzin&#39;s in the UK for 3<br/>
weeks and I&#39;m just hanging out with more free time<br/>
than I know what to do with. <br/>
Well, that&#39;s actually not true. I&#39;m searching for more<br/>
work (that I can do from home), distressing furniture<br/>
(comes under the money-making heading), helping my mom<br/>
get her house ready to sell, staining my kitchen<br/>
cabinets, etc., etc.<br/>

<br/>
 I keep thinking that once we move back to California, I can hit all the<br/>
thrift stores in the small towns and find so much cool stuff to ebay.<br/>
There used to be a thrift store in Grass Valley, it closed a couple of<br/>
years ago but I went when I was teaching and filled two garbage bags full<br/>
of stuff for my kids for $5...toys, books, stuff like that, cool stuff.<br/>
It was awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Cacie is getting really good at finding stuff to ebay, it&#39;s quite cool. I<br/>
give her half the profit on stuff she finds, or she can buy it herself<br/>
and I&#39;ll help her list it and she gets all the profit. Between her<br/>
allowance, the money she made off a brownie outfit and some Barney<br/>
videos, money she made selling doughnuts at our yard sale, and money she<br/>
made just selling her stuff at our yard sale, she&#39;s up to $30 saved,<br/>
which is just amazing her.. generally money runs through her fingers like<br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
She did say yesterday that she wants to buy a rocking horse for a<br/>
friend&#39;s birthday next month, they were talking on the phone and her<br/>
friend said she wanted one. She&#39;s like that...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to other money-making ideas, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL!! You wouldn&#39;t believe how much money people (particularly <br/>
people in the Bay Area in CA) will pay for funky old looking <br/>
furniture. And I&#39;m certainly an expert on funky old furniture &lt;g&gt;! <br/>
Somehow I don&#39;t think distressed carpet will take off, but then <br/>
again, you never know...<br/>
