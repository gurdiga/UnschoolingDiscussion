<div id="ygrps-yiv-335250451">I was talking to someone about spoiling kids, and how I don&#39;t think you can spoil kids by saying yes as often as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
She asked me what about Nellie and Nancy Olson (from pbs Little House on the Prairie).  Why did they act the way they did even though their mom was always buying them whatever they wanted?  <br/>
<br/>
Of course they are fictional tv characters, but there are kids who act like them to a certain degree.  I said that there&#39;s more to it than just buying kids a lot of stuff.  How much attention did Mr. and Mrs. Olson give Nancy and Nellie?  How much time did they spend with them?  She said that they probably didn&#39;t give them any less attention than the Ingles gave Laura and Mary, because they lived in a time when people had to work their butts off all the time,  but Laura and Mary didn&#39;t act like spoiled brats.  She said they didn&#39;t act like brats because they weren&#39;t spoiled--when they got candy or toys or clothes it was a rare treat and they were grateful, and they had to do chores.  <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on that?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38077203">I think the term &quot;spolied&quot; means, ungrateful. Can priveleged <br/>
children be grateful, and underpriveledged children be ungrateful? I <br/>
think so. If a child gets what he wants and he has a good attitude, <br/>
he doesn&#39;t get called spoiled...but when he has a poor attitude he <br/>
does. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840321267">Nellie Olson has about a chapter long mention in the book &quot;On the<br/>
Banks of Plum Creek&quot;Â—there&#39;s another mention of her somewhere else,<br/>
but it&#39;s been 10 years at least since I read the books.  So, not only<br/>
does Nellie Olson only exist as the adult memory of a childhood event<br/>
of a girl who felt left out by the popular girl in Mankato (I think)<br/>
and who was writing for publishers in the 30&#39;s when morality was an<br/>
important part of children&#39;s stories, but the TV series Nellie Olson<br/>
is near complete fiction with Nancy Olson (who is complete fiction)<br/>
only being brought in to continue the conflict believed to be<br/>
necessary to keep the then 1980&#39;s television audience interested.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe you could suggest that she use real life examples when she<br/>
wants to talk about possible outcomes for your children?  <br/>

Nellie Olson&#39;s mother was ALSO spoiled, and thought her s**t don&#39;t  stink.  <br/>
 <br/>
Caroline, on the other hand, was humble and kind and moral and rarely  angry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672314621">Consider the parents. Wasn&#39;t Mrs. Olson a bit of a snob, who considered the <br/>
family too good for that small town life? Always hankering for the better <br/>
things of life, which were only available to city dwellers? Complaining a <br/>
lot. I always hated that the wife was this uber-bitch, while the meek and <br/>
mellow husband was just trying to do his best to make life good for her. <br/>
ugh. Meanwhile, Ma and Pa Ingalls were contented with their hard-working <br/>
life on the homestead. The husband and wife were respectful of each other, <br/>
while Mrs.Olson treated Mr. Olson kinda crappy. In both cases, modeling for <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, too: the TV series took Nellie Olson of the books (who was <br/>
older than Laura and a small rivalry was mentioned) and made her into this <br/>
hyper-superior bitch girl who hated Laura and did what she could to make her <br/>
life miserable through mockery or snide remarks, or what have you. The books <br/>
don&#39;t go into Nellie Olson&#39;s home life, where the TV series does. Etc.<br/>
<br/>
As for what causes spoiled kids in real life...someone already mentioned <br/>
ingratitude. That&#39;s a biggie, to be sure. Gratitude is learned, and I would <br/>
say kids learn from whom they spend time with.<br/>
<br/>
Being ignored would do it. How to make a whiny child: ignore her until she <br/>
whines. She&#39;ll learn pretty quick, that whining is what gets her mom&#39;s <br/>
attention. Or, better yet, ignore her until she does something bad, then <br/>
give her a whack or shout at her. That might not make for whining, though. <br/>
Just...trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Hm, here&#39;s a thought: always say &quot;no&quot; to start with, and then cave when the <br/>
kids turn on the tears or the tantrums. Use what they want as a bribe to <br/>
shut them up.<br/>
<br/>
my thoughts, anyway. for .02<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s like asking why the kids in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  <br/>
act the way they do.  Because they are caricatures.  They are samples  created <br/>
to &quot;prove&quot; a point that hasn&#39;t been really tested.  They (and  Nellie Olsen) <br/>
exist to control parents, and to keep kids down as an inferior  type of <br/>
not-yet-really-human.<br/>
 <br/>
Nellie&#39;s mom was always telling her she was beautiful and better and  <br/>
smarter, too.  <br/>
That&#39;s one of my (several) objections to the idea of &quot;giftedness&quot; in  <br/>
children.  Parents cooing over kids and telling them they&#39;re superior to  other <br/>
people isn&#39;t even a side-road to happiness.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- She said they didn&#39;t act like brats because they weren&#39;t spoiled--when  <br/>
they got candy or toys or clothes it was a rare treat and they were grateful,  <br/>
and they had to do chores.  <br/>
Any thoughts on that? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Only that it&#39;s the same old thing that&#39;s being said for years and years and  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t make sense in practice.  It&#39;s just a way to make kids &quot;hungry&quot;  <br/>
enough that you can bribe them with slight privileges and cheap gifts in order  <br/>
to control them.   When a kid knows parents could tet them more toys  or <br/>
clothes and the parents just don&#39;t, that does NOT make children  grateful.  When <br/>
they have to do chores because the parents are using them  as unpaid (or even <br/>
kid-wage) labor, that doesn&#39;t make them grateful.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have watched my whole life to see if the &quot;spoiled&quot; stuff worked.  My  mom <br/>
used to say my best friend was &quot;spoiled,&quot; but she wasn&#39;t.  It was just  a <br/>
gratuitous insult because her parents had money and a really nice house.   My mom <br/>
didn&#39;t want me to want to have Martha&#39;s life, so she said bad things  about <br/>
Martha.  Martha was nice and generous and never &quot;acted rich&quot; or acted  smart <br/>
about her privileges.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve heard other families say that about my kids, that they were &quot;spoiled&quot;  <br/>
because they didn&#39;t have to take constant orders from their parents, or sit <br/>
next  to their parents in public places.  They wanted their kids to be satisfied  <br/>
with being told exactly what to do and where and how to sit, instead of <br/>
wanting  to run around and look at things in the building as Kirby and Marty were <br/>
doing,  so they said &quot;you don&#39;t want to be spoiled like they are; they&#39;ll grow <br/>
up  unhappy; they&#39;ll never get a job.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
When my kids were little we had a next-door neighbor who used to come over  <br/>
and play every day or so.  We had a Xerox box full of fast-food toys.   He saw <br/>
that and his eyes got big and he asked if they could play with  them.  He was <br/>
clearly excited, but then his eyes got veiled and he came  back to himself <br/>
(the self his mom was creating) and said &quot;I don&#39;t save my toys  like this, <br/>
because I&#39;m not spoiled&quot; or something.  He was no longer as  happy to see them, <br/>
because it proved my kids were spoiled (in the universe being  created of guilt <br/>
and parental messages in his head).<br/>
 <br/>
The daughter of our most vocal critic came to Marty&#39;s pirate birthday party  <br/>
when he was four or five.  We had a buried treasure with a map, and she  being <br/>
one of the oldest (nine, probably) was the chief navigator and figured out  <br/>
how to read the map, and they dug up the treasure, which was an ammo box with  <br/>
bags of candy and gold coins and a few hundred pennies.  (I saw that ammo  box <br/>
the other day, with the screen-printed pirate flag glued to it--I had  <br/>
screenprinted a bunch of napkins and decorations, and made little flags, and one  <br/>
was glued flat on that box; still is.)   She was a &quot;sit here and be  quiet&quot; kind <br/>
of kid, but her mom wasn&#39;t at the party.  She SQUEALED when  they opened the <br/>
box, and said FULL VOICE for everyone at the party to hear, &quot;I  wish my mom <br/>
would do something like this for me!&quot;  I hadn&#39;t seen her that  excited since she <br/>
was at an amusement park when she was six or so.  <br/>
 <br/>
By the time her mom showed up, though, she was back to her malaise,  sighing, <br/>
being cynical, and when her mom asked her how the party was, she heaved  a <br/>
dramatic sigh, looked past her mom (no eye contact), and said, &quot;It was  <br/>
o-kay...&quot; like she couldn&#39;t really decide if it had been boring or not.<br/>
 <br/>
Kids learn to give up.<br/>
Kids who have to go to school learn to give up on wanting to be with their  <br/>
moms.<br/>
Kids who wish their parents would do something exciting for them learn to  <br/>
give up.<br/>
Kids who wish they had kept all their McDonald&#39;s toys in one big box learn  <br/>
to justify the loss of them.<br/>

Negativity and discontent might or might not be genetic, but they are sure  <br/>
contagious.<br/>
In a family where kids see smiling parents and hear &quot;a cool thing happened  <br/>
today&quot; and &quot;This is so great&quot; instead of grumbling, sighing, eye-rolling &quot;this  <br/>
sucks&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s stupid&quot; all the time, the kids are more likely to be  <br/>
satisfied with whatever it is that they have.<br/>
 <br/>
If they think it&#39;s expected of them to whine and complain and express their  <br/>
frustration with the stupid, unfair world around them, they&#39;ll do it.  <br/>
 <br/>
When the parents do that and THEN on top of all that complain that their  <br/>
kids are spoiled and unappreciative, it&#39;s just a disaster waiting to fester  <br/>
until it blows.  (Or some would say it blows already. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Well there is more truth in this moment than in a whole lot of parental finger-waving about the perils of indulging children.  I can really picture it.<br/>
<br/>
**I hadn&#39;t seen her that  excited since she <br/>

<br/>
We were at the beach amusment park all day yesterday, in the rain, because one of my friends kids really wanted to do it.  A memorable day. <br/>
<br/>
**Kids who wish they had kept all their McDonald&#39;s toys in one big box learn  <br/>
to justify the loss of them.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d speculate that the reason a mom would get rid of McDonald&#39;s toys rather than accumulate them could be because she didn&#39;t want to keep picking them up.  The deprivation-builds-character storyline sounds like it could be a convenient pretext.<br/>

of plenty.<br/>
<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t happen with just material goods. Dad can be working <br/>
extra hours so he can provide all the things he wants them to have. Mom <br/>
can spend her time making the house nice, cooking great meals, making <br/>
sure the kids are well clothed.<br/>

But what the kids understand from all the activity the parents are <br/>
devoting their time to is that those activities are more important than <br/>
the kids.<br/>
