midn too!).  I&#39;m sure you do all those things.  Just getting it in a form <br/>
that&#39;s acceptable to your locals.  Do you have a local support group?  Sorry <br/>
-- I forget.  Maybe someone there can share what a minimalist version of the <br/>
above dreck looks like.<br/>
<br/>
The standardized testing?  Can that be avoided by doing whatever V is about??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23292365">Please forgive me Nance , but how do you become a<br/>
private school ? I have never heard of anything of the<br/>
sort .<br/>
 BTW , moving IS a thought but not for sometime<br/>
unfortunatly . I can&#39;t wait to pack up all the kids<br/>
and move off to the wilds of Montana some day . The<br/>
city is a place that not many of us like but we some<br/>
how ended up here years ago when we were teens<br/>
ourselves .<br/>
 Support groups here are in short demand . People find<br/>
out you homeschool and they look at you & your kids<br/>
like you&#39;re from another planet . They sware up and<br/>
down you&#39;re raising an idiot that won&#39;t be fit for<br/>
society at any age because they&#39;ll be completely<br/>
ignorant . These people even include family members .<br/>
I&#39;ll check our State HS Assosiation and see what they<br/>
have to say . I had spoken to them a few times during<br/>
our 1st attempt at hs-ing and they seem to be very<br/>
rigid as if they were part of a public school system .<br/>
Maybe I just came across that person on a bad day .<br/>
God knows we all have them !<br/>
<br/>
Til later<br/>

Good evening<br/>
This state is none other than Washington . No , not DC either . We <br/>
seem to be over run with rules , laws , and regulations to try and <br/>
discourage us from anything that our law makers don&#39;t see as &quot;fit&quot; .<br/>
Very scary as far as I&#39;m concerned !</div>

Where are you now?<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers operating happily (and even legally) in every U.S. <br/>
state.  There are state folders at www.unschooling.com, and sorry if I missed <br/>
a what-state answer earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Also look at Carol Narigon&#39;s curriculum which she has turned in in Ohio (this <br/>
one and variants thereof):<br/>
