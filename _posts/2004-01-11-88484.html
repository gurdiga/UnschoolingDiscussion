Read, every day, something that no one else is reading.<br/>
Think, every day, something that no one else is thinking.<br/>
Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do.<br/>
It is bad for the mind to continually be part of unanimity.<br/>
~Christopher Morley<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He who is ashamed of asking is ashamed of learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
- Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is change, continuing change, inevitable change, that<br/>

account not only the world as it is, but the world as it<br/>
will be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Isaac Asimov, Science Fiction Writer<br/>
<br/>

No one can stop you from changing.<br/>
No one really knows how you must change.<br/>
Not even you.<br/>
Not until you start. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Dr. David Viscott, Author and Psychologist<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ninety-nine percent of the failures come from people who<br/>
have the habit of making excuses.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-  George Washington Carver, Chemist and Educator<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A goal is created three times. First as a mental picture.<br/>
Second, when written down to add clarity and dimension.<br/>
And third, when you take action towards its achievement.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Gary Ryan Blair, ³The Goals Guy²<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just as our eyes need light in order to see, our minds<br/>
need ideas in order to conceive. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Napoleon Hill, Author<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ideas won&#39;t keep; something must be done about them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Alfred North Whitehead, Mathematician and philosopher<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in<br/>
thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates<br/>
love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Lao-Tzu, Chinese Philosopher & Founder of Taoism<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Listen to your life. See it for the fathomless mystery that it<br/>
is.  In the boredom and pain of it no less than in the<br/>
excitement and gladness: touch, taste, smell your way to<br/>
the holy and hidden heart of it because in the last<br/>
analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is<br/>
grace.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Frederick Buechner, Author, in  &quot;Now and Then&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position<br/>
that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome while<br/>
trying to succeed&quot;-- Booker T. Washington<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The smartest thing that a person can do is to persistently think<br/>
the thoughts that are consistent with the kind of person he or she<br/>
would like to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Brian Tracy, Author and Personal Development Expert<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By learning to be with myself, to bring peace to myself,<br/>
I can be more effective both in creating happiness in my<br/>
own life and in offering a helping hand to others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Ingrid Bacci, Author<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Each human being is bred with a unique set of potentials<br/>
that yearn to be fulfilled as surely as the acorn yearns<br/>
to become the oak within it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-  Aristotle, Philosopher<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Greatness comes with recognizing that your potential<br/>
is limited only by how you choose, how you use your<br/>
freedom, how resolute you are, how persistent you are -<br/>
in short, by your attitude.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Peter Koestenbaum, Philosopher<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Here&#39;s what is exciting about sharing ideas with others:<br/>
if you share a new idea with ten people, they get to hear<br/>
it once and you get to hear it ten times. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Jim Rohn, Speaker and Author<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but<br/>
sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Thich Nhat Hanh, Author and Buddhist Monk<br/>
<br/>
This one could cause some discussions as it has whenever I use it for my sig<br/>
line. ;-)<br/>
&quot;To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the<br/>
affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure<br/>
the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best of<br/>
others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a<br/>
garden path, a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed<br/>
easier because you have lived. This is to have Succeeded.&quot;<br/>
Bessie Stanley<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One of the most tragic things I know about human<br/>
nature is that all of us tend to put off living. We are<br/>
all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon,<br/>
instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside<br/>
our windows today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Dale Carnegie, Author<br/>
<br/>
We worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he<br/>
is someone today.<br/>
Stacie Tauscher<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The fact that you are willing to say, &quot;I do not<br/>
understand, and it is fine,&quot; is the greatest understanding<br/>
you could exhibit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
- Wayne Dyer, Author and Speaker<br/>
<br/>
This one too. The signature.;-)<br/>
The hardest battle is to be nobody but yourself<br/>
in a world that is doing its best, night and day,<br/>
to make you like everybody else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477171412">&lt;&lt;I want to either do our half bathroom or my computer room walls (or<br/>
both)<br/>
with quotes but I haven&#39;t figured out a way to do it yet. Anyone have any<br/>
ideas? Oh and my handwriting is awful.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes writing that looks awful small on a page just looks cool and<br/>
calligraphic on the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions: stencils; printing fonts you like on the computer and then<br/>
tracing onto the wall with graphite paper to guide your painting; using a<br/>
projector with the quote in the font you like to trace it out; getting the<br/>
quote made up in vinyl letters at a sign shop and then sticking it up (it<br/>
will come formatted)<br/>
