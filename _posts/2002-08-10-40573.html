<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402499207">&lt;&lt; There are two great ones Get the Asterix series and/or the Tin Tin<br/>
series of comix style books. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NOT easy reading (Asterix).  I&#39;ve really enjoyed them as an adult, but <br/>
beginning readers won&#39;t be able to use them.  Most of the jokes require a <br/>
fair amount of prior knowledge to be funny, the print is teensy, and the <br/>
words are difficult.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re originally French, and translated into British English.  For more <br/>
advanced readers they&#39;re wonderful.  For medieval history buffs they&#39;re GREAT!<br/>
<br/>
For years they were hard to come by in the U.S. but still easy in England.  <br/>
They&#39;re easy again here, for a while probably.  It seems to go in waves.  <br/>
There are some newer ones, too.  (Meaning in the past ten years &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
