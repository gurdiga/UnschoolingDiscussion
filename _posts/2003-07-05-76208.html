  &gt; &gt;The translation is imperfect, <br/>
  &gt; &gt;but vastly better than nothing!<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; And often humorous! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

  That is too funny.  I remember going to a restaurant in Southern Germany I <br/>
  believe.  The menu was in German with several different language translations.  <br/>
  I can&#39;t remember the German version but the English translation had one item <br/>
  as &quot;roasted beetles and chicken knuckles.&quot;  Too funny.  Jackson ordered it, <br/>
  hoping it was really beets and drumsticks, and it was.  LOL<br/>
