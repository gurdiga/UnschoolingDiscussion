<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089062340">I agree with Kelly... nothing wrong with Witch shows, they are pretend, fun, <br/>
funny, and FANTACY. I really dont think its goning to turn kids into <br/>
witches. And further more they are just MAKE-BELIEVE, as there are NO <br/>
WITCHES that I know of that have those kinds of POWERS. Its make believe. <br/>
Why take away a childs natural need for fantacy?<br/>
Its OK to be Christian... Its OK to have beliefs....but please dont ruin <br/>
your kids good time by being overly sensitive about TV SHOWS&gt;<br/>

liberating! If a Christian loves and respects her children and <br/>
treats them accordingly, how does her faith become a handicap?  You <br/>
don&#39;t have to be a Christian to unschool. That&#39;s not my point. But <br/>
you CAN be a Christian and unschool. If the argument is that a <br/>
parent will want to limit a child&#39;s experiences because it doesn&#39;t <br/>
conform to their beliefs, than yeah, that would be a handicap. But, <br/>
me personally as a Christian don&#39;t think that hammering your faith <br/>
into a child&#39;s head is going to produce a true believer anyway. <br/>
Because no matter what you believe, if you&#39;re Christian or Pagan <br/>
or.... you&#39;re still going to hold your breath and see and hope you <br/>
might have your faith or lack thereof in common with your children.  <br/>
But it&#39;s not necessary in order to love them and respect them.  Even <br/>
Jesus recognized the value of free will.<br/>

&gt; you CAN be a Christian and unschool. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, you can.  Teri Brown and Elissa Wahl wrote a book<br/>
called Christian Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If the argument is that a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of Christians do think that way, and I know a LOT<br/>
of them for whom it would take a miracle for them to<br/>
become unschoolers.  They would have to reject a lot<br/>
of what is taught from the pulpit about their<br/>
children.  I know I had to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because no matter what you believe, if you&#39;re<br/>

&gt; might have your faith or lack thereof in common with<br/>
&gt; your children.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But many Christians are taught that all they have to<br/>
do is follow a book about child training by the Ezzos<br/>
or Pearls and their children will become Christians. <br/>
And if they just spank hard enough and long enough and<br/>
often enough, their children will stop sinning and<br/>
will pray and ask Jesus into their heart.<br/>
<br/>
Any child would pray that prayer just to get the<br/>
spanking to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But it&#39;s not necessary in order to love them and<br/>
&gt; respect them.  Even <br/>
&gt; Jesus recognized the value of free will.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tanya<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True, and there is a Christian unschooling list at<br/>
yahoo groups called CCU (christ-centered unschooling)<br/>
and there are several other similar lists that are<br/>
smaller.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:CCU-List@...">CCU-List@...</a><br/>
<br/>
CCU has a different flavor than this one, being more<br/>
like a coffee club and the conversations more like you<br/>
would find sitting on a porch swing with some friends<br/>
who happen to be unschoolers/homeschoolers.  Not<br/>
everyone is there to specifically talk about<br/>
unschooling, but are willing if someone brings it up.<br/>
<br/>
I like both that list and this one, as they each fill<br/>
a need in my growth as an unschooler.<br/>

there.  Although the recent debate there about the<br/>
Atkins diet versus Vegetarianism got rather heated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Many true unschoolers are on that list, and has been a<br/>
great resource.  Maybe you didn&#39;t stick around long<br/>
enough.  Although the friendships on that particular<br/>
list are thicker than just unschooling, and there are<br/>
plenty of non-unschoolers there who don&#39;t even claim<br/>
to be unschoolers, it is still a fine list for what<br/>
some people are looking for...support and a place to<br/>
relax.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, it is a different flavor from this one,<br/>
which is not a support group and serves a different<br/>
need.  Sounds like you are right where you need to be<br/>
now.  That is great.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sheila<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The book does use a broader definition of unschooling<br/>
than is found here and many of the essays are by<br/>
homeschoolers who are moving towards unschooling, so<br/>
are still using curricula in one way or another. <br/>
<br/>
It talks as unit studies as a *bridge* between<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling, not that unit studies<br/>
ARE unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it has been a while since you read the book,<br/>
though, Sheila.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s cool.  Not every resource is for everybody. <br/>
That is why there is so much available.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been taught that original sin doesn&#39;t mean we are<br/>
&quot;bad&quot;.  That would be a rather simplistic explanation.<br/>
 It means we are separated from God.  Christ<br/>
reconciled us back to Himself on Easter morning out of<br/>
his great love for us.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a much longer, theological explanation, CS<br/>
Lewis and Francis Schaeffer do it much better than I,<br/>
and that isn&#39;t my point here.<br/>
<br/>
Now, living in fear of hell fire and damnation would<br/>
be terribly stressful.  I mean really!  The ultimate<br/>
stress factor.<br/>
<br/>
I could also live in fear of being hit by a car, of my<br/>
child becoming a drug addict, of my husband being shot<br/>
on his way to work (living through the sniper attacks<br/>
in this area was STRESSFUL)!<br/>
<br/>
Living by faith means that I have faith that God can<br/>
move mountains, created our beautiful earth and each<br/>
of you.  Living by intrinsically motivated faith means<br/>
that He put that faith inside my heart when He created<br/>
me, and in my children&#39;s hearts when He created them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he<br/>
is old he will not depart from it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That verse has been twisted and mangled to mean a lot<br/>
of bad things...that we must control our children,<br/>
beat our children, force-feed religion to our<br/>
children, you name it.<br/>
<br/>
But I am living by faith.  Faith that my God who<br/>
planted this faith inside me also planted it inside my<br/>
children.  Faith that by trying my best to model<br/>
genuine faith before their eyes and by answering their<br/>
questions, and asking their forgiveness when I make<br/>
mistakes, the faith inside them will be nurtured and<br/>
grow, and when they are old they won&#39;t depart from it.<br/>
 But faithful to model it before them, regardless of<br/>
how the outcome looks.  Ultimately, Totally, from the<br/>
beginning, it is between them and God.<br/>
<br/>
I live by faith, not by fear.  So I can unschool, and<br/>
trust God, and believe that the same God who can<br/>
rescue me from hell can rescue them, and He will.  <br/>
<br/>
By faith.<br/>
<br/>
I really hope my children do start to question, and<br/>
wonder, and test the boundaries.  Because then I know<br/>
that that seed that God placed in there is starting to<br/>
grow and become their own faith.  I think I will<br/>
rejoice when it starts to happen (well, ok, the 14yo<br/>
is already there...LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I am not going to post much any more on this<br/>
subject, because I feel I am starting to get preachy<br/>
and no one likes a preachy unschooler ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Goodnight, List!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kelly --<br/>
<br/>
Try reading the marvelous book _Original Blessing_ by once Catholic now <br/>
Episcopal priest Matthew Fox.  You can start with this brief review from the <br/>
Spirituality and Health website: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/items/bookreview/item_2448.html">http://www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/items/bookreview/item_2448.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is interested in Fox&#39;s teachings can visit his foundation at <br/>
www.creationspirituality.org<br/>
<br/>
From that review:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;With pinpoint accuracy, Fox notes: &quot;The forces of fear and pessimism so <br/>
prevalent in society and religion need to be countered by an increased awareness <br/>
of awe and goodness.&quot; Throughout the book, the author celebrates the wonder of <br/>
creation and &quot;the royal personhood&quot; of individuals. Each of the chapters <br/>
begins with a treasure trove of thought-provoking quotations from religious <br/>
writers including Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen, Teilhard de Chardin, Julian <br/>
of Norwich, Dorothy Day, and many others.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fox maintains that the concept of Original Sin is increasingly, and rightly, <br/>
rejected by the majority of Christians, and that as God created us in the <br/>
image of God, we are loved and beautiful exactly as we are.<br/>
<br/>
I find that this perspective is perfectly compatible with the celebration of <br/>
the individual intrinsic to the unschooling life philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Your questions are good ones.  :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe the assumption that all Christians are preaching about<br/>
&gt; hell&#39;s fire and damnation needs to be let go.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As far as I can tell, no one&#39;s made that assumption.<br/>
<br/>
But we are talking about fundamenatlist Christians specifically because<br/>
other denominations of Christianity -- and in general other religions --<br/>
don&#39;t have the conflicts with unschooling that fundamentalist Christianity<br/>
-- and probably any fundamentalist religion really -- potentially can have.<br/>
<br/>
What makes the discussions confusing is that many fundamentalist Christians<br/>
-- and significantly the politically active ones that get their views in<br/>
front of the public -- use Christian to be synonymous with their own brand<br/>
of Christianity. And so general society now uses Christian to mean *both*<br/>
fundamentalist Christian and the broader meaning of Christian. Which meaning<br/>
they intend for Christian is usually pretty clear from the context.<br/>
<br/>
Of course to make it more confusing, some people do equate fundamentalists<br/>
with mainstream Christians. But, to me at least, it&#39;s usually pretty obvious<br/>
when someone&#39;s doing that from how their wording what they&#39;re saying.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1794354480">I asked how they unschool math and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; I got the answer <br/>
&gt; &gt; that most of them still use a curriculum for math. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I heard them <br/>
&gt; &gt; saying stuff about unit studies and I asked how that<br/>
&gt; &gt; was unschooling <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I got yelled at for being limited in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; definition of <br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooler.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yelled at?  Hmm...I rarely hear yelling going on over<br/>
&gt; there.  Although the recent debate there about the<br/>
&gt; Atkins diet versus Vegetarianism got rather heated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe yelled at wasn&#39;t the best choice of words.  Severely scolded?  <br/>
I definitely ruffled more than a few feathers when I said stuff <br/>
like, &quot;But that&#39;s not unschooling!&quot; when they talked about doing <br/>
Charlotte Mason or Saxon math.  I was basically told how dare I have <br/>
such a narrow definition of unschooling, and if someone considered a <br/>
day of handwriting, math, and mandatory Scripture study to be <br/>
unschooling, who was I to say it wasn&#39;t?  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The book does use a broader definition of unschooling<br/>
&gt; than is found here and many of the essays are by<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers who are moving towards unschooling, so<br/>
&gt; are still using curricula in one way or another. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It talks as unit studies as a *bridge* between<br/>
&gt; homeschooling and unschooling, not that unit studies<br/>
&gt; ARE unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; Perhaps it has been a while since you read the book,<br/>
&gt; though, Sheila.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s cool.  Not every resource is for everybody. <br/>
&gt; That is why there is so much available.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has been awhile since I read it and I have stopped lending the <br/>
book out and just gave it away since I&#39;m trying to declutter and <br/>
didn&#39;t have a personal need for it anymore.  I do remember them <br/>
talking about unit studies as a bridge to unschooling.  But I also <br/>
remember that of all the essays in the book, only a few were what I <br/>
would consider unschoolers.  The majority would be what I would <br/>
consider relaxed homeschoolers.  And some of the essays that were <br/>
supposedly about unschooling talked about doing unit study type <br/>
stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I think it would be a great resource for Christian homeschoolers and <br/>
I have no problem with the book itself--just that it being called <br/>
Christian UNSCHOOLING is likely to lead a lot of Christians into <br/>
believing that they&#39;re unschooling when they&#39;re really not.  The <br/>
unschooling lifestyle is so rich and good that it would be a shame if <br/>
people don&#39;t ever fully &quot;get there&quot; because a book led them to <br/>
believe that unschooling sometimes involves use of curriculum and <br/>
parent-designed, parent-led lessons.  <br/>

are anti-christian. I&#39;ve tried to point out that &#39;normal&#39; people also call <br/>
themselves christian but when we were in town the other day there was a evangelical <br/>
group singing and talking with a microphone. Rhodri marched up to them and <br/>
told them to shut up and stop bothering people. He was practically spitting with <br/>
annoyance.<br/>
I was mortified as I&#39;ve always tried to bring them up to be tolerant but I <br/>
thik fundies in the US hurt them more than I realised :-(<br/>
