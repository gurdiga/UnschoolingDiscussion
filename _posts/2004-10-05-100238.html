<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906726599">-=-the same sort of thing is happening with letting go of the whole <br/>
concept of good food before bad food idea. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bad food&quot; isn&#39;t a good concept, and so the way this is worded I think <br/>
there&#39;s a misunderstanding of what people have recommended.<br/>
<br/>
-=- we&#39;re buying more junk <br/>
food than we ever have before, scarfing it, regretting we did, and <br/>
then wishing we had more money to buy more junk. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&quot; the family?  Parents?  <br/>
<br/>
-=-we&#39;ve always kind <br/>
of had it where we didn&#39;t buy sweets much, and if we had them, they <br/>
were to be kind of rationed out.  with the restraint gone, it&#39;s <br/>
almost like competetion...who can get to it the fastest kind of <br/>
thing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If rationing it out works best for your family, it certainly won&#39;t keep you <br/>
from being unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a &quot;let them eat cake&quot; first step situation.  <br/>
I think there are some constants, or cause/effect factors:<br/>
<br/>
-Dessert-training is fraught with problems.<br/>
-&quot;Clean your plate&quot; causes problems.<br/>
-Forcing children to finish food (givingthem the leftovers for their next <br/>
meal) is cruel.<br/>
-Limitations can create desire.<br/>
Arbitrary rules (no seconds, wait for noon, salad first) don&#39;t help anyone.<br/>
<br/>
When a family hasn&#39;t really looked at the basic factors like those, but just <br/>
tries to  jump from one shore to another, it doesn&#39;t accomplish much.  If the <br/>
parents don&#39;t understand the principles, the kids can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When people have said &quot;If you had candy  all the time, they would eventually <br/>
slack off on the candy,&quot; they didn&#39;t mean to say &quot;START HERE:  get a ton of <br/>
candy.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280133018"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&quot;Bad food&quot; isn&#39;t a good concept, and so the way this is worded &gt;I think <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i was referring to my own previous concept.  healthy food vs. junk food. <br/>
good vs. bad.  that&#39;s how i looked at it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;-=- we&#39;re buying more junk <br/>

<br/>
&gt;&quot;We&quot; the family?  Parents? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>all of us.  the kids will be gracious and share their treats (i let them<br/>
each pick and extra goody on our last trip), but they&#39;re still gone<br/>
before the night&#39;s out.  for the record, it was an entire box of fruit by<br/>
the foot, a big bag of gummy worms and a box of cereal bar thingies.  all<br/>
gone before bed even though we got home after 9pm from the store. and now<br/>
everytime we go, i&#39;m getting nagged the whole trip through about what<br/>
they&#39;re going to get and having them change their mind twelve times. <br/>
multiply it by three and factor in that one&#39;s a two year old who doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand if she&#39;s choosing clam juice or coffee when she picks<br/>
something up.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If rationing it out works best for your family, it certainly &gt;won&#39;t keep<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;from being unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i don&#39;t want my kids to grow up like me...using food to feel good. <br/>
sneaking junk food and feeling bad about themselves.  i can&#39;t control the<br/>
outcomes, but i don&#39;t want to create problems either.<br/>
<br/>
-Dessert-training is fraught with problems.<br/>
<br/>
yes, i&#39;m experiencing it now. :)<br/>
<br/>
-&quot;Clean your plate&quot; causes problems.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve never forced this one.  i trust my kids to eat as much as they&#39;re<br/>
hungry for.  reminds me of a story my mom often relates about her strict<br/>
german father.  my uncle didn&#39;t finish his allotted portion, so he was<br/>
put in the bathtub and had his plate dumped on his head.  as a child. <br/>
ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-Forcing children to finish food (giving them the leftovers for their<br/>
next <br/>
meal) is cruel.<br/>
<br/>
sounds like my dad.  he&#39;d put the food on our plates (giving me more than<br/>
i would have chosen to eat) and then make me sit at the table til i&#39;d<br/>
eaten it all, snuck it to the dog, or frustrated him enough to let me go.<br/>
<br/>
-Limitations can create desire.<br/>
<br/>
i still deal with this as an adult.  and it&#39;s my main motivation in<br/>
releasing controls on my kids.  i want them to make healthy positive<br/>
associations with food.  i just don&#39;t know how to help them since i am<br/>
having a hard time modeling good behaviors.  i sneak.  i overeat.  when i<br/>
get in a bad cycle and gain weight, i stop exercising and hide from<br/>
people, i guilt myself and cry about being fat when i&#39;m not really.  how<br/>
can she not pick that up?<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Arbitrary rules (no seconds, wait for noon, salad first) don&#39;t &gt;help<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anyone.<br/>
<br/>
i get that.  but those things don&#39;t feel arbitrary to me because, for me,<br/>
they&#39;re almost protective.  i live on a food reward system personally and<br/>
i don&#39;t see how to break it.  boy, i&#39;ve got issues...and i didn&#39;t realize<br/>
how negative for everyone they are. :(<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;candy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so, then where do you start?  how does one go about something like this<br/>
gradually?<br/>
