&lt;&lt;  I also agree with whomever<br/>
 said spelling is important.  This is one of my pet peeves, poor spelling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This message is in response not just to this one, but to the others who <br/>
posted about handwriting or &quot;good&quot; (I would say &quot;standard&quot;) grammar being <br/>
&quot;important.&quot;  I think it&#39;s fine for all of us to discuss our pet peeves but <br/>
there&#39;s a world of difference between acknowledging that something bugs us <br/>
and between saying it&#39;s &quot;important&quot; to know it.  <br/>
<br/>
My understanding of unschooling is that it&#39;s up to the person who is learning <br/>
to determine what is important, not anyone else.  You may find a closer, more <br/>
spiritual connection to words through handwriting, but I may not.  Therefore, <br/>
it is not important for me to learn beautiful handwriting.  The same is true <br/>
of spelling or grammar.<br/>
<br/>
So, what, academically, do people on this list think is really important to <br/>
learn?   Important enough that if your child wasn&#39;t learning it through <br/>
unschooling means you would actually sit him or her down and teach her in <br/>
whatever way worked?  And why?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  whew!  i had to really think about this!  My first impulsive <br/>
thought was &quot;nothing&quot; academically.  there is nothing academically <br/>
that i would actually sit down and teach him if he wasn&#39;t asking to <br/>
be taught or learning on his own.  What i would teach however, is <br/>
that it is more important to know &quot;where&quot; to find the answers when <br/>
you need them than it is to &quot;know&quot; all the answers.  then i caught <br/>
myself and argued &quot;but DUH! if one does not know how to read, then <br/>
how would they be able to process the information they found&quot;.  so i <br/>
guess my answer would be &quot;reading&quot;. i would be sure to sit down and <br/>
teach him reading if it didn&#39;t happen of his own accord. and <br/>
so then i went &quot;oh DUH!&quot; AGAIN! this is in direct contradiction to my <br/>
first and foremost in importance - to know &quot;where&quot; to find the <br/>
answers!  well...  all the answers aren&#39;t exclusively in a readable <br/>
format!  there are so many other ways to learn what you want to know <br/>
- especially in today&#39;s visually multi-media rich society.  therefore, it <br/>
would be more important for him to know where to find the answers on <br/>
how to learn to read than the actual act of knowing how to read. <br/>
<br/>
my, that was hard for me to say!  i hope it doesn&#39;t sound as <br/>
confusing as it was for me to try and say it.<br/>

learning it has to be important to him / her not to me or anyone else.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same comments as above. You see, I think that the most important thing they can<br/>
learn is that they are loved and worthy of being loved. That there is someone<br/>
who loves them, that trusts them to be able to do the best they can, and who<br/>
will be there to help them if / when they need help. And that applies even if<br/>
your child is virtually non-functioning, brain-damaged whatever. They need to<br/>
learn that they are loved.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to read doesn&#39;t matter a damn by comparison. There are astonishing<br/>
numbers of successful people out there that can&#39;t read. I&#39;m sure, given the<br/>
choice they&#39;d rather be able to read, but not at the cost of feeling bad about<br/>
themselves. And there a lot of people in the world today who feel like failures<br/>
because they were made to feel bad when they couldn&#39;t read / compute /<br/>
write...... at the &#39;normal&#39; age.<br/>
<br/>
Just by living with you, your children will learn what is important to you, and<br/>
to the sort of life you lead. And it&#39;s fine to let them know what you think is<br/>
important. But I feel that  academics are just a tool to help people build a<br/>
successful, happy life, and so it seems silly to place the emphasis on the tool<br/>
rather than the outcome.<br/>

to learn. You have to get out and practice them, see them in action, find<br/>

I think you hit the nail on the head.  I kind of ran headfirst into this one, <br/>
because my second child has some fairly significant neurological damage.  He <br/>
is just learning to walk at nearly four, and speaks only a few barely <br/>
recogizable words.  I originally tried going to the local early intervention <br/>
program with him, but just came out nauseated by constant testing and <br/>
comparing and the complete lack of actually paying attention to the child at <br/>
hand.  They are constantly trying to teach these babies things they are <br/>
nowhere near interested in yet and in which the kids are completely passive <br/>
participants.  But they always exclaimed when Gordon finally got to something <br/>
about the dedication and enthusiasm with which he pursued it.  (Basically <br/>
just normal baby &quot;time to work on this&quot; monomania.)  They kept telling me <br/>
these children were completely incapable of learning anything on their own <br/>
motivation, which is why they had to step in and push on skill p, even though <br/>
the child showed no interest in doing anything except working on skill h, and <br/>
hadn&#39;t any of the precursors to skill p.  They tried to get Gordon walking <br/>
before he could crawl though he showed an interest in crawling and collapsed <br/>
in a heap about walking.  This, in the name of &quot;catching up&quot;.  <br/>
    So I blithely got into unschooling with kid 1, who began reading the <br/>
newspaper over my shoulder at 3, figuring that if no one learned anything for <br/>
a few years life would still be great.  And now I am biting my nails <br/>
unschooling with kid 2 hoping it works out keeping him far from this system <br/>
that wants him to do everything but what he can.  I want him to keep his <br/>
motivation, his sense of success, his job as the active instigator and not <br/>
the passive follower.  I want him to be able to be himself without any sense <br/>
that he was supposed to be something else.  There are machines that will read <br/>
to you these days, (once Mom&#39;s gone on her way).  There are programs that <br/>
will write what you say.  There are calculators.  But I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a <br/>
technofix for a broken spirit yet.  <br/>

Carol, this is exactly what I was meaning.  Thank you for your post.  (And <br/>
thank you, Karen, for your story as well.)  I&#39;m certainly not saying that <br/>
some academic things aren&#39;t important to *me* but I&#39;m very wary of the idea <br/>
of saying they are &quot;important&quot; as a blanket statement.  <br/>
<br/>
I do understand the postings people have made about such basic things as <br/>
reading, learning where to find information, etc. and I admit that if my <br/>
child isn&#39;t reading at age 9, I&#39;ll start getting a little ancy myself.  But I <br/>
still think at the heart of things is that individual&#39;s desire to learn <br/>
something and their own perceived need of it for their life.  Not mine.<br/>

&gt;Thanks for all the votes of confidence.  They mean a lot, with the world at <br/>

Just wait! They graduate from these world class sports to wall coloring,<br/>
table jumping, and food loosing (leaving apple core in clean laundry basket<br/>
etc;) and door frame climbing. My kids are gold medallists.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our favorites were _What&#39;s Happening to My Body? by Lynda Madaras.<br/>
There&#39;s a book for boys and one for girls, as well as newer <br/>
workbooks.  They are definitely not dry, but they may be too graphic <br/>
for some families.  They are very straightforward and include <br/>
information on topics such as homosexuality, birth control, and <br/>
sexually transmitted diseases.  We&#39;re very open and accepting in our <br/>
home and discuss all topics,  but not everyone would be comfortable <br/>
with these, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
