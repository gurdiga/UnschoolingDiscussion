<div id="ygrps-yiv-368626178">This is sort of off topic, not that that&#39;s new or anything :-), but with all <br/>
the talk of snobbery and doing things the &#39;right way&#39;, I wonder. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t anyone on here discussing the pure unschooling as any sort of Ms. <br/>
Superiority. In my short time here, I&#39;ve sort of got the idea of what <br/>
unschooling is. And I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a free for all. By that I mean, <br/>
it&#39;s not that parents get to do it however they see fit outside of the <br/>
curriculum confines. I think unschooling by definition means not to school a <br/>
child. Not even a little.  It does sound extreme, but that&#39;s what it means to <br/>
me. And throwing any enforced &#39;format&#39; into the mix changes it. <br/>
I love this concept, and believe in it completely. But I find it a somewhat <br/>
challenging road, mainly I think due to my own upbringing and current <br/>
environment. For someone to keep telling me when I veer off course, is <br/>
wonderful for me. I don&#39;t find it condascending, I find it eye opening. When <br/>
I get those cues, be it internal or external, I always have a choice. <br/>
Sometimes that choice is, well that sounds all wonderful and everything, that <br/>
may be fine for so-and-so, but not for us. And sometimes that choice is, wow, <br/>
that would be much better than what we&#39;re doing now. In my personal <br/>
experience, the former is usually a reluctance to change or give up something <br/>
that would allow a change.<br/>
<br/>
There is a quote which I framed and put up in my living room, which I <br/>
detest....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The downside to enlightenment no one ever mentions is that once you <br/>
understand how the Universe operates, you can&#39;t play dumb.&quot; Sarah Ban <br/>
Breathnach<br/>

This is not a specific reply to anyone, just a general thread I was reading...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>**This is where the rubber meets the road.  I find it terribly condescending. <br/>
 I don&#39;t need to be told that I have veered off course -- where was that <br/>
course again?? Maybe I like being off course every once in a while.  Maybe <br/>
I&#39;m on a different course.  For a while.  For a few minutes of the day.  It&#39;s <br/>
up to me and mine.  I have always despised being told what to do.  A personal <br/>
failing I am sure.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I think that some people don&#39;t mind being led and guided and some of us <br/>
(me at least) object strenuously.<br/>

take what is useful to ourselves and move on.  Some days we must respond.  <br/>
Some days it is something actually useful.<br/>
<br/>
In my personal <br/>
experience, the former is usually a reluctance to change or give up something <br/>

<br/>
**Great insight into your own personal situation.  If being led and guided <br/>
helps you this much, I can only applaud you learning process.<br/>
<br/>
**But all of us are not cut from the same cloth.  And will object when it is <br/>
appropriate.  Some days with humor, some days not.<br/>

(not that you at all intended that, it&#39;s just me :-)) I don&#39;t like to take <br/>
orders or have others guide my life.  But I have to admit that at times there <br/>
are things others can see that I can&#39;t. This realization came to me very, <br/>
very, *very* slowly and reluctantly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I almost used the phrase unsolicited advice in my own post, but decided <br/>
against it. I can&#39;t really think of this forum under that term. This seems a <br/>
place for posting questions and offering support. I guess everyone may view <br/>
it differently, but I personally wouldn&#39;t put anything on here that I wasn&#39;t <br/>
comfortable debating/defending. Sure we shouldn&#39;t have to defend everything <br/>
we say, but if no one questioned anything, would that be helping or hurting? <br/>
And myself, if there&#39;s a parenting philosophy that I hold that I will not <br/>
discuss/debate, it&#39;s not something I believe in completely and am not ready <br/>
to look at it openly and honestly. So sure, sometimes I get irked that <br/>
someone brought it to my attention before I got there myself, but I&#39;d rather <br/>
have it hard than not have it at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m certainly not trying to attack or direct this at anyone, I&#39;m trying very <br/>
hard to just pull from my own thoughts and experience and share.<br/>
