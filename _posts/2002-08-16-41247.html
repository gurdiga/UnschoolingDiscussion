<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811388211">So... I have filled out the papers to start unschooling my youngest who<br/>
is 11. My 19 year old is having a hard time with it. Basically he said<br/>
suffering the trauma of school has helped him grow.<br/>

I feel I need to talk to the 19 year old&#39;s feelings right now.  I went<br/>
to school, suffered for it, hated it, spent most of my time ditching and<br/>
in the darkroom.  Then went to art school, hated it dropped out, went<br/>
back, dropped out again.  Then to barber college, hated it, stopped for<br/>
a while to get ready for a photography show in Europe (ringing my own<br/>
bell here), did the show and went back and got my barber&#39;s license.<br/>
Worked for a while, moved to San Francisco, worked for a while, decided<br/>
that I was ready for &quot;real&quot; college, moved again and started college.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t do that well initially in college and it took me forever to<br/>
transfer from a junior college to a university.  I finally did transfer<br/>
to one in Northern CA.  Loved it there, loved my core classes.  Finally<br/>
finished with my degree in Anthropology.<br/>
Then I moved to Albuquerque for a year.  I holed up for that year.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t work, I watched tv, rode my bike, ran, read, and in general<br/>
de-schooled myself.  It&#39;s taken me 8 years to learn that that&#39;s what I<br/>
spent that year off doing: repairing my school damaged self.  I come<br/>
from an academically overachieving family - many PhD&#39;s, many teachers,<br/>
many physicians, etc...  I&#39;m the only one with &quot;just&quot; a BA.  They never<br/>
understood what I was doing, only my mother got it (she&#39;s our staunchest<br/>
supporter for unschooling).<br/>
The point is, maybe he needs some time even at this age to repair his<br/>
school damaged self.  I was 27 when I finally got it and stopped<br/>
schooling.  It&#39;s important to do at any age.  My mom provided me with a<br/>
safe space to be in while I de-schooled, perhaps you could do the same<br/>
for your son, he sounds like he needs it.<br/>
Sorry to sound preachy (I get accused of that occasionally) but this is<br/>
a subject close to my heart.  The time I spent deschooling transformed<br/>
me.  Isn&#39;t that lucky for my children!<br/>
