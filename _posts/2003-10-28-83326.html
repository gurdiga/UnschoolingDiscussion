 </span></blockquote>Not booked me flights yet but the latest I can leave is Dec 30th. We&#39;ve <br/>
found a rented house back home and will be paying for it from Nov 15th <br/>
so I can go any time after that. I&#39;m justa bit reluctant to set a final <br/>
date cos DH doesn&#39;t have his Brit security clearance yet plus I&#39;m still <br/>
in two minds about whether to spend Xmas in an empty furnitureless house <br/>
without DH in the UK or with him here but flying later in pregnancy.<br/>
I wish he&#39;d get that clearance before I left though! They are waiting <br/>
for the police report from America to show he&#39;s not committed any crime <br/>
here. They US is being slooooooooooooow on this. Sigh.<br/>
I really don&#39;t want to move back, pay for the shipping and then find out <br/>
DH doesn&#39;t get his clearance. It will then be too late for me to fly <br/>
back until after the baby is born then I&#39;d have to get an immigrant visa <br/>
which can take 6 months for the babe. Plus work out whether I&#39;d stay in <br/>
the UK or return to the US.<br/>
Aaaaarrrrrrggggggggghhhhhh<br/>
But, fingers crossed it all goes to plan. I will stay on list apart from <br/>
that 4 weeks when my computer is on a ship. And I&#39;ll certainly tell <br/>
stories, after I&#39;ve entertained all my English friends with stories of <br/>
the funny ways of yanks ;-)<br/>
