<div id="ygrps-yiv-203204477">First of all I feel as though got slammed the very moment I <br/>
opened my mouth here. You have no idea how I taught or helped to <br/>
educate or how I lent a hand in my childrens learning or how it&#39;s <br/>
going now. <br/>
   Yes for pete&#39;s sake I did teach my kids to read and you know what <br/>
they wanted to. HA! No tears no screaming no hair pulling just fun. <br/>
It&#39;s called spending time with your kids. As for how I taught my <br/>
kids to read here&#39;s the secret.... I read and read and read and read <br/>
and read and read and so on to them from the time they were babies. <br/>
Guess what I also did, I made it fun! I made and the characters have <br/>
voices and I gave each noise and funny sound. It&#39;s not hard to <br/>
interest and child into reading if you make it fun and not boring.<br/>
    After my kids were about 3-4 years of age they wanted to be <br/>
included in the fun and wanted to know how I did it. So I told them <br/>
the marks on the page are letters and these letters make sounds and <br/>
these sounds make words and all of these words make stories. So <br/>
that&#39;s it.<br/>
  So what! My kids begged to read and they read like no ones <br/>
bussiness. My 2 oldest daughters will read and reread a book until <br/>
they the book falls apart. My 10 yr. daughter begs to go to the <br/>
library. So you tell me once again what I did that was so wrong.<br/>
  About the testing in my state... The superintedent does know where <br/>
I live she knows the ages & names of my kids and they do keep track <br/>
of what grade your child was in. If your child in my state repeats a <br/>
grade more than once you will be questioned. No child in Arknasas <br/>
can ever be in a grade higher than 2 years beyound the grade that <br/>
they are suposed to be by their age.<br/>
   As for skipping the test. NO WAY! I will not do that because I <br/>
will not take a chance on loosing my kids to the system that I have <br/>
fought for years. I don&#39;t like the idea of them testing and each <br/>
year it makes me cringe every time it is time for them to test. But <br/>
there is no way I will not submit to the law because it&#39;s the law <br/>
that will take my kids if I don&#39;t. <br/>
   Maybe you all don&#39;t live in this state or maybe you haven&#39;t been <br/>
caught up with and are skipping these testing but the fact is I will <br/>
have to let them test my kids. If my daughter wants to take the test <br/>
that&#39;s her bussiness I wont be in there to have a say either way. If <br/>
she just sits there and makes a pretty picture that will be her call <br/>
not mine.  But to talk to my child for 5 minutes you will be able to <br/>
tell she knows who she is and what she thinks about this world at <br/>
such a young age she a very smart person smarter than mot adults <br/>
with a higher education. <br/>
   As for me teaching or helping my kids to read. Yep I did it! And <br/>
you know what I have helped others too learn to read. Reading is a <br/>
key that every child should get and calling unschooling because you <br/>
are not teaching your children to read at what ever age is no one&#39;s <br/>
business but yours or is it. It&#39;s not my right to question you <br/>
because your child is different than mine or your parenting <br/>
standards are different than mine. I frankly don&#39;t care if you sit <br/>
on the couch all day and watch TV, its your business not mine. My <br/>
only thought is what about the kids. I frankly want to give my <br/>
children everything and the keys are in our hands as thier parents <br/>
whether we are thier teachers, parents, or what ever you call your <br/>
self.<br/>

No one said different.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  So what! My kids begged to read and they read like no ones <br/>

they the book falls apart. My 10 yr. daughter begs to go to the <br/>

<br/>
No one said that either.<br/>
<br/>
The point I was trying to make is that no child can read before he or she is <br/>
able to read.  Many children cannot read as early as yours did.  Yours <br/>
couldn&#39;t have learned that early had they been kids who needed more years to <br/>
mature to that point. <br/>
<br/>
On an unschooling list, pressing the idea that you taught your children to <br/>
read &quot;early&quot; is not the norm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; You have no idea how I taught or helped to <br/>
educate or how I lent a hand in my childrens learning or how it&#39;s <br/>
going now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  That&#39;s why I asked if you were now unschooling.  Because what you <br/>
described wasn&#39;t unschooling.  But you did post on an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No tears no screaming no hair pulling just fun. <br/>
It&#39;s called spending time with your kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a suggestion here that you think I or someone isn&#39;t <br/>
spending time with kids?  Maybe you didn&#39;t mean that.   There aren&#39;t tears or <br/>
screaming or hair pulling going on at any unschoolers&#39; houses I know of.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No child in Arknasas <br/>
can ever be in a grade higher than 2 years beyound the grade that <br/>
they are suposed to be by their age.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not in school, because of perceived legal liabilities of having adolescents <br/>
with pre-adolescents.  That principle is common to many (maybe now all) <br/>
states.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; Reading is a <br/>
key that every child should get and calling unschooling because you <br/>
are not teaching your children to read at what ever age is no one&#39;s <br/>
business but yours or is it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
On an unschooling list where people voluntarily come to discuss unschooling, <br/>
it would quickly turn entirely non-productive if some or all of us started <br/>
saying &quot;NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS&quot; if others asked how our children learned this <br/>
or that.  Sharing doesn&#39;t go far in the face of refusal to share.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s not my right to question you <br/>
because your child is different than mine or your parenting <br/>
standards are different than mine. I frankly don&#39;t care if you sit <br/>
on the couch all day and watch TV, its your business not mine. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Are you on this list accidently?  Do you think there are parents here sitting <br/>
on the couch all day watching TV?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, but you see that isn&#39;t enough for a kid who isn&#39;t developmentally ready<br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a *really* important thing for anyone trying to unschool to understand<br/>
that learning to read isn&#39;t a matter of what we as parents do. It&#39;s a matter<br/>
of what *the kids* are ready for. (Though an environment where reading is<br/>
fun and useful and accessible to the child does need to be there.)<br/>
<br/>
If a child has an environment that encourages it, some will walk at 9 mos.<br/>
But no amount of encouragement will make a child who won&#39;t walk until 18 mos<br/>
walk earlier. (And if it did push it ahead, what would be the benefit to the<br/>
child? At 18 years will a late walker still be 9 months behind?)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with reading. I&#39;ve been reading to my daughter since she would<br/>
sit still for it. She recognized a good portion of the alphabet at 18 mos.<br/>
We&#39;ve played word games and talked about words. I&#39;ve answered her questions.<br/>
She&#39;s been writing since she was 5 or so -- *well* before she could read a<br/>
page in an easy reader. But it&#39;s only now at 11 that she will occasionaly<br/>
read for pleasure. (She will *listen* for pleasure for hours! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In *school* late reading is cause for worry for many reasons: 1) The<br/>
demoralization process starts as soon as some significant (to the child)<br/>
portion of the other kids can read and the child can&#39;t. 2) The schools can&#39;t<br/>
adequately continue to provide a reading environment (as poor as it is) for<br/>
older children. They have a curriculum they need to adhere to and big chunks<br/>
of reading time just don&#39;t fit in anymore. 3) Getting the information in the<br/>
curriculum into the child depends on the child being an independent reader<br/>
by 4th grade. Schools can&#39;t adequately accomodate a nonreader at that point<br/>
without special services. At that point the child has both a poor<br/>
environment for reading and a poor environment for learning.<br/>
<br/>
At *home* a later reader is just a child learning through other methods.<br/>
And, though school emphasizes reading as the far and away most important<br/>
gateway to learning, other ways are just as good. (And actually *better* for<br/>
kids who are more visual or auditory or kinesthetic or whatever learners.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And you know what I have helped others too learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>School is a *very* hard place to learn to read. Why *would* a child want to<br/>
learn to read books they don&#39;t want to read when they don&#39;t feel like<br/>
reading?<br/>
<br/>
I think the ones you&#39;ve helped are the ones who were ready to read but were<br/>
handicapped by their environment. They wouldn&#39;t have been asking questions<br/>
and been eager to learn if they didn&#39;t feel like they were right on the<br/>
brink and just needed a couple of missing keys! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t been seeing the kids who aren&#39;t ready to read. If they&#39;re older<br/>
than average for readers, they&#39;re probably already pretty good at hiding the<br/>
fact that they can&#39;t read. They certainly won&#39;t call attention to themselves<br/>
to ask for help on something they&#39;re sure they can&#39;t do or have been<br/>
convinced they can&#39;t do or decided is really dumb so why should they bother.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So you tell me once again what I did that was so wrong.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you did nothing wrong with your kids. :-) If there&#39;s a<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; it&#39;s in leading others to believe that what you did with your kids<br/>
is all that&#39;s necessary for any child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Reading is a key that every child should get<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They will. When they&#39;re ready. (Given an environment that allows them to.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not my right to question you<br/>
&gt; because your child is different than mine or your parenting<br/>
&gt; standards are different than mine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s the assumption that early readers are the result of good caring<br/>
involved parents (or good programs at school) that&#39;s harmful to parents and<br/>
to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As for skipping the test. NO WAY! I will not do that because I<br/>
&gt; will not take a chance on loosing my kids to the system that I have<br/>
&gt; fought for years. I don&#39;t like the idea of them testing and each<br/>
&gt; year it makes me cringe every time it is time for them to test. But<br/>
&gt; there is no way I will not submit to the law because it&#39;s the law<br/>
&gt; that will take my kids if I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like you&#39;re being controlled by your fears if you&#39;re doing things<br/>
you don&#39;t want to do. Information helps a *lot* with fears. Talk to others<br/>
in your state who *aren&#39;t* so fearful of the tests. Find out what they do.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to do what they do but it&#39;s helpful to know what they are<br/>
doing and what the consequences are. (And if you&#39;re signed onto HSLDA&#39;s<br/>
alerts, I&#39;d *seriously* think of signing off and finding more positive<br/>
groups who are not making money off of fear.)<br/>

<br/>
I never thought you got slammed, but I did see some of your statements get <br/>
discussed. After all, this is an unschooling discussion list. To lots of us <br/>
here, the idea of testing and grade levels and promoting the idea that a <br/>
child can and *should* be reading by age 5 are not the best roads to an <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Yes for pete&#39;s sake I did teach my kids to read and you know what<br/>
 </span></blockquote>they wanted to. HA! No tears no screaming no hair pulling just fun.<br/>
It&#39;s called spending time with your kids.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have no screaming or hair pulling here either. :o) If your kids were <br/>
asking for help in learning to read at age 5 then great! You were there for <br/>
them and gave them what they needed. Lots of kids are NOT asking for help at <br/>
age 5 though and that&#39;s great too. They&#39;re off doing and exploring other <br/>
learning besides the printed word. The problem is, that current popular <br/>
culture has parents believing that ALL children should be at a certain spot <br/>
&quot;on the road to reading&quot; at certain ages. Here in the unschooling world, we <br/>
reassure parents that there&#39;s no magic age for a child to read. Well, <br/>
actually the magic age would be when the child is ready to learn.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;As for skipping the test. NO WAY! I will not do that because I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>will not take a chance on loosing my kids to the system that I have<br/>

<br/>
Will Arkansas really take yur kids away if you find a way around the <br/>
testing? That seems pretty harsh and expensive for the state.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

I don&#39;t live in Arkansas anymore, but I was an unpaid lobbyist in the <br/>
legislature for a group who watches homeschooling issues.  I know the <br/>
law inside and out and I know 100 or more real, live homeschoolers in <br/>
Arkansas, some of whom follow the letter of the law, some who don&#39;t even <br/>
know the law exists.  I know what can be done in Arkansas and what IS <br/>
being done in Arkansas.  <br/>
<br/>
Your whole post is so defensive and I&#39;m ashamed to say, typical of many <br/>
of the homeschoolers I&#39;ve met there.  <br/>
<br/>
There are some parts of the state, developed and very close to Little <br/>
Rock, in fact, that still don&#39;t have local dial-up access to the <br/>
Internet.  Until that happens, there are still going to be a lot of <br/>
people who blindly follow.  <br/>
<br/>
Dang, I wish I could remember those quotes that were just posted about <br/>
duty to disobey bad law.<br/>

well get over 600 answers. (Or yoou may get ten or none!) There will likely<br/>
be a number of them that makes you angry.<br/>

I have found that unschooling really began to blossom when I eliminated<br/>
references to school - grade levels, learning expectations, the &quot;school<br/>
year&quot;, words like field trips, phonics, math (i say numbers).<br/>
Learning has become much more natural. It can&#39;t be helped. It happens. At<br/>
whatever age is right for the individual.<br/>
Unschooling is relaxing.<br/>

Is it true that you guys eat biscuits with a meal? heard and seen it <br/>
a lot where biscuits are dipped in gravy.  What sort of biscuits? Is <br/>
it more like bread?<br/>
