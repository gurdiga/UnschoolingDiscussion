<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138071806">We had friends over last night and we were talking about unschooling. They<br/>
are interested. My husband asked a question which none of us could answer<br/>
about homeschooling in general.<br/>
<br/>
My husband supports homeschooling but is concnerned with unschooling. So I<br/>
have been giving him things to read and keeping discussions open. He has<br/>
read alot of info pointing out why homeschooling and unschooling work. He<br/>
is looking for info that talks about why (public or private)schooling is<br/>
better. I cant find any, in my opinion because there is none and he thinks<br/>
there must be some.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we could come up with that is good about schooling is that<br/>
some schools have good equiptment for kids to learn on.<br/>
<br/>
SO does anyone know of any info or articles on why schooling is better and<br/>
does anyone else think there is any other positive to schooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909959080">We have gone through the same discussion and found no advantages to<br/>
schooling for an individual. Schooling is a way to educate large groups<br/>
freeing both parents to work. It would seem that it makes economical sense<br/>
to school but when one considers that schooled children do not get decent<br/>
education even that argument fails.<br/>
Having schools and state mandated curriculum also ensures to a certain<br/>
degree that there is a common base of knowledge within the society. I really<br/>
do not think that 12 years are needed for that.<br/>
No, I cannot find any advantages to schooling.<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;ll be able to find &quot;the sky is falling&quot; articles from professional <br/>
educators which badmouth homeschooling.  They&#39;ll be written by people who&#39;ve <br/>
never really known any homeschoolers.  It&#39;s an instinctive effort to defend <br/>
what they went to school and got a master&#39;s degree to be professionals in.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of money involved in schools, aside from just teachers wanting <br/>
to keep their salaries.  There&#39;s federal grant money, textbook publishing, <br/>
materials manufacture and sale, school bus manufacture, sales and driver <br/>
training and drivers&#39; salaries; there&#39;s the whole school cafeteria industry; <br/>
school library industry; substance-abuse education industry, and so on.   <br/>
People live in some really nice houses because of all that (and I&#39;m not <br/>
talking about the teachers, either) and they do NOT want someone saying &quot;We <br/>
do what we do for nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What money to unschoolers have to make if people nine states away take their <br/>
kids out of school and don&#39;t buy a curriculum?<br/>
<br/>
Another La Leche League analogy:  Formula companies have stock holders and <br/>
huge incomes.   People who nurse their babies and help others nurse theirs?  <br/>
They quit their jobs to do that.  What money do they have to publish and hire <br/>
lawyers to fight the big businesses?  Very, very little to none.  <br/>
<br/>
So you might point this out to your husband.  As all other things are NOT <br/>
being equal, the arguments he might find defending schools and reviling <br/>
homeschoolers will have that serious financial base and background.   <br/>
Homeschoolers are saying what they say simply because they believe it to be <br/>
true, not to make profit.<br/>

Not that I think you&#39;re wrong, Sandra, but I have been amazed at how many <br/>
publishers, etc., market to or at least acknowledge the hsing world.  On the <br/>
one hand it&#39;s sort of reassuring (&quot;so I&#39;m not totally crazy -- I&#39;m not the <br/>

other hand it&#39;s sort of a bummer (&quot;I&#39;m not the cool rebel I thought I was -- <br/>
thousands of moms and dads are doing this&quot;) and on the other hand sort of <br/>
scarry (how much &quot;help&quot; from publishers do I really want?).<br/>

<br/>
They didn&#39;t create the market, though.  And many of the suppliers of stuff <br/>
(books and games) are homeschooling families finding a way to support their <br/>
homeschooling habit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Back to my analgies du jour, there are people who made baby equipment and <br/>
books aimed at attachment parents.   And when I first joined the SCA, people <br/>
just HAD to make their own costumes and armor.  Now one with good credit or a <br/>
bunch of cash can mail order all that, and period pavilions, and books with <br/>
directions to make stuff, and the supplies...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another difference between a small town and big city.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583536530">&lt;&lt;I enjoyed this post tremendously.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I was surprised when I was first teaching to find that bus drivers and <br/>
janitors had more clout and were more in the know than the teachers were.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t surprise me now that I&#39;m older and wiser in the ways of business.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;We do what we do for nothing.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I meant by that &quot;nothing&quot; which was we don&#39;t spend a bunch of money on <br/>
what we&#39;re doing, and homeschoolers are helping other homeschoolers free of <br/>
charge.   I didn&#39;t mean &quot;for no result&quot; or fruitlessly.  Probably you all got <br/>
that, but in context it was particularly ambiguous.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, I believe strongly that unschoolers will change the <br/>
public schools without even a glance back their direction.  There are things <br/>
unschoolers believe that professional educators do not, like that kids can <br/>
learn to read on their own, and that if something is fascinating kids can&#39;t <br/>
help but absorb it.  The open classroom didn&#39;t work because kids were forced <br/>
to go.  Schoolhouse Rock worked, but it was so obviously separate and <br/>
*educational* that kids were kind of ashamed if they enjoyed it.   Animaniacs <br/>
and Histaria (sp?) are better at incorporating the educational stuff into the <br/>
entertaining stuff.   I think after a few more years of people successfully <br/>
unschooling, some researchers are going to pick up some data and anecdotal <br/>
evidence (perhaps some homeschooled researchers who started off defending <br/>
themselves and found a thesis in the making) and some of that &quot;news&quot; is going <br/>
to get back to educational theorists and philosophers who will get the public <br/>
schools on some whole new kick that will look a lot like some unschooling <br/>
we&#39;re already seeing.  That&#39;s my theory.<br/>

I wonder if there is enough data yet.  Homeschooling has only recently come <br/>
out of the crack pot idea stage.  Homeschoolers were the oddballs, so of <br/>
course homeschooling worked for them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when homeschoolers and homeschooling are compared to public schoolers, <br/>
public schoolers are used as the standard.  I don&#39;t think public schoolers <br/>
are the ideal model.  In fact it isn&#39;t all public schoolers that are held up <br/>
as the model, but the ones for whom public school works.<br/>
<br/>
It might be like if ice cream shops only sold vanilla.  But there were some <br/>
radicals who couldn&#39;t stomach vanilla so they went home and started cranking <br/>
out chocolate ice cream.  When people checked on the home-made stuff, it <br/>
would be clearly not vanilla.  But is it fair to compare it to vanilla or <br/>
should it be judge on it&#39;s own?<br/>
<br/>
Someone once asked homeschoolers to list the good points and bad points about <br/>
homeschooling.  She got a little upset when people pointed out that those who <br/>
could point out the bad parts about homeschooling wouldn&#39;t be hanging around <br/>
in the New to Homeschooling folder answering questions.  Their kids were <br/>
probably back in school.  She insisted there had to be some bad points.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing is that every family is unique.  There are things about <br/>
homeschooling that would probably make some people run far far away.  Yet <br/>
others wouldn&#39;t think twice about those same things.  Just because the <br/>
families are different.<br/>
<br/>
Asking if there is something better about schooling assumes all kids are the <br/>
same.  School can be a kid&#39;s only escape from a bad homelife.  For a future <br/>
politician, having peers at school to group and rally and herd might be <br/>
heaven.  School might be the only place a kid from a book-hating family gets <br/>
to see books.  A kid from a poor family with a lot of initiative might be <br/>
able to mine a school&#39;s resources for all they&#39;re worth.<br/>
<br/>
The methods that schools employ to teach kids encourage accepting a single <br/>
source as the final word, encourage looking towards experts for the answers, <br/>
encourage kids to not listen to their inner voices that question if something <br/>
is of value or not and accept that someone else knows better than they do.  <br/>
Some manage to ignore all that.  Some reject it.  Some get crushed by it.  <br/>
Most, I think, succumb to it on some level.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on at great length about peer groups but I&#39;ll spare you ;-).  <br/>
We&#39;ve come to accept kids in a room of 30 others of the same age under the <br/>
auspices of a (hopefully) benign dictator who has control over their bodily <br/>
functions (among other things) as the norm.  Some won&#39;t fit in, but that&#39;s <br/>
life.  Just as we all need to breath, but some have asthma.<br/>
<br/>
But when you step back and look at it objectively, if homeschooling were the <br/>
norm, and someone proposed taking 3 yos away from home and putting them in a <br/>
room with a bunch of other 3 yos and 1 teacher who , through no fault of her <br/>
own, won&#39;t love each child as much as his or her mother does and might <br/>
actually dislike some of them, would anyone think that was a good idea?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would help if you wrote down what kind of adult you want your <br/>
child to become.  Most of us would shrug off kind, helpful, happy, <br/>
self-directed etc. as either givens or a crapshoot or unrelated to school.  <br/>
But really everything should be taken into consideration.  Schools have a <br/>
fair percentage of kids they are able to force through 4 years of math, <br/>
science and English.  Personally, I think the peer pressure of schools has a <br/>
negative influence on kindness and a lot of other positive qualities.  Are <br/>
you willing to trade one for the other?<br/>

&gt;I wonder if there is enough data yet.  Homeschooling has only recently come<br/>
&gt;out of the crack pot idea stage.  Homeschoolers were the oddballs, so of<br/>
&gt;course homeschooling worked for them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, when homeschoolers and homeschooling are compared to public<br/>
 </span></blockquote>schoolers,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;public schoolers are used as the standard.  I don&#39;t think public schoolers<br/>
&gt;are the ideal model.  In fact it isn&#39;t all public schoolers that are held<br/>

&gt;would be clearly not vanilla.  But is it fair to compare it to vanilla or<br/>
&gt;should it be judge on it&#39;s own?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;homeschooling that would probably make some people run far far away.  Yet<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I could go on at great length about peer groups but I&#39;ll spare you ;-).<br/>
&gt;We&#39;ve come to accept kids in a room of 30 others of the same age under the<br/>
&gt;auspices of a (hopefully) benign dictator who has control over their bodily<br/>

&gt;Perhaps it would help if you wrote down what kind of adult you want your<br/>
&gt;child to become.  Most of us would shrug off kind, helpful, happy,<br/>
&gt;self-directed etc. as either givens or a crapshoot or unrelated to school.<br/>
&gt;But really everything should be taken into consideration.  Schools have a<br/>

Yup.  There are so many decisions about how children need to be educated <br/>
based on what we know about children and learning *in school*.  We have very <br/>
little data on how children learn naturally.<br/>
<br/>
Once unschooled kids become common enough not to be dismissed from the data <br/>
pool as kids who learn differently, whose abilities don&#39;t apply to &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
kids, then people are going to sit up and realize the things they&#39;ve always <br/>
assumed about how children learn may be wrong.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought I better come out of lurkdom to give my $.02 on this one.<br/>
As a brief intro - my name is Diane and I live in Kansas.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
married to Jeff for almost 21 years.  We have two children - a 19 <br/>
year old daughter - homeschooled since 15, but not unschooled at <br/>
first - now a part time college student and full time employee, <br/>
moving into her own apartment Thursday , AND a 13 year old son - <br/>
unschooled since he was 10.  He&#39;s the reason I write.  He wanted to <br/>
return to school last fall (7th grade) to see what middle school was <br/>
like.  He was concerned about his math skills because we hadn&#39;t <br/>
worked traditionally on math.  We began to work away, at his <br/>
suggestion, and yet it was less than thrilling for both of us.  To <br/>
make a long story short,  he returned for the first quarter - <br/>
reassured himself that he wasn&#39;t missing anything and  remembered how <br/>
boring and tedious the work was,  and how silly the rules.  They <br/>
placed him in a gifted math class and still spent over 2 weeks <br/>
explaining prime numbers.  I think that&#39;s when he gave up. He did <br/>
enjoy an Explorations in Technology class, but that was it.  He came <br/>
back home at Thanksgiving.  Our agreement was that he could come back <br/>
home whenever he wanted,  but he couldn&#39;t return to ps until the next year.<br/>
At this point he has no plans of ever returning.  He&#39;s a committed <br/>
unschooler - more so now because he came to this on his own.  I had <br/>
heard others say the same thing whose children returned to school briefly at <br/>
this age and it&#39;s really true.   We even consider his return part of <br/>
his unschooling adventure.  There was no discussion about wanting to <br/>
go/not go on a particular day because he always knew it was up to <br/>
him.  Homework - up to him.  We had discussed the fact that if he was <br/>
choosing to go to school,  he needed to be prepared to play the game <br/>
and jump through the hoops.  I never had to wake him up in the <br/>
morning, or remind him to finish work.  It was his choice/his <br/>
responsibility - so different from our earlier experience.  When he <br/>
came back home,  I thought he&#39;d deschool for awhile,  but the return to <br/>
healthy unschooling was almost immediate.  If he chooses to return <br/>
again,  I think we&#39;ll approach it the same way and then hold our <br/>
breath.  Even in the short time he was back,  we saw negative <br/>
attitude changes, so we were very relieved when he came back home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;ve missed a couple of responses to this...so if my comments are out <br/>
of context, I offer my apologies.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably in the minority here, but I&#39;ll forge ahead anyway.  I really <br/>
think we still need to have a public school system in this country.  For some <br/>
children and their families, it is the best option.  I have not problem with <br/>
a reasonable amount of my tax dollars supporting a public school system.  All <br/>
children need the opportunity for a quality education.  I don&#39;t think many <br/>
are getting that quality right now, but it&#39;s  baby with the bathwater thing.<br/>
<br/>
So, here&#39;s my take on the above question about trying public school on for <br/>
size.  Unless your gut screams that it&#39;s not a good idea for your family or <br/>
this child, go ahead and give it a go.  She may find that it is a good fit <br/>
for her.  She may return home post-haste and never want to enter that arena <br/>
again.  As long as it&#39;s right for her and your family, it works!  (OTOH, if <br/>
your gut screams NO! then you are the parent and have the ultimate <br/>
responsibility to make these decisions.)<br/>
<br/>
I truly don&#39;t believe there is only one right way to educate.  <br/>

&gt; Dear Friends,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I am new to this list, so this question may have been done to death<br/>
&gt; already!  I would be interested in knowing what your favorite unschooling<br/>
&gt; books and websites are.  Could you share some with me?  If it is<br/>
&gt; inappropriate to clog up the list with this information, you can e-mail me<br/>
&gt; privately.  Thanks so much!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165934521">Hi everyone!<br/>
I recently found that my local school system has classes on the<br/>
internet and they are 12 weeks long.  The kids get full credit for<br/>
each course and can legitimately grauduate high school in less<br/>
than two years.<br/>
My kids are 14 and 11 and we are thinking about letting them do<br/>
that.  I have them taking a freshmen pre-algebra course right now<br/>
to decide if this is something they really want to do.<br/>
My son thinks it would be cool to be in college at 14 years old. <br/>
What are all of your thoughts on this?  Is it a mistake?  I&#39;m<br/>
pretty new to this home-schooling and have been wavering back and<br/>
forth between home-schooling and un-schooling and have not found a<br/>
comfortable place to be yet and this just came to us a few weeks<br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
