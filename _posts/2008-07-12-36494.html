<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737298973">OK, I&#39;m trying my best to keep up with all of you, but am finding <br/>
that I just don&#39;t have as much time at this machine as it takes, <br/>
sometimes!  Good for you for being able to manage your time better <br/>
than I...or thanks for sharing your time with us now that your kids <br/>
are older and off doing their own thing!<br/>
<br/>
My hubby started blogging after LIFE is Good.  I was very please at <br/>
this, since there are few Dad&#39;s perspectives out there.  Jeff is in <br/>
Human Resources, so sees more people in a month than I do in a year.  <br/>
I think he gets asked about unschooling more than I do - and frankly <br/>
is more open to talking with people that have no idea what it&#39;s all <br/>
about.  Anyway, he wrote in his blog about some of the questions that <br/>
he comes across.  Here is the link to his response: <br/>

Hope you find this insightful.<br/>
