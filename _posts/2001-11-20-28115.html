<div id="ygrps-yiv-742173938">I don&#39;t agree.  If the guy was a doctor and he had the x-rays, then he knew<br/>
his diagnosis all along.  I&#39;d want to know if an autopsy was done and what<br/>
that determined to be the cause of death because the spot wasn&#39;t news to the<br/>
doctor.  If he had kept the x-rays, then he did it for a reason.  One cannot<br/>
know what his reasoning was, but he certainly knew about the spot and the<br/>
diagnosis 25 years before.<br/>

Deepak Chopra does these leaps and selective use of facts to fit the<br/>
scenario he wants to promote quite frequently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-88079662">Of course I have a way of knowing this unless Deepak Chopra is telling tall<br/>
tales!  According to your story, the x-rays were found in the doctors files.<br/>
The x-rays could only have come from a facility that takes x-rays.  X-rays<br/>
do not leave facilities without, at minimum, a &quot;wet read.&quot;  A formal written<br/>
report would follow.  All reports list &quot;findings&quot; and the findings in this<br/>
case would have defined the &quot;spot&quot; in the x-rays.  Thus, he had a diagnosis<br/>
25 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
X-rays do not belong to patients, they belong to the facility where they<br/>
were taken.  On a routine basis facilities send out requests to have x-rays<br/>
returned to them.  Obviously the doctor made a conscious choice to keep<br/>
these x-rays.<br/>
<br/>
So, actually it is pure conjecture on the part of ol&#39; Deepak Chopra that the<br/>
doctor didn&#39;t have the diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor had the x-rays, he knew the diagnosis.  Sorry if that messes up a<br/>
nice story for you but facts is facts.  Unless of course you are implying<br/>
that he wasn&#39;t a good enough physician to have determined that there was a<br/>
spot there by himself????<br/>

from 25 years ago were found in his files, &quot;Chopra was sorting through the<br/>

If the physician had the x-ray, then he knew what the diagnosis was.  For<br/>
whatever reason after having the x-ray taken he decided to keep it.<br/>
<br/>
If by the other facts you mean what do I base my statements on, I worked in<br/>
radiology for years.  Radiologists are MDs that have specialised in the<br/>
field of radiological diagnosis (reading x-rays, nuclear med, cat&#39;s, pet&#39;s,<br/>
MRIs, EEG, EKGs and ultrasound, etc.).  I also worked in the Health<br/>
Occupations Department of a college where rad techs were trained.  The<br/>
criteria, give or take a minor detail or two are the same in all 50 states<br/>
and most of the rest of the world (we had students from 107 countries).<br/>
<br/>
X-rays belong to the facility.  Patients, for a fee, can get copies.  All<br/>
x-rays are read.  Thus any x-ray that is taken would have a diagnosis which<br/>
the patient, particularly if the patient is a doctor, would know about, or<br/>
at least their physician would know about.<br/>
<br/>
It would have made a better story if it had been approached from the other<br/>
angle--see how the mind can cure/keep at bay a disease for 25 years.<br/>

little story support the thread?  The sentences that were used in support of<br/>
the theory don&#39;t work.  If there is more to the story, or any other &quot;facts,&quot;<br/>
not his unsupported anecdotel stories, then they should be used because the<br/>
supposed facts as stated don&#39;t support the theory.<br/>

And, as I said he is reknown for his leaps and shall we say rather<br/>
interesting &quot;medical&quot; theories.  We are talking about a man who advises<br/>
folks to scrape their tongues, spit in a cup of water and then wash their<br/>
eyes with it to cure their cataracts (which hasn&#39;t happened to date); that<br/>
meditation with levitation will cure your ills AND that it is supported by<br/>
quantum physics (it isn&#39;t).  The guy&#39;s a snake oil saleman.<br/>
