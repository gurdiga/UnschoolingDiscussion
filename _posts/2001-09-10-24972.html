Wow, Rachel, you&#39;ve been on a real tear.  So, I&#39;ll address your last post<br/>
that referred to me.<br/>
<br/>
When I posted &quot;I am continually being &quot;corrected,&quot;  told &quot;the&quot; acceptable<br/>
way to post and about how rude I am &lt;g&gt;  Not that it does anything but<br/>
remind me of  why I am unschooling instead of using the ps system &lt;g&gt;  You<br/>
asked &quot;How exactly is it that people telling you how rude you are correlate<br/>
to why you unschool??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To which I replied, and I&#39;ll include the whole replay because frequently<br/>
&#39;creative&quot; cut and paste has be known to be used here, &quot;&gt; Well, I am on my<br/>
way out to hook up the boat and decided that I would clear out the inbox so<br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be quite so full when we get back.<br/>

now, why would someone having a mutually agreeable conversation suddenly<br/>
tell the other party to the conversation that they were rude?  So why would<br/>
that remind me of ps and why I am unschooling?<br/>
