<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881864326">Okay, I have been poking around on Amazon and plan on getting a  <br/>
copy.  I just finished reading &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn and it poses  <br/>
some similar questions and thoughts I believe, although his book has  <br/>
more to do with all mankind and not so much the parent/child  <br/>
relationship.  Interesting stuff to think about.  Ishmael really   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765942311">I haven&#39;t read all of the book. I got maybe a couple of chapters into it before it just felt too awful for me to read. I am sure that Sandra is right, I am sure that she is talking about ideas that needed to be talked about. My problem was that she was treating the Yekwana in a racist way. She set them up as something better than human, something simpler and more natural than human. Somehow removed from all the evil and nastiness that the rest of us more complicated folk live in. Ray Hames, who worked with the Yekwana, has a wonderful site on them, or he used to, at his pages at UNL (ah, he does still have it <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unl.edu/rhames/)">http://www.unl.edu/rhames/)</a>. Actually, looking over at Ray&#39;s pages he has a recent paper on the noble savage idea as expressed in regards to sustainable development (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unl.edu/rhames/ms/savage-prepub.pdf&#92;)">http://www.unl.edu/rhames/ms/savage-prepub.pdf&#92;)</a>.  They are just folk. They have this horrible master/slave relationship with the Yananomo, they aren&#39;t always nice, they aren&#39;t more<br/>
 altruistic than anybody else. <br/>
<br/>
That was what kept me from reading the Continuum Concept. That was why when I bought it I added to my amazon order a book by an evolutionary ecologist. I suppose one of my other problems is that it sets up a real sense of dissatisfaction with the world we live in, a sense that another world, another life would be a better one. Or that we aren&#39;t as good as we could be if we lived a life more close to the life we had 10,000 years ago, before agriculture. But I love the internet, and I love the immediacy of my life. I love having pinto beans for dinner in the UK in the middle of winter. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520282439">Hi,<br/>
I expect I should be introducing myself, as I havent yet!<br/>
my name is melissa and I am mother to 7 children, 2 years thru 20--<br/>
dh is Lorenzo and weve been together since 1986.  I read the continuum concept when I <br/>
was 23, after having read The magical Child by Joseph chilton pearce while I was pregnant <br/>
with Lucia my dd1 in Japan.  <br/>
<br/>
These two books together sort of gave me a much needed braintwisting that had already <br/>
begun thru the travelings lorenzo and I were living...<br/>
<br/>
what I got the most from TCC was how children are in effect always learning.  And that <br/>
life can be coming from a joyful point of view.  That there can be this simple shift of <br/>
presence (interior) and the whole world looks differently.  Somehow, I did not come away <br/>
with this racist feeling but rather I had an idea that these people were just very accepting <br/>
of one another, non coercive *within their tribe* at least, and joyful.  Living life joyfully.<br/>
and that childrens right place is among adults, living life fully.  From birth.<br/>
<br/>
so this is how I made it so far and while I have made many mistakes and expect I will <br/>
continue to do so, I did a major learning curve reading that book.  It changed my life, I <br/>
expect and there fore changed the lives of my children.  and rereading it still can make me <br/>
think and expand.  <br/>
<br/>
this does not mean I find everything JL believes and writes to be gold.  I actually find some <br/>
things to be quite offputting, and non sensical--when one has had 7 children, one is <br/>
forced to open ones eyes, sooner or later.<br/>
Jl has not had any children.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, I really am enjoying this list.<br/>
I have never sent my childrne to preschool.  here in italy school starts in september of the <br/>
childs 6th year.  Dd1(20y) is finished with school, dd 2(17y) is in her 3rd year of <br/>
highschool (here there are 5 years) ...ds3(13.75y) is in 8thgrade and ds4 is 10yrs and in <br/>
5th. I only found out last fall that I could homeschool.  And dd5 (7yrs) is home <br/>
unschooling since December 2006.  I would like to have ds4 and ds4 home but  ds3 wants <br/>
to go, and ds4 vacilates back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
so here I am , one foot in and one foot out.  My personal parenting style is unschooling as <br/>
far as I can see...and yet we school.  thankfully here in italy school days are only half days <br/>
with one re entry per week.  My children can stay home when ever they like...and we never <br/>
fight about doing homework though unfortunately there is some stressing at times for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Right now things are smoother than a few months ago--ds3 has major upset that his <br/>
sister stays at home...hes moving into acceptance but for some time there he was really <br/>
making her pay for this.  <br/>
This causes me considerable pain at times, as I feel I have shoved a wedge in our home <br/>
that other wise was not there...well, really the wedge was there, it was in my dd5s heart--<br/>
she really suffered being in her little mountain school.  <br/>
anyway, its late and Im starting to ramble.  <br/>
hope tacking on my intro is ok. its hard to find time to write!<br/>

ps I dont remember this paart about kids not having &quot;kids stuff&quot; --the yequana children <br/>
had toys that led to their skills for adulthood yet they also had plenty of imaginary and <br/>
other play and I expect toys or games as well that were just for fun (other indigenous <br/>
cultures do)--though maybe to her western eye the sticks and stones may not have had <br/>
anymeaning...<br/>

I think it was not against toy versions of adult things, but of a  <br/>
separate kid of kid-world of stuff that was just for kids, and that  <br/>
kept kids separate.  I&#39;d have to look again, or maybe someone here  <br/>

  Yes, this is the book that started me on the path to natural/organic parenting and unschooling. I read it when I was pregnant, and it confirmed many of the ideas and feelings I had about parenting. It was a pivotal book for me.<br/>

  Hmm, I never thought of it that way before. <br/>
  It gave me what I needed to take &#39;natural&#39; parenting and integrate it into our lives in the modern world. I didn&#39;t feel any dissatisfaction with our &#39;modern&#39; life though after reading it. It was 14 years ago when I read it, so I think I&#39;d like to reread it and see what I get from it now. <br/>
  I have always read books in such a way that I take what applies and leave the rest. I guess it&#39;s editing as I read, or reading between the lines?<br/>

It&#39;s learning.  I think it&#39;s taking in those parts that fit with what  <br/>
you know and that amend it in desireable ways, and ignoring the parts  <br/>
that don&#39;t fit into the model of the universe you have in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
A young (irritating) friend of mine wrote recently that he is bored  <br/>
by most movies and only likes those that are profound.<br/>
Huh!<br/>
<br/>
If he can watch a movie and not have any profound thoughts, that&#39;s  <br/>
HIS problem!!<br/>
<br/>
There are some movies that intend to induce profound thoughts.<br/>
The Truman Show<br/>
Bedazzled<br/>
The Matrix<br/>
Last Action Hero<br/>
Groundhog Day<br/>
About a Boy<br/>
Juno<br/>
<br/>
But there are movies that, on the surface, seem just a story.  Yet  <br/>
someone might have their most epiphanous, illuminating moment EVER  <br/>
from something that seems kind of goofy or &quot;just for fun.&quot;    Movies  <br/>
that have done that for me lately are &quot;Idiocracy&quot; and &quot;Music and  <br/>
Lyrics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ditto all that with books.  If the reader gets a new, life-changing  <br/>
idea from a book it doesn&#39;t make any earthly difference whether that  <br/>
book was philosophy, porn, humor or all three in one.<br/>
