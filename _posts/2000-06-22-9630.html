<div id="ygrps-yiv-470316359">Hi Buzz ...<br/>
<br/>
ohhhhhhhhh, that makes me sad ... I can&#39;t imagine (even though I know it<br/>
happens all the time) anyone mistreating an animal ... maybe thats why your<br/>
*dal* is such a sweetheart, shes seen the worst of life and<br/>
KNOWS how good she&#39;s got it now!!!   ohhhhhhhhhhh, give her an extra treat<br/>
from her Aunt Pris :)<br/>
<br/>
about our sweeties, yes, bless their hearts both are hyper~hypos ... both<br/>
are AKC registered and from totally different breeders ... in fact,<br/>
Charlie&#39;s mother is/was an AKC show dog!!!   Charlie is 4yo and Dottie will<br/>
be 1yo on July 4th, so lots of PUPPY left in Ms. Dottie &lt;G&gt; ... we&#39;ve had<br/>
Charlie since 6 wks and inherited Dottie @ 7 mths from our dd and dsil who<br/>
should&#39;ve NEVER tried to raise such an active dog in an APARTMENT, for<br/>
goodness sakes!!!  {*ACK* what were they THINKING???}   both are extremely<br/>
smart and affectionate, just HYPER~dogs ... we&#39;re *still* working on<br/>
obedience training w/ the puppy which is very time consuming but necessary<br/>
... our vet recommended LOTS OF EXCERCISE for both this would help their<br/>
prob ...  both were altered b/c we didn&#39;t want 101 little dalmatianlets<br/>
running around our backyard (both were from litters of *12/14*!!! UGH!!!)<br/>
... our last dalmatian, Gladys, was as cool as a cucumber, except when the<br/>
GARBAGE MAN came down the alley and she literally just came UNGLUED!!!<br/>
sniff :::::::: we had to have her put to sleep after a stroke @ 16 yo and it<br/>
just broke our hearts ...  sniff :::::   our neighbors around the corner<br/>
have a HYPER~Dal, so, maybe it&#39;s just something &#39;bout those TEXAS DALLIES!!!<br/>
haha, I amuse myself!!!<br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve had a lab, two toy poodles, manchester doberman but personally, I&#39;ll<br/>
never have any other breed than a<br/>
Dalmatian ...<br/>

&gt; &gt; YES, granted we ALL have THOSE DAYS when we<br/>
&gt; &gt; (mom) want to run away from home but I&#39;ve found one thing that has<br/>
really<br/>
&gt; &gt; helped our fm *enormously* is getting outside *daily* to EXERCISE!!!  my<br/>
&gt; &gt; excuse is we *need* to walk the dogs @ the neighborhood track (both<br/>
&gt; &gt; Dalmatians are very *HIGH~STRUNG~HYPER~HYPOS*, bless their hearts)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pris ... I swear I must own the only laid back Dalmatian in history !<br/>
&gt; Just kidding we have a few in our neighbourhood but I&#39;ve yet to meet a<br/>
&gt; hyper one.<br/>
&gt; How old are your Dallies ?<br/>
&gt; Mine came as a recycling project .... I&#39;m not kidding we are either her<br/>
&gt; third or fourth owner and one former owner abused her and the last<br/>
&gt; owners neglected (she was an outside dog even in the foulest weather)<br/>
&gt; and kicked her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If any dog would be flaky and crazy :giving the breed a bad name, I<br/>
&gt; would have figured it would have been her.<br/>
