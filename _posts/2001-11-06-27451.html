<div id="ygrps-yiv-804023714">maybe you could buy the toy and remove the label before giving it to your <br/>
child.  My dd once had a lego set called Flower shop.  It was a pinks, <br/>
purples and light blues.  It was horrible when we first opened it because <br/>
everything was scented.  It smelled like an explosion at a perfume factory.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048543577">My son is angry that all the Powerpuff girls stuff is aimed only at girls.  He has little interest in regular toy stores, he says most of the &quot;boy toys&quot; are ugly, pointless or boring.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that toys are becoming more and more close-ended, that they are being designed so they can only be played with in a few ways.  That way, we now have to buy 4 or 5 toys to have the use of one, well-designed toy from 30 years ago.  I really noticed this with Fisher-Price toys.  My son was given the garage playset when he was 2, it was one of my favorite toys when I was a kid, but it had been redesigned so that only the accessories from Fisher-Price could be used to play with it, it wouldn&#39;t take hot wheels or toy trains, or any other toy that he had.  They removed all the handles from the cranks, and you have to use the little people that come with it to turn the cranks.  Once he lost the people, he didn&#39;t really care about playing with it.  It also broke when he sat on it, I used to use my garage as a step stool.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056394693">That is toooooo true!  We still have eldest son&#39;s hot wheels and micro<br/>
machines that we bought in the early 70s.  They have survived 2 girls and 4<br/>
boys plus lots of foster, &quot;adopted&quot; kids and grandchildren.  One of the<br/>
first ones we bought him looked like an oil can that opened up and became<br/>
something else and all kinds of neat things.  We bought an add-on for #5<br/>
child a couple of years ago and it fell apart a month or two after<br/>
Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
The same applies to things that use to be uni-sexed like the Legos, Tinker<br/>
Toys and Lincoln Logs.  Now almost all the Legos are aimed at boys with some<br/>
aimed at girls but the whole anyone with a creative mind can use them idea<br/>
has been lost in the pr/media blists to sell them.<br/>
<br/>
Even Tonka toys aren&#39;t the same quality.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, whose youngest (g, age 9) still plays with eldest son&#39;s Tonka dump<br/>
truck.<br/>
