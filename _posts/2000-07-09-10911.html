&lt;&lt; I look at all the websites and could not find a definitive answer as to<br/>
 what Sweet Balance is made from.  Can someone aim me in the right<br/>
 direction???<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi-- I&#39;ll copy from the brochure the information:  &quot;What is Sweet Balance?:  <br/>
A great tasting, all-natural sweetener made from real fruit.  As a low <br/>
glycemic sweetener, Sweet Balance is beneficial to almost any dietary <br/>
program.  It&#39;s safe for diabetics, children, pregnant and nursing mothers, <br/>
hypoglycemics, and anyone with special dietary restrictions.&quot;                   <br/>
                                                                &quot;Sweet <br/>
Balance is not a chemical sweetener or an herbal sweetener.  It is a natural, <br/>
fruit sweetener that is safe for use by anyone... Most people don&#39;t know <br/>
this, but Equal, Sweet &#39;n Low, Spoonable stevia, and stevia packets contain <br/>
high glycemic fattening ingredients... Sweet Balance is low glycemic.  It is <br/>
excellent for those concerned with hyperactivity, dyslexia, and tooth decay.&quot;   <br/>
                                                                                <br/>
&quot;The Glycemic Research Institute in Wash. DC has given Sweet Balance their <br/>
Seal of Approval. along with their special Pediatric Seal of Approval.&quot;         <br/>
                                                                        Hope <br/>
this helps!  :)  ~Karen</div>
