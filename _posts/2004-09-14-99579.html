<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076721811">Thanks everyone for the advice on the Gameboy vs. the Leapster. I have <br/>
decided to go with the Game Boy Advance SP (so I can play it too!). So <br/>
one more question? Or two... :)<br/>
<br/>
What are your small kids favorite Game Boy games (ages 4-6)<br/>
and<br/>
What are YOUR favorite games?!<br/>
<br/>
Is Super Mario World fun? I loved the original Mario in high school... <br/>
Can a 5 year old that can&#39;t yet read figure it out?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info!<br/>

<br/>
Spiro that my brother keeps stealing (LOL) and Wario Ware.<br/>
<br/>
I know he&#39;d like the new Hamtaro one too (it&#39;s some kind of hamster <br/>
olympics) but we didn&#39;t get it yet, so I don&#39;t know how good it is.<br/>
<br/>

require a lot of reading. The older kids also like anything Zelda.<br/>

That generally means the older hand helds will come down in price. And you<br/>
might be able to get a used on either at Game Stop or online at eBay or<br/>
Half.com.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to get the GameBoy Advance SP rather than the regular GameBoy<br/>
Advance. It has a much clearer screen that&#39;s easier for 2 people to see at<br/>
the same time and it&#39;s rechargeable.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage of the new system, the Nintendo DS, is that Animal Crossing is<br/>
being released for it. (Yeah!) The disadvantage is that its listed price is<br/>
currently $200. (Boo!) It&#39;s also backwardly compatible with all games for<br/>
the previous incarnations of the GameBoy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39935448">I just happen to have my 6 yr old DS here at work this morning and <br/>
he said his 3 favorites are Pokemon (but NOT Pokemon Pinball), he <br/>
has Crystal and Ruby, MarioKart, and Snood. So there you have it <br/>
right from the source.</div>
