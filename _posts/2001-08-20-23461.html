Indiana Tami<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A son and his father were walking on the mountains.<br/>
Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and <br/>
screams: &quot;AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!!!&quot;<br/>
To his surprise, he hears the voice repeating, somewhere in the <br/>
mountain:<br/>
&quot;AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!!!&quot;<br/>
Curious, he yells: &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br/>
He receives the answer: &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br/>
And then he screams to the mountain: &quot;I admire you!&quot;<br/>
The voice answers: &quot;I admire you!&quot;<br/>
Angered at the response, he screams: &quot;Coward!&quot;<br/>
He receives the answer: &quot;Coward!&quot;<br/>
He looks to his father and asks: &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br/>
The father smiles and says: &quot;My son, pay attention.&quot;<br/>
Again the man screams: &quot;You are a champion!&quot;<br/>
The voice answers: &quot;You are a champion!&quot;<br/>
The boy is surprised, but does not understand.<br/>
Then the father explains: &quot;People call this ECHO, but really this is <br/>
LIFE.<br/>
It gives you back everything you say or do.<br/>
Our life is simply a reflection of our actions.<br/>
If you want more love in the world, create more love in your heart.<br/>
If you want more competence in your team, improve your competence.<br/>
This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life;<br/>
Life will give you back everything you have given to it.&quot;<br/>
YOUR LIFE IS NOT A COINCIDENCE. IT&#39;S A REFLECTION OF YOU!&quot;<br/>
