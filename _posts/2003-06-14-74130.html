 </span></blockquote>Yes, that would be the acronym. There are many degrees though, so perhaps <br/>
your is very slight, it that is what you are experiencing. My jaws lock, <br/>
especially if having a migraine simultaneously. It also involves an extreme amount of <br/>
pain in the entire face. I once had my teeth cleaned and could not open my <br/>
mouth enough to put a spoon or fork in my mouth for nearly a year. Needless to <br/>
say, I don&#39;t get my teeth professionally cleaned anymore.<br/>
<br/>
But like all other things I have, there is always someone in far worse <br/>
condition than myself. We met a little boy, who was a younger brother to one of the <br/>
girls on the twins soccer teams, whose TMJS was so extreme, he had to wear a <br/>
halo, attached to his head and jaws by screws. It was absolutley heartbreaking, <br/>
but he was so full of life and so extremely happy. Especially when my DH <br/>
would let him &quot;work-out&quot; with the team. His mom was so grateful that not only did <br/>
we understand his condition and the risks, but that together we found an <br/>
outlet for him to experience the fun of soccer regardless of his limitations. When <br/>
it came time for team pictures, his mom cried when we asked that he be <br/>
included. As far as we were concerned he was a part of the team, since he worked out <br/>
just as hard as the girls did during practice. He became out little mascot. I <br/>
guess that&#39;s one occassion where I see Kass and Kree have learned to be <br/>
compassionate, not only because of my crap, but because they have so much to be <br/>
thankful for. <br/>
