 </span></blockquote>My almost 8yo ds was loud from birth, too. His colicky cries were literally <br/>
screams!! I thought I&#39;d go crazy!<br/>
<br/>
As he&#39;s grown I&#39;ve learned that he is just more emotionally extreme than my <br/>
other boys. He&#39;s either extatic or furious, and can change in an instant. <br/>
There is no simmering or cooling down period in his nature. Even his normal <br/>
speaking voice is LOUD. We&#39;ve had to remind him to speak quietly, and in a <br/>
few minutes he&#39;s yelling again.<br/>
<br/>
At least in some cases, I believe it is just nature.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967380041">We&#39;ve not had him professionally tested, but this has been suggested before. <br/>
When he was much smaller my mother said she wondered if his hearing was a <br/>
problem, so I tested him out at home. I&#39;d come into the room quietly and <br/>
whisper his name, or stand in the next room and speak softly to see if he <br/>
could hear me. The only time he&#39;s ever had a problem hearing me is if he&#39;s <br/>
engrossed in a TV program, then when I speak loud enough to break his <br/>
concentration, I get the &#39;huh?&#39; of one who just realized they were being <br/>
spoken to. Aside from the loudness, he has shown no other sign of hearing <br/>
problem. (no speech difficulties, etc.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was going to mention this in my last post, but if<br/>
they haven&#39;t noticed ds not hearing or<br/>
misunderstanding speech then it is probably not the<br/>
case (but certainly worth ruling out.) I did think of<br/>
it though because I&#39;ve been hearing impaired for about<br/>
10 years (a virus attacked the nerves in my ears - dr.<br/>
says it happens 1 time in about 100,000 virus cases,<br/>
can you believe that?!) anyway, since then I do know<br/>
I&#39;ve become louder (dr. says hearing aids don&#39;t<br/>
usually help if cause is nerve damage - plus I&#39;m not<br/>
bothered enough by it to want to use one.) But you can<br/>
tell I have a hearing problem because I sometimes give<br/>
inappropriate answers to questions (I don&#39;t really<br/>
hear the question, but brain tries to make sense out<br/>
of the sounds - so what I hear may not necessarily be<br/>
what was said. Sometimes the answers I give are<br/>
actually quite funny (even I think so when the<br/>
question is repeated.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174017175">Hubby is that way.  A clerk in a store once said to him, &quot;why are you<br/>
hollering at me?&quot;  He was mortified because he doesn&#39;t realise that he is<br/>
that loud and he was taking something back so the loud with the return came<br/>
off as hollering.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest kidlet is also that way.  We never have to &quot;look&quot; for her at the<br/>
park, we just listen for the loudest kid and follow the sound &lt;g&gt;<br/>
