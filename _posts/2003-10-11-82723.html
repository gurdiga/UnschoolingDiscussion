<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107331033">Hello everyone.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if intros are appropriate for this list, so if they&#39;re not, I<br/>
appologize in advance.  Anyway, my name is Shanna, and I joined this list to<br/>
get more information on unschooling as a possible educational alternative<br/>
for my daughter.  Leah will turn 3 this coming November, so it&#39;s probably a<br/>
bit early to start, but the whole idea of unschooling is very intriguing.<br/>
A little about myself, I live in Nebraska with my daughter Leah, husband<br/>
Mark, and various animals, including 3 dogs and Arabian horses.  DH is a<br/>
doctor, and I used to work as a guide dog instructor until a few months ago.<br/>
We moved back to Nebraska from California, so  I decided I&#39;d rather dedicate<br/>
my time to raising my daughter. Welll, I think that&#39;s enough from me right<br/>
now.  Sorry this post was so long.  Everyone take care.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779688487">Hi, Shanna-<br/>
<br/>
I mostly lurk here, but wanted to say Hi. My family moved from NE to CA 8 <br/>
years ago, and began homeschooling 5 years ago. Though I haven&#39;t spent a <br/>
lot of time looking at Nebraska homeschooling message boards, it seems to <br/>
me that Nebraska is solidly in the bible-belt where homeschoolers are <br/>
concerned, one reason that I&#39;d be reluctant to return there. We lived in <br/>
Omaha, and I remember that there seemed to be a church on nearly every <br/>
street corner, and new churches being constructed all the time. It was hard for <br/>
me to believe that the population could support so many churches.<br/>
<br/>
We live about a mile away from a Guide Dog facility here in CA, and most of <br/>
the dogs on our street are dogs that didn&#39;t make the final cut-- lots of labs and <br/>
retrievers.<br/>
<br/>
Take care-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322082135">Hi Ellen<br/>
I used to live in Omaha propper back when I lived with my parents, but that<br/>
was a few years ago! lol  NOw though I live outside of the city so I can<br/>
have my horses, and just because we like living in the country.  When you<br/>
talk about the bible belt, are you referring to the fundamentalist<br/>
Christians that were being discussed earlier?    What guide dog facility do<br/>
you live near?  I used to work for Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael,<br/>
Ca, which is near San Francisco. Just curious.  Anyway, I&#39;ll talk to you<br/>
later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254175692">Hi, Shanna-<br/>
I&#39;m not sure which thread about fundamentalist Christians you&#39;re referring to...I <br/>
don&#39;t keep up with all of the threads on all of the lists, so I can&#39;t comment on a <br/>
particular thread on this list. My comment came from my experience living in <br/>
Omaha, and the fact that there were so many churches, and therefore so <br/>
many church-going people to support those churches. I&#39;m guessing that with <br/>
so many regular church-goers, a larger proportion of the homeschoolers there <br/>
are homeschooling for religious reasons, but I may be wrong. While the <br/>
churches were obviously Christian, they weren&#39;t all of a fundamentalist bent.<br/>
<br/>
When we lived there, we had friends who were very involved in their church, <br/>
and had strong religious beliefs, though not what most people would consider <br/>
fundamentalist Christian. When I wrote to my friend to tell her about our <br/>
homeschooling decision, she commented that she&#39;d recently been at a local <br/>
teacher store and noticed a lot of Christian curriculum for sale, and wondered <br/>
what on earth learning about Jesus had to do with geography or <br/>
multiplication. <br/>
<br/>
As a secular homeschooler, I know that there is a perceptual divide between <br/>
those who homeschool for religious reasons and those who do not, and I <br/>
think  secular homeschoolers have a tendency to lump together those who <br/>
homeschool for religious reasons with those who are religious and also <br/>
homeschool. <br/>
<br/>
What guide dog facility do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you live near?  I used to work for Guide Dogs for the Blind in San Rafael,<br/>
&gt; Ca, which is near San Francisco. Just curious.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. That&#39;s the one. I&#39;m in Terra Linda. If you worked there, you might have <br/>
known my neighbor, Janice Peterson. I think she was, or may still be, on the <br/>
Board of Directors there??? Not sure. Her dog is named Mittens.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since I moved here I&#39;m continually amazed at the number of Nebraska <br/>
transplants. For a state with a relatively low population, I wouldn&#39;t expect to <br/>
find so many former Nebraskans here in Marin.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of things that I miss about the midwest.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s interesting.<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen religious-also-homeschooling people who seem never to have heard of <br/>
the homeschool-for-religious reasons &quot;Christian Homeschoolers&quot; defend them on <br/>
principle, and say &quot;We&#39;ll *I* am Christian and I&#39;m not that way, so you can&#39;t <br/>
generalize.&quot;<br/>

Hi Shanna!  I&#39;m in South Dakota ~ but at the other end of the state ~ Rapid <br/>
City.  I&#39;ve got a great group of homeschooling moms near Sioux Falls who I <br/>
correspond with daily; some from SF, two from Yankton, even a few who live in Iowa <br/>
and Minnesota.  We just got together on Monday in Vermillion (2 hours from <br/>
Omaha) ~ the next time I&#39;ll let you know and you can meet some of us & know <br/>
you&#39;re not alone!  (I know that feeling all too well around here!)<br/>
