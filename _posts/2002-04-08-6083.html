<br/>
&lt;&lt;Wow!  It&#39;s like 6 degrees of separation!  ...It was already so much <br/>
fun with<br/>
Jeanne, the VA director...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe I read this! I have been looking for Jeanne for two <br/>
years! I found her name somehow back in &#39;98 or &#39;99 as someone connected <br/>
with homeschool theater and we corresponded for awhile. Then my computer <br/>
crashed and I lost addresses and couldn&#39;t remember hers. No amount of <br/>
searching helped, since I didn&#39;t know her last name. I rememered YPT and <br/>
knew the general area (east coast), but couldn&#39;t find anything about <br/>
that either.<br/>
<br/>
Laurel, would you mention me to Jeanne and ask her if she&#39;d like to send <br/>
an e-mail sometime? (Susan --  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:strandbe@...">strandbe@...</a>) Thanks! I love <br/>
coincidences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773809114">I&#39;ve printed your message Susan, and I&#39;m giving it to Jeanne tomorrow<br/>
morning at rehearsal.  Also, I e-mailed Kathleen and she sent her<br/>
hello&#39;s back to Karen Tucker (do you go by Karen or Tuck?).  Said you<br/>
(Karen Tucker) were the kind of person she knew immediately she was<br/>
going to like - that you had no hidden agenda&#39;s.  Seems that everybody<br/>
loves everybody in our homeschool theatre groups!  VBG!<br/>
