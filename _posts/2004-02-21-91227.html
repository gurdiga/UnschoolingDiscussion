<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203040673">Oooooooo I am a bad mommy then...cause I am always harping about cleaning up messes! Ooops!<br/>
But my son leaves Cards everywhere - Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Yo cards! He&#39;s nine.<br/>
I cant stand a messy house, and so I am always trying to pick up!<br/>
I don&#39;t however pour out his many &quot;Science&quot; experiments... He likes to mix water with whatever and call it an invention (Air freshener, Bug killer ect...) He loves to watch water freeze in the freezer in different shaped containers. So I have several icy experiments in there right now.  <br/>

Not longterm, when the kids are little.  Sometimes for special occasions, and <br/>
maybe better as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; does the feeling of needing to have your house look<br/>
&quot;presentable&quot; - as I was raised - ever go away for those who have this<br/>

<br/>
I doubt you were raised in an unschooling house, and if the priority is <br/>
unschooling, and the children outrank the parental priorities of the grandparents <br/>
it makes it easier to be calm about it, I think.<br/>

<br/>
We generally tend towards entropy--my kids are 6, 5 and 3. Every few days or so we put stuff back with the other stuff it belongs with, and I run a vacuum. But even then there are lots of piles in different places, so it still looks cluttered. I&#39;ve been sick the past couple of days, and it&#39;s always really obvious when I get sick. All the little putting away that I do during the course of my day, like taking something that belongs where I&#39;m going with me, just doesn&#39;t get done. This is always a pretty good kick in the pants for dh. *eg*<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been on a painting kick the past few days--we missed their art class, so they did it at home.  I have paintings *everywhere*! We&#39;ll find some more wall space for their favorites and then send some batches to the grandparents. Mail some of the clutter! One mom&#39;s thousandth project is a grandmother&#39;s precious gift! At least when they live far away. <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is it possible to have a clean house when you unschool?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clean house? Definitely. Tidy house, depends on how anal one is and how much<br/>
time they want to put into it.<br/>
<br/>
My house is very clean. I work at it every day. The kids rooms are another<br/>
story. They are also clean but you would never think it by looking at them.<br/>
There is stuff everywhere on any given day. Once in awhile if I&#39;m having<br/>
problems walking to the beds and closet, I&#39;ll ask for some help in putting<br/>
things away. I do also like to vacuum in the bedrooms at least once a week.<br/>
<br/>
The playroom is pretty much left up to the kids as well. Although being that<br/>
they eat in there, I do ask to be able to vacuum more often. Crumbs on the<br/>
floor in FL is a no no. But I can also vacuum around stuff and just do spots<br/>
as needed. If someone is coming over, the kids usually straighten up so that<br/>
there is more room to play and mess up!!! There are days when nothing is on<br/>
the dining room table and then weeks where it&#39;s covered with paints, play<br/>
dough, creepy crawlers, etc. We hardly ever actually use the dining room<br/>
table to eat at unless it&#39;s an occasion. We have a kitchen table we can sit<br/>
at.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to me to have some organized space in the house. I could care<br/>
less what anyone else thinks, but I need that for me. So my bedroom isn&#39;t<br/>
for toys although it&#39;s more than inviting for kids. Also the living room.<br/>
The kids do puzzles and books there but nothing else. That&#39;s what the<br/>
bedrooms, playroom and my moms place is for.  &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So if it&#39;s not important to you, don&#39;t worry about what others do or think.<br/>
If it is important to you, make a compromise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Definitely possible to have a clean house, though you might always <br/>
have a certain amount of clutter and stuff about due to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I like FlyLady&#39;s idea of having each room be within 15 minutes of <br/>
clean. For me, that means if we pick up whatever projects and <br/>
playthings the kids have left out, the room is basically clean. So I <br/>
do a rotation on cleaning throughout the week so that on any given <br/>
day the bathrooms are cleaned and swiped, the floor has been <br/>
vacuumed/swept within the last couple of days, the dishes are clean <br/>
and put away and the counters and tables are clean, the linens and <br/>
towels are washed, etc. It takes much less time to keep things clean <br/>
than to get them clean once a certain amount of grime has hardened on <br/>
them, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the cleanliness though, we have some rooms in the house <br/>
that stay relatively neat, and some rooms that are more or less a <br/>
total disaster. The kids have their huge bedroom/bonus room and my <br/>
son has his Lego room, and the office - all these rooms generally <br/>
have stuff out in various stages of creation. The bathtubs often have <br/>
ongoing science experiments in them or paintings drying or whatever. <br/>
But the basic living areas - living room, kitchen, and dining room, <br/>
as well as our master bedroom - stay pretty decluttered of kid stuff. <br/>
Especially my bedroom, I have a basket for kids toys that somehow end <br/>
up in there - all the stuffed animals in my bed, the dress-up clothes <br/>
and swords on the floor, etc. When the basket is full, it goes back <br/>
to the kids&#39; room to be emptied. That way my room stays relatively <br/>
neat and peaceful looking every night when I go to bed. I like my <br/>
bedroom to be a sanctuary, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
My DH is totally spartan and a neat freak, I grew up in a totally <br/>
clutter-overtaken house that always felt claustrophobic to me. I <br/>
think what we&#39;ve come up with is a good compromise that allows some <br/>
of both - some neat areas, and plenty of room for kid clutter.<br/>
