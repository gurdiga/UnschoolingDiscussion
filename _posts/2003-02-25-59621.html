<div id="ygrps-yiv-110146395">Greetings! I couldn&#39;t help but notice that the store owner who didn&#39;t <br/>
like homeschoolers shares my name (Elissa) too! <br/>
I&#39;ve been homeschooling for well over 10 years, We&#39;ve got 4 boys and <br/>
two girls ages, &lt;almost 18&gt; to 8 months. I&#39;ve always been an <br/>
Unschooling wannabe, but it has only been in recent years that I&#39;ve <br/>
gone public with it! I have so far had a late reader,age 9, a 5 year <br/>
old reader, one who is just catching on at 10, one who sort of gets <br/>
it at 7, a 3 year old who thinks he knows and a cute baby girl who <br/>
eats books. The seriously cool thing is that all of them love books! <br/>
Reading out loud is our life. I do it , my husband does it, the older <br/>
children do it... The two oldest and I love sci-fi and fantasy and I <br/>
truly enjoy it when we all read the same book at about the same time. <br/>
The younger ones will learn in their own time!! I collect books as a <br/>
hobby, I am trying to write one, and I draw. My Oldest son <br/>
is &quot;Wilderness Man&quot;, his life is rock climbing and the outdoors, my <br/>
14 year old daughter is into horses and the next three boys are LEGO <br/>
maniacs. <br/>
    I often forgo &quot;field trips&quot; for many of the reasons the store <br/>
owner described! I prefer to do cool activities with just our family. <br/>
For a number of years we were members of a structured support group, <br/>
one of my best friends is the leader, I was roped into being the art <br/>
teacher, along with another unschooling mom (funny how artists are <br/>
unschoolers) and we got burned out. Anyway, I hated group field trips <br/>
as a child. I used to stay home those days and my mom took me to the <br/>
same place on the weekend. It wasn&#39;t very different as a <br/>
homeschooler. Too much confusion, not enough time to really enjoy the <br/>
trip, and I hate staying as a group. The group we belonged to adopted <br/>
a policy that children had to walk in straight lines by two&#39;s yuck! <br/>
But I understand why they did it! Being homeschoolers, we are not <br/>
taking time to teach our children &quot;groupthink&quot;.<br/>
    Incidentally, has anyone read The Pillars of Creation by Terry <br/>
Goodkind? It is a fantasy novel whose main character grows up <br/>
isolated from society because of danger. On T.G.&#39;s website someone <br/>
referred to her as a homeschooled kid who did not have a clue about <br/>
life! I am often shocked that people do not understand our lifestyle! <br/>
I probably shouldn&#39;t be, but I still am.   Have a great day!<br/>
