<div>&nbsp;Hello!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to write and say THANK-YOU for all 
the great answers to my questions about the home-schooling or unschooling y&#39;all 
do.&nbsp; I have been getting abit worried that maybe my &quot;technique&quot; of teaching 
wasn&#39;t helping my son but so far, everyone seems to have the same outlook on 
education as I do so now I no longer feel like such an outcast!&nbsp; :o)</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every couple of weeks over the past few months I 
would ask my son if he would like to go back to school and every time it would 
be &quot;NO WAY!&quot; and he told me that he liked the way we were doing things.&nbsp; 
Whatever happened to appeal to us, we made a &#39;lesson&#39; out of it and he didn&#39;t 
even realize that he was learning!&nbsp; To me, that&#39;s the best type 
anyway.&nbsp; LOL!</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ll see about a support group but so far, most of 
the home-schoolers that I&#39;ve ran into are thru a Christian&#39;s Group and that just 
isn&#39;t for our family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think I&#39;ll just keep doing what we&#39;ve been 
doing and hope that my son grows up to be a decent, kind, caring, honest, loving 
person.&nbsp; </div>
