<div id="ygrps-yiv-309060428"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   Some of us have unschooled for a long time and we<br/>
&gt; need to analyze where we&#39;ve been and where we&#39;re going.  The face of<br/>
&gt; homeschooling has changed more than once in the last 20 years and the<br/>
&gt; next 5<br/>
&gt; are going to see it change yet again.  Frankly, we now have some very<br/>
&gt; clear<br/>
&gt; insights that the rest of the culture should take a long hard look<br/>
&gt; at......is they&#39;ll sit still long enough.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I couldn&#39;t agree more. It seems to me that one of the major lessons we<br/>
as homeschooling parents have to share (especially those of us who were<br/>
not homeschooled ourselves) is that we have seen modern &quot;education&quot;<br/>
unmasked for what it really is.  And what I see is that modern schooling<br/>
is based on 3 (and only 3) great organizing principles, which all<br/>
children are required to operate on:<br/>
<br/>
1. They are to learn a content not of their own choosing.<br/>
2. They are to learn it on a timetable not of their own making.<br/>
3. Education consists of the transference of information from the head<br/>
of an adult assigned to &quot;teach&quot; to their own brains.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that everything else -- good teachers/bad teachers, good<br/>
schools/bad schools, strict discipline/loose discipline, old math/new<br/>
math, etc. etc. is but dross compared with theses three principles.<br/>
What I think has changed, however, is children may be finding fewer and<br/>
fewer opportunities in families and communities to live their lives<br/>
which are not organized around these principles.  Hence, we see more<br/>
passivity and, occasionally, more violence among children -- just<br/>
different ways of expressing powerlessness -- which is the inevitable<br/>
result of the three organizing principles.<br/>
<br/>
School systems know this, too, and the public mistrust that they are<br/>
breeding.  The solution they offer is micromanagement, stricter<br/>
organization so that children cannot fail but operate with the three<br/>
principles in mind.  It will fail -- but the cost in human creativity<br/>
is, and will continue to be, enormous.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts...<br/>
