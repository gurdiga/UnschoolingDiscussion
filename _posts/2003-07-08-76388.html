**Why do you think unschooling is better?**<br/>
<br/>
Why would you choose a building or campus when you can have the whole world?<br/>
Its at your fingertips if  you homeschool.  And if you make the next jump to<br/>
unschooling your resources are even more unlimited!<br/>
<br/>
This makes me think of exchanges I have with people when they hear that we<br/>
homeschool.   They nod their heads and think that I am &#39;sheltering&#39; my<br/>
children from all the evil in the world.  &lt;g&gt;  What a good mom I am....<br/>
<br/>
I try and explain that I took my children out of school so they can learn<br/>
and experience the wonderfulness that is in the world.  The world has so<br/>
much to offer, I don&#39;t want them missing out on any of it, being in a<br/>
classroom.  They&#39;ll ask me a few questions and I&#39;ll share with them a bit of<br/>
our days,,,movies/tv shows we watch,  books we&#39;ve read,  games we&#39;ve played,<br/>
discussions we&#39;ve had from those experiences.    Their opinion of me<br/>
diminishes quite a bit.   I&#39;m not a good mom any more.<br/>
<br/>
Its such a different way of looking at things,  isn&#39;t it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it should be called worldschooling instead of homeschooling.<br/>
(Worldlearers is even better but might be too much change for people to<br/>
grasp the difference!) Home seems smaller than school so it reinforces the<br/>
idea that we&#39;re limiting our children&#39;s lives. Worldschooling highlights the<br/>
fact that the schoolers are the ones who are confining their children to a<br/>
little building away from the world. ;-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love this Kelli. I feel like unschooling has saved me from myself! Life is<br/>
bigger and full of joy and colour again. I remember having this amazing<br/>
confidence as a young child. I could go and talk to anyone anywhere and make<br/>
friends. Somewhere along the way I lost that and I feel like I&#39;ve got it<br/>
back now. Hopefully my kids will never lose it!<br/>
