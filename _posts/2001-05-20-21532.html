<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816291336">*disclaimer: Kathy, I understand you said you didn&#39;t agree with everything<br/>
in the article, so I am picking on the good Dr., not you*<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I just spent the day with a bunch of relatives who said things like,<br/>
&quot;1st grade is the most important year&quot; and, &quot;We&#39;re going to pay her a dollar<br/>
a day over the summer if she does a 1/2 hour of writing&quot;, so maybe this<br/>
article annoyed me more than it usually would have :), but...this man<br/>
seriously stated that the ages of 3-6 serve the developmental purpose of<br/>
preparing children for school, that we should make sure our kids are the<br/>
same SIZE as the other children in their class, and that not sending your<br/>
kids to school deprives them of the stimualtion they need to mature!  He<br/>
also assumes that if the kids don&#39;t go to kindergarten, they&#39;ll be in<br/>
preschool anyway.  I&#39;m going to go bang my head against the wall for a<br/>
while.  Anybody want to pay me a dollar to do it?  ~Rue<br/>

I found this article interesting .... though of course I don&#39;t agree or<br/>
espouse everything that was said.  But, it is interesting to see that even<br/>
those contemplating sending their children to a traditional school setting<br/>
are considering the issues of &quot;school readiness&quot; and developmental<br/>
readiness.<br/>

thought hard about it and said it went away in abouth 2nd grade.  But she<br/>
didn&#39;t think that it had anything to do with how the schools teach or<br/>
anything................  (like it is so obvious)  They think we are total<br/>
nuts to home school.  Wait till they find out we unschool!  Actually, I<br/>
think I sent them a link to my web page but I never heard anything about it.<br/>
We are just the odd relatives in the family.  Ain&#39;t it great!!!  ;-)<br/>

Isn&#39;t that what Wonder Bread is for?<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, no, wait--that&#39;s stronger bodies twelve ways...)<br/>
<br/>
We claim not to believe in magic in this culture, but we have magical <br/>
talismans and sacrifices all around us.  &quot;I will play Bach and turn off the <br/>
TV so my children will be smarter.&quot;   &quot;We will not wear t-shirts or sleep on <br/>
sheets with commercial art on them.&quot;  &quot;I will not let my children watch R or <br/>
PG 13 rated movies, and therefore they will have no cause for video-induced <br/>
disturbance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...hardbound books instead of paperback.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...organic cola instead of Coke...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Magic talismans.<br/>
Wishful, hopeful juju instead of dealing directly with the child&#39;s ideas and <br/>
feelings, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
And people with kids in school?  All of the above plus:  <br/>
Strict bedtimes<br/>
homework hours and requirements<br/>
grade average requirements to qualify for sports and extracurricular <br/>
activities<br/>
commute in a European car instead of American to ensure safety<br/>
wear certain clothing to avoid distraction and to impress other kids and <br/>
teachers<br/>
<br/>
Many of people&#39;s everyday decisions and choices don&#39;t have to do with other <br/>
people directly, but with trying to guarantee a result or to affect the <br/>
unfolding of development.<br/>

&gt; What is this obsession with making kids smarter, anyway?  Why don&#39;t we try<br/>
&gt; to make them taller, so they can reach things?  Or, maybe if we get some<br/>
&gt; experts to do some studies, we can figure out how to make their toes grow<br/>
&gt; longer so they can use their feet as hands.  Seems a lot simpler (and<br/>
&gt; kinder) to take them as they are. ~Rue<br/>

We have told family that we homeschool, but I don&#39;t think  some of them<br/>
are ready for the idea of unschooling. What matters is that it works for<br/>
our child and us.<br/>
