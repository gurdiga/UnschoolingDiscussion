<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559448716">We use (and LOVE) Netflix.  www.netflix.com  That covers everything you <br/>
mentioned except the video games, but I&#39;ve heard that www.gamefly.com <br/>
was great for that.  HTH<br/>

<br/>
Not video games, but we&#39;ve used Netflix for quite a while (two years maybe? a <br/>
little less?).  It&#39;s only U.S., not Canada or otherwhere.   Here&#39;s  a dump of <br/>
a documentaries page that lists their subcategories of documentaris and has <br/>
their currently most popular rentals (of documentaries).   (I hope the <br/>
formatting isn&#39;t a big mess, but if it is maybe you can go to netflix.com and look.<br/>
