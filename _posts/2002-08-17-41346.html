I have always prayer as more of a benefit for me - than for God. Yes, he already knows what my needs are - but by praying, I find that I can quiet my mind - and get back to what really matters. I think it is much like meditation.  Have you ever tried praying about the neighbor who sends his kids to public school - becuase homeschooling looks too &quot;wierd&quot; to them? Or praying that somehow others that have power and control over our governement will see things in a different  light?   - It might be an interesting excercise....<br/>

I have heard that one point of prayer is to remind of just this very thing. A <br/>
sort of free therapy which puts things in perspective -- God&#39;s place and <br/>
ours.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389654084">I agree that prayer should not be begging.  God is omniscient and He <br/>
does already know all that we need.  Too often people treat prayer as <br/>
if it&#39;s some kind of magic potion.  If they just pray hard enough, <br/>
then maybe they will be able to change God&#39;s mind to do what they <br/>
think He should do.  <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of prayer is to allign our will with God&#39;s and to deepen <br/>
our relationship with Him.  So when something happens, we go to God, <br/>
talk to Him about it, tell Him how we feel.  Then we should tell Him <br/>
that we know He has it under control and that we trust Him to do what <br/>
is best.  <br/>
<br/>
People sometimes pray for good  weather.  What they should do is talk <br/>
to God about their plans and then ask Him to plan our day--weather <br/>
included--according to His will.  We might think that an event is <br/>
God&#39;s will and that it could only be His will for the weather to be <br/>
bright and sunny, but He might have better plans that can be best <br/>
accomplished through rain. <br/>
