Sorry for the delay, I&#39;m behind as usual.  We have been living in a VERY<br/>
rural area of VA for the last 3+ years, having moved here from the Charlotte<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up north of Charlotte when we were still able to have horses and my<br/>
grandfather had cows and a small farm, so I was somewhat prepared.  The ONLY<br/>
thing I&#39;ve not become accustomed to is how just going to the grocery store<br/>
or the library will consume your entire day.  We live about 20 minutes from<br/>
a very small town (1 grocery store) and about 40 minutes from a small city<br/>
so we drive a lot.<br/>
<br/>
It takes over an hour to get to a &quot;real&quot; city which is where we do shopping<br/>
other than Walmart/grocery stuff and where all our doctors are.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing I would recommend you think about before moving is to think<br/>
about the area you&#39;re moving to in terms of lifestyle.  I don&#39;t know a very<br/>
tactful way to say this, but it&#39;s very difficult being open-minded and<br/>
liberal living in a very conservative area.   As I&#39;m sure it would be for a<br/>
conservative family to move to a overtly liberal community.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of farmers here, but no organic farmers, no health food<br/>
stores or co-ops.  Everyone is &quot;categorized&quot; by the church they attend.<br/>
There is no &quot;sign-up&quot; day for little league, you call the coach & ask to be<br/>
on his team, so naturally there is always &quot;the best&quot; team.  And virtually<br/>
all of the homeschoolers are conservative, school-at-home Christians.  At<br/>
least in the city, or nearer to one, you can find more like-minded<br/>
people.....I am the only unschooler here.  Luckily I&#39;ve made a couple of<br/>
other more liberal friends, homeschoolers who are eclectic and open-minded,<br/>
but we are definitely in the minority.  And it&#39;s hard.<br/>
<br/>
Just something else to think about.....good luck with your move.<br/>

I&#39;m in Patrick County, not far from the NC border.  The small city I<br/>
mentioned is Martinsville, the small town is Stuart.  We&#39;re about 20 minutes<br/>
from the parkway.....where is Keysville?<br/>
