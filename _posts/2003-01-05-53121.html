<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957370943">I was reading Spider magazine with Jason yesterday and they had a reference to the words<br/>
&quot;you put the lime in the coconut&quot;. I remembered enough of the tune to sing this one <br/>
line and he thought that it was just hilarious. I really want to track down the whole<br/>
song for him.<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed when I typed &quot;lime in the coconut song&quot; into google and it pulled back pages<br/>
of hits LOL! I found out that it was written by Harry Nilsson and re-recorded by the<br/>
Baha Men for Reservoir Dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Now does anyone know if there is anywhere that I can *hear* this over the internet? <br/>
Jason would just absolutely love it I am sure...not sure if I should go out and buy <br/>
the cd just for this one song....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you have RealPlayer you can listen to a snippet at amazon.com.   <br/>
The Coconut was from Nilsson Schmilsson.<br/>
Sorry, I don&#39;t know where you could hear the whole song.   Did you try<br/>
calling your radio station?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow!  I can just hear that song in my head right now.  I&#39;ll be interested if<br/>
you actually find someplace you can listen to it.  If you found the exact<br/>
title, Lars could probably find it for me on KaaZa.<br/>
