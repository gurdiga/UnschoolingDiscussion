&gt;   ~Thomas Moore<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From what I know about Moore, he is saying that this is the soul&#39;s<br/>
response to our hierarchic culture.  I don&#39;t *think* he is defending<br/>
the hierarchy, but is stating the reality of the culture.  He is<br/>
saying that in this culture, being a child sucks, and even as we grow<br/>
into adulthood there are lots of people higher up on the totem pole<br/>
that are willing to take our power (the threat of &quot;eternal infancy and<br/>
childhood&quot;).  <br/>
<br/>
And so we invent school -- not just the real schools, but in a<br/>
metaphorical sense, too -- we buy into it.  (Not on this list, of<br/>
course.)  We use school to acquire &quot;technological sophistication&quot; and<br/>
prove ourselves as worthy of having power, of taking others&#39; power. <br/>
(Shades of Alice Miller, perhaps.)  We use it to overcome childhood,<br/>
because in this culture, childhood is humiliating.<br/>
<br/>
I get that meaning because of this line:  &quot;This is not a true<br/>
initiation that values both the previous form of existence and the<br/>
newly attained one.&quot;  The Thomas Moore that I&#39;ve read really<br/>
emphasizes valuing the complexity of any situation, of honoring all<br/>
the faces of the soul.  That&#39;s the line that clued me into what kind<br/>
of cultural criticism this is.  Otherwise, I agree that it&#39;s hard to<br/>
interpret out of context.<br/>
<br/>
In one of his books (Care of the Everyday Soul, perhaps?), Moore<br/>
considers homeschooling his young daughter, only to laugh at himself<br/>
and reject the idea because he feels that he would be trying to<br/>
protect her from the world, which is not what the soul needs.  I<br/>
wonder if he&#39;s changed his mind by now?  I wonder if he&#39;s realized<br/>
that her soul would have much better access to the real world outside<br/>
of school?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996963326">I have a hard time remembering on which list or forum I read things, but  <br/>
someone asked the other day why babies are valued and adults but not kids.<br/>
 <br/>
I have an idea.  Production.  Adults &quot;produce.&quot;  They  produce offspring, <br/>
food, shelter/clothing/transportation.   Infants  produce marriages, <br/>
stability/fidelity/responsibility in formerly-irresponsible  first-time parents (ideally, <br/>
anyway).<br/>
 <br/>
Children past infancy and pre-productive-adulthood don&#39;t produce.  <br/>
And our culture has extended their non-productive period incrementally  until <br/>
nowadays I think there are states (besides my own even) that require them  to <br/>
be in school until they graduate or are 18 years old.  And there are  many <br/>
places that won&#39;t hire anyone younger than 16 (and laws various places that  <br/>
make it difficult various ways anyway.   <br/>
 <br/>
And I think Joyce&#39;s writing on children AS a product (of school) is right  on <br/>
the mark too.  So maybe not only are children not productive, they are  the <br/>
products (and property) of various adult producers of children or students  or <br/>
performers or athletes.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t know about the Thomas Moore idea, but it reminded me of  having <br/>
thought of this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508183342">&lt;&lt;&lt;Children past infancy and pre-productive-adulthood don&#39;t produce.  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another take:<br/>
Children do produce. They produce for their schooled<br/>
parents/grandparents/teachers/neighbors/other children/etc., and from a<br/>
process of binging & purging, those coveted A&#39;s. But, like oil, those A&#39;s<br/>
are slippery and of limited supply, therefore only a very small fraction of<br/>
the children (like the slightly larger fraction of adults who hunt/gather<br/>
the big paying jobs) can be valued by the above schooled population at any<br/>
one point in time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day,<br/>

<br/>
This page includes a timeline style biography in which a couple of things<br/>
stand out, most particularly how his daughters kept dying very young after<br/>
illnesses or accidents, at the ages of 1, 5 and 11. Perhaps this would<br/>
explain partly his imagery about &quot;eternal infancy and childhood&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/Moore.html">http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/Moore.html</a><br/>
<br/>
However I would think that this idea would also partly stem from<br/>
contemporary Christianity, in which all humans are childlike in comparison<br/>
to the paternalist Church and God the Father, as well as his position as a<br/>
financially challenged Irishman. The Irish were viewed with paternalistic<br/>
condescension by the ruling British (&quot;humiliating reality&quot;). I notice that<br/>
he wrote much satire in reference to the British. However it is quite<br/>
clearly a &quot;hierarchical world&quot;. He was denied a college scholarship due to<br/>
being Catholic.<br/>
<br/>
He was a friend of Byron and the Romantic poets. Part of that philosophy is<br/>
about Nature and simplicity - the return to the primitive (or is primeval?)<br/>
the idea of the Noble Savage, the idea of children as more pure and close to<br/>
the Creator. It seems like it would certainly be anti &quot;technological<br/>
sophistication&quot;. (For another take on that idea Mary Shelley&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Frankenstein&quot; which she wrote after losing her child and having a<br/>
nightmare.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;We live in a hierarchical world in which we defend ourselves ....from <br/>
our eternal infancy and childhood by insisting on a graded, necessary <br/>
elevation through learning and technological sophistication out of the <br/>
child into the adult. This is not a true initiation that values both <br/>
the previous form of existence and the newly attained one; it is a <br/>
defence against the humiliating reality of the child.&quot;<br/>
  ~Thomas Moore&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
These are remarkably modern critiques, that infancy and childhood are<br/>
devalued, that learning must be measured against an external standard to be<br/>
valued, that learning is an &quot;upwards&quot; progression towards sophistication<br/>
with the end point being adulthood, that adults must perforce renounce what<br/>
is childlike (that there is nothing to be learnt *from* children).<br/>
<br/>
Need childhood be a humiliating state? I hope not for our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the brain workout! Most stimulating.<br/>

I was going to give my interpretation, but Amy said it so much better than  I <br/>
would have.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know anything about Thomas Moore, though.<br/>

  The quote is from Thomas Moore, writer of Care of the Soul. I saw this this morning but, didn&#39;t have time to write. And yes, the name is spelled the same.<br/>

Oh this is hilarious, although the one &quot;O&quot; guy is yet another - an<br/>
