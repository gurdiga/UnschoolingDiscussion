<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082833172">This morning my boys told me I was more like an angel than a mum. LOL<br/>
Jacob went on to explain that if he took all the love out of an angel and then took me apart and then put it all together, he would have me!<br/>
<br/>
They are the best! <br/>
<br/>
They are outside at the moment playing with their enormous dinosaur collection. They have enough to have a herd of herbivores for the carnivores to attack (which they do on a regular basis). <br/>
<br/>
They even have dead carcasses courtesy of our dog who chewed the heads and tails of a few he found lying around!<br/>
<br/>
I love unschooling! My kids LOVE unschooling! Thanks for the encouragement everyone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116076869">Julie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting that.  I certianly enjoyed hearing that through <br/>
all this craziness..LOL!  We had such a non-traditional day and I was <br/>
so happy being Mom to my boys today.  My 4 yo ds just played the <br/>
Harry Potter game for the first time without dad and from the <br/>
beginning!  He caught the snitch, even his dad (our video game stud <br/>
around here) could not do it!  He is showing more confidence lately <br/>
and we are so proud of him.  He would always say &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t know how&quot; and we were so frustrated in how to motivate him to <br/>
try.  I do not know if it is the unschooling, but I am truely <br/>
appreciating many more parts of my life!  Good grief I let the baby <br/>
nap til 8 and they just went to bed at 11!!  But that was what worked <br/>
today, and they are happy.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300439228">Okay, just had to share these two. My funnies from yesterday are:<br/>
<br/>
Mackenzie (6), describing a Batman action figure that has more elaborate<br/>
clothing than the others: &quot;Mom, this Batman has been upgraded. You know what<br/>
upgraded means, don&#39;t you mom?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And after (very reluctantly) leaving a pizza parlor with some new video<br/>
games he hadn&#39;t seen before: &quot;With me and video games, it&#39;s like I&#39;m a super<br/>
electro magnet, and the video games are like a giant refridgerator, I just<br/>
get sucked on and can&#39;t get away.&quot;<br/>
