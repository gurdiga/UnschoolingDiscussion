&gt; the conference last year. I&#39;d never driven through there before. I can only<br/>
&gt; imagine what it must be like _off_ the freeway and in the countryside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you drive along I-80/I-77 or I-26? Incredible through the Blue Ridge <br/>
Mountains (HILLS to those of you near the Rockies or the Alps, but quite <br/>
majestic here! &lt;G&gt;). We&#39;ll be less than 20 minutes from I-26 & I-40 and the <br/>
Blue Ridge Parkway. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Maybe it was last year when I was lurking more that you may have<br/>
&gt; mentioned not liking camping. I had my first time at cabin camping last<br/>
&gt; year. It&#39;s so much easier that tents. Haven&#39;t tried B&B yet. Any<br/>
&gt; suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve only run into one bad B&B through all our years staying in them. In <br/>
Memphis, TN during the big BBQ fest, &quot;Memphis in May&quot;. It was some ranch <br/>
house---maybe 45 years old in some suburb. Woman wanted $85/night to stay in <br/>
her away-at-college-son&#39;s room, complete with college banners on the walls! <br/>
We left in a huff and opted for an hotel! <br/>
<br/>
Other than that, we&#39;ve had REALLY good luck. We&#39;ve met some GREAT innkeepers, <br/>
and they&#39;ve always made us feel at home---and given us &quot;out-of-the-way&quot; <br/>
places to visit that we never would have found otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
We have done the cabin camping. I suck it up and smile. &lt;g&gt; It IS better than <br/>
tents.<br/>
<br/>
My idea of camping is a Motel 6!<br/>

    We came down I-77 out of Ohio. It was pretty much a straight shot.<br/>
Lovely drive. Even if we did leave at 6am. ;-) We&#39;ve been down I-75 many<br/>
times to travel to FL. The mountains down I-77 were just so beautiful.<br/>
    Where have you gotten your info for B&B places? I usually use AAA for<br/>
most of our travel. I haven&#39;t asked there but I&#39;m sure there are other<br/>
better places to get info.<br/>
    I was shocked when my db told me the cabin had AC and a TV. I just<br/>
couldn&#39;t fathom *camping* with those things. LOL!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Each state has a B&B organization---as well as some national ones. They <br/>
support each other. <br/>
<br/>
Google, google, google!<br/>
<br/>
We found this one on the web, but before we were this adept, we used the <br/>
Chamber of Commerce or a B&B travel guide (book or realliveperson). <br/>
<br/>
Books galore on B&Bs in different states and regions.<br/>
