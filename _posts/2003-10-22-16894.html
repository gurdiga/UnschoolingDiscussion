Breaking news on WLWT - Channel 5 Cincinnati (NBC) local evening news<br/>
has just released this breaking story about the alleged rape of a<br/>
freshman girl by two freshmen boys on campus at Woodward High School<br/>
in Cincinnati during school today. I mean, doesn&#39;t that prove that<br/>
public schools cause violent crime? Where are the cameras? Where is<br/>
Dan Rather? Where is the CBS Evening News team condemning public<br/>
schools for the crime they foster by compelling kids to be in<br/>
school? Feel free to send a copy of this link, this story, to Dan<br/>
Rather on CBS Evening News.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I wonder what would happen if everyone sent every story about<br/>
every crime, at least the ones that we hear about, that takes place<br/>
in our public schools to Dan Rather. Stories about every child <br/>
molesting teacher or coach, about every teacher who sends <br/>
pornographic photos of students out, every robbery, every weapon <br/>
confiscated, every child threatened or beaten or intimidated.  Do you <br/>
think he would see the light and stop drawing terribly flawed <br/>
conclusions in his news reporting? <br/>
<br/>
Remember, too, that these are schools which all tax-payers are<br/>
forced to support and which all children are forced by compulsory<br/>
attendance laws to attend, except for those rich enough to send their<br/>
kids to private or parochial schools, or those who have loving caring<br/>
and sacrificing parents who elect to school them at home. Do you<br/>
think Dan Rather would comprehend that his logic and his reporting on<br/>
the homeschool stories last week were convoluted? I wonder.<br/>
<br/>
And it is Dan Rather, by the way, who is still defending his bias in <br/>
reporting the two episodes of CBS Evening News last week. Maybe the <br/>
shows sponsors would like to read the stories about public school <br/>
crime?<br/>
