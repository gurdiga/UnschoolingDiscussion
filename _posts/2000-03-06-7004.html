<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211371798">My kids are close too....<br/>
I have three.. first and second are 21 months apart.  Middle and third<br/>
are 18 months apart.  I remember just laughing when told the third was<br/>
on her way.  I had an IUD, and just couldn&#39;t believe it.  I was pretty<br/>
stressed out, but time helped alot.<br/>
I too have a story to share...  it&#39;s kind of like the flour story.  I<br/>
remember coming into the kitchen to find my oldest, then 2 or so with<br/>
his whole face covered with chunky peanut butter!    Hysterical...!<br/>
Then there was the time the middle one was probably 1.5 and the oldest<br/>
2, and they discovered the oatmeal container, and had that all over the<br/>
kitchen floor.  They were having a blast.  Yes, I have pictures of both.<br/>
<br/>
Time has saved me.....    :)<br/>
Now my youngest is 3, middle 5, and oldest 7...Life is still crazy, but<br/>
much easier.<br/>
