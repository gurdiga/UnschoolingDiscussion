<br/>
I also lost a child in 1998 - our seventh, a precious boy named Joel.  He<br/>
lived for two months, from May to July.  I&#39;m sorry about your loss that<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
When I first took my three children from public school, I thought about only<br/>
taking the oldest out, as he was about to enter middle school.  My dh and I<br/>
decided that it would be a lot better for the family to take all three<br/>
children out at the same time.  This let us begin to live by family time, as<br/>
opposed to school times.  It also enabled us to do things together, enjoy<br/>
each other, and let the three of them get to really know their new baby<br/>
brother.  It seemed daunting - beginning to homeschool three children,<br/>
ages11, 9, and 8, with a six week old baby.  On the other hand, I told<br/>
friends and family that this way if the baby kept me up all night, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be up at 6 screaming at everyone to &quot;Hurry up, get dressed, eat<br/>
breakfast, find your homework, &#39;You need How much money, for What?&#39;, I need<br/>
to sign what?, Don&#39;t miss the bus cuz I&#39;m not driving you 20 miles to<br/>
school, etc...&quot;  Instead, we slept in if we felt like it (that first year as<br/>
late as 8 am sometimes - lol).  We relaxed.  We had fun together as a<br/>
family.  I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who wants a completely different<br/>
lifestyle than the hectic rush that public schools seem to force.  I&#39;d<br/>
definitely encourage you to keep both children together - I think you&#39;ll be<br/>
happier setting their &quot;schedules&quot; (or lack thereof) than to try and live by<br/>
the school schedule for one child and not for the other.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I haven&#39;t waited two weeks to jump in.  I hope that&#39;s okay.  More<br/>
about me later.<br/>
