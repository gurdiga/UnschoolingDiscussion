You could call when you think he&#39;s not there so you get his answering machine <br/>
and leave a message saying &quot;We&#39;re homeschooling so we don&#39;t need your <br/>
services anymore, but thanks.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry this person is upsetting oyu.  But, really, that&#39;s what they make <br/>
answering machines and caller ID for -- screen the heck out of everyone.  I <br/>
talk to noone! unless I want to.  Just because they call doesn&#39;t mean I have <br/>
to answer!  <br/>
<br/>
And if you do happen to be in the mood, it sounds like Sandra had the right <br/>
answer. &quot;We&#39;re hsing, get lost!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And good luck with your hsing!<br/>
<br/>
What else can we help you with?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068893072">In anything that has to do with pushy potentially harmful social<br/>
service/school type folks, send a certified letter informing him that you<br/>
are homeschooling and that you have already taken care of this matter with<br/>
the school and that you have met all your legal obligations and won&#39;t be<br/>
needing any further contact from him.  cc: to his supervisor.<br/>
<br/>
Talking on the phone is something that leaves no legal trail.  It is always<br/>
best to be safe with that type.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582756821">is it possible he does not realize your son is homeschooling this year? Do<br/>
you have to talk to him? If he is not court appointed and is attached to the<br/>
public school process, I would think you could politely inform him he is no<br/>
longer needed. You shouldn&#39;t have to give him any further information,<br/>
beyond having already registered.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462627269">Dear Lynn,<br/>
<br/>
Do everything in writing.  You do not need to justify anything to anybody.  I <br/>
am so sorry for the anguish you have been through.  You will all recover.  <br/>
You will get your son back and he will be OK with your love.  Don&#39;t let <br/>
yourself get upset about somebody you have no respect for.  Just walk away, <br/>
do what you need to do in writing, and know that you will repair any damage <br/>
done just by being your son&#39;s mother.<br/>
Mary</div>
