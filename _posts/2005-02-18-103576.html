Can we talk about &quot;scaffolding&quot; (as PamS sometimes has) as a technique for supporting learning in unschooling families?  I think I might be ready to &quot;get it&quot; now. &lt;g&gt;  I think before I was too much of a knee-jerk Rousseauvian and that interfered with my ability to really embrace the idea.  A little more scaffolding might be just what I need around here...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Now, I KNOW that my computer is sick, Really sick. Tax refund is due any day, and I&#39;ll get a new laptop and won&#39;t have to deal with all this sluggishness and missing junk and general difficulties...... but have I missed something COMPLETELY?<br/>
<br/>
Scaffolding? with  RE:[UD] in front of it? I must have missed a bunch of e-mails somewhere!<br/>
<br/>
I may have been asleep, but OH! Maybe at the CA conference? Scaffolding?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in what it is. And what it means and whatever...<br/>

And Betsy---if you&#39;re really ready to &#39;get it&#39;, you can come to the L&L conference: we&#39;ll work on you HARD! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585298741">Gosh - that was a discussion years ago and I&#39;ll have to dig to remember <br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I was reading something by Howard Gardner, at the time, and <br/>
he talked about scaffolding, and I brought it up online and Betsy and I <br/>
went round and round about it for a while.<br/>
<br/>
The main idea is that teachers and parents build culture-specific <br/>
social structures up around kids that help them lift themselves up as <br/>
they work on building their own skills and knowledge base. It has to do <br/>
with the kids constructing their own learning by alays building on what <br/>
they already know - but with the help of &quot;scaffolding&quot; so that they can <br/>
extend themselves - to do things that are otherwise JUST outside their <br/>
own reach.<br/>
<br/>
Scaffolding could be an adult there to talk things through with or to <br/>
offer to drive the kid to the hardware store or library or wherever. It <br/>
could be making sure they have the supplies they need. Lots of it would <br/>
most likely be conversation, transportation, and access to resouces. I <br/>
think it is the part of unschooling that gets sort of &quot;left out&quot; of the <br/>
definition when we say, &quot;We don&#39;t do school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We could say, &quot;We provide the scaffolding that supports our kids in <br/>
learning what they want to learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In schools, this is a big deal because the question of how you can <br/>
provide that &quot;scaffolding&quot; when you have one teacher and 30 kids - is <br/>
difficult to answer. But as unschoolers, &quot;scaffolding&quot; is what we do <br/>
when we say we &quot;support our kids&#39; interests.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Yup, Kelly, you fell asleep, and Pam and I decided to form a <br/>
window-washing business.  &lt;bweg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it&#39;s from Pam&#39;s talk last year at the Sacramento conference about <br/>
unschooling.  (The conference is not exclusively unschooling, but Pam&#39;s <br/>
talk was.)  I was listening to Pam&#39;s tape today.<br/>
<br/>
The topic was discussed on this, or a related list, but it was more than <br/>
three years ago.   I think it is too far back for me to pry it out of <br/>
the archives without spending an hour hitting the &quot;back&quot; button.  I was <br/>
hoping Pam would still have her ideas on this topic right on the tip of <br/>
her tongue.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m personally still struggling with the feeling that our unschooling <br/>
(at my house) isn&#39;t active enough and that I&#39;m coasting too much, and I <br/>
thought &quot;how we discover and support our children&#39;s interests&quot; would be <br/>
a fruitful topic.  (I have problems with both parts of that.) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still harping a bit on the theme that sometimes (on list) we talk <br/>
more about what not to do than we talk about what *to do*.  (Yeah, yeah, <br/>
I recognize that it varies from person to person.)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t feel so bad then.  I wasn&#39;t there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember discussing it by that name (scaffolding) years back or ever, but that&#39;s okay.  I understand the concept, I think.  I think of it as a nest, but then my &quot;nest&quot; involves my own mental model of what homeschooling should ultimately cover (which could be a scaffolding, concept/shapewise), which is an awareness that before they leave to live somewhere else, there are some things I&#39;m hoping they know.  And rather than wait, those things come along once in a while, and I&#39;m glad, and that&#39;s about it.  <br/>
<br/>
Things like what?<br/>
<br/>
How to address an envelope, how to use the post office; how to pump gasoline, how to take care of a bank account, how to operate appliances...  These are things anyone who moved here from another continent might need to learn.  What if the toilet tank keeps running?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The more academic things, they&#39;ve pretty much picked up easily here and there, and so while I&#39;m happy it happens, and while I look for opportunities to arise naturally, I don&#39;t plant them.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly was in here a minute ago to ask me about umbilical cords, and how babies poop.  We talked about blood and waste, and oxygen and blood, and I was scratching her back while we were talking, and used the example of a sore or a zit, and some of the waste/dirt/germ will be carried away inside the body by the blood at a cellular level, and some goes to the outside and goes away that way.  I said I hoped Marty&#39;s spider bite went away.   I was willing for the conversation to end at any moment, but I would have been as happy (and not lots happier) if it had gone on quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Holly asked about what&#39;s inside the palm of her hand.  Lots of muscles and tendons, but there&#39;s no &quot;palm bone,&quot; I said--finger bones go to the wrist.  Keith came by, who knows a lot about anatomy, so while he felt her hand and had her flex this and that and he told her in words what was there, I pulled up google&#39;s image function and found her some diagrams of hand anatomy.  The whole thing took less than ten minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I might not be talking about what Pam was talking about at all.<br/>
<br/>
I do worry sometimes about parents who don&#39;t have a model of the universe in their own imaginations/thoughts, but those parents are people who went to school, so that says something about school when they&#39;re lacking in confidence in their knowledge.  And I have worked with (and taken classes from) teachers who seemed to have NO spark, no curiosity, no creativity, they just had the ability to apply for a job, show their teaching credentials, show up to work everyday and do the bare minimum.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &quot;scaffolding&quot; would be that you two were there, willing to stop <br/>
what you were doing and talk, you both had some anatomy knowledge to <br/>
pass on, you knew how to use Google.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of scaffolding is just that it is mechanisms by which kids can <br/>
reach a little farther than they could have on their own. Holly could <br/>
have sat there and felt her own hand, flexed it, thought about it, but <br/>
in fact she has mechanisms already existing around her to support her <br/>
little bit of wondering about the anatomy of the hand.<br/>
<br/>
Scaffolding supports the kid who is doing their own learning - the <br/>
scaffolding doesn&#39;t DO it for them.<br/>
<br/>
There is a bunch of stuff on &quot;scaffolding&quot; in the education literature <br/>
- and lots of it is just junk (like lots of professional education <br/>
literature).<br/>
<br/>
I like the image though - I like that the scaffolding does something <br/>
important, but is still clearly not the active element in a <br/>
construction process. That&#39;s the role I see for unschooling parents - <br/>
important in the support sense, but not the builder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1771851562">scaffolding is the hot new term in education! <br/>
<br/>
today we watched a movie... an inspirational movie for the kids during <br/>
class, and another one for the teachers after school during planning <br/>
time.  I was thinking that probably some of the kids in both movies, at <br/>
least the actors, were homeschooled, and even if they weren&#39;t &quot;really&quot; <br/>
homeschooled, they were while on the set...<br/>
<br/>
it was a funny thought. <br/>
<br/>
The movie for kids was about bullies and how one person can make a <br/>
difference.  After hte movie  my class talked about it.  The kids all <br/>
said bullies are a part of life and you have to deal with it.  I tried <br/>
to explain that no, not really.  That people can create communities <br/>
where there is support and love, where if something unfair happens, <br/>
children deal with it in positive ways.  The kids dont&#39; see the world <br/>
like that.  sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-709650640">Not having read any of the literature on this...<br/>
<br/>
Scaffolding seems a terrific word picture in this context. It is a <br/>
framework, with some stability, providing places where one can &quot;hook&quot; <br/>
new ideas. It reminds me of the connections that Sandra talks about. <br/>
Teen Titans has a character who is a cyborg...well, you might have a <br/>
little bit of reading under your belt about advanced technology in <br/>
limb replacement. Which might hook up with the story about that man <br/>
whose arm got trapped under a boulder, and he survived by amputating <br/>
it and hiking out of the desert. He now has a high tech &quot;arm&quot; with a <br/>
pick feature, because he still climbs. <br/>
<br/>
in my mind&#39;s picture of &quot;scaffolding&quot; it&#39;s the older, more <br/>
established facts that you have in your mind, upon which you hook new <br/>
facts. It supports the new thoughts, but is mostly open.<br/>
<br/>
eh.<br/>
