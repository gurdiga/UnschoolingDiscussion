<div id="ygrps-yiv-822513731">I just called the hotel to see if I could extend my reservation to<br/>
Thursday and found that we&#39;re already registered for Thursday!<br/>
<br/>
So count me in for any great activities planned for Thursday night (or<br/>
at least let me know where dinner is!).<br/>

<br/>
    I called California Dreaming last night. It&#39;s family friendly. :-) We<br/>
won&#39;t have the private room (he said that it&#39;s been booked for a long time)<br/>
but they&#39;ll do their best seating us together. Dinner&#39;s at 6pm. I don&#39;t have<br/>
any idea how long it would take to walk 2 blocks. Depends on how big their<br/>
blocks are. I wouldn&#39;t think more than 1/2 hour. We could leave from the<br/>
lobby of the hotel at 5:30. We plan to walk unless it&#39;s a scorcher. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
    I couldn&#39;t get more than a recording for Hunter Gatherer so it may not<br/>
be kid friendly. With it being a Micro brewery it may not be. I plan to at<br/>
least stop in there to see if I&#39;m not too tired.<br/>
<br/>
    Here&#39;s the restaurants again. Stay safe and I&#39;ll see some of you<br/>
thursday evening. <br/>

I&#39;m going to go ahead and suggest California Dreaming which is two blocks<br/>
---and an easy walk---from the hotel (and easy drive, too). It&#39;s LARGE, so<br/>
it <br/>
would accomodate several families together easily. Many different menu<br/>
items. (I <br/>
usually get the Chicken Caesar Salad---it&#39;s HUGE.) Prices are<br/>
reasonable,---but call to make sure. Phone # 803 254 6767. I may be taking<br/>
the presenters <br/>
there too Thursday--or not. We&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the Hunter-Gatherer---a micro-brewery---GREAT homemade hummus.<br/>
ALso two blocks away---but it&#39;s much smaller, and you couldn&#39;t have one big<br/>
table. 803 748 0540---with live jazz on Thursday nights.<br/>
<br/>
Next door to H-G is Miyo&#39;s---a fresh Chinese restaurant---not &quot;cooked to<br/>
death&quot;. A little pricier. 803 779 6496<br/>
<br/>
Across the street: Sandy&#39;s hotdogs---ultra casual, but BIG hotdogs and ice<br/>
cream---maybe better for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Domino&#39;s, too, just behind the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Down the street is Immaculate Consumption---a sandwich shop. They also have<br/>
breakfast. Again, small and &quot;bohemian&quot;. Not for large groups.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Elissa, the Basil Pot closed last month! :-(((  Maybe you want to buy<br/>
it? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday&#39;s is in Five Points---very casual---downhome country. Pretty<br/>
cheap. <br/>
A little further to drive. 803 799 0196<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have a bunch more menus available when you get here--like last<br/>
year--but <br/>
this should get you started on Thursday.<br/>
