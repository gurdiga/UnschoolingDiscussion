sometimes without ever being boiled, even.<br/>
OK, here&#39;s one I DID DO, and NOT successfully at that!  Funny story (but be <br/>
FOREWARNED, its kind of disgusting too).<br/>
<br/>
Many years ago, when my DD was about 2 years old (no more than 3), my dad had <br/>
a boil that got infected.  He went to the ER, but they sent him home.  A few <br/>
days later, things started getting worse; he had developed gang-green (SP?).  <br/>
It really smelled.  He was pretty much confined to his bedroom, but would have <br/>
to occasionally go to the bathroom, spreading the smell throughout the house. <br/>
 IT WAS JUST GROSS!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the toothbrushes were in the bathroom, and I couldn&#39;t stand the <br/>
thought of using them.  So I BOILED them to get them &quot;disinfected.&quot;  UMMM, this <br/>
wasn&#39;t one of my brightest moments!  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter had this purple tooth brush at the time that smelled like <br/>
&quot;grape.&quot;  It was her all time favorite.  Well, to make a long story VERY SHORT, guess <br/>
who went shopping AT 1a for a purple toothbrush that smelled like &quot;grape&quot;?  <br/>
ALL OF THE BRISTLES IN ALL OF THE BRUSHES FELL OUT IN THE BOILING WATER.<br/>
<br/>
SO...MORAL OF THE STORY?  GO AND BUY A NEW TOOTH BRUSH!  DO NOT BOIL!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and BTW, after 2 surgeries, my dad is just fine.<br/>

do...there&#39;s a funky 2 yo that has fun tasting everyone&#39;s toothbrush and<br/>
leaving them everywhere :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399744063">If you don&#39;t boil them quite so long, you can soften them and bend them <br/>
into weird shapes. Kind of fun to try to brush with them that way &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
