Hello!  I mostly lurk here also, but thought I&#39;d respond.  I also have a <br/>
3yo that I&#39;m planning to unschool.  I think you raise a valid point, but <br/>
one that might not only be restricted to unschooling.  What if your <br/>
child&#39;s teacher didn&#39;t know about the Cuban missle crisis?  Or didn&#39;t <br/>
think it important enough to spend the requisite amount of time on? <br/>
Unlikely for a historical event like that, but possible.  To me, it just <br/>
points out the need for parents to always question their assumptions and <br/>
keep on learning.  Even if you &quot;miss&quot; this opportunity, it&#39;s likely that, <br/>
at some point, your child will hear someone discussing it, or read about <br/>
it in the news on an anniversary, and, it they&#39;re curious, they&#39;ll look it <br/>
up for themselves (Google is a great place to start)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241021476">hi tate,<br/>
<br/>
as a fellow mostly lurker, i&#39;d like to quickly address your concern just by saying that - you wouldn&#39;t believe the misinformation and lack of complete information that pass as the facts of a &quot;complete&quot; education in the school system!!!  <br/>
<br/>
so don&#39;t worry!  if you know you don&#39;t know everything, you&#39;re already ahead of the game!  admit you don&#39;t know, or aren&#39;t sure.  keep learning!  always question what you think you know; always keep learning! <br/>
<br/>
and the other thing is, that there are so many learning experiences that flit past you and your son everyday!!!  and yes, you will miss some.  but there will be so many.  it&#39;s not always possible to pursue each one.  but if there is real interest, the subject will come back, you can be sure.  and then you can pursue it further.<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t worry!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What happens, in practice, is that things like this come up that you don&#39;t <br/>
really know anything about, but the questions stick in your head and, <br/>
amazingly, an opportunity to learn more seems to pop up out of nowhere. <br/>
Unschooling parents just have to be open to those opportunities- be curious, <br/>
talk to people, read, watch movies, go to special events, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had (rather I had) the opportunity to show Moly how government works at <br/>
the people level tonight. Darin came home tonight with the announcement that <br/>
did I know that the Kansas primary is tomorrow? (Well, yes hon, I know. I&#39;m <br/>
not the apolitical one in the house!) And he wanted to know who I would be <br/>
voting for. So I told him who I had chosen as my pick for the race and why, <br/>
when Moly asked why I had to pick someone to race. So I started to explain to <br/>
her about primaries and how if you are Republican you vote for one person out <br/>
of two or three to be the person you want to run for Governor (or <br/>
president...) and the same goes for if you are a Democrat. She wanted to know <br/>
if you got to vote if you weren&#39;t Rep. or Dem. and I told her no, the <br/>
primaries are for the major parties, but then said I wasn&#39;t quite sure about <br/>
that one, so we would look it up. She wanted to know what party I was going <br/>
to. I explained about choosing a party and what the word party meant in this <br/>
context. She then wanted to know why I had to vote now for one guy and then <br/>
vote later in November for maybe him or maybe someone else. This one took me <br/>
awhile to explain, but she finally decided it sounded like the reality game <br/>
shows she has seen on TV, and I agreed.  We mainly watch our DSS system so <br/>
she hasn&#39;t seen the political adds and I read the local paper online and she <br/>
wanted to know how I decided who to vote for. So I took her to the computer <br/>
and we went to the candidates page at the paper online. I showed her who I <br/>
was voting for and explained why by reading to her his statements compared to <br/>
the other two gentlemen. I showed her that one of the candidates didn&#39;t give <br/>
much information, and how he is a Mayor of another city in the state and his <br/>
record hasn&#39;t been the greatest. I showed her how the third man was basically <br/>
uninformed on the issues, how he was very ridged and didn&#39;t come across as <br/>
being very willing to work with others. Then she wanted to know why I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to vote for the one woman gubernatorial candidate, and I explained that <br/>
she was a Democrat and since I registered as a Republican I had to choose a <br/>
Republican candidate to vote for. Then I explained that even though I had to <br/>
choose a Republican now, in November I could choose to vote for anyone and <br/>
would probably be voting for the woman candidate. Moly wanted to know how I <br/>
knew she would be a person to vote for in November so I explained how she was <br/>
the only Democratic candidate, so there would be no contest in the primary <br/>
for her. Moly said &quot;So she gets to pass go and collect her $200?&quot; (That&#39;s <br/>
what we say when someone gets a freebie in our house.) It surprised me that <br/>
she had such a good grasp on the idea. Then she wanted to know why, if I <br/>
wasn&#39;t planing to vote for the man I am voting for now in November, would I <br/>
vote for him now. So I explained how I still felt it was important for me to <br/>
help choose the best man for the race, how I believed that it was important <br/>
to have good people running for everyone to choose from later. <br/>
Moly seemed to have a good grasp on the voting process, she was interested <br/>
and I thought she asked really good questions. <br/>
This is why I feel unschooling works best. If I had a curriculum and the <br/>
lesson on government and voting had come up at some preselected time, she <br/>
might not have been as interested. The ideas wouldn&#39;t have had the impact <br/>
like they did since we were talking about it using real life examples in the <br/>
hear and now. So maybe we may or may not ever cover the Cuban Missile Crisis, <br/>
but I believe that we won&#39;t miss any *all important* issues because I see my <br/>
kids being inquisitive, energetic learners. They want to know things, they <br/>
want to be part of life. And that is why unschooling works. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731506293">would other styles of hsing solve that problem? personally,i doubt it.it&#39;s <br/>
the search for truth ultimately, isn&#39;t it! that&#39;s the journey we are all on, <br/>
and i think its ok for your kids to question your answers and learn to think <br/>
for themselves! nobody knows everything- including people who put learning <br/>
in a box and ask questions for you- so even with our fears and insecurities, <br/>
i believe YOU are the best facilitator(?) for your children<br/>

&gt;This is what scares me about Unschooling (quick re-intro: I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;researching h-schooling/ unschooling for my 3 yo� so I&#39;ve got 3 yrs<br/>
&gt;to decide!).  If my son had brought that up, I wouldn&#39;t know about<br/>
&gt;the missile crisis.  I just thought they were communists and there<br/>
&gt;was bad blood between their gvmt. and ours, and didn&#39;t really know<br/>
&gt;much more than that.  So I might have given a quick answer that was<br/>
&gt;mostly true, and then my son would have missed out on a learning<br/>
&gt;experience!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know that if he asks something like, &quot;what is a nebula&quot; or<br/>
&gt;a `quasar&#39; or some other thing that I know NOTHING about, we could go<br/>
&gt;to the library or get on line and find out.  But if it&#39;s something<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m misinformed about, or know very little about� what then?  Or I<br/>
&gt;just didn&#39;t know that there was SO MUCH more info. out there about a<br/>
&gt;certain subject.  That&#39;s when I fear that unschooling won&#39;t be enough<br/>
&gt;for my son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any comments on this?<br/>

When we parents say we don&#39;t know and then get intrigued enough to look it<br/>
up or figure it out or ask someone else -- *for ourselves* not because it&#39;s<br/>
good for the kids -- we send the message that 1) learning isn&#39;t just for<br/>
kids, it&#39;s forever, 2) we model how to go about finding out something we<br/>
don&#39;t know and 3) we let them know it&#39;s okay not to know something.<br/>

currently obsessed with dinosaurs and asked me to explain the difference <br/>
between a coelophysis and a corythosauras and did I know what a <br/>
rhamphorhynchus was? No, I sure didn&#39;t know but we got out his dinosaur books <br/>
and looked it up. I definitely know less about dinosaurs than he does so I <br/>
just need to learn how to help him find his answers and provide resources for <br/>
him.<br/>

<br/>
I really lucked out.<br/>
<br/>
My fourth grade teacher (still one of my favorite people in the world--we <br/>
visited her last fall, I introduced her to Holly, who was the same age I had <br/>
been when I was in that class) always said if we knew how to use a library we <br/>
knew how to find any information we would ever need.     And she used to <br/>
bring boxes of books from the state library in Santa Fe so we weren&#39;t limited <br/>
to the school&#39;s library (which wasn&#39;t really too bad, as it was a 1-9 school <br/>
at that time) and the little city library (very small).  She said after the <br/>
space age will be the information age.  I didn&#39;t know what that could <br/>
possibly mean.  I do now!  She said electronics would make a difference.  She <br/>
said we would be able to buy a calculator we could hold in our hands that <br/>
would run on batteries, and for less than $100.  That was 1964.  I thought <br/>
she was nuts!  But within about 15 years, I got a solar-powered calculator <br/>
free for subscribing to Newsweek.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in high school the alternatively-trained teachers were already <br/>
showing up in the schools.  They were on the same bent--nobody can know <br/>
everything there is to know, because information is coming along daily.  <br/>
Learn how to follow it.  Learn to be selective about sources and the media.  <br/>
Learn to be critical thinkers so you can discern good sources and evaluate <br/>
information on your own.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college I was mostly a hide-in-library English major, but I was <br/>
studying psychology too, and how learning works, and how language works.  The <br/>
teacher training classes I took for certification had to do with the rapidly <br/>
changing world and they said helping them learn to learn is the best thing <br/>
you can do.  When you say &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; show them how you find the answer, <br/>
and broaden their worlds beyond school and textbook information, because <br/>
those textbooks are probably five years old already anyway.  Get them using <br/>
the most recently published reference books available.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays all those people would be pointing  people toward the internet.<br/>

well as facts. A middle school textbook might cover<br/>
WHAT happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis, but<br/>
it&#39;s less likely that a middle school class would<br/>
discuss the motivations behind the actions of<br/>
Kruschev, Kennedy, and Castro, and it&#39;s even less<br/>
likely that they would discuss the ethical<br/>
implications, the fear and anger and other emotions of<br/>
the people involved, the after-effects and<br/>
long-standing embargos or the current relationship<br/>
between Cuba and the U.S., or how our current<br/>
government interacts with other nations. We had a<br/>
chance to discuss and read about of these things, some<br/>
more in-depth than others, and we both learned a lot.<br/>
<br/>
When my son was in school, he&#39;d bring books home to<br/>
study for tests. I&#39;d work on &quot;studying&quot; with him and<br/>
would often ask him questions like, &quot;Why do you think<br/>
that happened?&quot;, or &quot;Why do you think they did that?&quot;,<br/>
and almost invariably, my son&#39;s answer would be, &quot;We<br/>
don&#39;t need to know that, Mom. The stuff on the list is<br/>
what&#39;s on the test. Just ask me those things.&quot; He had<br/>
become pretty good at parroting back information, but,<br/>
except at home when we would discuss things at home,<br/>
he never really had the idea to THINK about what he<br/>
was &quot;learning&quot;, which sure makes it hard to make<br/>
connections between the factoids he learned in<br/>
science, social studies, and the other subjects. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s home now!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110199468">I&#39;m a pretty well-educated person, and some of my friends even tease me <br/>
about being a &quot;know-it-all&quot;  but my 12 year old always comes up with a <br/>
multitude of questions about things that I can&#39;t answer.  I know that I <br/>
don&#39;t have all the answers -- and I value his questions.  Sometimes the <br/>
questions come at times when I don&#39;t have access to reference tools  (in <br/>
the car, at the park, etc.) or when I don&#39;t have time to drop everything <br/>
and look it up.  So we have a question book -- it&#39;s just a composition <br/>
book that we write down the burning questions in.  When we first started <br/>
homeschooling, I felt I had to get *every* single question written down <br/>
and answered.  Then I realized that he didn&#39;t always want me to <br/>
perseverate on every single question until it was answered.  So now we <br/>
decide if the question needs to be written down or if we can just leave <br/>
it aside and if we remember to look it up later, we do.  If not, no big <br/>
whup.  Sometimes, I&#39;ll just suggest a resource where he might find the <br/>
answer.  As in, &quot;Gee honey, I don&#39;t know what the chemical composition <br/>
of the sun is, but you might be able to find out the answer by going to <br/>
the NASA website, or maybe by looking in the encyclopedia.&quot;  Later on, I <br/>
might say, &quot;You asked a really good question about the sun. Were you <br/>
able to find out the answer or did you want me to help you look into it <br/>
further?&quot;         <br/>
<br/>
To me, his being able to formulate questions and keep probing <br/>
demonstrates that he&#39;s thinking and learning. Sometimes a standard <br/>
answer is not appropriate to what he&#39;s looking for.  <br/>
