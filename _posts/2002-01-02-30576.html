<br/>
Thank you for the link and the suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that most westerners can change their diet significantly to feel <br/>
better, a diet that is ridden with fast foods, processed foods, I cannot <br/>
see how a &#39;one-size fits all&#39; diet would be the next progression after <br/>
everyone changed to a &#39;better&#39; way.<br/>
<br/>
Chronic symptoms can go away when a good diet is presented. The cause of <br/>
WHY the body presented symptoms will not.<br/>
<br/>
See some of Dr. Schimmels work on functional medicine:<br/>

<br/>
Also you may also want to look up some of the newer research that will <br/>
eventually land in the likes of people like Dr. McDouugall, just as the <br/>
diet change theorys should of been pushed by the medical community in the <br/>
50s, 60s, 70s & 80s.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Additionally, on a lesser degree of physics, McDougall&#39;s food would <br/>
probably fare well for some of the people, yet its full of yeast, and <br/>
wouldn&#39;t fare well for others.<br/>
<br/>
The use of vinegar in the no-oil dressings, the added yeast, could be <br/>
most harmful to many (See The Yeast Connection). Or worse yet, is most <br/>
people are strewn with <br/>
Mucor Racemosus and it feeds on yeast products. (Vinegars, nuts, dried <br/>
fruit etc)<br/>
<br/>
The closest thing I could find in english is:<br/>

<br/>
Essential fatty acid deficiencies are known to be genetically <br/>
pre-disposed. (see Professor Enderlein&#39;s findings). Yet, McDougall <br/>
dismisses the need for fish oils. Again, a one size fits all for a <br/>
culmination of cultures that can&#39;t fit in one size.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is &#39;vegetarian is always better&#39; doesn&#39;t have the facts to back <br/>
up the chronic illnesses of our society. A lot of the &#39;healthy&#39; soy <br/>
eaters I see in the organic stores have a grey-ish tint to their skin. A <br/>
fact of observation.<br/>
<br/>
Since I can go on and on and present facts contrary to the superficial, <br/>
symptom-reducing ones of McDougall, let me stop here at his recipes that <br/>
include microwaving.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure, as an MD, he would of been privvy to the study done by Bernard <br/>
H. Blanc, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and University, Institute <br/>
for Biochemistry and Hans U. Hertel, Environmental-Biological Reserach <br/>
and Consultation.<br/>
<br/>
This comparitive study about food prepared conventionally and in the <br/>
microwave oven measures the effects of microwave irradiated food on man - <br/>
as opposed to non-irradiated food - showing changes in the blood of <br/>
test-persons, indicative of an early pathogenic process, similar to the <br/>
actual start of cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Microwaved food caused significant changes in the blood of the <br/>
test-persons including a decrease of all hemoglobin values, increast of <br/>
the hematocrit, leukocytes and cholesterol values, especially the HDL and <br/>
LDL Lymphocytes. <br/>
<br/>
For a fact, I had a great-niece and a 2 nieces that are extremely <br/>
allergic to soy and soy products.<br/>
<br/>
One-size does not fit all.<br/>
<br/>
with kind regards,<br/>

ps: I haven&#39;t read Diet for a New America. But will make a point of <br/>
looking it up soon enough.</div>
