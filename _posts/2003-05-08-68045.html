<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470107462">&lt;&lt; I would unschool any kid with any learning style because that&#39;s what<br/>
  unschooling IS - creating the space for your kids to learn in whatever way<br/>
  they do.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Paula.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, I don&#39;t see that it matters what a child&#39;s &quot;learning style&quot; <br/>
is--that stuff seems best suited for teacher training.  If teachers are set <br/>
on read the chapter and answer the questions, and education professors can <br/>
convince them some kids don&#39;t learn well that way, maybe those teachers will <br/>
throw in some songs and games and something to touch and smell.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that unschooling families have never deprived any child of the <br/>
freedom and opportunity to use all their senses, to move or to sit, to talk <br/>
to themselves while they work or to look out the window, to work in short <br/>
bursts or to sit at one project for four hours.<br/>
<br/>
IF those opportunities are all present, it doesn&#39;t matter if a parent knows <br/>
what his child&#39;s learning style might be deemed to be by a professional <br/>
educator.  They&#39;ll learn more than one way anyway.  <br/>

My son&#39;s best friend clearly learns in an auditory way.  He asks questions<br/>
and needs to HEAR the answer.  He will ask repeated questions until the<br/>
answer sinks in.<br/>
<br/>
Kid makes me CRAZY!  He&#39;s a doll, but it can be very frustrating for me to<br/>
deal with his questions.  For the longest time I didn&#39;t understand *why* he<br/>
was always asking questions, frequently the same one over and over.<br/>

My son isn&#39;t like that.  He rarely if ever demonstrates that behavior.  When<br/>
he does its for a very different reason.  I had been reacting to his friend<br/>
based on a false, well not assumption, more like gut reaction to his<br/>
actions.<br/>

<br/>
If you JUST present information in a child&#39;s primary way, maybe he could have <br/>
learned more in a more three-dimensional way.  If you have an auditory kid, <br/>
do you just speak a recipe to him and not also offer the books for him to <br/>
read about that dish and its history?  If he&#39;d rather hear it that doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean he can&#39;t also benefit from the words or pictures.<br/>

If kids are learning from the real world, the real world is not divided into <br/>

present or facilitate the informational moment in a way that would fit her <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914383528">**If kids are learning from the real world, the real world is not<br/>
divided into <br/>
learning styles and it&#39;s pretty difficult to shut out the other senses. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I&#39;m on a rampage about learning styles is that<br/>
someone shared with this list a pompous column written by a teacher<br/>
about everything a trained teacher can provide to a student that us<br/>
pitiful, untrained parents can&#39;t (in the teacher&#39;s opinion).<br/>
  <br/>
Anyway, I didn&#39;t pull all my objections together and write to her, so<br/>
they are all crashing around in my head still.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most provocative claims that she made was that she had<br/>
&quot;training&quot; to teach to different learning styles while us homeschooling<br/>
moms don&#39;t.  That struck me as silly.  A classroom, with a little desk<br/>
that the child has to sit in almost all day, is such a limited way to<br/>
learn.  If you get a kinesthetic learner *out* of that awful desk, then<br/>
learning can be so much better.  Get kids out of a classroom and into a<br/>
wider world and they can be exposed to so much more!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop ranting, now, as I know it isn&#39;t very persuasive.<br/>

helpful--he<br/>
needs HIS way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Isn&#39;t helpful to you or to him?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In all fairness, yes, to me.  But ultimately to him as well.  Understanding<br/>
what he needed at that moment lowered my stress level in dealing with him.<br/>
THEN I was able to present the information that he wanted in the way he was<br/>
asking for it.<br/>
<br/>
The original question Sorcha asked was does our learning style affect how we<br/>
interact with our children.  I presented an example of where it did---my<br/>
assumptions about reading vs questioning to gain information were not<br/>
correct with this little boy.  Those assumptions are largely based on MY<br/>
learning style.  Understanding that there are other ways to get info helped<br/>
me help him.  And just plain made the afternoon more fun for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Those terms have to do with formal presentation of curriculum, not with<br/>
&gt;living openly in the real world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps they were coined for that purpose, but I find them useful in other<br/>
ways.  In this example it helps me when I react to a child who is requesting<br/>
information in a way that works for him.<br/>
<br/>
The point wasn&#39;t where the term came from but how I was using it.  If it&#39;s<br/>
ok to use a textbook if you use it to your own purposes, why isn&#39;t it ok to<br/>
use a definition that comes from &quot;school&quot; if you use it to apply to life?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This might help people who think I&#39;m babbling and not making any useful<br/>
&gt;point.  It&#39;s a little article called &quot;Disposable Checklists for Parents&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting and helpful article.  Let me quote it: &quot; Unschooling allows free<br/>
use of any and all bits of information, not just school&#39;s small set. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if this is true, than it should be reasonable to use school&#39;s set so long<br/>
as it is helpful and not restrictive.  So long as you don&#39;t put the learning<br/>
in a box, but apply it to real life.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s what I was doing.  Taking a definition and applying it to my<br/>
own reactions to a real living boy.<br/>
<br/>
I can see where I wasn&#39;t clear about what happened and that I was applying<br/>
things to just that moment and not some grand scheme of learning..  Of<br/>
course you present info in tons of ways, of course you present it in the way<br/>
it&#39;s requested.  But those terms helped me to do it in a way that made<br/>
everyone happier YESTERDAY.  I took something from a source and used it in<br/>
another application.  They were playing Zelda, for Gaia&#39;s sake.  -grin-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086707427">I think this proves the point that &quot;learning styles&quot; is about the &quot;teacher&quot;,<br/>
not the child.  This is what is so ideal about unschooling, the focus is on<br/>
the child and trusting their ability to learn.  I don&#39;t need to understand<br/>
&quot;why&quot; they are asking, or touching or staring off into space, not if I trust<br/>
them to learn.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, with different world views, are learning.  If I am focused on them<br/>
and available I will give them what they ask for.  I remind myself all the<br/>
time that if I&#39;m frustrated with them then I&#39;m probably trying to bend them<br/>
into doing and seeing things my way.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly.  When my kids ask questions I see it as a conversation, not a<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; moment.  If they are trying to understand a concept I don&#39;t just<br/>
talk at them, I have a conversation with them.  Because we are talking<br/>
together I know whether they are understanding or not.  Sometimes words are<br/>
enough, sometimes I draw a picture, pull out a book or look for info on the<br/>
internet.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it like ANY conversation?  If an adult friend isn&#39;t able to picture<br/>
what I&#39;m talking about I keep using different examples, pictures,<br/>

how to communicate with them.<br/>
I notice as they explore and play they are learning in ALL ways. Not <br/>
only in the way they are strong, but as they explore and grow, I see <br/>
them strengthening the places they are a bit weaker too. <br/>
So unschooling is all around, all encompassing learning. :-) <br/>

Hey, Kelly --<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my &quot;arguing style&quot; -- I&#39;m a laugher and a scoffer.  Just so you<br/>
know. &lt;G&gt;  I&#39;m only a &quot;scathing name-caller&quot; when really provoked. &lt;gg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**I was saying that it can be helpful THE OTHER WAY round.  If you have<br/>
a kid who is out there learning in his or her own way and you are having<br/>
conflict with it (for whatever reason--you need to deschool yourself<br/>
more, you have your own style which makes it tough, whatever) the styles<br/>
can help you relax and be with your kid better.**<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I get it.  (I was seeing it the other way &#39;round before.)<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling and accepting varied forms of learning can make one a better<br/>
unschooler.  Very true. I guess I was assuming that unschoolers had<br/>
reached a deschooled nirvana from the get go.&lt;g&gt;  Unschoolers who offer<br/>
a fairly diverse menu of stuff to their kids can be confident that their<br/>
kids will self-select things that suits themselves and their styles. <br/>
That was my hypothesis. <br/>
<br/>
My thinking was, if our kids are interested in lizards we get them<br/>
lizards and if our kids are interested in music we help them make music<br/>
and if our kids are interested in videos we get the kid videos.  No<br/>
unschooled &quot;visual learner&quot; is likely to be deprived of visual learning<br/>
experiences.  (Same for auditory and kinesthetic learners.)  Unless we<br/>
have a really tight budget and a severely stripped-down life, our kids<br/>
are going to have access to all kinds of stuff and all kinds of<br/>
experiences.  And most real life experiences, like taking a nature walk,<br/>
have visual, auditory and kinesthetic components. &lt;g&gt;  Now a worksheet<br/>
about kids taking a nature walk might not offer much to the auditory or<br/>
kinesthetic learner.  But real experiences are firing on all cylinders. <br/>
(Yes, bizarre metaphors are my &quot;preferred writing style&quot;. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

PS<br/>
**(who really would ream out someone who said that only a &quot;trained&quot; teacher<br/>

<br/>
My dh is a teacher who struggles to make his lessons more interesting<br/>
for the more kinesthetic kids.  It&#39;s hard to come up with good ideas<br/>
that work in the classroom.  His textbooks have lesson suggestions that<br/>
are SO LAME!  Like suggesting that a junior high school student do an<br/>
interpretive dance to act out a story.  It&#39;s a valid way to expand on<br/>
the story, but I FEAR the kind of mockery that might be generated in the audience.</div>

learn something, whether they come over or talk me through or lend me a book <br/>
depends more on what think I&#39;m needing to know than what they think MY <br/>
learning style is.<br/>
<br/>
Probably it&#39;s buzz-word to remind teachers that sitting in rows reading and <br/>
writing isn&#39;t the right way to do it.  To mix it up.<br/>

Terminology. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I presented some information to my husband this morning.  It was just a <br/>
conversation, but I did think about how to word it, and at what point in the <br/>
conversation so it didn&#39;t irritate him, so it had the smoothest and best <br/>
effect.  Maybe that kind of &quot;presentation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s learning to drive.  I don&#39;t rag on him about every single thing.  If <br/>
he does the same odd thing three times or so, I&#39;ll try to present some <br/>
information to him in such a way that he&#39;ll listen and remember.  If I just <br/>
have a running commentary on every motion, he&#39;ll stop listening.  So as long <br/>
as we&#39;re safe, I try to be positive or quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I have yelled &quot;STOP!&quot; twice.  Not my best presentation moments! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653048540">Now do not throw any old text books at me &lt;g&gt;, but I recieved my <br/>
degree in education.  For my short lived career I worked with <br/>
preschool accredidation and such.  However, in college we had a class <br/>
that touched on each &quot;subject&quot;, how to teach math, reading, language <br/>
arts, etc.  One class for special needs, ONE!  All those disorders in <br/>
one short semester with maybe 10-20 hours visitation in schools.  <br/>
Special needs meaning gifted to extremely mentally retarded.  Yeah, I <br/>
am sure I absorbed all that to be a great help to my future students. <br/>
<br/>
There were no classes in learning styles.  I rememeber hearing it, I <br/>
am sure I read it.  In no way, not in one class, not in one <br/>
interneship did we ever discuss how to cover all the diverse learning <br/>
styles. We never had to come up with one lesson plan that could cover <br/>
even half.  It was part of the rhetoric in your history of education <br/>
and that was that.  Certainly, school has done a slightly better job <br/>
of including some of the different learning styles in the primary <br/>
grades (if you have the right teacher &lt;I am rolling my eyes here, <br/>
because you know what the chances are&gt;)  Certainly, primary grades <br/>
were more slightly fun than I had, with learning centers and such <br/>
although it gets worse the older you get.  However, I would like to <br/>
glimpse at this particular teacher&#39;s lesson plans and see her using <br/>
all the styles &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I mention I plan to homeschool (most people I speak to would <br/>
not know the difference between unschool and homeschool) they tell me <br/>
how *easy* it will be for me as I am a teacher.  They are just set on <br/>
this.  It is difficult for anyone I know to think they can do this <br/>
simply because I have a degree which says I am a teacher.  You know <br/>
what, maybe I am a little more aware of some questions to ask or <br/>
where resources are or some good children&#39;s literature than a brand <br/>
new PARENT.  Maybe, I had a little less research to read in some <br/>
areas.  Who knows.   But beyond that, it is of little help.  In fact, <br/>
it just mean more deschooling for me &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
So for those of you who ever feel that maybe some teacher out there <br/>
could do it better or provide more diverse experiences or use all <br/>
those varying learning styles, let me set the record straight.  NO <br/>
WAY!  They were not trained to do it, it is as simple as that.  And <br/>
if you have a special needs child than there is not even need for a <br/>
discussion!<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re not homeschoolers, there IS no difference.  It&#39;s all internal <br/>
terminology, I think.  I don&#39;t think it does ANY good to tell anyone outside <br/>
of the [as if] homeschooling community [as it were] that you&#39;re <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But I get the same &quot;Oh, well of course YOU can homeschool.  You used to be a <br/>
TEAcher.<br/>
<br/>
The best tool I have from having been a teacher is the certain knowledge that <br/>
kids at any age run the full gamut of ability.  With seventh graders, some <br/>
can&#39;t read and some read as well as any adult.  With ninth graders, some hate <br/>
to write and can hardly construct a sentence, while some are writing parodies <br/>
in verse with handwriting they could make a living addressing wedding <br/>
invitations with.  <br/>
<br/>
And I know from my own growing up, from my friends, and from kids I knew <br/>
while teaching, that MOST of what kids know about history and geography and <br/>
science, they learned outside of school,  not in.  The kids who are whizes at <br/>
trivia and details are learning that stuff for fun, elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
So I could be totally relaxed from the beginning about &quot;grade level&quot; <br/>
questions.<br/>

hamburgers several weeks ago.  There was a woman with about 4 children there<br/>
 she finished her lunch and said &quot;okay, put your food away time for your<br/>
spelling test.&quot; Well, I figured it they didn&#39;t do well because she fussed<br/>
(loudly) at them the whole time about how their parents paid her to help<br/>
them (on and on) and they weren&#39;t trying or concentrating (trying to guilt<br/>
them into spelling, I guess).  I was watching her when I heard her say &quot;Why<br/>
are you so...&quot; to one of the kids.  I think I must have rose in my chair or<br/>
something because she stopped at the word &quot;so&quot; to look over at me.  I dont&#39;<br/>
know what I would have done if she did finish that sentence.  I said nothing<br/>
because I didn&#39;t want to embarrass dh and the kids (myself I don&#39;t really<br/>
care anymore) and I almost never interfere with other people living their<br/>
lives unless they invite me too, but I really felt that was an invitation to<br/>
show this lady to herself.  But I did nothing, and now wonder if I should<br/>
