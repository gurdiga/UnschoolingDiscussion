<div id="ygrps-yiv-1488195487">Hi Brynn,<br/>
<br/>
You say you&#39;re a vegan family.  We are increasingly seeming to go in<br/>
that direction ourselves.  I was wondering if you can recommend a truly<br/>
excellent alternative to a rich and creamy Hellmann&#39;s mayonaise type<br/>
spread for sandwiches or salad?  The vegan mayonaise products (with soy)<br/>
that I have tried are really vinegar-y, to the point of being very<br/>
acetic and sour and not at all creamy and with the mild flavour a<br/>
traditional mayonaise might offer.  Aside from spreading a ripe avocado<br/>
on a sandwich I guess I&#39;d also like to know if you have any homemade<br/>
versions of rich-tasting and smooth spreads?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We usually buy Nayonnaise-which is a vegan mayonnaise by Nasoya. It&#39;s not<br/>
tangy like the Hain vegan mayonnaise. It&#39;s very mild=at least we think so.<br/>
When we make our own, we use this recipe:<br/>
<br/>
Tofu Mayonnaise:<br/>
<br/>
3/4 cup soft or medium tofu (the best kind to use for this is by Mori<br/>
Nu-usually found in the Asian grocery section doesn&#39;t have to be chilled)<br/>
<br/>
2 tbsp lemon juice OR vinegar<br/>
1/2 tsp salt<br/>
dash of pepper (optional-I don&#39;t use it)<br/>
2 tbsp oil<br/>
<br/>
In a blender or food processor (I use my food processor) blend together on<br/>
high, the tofu, lemon juice, salt, pepper-if using, and oil until thick and<br/>
creamy. Adjust any ingredients for desired taste. Store in the refrigerator<br/>
in a clean, dry container with a tight fitting lid. Will keep for 7-10 days.<br/>
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.<br/>
<br/>
Also, let me know if there are any other things you are trying to use vegan<br/>
replacements for. I have so many recipes that it would be impossible for me<br/>
to send them all. But I&#39;d be happy to send a few, and I can recommend some<br/>
great cookbooks/informative books that are vegan only.<br/>
