She has read all the Warrior Cats books and likes the manga, too.  <br/>
There are about half a dozen of those, so far.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762402068">When Chamille was heavily into reading manga, we&#39;d go to the bookstore and just browse all the manga until she&#39;d find a series that looked interesting that had the style of drawing she liked.  I&#39;m unfamiliar with a lot of the manga geared toward younger kids.  Chamille really started reading manga around 11 and she went straight to gore and blood.  Other than the gore and blood, she really like Naruto for a long time.  That one appeals to a wider audience!<br/>
<br/>
Most bookstores these days have a graphic novel section, even Borders and Barnes and Noble.  We are lucky enough to live near a Japanese bookstore and Powell&#39;s, so that&#39;s where we&#39;ve gone mostly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331922130">We used Viz Media and Shonen Jump web sites to research Manga in the beginning of Zac&#39;s love of Manga.  Zachariah seems to always decide he wants a series that the book stores do not have, but we do find them on Amazon - many of the books on Amazon are buy 3 get the fourth one free so that helps with the cost a lot!  Lately he has been watching a lot of Anime on-line and that has him venturing into several new series - that are actually old series from the late 80&#39;s early 90&#39;s.  He never liked the usual ones that everyone else tended to like such as Nurato - he tends to be that way.<br/>
<br/>
Some consideration:  Some series are only 3 books and others like Inuyasha are up to book 46 - that is the next book due out March 9th.  Bleach is up to book 30 and Knights of the Zodiac is up to book 29.   Some series put out another book every couple of months and some only come out twice a year.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon is also a great resource to keep track of when the next book is due out in a particular series - as long as they carry it of course.<br/>

My almost 9yo DD recently started reading this series and loves it!   <br/>
She&#39;s been watching animations on YouTube that people made of these  <br/>
books and then started drawing and posting her own.  I hadn&#39;t known  <br/>
that they were based on any stories until my son told me so I got the  <br/>
first book from the library, and after I picked it up I casually told  <br/>
her that I picked the book up for her if she was interested in  <br/>
checking it out.  She dove right in!  :)<br/>
<br/>
She could read prior to this, but this is the first time she&#39;s had  <br/>
any interest in reading a book.  She&#39;s surprised by how much she  <br/>
enjoys the portability of a book versus reading things online -- she  <br/>
can snuggle up on the couch, relax on her bed, take it in the car,  <br/>
etc.  :)<br/>

based on the fact that they&#39;re both based on video games.  They&#39;re at least<br/>
worth a look, and most chain bookstores should have some of the series.<br/>
Also, I&#39;d second the recommendation for Amazon, to check out what others<br/>

The Japanese bookstore where we live has all the written in Japanese manga separated by boy and girl books.  The girl section is almost entirely pink and the boy section is almost entirely red/orange and blue.  The written in English versions are all alphabetical, not gender separated.  It was one of the first things Chamille noticed when we started shopping there for manga books.  The Naruto books were in the boy section in the Japanese version.  Books like Fruits Basket were in the girl section.<br/>

Chamille was like that for a while.  When it came right to it though, she was more interested in the &quot;idea&quot; of learning the Japanese language rather than actually learning it.  She does have a friend that is really into creating manga that has learned lots of Japanese by simply observing and absorbing it.  <br/>
<br/>
What I would do, is to get two books that are the same, one in English and one in Japanese and compare, and a character translation type of book.<br/>

other unschooled children doing this, but wow!<br/>
<br/>
My question is here, does anyone have any suggestions for materials to<br/>
give my son so this learning introduction won&#39;t be overwhelming?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
