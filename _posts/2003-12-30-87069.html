It&#39;s not hard, Ren.  Whenever you&#39;re doing something (whether it&#39;s housework or anything else) and it feels boring and monotonous, stop what you&#39;re doing, look at what you&#39;re doing, and think of another way to do it.  It doesn&#39;t matter what you come up with, anything new will help.  A lot of my &#39;methods/inventions&#39; don&#39;t work, but they&#39;re still fun to come up with.  Sometimes I&#39;ll spend an hour thinking up a new way to do something that might have only taken 20 mintues to actually do.  I know that sounds crazy, but it gets me out of a rut and most of the time we have fun with the &#39;new way&#39; whether it works or not.  It gives my mind, and the kid&#39;s minds something to do.  Anyone can use a dustmop to round up dust bunnies, but try getting down on your hands and knees with a drinking straw and blowing them into a pile!  It&#39;s not effecient, but when you get the kids involved it can be a lot of fun.  The dust bunnies themselves drop way down the list of priorities, and the fun and <br/>
 creativity move to the forefront of the job.  The job turns into a game, and the rut just fades away.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a big fan of ruts.  They&#39;re boring.  <br/>
<br/>

Well, maybe it is a gender thing, and maybe it is from inherited baggage, but I think what it comes down to is that you ladies have forgotten how to PLAY!  REALLY PLAY!  Getting down on the floor, letting your minds romp and wander, getting the crappy parts of everyday living out of your heads and losing yourselves in the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
Drop your &quot;baggage&quot; at the door, go in and sit down with your kids and LET them show you how to play again!  No matter how long it takes, no matter how many dishes are waiting in the sink or how dirty your floors are, stay there with them until your belly aches from laughing so hard!  THAT is when the world around you sort of fades away, and it&#39;s just you and your kids having fun and PLAYING!  Laughter has a way of letting a person see things differently, and in a much brighter light.  It is, in my mind, the absolute cure for drudgery.  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a mom, not a maid, not a nanny, not a cab driver or a referee, and I don&#39;t care what your own mom told you, mom&#39;s should have fun too!  <br/>
<br/>
Screw the dishes, go PLAY with your kids!  If it comes time to eat and there&#39;s no dishes to eat off of...improvise, adapt, overcome!  That in itself might be fun.<br/>
<br/>

Well, I dunno.  What are the requirements for being &quot;somebody in particular&quot;?  :)  (Sorry, that just kinda cracked me up.)  If you&#39;re asking if I&#39;m a public speaker...nope.  Have I written any books?  Not yet.  Am I an unschooler?  Most definitely!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a dad that fully believes in the unschooling lifestyle, believes in saying exactly what I think, and seems to be developing a thing for infiltrating the &#39;Women&#39;s Zones&#39; of cyberspace.  lol.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of the people on this list &#39;know&#39; me from unschooling.com, where I&#39;ve been posting for a while now.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a guy that gets bored at work and likes to talk about unschooling whenever I get the chance.  <br/>
<br/>
So, am I &quot;somebody in particular&quot;?  Probably not.  <br/>
<br/>

Someone, I can&#39;t recall whom, said something like &gt; OH, now I know who he is <br/>
:-)..   Which gave me ( and obviously some other folkss) the impression that <br/>
he was &quot;somebody in particular&quot;  Like.. OH, he wrote that book &quot;such and such&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;Oh, hes on that show &quot;such and such&quot;  Or, he is married to so and so,   <br/>
ya know???  <br/>
<br/>
From what I have read of Lyle&#39;s post,  I think he is very cool too.  He seems <br/>
like a great unschooling dad.   I think its wonderful to have the male <br/>
perspective shared here.   From some of the others posters comments, I thought maybe <br/>
he was some kind of  well-known personality.    Not that because he isn&#39;t he <br/>
is any less of a person.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;   *groan* Believe me, I used to be able to construct a half decent <br/>
sentence. Then I had kids. :)  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I was just playing.  I think accidentally funny things are good.   <br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to embarrass you.<br/>

This morning I wrote before food or tea, and made three or five mistakes.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It was weird from me, but not from the other folks who asked??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Who&#39;s Lyle?&quot; is not as weird/rude/odd as <br/>
&quot;is he &#39;somebody&#39; in particular??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Knowing that somone is reading it, to ask whether he&#39;s nobody or somebody is <br/>
weird.<br/>

      I &#39;M nobody! Who are you?  <br/>
      Are you nobody, too?  <br/>
      Then there &#39;s a pair of us-don&#39;t tell!  <br/>
      They &#39;d banish us, you know.  <br/>
