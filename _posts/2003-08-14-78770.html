&quot;The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that<br/>
English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don&#39;t just borrow<br/>
words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways<br/>
to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.&quot;<br/>

Although we (in the past) did not unschool, we&#39;ve always been sort of <br/>
eclectic, and my kids never did a spelling course, and the only thing they did that <br/>
resembled English/Grammar was &quot;Wordsmith&quot; and writing a lot.  They have learned <br/>
great spelling, language mechanics, creative writing, just from reading and <br/>
using the computer.  Spell check is the best spelling &quot;program&quot; around.<br/>
