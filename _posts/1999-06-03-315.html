<div id="ygrps-yiv-887487626">I believe that unschooling is more then a way to &quot;school&quot; it is a<br/>
philosophy and a way of life. I am not lerning just because i do not pay to<br/>
go to a college anymore. and I am not done learning just cus i have a<br/>
masters. I will continue to learn. I love learning and I believe that I<br/>
know best how to learn and i know what I want to learn.<br/>
<br/>
yes there are some things kids need to learn but that is up to us as<br/>
parents to do. and many of them do not have to be in an exact time frame.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling says alot about my priorities in life. I believe that I am in<br/>
charge of my family and my life not the govt. or even a religion.<br/>
