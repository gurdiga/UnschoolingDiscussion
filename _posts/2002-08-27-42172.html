&lt;&lt; A month ago, for example, when I was new here, I listened to perhaps twenty<br/>
 days of back and forth from several women about one&#39;s relationship (years<br/>
 before) with a rock musician named Winger. During those (slow) times, I<br/>
 often wondered how that conversation related to the list even as it took so<br/>
 much space. I concluded that since no one could really address unschooling<br/>
 itself, that anything goes, even old boyfriends and if they were good<br/>
 kissers. No one even complained that those posts interrupted any of the<br/>
 other threads, and no one seemed to care that the subject was far OT. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
HELLOO!!  Anybody home Ned?<br/>
I think Joyce and Helen (among others) have over and over and over and OVER <br/>
again explained that any topic is not OFF topic....as long as it doesn&#39;t take <br/>
over the whole list.<br/>
If you want a bunch of people to agree with you, to jump on the political <br/>
bandwagon there are OTHER lists.<br/>
No one was trying to take over the whole list with winger propaganda.<br/>
No one was trying to get a bunch of followers.<br/>
Will you please either GO away or get with the flow of the list???<br/>
Did you notice that it had a very nice flow prior to your coming on board? <br/>
That there was a lot of useful discussion?<br/>
God help us, you just won&#39;t give up.<br/>
Joyce, I am now begging you to ban this lunatic.<br/>
