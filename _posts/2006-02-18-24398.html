<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683659331">The recent conversations on this list about creating a nest have <br/>
brought up a lot of issues about cleaning (who should do it and why) <br/>
and stuff (who should control  stuff).  This sent me off in a rant to <br/>
my husband about one of my least favorite, oft heard phrases; &quot;less is <br/>
more.&quot;  He suggested that I post it to you all (I think he has heard it <br/>
a few times).  In my opinion, this phrase is used by people who want to <br/>
be stingy.  Less is not more!  More is more and less is less.  <br/>
Sometimes people want &quot;more&quot; and sometimes people want &quot;less.&quot;  Giving <br/>
a child &quot;less&quot; does not make them appreciate or cherish the things they <br/>
do have, it leaves them wanting.  Giving a child &quot;more&quot; (more toys, <br/>
more attention, more books, more opportunities) gives them more to use, <br/>
share and (heaven forbid) enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
My second least favorite phrase is &quot;that which does not kill us makes <br/>
us stronger.&quot;  &quot;That which does not kill us&quot; brings us awfully close to <br/>
the edge.  It makes us exhausted, dejected, hopeless and run-down.  <br/>
Telling a person that a horrible tragedy will make them stronger is NOT <br/>
HELPFUL (in my opinion).  Maybe some amazing observations or <br/>
experiences will come out of tragedy but when one is in the midst of <br/>
something horrible one needs support, a shoulder to lean on, food, <br/>
sunshine and caring.  I think people use the above phrase after a <br/>
tragedy because they want to believe it, because they did not receive <br/>
adequate support during a terrible time.<br/>
<br/>
Any other phrases we should get rid of for the sake of our happy <br/>
families?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569766406">I like your thoughts on the &quot;less is more&quot; phrase.  If someone wants a short<br/>
rant from me, all they need do is quote &quot;that which does not kill us blah,<br/>
blah, blah&quot;.  I remind them that &quot;that&quot; usually leaves us shaken, devastated<br/>
and often shortens our life span.  It&#39;s just a comment used by those who<br/>
don&#39;t realize that they don&#39;t want to feel as sorry for us as they should<br/>
and/or as vulnerable as they really are.<br/>

Sandra and I opened our talk on &quot;mindful parenting&quot; with lame things<br/>
our parents said to us!  &quot;I&#39;ll give you something to cry about&quot; and such.<br/>
So it wasn&#39;t sayings, but actual phrases we heard our parents say that<br/>
weren&#39;t helpful or conducive to parent-child relationships.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad came to the conference, so I was a little bit nervous about<br/>
dissecting his parenting in front of hundreds of people! But he missed<br/>
that talk anyway...which was probably better for me.:)<br/>

It is possible to have so much stuff that it truly does keep you from  <br/>
being able to utilize other stuff. Getting rid of a layer of stuff  <br/>
can open up the rest to be found and used.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984505431">I&#39;d love to read this list of phrases you opened with in the talk.  <br/>
Would you mind posting it?  Or is it available elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
Just to add my least favorite phrase:  &quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot;  when a child is <br/>
crying.  If a child is crying, &quot;it&quot; is NOT ok.  Otherwise the child <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be crying.  When parents say, &quot;it&#39;s ok&quot;, to me it usually <br/>
sounds more like they mean &quot;PLEASE JUST SHUT UP AND STOP CRYING.&quot; <br/>

My second least favorite phrase is &quot;that which does not kill us makes<br/>

<br/>
And I&#39;ve never thought about that much, but that which claims to be  <br/>
making us stronger must sometimes kill us!  It&#39;s only in retrospect  <br/>
that people use that phrase.<br/>
<br/>
I hated (HATED) hearing, when I was a kid, &quot;It&#39;s not going to kill  <br/>
you to...&quot; or &quot;Now that didn&#39;t kill you, did it?&quot;  It was sarcastic  <br/>
and cruel.  It essentially said &quot;Anything short of death is  <br/>
acceptable.&quot;  I heard it from my mom and her relatives, mostly.<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ll go one step further and say it&#39;s probably more commonly used by people  <br/>
who HAVEN&#39;T been through a tragedy, and are instead *thinking* they are saying <br/>
 something comforting to someone who has,...<br/>
 <br/>
.... or trying to divert guilt feelings they are having after NOT  helping <br/>
someone in their lives while THEY were going through a terrible  time.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596222166">That which does not kill us........<br/>
   <br/>
  One of my favorite sayings is Adversity does not build character, it reveals it.  I always joke That which does not kill us just makes us wish we were dead.  My daughter has serious health issues. She has undergone 5 surgeries and may have another on the way. We were told 7 years ago that we could lose her. I know she will probably never be an old lady. <br/>
  I think I AM stronger for having gone through the things I did. I also feel...older, and more tired than I EVER thought I would be. I have been going through this for awhile now so maybe I am coming  from a different perspective. While I am not religious, I do feel having a child with special needs HAS been a blessing. <br/>
   <br/>
  I do think people say that because they do not know what to say. They  think they are helping. The only thing I wanted to do during that time was break all my dishes. I didn&#39;t do it. But that is all I wanted. People are always at a loss as to what to say or do. The absolute best response anyone gave me during those horrible times was this.  &quot;Man, that sucks&quot; <br/>

&gt; that time was break all my dishes. I didn&#39;t do it. But that is all  <br/>
&gt; I wanted. People are always at a loss as to what to say or do. The  <br/>
&gt; absolute best response anyone gave me during those horrible times  <br/>
&gt; was this.  &quot;Man, that sucks&quot;<br/>

As for the phrase &quot;What doesn&#39;t kill you, makes you stronger.&quot;  <br/>
After going through things I thought would kill me, I thought the <br/>
phrase was stupid.  I don&#39;t feel stronger at all, no matter how much <br/>
people tell me how strong I am.  I feel much more fragile and weak <br/>
that I did before, when life felt easier and more carefree.  <br/>
But, other people in my life took thier grief and created.  My dad <br/>
created a lot out of his grief.  He wrote songs, created a <br/>
foundation. He became inspired to do.  So I think for some, maybe, <br/>
the phrase is true.  There are so many different types in this <br/>
world, no phrase will fit all.<br/>

through a tragedy and get back to having a good life again - then,  <br/>
yeah, fine. But that&#39;s not really &quot;stronger.&quot; Each loss, each  <br/>
disaster, that has happened in my life, has made me feel more  <br/>
vulnerable, not less.<br/>
<br/>
And, physically, it doesn&#39;t make sense at all - illnesses or injuries  <br/>
that almost kill people do NOT leave them stronger - they very often  <br/>
leave them weaker and often with long-term physical problems.<br/>
<br/>

they hadn&#39;t been struck by tragedy, doesn&#39;t it? I suppose it is that  <br/>
they discover within themselves the ability to channel their strong  <br/>
emotions into something creative or useful.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I also dislike that expression because not only does it seem  <br/>
untrue, it seems to be a negative judgment on people who do NOT get  <br/>
stronger - like those who do not start foundations or build statues  <br/>
or start running marathons are shirking. In reality, people are doing  <br/>
really well if they respond to bad things happening in their lives by  <br/>
turning their attention to living a satisfying life with family and  <br/>
friends, keeping love and goodness in their lives.<br/>

&gt; Just to add my least favorite phrase:  &quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot;  when a child is <br/>
&gt; crying.  If a child is crying, &quot;it&quot; is NOT ok.  Otherwise the child <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be crying.  When parents say, &quot;it&#39;s ok&quot;, to me it usually <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Emily  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Emily,<br/>
<br/>
I think that some phrases can mean different things in different<br/>
contexts or with different tones. For instance, if my little girl is<br/>
crying, I&#39;ll say, &quot;it&#39;s ok&quot;, but I&#39;m saying, &quot;it&#39;s ok to cry and feel<br/>
as you do, I would too.&quot; And yes, sometimes I say all of that but<br/>
sometimes I know that by this point, I don&#39;t have to, she knows that I<br/>
honor her feelings and will listen to her.<br/>
<br/>
Once, I heard myself saying, &quot;just wait til your Daddy gets home.&quot; and<br/>
then I laughed right out loud because rather than a threat, I was<br/>
saying that we couldn&#39;t start in on the pie yet because we wanted to<br/>
share it so let&#39;s just wait. I laughed because it was one of those<br/>
moments when it really came home for me that I&#39;m very different from<br/>
my parents.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never thought of it in terms of material possessions, though I <br/>
really do think of it when teaching riding; it&#39;s a good reminder that <br/>
the less I babble, the more the student can learn from the feel of the <br/>
horse.  Applying it to unschooling was facetious, since I don&#39;t teach <br/>
that ;-)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a good bridge between the meanings,  I think.  A little talk,  <br/>
lots of experience, a little more talk...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for clarifying.   I don&#39;t think twisting words for humorous  <br/>
effect always gets us over the original dilemma (though I&#39;ve done it  <br/>
myself too).   The &quot;simple living&quot; things I&#39;ve seen and read seem  <br/>
sometimes simple as to item count in a room, for instance, but VERY  <br/>
complex as to acceptability of materials or places of origin, or  <br/>
style or use or whatever all... lots of rules to create simplicity,  <br/>
f&#39;rinstance.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right; that&#39;s what I mean to say.<br/>
