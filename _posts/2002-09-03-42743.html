 </span></blockquote>I saved that recipe, it sounds really good! We buy granola at the coop<br/>
and my daughter wears birks, so maybe we qualify... but there&#39;s a whole<br/>
subset of homeschoolers we&#39;ve met who are very into Natural and tend to<br/>
ban (well, it seems like a ban to me, but they always use nicer terms) <br/>
things like plastic toys and &quot;violent&quot; toys and soda and TV and computer<br/>
games, and they&#39;re the one we know to not even bother inviting to Chuck E<br/>
Cheese... and often they&#39;re Waldorf-inspired, and they talk in platitudes<br/>
and they always sem to be the ones trying to &quot;protect&quot; their children<br/>
from certain information... and they sometimes call themselves<br/>
unschoolers but it&#39;s always unschooling as in &quot;I follow his lead and<br/>
teach him the wonderful lovely natural stuff he&#39;s showed an interest in<br/>
learning&quot; (assuming it&#39;s something acceptable like owls or the gold rush<br/>
- and even with stuff like that we&#39;re only going to cover the &quot;nice&quot;<br/>
parts, because we must protect the children).<br/>
<br/>
Their children, IME, often do nasty exclusive stuff (&quot;I&#39;m starting a club<br/>
and only girls who are 7 or older can be in it, but not you because your<br/>
shoes are weird&quot;) when the parents are out of earshot, which always sort<br/>
of led me to the conclusion that they were really sick of this fake<br/>
perpetual sweetness and light and didn&#39;t know any other ways to escape<br/>
besides being nasty. They also edge away from kids wearing Simpsons or<br/>
Monty Python  t shirts.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s a species endemic to northern California... and I have<br/>
noticed that it&#39;s a lot more prevelant among parents of younger kids, so<br/>
it doesn&#39;t seem to work in the long term.<br/>

<br/>
I used to get my boys to disarm when we were going to playgroup meetings, or <br/>
when other families were coming over we didn&#39;t know well, just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Letting them play with guns didn&#39;t mean they had to have them at all times, <br/>
every day.  It was a lesson in courtesy, just as they didn&#39;t (still don&#39;t) <br/>
put South Park or even the Simpson&#39;s on if known-conservative-Christian <br/>
friends are over.<br/>
<br/>
One day Chef Aid was on a CD player in the kitchen, and I was cleaning house <br/>
and bopping around and had left the room.  A family came to deliver a <br/>
teenaged girl to hang out.  They&#39;d never been here.  Marty subtly came and <br/>
switched it off all casually, and let me know he had.  <br/>
<br/>
They practiced early by not singing their funny poop-based parodies at the <br/>
grandmother&#39;s house.  <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t always use the cleanest of language, but they are really good at <br/>
gauging the audience and not using it indiscriminately.<br/>
<br/>
Same with weapons or topics of discussion.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, me too.  Except in this instance (my old support group), there is <br/>
one kid who won&#39;t come if he can&#39;t play with weapons, and one mom who <br/>
won&#39;t let her son come if there are kids playing with weapons.  She&#39;s <br/>
the one pushing for the ban.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, the weapons kid is a charter member, and he has a lot of <br/>
other kinds of issues--kind of a dysfunctional family all around--and <br/>
this is the only thing he will attend, at all.  He&#39;s a total struggle <br/>
for his mom all the time.  SHE needs the group.  If he won&#39;t go, she <br/>
can&#39;t go.  (They are not unschoolers, but wanted to be--just can&#39;t pull <br/>
it off.  And that&#39;s a whole nother post.)<br/>
<br/>
The anti-weapons mom just gave birth to her second child, also a son.  I <br/>
really think she&#39;s in la-la land if she thinks her sons will never want <br/>
to do some kind of gun play.  Even if her 5 yo is compliant (which I&#39;ve <br/>
heard he&#39;s NOT when she&#39;s not looking), she has no idea what the baby is <br/>
going to be like.  And our children are often very different from each <br/>
other!  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you, Sandra.  We show common courtesy in groups until we <br/>
find out what is acceptable.  But the weapons kid is a messed up kid, <br/>
and the group is torn between doing what it can to help him <br/>
(socialization issues, but he&#39;s not dangerous) out of love for him and <br/>
his mother (known them a long time), and this new person&#39;s request.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I personally think the anti-weapon woman is being discourteous to <br/>
come to a group and insist it be her way, anyway.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s kind of what I was thinking. We too tried to be mindful of the <br/>
dynamics of any home or situation we were going into. If it was a <br/>
non-gun-toting home, we would play by their guidelines. But I would not go <br/>
into an established group and impose my rules on them. You can&#39;t be all <br/>
things to all people. I&#39;d tell her how the group has been successfully <br/>
operating thus far, and if she wants to be a part of it great. If not, <br/>
that&#39;s her choice. I wouldn&#39;t cut off the older members access to the group <br/>
because a newer member has problems with cap guns.<br/>

<br/>
TRUE if the group allowed weapons play before she showed up.  That&#39;s a whole <br/>
different situation.<br/>
<br/>
If people come over here and it&#39;s totally on our terms, not &quot;a meeting,&quot; just <br/>
being at our house, then the boffers often come out, the tournament-fighting <br/>
video games aren&#39;t under the pile, and Little Shop of Horrors is okay to play.<br/>
<br/>
We have one little girl who hangs out with us who can&#39;t even hear &quot;Under the <br/>
Boardwalk.&quot;  Too nasty.  The other day I had Paul Simon on and was singing <br/>
along to &quot;Cecelia&quot; when I realized it was too nasty, and I stopped singing <br/>
and took it off.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of music and don&#39;t have to play stuff that will make her <br/>
uncomfortable.  I hope she&#39;ll get over her avoidance of popular culture, but <br/>
if she opts not to, that&#39;s okay too, and she and Holly probably won&#39;t be <br/>
friends their whole lives if one stays extremely Christian and intolerant and <br/>
Holly stays Holly.  But for now they&#39;re friends and I feel an obligation to <br/>
help keep the environment &quot;wholesome&quot; (to the friend&#39;s standards).<br/>

<br/>
We have  lots of Mormon friends here in Utah. (No kidding, in Utah, really? <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) My kids have become  pretty sensitive to not offending the <br/>
sensibilities or beliefs of their friends. Conor had a little trouble with <br/>
this when we first moved here, but he and his frineds are now old enough to <br/>
discuss this stuff. There&#39;s mutual respect.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824136513">I also notice this and for me it has turned up in the places where I really thought we would fit in.  At art and music related activities,  in a way I feel like they are acting really snobbish to us.  We aren&#39;t  purists enough to be considered one of them.  For example, I just let both of my kids drop out of Suzuki music programs this year because I really want them being the ones to decide if they want to be musicians.  Well,  of course, I get from most people at the school that I need to force that on them because they don&#39;t know what&#39;s &#39;best&#39; for them.  Yuck!!  They don&#39;t give credit where credit is due, that both my kids are doing other things and sit down at our old piano and pick out songs, or walk around playing instruments/doing a parade for us.  Its very sad that most of these kids are so over scheduled that they can&#39;t just enjoy what they want to enjoy.  Take Care, Kelli <br/>

<br/>
Hi, Tuck --<br/>
<br/>
My homeschool support group does forbid weapons play at park day, and I<br/>
just live with it.  As a mom who inclines to nervousness, I&#39;m reasonably<br/>
happy not to have the younger kids waving sticks at each other.  (Almost<br/>
all of the older kids at the park are quite gentle, but some of the<br/>
preschool aged kids are still full of beans, and not full of sensibleness.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my son has a plastic weapon in his hand while we are driving<br/>
to the park, but he understands about leaving it in the car.<br/>
<br/>
(OK, when he was 2.5 or 3 and totally weapons obsessed, we just skipped<br/>
park days for awhile.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  So our group isn&#39;t debating weapons play any more, that&#39;s settled<br/>
for us.  Food is our new battleground.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes -  the feeling that its okay to respect others beliefs. We do this,too .<br/>
We have some people over whom I know have stricter rules and the kids and I<br/>
have talked about no videos, computer games or gun play when these families<br/>
visit. We often choose other board games in advance, to see if the visitors<br/>
like any of these...But I have a bit of a problem with people, new to a<br/>
group, who want to make rules for the group...several years ago, a group of<br/>
homeschoolers used to meet once a week at the local swimming pool. Some<br/>
would leave at lunch and some of us would buy some food at the kiosk before<br/>
leaving...A couple of new families to the group said they had talked<br/>
privately and agreed that the group should adopt a rule that none of us<br/>
should go to the kiosk - saved them from explaining to their kids why they<br/>
didn&#39;t want to buy food from the kiosk. I felt it was unfair to make rules<br/>
for others - so people suggested a compromise - families could go to the<br/>
kiosk but not buy junk food! What? I respected their choice in not allowing<br/>
their kids fast food but I didn&#39;t have the same rules and didn&#39;t want these<br/>
ideas forced onto our family. It was a tricky situation...Leonie W.</div>

This kind of thing drives me crazy. The feeling that I should not be saying <br/>
yes so often because it makes other moms feel bad for saying no so often. I <br/>
LOVE those little moments I can say yes. Those are the ones that create the <br/>
best memories. (Remember how mom would take us to the pool? And then we&#39;d <br/>
always get a treat from the kiosk?!)<br/>
<br/>
When Casey was taking gymnastics  twice a week, she would ask for a treat <br/>
from the snack machine after her hour and a half (intense!)   workout. After <br/>
working that hard, that was what she wanted. It cost 50 cents each time. It <br/>
never, ever spoiled her dinner because the kid was starving after working so <br/>
hard. Our funds are not unlimited, but I knew I could cover the 50 cents, <br/>
even if she asked each and every time. It made her happy, and kept her blood <br/>
sugar up. To me, it was a win/win situation. I was amazed and saddened at <br/>
how many moms gave me the evil eye for saying yes. And at how many sad any <br/>
whiny kids had to go home depleted because the parents wouldn&#39;t spring for <br/>
50 cents or remember to bring a granola bar to the workout.<br/>

was always the &quot;no&quot; person.  But one time he stuck up for me, and <br/>
insisted I be allowed to go on a high school spring break ski trip.  I <br/>
will always love him for that.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest children were little, Dad would take them for a couple of <br/>
weeks at a time.  (I was single then, and he was giving me a break.)  He <br/>
always reported that they behaved perfectly and were happy and had a <br/>
good time.  They always came back completely centered and content.  He <br/>
said that was because he resolved when my eldest was born to never say <br/>
&quot;no&quot; to his grandchildren, even if he knew what they were asking he <br/>
couldn&#39;t possibly provide.  <br/>
<br/>
Think about how hard that would be?  Never say no?  Sometimes he had to <br/>
be creative; he would say &quot;later&quot; or engage them in conversation about <br/>
it until they came to the conclusion that they didn&#39;t need/want it.  But <br/>
because he&#39;d never said no to even their tiniest request, they&#39;ve never <br/>
asked for anything impossible.  This is some of the best advice found in <br/>
&quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen...&quot;, too.  And he&#39;s probably never even <br/>
heard of that book.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids never ask him for anything anymore, because they know he&#39;d give <br/>
it to them, and they&#39;re grown up enough and love him enough to not want <br/>
to burden him.  He has a very nice Jeep and a ski boat and numerous <br/>
other toys, that they know they can use anytime.  But they don&#39;t.  I <br/>
think just knowing they can is enough.  And they express true gratitude <br/>
to him, which is nice to see.  They think the world of each other.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, hard, hard when you&#39;re the parent and not the grandparent, to <br/>
have a relationship with your kids like that.  But every little bit helps.<br/>
