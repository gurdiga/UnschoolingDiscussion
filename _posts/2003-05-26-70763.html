&gt;Really though, I&#39;ve never had to keep knives way up out of reach or in a <br/>
&gt;drawer with those darn childproof latches.  Oftentimes, I&#39;ll find a <br/>
&gt;knife on the counter from the 4th apple I&#39;ve cut up that day and I <br/>
&gt;forgot to toss it in the dishwasher.  My kids (2 and 4) know that knives <br/>
&gt;are tools -- not toys -- and that they are very sharp and can cut their <br/>
&gt;skin.  They have no interest in them.<br/>

them--they&#39;re sometimes left out on the counter, but they&#39;re not <br/>
*forbidden fruit* and not attractive. Drives my dh crazy, though!<br/>

My daughters have a few knives of their own {the 7 and 9 yo}we gave <br/>
them for Christmas. My oldest was considering she might want to buy <br/>
another one at my husband&#39;s dad&#39;s shop {accually they pretty much get <br/>
every thing free from grampa but it was a partner&#39;s merch.}. She <br/>
later decided that she had one and didn&#39;t need to spend her money on <br/>
it so put it back. <br/>
Her grampa&#39;s wife {second marrage} was so suprised that I would let <br/>
her have it. That was exactly what I explained. They are also pretty <br/>
careful with them but sometimes they like to carve soap {we use Fels <br/>
Naptha cause I hear it is the best &lt;g&gt;} and things and pocket knives <br/>
come in handy. They do keep them here for now and don&#39;t carry them <br/>
around. But it is so ironic how she seemed so shocked that i would <br/>
allow that but she and others seems to think we are over protective <br/>
by homeschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t keep the knives in drawers. They are kept in a carving block <br/>
(is that what there called?) on the counter. Not because they are <br/>
forbidden, but because *I* don&#39;t like reaching into a drawer and <br/>
cutting myself inadvertently. I really need to get some quality <br/>
knives.<br/>
