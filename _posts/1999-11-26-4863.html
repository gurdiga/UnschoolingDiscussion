<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820473897">ABC or NBC did a little editorial on e-shopping and Christmas shopping and<br/>
said much the same but even greater numbers and, this is the really scary<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199650997">We saw some folks wandering around looking extremely cold, so we went home<br/>
and cleared out drawers and closets.  Told the kidlets what I was doing and<br/>
we gathered together over 30 sweat shirts, sweaters and jackets that we<br/>
either didn&#39;t wear anymore or were too small and took them down to the<br/>
Rescue Mission to give out to those in need.  Kidlets loved it!  They also<br/>
go treat or treating each year with the express purpose of taking the candy<br/>
down the next day to be given out at the Mission.  The only real money we<br/>
are going to spend this year for Christmas is each of us pick a person off<br/>
the giving tree at K-Mart and our bank and shop till we drop.  It is really<br/>
fun to shop for someone that is in need and you know they won&#39;t have to<br/>
feel obligated (or be embarassed) to say thank you to you personally and<br/>
can just chalk it up to &quot;the world&#39;s not that bad after all.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; give to friends, good will, etc. Yet when I look around I see so much more<br/>
&gt; STUFF to go through and get rid of........<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yeah....I am moving and I have been moving my stuff for over two<br/>
months...half of my stuff (that seemed so important to me at the pre packing<br/>
stage) is over at the other house---I don&#39;t even miss it---YEAH!<br/>
I think that i am going to jump in the I DON&#39;T NEED IT bandwagon --I have<br/>
been feeling guilty about my OH so high lay-always---I think I will grab<br/>
some of the stuff and plunk it in the toys for tots and give my kids a card<br/>
that says thank you and that their toys etc..have been donated (but not all<br/>
of them!)<br/>
I need this support --every year I go through this--last year tho I only<br/>
spent about 500 on 6 kids, my hubby, parents and in laws, and 8 nieces and<br/>
nephews.  One year I made everyone something---I loved it! AND one year I<br/>
gave everyone SASPC<br/>
with a note saying to tell me what they really wanted and to send it<br/>
back----It worked great they all wanted something inexpensive or that i<br/>
could make (we gave them ideas in them!)--It was great fun and when we sent<br/>
them the gift we also put in some paper and crayons or some treat etc...that<br/>
we had extra of....I am thinking of asking the kids if they all want to do a<br/>
toy exchange and therefor not spend money or create WASTE!<br/>
Good Luck---See it is Black Friday and I am resisting the temptation!<br/>
Good Luck to you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180244245">We used the bbq.  You have to get a small bird (like under 10 pounds) and<br/>
have a rotisserie on it.  Turn the heat down LOW, very low and away you go.<br/>
 I&#39;d ask a butcher for some roast string (other string just burns and falls<br/>
off and that defeats the purpose) so you can tie the wings up next to the<br/>
body or cut the last two joints off.<br/>

to eat , etc).  Another great idea I heard for people who love to<br/>
exchange gifts and can afford it is a ticket for you and the gift<br/>
recipient to go to a show or out to dinner together.<br/>
