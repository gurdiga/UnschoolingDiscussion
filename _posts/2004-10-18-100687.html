<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336453985">&lt;&lt; I do understand the power of affirmation and visualizing. I hadn&#39;t even <br/>
noticed the kinds of imagery I have been using in my thinking and talking and <br/>
writing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I liked this.  It was about my comments on Kelly saying she felt like she was <br/>
in a tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Every few months someone comes along here or some other unschooling <br/>
think-tank places, lays out a VERY clearly scary, negative load, and then gets angry if <br/>
anyone sees what they&#39;ve deposited.<br/>
<br/>
Someone did that at unschooling.com just the other day.  He was FURIOUS, <br/>
bigtime, that we thought we knew anything about him.  We knew a WHOLE lot about <br/>
him, including that he couldn&#39;t even see what he himself had written, and <br/>
couldn&#39;t feel the frustration that was just oozing out of him, and that he didn&#39;t <br/>
know that he didn&#39;t even much *like* his poor little boy.  That poor kid didn&#39;t <br/>
even know how to go for a walk in the woods right.  He just kept looking for <br/>
good sticks, and that was WRONG.<br/>
<br/>
So after several comebacks from the dad batting away the really great <br/>
feedback of a dozen generous volunteers, he said the whole thing was a waste of time.<br/>
<br/>
HOW WRONG for him.  <br/>
Everyone who wrote benefited.  Her own understanding deepened.  She was a <br/>
better person for having given freely of her experience.<br/>
Those who were reading but not posting and who were undecided were benefited.<br/>
Everyone who read it, I&#39;m guessing, felt an emotional reaction that either <br/>
made her feel a little guilty for having thought similar things, or maybe very <br/>
grateful for NOT having thought them lately or ever.<br/>
<br/>
His child got a lot of sympathy from the readership, and the author (who had <br/>
all kinds of freedom to think, to restrain himself, to withhold information, <br/>
to edit before posting) was getting none.<br/>
<br/>
What he wanted was for us to tell him he was right, he was doing a good job, <br/>
he was a great dad.  It&#39;s not what he got.  What he got was people saying his <br/>
kid was right, and a good kid, and needed a great dad.<br/>
<br/>
But the very idea that we had no way of knowing anything about his situation <br/>
or what the level of regard for his child was was bigtime delusional on his <br/>
part.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to read that, if you go to the last entries, all the <br/>
original/previous show up at the top.  If I send you to the first set, it won&#39;t show <br/>
later ones.   It&#39;s here:<br/>

And the last word (a good one!) was on Friday:<br/>
------------------------<br/>
Live in your son&#39;s world for awhile, really get to know who he is now. Stop <br/>
waiting for him to be who you want him to be. <br/>
