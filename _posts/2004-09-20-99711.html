<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236426692">ugh.  in reaching out to our local homeschool group, i found that a lot<br/>
of families are calling what they do with their families unschooling even<br/>
though it looks nothing like what we talk about here!  lots of<br/>
planned/imposed activities, restricted tv, computer, food, etc.  how<br/>
disappointing!<br/>

Unschooling is not schooling. I&#39;m very very happy when people get that <br/>
far and their kids have the freedom to follow their interests with <br/>
their parents&#39; support, even if their parents plan some activities for <br/>
them and insist on certain things, I&#39;m happy when they&#39;re not insisting <br/>
on an imposed-curriculum, doing assignments, taking tests, being <br/>
graded. The rest of what we talk about here - all the further <br/>
ramifications of applying what we&#39;ve learned from unschooling to the <br/>
non-academic areas of life - some of us pick that up and run with it, <br/>
others pick it up more slowly, some not at all. But to NOT school a <br/>
child is a rare and wonderful thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505214611">good point...i&#39;m always happy to see the diversity in people&#39;s approaches<br/>
to growing with their kids and even happier when i see respectful<br/>
exchanges between them.  i just wish i had more people that i could enjoy<br/>
in person who made choices like us. it gets old being SO different all of<br/>
the time. <br/>
<br/>
still kinda bummed in IL,<br/>

closer to you in practice, and open-minded, and convert them over to <br/>

You can invite some unschooling missionaries to your neck of the woods <br/>

I&#39;m KIDDING -everybody - I&#39;m NOT personally on a mission to convert <br/>
people against their will, okay?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061184228">This is how I came to unschooling.  I was a die hard school at home person. .  Said that I could never unschool, I need a routine.  I then met a woman who unschools her children.  We spent time with her and her family and saw how it does work.  Found out later that she was a moderator on this list.  Definitely  a radical unschooler.  I am now totally over to &quot;the dark side&quot;!! Over the course of a year or so, went from having control on TV, food, bedtime, video games and everything else, to total freedom for my almost 7yo son.  The best change we have ever made!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-967641647">haha...i&#39;m doing my best to pull them over to the darkside!  i feel like<br/>
i&#39;m a walking ad for unschooling sometimes.  and i only hope i&#39;m not<br/>
turning away more people than i&#39;m attracting.  it&#39;s hard to ignore that<br/>
it&#39;s effective when you look at kids who are raised on it (like<br/>
mine)...and even our extended family is turning around a bit.  i think<br/>
they all assume that i&#39;m kidding about not having some sort of plan or<br/>
curriculum though.  their minds won&#39;t bend that direction yet.  time will<br/>
tell if they ever do!<br/>
