I am saying it is important to offer your best theories to your<br/>
children.  I am saying that no one needs stress imposed on them . . .<br/>
life, unfortunately, does this just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, sharing one&#39;s best theories with a child, and being completely<br/>
honest with them, allows the child to use his or her own mind to come to<br/>
conclusions about his or her own life and body.  This actually gives the<br/>
child a better foundation for facing the real world.  The child has been<br/>
making decisions all along, and therefore, the real world is less scary<br/>
and stressful.<br/>
<br/>
I am saying that there are possible win-win situations for all involved<br/>
in every situation.<br/>
<br/>
Take the teeth example.   I would definitely offer one&#39;s best theories<br/>
to their child regarding tooth brushing.  If they were interested, I<br/>
would buy a tooth paste they might like, show them how to brush in front<br/>
of their favorite TV show, tell them the possible consequences of<br/>
improper brushing, offer chewing gum, tell them about the benefits of<br/>
eating lots of carrots, take them to talk with a dentist.  I am saying<br/>
to give all the information that you have available to your children.  I<br/>
have noticed that the lack of coercion allows children to make informed<br/>
decisions.  These children are not rebelling.  They are not having to<br/>
decipher between facts and lies.  The children I know who have<br/>
information backing them make very logical decisions.  They also like to<br/>
be around adults that are their friends.  They like too brush side by<br/>
side, or take baths together, or say please and thank you because the<br/>
adults in their life model good behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I am advocating giving children some credit, letting them use their<br/>
minds, trusting them.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching an interested party is not setting boundaries, imo.  Take the<br/>
car.  A child who is learning to drive will probably be eager to learn,<br/>
keep themselves and the family car safe.  A hypothetical teen in the US<br/>
probably has a pretty good idea what accepted road rules are. If this<br/>
same teen, for some reason, doesn&#39;t like, say, going slow, a parent<br/>
might show the teen a wide, open, empty space where the two can practice<br/>
going fast in a safe manner.  They might also practice going slow, or<br/>
not signaling.  If this child really likes speed, the parent might help<br/>
them go sky diving or take racing lessons, or, well, the list is<br/>
endless.  The point is the teen can learn safety and also satisfy other<br/>
desires.  The parent and child would probably talk a lot about cause and<br/>
effect.  The teen would set their own boundaries because they have<br/>
learned to trust their own judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I am not advocating laissez faire parenting.  What I am talking about is<br/>
aware, kind and honest parenting.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I always tried to bring my kids up to be Independant.  When they were <br/>
young they decided what they wanted to wear, and believe me that was <br/>
*fashion* in itself!  They chose their own friends. Older kids went <br/>
to ps - but they decided if they would do the home work or not. They <br/>
knew the consiquences(sp) if it wasn&#39;t completed.  We did have <br/>
bounderies and a few rules - but these were safty rules more than <br/>
anything. <br/>
I dont ever remember actually *showing* any of my kids how to brush <br/>
their teeth - they just did it.  3 of my adult children have never <br/>
had a filling or a tooth pulled. One of these 3 was a real sweet <br/>
tooth as a child, ate more lollies (candies?)than any child should, <br/>
and still has beautiful teeth (another myth out the window!) My <br/>
youngest dd 12yrs old.  Has never had a filling or a tooth pulled. <br/>
Her second teeth grew before her baby teeth fell out, some times <br/>
pushing the baby tooth out - some times growing behind or infront of <br/>
the baby tooth, and remained there untill her baby tooth became lose.<br/>
<br/>
So my kids were all brought up the same.  Some suffer from stress <br/>
some dont.  so I think it all depends on the person themselves to how <br/>
much stress they will encounter.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I equate artificial, imposed, and arbitrary boundaries to an<br/>
unhappy child in a given moment.  Continued use of these artificial<br/>
boundaries probably could lead to a miserable childhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But studies *also* show that permissive parenting<br/>

&gt; procrastination, lowered achievement motivation, goal<br/>
&gt; avoidance, lowered self esteem, dysfunctional/avoidant<br/>
&gt; coping skills, as well as a dysfunctional ability to<br/>
&gt; assess the reasons for low achievement and frustration<br/>
&gt; (external assessment, leading to goal avoidance and<br/>
&gt; feelings of helplessness and anger).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have also read about permissive parenting, and that is not what I am<br/>
talking about.  I am talking about alleviating as much stress as<br/>
possible from the lives of everyone in my family, not imposing it.  I am<br/>
also talking about respecting the wishes of the children in my life.<br/>
<br/>
The approach is not one of do nothing (permissive) or of control<br/>
(authoritarian).  The idea of taking children seriously does not fit any<br/>
of the three approaches (permissive, authoritative, authoritarian).<br/>
Taking children seriously is not self-sacrifice or narcissism.  Common<br/>
preferences are about helping the entire family, in their individual<br/>
endeavors, find happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a permissive parent, I am a parent involved moment by moment in<br/>
a child&#39;s life.  I strive to make each of our moments happy for both us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232329712"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Can you explain what stress they are getting naturally if you are<br/>
&gt; removing<br/>
&gt; all boundaries<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you explain what stress you get naturally without having an<br/>
arbitrary boundary adding to it?  Can you see how the world offers a<br/>
fair amount of stress naturally?  Why the need for artificial<br/>
boundaries?  Would you like it if your husband, say, thought you needed<br/>
just a little more stress because, well, you hadn&#39;t learned it well<br/>
enough when you were a child?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and believe that simple lessons in living in the real world<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be taught?  What, &quot;he took my toy&quot; or &quot;waaaa, my Barbie<br/>
&gt; broke?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t believe that simple lessons are not learned.  Sometimes a broken<br/>
toy is lesson enough... I don&#39;t need to teach that.  What, exactly, is<br/>
your question?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As to being sent to bed when a parent determined the time, there are<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; than one type of doing this.  The arbitrary, &quot;it is 9 p.m., you will<br/>
&gt; go to<br/>
&gt; bed&quot; and the parent who is aware of a child who gets beyond the point<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; knowing their are tired and keeps going like they are in a race with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Energizer bunny.  I have one of those and I send her to bed.  The<br/>
&gt; minute her<br/>
&gt; head hits the pillow she is out.  If you don&#39;t send her to bed, she<br/>
&gt; gets<br/>
&gt; physically ill.  I&#39;m thinking the &quot;stress&quot; of being sent to bed is<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; for her than the &quot;stress&quot; of vomiting and spending a day in bed with a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; fever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does one make themselves sick when they are tired?  Certainly this<br/>
is not typical behavior.  I actually know a two year old who has had a<br/>
complete absence of coercion regarding bedtime.  She will say she is<br/>
tired at 7:30 or 10:30, when she is tired.  She walks herself to bed and<br/>
may or may not ask for an adult to accompany her.  Certainly a person<br/>
will be able to determine how tired they feel.  A brand new infant<br/>
sleeps when he or she is tired, no one had to teach this baby how to<br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &quot;thank<br/>
&gt; you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you sure?  A child mimics behavior of adults naturally.  That is how<br/>
they learn to talk, walk, eat, etc.  I know children who say please and<br/>
thank you naturally.  They also like to discuss manners and occasionally<br/>
experiment with exceedingly good manners to see people smile, act<br/>
impressed, or give them a compliment.  Children, I believe, are born<br/>
inherently good, they like to see people smile, feel proud of<br/>
themselves, have friends.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Quite frankly, without any of the very minimal boundaries talked<br/>
&gt; about, I&#39;m not thinking the child is going to grow up to be a very<br/>
&gt; &quot;nice&quot;<br/>
&gt; person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Frankly, children with truths behind them seem nicer than very coerced<br/>
and controlled children who may be bullies in the absence of adults.<br/>
These children are able to talk intelligently about being nice or being<br/>
mean.  But, really, the point is not whether or not they are nice, but<br/>
rather if they are respected as individuals and complete beings.<br/>
Children who see respect, learn it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Part of the problem, IMHO, with the world today is that society is too<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; narcistic.  Parents who lived through WWII went out of their way to<br/>
&gt; give,<br/>
&gt; give, give to their kids and now we seeing a whole load of folks that<br/>
&gt; are so<br/>
&gt; materialistic that, quite frankly, it sucks!  And their kids are<br/>
&gt; spoiled<br/>
&gt; brats that no one wants to be around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does materialism have to do with this conversation?  Do you think<br/>
children who are able to intelligently discuss money, materialism, even<br/>
WWII will grow up materialistic?  I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t see the<br/>
correlation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Living in a group and learning give and take is not going to rob any<br/>
&gt; child<br/>
&gt; of their childhood or happiness.  Learning to share is not a<br/>
&gt; detrimental<br/>
&gt; stress.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think a child won&#39;t learn to share if they are respected?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wouln&#39;t go so far as to say a spoiled brat is in for a miserable<br/>
&gt; life, but<br/>
&gt; they sure are in for a rude awakening because the rest of the world<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; going to cater to their unrealistic expectations of being catered to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children who are raised finding common preferences will grow up wanting<br/>
to find common preferences with others.  This is most certainly not<br/>
being catered to.  Also, isn&#39;t spoiled something left to rot?  How does<br/>
one get spoiled by unconditional love and respect?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems cruel to cater to a child&#39;s every whim and then expect them<br/>
&gt; to be<br/>
&gt; able to handle real life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is not about catering to a child&#39;s every whim.  It is about<br/>
respecting a child&#39;s autonomy.  It is about searching for ways to make<br/>
everyone in the family happy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>
&gt; other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping,<br/>
&gt; get your<br/>
&gt; shoes on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What if the child really doesn&#39;t want to go shopping.  If there is<br/>
another option, what will the child learn from being forced to go?  I<br/>
have noticed that most kids like going on outings, though, so this is<br/>
probably a non issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make<br/>
&gt; alternate<br/>
&gt; arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The rest of the world might like to have a delivered pizza rather than a<br/>
home-made meal, though.  The rest of the world might like their<br/>
preferences acknowledged as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have met quite a few unschoolers, several of whom are currently<br/>
&gt; attending<br/>
&gt; college.  All had some basic social boundaries taught and were<br/>
&gt; expected to<br/>
&gt; be contributing members of the family unit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do you think a child will not want to help in the house if they are<br/>
not told to do so?  Might a child like to vacuum and dust?  I know I<br/>
love to vacuum and not because my Mom stands behind me telling me it<br/>
must be done.  I know lots of kids who like to garden, paint, arrange<br/>
shoes, fold clothes, wash windows, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They don&#39;t consider that to be<br/>
&gt; a contributing factor to any childhood unhappiness.  In fact, when I<br/>
&gt; asked a<br/>
&gt; friend&#39;s daughter (she is now 22 and attending Stanford), she looked<br/>
&gt; at me<br/>
&gt; like I had a screw loose, &quot;Yeah, we had one of *those&quot; in my freshman<br/>
&gt; class,<br/>
&gt; he lasted about 3 months and dropped out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of those what?  Respected kids.  Are you saying that a child who<br/>
grows up respected will not be motivated?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In speaking of imposing inconvenience on others in<br/>
order to indulge a child&#39;s whim to play for a bit<br/>
longer (I would say that making someone waste extra<br/>
time, effort and money in driving back and forth,<br/>
imposing your child on a neighbor or friend, wasting<br/>
money on a babysitter that could more reasonably be<br/>

or expecting the entire family to starve until your<br/>
child *feels* like going to the store is imposing<br/>
inconvenience on others) rather than explaining to the<br/>
child that s/he is part of a family/wider community<br/>
and that compromise is sometimes necessary in order to<br/>
promote the common good and in order to incline others<br/>
to occasionally compromise on your behalf *is*<br/>
permissive parenting.  It fits the definition of<br/>
permissive parenting provided by the studies, which<br/>
may in your case not impose stress on your family, but<br/>
which has been shown is studies to frequently result<br/>
in stress for the entire family.  <br/>
<br/>
And while your example seems reasonable to you, it<br/>
seems arbitrary and unfair to me, as it involves<br/>
respecting the wishes of one person over the wishes of<br/>
others either on the basis of age or on the basis of<br/>
their having originated from your body.<br/>

&gt; or of control<br/>
&gt; (authoritarian).  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Permissive parenting is not Doing Nothing... there are<br/>
two styles of permissive parenting; in several of the<br/>
studies these two permissive styles were examined as<br/>
seperate, though related, styles.  As I mentioned in<br/>
my post.  I attributed the warm/responsive type to<br/>
your description of your preferred actions, rather<br/>
than the neglectful type.  As I also mentioned in my<br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of taking children<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; seriously does not fit any<br/>
&gt; of the three approaches (permissive, authoritative,<br/>
&gt; authoritarian).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>According to the descriptions in the studies, all<br/>
three parenting styles *can* take children very<br/>
seriously indeed, and taking children and their needs<br/>
seriously is inherent in the Authoritative approach. <br/>
If one is going to get meaning out of studies, one<br/>
must use their definition of terms.  We could say that<br/>
their studies are not useful because they use<br/>
different definitions than *you* would use... but then<br/>
what useful conclusions could be reached thereby?  You<br/>
were the one who said you would be interested to read<br/>
the studies, I provided some sources.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Taking children seriously is not self-sacrifice or<br/>
&gt; narcissism.  Common<br/>
&gt; preferences are about helping the entire family, in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes preferences are *not* common, and then one<br/>
must either give to one side, the other, or<br/>
compromise.  You are, at least in your example,<br/>
consistantly giving in to the whims/wishes of one<br/>
person and inconveniencing others in the process. <br/>
That is not equitable treatment.  It goes beyond<br/>
&#39;taking children seriously&#39;... or perhaps takes *them*<br/>
seriously but doesn&#39;t take anyone *else* seriously. <br/>
What is your definition of narcissism?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not a permissive parent, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I go by the definitions in the studies (this seems<br/>
reasonable, as they coined the prases in the first<br/>
place), and by your descriptions of what you would do<br/>
in the particular instances cited.  By their<br/>
definition, what you describe is permissive parenting.<br/>
 You, of course, could be using a different<br/>
definition, but that makes discourse on the issue<br/>
rather difficult.<br/>
<br/>
I am a parent involved<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In what way do you think that people who choose<br/>
different ways of dealing with children than yourself<br/>
*not* involved moment by moment in their child&#39;s life<br/>
or *not* striving to make the lives of all involved<br/>
happy?<br/>

hurt.  I am truly sorry if I misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She equates having boundaries to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I equate artificial, imposed, and arbitrary boundaries to an<br/>
unhappy child in a given moment.  Continued use of these artificial<br/>
boundaries probably could lead to a miserable childhood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But studies *also* show that permissive parenting<br/>
&gt; often leads to immaturity, lack of impulse control,<br/>

&gt; procrastination, lowered achievement motivation, goal<br/>
&gt; avoidance, lowered self esteem, dysfunctional/avoidant<br/>
&gt; coping skills, as well as a dysfunctional ability to<br/>
&gt; assess the reasons for low achievement and frustration<br/>
&gt; (external assessment, leading to goal avoidance and<br/>
&gt; feelings of helplessness and anger).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have also read about permissive parenting, and that is not what I am<br/>
talking about.  I am talking about alleviating as much stress as<br/>
possible from the lives of everyone in my family, not imposing it.  I am<br/>
also talking about respecting the wishes of the children in my life.<br/>
<br/>
The approach is not one of do nothing (permissive) or of control<br/>
(authoritarian).  The idea of taking children seriously does not fit any<br/>
of the three approaches (permissive, authoritative, authoritarian).<br/>
Taking children seriously is not self-sacrifice or narcissism.  Common<br/>
preferences are about helping the entire family, in their individual<br/>
endeavors, find happiness.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a permissive parent, I am a parent involved moment by moment in<br/>
a child&#39;s life.  I strive to make each of our moments happy for both us.<br/>

&gt; imposing your child on a neighbor or friend, wasting<br/>
&gt; money on a babysitter that could more reasonably be<br/>
&gt; spent on things that would benefit the entire family,<br/>
&gt; or expecting the entire family to starve until your<br/>
&gt; child *feels* like going to the store is imposing<br/>
&gt; inconvenience on others)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe there is a solution which would not be construed as imposing an<br/>
inconvenience.  Grandmothers in our family, for instance, love to have<br/>
the opportunity to come play with a child while parents run errands.<br/>
Sometimes parent prefers to leave a child who doesn&#39;t like errands at<br/>
home or with a neighbor who likes trading child care.  In this case, the<br/>
decision to go to the store alone is a common preference.  Again, I am<br/>
not advocating sacrifice on the behalf of anyone.  The goal is to find a<br/>
preference for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rather than explaining to the<br/>
&gt; child that s/he is part of a family/wider community<br/>

&gt; to occasionally compromise on your behalf *is*<br/>
&gt; permissive parenting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am happy for you, if compromise works for you.  I tend to try to find<br/>
a way which allows *everyone* to get what they want.  Lots of creative<br/>
ideas may eliminate the need for sacrifice on any person&#39;s part.  It is<br/>
not permissive parenting, if all parties are happy with the outcome.<br/>
Even the gentle permissive parenting the &quot;studies&quot; refer to, involves<br/>
parental sacrifice for the good of the child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It fits the definition of<br/>
&gt; permissive parenting provided by the studies, which<br/>
&gt; may in your case not impose stress on your family, but<br/>
&gt; which has been shown is studies to frequently result<br/>
&gt; in stress for the entire family.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See above.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And while your example seems reasonable to you, it<br/>
&gt; seems arbitrary and unfair to me, as it involves<br/>
&gt; respecting the wishes of one person over the wishes of<br/>
&gt; others either on the basis of age or on the basis of<br/>
&gt; their having originated from your body.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again, the wishes of *everyone* are weighed equally and the goal is<br/>
to find a preference which each person finds genuinely appealing and<br/>
preferable.  The child is not given any more or less respect than the<br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; According to the descriptions in the studies, all<br/>
&gt; three parenting styles *can* take children very<br/>
&gt; seriously indeed, and taking children and their needs<br/>
&gt; seriously is inherent in the Authoritative approach.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still claim that imposing artificial boundaries is not taking children<br/>
seriously.  I call that lying.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If one is going to get meaning out of studies, one<br/>
&gt; must use their definition of terms.  We could say that<br/>
&gt; their studies are not useful because they use<br/>
&gt; different definitions than *you* would use... but then<br/>
&gt; what useful conclusions could be reached thereby?  You<br/>
&gt; were the one who said you would be interested to read<br/>
&gt; the studies, I provided some sources.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want a study that says children need parents to impose stress.  The<br/>
authors to which you refer talk about parenting styles.  None, that I am<br/>
aware of, say, &quot;Jane needs a parent to give her stress in order to<br/>
handle the world effectively.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes preferences are *not* common, and then one<br/>
&gt; must either give to one side, the other, or<br/>
&gt; compromise.<br/>

I am happy with the outcomes of our decisions.  I try to make sure I am<br/>
not self-sacrificing (which I believe begets resentment, but that is<br/>
another post).  I don&#39;t believe I have ever inconvenienced another<br/>
person in this approach to parenting.  We may have to sit and think<br/>
creatively for some time before a common preference is reached, but when<br/>
we really try, we have always succeeded.  I am not saying that I am<br/>
perfect.  I have imposed my will before.  I have, in that circumstance,<br/>

similar circumstances.  I am still learning.  I hope I am always<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750630673">Obviously someone does not have an answer when a question is answered with a<br/>
question that mirrors the initial question.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to make this simple, you stated they get enough stress naturally<br/>
without placing boundaries on them.<br/>
<br/>
I asked, what stress do they get naturally when you have removed all<br/>
boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
To which you replied &quot;&gt; Can you explain what stress you get naturally<br/>
without having an arbitrary boundary adding to it?&quot;  Hello, I believe that<br/>
was my question.  What stress are they getting naturally without any<br/>
boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
So, again, if there are no boundaries to your child exactly what stress is<br/>
the world putting on them.  What, they have to decide between an orange and<br/>
apple for lunch?  Or an extreme decision between Legos and Sesame Street?<br/>
<br/>
And I really think your comment about a husband was silly, to say the least.<br/>
If nothing else, it was non-responsive.<br/>
<br/>
As to a child going to sleep when they are tired, that is not a given nor is<br/>
it even a norm, including infants.  That happens in some children and in a<br/>
perfect world without outside stimuli.  Hey, I&#39;m betting that is why mothers<br/>
try to make a quiet space for infants to sleep in, ya know, no loud noises,<br/>
pull the blinds, that sort of thing.  But maybe they shouldn&#39;t do this since<br/>
that is arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you know one child who does this.  I&#39;ve known dozens that don&#39;t.<br/>
And quite a few that get so tired that they can make themselves physically<br/>
ill.  Sometimes it is a positive thing for someone to be looking out for the<br/>
well-being of another.  Of course, that would be in a world where everything<br/>
isn&#39;t black and white.<br/>
<br/>
The problem here is that all children are not the same and your ideas are no<br/>
different than ps and are exactly what you are railing against others<br/>
about--arbitrary.  Each child needs to be looked at as an individual.  What<br/>
works for one may not work for another.  What works for one style of<br/>
parenting may not work for another.  What may be defined as a &quot;spoiled brat&quot;<br/>
in one person&#39;s eyes may be just peachy in another&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
And boundaries are not the only environment that creates bullies.  One of<br/>
the worst little creeps in our neighborhood was raised exactly as you<br/>
describe--loving, nurturing, family meetings to make decisions,<br/>
homeschooled, no coersion, etc., etc., etc.  This kid is sly and he is nasty<br/>
and he has parent manipulation down to a fine science.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, it isn&#39;t all black and white and any given parenting method won&#39;t<br/>
work the same on all children, nor will it work for all children.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; Can you explain what stress they are getting naturally if you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; removing<br/>
&gt; &gt; all boundaries<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you explain what stress you get naturally without having an<br/>
&gt; arbitrary boundary adding to it?  Can you see how the world offers a<br/>
&gt; fair amount of stress naturally?  Why the need for artificial<br/>
&gt; boundaries?  Would you like it if your husband, say, thought you needed<br/>
&gt; just a little more stress because, well, you hadn&#39;t learned it well<br/>
&gt; enough when you were a child?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and believe that simple lessons in living in the real world<br/>
&gt; &gt; shouldn&#39;t be taught?  What, &quot;he took my toy&quot; or &quot;waaaa, my Barbie<br/>
&gt; &gt; broke?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe that simple lessons are not learned.  Sometimes a broken<br/>
&gt; toy is lesson enough... I don&#39;t need to teach that.  What, exactly, is<br/>
&gt; your question?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; As to being sent to bed when a parent determined the time, there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; than one type of doing this.  The arbitrary, &quot;it is 9 p.m., you will<br/>
&gt; &gt; go to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bed&quot; and the parent who is aware of a child who gets beyond the point<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowing their are tired and keeps going like they are in a race with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Energizer bunny.  I have one of those and I send her to bed.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; minute her<br/>
&gt; &gt; head hits the pillow she is out.  If you don&#39;t send her to bed, she<br/>
&gt; &gt; gets<br/>
&gt; &gt; physically ill.  I&#39;m thinking the &quot;stress&quot; of being sent to bed is<br/>
&gt; &gt; better<br/>
&gt; &gt; for her than the &quot;stress&quot; of vomiting and spending a day in bed with a<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; fever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why does one make themselves sick when they are tired?  Certainly this<br/>
&gt; is not typical behavior.  I actually know a two year old who has had a<br/>
&gt; complete absence of coercion regarding bedtime.  She will say she is<br/>
&gt; tired at 7:30 or 10:30, when she is tired.  She walks herself to bed and<br/>
&gt; may or may not ask for an adult to accompany her.  Certainly a person<br/>
&gt; will be able to determine how tired they feel.  A brand new infant<br/>
&gt; sleeps when he or she is tired, no one had to teach this baby how to<br/>
&gt; sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And, children do not &quot;naturally&quot; use phrases such as &quot;please&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;thank<br/>
&gt; &gt; you.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are you sure?  A child mimics behavior of adults naturally.  That is how<br/>
&gt; they learn to talk, walk, eat, etc.  I know children who say please and<br/>
&gt; thank you naturally.  They also like to discuss manners and occasionally<br/>
&gt; experiment with exceedingly good manners to see people smile, act<br/>
&gt; impressed, or give them a compliment.  Children, I believe, are born<br/>
&gt; inherently good, they like to see people smile, feel proud of<br/>
&gt; themselves, have friends.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Quite frankly, without any of the very minimal boundaries talked<br/>
&gt; &gt; about, I&#39;m not thinking the child is going to grow up to be a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;nice&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Frankly, children with truths behind them seem nicer than very coerced<br/>
&gt; and controlled children who may be bullies in the absence of adults.<br/>
&gt; These children are able to talk intelligently about being nice or being<br/>
&gt; mean.  But, really, the point is not whether or not they are nice, but<br/>
&gt; rather if they are respected as individuals and complete beings.<br/>
&gt; Children who see respect, learn it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Part of the problem, IMHO, with the world today is that society is too<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; narcistic.  Parents who lived through WWII went out of their way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; give,<br/>
&gt; &gt; give, give to their kids and now we seeing a whole load of folks that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are so<br/>
&gt; &gt; materialistic that, quite frankly, it sucks!  And their kids are<br/>
&gt; &gt; spoiled<br/>
&gt; &gt; brats that no one wants to be around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What does materialism have to do with this conversation?  Do you think<br/>
&gt; children who are able to intelligently discuss money, materialism, even<br/>
&gt; WWII will grow up materialistic?  I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t see the<br/>
&gt; correlation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Living in a group and learning give and take is not going to rob any<br/>
&gt; &gt; child<br/>
&gt; &gt; of their childhood or happiness.  Learning to share is not a<br/>
&gt; &gt; detrimental<br/>
&gt; &gt; stress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why do you think a child won&#39;t learn to share if they are respected?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wouln&#39;t go so far as to say a spoiled brat is in for a miserable<br/>
&gt; &gt; life, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; they sure are in for a rude awakening because the rest of the world<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to cater to their unrealistic expectations of being catered to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Children who are raised finding common preferences will grow up wanting<br/>
&gt; to find common preferences with others.  This is most certainly not<br/>
&gt; being catered to.  Also, isn&#39;t spoiled something left to rot?  How does<br/>
&gt; one get spoiled by unconditional love and respect?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It seems cruel to cater to a child&#39;s every whim and then expect them<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to handle real life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is not about catering to a child&#39;s every whim.  It is about<br/>
&gt; respecting a child&#39;s autonomy.  It is about searching for ways to make<br/>
&gt; everyone in the family happy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The real world isn&#39;t going to run around finding<br/>
&gt; &gt; other options for something as simple as &quot;it&#39;s time to go shopping,<br/>
&gt; &gt; get your<br/>
&gt; &gt; shoes on.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What if the child really doesn&#39;t want to go shopping.  If there is<br/>
&gt; another option, what will the child learn from being forced to go?  I<br/>
&gt; have noticed that most kids like going on outings, though, so this is<br/>
&gt; probably a non issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The rest of the world isn&#39;t going to say,&quot;oh, I&#39;m sorry this<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t suit your needs, I&#39;ll pospone the family&#39;s needs or make<br/>
&gt; &gt; alternate<br/>
&gt; &gt; arrangements so that I don&#39;t inconvenience your play time.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The rest of the world might like to have a delivered pizza rather than a<br/>
&gt; home-made meal, though.  The rest of the world might like their<br/>
&gt; preferences acknowledged as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have met quite a few unschoolers, several of whom are currently<br/>
&gt; &gt; attending<br/>
&gt; &gt; college.  All had some basic social boundaries taught and were<br/>
&gt; &gt; expected to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be contributing members of the family unit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why do you think a child will not want to help in the house if they are<br/>
&gt; not told to do so?  Might a child like to vacuum and dust?  I know I<br/>
&gt; love to vacuum and not because my Mom stands behind me telling me it<br/>
&gt; must be done.  I know lots of kids who like to garden, paint, arrange<br/>
&gt; shoes, fold clothes, wash windows, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They don&#39;t consider that to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; a contributing factor to any childhood unhappiness.  In fact, when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked a<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260355127">You&#39;ve have danced all around the stress issue.  How do you define stress?<br/>
Is it anything that the child doesn&#39;t want to do?<br/>
<br/>
And, &quot;artificial&quot; boundaries = lying?  Exactly what do you define as<br/>
artificial boudaries?  Bedtime?  How exactly is that lying?<br/>

&gt; &gt; In speaking of imposing inconvenience on others in<br/>
&gt; &gt; order to indulge a child&#39;s whim to play for a bit<br/>
&gt; &gt; longer (I would say that making someone waste extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; time, effort and money in driving back and forth,<br/>
&gt; &gt; imposing your child on a neighbor or friend, wasting<br/>
&gt; &gt; money on a babysitter that could more reasonably be<br/>
&gt; &gt; spent on things that would benefit the entire family,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or expecting the entire family to starve until your<br/>
&gt; &gt; child *feels* like going to the store is imposing<br/>
&gt; &gt; inconvenience on others)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe there is a solution which would not be construed as imposing an<br/>
&gt; inconvenience.  Grandmothers in our family, for instance, love to have<br/>
&gt; the opportunity to come play with a child while parents run errands.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes parent prefers to leave a child who doesn&#39;t like errands at<br/>
&gt; home or with a neighbor who likes trading child care.  In this case, the<br/>
&gt; decision to go to the store alone is a common preference.  Again, I am<br/>
&gt; not advocating sacrifice on the behalf of anyone.  The goal is to find a<br/>
&gt; preference for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather than explaining to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; child that s/he is part of a family/wider community<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that compromise is sometimes necessary in order to<br/>
&gt; &gt; promote the common good and in order to incline others<br/>
&gt; &gt; to occasionally compromise on your behalf *is*<br/>
&gt; &gt; permissive parenting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am happy for you, if compromise works for you.  I tend to try to find<br/>
&gt; a way which allows *everyone* to get what they want.  Lots of creative<br/>
&gt; ideas may eliminate the need for sacrifice on any person&#39;s part.  It is<br/>
&gt; not permissive parenting, if all parties are happy with the outcome.<br/>
&gt; Even the gentle permissive parenting the &quot;studies&quot; refer to, involves<br/>
&gt; parental sacrifice for the good of the child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It fits the definition of<br/>
&gt; &gt; permissive parenting provided by the studies, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; may in your case not impose stress on your family, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; which has been shown is studies to frequently result<br/>
&gt; &gt; in stress for the entire family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; See above.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And while your example seems reasonable to you, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; seems arbitrary and unfair to me, as it involves<br/>
&gt; &gt; respecting the wishes of one person over the wishes of<br/>
&gt; &gt; others either on the basis of age or on the basis of<br/>
&gt; &gt; their having originated from your body.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once again, the wishes of *everyone* are weighed equally and the goal is<br/>
&gt; to find a preference which each person finds genuinely appealing and<br/>
&gt; preferable.  The child is not given any more or less respect than the<br/>
&gt; adults.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; According to the descriptions in the studies, all<br/>
&gt; &gt; three parenting styles *can* take children very<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously indeed, and taking children and their needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously is inherent in the Authoritative approach.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I still claim that imposing artificial boundaries is not taking children<br/>
&gt; seriously.  I call that lying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If one is going to get meaning out of studies, one<br/>
&gt; &gt; must use their definition of terms.  We could say that<br/>
&gt; &gt; their studies are not useful because they use<br/>
&gt; &gt; different definitions than *you* would use... but then<br/>
&gt; &gt; what useful conclusions could be reached thereby?  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; were the one who said you would be interested to read<br/>
&gt; &gt; the studies, I provided some sources.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want a study that says children need parents to impose stress.  The<br/>
&gt; authors to which you refer talk about parenting styles.  None, that I am<br/>
&gt; aware of, say, &quot;Jane needs a parent to give her stress in order to<br/>
&gt; handle the world effectively.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes preferences are *not* common, and then one<br/>
&gt; &gt; must either give to one side, the other, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; compromise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I assert there is always a way to find a common preference.  Again, I<br/>
&gt; urge you to read through this site:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/index.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/index.html</a><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You are, at least in your example,<br/>
&gt; &gt; consistantly giving in to the whims/wishes of one<br/>
&gt; &gt; person and inconveniencing others in the process.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never &quot;give in.&quot;  I never &quot;let&quot; my child win.  I try to make sure that<br/>
&gt; I am happy with the outcomes of our decisions.  I try to make sure I am<br/>
&gt; not self-sacrificing (which I believe begets resentment, but that is<br/>
&gt; another post).  I don&#39;t believe I have ever inconvenienced another<br/>
&gt; person in this approach to parenting.  We may have to sit and think<br/>
&gt; creatively for some time before a common preference is reached, but when<br/>
&gt; we really try, we have always succeeded.  I am not saying that I am<br/>
&gt; perfect.  I have imposed my will before.  I have, in that circumstance,<br/>
&gt; said I was sorry and began brainstorming better solutions for future<br/>
&gt; similar circumstances.  I am still learning.  I hope I am always<br/>
&gt; searching for better ways to interact with the special people in my<br/>
&gt; life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That is not equitable treatment.  It goes beyond<br/>
&gt; &gt; &#39;taking children seriously&#39;... or perhaps takes *them*<br/>
&gt; &gt; seriously but doesn&#39;t take anyone *else* seriously.<br/>
&gt; &gt; What is your definition of narcissism?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Actually, it takes everyone seriously.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In what way do you think that people who choose<br/>
&gt; &gt; different ways of dealing with children than yourself<br/>
&gt; &gt; *not* involved moment by moment in their child&#39;s life<br/>
&gt; &gt; or *not* striving to make the lives of all involved<br/>
&gt; &gt; happy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe imposing one&#39;s will doesn&#39;t make people happy.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; understand this question.<br/>

however, has fallen more into a debate and I dont want to be part of it. I would<br/>
rather hear how each one of you are succeeding or the different troubles you&#39;ve<br/>
had. My oldest (6) is really looking forward to going to ps for first grade. My<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342201472"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;children get a pretty incredible amount of stress<br/>
&gt;naturally.  Nobody needs to impose it upon them.  I<br/>
&gt;also think it is a sad statement to say that a child<br/>
&gt;is in for a miserable life if they have a happy<br/>
&gt;childhood.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This subject has begun to reach me on a personal<br/>
level, so I thought I would take th time to reply<br/>
here.  I agree with the above, childhood is stressful,<br/>
in the extreme.  Learning about the world, making<br/>
embarrassing and painful mistakes, being treated<br/>
poorly by adults and other children alike sometimes,<br/>
and being constantly subjected to the will of others<br/>
is very stressful indeed.  I have very strong and<br/>
distinct memories of my childhood, going back to age<br/>
two, before which my memory is spotty.  I REMEMBER<br/>
what it feels like to be a child, and so I have<br/>
sympathy for children and try to see things from their<br/>
point of view. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When I hear of grown unschoolers, free schoolers,<br/>
&gt;and adults with relatively easy childhoods, I hear<br/>
&gt;of  people who seem happy and fulfilled..........that<br/>
&gt;bounce back from the burns and social ostracism<br/>
&gt;because these are the people with high self<br/>
&gt;esteems, ...........These are the people who can<br/>
&gt;handle<br/>
&gt;challenges because boundaries  weren&#39;t arbitrarily<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;crammed down their throats.<br/>
<br/>
Here again, I agree.  I came from a two parent, upper<br/>
middle class home.  But I had a terrible childhood,<br/>
because my home was also dysfunctional, abusive and<br/>
alcoholic.  My father was the disciplinarian, and you<br/>
had to walk around him on eggshells, never knowing<br/>
when his own stressful day or the wrong word or deed<br/>
would set off a beating or screaming tirade directed<br/>
at you.  But my father was also over emotional<br/>
(particularly when drunk), physically affectionate,<br/>
and expressed interest in our education.<br/>
<br/>
My mother was the ultimate in disinterested.  She had<br/>
her &quot;things&quot; and her social circle and could really<br/>
care less what we did.  She had no identity or self<br/>
esteem of her own, and no backbone.  When Dad was<br/>
working or away on business, which was often, we ran<br/>
wild, went where we wanted, were gone for days on end,<br/>
threw wild parties, and so on.  Mom either was not<br/>
around or did not care enough to fight with us.  She<br/>
never disciplined us, ever.  She often called me names<br/>
like &quot;stupid little slut&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot; but never<br/>
enforced any rules.<br/>
<br/>
So you can see that I had both extremes.  The totally<br/>
uninvolved and non-disciplining parent, and the<br/>
overbearing athoritarian parent.  Both were terrible. <br/>
I grew up hating my father for abusing and controlling<br/>
me, and hating my mother for not caring and not<br/>
acting.  Neither one felt supportive, and I grew up<br/>
with poor self esteem, poor anger management, and very<br/>
little ability to deal with stress, which I recieved<br/>
in such great quantity.  Not until my life was<br/>
happier, and I had done a great deal of healing and<br/>
reversal of the damage of my childhood was I better<br/>
able to deal with stress.  <br/>
<br/>
It is still a daily struggle, not to let the little<br/>
things overwhelm me.  As the child of an alcoholic, I<br/>
deal with a lot of guilt, anger, loss and depression. <br/>
I have had depression since I was a toddler.  When I<br/>
was still growing up, every little thing would send me<br/>
quaking and sobbing.  Now that I have a happy home and<br/>
healthy relationships around me, I have that resevoir<br/>
of strength from which to draw upon to help me through<br/>
the stress of daily life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; My son, for instance, finds it extremely stressful<br/>
&gt;&gt;to talk about or deal with learning social skills<br/>
&gt;&gt;such as meeting people&#39;s eyes, dealing with bullies,<br/>
&gt;&gt;making friendly advances to people, etc... but if I<br/>
&gt;&gt;indulge him in his avoidant behavior he will not<br/>
&gt;&gt;learn these things,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you really think of it as indulgant to let your<br/>
child be who he is, and express himself the way he<br/>
feels comfortable?  I was not a shy child, and spoke<br/>
my mind (still do) sometimes to my detriment, and<br/>
stepped right up to do drama, debate and spelling<br/>
bees.  But I have learned from life, and my many<br/>
hurts, to be more reticent, to hold back, to make<br/>
friends slowly and be shy in large groups or with new<br/>
people.  My parents were always telling everyone that<br/>
I was NOT SHY, and I was so bold, and I talked a lot,<br/>
and wasn&#39;t I a good little hostess and wasn&#39;t I funny.<br/>
 They forced me to answer the door for their large<br/>
company parties (100-300 people) and for smaller<br/>
dinner parties and social events.  They made me give<br/>
introductions and take coats and make conversation<br/>
with strange adults.  I am uncomfortable with my level<br/>
of socail interaction and am an artificially<br/>
introverted person.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was almost cripplingly shy as a child,<br/>
didn&#39;t speak up, had few friends, was awkward and<br/>
reserved.  He still is very shy and quiet, but has<br/>
learned, in his own time and way, to talk openly, make<br/>
friends, joke with acquaintances, and deal with larger<br/>
social settings without TOO much discomfort.  He had a<br/>
relatively loving and happy childhood, with supportive<br/>
parents who did not push him to be and do more than he<br/>
wanted.  He is comfortable with his level of<br/>
interaction and will always be an introverted person.<br/>
<br/>
We have one child who is very gregarious and<br/>
extroverted, dynamic and flambouyant.  We have another<br/>
who is just like his father, very sweet, and shy,<br/>
quiet and sensative.  I let them both be who they are,<br/>
and some days my &quot;introvert&quot; will talk off the ear of<br/>
another diner in a restaurant and my &quot;extrovert&quot; will<br/>
hide his face against me and not want to talk to his<br/>
own cousin.  I assume they will take on as much as<br/>
they are comfotable with in the course of their lives.<br/>
 If they do not like speaking in public, in front of<br/>
crowds, than they will avoid it and if they like to<br/>
act or perform in public they will seek it.  To each<br/>
his own, and there is not a &quot;required&quot; amount of<br/>
social interaction in our culture.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Or maybe, just like talking or walking, he would<br/>
&gt;learn these things on his own, when he felt &gt;ready.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here again, I agree, obviously.<br/>

children as well as adults.  Here are some examples of things that a<br/>
child may find stressful despite parent&#39;s best attempts:<br/>
<br/>
A death<br/>
A nightmare<br/>
A fight with a friend<br/>
moving<br/>
a new sibling<br/>
holidays<br/>
controlling relatives<br/>
judgmental neighbors<br/>
learning to fit into society and still be an individual<br/>
deciding to go to school or not<br/>
poverty<br/>
A parental argument<br/>
an illness<br/>
the doctor&#39;s office<br/>
crossing the street<br/>
rude store clerks<br/>
having to wait too long for food<br/>
saying good bye to a moving friend<br/>
Seeing a loved one get sick or old<br/>
divorce<br/>
coming to grips with the Universe and its immensity<br/>
The declining state of Mother Earth<br/>
People who don&#39;t recycle<br/>
Choosing a profession, or opting not to<br/>
A mean uncle<br/>
Acid rain<br/>
peer pressure<br/>
gangs<br/>
littering<br/>
drug addiction<br/>
alcoholism<br/>
marijuana being illegalized for medicinal purposes (just threw that in<br/>
since I&#39;ve been pretty good at opening the worm cans)<br/>
sexuality<br/>
being gay<br/>
being hetero<br/>
not sharing a religious belief with a community<br/>
being late<br/>
missing loved ones<br/>
teething<br/>
growing pains<br/>
consequences of their own decisions<br/>
being poor<br/>
starving children<br/>
orphanages<br/>
thoughts of kidnappers<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about the stresses in life that occur naturally or<br/>
unfortunately.  I find I am a happier person if I focus on the good.  I<br/>
try to show children as much happiness as I can.  This includes not<br/>
adding additional stress to an already stressful world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I really think your comment about a husband was silly, to say the<br/>

no one needs to impose stress on another individual.  I was actually<br/>
trying to be a little funny.  Poor attempt, I suppose.  Stress, and<br/>
don&#39;t we know it as mothers, comes naturally.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; try to make a quiet space for infants to sleep in, ya know, no loud<br/>
&gt; noises,<br/>
&gt; pull the blinds, that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, many children fall asleep in a sling with the whole world<br/>
doing its thing right around their heads.  I know kids who sleep through<br/>
dogs, siblings, talking, etc.  A lot of mothers choose to use a sling<br/>
for this reason alone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I&#39;m glad you know one child who does this.  I&#39;ve known dozens that<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; And quite a few that get so tired that they can make themselves<br/>
&gt; physically<br/>
&gt; ill.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry to hear that.  I thought falling asleep was natural.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes it is a positive thing for someone to be looking out for the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; well-being of another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel that I go above and beyond the call of looking out for the<br/>
well-being of others.  In fact, I think many parents don&#39;t look at what,<br/>
exactly, looking out for one&#39;s own means.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Of course, that would be in a world where everything<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t black and white.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually believe the world is many shades of gray.  Choosing to try to<br/>
find common preferences for all involved takes a lot of work.  It also<br/>
accounts for many personality styles and wishes.  Taking individual<br/>
preferences into account is definitely not a black and white issue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The problem here is that all children are not the same and your ideas<br/>
&gt; are no<br/>
&gt; different than ps and are exactly what you are railing against others<br/>
&gt; about--arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry.  I don&#39;t understand this statement.  I understand that every<br/>
child is a unique individual.  Common preferences honor the individual.<br/>
This is not about the easiest solution for the parent.  This is about<br/>
the action that will make all involved truly happy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Each child needs to be looked at as an individual.  What<br/>
&gt; works for one may not work for another.  What works for one style of<br/>
&gt; parenting may not work for another.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not talking about one style of parenting.  I am talking about<br/>
approaching each person as an individual.  If you think each child<br/>
should be approached differently, as an individual, and with care, we<br/>
must be on the same page, right?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What may be defined as a &quot;spoiled brat&quot;<br/>
&gt; in one person&#39;s eyes may be just peachy in another&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s true.  Most people I know that genuinely are looking out<br/>
for my best interests, strive to help me be happy, talk to me honestly,<br/>
are involved with me in the moment, emulate the good they see in others,<br/>
and are pretty happy themselves don&#39;t strike me as spoiled brats.  To<br/>
each his own, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And boundaries are not the only environment that creates bullies.  One<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the worst little creeps in our neighborhood was raised exactly as you<br/>
&gt; describe--loving, nurturing, family meetings to make decisions,<br/>
&gt; homeschooled, no coersion, etc., etc., etc.  This kid is sly and he is<br/>
&gt; nasty<br/>
&gt; and he has parent manipulation down to a fine science.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>His parents are probably self-sacrificing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As I said, it isn&#39;t all black and white and any given parenting method<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work the same on all children, nor will it work for all children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  That is why I am advocating that each parent look at each<br/>
child as an individual with individual desires which make that child<br/>
happy.<br/>

lying.  Saying, &quot;You have to go to bed,&quot; when one doesn&#39;t, is a lie.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; artificial boudaries?  Bedtime?  How exactly is that lying? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Parents have lied for years.  They say &quot;You have to get eight hours of sleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They say &quot;If you don&#39;t brush your teeth they will all fall out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They say &quot;If you don&#39;t go to school you won&#39;t learn how to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They say &quot;If you don&#39;t learn to get up and get to school on time you&#39;ll never <br/>
have a job.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most of them were saying that because their parents told them.<br/>
Most of them weren&#39;t thinking about what they were saying, they were <br/>
parroting acceptable statements in this culture without thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they weren&#39;t being liars, they were just being thoughtless.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they were too lazy to think through WHY they wanted those things done, <br/>
and how they could explain it in compassionate and truthful ways, or how they <br/>
could persuade the children to think the things were important.  <br/>
<br/>
Once part of the wall falls, there is no longer a solid wall.  If we don&#39;t <br/>
believe that tests and school are absolutely necesary for life on this <br/>
planet, we must question the other things.  The wall of traditional lies is <br/>
breached.  Do we build it back or try to live without the wall?<br/>

many different ways there really are to come at an issue with a <br/>
child, and how with some creativity, time, and thought, one can come <br/>
to a common preference. I think anyone who could keep an open mind <br/>
and not become defensive could benefit from reading the TCS site and <br/>
list. It certainly gave me a lot more ideas for my own parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725345927">I think fundamentalism can take on many forms and cover a wide range <br/>
of issues, TCS and unschooling included. Our world is not black or <br/>
white.  Must all unschooling parents practice common preferences or <br/>
TCS in order to qualify as true unschoolers, and be treated without <br/>
condescension?  As parents, we are all human and should, I think, be <br/>
respectful and understanding of the unique challenges of trying to do <br/>
what is best for our individual children. For example, many of the <br/>
pro-common preferences parents convey, to me, impression that they <br/>
are raising a &quot;superior&quot; brand of child by using a &quot;superior&quot; brand <br/>
of parenting while those of us who aren&#39;t are oppressive, coercive <br/>
throwbacks to the dark ages.  Those characterizations remind me very <br/>
much of the broadbrush preaching on the religious broadcasts I used <br/>
to listen to.  You know, &quot;All homosexuals are pedophiles, etc....&quot;</div>
