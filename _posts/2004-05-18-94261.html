<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to throw this out. It is possible to adopt a child and <br/>
later adopt that child out to someone else. A family in our community <br/>
adopted a little boy and after five years felt that he was too much for <br/>
them and adopted him out to another family. **Jaw-dropping** I couldn&#39;t <br/>
imagine how that was for the kids who stayed...<br/>
<br/>
I also have an adult friend who was abandonned at birth and adopted out <br/>
to two different families consecutively until she ended up in a home <br/>
for teens.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly possible to give up an adopted child, and to be honest, <br/>
I really don&#39;t understand it. (I know that isn&#39;t what this thread is <br/>
about, but I know this is a common misconception - many people never do <br/>
see their adopted children as the same as their biological children and <br/>
that&#39;s an important consideration *before* adopting).<br/>

<br/>
We have three.  I&#39;m totally overwhelmed right now, but they are little.  I<br/>
know it will get easier.  But there is NO WAY IN HELL I want more.  Not bio,<br/>
not adopted, not even FURRY!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve made a family &quot;rule&quot; that we will add no new pets to the family, not<br/>
even a goldfish, until we are down to two cats (from four) and there are no<br/>
children under the age of three.  I&#39;d like to extend that to no children in<br/>
diapers, but I think its too late.  Two of our cats are elderly and our<br/>
youngest kid is under a year.  So we are looking at at least two more years<br/>
until a new pet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not one of those who think it&#39;s bad to have big families.  IF you have<br/>
the capacity, and not just financially, to care for them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I got pregnant as fast as I did.  I had wanted to wait until about<br/>
now to have the last one, but...-sigh-  Those stresses will even out as they<br/>
get bigger.<br/>

I can see where after years of raising their children if one felt that way, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that the love given any child is never wasted.  But there are some<br/>
children that have been so traumatized that the amount of havoc they reap<br/>
within a family is very high price to pay for the other children in the<br/>
family, whether adopted or not.<br/>
<br/>
We had quite a few foster kids in our home.  They were all under 6.  We had<br/>
to ask that 2 be moved elsewhere because of their effect on the family.<br/>
They were 2 and 4.<br/>
<br/>
The girl was so jealous, so hurt by any attention given another child for<br/>
any reason, that she would go into their room and tear up their stuff.<br/>
Whenever she was angry, which was very often, she would purposefully urinate<br/>
on the carpet or smear feces all over her room.  She hallucinated and would<br/>
often just scream for no reason and it took a tremendous amount of time and<br/>
energy to calm her.<br/>
<br/>
The boy rarely slept.  He would run screaming across the room and attack<br/>
other kids for no discernable reason.  He kept forgetting we had a dog and<br/>
every time he would see it, he would be terrified and scream and scream.<br/>
<br/>
We had other kids in the home at the time, 2 that we had made a lifetime<br/>
committment to through adoption.  There simply wasn&#39;t enough of me left<br/>
after dealing with the foster kids so we had to ask that they be moved.  The<br/>
kids I had made the committment to had to come first.<br/>

commitment that one makes for their own children (whether bio or adopted) and it <br/>
shouldn&#39;t affect the home life, of the children that belong to the parents.  <br/>
They should come before any other children, foster children, classroom <br/>
children, Sunday school children, any other group of children the parent has made <br/>
time for in their life.<br/>
<br/>
Some things that happen to children might take a lifetime and still never be <br/>
able to be undone or even helped to a degree that makes them easy to live <br/>
with.  That&#39;s sad for the child but I do have a lot of admiration for the parents <br/>
who make the effort to foster children and treat them kind and lovingly, even <br/>
if it doesn&#39;t have a good ending.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure you do understand it.<br/>
I think you&#39;re saying &quot;I don&#39;t understand&quot; as a rhetorical device, to invite <br/>
agreement or (now evil) disagreement.   (I hope that&#39;s all it is.)<br/>
<br/>
The topic is how to decide.  One way to decide is to hear what people think <br/>
in retrospect about similar situations.   For every family there is a point at <br/>
which one more child will be the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.  For some <br/>
that might be the second one.  For some the fourth, or tenth, or fifteenth.  <br/>
But if people assume there is no limit, that&#39;s not thoughtful.  If a parent <br/>
does NOT take her own existing children&#39;s needs and limits ito account, she&#39;s not <br/>
expressing love by bringing another child in.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a limit to love?  <br/>
Well, yes.  Exhaustion does it a number.  Overcrowding and resentment don&#39;t <br/>
nourish it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a person adopts out of her OWN neediness, not that of the <br/>
child(ren), and in such a case she would have done better to have gotten some <br/>
counselling and really build up her own self and her family&#39;s self and THEN think about <br/>
adopting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282513574">Sometimes a Mom will also have more bio children for her own need, when it&#39;s not a good idea and strains the dynamic of the existing family.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve heard people say they wish they&#39;d stopped at fewer kids than they actually had.  I&#39;ve known some never said as much, but clearly should never have had &#39;more&#39; children at whatever point.  I think deciding to adopt is much the same -- it&#39;s about knowing your limits and when to say no to the idea of adding a child, whether bio or adopted.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it also has to do with your reasons or needs -- is someone adopting to get the boy or girl they always wanted but never got? That&#39;s such a bad reason to have or adopt another child.  I remember the story my Mom and her sisters tell about the birth of the youngest sister.  Mom&#39;s the oldest of 5 girls, in pursuit of a boy.  When the youngest was due and Grandma went to the hospital for her birth, the other girls asked their Dad if they could go see Mom and the baby at the hospital, he answered &#39;if it&#39;s a boy, we&#39;ll go to see him.  Otherwise, just wait for Mama to come home.&quot;  He ltold the girls he loved them, but was clearly going to be hugely disappointed if (when, actually) the new baby was a girl.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s why it always bothers me when people (complete strangers, mind you) ask if we&#39;re going to try for a girl.  Like having three kids of the same sex is a wrong that must be righted, and that having more kids until you get the &#39;right&#39; one is the way to go.<br/>

still talking about the ORIGINAL decision.<br/>
<br/>
My sister adopted a very high needs (attachment disorder) child of 11. <br/>
She could not BE a better mother. Her daughter had MAJOR problems and <br/>
lots came out during her young teen years. And, my sister&#39;s husband <br/>
died of leukemia when their daughter was 13 (they also had two sons - <br/>
the kids were 13, 14, and 15). My sister went through hell. She NEVER <br/>
wavered in doing everything she could possible do to make a good life <br/>
for her children, ALL of them. But she had to go to work and<br/>
<br/>
Did she look back and think that she wished she had been able to give <br/>
more energy and time to her other children? Did she think about how she <br/>
had not adopted expecting the very very serious and even dangerous <br/>
situation she was taking on and of course not even remotely expecting <br/>
to be doing it ALONE? Looking back at that original decision - the ONLY <br/>
thing is to recognize that it was very very hard on her first two <br/>
children and on her and that if she had known how it was going to be, <br/>
she would not have done it. If you don&#39;t think recognizing THAT reality <br/>
is heartbreaking and hard and guilt-inducing and all that!!! But - it <br/>
is true. Yet, she did it and so she accepted that reality and did her <br/>
best.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Did she look back and think that she wished she had been able to give <br/>
 more energy and time to her other children? Did she think about how she <br/>
 had not adopted expecting the very very serious and even dangerous <br/>
 situation she was taking on and of course not even remotely expecting <br/>
 to be doing it ALONE?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine how hard it must be to loose a spouse and become a single <br/>
mother.  Life altering for sure.  Things happen in life.  Some very hard things.  <br/>
Many things we never envisioned or never planned for.  That&#39;s part of life.  <br/>
My 16 year old starts treatment for leukemia next week.  I could never have <br/>
planned for that.  The last month has been a nightmare.  I&#39;m also coping with my <br/>
22 year old son that broke his back at work and is now at home with me caring <br/>
for him.  I would have never thought to plan for that either.<br/>
<br/>
Things happen in life and they shape our families for the good and sometimes <br/>
even bad impacts.  My older boy is the one that some of you may remember me <br/>
saying had a drug problem some years ago and really tested my parenting.  These <br/>
days, he holds my hand and tears run down his face and he thanks me so many <br/>
times, that it&#39;s embarrassing to me, just for little things like getting him a <br/>
drink or making him something to eat or just sitting with him.  It could have <br/>
been a lot different.  I have guilt because there was a time  when I seriously <br/>
felt I would have to just give up on him, but something helped me hold on to <br/>
him with a thin thread and slowly we worked our way back to a family.  Maybe if <br/>
I had not been there for his toddler years or kept seeing that precious <br/>
newborn face, I wouldn&#39;t have had the energy to keep mothering him.  Maybe I would <br/>
have either way, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I think almost every parent has something at the end of their children&#39;s <br/>
growing up years that they look back on with regret or at least wistfully wish had <br/>
been somewhat different or maybe lots different.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I can say positively is that I am SO grateful that I&#39;ve had <br/>
Cait home with me the last years, we&#39;ve done so much and I&#39;ve become so much <br/>
closer to her.  It does make facing her illness a bit easier.  I can&#39;t imagine if <br/>
you were trying to keep up with a school schedule and all these appointments.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to add that single mothers, whether by choice or fate, get an <br/>
extra dose of admiration from me, especially these days when I wonder how I would <br/>
get through this stuff without a partner to share it with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800597944">A family I grew up new had three biological boys and adopted a girl.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys were sweet, honest, funny, nice, and embodied all the good traits of <br/>
the two VERY nice parents.<br/>
<br/>
The daughter must have embodied traits of the parents who had taken off on an <br/>
infant.  She treated other people that way too.  She was cold, and harsh, and <br/>
dishonest, and lacking in compassion. I don&#39;t know if her mother drank. <br/>
Nowadays some of that is blamed on fetal alcohol syndrome.  I don&#39;t know anything <br/>
about her parents.  But I know she was so profoundly different from the family <br/>
that had raised her that she disrupted and cost them huge amounts of money for <br/>
therapy and lawyers and she grew up and shoplifted as a young adult and lied <br/>
to people and didn&#39;t pay her bills, and that was NOT from her upbringing or <br/>
the nurturing of the family that really, truly did try to love her and help her. <br/>
