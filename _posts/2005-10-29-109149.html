<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719752154">As for doing things like climbing on the employee ladders...my son<br/>
still does that, at age 9. He always comes down when I ask now<br/>
though (not without protest)...I think for some kids, its just too<br/>
tempting. Maybe if you see something like that try to distract him,<br/>
don&#39;t go down the aisle, maybe really get into talking about it, what<br/>
its used for, talk to him about why he can&#39;t be on it. For me, those<br/>
situations kind of suck, because I feel like I&#39;m forced to enforce<br/>
the store&#39;s rule or get yelled at by some salesperson, when very<br/>
often their fears are unfounded (would your son *really* get hurt by<br/>
climbing up a couple of steps, and then down, with you watching,<br/>
keeping him safe? Probably not, and yet I know I feel like I&#39;m<br/>
letting my son do &quot;bad&quot; if I allow it.) We got yelled at (well, in a<br/>
very singsongy polite way)by the lady at the shoestore in the mall<br/>
the other day. Seamus was trying on shoes, and was running up and<br/>
down the (carpeted, empty,short)aisle we were in, to see if the<br/>
shoes would fall off when he ran (they did). &quot;No running, i dont<br/>
want you to get hurt&quot;...i said &quot;oh he&#39;s just testing out his<br/>
shoes&quot; &quot;I know, but i dont want him to get hurt&quot;...there was zero<br/>
chance of him getting hurt, but yet we were still reprimanded. So i<br/>
can see how a kid might not fully buy into WHY he can&#39;t do<br/>
something, because oftentimes there isnt a real good reason behind<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can relate to this. Sometimes I think my kids are wild. They are the ones <br/>
that climb all the trees in the park and play very unconventionally on the <br/>
playground - and don&#39;t wear shoes ;-) Usually, they are climbing and <br/>
playing - and everything is a game - even in stores. There are times when I <br/>
am good at not stressing about it - but others that I do get stressed - and <br/>
I would say my biggest flaw in this area in inconsistency.<br/>
<br/>
We had an experience in Wal-Mart - where my son likes to sit/lay on that <br/>
bottom rack of the cart(where you can put big things...such as cases of <br/>
water. etc. Usually, its ok - I am sure there may be kids who could get <br/>
hurt, but we are usually very careful. We were told be the manager to have <br/>
him get out. We have been &quot;spoken too&quot; at Home Depot for our children <br/>
sitting on that really big, long cart used for carrying large pieces of wood <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that my kids are certainly exuberant. I can take any of them <br/>
alone and they are great - but put them all together and although I would <br/>
never say they were &quot;bad&quot; but they don&#39;t behave quietly all the time. Even <br/>
at the library we go through the &quot;library voice&quot; discussion before we get in <br/>
there, but they have this tree play fort area in the kids section and I am <br/>
sure that kids are meant to go up there and quietly read. Well, my kids make <br/>
elaborate stories with the stuffed animals who end up leaping out of the <br/>
tree tops. Luckily we have a nice, kid friendly librarian.<br/>
<br/>
My fear has always been that I am too easy-going with these things - and <br/>
will they grow up? I assume that by 16 or so the animal throwing from the <br/>
tree tops at the library will stop ;-) and eventually they will no longer <br/>
want to climb up the outside of the slide and on top of the monkey bars.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I think much of this is personality...<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Just because&quot; is a good enough reason in a place we don&#39;t own, though, or <br/>
that&#39;s not a public place like a playground.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s something I ask visitors at my house not to do, they don&#39;t need to <br/>
know whether there&#39;s a really good reason behind it, they just need to know <br/>
it&#39;s my house.    A dad threatened to swat his daughter at my house once, and I <br/>
told him he wasn&#39;t going to do it here.   A teen came in and started ragging <br/>
on his mother once who was here visiting with her younger (nicer) kids, and I <br/>
told him if he wanted to be mean to his mom, he needed to do it somewhere <br/>
besides my house.   (He was going on about her not having given him enough money <br/>
for gasoline or something, and he was 18 and able bodied and disturbing my <br/>
peace.)<br/>

I think the guy at Walmart wants them to grow up with all their fingers <br/>
intact and operational.   The torque and weight and wire and wheels down there are a<br/>
ll very much bigger and stronger than a finger.   I used to let kids sit down <br/>
there if they sat cross-legged and had their hands in their laps or arms <br/>
crossed--no fingers near wheels.   That was with the high-basket grocery carts, <br/>
where there was room for a kid to sit up, not the big deep Walmart things.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby pulled a cart over once with Marty in the baby seat.   Neither got <br/>
hurt, but I nearly had a stroke from the fright of it.   Had there already been <br/>
groceries in it, he couldn&#39;t have tipped it.   On the other hand...     just <br/>
scary.<br/>

Good to know!  We&#39;ve ridden on these tempting carts at the hardware <br/>
store and I never thought about trailing fingers down under the wheels.  <br/>
(I guess our flat carts often had center rails, and our son liked to <br/>
ride standing up -- different set of risks.)<br/>

the &quot;just because&quot; of which I speak.<br/>

&quot;It&#39;s mine and I don&#39;t want you to treat it that way&quot; is a pretty good <br/>
reason.<br/>

I do too, but I don&#39;t bend over backwards to convince my child that someone <br/>
needs reasons WE understand to put conditions on the use of her own private <br/>
home or property.   If grandma doesn&#39;t want french fries and ketchup in the back <br/>
seat, it&#39;s just because.    Any kid not old enough to figure that out on his <br/>
own is too young to have an open ketchup container.<br/>
<br/>
At some point their social awareness curve should pass their &quot;how come?&quot; <br/>
stage and too much explanation is condescending.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Then you say, &quot;I know you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get hurt, but they don&#39;t  <br/>
know you. The ladder is only for people who work here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  If he&#39;s not convinced that the store manager is being reasonable,  <br/>
so what? The store manager might or might NOT be reasonable and your  <br/>
son might be disappointed. Find something else to offer and empathize  <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
The store ladder isn&#39;t yours and it isn&#39;t there for customers to  <br/>
climb on and you knew that. He needs YOU to let him know stuff like  <br/>
that. You let him do it, even though you surely must have known that  <br/>
if the store manager saw him that he would not like it. If he REALLY  <br/>
wanted to, you could have found the store manager and asked, &quot;We  <br/>
REALLY want to go up that ladder in aisle 4, so I wanted to see if we  <br/>
could get your permission - I&#39;d stand right there and hold his hand  <br/>
and we&#39;ll be super careful. Do you think that would be all right just  <br/>
this once?&quot; You never know - some managers would say okay and others  <br/>
would say no way.<br/>
<br/>
Same with the fire truck that somebody else wrote about - we&#39;ve had  <br/>
firefighters bring their trucks TO parks and put up the big tall  <br/>
ladder and actually let people go up as high as they wanted - even  <br/>
very young kids - 3 and 4 year olds. It was arranged in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Take advantage of serendipitous opportunities and arrange cool  <br/>
experiences - that&#39;s all good. But you don&#39;t have some kind of  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; to create a climbing experience for your son in a grocery  <br/>
store using their ladder.<br/>
<br/>
About the running - a kid who runs and has to be chased is not safe  <br/>
in a store with doors that open to parking lots. You&#39;re responsible  <br/>
for his safety, so if you can&#39;t find a way for him to be safe, then  <br/>
don&#39;t take him to stores or anyplace where his running might be  <br/>
unsafe for him or others.<br/>
<br/>
I get really irritated at people who aren&#39;t keeping their kids safe -  <br/>
yesterday we saw a dad and a really young boy - maybe 4, not older,  <br/>
crossing the street at a very very busy large intersection with left  <br/>
turn arrows and many lanes in each direction. The boy was on a  <br/>
scooter and was out ahead of the dad. The dad REALLY needed to hold  <br/>
that kid back with him - he was so short and hard to see and a car  <br/>
turning left came within inches of running him down. The dad then  <br/>
YELLED at the kid to watch out. But it was the dad&#39;s responsibility  <br/>
to have seen in advance that the child needed to have his hand held.  <br/>
His letting his son do something dangerous was rude to US - we had to  <br/>
sit there and watch as he was really very nearly run down. It was  <br/>
awful. It could have been even more awful. It is just really rude to  <br/>
other people.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really care if that kid had an aversion to having his hand  <br/>
held. If he can&#39;t be kept safe, he shouldn&#39;t be out there. Same with  <br/>
a kid running and having to be chased in a store or elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpected things happen - I&#39;m not saying that every time a kid takes  <br/>
off that means a parent should no longer ever take them out in  <br/>
public. But if you KNOW you have a child who runs and has to be  <br/>
chased, it is irresponsible to take them places where they might get  <br/>
hurt or hurt someone else.<br/>
