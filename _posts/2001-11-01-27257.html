I have a theory.  ( I hear you groaning, but no, it doesn&#39;t involve<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-536840831">There have been hundreds of students at the universities have these<br/>
biological goodies.  None of these schools have much of what could be called<br/>
security measures.  It takes a nurse more paperwork and using more keys to<br/>
unlock more secure areas to give a patient aspirin than it does to get these<br/>
items at a biology class in some schools.<br/>
<br/>
Step 1 should be control the source here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895112321">I was joking but not! I really do wonder if they&#39;ve considered your possible scenario. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re just like any other &quot;professional group&quot;, stuck in the box, rarely interested in what a lay person has to offer. Another symptom of our school centered society. So many wise people are overlooked for lack of credentials while complete idiots control our destiny. Best I can do is cross my fricken fingers :~D <br/>
Dreams of a better future are harder to come by in my forties than they were in my twenties. Having three kids to worry about doesn&#39;t help much either!<br/>
