<br/>
Why are we talking about this here?  Honestly.  <br/>
<br/>
There are other places online to discuss schools.<br/>
Especially &quot;pre-schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
People leave this list because of the high volume of e-mail, and I&#39;m <br/>
uncomfortable when the volume isn&#39;t at least about unschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
People come on for a day or two and leave, too, and I would REALLY hate for <br/>
their day or two to have been a discussion of which pre-school is better.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers, there isn&#39;t a good pre-school.  If your circumstances demand <br/>
that you put your children in ANY kind of institution, then it might be <br/>
better to go to the pre-school-comparison discussions that I&#39;m sure are happening <br/>
all over yahoogroups and the web.<br/>
