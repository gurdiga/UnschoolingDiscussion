<br/>
There is something really amazing about setting aside your own interests<br/>
to become thoroughly interested in whatever it is your kids are<br/>
interested in.  Suddenly, you&#39;ve expanded your own world with infinite<br/>
possibilities!  Your own personal interests will still be there, or<br/>
actually grow with more ideas to add to it.  I can&#39;t even begin to say<br/>
how wonderful it&#39;s been to be really involved in what my kids are into. <br/>
I learn so much about them, about our world, and life, just by being<br/>
interested in what they are interested in.<br/>

However, how can you be engaged with your son when he is on the phone  all <br/>
the time??? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I used to say this kind of thing about my daughter being on World of  <br/>
Warcraft.  Certainly, WoW is her space (perhaps the phone time is  your son&#39;s <br/>
space?).  It took me ages to realize that this didn&#39;t go  for all her time when <br/>
she was engaged with virtual worlds.    <br/>
 <br/>
But, since I&#39;ve been trying to put into action the ideas I&#39;ve read about in <br/>
 this group (and finally found time to follow advice over several years <br/>
from  Schuyler), I&#39;ve realized that dd shares far more of her online time with <br/>
me  than I&#39;d have expected - mainly as a result of my asking  occasional <br/>
non-intrusive questions about what she finds amusing (&quot;What&#39;s  new on <br/>
LOLcats?&quot;, etc), and then chatting and sharing.  And realizing how  sophisticated her <br/>
humour can be means I no longer see this type of screentime as  trivial - <br/>
I&#39;m noticing that the more I respect her choices, the more she&#39;ll  share <br/>
these things with me.  WoW remains off limits for me as she doesn&#39;t  want to be <br/>
embarrassed by my terrible reaction times, but there are lots of  mutual <br/>
giggles about other favourite sites.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, a website&#39;s easier to share than a phone conversation - and I  <br/>
suppose it&#39;s harder to ask gentle questions without getting into invasions of <br/>
 private territory.  All I&#39;m suggesting from my (admittedly  <br/>
limited!)experience is that a young person&#39;s intense engagement with  a virtual world or a <br/>
voice on the other end of the line doesn&#39;t  necessarily preclude other <br/>
engagement.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Disclaimer: my oldest child turns 8 tomorrow, so I am speaking out of  <br/>
my hat when talking about older kids.<br/>
<br/>
But I have a couple of ideas. One is to wonder who he&#39;s on the phone  <br/>
with. Is there a friend he&#39;d like to see in person? Can you facilitate  <br/>
that? What are they talking about? Is there something they&#39;re  <br/>
interested in that you could use as inspiration for an outing together  <br/>
with his friend?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if his phone time is private for him, you might  <br/>
just continue to offer non-phone activities together is a really low- <br/>
key way. Again, build on his interests: would he like to go to the  <br/>
comic shop? To get some magazines about something he&#39;s interested in?  <br/>
You know what he likes.<br/>
<br/>
I will say, based on my own little kids, don&#39;t freak out too much  <br/>
about him being on the phone so much right now. People who have de- <br/>
schooled with their kids tell stories like that all the time! My own  <br/>
kids, who have always been unschooled, also sometimes go through very  <br/>
focused phases. Inevitably, just as I am starting to worry (&quot;maybe  <br/>
they really ARE playing too many video games!&quot;) they switch it up and  <br/>
spend a whole day building a spaceship in the living room or  <br/>
something. When I find myself fretting like that, I tell myself, &quot;I&#39;ll  <br/>
give it another week before I start to worry&quot; (or, I&#39;ll give it  <br/>
another 30 days...). In every case something has happened to relieve  <br/>
my worry in the time I&#39;ve set. Sometimes it&#39;s a change in the kids&#39;  <br/>
habits, the end of a really focused period--and sometimes it&#39;s me!  <br/>
(The end of _my_ period, for example :-) I&#39;m more prone to worry  <br/>
sometimes than others, so my own fretting passes sometimes even if the  <br/>
pattern of the days doesn&#39;t switch-up.<br/>
<br/>
I do sometimes check in with my older son, who is more inclined to  <br/>
long periods of immersion. I&#39;ll ask something like, &quot;Are you enjoying  <br/>
watching movies, or are you wishing there was something else to do?&quot;  <br/>
If he tells me he&#39;s just enjoying himself, I might say, &quot;OK, can I get  <br/>
you a snack?&quot; or &quot;Let me know if you need my help finding something  <br/>
new on Free On Demand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me--one way to stay connected with your son is to do  <br/>
small thoughtful, non-intrusive things. Bring him a snack, wash and  <br/>
fold his laundry for him and give him a big smile as you pass him on  <br/>
the way to his dresser, buy his favorite food for the freezer.  <br/>
&quot;Connection&quot; doesn&#39;t have to mean &quot;doing the same thing with him,&quot; it  <br/>
can mean, &quot;reminding him he&#39;s valued and you like him.&quot; You might find  <br/>
several opportunities throughout the day for a quick, pleasant moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151647593">-=-I have always homeschooled in an eclectic mode but still held the  <br/>
reigns so to speak.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I want to note this word not to correct or embarrass you, but because  <br/>
this is the third use of &quot;reigns&quot; instead of &quot;reins&quot; in just a couple  <br/>
of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rein&quot; as in the straps to a horse&#39;s bridle is the rein you hold, or  <br/>
give freely.    Reign is the period of time someone is king.   Perhaps  <br/>
the confusion comes, regarding control or freedom, in the idea of  <br/>
someone commanding someone else.<br/>
<br/>
In this and all other things, in a discussion, if someone is unsure  <br/>
about what he or she is writing, and confused about words, or using  <br/>
words without being careful, then that will mean the thinking is also  <br/>
not as careful or as clear as it could be otherwise.   So it&#39;s okay to  <br/>
use the wrong word, but it&#39;s also okay for someone else to point it out.<br/>
<br/>
Really, the goal is for people to be able to sort through their own  <br/>
habits and reactions and fears to come to a clearing where the  <br/>
children can live freely.<br/>
<br/>
-=As expected they played a LOT of games, and the oldest at 14 spent a  <br/>
lot of time on his phone! I left it alone. This week it has begun to  <br/>
bug me more...so I need some encouragement to trust this is not going  <br/>
to always be this way! My 14 year old has been on the phone almost all  <br/>
day!-=-<br/>
<br/>
Was the phone limited before?   Is he talking to someone you could  <br/>
invite over, instead?<br/>
<br/>
(Doh!  This sat here a long time and someone already asked that.<br/>
<br/>
As to withdrawal from control itself, one thing some moms have found  <br/>
helpful is to find other things to control:  clean the store room,  <br/>
schedule up a bunch of meals and make a gloriously organized shopping  <br/>
list, reorganize your bathroom, start a hobby...  control yourself  <br/>
instead of your kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194229127">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My 11 year old stated, again, he doesn&#39;t like his life and he is bored.<br/>
I remember reading that boredom is nothing to be concerned with (before I<br/>
would say &quot;no boredom allowed, if you are bored I&#39;ll find you some chore!&quot;)<br/>
and that it will give them time to think what they would like to do with<br/>
their time.  I know I need to be more engaged with them&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I take it when your say &quot;nothing to be concerned about&quot; you really mean <br/>
nothing to be &quot;worried&quot; about, that sometimes it is a momentary or short <br/>
term thing. However here you are saying that your son has stated this more <br/>
than once.<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on what &quot;bored&quot; is code for, and I am pretty much always <br/>
concerned with, as in deeply interested in, Jayn&#39;s emotional state.<br/>
When Jayn says that she is bored, usually that is very simply translated to <br/>
&quot;I want more of your focussed attention&quot;, even if it just watching a tv show <br/>
with her on the sofa.<br/>
<br/>
Since your older boy is so happy with the phone right now, that sounds like <br/>
an ideal opportunity to do something with your 11 yo. Sometimes when <br/>
children have had their time and activities dictated, they lose track of <br/>
their own passions. I hope you can both discover what your 11 yo&#39;s passions <br/>
are.<br/>

&gt; encouragement to trust this is not going to always be this way &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes it helps to think about a &quot;what if&quot;. What if your older son <br/>
remains on the phone most every day for a month, a season, a year, for <br/>
years? Maybe he is a great verbal communicator, and has the ability to <br/>
organize his thoughts and speak extemporaneously with clarity. I admire <br/>
that - it takes me writing and rewriting to achieve clarity. Maybe he will <br/>
end up being one of those people that earn their living talking to people on <br/>
the phone, like a counsellor (hopefully not a phone psychic). Maybe he is a <br/>
great listener - his future spouse will love that quality about him. It <br/>
probably won&#39;t be all day every day for years.<br/>
<br/>

Robyn gave a good answer, but think of what kind of mom you want to  <br/>
be.  Rather than figuring how little you &quot;have to&quot; do to be a good  <br/>
mom, look at how much you COULD do.  How good a mom could you be?  How  <br/>
attentive?  How aware?   Barely getting by is too schoolish.   Don&#39;t  <br/>
think of it as whether you&#39;ve done enough for the day.   Think of  <br/>
whether there&#39;s one more thing you could do.  And then, whether  <br/>
there&#39;s one MORE.  Even if my child is asleep, there still might be  <br/>
one more thing I can do to make his life better when he wakes up, or  <br/>
while he&#39;s sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the traditional attitudes about boredom are harmful.  This  <br/>
might give you some more ideas:<br/>

interest. (But be careful it doesn&#39;t sound like you&#39;re haranguing him <br/>
for being on the phone, if you&#39;ve done that a lot before.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to mention that it is super super common for kids to spend a <br/>
lot of time socializing at that age - just talking talking talking <br/>
talking. If you listen in, it can sound inane, but it is research and <br/>
experimentation - figuring out relationships and human nature and all <br/>
that.  So - if that&#39;s what he is really doing - good for him. Or is it <br/>
something else? I mean, think more about why he&#39;s on the phone all the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746574235">If it makes you feel better, I&#39;m experiencing control withdrawals too.  The first few days of no bedtimes for Seth were great, but now I&#39;m feeling like the dieter who does really well for the first three days and then feels the cravings hit really hard.  Last night was particularly difficult - for me!  But I managed.  I was taking a lot of breaths and reminding myself of the &quot;whys&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
If your son is bored you might suggest that he join you in doing what you&#39;re doing.  So long as it isn&#39;t chores!  You might also ask him what kind of life he would like to have and how he might attain it.<br/>
<br/>
Really, though, I shouldn&#39;t be dispensing advice, particularly when it comes to teens, because I don&#39;t have one, and they seem to inhabit a very different world (even when I was teen I felt this way). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helped me to take a deep breath and say to myself, &quot;This too, shall pass&quot; and realizing that, try to make the best moment out of it (easier said than done, of course). <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think teens inhabit a different world.  They definitely like to<br/>
hang with other teens.  Here&#39;s what I see... Unschooled teens will<br/>
readily accept friendship and company of many ages and types of people,<br/>
while schooled teens, will begrudgingly do so.  It doesn&#39;t mean they<br/>
won&#39;t, it means that their natural instinct to learn from the whole<br/>
world around them, including many ages and people, has been squashed by<br/>
the school system.  You have to be persistent in interactions with teens<br/>
that have been in school for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been relatively successful in befriending teens of all kinds,<br/>
including schooled ones.  You&#39;ve got to be totally open and accepting of<br/>
whatever they are into, even if it&#39;s sex talk and nasty jokes.  Open<br/>
your house up, let them play their music, feed them, and just talk about<br/>
random stuff that comes up.  Every time Chamille brings a new friend<br/>
over, I introduce myself and ask questions of the person, like &quot;do you<br/>
live around here?&quot;, &quot;do you have any siblings, and if yes how many and<br/>
what ages?&quot;, &quot;how old are you, when&#39;s your b-day?&quot;, &quot;what&#39;s your<br/>
favorite musician and why?&quot;, etc.  It&#39;s not done interogation style,<br/>
more in a &quot;I&#39;m interested to get to know you&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, for kids who are in school and have really yucky parents,<br/>
this can take a long time of multiple interactions before they feel<br/>
comfortable with talking to you, the adult.  Teens naturally like<br/>
adults, they are learning to become one, just like little kids naturally<br/>
like slightly older kids, because it&#39;s the next step in their lives. <br/>
Schools have an insideous way of squashing this natural leaning to<br/>
befriend the next step, and discourage the older kids from wanting to be<br/>
around the younger kids, which is also natural.  It&#39;s natural for older<br/>
kids to still associate with slightly younger kids, because it&#39;s where<br/>
they just came from, and still a part of who they are as they are<br/>
becoming older.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say, don&#39;t be intimidated by talking to teens.  They are<br/>
people too and kids soon to be adults.  I really dislike the way our<br/>
culture seperates them out as other than, instead of embracing them and<br/>
enjoying them!</div>
