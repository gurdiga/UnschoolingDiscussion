<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402569413">hi, i&#39;m new to the list, my name is alicia and we are unschooling a 8 <br/>
yr old daughter and 6 yr old son, i&#39;ve been following the discussions <br/>
and i have a possible idea for whomever was looking for a robe <br/>
pattern. this isn&#39;t harry potter, it is for a cloak for the lord of <br/>
the rings, but i&#39;m sure it could be used for a wizard robe. anyway <br/>
here is the link...<br/>

<br/>
another source is simplicity patterns. if you have a joanns fabric <br/>
store in your area, watch their sale ad, (you can check it online at <br/>
joann.com. you type in your city and it will give you the current ad <br/>
for your area store) and they have patterns on sale for .99 for <br/>
simplicity, mccall, butterick and vogue. i bought a bunch of patterns <br/>
for halloween (they want to be legolas and frodo) anyway hope this <br/>
helps somebody out.<br/>
<br/>
pleasure being on the list,<br/>
