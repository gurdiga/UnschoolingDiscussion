<div id="ygrps-yiv-897888960">Hi everyone! :)<br/>
<br/>
We are in San Diego, love the beach, have two boys at home (ages 19 <br/>
and 8) and one gigantic, gentle Golden Retriever --- and are <br/>
absolute fans and proponents of the unschooling philosophy. :)  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written the following as my &quot;testament&quot; to all my friends and <br/>
relatives who are inquiring the famous &quot;What?&quot; and &quot;Why?&quot; over our <br/>
new lifestyle:<br/>
<br/>
:) Lori<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Today is my son&#39;s last day in public school (whew!).  I cannot <br/>
wait to bring him home!  Last night was Open House and what was <br/>
glaring apparent to me what the assinine work they do (color <br/>
worksheets and staple them together) and how they made my son feel <br/>
inferior because he didn&#39;t want to do that.  His beautiful poster <br/>
displays that were made on his own about his trip to Yellowstone, <br/>
Mt. Rushmore and Custer State Park were shoved in a drawer and never <br/>
given attention.  arrrrghhhhh.........<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
Hello Friends!<br/>
<br/>
I write today with extreme enthusiasm - an epiphany, to be exact! I <br/>
have found &quot;the&quot; answer for my son. No more labels. No more testing. <br/>
No more desk-bound, convergent, in-the-box, get-the-one-right-<br/>
answer, artificial curriculum based learning that defeats his <br/>
imagination, divergent style thinking, passions, risk-taking and <br/>
self-confidence.  I am going to homeschool him. More precisely, I am <br/>
going to &quot;unschool&quot; him. <br/>
<br/>
It was a big decision, one which I struggled with at first, but now <br/>
I am fully confident that it is absolutely right for him. In talking <br/>
with another mother, my answer to her inquiry (of why?) was <br/>
this: &quot;My son was born into this world a happy, confident, risk-<br/>
taking, inquisitive, exploring little guy with wonderful rhythm and <br/>
a song on his lips. After three years of public schooling, I hardly <br/>
recognize him.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The truth is that children are born with a love of learning - they <br/>
spend their early years investigating the world, making connections, <br/>
and testing hypotheses. This love of learning is destroyed with <br/>
the &quot;open your books and I will teach you what you need to know&quot; <br/>
style that forces artificial timelines, constant evaluations and <br/>
labels children that aren&#39;t &quot;productive&quot; or &quot;achieving&quot; some <br/>
artificially-imposed curriculum that teaches task-oriented behavior -<br/>
 not higher levels of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of students does this style yield?  Sometime in high <br/>
school or college - after 10-12 years of task-oriented classwork - <br/>
professors/teachers sigh in disdain over students who cannot <br/>
think &quot;outside the box&quot; and &quot;make connections&quot; and &quot;explore and <br/>
evaluate ideas&quot;!! Is this no surprise???? They have been conditioned <br/>
otherwise for so many years. And what is the answer that government <br/>
comes up with? More testing, more evaluations and the likes of No <br/>
Child Left Behind. The government tells schools that if they want <br/>
money, they had better have high test scores. So schools have <br/>
learned that they must teach students how to get right answers on <br/>
tests - task oriented behavior.<br/>
<br/>
The world is not in a shortage of people to perfom task-oriented <br/>
jobs. The world is in shortage of great thinkers. Task-oriented <br/>
people require directions and step-by-step instructions before they <br/>
can proceed (or dare to proceed, even then with fear). Thinkers look <br/>
for connections and reason their way to problem solving. They may <br/>
not want to &quot;go from A to B&quot; without more information. They may need <br/>
information on C, D, E, F and a host of other details to form their <br/>
big picture analysis, and then decide that going from A to B is (or <br/>
perhaps is not) the answer!<br/>
<br/>
My son is intelligent. Quite so! He does not need an IEP or special <br/>
education - when the truth is he is thinking on a higher level that <br/>
what is required!  He sees connections and has deep insight into a <br/>
lot of things. Maybe not everything, but who does? He does math <br/>
perfectly well with shells on the beach. He reads books that <br/>
interest him just fine, with nearly perfect phonetics and lively <br/>
inflection. He can memorize things that interest him, including <br/>
sequences. Standardized tests do not reveal these things. My son is <br/>
like a rare, beautiful plant -- he does not grow anywhere, in any <br/>
light, in any soil, like common plants do -- he needs the right <br/>
cultivating conditions, and then he grows in ways that amaze us all.<br/>
<br/>
My son is excited about homeschooling. But he needs to <br/>
be &quot;deschooled&quot; for a while (new terminology I&#39;m learning) to shake <br/>
off the paradigms that didn&#39;t work in the classroom and identities <br/>
that do not belong to him. I had absolute confirmation that my <br/>
decision was right when he came into our bedroom one night, after he <br/>
had been put to bed for a while, carrying a brand new folder he <br/>
found in his bookshelf. He announced, &quot;This can be my <br/>
new &quot;Unfinished Work&quot; folder for home!&quot; I hugged him and <br/>
said, &quot;Hunny, we do not need an Unfinished Work folder at all.&quot; He <br/>
was confused, as this wretched folder that has caused us to much <br/>
grief at school has become part of his identity. The shame of it! <br/>
<br/>
I joked with my husband that maybe we should have an ceremonial <br/>
burning of it --- and throw in the &quot;star chart&quot; too. I want my child <br/>
to learn because he loves to learn. Learning should be the reward in <br/>
itself. If he has to feign interest in something to earn a star on <br/>
his chart - what is the point of that? Has any real learning taken <br/>
place? Why are math, science, literature and art separate subjects <br/>
that are approached as solitary domains? No wonder students sigh and <br/>
say, &quot;I&#39;ll never use this stuff.&quot; It is no surprise.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re off on a fantastic, adventuresome journey of sailing (physics <br/>
of the wind), making paper airplanes, IMAX films, museums, turtle <br/>
watching, shell collecting - whatever catches our interest.  We will <br/>
find glory in the integrated, whole life approach to math, science, <br/>
literature and art.  We are abandoning who the public school thinks <br/>
we are and what we should know and are reaching for the skies..</div>
