Anna had her first real &quot;job&quot; tonight.. Well, she has babysat for neices and <br/>
nephews plenty of times, but tonight she watched some &quot;non family&quot; kids.    A <br/>
mother from our play group asked if she would like to watch some children <br/>
during Bible Study at thier church.   She watched 5 kids, ages 1-6, and she <br/>
made $10 for about and and half.    She really enjoyed it.   Tomorrow she is <br/>
going over to one of the parents home to help her for a little while.  She is <br/>
very excited. I hope this is the start of her &#39;word of mouth&quot; <br/>
recommendations.<br/>
