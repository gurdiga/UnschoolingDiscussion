&gt;One was breastfed <br/>
&gt;until she was almost 3 and the other only (exclusivley)for a few <br/>
&gt;weeks (nipple confusion, mommy confusion, call it what you will).  <br/>
&gt;The nurser eats anything including hot salsas, and other spicey foods <br/>
&gt;any veggi, anything.  While the bottler eats only familiar foods.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but it looks like to me that the bottle baby was displaying strong <br/>
preferences from the very beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
My ex-husband, and his sister, will not, ever no-way try anything new, <br/>
especially if someone asks them to try it.  They get really ticked off <br/>
if you ask them to.  It&#39;s like they have one-track taste buds.  <br/>

To each their own.<br/>
