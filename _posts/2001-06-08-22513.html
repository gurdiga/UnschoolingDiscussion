&gt; &lt;&lt; Nor did anyone say or imply that &quot;anyone who gets bit has only themselves<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; blame.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think someone said &quot;I know better than to run,&quot; but it was in reference to<br/>
&gt; people on bicycles (who do need to keep running, as it were...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Usually, not-running is a good idea. Sometimes, it&#39;s a bad idea. Usually,<br/>
peddling away real fast is a good idea. Sometimes, it&#39;s a bad idea (like if<br/>
you aren&#39;t fast enough, or if you&#39;re dealing with a pack that knows how to<br/>
hunt and they&#39;ve already positioned other dogs to cut you off).<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re dealing with a pack of dogs, or one truly big and determined<br/>
crazy-mean dog, you either get out of their range (peddle faster than they<br/>
can run, climb a tree, etc.) or you get your back to a wall, pick up a big<br/>
stick, and pray, which may not do you much good.<br/>
<br/>
Some dogs are incredibly dangerous, either by upbringing, natural<br/>
inclination, or desperate circumstances. The same can be said of some<br/>
people. There are fewer crazy-mean dogs, in my experience, than crazy-mean<br/>
people, so that&#39;s one point for the species, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Many or most dogs are incredibly dangerous when running in packs. The family<br/>
pet who allows the toddler to climb on him and pull his ears can be and<br/>
often is an entirely different animal when hunting, including hunting<br/>
people, with the other dogs in the neighborhood. The same can be said of<br/>
people.<br/>

I have a friend who is confined to a wheelchair, he began to carry a gun<br/>
because of this kind of behavior among dogs and people.  He said it was<br/>
frightening how they could attack when they spotted someone apparently<br/>
defenseless.<br/>
