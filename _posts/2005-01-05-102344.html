<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590195086">&quot;(Iggy Pop and the<br/>
Stooges was mentioned on a couple of pages and Iggy had a connection <br/>
to<br/>
Bowie.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Bowie was a huge influence on Iggy and saved him from <br/>
destroying his life with drugs. Basically jump started his career.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say that Bowie was punk before there was such a word. He <br/>
wasn&#39;t punk as far as the movement went, but he was doing things so <br/>
far ahead of his time that he was really one of the influencing <br/>
factors I believe.<br/>
