<br/>
Larger, thin tile you can use a glass-scorer---the little tool you use to <br/>
scratch a line on glass so you can break it.  There is a tile cutting tool <br/>
you can use (maybe rent one?) but I&#39;ve never used one.  Another rental item <br/>
is a water saw.  It cuts tile with a circular saw which is set in water at <br/>
the bottom.  You can draw on the tiles with markers or crayons and cut on the <br/>
lines.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I<br/>
want smaller and not regular pieces to work with.  I&#39;d like my children<br/>
(aged 6 & 4) to break them too - but I want them to be safe! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OHH!!!! I answered thinking you wanted to make small squares or <br/>
rectangles--straight lines.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.   Use rags or towels.  Put cloth down on concrete, cloth on top (I&#39;d <br/>
fold an old terry-cloth towel over the top).  If you hit it straight on with <br/>
a hammer you&#39;ll probably crush what&#39;s right at the point of impact.  but if <br/>
you put something like a piece of wood on top (masonite, thin plywood, or <br/>
even a piece of 2x4), and hit that with the hammer, it will diffuse the blow <br/>
and should break it up pretty well.  I wouldn&#39;t hit it too hard.  The wood <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to cover the whole piece of tile.<br/>
<br/>
Another way (but messier and potentially dangerous) is just to hold the tile <br/>
up flat a couple or three feet off the concrete and drop it flat.  If the <br/>
kids do that, they should be wearing jeans, shoes, socks.  (That particular <br/>
knowledge comes from accidents, and from dropping already-broken pots to get <br/>
shards for the bottoms of other house-plant-pots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014616576">If you tape the tops of the tile with masking tape before smacking them<br/>
the broken chunks stick together better - not such a hassle to pick up. <br/>
I tried laying them out on contact paper -- huge mistake.  Make a tic tac<br/>
toe pattern on the tile with the tape. Then a criss cross. Some pieces<br/>
still come loose but not that many.  <br/>

<br/>
&gt; If you tape the tops of the tile with masking tape before smacking them<br/>
&gt; the broken chunks stick together better - not such a hassle to pick up.<br/>
&gt; I tried laying them out on contact paper -- huge mistake.  Make a tic tac<br/>
&gt; toe pattern on the tile with the tape. Then a criss cross. Some pieces<br/>
&gt; still come loose but not that many.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So Sandra sounds like you have done this a bit...<br/>
What does one use for the mortar when doing mosaic?  Then what about the <br/>
grout?<br/>
And...how do you seal it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the same as you use for any tile.  Just ask at any old store.  Any <br/>
old grout.  Seal?<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  There&#39;s some outside tile stuff.  And even if I thought I knew (which I <br/>
don&#39;t) my info would be many years outdated.  Home building supplies of the <br/>
spackling/grout type tend to &quot;new-improve&quot; pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I have tile house numbers my kids did when we moved.  I haven&#39;t put them up <br/>
yet.  It&#39;s been three years.  I cannot begin to practice what I preach.  <br/>
<br/>
In my youth, though, I had a pottery shop (home, not professional) at home <br/>
and did two bathroom tile jobs (sink/counter) and have done some stuff with <br/>
commercial tile afterward.  I&#39;ve enjoyed it a ton every time.  Enjoying it <br/>
doesn&#39;t make me good at it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not that I¹ve done any mosaic, (more that enough tiles in bathrooms ­ but<br/>
not mosaic) but talking with artists who do they say ²same stuff you use for<br/>
a shower². One artist was covering concrete stepping stones with broken tile<br/>
mosaic and she was using thin set mortar. That¹s the stuff that is a fluffy<br/>
gray powder (looks like regular concrete cement) but when you mix it with<br/>
water it becomes an unbelievably sticky goo. This provides a great<br/>
opportunity to talk about chemical reactions with the kids! She also used<br/>
standard floor grout that has sand in its mix. (Himmn... I wonder why sand<br/>
would be in the mix for use on the floor and not when it is use on the wall?<br/>
You don¹t need to call it physics &lt;G&gt;) She was adding dry pigments as she<br/>
was applying it give some visual movement and structure to the background.<br/>
(Himmn...you could point out later how varying color in the grout background<br/>
makes the whole project look think, deep, and rich without making it an art<br/>
lesson.) We didn¹t talk sealers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, three years later plantings and dirt have given the stones and mosaics<br/>
a rich organic patina. All tiles are still holding fast and no cracks<br/>
anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
All the tile sealers I know of are just silicone water repellents. They<br/>
³seal² by making moisture bead up. They do need to be reapplied on occasion<br/>
as they loose there effectiveness. Even more chemistry talk here!<br/>

&gt; &gt; My dad worked for P.G. & E. and use to bring home those HUGE spools that<br/>
&gt; &gt; electrical cable were rolled out from.  He would stain the center and<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; base and do mosiacs on the tops and sold them for picnic tables.  They<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; neat.  Wish I had one now!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;d love to hear how to do this too...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ve always wanted to learn to mosaic...bird baths, stepping stones<br/>

source<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for tiles is to go to a tile store and go to their reject bin.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want smaller and not regular pieces to work with.  I&#39;d like my<br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (aged 6 & 4) to break them too - but I want them to be safe!  I<br/>

&gt; If you do any of the wood thingys, use spar varnish for the wood finish.<br/>
It<br/>
&gt; lasts longer than that deck stuff.  It&#39;s the stuff they use on the bottom<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; boats.<br/>
