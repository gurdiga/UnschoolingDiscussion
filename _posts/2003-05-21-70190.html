<div id="ygrps-yiv-205663729">I thought I&#39;d chime in on the nudity thing.  Davan (5) doesn&#39;t usually run around naked, although she sleeps naked, but she does wear dresses without panties or anything.  She is always turning summersalts, flipping while holding hands and doing other activities that make the situation obvious.  Due to other people&#39;s hang-ups and my own concerns about molestation, I do ask that she put panties on if we&#39;re leaving the house.  She&#39;s pretty comfortable with that and knows which houses we visit that it&#39;s okay to strip them back off when we walk though the door.  lol<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad she feels comfortable with her body.  Other kids her age we know sometimes tease about &quot;seeing underwear&quot; or particular body parts and Davan just shrugs it off.<br/>
