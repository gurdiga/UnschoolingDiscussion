<div id="ygrps-yiv-411982953">My name is Arlee (Arlene) and I have 2 ds&#39;s, Eric 10 and Alex 8, dss, Craig 19, and dh <br/>
Mitch.  We have just moved to Oregon (September &#39;03) and while my two younger <br/>
sons have never been &quot;public schooled&quot;, I have all too recently found confirmation, <br/>
justification and peace with what I instinctively knew was right for us (Unschooling), <br/>
but didn&#39;t have the self confidence, courage and or support to just &quot;stick with it!&quot;  We <br/>
moved from Illinois which is a very &quot;hands off&quot; state, i.e., no testing or consultations, <br/>
just notification, ONCE, that&#39;s it.  However, in Oregon, there is testing in 3, 5, 8, and <br/>
10th grades.  I was nervous and felt threatened and unfortunately, my kids endured <br/>
my fear with workbooks and assignments.  I found this group and the Unschooling <br/>
web site a month ago or so after re-reading through some old Life Learning and GWS <br/>
magazines that someone had given me back in Illinois!  (I guess I wasn&#39;t ready when I <br/>
read them the first time) :)  I promptly did away with &quot;school work&quot;, checked out 5 <br/>
recommended (by Sandra) books from the library, signed up for Netflix and added the <br/>
recommended (by Sandra) movies to the que and had a family meeting at which I <br/>
apologized for my behavior and mistakes and explained my renewed resolve as to <br/>
their ability to learn the way they want and what they want with our support.  My <br/>
husband is my best friend (thank goodness) and while he was pensive at first, he is <br/>
right there with me every step of the way (with a gentle reminder here and there). :)  <br/>
Anyway, I want you all to know, (esp. Sandra and Pam), that I will be forever grateful <br/>
for your courage and willingness to question the system and activism there of!  I <br/>
would not be able to do this without the support, insightfulness, spunk and courage <br/>
of this group and others like you!<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I would like to ask if anyone in this group is in the Portland area?  We live <br/>
in Oregon City.  It would be so very nice for us to get together with other <br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot;.  This move has been difficult for us, especially my ds Eric, who is so <br/>
very social!  We have one homeschooling neighbor with children my boys enjoy <br/>
playing with very much, however, they are religious homeschoolers and are not <br/>
available very much to play with.  They have lots of chores and or school work to do <br/>
most every day.  They are not allowed in my house without special permission, nor <br/>
are my children allowed in their house.  They are not allowed to watch many movies <br/>
or tv shows, listen to anything other than christian music, etc.  I hide the fact that I <br/>
smoke (yes, I have issues) because I am afraid if they knew that, they wouldn&#39;t allow <br/>
their kids to be around me or play with my children which would just devastate my <br/>
Eric!<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for being here, all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Still trying to get it right,<br/>
