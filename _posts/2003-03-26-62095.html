<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; About 2 years ago we had a local presentation of &quot;Sound Of Music Sing <br/>
&gt; Along&quot;. <br/>
&gt; I wanted to go so desperately!!  It was the movie, but everyone was allowed <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and encouraged to sing along at the top of their voice!  Many people even <br/>
&gt; came in costume! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did this last year in Chicago and it was the most fun I have had in a long <br/>
time! I belong to a summer softball team that is composed mostly of middle <br/>
aged moms and we went to this as a &quot;post season&quot; activity. It was great to <br/>
see the movie on the big screen again and I was amazed that most of us <br/>
remembered ALL the songs. The words were superimposed on the bottom of the <br/>
screen, too, if you needed a little help. And yes, there were lots of folks <br/>
in costumes which just added to the fun of the whole experience. I highly <br/>
recommend doing this if you are able!!<br/>
