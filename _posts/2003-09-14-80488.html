&gt;&gt;&gt; If I got angry enough to start yelling at someone, I think it would <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; be nicer<br/>
&gt; if friends of mine, or my husband, or my kids, ushered me to another <br/>
&gt; place and<br/>
&gt; helped me calm down rather than just backed up and let me &quot;get it all <br/>
&gt; out.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would damage my own self worth and my own peace for me to have a <br/>
&gt; fit like<br/>
&gt; that.  It would damage my reputation and my ability to be with those <br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; again in the future.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But you are an adult, who (barring some kind of mental illness) is <br/>
&gt; fully capable of choosing whether or not to behave this way. A child <br/>
&gt; is, well...a child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have to comment on this, being that I have personal experience as an <br/>
adult who is *currently* learning how to avoid rages.<br/>
I grew up completely ignored and passed from relative to relative like <br/>
an annoying dog.  The only consistent thing in my life was that you <br/>
could not predict anything.  My grandma had me the most and she was <br/>
never consistent - sometimes I got a hug, sometimes she turned into <br/>
this enormously wrathful monster like Ursula the sea witch and would <br/>
slap me and call my a gd little b.  I could be behaving identically in <br/>
both instances.<br/>
<br/>
No one taught me how to safely express feelings, I was taught to be <br/>
invisible and unobtrusive.  This sounds excessive, but gosh I talk to a <br/>
lot of friends who had another flavor of the same dish.  It is hard to <br/>
learn these appropriate behaviors on your own, especially when people <br/>
around you scoff at you like you are acting like a child( my husband <br/>
and family).  I *am* acting like a child when I have strong emotions.  <br/>
I just recently figured that out and I am trying to learn how express <br/>
emotions in a more constructive way.  My husband&#39;s response to a <br/>
similar upbringing is that he has a totally flat effect unless he is <br/>
being goofy.<br/>
I&#39;d like to figure out a happy medium in time to pass it on to my <br/>
children, but they see my outbursts often enough to have learned <br/>
tantruming from a pro.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the book &#39;How to behave so your children will too&#39; by Sal <br/>
Severe, but he tends to make this sound like a cake walk, and assumes <br/>
the parent has limitless patience.  Besides I can&#39;t remember more than <br/>
a few points and that I liked the book.<br/>
I have shelves full of books and wonder why I can&#39;t figure this stuff <br/>
out.  As I am sitting here, it is dawning on me that I have unrealistic <br/>
expectations of myself with all those books - I never learned a thing <br/>
in school from a book, how can I expect to suddenly learn well from a <br/>
book?<br/>
I like the sound of the non violent communication book - Is that <br/>
something that would come on tape or in a video presentation?<br/>
