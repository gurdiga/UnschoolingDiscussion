<div id="ygrps-yiv-715885190">Well, I was not licking my wounds.. I have been MIA just doing normal <br/>
parenting stuff, getting ready for Christmas, etc.. Bet you guys <br/>
thought I had rode my dead horse on outta here.. :-)  I  read the 90 <br/>
some messages that have been posted since I checked my email.  I have <br/>
copied the original text, then added my replies after the asterisks.  <br/>
I know a lot of you dont give a rats ass what I have to say.. Thats <br/>
OK.. I gonna say it anyway..And its 10 times more that 2 cents. <br/>
<br/>
**********************************<br/>
Sarcasm comes from a root meaning to cut. Sandra was tryinh to help <br/>
if you&#39;re <br/>
not interested in looking at yourself maybe its not time to ask the <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Renee<br/>
**************<br/>
I didnt ask any questions.  I made a statement about how I manage my <br/>
household, and judgement was passed on me.<br/>
**********************<br/>
The mom should have a right to talk and be among <br/>
adults and still be respected by her children. The kids do not have <br/>
to be the <br/>
center piece of every conversation and discussion.<br/>
Beth<br/>
*******************<br/>
I agree, Beth.   I respect my children by not interrupting thier <br/>
converstations or demanding them to do things for me when I they are <br/>
occupied.   I expect the same from them   Someone said that is how <br/>
children learn patience and respect. . Someone else replied that <br/>
children learn to ignore others by being ignored themselves.  I dont <br/>
think we are talking about ignoring our children at all.. Rather <br/>
asking them to wait ( therefore, show respect) for us to attend to <br/>
them.   Yeah yeah, barring emotional or physical emergencies.   If I <br/>
am in a converstation with an adult and my  7 yo says .. Moma, Moma, <br/>
Moma ( 3 times fast before I can even answer) come see watch my <br/>
trick.. come watch my trick.  I would say.. OK, JP. I will come see <br/>
your trick as soon as I finish talking to Judy.    He may continue to <br/>
insist.  &quot;JP, I will be finished in a just a minute, go practice it <br/>
some more, I will come watch you in just a minute..    If I <br/>
immediately end my converstation with Judy, doesnt that show <br/>
disrespect to Judy? and also show that my &quot;business&quot; it not as <br/>
important as  JP&#39;s?      If I was on the phone, I would try to wrap <br/>
the conversation up as quickly as possible, or say i would call her <br/>
back. in a few minutes.  If she was at my house, I would suggest we <br/>
go watch his trick.  But, I wouldnt just DROP EVERYTHING and go watch <br/>
that second.   <br/>
Along these same lines.. here this was stated&quot;<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt; While a parent who concentrates 100% on her kids all the time <br/>
has a special gift of unlimited time and energy with her kids, it <br/>
might have the deficit of her children not seeing her pursue any of <br/>
her own goals and plans. She might never take time for herself, and <br/>
her own needs. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ren replied:<br/>
No one here has advocated this.<br/>
In fact, one of the main principles of unschooling here, is that the <br/>
parent <br/>
passionately and joyously follow their interests, thereby being a <br/>
good <br/>
example of how to live a meaningful life and stay curious and <br/>
interested in <br/>
life.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
In order to insure this balance of both parents and <br/>
children &quot;passionately and joyously follow their interests&quot;  There <br/>
has to be some give and take.   Robin talked about not being able to <br/>
work on her novel . In order to allow her children to follow thier <br/>
wants and interests, she has to put her writing on the back burner.   <br/>
There ARE many many practical problems that come into play when <br/>
everyone tries do whatever they want to.   Just like the scenario <br/>
with my son wanting to go with his friends, but everyone else wanting <br/>
to go camping.   Compromises DO have to exist.   <br/>
<br/>
 Here is an example from this morning.  JP got up wanting pancakes <br/>
for breakfast..  &quot;Moma, Moma, can you make pancakes.!&quot;. I was just <br/>
waking up.. &quot;Oh.. yeah. I&#39;ll make some.. but I want to drink a cup of <br/>
coffee first.&quot;.  DH gets my coffee and JP says again.&quot; Moma, come <br/>
on.. make the pancakes, I want some, Im hungry&quot;  I reply.. &quot;OK OK.. I <br/>
will, just let me finish this coffee first.. I gotta get woke up&quot;   <br/>
Two minutes later.. &quot;Come on Moma, lets make the pancakes, hurry up <br/>
and drink your coffee&quot;  Well, the coffee was good and hot and I <br/>
couldnt just chug it down. and I also needed to get dressed and use <br/>
the bathroom.  .. So, I said &quot;Honey, I wil make the pancakes, just <br/>
hold on a couple of minutes&quot;   He is still impatiently hurrying me <br/>
up..   So, then I say. &quot; Hey, I&#39;ve got a good idea, why dont you go <br/>
get everything ready to help me make the pancakes&quot;  He says <br/>
enthusiatisically, &quot;OK.. what do I get out&quot;  I tell him the <br/>
ingredients and supplies.. &quot;Flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter, oil. <br/>
the griddle, a bowl and measuring cup&quot;  He thinks a minute and <br/>
says &quot;will you write it down&quot;  I make the list and off he goes.  I <br/>
finish my coffee and get dressed and in about  5 minutes hes back <br/>
upstairs jumping up and down so excited.. &quot; I got it ready, I got <br/>
everything&quot;  &quot;GREAT!.. good job, now lets go make the pancakes!&quot;  He <br/>
helps me measure and stir and everybody is happy.. and the pancakes <br/>
were delicisous ( as usual, since I am a great cook)..   What would <br/>
JP have learned if I had said.. &quot;OK&quot;.. jumped up and ran downstairs <br/>
and made the pancakes right away like he asked?   We compromised..   <br/>
I got to drink my coffee and get woke up and spend 15 mins or so <br/>
getting ready to do downstairs.. He got to feel needed and helpful by <br/>
getting the things ready. PLUS he got to read and follow directions, <br/>
measure and stir.   <br/>

Many people here don&#39;t even read the name of the person posting <br/>
before <br/>
reading, so I doubt the jabs were aimed at you.<br/>
We don&#39;t even know &quot;you&quot;<br/>
We only know what is told to us.<br/>
Elissa<br/>
No one on this board has said YOU are anything of the sort.<br/>
You is generral here, not specific. And I don&#39;t think that you have <br/>
been <br/>
reading long enough BEFORE posting for the first time, otherwise YOU <br/>
would <br/>
understand that already.<br/>
Elissa<br/>
***************<br/>
Thats nothing but a cop out.  When someone says something and another <br/>
person makes a direct response to it, then it is aimed at you.   If I <br/>
say, I eat red meat every day.. Then someone replies.. If you eat red <br/>
meat, you are an animal hater.. Then.. DUHH. obviously they mean I am <br/>
an animal hater..  Comments have been made in direct response to <br/>
statements I have made.  I dont care if folks use my name or not, no <br/>
one is naive enough to think they are &quot;general statements&quot;<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
My 3 (THREE!) year old knows when <br/>
he is tired and asks to go to bed, he knows that if he is not tired <br/>
he can <br/>
watch cartoons quietly in our bed as long as he lets us sleep. He <br/>
knows that <br/>
he needs to stay in our room but wouldn&#39;t be likely to wander the <br/>
apt. at <br/>
night since there&#39;s no one around.<br/>
*****************<br/>
I would suggest keeping your bedroom door locked.   I have <br/>
personally  known of   children getting up at night and wondering <br/>
around the house or even outside. There have to be safety standards <br/>
at practice.  <br/>
******************** <br/>
I would have spent alot of time trying to find ways for him to <br/>
determine deep <br/>
down what was important and let him know that it was ok to do just <br/>
the one.<br/>
Was there other options besided staying home or with the Gparents? <br/>
Could he <br/>
have stayed at a few different friends houses? something really fun <br/>
to make <br/>
up for missing the camping trip?<br/>
Elissa<br/>
********<br/>
All options were offered and refused by Landon.    You know, Ive been <br/>
thinking alot about my own teenage years.  I know that when my folks <br/>
said that I had to be by midnight, I thought they were crazy, just <br/>
trying to be mean and controlling.  Well, now I am an adult, I&#39;ve <br/>
lived 35 years and I have some experience and wisdom.  My folks were <br/>
right....staying out after midnight is not safe..  I wanted to go to <br/>
the beach with my friend my JR year of high school.  I couldnt go <br/>
unless an adult chaperone went too.. OMG, how embarrassing, how awful <br/>
of my parents, how dare they not trust me!!.. Well, guess what, I now <br/>
thank them for the guidance and rules they enforced.   Even with an <br/>
adult along( they didnt follow us around everywhere), we managed to <br/>
get drunk a couple of times, hook up with strange guys, and get lost <br/>
downtown. I would have gotten in WAY more trouble, maybe even dead, <br/>
if there was not an adult along.    I cant agree that children always <br/>
know what is best for them.. They are CHILDREN.  .. how can 13 or 14 <br/>
or 16 years compare to 35 , or 40 , or 60 in knowing about life???  <br/>
It&#39;s funny, I dont resent my parents for caring about me and NOT <br/>
letting me do everything I wanted to.<br/>
****************<br/>
Children really want so little - why can&#39;t they have it, if it&#39;s <br/>
within our <br/>
power?<br/>
Linda<br/>
***********<br/>
My children want a lot that I cant give them.. My son wants a go cart <br/>
for Christmas.   Even if it was within my means, I wouldnt get him <br/>
one because I know that he is implusive and does not have the skills <br/>
to be safe on a go cart.<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
am not sure what you&#39;re talking about. Who is &quot;defensive&quot; <br/>
and &quot;disruptive&quot;?<br/>
For being so UN-schooling you guys sure like to label things and <br/>
people. Is<br/>
this also part of your unschooling approach?<br/>
I am an observer and I express what I&#39;ve been observing. This list <br/>
actually<br/>
smells too much like a clique to me.<br/>
Yol<br/>
You&#39;re free to question anything at all. There are no gods here though<br/>
you&#39;ve been trying to draw a picture of some conflict between gods and<br/>
mortals. That conflict doesn&#39;t exist because we&#39;re all just moms and<br/>
dads<br/>
with ideas about a better life for our kids.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re free to judge my comments, anyone can, but it means little to <br/>
me<br/>
because like everyone else here, my parenting choices have been held <br/>
up<br/>
to much criticism and scrutiny over the years. Theres very little I<br/>
haven&#39;t already heard, although I know I still have much to consider.<br/>
<br/>
***I am an observer and I express what I&#39;ve been observing.***<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this what I did and what you are now so angry about?<br/>
It&#39;s what happens here. We read, we consider, we learn, we question, <br/>
we<br/>
make observations. Is there some part of that seems contrary to what<br/>
this list is for? <br/>
<br/>
Deb L<br/>
**********************<br/>
&quot;Distruptive and defensive&quot; seems to be defined and not agreeing 100% <br/>
with what some others practice..  Also, defending our own practices <br/>
when we are judged harshly for them.  There IS a double standard <br/>
here.. Its so easy to see when reading through the posts.<br/>
***********<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say that Elissa!!<br/>
But you are quite a pretty lil thang....and when I say little people, <br/>
I mean <br/>
she&#39;s about as big around as my ARM!! sheesh<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>

I have looks and brains.. :-)  And, for the record, I am 5&#39;3&quot; and I <br/>
weigh 250 pounds.  <br/>
<br/>
*********<br/>
Anyway just wanted to say Hi. My name is Pam. My children (Dallen-8 <br/>
and <br/>
Phillip-5) have never been to public school, we started out as <br/>
relaxed <br/>
homeschoolers/some unit studies etc. But we dumped that quickly and <br/>
have <br/>
been unschooling ever since. What a group.<br/>
I will go back to lurkdom for a while to get the feel of the group.<br/>
Take care all,<br/>
Pam<br/>
******<br/>
Hmmm, Pam, *squinting my eyes.. you look familar, have I seen you <br/>
somewhere before :-)<br/>
Glad to see you here..<br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The toothpick and marshmallow structures burn BEAUTIFULLY in the <br/>
fireplaces. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I sure wish I would have thought of that. My kids love to burn stuff. <br/>
*********<br/>
Mine too... When we went camping over Thanksgiving, the kids were <br/>
twirling burning sticks ( at my encouragment) to see <br/>
the &quot;fireworks&quot;.. and my son poked the burning stick in his eye.   <br/>
That was a hard lesson learned.. but, I guess more effective than. <br/>
Put that stick down!, you might poke your eye out!  Although, with an <br/>
infection and patched eye for 4 days, JP wished I had made him put <br/>
the stick down. He said. .Moma, why didnt you tell me NO!<br/>
*********<br/>
roasting over the candle at the table<br/>
*******<br/>
Yeah, JP loves candles too.. And he accidentally poured hot wax over <br/>
his head last week.. His hair was glued with molten wax to his head.  <br/>
Its just now starting to flake out.  I guess he learned another good <br/>
lesson . Dont pick up burning pillars candles that are over your head.<br/>
 *********<br/>
OH! Last night one of the kids received a bag of Lego candy! Made of <br/>
sugar---totally edible---and you can build with it TOO! Major cool!<br/>

My kids love those too. Only place I have found them is at Cracker <br/>

Julie asked:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is picking up before watching TV for &quot;parental convenience&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>or &quot;living for<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; principles, not rules&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote> I replied:<br/>
I would say, its for &quot;family convenience&quot; So no one trips and falls.. <br/>
So, <br/>
toys are not lost or broken, so mold doesnt start to grow on dishes. <br/>
And, <br/>
I have to say, its not like a daily thing. .. Its more like. OK guys, <br/>
we cant <br/>
walk in here, there is no where to sit down.. You need to get this <br/>
stuff up <br/>
before the TV comes back on. .. Or.. OK, Ethan, you&#39;ve been playing <br/>
that <br/>
game ( on the PC) for 2 hours, JP wants to play, you can find <br/>
something else <br/>
to do or let him play with you. ..or maybe, JP, I need to finish my <br/>
homework, <br/>
you can play again when Im finished. .. <br/>
<br/>
 **********<br/>
I am curious as to why no one replied to my response.   I have <br/>
replied to many posts and they are basically ignored or only a minute <br/>
part of them responded to..   Maybe I am not on blocked or just my <br/>
messages automaticlly deleted..   Another form or &quot;cliqueness&quot;..  I <br/>
was thinking, this list is a lot like High School.. or heck, even <br/>
middle school.   I want my children to be exposed to diversity, <br/>
accepted for what and who they are and what they beleive ( without <br/>
judgment)  I am an advocate for equality of respect and acceptance.  <br/>
Why do the unschooling police  want to act like a group of Queen <br/>
Bees. that wont allow anyone &quot;in&quot; unless that are clones of them??  <br/>
There have even been subtle advice to &quot;just leave if you dont like <br/>
it&quot;  Well, I am NOT leaving.  I wont be bullied by others into <br/>
agreeing with every aspect of thier lifestyle.  I wont try to change <br/>
them, and again, I must reiterate.. I HAVE NOT JUDGED... I think my <br/>
parenting methods are just as valid and worthy as the next persons.  <br/>
I know I can gain knowledge and learn from others.  I think that <br/>
others can learn from me as well.   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know a lot of you dont give a rats ass what I have to say..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you assume that or have gotten that impression from how you are<br/>
interpretting what people write then you are going to read that attitude<br/>
into people&#39;s replies and it won&#39;t help you hear what they really are<br/>
saying.<br/>
<br/>
I could say the attitude isn&#39;t there. And we could do a yes it is/no it<br/>
isn&#39;t battle. But I can say that people who post here do care about *ideas*<br/>
and the principles of unschooling. If they didn&#39;t, they wouldn&#39;t respond.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I made a statement about how I manage my<br/>
&gt; household, and judgement was passed on me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then it&#39;s because you&#39;ve taken a discussion about an idea and assumed<br/>
someone was saying something personal about you.<br/>
<br/>
It *is* hard to separate ourselves from our ideas. For lots of us we feel<br/>
our ideas *are* us. If our ideas or something we&#39;ve done gets criticized<br/>
then we feel like someone is criticizing us.<br/>
<br/>
Often, I think -- and this *isn&#39;t* personal but talking about the *idea* of<br/>
feeling personal attachment to ideas -- we feel like the choices we make in<br/>
life are on the order of &quot;Do what feels right and hope for the best.&quot; If it<br/>
turns out badly, we can&#39;t be blamed because we&#39;re all just doing the best we<br/>
can and everything is chancy at best anyway.&quot; Criticism would feel like<br/>
someone was saying &quot;Why did you roll a 1. You should have rolled a 6.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the great things about this list is that people *don&#39;t* make<br/>
that assumption. It&#39;s assumed we *can* understand. And we generate a *lot*<br/>
of words talking about the whys of things.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, if someone asks what to do about a kid throwing a tantrum in<br/>
a store, on most parenting lists they&#39;ll get a range of ideas from the<br/>
viewpoint of the gaol being to stop the tantrums. Here people will help dig<br/>
and figure out why the tantrums are happening, what it looks like from the<br/>
child&#39;s point of view, what the parent&#39;s reaction looks like from the<br/>
child&#39;s point of view and then from that understanding, offer what they&#39;ve<br/>
done that works.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that happens -- and this is a biggie -- is that not everyone&#39;s<br/>
parenting goals match the goals of the most frequent posters. This is<br/>
probably the source of the feeling there&#39;s a clique. Some of the frequent<br/>
posters are *very* passionate about applying the principles of unschooling<br/>
to parenting.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s goal is improving their relationship with their child and<br/>
helping the child feel like he has reasonable control over his world and his<br/>
voice is taken seriously then that&#39;s a very different goal from someone who<br/>
would approach the tantrum scenario and say the first thing that must be<br/>
done is getting the child to realize that&#39;s unacceptable behavior.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that end-the-tantrum-now thinking is wrong because it *would* work<br/>
if someone&#39;s goal is changing a child&#39;s behavior. But that the two goals<br/>
coexist about as peacefully as unschooling and curriculum advice do. They<br/>
could coexist if we were just throwing out ideas and people could pick and<br/>
choose from them. But they can&#39;t coexist peacefully if we&#39;re discussing<br/>
principles. And that *is* what many people come to the list for is the<br/>
discussion of the principles and reasoning behind what we do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure lots of people would feel more comfortable if we were just throwing<br/>
out ideas for people to pick and choose from. They&#39;d feel they could<br/>
participate more. But lots of people *wouldn&#39;t* like that because they do<br/>
want to extend the principles of unschooling into parenting. And that isn&#39;t<br/>
something people can get too many places. Whereas they can get general<br/>
parenting advice just about anywhere.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This one&#39;s more difficult to translate into understandable terms.<br/>
<br/>
This is, again, about the *idea* behind what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m not<br/>
criticizing you or saying I&#39;m better.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the type of parenting discussed here (is there a word for it?<br/>
&quot;The type of parenting discussed here&quot; and &quot;extending unschooling principles<br/>
into parenting&quot; is awfully awkward!) *isn&#39;t* to teach a child how to judge<br/>
what is and isn&#39;t important from an adult&#39;s point of view. We trust that<br/>
what is important will change as the child matures. The goal is to model the<br/>
respect we&#39;d like them to give to others.<br/>
<br/>
From the child&#39;s point of view this scenario is &quot;I&#39;ve got something I think<br/>
is important enough to interrupt you for.&quot; If we respond with &quot;No, you&#39;ve<br/>
judged wrong. Even though from your point of view two adults talking looks<br/>
unimportant, it&#39;s just one of those thing you have to remember is more<br/>
important,&quot; what have we modeled for them? We&#39;ve modeled that you dole out<br/>
your attention based on your perception of the world, not on the trust and<br/>
regard you have for someone.<br/>
<br/>
If you came to a child all excited -- something on the level of excitement<br/>
your 7 yo is expressing, like aliens landed in the back yard ;-) -- and he<br/>
said &quot;Just a minute&quot; and returned to something that from your point of view<br/>
looked trivial and you persisted that it was *really* important, how would<br/>
you want him to respond?<br/>
<br/>
If we come to someone all excited about something, we&#39;d want them to trust<br/>
that we weren&#39;t interrupting for frivolous reasons and that it really was<br/>
important. So that&#39;s what we should model for our kids. We should show that<br/>
we trust their judgement and respond how we&#39;d want others to respond to us.<br/>
<br/>
If we want children to treat others with respect, then we need to treat them<br/>
with respect. *Not* when *we* think they deserve respect but when *they*<br/>
think they deserve respect. Sometimes it helps to translate a scenario into<br/>
a husband and wife scenario.<br/>
<br/>
If we say to our husband &quot;This is something I&#39;m *really* excited about,&quot; --<br/>
like having won a million dollars -- we&#39;d want our husbands to interrupt<br/>
what they&#39;re doing and pay attention to us. We wouldn&#39;t want them to react<br/>
in a way that said &quot;Regardless of the tone you&#39;re using, I think I&#39;m a<br/>
better judge of what is important enough to interrupt this conversation<br/>
for.&quot; (Now doesn&#39;t that sound condescending?)<br/>
<br/>
(Now if the child were interrupting every 5 seconds, that&#39;s a different<br/>
scenario. Trying to get across the whys and wherefores of this kind of<br/>
thinking doesn&#39;t work well with made up scenarios that can be what-ifed into<br/>
a corner. It&#39;s the motivations behind the actions that are important, not<br/>
the actions so it works best with real scenarios.)<br/>
<br/>
In order for kids to know we take what they say seriously we have to see<br/>
what the world looks like from their point of view. We can&#39;t judge the<br/>
importance of something from the adult point of view and second guess their<br/>
judgement. We have to let them know we trust their judgement.<br/>
<br/>
Maturity *will* bring a *different* (not necessarily better ;-)<br/>
understanding about what is and isn&#39;t important.<br/>
<br/>
The other part of the model is to model respect for what others feel is<br/>
important by respecting what *children* think is important. So if a child is<br/>
in the middle of a video game or something that doesn&#39;t look important to us<br/>

different than what is important to an adult. If not, you could model it for<br/>
her :-) That it is the level of importance to the child we need to respond<br/>
to rather than the thing the child is interrupting us for.<br/>

doesn&#39;t model giving. It models the stronger gets to have their way.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in the early years it *is* unbalanced. But that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t<br/>
tell them when we&#39;re honestly tired. But we do it *not* because we want to<br/>
teach them to respect our feelings. But because we want to model being<br/>
honest about feelings and respecting ones self.<br/>
<br/>
We model respect when we respect their expressions of their feelings. Even<br/>
when we judge that they can&#39;t be as tired (or whatever) as they say they<br/>
are. We have to trust that they are being honest about their feelings and<br/>
respond accordingly and we will be modeling how to respond to other&#39;s<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all a bit airy-fairy and really needs some real life scenarios to<br/>
make it clear.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; getting ready to do downstairs.. He got to feel needed and helpful by<br/>
&gt; getting the things ready. PLUS he got to read and follow directions,<br/>
&gt; measure and stir.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, that was a good win-win solution! That was very creative! (And it&#39;s also<br/>
why real life scenarios are much better to use as discussion points than<br/>
made up ones.)<br/>
<br/>
I probably just compounded the misunderstanding in my last post ;-) But what<br/>
I&#39;m trying to say is that we can&#39;t train kids to judge what is important and<br/>
what isn&#39;t but insiting that they respect that some adult needs are more<br/>
important than kid needs. (But we can model respect for self by letting them<br/>
know what our needs are.) We help them learn respect by treating them with<br/>
respect. Instead of saying, &quot;No, you have to wait because my need for coffee<br/>
is greater than your need for pancakes,&quot; you showed respect for his feelings<br/>
(that pancakes were important) by suggesting something that he could do to<br/>
help you meet his needs which cleverly got your own needs met at the same<br/>
time. :-)<br/>

they are attacking you and not your idea. And you&#39;ll get hurt a lot.<br/>
<br/>
To keep it in the realm of realish scenarios a more likely exchange is:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We unschool except for math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s not unschooling.&quot; And someone would usually go on to explain why<br/>
they don&#39;t think &quot;unschool except for math&quot; fits in with their concept of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
People will read it as though it said &quot;You&#39;re not an unschooler.&quot; But that&#39;s<br/>
not what the statement says. It&#39;s talking about the *idea* of unschooling<br/>
and the *idea* of whether it can encompass the concept of mandated math<br/>
instruction.<br/>
<br/>
Because someone objected, does it mean the second person is right and their<br/>
idea of what unschooling is overrides anyone else&#39;s? No. It means the first<br/>
person should tell us how they see mandated math fitting into the<br/>
unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably shake out into two different definitions of unschooling<br/>
with two different goals.<br/>
<br/>
And the clash between differing goals is where the rigidness gets sensed.<br/>
<br/>
The goals of unschooling -- as defined here -- are pretty broad! But they<br/>
*are* child centered, child respectful. (No matter how it gets described it<br/>
gets interpretted to mean something no one means!)  And any ideas that don&#39;t<br/>
have the goal of child respect in mind do get questioned.<br/>
<br/>
So why is there so much adamancy from some very vocal people that the &quot;child<br/>
centered&quot; (whatever you&#39;d call it!) viewpoint is right?<br/>
<br/>
The How To Talk So Your Kids Will Listen book was when I first saw that<br/>
children see the world differently than we do. (I mean something more<br/>
profound than what those words are saying!) I mean that to an adult it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;obvious&quot; that the living room should be kept cleaned up. But to a child<br/>
it&#39;s &quot;obvious&quot; that it makes no sense to spend time putting things away that<br/>
they&#39;re just going to take out tomorrow. Most people would say the adult is<br/>
right. But we&#39;re *both* right. We just have different view points. Different<br/>
priorities. But if I insist that my viewpoint is right because I&#39;m an adult<br/>
and know better (or whatever justification I use), how does that model<br/>
solving problems when two people disagree? It doesn&#39;t. It models the<br/>
stronger person gets their way and the weaker person gives in.<br/>
<br/>
Once I started seeing how different the world looked from a child&#39;s point of<br/>
view (based on what was important to them) I started to see how the messages<br/>
I thought I was sending were being received very differently. When I thought<br/>
I was saying &quot;I&#39;ve had more experience so that&#39;s why I know my way is<br/>
right,&quot; what she was hearing was &quot;Your ideas aren&#39;t as good. I&#39;m bigger and<br/>
stronger so we get to do it my way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That *doesn&#39;t* mean I then switched my attitude to her way is right because<br/>
that&#39;s how she sees it. It meant that I had to be conscious of how she<br/>
viewed the world in order to understand what I was communicating. For<br/>
example if I dragged her around all day doing errands from my point of view<br/>
it was communicating that there are just some things in life we have to do.<br/>
But what she was hearing is that bigger people get to override the feelings<br/>
of littler people.<br/>
<br/>
Even if there are some times when there are things we have to do, shouldn&#39;t<br/>
the message of stronger people get to override weaker people&#39;s feelings be<br/>
reserved for emergencies? Was getting errands done worth that message? Was<br/>
that a message I wanted her to hear every week? (And that was just for<br/>
errands! There were other times I was unconsciously sending that message<br/>
too.)<br/>
<br/>
I put that into a husband scenario. What if my husband dragged me around all<br/>
day to sporting goods stores and made me stay by his side not touching<br/>
anything? What if when I asked when we could go home, he said soon -- which<br/>
really meant as long as it takes me to be done? What if I said I was hungry<br/>
and he said hold on until we get home because the food here&#39;s too expensive?<br/>
Or he said I could have something inexpensive on his approved list?<br/>
<br/>
It made me more conscious that a lot of the things I thought I had to do<br/>
were really things I *chose* to do. I didn&#39;t *have* to shop with her. I<br/>
didn&#39;t even have to shop. It was just more convenient for me. I was sending<br/>
the message that it was okay to inconvenience her for my convenience.<br/>
<br/>
Those realizations didn&#39;t make me stop shopping ;-) But I&#39;m more conscious<br/>
of what she&#39;s putting up with for my convenience. I *appreciate* that she&#39;s<br/>
inconveniencing herself on the times I&#39;m not clever enough or good enough<br/>
about planning ahead. I say &quot;Thank you!&quot; And I buy her expensive mall food.<br/>
:-) My goal is to treat her the way I&#39;d want my husband to treat me if he<br/>
were inconveniencing me that way. (I ain&#39;t perfect! I&#39;m still selfish and<br/>
stubborn. But I&#39;m better than I was and every time I have to put the<br/>
thoughts into words I grow.)<br/>
<br/>
Once I realized I wasn&#39;t trapped by all the &quot;have tos&quot; I started seeing more<br/>
options for problems. There were more options than the standard &quot;have tos&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s also freeing. Once you realize that you don&#39;t have to cook every night,<br/>
that you *could* have take out pizza everynight if you wanted to do that,<br/>
then cooking everynight isn&#39;t so much of a chore. I do it because I *choose*<br/>
to to save money, make more healthy things and so on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All options were offered and refused by Landon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there wasn&#39;t much you could do in that situation. The limitations<br/>
were natural but he perceived them as imposed and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s because<br/>
that&#39;s the way he&#39;s most familiar with problems being solved in the family.<br/>
<br/>
I think for adults it&#39;s natural to solve family problems by analyzing the<br/>
situation and then suggesting the most practical solution(s) and the goal is<br/>
to get the kids to agree to one of them. Though it solves the immediate<br/>
problem efficiently, it also creates other problems in the long run. Those<br/>
other problems may be a small price to pay -- as they are for most parents<br/>
-- for the efficiency of dealing with things that way. Those other problems<br/>
may be seen as self-correcting with maturity and things we just have to put<br/>
up with.<br/>
<br/>
But people here would argue that the problems it creates are more profound<br/>
than they seem on the surface because they involve relationships. And it<br/>
substitutes learning (how to problem solve) by watching for learning by<br/>
doing. And it creates control for a teen to fight against rather than<br/>
opportunities to figure out how to problem solve.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of stories here of how people trust their kids and the result<br/>
of that trust. (Sandra has recently told about Kirby and Mary B about her<br/>
daughter.) It takes sacrificing some guarantees to get something that&#39;s even<br/>
better. And it isn&#39;t about letting go to let them sink or swim. It&#39;s about<br/>
creating a relationship where they see family as those who are there to help<br/>
them solve their problems rather than as part of their problems.<br/>
<br/>
So people here will speak up when they see someone offering parenting advice<br/>
that creates the relationship problems they know don&#39;t have to exist. That<br/>
speaking up is a source of conflict on the list because not everyone accepts<br/>
that the &quot;normal&quot; parent-kid relationships are a problem worth solving. But<br/>
I know that the traditional parent-teen conflict isn&#39;t the type of<br/>
relationship I want to have with my daughter. I want something better and I<br/>
see the type of relationship I do want and it&#39;s coming out of the conscious<br/>
parenting explained here, not from traditional parenting advice.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a really good book for anyone who is interested called Parent/Teen<br/>
Breakthrough: The Relationship Approach by Mira Kirshenbaum and Charles<br/>
Foster. Pam S recommends it often and it&#39;s very good :-)<br/>

&gt; to be safe on a go cart.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This comes from perceiving that people are saying &quot;Give your kids everything<br/>
they want.&quot; But we&#39;re saying help them figure out what they want and help<br/>
them figure out ways to get it. If we become the locked door that stands<br/>
between them and what they want, the only option we&#39;re giving them is to<br/>
push against us or sneak around us. If we stand beside them and help them<br/>
figure out how they can get from where they are to where they want to be,<br/>
then we become their partner.<br/>
<br/>
Would your rather be a door or a partner? The people who perceive their<br/>
relathionship as partners to their kids have relationships that I admire.<br/>
They aren&#39;t without conflict but the conflict arises from personal<br/>
differences rather than from the power struggle of a stronger person making<br/>
a weaker person do what&#39;s &quot;right&quot;. (Personally getting alog with people is<br/>
hard enough that I don&#39;t want to compound it by adding in a layer of power<br/>
struggle!)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t offer advice from experience on the go kart since I&#39;ve got a quiet<br/>
kid who isn&#39;t a teen yet! And your son&#39;s been controlled so trying out<br/>
letting go of control on a go kart sounds like failure waiting to happen.<br/>
Like when control is let go on anything: tv, food, school, kids binge on<br/>
what they&#39;ve been denied. Kids will binge on freedom too if they feel that&#39;s<br/>
been controlled. But if he feels that his own life is in the decisions he<br/>
makes, then he&#39;s going to be a lot more sensible. He won&#39;t make the same<br/>
choices you would. He may take risks! (There probably was no holding Evel<br/>
Knievel back. And since his son followed in his motorcycle tracks there was<br/>
undoubtedly genetic factors.) But he&#39;s more likely to take more risks if<br/>
what he&#39;s really doing is fighting control.<br/>
<br/>
I know that in partnership relationships that the children know their<br/>
parents are there to help any way they can and they do care. They know that<br/>
advice is advice and not control. Partnership parents might find a trusted<br/>
adult who could advise the teen about go karts. (It&#39;s often a whole lot<br/>
easier to hear advice from somone who&#39;s been there and still doing that than<br/>
from worrying parents.)<br/>

&gt; here.. Its so easy to see when reading through the posts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it usually means having goals that differ. We tend to assume we all<br/>
have the same goals -- what&#39;s best for our kids -- but what we really mean<br/>
by that isn&#39;t the same across the board. And sometimes if we talk about our<br/>
goals we&#39;d agree we had the same but we&#39;re actually not prioritizing them<br/>
the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Though I don&#39;t doubt that most parents would say their relationship with<br/>
their children was paramount, that really isn&#39;t true in practice because we<br/>
strain it everytime we override what they want for what we want. (And, no,<br/>
the other option isn&#39;t their overriding what we want for what they want!) We<br/>
can justify those times! so it seems like those are just exceptions to the<br/>
rule. But the parents who really do put relationshps first can offer good<br/>
advice on how we don&#39;t have to sacrifice relationships and how to build even<br/>
better ones.<br/>
<br/>
So if people want the list to be about sharing practices then they&#39;re going<br/>
to have a hard time here because people will persist in talking about<br/>
principles behind our practices. That&#39;s what&#39;s really valuable about this<br/>
list. &quot;What works&quot; isn&#39;t good enough. It&#39;s the principles behind what works.<br/>
It&#39;s digging deep to see the relationships and how things look from kid<br/>
points of view. It seeing what the consequences are of that kid perception<br/>
and ways to avoid those problems.<br/>

<br/>
Or it may be a matter of thinking you&#39;re asking questions when you&#39;re really<br/>

happens a lot, then it&#39;s worth wondering if you&#39;re not being read the way<br/>
you intend.<br/>
<br/>
From a certain perspective the list may seem like a big party or an<br/>
afternoon let&#39;s-all-kick-back-and-chat get together. That sets up<br/>
expectations of &quot;Welcome!&quot;s and nods and smiles and pats on the back and<br/>
&quot;Would you like some cookies?&quot; and other feedback that we&#39;re welcome and<br/>
others are listening to what we&#39;re saying that we&#39;d normally get from that<br/>
type of gathering. (And cheery chit chat between people who&#39;ve met people<br/>
here they&#39;ve come to feel are friends probably reinforces that.) But those<br/>
are false expectations. The list isn&#39;t a tea party gathering of people who<br/>
call themselves unschoolers or wannabe unschoolers. It&#39;s a discussion list<br/>
specifically about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Some people do find this list a place to kick back because they share or are<br/>
drawn to the ideas they read about here. That&#39;s just a side effect. It&#39;s<br/>
just a consequence of sharing the ideals of the place you happen to be in.<br/>
But creating that kick-back feeling isn&#39;t the goal of this list and it<br/>
doesn&#39;t try to be that. It&#39;s a place for discussing the unschooling<br/>
philosophy. If soemone is looking for a place to kick back then, unless they<br/>
are drawn to the type of unschooling ideas expressed here, they would<br/>
probably find other lists an easier fit.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not telling anyone to get out. It&#39;s suggesting people examine what it<br/>
is they want from a list and not just assume everyone wants the same and<br/>
that every list offers it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to discuss the unschooling philsophy, this is a really great<br/>
place for it :-) If you want to know more about extending the unschooling<br/>
philosophy into parenting it&#39;s also a great place. Some people may find<br/>
other things here that the list wasn&#39;t designed for but the list can&#39;t be<br/>
faulted for not being something that it doesn&#39;t intend to be.<br/>
