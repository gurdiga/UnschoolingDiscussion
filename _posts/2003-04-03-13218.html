<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137731886">I was contacted today by a woman whose 10 year old son is in a <br/>
teacher-friend&#39;s class at a private school for &quot;broken&quot; children---for <br/>
children with learning differences. My friend (a big John Holt fan) <br/>
recommended that she talk with me about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Usually when I talk about it, it&#39;s to someone who&#39;s skeptical about the whole <br/>
homeschooling idea---unschooling is just TOO far a leap. At the end, I&#39;m <br/>
exhausted and depressed. Well, today was downright FUN! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it helps that her son has been &quot;labeled&quot;---but she can see how unique <br/>
and brilliant he is. He came home one day last week and proudly told his mom <br/>
that he was an &quot;outside-the-box thinker&quot;. At least HE doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s <br/>
dumb!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she was VERY excited about the whole unschooling philosophy and is <br/>
coming over next week to hang with us. She&#39;ll be reading the boards, and I&#39;m <br/>
inviting her to unschoolingdotcomedy ( I hope it&#39;s a GOOD place for a while! &lt;<br/>
G&gt;). And she&#39;ll be at the conference with her husband and boys.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just GIDDY! And wanted to share. Most unschooling conversations with <br/>
&quot;non-believers&quot; don&#39;t turn out this well, and I&#39;m thrilled!<br/>

Cool, Kelly,  so often I get the, &quot;you must be from outer space look&quot;.   Nice to hear there is another reaction!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh,   and I got the tapes!  Thanks,  I&#39;m going to listen to Anne O&#39;s tonight.<br/>
