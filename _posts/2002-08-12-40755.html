Your plan sounds good to me.<br/>

That is a common symptom of school&#39;s damage. Kids often feel, &quot;If that is<br/>
what learning or reading is, then get me away from it.&quot;<br/>
Well, you&#39;re trying to do that. Charter schools, as you know, are public<br/>
schools in sheeps&#39; clothing, but change is usually good. This list is<br/>
cheering for you as you make the transition with your son. It&#39;s never too<br/>
late. Trust yourself.<br/>
