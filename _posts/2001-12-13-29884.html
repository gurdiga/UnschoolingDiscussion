<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397613521">Just tossing this out for consideration.......<br/>
<br/>
I saw a blurb in a magazine (Family Life or Family Fun) which staed a &quot;new<br/>
study&quot; has found that childrn who come from neat and clean homes perform<br/>
better academically.   Of course,  there was no real article explaining the<br/>
&quot;research&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try to find the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I question this myself.  I have a sil who keeps her house sp tidy,  people<br/>
get uncomfortable.  I remember once while visiting,  her 13 yo son asked if<br/>
he could have hot cocoa.  It was about 9p.m. and sil had cleaned the<br/>
kitchen.  She said &#39;no&#39;,  she didn&#39;t want to make it for him.  He said he&#39;d<br/>
make it.    He was not allowed because she felt she couldn&#39;t trust him to<br/>
make it without creating a mess.   Anyhow,  I think my nephews do well in<br/>
school.....but they may not be able to fend for themselves in &#39;real&#39; life!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just rationalizing our mess....but how in the world will they<br/>
learn anything if they aren&#39;t allowed to &#39;mess up&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
OTOH,  I do find an organized environment enables me to function/focus<br/>
better.  If nothing else,  it saves time when trying to do something if you<br/>
know where things are and where they go.  It&#39;s hard for me to find a<br/>
balance.  We do have six people living in a 1250 sq ft house...including one<br/>
toddler and a 3 yr old.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted some toughts on this....as far as how environment neatness<br/>
effects children.  Do you think neatness/organization is a learned trait or<br/>
innate?  Do you yourself or do you observe your children having behavior<br/>
differences with different environments?<br/>

I think it depends on how you define &quot;academically&quot;.  I think <br/>
children from organized homes probably do better in public schools <br/>
for a couple of reasons.  One, they can find their homework (and are <br/>
probably forced to do it at a specific time every day) and so always <br/>
have it ready to turn in. Two, they are used to thing having to &#39;be&#39; <br/>
a certain way so they don&#39;t think outside the box as much as those <br/>
from the more eclectic homes would.<br/>
<br/>
When there were 5 of us living in a 1000 sq ft house, it was a <br/>
disaster.  It had reached the point where we never even had people <br/>
over becasue there simply was no room.  Now we have more than twice <br/>
that amount of space but we still aren&#39;t neat freaks.  My kids do <br/>
well on tests and such but they would NEVER get good grades in high <br/>
school.  They&#39;d probably be kicked out for being too annoying.  <br/>
Rachel would make most of the teachers look like idiots because she <br/>
is not a fraid to correct or question an adult in public of the <br/>
subject matter is &quot;academic&quot;.  Jenni would be the kid with her <br/>
fiction book hidden inside the textbook everyday.<br/>
<br/>
But back to the question, I think most of the really great inventors <br/>
were a bit on the tend-to-be-cluttered side and I think it goes with <br/>
the territory of a cluttered, busy mind.<br/>

This study, just from what you say about it, reminds me of the time that<br/>
there was great excitement about somebody discovering a neurological test<br/>
that would predict violence and delinquency in young children. Supposedly,<br/>
there was a disorder which caused certain children to &quot;mispronounce&quot; certain<br/>
words in certain ways, and these children were much more likely to later<br/>
exhibit violent or delinquent behavior.<br/>
<br/>
So....guess how they pronounced the words? Like people who speak Black<br/>
English (or whatever it&#39;s called now - I was out of the country for years)<br/>
do. Why did they speak this way? Because they were disproportionately<br/>
African American, and lived in high crime areas in low-income families,<br/>
where Black English is most commonly spoken.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, nothing new had really been discovered. But if somebody had<br/>
announced that low-income African American kids from high-crime areas were<br/>
disproportionately represented in juvenile lockups, it wouldn&#39;t have made<br/>
headlines. It probably wouldn&#39;t even have made headlines if somebody had<br/>
said this was the case with kids who spoke Black English. (Yes, I know that<br/>
these kids are also disproportionately found guilty when they&#39;re really<br/>
innocent.)<br/>
<br/>
Because it was dressed it up as a neurologically-based disorder (the<br/>
&quot;symptom&quot; was something very specific, like dropping the final &quot;s&quot; on verbs<br/>
in the third person), and it was &quot;discovered&quot; by means of a big scientific<br/>
study, it sounded like a breakthrough.<br/>
<br/>
On the &quot;neatness&quot; study itself: I would think that any sample might include,<br/>
for example, families that are on the brink of falling apart in all ways. I<br/>
mean, if your mom&#39;s an alcoholic and your dad&#39;s suicidal, the house is<br/>
likely to be a mess, but we couldn&#39;t conclude that the cause of your failing<br/>
grades is simply messiness and that you&#39;d pass your tests if somebody got a<br/>
cleaning service in there once a week.<br/>
<br/>
Another question, of course, is whether &quot;performing better academically&quot;<br/>
just means jumping through the hoops in school (which you might be more<br/>
likely to do if you came from the kind of home where the parents are<br/>
generally strict, both about schoolwork and about neatness). If that&#39;s the<br/>
kind of &quot;success&quot; the study is pointing to, why do we care? If it&#39;s IQ<br/>
scores, I&#39;m still unimpressed, both because I don&#39;t believe those scores<br/>
mean much and because of the iffiness of neatness as the cause.<br/>
<br/>
My main point is that there&#39;s a big difference between showing some kind of<br/>
link and showing that one thing caused the other.<br/>
