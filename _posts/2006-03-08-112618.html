<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130683972">Nearly everybody (although not our family) have<br/>
microwaves and all have ovens/stovetops although<br/>
perhaps smaller than in the US - more like in the UK. <br/>
However, we are not stingy with out refridgerators and<br/>
the size most people get by with in the UK we call a<br/>
bar fridge.  The reason I suppose is because this is a<br/>
very hot country.  Things that you could leave in the<br/>
cupboard in the UK (bread, butter) you would want to<br/>
keep in the fridge here.  Old houses have spaces for<br/>
short small fridges but all new houses have spaces for<br/>
large two door fridges and microwaves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t soda drinkers in this country the way<br/>
Americans are.  We call it fizzy drink and tend to buy<br/>
small bottles at the store and drink them right away,<br/>
buy bigger bottles to take home for parties or<br/>
purchase it at Americal style fast food outlets<br/>
(MacDonalds, Burger King etc.)  <br/>
<br/>
We are also a rather multicultural country and things<br/>
like rice cookers and electric stir fryers as well as<br/>
the good old crock pots are common.  <br/>
<br/>
What we are really big on are bbqs and every family<br/>
has one and many cook all meals on them and gatherings<br/>
of family and friends outdoors often revolve around a<br/>
large bbq cook up.  They are provided everywhere for<br/>
free on beaches, at nature reserves, parks etc.  We<br/>
cook our dinner outside on our gas bbq more nights<br/>
than not.  The beauty of this is that traditionally<br/>
Dad is the chief bbq cook (man and fire and all that)<br/>
and this gives Mum the night off...unless you&#39;re like<br/>
me whose hubby does all the cooking anyway indoors or<br/>
out.<br/>
