My own private magic wand allows me to see, but not be affected by, the rude <br/>
drivers, petty people and mean neighbors. I use it to allow my true self , <br/>
that which is beyond this human form, to shine. My true self can&#39;t be <br/>
bothered with petty grudges. They just flow on by.<br/>

Yes I think this is what changed in me {but I still have to work on it. In Wicca {I&#39;m not quite Wiccan but close to the understanding} What you put out, returns to you 3 fold. {somewhat like do unto others...}<br/>
<br/>
I started thinking about each and every thought, action, and especially spoken word. Because I feel some truth in it {not that it will effect me now but maybe sometime in the future, and i might not accually &quot;see&quot; the effect} I didn&#39;t want &quot;negitive&quot; to return to affect{or is it effect, i get confused lol} me or my family. I think that aggression can create positive or negitive energy around us and what we are is what we attract. I also work on negitive thoughts, when I catch myself thinking negitive, I try to remember a worse situation that I could be in. {If I&#39;m frustrated with the dishes, I think of my grandmother who didn&#39;t have indoor heated running water for most of her life..}<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m human and sometimes get bummed out, but it has helped me a great deal in how i react and that seems to affect{?} those around me...<br/>
<br/>
I think since I explained it to my husband {without pressure just a suggestion} he does it sometimes too, of course quietly to himself without my knowledge - LOL.<br/>

I call that karma. :o) No use putting more bad karma out into the <br/>
universe.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think that aggression can create positive or negitive energy <br/>

<br/>
I have found this to be true in my life also. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I also work on negitive thoughts, when I catch myself thinking <br/>
 </span></blockquote>negitive, I try to remember a worse situation that I could be in.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just try to catch myself. I stop in my tracks and just become aware <br/>
of the thoughts and emotions as they are approaching. They lose so <br/>
much power that way. I let them flow on through and past me me and <br/>
then I can remain in the NOW, where...<br/>
