This is a school out of Toronto.  It was one of the links in an e-mail  I got <br/>
today that wasn&#39;t really about unschooling (was about homeschooling in  <br/>
general), but I clicked all the links and this one is really pretty cool.<br/>
 <br/>
Even if one&#39;s not interested in signing up for one of their distance or  <br/>
in-person programs, the website is pretty and interesting, and in my life it  <br/>
seems when I learn something kind of obscure and new this way, within just a  <br/>
couple or three months, someone will ask &quot;So... do you know anywhere that  <br/>
does...[whatever it is].&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So now you all know where people can learn Arabic and study Islam from home  <br/>
even if they&#39;re in Kansas or somewhere non-Mosquesque.<br/>
