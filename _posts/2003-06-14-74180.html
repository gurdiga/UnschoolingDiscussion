<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177661756">We&#39;re into our fourth year of hs&#39;ing and so far I&#39;ve really lucked out<br/>
in the way of avoiding turning in any documentation. The first year we<br/>
moved out of district, the second year I guess they just forgot us and<br/>
the third year we tested thru Family Learning Org. for my ds (state<br/>
requirement for 8th grade, tho we don&#39;t really do grades), I didn&#39;t<br/>
need to worry about doing anyting for my dd becuz she was under six.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad we did the testing tho becuz somebody recently turned me in<br/>
for educational neglect and I was able to show the social worker ds&#39;s<br/>
test scores. Ds is really into body boarding and surfing, we live on<br/>
the beach and I guess it upsets some people to see him out there in<br/>
the water so much.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this year dd will be six and I know from other&#39;s that the<br/>
elementary school doesn&#39;t forget hs&#39;ers and I have to report to the<br/>
high school for ds so I&#39;m looking for an easy way to handle the<br/>
reporting part of hs&#39;ing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear how you folks handle this. I hate doing paper work<br/>
and wouldn&#39;t do anything if I had my way. I know my kids are learning<br/>
and don&#39;t really worry about it, could care less about the<br/>
educationalese of it all.<br/>
<br/>
TIA. Aloha, Darlene</div>
