<div id="ygrps-yiv-396435801">Shelly asked:    &lt;&lt;&lt;So what would a true unschooler do?  Do I go with the <br/>
idea that he understands what kind of teacher she is, and must really be <br/>
interested, so let him take the class?  Or he&#39;s young and forgiving and <br/>
doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;ll probably revert to her usual teaching style & he&#39;ll <br/>
come home crying again, so he shouldn&#39;t take the class?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Shelly, I think that maybe a great way to word the question is &quot;what would a <br/>
homeschooling mom that knows and loves her kids do?&quot;  Rather than reach to <br/>
achieve a standard conforming to unschooling, listen to the urge to learn and <br/>
the fabulous interest that remains in your son&#39;s voice as he&#39;s asking to take <br/>
her science class.  He learned a valuable lesson in the process of the first <br/>
class. I would discuss it with him and remind him that there may be the same <br/>
situation.  The fact that there is this great learning opportunity that he <br/>
really enjoyed and LEARNED from is what I understand homeschooling to be <br/>
about. The freedom for the children to have free reign in learning all they <br/>
can with all the opportunities we can give them.<br/>
I speak as a homeschooling mom that is not an expert but has wonderful <br/>
success and loves h/s.  I don&#39;t intend to offend any unschooling mom&#39;s here <br/>
that think my post is a challenge to unschooling. I think when we strive to <br/>
fit a paradigm we may miss some extra bonuses in life. Sounds like your son <br/>
found a great bonus there and he would benefit from more of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is very true.  As long as the person who is attending the <br/>
classes is making the choice to go back, it should be fine.  <br/>
Discussing the expectations is good.  Discussing them with the teacher <br/>
is good also.  And one of the things I stress with my girls when they <br/>
take a class is that the important part is that they learn and enjoy <br/>
it, not that they produce some evidence of the experience in the form <br/>
of tests or homework papers.<br/>

what kind of lesson he learned.  And that is what this mom is <br/>
doing.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s wonderful that, that is how you see homeschooling.  Many do <br/>
not.  This list is to discuss Unschooling.  Not, to brainwash and <br/>
make people conform to some standard.  There are many places and <br/>
people in the world who would be happy to fill children with lies <br/>
about how learning HAS to be.  This list is a place where we can <br/>
discuss how to help our children through these situations.  To THINK, <br/>
and not just conform.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is offensive to come to an unschooling board and tell people they <br/>
are stiving to meet a paradigm and missing bonuses because of it.<br/>
To basically put down unschooling and the strives people are making <br/>
to learn more about it.<br/>
Your post isn&#39;t a &quot;challenge&quot; as you seem to hope.  But it is an <br/>
annoyance.  It&#39;s something we get all the time IRL and other places <br/>
on the internet.  This place is for talking about unschooling.  NOT <br/>
to defend it.<br/>

I think what Kristine is saying is that it is important to consider <br/>
what Shelly&#39;s son wants to do and not try to decide whether it fits <br/>
some artificial standard here.  <br/>
<br/>
If he wants to go back even after a bit of unpleasantness at the <br/>
beginning than he did learn something important - - he learned how to <br/>
disassociate the past negative feelings from the class in general.  He <br/>
also probably has figured out how to deal with it now too.  And in the <br/>
end, it sounds like it will be his decision to go back or not.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As an unschooler, would you let a child take part, if they wanted <br/>
to, <br/>
knowing the teacher&#39;s style, despite possible harm to self-image?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I would assume she wanted different UNSCHOOLERS opinions to take and <br/>
evaluate and use as she sees fit.<br/>
I see no &quot;artificial standards&quot; here.  (another insulting <br/>
implication)  I see people sharing their lives and their opinion <br/>
about education.<br/>
Just because people are curious as to how unschoolers would handle <br/>
situations, doesn&#39;t mean they are idiots who will blindly follow.<br/>
Have a little faith!<br/>

now we can *trust her* to decide what makes sense to her. :-)<br/>
