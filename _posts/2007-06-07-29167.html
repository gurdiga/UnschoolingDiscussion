<div id="ygrps-yiv-88946540">My thought is that too many people accept the mainstream ideas withOUT <br/>
thinking at all. Then they come to us wondering why we think <br/>
differently about these things. And they assume it&#39;s all &quot;black and <br/>
white&quot; or completely exclusive. They don&#39;t understand that they have <br/>
options.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest eye-opener for me was when my sisters-in-inlaw ambushed me <br/>
and Ben several years ago about unschooling. It happens every day on <br/>
these lists, but coming from family all at once was something else.<br/>
<br/>
They had all this &quot;research&quot; to throw at us. NONE of it valid in an <br/>
unschooling/mindful home.<br/>

&quot;Would you allow them to have cake and ice cream for breakfast?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do you allow them to play video games ALL DAY?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t they have to read 30 minutes each day?&quot;<br/>
&quot;You allow them to watch anything they want on tv? Aren&#39;t you worried <br/>

&quot;They NEED their rest! If they can stay up as late as they want, when <br/>
will they sleep?&quot;<br/>
&quot;No parental controls on the TV or computer? What about child <br/>
molesters?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They just couldn&#39;t wrap their heads around the idea that my children <br/>
simply have CHOICES.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they may have cake and ice cream for breakfast, but they CHOOSE to <br/>
make eggs and chicken and a bagel.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they can play games all day, but they CHOOSE to jump on the <br/>
trampoline and swim and read and cook and nap.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they can watch whatever they want on TV, but they CHOOSE to watch <br/>
SpongeBob and That 70s show and Good Eats!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they have no chores, but they CHOOSE to clean and help with *many* <br/>
things around the house---out of love and thoughtfulness and kindness.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they have no bedtimes, so they sleep when they are tired and get <br/>
up when they are rested---remember they don&#39;t *have* to be up at 6:00am <br/>
for the bus!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have been where they are. I was a traditional, conventional <br/>
parent (as were our own parents). But I changed. I tried something new. <br/>
I believe that I made the best choice. Because, I believed, there WAS a <br/>
choice to be made.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing that pisses me off is that they are coming at this <br/>
 from ONE point of view. They know no other. They&#39;ve done NO research. <br/>
They&#39;ve never even questioned *why* they are doing what they&#39;re doing. <br/>
They simply *DO*. No questions. No explanations. That&#39;s just the way it <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
*I*, on the other hand, have *been* where they are. I was raised in a <br/>
very similar manner (and Ben was raised WITH them in the SAME manner). <br/>
I have been to school. I have sent my child to school. I have <br/>
substitute taught in school. I have taken my child out of school. And I <br/>
have decided to unschool. I have BEEN on all sides of the fence, as <br/>
well as ON it; and I have made the best possible choice that *I* can <br/>
see to make.<br/>
<br/>
THEY, on the other hand, are still on the same side of the fence (but <br/>
are quickly making a brick wall out of that rail fence so that their <br/>
kids can&#39;t see us on the FUN side!), with no knowledge of the other <br/>
possibiilities. They are uninformed and misinformed. HOW can they have <br/>
an intelligent conversation on any of these issues? Well, they *can&#39;t*!<br/>
<br/>
No one chooses to unschool without questioning. That&#39;s the nature of <br/>
the beast. Parents who aren&#39;t going to question things---every <br/>
thing---are not going to unschool. It just won&#39;t happen. The radical <br/>
unschoolers I know are passionate about questioning and learning more. <br/>
They don&#39;t let things rest. They keep looking and asking and thinking <br/>
about things. They&#39;re voracious learners themselves, so they are <br/>
excellent models for their children.<br/>
<br/>
Those who choose to &quot;go with the flow&quot; and who accept whatever they are <br/>
told and who refrain from thinking too much will be modeling for their <br/>
children too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594209619">I just love when Kelli goes on a rant. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-The biggest thing that pisses me off is that they are coming at this<br/>
from ONE point of view. They know no other. They&#39;ve done NO research.<br/>
They&#39;ve never even questioned *why* they are doing what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
They simply *DO*. No questions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
RIGHT.<br/>
<br/>
Those who only know what they know are disadvantaged in a discussion  <br/>
with someone who knows all that AND another way.<br/>
People will talk to me about unschooling as if I&#39;m from another  <br/>
planet, instead of being a person who went to school and then taught  <br/>
in a public school.  ***HELLO!!!**** I know ALL those pro-school  <br/>
arguments.  No one has ever, ever come up with a pro-school argument  <br/>
I had never heard.<br/>
<br/>
I liked this list of questions, and I want to play with possible  <br/>
responses (which anyone here is free to use liberally, or reject for  <br/>
being abominal, either way):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Would you allow them to have cake and ice cream for breakfast?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
                Yes, but I wouldn&#39;t MAKE them eat cake and ice cream  <br/>
for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you allow them to play video games ALL DAY?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
                   &quot;.... and all night too.&quot;  (a Shakespearean-style  <br/>
answer)<br/>
     or<br/>
                   &quot;yes, but I wouldn&#39;t MAKE them play ever day, or  <br/>
all day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t they have to read 30 minutes each day?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
     Is that a law now?<br/>
     Do you read 30 minutes each day?<br/>
     Who makes you?<br/>
     I read 30 minutes each day, but if someone tried to make me, I  <br/>
might resist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You allow them to watch anything they want on tv? Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>
they will watch horror and porn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
     Do you watch horror and porn?<br/>
     I don&#39;t *make* them watch horror and porn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What about math? No Algebra???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
     Well I do have answers to this.  Most people who ask about  <br/>
algebra don&#39;t know what it is, outside of being a school math  <br/>
course.  That one&#39;s pretty easy, but here are some stories...  http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/timestables<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if you don&#39;t make them do chores, they&#39;ll treat you like a maid<br/>
and NEVER do ANYTHING!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       That hasn&#39;t been my experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They NEED their rest! If they can stay up as late as they want, when<br/>
will they sleep?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
        Marty has stayed up all night ONCE.  Kirby has, but only when  <br/>
he&#39;s slept all the following day.    They sleep lots.  Probably the  <br/>
same people who want to rag about bedtime enforcement would also  <br/>
complain if I didn&#39;t wake them up after eight hours, saying &quot;Eight  <br/>
hours is enough,&quot; and more is sloth or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No parental controls on the TV or computer? What about child<br/>
molesters?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE THIS ONE!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Kids whose parents make them go out and play are in way more danger  <br/>
than those who are sitting in a chair, in the house, at a computer.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of parents would create a home environment which would make  <br/>
secretly meeting a stranger seem desireable?  (Lots of them,  <br/>
unfortunately, but I&#39;m not one of them.)<br/>

<time> 7 Jun 2007, at  7:22pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639623147">I love quizzes.<br/>
<br/>
Would I allow my 11 year old home educated son to have cake and ice <br/>
cream for breakfast?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. He can have whatever he likes. Whatever he likes is not, as it <br/>
happens, cake and ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Do I allow him to play video games ALL DAY?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. And all night if he wants to. Which he sometimes does.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t he have to read 30 minutes each day?<br/>
<br/>
No. But I&#39;m sure he does read 30 minutes each day, at least. Just not <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
Do I allow him to watch anything he wants on tv? <br/>
<br/>
Yes. Even stuff I don&#39;t like. I always tell him why I don&#39;t like it. <br/>
I&#39;m free to do that. The same as I do with my wife, who also watches <br/>
anything she wants on TV. My wife and my son will usually tell me why <br/>
they do like the stuff I don&#39;t like. I&#39;ve learned a lot. Currently, <br/>
my son is building a case for The Simpsons. <br/>
<br/>
Am I worried he&#39;ll watch horror and porn?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m alert to the possibility, but &quot;worried&quot; is not how I would <br/>
describe it. My son knows what porn is. I was amazed when I <br/>
discovered that. He&#39;s never seen any but he knows what it is. It led <br/>
to a most enlightening conversation. My son has an appreciation of <br/>
the world at large I would have envied when I was his age.<br/>
<br/>
What about math? <br/>
<br/>
My son has an online interactive maths program he uses when he feels <br/>
like it. Usually he spends about an hour a week on that and fits it <br/>
into visits to gamespot.com (the main reason he uses the PC these <br/>
days).<br/>
<br/>
No Algebra???<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll get to it at some stage of his maths program. I rarely use <br/>
algebra in real life, so I don&#39;t see it as a major issue. I can <br/>
always run him through it at the time if necessary. I&#39;m more <br/>
interested in him knowing how long division works (without using a <br/>
calculator) - something I understand is no longer taught in many <br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But if you don&#39;t make them do chores, they&#39;ll treat you like a maid<br/>
and NEVER do ANYTHING!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s too busy to treat me like a maid. Besides which, my own solution <br/>
to the chores problem is to earn enough money to hire a maid to do <br/>
all that stuff anyway. More fun for everyone. I&#39;m a great believer in <br/>
everybody spending their valuable time on things that make the best <br/>
use of their talents and not wasting it on things a trained monkey <br/>
could do.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They NEED their rest! If they can stay up as late as they want, when<br/>
will they sleep?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son gets all the sleep he needs and wakes up when he wakes up, and <br/>
often that means he sleeps in long after everyone else is up and <br/>
about. It&#39;s one of the joys of our lifestyle that he&#39;s free to do <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No parental controls on the TV or computer?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
None whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What about child molesters?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about them?<br/>
<br/>
As I think I&#39;ve said before, it seems to me there are a lot of people <br/>
wishing and hoping that the unschooling lifestyle couldn&#39;t possibly <br/>
be better than their own conventional lifestyles, and they&#39;ll use all <br/>
sorts of myths and nonsense to try to make it so.<br/>

person to say that my son has gained an enormous amount of knowledge <br/>
about the real world from watching cartoons, but ... Anyway, I&#39;ll <br/>
pass that page on to him to look at - he&#39;ll find it very interesting <br/>
and I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll give him some good ideas. You never know, he might <br/>
convince me one day. :D<br/>
<br/>
I was interested to see in the Powers of Ten video where Springfield <br/>
was located geographically, but I couldn&#39;t figure out if it was <br/>
supposed to be Minnesota of Wisconsin. That led to me finding this <br/>
article:<br/>

Town decides the Simpsons don&#39;t live in Minnesota<br/>

when passing by. Then my son will usually say something like, &quot;See, <br/>
you DO think it&#39;s funny!&quot; No, I think some of the jokes in it are <br/>
funny. But, then, he doesn&#39;t see why I think Seinfeld is funny.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really pleased that my son feels comfortable and confident about <br/>
defending his right to like what he likes anyway. I&#39;m all for that. <br/>
