a report on the elementary school in Llanharan, in Wales, where I&#39;m  <br/>
visiting Joy in a week.  I thought I would research a bit about where  <br/>
I&#39;m going to be, and maybe figure out how to pronounce the town&#39;s  <br/>
name, but i might just ask her on Saturday at the conference.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be simple to state goals of unschooling in this kind  <br/>
of language:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The aims of the school have been agreed by the Governing Body and can  <br/>
be summarised as:<br/>
<br/>
(ii) to offer a broad curriculum that will equip pupils for the world  <br/>
of work and leisure<br/>
and to become active members of society;<br/>
<br/>
(iii) to provide the pupils with a challenging but supportive  <br/>
environment and to encourage<br/>
them to reach their full potential;<br/>
<br/>
(iv) to foster close relationships between the school, homes and the  <br/>
local community.<br/>
<br/>
The school was last inspected in April 1997.  Since then a new  <br/>
headteacher has been<br/>
appointed and has identified its priorities as raising the standards  <br/>
of pupils achievement,<br/>
particularly in literacy and numeracy of all pupils, and to improve  <br/>
nursery provision.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Seriously, people get paid to write phrases such as&quot; &quot;these children  <br/>
are making good progress towards<br/>
achieving the Desirable Outcomes for Children�s Learning. &quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do some freelance writing from time to time, and a lot of the work I  <br/>
do is for a friend who worked for the state dept. of education for a  <br/>
long time, and is now a consultant in the area of school improvement.  <br/>
So, in fact, from time to time _I_ get paid--and very well, I might  <br/>
add--to write sentences like that. I enjoy the irony.<br/>
