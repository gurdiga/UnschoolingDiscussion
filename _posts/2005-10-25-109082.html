It is  really neat to hear someone bragging about their kid because <br/>
they are kind  to others<br/>
<br/>

Another brag. We were at an away  high school football game Friday  night, <br/>
sitting in front of friends.  Their 7 year old son and  his 7 yo friend, who <br/>
came with our friends, needed to go to the  restroom.  Mom and Dad thought it <br/>
necessary that they be accompanied to the  restroom, but weren&#39;t willing to do it <br/>
right then, due to the game being at a  critical point.  (Really into sports, <br/>
these two.)  They looked around  for their older son, who wasn&#39;t around, but <br/>
Will was sitting there near  me.<br/>
 <br/>
These parents were clearly not going to get up and take the boys to the  <br/>
restroom.  I could have made a point and offer to take them myself, but I  knew <br/>
they would have refused my help and still made the boys wait.  So I  asked Will <br/>
if he would walk the boys to the restroom and he said, &quot;Sure!&quot; and  hopped <br/>
right up.  <br/>
 <br/>
Earlier in the game the mom had asked me if I was teaching Will long  <br/>
division (she&#39;s a teacher).  I just said, &quot;naahh.&quot;  For Will&#39;s benefit  (he was there <br/>
beside me and listening), I said something like &quot;it&#39;s just a way  to write <br/>
down repeated subtraction...&quot; and I didn&#39;t get to finish because she  went on <br/>
about her older son not &quot;getting it&quot;, and then something happened that  drew our <br/>
attention to the game.<br/>
 <br/>
She was grateful to Will for walking the boys to the restroom and thanked  <br/>
him a lot, but I know she&#39;s tallying up the score that Will is not learning long <br/>
 division, being older than her son who IS &quot;learning&quot; it in school, rather <br/>
than  seeing how kind and willing to help Will is.  He&#39;s willing to help  <br/>
without even being cajoled or threatened or given the threatening stare by his  dad <br/>
like their son would have to be.  No points for Will for that,  though.  <br/>
 <br/>
Luckily, Will couldn&#39;t care less.  Sorry for her kids though.<br/>
