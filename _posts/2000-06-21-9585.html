<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657389529">Hi Lynda!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been out-of-town and am only JUST geting my old email...You&#39;ve<br/>
probably had a ton of responses already but here I go anyway...<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve done homemade dills:  Just use some decent water (spring water<br/>
sometimes works better if your stuff out of the tap isn&#39;t great), and<br/>
make a brine with coarse salt (not iodized table salt).  You&#39;ll also<br/>
need whole cloves of garlic and a big old head of dill (not baby dill,<br/>
but get it before it&#39;s totally seed). Pack your very clean mason jars<br/>
with scrubbed small cukes, put in your garlic (there&#39;s no such thing as<br/>
too much), add the dill and top up with the brine.(Water and salt<br/>
brought to a boil, then cooled slightly.  You might have to go by taste<br/>
here; the water should taste like salty sea water)  Seal with rubber<br/>
seals and leave to rest at least a couple of weeks.  A couple months is<br/>
usually better.<br/>

&gt; Strawberries need to be sort of sliced depending on how plump they are.  If<br/>
&gt; you slice them too thin they turn into hard little waffers.  We buy<br/>
&gt; seedless watermelons and a really delicious seedless yellow watermelon.<br/>
&gt; You slice it about an 1/8th to a 1/4 inch thick.  We have two dehydraters,<br/>
&gt; one of those round things and a combo convection oven/dehydrator.  Just lay<br/>
&gt; them on the trays and check them after a few hours and flip them over once.<br/>
&gt;  We also do bananas but you need to dip them in lemon juice so they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; turn brown (commercial banana chips are treated with sulfur and lord knows<br/>
&gt; what else).  The big kidlet&#39;s favorite (hubby &lt;g&gt;) is pears and we also do<br/>
&gt; apples.  We are going to try some other types of fruit this year and also<br/>
&gt; fruit leathers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do onions and peppers and put them in old mayo and pickle jars and then<br/>
&gt; just grab a handful to toss in soups and stews during the off season.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, in a sneaky way to get hubby more involved, I bought &quot;him&quot; a smoker<br/>
&gt; for Christmas.  We are going to smoke salmon (his BIG favorite) when they<br/>
&gt; are running this year.  I also bought &quot;him&quot; a copy of Back to Basics which<br/>
&gt; has home smoking recipes in it for bacon and ham, etc.  &lt;&lt;&lt;BEWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are going to try making our own pickles this year.  Has/does anyone<br/>
&gt; done/do that?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; dehydrate things like strawberries and watermelon.  The kidlets<br/>
&gt; &gt;  would rather have these than candy!<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please share how you do this....This is a great idea.<br/>
