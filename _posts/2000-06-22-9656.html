&gt; Hi All:
&gt;
&gt; Need some input... I went to my library this morning and talked to the Branch
&gt; Manager who was wonderful..&nbsp; I told her there were no books on unschooling
&gt; and 7 on homeschooling and she asked me if I could suggest some. She said
&gt; they had plenty of money in their budget for those books.&nbsp; I quickly whipped
&gt; out my copy of The Unschooling Handbook and she ordered it from Amazon.com as
&gt; we were talking.&nbsp; She asked me if there were anymore I could recommend.&nbsp; I
&gt; could only think of the Colfax&#39;s book and didn&#39;t know if that was unschooling
&gt; or homeschooling.&nbsp; Anyway she ordered that.
&gt;
&gt; I told her about the unschooling loop and she asked me to ask you for
&gt; recommendations of unschooling books.&nbsp; She is more than willing to buy
&gt; several more books if I can give her the names and authors...</pre>
