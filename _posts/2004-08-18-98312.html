<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850972462">Legos!!  My little guy will play with these for hours.  If he sees a toy on tv that he doesn&#39;t have or doesn&#39;t want to spend his own money on, he will make it out of legos.  The best toy hands down for him.  Also, he has a big box of junk (his words) and he spends hours playing with stuff he&#39;s taken out of the garbage can. His favorite is styrofoam.  <br/>
