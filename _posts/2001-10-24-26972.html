<div id="ygrps-yiv-217861541">Bridget, It really needs to go to the NY tragedy, that is where I said it <br/>
would go and I feel it would wrong to send it anywhere else, (thats why the <br/>
wonderful people gave). Im still looking and researching though. I hate the <br/>
thought of it going to pay for advertising/etc. Hard to see a way around it <br/>
at this point. Shame really, they need an angel tree with the families <br/>
listed so it could go directly to a needy family or at least supplies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054656427">Well, this is probably not going to be a popular opinion, but I think enough<br/>
is enough!  WTC was a great tragedy but exactly how many BILLIONS are they<br/>
going to collect?  Helping is one thing but there are people out there that<br/>
think they should be supported for the rest of their lives!<br/>
<br/>
And, exactly who is the money going to?  All I hear is fire fighters and<br/>
WTC.  What about the folks in the Pentagon and on the flight that went down<br/>
before it could do any damage?  Now, the folks on that flight to me are REAL<br/>
heros!<br/>
<br/>
Or, as far as that goes, what about the folks from &#39;93 or Oklahoma City or<br/>
the USS Cole or the embassies.  Did their families get anything?<br/>
<br/>
I think the public has become obsessed with collecting money and I think the<br/>
media is having hayday with it.  Politics as usual!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633167617">We sent off 17 boxes of clothes.  This year we &quot;adopted&quot; 3 elders who we<br/>
made afghans for and are just finishing up scarves and hats and will buy<br/>
slippers and gloves for.  And we are also collecting warm clothing and<br/>
blankets.<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets love doing it and it makes the mommy heart feel good that they<br/>
think of giving before they think of getting.  Youngest routinely clears out<br/>
her toys and puts them in piles for donating.  It was &quot;cute&quot; to hear her the<br/>
last time in her room talking to herself about how she needed to be a little<br/>
gentler when she played so that when she no longer wanted to play with<br/>
something it would be good enough to give to someone else &quot;to love it all<br/>
over again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As to the folks expecting to live off this the rest of their lives, O&#39;Reilly<br/>
has had several on his show.  The owner of a company one gal&#39;s husband<br/>
worked for said that he was going to give each family $100,000 over 5 years<br/>
plus paid medical benefits for 10 years.  She commented that she hadn&#39;t seen<br/>
it yet, doesn&#39;t believe him AND &quot;what am I suppose to do after that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All of them except one that he has had on his show have complained because<br/>
they had to fill out forms and I know the Red X can be a pain about<br/>
paperwork and I sympathise HOWEVER, if you want the money then you play by<br/>
their rules.<br/>
<br/>
One complained that she had to go down to an office to fill in paperwork, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t have time, I have other things to do with my time.&quot;  Then went on to<br/>
complain that she hadn&#39;t gotten any money.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, it just all seemed so greedy and self-serving and little or<br/>
nothing was said about the folks that they lost.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see those scholarships that are suppose to be set up go to<br/>
children of folks lost in any of the horrific tragedies--Oklahoma City, &#39;93,<br/>
Cole, etc.<br/>

&gt; You have a very good point, Lynda.  A lot of people here and in other<br/>
&gt; countries need help.  How did the blanket project you and your children<br/>
&gt; did last winter go?  I thought of that as I hear about quilt projects<br/>
&gt; for children who lost parents on Sept. 11.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Helping is one thing but there are people out there that<br/>
&gt; &gt; think they should be supported for the rest of their lives!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there really?  I haven&#39;t been following the news media stories<br/>
&gt; that much so I haven&#39;t heard any reports.  (said in a disbelieving<br/>
&gt; tone - not in an accusing-Lynda-of-making-that-up tone)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d like to see the charities set up for *all* victims of terrorism<br/>
&gt; and that includes the families of the military personnel who lose<br/>
&gt; their lives in this war.<br/>
