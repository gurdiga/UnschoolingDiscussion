<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757443634">Noelle was very curious about homeschooling/unschooling in a &quot;how <br/>
will your <br/>
children survive this very uncool thing?&quot; kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
Some of of her comments and questions:<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  If you homeschool them in high school and they are <br/>
teenagers when will they go to bed and when will they get up?<br/>
<br/>
Me:  They will go to bed when they are tired and get up when they <br/>
are rested.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle: Oh!<br/>
<br/>
====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Noelle was incredibly frustrated that my 6 year old daughter Sarah <br/>
would not buckle herself in to her booster seat in the car.  <br/>
<br/>
Noelle sat on Sarah&#39;s side of the car and I asked Noelle if she <br/>
would take on the job of buckling Sarah in when we went somewhere.  <br/>
Noelle constantly forgot and, rather than get out and buckle the <br/>
seat belt, Noelle would turn around and try to talk Sarah in to <br/>
doing it herself.  Each time this happened I said, &quot;She will do it <br/>
when she is ready&quot; and I would lean back and buckle it myself.<br/>
<br/>
Once, when this happened Noelle snapped, &quot;What if she is never <br/>
ready?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;I hardly think she will go to college in a booster seat.  <br/>
Someday she will be ready.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Noelle also asked what Sarah and Olivia would do if they wanted to <br/>
go to college.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t really understand what she wanted to know so I told her <br/>
they would go if they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle said, &quot;No, I mean how will they know how to take a class if <br/>
they&#39;ve never been in class before?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Just because they haven&#39;t been in class doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>
don&#39;t know how to learn.  They do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Noelle said, &quot;Oh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think she might have been wondering how they would know to raise <br/>
their hands, act in class, etc.<br/>
<br/>
=====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Earlier in our visit Noelle had told me that children don&#39;t need <br/>
their parents.  Just a few days later she told me this:<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  How do you do school?<br/>
<br/>
Me:  We don&#39;t really do school, we just get involved in whatever <br/>
Sarah and Olivia are interested in and we go out a lot and do things.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  What if they don&#39;t know what they are interested in?<br/>
<br/>
Me:  But they do.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  Little kids don&#39;t know what they want--they need guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Me:  I disagree.  In my experience children are born knowing without <br/>
a doubt what they want and then they lose that knowing when school <br/>
and their parents force it out of them.<br/>
<br/>
Noelle:  Well, I don&#39;t know what I want.<br/>
<br/>
(Ahh, I thought, this is what it&#39;s really about and how sad that <br/>
Noelle has already lost that at 14.  Then I started wondering if it <br/>
was possible for her to find that knowledge again--is it too late?  <br/>
I kept offering &quot;The Teen Liberation Handbook&quot; (Grace Llewellyn) but <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t take it or even listen to what it was about.)  Maybe <br/>
she got a little bit of her self back by argueing with me for 10 <br/>
days! <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember arguing with someone about homeschooling when I was a<br/>
teenager.  The guy I argued with went to public school and was<br/>
probably a senior.  I was probably a sophomore.  Some guy had come to<br/>
speak at his church to promote homeschooling--very conservative Bob<br/>
Jones University school at home homeschooling.  His parents thought it<br/>
sounded good, and wished they had done it with their kids, and he<br/>
agreed.  My parents, who were both teachers, heard about this and<br/>
thought it was ridiculous.  My mom had just taken me and some friends<br/>
to a church camp retreat, where a homeschooled teen girl and her mom<br/>
had attended, and the girl was very shy and didn&#39;t speak to anyone,<br/>
and her mom always answered for her.  My mom blasted homeschooling big<br/>
time after that, and I had it in my mind for a long time that<br/>
homeschooling was insane.  I knew nothing about unschooling, but had<br/>
it in my mind that there was something about school that kids NEED and<br/>
to keep them away from it was nuts.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that what I thought kids needed was time away from their<br/>
parents and exposure to a bigger world than what they had at home.  My<br/>
parents were VERY strict, and my mom and I often didn&#39;t get along well<br/>
 when I was a teenager, and the thought of her homeschooling me<br/>
brought visions of yelling and crying and worse as she made me sit<br/>
bored out of my mind all day at the kitchen table as she taught me.  <br/>
<br/>
A title like The Teenage Liberation Handbook would have appealed to me<br/>
BIG TIME when I was a teenager.  I remember one summer I spent working<br/>
as kitchen staff at my church&#39;s kids&#39; camp, and I said to my dad once<br/>
that fall that it was REALLY hard for me to be living at home again<br/>
after having so much freedom as a staff member at camp.  He accepted<br/>
that I felt that way and even admitted that he understood, but he<br/>
didn&#39;t drop any of the rules.  I think he felt it was his<br/>
responsibility to be strict, that that&#39;s what made him a good parent. <br/>
<br/>
Yet I wonder, if I had met a radically unschooled teenager when I was<br/>
a teenager, if I would have thought it was somehow wrong or weird.  I<br/>
had it in my mind that even though the strictness of my parents and<br/>
the ridiculousness of school was unpleasant, it was somehow necessary.<br/>
I thought there was something wrong with *me* that I didn&#39;t like it,<br/>
and that I just had to work harder to be what everyone expected me to<br/>
be.  <br/>
<br/>
I bet I would have argued with you back then too.  But look at me now. ;) <br/>

<br/>
My own get that, with unschooling and the freedom and encouragement they get <br/>
from   us to listen to other adults when they get the chance, to go out and <br/>
hang out with people of all ages who are doing what they&#39;re doing.   <br/>
<br/>
Some kids (in or out of school) are GREATLY discouraged by their parents from <br/>
talking to or trusting ANYone outside the family, from being honest with <br/>
anyone (outside the family they mean, but that seems to instantly become &quot;nor <br/>
honest INside the family&quot;) and once communications and trust are cut off, the <br/>
person is not really a part of any greater group of people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I agree.  What I was trying to express was that when I was a<br/>
teenager, the only people I knew who were homeschooling were people<br/>
whose kids did not have exposure to a very big world at all, and I<br/>
imagined that if I had been homeschooled by my already strict parents,<br/>
my world wouldn&#39;t have been very big at all.  I imagined (and I&#39;m sure<br/>
I was right, because they wouldn&#39;t have been unschoolers) that the<br/>
result would be even more tension between me and my parents. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t imagine, back then, that a kid not going to school and<br/>
therefore spending more time with her parents and in her home and<br/>
going to places that her parents approved of her going would be very<br/>
much fun. And I also thought, back then, that parents who let their<br/>
kids have the kind of freedom that unschooled kids have were the kind<br/>
of parents who didn&#39;t care much about their kids and didn&#39;t really<br/>
care about being good parents.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe Noelle is thinking somewhat along those lines.  <br/>

homeschooled throughout my growing-up years.  It just<br/>
wasn&#39;t done.  My first experience was with a woman who<br/>
owns a car repair shop.  I was well into my 20s and it<br/>
didn&#39;t even make a blip on my radar as something that<br/>
was even happening.  I mean, I could see her son there<br/>
in the shop every time I went (we had crummy cars - I<br/>
was an excellent customer!) but it didn&#39;t even sink in<br/>
that there was something else going on.  Not only was<br/>
she homeschooling, she was unschooling.  And I only<br/>
figured this out in May (a mere 20 years later)!<br/>

of the family) anything about those of us within our immediate family <br/>
(my mom, brother and myself). I am now not a very trusting person, but I <br/>
thought it stemmed from years of getting hurt by others. Now I wonder if <br/>
there wasn&#39;t mistrust as a child, that I just don&#39;t recall. There had to <br/>
be. That is sad. It is probably something I have passed onto my kids <br/>
without knowing. I have told my daughter not to tell her friends certain <br/>
things, like the fact that my four year-old son still uses a bottle <br/>
twice a day or other things that I feel comfortable with but not with <br/>
other people knowing. I live in an apt. complex where threatening to <br/>
call DSS on a family is the norm. Way too many nosy, gossipy, insecure <br/>
woman in here, whom have raised aggressive, bullying, obnoxious, <br/>
foul-mouth children. I also don&#39;t need the added aggravation of hearing <br/>
anyone&#39;s judgments.<br/>
<br/>
But...(getting off track there), I don&#39;t want to raise my children that <br/>
way. It amazes me sometimes how you go through life doing something and <br/>
realize later on that that something was actually a negative thing. <br/>
Thank you Sandra for point ing this out. :)<br/>

unschoolers, parents or children, and just recently even heard of the <br/>
term, so if my question sounds ridiculous please forgive. :)<br/>
I have read about all the wonderful ways that children are respected, by <br/>
their unschooling families, and the freedoms they are given to know what <br/>
is in their interests, etc. I was wondering what type, if any, limits <br/>
are there ---do y&#39;all set? What do you not approve of? Perhaps there is <br/>
nothing and I am still not seeing everything in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I have known families where the parents were strict, super strict, <br/>
neglectful, lenient and whom overcompensate. I don&#39;t believe, from what <br/>
I have read, that unschoolers fall into any of these categories and I <br/>
realize that those labels are not truly fair to families. When I first <br/>
heard of unschooling I tried to trace my memories to find an incidence <br/>
or person that I once knew who were unschoolers and the closest I could <br/>
come to were the families where the mother is calmly telling her child <br/>
why he/she shouldn&#39;t hit mommy ---but that is not what unschooling is <br/>
about, correct?  And I&#39;m not talking about unschooling in an academic <br/>
way but within the family as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I made sense.<br/>

the question backwards. A better question is &quot;What can I do with my<br/>
kids that I haven&#39;t been doing? What can I say yes to that I used to<br/>
say no to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 When I first <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, I don&#39;t think so. :)<br/>
<br/>
We just returned from Italy for 18 days. We stayed in tiny apartments<br/>
and were together 24/7. My oldest is 18 and my youngest is 8. This is<br/>
what I wrote upon our return. To me, this is what unschooling is all<br/>
about:<br/>
<br/>
Italy is a memory, but a bright, life-sized one that I&#39;ll hold in my<br/>
heart until I&#39;m gone. And while Italy itself is a gorgeous country<br/>
filled with color, music, light and flavor, it was the joy of being a<br/>
family that will stay with me even longer.<br/>
<br/>
I am in love.<br/>
<br/>
In love with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
In love with my husband.<br/>
<br/>
The two and a half weeks were spent all together with very few times<br/>
where we split up. We played games, shared books, rode public<br/>
transport all smooshed into too tiny spaces, hiked, made jokes, rode<br/>
bikes in ancient walls, looked at world class art, were bored by too<br/>
many churches from the 10th century, learned Italian catch phrases,<br/>
were horrified by Roman history, ate gelatto like there was only one<br/>
scoop left, compared American pizza to Italian and voted for American,<br/>
we snuggled and hugged, took photographs, danced in endless<br/>
combinations of relatives, walked and talked, and played chess and cards.<br/>
<br/>
The vacation was one long family love fest.<br/>
<br/>
I am humbled. I wanted to bring my children to the world. Instead, the<br/>
world brought them closer to me. Jon and I were in awe of how well<br/>
they get along, how much fun we all can have together. It is the<br/>
unexpected end result and it is why I&#39;m in tears at this early<br/>
jet-lagged hour.<br/>
<br/>
 And I&#39;m not talking about unschooling in an academic <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; way but within the family as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve got it.<br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling is the joy of being a family engaged in life, LIFE!<br/>
It is saying yes to opportunities and sharing them with each other. It<br/>
is reveling in our differences and similarities. It is being a family<br/>
that loves to be together but also supports separateness too.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think unschooling was about education.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know it&#39;s about a family life that is filled with love, peace<br/>
and joy. Really. I know how corny that sounds, but it turns out to be<br/>
true.<br/>

10th century churches in our lives...<br/>
<br/>
But I remember the feeling of being &quot;museum sick&quot; and tired of touristing, <br/>
both from England and from Washington D.C., where after a while the french fries <br/>
at the cafeteria were MUCH more interesting to me than yet another hall of <br/>
rare coins or gold nuggets or even Howdy Doody himself.   And my memories of <br/>
English castles got mixed up in my head.   Better to study ONE and have it <br/>
clearly imprinted, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
That was a beautiful description of your feelings about your family, Julie.<br/>

too) let people know where they&#39;re going and when they&#39;ll be back.   We call if <br/>
plans change.   <br/>
<br/>
If anyone finishes off the milk, or it&#39;s getting low, they need to get <br/>
another gallon from the fridge in back.    If the trash is full, someone will take <br/>
that bag down and replace the bag.   If the dog&#39;s dish is empty, someone will <br/>
fill it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s considered tacky not to put the cordless phones back on their bases and <br/>
to turn most of the lights off at night.<br/>
<br/>
We try to be quiet if someone&#39;s asleep, but if noon has passed and there are <br/>
no extenuating circumstances, noise is okay.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever finishes off any food item that we stock regularly should put it on <br/>
the list.   <br/>
<br/>
If any of those things are not done, someone (any of us) might snark at <br/>
someone (whoever could&#39;ve done better), or might even more likely NOT.     <br/>

come to were the families where the mother is calmly telling her child<br/>

One can only be &quot;lenient&quot; in the presence of rules.<br/>
One can only OVERcompensate when the observer thinks it was more than <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I guess that did tell a lot about what I believe, or have learned <br/>
to believe and haven&#39;t truly figured out what *I* believe yet. I have <br/>
had one close and one semi-close friendship with a parent who, in my <br/>
eyes, overcompensates, and *I*, and my daughter, have had a hard time <br/>
&quot;dealing&quot; with the child. What I call overcompensating is a parent who <br/>
can not go to a store for a gallon of milk without also purchasing a toy <br/>
for the child, a parent who will spend $300 on one child for Christmas <br/>
and have to borrow money to pay their electricity.  It was actually the <br/>
parent that I knew quite well with whom I thought of the word <br/>
&quot;overcompensating&quot; because she herself stated that she wondered if she <br/>
did all she did because her own mother did very little. I am trying to <br/>
not be judgmental so I realize labels aren&#39;t &quot;correct&quot;. I grew up in an <br/>
overly critical household filled with many rules, many subliminal rules, <br/>
so it is hard to break out of this but I am working on it. :)<br/>
Perhaps the children&#39;s inability to share was not due to the parents <br/>
need to buy every toy under the sun (that&#39;s only a slight exaggeration), <br/>
to not allow the child&#39;s father to eat the snacks that were purchased <br/>
just for the child (because the child would get mad)... Oh the list goes <br/>
on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I do not mean to offend anyone and hopefully I have not. If I have, I <br/>
apologize.<br/>
<br/>
How do you deal with others? Strangers? For instance, if your child <br/>
becomes friends with someone you don&#39;t know and wants to go out with <br/>
this person? Or, with the conversation about dating ---what if the boy <br/>
is someone *you* don&#39;t know? Would you ask your daughter to have him <br/>
visit to get to know him better? (Ok, that sounds like a stupid question <br/>
but this is very new to me.) When I first read the dating thread my <br/>
first thought was, &quot;I could never allow my 12, 13, 14 year-old daughter <br/>
to go out on a date.&quot; Then as I read further I realized that the <br/>
circumstances were different then what were going through my mind, and <br/>
then I realized I was thinking like my mother. She was very strict and I <br/>
wasn&#39;t allowed to go anywhere usually. A friend&#39;s house after school, <br/>
when I was older ---junior high on up---as long as I was home by supper <br/>
time (5:00). My brother was allowed to go back out after dinner and I <br/>
was not. I was 5 years older than him. So at 15 I was sitting in the <br/>
house and he,a t age 10, was running around with friends. Her reasons <br/>
were because I was a girl and I could get pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I took that to mean that she didn&#39;t trust *me*, although she <br/>
said it was the rest of the world she didn&#39;t trust. At 18, I finally <br/>
broke free of her control and the summer after graduation I was sexually <br/>
assaulted by my boyfriend&#39;s friend. So what did that tell me? That she <br/>
was right? That the world wasn&#39;t to be trusted? I don&#39;t want to send <br/>
those &quot;rules&quot; to Madison, for her to become jaded.<br/>
I thank everyone for answering my newbie questions. I really do <br/>
appreciate all the insight and experience you can offer. I so want this <br/>
life for my family.<br/>
Jenn :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was little I usually only had one pair of shoes, and they were often <br/>
uncomfortable, unfashionable, and wearing out.    Because of that I offer to <br/>
buy my kids shoes lots, and I feel happy when they have four or six pairs of <br/>
useable shoes, and they have choices of what to wear.   If their shoes get <br/>
uncomfortable, if they&#39;re good I encourage them to give them to the thrift store; if <br/>
they&#39;re holey, I say &quot;throw them away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;compensation&quot; is inside of me.   I am giving them what I didn&#39;t have.   <br/>
I don&#39;t buy $60 pairs of shoes.   They&#39;re usually from PayLess or WalMart, <br/>
though I will offer to get nicer shoes and the kids usually decline because their <br/>
feet are growing and they&#39;re budget conscious kids, and not needy, grasping <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Grasping and neediness come from lack and need.   Neediness is real.   When <br/>
someone is needy or doesn&#39;t want to share, there is something that child is <br/>
lacking to feel safe and secure.<br/>
<br/>
I have very current answers to some of your questions.   Holly&#39;s off camping <br/>
in the mountains where it&#39;s expected to rain.   She&#39;s with her dad a few <br/>
hundred medievalists.   Friday   morning she walked to the grocery store in the new <br/>
shoes she had gotten to take to the event.   She had sandals for daytime <br/>
(it&#39;s a fern meadow, the main campground), and wanted something waterproof for <br/>
nighttime.   She got garden clogs with backs, basically rainboots.   So she wore <br/>
them to   walk to the store, and when she got back she said she didn&#39;t think <br/>
socks would fit in them and be comfortable, and I offered to take her to get <br/>
something else.   <br/>
<br/>
We went to PayLess and she got a pair of suede boots lined with plush.   They <br/>
won&#39;t stay dry in serious rain, but they&#39;ll be warm if she stays in a tent or <br/>
under a rainfly and out of water.   And she got a $5 pair of cloth Mary Janes <br/>
because for Kirby&#39;s birthday there&#39;s a movie-character theme and she&#39;s going <br/>
as Addie from Paper Moon.   She already got used overalls for $4.   <br/>
<br/>
My mom wouldn&#39;t have done ANY of that for me.   Holly knows that, but I don&#39;t <br/>
drone on about it.   I make the offer, she accepts or not.    She makes good <br/>
use of the clothes she has and wears them in artsy rearrangements and really <br/>
likes having clothes and shoes.     I like her having clothes and shoes.   The <br/>
compensation is for my own soul and spirit.<br/>

<br/>
This happened yesterday for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is 16 and drives.   He said he was going to go thrift-store shopping <br/>
with... and he named a name I had never heard.   A teenaged girl he met a week <br/>
ago through friends, and hung around with (in a group) for a few hours the day <br/>
after they met.    He asked her to go shopping with him to get costume parts.  <br/>
 He&#39;s wanting to be Dr. Strangelove.   I asked him a couple of questions <br/>
about her, but y&#39;know, they were going to thriftstores, not a weekend ski trip.<br/>
<br/>
If he went to school he would have access to hundreds of people I had never <br/>
met.   It&#39;s not that big a deal.   He meets people through hobbies or friends.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Or, with the conversation about dating ---what if the boy<br/>
is someone *you* don&#39;t know? Would you ask your daughter to have him<br/>
visit to get to know him better?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I used to think I would, but Holly (13) is SO used to making her own decisi<br/>
ons for real reasons, and carefully and for GOOD reasons, that if Holly trusted <br/>
the guy that would mean something.   And I can&#39;t really imagine that she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get a second opinion if she was undecided about him, or stay in groups <br/>
until she knew him better.<br/>
<br/>
-=- At 18, I finally<br/>
broke free of her control and the summer after graduation I was sexually<br/>
assaulted by my boyfriend&#39;s friend. So what did that tell me? That she<br/>
was right? That the world wasn&#39;t to be trusted?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you needed more practice at a younger age, and real reasons, not vague <br/>
&quot;you could get pregnant&quot; reasons.    Real advice in the moment, like what to <br/>
do or say if you felt uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Holly left the country for a month recently.   She was with a family we&#39;ve <br/>
known since she was little, but she wasn&#39;t with them at every moment, and one <br/>
night she went back to HesFes, the big homeschooling campout, while the rest <br/>
stayed at the cottage a couple of blocks away, and she was out at night in the <br/>
dark with boys swinging on a rope swing.    It didn&#39;t make me nervous.   She&#39;s <br/>
not sneaky, she&#39;s talkative, she has a strong personality, she&#39;s not desperate <br/>
for attention, she&#39;s not needy because we give her lots of attention, <br/>
information, opportunities, and choices.<br/>
<br/>
There are two things I&#39;ve written that are directly about what you&#39;re <br/>
wondering, and both are about the positive effects of respecting children:<br/>

This raises a, perhaps ignorant, question. I have never met any<br/>
unschoolers, parents or children, and just recently even heard of the<br/>
term, so if my question sounds ridiculous please forgive. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
The conference would be a big help in actually SEEING what we&#39;re <br/>
talking about---if you can make it.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have read about all the wonderful ways that children are respected, <br/>
by<br/>
their unschooling families, and the freedoms they are given to know <br/>
what<br/>
is in their interests, etc. I was wondering what type, if any, limits<br/>
are there ---do y&#39;all set? What do you not approve of? Perhaps there is<br/>
nothing and I am still not seeing everything in the same way.<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any limits.....I try to let them know they are are <br/>
limitless! &lt;g&gt; That they can achieve *any*thing!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t approve of abuse or neglect or unkindness. But those are things <br/>
I never, if ever, see in my children.<br/>
<br/>
I think empathy and honesty are pretty important.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way this is worded is interesting.    &quot;Perhaps there is nothing&quot; meaning <br/>
limits?<br/>
Or meaning perhaps there is nothing an unschooler would not approve of?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has preferences and concerns and worries and when one lives with a <br/>
roommate one finds out pretty quickly which are the really crucial things for <br/>
that person (maybe taking the trash out, maybe all the doors and windows being <br/>
locked, maybe making sure the refrigerator is clean, maybe not feeding the dog <br/>
in any human plates).    <br/>
<br/>
The difference between our relationships with our children (now teens) and <br/>
most of our friends&#39; is that we deal honestly with our children as we would <br/>
other adults.   We don&#39;t say no arbitrarily.    We don&#39;t tell them to leave us <br/>
alone because we&#39;re adults and we&#39;re busy.    I notice it most on Tuesday nights <br/>
when others come to sing with us.   Keith and I have four to six other adults <br/>
most childless, one with two younger children quite controlled) over to sing, <br/>
and the kids will come in to show us something or ask something, and it&#39;s a <br/>
snapsot of the relationship.     Two weeks ago Marty came and asked if he could <br/>
go to Edgewood, and we discussed which car and whether he needed gas, and I <br/>
chucked him my charge card.    I suggested maybe he was actually meaning Stanley <br/>
(a town further away that Edgewood, both over half an hour away over the <br/>
mountains).   He allowed that yeah, he might end up in Stanley.    He ended up <br/>
picking one person up in Edgewood to visit in Stanley with him,   and they all <br/>
ended up in Glorieta (NOT near) at a fourth friend&#39;s house.    <br/>
<br/>
Last night Marty and Kirby got back rustling bags from thrift stores and I <br/>
called down &quot;What&#39;d you get?&quot; (between songs) and Marty came and showed us a <br/>
couple of things he got for Kirby&#39;s birthday party costume.   He offered to pay <br/>
for Kirby&#39;s costume, as his birthday gift.   Kirby&#39;s going as Casey Jones, from <br/>
the first Ninja Turtle movie.   He had spent $40 on costume parts (including <br/>
bike gloves that Marty will keep for skateboarding later).    <br/>
<br/>
The theme is movie characters.   Holly&#39;s going as Addie from Paper Moon; <br/>
Marty as Dr. Strangelove; Kirby as Casey Jones with all his sports equipment as <br/>
weapons against bad guys.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the dire predictions of those who think we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re <br/>
doing, the kids are good and generous, direct and interesting.<br/>
