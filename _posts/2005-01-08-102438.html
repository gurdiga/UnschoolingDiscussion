&gt; I am  very interested to hear about children who came to unschooling   <br/>
&gt; late.<br/>
&gt; My son is 12 now and we have been unschooling for 11  months.  I  am <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; starting to feel the sands of time slip  through my fingers!  I  can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; believe that<br/>
&gt; he will have a  learners permit to drive in 2 1/2 years!   How long <br/>
&gt; did it<br/>
&gt; take  your son to heal Kelly?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He left school at the end of sixth grade. He was 12.5. That summer he <br/>
&gt; went<br/>
&gt; to Australia with People to People for three weeks. We spent the rest <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; summer just hanging out. I read the .com boards and learned as much as <br/>
&gt; I  could<br/>
&gt; about unschooling. I *understood* it, but I had a hard time putting it <br/>
&gt;  into<br/>
&gt; practice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When loading the car for a trip, I&#39;d point out that that was geometry! <br/>
&gt;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d nag him that he hadn&#39;t read anything in a while. I would read a  <br/>
&gt; short<br/>
&gt; story to him and ask him to draw a picture of it or of how it made him <br/>
&gt;  feel.<br/>
&gt; After a trip, I&#39;d suggest that he write me a paper about it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah----I know. It took a while to make it work! &lt;bwg&gt; I<br/>
&gt; probably could have knocked six-eight months off his deschooling if <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d quit  nagging<br/>
&gt; and just TRUSTED him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He spent 18 months doing NOTHING but sleeping, watching TV, talking on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; phone, and eating.  Seriously. It was painful to watch. BUT he needed <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; time to heal. It was VERY important!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Slowly, he started to do more. He started with IMing his friends. He&#39;d <br/>
&gt;  hated<br/>
&gt; the computer in school, preferring to write assignments by hand. But  <br/>
&gt; he got<br/>
&gt; *really* fast on the computer and knew more about its capabilities <br/>
&gt; than  my<br/>
&gt; husband or me in just a few short months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have another son, eight years younger. We&#39;d go somewhere almost every<br/>
&gt; day----the park, the zoo, the beach, the library, a <br/>
&gt; restaurant----*somewhere*.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d ask each day whether Cameron would like to join us: his answer was <br/>
&gt; always,<br/>
&gt; &quot;No.&quot; Then.....one day, I asked and he said, &quot;Yes!&quot; It was all I could <br/>
&gt; do not<br/>
&gt; to  jump up and do the happy dance----but I did one inside!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then he started to join us more and more----and we started to do <br/>
&gt; things HE<br/>
&gt; wanted to do. He started drawing again, so I bought him some really <br/>
&gt; nice papers<br/>
&gt;  and charcoals.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He and his friends started skateboarding, so we got him a skateboard <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; sent him to Camp Woodward that summer. Then he started filming other <br/>
&gt; skaters, so<br/>
&gt; we got him a camera. That eventually led to more filming (and his <br/>
&gt; first 6.5<br/>
&gt; minute film). Now he volunteers at the local independent film theatre <br/>
&gt; and is<br/>
&gt; called on by local film-makers to do camera work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He also asked for drums (who knows why!?), so he got drums one  <br/>
&gt; Christmas.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s really gotten into music. He&#39;s playing with three bands---all  <br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; styles. He&#39;s had a few lessons, but does it mostly on his own; only  <br/>
&gt; going to<br/>
&gt; Danny when he&#39;s struggling with something. He got a high-tech <br/>
&gt; metronome  for<br/>
&gt; Christmas this year. (My dad thought that was SOOOO funny---that a  <br/>
&gt; child would<br/>
&gt; *ask* for a metronome! &lt;g&gt;) He plays three-four  hours/day---sometimes <br/>
&gt; more.<br/>
&gt; Luckily, the drums are in our DEtached garage!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s traveled to Seattle with Wilderness Ventures. He&#39;s made many road <br/>
&gt;  trips<br/>
&gt; on his own since he got his license. He&#39;s flying out to Albuquerque  by<br/>
&gt; himself next month and to Europe with his cousin in September.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has three jobs: delivering a weekly paper to businesses,<br/>
&gt; pet/house-sitting, and catering. He has his volunteer gig at the <br/>
&gt; theatre. He has  the<br/>
&gt; film-making that keeps him thinking and the drumming that has him  <br/>
&gt; finding/playing<br/>
&gt; gigs at different bars every now and then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s so busy now ----like he&#39;s making up for those lost months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He thought he was stupid and was going nowhere without a diploma. <br/>
&gt; That&#39;s<br/>
&gt; what he heard from his friends. NOW his friends think his life is <br/>
&gt; pretty sweet.<br/>
&gt; So does he! &lt;g&gt; He has three friends from school that he still hangs <br/>
&gt; with.<br/>
&gt; His girlfriend, who is also in school. But most of his friends are in <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; 20&#39;s, with one in his 30&#39;s and 2-3 in their 40&#39;s! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s into Buddhism and is a vegetarian (mostly &lt;g&gt;). He has a lot of<br/>
&gt; questions and is not afraid to ask them. He LIKES his parents! &lt;g&gt; How <br/>
&gt;  novel! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just looked up at the subject. It says &quot;pros-cons question for <br/>
&gt; Kelly.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Cons: He still doesn&#39;t care to read much. He prefers non-fiction <br/>
&gt; anyway---always<br/>
&gt; has. Fiction he prefers through movies. Well, documentaries too! He <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; prefers  his information that way. But he reads just fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has his own back accounts and has been overdrawn once in three  <br/>
&gt; years. I<br/>
&gt; doubt that&#39;ll happen again soon! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He sat in on a college class last spring and was appalled at how <br/>
&gt; little  the<br/>
&gt; students wanted to be there. He liked the subject and participated in <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; class, but I doubt he&#39;ll go to college. Some may see that as a con. I <br/>
&gt; see  it as<br/>
&gt; well-thought out at this time. But he knows he could do the  work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s good to his girlfriend and sweet to the animals. He&#39;s gentle and<br/>
&gt; patient with his little brother. He&#39;s a loyal friend, but seems to <br/>
&gt; stay  away from<br/>
&gt; the trouble some of them seem to wallow in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He seems more and more comfortable in his skin every day. Happy with <br/>
&gt; who he<br/>
&gt; is and what he&#39;s doing. THAT is the best part!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That deschooling thing is hard----it&#39;s really, really hard. He needs <br/>
&gt; to  know<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re there. He needs to know you care. But he needs to be left to <br/>
&gt; heal. I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mean just left alone. There&#39;s this incredibly fine line between <br/>
&gt; leaving<br/>
&gt; him alone and letting him alone. I don&#39;t know how to explain it. But <br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; know  it AFTER you&#39;re through it! &lt;G&gt; Go figure!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Riding in the car was a great place for us to talk---that&#39;s why we <br/>
&gt; went to<br/>
&gt; the beach so much that first year! Duncan would fall asleep in the <br/>
&gt; back seat,<br/>
&gt; and Cameron and I could talk and talk and talk with no interruptions <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; without looking at each other (at night with the lights off is good <br/>
&gt; too!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quit nagging. Offer cool things to do and good movies to watch. Eat <br/>
&gt; out a<br/>
&gt; lot. Be his partner. Work together. Let him know that you&#39;re willing <br/>
&gt; to let him<br/>
&gt; heal from that school damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It gets better! It gets GREAT!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044886504">Sorry - meant to forward that t the unschoolingHIGHLIGHTS list, not <br/>
this one.<br/>
<br/>
So - in case there are people who don&#39;t know about it - I have an <br/>
announcement only list to which I send occasional forwards of posts off <br/>
of this list (UnschoolingDiscussion) and the UnschoolingBasics list.<br/>
<br/>
I send them when I happen to think, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a good one for the <br/>
HIGHLIGHTS list,&quot; or if somebody else forwards it to me and suggests it <br/>
should go to the HIGHLIGHTS list.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes days go by with no &quot;highlights,&quot; and other times the <br/>
discussions on very rich and I have to carefully pick and choose what <br/>
to forward.<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep the number of posts very very low and try to make sure <br/>
the posts that I forward are self-explanatory outside the context of <br/>
the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things the list has been great for is introducing people - <br/>
especially spouses - to unschooling ideas in little tiny bits - never <br/>
overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to subscribe, send a blank email to: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingHighlights-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingHighlights-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There is no discussion on the list - just the forwards that I send.<br/>
