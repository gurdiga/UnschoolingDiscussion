<div id="ygrps-yiv-882751011">Welcome pat,<br/>
<br/>
there  was a discussion several months back about &#39;control&#39; etc.   I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t necessarily recommend the archives....for that was a time a great<br/>
strife on this list,  which we are in the process of moving beyond (right,<br/>
everyone?  :-) )<br/>
    I remember Tia telling about her mother&#39;s analogy (help me out if you<br/>
need to Tia)....about how we as parents set fences for our children to keep<br/>
them safe.  As they mature,   the fence gets moved and changed with the<br/>
child&#39;s needs.  So,  as unschooling parents,  we want to provide them as<br/>
much autonomy as possible,  within the boundaries they are able to manage.<br/>
    Sound simple,  huh? LOL.....I think it is what unschoolers struggle with<br/>
at times.  It&#39;s easy to know that they are born with bodies that know when<br/>
they&#39;ve had enough to eat and enough rest,  though for many parents,  even<br/>
believing that is difficult.  As parents,  you decide what many things that<br/>
a child has no control over...housing, etc.    It doesn&#39;t mean handing over<br/>
control of the household to your children, but thay can become involved in<br/>
many things at an early age.  For example,  you stock the pantry,  prepare<br/>
the meals (or go out),  but if your child helped with the menu,  or wanted<br/>
some certain cereal or vegetable, that is respected.<br/>
    So you decide the fences...and when to move them.  I know at least one<br/>
person on this list said their family doesn&#39;t own a television.  We own<br/>
two.....kept in common family areas;  and we don&#39;t choose to subscribe to<br/>
cable (though I think some channels and shows would be excellent....we don&#39;t<br/>
miss it);  but if there&#39;s something someone wanted to see,  we could ask<br/>
lots of people to record it for us.  And most cable shows my kids have been<br/>
interested in eventually end up on video from the library.   Make sense?<br/>
    As to chore and manners...at our house,  I don&#39;t like to use the word<br/>
chores...it conjures up too much of a drudgery image to me!  And I believe<br/>
in the idea that if I&#39;m the one bothered by it,  I&#39;mthe one who needs to<br/>
change it.  I can sum it all up in three words:   example,  example,  and<br/>
example.<br/>
Hope you enjoy the list!<br/>

Thanks for your input.  I agree with you that there are many good shows on<br/>
TV and we are enriched by the History Channel, PBS and other shows like<br/>
that.  I guess I just haven&#39;t reached the point where I can just let go of<br/>
all balancing limits in our house.  I don&#39;t limit altogether, I just limit<br/>
for balance.  I remember reading in &quot;Hard Times in Paradise&quot; that the boys<br/>
didn&#39;t always like what they were asked to do.  I&#39;m just trying to find a<br/>
balance.  When it comes to their education, my kids are in charge.  When it<br/>
comes to matters of health, safety and overall values, I discuss, encourage,<br/>
and sometimes impose limits or require a certain level of effort.  Maybe<br/>
after I have been unschooling for their education a while, I will feel more<br/>
confident and let them be totally in charge of every thing with only my<br/>
input.  I hope so, it would be a lot easier.<br/>
<br/>
How DO unschoolers handle chores, manners, and other things of that nature?<br/>
