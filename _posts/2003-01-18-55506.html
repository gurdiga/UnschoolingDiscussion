<div id="ygrps-yiv-641462226">It sounds like what Holly has is an allergy to common metals. If she <br/>
wants to wear earings, but dosn&#39;t want to invest in gold there are <br/>
some options. If there is a piercing shop around you guys (a place <br/>
that does more than just ears) they should carry lots of different <br/>
types of jewlery.<br/>
Some of the options are, PVC (all plastic, comes in all sizes, styles <br/>
and colors) VERY few people react to it and it&#39;s REAL cheap, just a <br/>
couple of dollars. Another option is Niobium (think I spelled that <br/>
right) it is a metal but it&#39;s not a common metal and again, very few <br/>
people have a problem with it. It&#39;s more expensive than PVC but looks <br/>
a little nicer, it&#39;s less expensive than gold and will hold up WAY <br/>
better, (It&#39;s very similer to titainium). The other option that I can <br/>
think of is bone. Kinda expensive, but very cool. And if her body <br/>
just regects non-natural materials it is a way to go.<br/>
I think that there are a few other options and a professional piercer <br/>
would be able to tell her what they are.<br/>
HTH :-)<br/>

Though it&#39;s a bit disgusting, Holly has a fascination with wounds, and one of <br/>
her ears has a really interesting scab like nothing I&#39;ve seen.  It looks like <br/>
a little flower.  So she was joking (maybe) yesterday about maybe just <br/>
getting tattoos on her earlobes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903458735">Oh, I understand her fascination (hehe). I also understand her problem with metals, I was fine until I got third holes (in my ears) and found out that the cartalige in my ears came down really low, 10 years later I still have to wear the piercing studs and they can get kinda gross. <br/>
Jasons bestfriend is a cert. piercer/tattooist and his opinion would be for Holly to try the PVC or the bone because the chance of allergic reaction and/or regection would be the least.<br/>
Oh yah. Let Holly know that the earlobe can really hurt, lots of nerve endings and LOTS of little needles.<br/>
