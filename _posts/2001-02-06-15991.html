Ya know, the fool hasn&#39;t been in office even a month and he has managed to<br/>
open his big mouth and insert BOTH feet once again!<br/>
<br/>
Or am I the only one who read about his latest escapade with a microphone?<br/>
<br/>
While I am sure there are some on the list who think everyone&#39;s tax dollars<br/>
should be spent on stopping abortion, the vast majority of us don&#39;t want our<br/>
tax dollars given to the Catholic Church to fight abortion!<br/>
<br/>
Particularly in the sneaky underhanded way that Dumbya has gone about it!<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; If it started on the list, it<br/>
&gt; should be kept on the list unless otherwise invited to take it off list.<br/>
&gt; Taking it off list without the other&#39;s permission is harassment and<br/>
invasion<br/>
&gt; of privacy, imho. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree in general.  The harassment and invasion of privacy didn&#39;t bother<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; as much as the statement that I had run someone off, and then the obvious<br/>
&gt; dalliance of that person in the discussion, with another name (although I<br/>
&gt; guess Christina would give &quot;Chris&quot; and &quot;Tina&quot; both).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve written to people on the sides in discussions before (not here, not<br/>
&gt; lately anyway), but it&#39;s usually to clarify that they&#39;re about to<br/>
potentially<br/>
&gt; step in deep doody (if i know the folks and issues better than they do and<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re new), or to say something nice to them.  I&#39;ve never written a<br/>
&gt; spiteful thing on the side in private that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The central issue, still, is whether who we vote for for president is<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; to affect all of us as homeschoolers.  I think it will not.  And the<br/>
&gt; assumption that what a president thinks about birth control will change<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; our lives like a door slamming in our faces is no more likely.  The<br/>
president<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t a dictator.  He has some appointments and some vetoes and some<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; kissing his butt, but he can be outvoted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As to homeschooling, people did it in times and places when it was pretty<br/>
&gt; illegal (and it was never as illegal as some like to pretend it was), and<br/>
&gt; they were quiet and subtle about things.  If we had to do that again we<br/>
&gt; could.  If we all had to sign up for co-ops we could.<br/>
&gt; But we&#39;re not going to have to do that.  And the things people can learn<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; free at unschooling.com (and other places online, from other homeschoolers<br/>
&gt; who voluntarily share, like people on this list do, but more and cleaner<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; better) are useable no matter who&#39;s president, no matter whether the<br/>
&gt; president is pro-life, no matter whether other homeschooling families have<br/>
&gt; 007 video games or raise dogs.  All that stuff is interesting, but not<br/>
&gt; central to homeschooling.  Some people have a hard time separating object<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; field, and a harder time realizing not all objects are on the same kinds<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; fields.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, I&#39;m new here and probably shouldn&#39;t jump in, but I have to agree.  I<br/>
feel the government (or the church, for that matter) has NO RIGHT telling<br/>
women what they can or cannot do with their own bodies.  While I don&#39;t<br/>
particularly agree with abortion - after all, I AM trying to find a baby to<br/>
adopt - I don&#39;t judge people who see abortion as something they want to do,<br/>
as long as it is not being used as &#39;birth control.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Just my .02...<br/>

Trish<br/>
We want to adopt a baby!<br/>
If you or someone you know is interested<br/>
in placing a baby for adoption, and would<br/>
like more information, please see:<br/>
