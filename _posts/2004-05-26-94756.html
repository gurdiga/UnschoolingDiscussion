<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681873946">I love bugs.  Not in the &quot;fry them up and eat them with hot sauce&quot; way<br/>
(that&#39;s freakin&#39; crazy!) but in the<br/>
&quot;respect-them-as-intelligent-life-forms-pausing-briefly-on-Earth-before-m<br/>
oving-on-to-conquer-distant-galaxies&quot; way. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d discourage bug squishing by a little kid for the same reason I&#39;d stop<br/>
them from squeezing a cat or stomping a bunny.  I figure Lady Bugs really<br/>
want to go about their bug business without being squished.   I&#39;d aim in<br/>
that respect-for-living-things direction.  If she still wanted to eat<br/>
them then, I guess I&#39;d buy her a recipe book and myself a bottle of<br/>
tequila (wormless) and try to contact the mother ship with my sincere<br/>
condolences. <br/>

 Holly and I were out earlier this evening with a flashlight, seeing whether <br/>
maybe tomorrow is the day the day lilies will bloom.  Holly&#39;s going to be gone <br/>
for five days, and might miss the first bloom.<br/>
<br/>
We saw a few cockroaches.  Not the little brown zippy ones,  not the flying <br/>
flat kind, but the black ones (a.k.a. asian water bugs; gross).  Holly, who <br/>
loves all little things except mosquitos and cockroaches was yelling KILL THAT <br/>
ONE!  MOM!  GET THIS ONE!<br/>
<br/>
Only she was the one with the flashlight and she kept taking it off of <br/>
whatever I was supposed to be stomping.  <br/>
<br/>
I got five.  That&#39;s dozens to hundreds prevented.  (Maybe thousands, but I <br/>
don&#39;t like to think about that many.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked if I knew why people seem so particularly grossed out by <br/>
cockroaches, and I said I didn&#39;t know, but it did seem to be a fact.  And another <br/>
thing that lots of people were grossed out by, but not as many, would be snakes. <br/>
<br/>
That was the end of our musings at that  moment, but I&#39;m sure it will <br/>
continue, and if any of you have ideas I&#39;ll be glad to pass them on to her.<br/>

Space invaders.  They get right into *your* stuff.  We have better ways<br/>
to store food today but folks used to have to be diligent about keeping<br/>
roaches out of their food supply.  And I think people are nervous about<br/>
things that scurry around at night.  If we&#39;re sleeping we can&#39;t know what<br/>
their up to or where they&#39;ve been.  It feels like a violation.... little<br/>
burglars, stealing your food.  It&#39;s the same with mice.  Mice were<br/>
scarier because, well, their more like rats and with fur bearing critters<br/>
you get fleas and with fleas you get plague.  Not so much now but humans<br/>
are a lot like Velociraptors.  They remember. <br/>
<br/>
I held a Madagascar hissing cockroach at a bug fair and fell in love.  I<br/>
came home and researched where I could get one (Madagascar, of course!<br/>
&lt;G&gt; No, Carolina Biological Supply)  and priced a habitat and got it all<br/>
figured out.  I told David I was going to get a pair of them.  He said<br/>
something about dying before he lived deliberately with cockroaches and<br/>
cashing out all the credit cards and disappearing into the Arctic. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
He grew up in southern Arizona.  I grew up in Montana.  He had WAY<br/>
different feelings about cockroaches than I did.  <br/>
<br/>
In defense of roaches,  they are the worlds little garbage disposals.  If<br/>
there were no roaches, all the dead and decaying things in the world<br/>
would have to be eaten by Uni-bomber hermits and Vultures and those are<br/>
MUCH harder to stomp. <br/>

Hey, when I stomp a roach, ants come and take it away what&#39;s left within a <br/>
day.<br/>
Dead bird in the yard?  Give the ants a few days.  Maybe the cockroaches help <br/>
them.  Maybe if the ants aren&#39;t fast enough something will lay eggs in it.  <br/>
But soon, gone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398996186">Hi, Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s a natural instinct because they carry so many diseases and there <br/>
are so many of them? If we&#39;re grossed out by them then we might not be so <br/>
squeemish about killing them or at least removing them. I&#39;m that way <br/>
w/flies...but only since Shane was born. I can&#39;t stand them and just want them gone. Not <br/>
so much w/fleas (some carry plague, here) or mosquitoes (who can carry West <br/>
Nile Virus), but after many years of letting the black widows live... after <br/>
having Shane and finding our house overrun w/them when he was a baby, when I see <br/>
them, they must die and that&#39;s that. It&#39;s the mama bear protective thing. <br/>
Interestingly, that&#39;s not my attitude about rattlesnakes. I don&#39;t feel the need to <br/>
kill them, just relocate them, but they don&#39;t gross me out and I&#39;ve only run <br/>
into a few. I do really like all the non-poisionous snakes we have around.<br/>

Me too.  After I had Kirby I didn&#39;t feel that tender affection toward the <br/>
vermine I had once admired. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After I quit nursing Holly and she got old enough not to pick things up at <br/>
random that might be spiders, I started to think they were fascinating fellow <br/>
creatures again.    Except cockroaches.  For them, I hope for reincarnation so <br/>
they can come back as something happier and prettier.  <br/>

<br/>
Ok, roaches and ants are the worlds little garbage disposals.  And<br/>
carrion beetles.  And about a hundred thousand other bugs and insects. <br/>
And my dog.   <br/>
<br/>
Still, a world without of cockroaches would  suffer some terrible impact,<br/>
I&#39;m sure.  Like, that movie &quot;Men in Black&quot; would seem totally unrealistic<br/>
and impossible.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
***Dead bird in the yard?  Give the ants a few days.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering how I could get rid of my mother in law...<br/>
We had three ant hills blossom in our front yard this spring.  They&#39;re<br/>
black ants.  They&#39;re busy.  They bite when we pick them up, even though<br/>
we gave them lunch meat in a gesture of friendship.  They&#39;ll probably<br/>
grow to the size of small dogs and take over the town.  <br/>
