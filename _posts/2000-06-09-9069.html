<div id="ygrps-yiv-904964229">It&#39;s been wonderful hearing about all of you.  Thought I&#39;d share too.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you un/home school?  I am a teacher by profession (actually I never<br/>
went beyond getting my degree and doing my student teaching) and what I saw<br/>
the children experience in class made me realize that I would never want<br/>
that experience for my child.  There are great teachers out there, but the<br/>
institution of school is not (in my opinion) healthy for kids.  I also<br/>
really enjoy spending time with him, learning together and having fun.  We<br/>
would miss out on so much if he was at school most of the day.  The other<br/>
part that concerns me is the peer experience, where his peers (mainly) would<br/>
be teaching him how to relate to others...I think a mix of ages is better<br/>
for teaching social skills.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your child&#39;s age?  I have one son, Nick, who is five.  He is really<br/>
into anything having to do with space exploration.  Yesterday we had a great<br/>
time making a space buggy and star light-catcher.  He is also really into<br/>
knights and swords.  He, like some of the other little boys descibed on this<br/>
list, is into Pajama Sam games, majicians and carrying special treasures in<br/>
his pockets!<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?<br/>
We live in Olympia, Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Are you satisfied with the HS laws in the state?  Yes.  As I understand it,<br/>
Washington has some of the most liberal homeschooling laws.<br/>
<br/>
Other information:  We attend, not as often as I would like, the Unitarian<br/>
Universalist church in our area and really enjoy it.  I enjoy gardening and<br/>
knitting.  My husband works in the environmental field.<br/>
<br/>
Looking foward to getting to know you!<br/>
