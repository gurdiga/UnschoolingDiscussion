<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In Maryland we have to use one of two approved 
curriculi, give proof that we are covering all subjects that would be taught in 
ps, or use an approved church-based umbrella school.&nbsp; We have one here 
called The Learning Community.&nbsp; It&#39;s non-denominational and believes in 
unschooling.&nbsp; Since this will be the first year I would be dealing with the 
government, I thought it might be&nbsp;a good idea.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t seem I&#39;d 
have to submit to anything or change what I&#39;m doing but I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; Has 
anyone ever used an umbrella school like this?&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Lisa, I meant the correspondence courses.&nbsp; I&#39;m 
just a little apprehensive that with this being my first year unschooling I 
might not record&nbsp;things right or cover everything I&#39;m supposed&nbsp;to 
cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you had any trouble with either of these things?&nbsp; 
I&#39;m assuming you unschool.-Collette </font></div>
