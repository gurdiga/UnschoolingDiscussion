Holly wanted business cards of her own, and Kirby hands mine out with his <br/>
e-mail address written on the back, but we should just make some joint SCHOOL <br/>
cards, with all of us listed.<br/>

We even have titles for each of us &lt;g&gt; I, of course, am the Queen of <br/>
Everything, Hannah is the Princess of Quite a Lot, and Hayden is the Prince of <br/>
Whatever&#39;s Left.  <br/>
Hannah&#39;s turned into a social butterfly :) and likes to hand them out to her <br/>
friends, too.  <br/>
