<div id="ygrps-yiv-78338885">Let&#39;s do this!  It&#39;s kind of a game from a couple of years ago.  Some others<br/>
besides me might like it too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something I read after hitting Sandra&#39;s random button on her Bo<br/>
elevator which I labeled on my toolbar as RanBO and then I realized it looks<br/>
a lot like the word &quot;rainbow.&quot;  How appropriate.  Anyway, here&#39;s the<br/>
beginning snippet:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Someone wrote that they were keeping a little notebook of the questions<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that had arisen, so others on the Unschooling Discussion list started naming<br/>
questions of the day. I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
Sunday night Holly and I were in the hot tub and she asked me (out of the<br/>
blue, it seemed) whether people actually really ever put messages in<br/>
bottles. I said I thought so, and that there are streams and flows in<br/>
oceans, so they might know where they were likely to end up. But I said I<br/>
thought also people had done it just for fun, like letting a balloon go up<br/>
with your name and address fastened to it (she knows a story about that from<br/>
Ripley&#39;s Believe It or Not).<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday morning, I was looking for a rhyming dictionary link, and found<br/>
this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.poetry.com/timeless/default.asp">http://www.poetry.com/timeless/default.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an answer to the question, but it&#39;s a heck of a good coincidence.<br/>
They&#39;re selling pretty bottles with poems on pretty paper, mailed to where<br/>
you order.<br/>

Other links started to flood in.... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<br/>
So a recent question I&#39;ve collected has a little intro about how it came up:<br/>
<br/>
A couple weeks ago (or so ... I don&#39;t remember quite how long it&#39;s been)<br/>
Karl asked how come the electric piano is messed up.  I said probably<br/>
lightning got it.  He thought about that for however long it&#39;s been.<br/>
Yesterday he said lightning came into the window and struck the piano (and<br/>
he&#39;s five so he&#39;s traced the path from way outside, bringing in some idea<br/>
about trees because he saw a youtube video of a tree catching fire after<br/>
being struck).<br/>
<br/>
So his question now is how does lightning really work?  I&#39;ve looked it up<br/>
and it&#39;s all about the earth&#39;s magnetic fields, another mystery and an<br/>
abiding interest of Karl&#39;s.  Note to self: compass!  So I&#39;m looking for<br/>
connections others might have to add about any of that.<br/>
<br/>
I just love that Karl makes observations which beg still more and more<br/>
question(s) and sometimes they really lead me around looking at this and<br/>
that.  Really.  The time I spend on it ... getting lost.  I&#39;m not getting<br/>
lost.  I *am* lost.  Oh... and there&#39;s no need to send out a search party.<br/>
I&#39;ll just get lost again in short order.  ;)  I just love that.<br/>
