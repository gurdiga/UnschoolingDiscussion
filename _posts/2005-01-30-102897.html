<div id="ygrps-yiv-414364980">Got this in my local email today - thought some of you might want to check it <br/>
out. :)<br/>
<br/>
The Learning Community Group would like to announce the launch of our<br/>
CyberSchool and our first online class: Video Game Design!  This class<br/>
teaches students from 4th grade on how to make their own video games using<br/>
simple drag and drop software. This nineteen chapter class covers the basics<br/>
of creating an original video game from scratch, and introduces potential<br/>
Video Game Designers to one of the today’s biggest emerging industries!<br/>
<br/>
The CyberSchool is a great way for students of all ages and backgrounds to<br/>
complete an entire technology class from the comfort of their home, school,<br/>
or community learning center. CyberSchool classes are both innovative and<br/>
inexpensive and can be completed at a student’s own pace. For $20, students<br/>
get one month to complete the same class that the LCG taught this past<br/>
summer at the Museum of Science in Boston for $235!<br/>
<br/>
The CyberSchool interface provides video chapters of a master instructor’s<br/>
computer screen as he/she walks students through the Video Game Design<br/>
process step-by-step. The CyberSchool also provides students with access to<br/>
an online Forum System for discussion with other students and LCG staff. <br/>
Soon students will be able to view their work in an upcoming CyberSchool<br/>
Gallery. All that is required to take classes through the CyberSchool is a<br/>
computer with an Internet connection, Flash Player 7 (free) and speakers (or<br/>
headphones).<br/>
<br/>
The software required for this class is Multimedia Fusion (currently PC<br/>
only). This software is available exclusively to LCG students who have<br/>
enrolled in our Video Game Design class for $60! (40% off the retail price<br/>
of $100).<br/>
<br/>
To enroll:<br/>
<br/>
1)      Go to www.thelcg.com/cyberschool and sign up for a free CyberSchool<br/>
account.<br/>
<br/>
2)      Log into the CyberSchool and purchase the class.<br/>
<br/>
3)      Purchase Multimedia Fusion at www.thelcg.com/store.<br/>
<br/>
4)      You can start the class once you have received your software kit in<br/>
the mail!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to seeing you at the CyberSchool!<br/>
<br/>
The CyberSchool Team<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, Deb beat me to this! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I have no clue if the course is any good. They do this course &quot;live&quot; at the<br/>
Museum of Science in Boston and the musuem has a good reputation for fun<br/>
courses. Kathryn has taken a class at the museum and really liked it (but it<br/>
was done by other people.)<br/>
<br/>
What it looks like is maybe they recorded the instruction part of the class<br/>
and then the feedback comes from posting questions on a forum?<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn took a different video game course and used Multimedia Fusion. (It&#39;s<br/>
only for the PC, by the way.) She said she liked the graphics she could use<br/>
better than Stagecast, and she could figure out how to do levels and design<br/>
a big boss to beat. (I know Stagecast will do levels and bosses but maybe<br/>
the tutorials weren&#39;t as helpful for something like that? She said she<br/>
wasn&#39;t sure if she found Multimedia Fusion easier because it is easier or<br/>
because she had live help during the course.)<br/>
<br/>
But if Multimedia Fusion looks good, the course is only $20 and they give<br/>
you a $40 discount on the software so you could save money on the software<br/>
by signing up for the course.<br/>
