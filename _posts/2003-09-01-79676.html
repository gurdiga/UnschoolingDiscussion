<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881559154">&quot; As children we are like sponges, joyfully <br/>
absorbing everything our senses come into contact with, our brains <br/>
and bodies bursting with desire to know and feel and connect and see <br/>
and relate and hear and do and experience. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really liked that. <br/>
