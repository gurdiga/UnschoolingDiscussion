<div id="ygrps-yiv-709641276">For Aime (and anyone else interested):<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty strict about my first son&#39;s tv viewing... he could only watch <br/>
so much a day, only certain shows, etc. As a result (I believe), he was <br/>
always asking to watch TV. It seemed to become the most important thing in <br/>
the world to him. (There&#39;s a boy in our Scout troop who is allowed half an <br/>
hour of TV a day. Guess what he does the entire time when the meetings are <br/>
at our house.)<br/>
<br/>
My second son (4) had pretty much unlimited access, but he&#39;s much less <br/>
interested. He does watch TV -- Rugrats and his &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; <br/>
video are his faveorites -- but he spends much more time drawing, looking at <br/>
books, building forts, playing with Legos, playing with his brother, <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I just decided not to make a big issue out of it any more. The older guy no <br/>
longer seems to eagerly pine for TV at all times, though he too still <br/>
watches a couple hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
I also have to say that having watched some of the cartoons they like <br/>
(Rugrats, the Wild Thornberrys, Ed Edd and Eddy, Spongebob) I find the shows <br/>
about 100 times more literate and wittier than the cartoons were when I was <br/>
a kid.<br/>
<br/>
My older boy is finally picking up a book and going into a quiet room to <br/>
read for pleasure -- no prompting. He&#39;s 8. I have always been a bookworm, we <br/>
read together a lot and I had always hoped he would come to share the joy I <br/>
get from books. But I decided I would never tell him to read, because that <br/>
would undermine the whole point of doing it  because you love it. I took <br/>
great encouragement from a wise friend of mine who has two teenage boys. She <br/>
observed that she knows few boys who &quot;love to read.&quot; But she knows lots of <br/>
men who do.<br/>
