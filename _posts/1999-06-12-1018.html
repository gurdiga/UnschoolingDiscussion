==================================<br/>
Back in July, we let you know about the Authors Special Pre-publication<br/>
Edition of The Underground History of American Education: A Schoolteachers<br/>
Intimate Investigation Into the Problem of Modern Schooling, by John Taylor<br/>
Gatto. We told you that the first market edition would be released on<br/>
January 31, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you asked what an Authors Special Pre-publication Edition was and<br/>
how it would differ from a first market edition. We explained that John<br/>
had actually published the book himself in the full format he wanted to see<br/>
released. He was concerned that most publishers would argue against a 3<br/>
pound, 412 page book and would want to edit it down to a smaller size. By<br/>
publishing it himself (the Authors special edition)and demonstrating that<br/>
there was a good market for the book as is, he hoped to be in a stronger<br/>
negotiating position when he made a deal with a bigger publishing company.<br/>
His original intent was to have a deal with a publisher by the end of the<br/>
year and to have them release the first edition for the general market by<br/>
the end of January.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some changes and a special offer for purchasers of the book.<br/>
A documentary based on Johns book is now in the works. Because of the film,<br/>
John wants to stay flexible and keep all of his options open, so he has<br/>
decided not to make a deal with any publishers for the rights to his book<br/>
this year. There will be no first market edition in January. John will<br/>
continue to publish the current edition until late next spring. At that<br/>
time, he may consider making a deal with a publisher, but he has decided<br/>
that he will not allow a reduction in the size of the book. Subsequent<br/>
printings will correct a few typos, and the cover art may be changed to<br/>
something that will reproduce better in catalogs, but the book will remain<br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
Now heres another great reason to purchase this book. Everyone who<br/>
purchases a copy before September, 2001 is eligible for what John is calling<br/>
a Writers Vacation. A drawing will be held during the first week of<br/>
September, 2001 and the winner will get airfare and up to a month in an<br/>
ocean view apartment with three bedrooms in Alicante, Spain for use between<br/>
November 30 and March 30 when the weather in Alicante is spring-like. If<br/>
enough books are sold, John might even throw in airfare for an additional<br/>
person and a free rental car for two weeks!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who has purchased The Underground History of American Education<br/>
from FUN Books is eligible for this drawing and can participate by sending<br/>
in a post card. With every purchase, we will include directions on what to<br/>
put on your postcard and where to send it. If you purchased a copy from us<br/>
before this offer was made, you are still eligible to participate. Just send<br/>
an e-mail message to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fun@...">fun@...</a> with your name and address. We will<br/>
then send you the information needed to enter the drawing.<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; Is there any *graduates* of unschooling with success stories to tell??<br/>
<br/>
  They are out there. It&#39;s just tough to find the people and their stories<br/>
  because when people are living contented lives, they generally don&#39;t have a<br/>
  burning need to go out and tell everyone how they did it. Whereas if they<br/>
  have complaints, then they have a powerful need to vent to whoever will<br/>
  listen ;-)<br/>
<br/>
  Peter Kowalke is one grown unschooler. He has a webpage at<br/>
  http://www.peterkowalke.com/<br/>
<br/>
  Grace Llewellyn runs the Not Back to School Camp (http://www.nbtsc.org) and<br/>
  they have a message board. I&#39;d bet many of the kids keep in touch after<br/>
  they&#39;ve moved on.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; You see I still have this FEAR that my child is missing something from this<br/>
  &gt; that I will regret years down the road.<br/>
<br/>
  It helps if you can try to identify what exactly you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss.<br/>
  Too often we end up choosing the path laid out by &quot;experts&quot; because we&#39;re<br/>
  certain there are things we&#39;d never think to ask about but that the experts<br/>
  have already asked all possible questions and found answers to them.<br/>
<br/>
  School-type learning (eg, making sure they cover &quot;the essentials&quot;) is *one*<br/>
  solution. But it&#39;s a solution with it&#39;s own flaws. Learning &quot;because it&#39;s<br/>
  important to your future&quot; is hard and time consuming and is designed more to<br/>
  provide feedback that the things were taught not that they were learned.<br/>
<br/>
  So what is it you&#39;re afraid he&#39;ll miss? If you can pinpoint your worries,<br/>
  they can be dealt with.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Unschooling sounds good and seems to<br/>
  &gt; work as far as keeping my son happy with learning.  But I&#39;m having serious<br/>
  &gt; doubts that HE is learning all he will need later.<br/>
<br/>
  If we assume there&#39;s a body of learning that is unconnected to what it would<br/>
  be used for, then that&#39;s a legitimate worry.<br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately school gives us the impression that there&#39;s a *huge* body of<br/>
  knowledge that&#39;s unconnected to its use. Mainly because schools teach it<br/>
  that way: isolated and out of context. The only way to learn math seems to<br/>
  be to do a gazillion math problems. The only way to learn science seems to<br/>
  be to memorize all the answers scientists have discovered. The only way to<br/>
  learn history is to start at the beginning and go through all the<br/>
  &quot;important&quot; events to present day.<br/>
<br/>
  But when we learn by living life, all that stuff becomes tools that we pick<br/>
  up and use for the purpose intended. There&#39;s no reason not to use (and learn<br/>
  as a side effect) math when there are games and stuff to spend allowance on<br/>
  and things to figure out. There&#39;s no reason not to use science when the<br/>
  world is full of wonderous things and a child is filled with curiosity. (It<br/>
  won&#39;t look like school science. It will look like -- and *be* -- real<br/>
  science: observing and asking questions and theorizing what could be the<br/>
  cause.) There&#39;s no reason to not use history when the past is full of<br/>
  stories of interesting people and places and events.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I also have to disagree with the TV watching.  NO CHILD, unschooled,<br/>
  &gt; homeschooled, public schooled, or anything else can benefit from watching ALL<br/>
  &gt; the TV they want!!<br/>
<br/>
  What if you said &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from reading ALL the books they<br/>
  want!!&quot; or &quot;NO CHILD can benefit from playing ALL the games they want!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s assuming (or extrapolating from some different situation) that when<br/>
  children are allowed all the TV they want, they&#39;ll do little else, that<br/>
  they&#39;ll spend years watching indescriminately.<br/>
<br/>
  Why would they?<br/>
<br/>
  *If* TV is controlled and doled out like a prize, then they&#39;ll watch garbage<br/>
  just because TV is so precious. *If* they are in school, they&#39;ll often watch<br/>
  TV as a way of depressurizing after school.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooled kids, given free access to TV have neither of those reasons for<br/>
  watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Sorry folks, but that&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
  But are you basing what you say on your opinion of what will happen or on<br/>
  personal knowledge of allowing your kids for many months to watch as much TV<br/>
  as they want?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; There&#39;s far too much GARBAGE on TV to have a positive influence.<br/>
<br/>
  Why do you think children would choose deliberately to watch garbage? Do our<br/>
  tastes need to be molded by experts in what is good in order to choose what<br/>
  is good? Or can our kids develop their own sense of what is good and bad by<br/>
  experiencing good and bad and deciding from their experience what is useful<br/>
  to them and what is not?<br/>
<br/>
  Or are children such slaves to a need to be entertained that they&#39;d choose<br/>
  garbge over going somewhere or doing something they enjoy with mom?<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; THere is no requirement of<br/>
  &gt; thinking for a child when they watch hours of TV.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe if children feel overloaded and are choosing TV as a way to turn off<br/>
  the pressures they have no control over. (As schooled kids might.)<br/>
<br/>
  But since my daughter absorbes tons of stuff -- things that relate to her<br/>
  world as well as the adult world -- then I&#39;d say she&#39;s doing a great deal of<br/>
  thinking.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; I don&#39;t care how *Good* the<br/>
  &gt; programs are.  Children develop mentally by THINKING, using their imagination,<br/>
  &gt; creativity!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  And many children find TV a great fodder for thinking, imagination and<br/>
  creativity. Pokemon has branched off into a huge number of things that<br/>
  relate to adult knowledge and adult skills.<br/>
<br/>
  But I think we also need to recognize the value of their needs as the people<br/>
  they are right now. Memorizing all 251 Pokemon isn&#39;t something she&#39;ll use<br/>
  much as an adult -- though it exercises skills she&#39;ll use as an adult -- but<br/>
  it&#39;s something that&#39;s important to the person she is right now. And feeding<br/>
  what&#39;s important to her right now is what will help her become the person<br/>
  she will be.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; How can people think  that PS is a bad influence but then can let the child<br/>
  &gt; sit in front of the TV hours on end???<br/>
<br/>
  Because there&#39;s more than passively watching involved in PS. There&#39;s being<br/>
  there by force, listening to and doing something they don&#39;t care to learn.<br/>
<br/>
  A child watching TV is choosing what appeals to him, what *he* finds useful.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; And I don&#39;t believe they are watching<br/>
  &gt; *EDUCATIONAL* programs all this time.  Children learn from TV good and bad.<br/>
  &gt; Are these parents who allow unlimited TV being selective about what they<br/>
  &gt; watch?<br/>
<br/>
  There isn&#39;t a need to. Children are self-selective. My daughter may choose<br/>
  things that I wouldn&#39;t choose for her, but she has needs that are different<br/>
  than mine. I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s getting out of Squarebob Spongepants, but<br/>
  the enthusiasm with which she watches it and then replays verbally for me<br/>
  all the episodes, means there&#39;s something important to her.<br/>
<br/>
  She won&#39;t watch anything that&#39;s scary or sexual any more than she&#39;d watch a<br/>
  political talk show. Her world is divided into useful to her and not useful<br/>
  to her rather than good and forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
  I am selective about what *I* watch. There are R movies that we choose to<br/>
  watch when she isn&#39;t there or has other things to occupy her. We don&#39;t force<br/>
  her to choose between watching an adult movie with us vs being alone. But<br/>
  given full freedom to choose anything she wants, she doesn&#39;t choose the<br/>

<br/>
The instructions are at the bottom of each email, but here they are a bit<br/>
clearer:<br/>
<br/>
Just send a blank email to the address:<br/>
