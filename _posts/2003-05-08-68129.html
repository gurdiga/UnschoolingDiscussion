<div id="ygrps-yiv-638157237">Sandra this is a wonderful and powerful piece of writing and I hope you<br/>
link it on your web site.<br/>
<br/>
I read it three times and though I didn&#39;t think it was possible, I&#39;m more<br/>
impressed with your wisdom and insight than ever before.<br/>
<br/>
This is really mushy and I should have sent it privately but I thought<br/>
you deserved to have some fan mail splashed around here, too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Uh...  THANKS!<br/>
(That means I have to go and find it...)<br/>
<br/>
Matthew&#39;s family might not appreciate having him memorialized as an eventual <br/>
irritating failure (though it might be the best memorial he had--DOH!), and <br/>
Todd Petty&#39;s probably had e-mail since 1973 or whenever, and might not (or <br/>
MIGHT!) want to read how I summarized his life as (also I don&#39;t know now <br/>
whether he&#39;s in peaceful glory or having difficulties).   Hmmm....<br/>
<br/>
I could edit their names out so that only people who know us would know who <br/>
it was (and they would!) but they couldn&#39;t find themselves on the internet... <br/>
 I&#39;ll look at it again and think about it.  I had figured it just for part of <br/>
the flowing river of &quot;oh HUH!&quot; kind of soothing rant this list lives for. <br/>
