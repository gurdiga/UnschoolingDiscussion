Maybe I read too much into it. Maybe I *wanted* him to be an anarchist!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189946677">Anarchist!  I never considered that. :) It doesn&#39;t matter to me <br/>
though.  I knew unschooling worked before I read anything he wrote <br/>
because I grew up that way despite 13 1/2 years of government <br/>
school.  He just put a name to it, broadened my horizons a bit and <br/>
created a support network.  For that I&#39;m thankful, politics aside.  <br/>
