<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649132626">Longtime unschoolers here....My boys are 14 and 10 and have never been<br/>
to school nor &quot;done school&quot; at home.  They have somehow learned to read,<br/>
write, figure ratios, read maps, estimate milage and gas costs for our<br/>
holidays, do their own banking, cook meals, change a tire,  build a<br/>
computer....and so on without so much as a day&#39;s &quot;seat work&quot;.  They are<br/>
bright, resourceful, creative young men and I have learned much about<br/>
learning from them.  We have become a whole family of autodidacts.<br/>
<br/>
Passion is our curriculum - whatever the passion du jour is becomes the<br/>
delivery system.  Baseball has been and continues to be a large factor<br/>
in this family&#39;s learning, and we have all learned much from playing,<br/>
reading about, watching, umping baseball.  (read more about this at:<br/>

  I have been on the home-ed list and the homeschool-ca (ca as in<br/>
Canada:-)  lists for years and am part of the site  management team for<br/>
the Canadian Homeschool Resource pages.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here we are.  This list looks like it&#39;s going to be a great<br/>
forum.  I&#39;m glad to be here.<br/>
