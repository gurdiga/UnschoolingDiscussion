<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321663590">New to the group and thought I&#39;d introduce myself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Julie and we have 5 kids through adoption after many years of<br/>
infertility.  We just recently &quot;retired&quot; from foster parenting, at least for<br/>
a while.  We live close to San Antonio and have been unschooling for about<br/>
18 months and homeschooling about 3 years.  My kids are 10, 8, 4, 2 and 2.<br/>
