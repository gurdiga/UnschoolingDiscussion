I work part time and my dh and I run a home business.<br/>
It works beautifully for the most part (except lately when I&#39;ve had to work <br/>
more hours than normal, but that will not continue).<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten to give my kids access to stuff they couldn&#39;t have unless I work.<br/>
They all have spending money, get lessons they choose occasionally and go <br/>
neat places (like Columbia, SC!!) all because I choose to work.<br/>
And if someone in the family doesn&#39;t work, how do you unschool?<br/>
