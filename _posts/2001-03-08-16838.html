<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099220305">Hi Kim,<br/>
Welcome to the list!!  We are in the SE part of the state.. near Cape<br/>
Girardeau! We may not be too far away from each other!<br/>
Most of my materials..I&#39;ve already sold. I listed it yesterday and already<br/>
generated about 40 emails..WOW!  It was a mish mosh of stuff mostly. It&#39;s so<br/>
&#39;freeing&#39; to be getting rid of all the schoolish junk!! We are a total<br/>
unschooling family now..and its wonderful. Took us 8 years to get here tho..<br/>
Ha.,<br/>
