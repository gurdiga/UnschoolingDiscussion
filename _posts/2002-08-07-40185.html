<div id="ygrps-yiv-291720017">Diet for a Small Planet.. is a great book about this type of controversy.. it has all the stuff about amino acids and the combinations thereof that constitute protien.. it&#39;s main message is, of course, that being vegetarian is a more practical solution to feed many people than feeding valuable foodstuffs to animals then eating the animals.. <br/>
<br/>
i read it back in the seventies when i was a vegetarian.. and i was a young adult.. now, tho i&#39;m far from being a vegetarian.. i sure dont&#39; worry about eating meat all the time.. eat very little (specially i hate to cook it.. raw meat is yucky to me) but always remembered the combo things.. like legumes and grain.. and dairy and grain or legumes and grains.. it&#39;s cool.. i&#39;d bet there is more up to date info these days.. and if anyone questions you and your son&#39;s decision about food.. you can have ammo to reassure yourself. ... AND to get doc&#39;s off your back about it.. they dont&#39; give them much training in nutrition in med school.<br/>

  Hi, guys,<br/>
<br/>
  I need a support group today and you all are going to have to be it for me!<br/>
  My six year old son read Charlotte&#39;s Web, loved the book, hated the part<br/>
  about killing animals for food, spent a couple days thinking and talking<br/>
  about it, and decided he&#39;s never eating meat again.<br/>
<br/>
  I took him seriously, and believe in his right to make decisions about his<br/>
  life.  We discussed nutrition, protein, balanced diets, etc.  Our family has<br/>
  never been heavy meat eaters, so it&#39;s not a huge transition, although it<br/>
  does require a bit more planning.  It&#39;s been about a month, and still going<br/>
  strong.<br/>
<br/>
  The problem?  The reactions from absolutely everybody.  The doctor tried to<br/>
  tell him he MUST eat meat, until I cut him off (time for a new doctor.<br/>
  gotta work on the army on that one.).  His friends don&#39;t care, but their<br/>
  parents laugh at him, about him, treat it like it&#39;s a silly little phase or<br/>
  something abhorant.  We had an family BBQ with army folks my dh works with,<br/>
  and people acted like we&#39;re wrong for not just making him eat meat, and must<br/>
  have no control as parents.  All this for taking a child seriously?!<br/>
<br/>
  I truly believe I&#39;m doing the right thing here.  But my best friend just<br/>
  told me how stupid I&#39;m being about this (by &quot;humoring him&quot;-- her words, not<br/>
  mine), and I need some support.  Thanks!<br/>

And yes, sometimes ppl act like you&#39;re cuckoo for taking your child <br/>
seriously for anything, but diet seems to be an even bigger issue. We have <br/>
enjoyed www.vegetarianbaby.com in the past. The kids like to read it when <br/>
I&#39;m done, and they have some great diet pins. The kids have been known to <br/>
wear them when we go to certain places to cut down on the comments.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So I&#39;ve noticed!  It&#39;s sad when a musician knows more about nutrition than a<br/>
doctor.  I read Diet for a Small Planet many years ago, and again in the<br/>
last couple months to refresh my memory.  It&#39;s a good book, if a bit dated.<br/>
<br/>
But really, my problem has just been feeling discouraged that it&#39;s so<br/>
anti-cultural to take a child&#39;s opinion seriously.  That people, including<br/>
&quot;friends&quot;, would tell me that it&#39;s bad parenting to do so.  A BIG Thank You<br/>
to everyone for positive feedback.  Sometimes I just need somebody to agree<br/>
with me that I&#39;m doing the right thing!<br/>
