 </span></blockquote>Hi Erin, I hope you don&#39;t mind my adding my<br/>
thoughts...Birth is very traumatic on a baby for many<br/>
different reasons The way a baby is &quot;delivered&quot; {i<br/>
hate that word} by a dr or midwife...babies sometimes<br/>
get stuck and have to be &quot;helped out&quot; {this happened<br/>
to my Tessa, a home birth, I won&#39;t bore you with the<br/>
details} <br/>
This can cause a subluxation.{chiro word} meaning<br/>
things are out of alinement. When Tessa was born you<br/>
could hear her breathing, almost a weezing, when you<br/>
walked into the room... until our chiro came to adjust<br/>
her several hours after she was born. Then you had to<br/>
put your ear to her mouth to her the breaths. Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
You also asked what did people do before chiro care?<br/>
Well I imagined they suffered. Headaches, neck aches,<br/>
vision problems, leg pains, hand pains..etc.<br/>
Everything is connected off the spine, keep that in<br/>
alinement things work better! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
also, why the continual<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; adjustments?  what do we <br/>
&gt; keep doing to ourselves in the course of our days<br/>
&gt; where we&#39;d need to keep <br/>
&gt; going and going to keep getting adjusted?  i guess<br/>
&gt; the thought of being so <br/>
&gt; dependent is unappealing, too.<br/>

maintain good health but also to fix things. When<br/>
Tessa was 3 she feel backwards off a swing and by the<br/>
time I got her in the house she had a fever! A quick<br/>
run to the chiro for an adjustment and the fever broke<br/>
right in his office! He said when the body {in her<br/>
case neck} is out of alinement sometime a fever will<br/>
be produced as the body way of trying to fight off<br/>
what is wrong. Dr. also said everyday falls for kids<br/>
are the kind to be checked regularly so they don&#39;t<br/>
develop into worse problems later on in life. For my<br/>
family I try to take the girls every other month but<br/>
right away if they catch a cold or have a fall. Sorry<br/>
so long but a subject near to my heart! <br/>
