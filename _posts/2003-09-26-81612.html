<br/>
&lt;&lt;This coming Sunday?!  Me, too!  (Well, not 13;  46 actually).  Happy <br/>
birthday, Jake!!!  How cool!<br/>
<br/>
Marji &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marji, thanks again SO much for helping with the Marty / Weird Al / Star Wars <br/>
/ American Pie singalong, and thanks to all those who merrily sang along.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh!  That was so much fun!!!  Liam and I are STILL singing that song.  I <br/>
wonder if Shyrley and Heather still are, too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you, Sandra and Marty, for being so cool with Liam to let him <br/>
stand up there and wave his light saber around during the tune.  It meant a <br/>
lot to him (he spent a great deal of the time leading up to it practicing <br/>
in the other room).<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  To Shyrley:  Liam wonders when Heather can come and play here at our <br/>
house.</div>
