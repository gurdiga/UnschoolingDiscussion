<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252553825">This might help... from what I was told, would be abductors look for easy<br/>
targets... parents who appear to not be keeping an eye on their kids. I was<br/>
told (and admittedly, not by anyone with a degree or a job in this sort of<br/>
thing) that if a parent watches their children when out, keeps them close,<br/>
and, for example, constantly checks on their whereabouts at a park (or other<br/>
open public place) they will go elsewhere. So with that in mind, I just look<br/>
aware when we&#39;re out in public, and my fears are settled, because I know<br/>
that I don&#39;t look like a good target.<br/>
