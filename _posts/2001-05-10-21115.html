Alfalfa is good for allergies.  Also, raw unheated local honey will <br/>
help with allergies a lot.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658807262">it does sound like grass allergies. I am a sufferer myself. I will get red bumps first that turn into red itchy patches. Usually it starts inside my elbow joint or on the inside of my wrist. I have not found an herbal remedy, but use the avoidance method. If I have to work around grass or hay, I make sure I use a long sleeve shirt I can wash and a  pair of gloves. I don&#39;t mow the lawn. Either my husband does or the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670663126">Some grasses, particularly some that you find in volunteer hay, shed<br/>
microscopic little razor sharp particles and/or little barb type thread<br/>
sized things.  They actually imbed themselves in the skin, kinda like<br/>
fiberglass.  You never know what is in volunteer or grass hay--wild oats,<br/>
bur clover, vetch and even stuff like star thistle, all of which are<br/>
shedders that embed.<br/>
<br/>
We found the best thing to do was just running cold water (the little spray<br/>
thingy in sinks works great if ya don&#39;t want to take a cold shower &lt;g&gt;) and<br/>
not doing any scrub type activity because it rubbed the things in further.<br/>
When stuff like tea bags, aloe, etc. didn&#39;t work and we have to break down<br/>
and use something chemical, we&#39;ve found that Solarcaine Aloe Extra Burn<br/>
Relief Gel is really great for itches and burns.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100240990">I suspect your right.<br/>
You could try using local honey a teaspoon a day, this works like<br/>
homeopathics, local allergens, pollen, etc..<br/>
I would also suggest a chickweed and comfrey compress when the itching<br/>
is bothering her, or a salve. Compresses will offer instant relief. You<br/>
can also use plantain, slippery elm and saint john&#39;s wort for topical<br/>
solutions also.<br/>
If she is allergic to grass, it may be to a bacteria currently present,<br/>
a pollen, a new growth in the grass. This hasn&#39;t happened until this<br/>
year, I am assuming this?<br/>
Witch Hazel will also assist in soothing the rash.<br/>
I hope some of this helps. If you have any specific questions feel free<br/>
to contact me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563952842">It does sound like an allergy to grass and grass products. Do a search online and see what the remedy is under herbal products for grass allergens. I know my mom and brother were allergic to the grass, but then they had shots. Mom doesn&#39;t take the shots anymore...so I don&#39;t know if her resistance built up or if she grew out of the allergy.<br/>
