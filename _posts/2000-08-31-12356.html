<div id="ygrps-yiv-853755014">unschooling is really hard!  (wah, wah)  it would be so much easier to obsess <br/>
about the year plan, pick the subjects, divide them into weeks, lay it all <br/>
out neat and orderly and then &quot;enforce!&quot;  though it would be a pain in the <br/>
neck, we could have that sense of accomplishment and be done with it for the <br/>
day.  and the grandparents would be so impressed with the breadth and depth <br/>
of our curriculum, and also i&#39;d have room to relax, and not wonder if <br/>
unschooling will fail us. and though my children might be sullen and <br/>
resentful about learning, i would have approval from my relatives and <br/>
homeschooling community so maybe that would hide the knowledge that my kids <br/>
werent really thriving....  <br/>
