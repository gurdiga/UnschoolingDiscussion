<div id="ygrps-yiv-204478117">I am also new to unschooling, and my oldest has just<br/>
dropped out of middle school to join us at home. Its<br/>
been several months of computer games and tv, music,<br/>
journaling, aikido, reading, writing, scouting, etc.<br/>
All seems to be going really well as far as that is<br/>
concerned. I do have my moments, that I feel<br/>
concerned, as I know she wants to go to college, and<br/>
the school that she hopes to go to, where my husband<br/>
teaches, is difficult to get into...We have the added<br/>
incentive of her attending there because we don&#39;t have<br/>
to pay for tuition.<br/>
<br/>
So, the idea of transcripts, etc. is a valid concern.<br/>
We are reading The Teenage Liberation Handbook, and<br/>
brainstorming ideas of how Eva can follow her own path<br/>
and still meet the requirements for college. The one<br/>
idea that we keep coming to again and again, is that<br/>
when she reaches ninth grade, we feel perhaps<br/>
enrolling her into Clonlara&#39;s compuhigh program might<br/>
work best for her. She will decide when we get there,<br/>
I suppose. We are enrolled through Clonlara currently,<br/>
and there is a safety net for me in doing so, I think,<br/>
because they are able to keep transcripts for the work<br/>
we are doing, and Eva could enroll into high school<br/>
from Clonlara without any problems. <br/>
<br/>
There are some interesting articles on the clonlara<br/>
site....<br/>
<br/>
www.clonlara.org.<br/>
<br/>
If you come across anything else that helps you along<br/>
the way, please post. I would love to read what others<br/>
are experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you!<br/>
<br/>
Lori<br/>

with the percentages of who has gotten into Stanford<br/>
and Harvard. It is that this is the school that we can<br/>
&quot;afford&quot; to send her to, and she would like to go to. <br/>

community. There are just a handful in the town I am<br/>
in, and I know of none older than 13. So, as Is said,<br/>
it may not be necessary at all to have the back up. Or<br/>
it may be. Either way, she&#39;s got support from<br/>
Clonlara, and they have dealt with this kind of stuff<br/>
a lot longer than I have.<br/>

colleges and universities are treating hs students differently than <br/>
schooled kids in terms of admissions.  You might want to  ask what their <br/>
policy is on hs admissions.<br/>
