<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417288974">Hello unschoolers...<br/>
<br/>
There has been a discussion about the Bible, religion, Christianity, <br/>
etc. going on for awhile. I opened my mouth and inserted my foot, <br/>
here:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The Bible doesn&#39;t say that Judas bought himself a field with the <br/>
&gt;silver. One account has Judas hanging himself, and another account <br/>
&gt;has him falling and bursting asunder. If you think about it, a dead <br/>
&gt;body, after a few days, falling from the limb it was hanging on, or <br/>
&gt;the limb breaking...it would VERY EASILY burst asunder and its <br/>
&gt;bowels gush out. Ugh. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Have you ever read a biography of, say George Washington? Then read <br/>
&gt;another Washington bio by a different author. would they be <br/>
&gt;identical? no. No more than the four writers of the gospels used <br/>
&gt;identical words...different authors, different words, different <br/>
&gt;events highlighted. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;Heidi<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ren then quoted the Bible passages about Judas, showing in Acts 1, <br/>
where it says that he acquired a field with the price of his <br/>
iniquity. In fact, Ren did what I should have done: found the <br/>
passages and examined them with her own eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra then asked if an apology to the group would be forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
In my embarassment and chagrine, I did offer that apology. Once <br/>
again, &quot;speaking&quot; before thinking. Here is an amended apology:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If I have offended anyone on this list, by my embarassing attempt at <br/>
answering a critic, please accept my apology.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But may I add...if my silly reaction to the Judas question offended <br/>
this group, then this group is easily offended. <br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Heidi</div>
