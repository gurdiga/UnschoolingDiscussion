<div id="ygrps-yiv-532655978">What did I miss here?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I like Kelly&#39;s idea about a new family every week.  I&#39;m coming to the States<br/>
&gt; &gt;in March.  Think I could piece together a new family for every week until<br/>
&gt; &gt;the conference in August so I don&#39;t have to fly back until then?!?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have an apartment (separate from the house)  It isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; being used right <br/>
&gt; now.  Welcome to stay here.  <br/>
