<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049170356">At an administraive/yahoo level, we have an automatic questionnaire mailing <br/>
that goes to those who unsubscribe from the list.  We just got a response that <br/>
makes me wonder whether we need more rules!!   (I&#39;m joking, but yet again, <br/>
read this:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I haven&#39;t read any messages from the group, my mom<br/>
made me sign up for some reason and I belong to enough<br/>
groups already. see you later.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people should be on the list who don&#39;t want to be.   It&#39;s not <br/>
that kind of a list.   (ARE there those kinds of lists?  I guess online courses <br/>
for high school credit, maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
So if any of you moms have made a kid sign on this list, please reconsider <br/>
the nature of unschooling!  Kids like what they discover on their own, what they <br/>
choose on their own.    This kid was &quot;made&quot; to be on this list and so didn&#39;t <br/>
read any of the posts.<br/>
<br/>
And I have no idea whose kid it was, so nobody needs to jump up and confess.  <br/>
It&#39;s just an amusing illustration of some of the things that separate <br/>
structured learning (school at or away from home) and unschooling.<br/>
