 </span></blockquote>Casey is 8. She loves to express her opinion on anything and everything. <br/>
That&#39;s why I asked her. She&#39;s definitely the type to have come up with <br/>
something like the t-shirts about something she believes in. I guess it&#39;s <br/>
just not necessary for her to think in terms of &quot;unschooling&quot;. That&#39;s my <br/>
job. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
She loves her life, although wishes they didn&#39;t lock all the other kids up <br/>
in school every day so she could play with her schooling friends more. She <br/>
is always moving, always thinking and always doing. It&#39;s sometimes hard to <br/>
keep up, but always worth every moment.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068518071">I asked because we (our house) have two seperate reactions here.  The<br/>
younger ones (they did the t-shirts and sweatshirts) just roll their eyes.<br/>
The older kids are the ones that thought the adults should get out of the<br/>
definition business.<br/>
