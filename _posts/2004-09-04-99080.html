<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534313">My gosh I live a sheltered life. It isn&#39;t often that I am around mainstream<br/>
parents  because I choose to mostly surround myself with people who support<br/>
what I do and parent in a similar fashion.  But when I am, I am getting<br/>
worse and worse at keeping my mouth shut. &lt;grin&gt;  Today we went to a family<br/>
gathering and I tried talking with my 15 yo niece in the presence of her<br/>
mother.  (one of my sil&#39;s)  Every time I asked her a question and she<br/>
answered me, her mother corrected her and told her what she *really* thinks<br/>
or *really* likes.  She just rolled her eyes and said, &quot;o.k. mom, your<br/>
right.  that&#39;s what I think or like.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Somehow the conversation got turned to *what she wants to be when she grows<br/>
up.*  I certainly didn&#39;t steer it that way.  Heck, I still don&#39;t know what I<br/>
want to be when I grow up. &lt;BG&gt;  I said, &quot;Heck, she&#39;s got plenty of time to<br/>
figure that out.  There are so many issues to consider&quot;  and I named a few,<br/>
like cost of college, what you would like to do for work, how much money<br/>
you&#39;d like to make, availability of those jobs in the area you want to live,<br/>
what you enjoy doing, and just knowing what all your options are.  Her<br/>
mother said, &quot;Well she has to decide soon or I&#39;m not going to pay for it!&quot;<br/>
I told my niece that she can pick something and go to school on her mom&#39;s<br/>
dime and then if she decides some day that she hates what she chose she<br/>
won&#39;t be out any money and she can work at the grocery store or just pay<br/>
then to go to school for whatever she decides she loves.  Her mother pretty<br/>
much told me to shut up.  LOL! <br/>
 <br/>
Then we got onto the topic of sports and their cost.  Their children are<br/>
very involved in sports and the mom way saying that she *has* to work in<br/>
order for them to play, but she was bemoaning the fact that she works so<br/>
much and doesn&#39;t get to spend much time with her kids.   I asked her if she<br/>
thought her children would rather have her time or the money for all the<br/>
fancy sporting goods.  She said, she definitely had to work so they could<br/>
play sports (the only other option she could see was to not work and have<br/>
the kids not play sports) and she told me how they all have to have matching<br/>
warm up suits, matching expensive sneakers, matching uniforms, etc.  It<br/>
*was* a lot of money.  What ever happened to getting a pair of shorts and a<br/>
tank top that gets handed down to next years class and doesn&#39;t cost hardly<br/>
anything if you return them at the end of the season?  Why do the schools<br/>
make it cost so much to play?  Just so you all look cool?  She did say that<br/>
if some kids don&#39;t have the money, that they still get to play and that the<br/>
sneakers aren&#39;t really mandatory because a few kids do have different ones,<br/>
because the brand they picked doesn&#39;t fit them well.  Do kids need to be so<br/>
much the same that they can&#39;t have different but cool sneakers?  I was<br/>
really shocked by what appears to be mandatory to her.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am so glad that so far my kids don&#39;t want to be part of that system.  I<br/>
hope they never do.  I would hope that even if they find a team sport they<br/>
want to participate in that we can find a way to do that away from the<br/>
school system and away from mainstream parenting.  If I ever resort to<br/>
telling my kids what they think, I know they&#39;ll have the sense to slat me up<br/>
side the head, so I think I&#39;m safe.  &lt;whew! glad I taught them to think on<br/>
their own.&gt;<br/>
