Honestly, I think part of it is the puritan worth ethic stuff that says  it&#39;s <br/>
virtuous to make your own clothes and clean your own house and plant your  <br/>
own garden and not to have other people do it, and it&#39;s sinful to eat out or buy <br/>
 pre-packaged foods or not know how to change your own oil.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s fading out, but the roots run deep.   Every once in a while  they&#39;ll <br/>
interview some really old couple about what kept them married 60 years  or why <br/>
they lived so long or something, and they&#39;ll come out with some of those  <br/>
platitudes.  &quot;We only ate out once a year,&quot; or &quot;We stayed home and tended  our own <br/>
garden and minded our own business&quot; kinds of things.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of you (maybe all of you) know this, but it&#39;s one of my favorite  <br/>
stories about human nature (or maybe just the nature of twitchy American  women).  <br/>
In the late 50&#39;s, early 60&#39;s (I(I think back into the  50&#39;s) when they first <br/>
had the ability to package complete pancake mix, or  cake mix, or dry biscuit <br/>
mix, so that there were dried eggs and dried milk and  encapsulated oil, it just <br/>
wasn&#39;t selling at the store.   People were  cooking from scratch rather than <br/>
get that stuff.  They did market research,  when &quot;market research&quot; and applied <br/>
psychology were still very new (and not much  respected) fields, and <br/>
discovered something SO IMPORTANT that it gave a big  boost to applied psychology as a <br/>
legitimate field.  <br/>
 <br/>
Women felt guilty, like they weren&#39;t really cooking.<br/>
 <br/>
So they made the mixes need things they didn&#39;t really need.  They took  OUT <br/>
some of the ingredients, and once people had to add three things, they DID  <br/>
feel like they were cooking.  So to this day, cake mixes make you add your  own <br/>
eggs and oil, not because the technology requires it, but because those sell  <br/>
way better.  (And not any cheaper. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
There are still mixes for corn bread that only need water, and pancakes  that <br/>
only need water.  Maybe a few other things.  But I think men buy  them.  :-)<br/>
Not moms, who have a moral duty to cook.<br/>
And sew.<br/>

There are Krusteaz muffin mixes that don&#39;t require adding an egg.  When I had an infant in one arm all the time, I made these.  (My one-handed egg cracking skills have since improved, but back then the simplicity was a big help.)<br/>

I have to comment on this. I totally agree that we need to eradicate the guilt we may feel for not living up to some false societal standard of womanhood. BUT there are very relevent contemporary reasons to develop homemaking type skills, going way back even before the 50s (try the 1850s) - growing and preserving our own food, saving rainwater, making clothes, fixing machines, home remedies... <br/>
<br/>
I think our whole economy is heading way down in the near future due to the end of cheap oil, global warming, endless war bankrupting the system etc. Among other things, there will probably be a massive re-localizing of resources because peaches from Chile and sneakers from Indonesia are going to be too expensive to ship here. Our own homeschooling includes a lot of skill building in homemaking/homesteading type skills. Or let me rephrase that by saying, I feel the need to learn this stuff and my family sometimes joins me. We&#39;ve done wild food gathering, pickling, alternative building techniques like cob and super adobe, rainwater collection, wool spinning...<br/>
<br/>
Forget about adding one egg or not to the mix, can you feed your family if the Vons shelves are empty?<br/>
<br/>
I know I may sound like a survivalist, I&#39;m not, in the militerized-super patriot-crazy kind of way. But I do want to prepare my family for the likely lifestyle changes of the future. I&#39;m not trying to make anyone feel guilty, but read one or more of these articles and see if you might want to rethink the pre-packaged foods habit and inability to change your oil.<br/>

that they aren&#39;t in grad school, buying a bigger house, having more  money, <br/>
getting a new car, nicer cellphone, better sports shoes, nicer seats at  the <br/>
basketball game.<br/>
 <br/>
I can sew well. <br/>
We collect rainwater.<br/>
I have grown vegetables, but it&#39;s not practical without irrigation  here.  <br/>
It&#39;s cheaper and more responsible to buy stuff from irrigated fields  (or places <br/>
where it rains) than to pay for pumped-up water.  <br/>
 <br/>
-=-I think our whole economy is heading way down in the near future due to  <br/>
the end of cheap oil, global warming, endless war bankrupting the system  etc-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Everything is headed up or down.  Change is constant.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Forget about adding one egg or not to the mix, can you feed your family  <br/>
if the Vons shelves are empty?-=-<br/>
 <br/>
There are entire regions of the world which become unliveable entirely if  <br/>
there is no mass transport of food and supplies, starting with Chicago which (I  <br/>
understand) did not start as a farming town, but a rail town.  There are  <br/>
LOTS and lots of rail towns.  There are millions of people living in  mountains <br/>
and deserts in which no one has ever or could possibly grow enough  food even <br/>
for a single family.  They would have to move nearer to  rivers.<br/>
 <br/>
-=But I do want to prepare my family for the likely lifestyle changes of  the <br/>
future. I&#39;m not trying to make anyone feel guilty, but read one or more of  <br/>
these articles and see if you might want to rethink the pre-packaged foods <br/>
habit  and inability to change your oil.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
My husband changes our oil and I don&#39;t have a pre-packaged food  habit.  When <br/>
my mother-in-law stayed here unexpectedly once (Holly and I  were in England <br/>
and my inlaws showed up to stay five days--NOT very nice) one of  the things <br/>
she snorted behind my back about was that I didn&#39;t have any pancake  mix.   <br/>
Well I don&#39;t USE pancake mix.  I have three favorite  from-scratch recipes for <br/>
pancakes, and no one thought to tell her that.   They just went and bought her <br/>
some pancake mix so she could think I was a crummy  housewife. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
If it makes you feel better to think the end is near, you&#39;re not  alone.  <br/>
LOTS of people enjoy the adrenaline of fear and  emergency.   In the 60&#39;s we were <br/>
assured that the planet could not  POSSIBLY sustain the growing population <br/>
and that by the 21st century we&#39;d be  surviving on pills and rooftop gardens <br/>
guarded 24 hours a day.   Some  people lost a LOT of sleep and wore out their <br/>
systems with a lot of worry about  that KNOWLEDGE, certain and sure conviction, <br/>
that the end was  near.    The end has been near for at least 2000 years in  <br/>
Christian, and it creates just more and more guilt and shame. And many of them  <br/>
WANT the world to end.  They fervently desire for Jesus to come and take  them <br/>
out of the world NOW.  Today.  Any minute.   Same kind  of emotional charge, <br/>
thinking that something WE do can affect the whole planet  right NOW.  Today.  <br/>
Any minute.  <br/>
 <br/>
That kind of internal turmoil and agitation is not healthy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833983384">Simon and Linnaea both love to gather food.  Not because they have any<br/>
fear about food being available in some dystopian future, but because<br/>
it&#39;s fun to go on a walk in the woods and gather wild garlic or to<br/>
find the fennel and apple mint growing at the local wildfowl trust and<br/>
to make tea or salad from what they found. Fear isn&#39;t a great guide to<br/>
leading you or your family to exciting places.  It makes exploring<br/>

<br/>
I completely agree. Though there is a gray area when it comes to stuff like<br/>
chocolate harvested by child slave labor in Sierra Leone, or sweatshop made<br/>
clothing. I don&#39;t hold with the concept of sin but I think awareness is very<br/>
important. Though one can never be totally PC, I think we should develop<br/>
conscousness about where the stuff we buy comes from, what labor practices<br/>
were involved in creating it, and what environmental impact it&#39;s production<br/>
and distribution have.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Americans are so awash in guilt and  shame<br/>
that they think it&#39;s the way life is everywhere, but there are places  where<br/>

<br/>
I completely agree. A life focused on consumption is one that offers little<br/>
deep contentment. There&#39;s always more money to be made to buy more stuff so<br/>
you can never stop and smell the roses.<br/>
Examining the roots of our personal guilt and shame - or the need for any<br/>
self reflection at all - is also rarely acknowledged by our society and<br/>
education system.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If it makes you feel better to think the end is near, you&#39;re not  alone.<br/>
LOTS of people enjoy the adrenaline of fear and  emergency.   In the 60&#39;s we<br/>

Today.<br/>
Any minute.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am aware that there&#39;s a &quot;rush&quot; to my feeling of emergency. I try not to<br/>
get hooked on it or make descisons based in it. I struggle to operate, not<br/>
out of fear but out of love and practicality. I often think of the 20/20<br/>
hindsight of people who lived through somewhat predictable disasters - the<br/>
depression, the holocaust. I&#39;m sure they all had ideas about how they could<br/>
have been better prepared. You can be sure that the CEOs of the oil<br/>
companies are planning right now for the end of cheap oil. The robber barons<br/>
always look ahead to how they can profit from other&#39;s misfortune.<br/>

Unfortunately, this happened in 2003, and will not happen this year.<br/>
See  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/science/mars.asp">http://www.snopes.com/science/mars.asp</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, it happens every 15-17 years, so will happen again in our<br/>
lifetimes, so if you missed it then, you can catch the re-runs in 2018 :-)<br/>

&lt;&lt;Honestly, I think part of it is the puritan worth ethic stuff that says<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
virtuous to make your own clothes and clean your own house and plant your<br/>
own garden and not to have other people do it, and it&#39;s sinful to eat out or<br/>
buy<br/>
 pre-packaged foods or not know how to change your own oil.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to comment on this. I totally agree that we need to eradicate the<br/>
guilt we may feel for not living up to some false societal standard of<br/>
womanhood. BUT there are very relevent contemporary reasons to develop<br/>
homemaking type skills, going way back even before the 50s (try the 1850s) -<br/>
growing and preserving our own food, saving rainwater, making clothes,<br/>
fixing machines, home remedies...<br/>
<br/>
I think our whole economy is heading way down in the near future due to the<br/>
end of cheap oil, global warming, endless war bankrupting the system etc.<br/>
Among other things, there will probably be a massive re-localizing of<br/>
resources because peaches from Chile and sneakers from Indonesia are going<br/>
to be too expensive to ship here. Our own homeschooling includes a lot of<br/>
skill building in homemaking/homesteading type skills. Or let me rephrase<br/>
that by saying, I feel the need to learn this stuff and my family sometimes<br/>
joins me. We&#39;ve done wild food gathering, pickling, alternative building<br/>
techniques like cob and super adobe, rainwater collection, wool spinning...<br/>
<br/>
Forget about adding one egg or not to the mix, can you feed your family if<br/>
the Vons shelves are empty?<br/>
<br/>
I know I may sound like a survivalist, I&#39;m not, in the militerized-super<br/>
patriot-crazy kind of way. But I do want to prepare my family for the likely<br/>
lifestyle changes of the future. I&#39;m not trying to make anyone feel guilty,<br/>
but read one or more of these articles and see if you might want to rethink<br/>
the pre-packaged foods habit and inability to change your oil.<br/>

<br/>
Sure there are.<br/>
But the idea that it&#39;s sin to benefit from the labors of others is not a<br/>
good relevant contemporary reasons.  Americans are so awash in guilt and<br/>
shame<br/>
that they think it&#39;s the way life is everywhere, but there are places  where<br/>
people live WAY more happily and more simply than we do without feeling<br/>
guilty<br/>

getting a new car, nicer cellphone, better sports shoes, nicer seats at  the<br/>
basketball game.<br/>
<br/>
I can sew well.<br/>
We collect rainwater.<br/>
I have grown vegetables, but it&#39;s not practical without irrigation  here.<br/>
It&#39;s cheaper and more responsible to buy stuff from irrigated fields  (or<br/>
places<br/>
where it rains) than to pay for pumped-up water.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think our whole economy is heading way down in the near future due to<br/>

Everything is headed up or down.  Change is constant.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are entire regions of the world which become unliveable entirely if<br/>
there is no mass transport of food and supplies, starting with Chicago which<br/>
(I<br/>
understand) did not start as a farming town, but a rail town.  There are<br/>
LOTS and lots of rail towns.  There are millions of people living in<br/>
mountains<br/>
and deserts in which no one has ever or could possibly grow enough  food<br/>
even<br/>
for a single family.  They would have to move nearer to  rivers.<br/>
<br/>

habit  and inability to change your oil.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband changes our oil and I don&#39;t have a pre-packaged food  habit.<br/>
When<br/>
my mother-in-law stayed here unexpectedly once (Holly and I  were in England<br/>
and my inlaws showed up to stay five days--NOT very nice) one of  the things<br/>
she snorted behind my back about was that I didn&#39;t have any pancake  mix.<br/>
Well I don&#39;t USE pancake mix.  I have three favorite  from-scratch recipes<br/>
for<br/>
pancakes, and no one thought to tell her that.   They just went and bought<br/>
her<br/>
some pancake mix so she could think I was a crummy  housewife. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel better to think the end is near, you&#39;re not  alone.<br/>
LOTS of people enjoy the adrenaline of fear and  emergency.   In the 60&#39;s we<br/>
were<br/>
assured that the planet could not  POSSIBLY sustain the growing population<br/>
and that by the 21st century we&#39;d be  surviving on pills and rooftop gardens<br/>
guarded 24 hours a day.   Some  people lost a LOT of sleep and wore out<br/>
their<br/>
systems with a lot of worry about  that KNOWLEDGE, certain and sure<br/>
conviction,<br/>
that the end was  near.    The end has been near for at least 2000 years in<br/>
Christian, and it creates just more and more guilt and shame. And many of<br/>
them<br/>
WANT the world to end.  They fervently desire for Jesus to come and take<br/>
them<br/>
out of the world NOW.  Today.  Any minute.   Same kind  of emotional charge,<br/>
thinking that something WE do can affect the whole planet  right NOW.<br/>
Today.<br/>
Any minute.<br/>
<br/>
That kind of internal turmoil and agitation is not healthy.<br/>

Oh, you&#39;re not alone Ann! I need my coffee in the morning and my diet cola<br/>

with a horrible reaction (bright red skin and itchy, swelling and difficulty<br/>

never drank much...probably less than once a week....the reaction gradually<br/>
grew worse over the years until I had a very scary New Years after one small<br/>
glass of Champagne a few years back.  Anyone ever hear of such a reaction?<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to look it up and I can&#39;t seem to get much. The &#39;experts&#39; say<br/>

I have contemplated creating a blog just to chronicle my search for a good<br/>
cup of coffee in Kansas City... just not happening. The people I work with<br/>
laugh at me and the coffee thing, but they drink the brown water from the<br/>
dining room. I need my coffee... I miss Peet&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I also carry Fioricet for mihgraines and take them whenever my head starts<br/>
to hurt - I&#39;d rather treat something that would have gone away by itself<br/>
than risk a full-blown migraine - and I encourage my daughter to take<br/>
pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine for a stuffy nose or allergy symptoms<br/>

Simon and Linnaea both love to gather food.  Not because they have any<br/>
fear about food being available in some dystopian future, but because<br/>
it&#39;s fun to go on a walk in the woods and gather wild garlic or to<br/>
find the fennel and apple mint growing at the local wildfowl trust and<br/>
to make tea or salad from what they found. Fear isn&#39;t a great guide to<br/>
leading you or your family to exciting places.  It makes exploring<br/>
more frantic, more desperate than getting a book on bushcraft and<br/>
going camping and seeing if you can light a fire without any matches<br/>
&#39;cause it&#39;s fun ever will.<br/>

to the end of cheap oil, global warming, endless war bankrupting the<br/>

re-localizing of resources because peaches from Chile and sneakers<br/>
from Indonesia are going to be too expensive to ship here. Our own<br/>
homeschooling includes a lot of skill building in<br/>
homemaking/homesteading type skills. Or let me rephrase that by<br/>
saying, I feel the need to learn this stuff and my family sometimes<br/>

the reaction gradually grew worse over the years until I had a very scary<br/>
New Years after one small glass of Champagne a few years back.  Anyone ever<br/>
hear of such a reaction? I&#39;ve tried to look it up and I can&#39;t seem to get<br/>
much. The &#39;experts&#39; say there isn&#39;t an allergy to alcohol and it doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem matter what kind it is...<br/>

My husband Gary is allergic to alcohol, so we avoid nyquil (or any medicine<br/>
containing alcohol) and he&#39;s not had a drink of alcohol since his teens,<br/>
when he discovered wine caused a reaction.  In his case, it results in<br/>
asthma-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, his throat swells and he feels<br/>
nauseous.  He also has the same allergic reaction to bananas (tho he can eat<br/>
banana muffins/bread) and all melons.  I suspect it&#39;s something to do with<br/>
the molds or fermentation process.<br/>

I like to cut them in chunks, toss with good oil, maybe a bit of salt or<br/>

I should know better than to forward along info I haven&#39;t checked.<br/>
<br/>
The message about Mars was true, but as it turns out, it&#39;s also old news by<br/>
about two years.<br/>
<br/>
The chance of a lifetime to see Mars close up WAS true, back in  August of<br/>
2003.  My apologies for telling you it would be *this* August.<br/>
<br/>
Bleahhh...<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, there are other things to learn about in the skies for your<br/>
kids this summer, and of course telescopes are still a great educational<br/>
tool.<br/>
<br/>
skypub.com and astronomy.com both have lots of great announcements and<br/>

They have stores/cafes, too. They started in Berkeley but there are lots of<br/>
stores now, I think throughout California and maybe up to Washington and<br/>
Oregon, too.<br/>
<br/>
I like the French Roast, but the house blend isn&#39;t bad either. It&#39;s very<br/>
strong, dark, full-bodied coffee, so if you like the lighter stuff you may<br/>
not go for it.<br/>

Thanks for the extra insight!  We&#39;re pretty lucky to<br/>
have a university observatory nearby and they love to<br/>
have people come out and peek and learn.  We&#39;ll take<br/>
advantage and pick their brains when October rolls<br/>
around!<br/>

&gt; Unfortunately, the original message is simply in<br/>
&gt; error.  This *October*,<br/>
&gt; Mars will reach opposition with the Earth, and while<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a good apparition,<br/>
&gt; August 2003 was quite a bit closer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And, to give you an idea of what all of this means<br/>
&gt; in terms of observing<br/>
&gt; Mars, I pushed my telescope with a 16&quot; (40 cm) wide<br/>
&gt; mirror to several<br/>
&gt; hundred power (I don&#39;t have my logs in front of me,<br/>
&gt; so I&#39;m not sure what the<br/>
&gt; exact power was), under PERFECT conditions, and I<br/>
&gt; was able to discern a few<br/>
&gt; of the most prominent of Mars&#39; features.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bear in mind, too, that observational astronomy is<br/>
&gt; very much a learned skill<br/>
&gt; -- so where I could pick out features on Mars, a<br/>
&gt; novice stepping to the<br/>
&gt; eyepiece for the first time might have seen little<br/>
&gt; more than a smeary orange<br/>
&gt; disk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t say this to discourage folks from observing<br/>
&gt; Mars this fall -- but I<br/>
&gt; always hate to see people terribly disappointed when<br/>
&gt; they are pumped up by<br/>
&gt; claims such as these, only to learn that, as is so<br/>
&gt; often the case, there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; no easy shortcut to the most rewarding of<br/>
&gt; experiences.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The availability of Hubble and other very<br/>
&gt; high-quality images of a wide<br/>
&gt; variety of astronomical objects has made it all too<br/>
&gt; common for a first-time<br/>
&gt; observer to expect to see what they&#39;ve found in<br/>
&gt; books and magazines.  You&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; see many beautiful things through a telescope, and<br/>
&gt; many will become only<br/>
&gt; more beautiful as your skills improve, but you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; rarely get views that<br/>
&gt; compare to the photographs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps -- and please feel free to ask me<br/>
&gt; any questions that may<br/>
&gt; come up about astronomical matters; I relish the<br/>
&gt; experience of seeing people<br/>
&gt; come to understand just how incredibly grand our<br/>
&gt; universe is, and how much<br/>
&gt; they can learn about it with their own eyes.<br/>

My personal cure for most illness is Celestial<br/>
Seasonings Lemon Zinger Tea (NFI) and Matlock (also<br/>
NFI).  With enough cable/satellite channels, you can<br/>
watch Matlock for at least 8 hours straight.  I have<br/>
always found that I am eager to get back to life after<br/>
a Matlock marathon :)<br/>
<br/>
When allergies get to Ellis, I give him OTC<br/>
Benadryl-like stuff at about 1/2 the recommended<br/>
dosage.  Relieves his symptoms but doesn&#39;t make him<br/>
foggy so he can still enjoy his day!<br/>
<br/>
The spouse?  His preferred cure is to lie in bed<br/>
moaning, allowing me to bring him tea, soup, water and<br/>
whatever he can imagine (as long as I use a mix!)<br/>

<br/>
With medication for ills, as with most stuff, we&#39;re firmly in<br/>
the &quot;whatever works, works&quot; camp. We&#39;ve all found some OTC stuff<br/>
that works on some things and some homeopathics (and mixed remedies<br/>
which are sort of frowned on by some) that work for other things.<br/>
The Chestal cough stuff (the kid kind in a honey base) is just<br/>
wonderful - we all like it. I know many homepathic remedies would be<br/>
difficult for some since they often (generally?) have an alcohol<br/>
base. DS (Just turned 7) know which stuff he wants, and when and how<br/>
much he should take. He is probably the last one to take anything<br/>
since his preferred remedy for most anything is chicken noodle soup<br/>
and a long nap in our bed with the remote handy if he wants to watch<br/>
TV. I was quite happy to find the homeopathic head cold blend remedy<br/>
because most medications (even plain old Tylenol) tend to make me<br/>
sleepy - even the non-drowsy stuff! (Of course, more than 2 cups of<br/>
anything caffeinated will do the same thing or one strong glass of<br/>
wine). So, to find something that clears the symptoms AND allows me<br/>
to not burn all my sick days at work is a wonderful thing. DH,<br/>
however, he&#39;ll pretty much just &quot;tough it out&quot; until either he can&#39;t<br/>
take it anymore OR until *I* can&#39;t take him being sick anymore and<br/>
twist his arm (when he&#39;s on his 4th or 5th day of moaning and<br/>
groaning I admit I can be a pest!).<br/>

We live in Central Oregon and Peet&#39;s hasn&#39;t come here yet, but they are in<br/>
Portland and maybe other areas on the west side of the mountains.  My<br/>
favorite is the Decaf Special Blend.  We have an espresso maker that my dh<br/>
inherited from his company and I never really liked the coffee it made until<br/>
I tried Peet&#39;s.  It converted me from a morning tea drinker to a morning<br/>
coffee drinker.  I still take my tea in the afternoon though!<br/>
<br/>
There was just an article in our paper this morning about Peet&#39;s as compared<br/>
to Starbucks and how it&#39;s a much (!) smaller company.  Peet&#39;s also gets a<br/>
much higher percentage of their revenue from selling beans vs. Starbuck&#39;s<br/>
which gets the majority from selling drinks in the store.<br/>

They have stores/cafes, too. They started in Berkeley but there are lots of<br/>
stores now, I think throughout California and maybe up to Washington and<br/>
Oregon, too.<br/>
<br/>
I like the French Roast, but the house blend isn&#39;t bad either. It&#39;s very<br/>
strong, dark, full-bodied coffee, so if you like the lighter stuff you may<br/>
not go for it.<br/>

the table reading a magazine article. Now, due to the hip damage, he <br/>
sits with one leg at an odd angle. Often, his leg will fall asleep <br/>
from that. Well, lense arrives, sunlight streaming through window. <br/>
Assorted paper at hand. Cool. Should have plenty of time to get to <br/>
sink when it starts to smolder. Right? Wrong!lol. The paper stuff <br/>
caught right to flame in a very short time AND DH&#39;s leg had gone to <br/>
sleep. So, he&#39;s got flaming paper stuff in one hand and is trying to <br/>
dash across the kitchen to the sink with one semi-numbed leg. Wish I <br/>
had seen it!lol (no damage to kitchen or DH BTW) They quickly <br/>
decided to move their experiments out to the center of the back yard <br/>
(which is mostly dirt).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125808393">I have a flint and steel kit with the baked-linen starter stuff.  I  keep <br/>
thinking I&#39;ll show Marty how to use it and give it to him, because of his  <br/>
interest in the 19th century and his liklihood to keep it for life without  losing <br/>
it.<br/>
 <br/>
I have it from a woman who made it, who had researched lighting fires  <br/>
through the ages and had written an article about it that needed a lot of  editing.  <br/>
She asked me to edit.  I said I would advise her about  making it what would <br/>
succeed and be the most useful (she wanted to put it in the  SCA&#39;s quarterly <br/>
journal, Tournaments Illuminated.   <br/>
 <br/>
I spent a couple of hours with her after I&#39;d read it and marked comments  and <br/>
I was recommending (VERY enthusiastically, because it was fun information)  <br/>
that she lean toward the reader, rather than toward the readings she had done,  <br/>
because at this point she was expert in the subject and could write with her <br/>
own  voice without quoting others at such length, and write it in a way that  <br/>
encouraged them to believe they could start fires without matches or lighters, <br/>
 that THEY could use historical-style kindling and materials.   <br/>
 <br/>
Well... <br/>
In a big move that reinforced my already-growing prejudice against stuffy  <br/>
cob-up-butt academics, her husband came home from working at his PhD job and  <br/>
reminded her she had a master&#39;s degree and should do this as she would a  <br/>
dissertation, and rewrote it with her or for her to the point that I couldn&#39;t  even <br/>
WANT to read it, and I&#39;d bet $100 that the first version would have had a  <br/>
hundred people strike their own sparks literally and a thousand more spark up  <br/>
figuratively, but that the published version resulted in two fires, a little  <br/>
smoke, and a lot of wasted paper.  Her name would have been on people&#39;s  lips <br/>
with the first writing.  With the second, nothing to talk about.  <br/>
 <br/>
Scholarly references, avoidance of contractions, stilted language and  quotes <br/>
in Latin don&#39;t move people to go out and chop wood and make fire.   People <br/>
accuse the SCA of being too much fantasy, but we wear REAL clothes, not  just <br/>
write about them; we make real food, not just redact a few recipes for  inedible <br/>
college credit.   Academia can be QUITE a fantasy world from  which some <br/>
people never emerge, which some people imagine to be the real world,  and for <br/>
which compulsory education is their bootcamp.  That a  few die of hazing and most <br/>
are weeded out and sent home in shame as  failures is justified because after <br/>
13 years (THIRTEEN YEARS) of such boot camp,  the academics have identified <br/>
their scholarship candidates.  The rest  failed.  <br/>

A couple months ago on NPR, I heard a historian who has been writing popular biography (I think Joseph Ellis) talk about the fact that now some serious historians are writing good biographies designed to reach a wide audience, instead of pompous tomes to impress and stultify their academic peers.  There&#39;s certainly been an outpouring recently of thick but readable books about the Founding Fathers, and Lewis and Clark and the Roosevelts.

<br/>
I understand that in the past knowledge was a commodity closely guarded by the local priests and not much shared.  But it&#39;s kind of sad that there are professors who would prefer that the information they write about stay shrouded in mystery, even after they write it down.  Arggghhh.<br/>

crossed the river to Missouri fairly often.  The flood<br/>
in 1993 was mind-boggling.  To see the exact spot<br/>
where I stood for Hands Across America under 12 feet<br/>
of water was a real shock to the system.  There was a<br/>
two-story building with water almost to the roof.  I<br/>
don&#39;t have words to describe it.  These were places I<br/>
passed often.  Suddenly, it wasn&#39;t farmland and small<br/>
towns.  It was a liquid moonscape.<br/>
<br/>
Even after the main floodwater receded, there was at<br/>
least six inches on the highway in many places and<br/>
water lapping at the edges of the raised roadbeds<br/>
where a shoulder might have been at one time.  The<br/>
levees that crammed a six-mile wide river into a<br/>
mile-wide channel only served to keep the water from<br/>
finding its way back to the riverbed.<br/>
<br/>
I probably don&#39;t know enough about all that the ACofE<br/>
has done but their record doesn&#39;t appear to be good<br/>
when it comes to working with nature.  Their modus<br/>
operandi seems to be &#39;force it&#39; - which seems like a<br/>
losing proposition when the &quot;opponent&quot; has been<br/>
operating this planet for a few million years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m reading &quot;When the Mississippi Ran Backwards&quot; out loud to my husband<br/>
(and ds if he feels like it) and we are really enjoying it. Its about<br/>
the New Madrid earthquake and the what was going on in America at the<br/>
time. Its written really well and is easy to read aloud.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And for folks unfamiliar with the area---they tawk funny up there!<br/>
<br/>
New Madrid is pronounced New MA-drid.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also  New BER-lin, Cairo (KAY-ro), and a few others.<br/>

New  Madrid is pronounced New MA-drid.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Madrid, New Mexico is &quot;MA-drid&quot; too.  <br/>
It was a ghost town from the 40&#39;s to the 70&#39;s, and when it stirred back up,  <br/>
old folks had to keep correcting younger ones to name it its name, not to just <br/>
 read the sign.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800463432">Oops!  I got my RAHs and my RAYs mixed up :)  It&#39;s<br/>
RAY, not RAH and more of a vur than a vuh.  Although,<br/>
I suppose technically it would be<br/>
&#39;el-be(yh)-hrra-do(h)&#39; according to my very little bit<br/>
of Spanish.  Which is almost as good as my little bit<br/>
of phonetics!<br/>
