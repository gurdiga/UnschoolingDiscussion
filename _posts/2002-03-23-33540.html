<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286610502"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;My dad died while I was away on vacation.  Seven years later an uncle died <br/>
&gt;&gt;in a woodcutting accident out in the woods hundreds of miles from home, <br/>
&gt;&gt;but his daughter was with him when he died.  What she described seemed <br/>
&gt;&gt;like a horrifying experience, yet I envied her.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can understand this feeling. Anyone who knows me, even virtually, knows <br/>
that I lost two brothers within two years of each other. Each death had a <br/>
profound impact on me and taught me so much about living, dying and grief.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to be with my brother Marty when he died. For me, it is as <br/>
profound and life altering to help a life leave this existence as it is to <br/>
help one enter it.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too,  Mary.   This was brought &#39;home&#39; to me especially when I worked for<br/>
a hospice.  Dusing that time I became pregnant and gave birth to 2nd dd,<br/>
Abby.   They say (whoever &#39;they&#39; are ;-) )<br/>
that the angels of birth and death are of the same ilk....angels of<br/>
transition.  I had been reading and studying about angels much during that<br/>
period......and at Abby&#39;s birth,  I had a deep sense that the room was quite<br/>
crowded with angels.<br/>
