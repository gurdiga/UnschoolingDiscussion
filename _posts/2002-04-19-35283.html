<div id="ygrps-yiv-694816355">I remember reading this article a couple of years ago, but could never<br/>
remember where I had originally seen it when I tried to tell other people<br/>
about it. It is now available on-line (originally was in BusinessWeek) and<br/>
somebody recently posted the URL on our message board, so I thought I would<br/>
share it. It is an excellent example of unschooling and how curiosity can<br/>
motivate surprising learning. I especially like the quote &quot;I contend that by<br/>
the time we are 16, we are taught to want teachers, taught that we cannot<br/>
learn anything without teachers.&quot; You can read the article for yourself at:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776684895">HI--<br/>
<br/>
I am new to the list but not to unschooling. We live in Mass, and my <br/>
husband and I have 3 kids who have never been to school. Dd 16, dd 14 <br/>
and a ds 10. <br/>
<br/>
I have a legalities question, and if this is not a good forum for <br/>
this question, please let me know. Has anyone had exp with reporting <br/>
difficulties in Mass? Superintendents being hard to get along with, <br/>
asking for testing, truancy issues, etc? I know Mass is one of the <br/>
strictest states in the US to homeschool in, never mind unschool, <br/>
with our free flowing, real life exps type curriculum. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone needed help from a lawyer? Did the Homeschool Legal <br/>
Defense Assoc ever step in and advocate for anyone? If so, did anyone <br/>
find a good Mass lawyer that could advise on legalities, penalties, <br/>
etc? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking through the archives and see that most of the posts <br/>
seem to be on philosophy of unschooling. So I don&#39;t know if this <br/>
question is within the usual bounds of this list, but just thought I <br/>
would try. if there is a better place to get answers, please advise!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance---Daryl</div>

interpretted properly! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The best place to get your Mass questions answered is the Massachusetts Home<br/>
Learners Association website and email lists. They have a good discussion of<br/>
the law on the website and good people to answer questions on the email<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mhla.org">http://www.mhla.org</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:masshomelearningassoc-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">masshomelearningassoc-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:MAhomeschoolers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">MAhomeschoolers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
(One is more for legal discussion and one for more general homeschooling<br/>
discussion and I forget which is which. But you can ask any question on<br/>
either -- or go to the website and read the descriptions of the lists!)<br/>
<br/>
I use Carol Narigon&#39;s letter, which Sandra Dodd helpfully makes available at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum.html</a><br/>
<br/>
As for HSLDA, the general feeling outside fundamentalist Christian<br/>
school-at-home circles is that they are more harmful than helpful. You can<br/>
read more about them at More Inforation on HSLDA<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/page/folchslda)">http://expage.com/page/folchslda)</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* there was a lawyer or two listed at the MHLA website, but if not,<br/>
the MHLA list might be a good place to ask. But you shouldn&#39;t need one. If<br/>
you send in your letter of intent and a plan that they can&#39;t prove to be<br/>
ineffective and you can come to some agreement on assessment (it says the<br/>
form of assessment must be approved by the parents) then there&#39;s no reason<br/>
to have problems. If a superintendent is asking for more than allowed, it<br/>
helps to quote relevant passages from the case laws in your reply to them.<br/>
(Generally they are speaking from their assumption of how laws should work<br/>
or are counting on your ignorance.) There&#39;s also a &quot;For Superintendent&#39;s&quot;<br/>
page at HMLA&#39;s website that you can send to him.<br/>

Much thanks to Joyce for the webpages for info and to Kris for the <br/>

In case you wondered why i wrote my intro and questions twice, I <br/>
found the first one didn&#39;t post for several days, so I sent another, <br/>
and then of course, saw the first one finally sent. Good ol&#39; Yahoo!<br/>
