<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779915912"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I guess my think ing is this . . .<br/>
&gt;&gt; I know lots of assicts and alcoholics.  Theya ll seem to fall into<br/>
&gt;&gt; two categories . . . those who came from poor innercity places where<br/>
&gt;&gt; drinking and drugs were an escape of sorts and a way to cope the<br/>
&gt;&gt; otehr type are those who come from mid to upper-class homes where<br/>
&gt;&gt; they were expected to be exactly what the parents wanted or the<br/>
&gt;&gt; parents were very authoritarian or who were never shown love, only<br/>
&gt;&gt; given stuff and money.<br/>
&gt;&gt; But I can&#39;t think of a simgle person who had parents who were<br/>
&gt;&gt; interrested in them but not in a controlling way who went on to have<br/>
&gt;&gt; these problems.<br/>
&gt;&gt; But I can only say that in anecdotal at best and can&#39;t be used as a<br/>
&gt;&gt; complete model of reality.  It is truly just what I see around me and<br/>
&gt;&gt; have experienced in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know from having relatives in the suburbs of NYC (Long Island mostly) that a lot of the upper middle class children are bored out of their mind and turn to substance abuse, peer abuse and other destructive behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure its also a lot of pent up anger turned inward or outward to lack of and/or controlling parental involvement.<br/>
<br/>
As far as people from dysfunctional families... I also observed that more of them have it together than the ones that APPEAR functional.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385452828">All I could find was a study indicating that mothers who abuse substnces<br/>
(alcohol/drugs) are more punitive in their discipline.<br/>
<br/>
My guess would be that the ones in &quot;strict&quot; (i.e., controlling) homes would<br/>
tend to rebel more strongly..... since their natural tendencies to assert<br/>
individuality were likely squelched.  But rebellion can take many forms.  I<br/>
wonder if many youngsters wandering into the oath of drug and alcohol abuse<br/>
do it more as a coping response to pain and lonliness in their lives.<br/>

&gt; I tried to do that once when dd wanted a kitten.  I went to the spca.<br/>
&gt; What an organization!  I would never donate to them or visit them<br/>
&gt; again.  You can&#39;t own a pet from there, you &quot;borrow&quot; their pet.  You<br/>
&gt; sign a form stating that the pet will be neutered within a certain<br/>
&gt; period of time or the cat will be taken back, that the pet will<br/>
&gt; receive all of its vaccines and the cat will be given an implant that<br/>
&gt; will allow it to be tracked.  And they wonder why people don&#39;t adopt<br/>
&gt; their pets!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Best thing you could  do is adopt a dog off &quot;death row&quot; or from a no<br/>
&gt; kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; shelter and give it a chance to have love!  Working for a shelter, I<br/>
&gt; see so<br/>
&gt; &gt; many wonderful dogs come through here.  So many of them get passed<br/>
&gt; over due<br/>
&gt; &gt; to not being a pure bred dog or that is all the people want...but at<br/>
&gt; least<br/>
&gt; &gt; they have food, shelter and someone who cares here...<br/>

&gt; We celebrate Christmas in the &quot;traditional&quot; way--Christmas tree,<br/>
&gt; cookies, presents, Christmas crafts, stories, movies, stringing<br/>
&gt; popcorn, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This year we&#39;re also celebrating Hanukkah.  We got a menorrah, made<br/>
&gt; latkes and applesauce, watched the animated hero classics video about<br/>
&gt; Macabees, and plan on making a dreidel tomorrow.  We&#39;ve been learning<br/>
&gt; about the Messianic significance of some of the old test. holidays.<br/>
&gt; It was during Hanukkah that Jesus stood up in the temple and declared<br/>
&gt; Himself to be the Light of the world!  Jesus was also probably<br/>
&gt; conceived on Hanukkah (and probably NOT born in December!)<br/>

&gt; Ok, let me see if I can explain some of this while fixing dinner LOL...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You have to sign a form from any organization stating that you are<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a pet...this is for their records and for the state which does check these<br/>
&gt; out if there is a problem.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; unwanted animals down so this has to be enforced or well, one cat has 3-8<br/>
&gt; kittens and 6 months later there are say 3 more cats pregnant from that<br/>
&gt; litter and so on...also, this is state mandated as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Shots are also a requirement for the health of an animal but truthfully,<br/>
&gt; the shelters are too busy to check into it and see.  They would spend<br/>
 </span></blockquote>99.9%<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of their time on the phone to different vets trying to do this and some<br/>
&gt; people do them on their own...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The implant is for YOUR protection, not to track the animal in the manner<br/>
&gt; in which I think you mean.  If the dog/cat ever got away from you, there<br/>
&gt; would be a way to get it back to you.  We honestly wish more people had<br/>
&gt; them when we find their animals...I have seen many kids in tears when the<br/>
&gt; family pet disappeared or took a dog on vacation and it happened to break<br/>
&gt; off its leash or slipped its collar and was gone in a flash.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of what they do on applications/contracts is to make people realize<br/>
&gt; the importance that their pet carries.  They are trying to make people<br/>
&gt; responsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If<br/>
&gt; people got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real need<br/>
&gt; for rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they<br/>
&gt; regulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if not<br/>
&gt; spay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you could be<br/>
&gt; fined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have already<br/>
&gt; been through a lot in their life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470322146">I guess my think ing is this . . .<br/>
I know lots of assicts and alcoholics.  Theya ll seem to fall into <br/>
two categories . . . those who came from poor innercity places where <br/>
drinking and drugs were an escape of sorts and a way to cope the <br/>
otehr type are those who come from mid to upper-class homes where <br/>
they were expected to be exactly what the parents wanted or the <br/>
parents were very authoritarian or who were never shown love, only <br/>
given stuff and money.<br/>
But I can&#39;t think of a simgle person who had parents who were <br/>
interrested in them but not in a controlling way who went on to have <br/>
these problems.<br/>
But I can only say that in anecdotal at best and can&#39;t be used as a <br/>
complete model of reality.  It is truly just what I see around me and <br/>
have experienced in the past.<br/>

&gt; &gt; leave their kids alone all day are considered the same as the stay at<br/>

&gt; &gt; We do Christmas our own way as we are not of the organized religions<br/>
&gt; &gt; persausion.  Each year we take turns reading Christmas stories from<br/>
&gt; &gt; different religions and countries.  We&#39;re a curious bunch here and like<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; know the hows and whys of what other folks do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Each year we pick a different country to &quot;do&quot; for dinner.  This year we<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing Germany and the whole menu is from Germany.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We have lots of music and sing alongs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christmas isn&#39;t part of my heritage but is part of hubby&#39;s so we go with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; flow, so to speak.  And all of us being artsy types, our house (a<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, let me see if I can explain some of this while fixing dinner LOL...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You have to sign a form from any organization stating that you are<br/>
&gt; adopting<br/>
&gt; &gt; a pet...this is for their records and for the state which does check<br/>
these<br/>
&gt; &gt; out if there is a problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spay and neutering is also required by 6 months as that is when the<br/>
animal<br/>
&gt; &gt; becomes &quot;adult&quot; and can reproduce.  We are all trying to keep the number<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; unwanted animals down so this has to be enforced or well, one cat has<br/>
3-8<br/>
&gt; &gt; kittens and 6 months later there are say 3 more cats pregnant from that<br/>
&gt; &gt; litter and so on...also, this is state mandated as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shots are also a requirement for the health of an animal but truthfully,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the shelters are too busy to check into it and see.  They would spend<br/>
&gt; 99.9%<br/>
&gt; &gt; of their time on the phone to different vets trying to do this and some<br/>
&gt; &gt; people do them on their own...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The implant is for YOUR protection, not to track the animal in the<br/>
manner<br/>
&gt; &gt; in which I think you mean.  If the dog/cat ever got away from you, there<br/>
&gt; &gt; would be a way to get it back to you.  We honestly wish more people had<br/>
&gt; &gt; them when we find their animals...I have seen many kids in tears when<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; family pet disappeared or took a dog on vacation and it happened to<br/>
break<br/>
&gt; &gt; off its leash or slipped its collar and was gone in a flash.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Most of what they do on applications/contracts is to make people realize<br/>
&gt; &gt; the importance that their pet carries.  They are trying to make people<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; people got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; &gt; for rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; regulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Our contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; spay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you could<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; fined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have already<br/>
&gt; &gt; been through a lot in their life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Each year we pick a different country to &quot;do&quot; for dinner.  This year we<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;doing Germany and the whole menu is from Germany.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you were doing your whole Christmas German, you&#39;d do the presents on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christmas Eve.  That&#39;s how we always did it when I was little.  Now we<br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt; it both ways.  Dinner and presents here on Christmas Eve, then dinner<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; presents on Christmas Day with Rod&#39;s family.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Exactly! I thought her tooth had grown in malformed, and our regular<br/>

&gt; &gt; The application process started because of a problem with some folks<br/>
going<br/>
&gt; &gt; around to shelters to get animals to sell to labs.  Desperate/unethical<br/>
&gt; labs<br/>
&gt; &gt; will buy anything.  Good/ethical labs only buy animals bred for the<br/>
&gt; purpose<br/>
&gt; &gt; because testing an then be standardized.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, let me see if I can explain some of this while fixing dinner<br/>
LOL...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You have to sign a form from any organization stating that you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; adopting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a pet...this is for their records and for the state which does check<br/>
&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out if there is a problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Spay and neutering is also required by 6 months as that is when the<br/>
&gt; animal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; becomes &quot;adult&quot; and can reproduce.  We are all trying to keep the<br/>
number<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unwanted animals down so this has to be enforced or well, one cat has<br/>
&gt; 3-8<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kittens and 6 months later there are say 3 more cats pregnant from<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; litter and so on...also, this is state mandated as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Shots are also a requirement for the health of an animal but<br/>
truthfully,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the shelters are too busy to check into it and see.  They would spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; 99.9%<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of their time on the phone to different vets trying to do this and<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people do them on their own...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The implant is for YOUR protection, not to track the animal in the<br/>
&gt; manner<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in which I think you mean.  If the dog/cat ever got away from you,<br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would be a way to get it back to you.  We honestly wish more people<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them when we find their animals...I have seen many kids in tears when<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; family pet disappeared or took a dog on vacation and it happened to<br/>
&gt; break<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; off its leash or slipped its collar and was gone in a flash.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of what they do on applications/contracts is to make people<br/>
realize<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the importance that their pet carries.  They are trying to make people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for their pets so that our jobs are easier in rescue.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people got their animals spayed and neutered, there would be no real<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for rescue groups anymore.  Some countries do not have them as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; regulate animal husbandry so much.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Our contracts have the same thing on it about taking the dogs back if<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spay/neutered on time and if that and the shots are not done, you<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fined $150 dollars...it is a protection to the animals who have<br/>
already<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been through a lot in their life.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There seem to be even more regulations in Mass and the MSPCA here seems<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be pretty successful in placing pets. At at least one place the animals<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; neutered before they leave the shelter (at 3 months) and most shots are<br/>
&gt; &gt; given. And yes the implant is so the owner can (hopefully!) be reunited<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lost pet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One place wanted to see either a deed or tax bill to prove home<br/>
ownership.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The shelters have *lots* of animals turned in because the pet&#39;s owners<br/>
&gt; moved<br/>
&gt; &gt; to a new apartment and the new landlord didn&#39;t allow pets.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think they&#39;re wonderful! Probably if you saw what they see -- the<br/>
&gt; massive<br/>
&gt; &gt; number of unplanned kittens and puppies turned in and sick animals and<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; &gt; forth -- the reasons for the regulations would make a lot more sense.<br/>

&gt; I guess my think ing is this . . .<br/>
&gt; I know lots of assicts and alcoholics.  Theya ll seem to fall into<br/>
&gt; two categories . . . those who came from poor innercity places where<br/>
&gt; drinking and drugs were an escape of sorts and a way to cope the<br/>
&gt; otehr type are those who come from mid to upper-class homes where<br/>
&gt; they were expected to be exactly what the parents wanted or the<br/>
&gt; parents were very authoritarian or who were never shown love, only<br/>
&gt; given stuff and money.<br/>
&gt; But I can&#39;t think of a simgle person who had parents who were<br/>
&gt; interrested in them but not in a controlling way who went on to have<br/>
&gt; these problems.<br/>
&gt; But I can only say that in anecdotal at best and can&#39;t be used as a<br/>
&gt; complete model of reality.  It is truly just what I see around me and<br/>
&gt; have experienced in the past.<br/>
