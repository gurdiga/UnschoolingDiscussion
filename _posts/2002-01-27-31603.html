&gt;I am going to start homeschooling soon possibly in a week or two.  Both of<br/>
&gt;my dd are in ps right now.  one in the 5th and one in the 1st.  I joined<br/>
&gt;this list because I plan on unschooling, and need help in changing my mind<br/>
&gt;set.  I though this list would help me do that.  I hope that it can.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Louise, What a big and wonderful step you are taking. Welcome to the <br/>
group! How much have you read of the unschooling.com website? You&#39;ll find <br/>
a wealth of information that should be able to make you feel comfortable <br/>
with changing your mind.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have also found in talking to my dds that they need to change their mind<br/>
&gt;set as well.  For example my oldest wants me to give her spelling tests.<br/>
&gt;(Man do I hate spelling!!!)  Anyway, I figure that I will let her pick the<br/>
&gt;words that she feels that she needs to learn, and give her tests from them.<br/>
&gt;One of her teachers did this, and so she feels comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a John Holt book &#39;How Children Learn&#39; that actually gets down to <br/>
the nitty gritty parts of spelling test, math and other interesting ideas <br/>
to get you started. I think you&#39;ll enjoy the part about kids giving <br/>
themselves spelling &quot;tests&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Anyway, I think that I will start with some structure.  Such as write in a<br/>
&gt;journal.  Write some letters.  And have some books around that they can use<br/>
&gt;with science experiments in them.  Also some math books and video games<br/>
&gt;around.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Having stuff around is great! Although I&#39;m not sure if it falls into the <br/>
category of &#39;structure&#39;. It means you got the right idea of providing an <br/>
environment of options. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;How does this sound.  I know that the unschooling thing is to let the kids<br/>
&gt;tell you what they want.  It seems to me from talking to them that they want<br/>
&gt;some structure.  That will probably change, but to start with that is what<br/>
&gt;they are asking for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone on the list recently gave an awesome analagy about feeding a <br/>
child and unschooling. I sincerely apologize for not knowing the orignal <br/>
author. I hope the author can let us know who they are:<br/>
<br/>
+   &quot;Unschooling&quot; is like feeding a baby-  when the BABY needs, how <br/>
+ much the BABY needs- <br/>
+ <br/>
+   &quot;Schooling&quot; is like feeding a baby- when the MOTHER wants to, <br/>
+ how much the MOTHER wants<br/>
+ <br/>
+   The difference lies in the locus of control- with unschooling, <br/>
+ we give back our children something our society and culture  <br/>
+ steals-  the right to govern one&#39;s self.   The right to be one&#39;s <br/>
+ self, to know one&#39;s self.   With unschooling, we tell our <br/>
+ children we trust them, we believe them-  <br/>
+ <br/>
+   We believe THEY know when they are hungry and full (weather it <br/>
+ is for food, knowledge, affection, or anything) <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and let us know how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
regards,<br/>
