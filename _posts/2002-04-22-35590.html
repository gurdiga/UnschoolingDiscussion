<div id="ygrps-yiv-591772040">Wonderful post, Ren!<br/>
I love all your ideas. They&#39;re so inspirational!<br/>
Hey, I think YOU should be speaking at the conference, too.<br/>
I always get a lot out of things you say.<br/>
I love your unschooling spirit - it&#39;s contagious! :o)<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Could someone give examples of &quot;offering&quot; information in a non-lesson-y<br/>
&gt;  way?<br/>
&gt;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that this is a great question. And something I really struggled<br/>
 </span></blockquote>with<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at first because my kids were so used to me trying to &quot;teach&quot; something<br/>
&gt; ,instead of just offering, that they initially resisted. So part of this<br/>
&gt; equation, and undoubtedly the most important one, is the issue of trust<br/>
&gt; between parent and child.<br/>
&gt; If the child knows that you trust them and they can trust you not to push<br/>
&gt; something they don&#39;t want, they will be MUCH more willing to try.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The other part of this equation is something that Sandra has dubbed<br/>
&gt; &quot;strewing&quot;. I love the picture of a parent liberally strewing a path<br/>
 </span></blockquote>before a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child, rather than following along behind prodding and poking.<br/>
&gt; What does strewing consist of in this house?<br/>
&gt; Here are a few ideas......If one of my children chooses not to check<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anything<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; out at the library, I might just grab (without saying anything) a few<br/>
 </span></blockquote>books,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cassettes or movies I think they&#39;d like....or maybe just ones that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>interest<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ME. I leave these in obvious places at home and quite often they get<br/>
 </span></blockquote>picked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up and used. I don&#39;t prod, I don&#39;t say demeaning things about they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;should&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; check something out. I just make things available.<br/>
&gt; If it&#39;s something really interesting, I may bring it to their attention<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; leave it at that.<br/>
&gt; So there&#39;s one example of &quot;strewing&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Another is to leave interesting books you have at home, lying in an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>unusual<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; place where it might get noticed. The bathroom is ideal, as people are<br/>
&gt; sometimes &quot;hanging out&#39; in there for a while. LOL<br/>
&gt; Strewing can be casual, inviting. That&#39;s what you&#39;re doing...inviting. It<br/>
 </span></blockquote>may<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be totally ignored, that&#39;s fine. It might be picked up....the point is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you&#39;re<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; offering.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing I enjoy, is to pick up the listing of local events. I will<br/>
&gt; peruse the paper for interesting events and activities and mention them. I<br/>
&gt; also give them the paper and ask them to tell me if anything catches their<br/>
&gt; eye.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think part of the key for me, is to offer the information in a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>respectful<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; method...just as I would to dh. &quot;Hey, this sounds really cool, why don&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; go try this&quot; is a lot more inviting than &quot;you should really try this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>class, I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think you&#39;d learn a lot&quot;.<br/>
&gt; Although the wording is a very individual thing, I think the idea is to<br/>
&gt; offer, but respect a &quot;NO&quot;.....or a &quot;maybe&quot; as much as a &quot;yes&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another part of this equation in my opinion is the level of interest for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parent.<br/>
&gt; If you get excited about something, it is very likely to spill over to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>other<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; individuals in the house....just as their excitement hopefully gets you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>going.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have varied interests that you&#39;re willing to explore, this really<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sets<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the tone for the children.<br/>
&gt; Show them the wide world of opportunities, offer up many options, but be<br/>
&gt; respectful of them as individuals. Look at them as your companions in<br/>
&gt; learning instead of a person that needs knowledge imparted to them and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you&#39;ll<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be well on your way to this concept of   strewing!!<br/>
&gt; If you&#39;d like to read more about how other people &quot;strew their paths&quot;<br/>
