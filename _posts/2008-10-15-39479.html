<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979154923">Recently, following Holly&#39;s links, I came to this on her boyfriend&#39;s  <br/>
page.  He updated his MySpace stuff and wrote<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heroes:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are people who I would much rather be like, or who I<br/>
think are super cool. The real heroes of my life are my friends and<br/>
family. I&#39;ve learned basically everything I know from or as a direct<br/>
cause of them. Friends are great. Currently, my biggest hero(es) are<br/>
my girlfriend, and her family.<br/>
<br/>
And in a blog post he wrote:<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m happy with the things that have gone well recently, namely Holly<br/>
and her wonderful family, the Dodds. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
=========================================================<br/>
<br/>
His parents are not nice to him.  The last time he had dinner with  <br/>
his dad (when his recovering-from-suicide sister was in town), he  <br/>
told his dad he was planning to move away from  his cynical,  <br/>
pessimistic, depressing roommate (they&#39;ve been roommates almost all  <br/>
of  seven years, at two universities and more than one house)--and  <br/>
moving into our house for a while.    His dad said &quot;Aren&#39;t you  <br/>
ashamed of your life?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What his dad wants him to be ashamed of is dropping out of grad  <br/>
school and not becoming a PhD or a doctor.  Brett turned 24 not long  <br/>
ago.  He&#39;s been pressured since he was four years old and they put  <br/>
him in school early so he could be a doctor sooner and ultimately  <br/>
make more money  His parents divorced when he was six.  He&#39;s been  <br/>
variously shunted, neglected and indulged (if things and money  <br/>
counted), and they treat him like a bad child no matter what he does.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t know how to relax or to breathe hopefully or to live  <br/>
happily,  yet he is very patient and thoughtful and sweet.   I told  <br/>
him he needed remedial intact family.  It was my idea for him to move  <br/>
in here, for a while at least.  His living situation was ending, and  <br/>
his family and roommate were a huge energy suck anyway.  The last job  <br/>
he had (contract work in a medical research lab) paid $14 or $15.   <br/>
When he told his dad, his dad laughed at him and said &quot;Our nanny  <br/>
makes more than that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Poor guy.   But he&#39;s a sweetie and Holly loves him, and they seem  <br/>
really good for each other.  He&#39;s been a good friend of Kirby&#39;s for  <br/>
four or five years, and of Marty&#39;s nearly that long.  It&#39;s been a  <br/>
year and a day since he and Holly decided they were best friends.    <br/>
It didn&#39;t turn romantic or into being a couple until a few months  <br/>
after she was 16.  (Yes, it&#39;s legal, we checked.  One of my former  <br/>
SCA students is now the assistant D.A. in charge of violent crimes,  <br/>
and he has the jury instructions memorized.  If Brett worked in a  <br/>
school in which Holly were enrolled, or a medical facility in which  <br/>
she was a patient, it would be a violation of law.   She&#39;s not in a  <br/>
school or a hospital, and he doesn&#39;t work in either anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
There are photos of them here (and one of me and Keith, too):<br/>

ins.html<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different.  I didn&#39;t expect it.  It was another &quot;principles over  <br/>
rules&quot; surprise in my life.<br/>

That&#39;s sweet. <br/>

<br/>
I met my husband of 21 years when I was 16 and he was 25.  (he&#39;d already<br/>
been in the military for 4 years) We&#39;ve been together ever since and now<br/>
unschool our kids which we didn&#39;t have for quite some time.  (I was 27 and<br/>
he 36 when we had our first)  My family didn&#39;t know my then-boyfriend&#39;s age<br/>
and they liked him before they found out. &lt;big evil grin&gt; They were always<br/>
accepting of him and my mom always fed him dinner and let him stay over<br/>
night on the holidays when he didn&#39;t live nearby anymore.  We married when I<br/>
was 19 and he 28.  He is a big part of my family and everyone loves him.<br/>
(come from a big family) I have no idea what would have happened if my<br/>
family had rejected him based on age alone other than the fact that I would<br/>
have left with him and not looked back.  His family too has always been<br/>
supportive since him Dad is 10 years older than his mom.  ;)  Anyway, most<br/>
moms would freak and I think it&#39;s awesome that you support them openly,<br/>
despite their age difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754400529">The age is a matter of perspective.  My mom and dad were 5 years apart, and<br/>
because she was almost 17 when they married it seemed like a big deal at the<br/>
time, and we girls heard about it from time to time throughout our<br/>
childhood.  My sister was forbidden to keep in touch with her boyfriend when<br/>
the family moved 2 states away and she was 17.  Ridiculous.<br/>

<br/>
I think this applies to Holly and Brett too, and additionally she has  <br/>
unschooling and he needs someone who knows deep inside that there are  <br/>
things outside of grades and college credits.  He has found someone  <br/>
who really, truly doesn&#39;t care what his GPA or SAT were, because she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t even know what those mean.  And because he was given a false  <br/>
sense of maturity, he will (if things continue to unfold as they are)  <br/>
be able to really become an adult, separate from his parents,  in  <br/>
Holly&#39;s presence.<br/>
<br/>
That might sound more dramatic than necessary, but I think I&#39;m  <br/>
putting it lightly.<br/>
<br/>
And if they decide not to stay together longterm, it still looks like  <br/>
there are benefits to both of them in all this.<br/>

<br/>
My dh went from a pretty controlling home right into the military after<br/>
highschool.  Though he doesn&#39;t really talk about it, I get the feeling that<br/>
he spent those few years after the military (I met him a few years into this<br/>
phase) reacting/rebelling subconsciously (by partying and doing whatever the<br/>
hell he wanted to) to the controlling home that he never recovered from<br/>
right after high school because he entered the military.  He spent those<br/>
years working and partying and he ended up renting a home with my<br/>
x-boyfriend and two other people who were just out of high school and<br/>
entering the work force.  (My x-boyfriend had been a Senior when I was a<br/>
Sophomore which is much more acceptable)  Anyway, this was the place to<br/>
party and we met there.  <br/>
<br/>
After I finished high school, which seemed to take forever, we went to the<br/>
same 2 year college together and after the first year I married him so I<br/>
could move in with him in.  I thought that if I didn&#39;t marry him my mom<br/>
would freak out.  But then my older sister, who never did anything wrong,<br/>
moved in with her boyfriend and it was okay.  But I had been afraid to.  By<br/>
the time we went off to college, neither of us was into partying much<br/>
anymore.  We buckled down, worked jobs off and on campus to support<br/>
ourselves, and got our degrees and went on with our lives.  <br/>
<br/>
My reaction to all the typical control of childhood was not to rebel so much<br/>
as to just want to break free.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been work being married for 21 years.  It hasn&#39;t always been easy but<br/>
we&#39;ve always been comfortable around each other.  Over time and slowly, he&#39;s<br/>
come to realize that the way I treat the kids works much better than the way<br/>
he was treated as a kid. (and when he was frustrated would treat our kids)<br/>
It was slow at times but he steadily moved toward a more peaceful way of<br/>
being with the girls and the other day when he called, (works on the road a<br/>
lot) he told me what a good mother I am and said that whatever I am doing it<br/>
is working because when he talks to everyone else at all the different<br/>
places he works they have nothing nice to say about their teens/pre-teens<br/>
and he thinks ours are great.  (and they are!)  We all live in peace and<br/>
treat each other respectfully and we talk about our feelings and find<br/>
solutions to problems that work for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
My house isn&#39;t always clean.  (ok hardly ever)  Supper doesn&#39;t make it to<br/>
the table very often. (and sometimes it has fur in it, lol)  But we connect<br/>
every day. We share time together with our animals.  I help the girls when<br/>
they ride.  Get them to lessons. We hang out with their friends.  (I noticed<br/>
I was the only mom on one of those emails, &quot;get to know your friends&quot; that<br/>
one of the girls&#39; friends sent around the other day..the rest were all<br/>
teens)  I pick up friends, drop them off, let them spend the week-ends.  We<br/>
play on-line games together.  We enjoy being with each other.  My kids&#39;<br/>
friends love to be here and they include me when we all hang out.  My family<br/>
rocks.  =)  <br/>

Hearing his work associates talk about problems with their children  <br/>
gave Keith great confidence, too.  Once at a party the others all  <br/>
started moaning about how lazy and unmotivated teens are, and Keith  <br/>
said something to the effect that our Kirby (15 or 16 at the time)  <br/>
had a job he liked and was good at.  They didn&#39;t say &quot;tell us more.&quot;   <br/>
The responses were more to doubt Keith and to treat it like a  <br/>
conversation-killing thing.   They weren&#39;t really conversing for  <br/>
informational purposes.  It was &quot;support.&quot; It was a calm frenzy of  <br/>
teen bashing and commiseration.   It was &quot;poor us,&quot; but Keith felt  <br/>
lucky.<br/>

I can&#39;t help thinking, because I know it to be true, that it didn&#39;t<br/>
start yesterday, it started years ago when Chamille was little, by<br/>
treating her respectfully and in a way that showed her how important and<br/>
awesome she was/is.<br/>
<br/>
Everytime we are out and about, we hear and see people being mean to<br/>
little kids.  It physically hurts sometimes.  Those kids aren&#39;t going to<br/>
get over that, they will grow up to be mean to themselves or others or<br/>
both.  It never ceases to surprise me at how ridiculously parents treat<br/>
their children.  I hold my children dearly in my heart, I would never<br/>
treat them in that manner, nor would they accept such treatment from me<br/>
or anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be talking to someone about having a teen and they&#39;ll say something<br/>
about not looking forward to that age when their kids get older.  I<br/>
always tell them, that I love having a teen and that I think my teen is<br/>
one of the most awesome, nicest, coolest people I know, because I really<br/>
feel that way about her!</div>

Brett is very VERY nice to Holly.  But he was very nice to his last  <br/>
girlfriend, who wasn&#39;t a very nice person, who seems to have liked  <br/>
him mostly because he could get liquor and she couldn&#39;t, yet.  She  <br/>
thought he would be THRILLED when she got a fake ID, but it seemed to  <br/>
me he was relieved because she no longer really needed him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty sad.<br/>
<br/>
By then Holly was more a part of his social group, though, and  <br/>
although it seemed she was way too young to consider, and from her  <br/>
point of view he was one of Kirby&#39;s friends, they did take notice of  <br/>
one another.   The contrasts, in all directions, made differenced in  <br/>
their lives (except maybe the ex girlfriend who seemed to maintain  <br/>
her relationship with liquor).<br/>
<br/>
If Holly felt Brett wasn&#39;t nice enough, she wouldn&#39;t keep him  <br/>
around.  Someone&#39;s going to have to better for her than Keith and I  <br/>
are to make her want to leave here.  Parents who are cruel and  <br/>
thoughtless and mean lower the bar *so much* that some girls will get  <br/>
pregnant to get out, or leave with a stranger from the internet.<br/>
<br/>
When anything else seems better than home, why is it the children who  <br/>
get in trouble and not the parents?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I wonder this too.<br/>
<br/>
We were at the zoo the other day, and as is expected there were more<br/>
than a few tired toddlers and little ones.  We over heard over and over<br/>
again from parents, a request of tired toddlers to just behave.  I kept<br/>
thinking what an absurd request that is!<br/>
<br/>
At one point a parent was threatening a 3 yr, telling her that if she<br/>
couldn&#39;t behave herself she would have to go sit in the car and wait<br/>
there so that everyone else could have an enjoyable time at the zoo<br/>
without her complaints.  I was wondering if she would even be able to<br/>
follow up on that threat, since I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s illegal.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille was pretty disgusted with it.  I told Chamille that the mom<br/>
really should be the one going and sitting in the car to wait for her<br/>
kids, since she clearly couldn&#39;t behave herself around her kids enough<br/>
to make an enjoyable trip to the zoo without being mean and threatening.<br/>
I thought about saying it to the mom, but sometimes it&#39;s just better to<br/>
walk away.  Chamille thought that in the absense of many of the parents<br/>
there, most of the kids would be nice and thoroughly enjoy the zoo<br/>
wandering around with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Each and every time we saw a child crying or upset, it was the parent<br/>
that was behaving worse.  Big adult children mistreating powerless<br/>
others.  Why even go to the zoo with your kids, if your just going to be<br/>
mean and miserable?  Some of those parents should&#39;ve swatted themselves<br/>
on the behind!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I occasionally gave myself a time-out.... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
When mine were little, we&#39;d do what we called The Two-Hour Zoo.  Two  <br/>
hours to focus on one area, rather than trying to see the whole thing,  <br/>
or two hours to take the sky buckets over to the polar bears and walk  <br/>
back down past the zebras and giraffes, or two hours to take in a show  <br/>
and eat our bagged lunch.  Two hours was just the right amount of time  <br/>
-- interest didn&#39;t lag, and no one got tired enough to get grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, living in San Diego and having zoo memberships helped ;-)   <br/>
We always considered the memberships as &quot;school supplies.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Rhetorical question maybe?  I would think this is so because children don&#39;t<br/>
have the resources, skills, the network of friends and relatives to fall<br/>
back on when necessary (even adults could use that sometimes), or even the<br/>
simple license by law to do what they need to in order to succeed.  Even if<br/>
they&#39;re of age with license and some sort of network to rely on, most kids<br/>
needs some help now and then.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked this of someone today.  If your kid wants to succeed and can&#39;t<br/>
without help, would you say your kid is a failure?<br/>
<br/>
Me... I would feel like a failure if my kid needs help and I refuse, based<br/>
on the crummy assumption that kids &quot;should&quot; succeed on their own.<br/>

Going by much of what passes for parenting, yeh... that&#39;s the truth.  I had<br/>
to laugh at the absurdity of it when I read what you wrote.  Sad and very<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845980677">-=-Of course, living in San Diego and having zoo memberships helped ;-)<br/>
We always considered the memberships as &quot;school supplies.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had zoo memberships until recently.  Now that Marty&#39;s older than  <br/>
18, some of the family memberships aren&#39;t worth having anymore.  We  <br/>
still go to the museums, though.  I&#39;ve kept natural history and Explora.<br/>
<br/>
We wouldn&#39;t say &quot;let&#39;s go to the zoo,&quot; but &quot;let&#39;s go see the bird  <br/>
show&quot; or &quot;let&#39;s go see the bears.&quot;  So with one destination in mind,  <br/>
we&#39;d choose which way to walk to it and which way to walk back out,  <br/>
so we&#39;d see several things.<br/>
<br/>
For several years running, the Honeywell company picnic was at the  <br/>
zoo, after hours, and that was fun, but this year the moved it to the  <br/>
fairgrounds.  Boring.<br/>

and Koala Club kids memberships until the kids were 17.  Now, the two  <br/>
kids share a dual membership, too.<br/>

Ah, yes. <br/>

&quot;We did all the right things.&quot;<br/>

&quot;No. You did what somebody you perceived as an expert told you to do.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
