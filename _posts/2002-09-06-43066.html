<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065643580">Hi there, I just joined recently, and have been lurking, so I suppose I<br/>
ought to speak up...<br/>
<br/>
I am Helen, dw to Marc, and Mom to Denise, who just turned five, and Evelyn,<br/>
who just turned one.  We decided to homeschool this past spring, when I<br/>
pulled my eldest out of her (so-called) Montessori school, and our whole<br/>
family (well, apart from Evelyn, I suppose) is pretty excited about it.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Barrie, Ontario, and if there are any unschoolers in our area,<br/>
please speak up!!  We need some buddies - all my daughter&#39;s friends are back<br/>
to school, and although she doesn&#39;t want to join their ranks, she is feeling<br/>
a bit lonely.  <br/>
<br/>
When we decided to homeschool, we started casting about, looking for a<br/>
&#39;plan&#39;, and unschooling really does seem to be it.  I am curious about how<br/>
rigid the definition of &#39;unschooling&#39; is?  The things that appeal to me<br/>
about it (read: the ideas I have selected to adopt :-)) are the lack of an<br/>
organized curriculum, or timeline for knowledge/skill acquisition, and the<br/>
fact that my daughters are the ones to guide and lead their own development.<br/>
It is easy for people to see how this is right for the little one (some how<br/>
she has learned to walk without any lessons or &#39;equipment&#39; LOL), but squirm<br/>
when I talk about that same idea with my older daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, my dh is right on board with the unschooling, and really,<br/>
really REALLY happy about the homeschooling in general.  Being new to the<br/>
idea, I am still exploring the ins and outs of unschooling myself, and if he<br/>
were unsupportive, I can&#39;t imagine how difficult that would be.   He has<br/>
come a looooong way, though, from the guy who was staunchly against me<br/>
having our first at home (she was born there anyway, as was my second, by<br/>
which time he was a total convert), and who didn&#39;t think babies belonged in<br/>
their parents bed (with #2 we didn&#39;t even bother with the crib, just bought<br/>
the king-sized bed).  I guess if I can guide him through those paradigm<br/>
shifts (and others, like vaxing and circumcision), I could have done the<br/>
same with this, but I am soooo grateful I don&#39;t have to!<br/>
<br/>
There are some things, however, that we do that I think may &#39;disqualify&#39; us.<br/>
I have set up a room here in our house, which has lots of math<br/>
manipulatives, language materials, geography stuff - all kinds of things -<br/>
set out on shelves for her.  My husband started calling it &#39;the classroom&#39;<br/>
and that name has stuck.  It won&#39;t be a place for &#39;classes&#39; in any sense of<br/>
the word - I set it up to make all of those things accessible to her, so she<br/>
could explore them, and ask for help and clarification when she wants it.  I<br/>
probably will offer &#39;lessons&#39; at times, but she will never have to<br/>
participate against her will.<br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, I am trained as a Montessori teacher, and it has obviously<br/>
influenced my approach.  If there was  decent Montessori school in my town,<br/>
I probably would have left her in there, but I am now so excited by the<br/>
whole idea of her being home that even if one moved in tomorrow, I would<br/>
never send her!  There is a definite influence there, though, and again, I<br/>
wonder if that &#39;disqualifies&#39; me as an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I will be welcome here, as I have been greatly enjoying your<br/>
discussions.  You sound like a pretty cool bunch.  Are there no Christian<br/>
unschoolers on the list though?  There have been some comments recently that<br/>
surprised me, as they would have caused some other lists I have been on to<br/>
erupt into flames!  For the record, I am UU and my dh is a Zen Buddhist.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I have also been following the Yes vs. No threads.  I have seen this<br/>
same thread pop up on other lists, and it always fascinates me.  I find<br/>
myself very drawn to the idea of it, but it just never works for me.  I do<br/>
always seek the &#39;yes&#39;, but sometimes, for me, the answer is just no.  This<br/>
applies to my dh, my dd, my mom - everybody in my life.  Sometimes the<br/>
answer is just no.  I do have questions for those of you here who never say<br/>
no to your kids, as I&#39;d like to explore the idea more, but I think that&#39;s<br/>
for another time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those of you who made it ALL the way to the end!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Helen,<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;ll just say what my idea of unschooling is and it sounds pretty much <br/>
like what you do. I don&#39;t see anything wrong in setting up a room full of <br/>
whatever will interest the kids. I sometimes wish I had a room to do that. <br/>
My stuff is all over the house!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I prefer to see unschooling as child led. For us that means whatever they <br/>
want to do. I once heard another unschooler discussing learning with one of <br/>
her children. The child wasn&#39;t coming up with any ideas for the following <br/>
day and the mother said &quot;Well, we have to learn something!&quot;<br/>
To me, that wasn&#39;t unschooling. The child would have learned something even <br/>
if she just played all day long. That seemed forced to me.<br/>
<br/>
My one daughter happens to love worksheets. So she does them. I make sure <br/>
she always has them available and she does them when she wants to. I never <br/>
suggest that it&#39;s time to do paper work or anything like that. And she can <br/>
do them or not do them or quit them whenever she wants.<br/>
Some children seem to like more structure than others and if that&#39;s what the <br/>
child wants, then I think that&#39;s okay too. As long as one isn&#39;t strongly <br/>
suggesting, which I see some unschoolers do, or mapping out wht the child <br/>
&quot;needs&quot; to learn.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends! :-) Why you or your daughter do something is more important than<br/>
what you do. A workbook dipped into because a child thinks it&#39;s fun like a<br/>
puzzle book is a whole different thing than a workbook that&#39;s in the house<br/>
because mom is concerned the child won&#39;t learn the topic without the<br/>
workbook.<br/>

for her to acquire through life?<br/>
<br/>
If you had to choose between the educational stuff and her toys which would<br/>
you choose and how comfortable educationwise would you be with that<br/>
decision?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to discourage your room! :-) But trying to get across the<br/>
idea that a room full of learning stuff can feel oh so very comforting when<br/>
&quot;educational stuff&quot; is really a minor player in the process.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There is a definite influence there, though, and again, I<br/>
&gt; wonder if that &#39;disqualifies&#39; me as an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think teachers -- maybe especially Montessori teachers? -- will have an<br/>
even tougher time breaking out of the habit of thinking certain activities<br/>
lead to a specific result and a specific result requires specific<br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking out of the mode of thinking is hard enough for those who haven&#39;t<br/>
been trained to think like that! ;-) Society does a good job of brainwashing<br/>
us on how children learn!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are there no Christian<br/>
&gt; unschoolers on the list though?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When people use Christian in reference to homeschooling generally it refers<br/>
to the fundamentalist Christians who have flocked to homeschooling and<br/>
created sort of a closed community for themselves. (They refer to themselves<br/>
as Christians, as in &quot;I am, and you&#39;re not.&quot;) The closed community would be<br/>
no skin off anyone&#39;s nose if they weren&#39;t also politically active and acted<br/>
as though they *were* Homeschooling itself ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In short, the term &quot;Christian&quot; among homeschoolers says a whole lot more<br/>
than the dictionary definition.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am UU<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me too :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do<br/>
&gt; always seek the &#39;yes&#39;, but sometimes, for me, the answer is just no.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Such as?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This<br/>
&gt; applies to my dh, my dd, my mom - everybody in my life.  Sometimes the<br/>
&gt; answer is just no.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But your dh and your mom don&#39;t need you as an advocate in getting what they<br/>
need from the world. :-) We adults tend to see only the advantages of being<br/>
a kid -- oodles of time free of responsibilty and obligations -- but miss<br/>
the total powerlessness and dependence.<br/>
<br/>
The Yes/No discussion isn&#39;t meant to imply that parents should become<br/>
doormats for their children but a recognition that children are fellow human<br/>
beings who need someone to go to bat for them to help them get what the<br/>
adults take for granted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470932420">Feeling whimsical, I started thinking about the idea of doormats -<br/>
outside of the traditional negative definition.<br/>
<br/>
If a doormat is a softer place to walk for a child, or a doormat is the<br/>
place where the nastiness of the world can be left behind, before going<br/>
into the home, I hope I can be the &quot;doormat&quot; for my little girl.<br/>

<br/>
We had a toy room for a while (Games Room, with table and puzzles and <br/>
group-toys, and puppet-box, and costume box...)  and I liked that, but the <br/>
kids had their own stuff in their own rooms, and there was no requirement <br/>
that that stuff stayed in that room or anything.  It was an organizational <br/>
situation, not a philosophical stance.<br/>

hardwired (my word, not hers, obviously) to learn, and that we <br/>
need to get out of the way for that to happen.  She believed that <br/>
children crave learning and are driven to it (this is easily <br/>
observable in small children learning to walk and talk - <br/>
miraculously! &lt;wink&gt; - without &#39;lessons&#39; or instruction).  She also <br/>
believed that an environment that was rich and full of materials <br/>
that illuminated information about the child&#39;s world and assisted <br/>
the child in developing the skills they crave was akin to placing a <br/>
banquet before a starving person, and it should be presented as <br/>
such.  &quot;Here is your feast, lovingly prepared:  eat your fill.&quot; Filling <br/>
the child&#39;s plate for them and then spoon-feeding them is not <br/>
necessary - in fact it merely turns them off so that they turn away <br/>
from the very sustenance they so craved before.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was never certified as a Montessori teacher, but I taught in a <br/>
Montessori school and was trained by Montessori certified teachers <br/>
and attended workshops and read some of her books.  I wouldn&#39;t send <br/>
my kids to one now tho either.  One of the things that I think <br/>
hinders Montessori schools (around here at least) from being truly <br/>
child led is that all the schools either stop at the third or sixth <br/>
grade.  From there, most go to more traditional schools, so there is <br/>
a concern about making sure they are on track to do so.<br/>
<br/>
To me, my experience as a Montessori teacher only helped me embrace <br/>
unschooling. I see the basic principles of the Montessori approach--<br/>
individual liberty, observation of the child, and preparation of the <br/>
environment--as very much in keeping with unschooling.  There are <br/>
some things about Montessori that I don&#39;t like, but I had problems <br/>
with these things when I taught too.  Namely, using the materials <br/>
only in the prescribed manner and the discouragement of fantasy <br/>
play.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, I have extended the idea of giving children freedom to <br/>
choose in a prepared environment into other areas of parenting as <br/>
well.  For example, I used to strictly limit TV.  But now, I feel <br/>
like if TV is a part of their environment, they should be free to <br/>
choose that as well.  <br/>
<br/>
One detrimental thing about my Montessori experience tho was the <br/>
insistence of making them clean up after themselves and not doing it <br/>
for them.  I was very consistent, shall we say, about this with my <br/>
two oldest when they were young.  Even now, when I ask them to help <br/>
me do a general clean up I hear &quot;But I didn&#39;t do that.  It&#39;s not my <br/>
responsibility.&quot;  With my youngest, I haven&#39;t done this.  When we are <br/>
finished I suggest let&#39;s put this away so we don&#39;t lose the pieces or <br/>
it doesn&#39;t get stepped on.  Sometimes she will and when she doesn&#39;t I <br/>
just do it and often she ends up helping me anyway--and much more <br/>
cheerfully than the others did. I also found that if I insisted that <br/>
they finish all the steps and cleand up afterwards, they often would <br/>
avoid doing some really cool things to avoid all the drudgery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested to know what things about your training  <br/>
you think will interfere with unschooing?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; For the record, I am UU and my dh is a Zen Buddhist.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am also a UU and very interested in Zen Buddhism.  This brings up a <br/>
question I have been meaning to post on this list.  There are a lot <br/>
of teachers (relative to the small number of members) at our church.  <br/>
I don&#39;t always feel comfortable talking about hsing and why I do it <br/>
as many are very supportive of public schools.  I belong to a UU <br/>
homeschool list and this topic has come up and I know there are other <br/>
UUs on this list.  It seems to me, that unschooling and UU fit very <br/>
well together and I am sort of surprised that more aren&#39;t interested <br/>
in, at the very least, dismantling the current system of public <br/>
education and replacing it with more of a learning community/free <br/>
school type model. Any thoughts or experience of other UUs out there?<br/>

to go to when she has friends over (typically &#39;schooled&#39; friends <br/>

are too many fragiles and chokables in the &#39;classroom&#39; for her.  I <br/>
just don&#39;t trust kids who are used to a &#39;wreck room&#39; unsupervised <br/>
in there...  when we are home and just hanging out, she can go <br/>
in either - whatever she wants.  They are just different.  One is <br/>
much more orderly and she can escape her sister for a while.  <br/>
No, she doesn&#39;t need me to go in with her, and yes, she can take <br/>
anything she wants from the shelves to explore.<br/>

homeschooling affords for my daughter to play freely.  I f she <br/>

shelf, she is free to do so. :-)  Ditto for creative play with the items <br/>
in the phonic object box, and building stuff with the geometric <br/>
solids.  I think that many Montessori teachers are way too uptight <br/>
about that stuff - that is what I try to borrow from Waldorf - that <br/>
and natural forms and materials in the environment.  I like being <br/>
free to pick and choose the things from which my daughter can <br/>
pick and choose, without being tied down to one philosophy.<br/>

We talk about being part of the family, and how we all need to <br/>
help each other.  I model that by doing her laundry, and cleaning <br/>
up her toys on her behalf sometimes.  I expect it of her by asking <br/>

to do nothing at all, and just let her be, fearful that if I do try to <br/>

teachers.  I don&#39;t like the way our current system runs, but I <br/>
certainly don&#39;t blame the teachers for that.  I think the whole <br/>
business needs a complete paradigm shift.  I think that having <br/>
free public education as an option is critical.  I also think it <br/>
should be regarded as an OPTION - not a mandatory thing.  I find  <br/>
I never have troubles when talking to teachers about <br/>
homeschooling, unless they are openly derogatory or rude, but <br/>
that&#39;s true of anybody...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115837690">Gotcha.  Well, the activities you describe are mostly &quot;Practical <br/>
Life&quot; activities (or activities one wouldn&#39;t find in a Montessori <br/>
class, like dress-up).  In a home situation, helping with chores <br/>
and just participating in day-to-day activities with the family ARE <br/>
the child&#39;s Practical Life.  The way in which my training would <br/>
help me there would be to remind me to include my dd as much <br/>
as possible, and to find ways for her to help me by making the <br/>
tools she needs to do so as accessible as possible (low <br/>
storage, small implemets, etc.). Montessori did have specific <br/>
approaches to Math, Language, Geography, etc., which are not <br/>
addressed in your examples.<br/>
<br/>
Those are the areas where specific materials to illustrate certain <br/>
concepts are helpful.  Math manipulatives, globes, books, pencil <br/>
and paper... these things become very useful.  Having a battery <br/>
of ways in which I can make all of these things accessible and <br/>
appealing helps too. <br/>
<br/>
Where is the &#39;Montessori&#39; in my house?  It is in my low shelving, <br/>
my carefully selected books with beautiful language and <br/>
illustrations, the small dustpan and broom that hangs in my <br/>
kitchen.   It is in how I address her, without talking &#39;down&#39; to her, <br/>
or &#39;downsizing&#39; my vocabulary.  It is in a hundred tiny details that <br/>
make my home a space that accomodates the stature and <br/>
abilities of my child, so that she can participate as fully as <br/>
possible, as easily as possible. <br/>

Not much.  I could possibly present some materials to her in the <br/>
way I was trained to, and if she is interested in it, I see no harm <br/>
in that.  I certainly woudl not eschew it simply so I could call <br/>
myself an &#39;unschooler&#39;.  That is the kind of rigidity I wish to AVOID <br/>

opinions about &quot;them&quot; but with very little effect on the apparent<br/>
group-think view that Christians as a whole are worthy of<br/>
condemnation.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;parish&quot; I figure you might be Catholic.<br/>
<br/>
The fundamentalist Christian homeschoolers who were being discussed don&#39;t <br/>
consider Catholics to be Christian.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m accurate about &quot;them&quot; <br/>
(Southern Baptists and other fundamentalists) teaching their children that <br/>
Catholics are not really Christians.<br/>
<br/>
There are very few statements about Christians which are true of all <br/>
Christians.<br/>
<br/>
And there are very, very MANY Christian homeschoolers whose view of <br/>
Christianity is very very narrow.  Statements of Faith (required by so many <br/>
groups all over the country) don&#39;t even always include all fundamentalists.<br/>
<br/>
Examples:<br/>
<br/>
Family Association for Instruction and Teaching at Home<br/>
<br/>
1. We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired <br/>
Word of God, without error, the revelation of his will for the salvation of <br/>
men. <br/>
<br/>
2. We believe in one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and <br/>
eternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br/>
<br/>
3. We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been <br/>
conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died on the <br/>
cross, the sacrifice for our sins according to the scriptures. Further, He <br/>
arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where at the right hand of <br/>
the Majesty on High, He is our Priest and Advocate. <br/>
<br/>
4. We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord <br/>
Jesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing <br/>
sinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living <br/>
and sacrifice. <br/>
<br/>
5. We believe the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection provide the <br/>
only ground for justification and salvation for all who believe, and only <br/>
those who receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus become <br/>
children of God. <br/>
<br/>
6. We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <br/>
and that this &quot;Blessed Hope&quot; has a vital bearing on the personal life and <br/>
service of the believer. <br/>
<br/>
7. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer to <br/>
everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord; of the unrepentant to judgment <br/>
and everlasting conscious punishment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Statement of Faith<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We believe the Bible to be the only infallible authoritative Word of God. (II <br/>
Tim. 3:16) <br/>
<br/>
We believe God is one divine Spirit eternally manifested as Father, Son and <br/>
Holy Spirit. (Jn 10:29f; Jn 10:30 ; Jn 15:26) <br/>
<br/>
We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His <br/>
sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His <br/>
shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of <br/>
the Father, and in His visible and physical return to earth. <br/>
We believe all have sinned and as a result are alienated from God (Rom. 3:23, <br/>
5:12), and that eternal redemption is only brought about by faith in the <br/>
finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 10: 9-10; Eph. 2:8-9). <br/>
<br/>
We believe that if one rejects the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ, he <br/>
subjects himself to eternal damnation and separation from God the Father and <br/>
will spend eternity in a literal place called hell (Rev. 21:8). <br/>
<br/>
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling, <br/>
the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. (Rom. 8:13-14; I Cor. 3:16, <br/>
6:19-20; Eph. 4:30, 5:18). <br/>
<br/>
We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.</div>

principles!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No - not at all, actually.  I recieved my training from MM&#39;s <br/>
granddaughter (the daughter of Mario Montessori, Maria&#39;s son) in <br/>
1995, and we were very vocally warned against EXACTLY this.  <br/>
We were strongly encouraged to stand our ground in schools <br/>
where admins are results oriented, and impression-oriented, <br/>
rather than being true to the philosophy they claim to espouse.<br/>
<br/>
One of the many benefits of the three-year age-range in <br/>
classrooms is that children can go at their own pace, and focus <br/>
on the areas that capture their interest.  This is also the reason <br/>
there is so much overlap of materials between the levels (a 3-6 <br/>
class will have many of the same materials as a 6-9 class, for <br/>
instance).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And this is something I strive for every day.  I keep stumbling, but <br/>
I keep trying.  :-)  I make no claims to perfection, and it always <br/>
rankles when I hear others doing so.  Who am I to say that this or <br/>
that person is not perfect - that their children are nbot perfectly <br/>
behaved every moment?  Perhaps they are, but I do doubt it.  I <br/>
think children deserve to be treated with deep respect.  I believe <br/>
that, for the most part, our society treats them very shabbily <br/>
indeed.  I don&#39;t however, believe that removing the word &#39;no&#39; from <br/>
my vocabulary is really the answer.  I feel there are times when it <br/>

<br/>
I think this is the point of a lot of this.  Many parents say no for <br/>
its own sake because they think it is good for their kids.  Just as <br/>
they don&#39;t think children can learn naturlly, they think children <br/>
won&#39;t naturally get the message that they can&#39;t always have what they <br/>
want when they want it without imposing deprivation on them.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I played a game of cards with my dd.  She wanted to play <br/>
another one and I was really tired and I said &quot;I am really tired.  I <br/>
just want to go to sleep.  We can play again tomorrow.&quot;  She said ok <br/>
and didn&#39;t whine and insist, I think in part because when she says &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t want to do that right now.....&quot; to me, I respect that. If she <br/>
had insisted, I would have said something like &quot;I am really tired and <br/>
I wish you would respect that.&quot; <br/>

the fact that girls are afraid to say no.  Often, I think guys don&#39;t <br/>
take no seriously--they think they don&#39;t really mean it. It&#39;s what <br/>
girls are supposed to say just like it is what parents are supposed <br/>
to say when their kid wants a cookie right before dinner.  I think <br/>
this comes in part from not being raised to live mindfully.  I think  <br/>
it, in part, comes from the frequency with which parents say no to  <br/>
a request off the cuff because they don&#39;t want to be bothered or <br/>
don&#39;t want to spoil their children.  And then, when the child whines <br/>
and argues (as in why can&#39;t I) and the parent runs out of reasonble <br/>
things to say or just wants the kid to stop, they just say &quot;Oh <br/>
OKAAAAY already!!!!!!!&quot;  If no is used sparingly, and only when there <br/>
is a real reason for it--including respecting the parents&#39; boundaries-<br/>
-it carries much more meaning.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 When I was in college, I was dating a guy and he wanted me to spend <br/>
the night.  We were both tired, and I didn&#39;t want to drive home.  I <br/>
told him clearly I did not want to have sex.  He said ok we didn&#39;t <br/>
have to--we can jsut cuddle.  I told him clearly, at least two more <br/>
times that I really meant it I did not want to have sex.  He assured <br/>
me he was ok with that--I believed him.  Later, he started pressuring <br/>
me to have sex.  It wasn&#39;t because I was afraid to say no.  I left <br/>
and never saw him again.  <br/>

people with girls? I hear people say that boys are so much easier and they <br/>
are the same people who raise their girls with strict screaming rules and <br/>
let their boys go out and do whatever and whenever they please. They seem to <br/>
think that only the girls need to have the sex talk and they just hand the <br/>
boys some condoms. For the most part, I think those are the boys that have <br/>
no comprehension of how to treat a girl. Of course there are parents who do <br/>
the same with the girls too. Some of the girls my daughter knows at school <br/>
have no curfew and are out til all hours doing what we don&#39;t want our <br/>
daughters doing. It just doesn&#39;t occurr to these parents what could happen??<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m dealing with a situation now where we actually had to get a restraining <br/>
order because a boy my daughter knows can&#39;t take no for an answer. My house <br/>
is wired with cameras and I stay up all night. The parents are totally <br/>
unconcerned. I want to smack them all!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Why is it that a lot of people with boys raise them so much differently <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see that among unschooling families, and for the purposes of this <br/>
discussion, is that what we can or should limit it to?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I hear people say that boys are so much easier and they <br/>
are the same people who raise their girls with strict screaming rules and <br/>
let their boys go out and do whatever and whenever they please.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because my boys don&#39;t have to be home at a certain time doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they didn&#39;t build up to that trust and privilege gradually by showing good <br/>
judgment about little things at younger ages.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They seem to <br/>
think that only the girls need to have the sex talk and they just hand the <br/>
boys some condoms. For the most part, I think those are the boys that have <br/>
no comprehension of how to treat a girl.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I grew up with LOTS of girls who never had the sex talk from their parents.  <br/>
They were given some absolute and mysterious rules, like &quot;Boys only want one <br/>
thing&quot; (without telling them what that one thing was), and &quot;Keep your clothes <br/>
on.&quot;  Or &quot;No, you&#39;re not old enough for car dates.&quot;   Without more <br/>
information, lots of those kids figured out how to have sex with boys without <br/>
getting in a car or taking their clothes off, and technically they hadn&#39;t <br/>
broken their mom&#39;s arbitrary rules.  <br/>
<br/>
Growing up with all girls in our house (for within four years of age), I was <br/>
fully aware of warnings for girls and &quot;freedoms&quot; for boys, and all that.  <br/>
<br/>
Now,  having teenaged boys (and their many teenaged-boy friends over so <br/>
much), I see girls who are safe and smart and I don&#39;t fear them, and I see <br/>
girls who are NOT safe, who are mean to boys, who use them in various ways, <br/>
and we had one come through our lives who will get out of her father&#39;s home <br/>
as soon as she can by getting pregnant.  There is no other way out but for <br/>
him to throw her out.  And I talked to a batch of boys about that and said BE <br/>
CAREFUL of G.  She wants pregnancy, and SOMEone is going to be the father of <br/>
that child.  I have told them more than once, when there was a trigger for <br/>
the conversation (not in a batch, but individually) that if a girl gets <br/>
pregnant, they&#39;re in it for life.  They have no option not to be a father; <br/>
the question will be whether they are a good father or a really bad father, <br/>
the cause of that child&#39;s not having a father, or what.   It&#39;s not 18 years, <br/>
it&#39;s LIFE.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve talked to them about the effect of changing a life by becoming <br/>
sexual.  That once it starts it rarely stops, and so there&#39;s no hurry to that <br/>
life change.<br/>
