I went to Junior college (my grades got even better) and then transferred to a fairly psrestigious University. There I maintained a 3.5gpa and still didn&#39;t do a lot of reading.

I also felt that I was lazy for not wanting to read.  I know differently now.  I know that there are lots of ways to learn.  That is is never to late to learn to read well (which I am getting better at everyday, I am now 35)  and It is never too late to fall in love with the written word.   I do love to read now.  I wish you all the best with your Grand Daughter.  How lucky she is to have you for a grandma!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649124686">Raundi,<br/>
Thank you for the lovely message and sharing your personal experience.  I<br/>
guess maybe we are doing better than I thought we were.  It is not as though<br/>
she is not reading at all,  her reading is probably at about a second or<br/>
third grade level.  I do know what you mean though about feeling you weren&#39;t<br/>
as smart as the ones who were faster.<br/>
<br/>
Why do &quot;we&quot; put so much emphasis on speed?  Like the faster they learn the<br/>
smarter they are, and that doesn&#39;t even make much sense.  Just because a<br/>
child is potty trained at 18 months doesn&#39;t make him any more intelligent<br/>
than one trained at 3 1/2.  When you question a highly educated person it is<br/>
such a surprise when they say they didn&#39;t learn how to do this or that until<br/>
much later than &quot;average&quot;.  Like even speech.  To all things just come at a<br/>
different pace.<br/>
<br/>
Your letter has a lot of insight.  I appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Sharon<br/>

&gt; I am new to this group, new to homeschooling, and new to unschooling.  We<br/>
have just started homeschooling last year and we have been unschoolers for<br/>
most of it.  (We did give a curriculum a try until we found out how much we<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Raundi -- this is so heartbreaking, isn&#39;t it? To think that there are kids <br/>
STILL sitting in school, thinking they&#39;re dumb, because their specific <br/>
abilities are not a good match for how school teaches. Just such a SHAME.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, it did.  And when I talk about how fast Jenni reads, it is just a <br/>
fact. Jenni can whip through books faster than anyone I&#39;ve ever met.  <br/>
Rachel can point to a spot in the outfield and hit a ball to it 9 <br/>
times out of 10 (on a decent pitch).  It doesn&#39;t mean either is better <br/>
than the other as a person, they just have differences.<br/>
