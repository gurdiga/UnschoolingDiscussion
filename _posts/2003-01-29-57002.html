<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115817629">&lt;&lt;I wish someone would write a book about how unschoolers can make a living<br/>
doing things they love without college&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need a book.  The evidence is all around you.  I posted about my<br/>
brother the chemist who flunked out of college.  I have a graduate degree<br/>
but haven&#39;t used it in years.  I teach karate and raise goats (both of which<br/>
I love).<br/>
<br/>
Johnny Depp dropped out of high school and when he decided he was crazy and<br/>
tried to go back, the principal told him &quot;No really, please don&#39;t.&quot; And<br/>
encouraged him to follow his passions.<br/>
<br/>
If you follow your heart and are willing to work hard, you can make a<br/>
living.  Perhaps not a fortune, but a living.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1224604024">&quot;PS - the blog noted is blood pressure raising ;-) however I did<br/>
recognize some<br/>
names from this list with great response posts ;-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just to give you all a bit of background, the owner of that blog (the<br/>
blood-pressure raising one) started this whole thing by coming to MY<br/>
blog and posting a comment about us being &quot;child abusers&quot;. He later<br/>
retracted that (sort of), but I actually used his rude comment as a<br/>
blog post instead of letting it through as a comment.<br/>
<br/>
When I shared the info. with UB members, several of them went to<br/>
comment at his site. He keeps posting about unschooling. It&#39;s been<br/>
interesting.<br/>
