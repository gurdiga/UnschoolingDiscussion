<div id="ygrps-yiv-1911270070">My daughter (3 years old) goes back and forth, usually calling us &quot;Mom&quot; <br/>
(never Mommy) and &quot;Daddy&quot;,  and then sometimes calling us &quot;Jen&quot; and &quot;John&quot;.  <br/>
My mother was here visiting from out of state last week and laughed when she <br/>
heard my daughter call out to her father, &quot;Hey John?&quot;   We&#39;re so used to it, <br/>
and we answer to it like it&#39;s perfectly fine.  My mother (&quot;old school&quot;) <br/>
thinks it&#39;s inappropriate, but I can&#39;t help but find it refreshing.  After <br/>
all, that&#39;s our names, right?  And I never call out, &quot;Hey daughter!&quot;  But I <br/>
really don&#39;t mind either way.<br/>
