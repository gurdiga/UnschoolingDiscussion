<div id="ygrps-yiv-752619817"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I thought a piece of a post I got on another list may be appropriate<br/>
&gt; here. It&#39;s from Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Biography<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;The only purpose I can think of for posting this at this time is as a<br/>
suggestion that some people need to take Ben&#39;s advice and do as he did.<br/>
<br/>
That might be appropriate on a list where people are asking for help<br/>
changing how they relate to others. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s an unschooling list<br/>
were people come to talk about and get help understanding unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Joyce, I know I am always talking about things that don&#39;t seem *appropriate* to this list, but I thought Ben&#39;s words would be appropriate for some, if not most of us (aside the fact that I think it&#39;s a cool quote anyways), before we start again on the road to arguing, labeling, pointing fingers or insulting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That might be seen as a suggestion that people should change. I hope it&#39;s<br/>
seen as a suggestion on how to get off this negative path and back on the<br/>
path to discussing unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was no suggestion whatsoever. It made me think when I read it, and I thought it would be thought provoking for other people as well. Sorry if it&#39;s not about unschooling per se. To me, unschooling also encompasses an internal process where I *unschool* myself from my preconceived ideas and fixed notions, or repetitive responses to others and life. Perhaps I should go into lurk mode now.<br/>

  I REALLY enjoy reading your posts about unschooling from a <br/>
homeopathic point of view.  A lot of good stuff would be missing from <br/>
the list if you went into lurk mode now. :) <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was no suggestion whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was talking about my suggestion that might help people let go of the idea<br/>
of power to control others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It made me think when I read it, and I<br/>
&gt; thought it would be thought provoking for other people as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When the thoughts provoked can seem to be promoting the position of one side<br/>
over the other, then it&#39;s going to be perceived as just plain provoking.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not suggesting that was the intent. Just talking about people&#39;s<br/>
reactions to their *perception* of our intent. That&#39;s perhaps an even bigger<br/>
factor in relations because people can&#39;t know what our intent is, only what<br/>
it appears to be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sorry if it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not about unschooling per se.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s lots on this list that isn&#39;t about unschooling per se. The<br/>
objections are to anything that interfers with people discussing and<br/>
understanding unschooling. Talking about the list and how people should be<br/>
and post is one of those things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me, unschooling also encompasses an internal<br/>
&gt; process where I *unschool* myself from my preconceived ideas and fixed<br/>
&gt; notions, or repetitive responses to others and life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think a lot of people could benefit from those ideas! I think this way<br/>
of being comes across beautifully in how you post and what you post about in<br/>
the course of your posting about unschooling and life in general so I hope<br/>
you don&#39;t go into lurk mode.<br/>
<br/>
If we think some people would be helped by our understanding of the world, I<br/>
think the best way to help them is to just *be* who we are :-) We should<br/>
*be* and respond in the ways that we think is most helpful. And the people<br/>
who are ready for that understanding will be drawn to the expression of our<br/>
particular understanding.<br/>
<br/>
But we have to allow people to set their own goals for their being and<br/>
follow the paths that they think are best for them right now.<br/>
