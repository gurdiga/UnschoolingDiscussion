<div id="ygrps-yiv-488591360">We&#39;re a year into unschooling and love it.  My daughter is often <br/>
asked &quot;what grade are you in?&quot; by people when we&#39;re out and about.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for a clever, (but nice) answer to give people, without <br/>
answering a specific grade.  I&#39;m trying to get away from those <br/>
schoolish things!  I also don&#39;t want to get into a big discussion in <br/>
the grocery store, for instance, about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?  Thanks in advance!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52129970">I tell them my daughter is in 1-6th; which is *true* in so much as if she were tested in different areas she would be ranked 1-6th grade. <br/>
Another answer is:<br/>
We grade meat not people. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853126008">Nice answer:  She&#39;s x years old, if she was in school she&#39;d be in grade x.<br/>
not as nice:  grades are for eggs and meat, not people.<br/>
My 7yods thought your grade equaled your age. (at a 5 he would tell people <br/>
he was in 5 grade)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, Will (9) has used those, too.<br/>
<br/>
He recently spent a day at work with my dad, who shuttles pilots and flight <br/>
attendants from a hotel to the airport all day.  Will was asked the question* <br/>
many times that day.  Dad said he mostly just answered &quot;I don&#39;t like school, <br/>
so I don&#39;t go.&quot;  Dad said some folks were astounded into silence, some simply <br/>
changed the subject.  Some pressed further, and my dad, being the joker he <br/>
is, just carried the thread in that direction until the person got wise and <br/>
figured out the homeschooling angle or gave up.  Only one person got it right <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
I think my dad had a lot of fun with it!<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Why aren&#39;t you in school?&quot; or some variation.<br/>
