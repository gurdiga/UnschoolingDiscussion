<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961120737">Kids will learn math because math is a basic element in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Kids start learning fractions and geometry as toddlers when we are cutting<br/>
sandwiches.  Geometry and physics have been big at our house as the kids<br/>
play sports (playing pool is almost all &quot;math&quot;).  Cooking gets into<br/>
fractions, division and multiplication really quickly.  Allowances will get<br/>
further into multiplication and beginning algebra.<br/>
<br/>
All this and the kids are about 8 years old or so.<br/>
<br/>
You may be thinking.  OK, but how will they learn to solve the equations, do<br/>
long division.  Just as &quot;math problems&quot; in school get more complex as we get<br/>
older, so does the unschooler&#39;s life.  Example:  Adriane (11) chose to show<br/>
dairy goats in 4-H (sound familiar Lynda? LOL) just because it would be fun<br/>
and the math skills she has learned has been tremendous.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  The goats are now being milked and we are using the milk.  Adriane<br/>
thought that perhaps we could pay her for the milk since we are no longer<br/>
buying it from the grocery store.  She weighs the milk each morning and<br/>
subtracts out the weight of the bucket.  She charts the milk weight.  End of<br/>
each month, she adds up how much milk she has supplied the family.  She<br/>
checks out how much organic milk is selling for at the store.  Converts the<br/>
price for a half gallon into price per pound (8lbs=1 gallon).  She<br/>
multiplies how much milk she has provided by the price per pound.  She then<br/>
figures out how much the family has paid for the goat&#39;s upkeep.  (We have 5<br/>
goats so total expenses per month divided by 5)  She subtracts the cost of<br/>
upkeep from amount her milk is worth.<br/>
