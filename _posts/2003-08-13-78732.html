&gt; If reading is natural,  then wouldn&#39;t a written language be natural?<br/>
&gt; What about the Australian aboriginals who survived thousand of years<br/>
&gt; without &quot;inventing&quot; one?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every time we want to say, &quot;Learning to read is natural&quot;, we could instead<br/>
say, &quot;Learning to do what the other members of the tribe/family unit are<br/>
doing is a natural desire of the young of our species, ergo, if the<br/>
tribe/family unit places importance on reading by engaging in said activity<br/>
and filling their huts/homes with the materials and tools necessary for said<br/>
activity, the young will naturally and artlessly wish to engage in said<br/>
activity as well, and will read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems easier to just say, &quot;Learning to read is natural&quot; and leave the &quot;to<br/>
children living in our reading homes and societies&quot; as obvious.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe that&#39;s just me. ;)<br/>

Only 5 feet 11 1/2 inches, hehehe.  I won&#39;t give up the half inch. <br/>
<br/>
I get what you mean, of course.  <br/>
I like to pick natural apart from cultural.  I think it&#39;s important to <br/>
discern.   <br/>
My thought is this: If reading wasn&#39;t thought so automatically to be a <br/>
&quot;natural thing&quot;, maybe kids who struggle with it wouldn&#39;t feel so badly when it <br/>
doesn&#39;t come easily to them?<br/>
