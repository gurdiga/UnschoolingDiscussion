<div id="ygrps-yiv-4082862">&lt;&lt;feel sorry for myself and wish I had some little kids to come wake me up<br/>
from a nap&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once again, you ladies are life-savers.  I really, really needed to hear<br/>
this today, a reminder that I am gonna miss these crazy days once they are<br/>
over.<br/>
