 </span></blockquote>Of all the topics I could have chosen to comment on.. but this one really<br/>
hit home with me.. I was a girl raised under this sort of moral law. I did<br/>
move out at age 17 just as soon as I could, because of my Dad being so very<br/>
strict. I hardly spoke to my Dad for years afterward.. I never want it to be<br/>
that way with me and my daughters.  I have three daughters..my oldest is 19<br/>
and recently moved out to live with her boyfriend..also a 13 and an 8 yr<br/>
old. My oldest chose to become sexually active at 17. I wish she would have<br/>
waited..but she was aware of the risks..both physical and emotional. She<br/>
didn&#39;t chose to have sex because she was being &#39;rebellious&#39;. Right now she<br/>
says she never wants to be married. We&#39;ve only been unschoolers for the past<br/>
5 years..more &#39;school-at-home&#39; types 6 yrs before that.. so maybe things<br/>
would have been different for my eldest if we had dropped all the baggage<br/>
sooner. Julie in MO</div>

rejected this moral code. Interesting.<br/>
