<div id="ygrps-yiv-22215171">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Gosh..been gone since Friday and the mail did me in!  Finally, I gave <br/>
up and thought it will be easier to start from scratch and erased <br/>
it!  Probably missed out on some great things, oh well..LOL!!  <br/>
Anyway, I had a question about bedtime.  We are pretty relaxed about <br/>
bedtime.  I have been trying to get my older son to regulate his own <br/>
bedtime.  The 2 yo seems to be better at is because if he is tired he <br/>
will either stay in his bed or fall asleep somewhere in the afternoon <br/>
and get a nice nap.  My almost 5yo is different.  I have no problem <br/>
with him staying up later.  However, he usually fights the idea of <br/>
going to bed because he wants to stay up and force Dad to play Harry <br/>
potter on the computer!  I would not mind except after a few 10 <br/>
oclock nights and no naps he is just a crabby little boy.  The <br/>
reality is he need more sleep.  How do I allow him to go to bed when <br/>
he is tired which is never before 10 if he is not directed to go to <br/>
bed and still be a happy, well rested child?  Then, I end up <br/>
*forcing* a nap so he is back to himself.  We seem to be stuck in <br/>
this cycle, any ideas??<br/>

<br/>
Soothing videos<br/>
rock and sing to him softly<br/>
take him for long car rides, with a pillow, and a window shade<br/>
<br/>
Even if he doesn&#39;t fall alseep he&#39;ll get still and rest some.<br/>

Sunday night my dad took us all out to eat, and after we&#39;d go for a &quot;Sunday Drive.&quot; <br/>
 We&#39;d drive through downtown Long Beach (CA) and look at all the cool old <br/>
houses...if it was dark and the lights were on we&#39;d sometimes be able to see the <br/>
people inside.  Then I&#39;d make up stories in my head about them.  Sometimes <br/>
we&#39;d drive along the coast...sometimes through the next town,...or often dad <br/>
would take us over one of the large bridges, or we&#39;d drive around the Navy docks <br/>
and look at the ships.  Dad was never one to use the air conditioner liberally <br/>

backseat and triangular back windows that got stuck sometimes...torture when <br/>
driving to San Diego or Monterrey in the summer!<br/>

Hi Olga, hope you had a good time.<br/>
<br/>
As far as bedtime goes, you have to do what feels comfortable for you.<br/>
Joseph is the same way. He ignores all signs of being tired. I&#39;ve seen him<br/>
sit at the table just yawning away with his eyes half closed and still<br/>
drawing. He will stay up until 2 a.m. no problem. I don&#39;t have a problem<br/>
with that but after about 2 days, everyone ends up suffering his<br/>
consequences. He gets down right mean. He&#39;ll fight with Sierra and holler at<br/>
Alyssa and anytime we get together with other kids, he&#39;ll end up getting<br/>
very angry with them too. Not to mention getting upset with me and his dad.<br/>
He&#39;s just an all around grouch! When he goes to bed earlier, this just<br/>
doesn&#39;t happen. So I explain this all to him very clearly. I point out exact<br/>
things that happened. I explain how I see him ignoring the signs that he is<br/>
tired. I&#39;m sure if I left him alone for a maybe even a month, he would<br/>
regulate, but I&#39;m not willing to do that right now. He will lose friends in<br/>
the process and that bothers him too. Plus what happens here in the house.<br/>
<br/>
So most night, when Sierra and Alyssa are tired, he knows I want him to go<br/>
to bed too after them. That&#39;s usually around 11-12. I also explain that if<br/>
he goes to bed early, he can wake up earlier and have his alone time then.<br/>
The girls need more sleep than he does. I&#39;ve also explained how staying up<br/>
later and waking later doesn&#39;t really give him any more play time. I think<br/>
he was seeing it as extra time at night. Now he understands it doesn&#39;t work<br/>
that way! A few nights a week, I will tell him he can stay up later. I have<br/>
found that on those nights, he is trying to understand when he&#39;s getting<br/>
tired. He&#39;s been asking to go to bed around 1:00. This has all worked out<br/>
well for his disposition, for us and for him. He understands and if it&#39;s a<br/>
night where I think he needs his sleep and he asks to stay up, I make a deal<br/>
and tell him if he gets some sleep tonight, he can stay up tomorrow. As long<br/>
as he gets 2 good nights in a row, he&#39;s good to go. As he gets older, I feel<br/>
like he will get better at knowing what he needs. He knows now, he just<br/>
chooses to ignore it!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613057238">Hi Olga,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some issues with a 5 year old regulating her own sleep, as well.  She is very resistant to sleep.  She always has been the type who doesn&#39;t want to miss anything.  Her dad and I like to have a bit of time in the evening that we are awake, but not engaged with Davan, as well.  <br/>
<br/>
So, this is what we&#39;ve come to.  She has a room time, instead of a bed time.  We do all the bed time stuff - snack, teeth brushing, a book if she wants one, hugs, kisses, good-nights at room time.  Then she is responsible for herself.  She doesn&#39;t have to stay in her room exclusively, she isn&#39;t a prisoner, but we do encourage her to be in her room.  It&#39;s easier for her to remember that she&#39;s playing on her on.  <br/>
<br/>
She really likes listening to books on tape, so she has those on, which we don&#39;t allow on the main stereo after &quot;room time&quot;, which also encourages her to play in her room.  She listens to tapes and plays until she feels tired, then listens to tape in bed until she falls asleep.  If she wakes up at night, she turns her tape back on and sometimes even gets up and plays again for a while.  It turns out that she really likes to sleep with the lights on, as well.  I&#39;ve always thought it was very difficult to sleep well with the lights on, so have imposed lights out on her, but she doesn&#39;t need it.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad leaves for work at 5 and goes in to say good morning every morning and reads her a poem (she likes poems).  She then almost always joins me in bed for the rest of the morning.  In my room, though, there is no tape to listen to and the room is dark.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;d want to be there all night due to this, but I must admit that I haven&#39;t offered.  She used to family bed, but when we moved a little over a year ago she chose to start sleeping in her own bed in her own room.  The novelty of it might have worn off and she might have started family bedding again, but we moved from a king to a double at the same time.  So, we&#39;d rather she wasn&#39;t there all night - too cramped.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit of this plan to me is multifold.  She&#39;s happy enough about &quot;room time&quot;, so no bed time fights.  I get a bit of time in the evening to relax without needing to engage.  Here&#39;s a big one, though:  I have no idea how much time she is sleeping, so I have no basis for thinking she is grumpy due to lack of sleep.  Sometimes it seems that if I think she hasn&#39;t slept enough and is grumpy, it comes true.<br/>
 <br/>
I hope you find a solution!<br/>

<br/>
One of the biggest arguments against breastfeeding is that the mother no <br/>
longer knows how much milk the baby is drinking.  Darned if it doesn&#39;t turn out <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t matter!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Sometimes it seems that if I think she hasn&#39;t slept enough and is grumpy, <br/>
it comes true.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my kids seem grumpy I ask them to sleep more the next night.  Usually <br/>
that&#39;s enough reminder just to help them maintain courtesy despite being tired.  <br/>
It&#39;s another courtesy matter:  If they aren&#39;t able to be nicer to people <br/>
because they&#39;re not sleeping enough or eating enough protein or drinking enough <br/>
water (dehydration&#39;s a constant consideration here, kids go play at the park <br/>
with a gallon of water), then THEY are not doing what they need to do to live <br/>
civilly and peacefully with other people.<br/>
<br/>
We help them out, but we don&#39;t MAKE them sleep or eat.  We do say &quot;sunscreen <br/>
and water!&quot; quite a bit.<br/>

<br/>
I am just giggling away over here.  No wonder you guys don&#39;t get out <br/>
before 12 noon!! LOL!!  Thanks for the detailed insight.  I see us <br/>
moving in that direction.  We kind of let the kids do their thing <br/>
until 9:30 or 10:30 because after that it catches up with him later <br/>
in the week.  I guess we have to find that balance.  Sometimes, he <br/>
will even admit he is really tired but still refuses a nap and denies <br/>
lack of sleep!  For a while, I did the &quot;You can stay up later, but <br/>
then you have to take a nap tommorow.&quot;  But, I really could not <br/>
follow through and he didn&#39;t need one each time.  Okay, we are still <br/>
working over here :)<br/>

that I wouldn&#39;t get going alone so we have to set the alarm and have<br/>
everything all planned the night before and get up and hussle. It&#39;s been<br/>
