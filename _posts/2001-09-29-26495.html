<br/>
&gt; SO... How does one incorporate more structure into unschooling, at the<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s request? I am NOT the world&#39;s most structured person anyway, and he<br/>
&gt; has no idea how he wants it to look. I think ANYTHING coming from me would<br/>
&gt; help at this point, because I think he wants to feel taken care of and in<br/>
&gt; control. How do I help find a structure for us that still lets him be in<br/>
&gt; control of his life and learning?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am a structure freak. &lt;g&gt; And I don&#39;t even hide in the closet. I love to<br/>
organize my small section of the world.<br/>
<br/>
I have notebooks and lists.<br/>
I have written plans and 5 year goals.<br/>
The dog has a signature color.<br/>
<br/>
So! What I would recommend is helping him to develop a structure for<br/>
himself, that he tracks and is in control of. It could be a check list (I<br/>
love those) or just a short daily schedule you could help him with the night<br/>
before, the week before, the month before (I love those, too) or you could<br/>
start putting him in charge of some portions of the household budget<br/>
(&quot;Here&#39;s $350, let&#39;s you and I figure out how to feed us all for a month.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
The biggest thing is that if his world is out of control (and whose isn&#39;t?<br/>
Hard lesson at 12 or 20 or 60!) he can control some small portions of it. I<br/>
once wrote something to a friend who was having a bad time that when the<br/>
world throws you to the floor and you&#39;re hiding under the bed afraid to come<br/>
out, you might as well clean out the dust bunnies under there and fold the<br/>
spare socks you find.<br/>
<br/>
In a disorderly universe, creating small spheres of order can be comforting<br/>
to some of us, and it sounds like your son would like to give it a try. But<br/>
I recommend against enforcement -- for him to be in control and feel in<br/>
control, it has to come from him. You can help with suggestions, you can<br/>
remind if it&#39;s not irritating or he asks you to, you can encourage deep<br/>
breaths and calm, but &quot;doing it for him&quot; defeats the purpose.<br/>
