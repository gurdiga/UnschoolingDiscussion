 </span></blockquote>Actually, I might be a little more descriptive than &quot;scary or gross&quot;,<br/>
since that&#39;s kind of vague... more like, &quot;Well, they show slitting<br/>
someone&#39;s throat, and of a bunch of people who were hung and are dead,<br/>
and someone being tortured, and then just his face as he&#39;s drawn and<br/>
quartered... and there are a lot of fighting scenes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although, admittedly, when we watched Braveheart I hadn&#39;t seen it either,<br/>
so I told her only that Mel Gibson was in it. Then again, I know my kid,<br/>
and the only movie that ever bothered her was Gorillas in the Mist, and<br/>
that was only because I got Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall mixed up and<br/>
kept telling her that she was still alive and nothing was going to happen<br/>
to her... urp. <br/>
