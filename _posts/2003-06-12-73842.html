This is the beach life where you actually get in the water, not just sit and <br/>
enjoy the scenery or explore the beach only.  I have many fond memories of the <br/>
Oregon beaches and I get to hang on the Alaskan beaches almost every year. <br/>
This girl thinks the Gulf is a LOT more fun for a beach party, thank you. :)<br/>
