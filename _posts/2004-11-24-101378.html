Maybe, if you are wealthy enough to afford hanging out at college for years.  <br/>
There are certainly other ways to figure out what you like or don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
In today&#39;s society, college is primarily a job training facility.  People <br/>
speak of college as *expanding your horizons*, but most people are there in order <br/>
to get better qualified to be hired.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The two of my four that have been to college really learned more about life <br/>
and themselves than about any future occupation.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest especially (she went away to a four year school) learned lots of <br/>
things that she just wasn&#39;t exposed to in our home, our community, our State <br/>
even.<br/>
<br/>
She &quot;used&quot; her education for two years teaching school.  Now she does <br/>
something different but all that she learned and experienced in college has helped <br/>
shape the person she is today.<br/>
<br/>
We aren&#39;t rich by most standards but even with the cost of a private college <br/>
education for one child and the amount paid to a community college (which <br/>
helped that child decide he didn&#39;t NEED college at all), I think it&#39;s money well <br/>
spent on my children for them to get more information about what they want <br/>
their place in this world to be.<br/>
<br/>
One child didn&#39;t want college at all and he&#39;s learned some lessons on his own <br/>
and maybe even sooner than the others but they might have been a bit harsher <br/>
since he was in the real world and supporting himself much sooner.<br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of young people are in college for the &quot;experience&quot; not <br/>
necessarily for the job opportunities.  Chances are greater, among the twenty <br/>
somethings that I personally know that went to college, that they are earning money <br/>
in something besides the field their degree is in.<br/>

Sure, a person will learn more about themselves (if they are paying any attention) during two or four years of doing anything.  That doesn&#39;t change the reason why they are there in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Did your children go to college primarily for that purpose?  To learn more about themselves and the world outside their childhood home?  I don&#39;t need to know the answer, but it is something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
If the goal IS to learn more about life and one&#39;s self, is going to college really the best way to do so, especially considering the cost?<br/>
<br/>
When I went back to college, it cost about $8,000 per year - and that was doing it on a slim budget and working the entire time.  If someone had handed me $32,000 and said, &quot;Learn more about life and yourself&quot;, I doubt I would have spent the money on college.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to school because of an interest in a particular field and the desire to earn the credentials to work in that field.  Of course I learned more about life and myself along the way.  But that was not my reason for attending.<br/>
<br/>
In between high school and college, I went to Alaska *for one summer* and stayed for nine years.  During that time, I also learned an incredible amount about life, the world outside of my childhood community, and myself.  I worked at several different jobs and learned about types of work I like and don&#39;t like.  For the first time in fourteen years, I felt I was doing what I wanted to do, rather than what others thought I should be doing.  Unschoolers have a fantastic head start on that one!<br/>
