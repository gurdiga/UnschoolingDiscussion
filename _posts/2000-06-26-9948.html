<div id="ygrps-yiv-652276128">I do, our supplier is Blooming Prairie.  They serve the mid-west area.<br/>
<br/>
We have a $10 fee to join, this in one time only fee.  It is designed to<br/>
reduce the number of people who call and request info and then never join.<br/>
If they have to fork over cash for the paperwork, then they are probably<br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a percentage fee on each order, it varies from 2 1/2% to 3 1/2%<br/>
depending on our equity in Blooming Prairie.  I think at the beginning our<br/>
percentage was 5% so we could get a fund started for needed items.<br/>
<br/>
Then we have a 1$ per delivery fee that covers our donation to the church<br/>
that we have delivery in.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are actually a buying club, not a co-op, we do not have equity fees<br/>
in our group.  If you want to have a true co-op then you would charge equity<br/>
fees for your supplier, and your own group.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have a co-ordinator who does most of the work and receives a<br/>
salary, or discount.  Others share the work equally.  We do charge a 10%<br/>
surcharge for members who want to order but don&#39;t want to work.  Currently<br/>
we have no non-working members.<br/>
<br/>
We do have a web site, but I don&#39;t know if it is okay to post the address as<br/>
it is supposed to be for members only.  I will email our co-ordinator and<br/>
see what she thinks.  Email me privately if you have specific questions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472599618">I can remember when I was younger and my mother belonged to the food co-op.  <br/>
We&#39;d get such wonderful things like chocolate covered raisins.  I&#39;m sure she <br/>
belonged for other reasons...but I just remember the raisins.  This was in <br/>
Upstate NY, though, I don&#39;t think anything like that exists in FL, where we <br/>
are now.  :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468167496">Hi Lorrie ...<br/>
<br/>
wellllll, the idea behind our food co-op is to SAVE $$$ and to get a FRESHER<br/>
selection than our the groc stores in our area offers, in other words cut<br/>
out the middle man and get the food home SOONER!!!  our fresh veggies/fruits<br/>
spoil w/i a day/so b/c of the HEAT even the ORGANIC foods ...  our h-s group<br/>
(25 fms) are pooling our $$$ together and buying fresh veggies/fruits from<br/>
the farmer&#39;s market in town ... the last co-op lady who ran this usually had<br/>
c. $400 per wk (cash) $8 for sm basket/$15 per large and we always trusted<br/>
her to find the best deals, she was just TERRIFIC finding the best<br/>
watermelons, cantaloupe, strawberries, tomatoes, green beans,<br/>
whatever/whatever ...  if your fm doesn&#39;t care for something you need to<br/>
tell her beforehand and she&#39;d sub w/ something else ... also, if the fm<br/>
isn&#39;t going to be in town a particular week, no biggie, they just don&#39;t pay<br/>
for that week but you MUST TELL b/c others are depending on your $$$, too,<br/>
so to speak ... so, it was on a week-to-week basis and pay as you go sort of<br/>
thing ... several of our fms have LARGE fms w/ 8/10 dch, so it worked out<br/>
beautifully b/c they always order several baskets ...  my prob is I&#39;ve<br/>
participated in food co-ops for yrs JUST NEVER ORGANIZED one before and the<br/>
idea is sort of overwhelming me, you know shopping w/ other people&#39;s $$$!!!<br/>
*ACK* ... our regular co-op lady&#39;s dh is in the process of transferring, so<br/>
a friend and I decided we&#39;d try our hand @ it instead of having our co-op<br/>
dissolve!!!   oh and the idea behind having each fm bring 2 laundry baskets<br/>
is they&#39;ll leave a basket w/ us and take the other FILLED basket  home<br/>
... this way we won&#39;t have to worry about finding enough paper/plastic bags<br/>
and we&#39;re more environ friendly, too ... this is really a lot of fun (on the<br/>
buyer end, I mean) BUT I&#39;m a little apprehensive about buying for THIS MANY<br/>
FMS!!!  ACK!!!  also, another thing the last lady did was once you&#39;ve<br/>
participated in the co-op for 2 consecutive mths then you can help pack the<br/>
baskets and only have to pay 1/2 price for your baskets that week but I<br/>
don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll continue that/not???<br/>
<br/>
sooooooo, *INPUT*, I need *INPUT* &lt;VBG&gt; ... what other ideas do ya&#39;ll have<br/>
that would make things run smoother for us newbies???<br/>
<br/>
Pris ~&gt; now, leaping off to the library (Monday afternoon is library day @<br/>
our house) ... ttfn ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660966815">Thank you for the information Pris.  This sounds like something that would be <br/>
fun and beneficial (and overwhelming).  Also sounds like a very educational <br/>
thing for the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned they did not think there was such a thing in Florida.  I <br/>
live in South Florida where it is very difficult to grow a lot of fruits and <br/>
vegetables.  Guess we could work with what we got.<br/>
