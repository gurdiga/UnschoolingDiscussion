Some of the draw programs will build a dot-to-dot picture.<br/>
There might be downloadable things you can put on your computer that will <br/>
either do that or have a collection of dot to dots.<br/>

I don&#39;t have a sight but we have made our own.  I use typing paper and place it over a coloring book page, lightly trace with pencil the design and then do the dots in marker.  If you draw with the pencil lightly enough you can run the sheet through a copier and the only thing that shows are the marker dots.<br/>
<br/>
We have used these to learn our times tables.  Just number the dots with 2, 4, 6...or 7, 14 21....<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was six and learned some of her times tables that way.  You can also just purchase a more difficult dot to dot book and use the above directions, just renumber and only put the dots on.  We have even started with 100 or 90 or 1987...<br/>
