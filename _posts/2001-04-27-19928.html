<blockquote><span title="qreply"> ----- Original Message ----- <br/>
An eight year old boy was walking down the road one day when <br/>
a car pulled over next to him.  The driver rolled down his window <br/>
and said, &quot;If you get in the car, I&#39;ll give you ten dollars and a <br/>
piece of candy.&quot;  The boy refused and kept on walking. <br/>
<br/>
A few moments later, refusing to take, &quot;no&quot; for an answer, <br/>
the man driving the car pulled over again.  &quot;How about twenty <br/>
dollars and two pieces of candy?&quot;  The boy told the man to leave <br/>
him alone and kept walking. <br/>
<br/>
Still further down the road the man pulled over to the side of <br/>
the road and said, &quot;Okay, this is my final offer.  I&#39;ll give you <br/>
fifty dollars and all the candy you can eat.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The little boy stopped, walked up to the car, leaned into the <br/>
window and said, &quot;Look, you bought the piece-of-junk, Dad. <br/>
You&#39;ll have to live with it.&quot; <br/>
