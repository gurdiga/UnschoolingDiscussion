<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452928976">This is a excerpt from John Holt&#39;s &quot;Escape From Childhood&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
______________________________________________________<br/>
The words &quot;expect&quot; and &quot;expectation&quot; are on the whole badly misunderstood<br/>
and misused by most people who write about children. Most people use them<br/>
as synonyms for &quot;demand&quot; or &quot;insist&quot; or &quot;compel.&quot; When they say we should<br/>
have higher expectations of children they mean that we should demand that<br/>
they do certain things and threaten to punish them if they do not. When I<br/>
speak of expecting a lot of children, I only mean that we should not in<br/>
our minds put an upper limit on what they may be able to do. I don&#39;t mean<br/>
we should assume that they can, and therefore should, do certain things<br/>
or be disappointed and worried if they do not - everyone has his own path<br/>
and timetable into life. I do mean that we should not assume that there<br/>
are things that they cannot do or be astonished and even threatened when<br/>
they do them. We should be open to their way of growing, whatever it may<br/>
be. With this understanding of the world, I believe that if we expected<br/>
more from children, and they from themselves, they would be able to learn<br/>
much more about the world around them, much more quickly, then they do<br/>
now. or, to put it differently, they would go on exploring and learning<br/>
after the age of three as eagerly and capably as they did in their first<br/>
three years.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Young people should have the right to control and direct their own<br/>
learning, that is, to decide what they want to learn, and when, where,<br/>
how, how much, how fast, and with what help they want to learn it. To be<br/>
still more specific, I want them to have the right to decide if, when,<br/>
how much, and by whom they want to be taught and the right to decide<br/>
whether they want to learn in a school and if so which one and for how<br/>
much of the time.<br/>
<br/>
No human right, except the right to life itself, is more fundamental than<br/>
this. A person&#39;s freedom of learning is part of his freedom of thought,<br/>
even more basic than his freedom of speech. If we take from someone his<br/>
right to decide what he will be curious about, we destroy his freedom of<br/>
thought. We say, in effect, you must think not about what interests and<br/>
concerns you, but about what interests and concerns us.<br/>
<br/>
We might call this the right of curiosity, the right to ask whatever<br/>
questions are most important to us. As adults, we assume that we have the<br/>
right to decide what does or does not interest us, what we will look into<br/>
and what we will leave alone. We take this right largely for granted,<br/>
cannot imagine that it might be taken away from us. Indeed, as far as I<br/>
know, it has never been written into any body of law. even the writers of<br/>
our Constitution did not mention it. They thought it was enough to<br/>
guarantee citizens the freedom of speech and the freedom to spread their<br/>
ideas as widely as they wished and could. it did not occur to them that<br/>
even the most tyrannical government would try to control people&#39;s minds,<br/>
what they thought and knew. That idea would come later, under the<br/>
benevolent guise of compulsory universal education.</div>
