<div id="ygrps-yiv-1916228667">That is exactly what I was thinking Pam....on TechTV they have a commercial for a college where you can become a video game designer or something.  They say something in it like &quot;...and my mom said my video games would never amount to anything&quot;.  My son looked at me and said &quot;poor kid&quot;.  That felt great -- to know I am a mom who doesn&#39;t say that to her son -- to know my son isn&#39;t treated the way so many are when it comes to video games.  My son does dream of designing video games, but even if he didn&#39;t, all his game playing is a-okay with me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do this Tuesday/Thursday thingee (it was started to be a type of <br/>
&quot;freeschool&quot;, but is working more like a co-op but with free choice, on <br/>
my blog I use the term perpetual recess) and one of my son&#39;s first <br/>
questions was &quot;can we play video games?&quot; My response was &quot;of course, the <br/>
whole idea is for the community members to choose what they want to do <br/>
there. That includes video and just hanging out.&quot; My idea was that a <br/>
structured activity has just as much value as playing VGs and hanging <br/>
out as long as it is the child&#39;s choice.<br/>
What a can of worms.<br/>
My whole focus this year has been to preserve the rights of the gamer <br/>
kids to make their choices free of interference from some of the other <br/>
moms while staying sane and not saying things to ruin long friendships. <br/>
With some folks being tolerant only seems to go one way when it has to <br/>
do with electronic media. Now these moms have no problem if the kids are <br/>
playing Magic or Heroscape, they just wish that the kids had never <br/>
chosen to play video games there (some of the issues have to do with the <br/>
controls they place on their children and the fact that their kids at <br/>
times would prefer to be in the gamer room then go to another activity) <br/>
and are quite vocal about it and have made my son, at times, feel like <br/>
he had done something wrong by even starting the gamers group.<br/>
Of course I have noticed that kids like my son will move from thing to <br/>
thing (like an ethnic cooking lesson or boffer swords---as long as it is <br/>
something he is interested in doing) because he is already aware that <br/>
the video games will always be there, he can play whenever he wants to <br/>
and he&#39;ll be able to play at home. Some of the other boys have had a <br/>
hard time because their moms will control the amount of time they can <br/>
play and they either are not allowed at home OR their VG time is limited <br/>
at home. It has gotten better for these guys as they see that every time <br/>
we get together the VG will be available, but some of the moms are so <br/>
focused on those evil video games that the have a hard time seeing that <br/>
the kids do choose to leave the games and go do something else when it <br/>
strikes their interest.<br/>
I feel for those other kids---they are kids I&#39;ve seen grow up and I <br/>
really like. What they want to do, what they think is important is not <br/>
valued by the adults most important to them.<br/>
It sucks.<br/>

of safe-ish swords for DH and DS to use. Plastic and wood and all are <br/>
out (ouch!) and the paper ones (DH can make an interesting sword-like <br/>
object with sheets from a big roll of brown paper) tend to self <br/>
destruct after a bit of banging. <br/>
<br/>
Also, on the video game thing - DS and DH get together with another <br/>
family of hsers (3 boys around DS&#39; age) once a week, the kids run <br/>
around and play, DH and the mom play long games of SCrabble or <br/>
Rummikub or whatever. It was originally intended to alternate houses <br/>
each week. Then they came over to our house and the boys played video <br/>
games all afternoon and didn&#39;t want to leave (they&#39;re very limited on <br/>
VG at their house). The mom has since made sure that the kids meet at <br/>
their house, not our house. Of course,that means we don&#39;t have to tidy <br/>
or anything which is okay by us but we think it&#39;s pretty silly.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091197053">My 14 yo daughter currently goes to a homeschool karate class at noon <br/>
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is a second room at the studio and the <br/>
kids hang out there all the rest of the day and play games - then she <br/>
goes to another karate class at 7:30 pm.<br/>
<br/>
There are a dozen or so kids who spend time there - mostly boys ages 12 <br/>
to 20. They play Risk, card games like Magic, the Gathering, they play <br/>
video games, they play physical games like dodge ball, and they &quot;just <br/>
talk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love this. I so appreciate the karate studio owner - an unschooling <br/>
mom - who lets this happen there. Her kids (12 and 16) hang out, too, <br/>
most of the time - but sometimes they go do other things, and she still <br/>
lets the game time go on. It is so wonderful for the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-847313474">I&#39;ll jump in briefly here and just say that my 17-year-old DD goes out and<br/>
fights with the boys every weekend with this sort of equipment, and has a<br/>
grand time beating them up.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
She likes to use the shafts from broken graphite golf clubs in place of the<br/>
PVC pipe, as it yields a lighter-weight, more maneuverable sword (and also<br/>
reduces the chance of injury - PVC can be heavy!).  Just make sure that you<br/>
are working with graphite, and not a metal shaft.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was one of the founding members, along with Tuckervill, of an <br/>
inclusive support group here in Little Rock. It has mostly been made up <br/>
of relaxed homeschoolers and unschoolers. One of the things have talked <br/>
about for years is having a&quot;space&quot; to hang out, having meetings in and <br/>
do activities that are not great for someone&#39;s home.<br/>
One of the other founding members of Live and Learn began working at an <br/>
after school care program at their church which had a lot of unused <br/>
space. She asked them if it could be rented and they were willing to <br/>
rent it at a very, very cheap price. We have one main room that was once <br/>
their sanctuary, a kitchen, den, 2 &quot;classrooms&quot; and use of the gym, <br/>
playground and grounds. We&#39;re there from 10ish to about 2:30 on Tuesdays <br/>
and Thursdays and we have a $20 a month fee. We decided not to be <br/>
affiliated with our support group, but most of the members of the <br/>
Homeschool Zone come from there. I think we have 15 - 20 families who pay.<br/>
<br/>
I call it perpetual recess which is a title I stole from an article in <br/>
HEM last year about a co-op in the northeast. Our initial idea was to <br/>
have a part-time &quot;free-school&quot; type of situation. We soon realized that <br/>
in this part of the country a freeschool was not gonna happen and its <br/>
become more like a very loosely run co-op. We&#39;ve found that in this part <br/>
of the country even a loosely run, non-religious, non-corrosive, <br/>
free-choice, its-ok-to-hang-out-and-play-video-games-all-day co-op has a <br/>
hard time attracting members. Everyone is just too busy &quot;homeschooling&quot; <br/>
and if they are going to do something that might take time out of their <br/>
&quot;school day&quot; it had better fill some kind of educational need.<br/>
~meh~<br/>
So we have a weekly schedule that comes out via email. This week&#39;s <br/>
schedule looked like this:<br/>
10-? Music Morning (one of the moms brings her accordion and auto harp <br/>
and will play tunes for us to sing to. Yesterday it was Beatles songs <br/>
and then she began teaching another mom who to play the autoharp)<br/>
During this time &quot;doll club&quot; was happening and video games were being <br/>
played also.<br/>
There was also moms sitting around talking, Tuckervill was in town so it <br/>
was nice to sit and talk to her about the baby. We talked some abut the <br/>
funshop I&#39;m gonna try and do at the Live and Learn conference. I think <br/>
the girls went outside at some point to ride scooters.<br/>
11:45 Lunch<br/>
12:45 Cartooning  (I&#39;m meeting with some kids and moms who want to work <br/>
on drawing cartoons. We&#39;re all working out of different books and off <br/>
and on I&#39;ll point out something, but its fun just to work with others) <br/>
during this time moms with younger kids went to the playground.<br/>
The rest of the day kids played and hung out. I know at some point there <br/>
were a few guys out front hacking and slashing with boffer swords. I <br/>
know they went to the gym for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday is like this:<br/>
10ish Old Tyme show and tell (bring in antiques and heirlooms and talk <br/>
about them...this is facilitated by a 9yr old girl)<br/>
10:45 Digital scavenger hunt   (this is being facilitated by an 11 yr <br/>
old. He is coming up with a list and we will break into groups with a <br/>
van and digital camera and go find what is on his list. Afterwards we <br/>
will come back and look through the pics to see who found what.)<br/>
11:45ish Lunch<br/>
1:00 Cheerleading (one of our moms does this and we have this group of <br/>
little girls who just adore it)<br/>
<br/>
Most days have more in them. I like the lightly scheduled days, but a <br/>
good amount of members just won&#39;t come if there is nothing scheduled. <br/>
They miss the best days at the Zone because those days end up being so <br/>
much better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like fun, huh?<br/>
For us it is---we have all we need there in an endless supply of boys <br/>
(and some girls) who will hang out with Josh and play VG or boffer <br/>
swords. Sometimes he will get out Heroscape and play that. He does the <br/>
cartooning with me and if there is some type of theater thing (like <br/>
imporv) going on will join in those classes. The truth is it is more <br/>
stressful for me. I make the schulde and deal with the complaints that <br/>
there is not &quot;anything I can&#39;t do at home. Why would I miss a day of <br/>
school to do something I can do at home with my kids?&quot;---arrggghhh, then <br/>
plan something you find value in and see if anyone else wants to do it. <br/>
I really think that this would be the case among any group of folks who <br/>
have some very distinct differences in how they raise their children and <br/>
how they homeschool. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is working, there is just <br/>
always a group of folks with in any homeschooling thing I&#39;ve ever been <br/>
involved in who want so much but want everyone else to do the work.<br/>
~sheesh~<br/>
I also spend time running interference for Josh and the moms who have <br/>
problems with VG.<br/>
This was our 1st year and over the summer we will go to just Thursdays <br/>
and discuss what worked and what did not work this year. One thing that <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed is that the child facilitated activities seem to be better <br/>
attended and enjoyed, I also have seen a few flop because the child <br/>
facilitating had no support from their parent.<br/>
We also have a lack of teens. I hope we can work on getting more <br/>
families with older kids involved next year.<br/>
