<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180511533">Dear Unschooling-dotcom list members:<br/>
<br/>
Hello. I am not selling anything. What I&#39;m offering is a free <br/>
resource.<br/>
<br/>
I run the list <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:BooksAboutGirls@yahoogroups.com">BooksAboutGirls@yahoogroups.com</a>, and we have just <br/>
started a comprehensive reading of the &quot;American Girls&quot; books. (I&#39;m <br/>
sure you all are familiar with these books, but to jog your memory if <br/>
not, they are the books focusing on certain girls during different <br/>
periods of American history.)<br/>
<br/>
Through our discussions of these books, we will be generating <br/>
questions and activities that may be good for homeschooling (or <br/>
unschooling) parents and homeschooled (or unschooled) children who <br/>
are working with these books. (BooksAboutGirls is family-friendly, so <br/>
children and adolescents can <br/>
subscribe safely.)<br/>
<br/>
I have a detailed Reading Schedule posted in the &quot;Files&quot; section of <br/>
the BooksAboutGirls site (which is at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BooksAboutGirls/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/BooksAboutGirls/</a> ), but here is a <br/>
shortened version of the schedule, showing the dates, the American <br/>
Girl, and the historical period corresponding to that fictional <br/>
figure. If you and your children are studying any of these <br/>
historical periods, please consider joining the list together! (I&#39;ve <br/>
listed information and subscription URLs below.)<br/>
