<div id="ygrps-yiv-810353009">I don&#39;t think unquestioning or instant obedience is a useful trait to teach<br/>
young humans who are going to need to be their own masters before any of us<br/>
parents are ready. :) We&#39;re in this to teach life skills, and who wants a<br/>
bunch of obedience adults running around? Look where that gets us! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think obedience is a fine thing to teach dogs and horses, however.<br/>
<br/>
Respect to me boils down almost entirely to the golden rule, karma, or<br/>
whatever else we want to call it: Treat others as you would like to be<br/>
treated, because that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen anyway. (Hmm, maybe we should<br/>
call that Golden Karma &lt;eg&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
So, if your husband &quot;obeys&quot; the children -- i.e, complies with their<br/>
reasonable requests for time, attention, things, &quot;instantly&quot; he may find<br/>
that sooner or later the children will respect him in the same way. (Maybe<br/>
not, personalities will differ).<br/>
<br/>
If your husband breaks promises (intentionally or through forgetfulness),<br/>
says, &quot;in a minute&quot; and forgets (I&#39;m horribly guilty of that one because I<br/>
have a hard focus, it&#39;s something I&#39;m trying VERY hard to retrain myself<br/>
on), says, &quot;you didn&#39;t say please&quot; to them but doesn&#39;t say &quot;please&quot; when he<br/>
asks them for something, or expects them to give a great deal more than they<br/>
get from him (or even AS MUCH as they get -- the balance from a parent<br/>
giving time or attention or services to a young child is necessarily much<br/>
greater than the reciprocal), it all boils down to reasonable and<br/>
unreasonable expectations.<br/>
<br/>
In this household, kindness and safety and honesty (my work in progress) are<br/>
the key points. Obedience doesn&#39;t even make the top 10, except for the<br/>
puppy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; Subject: What is respect?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My husband and I are at odds (not uncommon) about wether the kids are<br/>
&gt; respectful or disrespectful. I think my husband confuses obedience with<br/>
&gt; respect. Just because the kids don&#39;t immediately obey, my husband gets upset<br/>
&gt; because they don&#39;t respect me. I feel they do respect me, just don&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; obey. So, how does one show respect? Is disobedience always a sign of<br/>
&gt; disrespect? I mean the kids do obey, just not right away. I think we have a<br/>
&gt; great amount of respect for one another, but don&#39;t want to be fooling<br/>
&gt; myself. I love the various opinions and advice from all of you and thank you<br/>
&gt; for your help in advance. :)<br/>

family as well.  I know a lot of people who think discipline is the most <br/>
important family value.  <br/>
I respect a lot of people but I don&#39;t always do what they want when they <br/>
want.  People are always so amazed when my son is so polite in asking for <br/>
things and saying thank you. I&#39;ve always spoke to him that way. In fact I <br/>
never &#39;taught&#39; him to be polite.  But there was a very recent time when my <br/>
manners slipped and, surprise, so did his.<br/>

  From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:starsuncloud@...">starsuncloud@...</a> <br/>
  So can you see why we are saying &quot;that&#39;s not respectful to children&quot; and you <br/>
  aren&#39;t getting it?<br/>
  And why it seems ludicrous when you say that you only hang out with, and are <br/>
  around people that are respectful to children when most parents are NOT.<br/>
  Your definition of respect is not one that is accepted by most members at <br/>
  this list.<br/>
  And therein lies the crux of the problem I think.<br/>
  Maybe you ought to get the feel of the views here before trying to convince <br/>
  other people that your views are just as valid.<br/>
<br/>
  So you&#39;ve been living on your own since you were 15 Myranda?<br/>
  I think your life has been rougher than you want to admit, and by comparison <br/>
  your home is respectful of children.<br/>
  That doesn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t do a whole lot of thinking and changing and <br/>
  try to understand the DEEP level of respect that is being discussed here.<br/>

you think children should be respected over and above adults, while I think <br/>

<br/>
How did you come to this faulty conclusion?<br/>
Seems that if you think an adults right to hit a child is equal to a child&#39;s <br/>
right to enjoy safety, you DON&#39;T have the level of respect for children that <br/>
is being advocated here.<br/>
<br/>
Let me go on......<br/>
Your son has a vision problem that prevents him from owning a game boy?<br/>
I have a hard time with that. Could you tell us specifically what the ailment <br/>
or problem is that would make it impossible for him to EVER play a gameboy <br/>
but make other video games alright?<br/>
Was it simply one doctor&#39;s opinion that you are willing to live by? Or is <br/>
this a real live problem that would truly damage him?<br/>
Respect for a child in my book means problem solving ways to get them the <br/>
items they need/want.<br/>
When he was at the store, asking for a gameboy, or any other item, was the <br/>
answer &quot;You really want that, don&#39;t you? Let&#39;s think of a way to make it <br/>
work, because I don&#39;t have the money right now&quot;<br/>
Helping children have access to this world is respect. Not above mine <br/>
(although with young children you damn well better be able to put your own <br/>
needs on hold a lot of the time) but then, if I want something, I don&#39;t have <br/>
to ask someone bigger than I for said item.<br/>

a child&#39;s right to living without pain supercedes an adult&#39;s right to cause<br/>
the child pain.<br/>

I guess that&#39;s up to the moderator. I personally don&#39;t think Myranda HAS <br/>
been disruptive, she&#39;s just answering questions that people keep asking. If <br/>
people don&#39;t want the answers she has, they shouldn&#39;t ask. IMO.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From a moderator&#39;s perspective, what I&#39;m seeing is a case where people think<br/>
they&#39;re discussing the same issue but they aren&#39;t. And the result is too<br/>
many questions, too many replies in too short a space of time. To me that&#39;s<br/>
not disruption. It&#39;s just ... messy.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeing frustration with not being understood boiling over into behavior<br/>
that is ... not conducive to communication -- to put it mildly. :-/<br/>
<br/>
*No one* can adequately reply to this volume of mail. Things will get said<br/>
in haste that seemed to make sense but would have been reworded -- or not<br/>
said -- if given adequate time to ponder.<br/>
<br/>
As a poster, to me it&#39;s pretty clear what Myranda&#39;s been saying. I have<br/>
disagreements but I&#39;ve seen what she&#39;s trying to say twisted because there<br/>
are too many issues being tangled up together.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s pretty clear it&#39;s difficult to discuss whether or not we have a<br/>
right to object to parenting we disagree with while also discussing what<br/>
type of parenting we should disagree with. Those are two very different<br/>
things and would be more effectively discussed separately.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also difficult to have a successful discussion when words aren&#39;t<br/>
meaning the same thing consistently. As one example, &quot;Do parents have a<br/>
right to choose to parent as they wish&quot; is being interpretted literally<br/>
sometimes and being interpretted to mean &quot;Do parents have a right to choose<br/>
to parent as they wish without interference&quot; other times. There&#39;s<br/>
assumptions being made that one means the other. Sometimes in the reading.<br/>
Sometimes in the writing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people aren&#39;t good at accurately conveying their thoughts with words.<br/>
Sometimes we assume someone else has the same thoughts so we can speak in a<br/>
short of short hand. Some people aren&#39;t good at reading accurately and<br/>
understanding that others may be taking those short cuts or using words<br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
And at this volume of mail even the best are going to have problems. I&#39;ve<br/>
personally barely had time to read it all let alone give enough time to<br/>
actually try to understand what someone else is saying well enough to reply.<br/>
