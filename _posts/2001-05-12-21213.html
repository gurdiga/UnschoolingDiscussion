I sat here picturing (don&#39;t mind me, I got 3 hrs of sleep last night due to<br/>
my dughters birthday<br/>
party clan stayin up all night and not being quiet LOL so the brain ain&#39;t<br/>
on full load yet, ok LOL)<br/>
but I sat here picturing trying to get a lemon ... oh never mind rofl  but<br/>
you cracked me up ;)<br/>
<br/>
i guess one could then tell their hubby Hey honey ...come to bed - cuz Ive<br/>
got that lemon fresh scent LOL<br/>
oh man this girl needs sleep, I will be quiet now - somone bop me please<br/>
rofl<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH HEY HAD AN IDEA :  WANT SOME FEEDBACK PLEASE:<br/>
===============================================<br/>
<br/>
If you had a way to be a part of a group of homeschool (unschool whatever)<br/>
teachers<br/>
thereby giving you the opportunity to get medical & / or dental insurance<br/>
for the same<br/>
rate you would get it from a place of employment - would you do it?<br/>
<br/>
Would you be willing to pay $25 a year above that for the opportunity <br/>
if there were other benefits to being a part of this group too (ie:<br/>
membership card, proving homeschool status for when you need proof for<br/>
someone/somewhere, etc etc etc ) <br/>
<br/>
I have a brain storm happening or a brain fart not sure which yet <br/>
but wanted some feedback to know if I am the only one who has<br/>
medical for my family but no dental due to my hubbys work not offering it<br/>
(ARGH)<br/>
and i know many do without even medical insurance .... it sucks!<br/>
<br/>
So - do know I am not soliciting anyone, I am not going to send you info <br/>
on any programs etc if you respond - I haven&#39;t even looked into the<br/>
doability of it yet<br/>
but am going to try to put it into motion if it would be a help to enough<br/>
others<br/>
that they would let me do it (ya have to have like 50 minimum nowadays to<br/>
get<br/>
any company to give insurance argh)<br/>
<br/>
So - lemme know, ok - THANKS :)<br/>
<br/>

***It&#39;s okay Rita. Childrens&#39; birthday parties do the same thing to me. Not<br/>
the lemon thing, the rummy, lack of sleep humor thing. Sorry, no insightful<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956350011">A PPO and an HMO are not necessarily one and the same.  In fact, there<br/>
aren&#39;t too many health insurances that don&#39;t offer some sort of &quot;break&quot; if<br/>
you use PPOs.  Not all that offer PPO advantages restrict you to the use of<br/>
a PPO, they just don&#39;t pay as much if you use someone who isn&#39;t a preferred<br/>
provider.<br/>
<br/>
Some offer group rates where each party chooses whether or not they want the<br/>
PPO advantage.  Those that choose not to have it either pay a bigger % as a<br/>
co-pay or they have a larger deductible.<br/>
<br/>
You can configure your group policy, particularly if you are dealing with a<br/>
nationwide organization, to fit each region individually also, which is what<br/>
we did when we set them up for various reservation groups.  Lots of sparsely<br/>
populated regions won&#39;t have PPO member providers and even if the insurance<br/>
is a PPO organization they won&#39;t be required in certain areas.<br/>
