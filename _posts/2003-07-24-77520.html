<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777959124">&quot;Sandra, I&#39;ve been reading what you&#39;ve written for almost two years, now.  I&#39;ve<br/>
 often wondered how you got so much wisdom.  Never once did I think you stole<br/>
 your words from someone else.  If someone reads your essays and then what you<br/>
 write on the daily boards and lists they would have no doubt that you live what<br/>
 you say and that your words are your own.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know, sometimes *I* feel like I am a thief. When I&#39;m talking to people at my group, or explaining unschooling at work or writing online, I think &quot;these aren&#39;t MY words, this is what I learned from Sandra/Anne/Joyce/Pam etc...&quot; and I feel somewhat strange as the words pour from my mouth. Like I&#39;m just borrowing them.<br/>
These ladies fueled my passion for self-directed learning. They honed what was in my heart and they gave me a venue for my voice. I am eternally grateful.<br/>
Although I believe these things were in my heart all along, the words were not mine to begin with...I borrow these thoughts/words all the time. <br/>

I know this feeling.  When I was in college I had to write a paper on someone I knew nothing about.  It was so hard because I felt like if I knew nothing about him, then anything I could write I must have gotten from someone else.  What happened was that I used a 4 color pen.  I wrote all the quotes from different books in different colors.  I used a pencil for all my own words.  I was really surprised to find that most of the words were my own.  I don&#39;t know where they came from.<br/>
<br/>
When we live what we&#39;ve learned from someone else, and then go on to teach those lessons to someone else, those lessons come from who we are.  Those words do become ours.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m making sense, but nothing was ours to begin with.  We just make them ours.<br/>

John Holt stirs up some stuff in me that way.<br/>
<br/>
I think when you read something that puts words to what you didn&#39;t have words <br/>
for from some earlier point in your life, you end up reviewing lots of prior <br/>
stuff, and it turns into your own words about your own experiences.  But some <br/>
experiences seem locked up like rocks until someone identifies the individual <br/>
parts of them for you somehow.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it seems to me, anyway.  If it never occurred to &quot;an A student,&quot; <br/>
for example that each A they got kept someone else from being top, they might <br/>
never have thought of how important it might have been for the person who kept <br/>
coming in second or third to be first JUST ONCE.  Of it might never have <br/>
occurred to someone who was great in gym or sports that other kids might have been <br/>
trying MUCH harder and wanting success MUCH more, but just didn&#39;t have the <br/>
talent.   <br/>
<br/>
Reviewing those kinds of things in new light can make it EASY in some ways to <br/>
see what unschooled kids need and need to avoid, and what we can say or point <br/>
out to them to help them be compassionate about other kids&#39; relative talents <br/>
and successes.<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s childhood memories are almost completely closed off, and so <br/>
they don&#39;t have that to draw on and are somewhat at a disadvantage in <br/>
understanding what kids are thinking and feeling.   It&#39;s better if you can remember being <br/>
eight instead of just trusting that you must have been, and having a photo, <br/>
but no real memories.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to just quote a person.  It&#39;s a whole other thing to filter <br/>
your memories through their words or ideas so that you end up maybe saying the <br/>
same things, only behind the words you have vivid real KNOWLEDGE of how that <br/>
worked (or didn&#39;t) in your life and how it is working in your child&#39;s life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041058764">My husband&#39;s childhood memories are extensive and vivid, but his <br/>
childhood was SO different than that our our kids that I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
much they help him.... he is from a little town in Iran.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never felt like he was able to fully comprehend why the girls do <br/>
what they do -- often interprets their behavior in ways that seem very, <br/>
hmmm, &quot;foreign&quot; to me &lt;G&gt;. Luckily he mostly trusts my interpretations <br/>
- it is when we don&#39;t think to talk about it that I sometimes find out <br/>
later that he was on a very different page than I was.<br/>
