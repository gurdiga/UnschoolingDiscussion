<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841074879">hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t know if anyone remembers me here. i&#39;ve moved to st louis, <br/>
missouri now, and my daughter got a little older. i think she&#39;d like <br/>
to do gymnastics, because she is always walking on borders, or <br/>
hanging on bars, or tubling, jumping, etc... i tried taking her to a <br/>
gymnastics class twice now, and both times it was a disaster! she <br/>
loved the place, loved wearing the leotard, loved the mats, and all <br/>
the cool equipment. she run right in, when other kids were making a <br/>
line and walking in like little soldiers, she went wherever she <br/>
wanted and did what she wanted, pretty much ignoring the teacher.. <br/>
she refused to get dressed and leave when the class was done! i <br/>
talked to her before the first class, after it was over, and before <br/>
the second class. i told her that she had to listen to the teacher or <br/>
she couldn&#39;t go. the second time, she really did try - she sat in the <br/>
little circle, listened to the teacher, tried some of the things that <br/>
were shown to her, but did not want to follow the instructions for <br/>
anything, and soon started to go off on her own again. there is <br/>
a &#39;open gym&#39; but it&#39;s only once a MONTH. no teachers want her in <br/>
their class! i tried showing her some of the stretches and such at <br/>
home, but she just does not want to do it the way i show her, and i <br/>
can see how this would frustrate a teacher! i feel like crying. i <br/>
KNOW she could be so good at this, and really enjoy it, and finally <br/>
make friends, but no teacher would want her if she keeps acting like <br/>
this. does anyone else have similar experiences, where they succeded? <br/>
or some other advise? besides her loving gymnastics-like activities <br/>
and her needing excercise, she also needs to have something that she <br/>
does weekly with the same small group of kids, so that she can have <br/>
friends to invite to her fourth birthday party. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whenever I&#39;ve thought this I&#39;ve been seriously wrong because I&#39;m seeing what<br/>
could be if my daughter were different, not what my daughter is really<br/>
asking for. If she could enjoy it, she&#39;d be enjoying it right now. What<br/>
she&#39;s showing you is that she wants to freely explore the equipment on her<br/>
own. Help her find a way to do that!<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t push her into a class before she wants it, then when/if she<br/>
does want a class then she&#39;ll be eager for it. Unschooling is about<br/>
providing opportunities not manipulating things so kids take up the<br/>
opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
I think a better option is finding a homeschool group that meets at a gym<br/>
where kids can freely play. If there isn&#39;t one around, check things out<br/>
yourself at local gyms and boys clubs and YMCAs and so forth and set one up!<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
And in the spring look for groups that meet at a playground.<br/>

&gt; does weekly with the same small group of kids, so that she can have<br/>
&gt; friends to invite to her fourth birthday party.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;ve also found that when there&#39;s a separate agenda from the intent of a<br/>
group that it&#39;s harder to fit into the group and get out of it what the<br/>
group offers.<br/>
<br/>
Look for some play groups and help her play :-) Are you on local<br/>
homeschooling lists? I think you&#39;re overly concerned about friends when you<br/>
are more important to her life right now than anything else. Don&#39;t worry<br/>
about having kids for the party. She&#39;s not old enough to have this fixed<br/>
idea about what a birthday is &quot;supposed&quot; to be. It can be whatever you want.<br/>
She&#39;s probably not going to remember it -- unless you&#39;re all stressed out<br/>
and miserable because you can&#39;t provide her with something she probably<br/>
doesn&#39;t even want! Relax about the friends and help her have fun. Even if<br/>
you don&#39;t say anything, you&#39;ll be projecting a desperate need for something<br/>
and it&#39;s going to affect your daughter and how people react to you and her.<br/>
So take a deep breath and relax. Things will be fine.<br/>

Then you shouldn&#39;t miss the fourth annual Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference that will be coming to Fairview Heights, IL----just over the  <br/>
river---October 6-9, 2005 <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
You can also make a lot of these things at home: railroad ties make good,  <br/>
not-to-high, rather-wide balance beams. Tumbling mats and swinging bars and  <br/>
mini-trampolines should cover all her needs to move.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; she loved the place, loved wearing the leotard, loved  the mats, and all <br/>

MONTH.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Buy lots of pretty leotards. Look at other gyms (or make your own, like I  <br/>
suggested above). She&#39;s *very* little, I wouldn&#39;t expect any child to follow the <br/>
 rules that closely at that age..<br/>
<br/>

can see how this would  frustrate a teacher!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Again---try another gym or just be patient and wait----she&#39;s really little.  <br/>
The teacher is supposed to be there for the CHILD, not the other way around. <br/>
You  could also ask for private lessons, so that she could get the undivided  <br/>
attention of the teacher. Then try group classes when she understands more <br/>
about  class rules. I&#39;d just wait.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or some other advise?  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back off. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;besides her loving gymnastics-like activities <br/>
 </span></blockquote>and  her needing excercise, she also needs to have something that she <br/>
does  weekly with the same small group of  kids,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Did she ask for that? At three? <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never been in a city that didn&#39;t have some kind of toddlers&#39; group  <br/>
(several)---for moms with preschoolers: they get together weekly for park days  <br/>
and such. I&#39;d just look around a bit. Not to mention all the homeschool  <br/>
groups----you should really connect with the groups in your area.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so that she can have friends to invite to her fourth  birthday party. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is really hardly a reason to be pushing this issue. She&#39;ll make  friends <br/>
as she does. If she had friends in her old city, you could even have a  <br/>
long-distance party. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a HUGE party fan, but this is not a good reason to be pushing her to be  <br/>
someone she is not.<br/>
 <br/>
Time. Patience. Maybe her own personal backyard/basement gym. And a  <br/>
homeschool group.<br/>

 <br/>
She&#39;s not ready for a gymnastics class, and she&#39;s showing you.   She&#39;s only <br/>
3.  She has plenty of time to learn how to stand in line and do  what someone <br/>
tells her to.  It&#39;s just not part of the scenario right now,  though.<br/>
 <br/>
Forcing her to do it the teacher&#39;s way and you being disappointed when she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t is only going to make her hate gymnastics.  There&#39;s no hurry  for her <br/>
to learn the stretches and all that.  She&#39;s still so young she&#39;s  made of <br/>
rubber anyway.  <br/>
 <br/>
Take her to the open gym anyway. In our town there are community  centers you <br/>
can walk right into on any given day, get out the tumbling mats and  tumble <br/>
til your heart&#39;s content.  That&#39;s what I&#39;d find for her.  <br/>
 <br/>
And drop the idea of making friends &quot;to invite to her fourth birthday  <br/>
party&quot;.  That&#39;s just creepy.  You want friends because you like them  and they&#39;re <br/>
fun and they like you.  Find a playgroup in your area, or an  unschooling group. <br/>
 Don&#39;t make a deadline to have friends by her birthday  party.  Just make <br/>
friends, with no goal in mind. <br/>
 <br/>
She is ONLY 3.  That is soooo young.  Expect her to keep liking  gymnastics <br/>
(whether she&#39;s good at it or not) as long as you don&#39;t pressure  her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066923253">I agree about providing her more &quot;gym&quot; stuff at home.<br/>
Take her to parks with climbing equipment.<br/>
Maybe find a teen who has done tumbling and pay her to play with your kid <br/>
once a week.  It could be like private lessons, but I would say to the kid that <br/>
if the little girl doesn&#39;t want to do something, not to press.  It would be <br/>
okay with me if the session turned into playing with dolls or looking at bugs.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe get some exercise videos or take a yoga class together.<br/>
<br/>
Finding a playgroup where families get together would still net her some <br/>
contacts, but she wouldn&#39;t be thrust into a group situation without her mom.<br/>

&gt; a &#39;open gym&#39; but it&#39;s only once a MONTH. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with what others have said about a class not being right for <br/>
her right now. There are different gyms with different attitudes and <br/>
different types of classes. We first went to a local cheap class when <br/>
ds was 2 and the teachers were idiots. Then we went to Gymboree--far <br/>
away and expensive--and the teachers actually knew how to interact <br/>
with different types of kids and it was great (and they don&#39;t force <br/>
kids to join in the activities). If you have one anywhere near you, <br/>
check it out! You don&#39;t have to join at the beginning of one of their <br/>
sessions--if they have room in a class, you can join half way through <br/>
and pay a pro-rated amount. They also have open gym-type classes <br/>
weekly. And you get to try a class for free. Can you tell I miss it?<br/>
<br/>
The local MOMS Club arranged something recently at a local gym where <br/>
there were things for babies/toddlers to do with moms and at the same <br/>
time, the older kids could go off to the other end of the gym for a <br/>
class. It was wonderful for me, because usually there&#39;s a class for <br/>
one kid while the other kid is supposed to be waiting! Anyway, my <br/>
point was going to be that if there&#39;s not currently an opportunity <br/>
for 3 year olds to have an open gym weekly, talk to people, see if <br/>
you can round up a demand for it and then ask the gym if they have <br/>
time for it.<br/>
<br/>
no teachers want her in <br/>
&gt; their class! i tried showing her some of the stretches and such at <br/>
&gt; home, but she just does not want to do it the way i show her, and i <br/>
&gt; can see how this would frustrate a teacher! i feel like crying. i <br/>
&gt; KNOW she could be so good at this, and really enjoy it, and finally <br/>
&gt; make friends, but no teacher would want her if she keeps acting <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; this. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like this is really important to you for this to happen, <br/>
but she&#39;s pretty clearly saying this is not what she wants right now. <br/>
She has many years to learn gymnastics. She doesn&#39;t need to feel like <br/>
a failure at age three! Her activities should be easy for her and <br/>
fun, not forced. When she&#39;s ready, it will be clear. <br/>
<br/>
When we went to this MOMS Club class recently, I was really not sure <br/>
if ds would go off with the teacher or if he&#39;d prefer to stay with <br/>
me. Okay, I assumed he&#39;d stay with me, honestly, based on other <br/>
experiences! I was filling out paperwork when the teacher came over <br/>
looking for any more 4 year olds. He went off with her and never <br/>
glanced back once in 45 minutes. The room was huge and most of the <br/>
time I could barely see him. They told me he was wonderful and &quot;so <br/>
advanced&quot; and could and would do everything they asked. At 2-3, he <br/>
would run screaming from the teachers if they tried to talk to him. <br/>
He&#39;s ready now, he wasn&#39;t then.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if you want to buy stuff for home, <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.discountschoolsupply.com">http://www.discountschoolsupply.com</a> has better prices than other <br/>
places I&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 and 4 year olds love the video &quot;Yoga for Kids&quot;, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947082975">thanks for writing back everyone. <br/>
<br/>
and thank you SO much for telling me the conference is so close to my <br/>
new home, i will definately start making plans.<br/>
<br/>
i think a big part of my problem is that i lack support. both my <br/>
relatives and my husband are fans of &#39;authority&#39;. they are humouring <br/>
me as much as they can, but is i veer off course, they would cheer. <br/>
so it&#39;s great to have all of you to tell me to back off and let the <br/>
kid be.<br/>
<br/>
i am trying to get in touch with local groups, and also thinking <br/>
about creating a gym in my basement. maybe it does seem creepy that <br/>
one of my goals is for her to make friends, but she seems to really <br/>
want friends - she is hugging little kids she meets at the grocery <br/>
store or the indoor play space we go to! <br/>
<br/>
i do take her to outdoor playgrounds when it&#39;s warmer. and there seem <br/>
to be a few gyms in the area that i&#39;ll check out. taking a yoga class <br/>
with her may not work for the same reasons gymnastics isn&#39;t working, <br/>
don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
what do you mean she was &#39;without her mom&#39;? she was not scared and <br/>
ran right in, and i was right where she could see me the whole time, <br/>
and she could come to me - and did - when she needed. <br/>
<br/>
i have tried getting a kids yoga video, but it was loud and had too <br/>
many bright colors and the &#39;actors&#39; seemed embarassed to be doing <br/>
yoga, and tried to pretend it was really all about hip hop and <br/>
jumping around. can any of you recommend good yoga or other exercise-<br/>
type videos?<br/>
<br/>
see, the reason i thought it would work is that she doesn&#39;t usually <br/>
act &#39;young&#39;. she can mostly explain why she doesn&#39;t like or want <br/>
something, and can say &#39;no&#39; to things. she keeps saying &#39;yes&#39; to <br/>
gymnastics, she keeps saying &#39;i want to go back, i promise i will <br/>
stay with teacher&#39;.. sigh. i am going to try one more class that&#39;s <br/>
designed for younger children and where i can participare with her. <br/>
if not, then maybe we&#39;ll try again when she&#39;s 4 or 5.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again for the help!<br/>

 Hi, I just wanted to let you know I live near St. Louis, also, and we have a group that tries to get together each week that ranges in ages from around 7 years old down to babies.  It&#39;s a very unstructured group, we just make plans as we go, so some weeks we don&#39;t get together at all, especially around the holidays, but have recently started  meeting up again.  I have a daughter that will be 4 in February and also a baby who is 6 weeks old.  If you are interested, here&#39;s the link the the Yahoo group, we&#39;d love to meet you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If your dd really wants to do a gymnastics class, find one that is more<br/>
suited to her and her natural exploration, especially at her age.  Frankly,<br/>
I don&#39;t think the structure of gymnastics really applies until the kids can<br/>
pay attention to the techniques, and that&#39;s maybe 6 or 7... but that&#39;s just<br/>
my casual observation of the classes we used to attend with my own dd.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 3 she happened to see a class, and wanted to join.  It was<br/>
designed for young toddlers, and wasn&#39;t even called gymnastics - it was<br/>
called tumbling.  The teacher put out all of the same equipment at<br/>
different stations, and each Mom casually and naturally manned the station<br/>
to help out.  There were no lines, no hassles with the kids, no techniques<br/>
required.  The kids were able to move about however they wanted, from<br/>
station to station - or over and over in the same place.  This is probably<br/>
what people are calling &#39;open gym&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The teacher that offered this class ran her classes pretty much like this<br/>
until the kids got more serious themselves (and also until they had been in<br/>
school and were used to the &quot;routine&quot;.)  But, but the class wasn&#39;t designed<br/>
for serious competition gymnastics.  She wanted it to be fun for the kids.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t offer the youngster class at the moment because she has 2 young<br/>
kids of her own now and can&#39;t afford the time away... otherwise my dd would<br/>
still be there.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to encourage you to not care what the teacher thinks.  It&#39;s<br/>
much more important what your dd thinks, you want to support her not the<br/>
teacher.  We&#39;re so ingrained to &quot;respect&quot; teachers as the authorities, but<br/>
unfortunately they can often stifle the natural interest and learning<br/>
talents of our kids.  If a teacher doesn&#39;t want your child in their class,<br/>
think of it as a blessing and know that the truth is probably that you<br/>
don&#39;t want the teacher.<br/>

ps.  Hi everyone.  I&#39;m back, hopefully for awhile.  I&#39;ve been on this list<br/>
for several years now, but mostly too busy  but lurking or on nomail<br/>
because of training that I&#39;ve been doing for a new career as a bodyworker.<br/>
My DH and I have one daughter who is just 6, and we live in N. Calif, North<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591436670">&lt;&lt;&lt;what do you mean she was &#39;without her mom&#39;?.... i am going to try one<br/>
more class that&#39;s designed for younger children and where i can participare<br/>
with her. if not, then maybe we&#39;ll try again when she&#39;s 4 or 5.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I gathered that this was the kind of thing people meant in comparing &quot;with&quot;<br/>
or &quot;without&quot; Mom - Mom participating and being right beside her, rather than<br/>
in the waiting area, even if visible.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn (now 5) began her dance classes, two years ago, it was with a<br/>
bunch of little girls she already knew from our homeschooling park days.<br/>
However I still had to sit in the dance room (above the garage in the<br/>
house), where she could come to me and sit if she needed to. The dance<br/>
teacher, whose goal is &quot;fostering children&#39;s creativity and love of movement<br/>
in a non-judgmental environment&quot; was completely understanding of this<br/>
breaking of her usual procedure. Over the first year I moved from being in<br/>
the room, to on the stairs, then in the second year down to the living room<br/>
below (another rule broken), and now finally Jayn runs off into the house<br/>
with no concerns at all and I chat with the other parents outside.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;i have tried getting a kids yoga video, but it was loud and had too <br/>
many bright colors and the &#39;actors&#39; seemed embarassed to be doing <br/>
yoga, and tried to pretend it was really all about hip hop and <br/>
jumping around. can any of you recommend good yoga or other exercise-<br/>
type videos?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jayn and I have a couple of Yoga Zone videos, very much gentle moving and<br/>
twisting, and our absolute favorite is Rodney Yee and his associates - &quot;Yoga<br/>
for Beginners&quot; - &quot;AM/Stress Relief/PM&quot; very serene and gentle. The DVD<br/>
version includes all three sessions, and a section on how to use the tools<br/>
which is very helpful. Jayn will usually encourage us to do a good hour of<br/>
it. If it is jumping about it is a different kind of Yoga - some of the<br/>
traditions are very active and athletic.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn dances to the music in her ordinary dvd&#39;s, especially the credits of<br/>
some of them. It is the music that is important to her, rather than the<br/>
viduals. I don&#39;t think she is remotely willing to sacrifice her personal<br/>
choreography for the sake of following someone else&#39;s in a dvd. <br/>
