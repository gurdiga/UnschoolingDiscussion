<div id="ygrps-yiv-712681911">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;i&#39;ve read about miquon math from two different<br/>
sources, but i&#39;ve never<br/>
actually seen one of the activity books, and so i<br/>
don&#39;t know exactly<br/>
what they&#39;re like.  has anyone here ever used them? <br/>
and if so, how did<br/>
you fit them in with your approach to unschooling?<br/>

We have Miquon math books and Cuisenaire Rods around<br/>
the house. When Tamzin gets an urge to &#39;do math&#39;, this<br/>
is what she goes for. She loves the combination of<br/>
using the rods with the workbooks. She has even<br/>
memorized (after the first time using them) which<br/>
colour rods represent which number! When we&#39;re doing<br/>
it together I have to ask her which rod equals what<br/>
(cause I sure can&#39;t be bothered to keep track!). I<br/>
find them easier for me to use because it&#39;s based on<br/>
centimetres, and I think in metric.<br/>
