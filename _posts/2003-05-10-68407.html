<div id="ygrps-yiv-843411865"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; And I also loved &quot;My Father&#39;s Dragon.&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; had forgotten about that one until I saw it at a thrift store and a million<br/>
&gt; memories came flooding back into my head...There were 3 books in the<br/>
&gt; series...nice pictures too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard to find the three books (My Father&#39;s Dragon, Elmer and the Dragon,<br/>
and The Dragons of Blueland), but recently I purchased all three bound<br/>
together in hardback for a reasonable price.  Wonderful stories!<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas:<br/>
Little House on the Prairie series<br/>
Magic Treehouse series<br/>
Trumpet of the Swan<br/>
Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles (another Julie Andrews Edwards book)<br/>
From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (Konigsberger)<br/>
anything by Edward Eager!<br/>
Tomie de Paola has four chapter books out that are autobiographical<br/>
the Raggedy Ann and Andy chapter books, which are being republished in<br/>
hardback.<br/>
<br/>
Happy reading!<br/>
