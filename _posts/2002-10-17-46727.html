<div id="ygrps-yiv-403261607">Yes,  my 9 year old gets looks from older girls and they are so nice to him.  Too nice in my opinion!  My kids have the big blue eyes,  people used to say to my husband, &quot;that&#39;s so sick, get those colored contacts out!&quot; and my husband would just laugh because he doesn&#39;t own colored contacts..&lt;g&gt;  We are both Norwegian.  And then through in my half of Irish, wahoo!!<br/>
