<br/>
******<br/>
Be content with what you have;<br/>
rejoice in the way things are.<br/>
When you realize there is nothing lacking,<br/>
the whole world belongs to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794634787">Hi John,<br/>
I enjoyed your quote today ,because I was doing just that. My husband went to <br/>
Florida for a week , he needed a vaca bad. Anyway we have never been away <br/>
from eachother for more than a day. In all of the 11 yrs we have been <br/>
married. He finally came home last night and what  a content feeling I have <br/>
had all night and all this morning. I enjoyed my week off also , but  I think <br/>
I would have enjoyed it much more if he had been with us. Sorry to babble on <br/>
but that one just made me laugh.<br/>
