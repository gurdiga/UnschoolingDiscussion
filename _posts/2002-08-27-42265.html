though. The first time I saw a play, (I was 12) I was hooked. I was visiting <br/>
cousins in Dallas, Tx. and my Aunt took us to see A Midsummer&#39;s Nights Dream <br/>
at the local Shakespeare in the park production. I was so excited, when I <br/>
came home, I checked it out at the library. I was so disappointed, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
read the words, all the stage directions were there... I was miserable, so I <br/>
found a copy that didn&#39;t have all the directions and still, I didn&#39;t *see* in <br/>
the book what I saw on stage. I have tried over the years to read Shakespeare <br/>
and am always left with this feeling that I am not getting it! Maybe someday <br/>
I will find a book on how to read Shakespeare, or someone will show me what I <br/>
am missing. Once a boyfriend tried to help me, he told me to read with my <br/>
heartbeat... (HUH?) &lt;g&gt; <br/>

Don&#39;t forget the recent movie version of A Midsummer&#39;s Night Dream with <br/>
Stanley Tucci as Puck. That was my kids&#39; first Shakespeare and they love it. <br/>
We also read a couple of fabulous picture books put together by Bruce <br/>
Coville. One was Midsummer&#39;s Night Dream and the other was Romeo and Juliet. <br/>
They&#39;re all Shakespeare&#39;s words, just abridged and with beautiful <br/>

<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
When I was an English major in college my first Shakespeare test was a big <br/>
bomb.  A friend made flashcards for me.  Still, it wasn&#39;t working.  I <br/>
discovered that the library had plays recorded.  They were on record albums, <br/>
and you would put in a request, sit at a desk with headphones, and a library <br/>
aide would turn the records over.  <br/>
<br/>
That was in the days before videotape was common.<br/>
<br/>
So I would read along as Richard Burton and other Shakespearean actors read <br/>
the plays, sometimes with sound effects like wind blowing, footsteps, doors <br/>
closing...  And THEN it made sense.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays video makes it WONDERFULLY accessible to kids, and unlike going to a <br/>
play, paying money and being expected to sit still, they can pause and go <br/>
play, come back, play some more, re-wind the good parts...<br/>

usually end up on our feet.It gives something of the effect, especially<br/>
once we&#39;ve done a scene a few times. Perhaps it helps that we&#39;re very<br/>
theatrical people... but the words definitely need to be spoken out loud,<br/>

<br/>
No, I don&#39;t even try.  <br/>
<br/>
I can look something up for clarification, or follow along, but if I get to <br/>
reading I miss the cues about who&#39;s in the room, who&#39;s talking AND there are <br/>
few to no clues in the text about how or why things are as they are.  Much of <br/>
the staging is traditional, passed from performance to performance, performer <br/>
to performer.  It&#39;s discussed in college literature classes, and nowadays you <br/>
can read such stuff on the internet, but Shakespeare just in black and white <br/>
in a book is not just like a dead bug on a pin for me, but like a really old, <br/>
dried out dead bug.   <br/>
<br/>
And before someone says I just need to understand it better, I think I DO.  <br/>
The language doesn&#39;t scare me, as I learned to read from the King James Bible <br/>
way more than from Dick&Jane stuff, and I took not the required one, but <br/>
three Shakespeare classes in college and a 17th century literature class so <br/>
I&#39;d know who the heck Marlowe and Jonson were.  But reading them out of the <br/>
book is drudgery and like reading through mud for me.<br/>
<br/>
Watching live performances or video, though, THAT is clear life.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Cool post Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
I love Shakespeare, also studied Shakeskpeare and have an English degree,,blah, blah, blah,&lt;g&gt;  anyway,<br/>
<br/>
We have been watching different Shakespeare movies also,  with my 8 year old daughter.  She loves them.  Much Ado About Nothing,  Romeo and Juliet, a bit of Henry V (a bit slow for her) Shakepeare In Love...<br/>
<br/>
Some people have been quite surprised that a kid would enjoy it, and I respond,  &quot; but some of them are funny!    And most are really interesting!&quot;    They usually look at me like I&#39;m insane or something.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago we went to Twelfth Night,  me, my dd(8) and my dd(6).    It was a really good performance,  really fun.  Abbi (8) liked it so much she went again with her dad,  Kyra(6) fell asleep during the second half,  but enjoyed what she saw.    <br/>
The following week I was talking with a regular in the theater circles and saying that we had gone to the play.  She gets all excited,  &quot;Oh, oh,  you must have been the one with the two little girls!  Joe(an actor) saw kids in the audience and couldn&#39;t believe it.  And then he thought he saw them again!&quot;     &quot;Yep&quot;  I said.<br/>
<br/>
Joe couldn&#39;t believe that a child would actually enjoy Shakespeare!  I kept on saying that there is alot of humor and fast paced action for them.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to get the playhouse to do a Shakepeare play with kids,  but this Joe is the person who would direct and he doesn&#39;t think kids would get into it.    Everytime I see him I say,  when are we going to do it,   huh? huh?   Trying to convince him that with the right explanation and attention, most people can enjoy Shakespeare!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the same vein,  I&#39;m excited because I just picked up Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream on dvd for $5.99!    We&#39;ll be watching it on the way to Columbia!<br/>

Holly and neighbor girl when they were five and six sat down to watch part of <br/>
Twelfth Night with me once when I was sewing, and had set up in front of the <br/>
TV to watch that.  I wound it back so they could see the shipwreck, and I was <br/>
telling them what was happening.  I figured they&#39;d say &quot;Okay, see ya&quot; in a <br/>
bit, but they stayed for MOST of it!<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised.<br/>
<br/>
When we first got Romeo+Juliet, the recent one with Leonardo di Caprio, Kirby <br/>
was 12, I think, and watched it all the way through.  I had suggested a break <br/>
until the next day, but without even looking at me he said, &quot;NO, leave it <br/>
on.&quot;  He wanted to see the rest.  And that one is a long version, too.<br/>
<br/>
We have Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, which is WONDERFUL, but not <br/>
readily available, and not yet on DVD.  That has been fantastic for kids here.  <br/>
It&#39;s not Shakespeare, and yet it totally is.    (It&#39;s by the same guy who <br/>
wrote Shakespeare in Love.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;re trying to get the playhouse to do a Shakepeare play with kids,  but <br/>

Pam Sorooshian&#39;s younger two are in a Shakespeare play right now, and have <br/>
been in and around others.<br/>
<br/>

I really loved this movie.  It healed alot of my PS (12th grade English)<br/>
wounds about Shakespeare. I still watch it when I am in the mood. My<br/>
daughter (12) has watched it more than once with me, she enjoys it almost as<br/>
much as I do.  She has even recommended it to her friends. My 9yo son likes<br/>
parts of it, like the gun fight in the beginning. He likes &quot;fighting with<br/>

An all-region with Korean subtitles?<br/>
<br/>
Methinks this is not an aboveboard production!<br/>
<br/>
Yet... the people who own it should have put it out.  There must be some <br/>
legal wrangling somewhere.  I&#39;ve heard Disney owns it, and that can be bad news as <br/>
to scheduled releases.  And they might not still own it, who knows.<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
El Cid, which I would also love to see on DVD, was released in Europe some <br/>
years back, and it sold out and went out of print.  But it only shows on <br/>
European DVD player settings.<br/>
<br/>
If those are bootlegs, I don&#39;t guess Netflix will be able to rent them; I <br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>

Amazon still says this:<br/>

  &gt; a video store that doesn&#39;t sell or dump everything old.<br/>

Yeah, and I might get one too (though our video is still in fair shape), but <br/>
what I REALLY want is a full-blown DVD with special everything, commentary <br/>

husband works with did that and handed out copies. The quality was lousy. It<br/>
was well worth waiting until pristine copies came out.<br/>
<br/>
But bootlegs of existing movies are good because DVD burners are relatively<br/>
cheap. We inadvertently bought a bootleg of a Japanese kids show.  The<br/>
subtitles were, um, interesting but the picture and sound quality were<br/>
excellent.<br/>

It&#39;s a really wonderful comedy routine by a group called &quot;The Abridged <br/>
Shakespeare Company.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can rent it from Netflix or order it from Amazon.   <br/>
I would tell you more, but it would spoil the surprises.  If you get it, <br/>
watch the bonus stuff too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No. But we really enjoyed &quot;Shakespeare in a Box&quot; by Carl Martin They <br/>
have a couple of them on Amazon. You can have 4 or more actors and a <br/>
director and you get all the stuff you need. We did them at <br/>
Thanksgiving - with all the cousins and aunts and uncles - some <br/>
performing, some being our audience. Takes about 30 minutes to get <br/>
ready and then you perform - I can&#39;t remember exactly how long the <br/>
performance was, it was so much fun, we laughed a lot, it went fast.  <br/>
You get scripts that are made so that you can utilize different numbers <br/>
of actors and instructions how to divide up the parts depending on how <br/>
many people you have. You get director notes and each character gets a <br/>
set of notes. There are some prop items included and, for others, you <br/>
just scrounge from things you have around the house.<br/>
