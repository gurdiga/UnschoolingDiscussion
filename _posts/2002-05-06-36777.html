&lt;&lt;  My 4 yr. ds has a thing for anything construction or mechanical and most <br/>
of the books he chooses from the library are non-fiction as well. my husband <br/>
and I laugh about the fact that a friend had loaned him a book on small <br/>
engine repair and that was Chase&#39;s chosen &quot;bedtime story&quot; for the longest <br/>
time. Glad Dad was the one asked to read it - :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an old Saturday Night Live sketch with Dan Akyroyd and Gilda Radner.  <br/>
He&#39;s a mechanic dad, telling her a bedtime story.  He&#39;s just talking about <br/>
the car repair problems of the day and she&#39;s asking if there was a monster, <br/>
or a witch, and he works them (badly) into the story, and at the end she asks <br/>
a technical question about rings or timing or something.  I think it&#39;s on one <br/>
of their &quot;Best of&quot; tapes, and it&#39;s on the first SNL album.  <br/>
<br/>
In case any of you have lots of that on tape, it was the tenth episode, and <br/>
had some very famous bits in it:<br/>
<br/>
10. Buck Henry/Bill Withers, Toni Basil<br/>
gs: Buck Henry (Himself) Bill Withers (Himself) Toni Basil (Herself) <br/>
<br/>
Sketches include--Suicide Prevention, &quot;Samurai Deli&quot;, Operation Stumblebum, <br/>
&quot;Citizen Kane II&quot;, King Bee(the Blues Brothers), Auto mechanic tells bedtime <br/>
story, &quot;Presidential Foreplay&quot;, Chevy misuses a joint, The Constipated Man, <br/>
The Muppets and the Japanese sex Device.<br/>
<br/>

NOTE: This is Buck Henry&#39;s first appearance as host. He will host nine more <br/>
time in the next five years. Many consider him as one of the Not Ready For <br/>
Prime Time Players instead of just a guest host whenever he appeared.</div>
