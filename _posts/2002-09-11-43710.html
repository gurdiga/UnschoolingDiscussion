<div id="ygrps-yiv-329622030">-- make up stories together about frustrations that happen to kids, make it<br/>
only thinly veiled about him - use his name, even. Let HIM finish the stories<br/>
sometimes - and don&#39;t cringe if he finishes them violently on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
This suggestion reminded me of an event yesterday. Ds, 5.5 is easily and<br/>
frequently frustrated. He explodes into raging fits and tearful breakdowns.<br/>
Yesterday he was hammering a planter box together and really wanted to start<br/>
the nails in himself. He got one in and then tried another. He started<br/>
hammering into a knot in the wood and his nail bent 3 times. He has a full<br/>
size hammer in his hand. He starts pounding with it, crying and I attempt to<br/>
take possesion of the hammer. I asked him once I had secured the tool, what<br/>
his solution was for the bending nail problem. He screamed kill you with the<br/>
hammer. I said I would be all gone and would miss being with him. He crumbled<br/>
into a teary heap and then asked if I would start the nail for him.<br/>
<br/>
Later, after he finished the planter he told me he was just kidding, that he<br/>
was really mad the nail bent. He has now experienced the frustration of<br/>
hammering into really dense wood.<br/>
