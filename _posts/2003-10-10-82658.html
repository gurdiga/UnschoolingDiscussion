<div id="ygrps-yiv-977920037">Is anyone aware of an active unschooling discussion board for <br/>
teenagers? I looked through the various yahoo groups but there <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be any that are active. My daughter just returned <br/>
from the Not Back to School Camp and had such an incredible time and <br/>
she would like a forum in which to connect with other unschooling <br/>
teenagers. Thanks for any help!<br/>

own list and/or board?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829471167">www.unschooling.com has a teen space.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers In Action October 10 - 12:54 pm <br/>
A Place for unschooling kids and teens to hang out and find one another. <br/>

<br/>
That bottom part is the direct address of the teen topics.<br/>
<br/>
People have to be registered at the site to post on kids/teens, but it&#39;s free <br/>
and easy to do.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of that page, &quot;get started&quot; and then click &quot;getting an account.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But they can read without posting.  <br/>
<br/>
If a bunch of us told our kids about it all at once, the whole area might <br/>
perk up a bunch!<br/>
<br/>
They can start their own topics or add to what&#39;s there.  (Maybe you only have <br/>
to be registered to start a new topic, and not just to post.  I don&#39;t know, <br/>
because I&#39;m registered. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t read the teen boards, though.  There&#39;s a <br/>
TON of stuff there for unschooling parents to read, outside the teen area.  The <br/>
address for the main page of the discussion list is:<br/>

<br/>
My daughter is interested in finding other unschooling teens to talk with <br/>
online.  She was not able to go to the NBTSC this year but is already planning <br/>
for next year.<br/>
Would your daughter be interested in corresponding with her?  Her e-mail is <br/>
