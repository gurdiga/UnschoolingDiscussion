THE Texas Board of Education will soon decide which history<br/>
textbooks may be used in the state. Activists on the left<br/>
and right are lobbying the board, to influence its choices.<br/>
<br/>
One text has already been withdrawn because it referred to<br/>
prostitution in frontier towns. A board member felt this<br/>
was inappropriate for high school students to read.<br/>
<br/>
A group called the Texas Public Policy Foundation has<br/>
attacked the simplistic glorification of minority groups<br/>
that is now conventional in American education.<br/>
<br/>
The foundation wants texts modified to tell how African<br/>
chieftains, not Europeans, captured slaves for sale in<br/>
America. It wants to emphasize the role of white Europeans<br/>
in ending slavery. It objects to portrayals of President<br/>
John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as<br/>
civil rights supporters, noting that the brothers refused<br/>
to support the movement at crucial times.<br/>
<br/>
The group also wants texts to say that the Constitution<br/>
protects an individual&#39;s right to own guns and that the<br/>
wealthy pay a disproportionate share of income taxes.<br/>
<br/>
American publishers sell hundreds of millions of dollars<br/>
worth of social studies texts each year. Texas is the<br/>
second-largest buyer in that market, after California.<br/>
Because issuing separate editions for each state is<br/>
expensive, changes required by Texas will affect texts<br/>
everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing new about this. As Frances FitzGerald<br/>
noted in her 1979 book, &quot;America Revised,&quot; since the 1950&#39;s<br/>
&quot;New England children, whose ancestors heartily disapproved<br/>
of the Mexican War, have grown up with heroic tales of Davy<br/>
Crockett and Sam Houston&quot; - not because historians felt the<br/>
war was justified but to appease Texans who decided if<br/>
books were acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
Nor is Texas the only place where schoolbooks have been<br/>
pawns in adult political fights.<br/>
<br/>
A new book by Jonathan Zimmerman, &quot;Whose America?&quot; (Harvard<br/>
University Press, 2002), develops Ms. FitzGerald&#39;s themes.<br/>
Dr. Zimmerman shows how early 20th-century texts described<br/>
the American Revolution as a complex event, including class<br/>
conflict between propertied and poor colonists. Antagonism<br/>
of colonists toward England was played down, and support<br/>
for independence by some Englishmen was highlighted.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Zimmerman says this treatment partly resulted from<br/>
growing numbers of immigrants in schools at the time.<br/>
Educators aimed to get children &quot;Americanized,&quot; defined as<br/>
adopting Anglo-Saxon culture and identity. Demonization of<br/>
King George III would have undermined this goal.<br/>
<br/>
The perspective was reversed in the 1920&#39;s as newly<br/>
powerful Irish immigrant leaders demanded a more<br/>
anti-British stance. William H. Thompson, Chicago&#39;s<br/>
Irish-American mayor, had the city&#39;s school superintendent<br/>
dismissed for using &quot;treasonous&quot; pro-British texts.<br/>
<br/>
The country&#39;s most popular history textbook was then<br/>
revised to remove descriptions of protesters against the<br/>
Stamp Act as a &quot;mob&quot; and of Boston Massacre victims as<br/>
&quot;ruffians.&quot; In New York City, politicians demanded that<br/>
books portray the Revolution as a crusade of other<br/>
nationalities against the British. Minor revolutionary<br/>
figures like the Poles Thaddeus Kosciusko and Casimir<br/>
Pulaski, the Jew Haym Solomon, the Frenchman the Marquis de<br/>
Lafayette and the German Friedrich von Steuben became<br/>
heroes in the curriculum. This multicultural fable remains<br/>
a staple of history texts.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s books, and standardized tests issued by the same<br/>
publishers, not only portray each minority as heroic, but<br/>
every group (and each sex) is airbrushed to eliminate the<br/>
possibility of stereotyping.<br/>
<br/>
Portrayals of African-Americans as maids or athletes<br/>
(except for Jackie Robinson), of women as housewives, of<br/>
Mexicans as farm laborers or of Jews as businessmen are not<br/>
permitted. This ensures that books and tests pass muster<br/>
without objection from officials in Texas and other states<br/>
that also allow schools to buy only approved texts.<br/>
<br/>
Are books now more bland and mythical than before? Perhaps<br/>
not, but they may be more dangerous. In the past, some<br/>
states, districts could dissent and use books with<br/>
different slants from the one in fashion. Teachers who had<br/>
historical sophistication could add their own materials or<br/>
ignore the texts altogether.<br/>
<br/>
But today, curriculums are more standardized, especially as<br/>
we measure all students with similar tests. On the one<br/>
hand, policy makers want teachers to have more knowledge in<br/>
the subjects they teach and more skill in deciding how to<br/>
teach them. On the other, teachers have less freedom to<br/>
design their lessons.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear which tendency will prevail. But if<br/>
standardization wins out, political fights like the one in<br/>
Texas will become ever more influential in determining how<br/>
the myths and realities of history will be told.</div>
