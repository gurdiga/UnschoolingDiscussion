 </span></blockquote>EXCELLENT idea.   And I feel that is what folks should do if they dont like <br/>
what someone is saying.  Everyone&#39;s email has some sort of block or ignore <br/>
function.  Too much gobbledygook mail that is annoying, just block the <br/>
sender.   That leaves the decision up to each member as to how they want to <br/>
deal with others posts.  Again, I dont know exactly what went on, but it <br/>
seems to me, that if one has nobody to argue with, they would eventually stop <br/>
posting.   I would assume there had to be some fuel to the fire for Ned to <br/>
continue posting.   Would he just keep posting to &quot;deaf ears&quot;?  Hmmm, well, <br/>
he might.. lol.. but if he was blocked, how would you know?<br/>

This isn&#39;t about unschooling.<br/>
There are places to go to read Ned&#39;s views if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
Not everyone&#39;s e-mail programs can block.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Too much gobbledygook mail that is annoying, just block the <br/>
sender. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier for me to ask you to save your opinions for things you really <br/>
know about than for some part of 1000 people to try to figure out how to <br/>
block.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think if he came back he&#39;d be different, because a lot of us met him in SC <br/>
and I don&#39;t think he could keep being a pain towards people he actually <br/>
*knew*.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe I underestimate him.  ;)<br/>

Why don&#39;t you go read the archives so that you will better understand what <br/>
many here are referring to when talking about Ned?<br/>
Since you weren&#39;t here and all.<br/>
