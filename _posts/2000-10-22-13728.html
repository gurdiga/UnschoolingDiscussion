<div id="ygrps-yiv-332110127">At least that&#39;s what everyone running for office has been telling us.  And,<br/>
based on what they say, everyone running for office is a champion of<br/>
education.  They love spending time helping teachers in classrooms, walking<br/>
hand-in-hand with children on the soccer fields, and reading books to<br/>
pre-schoolers.  This isn&#39;t just my independent observation, I&#39;ve seen scores<br/>
of pictures to document and prove it.<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  We have great things in store.  Regardless of who wins in November, in<br/>
no time flat we&#39;re destined to be number one in the world in education; what<br/>
with our soon-to-be &quot;dream team&quot; of education-minded politicians.  Surely<br/>
we&#39;re at the dawn of a  golden age of education in the United States.  How<br/>
exciting!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, in the spirit of this euphoria, I present the following link.  It&#39;s a<br/>
pictorial history of education; a tracing of the path up to this point; this<br/>
historic juncture in our great country&#39;s history.  Enjoy:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s wonderful about Gatto&#39;s thinking is a clear understanding that the<br/>
American educational system is based in capitalism -- the &quot;socialism of the<br/>
rich&quot; -- a clear-eyed understanding that the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and<br/>
the Fords unite for their class interests and design a &quot;training&quot; system that<br/>
meets THEIR needs at OUR expense.  That indeed is what is &quot;public&quot; about &quot;public<br/>
education&quot; -- we pay for our own enslavement.<br/>
<br/>
I hope John&#39;s work will put to rest the weird notion that public education is<br/>
some socialist plot.  There were and there are left-leaning teachers and<br/>
professors, but never, even in the height of Dewey&#39;s day (as John points), with<br/>
any control whatsoever over the design of public education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071696621">Dear John,<br/>
    I have been really enjoying your contributions. Thanks! Also I just read <br/>
&quot;Blue Collar Independent Scholar&quot;. I forwarded it to my sister who recently <br/>
graduated from college in Wales and is now back in the States working as a <br/>
nanny like she did before going to college. She&#39;s also auditing classes at <br/>
Cornell.<br/>
     By way of introducing myself to the list, my husband and kids and I have <br/>
been living in the San Francisco Bay area for the past 2 1/2 years. We have <br/>
also lived in Santa Fe, Baltimore and Seattle since becoming a family 16 <br/>
years ago.  My kids are ages 11, 15 & 19. We have been homeschooling for the <br/>
past 13 years. <br/>
