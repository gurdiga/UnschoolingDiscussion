<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792577993"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I&#39;ve never heard anyone else mention having those dreams.  I wonder<br/>

among unschoolers?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard about these dreams from lots of people. I think it&#39;s a pretty <br/>
commom reaction to stress. I guess for lots of people school is the ultimate <br/>
stress metaphor.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And Mary, how in the world do you stop in the middle of your dream<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to say something to yourself?  I don&#39;t ever realize that I&#39;m dreaming until <br/>
after I wake up.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was very cool. Like someone else mentioned, it&#39;s called lucid dreaming. I <br/>
think I have just gotten to the point in my life where I have truly let go <br/>
of the power that things like school have over me. In the dream I actually <br/>
thought it was dumb that I was stressing over an institution like school. <br/>
Even in my subconscious I believe unschooling is best. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
