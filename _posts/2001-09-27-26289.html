As usual, I feel a need to knock myself in the head for not thinking of the<br/>
alternative you offered before I asked.  I think I will change how I am<br/>
looking at the situation.  I really don&#39;t care about &quot;age&quot; per se (one thing<br/>
karate has taught me is how to relate better as equals with kids), but<br/>
physical and mental ability to handle the class.<br/>
<br/>
I also have to remember that I have never taught homeschoolers before, only<br/>
ps kids whose parents paid a tremendous amount of money for them to take<br/>
classes so the kids couldn&#39;t quit if they wanted to.  Of course, all these<br/>
kids are &quot;school at homers&quot; but there does seem to be increased flexibility<br/>
with the parents.  And, I charge only a very minimal fee to help offset the<br/>
cost of equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Next time we do a sign-up I will word things differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953320022">&lt;&lt;what would you do....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;come on over&quot;.  As for the older kid who can&#39;t or won&#39;t keep<br/>
up, I&#39;m fixing to face that challenge in the next week or so.  Working on<br/>
how to handle that.<br/>
