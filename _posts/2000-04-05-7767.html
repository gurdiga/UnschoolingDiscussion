Why is it controversial issues that are non-beneficial to anyone like<br/>
pornography and other so-called &quot;tolerance&quot; issues are permitted as Free<br/>
Speech, but something that can actually bring about positive change and<br/>
improve life for our children and families is often considered<br/>
inappropriate discussion?  I just don&#39;t get it!<br/>

&gt; Now that everyone knows that this is OFF TOPIC, I wan to share something<br/>
&gt; that is very near to my heart. Tonight, I was reading my e-news. In the<br/>
&gt; entertainment section, there was a focus on the song &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; by the<br/>
&gt; Dixie Chicks (Country). It stated that 20 out of 149 radio stations chose<br/>
&gt; NOT to play this song because a battered woman plots and kills her abusive<br/>
&gt; husband in it. I wrote a letter to Lon Helton (of Country Countdown USA)<br/>
&gt; regarding that particular song. I am open to any and all comments PRIVATELY.<br/>
&gt; The letter is below. I would like to know what your thought are. thanks.<br/>
&gt; Stephanie<br/>
&gt; Mr. Lon Helton<br/>
&gt; Country Countdown USA<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr. Helton,<br/>
&gt; I am writing this in regard to the single &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; from the Dixie<br/>
&gt; Chicks. As a survivor of DV (domestic violence) I can personally relate to<br/>
&gt; the feelings that drove Wanda and Mary Anne to poison the black eyed peas.<br/>
&gt; Domestic violence is much bigger today than is heard of, and unfortunately<br/>
&gt; is not getting the attention it so badly needs. DV has many forms: physical,<br/>
&gt; psychological, and emotional; and it is extremely hard for a battered person<br/>
&gt; to find their way out. I cannot understand why radio stations have decided<br/>
&gt; not to play &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, but they will play Martina  McBride&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Both songs depict the end of a violent relationship. The<br/>
&gt; discussion of women plotting their abuser&#39;s death is not new, but the<br/>
&gt; majority of women do not make it that far. They end up in Intensive Care or<br/>
&gt; die. Many women may think of &quot;getting back&quot; at their abuser, only to<br/>
&gt; immediately dismiss the thought, since if caught thinking such a thought<br/>
&gt; could (and would) provoke another beating.<br/>
&gt;     Domestic violence needs to be put into the media, and if this is a way<br/>
&gt; to get DV noticed, then I am all for it! Please feel free to contact me for<br/>
&gt; any questions or comments that you may have- I am more than willing to<br/>
&gt; share. Sincerely Mrs Stephanie A Coomer (now married to a non abuser!)<br/>
