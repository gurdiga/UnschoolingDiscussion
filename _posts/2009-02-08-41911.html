<div id="ygrps-yiv-215591759">Joyce wrote on the unschooling and reading thread:  &quot;The problem is  <br/>
in believing that since reading is enough and best for<br/>
some, that it&#39;s enough for everyone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough for ANYone, and those who claim it should  <br/>
shake off their book worship.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost it, but some years back someone sent a link to a little  <br/>
article about some people who could ONLY learn from reading, and  <br/>
there was a name for the condition.  I&#39;d love to have that again, if  <br/>
anyone kept it or knows what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the &quot;idiot savant&quot; cases, I know it&#39;s possible, but it&#39;s  <br/>
not ideal.   The term &quot;idiot savant&quot; is from French, is a couple of  <br/>
hundred years old, and describes people who have one extreme genius  <br/>
trait, but otherwise can hardly wipe their own asses.    It&#39;s saved  <br/>
for really extreme cases, like a concert pianist who can&#39;t dress  <br/>
himself or someone who can do sums and calculate pi, but doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
where he lives.  (I made those up, maybe; I&#39;m not going to check  <br/>
particular case studies, but am going on memory of readings and  <br/>
accounts from psychology professors when I had those guys in my life.)<br/>
<br/>
I had a friend who had done a master&#39;s in geology, in Philadelphia.   <br/>
His thesis involved the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico, their  <br/>
formation, and their volcanic/geothermal this&#39;n&#39;that.   (For those  <br/>
who might be reading aloud, it sounds like &quot;HAYmess.&quot;)   When he was  <br/>
in his 30&#39;s, he came to see me and I drove him up into the Jemez.  He  <br/>
was verbally knowledgeable, and was telling me things I&#39;d never  <br/>
known, but the emotion of him seeing those features and the soda dam  <br/>
and the sulphur spring and the waterfalls and the Valle Grande (a  <br/>
huge caldera that doesn&#39;t look so big until you realize that the ants  <br/>
are cattle and the bales of hay are pickups) was huge.  He was  <br/>
learning right there, in front of me, seeing that GIGANTIC mountain  <br/>
sky from where he was already 8,000 feet up.   I think it was like  <br/>
someone who had read about and written about chocolate, but had never  <br/>
smelled it or touched it or tasted it.<br/>
<br/>
If someone could recite &quot;times tables&quot; but had never so much as  <br/>
counted on her fingers, what would she &quot;know&quot;?<br/>
