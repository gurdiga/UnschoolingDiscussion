&gt; &gt;thankful that we can all take showers or baths whenever we want, as hot as <br/>
&gt; &gt;we like. This said, my boys usually end up taking showers about once a <br/>
&gt; &gt;week or so, sometimes more, sometimes less.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And somewhere around about puberty, they&#39;ll start taking showers every day <br/>
&gt; (or more).  I have to call my son 2 or 3 times to get him out of the shower <br/>
&gt; now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s also a magic point between the beginning of puberty and the point <br/>
where the urge to bathe kicks in. That&#39;s where we are now. Sometimes the kid <br/>
just smells to the point that you can&#39;t stand to be in the room (or the CAR!) <br/>
with him.  He&#39;s pretty responsive when we ask him to bathe/put on deodorant <br/>
at that point, but it can be pretty bad. LOL<br/>
