<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733526846">Hello everyone, hope everyone&#39;s summer was nice. Finally settled in here and <br/>
loving it. We had a surprise visitor for 2 weeks, none other than mom! What a <br/>
wonderful new relationship her and I have started.<br/>
<br/>
Wow! A lot has happened here. I&#39;ve spent 2 days back reading and reading. <br/>
Congratulations to I believe it was Kelly on the birth of her child. I hope that <br/>
was on this list. Laura is having a baby, that is so wonderful!! And this list <br/>
has new parents, owners that is and lots of moderators, that&#39;s so great. A <br/>
wonderful bunch of women running such a helpful list. The introduction to the <br/>
list is so nicely put. Congratulations to all of you for making this list what <br/>
it is.<br/>
<br/>
