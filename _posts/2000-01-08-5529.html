<div id="ygrps-yiv-123920762">I have one of those 11 1/2 yr olds who want more structure(she&#39;s created some for herself). She wants to improve her arithmetic skills. Does anyone know of  self-teaching not dumbed down books or sites or software?  It&#39;s really cool to watch things unfold...    sometimes it is hard to remember that things do hapen when the child IS READY and not before.<br/>

You might want to check out www.gnarlymath.com...also wwww. naturalmath.com.  Also a book that I&#39;ve seen reccommend a number of times but haven&#39;t had a chance to look at yet is &quot;The I Hate Mathematics Book&quot; sorry I don&#39;t remember the author but I believe it was a woman.  If I come across more I will post them.  :)<br/>
