<div id="ygrps-yiv-540911336">I see a huge difference between recognizing that kids can KEEP learning <br/>
during their breaks from being schooled versus unschooling, letting go of all <br/>
school-style imposed curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t unschool just because we know kids can learn without the schooling <br/>
-- we unschool because we believe the schooling can actually be harmful, <br/>
because it entails risks we aren&#39;t willing to accept. THAT is the message <br/>
that Kate wasn&#39;t seeming to hear. I don&#39;t blame her - I think we are <br/>
sometimes sort of too reticent to say it - out of a sense of courtesy, <br/>
believe it or not &lt;G&gt; - not wanting to tell other people that we think that <br/>
what they are doing could be harmful.<br/>
<br/>
I do think people here were hearing perfectly well what she was saying - that <br/>
she allows a lot of freedom and child-determined time and pays attention to <br/>
whether her kids are wanting to continue the lessons, etc. That&#39;s nice. It <br/>
beats the heck out of making the kids sit at the table in tears until they <br/>
finish their math curriculum every day. <br/>
<br/>
As I think I said in another post, I have a friend who uses Calvert <br/>
Curriculum and calls herself an unschooler. I don&#39;t correct her, much less <br/>
berate her - not ever. But if SHE wanted to talk about unschooling, I&#39;d tell <br/>
her what I thought, that what she was doing was absolutely contrary to what I <br/>
believe is the whole POINT of unschooling. I&#39;d tell her what Kate was hearing <br/>
here - that if you do school stuff that it isn&#39;t unschooling just because you <br/>
do it flexibly and nicely and because the kids have lots of other free time <br/>
to learn stuff their own way in between the lessons. It is nice - nicer than <br/>
rigid, meanspirited schooling - way nicer. But unschoolers STILL see it as <br/>
potentially harmful. Why?<br/>
<br/>
To me, it is absolutely CRITICAL that no &quot;lessons&quot; are being imposed on the <br/>
kids. To me, the whole point of unschooling is to avoid the unintended <br/>
consequences of schoolish, adult-imposed lessons.<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was still in school, 7 years ago, she was in a WONDERFUL <br/>
school. They had no testing, no grades, a LOT of freedom, and an exciting, <br/>
interesting, stimulating environment where all subjects in the curriculum <br/>
were integrated into what homeschoolers would call unit studies. She loved <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
BUT - I started to see the signs of a &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; taking place. And <br/>
even though my child was absolutely happy there, I wanted her out before more <br/>
harm was done.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is what needs to be said more openly. Unschoolers see potential <br/>
harm coming from imposed schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are challenging people to think something that can be pretty darn <br/>
uncomfortable or VERY scary. Or even dangerous. I can understand why people <br/>
often don&#39;t like hearing it.<br/>
<br/>
Some years ago, Sandra gave a talk and said something like, &quot;Be brave - think <br/>
dangerous thoughts. If you&#39;re too scared, duct-tape yourself to a chair and <br/>
get someone to watch you. &lt;g&gt; When you&#39;re done thinking dangerous thoughts, <br/>
you&#39;ll still be there and you can just go right back to whatever you were <br/>
doing before - nothing has to change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The dangerous thoughts I needed to be brave enough to ponder were: how <br/>
schooling had harmed ME and how I was potentially harming my own kids by <br/>
imposing any kind of schooling on them. It profoundly affected me to simply <br/>
hear the suggestion that it is SAFE to carry out such &quot;what if&quot; scenarios in <br/>
my head. It was a challenge and I couldn&#39;t stop myself from doing it, if I&#39;d <br/>
wanted to &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
What IF my kids can learn all the basic literacy stuff, that will make them <br/>
able to fully self-educate, in 50 hours total (which is what John Taylor <br/>
Gatto claims)? What if what an imposed curriculum teaches is mostly <br/>
dependency? What if, by requiring my kids to just &quot;do math,&quot; I&#39;m teaching <br/>
them that they can&#39;t really trust themelves, that they should rely on someone <br/>
else to tell them what they should learn? What if what they are learning is, <br/>
as John Gatto says, &quot;...the most important lesson of all, that we must wait <br/>
for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our <br/>
lives.&quot; What if I&#39;m teaching them that their worth depends on someone else&#39;s <br/>
evaluation of how well they&#39;ve learned what someone else decided they should <br/>
learn? What if I&#39;m undermining their self-trust? What if what if what if what <br/>
if?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Pam, I do know this. I know this in spades. I&#39;m not at all equating<br/>
unschooling and free learning between lessons. And I&#39;m not suggesting anyone<br/>
here stretch the unschooling definition to encompass this.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m saying is that it isn&#39;t fair to jump on the people coming to this<br/>
list for not understanding that unschooling has a more specific definition<br/>
than they&#39;ve been led to believe *BECAUSE* the pathways in here don&#39;t have<br/>
adequate markers.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re seeing the Tea Room signs hanging outside, they come in sit down,<br/>
order some tea and get jumped all over because the people inside have a<br/>
different definition of what Tea Room means.<br/>
<br/>
That Unschooling sign with the self-referential description as far as they<br/>
can tell means what they think unschooling means.<br/>
<br/>
*Hopefully* once we get the description changed and the welcome letters<br/>
changed and put adequate signs at all the gateways into the list, people<br/>
will understand -- or at least we&#39;ll have something we can show them should<br/>
it be obvious they entered without reading the signs! -- what *the list*<br/>
(and Unschooling.com) means by unschooling before they sign up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just asking for some understanding of their unintended ignorance of what<br/>
this list means by unschooling until we can help them be more informed.<br/>

<br/>
My point was that we can&#39;t even TALK about unschooling without talking about <br/>
the idea that unschoolers believe imposed school-type lessons are harmful and <br/>
contradictory to unschooling philosophy and THAT is what always seems to get <br/>
people all heated up and defensive. I&#39;m just not sure there is anything that <br/>
can be done about that.  It is an incomfortable and scary idea and people <br/>
have strong reactions to it and sometimes that is expressed in anger. But <br/>
other people are liberated by it, too, and some people come back years later <br/>
and say thank you - that they&#39;d thought more and they &quot;got it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t get it - but there are people who don&#39;t really want to unschool <br/>
but really get attached to the label anyway. So they get mad just because <br/>
people want to talk about unschooling and they are focused on whether or not <br/>
THEY get to use that term. The term itself isn&#39;t important - it is the ideas <br/>
behind it that matter.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t even use the word &quot;unschooling&quot; except in these kinds of discussions <br/>
- I doubt many people do. We don&#39;t think of ourselves as &quot;doing unschooling&quot; <br/>
- which always sounds like bad grammar to me &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
