<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540648401">&quot;I would like to discuss unschooling on an unschooling list and let fundamentalist political activists discuss their stuff on their lists.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well I thought unschooling was living life and learning from living life. So this letter touched on life in parts of our world and how somebody sees it , whether you personally agree or disagree.<br/>
<br/>
Does it directly relate to unschooling?  Well I guess it depends on whether or not you choose to learn from it or not. Of course you don&#39;t have to agree with the writer but by taking his piece of writing and analyzing it and further developing an understanding on what you perceive it to mean can be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I for one learned something from this discussion that I might not have if I had just come across the letter on another list.<br/>
