<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003454515">&quot;I think the alarms could be useful for an older child who was very upset by <br/>
the wetting.  I have had friends who used them with their children with good <br/>
results.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is my Jared. He&#39;s 10 and never had a dry night in his entire life. He asked me to get him some kind of alarm to wake him up, I explained why I didn&#39;t think that was a good idea (startling to get woke up during deep sleep, other members of the house being woke up and his body just not being ready probably) and he agreed.<br/>
But the only kind we knew about was the alarm type, a vibrating thing might not be so upsetting. He&#39;s very upset that he can&#39;t stay dry, I reassure him that his body will be ready when it&#39;s ready. It&#39;s hard to stay the night and wear pull-ups at 10 though. I think he might be really happy to know about a vibrating alarm.<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t work, nothing lost. If the child really wants to use a tool like that, I think it&#39;s fine.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know about pullups--Marty didn&#39;t like them because they still let the <br/>
bed get really wet.  But adult diapers (I think it was small-size adult <br/>
&quot;Depends,&quot; but not sure anymore) didn&#39;t leak.<br/>
<br/>
If his was dry in the morning, he would reuse it the next night.<br/>
<br/>
I would use one if I got to the point (aging-wise) that I was peeing the bed. <br/>
 For one thing, I&#39;m not the only person in my bed.  We have an expensive <br/>
mattress (first time in either of our lives), and sleeping is hard to come by <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
From what I hear, older women won&#39;t mess the bed up, they&#39;ll just start to <br/>
have little accidents on sneezing or laughing.   I COULD plan to give up <br/>
sneezing and laughing, but laughing is a good thing.  Almost as good as sleeping <br/>
sometimes.  (Sometimes better.)<br/>

pitched tone.  Just in case you do find one cheap or are able to borrow <br/>
one, you can listen to the alarm in advance so you know what it sounds <br/>
like.<br/>

Oh you gotta do your Keaglels(sp?)  pelvic floor muscle exercises.  Or take up Pilates.  My girlfriend had four pregs. five kids and her GYN said she had better start Pilates or she would be incontinent when she was older.  I&#39;ve had four kids so I figured I should get on that path too.(My Gran had problems)  Anyway take a class from someone who really knows what they are doing then if you want grab a book or video to continue.  A lot of the videos don&#39;t go into detail about what you are supposed to do and go to fast.  My teachers have been great and it was nice to have a little me time.<br/>
