<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226194006">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Hope this summer finds you all well!  I know I&#39;ve promised and promised to <br/>
write this, but, due to some crazy circumstances, I just haven&#39;t been able to.  <br/>
First the computer &quot;blew up,&quot; then my cable modem went out (as it would be, <br/>
right in the middle of trying to write this letter the last time, and before I <br/>
could hit send).  But, OH well, that&#39;s life, and now I FINALLY HAVE THE CHANCE <br/>
TO SHARE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER&#39;S AWESOME FORTUNE!<br/>
<br/>
To begin with, tomorrow she gets to leave for an AWESOME, probably once in a <br/>
lifetime trip.  Before I say just where, I do want to extend my thanks (not <br/>
because I am sending this to anyone there, but because I hope you will all find <br/>
new found respect for them) to the Cincinnati Museum Center and their Youth <br/>
Volunteer Program.  If it weren&#39;t for them, this trip wouldn&#39;t even be possible <br/>
for my daughter.  I hope if you live in & around Cincinnati, you will visit <br/>
their wonderful Museums & look into the program for your own teens (13 years and <br/>
up).  If you don&#39;t live here, I hope if you come &quot;passing thru&quot; you&#39;ll decide <br/>
to stop for a while (if you do, let me know, my DD, may be able to help you <br/>
out with some free tickets).  Mostly, I thank Don Whittrock & assistant Arden; <br/>
they are the ones who chose my daughter for this.  I also thank our anonymous d<br/>
onors!<br/>
<br/>
OK, DO I HAVE YA WONDERING YET, LOL?<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow afternoon (Saturday), she&#39;s living for Red Lodge, Montana near <br/>
Billings, Montana (think Yellowstone, National Park).  While she&#39;ll get to visit <br/>
Yellowstone, her main reason for being there is to go on a REAL DINOSAUR DIG <br/>
(LOL, Cheryl, & you didn&#39;t even realize this when you sent the e-mail today about <br/>
&quot;never being on a REAL Dinosaur Dig).  All of this was made possible by an <br/>
anonymous donor to the Museum Center, who donated ENOUGH MONEY to send 8 of the <br/>
youths from the youth program.  <br/>
<br/>
12 were asked to write 4 essays & 1 THANK YOU letter to the Anonymous Donor.  <br/>
(The kids did have to be at least 16 to do this.)  They (Don and Arden) ONLY <br/>
chose those who they thought would be best suited for the trip.  Of the 12, <br/>
they had to narrow it down (through the essays & thank you letter) to the 8 who <br/>
are going.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is SOOOOO PSYCHED!  They fly out tomorrow afternoon!  ALL IS PAID <br/>
FOR; FLIGHT, FOOD, LODGING, THE DIG, EVERY ASPECT!<br/>
<br/>
Me?  Well, LOL, I&#39;m so happy for her, but at the same time a bit freaked out <br/>
by the fact that she&#39;ll be flying AGAIN w/out me (then, LOL, you DON&#39;T want to <br/>
be on a plane w/me, either...unless you have me heavily drugged).  Plus, it <br/>
isn&#39;t like when she went to Washington, DC this past winter (though I was <br/>
freaked out about that too); at least I could have gotten there in under 12 hours <br/>
drive time, and who knows, an hour, maybe 1 1/2 tops by plane).  This is A LOT <br/>
FARTHER away from me than DC!  But, I&#39;d never even try to stop her from this <br/>
trip.  This is a once in a life timer for most of us!  I&#39;d never be able to <br/>
afford this trip, so she is one lucky kid, and a great essay writer!<br/>
<br/>
BUT, WAIT:  OH YEA, THERE&#39;S MORE!<br/>
<br/>
Most of you know my daughter wanted to work at Paramount Kings Island <br/>
Amusement Park (PKI) last year (she was only 15 then, and I told her I really wanted <br/>
her to be a &quot;kid&quot; for one more summer; she listened and did).  She came to me <br/>
in early spring, before PKI opened and asked me to take her to the park to <br/>
fill out the application.  Beings that she WAS 16 by then AND it was the 2nd year <br/>
in a row she asked, I knew she was serious.  (My one and only &quot;requirement&quot; <br/>
was that she had to stick w/it since it was just a seasonal job; that&#39;s our <br/>
rule, you start something, you finish it.)  Well, she&#39;s absolutely LOVED the job <br/>
and the job absolutely LOVES her!<br/>
<br/>
All summer, they were giving her responsibilities above and beyond what they <br/>
give &quot;most&quot; associates; especially her age.  A few weekends ago, she was told <br/>
by another supervisor, that the following day, they were going to put Kaycee <br/>
with one  Supervisors in Charge of one of the mid to large sized picnics (1000 <br/>
- 2000 people).  She was required to pre train those who volunteer there, <br/>
&quot;place people&quot; in positions she thought would suit them best, schedule breaks, <br/>
lunches, & suppers, and write end of picnic reports (all the while, watching, <br/>
supervising, etc., & helping the workers).  She MUST HAVE DONE WELL!<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the night, her supervisor (the MAIN ONE) HANDED HER an <br/>
application for a Forman position for next year (they&#39;d start training her this year). <br/>
 IT&#39;S REALLY GOOD NEWS when the Supervisor HANDS YOU that application.  <br/>
Anyone who&#39;s been there once season can apply, but to have it handed to you, <br/>
without going to the office yourself, says a lot!  And, I must say, PKI does pay <br/>
well.  She doesn&#39;t make minimum wage (but, I think it&#39;s good even when kids do <br/>
make Minimum wage; they still learn to work).  On top of the great pay (for a <br/>
kid), she gets a free membership to the park, free food while working, 1/2 off <br/>
food when not, free tickets for friends, (I&#39;d say family, but we always buy <br/>
season passes, well except for my brother & his family).  PLUS, she gets a 40% <br/>
discount on ALL PKI Merchandise.  She also gets other perks like discounts at <br/>
other local amusements, like canoeing, dining out, etc.  They also have &quot;after <br/>
hours PKI ASSOCIATES ONLY&quot; work parties where the supervisors run the rides, <br/>
and they get to ride and eat all the junk food they can.  That lasted until 1 or <br/>
2 am, late, but in a &quot;safe place.&quot;  I can&#39;t say they don&#39;t work those who <br/>
will hard.  They do, but it is GREAT practice for the future, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ll keep you posted on that one.  <br/>
<br/>
I do need to hit the bed, there are a few more things for us to do BEFORE she <br/>
leaves early afternoon.  Please say your prayers for a safe return, and a <br/>
fun, educational trip!<br/>
<br/>
And, LOL, THANKS for listening to me go on and on about my daughter, but, <br/>
geezsh, who just couldn&#39;t w/all this news?<br/>
<br/>
Take Care, & I&#39;ll keep ya&#39; all posted!<br/>
<br/>
Tracy<br/>
PS:  IF SOME OF YOU GOT DOUBLE. TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE, OR MORE OF THESE, I&#39;M <br/>
SORRY, I COULDN&#39;T IN MY EXCITEMENT REMEMBER WHO IS/ISN&#39;T IN CERTAIN GROUPS (NOT TO <br/>
MENTION IN MY E-MAIL ADDRESS BOOK MORE THAN ONCE FOR WHATEVER REASON).  SO, <br/>
SORRY ABOUT THAT!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965539749">Tracy,<br/>
    What an opportunity and fun trip! Safe travels. We really like Museum<br/>
Central too. I like the outside (it looks like an old fashion radio)<br/>
architecture. The place is a blast. I&#39;ll have to email you the next time we<br/>
come down from Columbus. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-112867391">Congratulations!   My three yr. old dinosaur obsessed son is watching one of the Walking W/ Dinosaur BBC specials next to me.  We just read a book about the discovery of the Maiasaura (nest and baby and adults) in Montana!  They talked about a children&#39;s section of the site where kids actually discovered some of the bones.  They mentioned the exhibit being in Bozeman.  Is she part of the Maiasaura dig?  I love Maiasaura.  The name means &quot;good mother&quot;.   I told my 3 yr. old, Jesse, about your daughter and he was really excited.  Good for her.  Let us know how it went when you hear.<br/>

<br/>
Maiasaura is the Montana State Dinosaur!<br/>
<br/>
The Maiasaura exhibit at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman is great<br/>
but it hasn&#39;t changed in years.  Montana folks would like to see some new<br/>
stuff but folks who&#39;ve never been before would love it. <br/>
