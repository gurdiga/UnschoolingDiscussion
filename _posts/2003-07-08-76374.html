<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143481692">We&#39;re building a shelter-kit home. It&#39;s called a barn house. It&#39;s a kit. Our <br/>
delivery date is NOVEMBER 28th!! Argghh!! Well, I&#39;ve waited this long.<br/>
We also plan on using as much salvaged materials as we can, I want this house <br/>
to look like it&#39;s been there a while. It will have 1x12 vertical siding, <br/>
stained purple, with a teal front door, green windows, and working funky shutters <br/>
that will be another color (can&#39;t decide yet) I want this to look as if <br/>
Fairies built it.<br/>
I&#39;m very excited about it!!<br/>
We plan on having animals, goats and horses for sure, maybe a Llama. And <br/>
chickens, too.<br/>

<br/>
Pink and green?<br/>
<br/>
TOOO fairy.<br/>
<br/>
Blue.  Green and blue.  <br/>
<br/>
Or if pinkish, at least go lavender or some light purple.<br/>
<br/>
Why should all the shutters be the same color though?  <br/>
<br/>
Gold on some.  Purple on some.  <br/>
<br/>
Or if pink, throw in some sparkly stuff.  Mica powder or glitter or something <br/>
glitzy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I want to wish you lots and lots of luck.  Building our house was one of the <br/>
hardest things we&#39;ve ever done.  Just keep encouraging each other, try to hold <br/>
your tongue when it comes to criticisms...the key is COMPROMISE!!  <br/>
<br/>
The house sounds WONDERFUL...beautiful!....I wish my husband was a little <br/>
more open to my artistic side when it comes to our house.  The outside <br/>
doesn&#39;t/won&#39;t look as cool as yours, but he is willing to bite his tongue and let me <br/>
paint the inside and decorate as I want (we are adding on and re-doing a lot of <br/>
stuff as we speak.)  <br/>
<br/>
November...where are you located again?  You may be in for an unbelievable <br/>
race to finish before the snow flies.  Our first snow was in October here last <br/>
year!!  Keep us posted!! :o)<br/>
