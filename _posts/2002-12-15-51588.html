 </span></blockquote>Ferris Bueller. Up there in the top ten movies I can watch again and again <br/>
and again---but last night I couldn&#39;t watch it. ;-(  We had twenty Lovejoys <br/>
here for the Lovejoy Christmas party all day. (a whole &#39;nother post! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Last night, I made the same statement about Best In Show. The dog show folk <br/>
are stereotypical caricatures, and each and every bit was something I&#39;d seen <br/>
(and done! &lt;G&gt;)---and maybe and maybe NOT all at once! &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s a little <br/>
snapshot of my &quot;doggy&quot; life. When you see it smushed together into a two hour <br/>
flick, it&#39;s hard to believe I&#39;m out there in it---but that&#39;s my doggy life. <br/>
