My son has a friend whose parents are from Hong Kong. A while ago we were <br/>
invited to a Christmas party at their house. Most of the other guests were <br/>
Asian-Americans.  At a certain point in the evening, various stringed <br/>
instruments were brought out. Our host picked up a mini-cello or something, <br/>
held it like a violin under his chin and gave a spirited rendition of Jingle <br/>
Bells. This, after apparently not playing for a long time.  Later, almost all <br/>
the children spent ages playing on the intruments. <br/>
<br/>
 The children were of mixed ages and sex, but several were about ten or <br/>
eleven. Some had not been learning to play for very long. They played without <br/>
music, obviously. Sometimes they played together, sometimes they all did <br/>
their own thing (And yes, at times it WAS somewhat deafening!)   To everyone <br/>
but me,  they were apparently doing nothing particularly unusual. Odd parents <br/>
occasionally watched, or commented; but mostly they were leaving the children <br/>
to their own devices and simply socialising.  The children were playing <br/>
purely for the love and fun of it, and they were having a wonderful <br/>
time.........<br/>
<br/>
They were learning with the Suzuki method.  I checked. I don&#39;t know whether <br/>
Suzuki produces concert violinists. But if you want your children to play for <br/>
the love of it, then my experience at that Christmas party certainly made ME <br/>
a Suzuki enthusiast!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702209567">Would it be a viola?  Larger than the violin, slgihty deeper sound?  <br/>
Bit tricky to get a cello under one&#39;s chin, the spike gets in the way <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I used to play Double Bass, great fun (had an individualist <br/>
streak at the age of 8, even)  Now I have a Bass Guitar sitting in <br/>
the garage next to the amp, never being used.  Very sad.  But my <br/>
life is full of other stuff right now, and my favourite instrument <br/>
(for performing, not listening &lt;g&gt;) is my voice.<br/>

Japan learn how to read music in school. A lot of Japanese students in<br/>
the Suzuki method already know how to read a little music before they<br/>
start.<br/>
I found this out from posts by hs&#39;ing Suzuki instructors on the Canadian<br/>
home schooling e-mail list.<br/>
Apparently a lot of the N.A. instructors don&#39;t realize this and think<br/>
that they are not supposed to introduce reading music.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311725411">Hi Maureen;<br/>
<br/>
We, my 7 year old daughter and I, had a limited experience with Suzuki<br/>
violin last summer.  We attended violin camp.  I can tell you it was a<br/>
very positive experience for us both.  The Suzuki program seems to be<br/>
the perfect option for homeschoolers as Suzuki encourages parental<br/>
involvement.  As a matter of fact, they demand it.  The only reason we<br/>
have not continued for the moment is financing...<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend Suzuki, and anyone can attest to the success of the<br/>
program in terms of giving your child a musical background.<br/>
