<div id="ygrps-yiv-376680743">I&#39;ve written in the past few weeks that my 13 (almost 14) yo ds is planning<br/>
to go to high school this fall, although he&#39;s never been in school and never<br/>
had any structured schooling at home.  We had decided to let him choose,<br/>
although it definitely would disrupt our very casual life-style.  I have two<br/>
younger boys who have no desire to go, so we would be living on<br/>
school-schedule for one child.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he told me last night that he&#39;s been thinking about it and he doesn&#39;t<br/>
think he wants to go after all.  He is wanting to get a job, but had already<br/>
decided that he wouldn&#39;t because he was only going to work for about six<br/>
weeks, then quit when school starts.  He didn&#39;t think that would be fair to<br/>
an employer (to be trained, then quit) but he also didn&#39;t think that he<br/>
should keep a job if he was starting school as that could be way too much<br/>
stress.  Now he says that he would rather get a job and earn his own money<br/>
and not bother with school.  He&#39;s so busy with his computer work (and he<br/>
tells me, it IS real work) - making websites, helping others with their<br/>
websites, creating and sharing games and testing others&#39; games, that I think<br/>
he finally realized that he&#39;d have almost no time for that with school.  He<br/>
wants to just work maybe two days/week (which is all he really can at age 14<br/>
anyway) and have the rest of his time free for his computer activities.<br/>
<br/>
Hooray!<br/>

If you write a letter his employer can keep on file, you can tell him that <br/>
your homeschooling schedule is not bound to the school&#39;s, and you can declare <br/>
&quot;days off&quot; of the days he would work.   They can&#39;t have kids working certain <br/>
hours when it&#39;s not vacation, but your school&#39;s &quot;vacation&quot; doesn&#39;t have to match <br/>
the school&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It might be something you can work around.  Search online for the state <br/>
policies for hiring younger kids.  We did that when Kirby was hired at 14 and it <br/>
was really not as oppressive as we or the employer had feared.<br/>
