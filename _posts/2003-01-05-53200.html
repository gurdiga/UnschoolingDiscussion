I&#39;m hoping this is for *this* Teresa. :)<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m in North Carolina.  My school is K-7 (will be adding 8 next year).  We are still in many ways a &quot;traditional&quot; school (there are designated times for certain activities, for example, although these times are set by each class-- teacher & kids collaborate on that).  We don&#39;t have grades, we don&#39;t have &quot;punishments&quot; (we do a lot of talking with the kids and asking them to find ways to be more responsible for themselves and their choices)...<br/>
<br/>
My school&#39;s only in its third year.<br/>

Oh, ok. Well this school in Pensacola is in it&#39;s second year....it&#39;s focus is <br/>
technology and kids have to apply to try and get in.<br/>
There are several homeschoolers using it.<br/>
Since you&#39;re into film making, is there a good website you&#39;d recommend that <br/>
describes the process? My kids have been asking a lot the last couple of days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I work in the film business in NYC (I am an editor).  I can&#39;t think of any<br/>
comprehensive websites offhand -- I&#39;m sure there are some, but I think you&#39;d<br/>
find a better-written overview in a book, since it&#39;s a massive subject (do<br/>
get a modern one if you go looking -- the business started changing<br/>
radically in the last few years).  Anyhow, I can answer many questions you<br/>
or your children have... particularly about independent film-making.  If the<br/>
group is interested, ask me here... if not, feel free to email me offlist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359055424">My recommendation would be to start with books that are &quot;making of&quot; movies<br/>
your kids have seen.  They have these at my library for most big films (like<br/>
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;).  I think the material would be easier to<br/>
absorb this way, with lots of pictures of people behind the camera and<br/>
building models.  Otherwise, many of the concepts can get somewhat abstract.<br/>
A lot of books and websites get hung up on describing what the weird job<br/>
titles (like &#39;key grip&#39;) mean, when that info doesn&#39;t have much to do with<br/>
what most people find magical about the movies.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Making of&quot; shows on tv are really great too -- MTV has them, as does Bravo.<br/>
(These tend to focus on actors and directors.)  And of course DVDs with<br/>
extra features are good for hearing more about the script, the acting, and<br/>
the editing.<br/>
<br/>
Your area has a film festival in March (www.pensacolabayfilmandtv.com) ...<br/>
they might end up having a short film program or some kids movies that would<br/>
make an interesting counterpoint to the Hollywood style that one usually<br/>
sees in the theaters.  Or you could end up meeting local filmmakers who<br/>
would let you visit the set of their next project.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what age your kids are, but some fun film-related projects are:<br/>
<br/>
*  making scripted videos, using real people or dolls<br/>
*  making stop-frame animation (with clay or legos)<br/>
*  making nonsense or found-footage videos (editing bits from tv + movies)<br/>
*  writing new scripts for a favorite tv show<br/>
*  documenting small events like dinnertime, a party, a wedding<br/>
*  videotaping a pet + later adding &quot;voiceover&quot; of what the pet is thinking<br/>
*  make a comic-book movie by video-ing each frame for a little while +<br/>
reading the text<br/>
<br/>
Older kids who are interested in filmmaking can learn a lot from still<br/>
photography, reading fiction (or reading fiction and then seeing the movie<br/>
it was made into), a video camera (doesn&#39;t have to be fancy; a $10 one from<br/>
1987 that works is just fine -- ask around, because lots of people upgrade<br/>
and have no use for their older models), and any computer editing programs<br/>
they can get their hands on [but you CAN edit with two VCRs, or one camera<br/>
and one VCR.] Storytelling is storytelling, though the tools may change.<br/>
<br/>
Filmmaking is one career where you find lots and lots of people with<br/>
nontraditional and no-college backgrounds.  Another interesting aspect of<br/>
the field is that it also features many other jobs that some people aren&#39;t<br/>
aware of: a film set requires hairdressers and medics and teachers and<br/>
physical trainers and language experts and architects and historians and<br/>
musicians/composers... which is good to know for anyone who thinks film<br/>
might be fun, but doesn&#39;t have the personality of a director, actor, or<br/>
producer.<br/>
<br/>

You are a positive wealth of information, thank you!!<br/>
I have been fascinated with the stop frame type of film work for some time, <br/>
but assumed you need a special camera as my camcorder isn&#39;t capable of doing <br/>
that.<br/>
Is it possible to find inexpensive equipment for THAT type of thing? My kids <br/>
can use our camcorder if this interest develops. <br/>
Mostly, Jared was really curious about the process. He&#39;s seen shows on <br/>
special effects, but doesn&#39;t get how it finally comes together.<br/>
I need to get movies that show the actual editing process I think. He sees <br/>
the &quot;tricks&quot; they use but doesn&#39;t get how it ends up looking so perfect in <br/>
the final version.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361084842">Glad to be of help.  The movies are a mystery to so many people; I like to<br/>
tell all the secrets.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
As for stop-frame animation, you are correct that most camcorders don&#39;t have<br/>
a feature that lets you record one frame at a time.  (Some do, but they<br/>
usually cost lots more.)<br/>
<br/>
What I used as a kid was a Super-8 camera (the &quot;camcorder&quot; of the late &#39;60s<br/>
and early &#39;70s).  You can still get these today at flea markets and on eBay<br/>
(be sure to get a SUPER 8 camera and not &quot;regular&quot; 8 -- regular 8 film is no<br/>
longer made).  Also, ask around: so many people have these cameras around<br/>
and have no use for them.  Before you buy one, do make sure it can do one<br/>
frame at a time.  Most of them can, but some lame ones were made with very<br/>
few features.  You should be able to purchase one for $15 - $20, regardless.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d also need a projector to watch the results of your handiwork.  Lots of<br/>
people have these in their attics, or again, eBay.  Super-8 film is easily<br/>
available, but you&#39;d likely have to mail-order it in and ship it out for<br/>
developing (email me if you can&#39;t find places online).  But I think this is<br/>
part of the fun -- to get your film back 3 weeks later, so excited about<br/>
what it&#39;s going to look like!<br/>
<br/>
The process is simple, if tedious.  You stick the camera on a tripod or<br/>
other firm surface.  You put your scene in front of the camera, usually on a<br/>
table.  Look through the lens and focus for the scene.  (You may want to<br/>
turn bright lights on to help the camera focus.)  When you&#39;re all set up,<br/>
you click the &quot;shutter&quot; so that the camera records ONE lonely frame.  (Two<br/>
is okay too.)  Then, you move your scene a little bit: the clay man moves<br/>
his arm half-an-inch, maybe.  Or the lego car moves a similar amount.  It&#39;s<br/>
fun to move a couple of elements each time, and to know where all this<br/>
action is heading -- otherwise, it&#39;s hard to know when you&#39;re finished.<br/>
Take another frame or two.  Move your elements a little more.  Take a frame.<br/>
Move the elements.  Take a frame.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that film moves at 24 frames per second (though some super-8 is<br/>
18 frames per second).  At 24 fps, one minute of finished film takes 1440<br/>
frames!  That said, most of my animations from childhood are less than 10<br/>
seconds long and they are still pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Have you guys tried watching movies or TV shows in slow motion to see if<br/>
you can spot more techniques and tricks that way?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to do that with the Buffy fight scenes.  I can deduce<br/>
that if they aren&#39;t showing Sarah Michelle Gellar&#39;s face, then it&#39;s the<br/>
stunt person, but I&#39;d like to study this in more detail.  My eyes are<br/>

One of my students has a little camera-- it&#39;s blue and almost looks like an old Kodak... rectangular-- and she got it at Toys-R-Us last year after Christmas for like $30.  I&#39;m not sure of the name-- I&#39;ll ask tomorrow.  Her dad says there were similar cameras there this year as well.<br/>
<br/>
This particular student makes films a good bit-- for school and her own amusement.  She gets pretty good effects from the camera as well (fades, etc.).<br/>
