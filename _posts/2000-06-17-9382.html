<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908000753">How many homeschoolers does it take to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; change a lightbulb?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A. First mom checks three books on electricity out of the library,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; then the kids make models of lightbulbs, read a biography of Thomas<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Edison and do a skit based on his life. Next, everyone studies the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; history of lighting methods, wrapping up with dipping their own<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; candles. Next, everyone takes a trip to the store where they<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; compare types of light bulbs as well as prices and figure out how<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; much change they&#39;ll get if they buy two bulbs for $1.99 and pay<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with a five dollar bill. On the way home, a discussion develops<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; over the history of money and also Abraham Lincoln, as his picture<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; is on the five dollar bill. Finally, after building a homemade<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ladder out of branches dragged from the woods, the light bulb is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; installed. And there is light!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; [copied from a newsletter for homeschoolers, and they got it from<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; several emails they had received :-)   -- pass it on to someone you<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; know who homeschools!]<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>
