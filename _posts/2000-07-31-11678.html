<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456870441">Hi Everybody!<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;m the one who mentioned the label of &quot;terrible twos&quot; etc. I feel<br/>
I ought to clarify why I thought it was of value to identify age-related<br/>
&quot;phases&quot;.  I agree that labelling a so-called &quot;phase&quot; can sometimes be<br/>
detrimental.  I know the whole labelling thing in general is<br/>
counterproductive to children/people.  I just think it can be helpful to<br/>
sometimes have a frame of reference to help identify some behaviors. <br/>
When your child is on the verge of leaving babyhood and about to become<br/>
a full-fledged &quot;kid&quot;, of course the child is going to endure growing<br/>
pains of one form or another.  Before I really doubt myself as a mother<br/>
and start listening to all kinds of rotten advice, (&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve just<br/>
spoiled him...he should be weaned by now!&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ve been too soft, a<br/>
few swats with the wooden spoon would fix that noise&quot;...Believe me, this<br/>
is what I&#39;ve heard!!!) it can be helpful to remind myself that this<br/>
sometimes inconvenient behavior is typical and often short-lived.  My<br/>
two year old won&#39;t be two forever, and this is just a &quot;phase&quot;.  With<br/>
patience, consistency, and love it will pass.  I happen to believe the<br/>
so-called &quot;terrible twos&quot; can also be the &quot;terrific twos&quot;.  There is so<br/>
much wonder and magic at this age.  A two year old is actually capable<br/>
of asking for a hug and giving you one back!  A two year old is just<br/>
starting to sing!  A two year old loves animals!  A two year old can be<br/>
so social!  Mine have always been real entertainers...(BTW, my &quot;two year<br/>
old&quot; phase usually starts at 18 months and is usually over with by 26<br/>
months.)  <br/>
<br/>
Phases are transitional and not anything to take too seriously. <br/>
&quot;Phases&quot; are not BEHAVIOURAL problems.  (Those are to be treated<br/>
completely differently...)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me re-state the obvious!<br/>
<br/>
