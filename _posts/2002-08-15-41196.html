<div id="ygrps-yiv-351451626">Schooling is artificial. UNschooling is real life...it&#39;s everything <br/>
that<br/>
school isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare<br/>
<br/>
Let us know how it goes. . . once a week at least. Consider this<br/>
UNschool-anon for former school addicts. We&#39;re listening.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is why I joined this list, for comments like this from people <br/>
like Ned.  I need the affirmation that I am doing the right thing <br/>
for my children.    <br/>
I have wonderful children.  They are creative and funny and <br/>
interesting and when they are allowed to learn on their own terms, <br/>
it is awesome to see how they delve deeply into a subject that <br/>
interests them.  That said, I was scared when my 8-year-old still <br/>
did not know how to read. (he has since learned,mostly on his own, <br/>
with Pathway readers of all things) I worry when my 13-year old <br/>
would rather be with her animals than her cousins. I am still <br/>
nervous when one of my sisters asks &quot;How&#39;s school going?&quot;  I don&#39;t <br/>
think others would understand what we do here, how we live.  We live <br/>
out in the country and are fairly isolated.  I like it that way, but <br/>
when other unschoolers mention keeping in touch with friends, making <br/>
sure your children play with others, etc.  I get nervous again.   We <br/>
lived in town, my kids DID have friends they played with, but the <br/>
last thing I want is those kids around.  Lets see, the neighbor boy <br/>
pointed a gun at my son once since he wouldn&#39;t play with him, he <br/>
invited him over to look at his Dad&#39;s &quot;magazine collection&quot;, the <br/>
neighbor girl wanted the kids to sneak in her clubhouse and smoke, <br/>
and there was a little boy who often said the &quot;F&quot; word, and this is <br/>
in small-town America, a decent neighborhood....  I took my children <br/>
out of school precisely because of this type of &quot;socialization&quot;!  <br/>
They have each other (five at home now, two on thier own) and they <br/>
play together, from the 2-year-old to the almost 16-year-old.  Yep, <br/>
together!  They would much rather stay home and build rock forts and <br/>
play with their animals than visit cousins, though I still force the <br/>
cousin visits once inawhile.  The few homeschoolers we have met are <br/>
very rigid in their homeschooling or just down-right &quot;wierd&quot; <br/>
according to my kids (Though I remind them gently that we are weird <br/>
too)  Their cousins talk about boys and clothes and my Rachel (13) <br/>
just could care less about that stuff.  We tried 4-H, but honestly, <br/>
my children would much rather just stay home!  They get jobs around <br/>
age 16, handle them fine, can talk to others their age when put in <br/>
that environment, but am I harming them having them home every day <br/>
(well, okay, we go places and do things together but they really <br/>
aren&#39;t around children their age much at all)<br/>
Insight on this?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mary,<br/>
As a one new unschooler to another, you have certainly hit a cord.<br/>
My children would rather stay home also than go to 4-H or other <br/>
activities.  And honestly, there is only one boy in the neighborhood <br/>
that is decent to play with.  And that opinion has nothing to do with <br/>
the fact that I consider myself a non-church going Christian.  That <br/>
is; what I consider decent has nothing to do with what you might <br/>
consider religious beliefs. So, having said that I think that home is <br/>
the greatest place my kids can be in this world.  And I am thrilled <br/>
that they would rather be with each other and their mom.  We too <br/>
do &quot;field trips&quot; but mainly hang around the back yard.  So-- go for <br/>
it.  After all they won&#39;t live with ya forever.<br/>

Mary, I am new to fully unschooling, but I think the amount of time spent with other children/families depends on each person&#39;s needs/wants. If the children seem happy, then all is well, imo. On the other hand, if you or they are feeling uncomfortable twinges, maybe this is something you need to look at - are the twinges  from guilt or because of &quot;differentness&quot;? Or are they because you or one of the kids really sense a need for more companionship? In our family, the kids ( and  Mum! lol!) like to have time with other kids and families/friends and also time just with us - too much time one way or the other  creates  a feeling that all is not well, for us...Leonie<br/>

<br/>
But if they DO decide to live with you forever, hanging around the house now <br/>
is the best preparation for their future!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids often say &quot;No let&#39;s just go home&quot; if I offer to take them out to <br/>
eat!! Honestly, they prefer the comfort of their own stuff and the dog and <br/>
our freezer food to being out and about.  Today and yesterday I delivered <br/>
food to Kirby and Marty at the gaming shop where they were playing.    It <br/>
doesn&#39;t even embarrass them. &lt;g&gt;  Today was homemade onion-dill bread made <br/>
into grilled cheese sandwiches with some pizza topping inside.  And Dr Pepper <br/>
(the official drink of Zenmomma hell).  <br/>
<br/>
More often than not I just direct them toward the refrigerator, but I was <br/>
feeling extra motherly because Holly and I are about to be gone for four <br/>
days, leaving just the boys and the dad/husband.  (That and the cottage <br/>
cheese needed to be used up.)<br/>
<br/>
Things just happen because other things happen.  One thing leads to four or <br/>
five more and there&#39;s no predicting our lives, but the kids are happy to be a <br/>
part of it, which makes it happier for all involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561556540">I joined this list yesterday, and am blown away by all the wonderful comments <br/>
and support, and the vast issues covered. We&#39;ll be unschooling our 7 year old <br/>
boy this year. We live in NJ and are fortunate to have few restrictions <br/>
reguarding homeschooling. We met for the first time today with an area <br/>
support group, although they are secular, the majority are unschoolers, and <br/>
totally validated my decision to keep Kennedy out of the public school <br/>
system, hopefully forever! This meeting and the responses from this site, to <br/>
my concerns have really put me at ease.<br/>
THANK YOU,<br/>

Ah, bread making, for all those who need to categorize what they do (to <br/>
comfort themselves or others). Science, math, home economics, phys ed (it <br/>
takes a lot of work to knead if you do it by hand), reading (a recipe), <br/>
history (if you use an old European recipe or one handed down through the <br/>
family). Best of all it&#39;s just plain fun. Can&#39;t wait to get my fall King <br/>
Arthur&#39;s flour catalog, so that I can order all sorts of delectable flours <br/>
and other ingredients. Eric and I enjoy making bread together.<br/>

need. Are they happy? Ask them if they&#39;d like more contact with other kids.<br/>
Make sure they have the opportunities. (It sounds like you are.) And let<br/>
them choose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488472380">**I am still nervous when one of my sisters asks &quot;How&#39;s school going?&quot; **<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that you could confound and flabbergast and side-step her<br/>
like this:<br/>
<br/>
her:  &quot;How&#39;s school going?&quot;<br/>
you:  &quot;We&#39;re all really happy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a little shift, imagining that her &quot;school&quot; questions are<br/>
about &quot;life&quot;.  Just give her the message that life is great and that you<br/>
are very pleased with your choices.  (Never let her see you wobble! <br/>
Wobbling and wavering is like blood in the water to a shark or a<br/>
concerned relative.)<br/>
