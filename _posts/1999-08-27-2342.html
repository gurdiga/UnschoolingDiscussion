&gt; summer, I have gotten us into a pattern of getting the kids up at 7 or so,<br/>
&gt; then the following:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. get dressed<br/>
&gt; 2. have breakfast<br/>
&gt; 3. clean up kitchen<br/>
&gt; 4  do chores till 9am<br/>
&gt; 5. do some &#39;school&#39;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just goes to show you how many different styles we all have!<br/>
If I had to follow this schedule I&#39;d burn out before the week was up.<br/>
LOL!  We think we&#39;ve achieved a lot if we&#39;re up watching reruns of <br/>
Little House together by 9 a.m.  Some of our best &quot;stuff&quot; happens <br/>
late at night - just the way we are!  I do feel like I sacrificed so <br/>
much more when my kids were in ps.  The stress of being tied down to <br/>
their schedule combined with decisions like - how sick are you? - <br/>
should you stay home or try and go.  YUK!  I LOVE the freedom we have <br/>
now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here Diane.  My kids are still babies, so they are exhausting just to<br/>
get through the day with.  I&#39;m doing pretty good if I get a shower<br/>
somewhere in the day.  Housecleaning is done during naptime (Bowing down in<br/>
supplication to all mighty naptime!)  <br/>
<br/>
While the kids are usually up between 7 and 8 it is certainly not MY<br/>
choice.  I am a night owl.  I need a cup of strong tea to wake up in the<br/>
morning and chores will have to wait until after I am walking and talking<br/>
for the day.  That&#39;s ok though, because the boys are slow to wake also and<br/>
so they watch Sesame Street (or something similar) while I answer the email<br/>
until we are all ready to start being active for the day.<br/>

it makes for the worst clashes.  My 4 and 6 yob&#39;s in particular get up and <br/>
they are so full of energy, it makes me CRAZY!  I would love to sit and do my <br/>
e-mail or drink a cup of tea, but if I try, I have to get up at lease 16 <br/>
times, and it&#39;s not worth it.<br/>
I guess we all have our sacrifices!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just lucky I guess.  My brother has the same problem as you.  His wife and<br/>
two daughters are all early risers while he is a late night person.  With<br/>
his wife in school full time he ends up with the girls a lot in the<br/>
mornings, and is none too happy about it either!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes DH and I can actually sleep in on the weekends and the boys will<br/>
sleep in a little as well!  That is when we don&#39;t have anything we need to<br/>
get up and do or any work on the house to take care of, which is rarely.</div>

Sounds like you only get a few hours sleep at night! My 6yo goes to bed no<br/>
earlier than 9:45 most nights. His best and most productive &quot;schoolish&quot;<br/>
hours (reading, talking, puzzle books) are between 8 and 10 P.M.  But at<br/>
least he sleeps past 8 most mornings. He established this pattern early as<br/>
a baby and hasn&#39;t changed. We couldn&#39;t keep up this schedule if we were<br/>
going to public school, and we&#39;d miss so many special talks at night.<br/>
