<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884019478">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Not to belabor the point, but here is some Japanese newspaper commentary <br/>
on the logic (such as it were) of the Japanese government&#39;s proposed <br/>
educational &quot;reforms,&quot; which include mandatory volunteer service for <br/>
Japanese schoolchildren.<br/>
<br/>
This biting editorial appears in today&#39;s Mainichi Daily News, having <br/>
originally appeared in Japanese the day before yesterday in the <br/>
vernacular Mainichi Shimbun, a newspaper with nationwide circulation in <br/>
Japan.<br/>

EDUCATION REFORM (editorial)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The interim report submitted on Friday by the National Commission on <br/>
Educational Reform to Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori contains suggestions in <br/>
17 areas and covers all phases of education, from preschoolers to higher <br/>
learning. It proposes some bold ideas, such as the establishment of <br/>
&quot;community schools&quot; and a much more flexible curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, there are proposals that would effectively slam the <br/>
door on &quot;problem children.&quot; It is thus difficult to give a general <br/>
appraisal of its merits and shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
It appears consistent, though, in its lack of sufficient debate. The 17 <br/>
suggestions seem to have been made before they were thoroughly discussed <br/>
by the 26 commission members. The report is uneven and it is difficult to <br/>
identify an overriding theme.<br/>
<br/>
One of its suggestions, which attracted considerable attention when it <br/>
was first put forward in a working group, is the requirement for students <br/>
to do community service. The full commission&#39;s report calls on students <br/>
to live communally for two weeks (elementary and middle school students) <br/>
or four weeks (high school students) and perform community service.<br/>
<br/>
It also recommends that all 18-year-olds be required to serve the <br/>
community for one year in such areas as farming, forest management or <br/>
caring for the elderly.<br/>
<br/>
There is no denying that youngsters would benefit from an opportunity to <br/>
participate in such activities, but &quot;community service&quot; has been only <br/>
vaguely defined; it should obviously cover a much broader spectrum of <br/>
activity than simply working close to nature or looking after those <br/>
needing nursing care.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, inasmuch as it is a &quot;service&quot; students should not be forced to <br/>
perform it. A climate conducive to serving the community would certainly <br/>
be a help, but there should be greater flexibility to allow the students <br/>
themselves to choose what they wish to do.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of having all 18-year-olds devote a year to community service, <br/>
moreover, is unrealistic and should be scrapped. Considering that the <br/>
proposal would mean asking people to make a colossal commitment, the <br/>
reasoning behind the concept is unbelievably shallow. Trying to push such <br/>
an idea on the public would jeopardize its trust in the commission.<br/>
<br/>
Vagueness is also found in the idea of building public &quot;community <br/>
schools&quot; as well. Such schools are part of an effort to expand <br/>
educational opportunities. They would be designed to be more responsive <br/>
to local needs and enable community members themselves to run them. <br/>
Details as to what specific needs they will meet, at what schooling level <br/>
classes will be taught, and how local governments will take part, though, <br/>
are as yet unclear.<br/>
<br/>
Among the more promising suggestions in the commission&#39;s report is the <br/>
formulation of a basic plan for school reform, such as those covering <br/>
teacher placement, new facilities, teaching of information technology, <br/>
acceptance of foreign students and greater opportunities for learning <br/>
outside the classroom. Because what is needed now is not a new set of <br/>
principles but a strategy to steadily implement reform measures, the <br/>
formulation of such a basic plan would be very significant.<br/>
<br/>
Public outlays for education as a share of gross national product is <br/>
still low compared to other industrial nations. Big changes cannot be <br/>
expected without sizable investments. We hope that enough funds will be <br/>
made available to achieve the necessary reforms.<br/>
