<div id="ygrps-yiv-168778163">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My husband is going to London for a week and then to Helsinki for the following week in<br/>
August on business. My 8yos and I would like to go to. Does anyone have information about<br/>
how to get really, really inexpensive airfare? I&#39;ve been reading up on charters, couriers,<br/>
consolidators, etc. and I&#39;m overwhelmed with the amount of information out there. Does anyone<br/>
have any words of wisdom to help me winnow through all this? We&#39;re pretty flexible as far as<br/>
what day of the week we travel, what time of the day, and number of connections but we&#39;re<br/>
not flexible as far as getting bumped or cancelled at the last minute. Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046416019">check www.priceline.com  You put in your destination and time for travel and<br/>
it gets the best price.  You might also try the airlines themselves (online<br/>
of course)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187127773">Try 800 cheap tickets (don&#39;t know if they are online).  Also I had a friend <br/>
who once<br/>
told me they slept in an airport for two day to get a cheap flight (I guess <br/>
when<br/>
the flight isn&#39;t full you can get on at the last minute) to Hawaii, think <br/>
they wound<br/>
up going for like $100 each.  Of course, not everyone is willing to do that <br/>
LOL.<br/>

I got weekly emails from www.icelandair.com and they often have cheap <br/>
international rates... you have to fly through Iceland (can even stay <br/>
for a few days without a penalty), but I&#39;ve seen it as cheap as $200 <br/>
roundtrip.<br/>
<br/>
Also, pick up a Sunday New York Times and check out the Travel <br/>
section - great specials listed in there frequently.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, visit www.travelzoo.com and sign up for their free weekly <br/>
email. It lists the top 20 travel deals each week.<br/>
<br/>
Once you know the cheapest prices out there, you can try <br/>
www.priceline.com and bid... you can&#39;t choose flight times, just <br/>
dates.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
