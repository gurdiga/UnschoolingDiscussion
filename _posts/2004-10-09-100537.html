<div id="ygrps-yiv-961530900"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I know almost nothing about what it might cost to buy a horse or pony<br/>
 </span></blockquote>these days, but at the local harvest festival the BLM had a booth with<br/>
information about adopting a wild horse or burro.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t post a lot on this list.. but I have been following the current horse topic with interest.. my dd&#39;s and I are horse people.. I&#39;ve owned horse&#39;s most of my life.. we currently have 2 Appaloosa&#39;s. I have given riding lessons from time to time. We have BLM adopt-a-horse sales here in my area,m that I have been to and I have friends that have had great success with adopting Mustangs. These horses are not for beginner riders! They need special handling.. they can be great horses when caught young, but they are not for those that are new to horses! They require very secure fencing and special care from someone who is familiar with handling horses. If your family were close to me.. I would gladly welcome a visit and give a few free lessons on my trusty horse Pebbles who is 18.. she is currently being ridden by my 9 yo dd.... the younger the rider the older the horse should be... is a very good thing go by.. just my two cents...<br/>

It&#39;s good to say so.  I would think people who actually rode horses would<br/>
understand this, but I guess that isn&#39;t always so.  My girls are advanced<br/>
beginners (they started jumping and cantering this summer) and I personally<br/>
wouldn&#39;t put them on a horse that was well trained.  It&#39;s important to me to<br/>
find a horse that I know has been treated well and that is sound.  We have a<br/>
great prospect we are going to look at tomorrow and I am SO excited.  I know<br/>
a lot of people get horses at auction but most of the time they are sent to<br/>
auction because there is something wrong with them or they have some<br/>
annoying vice.  Few people would send a great horse to aution.  A more<br/>
knowledgeable horse person might be able to deal with those things but in<br/>
our family, we are all beginners and so we want an safe older horse that<br/>
comes from a good home and has a good history and health record.<br/>
