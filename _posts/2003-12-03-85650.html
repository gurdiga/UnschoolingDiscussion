<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072444262">that bothers me when ds now 8 finds games he likes to play online.  I&#39;ve asked him not to play those games but then there will be another game he&#39;ll find and it feels wrong to keep asking him to find a different game if he doesn&#39;t seem to have an issue with it.  Yet it also doesn&#39;t feel right for ds (8) to play gory killing games (shooting games).  I&#39;d rather he saw something with sex in it than bloody violence yet I know lots of kids play these games but the parents might not like the kids to see movies or whatever with sex in it.  I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m so different about this and want to understand.<br/>
<br/>
The other day dd was playing a fishing game online that seemed &#39;innocent&#39; enough but then if the little fisherman catches one of a certain kind of fish his head will blow up.  The kids say it&#39;s not real but my instincts? tell me &#39;no&#39; don&#39;t let them see that?<br/>
<br/>
Am I trying to preserve an innocence or something?<br/>
<br/>
The shooting and killing used to bother me and maybe still does a bit but I think it&#39;s really the gore that bothers me the most especially for dc so young.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe, I really don&#39;t think kids are innocent (what in the heck does that really mean anyway?). Innocence is something adults impose on kids. Anyhow, I would think it&#39;s no big deal. I grew up on gory shooting games and I never confused it for reality. It&#39;s balance that&#39;s key. What worries do you have about it? How is it different in your mind from the violence that may be in a good war movie, book or role playing game? <br/>

world, and people abusing children, and about the horrible evils that real<br/>
people have committed against real people throughout history - as she<br/>
eventually must. That is the innocence about Jayn that I treasure. Jayn is<br/>
able to walk away from games that are too scary for her - usually it is the<br/>
creatures, or ghosts, that bother her.<br/>

I guess maybe it&#39;s because gore bothers &#39;me&#39;.  The more I see it I feel the less it bothers me but I&#39;m not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely have more fear? with dc my kids age seeing violent, bloody movies than reading it in a book or on a game because it&#39;s so much more intense for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember now that I&#39;ve always had an issue with gore even as a kid.  I never understood the total acceptance of the gore as &#39;just&#39; a part of the game or movie.  That is how kids or people who live these movies and games see it right?  <br/>
<br/>
I heard the director (sorry forget his name) of the film Kill Bill say how the movie was about extreme gore for the black humor of it.  ???  I so don&#39;t get that either!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-929893571">I agree...it does bother me too...my husband has found an online soldier-type game that he loves, and it&#39;s rather graphic. I try to tell myself it&#39;s a way for him to de-stress; but I&#39;d really prefer him to not play it when the kids are around. But he will say &quot;Oh, they aren&#39;t paying any attention to it&quot; but that isn&#39;t my point. <br/>
 <br/>
I know that chances are Logan will be attracted to that sort of thing when he is older...it&#39;s &quot;in his blood&quot; so to speak as a male. All I can do is try to teach him right and wrong, and to be safe around guns and such. <br/>
 <br/>
I know that they argue that children exposed to things like that are more likely to end up &quot;going postal&quot; or something...but the thing to remember is this: they were not only ignored by their classmates, but their parents as well. What we&#39;re giving our children by our lifestyle of respecting them, letting them be who they are, is a secure sense of self that those children didn&#39;t have that led to them feeling they needed to hurt others to prove who they were. I highly doubt our children will end up doing that, gory video games or not (especially if they fully understand that it is not reality). <br/>

Video games are not guns.<br/>
Really.<br/>

Even the ancient Nintendo Duckhunt is just a target game involving light.  <br/>
It&#39;s just light and pictures.  No ducks were ever harmed.  No dog actually ever <br/>

They are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are controlled and shamed are more likely to go postal.<br/>
And discussions of limiting access to one video game and not another are <br/>
discussions of control and shame.<br/>

Marty listens to some music I just haven&#39;t warmed up to yet.  It jitters me.  <br/>
I could tell him not to play it, but instead I bought it for him when it <br/>
first came out and we cooperate.  I try to be elsewhere, and he doesn&#39;t play it <br/>
too loudly.<br/>

It&#39;s not shooting and it&#39;s not killing, and it&#39;s not gore.  Real gore is hot <br/>
and smells, and would stain your carpet.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; power to affect us.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course things in our environment affect us.  But I think the issue<br/>
becomes one of degree or perhaps balance.  It is one thing to play shooting<br/>
games, it is another to be obsessed with violence.  If someone, adult or<br/>
child, is holed up in their room for days on end playing gory games,<br/>
listening to rape and pillage music......that is just so much different than<br/>
an adult or child who has many interests one of which is gory games or rape<br/>
and pillage music.<br/>
<br/>
My son, 10yo, loves guns, adores guns.  Used to go to the library and check<br/>
out &quot;The Shooter&#39;s Bible&quot; which is basically a gun catalog and just sit and<br/>
look through it for hours on end.  We were a bit worried because he seemed<br/>
so obsessed with little sense of what being shot does to a real life person.<br/>
So we signed him up for skeet shooting through 4-H.  We helped him channel<br/>
that in a socially acceptable manner.  He still loves guns but his talk<br/>
about them has matured tremendously and we know that he knows how to handle<br/>
one safely.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, 13yo, listens to music that I find tremendously offensive.  We<br/>
have a deal that she doesn&#39;t listen to it around the little kids.  I talked<br/>
to her about my reasons and she accepted them.  Without my ever asking her<br/>
to, she has always changed the radio station in the car when a song was<br/>
coming on that she knew would be offensive to me.  She is able to judge how<br/>
things affect others.<br/>

She is far more likely to know from title or opening bars when to switch than you who would not know until actually hearing the song......unless you too listen to that particular music at other times. <br/>

that love the visceral reaction they have to gore in movies and in video games <br/>
-- and that never, ever confuse the fantasy they use for release and <br/>
entertainment with their real lives.  My husband becomes physically ill when someone is <br/>
mistreated in real life -- he is the most gentle, fair, Golden Rule kind of <br/>
man I&#39;ve ever met.  If it takes violent video games and RPGs to turn out like <br/>
that, let me at &#39;em!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son plays video games because it&#39;s a bonding time for his papa and him.  I <br/>
started playing in order to join the bonding, and found out I really like <br/>
blasting things on a screen to bits.  (I used to shoot real guns, too, when I <br/>
dated an avid hunter, and I helped teach hunter safety at the time -- it is <br/>
important that kids know how to treat a real gun if they ever come across one.)  I <br/>
think it&#39;s the evolved hunter (as in hunter/gatherer) in all of us -- at one <br/>
time, hitting a target was one of the most important life skills that humans <br/>
had.  It&#39;s very satisfying to do this well, whether with a bow and arrow, or a <br/>
.22, or in a martial arts setting, or in a video game.<br/>
<br/>
Li-Young Li, a poet who writes truly beautiful stuff, once said that he loved <br/>
the old Kung Fu movies and the Jackie Chan movies because of their visceral <br/>
feel.  He criticized Ang Lee&#39;s _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_, because he <br/>
said that Ang Lee was all about surface beauty -- there was nothing underneath.  <br/>
There is something about having a safe but real release for violence, anger, <br/>
rage, and the satisfying thud of a well-landed punch -- there is something in <br/>
us (at least some of us) that needs this.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But it&#39;s equally obvious to me that these <br/>
differences have been dramatically reduced, just in our lifetimes, and that <br/>
the momentum <br/>
is toward erasing them.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In other people&#39;s lifetimes, there was real gore.  Meat wasn&#39;t handled in <br/>
refrigerated back rooms of supermarkets.  Babies weren&#39;t born at hospitals.  <br/>
People didn&#39;t die hooked up to IVs surrounded by strangers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In the end, I might wind up pretty much <br/>
where Sandra seems to be, but for me, there&#39;s a lot more to getting to that <br/>
place than simply accepting that whatever modern culture can throw at us has <br/>
no <br/>
power to affect us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime you might give messages to your son that won&#39;t do him any <br/>
good and that won&#39;t improve his regard for you.   <br/>
<br/>
Whatever ANY culture &quot;throws at&quot; people affects them.  Yet each person lives <br/>
within a culture.  This has been true since the beginning of time.<br/>
<br/>
Stepping outside one&#39;s culture is also a tradition:  monateries and <br/>
hermitages.   But even those exist within a culture, and the list of what they&#39;re <br/>
avoiding is more stark in its absence (they base their lives on its lack) than if <br/>
it were a casual occasional reality.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;       The unschooling angle on whether graphic entertainment has any <br/>
effect <br/>
and if so, what kind, fascinates me too &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is an unschooling angle on graphic entertainment not <br/>
having any effect.  I think I have a standing personal question for anyone who <br/>
believes that playing with imaginary guns (not even so real as toy guns, just <br/>
moving pictures of guns) will cause a male human to grow up violent, or cause him <br/>
any confusion at the end of a long session of video gaming about whether he <br/>
might have just caused loss of human life.  Or duck life.  (That one does have <br/>
a toy gun.  A big red plastic one.  But it doesn&#39;t have a toy duck.  Just <br/>
pixels flying by.)<br/>

<br/>
       I was nodding along with the rest of your post, though. :) JJ<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Sorry, I&#39;m new here. Took off on what seems to be a tangent and didn&#39;t <br/>
realize this was a standing point. :)<br/>
<br/>
       For myself, I don&#39;t believe any of the above. I haven&#39;t spent much <br/>
time thinking about guns OR blood, one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
       My unschooling male human is still little (8 years old) and though he <br/>
loves computer video games, so far he hasn&#39;t shown interest in guns or blood. <br/>
<br/>
       If and when he does, it will interest me. It might even concern me, <br/>
depending on how and when it manifests itself.  Whether I would actually DO <br/>
anything, I&#39;m pretty sure I would THINK about it a lot!<br/>
<br/>
       So it does interest me now to hear real stories about older <br/>
unschooling male humans with such interests (and their moms) who handle it all just <br/>
fine.<br/>
