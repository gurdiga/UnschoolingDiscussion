&lt;&lt;  For some odd <br/>
<br/>
reason, Keiran (4yo) has decided he would like to learn more about <br/>
<br/>
pirates???  IF you or anyone have any good suggestions there, let me <br/>
<br/>
know!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a pirates coloring book put out by either Dover or Bellerophon <br/>
that&#39;s pretty great!<br/>
There are Treasure Island movies galore.  You could just put them on for the <br/>
pictures and he could wander in and out but stay for the battles and other <br/>
good parts and ignore the boring dialog about maps and Bibles and innkeepers, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sites about lost treasures, and recovered treasures would be fun!<br/>
<br/>
One of the most serious yet embarrassing pirate studies is England during the <br/>
age of exploration, Elizabethan days, when &quot;letters of marque&quot; were given to <br/>
ships&#39; captains who were exempt from being charged with theft if they stole <br/>
from Spanish or Portuguese ships returning from the new world with gold and <br/>
other good stuff.  England didn&#39;t have to cross the sea, they just waited <br/>
until the Spanish got in range.  The Queen got a cut.  The BIG cut, I think, <br/>
and the captains got rank and privilege.<br/>
<br/>
The Pirates of Penzance is on video, attractively done, with Kevin Klein, <br/>
Angela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt.  That&#39;s fun, and a good intro to Gilbert & <br/>
Sullivan while you&#39;re at it.<br/>
