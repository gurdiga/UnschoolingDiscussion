<div id="ygrps-yiv-761814679">On allowing other adults to disrespect your child.....<br/>
<br/>
As someone so aptly put it....I don&#39;t have time for it. Oh...They <br/>
were talking about being around those who didn&#39;t agree with <br/>
unschooling, but I want to direct that towards how people treat my <br/>
child. I feel increasingly put out by the adults who think my kid is <br/>
rude because he&#39;s expected to kowtow to the adults in charge.<br/>
<br/>
A belated hello to all that may remember me. I&#39;ve been gone a little <br/>
while. I went to the SOS last year, Kelli may remember me because I <br/>
helped her with the raffle. I didn&#39;t realize how much I missed <br/>
reading here until today. As I was cruising through the discussion it <br/>
occured to me to ask y&#39;all if I was nuts about the above topic.<br/>
<br/>
On an outing this weekend my son showed displeasure about the <br/>
schedule and got nailed. The ole &quot;you just want your way and you&#39;re <br/>
not getting it&quot; adult stepped right in. Instead of some discussion to <br/>
resolve the situation, nothing but censure evolved.<br/>
<br/>
When he and I got a chance to review the problem, of course the <br/>
decision he made was to accept it....he wanted to continue to <br/>
participate. One wonders how much of this a child should have to <br/>
take. Sara in NC</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, yes. Just because my child doesn&#39;t want to hug you (general you), doesn&#39;t make them rude. It&#39;s their choice, it&#39;s their body, it&#39;s their space. You may not speak to them in a harsh tone of voice simply because they do not comply to YOUR requests! I had a problem with a woman at church several years ago over this issue. She felt that not only should children obey their parents, but they should also obey any other adult within the church, without question. I. think. not. Aside from her, I mostly feel uncomfortable when adults attempt to demand that my children do this or that. I&quot;m not sure what to say, or what to do. With the above mentioned woman I never even really  confronted her about it. I just avoided her whenever possible. I hate feeling like that. <br/>

when kids are rude at my house (meaning mean to my kids, or destructive, or <br/>
they disregard what I want even though it&#39;s my house).<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re in my house and ignore a polite request and an explanation and a <br/>
&quot;thanks,&quot; and if half an hour later my daughter is screaming because they&#39;re <br/>
into her stuff AGAIN, I can speak to that child in a harsh tone of voice.   <br/>
<br/>
If my children go to your house and seem to not give a rat&#39;s ass what you or <br/>
your children want or ask them to do or not to do, feel free to speak to them <br/>
in a harsh voice.<br/>
<br/>
(The odds of my kids not caring what other people want seem, in my <br/>
experience, to be nil, because we have always tried to care about what they wanted, and <br/>
thanked them really nicely when we saw them being generous with other kids.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I agree, that&#39;s goofy.<br/>
On the other hand, if what she was asking them to do was church policy or <br/>
simple courtesy (don&#39;t run across pews or scream in the yard during a baptism or <br/>
whatever), then they should&#39;ve complied not because it was an adult, but <br/>
because it made sense.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I mostly feel uncomfortable when adults attempt to demand that my children <br/>
do this or that. I&quot;m not sure what to say, or what to do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends what your kids were doing and where, and how and why the <br/>
adult made the request.<br/>

<br/>
Me-It boiled down to schedule and what three young teen boys could <br/>
do, one boy didn&#39;t want to do what the other two did so I was there <br/>
and I stayed with him while the other two did an activity that was <br/>
planned ahead but not timed into that day. The host mother basically <br/>
told them what to do after first telling them they could do whatever <br/>
they could agree on. So of course the decision he made was to accept <br/>
it....he wanted to continue to participate. One wonders how much of <br/>
this a child should have to take. See....she didn&#39;t allow discussion <br/>
after she told them to figure it out. She just got stung when my son <br/>
wanted to do something the other boy didn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra-Not knowing the situation, I&#39;m inclined to think if he went on <br/>
an outing organized by someone else, he has agreed in advance to <br/>
participate willingly.<br/>
<br/>
I did remind him when there were three or four kids not all the time <br/>
would everyone agree, to go with the best thing for the group before <br/>
we went. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my gripe with adults is that I&#39;ve tried so hard to teach him <br/>
to respect adults yet when he honestly shows disappointment many <br/>
think he is rude. And I have talked to him about how important using <br/>
the right language is. Sometimes I see hear kids being so called rude <br/>
but it&#39;s more of a blunt and honest statement to me.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
I feel very angry when my children are ordered around, especially <br/>
when they&#39;ve already willingly helped in some way. Sometimes other <br/>
adults have questioned me on their ability to do helpful tasks, <br/>
basically belittling them, thinking they can&#39;t handle something. I <br/>
agree that they must be taught to live in the world; I know people <br/>
won&#39;t change but I want children respected and I don&#39;t feel it <br/>
happens much at all. Maybe I&#39;m expecting too much and maybe my child <br/>
is rude too. I was very meek and guilt ridden at his age and would do <br/>
anything for anyone to the point of unhealthiness. I look back and <br/>
see how abused I was by certain neighbors and family. I would never <br/>
speak up for myself and this is why I want him to be able to express <br/>
his wants....I want someone to listen to him, to all the kids....not <br/>
just make decisions for them. I can&#39;t decide which is better, <br/>
occasional rudeness with the possiblity of getting nailed or staying <br/>
mute and feeling low about it. And then again, I could be like I <br/>
think these adults are and maybe not care. I guess my personal <br/>
experience has me sensitive about it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling includes a great deal of personal freedom, some might say <br/>
to the point of selfishness. I like for my son to make decisions and <br/>
do his own thing. I decided to homeschool when he was three; I don&#39;t <br/>
remember how I heard of it. I soon realized I had unschooled him from <br/>
birth after exploring the movement.</div>

<br/>
My kids are really not selfish.  They&#39;re considerate, sometimes to a fault.   <br/>
Given a choice between getting their way and hurting someone else&#39;s feelings, <br/>
they usually &quot;go with the guest,&quot; and let the other kid choose.  Some of <br/>
their guests seem to have had no such inspiration or thoughts, and that&#39;s when it <br/>
gets rough.  Negotiating is one thing.  Grabbing is another.  Some kids, <br/>
knowing my kids will likely accommodate them, get very grabby (of <br/>
time/attention/plans) and in such cases I have been known to step in and say &quot;HEY!  Can you <br/>
share the power?&quot;   And if the answer&#39;s sure, which it usually is, the problem is <br/>
over.  If the answer&#39;s no, sometimes a kid goes home earlier than planned.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I like for my son to make decisions and do his own thing. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids make lots of decisions, but they know there are differences of time <br/>
and place that limit their rights and freedoms.<br/>
<br/>
There are some rude adults, but I&#39;ve been exposed to some kids who really <br/>
truly didn&#39;t seem to have the concept of boundaries or courtesy, and that&#39;s <br/>
embarrassing when the justification is unschooling-related.<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences work convinces me that some people <br/>
have more interpersonal intelligence than others, and the self-knowing <br/>
inTRApersonal intelligence can be helpful too.  When a child doesn&#39;t have much of that <br/>
naturally, I think the parent needs to help equip him with other tricks or <br/>
tools to help make up for it.   When the child doesn&#39;t have much and the parent <br/>
doesn&#39;t either, that&#39;s when the problems are worst.<br/>

I agree, if a child does get tiresome in his continuing demands <br/>
without thought of what can work for everyone....let him go. When <br/>
this happens in our home, I do try to talk to them and give them a <br/>
voice several times before they go. This is the child that I feel <br/>
isn&#39;t respected where he lives. Normally a respected child doesn&#39;t <br/>
have too many problems within a group. I have less problem working <br/>
with the kids than the adult they belong to.<br/>
