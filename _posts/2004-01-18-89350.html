<div id="ygrps-yiv-758445247">I&#39;m having a very difficult time with Sarah lately...I know that I have tended to ask alot of her because she&#39;s so much older than the Littles. I&#39;ve done my best to back off since last November when we started unschooling completely. We&#39;ve always asked that the kids help out with things as they are able to, so that wasn&#39;t really needing to be changed. If they say no, for the most part it&#39;s not a big deal. However, if Paul is on duty, then Sarah especially needs to help me more...what needed to change there was for me to stop asking for &quot;help&quot; all the time with things I could really do myself. I&#39;ve done rather well with that...but when I ask her help she will NOT listen, and will do anything BUT what I&#39;ve asked her to do. I&#39;ve explained over and over that this is NOT being helpful to me at all.<br/>
 <br/>
For example, this past week Megan and Logan have both been very sick. Paul is on duty this week (he&#39;ll be home tomorrow thankfully!!) At the start of the week, when Paul went on duty I explained to Sarah that I was going to need her help with alot more things, because I&#39;d need to give so much attention to the Littles because they are so sick. <br/>
 <br/>
I ask her to help me in very specific ways. IE: &quot;Sarah, Gracie is hungry. I need you to sit and hold Gracie and give her her bottle.&quot; (Logan is throwing up right then and I&#39;m trying to help him..this is what was just going on a few minutes ago) Instead of sitting and holding Gracie and feeding her, Sarah&#39;s up walking around with her! Gracie&#39;s screaming because this isn&#39;t what she is wanting!! I tell her &quot;Sarah, go sit down with her and feed her her bottle!&quot; and she says &quot;But she wants this (walking around).&quot; and I explain &quot;Sarah, she&#39;s screaming her head off, which means that is NOT what she&#39;s wanting! She is crying her HUNGRY cry! Sit and feed her PLEASE!&quot; (Yes, at this point, while Logan is throwing up and I&#39;m trying to keep him calm and keep vomit from getting on the floor...I&#39;m getting angry at her). <br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t seem to get it through her head (and she&#39;s done this for the past couple years now, by the way..the oppositional thing) that doing what SHE wants to do like that isn&#39;t helping me. <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m thinking maybe I need to change my perspective on this..but I&#39;m not sure how! Do I give her more ways of helping whenever possible or just quit asking her for help of any kind? How do I handle things when there really is no other way for her to be helpful other than doing something very specific like feeding Gracie while I&#39;m helping Logan while he&#39;s throwing up? <br/>
 <br/>
SIGH...I know there has got to be a better way than butting heads over &quot;helping.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313285934">**SIGH...I know there has got to be a better way than butting heads over <br/>
&quot;helping.&quot;<br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
I have this wild-assed idea that maybe she&#39;s practicing &quot;saying no&quot; and <br/>
&quot;setting boundaries&quot; based on watching you start to do it with your <br/>
neighbor and friend.  Um... she&#39;s learning she doesn&#39;t HAVE to be a <br/>
&quot;people pleaser&quot;, and that&#39;s a good thing in many ways.  (Albeit a pain <br/>
for you right now.)<br/>
<br/>
Different idea: read some of the sections in parenting books or women&#39;s <br/>
magazines about some of the issues when wives want husbands to help <br/>
around the house.  The parallel is that in that case, as with your <br/>
daughter, the helper wants to use his or her judgement and the <br/>
mother/wife wants to specify exactly what should be done.  Men hate <br/>
that, I hear, so maybe kids hate it too.  (Yes, you were right about the <br/>
baby needed to be fed, but many people don&#39;t like to be instructed on <br/>
how to interact with a baby.  It makes sense that husbands and older <br/>
children eventually do need to learn to read the baby&#39;s cues and needs <br/>
by reading the signals themselves.  Your daughter&#39;s intentions in this <br/>
case could have been really good.<br/>
<br/>
(Obviously I don&#39;t know the details of other bursts of uncooperativeness <br/>
and why she isn&#39;t pitching in, so my ideas about her motives are really <br/>
really only loosely based in fact &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
I know this may sound smug, and I&#39;m sorry for &quot;Monday morning <br/>
quarterbacking you&quot;.  Mothering is really a tough gig when dad is away. <br/>
  I really respect how much work it is.<br/>

<br/>
**I ask her to help me in very specific ways. IE: &quot;Sarah, Gracie is <br/>

<br/>
This doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;asking&quot;, it sounds like &quot;telling&quot;.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s important to be clear about the difference.</div>

<br/>
What I&#39;m seeing in your interactions is Sarah trying to do something to help<br/>

<br/>
So I think you have to let go of the control. If Sarah wasn&#39;t there, the<br/>
baby would cry while you helped Logan or Logan would throw up on his own or<br/>
you&#39;d hold the baby the best you could while helping your son.<br/>
<br/>
Ask her for whatever help she can give, offer some suggestions and then let<br/>
go. You could say, &quot;Would you mind doing something with the baby? Maybe you<br/>
could try giving her a bottle, since that sounds like her hungry cry to me,&quot;<br/>
then let go of control. (That&#39;ll be the hard part!) And when the crisis is<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re thinking in the moment. You want the right kind of help right<br/>
now. But that type of reaction makes withdrawals from the relationship that<br/>
you pay for in the future: a child who is less willing to help because she<br/>
feels that what she can do is unappreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe by this age she should be feeling compassion and wanting to jump in to<br/>
help, but she&#39;s been set back because she feels what she can do isn&#39;t wanted<br/>
or appreciated. Or maybe she&#39;s still in the development phase of not being<br/>
able to see with compassion. All she sees is a mom whose taken on more kids<br/>
than she can handle and is dumping the excess on her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help to reread what you wrote and substitute yourself in for<br/>
Sarah and your husband in for yourself. Imagine that he&#39;s doing something<br/>
that seems totally ridiculous to you, like juggling flaming torches and<br/>
wants you to handle one set in a particular way while he handles the ones<br/>
that are giving him trouble. That&#39;s quite likely the way she sees it until<br/>
she can get to the point where she knows whatever help she can do will be<br/>
appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319743243">Asking for help is fine, if you are TRULY asking.  But EXPECTING help is altogether different.  It sounds like you told her to help, and then got upset at how she was helping.  That may not make helping sound very desirable to her.  It wouldn&#39;t me either.<br/>
<br/>
You were upset because she didn&#39;t know the baby&#39;s hungry cry.  Did you know that cry from square one?  Maybe you did since you&#39;re the mom, but your daughter may not.  Your daughter may need to be given the chance to recognize the differences in the baby&#39;s signals, just like anyone else would.  And the baby may have gotten used to being walked around while sis is feeding her if you had given her the chance.  It may not be the way YOU do it, but for some reason, your daughter thought it was the right thing to do at the time.  Maybe she would have changed her mind and sat down eventually, or maybe the baby would have calmed down and gotten used to being carried, but you didn&#39;t give either of them the chance to adjust.  You got upset.  You made demands of your helper to do things your way.  <br/>
<br/>
I understand that this all happened in the heat of the moment, and I&#39;m not saying that any of it is easy.  It&#39;s not.  Sometimes it&#39;s impossibly hard, I know.  But it all comes down to choices, and instead of giving your daughter choices, you gave demands.  Even a sugar coated demand is still a demand.  <br/>
<br/>
My universal rule when asking for help is:  Be nice to the helper.<br/>
<br/>

which means that is NOT what she&#39;s wanting! She is crying her HUNGRY cry! Sit <br/>

--------------<br/>
So two people were screaming?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t seem to get it through her head (and she&#39;s done this for the past <br/>
couple years now, by the way..the oppositional thing) that doing what SHE <br/>
wants to do like that isn&#39;t helping me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then what you&#39;re doing/saying isn&#39;t likely to &quot;get it through her head.&quot;  It <br/>
might not be the fault of her or her head.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are too controlled they rebel against it.  That&#39;s the principle <br/>
behind all of this unschooling business.  If you tell them what theyhave to <br/>
read/write/add and when and how, that becomes what they don&#39;t want to do.  They <br/>
resent reading/writing/adding and they come to resent the person who is trying to <br/>
force it on them.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it works with other things in life too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I give her more ways of helping whenever possible or just quit asking <br/>
her for help of any kind? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those involve being nicer to her or thanking her profusely.<br/>
<br/>
What is she getting out of living in the family?  Does she feel empowered and <br/>
free, or is she treated like a child (and a bad child)?<br/>
<br/>
I read Joyce&#39;s advice.   I agree with it as a thought, but I know it&#39;s <br/>
frustrating to need another pair of hands and someone standing right there, and not <br/>
helping.  But a balance would help.  If you get help in an emergency or with <br/>
the interesting part, that&#39;s probably all you should count on, and if you&#39;re <br/>
then resentful for not getting more, the person might not want to help in the <br/>
next emergency, or might not find your stuff very interesting afterward.<br/>
<br/>
I have a tall husband and two tall sons.  I&#39;m willing to get a chair and <br/>
climb up to get something off a top shelf if they&#39;re not home, but it&#39;s easier for <br/>
me and safer if I ask for help.  But I wouldn&#39;t decide to empty and clean all <br/>
the high shelves, expecting their help, and getting grumpy if they weren&#39;t <br/>
willing to invest an hour of their life on short notice because I suddenly <br/>
thought we really needed new shelf paper up high or something.<br/>
<br/>
I know sick chldren isn&#39;t something you thought up, but it&#39;s possible that a <br/>
quiet mom would help them get better faster than a frustrated and furious mom. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do you have a baby carrier?  A backpack?  Could you carry the baby while you <br/>
take care of the boys?   Can you nest up in one room and put on peaceful <br/>
movies and rub their heads or hold their hands until they fall asleep?   Quiet <br/>
sleep is better for getting well than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
People value physical things over mental and internal too often.  <br/>
<br/>
Puke on the floor can be cleaned up.  A failing relationship with another <br/>
human is much, much harder to undo.<br/>

Having thought about this through the night, I have to agree with your last point. It doesn&#39;t seem like I&#39;m asking at all by what I&#39;m saying..and Sarah is very literal. &quot;Telling&quot; is setting up a confrontational situation..Looks like I need to choose my words more carefully and make sure that I&#39;m truly &quot;asking!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Mamabeth, I just want to say thank you because you keep bringing up issues and revealing things that I&#39;m not sure I myself would. Inevitably your questions, as much as the responses, have me thinking about how I approach parenting and unschooling and push me along as much as some of the books and articles I&#39;ve read. This thread in particular has opened my eyes to how I treat my oldest. You have a lot of guts to keep laying yourself bare like you do and I admire that. Thanks again! :) <br/>

Thanks...I actually don&#39;t have my baby carrier right now..it&#39;s over at &quot;best friend&#39;s&quot; house. I was just thinking this morning that I REALLY need to go get it, because yes, I could do more for Gracie myself AND for the other kids by wearing her. <br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve given me alot to think about...although, with the one point..Megan has preferred the couch to sleep on for nearly a year now, and Logan for about a month. So we are often piled up on it snuggling and watching TV.<br/>

-=-Gracie&#39;s screaming because this isn&#39;t what she is wanting!! I tell her <br/>
&quot;Sarah, go sit down with her and feed her her bottle!&quot; and she says &quot;But she <br/>
wants this (walking around).&quot; and I explain &quot;Sarah, she&#39;s screaming her head off, <br/>
which means that is NOT what she&#39;s wanting! She is crying her HUNGRY cry! Sit <br/>
and feed her PLEASE!&quot; -=-<br/>
--------------<br/>
So two people were screaming?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t seem to get it through her head (and she&#39;s done this for the past <br/>
couple years now, by the way..the oppositional thing) that doing what SHE <br/>
wants to do like that isn&#39;t helping me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Then what you&#39;re doing/saying isn&#39;t likely to &quot;get it through her head.&quot;  It <br/>
might not be the fault of her or her head.<br/>
<br/>
If kids are too controlled they rebel against it.  That&#39;s the principle <br/>
behind all of this unschooling business.  If you tell them what theyhave to <br/>
read/write/add and when and how, that becomes what they don&#39;t want to do.  They <br/>
resent reading/writing/adding and they come to resent the person who is trying to <br/>
force it on them.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it works with other things in life too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I give her more ways of helping whenever possible or just quit asking <br/>
her for help of any kind? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those involve being nicer to her or thanking her profusely.<br/>
<br/>
What is she getting out of living in the family?  Does she feel empowered and <br/>
free, or is she treated like a child (and a bad child)?<br/>
<br/>
I read Joyce&#39;s advice.   I agree with it as a thought, but I know it&#39;s <br/>
frustrating to need another pair of hands and someone standing right there, and not <br/>
helping.  But a balance would help.  If you get help in an emergency or with <br/>
the interesting part, that&#39;s probably all you should count on, and if you&#39;re <br/>
then resentful for not getting more, the person might not want to help in the <br/>
next emergency, or might not find your stuff very interesting afterward.<br/>
<br/>
I have a tall husband and two tall sons.  I&#39;m willing to get a chair and <br/>
climb up to get something off a top shelf if they&#39;re not home, but it&#39;s easier for <br/>
me and safer if I ask for help.  But I wouldn&#39;t decide to empty and clean all <br/>
the high shelves, expecting their help, and getting grumpy if they weren&#39;t <br/>
willing to invest an hour of their life on short notice because I suddenly <br/>
thought we really needed new shelf paper up high or something.<br/>
<br/>
I know sick chldren isn&#39;t something you thought up, but it&#39;s possible that a <br/>
quiet mom would help them get better faster than a frustrated and furious mom. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a baby carrier?  A backpack?  Could you carry the baby while you <br/>
take care of the boys?   Can you nest up in one room and put on peaceful <br/>
movies and rub their heads or hold their hands until they fall asleep?   Quiet <br/>
sleep is better for getting well than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
People value physical things over mental and internal too often.  <br/>
<br/>
Puke on the floor can be cleaned up.  A failing relationship with another <br/>
human is much, much harder to undo.<br/>

I thought I was doing so well but I still have that baggage where I think that she should be lending a hand at times (It&#39;s to be expected and not worthy of a thank you, when do I get a thank you? Ouch, thanks mom)  instead of considering her help to be a gift when it does happen. <br/>
  Thank you, thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-235532728">I�m going to go out on a limb here and suggest something completely<br/>
different. Elizabeth you post a lot, and the list volume at the moment is<br/>
high. When I am extra busy with things, or need to focus my attention<br/>
somewhere like completing a draft of my script, I go no-mail temporarily. I<br/>
don�t feel that I have missed anything because the archives can always be<br/>
checked, but even more so because the topics on the list are very cyclic.<br/>
Pretty much every issue comes back. Perhaps you should consider going<br/>
no-mail only when your dh is on duty, and then coming back when he is there.<br/>
Or at least while you have youngsters who are ill. We�ll be here when you<br/>
get back, or have a specific question, promise.<br/>
