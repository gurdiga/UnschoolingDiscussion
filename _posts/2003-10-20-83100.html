<div id="ygrps-yiv-371624349">Hello dear listmates-<br/>
<br/>
I have just finished reading a very thought-provoking interview with Noam<br/>
Chomsky in the October issue of The Sun and wanted to pass along the<br/>
following quote of Chomsky&#39;s from that article:<br/>
<br/>
	&quot;You have to be critical of whatever is presented to you in any media. Of<br/>
course, the whole media system and the educational system are designed to<br/>
drive critical thoughts from your mind. You&#39;re taught to be a passive,<br/>
obedient follower. And unless you can break out of those habits, you&#39;ll be<br/>
a victim of propoganda. But it&#39;s not that hard to break out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, congratulations to each of you for breaking out - and for raising<br/>
critical thinkers!<br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
