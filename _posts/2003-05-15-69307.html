I don&#39;t recall you ever making a point about unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
But over the last weeks you have implied you care more about your<br/>
children than others care about theirs, you care more about being a good<br/>
mother than others do, and now you care more about social injustice and<br/>
change than others.   <br/>
<br/>
You post and then deny you wrote what you did and blame others for<br/>
misunderstanding you.<br/>
<br/>
Name calling would be less insulting.<br/>

if you perceive it that I care more than you, then what?  Do I change how I <br/>
mother or parent or others to suit you?  Nope, I am what I am.<br/>
<br/>
I care deeply about my children and about being the best mother that I can <br/>
be, I suspect everyone here does as well, or they wouldn&#39;t be here.<br/>
<br/>
You are free at anytime to post about your feeling on motherhood, parenting <br/>
your children, social injustice or even farts it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I never once said anything about my way being better or more than anyone <br/>
else&#39;s at all.<br/>
<br/>
I just have posted how I personally feel, as have others.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t blame anyone if they didn&#39;t understand a post, I try to clarify <br/>
it.  Of course you aren&#39;t in my head when I wrote nor in the circumstance I <br/>
was describing so when you respond and it&#39;s different or words were pulled <br/>
out, then I try to clarify it.<br/>
<br/>
Heck who cares, whatever anyone thinks they are going to think.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
MANY others come back and try to clarify or explain or validate statements <br/>
they made early and it passes but others get posted to death. Yes, it begs a <br/>
response when one posts to you directly about your post, so I do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if in someway you&#39;ve felt I&#39;ve said you were less than as a parent, <br/>
mother, or whatever but that is just not the case.<br/>

with real emotions, and obviously their need to be understood on something <br/>
they feel passionate about is important to them.  Sorry guys....<br/>
<br/>
Our unschooling is going pretty good....I have begun taking the kids in <br/>
school to the library once a week and encouraging them to get books on <br/>
ANYTHING that interests them...helping then find where they are located in <br/>
the library...I am amazed too, at the number of good movies and books on tape <br/>
our library has.  We have always gotten &quot;fun&quot; movies but the have massive <br/>
amounts of educational stuff too.  <br/>
<br/>
This year instead of buying any curriculum, I&#39;m going to buy games, and <br/>
better toys...also some wood and supplies for tree-houses.  :o)  Maybe some <br/>
tools too!!  A new monitor for an older computer...another bean bag chair or <br/>
two!!  Can&#39;t wait to get those in school home...hoping the judge (for foster <br/>
boys) will allow it...<br/>

I didn&#39;t CALL someone a friggin&#39; idiot.<br/>
I said that if someone couldn&#39;t see the benefit to children and to peace in <br/>
families because of the efforts of people who help other people unschool, <br/>
then she was a friggin&#39; idiot.<br/>
<br/>
IS there anyone here who can&#39;t see that???<br/>
<br/>
If everyone here understands that by helping families unschool and by helping <br/>
parents be more aware and kind and patient with their children, that by <br/>
seeing their children as people instead of drape apes (or pick your own <br/>
hateful name for children) that they are MUCH less likely to be child <br/>
abusers, and so the work here we do DOES help prevent child abuse, THEN <br/>
nobody here is a friggin&#39; idiot.<br/>

Are if/then statements too high-level for these discussions?<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;We can help one child at a time, one person at a time.  We can be loving<br/>
parents and give our children a wonderful upbringing and STILL have time to<br/>
help those who need help along the way.<br/>
If only one child is spared the suffering the is oft times described in the<br/>
news media isn&#39;t it worth that one child&#39;s life to CARE?<br/>
We cannot sit in our peaceful little worlds and ignore the pain and<br/>
suffering<br/>
happening right outside our doorsteps.  Nor do we have to turn our backs on<br/>
our children and families to make a difference.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;how incredibly insulting is that?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see it insulting at all. Not directed at any one person or even<br/>
this group. I read it as in all of us, the world can&#39;t just sit by and not<br/>
help. I didn&#39;t see where she meant that any one of us in particular &quot;were&quot;<br/>
sitting by not caring. I think a lot of it has to do with who it came from<br/>
too. I do believe some people here just can&#39;t deal with her postings bcause<br/>
of what happened in tha past. And as much as someone might say they have no<br/>
idea where the post came from because they don&#39;t look, when a thread goes on<br/>
as long as that one did, one does know who the poster is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s akin to some &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot; dismissing you with being &quot;just a<br/>
mother&quot;. It&#39;s akin to a husband saying to a stay at home mom &quot;Yeah, but you<br/>
don&#39;t do anything all day.&quot; She shouldn&#39;t call him a &quot;friggin&#39; idiot&quot;. It<br/>
won&#39;t help the situation. It will probably make it worse. But I&#39;d certainly<br/>
understand a wife who did.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I guess that&#39;s just the difference in some people. I have never called<br/>
anyone a friggin idiot or even gotten so pissed about a posting on a<br/>
discussion board. If it&#39;s that disrupting to someone, they should delete or<br/>
walk away and do something else helpful and come back another time to deal<br/>
with it. And just for the record I am NOT talking about anyone in<br/>
particular. I&#39;m sure plenty of people here were also pissed as well as<br/>
plenty of people seeing where it shouldn&#39;t have been so volatile.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes, and that dynamic involved a single poster on this list.  That is why the term &quot;friggon idiot&#39; even in an &quot;if/then&quot; situation, could rightly be interpreted to mean that particular poster.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, there *is* a double standard on this list about who can say what here.  I agree that there are a few people here who bend over backwards to help with unschooling.  And I agree, there are dynamics, but that is NO excuse for even using that kind of terminology on a list that is *supposed* to be promoting peace.<br/>
<br/>
It is *because* of that dynamic that the term could be applied to that single poster, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who saw it that way.   ANd it is because that dynamic exists that those involved should have taken a step back instead of continuing the thread.<br/>
<br/>
I think *everyone* should be taking your advice:  If someone doesn&#39;t want their own words misinterpreted, then they should refrain from posting them until they think about them some more.  It is the POSTER&#39;s responsibility to post in such a way that they are not misunderstood.  You&#39;ve told Glena that, and I think the same should go for Sandra and everyone else here.<br/>

doing NOTHING to solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
So I said &quot;we can&#39;t solve the huge eternal problem and bringing it home <br/>
destroys our own family&#39;s peace,&quot; and there was an insulting non-sequitor <br/>
which seemed ignorant of the value of this list and of people spending as <br/>
much as twelve years volunteering to help others homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
IF there is someone who really can&#39;t understand why this list is worth <br/>
defending, then perhaps that person should just shrug and not worry instead <br/>
of trying to get others to value it less as well.<br/>

I don&#39;t whine about it.<br/>

I don&#39;t explain myself six or eight times, and I don&#39;t deny what I said.  <br/>
It&#39;s there in the archives.  People can cut and paste it back.<br/>
<br/>
I also try not to waste people&#39;s times.<br/>
I also don&#39;t come in here saying &quot;whatever works&quot; or that other things are as <br/>
valid as unschooling, or that it MIGHT be important to teach phonics if you <br/>
want your kids to go to college, or whatever from the pile of things which  <br/>
have come up here and WILL come up here as new people come in and are not <br/>
committed to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There are some posters who aren&#39;t fully into the unschooling flow, who aren&#39;t <br/>
really sure themselves, or haven&#39;t quite gotten it to work yet.  And if their <br/>
suggestions are gumming up the smooth flow of information when someone comes <br/>
in here to get good ideas quickly, then that person isn&#39;t as valuable to the <br/>
process as other people are.  And we ARE involved in a process here.<br/>
<br/>
If you were running a La Leche League meeting and one attendee kept saying <br/>
&quot;Well bottles aren&#39;t all THAT bad,&quot; or &quot;I let my baby cry himself to sleep <br/>
sometimes, and he&#39;s fine!&quot; would you just let that person get the last word?  <br/>
No problem?<br/>
<br/>
If someone came to your meeting and consistently helped others with their <br/>

Yes, we do run the risk of misinterpretation.  And most of the time its easily cleared up, and no we don&#39;t explain ourselves half a dozen times (which by itself indicates a problem and works on my nerves too).<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I also think that we should all be more careful with what we say, not in an attempt to glaze things over or to &quot;make nice&quot;.  I accept the fact that this list examines ideas closely and it can be a tough experience, I&#39;ve been there myself.<br/>
<br/>
But there is no reason to even use &quot;friggon idiot&quot; or to later come back with &quot;cash bets?&quot;.  They do not further unschooling, they do not help anyone understand unschooling and this is an unschooling list promoting peaceful relationships between parents and children, who are considered more than just children.  They are considered people.  So, by extension, this list is about promoting peaceful relationships between PEOPLE.<br/>

How many times can someone say &quot;I can say no more&quot; and then come back and say <br/>

They will probably joke around while they&#39;re working.  They might take a <br/>
break and play cards.  Not ALL those things are bridgebuilding, nor do all <br/>
their actions have to be analagous to bridge-bulding principles.  Sometimes <br/>
they will stop to take a crap, but the bridge isn&#39;t build out of crap, and <br/>
analogies between bridges and toity breaks don&#39;t all have to hold to the high <br/>

presented. &quot;This is not the place to be saying these things&quot; isn&#39;t <br/>
the tone I&#39;ve seen in some of the replies to the klutzy newbees. <br/>
Aggravation and annoyance come across loud and clear, when someone <br/>
(unwittingly, I&#39;m sure) says &quot;whatever works!&quot; because she thinks <br/>
that&#39;s what it is about, and someone else says something like &quot;What <br/>
on EARTH did you say THAT for? sheesh...&quot; etc. That IS the tone that <br/>
I have often seen in these endless bickering posts. Someone says <br/>
something basically clueless and/or damaging to the idea of <br/>
unschooling, and someone blasts her. Does she get defensive? Really? <br/>
do tell. wonder why. <br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t anything like being taken aside and told differently in a <br/>
calm, accepting tone of voice. It&#39;s like having the leader of the <br/>
group shouting it across the room in front of everyone.<br/>

it more as a way of questioning whether someone would really do <br/>
something they have said they would do.  The particular poster in <br/>
question has on several occasions on more than one thread, said they <br/>
were dropping the subject or other finalistic comments like that when <br/>
that was the farthest thing from the truth.  Then there she was, not <br/>
dropping it or doing what she said.  So I think we all had every <br/>

They didn&#39;t offend me at all.  But it sure didn&#39;t make me feel better, even for a moment.  Instead my stomach sank right to the floor. <br/>
<br/>
I really like this list. It is definitely one of a kind. I&#39;ve learned A LOT.  My kids have really benefitted from my being here.   I want to learn more.  <br/>
<br/>
I know this is not a support list, but it does provide a measure of support when I know that there others like me who share the same vision of what learning should be all about.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, all this bickering is getting to the point that I can&#39;t learn anything or even feel that I have something in common with others here because I can&#39;t bear to even *read* the list much less weed through it all to find those gems of information that really stick with me.<br/>
<br/>
So, for that reason, I&#39;m just gently and sincerely asking that those who do not quite understand unschooling please READ more, and those who are infuriated please walk away for awhile before responding with quips that end up adding fuel to the fire.<br/>

How many times can you say that, though, without it seeming you need the last <br/>
word on the topic?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re running a LLL meeting, you&#39;re representative of a larger entity and <br/>
can&#39;t really decide to let a meeting get to the point where people are pissed <br/>
off.  Your goal is to help the quiet moms feel safe coming back, and do what <br/>
you can to make the information they receive be really helpful to them on the <br/>
way home, later that day, that night....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-705297011">***Joyce, there *is* a double standard on this list about who can say<br/>
what here.  I agree that there are a few people here who bend over<br/>
backwards to help with unschooling.  And I agree, there are dynamics, but<br/>
that is NO excuse for even using that kind of terminology on a list that<br/>
is *supposed* to be promoting peace.***<br/>
<br/>
This list promotes unschooling in it&#39;s best moments.  Not all moments are<br/>
the best ones.<br/>
<br/>
Why on earth do we have to coddle every tender personality who comes here<br/>
insulting unschoolers time and time again and taking up billions and<br/>
billions of hours of our time?   What is wrong with expecting someone to<br/>
tell the truth, say what they mean and not use ten more posts trying to<br/>
deny she said what she said?<br/>
Am I taking crazy pills?   Because I just don&#39;t know why we need to baby<br/>
sit people who don&#39;t make an effort to be clear and honest.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
why we need to be gentle with insulting posters, but totally unforgiving<br/>
when it comes to someone who volunteers every day to help people get to<br/>
unschooling; someone who&#39;s been there for every single person on this<br/>
list, even the pain in the ass variety.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has time and time again responded with helpful and honest<br/>
information to poster I would have throttled if I could have.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I&#39;d sent that post Sandra sent, in a moment of extreme<br/>
frustration, on a day when someone she loved was gone forever.   <br/>
<br/>
I wish I&#39;d sent it so you all could get over it.<br/>

He&#39;d been gone for years by then, but things here did stir it back up.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that I&#39;m held to a higher standard by some of the list <br/>
critics here.  And it&#39;s interesting that there are perpetual list critics who <br/>
seem to think their job is just to reiterate how the list sucks when there&#39;s <br/>
a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m used to this from the SCA.  Because I have rank and was for many years a <br/>
kingdom or corporate level officer, I&#39;m really used to people who aren&#39;t <br/>
great contributors to the organization being critical of the actions of those <br/>
who are not only active in the arts and medieval re-creations but also in the <br/>
administration.  There are people who&#39;ve never made a costume of their own, <br/>
who don&#39;t have armor (and don&#39;t fight because they might get hurt), who don&#39;t <br/>
like to camp, who aren&#39;t particular about whether music is period or not, who <br/>
will bring their own food to feasts because they don&#39;t like medieval food but <br/>
will write LONG letters bitching about something the board of directors did <br/>
that doesn&#39;t even affect them directly.  That kind of &quot;hobby&quot; mystifies me, <br/>
and I see that in some of the people here (and some who are gone) and other <br/>
unschooling discussion places.  <br/>
<br/>
It bothers me the way super-critical movie reviews bother me.  <br/>
<br/>
If a person who couldn&#39;t make a movie to save his LIFE says one sucks, but <br/>
many OTHER people liked it, what is he hoping to prove?<br/>
<br/>
If someone who doesn&#39;t much do the thing which is being criticized is then <br/>
critical, the value of that criticism is small and suspect.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t criticize anyone else&#39;s swimming or cooking.  <br/>
I KNOW people will continue to criticize my writing and advice giving and <br/>
self-defense and humor, because somehow writing and communication seem to <br/>
some people to be things everyone can produce and understand equally well.  <br/>
<br/>
So it goes.<br/>
