<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559350764">Okay my son came up to me today and told me that he would really like <br/>
to have his bike back.  And I asked how i would know he would be more <br/>
responsible.  He replied that he thought showing the other kids in <br/>
the neighborhood that he was so brave he didn&#39;t stop at stop signs <br/>
would make them like him,  but instead they called him stupid and <br/>
laughed at him because he didn&#39;t have a bike so he guessed running <br/>
stop signs didn&#39;t make the kids like him.  So in the almost two days <br/>
since his bike was taken away  Bunky has gone from crying and telling <br/>
me how terrible I am to articulating why he did what he did  and why <br/>
it was wrong--and even if it was wrong because the older boy said it <br/>
was stupid  instead of because he could have been killed  atleast he <br/>
has told me he will stop at stop signs  in the future  so he now has <br/>
his bike back.   My sons greastest concerns in life is marrying Bill <br/>
Gates daughter so he never has to work  and impressing older kids.  <br/>
If he can&#39;t be the biggest, bravest, most impressive  loudest gas <br/>
passer  etc  he does anything that will gain him this status  and <br/>
anything that takes away from that status causes him great distress.  <br/>
He has his hair dyed different colors atlest once a year, changes his <br/>
name  anything to impress other kids.   The worst part is that other <br/>
kids don&#39;t like my son because my son always has to be the best or <br/>
bravest etc  or else he  (in the words of the boys he is always <br/>
trying to impress) &quot;acts like a baby&quot;      And I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
let my son know that.   Talking doesn&#39;t work because I am old and <br/>
don&#39;t know anything.  He does act like a perfect child infront of <br/>
people he doesn&#39;t know well.   His attitude is that of what many <br/>
people consider that of a teenager  and he has been like this since <br/>
he was 3 or 4.    My other son isn&#39;t like this  and another child <br/>
that lived with me for the first 3 years isn&#39;t like this.   But the <br/>
punishment of the taunting of the neighborhood boys (which i didn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy but i knew would probably work)  worked and I trust him to be <br/>
able to use his bike responsibly  so he has it back.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679186614">Congrats on one crisis weathered!  One of our kids was pretty<br/>
socially maladroit - though in different ways.  If you can find<br/>
some movies or books with characters struggling with the same<br/>
awkward behavior, they may let him try out different mechanisms -<br/>
or tricks of the trade - without having to &quot;check&quot; with you by<br/>
talking about it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; he does anything that will gain him this status  and <br/>
anything that takes away from that status causes him great distress.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Was he in school much?<br/>
<br/>
Kids who do that are needy of attention and positive regard and success.<br/>
If you can figure out what he&#39;s good at, give him opportunities to do that <br/>
more and brag him up and spend time with him it won&#39;t be as important to him <br/>
anymore what color his hair is.<br/>
<br/>
Our hair-dyingest friend who was always trying to do some dumbass thing to <br/>
get attention finally convinced his mom to let him homeschool.  He toned WAY <br/>
way down when he had the time and attention of his mom and of other <br/>
homeschooled kids who thought actually discussing real things was WAY better <br/>
than commenting on music videos and painting his nails purple.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But the punishment of the taunting of the neighborhood boys (which i didn&#39;t <br/>
enjoy but i knew would probably work)  worked &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then why aren&#39;t kids at school who are taunted and teased all the time the <br/>
best behaved people on the planet?  <br/>
<br/>
Taunting hurts badly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Bunky has gone from crying and telling <br/>
me how terrible I am to articulating why he did what he did  and why <br/>
it was wrong&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next time he will start at the articulation stage.  You could help that <br/>
happen.<br/>
