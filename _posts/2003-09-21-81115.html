<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635899305">Hey, all this talk about nursing and co-sleeping and general baby stuff makes <br/>
me want to ask your opinion about my situation.  You might remember my <br/>
constant complaining about breaking my ankle last year.  Actually, I pretty much <br/>
shattered it.  They had to use a plate with eight screws on the outside, three <br/>
pins on the inside and lots of fake bone plaster stuff to hold it all together.  <br/>
Because my feet are deformed a bit from being en pointe at too young an age, <br/>
the surgeon couldn&#39;t move my foot into a neutral position, even while I was <br/>
under anesthesia.  Therefore, my foot was pointed in the cast and I not have <br/>
very limited range of motion.<br/>
<br/>
OK, enough background.  I can walk and climb stairs, but going down stairs is <br/>
still difficult, I don&#39;t have the flexion.  I saw my surgeon in March and we <br/>
talked about having all the metal removed in October, so I&#39;ll be making an <br/>
appointment to see him in the next few weeks.  One of my midwives says any kind <br/>
of surgery, including general anesthesia, is ok in pregnancy.  The other <br/>
midwife says she thinks a local anesthesia would be ok.  The thing is, I&#39;ll probably <br/>
need to be on crutches to recover and would rather do that pregnant than with <br/>
an infant.  On the other hand, the thought of my wee one getting all those <br/>
drugs in utero is pretty frightening.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a window between one and two years after surgery that you can have <br/>
your metal removed, otherwise the bone is too well grown around it.  I&#39;d like to <br/>
get the metal out to help with my range of motion. Besides, it&#39;s <br/>
uncomfortable to have all the metal in there, particularly when it&#39;s humid and when you <br/>
can no longer sleep on your belly.<br/>
<br/>
Baby&#39;s due in January.  Anyone have any experience with surgery during <br/>
pregnancy?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Elizabeth<br/>

What about an epidural? Other than that, I don&#39;t know. I do know that more <br/>
and more doctors are performing surgery on pregnant women and on babies inutero. <br/>
I think this is definitely a tough decision!<br/>
<br/>
~Nancy~just my 2 cents. <br/>

As a nurse anesthetist with 20 years experience, I<br/>
would suggest a spinal anesthetic. Baby gets no meds<br/>
that way.If your concerned about post operative pain<br/>
you could have an continuous epidural and get local<br/>
anesthetic for 24 hours. That would mean being in the<br/>
hospital and in bed.<br/>
<br/>
I used that technique about a month ago for a pregnant<br/>
patient who shattered her ankle in a car accident.<br/>

Hi Elizabeth.  I lurk but have a story that&#39;s applicable. But first a <br/>
couple of questions:  do you have help after the birth--an adult 24-7 <br/>
or older child/ren who&#39;ll be able to carry the babe?  If so, I&#39;d <br/>
recommend foregoing the massive doses of drugs til after the birth, <br/>
when you can be sitting around recovering and others can bring the <br/>
babe to you when s/he&#39;s not in your arms already :~)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why I say this:  June 1994 I was 34 weeks pregnant with twins, <br/>
while mothering my other two kids who were 9 and 6 at the time.  Had <br/>
a car accident  (VERY long story) and ended up in labor, then <br/>
delivering (two perfectly healthy girls), with a broken right thumb <br/>
and a fractured right ankle.  Surgery on thumb, (local AND general <br/>
anesthesia) was two days after birth.  Pumped milk from moments after <br/>
birth til moments before local to allow bottle feeding by myself and <br/>
others for the two days that drugs were in my body.  Pumped and threw <br/>
away during those two days.  Then resumed breastfeeding. Hobbled <br/>
about on crutches (one specially made for persons with an injured <br/>
hand as well as foot) while children and hubby carted babies to and <br/>
fro in moses baskets when necessary.  <br/>
Also, in my experience, being on crutches is WAAAYYY more challenging <br/>
when you center of gravity is &quot;thrown off&quot; by that gorgeous belly.  <br/>
MUCH easier with only your own weight to throw around... :)<br/>
<br/>
If it were me in your situation, and I knew I would have the help I&#39;d <br/>
need, I would not allow a fetus to go through the trauma of <br/>
processing those drugs if it were not absolutely necessary.  Even if <br/>
you don&#39;t have a lot of help, I think it&#39;s worth the inconvenience of <br/>
sitting around alot with your babe afterwards to protect that tiny <br/>
being from an unnecessary trauma.  I guess you can tell I feel pretty <br/>
strongly about this... :~)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434323361">Just something to remember...<br/>
<br/>
Many mothers undergo surgery during pregnancy and immediately after, <br/>
have general or spinal or whatever, have major pain killers after birth, <br/>
and... breastfeed through it all.  It&#39;s called a c-section. <br/>
<br/>
If a drug is approved during use of a c-section and immediately after, <br/>
for baby and mom, then it should be fine when baby is a few weeks old, <br/>
or during pregnancy and especially when baby is months old. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had multiple surgeries during lacataion, all under general, using <br/>
pain killers, antibiotics, etc. as needed.  Almost ALL drugs are safe <br/>
for breastfeeding, it&#39;s just a matter of finding the right one.  There <br/>
is almost NEVER a need to pump and dump. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I thought about that.  I weigh less now than I did when I broke my <br/>
ankle, but I&#39;m unbelievable clumsy.  Probably should have waited to get pregnant <br/>
until I had the surgery, but that seemed like an eternity at age 39.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are 5 and 4 (already!) but my husband would take some time off work.  <br/>
There are lots of pre-teens around here who would be happy to come over after <br/>
school and help out, at least with my older kids.  I&#39;ll have to see what the <br/>
program for recovery is after the surgery.  I&#39;m just assuming there will be <br/>
some kind of cast while the bone grows back through the holes.<br/>
<br/>
i did have a c-section with my second (placenta preevia made that necessary) <br/>
and did nurse right away.  She was six weeks early and latched on right away <br/>
like a champ!  <br/>
<br/>
You guys are great, thanks for all your help!<br/>

for the use of these drugs, and the studies and anecdotal evidence <br/>
would appear to back them up I&#39;m sure.  But I&#39;m not so sure MY level <br/>
of safety and theirs would match up that well! :)  <br/>
At the time I had no research telling me whether any  of it was <br/>
harmful or not, just the md&#39;s word --- tho my instinct (and my <br/>
lifestyle at the time) was to keep &quot;unnatural&quot; substances out of my <br/>
babies&#39; bodies, as well as my own.  Also at the time my babes were <br/>
preemies, so might as well have still been in utero.  Quick decisions <br/>
had to be made in my situation, so I decide to &quot;err&quot; on the side of <br/>
protection.  It was a little inconvenient but not anywhere near <br/>
unbearable, especially since I had to pump anyway if I wanted my <br/>
babes to have breastmilk cuz my breasts were so swollen from hitting <br/>
the steering wheel they couldn&#39;t latch on.  <br/>
I do find it a little inconsistent to spend huge amounts of energy on <br/>
the problems of a medically-&quot;approved&quot; substance like formula, then <br/>
turn around and defend the &quot;approval&quot; by the same community of drugs <br/>
which will pass to your babe whether in utero or through lactation.<br/>
Seems to me the *necessity* of using these various substances has to <br/>
be measured and valued very carefully in any given situation.  <br/>

needs of the mother to have the drug vs the risks to the baby, and to <br/>
the mother. <br/>
<br/>
There is a great book out there that has looked at most of the drugs <br/>
available, look <br/>

Any good doctor will have a reference book that references drugs as <br/>
categories.  Category A drugs are perfectly safe.  There are few of <br/>
these because few drug companies want to claim that even a drug like <br/>
advil is perfectly safe for babies and pregnant moms and lactating moms. <br/>
Category B moms are considered fine, and most are prescribed to infants <br/>
without a second thought.  Personally if a drug is prescribed to an <br/>
infant then it&#39;s OK for a lactating mother or pregnant mother.  Catagory <br/>
C drugs are more dangerous and if possible it is better to find an <br/>
alternative in the B category.  Category D drugs are to be avoided.  <br/>
Generally if a drug has been approved for pregnancy it is safe during <br/>
lactation.  Of course, not all docs know all this information so Hales <br/>
is a good book to have around, and most good LLL Leaders have a copy or <br/>
know someone who does, so they can look up and see what&#39;s the REAL scoop <br/>
with a drug, so the mother can make an INFORMED choice.  Another good <br/>
book that has common drugs and their effect upon breastfeeding is the <br/>
Breastfeeding Answer Book which most LLL Leaders will have. <br/>
<br/>
I have spoken to many moms who pumped and dumped while they took a drug <br/>
that was perfectly safe for their child to have while breastfeeding.  <br/>
The baby had bottles of artificial milk, which was and is, in the long <br/>
term, far worse than a little breastmilk with a small amount of whatever <br/>
drug in it.  This has been done for every drug under the sun, including <br/>
antibiotics, antidepressants, and other drugs that have been proven to <br/>
be perfectly fine during lactation.  Sometimes the result of giving <br/>
bottles is that the baby refuses to go back to the breast so mom <br/>
eventually stops pumping, and baby is now a formula consumer!  Hey hey, <br/>
more money for the formula company! <br/>
<br/>
Furthermore not all drugs pass through to the milk.  Some drugs pass <br/>
through in such minimal amounts as to be barely detectable.  At any <br/>
rate, depending upon a baby&#39;s age and breastfeeding patterns, moms can <br/>
often breastfeed around the dosage time to prevent drugs from getting to <br/>
baby. <br/>

&gt; Seems to me the *necessity* of using these various substances has to<br/>
&gt; be measured and valued very carefully in any given situation.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh most definitely, but I have heard of way too many women NOT <br/>
breastfeed (my doctor said I couldn&#39;t use my asthma inhaler if I was <br/>
breastfeeding, my doctor said my high blood pressure meds weren&#39;t <br/>
compatible with breastfeeding or whatever, when most of the time what <br/>
the doctor said is simply not true and there is almost always a way to <br/>
get the meds needed and still breastfeed) because of a fear of using a <br/>
particular drug. <br/>
<br/>
Personally I&#39;d rather a child have a week of something rather not good <br/>
for it and then go on to have years of further breastfeeding then mom to <br/>
wean and the baby to get artificial baby milk.  Also as someone who <br/>
pumped, breastmilk is liquid gold and the idea of dumping something <br/>
unnecessarily is horrid. <br/>

&gt; I think it&#39;s worth the inconvenience of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting around alot with your babe afterwards to protect that tiny<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; being from an unnecessary trauma.  I guess you can tell I feel<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; strongly about this... :~)<br/>
