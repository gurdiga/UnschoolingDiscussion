<div id="ygrps-yiv-58849096">I&#39;ve received a bunch of notes from people about the status of Live and  <br/>
Learn conference recordings, and I wanted to update you.<br/>
 <br/>
We will get to the recrodings as soon as we can. Our family has gone  through <br/>
quite a bit of trauma and upheavel in the weeks right before and after  the <br/>
conference. Right before the conference, two close friends of our  family died, <br/>
one very suddenly and very young.  (Todd was the organist and  music director <br/>
at the church I worked at for seven years. He played organ for  and attended <br/>
our wedding in June.)<br/>
 <br/>
After the conference I needed to go directly into work mode, as my work  year <br/>
began the beginning of September, and I had mostly neglected prep because  of <br/>
the conference. (I work for a Unitarian Universalist church as Director of  <br/>
Religious Education.)  I had made a bit of money with the  conference, which <br/>
turned out to be good because Beth&#39;s organization had to make  budget cuts, and <br/>
everyone in the organization will be going on four day work  weeks with 20% <br/>
salary reductions October through December.<br/>
 <br/>
Right after the conference another very close friend, Daniel, who had just  <br/>
done one of the readings at our wedding, was admitted to the hospital with his  <br/>
kidneys beginning to fail. He seemed to be getting better, but they were <br/>
still  trying to figure out what was going on with him. A couple of weeks ago he  <br/>
entered a coma. The day after that our 17 year old cat, Charlotte, was  <br/>
diagnosed with terminal cancer.<br/>
 <br/>
Saturday Charlotte died. Sunday, yet another friend (who&#39;d thrown our  <br/>
wedding shower) was having heart pains and was admitted to the hospital. <br/>
 <br/>
Today our friend Daniel died.<br/>
 <br/>
Beth, Julian, and I are so raw right now. We wander around in a kind of  <br/>
daze, periodically just crying and falling into each other&#39;s arms. There is so  <br/>
much death and sickness, and so much is so close to us.  We&#39;re planning a  <br/>
vacation in a few weeks because we just need something good to look forward to.  <br/>
(We&#39;re actually a little glad about Beth&#39;s furlough right now, because, despite  <br/>
the money issue, we just need her with us.)<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s us. With any luck at all things will be getting better very  <br/>
soon, and we&#39;ll be able to get things handled. In the meantime, please be  <br/>
patient, and send us (and our family and friends) good energy and hugs.<br/>
 <br/>
Love, Kathryn<br/>
