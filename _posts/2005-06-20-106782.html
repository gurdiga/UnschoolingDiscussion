<div id="ygrps-yiv-30560618">My oldest son, Noah, (18) is interested in taking New Testament Greek<br/>
with me in the fall. The course is both undergrad and graduate credit.<br/>
The professor is my favorite one and he gave me permission to have<br/>
Noah sit in (even without credit or paying tuition) if he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
However, both Noah and I came to realize that if he&#39;s doing the work,<br/>
having the credit might come in handy some day. So I started down the<br/>
path of special student status and hit a brick wall in the first phone<br/>
call. Normally I quit at that point. The admissions lady just kept<br/>
telling me he had to jump through all the admissions hoops even if he<br/>
isn&#39;t a degree seeking student.<br/>
<br/>
But this time, I decided to keep calling other departments. Long story<br/>
short:<br/>
<br/>
The CAPS program (degree completion and weekend degree students over<br/>
22) made an exception for Noah and will enroll him even though he&#39;s<br/>
not old enough. They will even allow us to use Jon&#39;s adjunct teaching<br/>
for tuition remission and Noah will get credit even though he won&#39;t be<br/>
in the degree seeking program.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that cool? The dean was so nice to me and enthusiastic for Noah.<br/>
Quote: &quot;He&#39;s clearly an exception and this class sounds ideal for<br/>
him.&quot; Noah was over the moon. He&#39;s totally stoked to learn a dead<br/>
language. :) I liked that going past the initial phone call yielded<br/>
such an enthusiatic exception!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d throw out that info in case someone might wonder how<br/>
to do the special student status in college.<br/>
