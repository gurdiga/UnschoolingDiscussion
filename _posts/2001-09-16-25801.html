<div id="ygrps-yiv-793800133"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m struggling right now with fine-tuning my philosophy of <br/>
&gt;education.  It would be tremendously helpful if anyone is willing to <br/>
&gt;share why they believe unschooling is the best way to go.  Why not <br/>
&gt;the Charlotte Mason approach?  Or the Moore Formula?  Why do you <br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;believe what you believe?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I personally believe this:  Nobody&#39;s &#39;approach&#39;  is right for my family<br/>
except ours.  We run pretty much as a democracy with a few exceptions. <br/>
This description is all general and subject to fluidity on any given day.<br/>
 My personal input into the family is as organizer.  I keep us all on<br/>
track and moving.  The kids each have different jobs.  Rachel is in<br/>
charge of outside stuff for the most part although some of the gardens<br/>
are mine.  Jenni is in charge of books (becasue she has read them all)<br/>
and a lot of inside stuff.  Wyndham is in charge of making Wyndham grow<br/>
up.  When the girls were his age they went through similar albeit less<br/>
troublesome phases.  We have a job list and some basic guidelines for<br/>
getting the housework done fairly.  But none of that has anything to do<br/>
with &#39;education&#39;.  As for learning and schoolwork, our lifestyle is a<br/>
little less easy to explain.  I do require that my girls be doing<br/>
something.  I have some basic suggestions loosely attached to the<br/>
jobslist but they can and often do fly out the window.  Rachel has a<br/>
violin she is learning to play and if she is doing that, I&#39;m happy with<br/>
it.  If she were vegging out and not doing ANYTHING for a prolonged<br/>
period of time, I would worry and check into her allergy and depression<br/>
levels.  So the list and the requirement for &#39;something&#39; is more a<br/>
medical watch thing than it is about school work.  <br/>
But then the dynamics here are a bit odd too.  Rachel and Wyndham (oldest<br/>
and youngest) have most of the medical problems and are most physically<br/>
active.  The middle one, Jenni, often ends up holding things together and<br/>
helping me the most but for anyone looking in from the outside it appears<br/>
she is not doing much.  <br/>
The so called basic school stuff, math, history, english, etc. are so<br/>
meshed into our lives that I can&#39;t even say this is what we do to teach<br/>
that.  I just know that my uncle was astounded at Rachel&#39;s knowledge of<br/>
history and politics a week or so ago.  I didn&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; her that.  She<br/>
just &#39;is&#39; that.<br/>
<br/>
So my best advice is to figure out what works for you.  Don&#39;t try to<br/>
assign names to it (because someone somewhere will try to tell you that<br/>
that isn&#39;t what you are doing) and just do it and don&#39;t look back.<br/>
