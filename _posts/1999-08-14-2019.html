<br/>
RE: You wrote:<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of information out there about &quot;whole -to - part&quot;  learners.<br/>
And most schools teach in a &quot;part-to-whole&quot; schema.....I&#39;ve heard that whole<br/>
to part learners are more rare in adults,   wonder if it gets drilled out<br/>
during school years?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, there was a lot of info when my older son was in public school - They<br/>
called it &quot;Learning Disability&quot;  I was thinking &quot;How can seeing the &quot;BIG<br/>
Picture&quot; be a bad thing?  Don&#39;t we want leaders who see the big picture?<br/>
Don&#39;t sucessful adults see the big picture?&quot;  But we can&#39;t look at the big<br/>
picture in 1st grade because we have to concentrate on the letter &quot;A&quot; today!<br/>
All 3 of my kids are &quot;whole-to-part-ers&quot;,  although they did do a pretty<br/>
good job of drilling it out of my daughter.  Labeled her LD too.  How can a<br/>
perfectly happy, wonderful, enthusiastic Kindergartener become LD by 1st<br/>
grade?  The answer was &quot;1st grade is different from kindergarten&quot;<br/>
 Well, HOMEschool is different from PUBLIC school, Thank you, God!<br/>

RE: Susan asked &quot;Where are you in OH?&quot;<br/>
We are in Whitehall, a suburb of Columbus.  Actually, Columbus surrounds us<br/>
as it grew around some of the suburbs.<br/>

RE: Lyn Turner said:<br/>
&quot;I feel like someone has to stand up for beautiful handwriting, so .... here<br/>
I go:-) I remember being forced to take classes to improve my handwriting<br/>
when I was around 13 years old. Don&#39;t remember my writing being that bad,<br/>
don&#39;t remember the classes, but I am forever grateful for them!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not convinced that everyone can &quot;learn&quot; beautiful handwriting.  Perhaps<br/>
that is a talent or a &quot;gift&quot; that someone chose to nurture in you through<br/>
classes.  Just like some people are better suited to play the flute and<br/>
others the tuba - It&#39;s not to say one couldn&#39;t &quot;learn&quot; to play the flute,<br/>
but if the structure of your mouth is suited for the tuba, then that flute<br/>
will never sing like it might for someone else.  Since handwriting depends<br/>
on fine motor skills, we will always fall somewhere along a line from<br/>
beautiful to awful! with a lot of average in between.<br/>

RE: Melissa said:<br/>
&quot;I will say this, though, it drives me crazy to read things<br/>
from people who can&#39;t spell very well (postings on this list excluded, of<br/>
course &lt;g&gt;). I am a big proponent of learning to spell, not necessarily of<br/>
learning cursive. My dad (in his late 50&#39;s now and one of the most<br/>
intelligent guys I know) spells phonetically. No kidding. He is the<br/>
president  of a large corporation and writes/speaks fluently but stinks at<br/>
spelling.  Hmmm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Good spelling is also a talent not all of us have!  My dd became very<br/>
dependant on her Spelling Ace because she knew people would think she was<br/>
stupid because she can&#39;t spell worth a hoot!  and her phonics stink too -<br/>
which makes it even worse!  She had 9 years of public school and just<br/>
couldn&#39;t get it.  There again, it&#39;s a &quot;Learning Disability&quot;, but I&#39;d much<br/>
rather she develop her other talents than get bogged down by what she can&#39;t<br/>
do. (If it hasn&#39;t improved in 9 years - get over it!)<br/>
<br/>
MY CONFESSION:  I must admit, my &quot;thing&quot; is bad grammer!  I cringe everytime<br/>
I hear someone say &quot;We was there&quot; or &quot;Him and me had fun&quot;  Maybe some people<br/>
can&#39;t &quot;get&quot; that either, I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ve pounded it (gently, of<br/>
course) into my kids so much that hearing it makes them crazy too, and they<br/>
say it&#39;s hard for them to not correct other people.  My older ones sure<br/>
didn&#39;t learn it in school, and it appears alot of others aren&#39;t either!<br/>
<br/>
Off my soapbox for today!<br/>

I agree....and it&#39;s rubbed off on my dd too.  Funny story:  One of the <br/>
mothers on the rhythmic gymnastics team uses terrible language....her dd goes <br/>
to a magnet school and gets all As.....you guess it, the daughter sounds just <br/>
like the Mom.  When hs/us is mentioned, she says things like, &quot;No way...my <br/>
daughter aint gonna be homeschooled...she needs her education!&quot;  LOL!<br/>
