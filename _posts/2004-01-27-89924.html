<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100814090">Wow!  I checked out the one step ahead &quot;rainy day combo&quot; and the IKEA sets.  <br/>
What a great idea!  When my son was a baby, we had a toddler swing handing <br/>
from beams in the basement.  Then we finished the basement into a playroom and <br/>
don&#39;t have the beams anymore, they are above the drop ceiling!<br/>
But the swing in the doorway looks great!  I&#39;m wondering... for those of you <br/>
who have them... the one step ahead swing doesn&#39;t actually screw into the <br/>
doorway, so how is it sturdy enough to stay up holding a larger child (weight <br/>
rated to 100lbs)?  I don&#39;t want it to come down on my son&#39;s head while swinging.  <br/>
Also, I&#39;m not sure our door frame overhead would be sturdy enough to hang <br/>
hooks into for holding the weight of a swing (the IKEA model hangs from hooks).<br/>
Gee, we have a small slide inside.  When we get that trampoline (which I&#39;ve <br/>
been hoping to find at a garage sale in the summer, but want now)....we&#39;ll be a <br/>
big indoor playground.  Now, just need a big refrigerator box to make some <br/>
tunnels/forts!<br/>
