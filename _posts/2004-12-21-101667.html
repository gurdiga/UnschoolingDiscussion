<div id="ygrps-yiv-604146323">I found this article very profound in an unschooling way.  Apparently <br/>
there&#39;s a movement among autistic adults to just accept them and <br/>
their unique gifts rather than trying to change them.  <br/>

I found it especially interesting since I saw a story a few years <br/>
back about an autistic vet who has developed several helpful devices <br/>
because she is so in tune with the way the animals perceive things.  <br/>
The fact that she is a vet was astounding to me because autism is <br/>
always portrayed with very low functioning people who wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
capable of succeeding in any school let alone a highly competitive <br/>
vet school.<br/>
