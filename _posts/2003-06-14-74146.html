<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We got a house!  I&#39;m SO happy and excited!!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Congrats, Jennifer!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And nervous...we have 10 days to move and I haven&#39;t packed a thing, save<br/>
&gt; three boxes of books.  AAAAHHH!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can do it!  One box at a time.  Books are a great place to start, you<br/>
won&#39;t have time to read for the next few weeks anyway!  Recruit your kids to<br/>
pack unbreakables.  They may not be packed the way you&#39;d do it, but they&#39;ll<br/>
be packed!  My son also loved taping boxes together.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Add that to the fact that I&#39;m packing and moving alone...my husband<br/>
&gt; conveniently doesn&#39;t get home until the day AFTER we have to be out of this<br/>
&gt; house...and I&#39;m a nervous wreck!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, yuck.  I still know you can do it.  I did our last move alone, and it<br/>
sucked, but it&#39;s done!  Hang in there!<br/>
