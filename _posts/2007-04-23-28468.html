<div id="ygrps-yiv-858180288">When my husband passed away last year, I knew school was the last thing my children needed.  It would have been so hard on them to loose a parent and then have to face a totally different kind of learning world they were unfamiliar and didn&#39;t want to do.  I feel you should talk to your husband and sister-in-law and let them know what your wishes are as far as unschooling.  In the event something happened to you, maybe they would respect them, maybe the wouldn&#39;t, but at least you would know right now that you told them how you feel and maybe it would make you feel a little better, here in the present, about your unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing that you have a very unrealistic picture in your head of  <br/>
what schooled first graders can do. Are you confusing what schools  <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; with what kids &quot;learn?&quot; Probably more than half of first  <br/>
graders don&#39;t read yet - or can sound out words but not comprehend  <br/>
what they are reading. Most use extremely inventive spelling, even  <br/>
for three-letter words. Here is something I saw in a 1st grade  <br/>
classroom - in the front of the room was a big poster board and the  <br/>
teacher had written a lot of words on it - the words were: &quot;the&quot; &quot;I&quot;  <br/>
&quot;me&quot; &quot;it&quot; &quot;was&quot; &quot;to&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;an&quot; &quot;and&quot; and so on. A lot of small  <br/>
words. This poster was clearly kept in the front of the room all the  <br/>
time. The children were writing an invitation to their parents to  <br/>
come to open house at the school. When they wanted to know how to  <br/>
write a word, they asked which word it was on the poster in front of  <br/>
the room and they copied it. If the word wasn&#39;t on the poster  <br/>
already, the teacher wrote it on another one. The kids asked how to  <br/>
write: &quot;dear&quot; &quot;mommy&quot; &quot;daddy&quot; &quot;please&quot; &quot;come&quot; &quot;open&quot; &quot;house&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;from.&quot; The teacher suggested that, instead of writing &quot;from,&quot; the  <br/>
kids should write either, &quot;Yours truly,&quot; or &quot;Sincerely.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So - somebody reading the invitations might think all those kids  <br/>
could read and write, but few of them could have done it on their  <br/>
own. They made up what they wanted to say, but copied each word.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I think you think that the school kids can do way more than  <br/>
they really can do and that your kids would be made to feel stupid or  <br/>
be miserable due to being so behind. I doubt that is true. From years  <br/>
of seeing what happened when unschooled kids did, for some reason,  <br/>
have to go to school, they were able to catch up on things like not  <br/>
knowing multiplication tables, etc. I mean, any kid can be unlucky  <br/>
and get a mean-spirited teacher who makes the child miserable and  <br/>
might focus on the things the child doesn&#39;t yet know - but that is a  <br/>
hazard of schooling, not a result of having been unschooled - I mean  <br/>
- it happens to schooled kids, too, when they get a new teacher. In  <br/>
your kids&#39; cases, most kind-hearted teachers would be making huge  <br/>
allowances for them anyway, given the circumstances of them entering  <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;d feel better if you talked to your sil and told her your  <br/>
concerns and asked that, should the need arise, she be really sure  <br/>
that your kids are with really kind and gentle teachers and that she  <br/>
talk to them about making allowances for the fact that they were on a  <br/>
really different educational plan that believed in delaying  <br/>
academics. That&#39;s not an unknown position among educators - they  <br/>
often have heard of and somewhat understand the concept, even if they  <br/>
aren&#39;t allowed to practice it. Maybe you could even leave a document  <br/>
that you&#39;ve written, explaining what the kids&#39; education has been  <br/>
like, to be given to possible teachers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018200318">Hon, you can worry yourself to death wondering about things like that. Your kids are not &quot;behind&quot;. All children&#39;s brains develop differently. That&#39;s the great thing about homeschooling. Your kids will &quot;get it&quot; when they are ready. I know it&#39;s scary sometimes, all of us have insecurities sometimes.  But if you have love, hugs, daily &quot;I love you&#39;s&quot;, EVERYTHING will fall into place!  Someone is always going to look at you, and want to give their judgement. Remember, YOU are your own worst saboteur. So don&#39;t worry, everything will be allright. My son is almost 8, and he can&#39;t read either, so what? He&#39;s the most loving, intelligent, and honest person I&#39;ve ever known in my life! (by the way, his sister who&#39;s 10, learned to read at 5 yrs. go figure :0)) P.S have you read any of the Moore&#39;s books. I like the information they give about the way our brains take in information. They make alot of sense to me. They advocate not even letting your children read to at least 8 years old.(<br/>
 for boys they say up to 11) and these people were teachers. Also, read Holt, he&#39;s awesome!  good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We originally had designated as godparents some cousins of dh&#39;s who are <br/>
lovely people, who have raised lovely now-adult kids and are fun and <br/>
pleasant - and absolutely committed to the school system. The mom is a <br/>
special ed teacher. Dh&#39;s sister also offered herself, and she too is a <br/>
lovely person but certainly doesn&#39;t get home schooling or unschooling. Her <br/>
son was in Sylvan for a while, then a very heavy college prep school, and <br/>
she would probably represent the nicest and best of conventional parenting, <br/>
if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
We have changed our minds and have now designated an Unschooling family - <br/>
the tribe we have chosen and the family of our heart rather than our dna - <br/>
to be the loving support for Jayn should the unthinkable happen to both <br/>
James and I. The Lovejoys for the curious :)<br/>
<br/>
I once asked my husband if he would still Unschool if something happened to <br/>
me. He looked at me like I was nuts and said something like, &quot;Of course - <br/>
how can you even ask?&quot; You can have no idea how freeing that statement was, <br/>
how grateful I continue to be to him. I know he would find a way, and that <br/>
sending my dd away from him at what would be the time of  worst grief and <br/>
greatest need would never occur to him. Perhaps your dh could come to see it <br/>
that way - that your kids would need him and his presence even more should <br/>
you be taken from them.<br/>

<br/>
I used to worry about those things quite a bit, too.  The person who  <br/>
had been designated as possible guardian never did get to the point  <br/>
that he understood unschooling and his own children (which he didn&#39;t  <br/>
have at the time) are in Catholic school.  But at some point we  <br/>
discussed it and he would have helped the kids financially (meaning  <br/>
figured out the social security and insurance and been financial  <br/>
guardian, to make sure the bills got paid and they had health  <br/>
insurance and all) and gotten another of our friends to live in the  <br/>
house with them.   That would&#39;ve worked.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, two of ours are past school age and the youngest is  <br/>
fifteen, so I don&#39;t worry at all anymore.   What a relief to have  <br/>
lived this long!  (Seriously.)<br/>

decision for how much term life insurance we needed on *me*. If I die,<br/>
I want him to be able to quit his job and live off the interest after<br/>
investing the insurance money, thus we got as much insurance on me (a<br/>
non-money earning SAHM) as we got on him. That way there will be no<br/>
need for tooth and nail fighting (at least financially) for him to do<br/>
what is best for our kids.<br/>

Here&#39;s to living so long, none of us have to worry about guardians for<br/>
our kids.<br/>

Unless there were BIG bucks involved, I don&#39;t see how one could  <br/>
require much of anything of those who might care for their children  <br/>
after their deaths.  Even if I could leave enough money that someone  <br/>
would never have to work again, they might not want to stay with my  <br/>

be very upfront with the person(s) they choose to be guardians of <br/>
their children, and the potential guardian should be upfront and <br/>
honest about what they are willing to do. Of course, situations <br/>
change but on &quot;big issues&quot; (religion,education, discipline styles), <br/>
i would hope that a parent and guardian would be somewhat in <br/>
agreement about what to do with the kids. Its not like you would be <br/>
a guardian against your will, you&#39;d have to agree to it. They can&#39;t <br/>
force you to take their kids. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats just not true. <br/>
<br/>
If i died, and my son&#39;s father didnt fight my family on it, my son <br/>
would stay here in MI and be raised by my family, probably my sister <br/>
(with other family members helping out)...i have no doubt that she <br/>
would continue to unschool him. We have actually talked about it. Will <br/>
she unschool him in the exact same way that i do? No, probably not <br/>
(just as in 2 parent families, one parent may relate to the child and <br/>
therefore unschool the child in a different way than the other <br/>
parent)...but he will still have the same basic unschooling experience <br/>
(his schedule likely wouldnt change---staying up late, sleeping in---<br/>
his ability to eat what he wants/sleep when he wants/play as much <br/>
videogames or computer that he wants wouldnt change---the respect he <br/>
feels from the adults around him wouldnt change.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really confused as to why you don&#39;t think one can expect that a <br/>
person who shares similar ideals wouldnt raise your child as you <br/>
would? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I couldn&#39;t leave a baby to a friend and say &quot;You have to nurse him<br/>
until he quits on his own, and let him sleep with you.&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, but you could choose a friend who would never think of doing <br/>
anything BUT those things. And you could tell your friend how <br/>
important it was to you. When my son was a baby, i knew that if i <br/>
died, whether he ended up with my family or with his father, that <br/>
person would co-sleep with him. Of course there are issues with <br/>
breastfeeding, but i&#39;m pretty sure if i had a lactating mom to leave <br/>
him to, they wouldve nursed him. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think unschooling is &quot;beyond&quot; things like religion or <br/>
discipline styles? Its almost as if you are saying its nearly <br/>
unattainable to expect any guardian to unschool, so don&#39;t get your <br/>
hopes up. Yet i know, if my son were able to stay w/ my family if i <br/>
died, his daily life would be relatively unchanged. They treat him as <br/>
i treat him. Unfortunately not everyone has a similar relationship w/ <br/>
their family,but in that event they can try to seek out non-related <br/>
people who share their ideals. <br/>

Yes they can try, but they&#39;re unlikely to succeed so they shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
get their hopes up.<br/>
<br/>
There is no guarantee whatsoever, even if someone agrees to it in  <br/>
advance, that they&#39;ll be able to pull it off.  And a child whose  <br/>
parents have died might rather go to school than stay with a person  <br/>
the parents chose years before.  The guardians will simply not be the  <br/>
parents.  And the hinge on which unschooling hangs is the child&#39;s  <br/>
choice and freedom.  If the child feel stuck with someone who doesn&#39;t  <br/>
really understand and who is resentful (even a little) of the full- <br/>
time, 24-hour-a-day-all-year demands of unschooling, he could not  <br/>
possibly be as comfortable in that situation as he was with his parents.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t get to replace ourselves when we die.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s an implication, here, that the parent-child relationship is <br/>
only a small factor in &quot;the basic unschooling experience&quot; whereas I <br/>
see it as the core of unschooling itself. <br/>
<br/>
That relationship is built, for many unschoolers, during the <br/>
parent&#39;s deschooling period. Either parents and kids deschool <br/>
together and grow into unschooling together, or parents work hard at <br/>
deschooling while the child is very young, and the family <br/>
is &quot;unschool-ready&quot; (as it were) by mandatory school age. That&#39;s not <br/>
going to be the case with an adoptive family.<br/>
<br/>
The closest you&#39;ll come is with a family that is already <br/>
unschooling - and in that case your berieved children are going to <br/>
have to deal with a really different kind of family structure, one <br/>
with more siblings in it. That&#39;s going to change the &quot;basic <br/>
unschooling experience&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of a childless couple agreeing to unschool your kids, <br/>
there&#39;s a Big Gap between understanding unschooling in theory and <br/>
actually living it day in and day out. The new parents are going to <br/>
need time to deschool - a time complicated by the grieving process. <br/>
That&#39;s going to have a big effect on the relationship *and* the <br/>
feeling of respect between the adults and the kids and there is no <br/>
way of predicting the outcome of that process.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How many families homeschool, much less unschool? Its certainly <br/>
statistically unlikely, even with a screening process. How many <br/>
families do you know irl who tried homeschooling or unschooling and <br/>
changed their minds? I know several. Its that gap between the idea <br/>
and the reality. <br/>
<br/>
If trusting that your children will have the &quot;same basic unschooling <br/>

trust with both hands. Personally, I&#39;m going to go on trusting that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess i just don&#39;t get it. *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
I thought we were talking about choosing an appropriate guardian for <br/>
ones child, in the event of one&#39;s death. Not a lovely subject to be <br/>
sure, and certainly the child&#39;s life will be turned upside down <br/>
regardless. But it seems the argument is that it doesnt matter who the <br/>
kid&#39;s guardian is---heck, put down your mailman&#39;s name!---because the <br/>
child won&#39;t get to unschool anyway. <br/>
<br/>
My point is that it IS possible to choose a guardian for your child <br/>
that holds similar beliefs. I am not &quot;clinging&quot; to any trust. I don&#39;t <br/>
even have a will. My son&#39;s father could likely get my son if i died, <br/>
and his life would take a dramatic turn for the worse (but he&#39;s a <br/>
flexible kid so i think he&#39;d be ok), thats a bummer for me (well, my <br/>
son ultimately) but the price i pay for being a single parent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting that someone write a will saying that whoever <br/>
raises their kid must do XYZ under penalty of....well, of what? I <br/>
doubt there could be a penalty. All i&#39;m saying is that its possible <br/>
for a child to go on unschooling even if the parent doing the <br/>
unschooling now is no longer around. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see why you are using such harsh extreme language. No one <br/>
can replace a child&#39;s birth parents. Even if a child is adopted at <br/>
birth, the adoptive parents arent a *replacement*...but they are a <br/>
substitute for the child&#39;s parents who arent around. Finding someone <br/>
(in your family, or extended network of friends as some here have <br/>
done)that is in general alignment with your childraising beliefs may <br/>
be hard for some people, but i would think it would be worth it if <br/>
it was very important to them that their child continue to unschool. <br/>
Personally, its more important to me that my child stay with family <br/>
who have known him since birth and who love him, regardless of <br/>
whether he would end up in school or not. But i really like and <br/>
trust my family. Not everyone is so lucky. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, there is no guarantee that the child&#39;s own parents will be able <br/>
to &quot;pull off&quot; unschooling, or continue it for years. We can&#39;t <br/>
predict the future, only do our best to take steps to steer toward <br/>
certain outcomes. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And a child whose parents have died might rather go to school than <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is why its a good idea to review who you&#39;ve chosen for a <br/>
guardian every few years, as situations change. There are people i <br/>
might have chosen when my son was an infant that i don&#39;t even talk <br/>
to now. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The guardians will simply not be the parents. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, no kidding. But they will be legal guardians, probably with <br/>
all the rights and responsibilities of the parents. And if the child <br/>
is young, or the child chooses, they possibly could adopt the child. <br/>
Then they &quot;simply&quot; WOULD be the parents. <br/>
<br/>
My son has so many people in his life who help us unschool. My <br/>
brothers and my sisters, especially. But they arent me. There are <br/>
such things as second and third best, &quot;almost as good&quot; and &quot;not even <br/>
on the list of possible good choices.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If the child feel stuck with someone who doesn&#39;t  <br/>

&gt;parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uhhh...maybe we are talking about two different things. I see you <br/>
envisioning a case where a friend or relative is suprised with the <br/>
gift of three unschooled kids, and a letter threatening harm from <br/>
the grave if that person doesnt unschool exactly as the parent <br/>
intended, complete with dissecting dead birds found in the yard, <br/>
midnight marathons of World of Warcraft, and a big family bed. <br/>
<br/>
Thats not what i&#39;m talking about. I&#39;m suggesting that rather than <br/>
throwing up one&#39;s hands and saying &quot;Oh well, i guess crazy Aunt <br/>
Irene gets our kids, because she is our closest kin&quot;, one should <br/>
explore who in their family or circle of friends has similar <br/>
philosophies about childraising. No, you can&#39;t guarantee that they <br/>
won&#39;t change their mind. Or that they will even be around if you <br/>
die. But its sure worth putting a little thought into. <br/>

absolutely committed to this parenting path.  Will it look the same as it<br/>
did before?? Heck no! Not even in a super cool family, it&#39;s still not mommy<br/>
(or daddy or mommy & daddy).  Is it better than the alternatives?<br/>
Absolutely!! Can he roll with it? Without a doubt, our lives have provided<br/>
the practice already!!<br/>
I don&#39;t waste a minute of my life in this fear, however!  Life is way too<br/>
short.  If you&#39;ve got angst about who you&#39;re leaving your kids to, find<br/>
someone more appropriate and get on with Living :)<br/>

&gt;   I have nine, but only seven are still at home. That question haunts<br/>
&gt; me a bit. Well a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who would have my philosophies etc?... NO ONE.. Who would love them<br/>
&gt; like I do?.... No One... I am not saying someone else would not<br/>
&gt; somedays parent better than I do. But I am their parent. They own my<br/>
&gt; heart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think my children would go to my older children, who are in the<br/>
&gt; mid 20&#39;s. They love them and parent their own children similar to my<br/>
&gt; parenting.. BETTER than I did when they were young, I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have several times had potential candidates, but naw...I ended up<br/>
&gt; taking them off the candidate list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had often thought about choosing another unschooling family, but I<br/>
&gt; still do not know what would happen to my kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The thoughts of someone taking this lovely life they have and<br/>
&gt; making them go to ps, tow the line, limit them and control the<br/>
&gt; content of their lives makes me realize I must live on...<br/>

You are right I am living in fear over this subject. Well it alters <br/>
between fear and denial.. hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
I will see what I can actively do to make a good choice and move on.<br/>
