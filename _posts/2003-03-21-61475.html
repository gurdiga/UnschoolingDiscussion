By dumping Sonlight and living an interesting life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;About the only things she had <br/>
<br/>
any sort of sustained interest in has been butterflies and wanting to <br/>
<br/>
play the guitar (which we intend to begin if we can ever find <br/>
<br/>
affordable lessons for her). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
IF?<br/>
If you ever do?<br/>
Get a guitar, learn to tune it, get a chord book and YOU learn enough to help <br/>
her learn.  She can play around with a guitar a LOT without lessons.<br/>
<br/>
And an interest doesn&#39;t have to be sustained to lead to learning.  It can be <br/>
a momentary flash.  A sudden and fleeting interest in cement mixers.  Take <br/>
her to see one.  If she never cares again, she knows way more than she did <br/>
before she saw how they get it in and out of there, how thick it is, what <br/>
tools they use to level it, how they clean up the slag.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How can I help her to find interests? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You find interests.  And do it right in front of her, with her there, so she <br/>
can see how people find interests.<br/>

This bush is not expensive, I found ours in the Spring Hill Nursery Catalog.<br/>
My son who is 11 has friends with interest in guitar, I felt at first this may be a &quot;thing&quot; because everyone else was doing it. We purchased a guitar, with beginner books. Well low and behold he has taught himself how to play. He has a tuner and has learned to tune it himself. If he continues along this path, there are some teens in our support group for homeschool that would love to show off their skills and teach a youngster to play. Are you a member of a support group in your area? There may be adults too that would love to show your daughter how to play if she is not self motivated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593593244">Elizabeth - relax for a minute in your child.  With 4 in your<br/>

Butterflies and guitar can encompass the world.  From<br/>
metamorphosis to the mathematics of pitch, you have a winner.<br/>
<br/>
At a practical level. with littles around, try yourself to think<br/>
about butterflies and guitar in the background.  Gardens are<br/>
good, but even in an apartment you can order a chrysalis - or<br/>

<br/>
... same thing for guitar, with the addition that the pawn shop<br/>

<br/>
The thing that works with unschooling is to follow delight - and<br/>
scatter it like a flower girl in front of the bride - not every<br/>
petal will be crushed to release fragrance - but enough will.<br/>
...of course to follow delight, you have to admit to yourself<br/>
that you feel delight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know you&#39;ve already gotten a lot of great responses on this, but I do <br/>
want to reiterate, being a guitarist and being the wife of a private guitar <br/>
teacher: Don&#39;t wait for being able to afford lessons.  Your daughter does <br/>
not need them, and they can take all the fun out of playing, especially if <br/>
you get the &quot;wrong&quot; teacher.  I&#39;ve seen it happen loads of times; lessons <br/>
can strip all the fun, joy and passion right out of guitar playing.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching oneself to play the guitar can be one of the great joys in life; <br/>
it&#39;s REALLY easy to do, and it can give a person the feeling of success <br/>
that&#39;ll make them want to continue with it.  Lessons*can* (not *will,* by <br/>
any means) do just the opposite.  Because guitar is such an incredibly easy <br/>
instrument to teach yourself and play as a beginner, it can be tremendously <br/>
fun from early on.  If a person is really driven to keep improving past the <br/>
point of just competency on the instrument, I believe that would be a good <br/>
time to seek out a teacher to take a guitar player to the next level.  But, <br/>
there are a lot of cool musical/math things to be gained from playing the <br/>
guitar, even at a beginner&#39;s level.  And, they can be gained without a <br/>
person ever being aware that they are gaining them.  Of course, one of the <br/>
big benefits is the notion that, &quot;If I can teach myself to play the guitar, <br/>
I can probably teach myself anything I really want or need to know.&quot;  Well, <br/>
at least it has worked out that way in my life.<br/>
<br/>
The best way for your daughter to get started on the guitar is to find out <br/>
what songs your daughter likes to listen to/sing along with the <br/>
most.  Then, get the easiest songbook with those songs in it, and make sure <br/>
the book has those little guitar chord diagram boxes in it.  Then, give her <br/>
the book and the guitar and get out of the way, unless she asks for help <br/>
figuring out the little diagrams.  Because she&#39;ll already know the songs, <br/>
her ear will help her self-correct. The diagrams are really <br/>
self-explanatory; in fact, that&#39;s exactly how I taught myself to play at <br/>
that age.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion that was made of having her be with other kids who are <br/>
playing guitar is a great, great suggestion. Just playing with and watching <br/>
other kids play the guitar will show your daughter lots of things that no <br/>
one will even have to explain to her.  That&#39;s how I learned three-finger <br/>
(Travis) picking, a technique I love and use to this very day!<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a classical/jazz guitarist and composer.  He didn&#39;t take any <br/>
lessons until he was 22 years old.  He was a great guitarist at that point, <br/>
but he felt that he needed something more formal to master jazz theory and <br/>
application and classical technique.  He still will take a lesson or two <br/>
from time to time, even though he really is a world-class player.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my time limit is running out. ;-)  Have fun!!<br/>
<br/>
Warm wishes,<br/>
<br/>

We were just looking at a butterfly bush from Spring<br/>
Hill...not sure how well it would grow here (Cape<br/>
Cod). I don&#39;t seem to have much of a green thumb. We<br/>
bought a box of mixed seeds that were supposed to<br/>
attract butterflies, but only a few plants actually<br/>
came up and my DH ended up (ok, he did it on purpose<br/>
and we went around about it) mowing them down...then<br/>
there was a disaster with a hydrangea...bought one,<br/>
put it in the ground, watered it; next day (a REALLY<br/>
hot day) the leaves looked burnt and it didn&#39;t grow<br/>
any all year although by fall there were a few leaves.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll recover this spring...I love<br/>
hydrangeas and really want to put in more this year if<br/>
I didn&#39;t kill that one last year. <br/>

&gt; The thing that works with unschooling is to follow<br/>
&gt; delight - and<br/>
&gt; scatter it like a flower girl in front of the bride<br/>
&gt; - not every<br/>
&gt; petal will be crushed to release fragrance - but<br/>
&gt; enough will.<br/>
&gt; ...of course to follow delight, you have to admit to<br/>
&gt; yourself<br/>
&gt; that you feel delight.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; | Hello, I&#39;m new to this group! My name is<br/>
&gt; Elizabeth. Right now<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; | just HSing my oldest, who just turned 7. We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; using the<br/>
&gt; Sonlight<br/>
&gt; | curriculum, and enjoying it alot, but I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; eventually like to<br/>
&gt; move<br/>
&gt; | away from the curriculum being the core of their<br/>
&gt; learning. By<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; | time she is a teen I&#39;d like her to be in charge of<br/>
&gt; most of her<br/>
&gt; | education although I will encourage specific<br/>
&gt; skills I think<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; | people need such as home economics and personal<br/>
&gt; financial<br/>
&gt; management.<br/>
&gt; | Our other children are 3; 19 months, and a Baby<br/>
&gt; due in August.<br/>
&gt; |<br/>
&gt; | Question is...right now she is not interested in<br/>
&gt; much of<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
&gt; | How can I help her to find interests? About the<br/>
&gt; only things she<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; | any sort of sustained interest in has been<br/>
&gt; butterflies and<br/>
&gt; wanting to<br/>
&gt; | play the guitar (which we intend to begin if we<br/>
&gt; can ever find<br/>
&gt; | affordable lessons for her).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755370021">LOL...Paul and I were talking about that last night,<br/>
just getting her one and letting her go with it as she<br/>
wants to; although I&#39;m interested in learning it<br/>
myself and teaching myself (I&#39;ve taught myself to play<br/>
the flute, and some basic sax and clarinet...I was<br/>
about 6 when I taught myself to read music at a<br/>
friend&#39;s house who had a piano and lesson books<br/>
available, let me come over and bang away at my<br/>
pleasure!!). <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welcome!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;...wanting to play the guitar (which we intend to<br/>
&gt; begin if we can ever <br/>
&gt; &gt;find affordable lessons for her).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Elizabeth<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know you&#39;ve already gotten a lot of great<br/>
&gt; responses on this, but I do <br/>
&gt; want to reiterate, being a guitarist and being the<br/>
&gt; wife of a private guitar <br/>
&gt; teacher: Don&#39;t wait for being able to afford<br/>
&gt; lessons.  Your daughter does <br/>
&gt; not need them, and they can take all the fun out of<br/>
&gt; playing, especially if <br/>
&gt; you get the &quot;wrong&quot; teacher.  I&#39;ve seen it happen<br/>
&gt; loads of times; lessons <br/>
&gt; can strip all the fun, joy and passion right out of<br/>
&gt; guitar playing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Teaching oneself to play the guitar can be one of<br/>
&gt; the great joys in life; <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s REALLY easy to do, and it can give a person the<br/>
&gt; feeling of success <br/>
&gt; that&#39;ll make them want to continue with it. <br/>
&gt; Lessons*can* (not *will,* by <br/>
&gt; any means) do just the opposite.  Because guitar is<br/>
&gt; such an incredibly easy <br/>
&gt; instrument to teach yourself and play as a beginner,<br/>
&gt; it can be tremendously <br/>
&gt; fun from early on.  If a person is really driven to<br/>
&gt; keep improving past the <br/>
&gt; point of just competency on the instrument, I<br/>
&gt; believe that would be a good <br/>
&gt; time to seek out a teacher to take a guitar player<br/>
&gt; to the next level.  But, <br/>
&gt; there are a lot of cool musical/math things to be<br/>
&gt; gained from playing the <br/>
&gt; guitar, even at a beginner&#39;s level.  And, they can<br/>
&gt; be gained without a <br/>
&gt; person ever being aware that they are gaining them. <br/>
&gt; Of course, one of the <br/>
&gt; big benefits is the notion that, &quot;If I can teach<br/>
&gt; myself to play the guitar, <br/>
&gt; I can probably teach myself anything I really want<br/>
&gt; or need to know.&quot;  Well, <br/>
&gt; at least it has worked out that way in my life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best way for your daughter to get started on the<br/>
&gt; guitar is to find out <br/>
&gt; what songs your daughter likes to listen to/sing<br/>
&gt; along with the <br/>
&gt; most.  Then, get the easiest songbook with those<br/>
&gt; songs in it, and make sure <br/>
&gt; the book has those little guitar chord diagram boxes<br/>
&gt; in it.  Then, give her <br/>
&gt; the book and the guitar and get out of the way,<br/>
&gt; unless she asks for help <br/>
&gt; figuring out the little diagrams.  Because she&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; already know the songs, <br/>
&gt; her ear will help her self-correct. The diagrams are<br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; self-explanatory; in fact, that&#39;s exactly how I<br/>
&gt; taught myself to play at <br/>
&gt; that age.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The suggestion that was made of having her be with<br/>
&gt; other kids who are <br/>
&gt; playing guitar is a great, great suggestion. Just<br/>
&gt; playing with and watching <br/>
&gt; other kids play the guitar will show your daughter<br/>
&gt; lots of things that no <br/>
&gt; one will even have to explain to her.  That&#39;s how I<br/>
&gt; learned three-finger <br/>
&gt; (Travis) picking, a technique I love and use to this<br/>
&gt; very day!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband is a classical/jazz guitarist and<br/>
&gt; composer.  He didn&#39;t take any <br/>
&gt; lessons until he was 22 years old.  He was a great<br/>
&gt; guitarist at that point, <br/>
&gt; but he felt that he needed something more formal to<br/>
&gt; master jazz theory and <br/>
&gt; application and classical technique.  He still will<br/>
&gt; take a lesson or two <br/>
&gt; from time to time, even though he really is a<br/>
&gt; world-class player.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, my time limit is running out. ;-)  Have fun!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warm wishes,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Marji <br/>

Thanks for the link...I&#39;m out on the Cape. I&#39;ll have<br/>
to check it out, maybe plan for a day out. I hadn&#39;t<br/>
thought about a kit, but I&#39;ll bet she&#39;d like that. I<br/>
know her science program has something about life<br/>
cycles coming up that it would go along nice with. <br/>

He is very good at it also.  Both my boys have guitars.  Not expensive ones. <br/>
You can pick up inexpensive ones at yard sales and pawn shops, thrift stores. <br/>
And they love to just play around with Dad.  He doesn&#39;t try to &quot;teach&quot; them <br/>
anything.  They just strum along.  I am sure if the interest continues that <br/>
they will either pick up on the chords etc on their own or ask Dad how to do <br/>
it.  But until then they have fun and it is great to see them enjoying the <br/>
time they spend with their Dad.<br/>
