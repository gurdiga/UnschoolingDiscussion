<div id="ygrps-yiv-601161148">Just a thought after all this talk about vaccinations...  I have a friend <br/>
whose husband is a chiropractor and none of their children are vaccinated, <br/>
have ever seen a doctor (other than him), all homeschooled, home birth, all <br/>
natural food... So I ask her one day &quot;so if you are all so natural presumably <br/>
you didn&#39;t mutilate your son by having him circumcised?&quot;  she looked and <br/>
looked at me and didn&#39;t say anything and then I said &quot;Oh I forget we live in <br/>
America where it&#39;s a cultural thing to mutilate your boys&quot;... <br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many people who live this &quot;natural life&quot; have done that to their <br/>
sons.  Being born in England myself there was never any thought of chopping <br/>
off parts of my son.  I married an American who thought that was going to <br/>
happen until I presented him with all the research from both countries, <br/>

<br/>
I asked my husband &quot;why would you want them to be circumcised?&quot; he said &quot;so <br/>
they&#39;d look like me&quot;.  My next question was &quot;so how often and how much do men <br/>
look at each other&#39;s penis&#39; and compare them?&quot;  He laughed and said &quot;not at <br/>
all&quot;...&quot;in fact we do everything to avoid eye contact and we certainly don&#39;t <br/>
chat like women do when they are in the bathroom (I&#39;d let him in on this <br/>
secret)&quot;... So next question &quot;if the research proves that it&#39;s not necessary <br/>
and men don&#39;t look at each other, why do a painful procedure that will change <br/>
their sexual experience forever?&quot;..... My logic won out, thank goodness.....<br/>
<br/>
When my boys (nearly 6 and nearly 2) recognize they are &quot;different&quot; from <br/>
daddy (the older one already has) we explained to him that we choose not to <br/>
mutilate him by circumcising him.  He just wanted to know what the word <br/>
mutilate meant and we had a great discussion about that..<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this will bring up some controversy as the majority of this list is <br/>
American.  Anyone British on here will know what I&#39;m talking about. <br/>
Justanother unschooling subject.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I didn&#39;t want to vaccinate and we were in the air force going <br/>
overseas at the time with out first child.  I tried to find a way out of it, <br/>
but short of staying in America and splitting my family up, there was no way <br/>
the air force was going to let us out of this country and into another <br/>
without vaccinations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507426343">When my oldest son was born (in Alabama) he was brought to me for the first time with a little roll of gauze and a sheet I had to sign saying I had been &#39;taught&#39; how to wrap his penis.  They circumcised him without even asking me.<br/>
<br/>
When my second son was born (with a midwife) the thought never crossed my mind to have him circumcised.  The boys are now 5 and almost 2 (*sniff*) and they run around naked all of the time.  Their sister (3) could care less and I have talked to the older one about what happened to his penis and he cried a little.  It is a scary thing to think about having happened to you!  He agreed it was good we did not do that to Ben.<br/>
<br/>
The only &#39;problem&#39; I have had so far is my then 7-year-old nephew kept saying that Ben&#39;s penis &#39;was not quite formed&#39;.  LOL  I told HIM all about what circumcision was (with his mom there).  Other than that one remark, no one has questioned our decision.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree-if you are living your ENTIRE lifestyle so your child has a wholesome, healthy foundation, then WHY do an elective surgery on the day they are born?<br/>

<br/>
The ped on call that day didn&#39;t even have his own boys done.  I just <br/>
went with the flow.  What a horrible experience it was for all of <br/>
us.  I missed the baby when they took him from me, so I decided to <br/>
pay him a visit during the procedure, you know, make sure he was o.k. <br/>
and all.  To my surprise, the dr. was standing at his feet with these <br/>
two teenage girls on either side of the isolete.  I couldn&#39;t figure <br/>
out what was going on.  Then I noticed a photographer in there taking <br/>
pictures!!!!!  When a nurse walked out I asked her what was going <br/>
on.  She seemed al little apprehensive and told me that the local <br/>
newspaper was doing a piece on the local highschool doing stuff <br/>
regarding &quot;career day&quot; or something like that.  She knew they had not <br/>
got my permission and was concerned  about it, but someone else told <br/>
her they would get my signature afterwords!!  Needless to say, I was <br/>
PISSED!  I confronted the photographer and he said he took shots that <br/>
were focused on the students not the baby and that he wouldn&#39;t use <br/>
the pictures unless I signed.  I should have demanded the film right <br/>
then and there, if thinking straight and feeling stronger, I would <br/>
have.  These students didn&#39;t even have masks on!!  This is the same <br/>
hospital who questioned my husband bringing in our other four kids to <br/>
visit! I was ready to take legal action I was sooo upset.  After <br/>
speaking to my dad who told me it was wrong of them to do that, but <br/>
to calm down because it wasn&#39;t good for me and just focus on the fact <br/>
that I had a beautiful healthy baby and let it go, and I did.  <br/>
<br/>
I did call the head of the hospital and they came down right away and <br/>
were SO SWEET to me.  You know they were quite concerned about a law <br/>
suit!  They even sent me a bouquet of flowers when I got home.<br/>

I don&#39;t have any objection to your choice to not have your son circumcised, <br/>
but we really didn&#39;t have a choice in the matter. It is a Jewish ritual(I <br/>
don&#39;t consider it mutilation) In Judaism it is done to symbolize basically <br/>
signing on the dotted line in each generation to follow the covenant of God. <br/>
  I guess that the word mutilate, sort of bothered me. This response is not <br/>

 </span></blockquote>         Hi Frances,<br/>
<br/>
I had been thinking about this, too. It seems I&#39;ve already stirred up some <br/>
controversy, so i didn&#39;t want to stick my foot in it again, but as a Jew I <br/>
also had a very different view point and approach to circumcision for my <br/>
boys. It should be noted, though, that the experience for a Jewish family <br/>
is VERY different from that of a non-Jewish family. Many of the things that <br/>
people are concerned about and have discussed here are simply not an issue <br/>
in a religious &quot;bris&quot;. For anyone interested, I&#39;d like to share the <br/>
experience. If you aren&#39;t interested, now would be a good time to hit the <br/>
delete button.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Before my youngest son was born, I already knew that he was a boy. That <br/>
meant that I had plenty of time to talk to the mohel (man responsible for <br/>
the actual circumcision ritual) and the rabbi in our community, as well as <br/>
time to pick out the people who would be given the various honors in the <br/>
ritual. Many in our community had the mohel go to their house for the bris, <br/>
but we opted for the bris to be held in the tiny synagogue, since it was <br/>
near our home and also had easier access than our own house for the guests <br/>
who would come. The Saturday morning after my son was born, the date and <br/>
time of the bris was announced in the synagogue service and anyone in the <br/>
community who wished to celebrate with us was invited. On the eighth day <br/>
after Andrew&#39;s birth, all of the extended family, our closest friends, and <br/>
a number of people from our community came to the synagogue for the bris. <br/>
Since it was an orthodox community, the area was gender divided, with men <br/>
only on the side of the sanctuary where the actual bris was held. Women <br/>
were on the other side of a hip-high divide -- most of them around me to <br/>
keep my mind off what they were doing on the other side! One man, who would <br/>
hold Andrew throughout the ceremony, was sitting up on a sturdy desk that <br/>
had been dragged out of the rabbi&#39;s study. My mother brought Andrew into <br/>
the sanctuary on a special pillow, and handed him to the friend, and then <br/>
joined me in the women&#39;s section. A few prayers were said. Andrew was given <br/>
a sip of kosher wine. And another. (The wine is both a part of many Jewish <br/>
rituals and a form of anesthetic in this case.) Some more prayers were <br/>
said, my husband was asked what the baby&#39;s name would be, a declaration to <br/>
all of those gathered was made as to the name of the child and that he was <br/>
a Jewish child, entering into the covenant of his father and his father&#39;s <br/>
fathers. More wine went down the kid&#39;s gullet throughout this period as our <br/>
friend stuck his finger in a glass of wine and then into Andrew&#39;s mouth to <br/>
suck. The circumcision was done with great care in more or less the manner <br/>
in which little boys have been circumcised for 3000 years in our <br/>
communities. Andrew let out one quick yowl,and then went back to sucking <br/>
the sweet wine off of our friend&#39;s finger. Final blessings were recited. <br/>
Then some more wine was drunk, this time by the grown ups. Andrew was given <br/>
back to me, thoroughly happy, and a bit sticky with wine.<br/>
<br/>
         As you can tell, this is nothing like the experience of a hospital <br/>
circumcision. There is much love and care, the baby is definitely <br/>
anesthetized, and there is no stage in the process when the baby is not <br/>
being held, cuddled, or at the very least touched by loving hands. A <br/>
non-Jewish friend of mine who was there commented about how lovely the <br/>
ritual had been and how wonderful it must be to have community and <br/>
traditions such as these. I fully agree -- if it were not so I would not be <br/>
a part of the traditions as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         But if you are not Jewish, are circumcisions necessary? Probably <br/>
not. They may be a good idea, though. There is still debate about the <br/>
relative benefits and drawbacks. So, for those who feel that they are a <br/>
good idea, I would suggest taking a page out of the Jewish ritual...  Don&#39;t <br/>
let your son be circumcised all alone in a hospital. Make sure that at the <br/>
very least you are there with him.  And if you would consider a birth at <br/>
home a good thing, then maybe a circumcision at home is a good thing too.<br/>

tat, but it is still dramatically and painfully altering the body of an <br/>
infant. one of the reasons usually touted for religious circ is to create a <br/>
covenant with god, the only female analogy on that level i could think of was <br/>
a celibate nun, and no one would dream of doing that to a young girl. <br/>
hysterectomy is a controversial topic lately, with a lot of doctors running <br/>
around saying, &#39;you&#39;ve had your babies, you don&#39;t need it anymore, let&#39;s just <br/>
take it out&#39;. so it&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but in my head the connection is <br/>
there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>         I won&#39;t call you crazy at all, but this is not the case. In fact, <br/>
Jewish families have one of if not *the* lowest rates of alcoholism in the <br/>
United States. Most Jewish children (and nearly all orthodox Jewish <br/>
children) are given wine throughout their life as part of ritual. Whether <br/>
it is at a bris at 8 days old (for a boy) or each Friday night and Saturday <br/>
during Sabbath meals and the rituals around them, or during holidays and <br/>
festivals (of which there is at least one in 11 out of 12 months of the <br/>
year). Our kids grow up around wine -- and other alcohol -- and learn to <br/>
treat it with respect.<br/>
<br/>
         There is a similarly low level of alcoholism in other cultures <br/>
that treat wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages as either ritual items <br/>
or ordinary parts of family dinners. Some people would say that it is <br/>
because there is no need to go sneaking alcohol as a teen if you know you <br/>
can have it openly. In any case, the attitude to alcohol is different and <br/>
so is the result.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;as a general rule, homebirthing philosophy doesn&#39;t merge well with<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>         Well, if you are Jewish or Christian and believe in the Bible as <br/>
the word of God, then you only need to look as far as Genesis to see why <br/>
Jews should circumcise their sons:<br/>
(GEN 17:11) And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it<br/>
shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.<br/>
(GEN 17:12) And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,<br/>
every man child in your generations, he that is born in the<br/>
house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of<br/>
thy seed.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you don&#39;t believe in the Bible as the word of God, then there <br/>
is really no explanation at all... except that those who do believe what <br/>
they will.<br/>

<br/>
I know of no unschooling families in which parents don&#39;t discuss what they&#39;re <br/>
doing and why, what they believe and why, and who don&#39;t ask their kids what <br/>
they&#39;re thinking and doing and why.   <br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;to teach&quot; one means half an hour each morning of Bible study with a <br/>
test on Friday, I&#39;d think that&#39;s not very  unschoolerish.<br/>

<br/>
I agree, I am largely (ha) anti-circ but I DO see a difference in how the<br/>
child is treated at a bris vs a medical setting. As strong as I feel<br/>
about never having another of my boys circ&#39;d, I still do feel as though<br/>
the parent shouldn&#39;t be bashed for thier choices, religious or not.  As<br/>
long as they are well thought out, with all options discussed, they are<br/>
doing what is in the best interest of their family. That is the essence<br/>
of parenthood! Making choices for your family and raising kids the way<br/>
you feel right. Many feel that unschooling is harming a child, ruining<br/>
them for the &quot;real world&quot;, and are willing to take you to court and<br/>
threaten you with jail time for that abuse if you refuse to conform to<br/>
&quot;their&quot; rules.  But we all know what is best for us, regardless of the<br/>
strong opinions of others.  And yes, I know that already there are<br/>
keyboards clicking away ready to tell me how &#39;mutilatin&#39; a boy and<br/>
unschooling are two totally different things, etc etc, but keep in mind,<br/>
everyone has their own ideas on what is extreme/harmful/etc. Everyone<br/>
thinks that their cause is the most important. :)<br/>
there are two sides to this issue, and most people will never &quot;give&quot; to<br/>
the other side, so it&#39;s going to be a never ending debate that should<br/>
probably go to another location. maybe?  <br/>
sorry if that annoys people, I usually hate it when people say &quot;stop<br/>
discussing X&quot; but this is so highly debatable that I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s a<br/>
whole &#39;nother list for that subject alone. <br/>

or no intervention. wanting to experience and allow birth for the naturally <br/>
beautiful process that it is. more about reclaiming the female body as right <br/>
and natural, and the newborn as well. about bringing a baby into the world in <br/>
a calm, natural and loving manner. usually this also means not rushing the <br/>
child away for shots, cleaning, foot pricks, gook in the eyes, etc.  imho <br/>
having a circ doesn&#39;t go through with this flow. and i&#39;ve not known many <br/>

sharing values and ethics in daily living and cutting off a piece of the body <br/>
to form a covenant with god.  <br/>
<br/>
i think this is a dead end. this is a religious debate. if someone believes <br/>
god is telling them to cut the end of their son&#39;s penis off, no human will <br/>
probably deter them.<br/>
i believe in god, and i want to share my views with my son, but ultimately <br/>
his religious path will be his own. i will commit him to nothing, especially <br/>
by using a dangerous, harmful and debilitating procedure.<br/>
i completely agree that the surroundings at the jewish ceremony sound ten <br/>
times better than that of a hospital.  but for me it isn&#39;t only the one time <br/>
event. it&#39;s the lasting effects. foreskin serves a purpose, at infancy and <br/>
throughout life. <br/>

<p><small><time>13 Aug 2001, at 11:38pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241931610">What we are doing, especially since my husband and I differ a little (but<br/>
not hugely) in our religious beliefs, is just having our children around<br/>
what we are doing, growing up as us as examples, answering questions, etc.<br/>
That as well as purposely picking up books and stocking in our house things<br/>
that the children may choose to read, and trying to avoid the books that we<br/>
don&#39;t find appropriate.  Though religiously speaking we are VERY open to<br/>
learning about other religions (I had a religious studies minor), there are<br/>
some other things I don&#39;t find appropriate for my home that we don&#39;t want<br/>
influencing our children (we don&#39;t let Julian watch violent cartoons, we<br/>
don&#39;t let him see daddy&#39;s violent games, and in the same way we don&#39;t let<br/>
him read books that portray different people in bad ways).<br/>
<br/>
We are Pagan.  So I have a lot of books about faeries, mythology, we have<br/>
coloring books that portray various gods and goddesses, and we celebrate<br/>
some Pagan holidays.  Spring Equinox we color eggs and have a egg hunt, we<br/>
leave an offering for Eostre in the form of an egg that we return to the<br/>
earth (we bury it).  Beltaine we danced around a May pole.  Being only 2 he<br/>
doesn&#39;t ask too much, but if he asks why a candle is burning, I tell him (at<br/>
least when able, if it is a magickal working of some sort you&#39;re not<br/>
supposed to speak of the magick that is being worked to a certain extent).<br/>
I read the stories to him, and at each of the sabbats we change our alter,<br/>
which usually corresponds with the seasons, and he helps me scavenge outside<br/>
or in craft stores for things that would be appropriate for it.<br/>
I don&#39;t want him to be pushed into a religion, but I also want our family to<br/>
have rituals that we follow to bring our family closer (like how most<br/>
families have Christmas or Hannukah, we have Yule).  And I want my children<br/>
to have a respect for all the religions, and to have good moral judgement<br/>
and have at the heart of their being a few basic ... I hate to call them<br/>
rules, but I can&#39;t think of a better word.  There is the threefold law<br/>
(everything that you do returns back to your threefold eventually, good or<br/>
bad) and Harm None (Wiccan crede basically saying not to do any harm to<br/>
anyone, including yourself, always think of the repurcusions before acting).<br/>
I don&#39;t think are necessarily religious doctrines that my kids must follow,<br/>
but just good things to live by to make my children good people.<br/>
So, I guess we unschool religious thought, but we do the holidays as a<br/>
family, and I hope that they&#39;ll receive a good moral foundation from it :)<br/>
