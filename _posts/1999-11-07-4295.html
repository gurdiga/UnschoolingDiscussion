<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130150668">This is rather rambling but I think the issues raised in it touch upon<br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
I keep cringing when people talk about units and study modules.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get it.  Why would someone substitute artificial contrived<br/>
questions for real life?<br/>
<br/>
I read a book by Laurens van der Post about the Kalahari Bushmen and how<br/>
they could bury a gourd of water and return to it months later after<br/>
huge windstorms had totally rearranged the terrain and find it.  They<br/>
learned the land in such tiny detail and noticed things to which we<br/>
would be totally blind.  Inuit have 8  (or maybe 2 dozen) words for<br/>
snow.<br/>
<br/>
We are brainwashed about schooling.  Learning is a natural bred in the<br/>
bone affair.  We are learning creatures.  What we decide to learn is<br/>
determined by our environments, our nurturing and our individual<br/>
natures.  The love of learning is diminished by the efforts of people to<br/>
force people to learn. This &quot;force&quot; can be subtle and manipulative or<br/>
overt and heavy-handed.<br/>
<br/>
It is as if people wouldn&#39;t want to know things if they weren&#39;t forced<br/>
to know them.  I believe the general populations&#39; dislike of learning<br/>
new things, their general provincialness, closed mindedness, passivity<br/>
is a direct result of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
People that love learning do it in spite of school not because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Schooling I think takes many forms in many cultures.  There may be<br/>
things imperative to learn in a particular culture for survival.  These<br/>
things are naturally learned, though some cultures may believe that you<br/>
must &quot;teach&quot; them in a ritualized manner.<br/>
<br/>
The lack of faith in the developmental unfolding of children into whole<br/>
adults is very widespread.  Yes sometime things go wrong but not<br/>
usually.<br/>
<br/>
I start to wonder if the adults in children&#39;s lives don&#39;t have enough<br/>
interests of their own and wind up obsessed with their children&#39;s<br/>
lives.  People are often trying to work out unresolved issues and<br/>
dilemmas from their own childhoods<br/>
through their children.  Usually we aren&#39;t aware of these problematic<br/>
undercurrents.<br/>
<br/>
Our love for our children sometimes blinds us.  We think we must &quot;do&quot;<br/>
something other than live our lives, follow our interests, provide that<br/>
loving, nurturing, welcoming, enthusiastic, protective, nest that<br/>
provides a home for the heart.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that the work ethic enters into this.  The idea that maybe<br/>
just &quot;being&quot; is sufficient is very difficult for people to take in.  We<br/>
must &quot;work&quot; at everything.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe people of an artistic bent understand this better.  Art is<br/>
a passion which emerges from their core.  Any &quot;work&quot; they do is demanded<br/>
by the art not something they feel obligated to do because it is &quot;right&quot;<br/>
to work.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that we must work for everything seems to me to be a<br/>
distortion.  A particularly western distortion which results in people<br/>
working all of the time to the detriment of the general welfare and the<br/>
quality of relationships between everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thoreau commented on when he was making notes in his notebooks how<br/>
people thought he was calculating his wages.<br/>
<br/>
We really don&#39;t need any more lessons in &quot;work&quot;.  We need lessons in<br/>
&quot;being&quot;.  Reflection, revelation and perhaps reverence are a more<br/>
important three &quot;R&#39;s&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Our mad consuming, appetite driven, never satiated society that we are<br/>
immersed within colors our &quot;unschooling&quot; efforts.  That walk in the<br/>
neighborhood with the children seems much more important than &quot;study&quot;.<br/>
The only study worth much is that which one chooses for oneself.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone resists somebody else telling them, covertly or otherwise what<br/>
to do.  We can enlist each others voluntary cooperation for tasks that<br/>
we are each persuaded are in our interest to do but covert manipulation<br/>
will always return to haunt us.<br/>
<br/>
I am not being terribly clear but I know what I am trying to say.  Does<br/>
anyone else I suppose is the question.<br/>

<br/>
Rambling it may be, but I really liked what you had to say. I have had<br/>
squirmy feelings about unit studies. In some ways they are better than some<br/>
other types of &#39;school&#39; work but they always feel somewhat contrived to me.<br/>
When we read the &#39;Little House&#39; books we managed to come up with enough<br/>
questions to keep us going interminably! The questions were ours, not<br/>
someone else&#39;s. The follow up activities (if you want to talk in schooly<br/>
terms) were what interested us, not someone else. It became relevant to us.<br/>
Not all books produce in depth questions and &#39;extention activities&#39; and<br/>
that&#39;s okay too.<br/>
<br/>
Some books or activities take us in directions that other people may never<br/>
think of. Some small thing triggers a line of thought and exploration that<br/>
may be only faintly related to the original experience.<br/>
<br/>
For example, recently we visited a Gouda cheese making factory. This could<br/>
have triggered an interest in various aspects of cheese, but as the owners<br/>
were originally from Holland, it might have triggered an interest in that<br/>
country, or in why people emigrate from their home countries, or, or, or....<br/>
But the interest generated would have been relevant to us. A school class<br/>
visiting would have had a preset agenda. So would a family doing a unit<br/>
study. And how would those parents / teachers have coped with the outcome we<br/>
experienced - although my kids found the visit interesting, the only<br/>
follow-up activity they were interested in was buying some Gouda cheese and<br/>
pigging out on cheese and crackers!<br/>
<br/>
And that fine with me - I don&#39;t expect either me or my kids to want to<br/>
follow up on everything. Nor do I expect us all to find the same things<br/>
fascinating. Nor do I want to have to have a preset agenda.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never thought of myself as having a strong work ethic &lt;bg&gt; but in spite of<br/>
my &#39;head&#39; beliefs, I do still struggle with the being / doing thing. I often<br/>
catch myself feeling guilty for just &#39;being&#39;, or for doing something just<br/>
for the fun / interest / joy of it instead of something &#39;useful&#39;. And catch<br/>
myself criticising the kids for that too :-(  Still, awareness is the first<br/>
step, and I&#39;m working on it!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Reflection, revelation and perhaps reverence are a more<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes I think it is better to say to the kid &#39;I don&#39;t care whether you<br/>
like doing this math/writing/art/music/whatever but you have to do it<br/>
because I say so&#39;, than to say &#39;we are going to have ever so much fun doing<br/>
this exciting unit study. Nonsense, of course it&#39;s fun, what do you mean,<br/>
you&#39;re not interested, this is fun.&#39; It sometimes  seems to me that kids<br/>
doing unit studies have an awful lot of pressure placed on them to enjoy<br/>
studying someone else&#39;s interests &#39;because you should be grateful, you could<br/>
be sitting down doing boring workbooks you know&#39;. But maybe it&#39;s just a way<br/>
of sugaring the bitter medicine.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, who knows if I understood what you were trying to say &lt;g&gt;?  But I&#39;ve<br/>
had my say anyway!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to put together a ?newsletter? for a small group of homeschooling<br/>
families that are getting together for some activities, and I&#39;m wanting to<br/>
try and promote some interesting discussions among the adults. Could I<br/>
publish your post in it please, as I feel it raising some interesting<br/>
questions that should stir them up a little (or even a lot)?<br/>

Doesn&#39;t this all go together? we have forgotten how to learn because for <br/>
years it has been forced on us. We think that is learning and we don&#39;t like <br/>
it. Only when your sick enough of it do you develop the courage to try <br/>
something different. Hopefully during this phase one will stub a toe on real <br/>
life and look up grinning :). &quot;Aha! So this is what I&#39;ve forgotten&quot; Sounds <br/>
silly but I like the idea.<br/>
    I remember when everything excited me and I wanted to try many things. <br/>
Years later I was very much aware that I had lost some spark in my life and <br/>
myself. I think this may be it. I was going through the motions of living and <br/>
resenting most of it.<br/>

listen. To words such as yours and our children&#39;s. We cannot emerge from <br/>
where ever our lives have been and instantly know what to do. This too is a <br/>
learning experience. My own children are excellent teachers because they <br/>
still have their spirit intact and will not for a minute let me force them <br/>
into something they are not interested in. This works both ways, I see when <br/>
they are being compliant to manipulate me. We are all learning and although <br/>
some of it is painful, much is exciting. I feel the old wonder coming back <br/>
again.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joel,<br/>
<br/>
I very much appreciated your post and understand your way of looking at<br/>
this issue of utilizing units and study modules.  My thought however is you<br/>
must never have had kids in ps.  Perhaps I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Having had my oldest dd in ps for 4 years has devastated her desire to<br/>
learn.  It took from July of &#39;98 until March of &#39;99 to see her pick<br/>
anything to do on her own.  ANYTHING!  Ooops, one exception - she did graph<br/>
her Halloween candy last year.  (And from what I&#39;ve heard I have had great<br/>
success with her moving toward unschooling - something like I could have<br/>
gone 4 years or more before seeing this.  Yikes! ) Now part of this was my<br/>
own problem with letting go and relaxing.  I, as I&#39;m sure you do too, look<br/>
at my children&#39;s education as being extremely important.  My state&#39;s laws<br/>
have basic requirements that I feel I must be sure are met in order to be<br/>
honest with them about our efforts at hsing.  It is my belief that one day<br/>
my dd will be entirely leading her own education but I don&#39;t see it any<br/>
time soon.  Maybe two years or so from now.  I hope and pray.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned, the Prairie Primer provides us with a springboard for when<br/>
they don&#39;t know what to do.  (Now, I do see that my 6 yog would unschool in<br/>
an instant without a hitch - she only went to preschool - where I worked -<br/>
yet she is stifled somewhat by the transition with the older dd.)  I have a<br/>
real problem with them sitting around doing nothing but watching TV,<br/>
tickling each other and doing crosstitch - although all can have great<br/>
educational benefits if chosen wisely (TV chosen wisely.)  If and when they<br/>
choose to do something that can build their language arts or math skills -<br/>
I&#39;m a happy camper and do my own thing.  Or if they read about history or<br/>
do science projects.  But when they get to the point of as I put it<br/>
&quot;goofing off&quot; then I feel the need to direct them a little.  To me that<br/>
means giving them choices of things I find acceptable/educational.  I know,<br/>
I know, everything is educational - but time is short and I do have a<br/>
responsibility to see that they don&#39;t waste theirs.  Besides, they ask to<br/>
do the Little House books and activities as a matter of fact I have trouble<br/>
keeping up with them!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My desire would be that at say a high school level, my dds would be able to<br/>
choose what they study but that they would be diligent in pursuing these<br/>
interests, not just flitting about from one more or less useless subject to<br/>
another (somehow I know I&#39;m going to catch it for this post :o).  And that<br/>
by then they would be wise enough to realize there may be things out there<br/>
they NEED to pursue whether they WANT to or not to achieve their personal<br/>
goals.  And that they do it themselves without compulsion.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the unit study is my crutch, my safety net and hers too as she was<br/>
taught what, how and when to learn anything in ps.  I find it appalling.  I<br/>
hate it!  But I feel it necessary in the transition of ps to unschooling.<br/>
I tried deschooling off and on for several months last year only to find it<br/>
drove both she and I crazy.  So I sought something that could be a<br/>
springboard so we could sleep at night.  We&#39;ve even gone back to &quot;doing&quot;<br/>
math several times a week - in several different ways not just text books<br/>
as I was totally uncomfortable with her not touching math at all.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t utilize everything in the unit study, we pick and choose according<br/>
to our interests (OK sometimes I see something I believe they REALLY need<br/>
to know, like &quot;manners&quot;, and push a little :o)  but, I&#39;m much better at<br/>
letting it go when I see there is no real interest in a subject.  The<br/>
Primer also may just say - &quot;study the moon.&quot;  Not how to study it or<br/>
exactly what to do with every activity (some do but relatively few - we<br/>
don&#39;t usually choose to do the more directed ones anyway.) So we can delve<br/>
in any way we want.  For example, this week we are going to the woods to<br/>
look at fungi in the woods, perhaps draw a few if they are into it.  The<br/>
Primer just said - study about fungi and lichens.  I got a library book to<br/>
which they groaned and today we were in the woods cutting firewood and they<br/>
were fascinated with two samples of fungi they found.  So it is not the<br/>
topic they object to it is the method - don&#39;t just sit us down with a book<br/>
Mom!  But I do have a subtile hope that going out and looking around may<br/>
spike their interest enough to at least make the book worth looking through.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is providing me with a gentle adjustment from my schooling experiences<br/>
as well.  I hope it is also giving her a gentle adjustment as cold turkey<br/>
just wasn&#39;t working for either of us.  I don&#39;t believe a child that is<br/>
worried they are not learning what all their ex-school friends are will be<br/>
free enough to learn on their own - my daughter fell into this box.  She<br/>
still compares what she is learning with what her best friend in ps is<br/>
doing.  About a month ago it set her off and she sought out how to read the<br/>
latitude and longitude markings on maps and globes - on her own!  She<br/>
sought out a workbook on geography to accomplish it but she did it!  I<br/>
didn&#39;t make her - she wanted to.  To me that was thrilling.<br/>
<br/>
Right now I see her adjustment level (cross stitch, read, and watch TV) as<br/>
still a little unacceptable.  I&#39;m THRILLED she is now reading because she<br/>
loves it and feel so thankful for that.  But cross stitch is a pass time<br/>
and TV - well, don&#39;t get me started on that subject - I married a man that<br/>
studied cinematography (sp?) and his TV addiction drives me nuts - the kids<br/>
come by it honestly.  Aren&#39;t pass times just for that - passing the time?<br/>
To me simply watching time pass is not useful.  I&#39;m not talking about time<br/>
to digest what they have been learning here I&#39;m talking about it being the<br/>
main subject on their menus.<br/>
<br/>
I am a part of a support group that has a lot of unschoolers in it.  And<br/>
what I have seen is those that actually unschool (versus eclectic approach)<br/>
have all unschooled from day one and had learned a lot about unschooling<br/>
for years before they had to notify the schools of their intent to hs.<br/>
They had time to think it all through and become convinced.  I on the other<br/>
hand had considered hsing before my dd went to ps but had never heard of<br/>
any other method than school-at-home Calvert style.  I learned about<br/>
unschooling 2 months before we started hsing.  It is taking a lot more time<br/>
than 2 months to change the thought patterns and habit patterns.  Visiting<br/>
with teens that have unschooled their entire lives has been the main thing<br/>
that keeps me wanting to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this makes sense to a hard core unschooler or not but I<br/>
really think it is a different situation to pull them out than it is to<br/>
keep them home from the start and KNOW you want to unschool to begin with.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you to understand why I would even entertain the thought<br/>
of a unit study approach even on a limited basis.  Now, I&#39;m all ears -<br/>
convince me to go back to cold turkey.  <br/>

&gt;&gt; I do think that the work ethic enters into this.  The idea that maybe<br/>
&gt;&gt; just &quot;being&quot; is sufficient is very difficult for people to take in.  We<br/>
&gt;&gt; must &quot;work&quot; at everything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I never thought of myself as having a strong work ethic &lt;bg&gt; but in spite of<br/>
&gt;my &#39;head&#39; beliefs, I do still struggle with the being / doing thing. I often<br/>
&gt;catch myself feeling guilty for just &#39;being&#39;, or for doing something just<br/>
&gt;for the fun / interest / joy of it instead of something &#39;useful&#39;. And catch<br/>
&gt;myself criticising the kids for that too :-(  Still, awareness is the first<br/>
&gt;step, and I&#39;m working on it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have more than a struggle with &quot;being&quot; - what the heck does that mean<br/>
anyway?  :o)  No one has yet to make that comment meaningful to me - just<br/>
&quot;be&quot;.???????<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I think it is better to say to the kid &#39;I don&#39;t care whether you<br/>
&gt;like doing this math/writing/art/music/whatever but you have to do it<br/>
&gt;because I say so&#39;, than to say &#39;we are going to have ever so much fun doing<br/>
&gt;this exciting unit study. Nonsense, of course it&#39;s fun, what do you mean,<br/>
&gt;you&#39;re not interested, this is fun.&#39; It sometimes  seems to me that kids<br/>
<br/>
&gt;doing unit studies have an awful lot of pressure placed on them to enjoy<br/>
&gt;studying someone else&#39;s interests &#39;because you should be grateful, you could<br/>
&gt;be sitting down doing boring workbooks you know&#39;. But maybe it&#39;s just a way<br/>
&gt;of sugaring the bitter medicine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, yes, I&#39;m sure there are unit study users out there that do just this.<br/>
And I agree - just tell them they are going to do XXXXX.  But I know I<br/>
don&#39;t approach our unit studies this way.  My dd wanted to study the ocean<br/>
- it was a direct request.  So, I&#39;m trying to help her do this.  We have<br/>
made a posterboard of the ocean floor, put animals in it and studied some<br/>
of the animals.  We will pursue it more through library books as long as<br/>
they are interested.  But do you know what, she would do nothing about it<br/>
if I just looked at her and said &quot;great honey - study the ocean!&quot;  So what<br/>
do you do differently when your child wants to study a subject?<br/>
<br/>
I really would like some answers to these questions as they are the<br/>
principle things that seem to keep coming up for me.  Things that greatly<br/>
limit our ability to &quot;let go,&quot; &quot;relax,&quot; and &quot;be.&quot;  <br/>

&gt;The only study worth much is that which one chooses for oneself.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Everyone resists somebody else telling them, covertly or otherwise what<br/>

&gt;&gt;we are each persuaded are in our interest to do but covert manipulation<br/>
&gt;&gt;will always return to haunt us. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    This is all true and we all learn it soon enough if we are willing to <br/>
&gt;listen. To words such as yours and our children&#39;s. We cannot emerge from <br/>
&gt;where ever our lives have been and instantly know what to do. This too is a <br/>
&gt;learning experience. My own children are excellent teachers because they <br/>
&gt;still have their spirit intact and will not for a minute let me force them <br/>
&gt;into something they are not interested in. This works both ways, I see when <br/>
&gt;they are being compliant to manipulate me. We are all learning and although <br/>
&gt;some of it is painful, much is exciting. I feel the old wonder coming back <br/>

That is what I&#39;ve been trying to say!  We didn&#39;t know what to do - me or<br/>
the kids!  We are learning as we go, we are changing and adjusting, but<br/>
must remain peaceful in the process.  Now, when the peace is disturbed here<br/>
at our house it is because we are becoming more independent learners and<br/>
are revolting against how we are doing what we are doing (our most recent<br/>
math adventures are easiest to site.)  I even forsee a day when we will no<br/>
longer need the Prairie Primer even as a springboard.  But until then, we<br/>
use it - it doesn&#39;t rule us.  At least not completely.  :o)<br/>

    It&#39;s almost always when they want something, especially the 11yro, he&#39;s <br/>
the instigator. Although it did not take long to catch on I still am not sure <br/>
how to handle this situation. <br/>

other, make their beds and do several pages out of every workbook we own.LOL<br/>
Then they drop the bomb, they want something. A deck of Pokemon cards, a ride <br/>
to get Pokemon cards, rent videos,etc. They have even had me believing they <br/>
couldn&#39;t wait to go to the library, which by the way takes us past all the <br/>
above mentioned.<br/>
    The hard part is that they are being wonderfully cooperative, as long as <br/>
they get their way. I am to the point where I told them I&#39;d rather they do <br/>
nothing than to use me that way. I would not even object to giving them a <br/>
treat but I want it to all be up front. I really dislike the fact that they <br/>

that I&#39;m very proud of them for all the hard work they put in that day but<br/>
that there was no deal about me taking them anywhere or doing anything for<br/>
them to begin with so it is not reasonable that they expect it.  And thus,<br/>

these types of situations.  I try to teach my kids that we don&#39;t do things<br/>

it was an ethical deal.<br/>

I was thinking of something totally different when I asked what you meant.<br/>
I thought you were saying they would comply with what you wanted them to do<br/>
so they could get you to do what they wanted academically.  It just didn&#39;t<br/>
fit for me so I asked - had no idea it was leading to this conversation.<br/>
Much clearer now.  Thanks!<br/>

OK here&#39;s a question. I have found that if I wait my kids learn things so <br/>
easily when they are ready that they struggled over at a younger age. So as <br/>

this is not the case, at times I think I&#39;m even losing what I once knew. What <br/>

a frustration to you.  I don&#39;t mean to be minimizing it.<br/>
<br/>
On another list there was a mom who had a foster kid and a younger kid that<br/>
she and the DH had actually made themselves (is that a natural child?  I<br/>
find that term odd) and the foster kid would always put the<br/>
younger kid up to ask for things that he was clearly too young to want or<br/>
even know about.  People suggested that that was because the foster kid<br/>
might have thought that his requests would not be taken as seriously.  The<br/>
mom said she was going to talk with the foster kid and help him find more<br/>
direct ways of expressing his wants and would try to let him know that it<br/>
was o.k. to want things, that they wouldn&#39;t automatically say no.<br/>
<br/>
::Treading very gently and just wondering, since it&#39;s driving you crazy:: Is<br/>
it possible that your kids don&#39;t think that they&#39;d get their requests taken<br/>
seriously? Is there perhaps a past of saying &quot;If you do [this] then you can<br/>
have [whatever]?&quot;  Or did you mention this very pattern in a past post and I<br/>
just missed it?  Might it be worth talking with them about why they think<br/>
they have to do all this to get you to consider what they want?  (or have<br/>
you already done this)<br/>

But there is a bright side...Who knows, maybe they&#39;re nascent chess masters!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376009977">I have been lurking for several months, just enjoying the conversation,<br/>
but feel compelled to enter it now.  Re: the children doing nothing more<br/>
than eating the cheese with crackers and you feel the whole experience<br/>
was not a learning one.  I guess that is one of the areas I feel<br/>
differentiates UNschooling--why do you feel a need to determine what<br/>
constitutes a &quot;learning experience&quot; for _them_, why are you not enjoying<br/>
the cheese and crackers with them and enjoying the chance to observe<br/>
your own children at a peaceful moment, doing something pleasant,<br/>
involved with your own learning experience?  Learning will come and you<br/>
will see it, but not when you are trying to be in control, or directing,<br/>
it, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
I was in your spot twenty-some years ago.  I took my older two children<br/>
out of school and then was rather puzzled when they were not ecstatic to<br/>
do all these wonderful things _I_ put together for them.  I never sent<br/>
the two younger ones.  All four were extremely good at balking when I<br/>
tried to determine their lives.  I like to say we evolved into<br/>
unschooling, with plenty of bumps along the way.  Well, they are all<br/>
grown and parents in their own right now.  One of my sons has not<br/>
decided if he will homeschool or not--his babies are two and 6 months.<br/>
The others are in active homeschooling families.  Thank goodness for<br/>
John Holt and GWS and their constant assurance that children really can<br/>
and do learn what is important to them.  I needed it.  However, over the<br/>
years, as I learned to observe my children and learn from them, it all<br/>
came right.  You are really not far at all from the point where they<br/>
will constantly &quot;wow&quot; you with the depths of information they will gain<br/>
in pursuit of a subject of their own desire.  Hang in there and when you<br/>
feel stressed, RELAX and watch your children.  They will lead you to<br/>
unschooling, if you will let them.<br/>
<br/>
I never had much patience with bickering--still don&#39;t.  Over the years,<br/>
I tried many creative approaches to managing it, like &quot;Take it into<br/>
another room where I can&#39;t hear you.  If I hear you, I will think you<br/>
are just bored and I will think of something for you to do.  Trust me,<br/>
you will not like what I think of near as well as something you think of<br/>
yourself&quot;.  That was somewhat successful because we lived in a very<br/>
small house at the time, thin walls, and it is hard to argue in<br/>
whispers!  Another reasonably good one was, &quot;this problem is between the<br/>
two of you and you will have to solve it, through discussion, on your<br/>
own.  Negotiate til you reach an agreement you are both satisfied with<br/>
and let me know when you&#39;re finished.  An agreement to disagree, respect<br/>
one another&#39;s separate views and right to do so, and to avoid each other<br/>
is perfectly acceptable&quot;.  This last one works really well with my<br/>
grandchildren, who are a part of my day-to-day life, even the little<br/>
bitties.  They have to sit together on the love seat, discuss their<br/>
problem, reach a solution, and let me know it is solved, before they can<br/>
rejoin the play.<br/>
<br/>
And so now, after putting in my much more than two cents&#39; worth, I have<br/>
to tell you that I will be going no-mail for two weeks while I go visit<br/>
my sister in Texas (I am in Oklahoma).  This was not intentional to<br/>
prevent flack from this post; it has been planned for some time!  I look<br/>
forward to joining you again, hearing your thoughts, and telling you<br/>
much, much more than you probably ever would want to know about my kids<br/>
and grandkids, all of whom are really simply incredible!<br/>

&lt;&lt; we try to raise them to accept the same boring<br/>
<br/>
adulthood which we like to term &quot;success.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
just last nite mdh and i were discussing what we want for our children, and <br/>
he kept mentioning wanting them to be successful.   tho i pressed for a <br/>
definition of it, he didnt come up with it.  in fact he may have acknowledged <br/>
that he wasnt sure.   i think the best thing we can offer our children is <br/>
that unconditional love that all humans thrive on... anyway, dh seems so much <br/>
more centered on preparing our kids for being &quot;successful&quot; and (from knowing <br/>
him) he means that they wont be &quot;deadbeats&quot; and will be able make a good <br/>
living.  i admitted to him that i have moved (in my lifetime) from the care <br/>
of a father (provider-wise) to him, and that i have never had the <br/>
responsibility of providing a living for myself, let alone a growing family.  <br/>
this is a pressure that he feels and is real, and i am fortunate that he <br/>
takes that responsibility so seriously.  on the other hand, i dont want him <br/>
to pass on the pressurized situation that he was under to perform well and be <br/>
successful just to please and perform.  we are unique and created with a <br/>
purpose and can find that way more directly when not pressured to please and <br/>
perform for our parents.  dh and i often see opposing sides to an issue and i <br/>
know we bless each other w/our differences...  so i want us to continue to <br/>
discuss and refine because otherwise i lean towards not wanting him to spoil <br/>
my attempts and he probably feels the same way too sometimes!!<br/>

if you dont teach in a ritualized manner, you can teach by modeling, and <br/>

 it possible that your kids don&#39;t think that they&#39;d get their requests taken<br/>

    As far as treading gently don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not offended. I have always <br/>
made it a point not to promise my kids anything that I can&#39;t deliver of <br/>
course in life sometimes things are out of our control so the promise may be <br/>
broken. Obviously if my car breaks down we can&#39;t go to a movie, etc. <br/>
    The problem is that they don&#39;t need what they want. They are not deprived <br/>
children. They simply want everything they see. Especially anything Pokemon. <br/>
I think we have indulged them too often and now I have to figure out how much <br/>
is too much and how to turn it off.<br/>

    I think my dh and I do the same thing. OTOH our older boys are now at an <br/>
age when they are leaving home, I am seeing first hand how hard it is for <br/>
them to at least support themselves. We did not hs these boys and I wonder if <br/>
the difficulty they have is a result of school, something we did, or just a <br/>
natural occurrence one must go through on the way to adulthood.<br/>
    I know I can&#39;t prevent every hardship in life but I would sure like to <br/>
see the last 2 be more prepared to go out on their own. I see so many young <br/>
people we know who don&#39;t have a clue what they want to do or if they do, how <br/>
to do it. <br/>

Maybe they would naturally thrive, blossom, and reach full potential if<br/>
there were lots of models for this in their world?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m unclear why you would expect visual and vocal excitment about a field<br/>
trip set up by someone else and attended by a whole host of people?  Did<br/>
their interest lead them to ask you to set up a field trip with the support<br/>
group? I&#39;m serious.  Remember leading isn&#39;t just about choosing the topic<br/>
and having someone else direct activities within the topic.<br/>
<br/>
Now to confuse matters, it can sometimes work that way.   My kids have said<br/>
what about _____ and I&#39;ve said well, we can do _____and ____ or _____.  Then<br/>
we go from there. But I never expect just because we have set something up<br/>
that they,are even I, will love it.  The mix of people there, the weather,<br/>
what we ate, who fought with whom and how close to the trip,  ALL of these<br/>
things have an effect.  If we get somewhere and it&#39;s boring or not what we<br/>
expected we make the best of it can escape as soon as we are able.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s another kicker, being interested in something does not mean we<br/>
always want to dive into the topic and learn tons about it.  Even kids have<br/>
surface interests, something will pique their curosity, after some<br/>
reflection/thinking time it&#39;s time to move on, until life brings that topic<br/>
up again itself.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t predict and plan too much learning when you respect the cycles of<br/>
the children. You can only be there to answer questions, give your opinion<br/>
and help when requested. It can feel very chaotic.  Unless you are blessed<br/>
with a child who loves to plan and carry out plans! I&#39;ve heard they make<br/>
them like that somewhere. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
