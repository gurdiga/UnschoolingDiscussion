<div id="ygrps-yiv-624570193">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been offline for awhile - but I have a question and wonder if anyone<br/>
has any insight/suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
  My ds would like to read - he is motivated by his gameboy and by the fact<br/>
that he would like to learn magic and surprise us with it, but he can&#39;t read<br/>
the book.  His dad plays gameboy with him alot and obviously reads for him,<br/>
me and my dd are also asked several times daily to help read his game for<br/>
him.  My dd has also helped him with the magic - but he is really wanting to<br/>
read himself and not rely on us.<br/>
<br/>
  I have tried a reading program with him (at his request) that worked very<br/>
quickly for his sister, but he is so obviously different in his learning<br/>
style, or perhaps readiness, that he gets frustrated with it.  He has<br/>
trouble remembering the phonetic sounds once we sit down and look at words -<br/>
he excels at the flashcards, but once we look at words - he struggles with<br/>
remembering the sounds.  He understands about stringing them together - once<br/>
he remembers (or I remind him) the sound - then he &quot;reads&quot; the words easily.<br/>
It&#39;s the remembering part that seems so difficult for him.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not sure how to proceed - he&#39;s a happy kid, very glad not to be in<br/>
school, but still seems very interested in reading.<br/>
  Would you suggest a different approach/program?  If so, which one?  Would<br/>
you suggest continuing to read to him (which we do daily) and his ability<br/>
will catch up to his desire one day?<br/>
<br/>
  Because he has a hard time remembering, he will say &quot;I always forget&quot; and<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll never learn how to read&quot;.  I empathize with his frustration, etc. but<br/>
have not yet encountered this with my daughter.  Of course, they&#39;re<br/>
different!<br/>
<br/>
  I look forward to any replies.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe giving him letters and letting him put them together might <br/>
help. Ds&#39; Reader Rabbit Kindergarten software has a game where you <br/>
have to fill in the blank: _at and he&#39;s supposed to pick the &#39;c&#39;. <br/>
There are other games online, at Playhouse Disney--JoJo&#39;s letter game <br/>
and such that play with phonics but aren&#39;t quite &quot;put these sounds <br/>
together into a word.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or you could label lots of household items with words. If he <br/>
memorizes a bunch of words, it might help him to relax about reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-470315703">I dont know exactly what his level is now but the leapfrog videos are helping my daughter a lot. One introduces letter sounds in a fun way ....for example the h&#39;s are in a very hot room and sweat and say h h like they are hot<br/>
. The t&#39;s are tapping t&#39;s  etc. The next one starts making 3 letter words with short vowels and the last one starts covering long vowels, a few blends such as sh, and common rules like silent e and when 2 vowels go walking the first does the talking. <br/>

btw if you havent seen them these are regular dvs or vhs tapes nothing that requires a special leap frog toy to use<br/>

would it help him to let him know that lots of unschoolers arent <br/>
reading proficiently at his age? My son needed alot more help at age <br/>
7 with videogames, than he does now at age 8 (needs very little <br/>
now)...can you find a magic book that has clear pictures, so that he <br/>
doesnt really need to read in order to do the trick? Or maybe a <br/>
video about magic tricks that he could play when you&#39;re not in the <br/>
room, so he can suprise you with the trick? My son learned a really <br/>
neat trick off of the Disney Channel. <br/>

As far as &quot;sounding out&quot; words, and reading phonetically, my son <br/>
seems to look at the whole word and &quot;just know&quot; what it is, and he <br/>
seems to be able to pronounce words just fine that dont at all sound <br/>
like how theyre spelled. <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I suggest gently encouraging him and holding the firm belief that his brain  <br/>
will develop to the point of learning to read, and believing that only then <br/>
will  he read.  Reading, like learning to ride a bike or being a father or being <br/>
 responsible enough to stay home by yourself, is a &quot;some day&quot; kind of  thing.<br/>
 <br/>
As in, &quot;some day&quot; you&#39;ll be able to jump and touch the top of the  door <br/>
frame.  &quot;Some day&quot; you&#39;ll be able to ride your bike the store by  yourself.  &quot;Some <br/>
day&quot; you&#39;ll be able to cook dinner for the family.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a hopeful and matter-of-fact way of looking at it.  Recognizing  that <br/>
the brain develops as the body does, and not every body develops at the  same <br/>
rate; nor does every brain.  His body and brain are changing and  developing and <br/>
he&#39;s different than anyone else.  Some read later, some  earlier.  He *will* <br/>
read.  When he&#39;s ready.<br/>
 <br/>
Pass this idea on to him.  He could be lamenting that he can&#39;t  touch the top <br/>
of the door frame by jumping.  Start by jumping to touch the  top of the <br/>
fence, the net on the basketball goal, the edge of the stop sign on  the corner.  <br/>
My eldest son, at 6, cried because he didn&#39;t have as many  trophies as his dad <br/>
did.  &quot;But you will, son.  You will.&quot;  (He  did.)<br/>
 <br/>
My youngest son just happened to learn to read at 7.  Having  discovered <br/>
unschooling when he was a baby, I&#39;d never had anything but  confidence in his <br/>
ability to learn the things he wanted to learn when his  developing brain and body <br/>
were ready.  He grew up with that reality.   I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s why he <br/>
learned at 7 over any other age.  But I  believe that&#39;s why he never had any <br/>
anxiety about it or frustration that he  couldn&#39;t do it, yet.<br/>
 <br/>
Be hopeful and encouraging.  Don&#39;t focus on the can&#39;t.  Focus on  the will.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just wanted to second this one. That is kind of how DS reads. <br/>
He &quot;absorbs&quot; words whole, then applies things he&#39;s learned from them <br/>
to new words he meets. Can&#39;t say exactly how, it just is. From what <br/>
MIL says, that&#39;s how DH learned to read too (before he started <br/>
school).<br/>
<br/>
One thing we did that might be helpful (or not) is &quot;buddy reading&quot;. <br/>
I&#39;d pick out a word in a book DS chose (something common and <br/>
repeated like good or run or dog) and that was &quot;his&quot; word. I&#39;d read <br/>
along until we got to that word, then he&#39;d say his word and we&#39;d <br/>
move on. We moved up gradually to multiple words (2 or 3 in one <br/>
story). Then we&#39;d alternate words, then sentences. If DS got to a <br/>
word that didn&#39;t fit what he already knew, we&#39;d stop and look at it, <br/>
then move on. For example (since it&#39;s hard to explain), he <br/>
knew &quot;water&quot;. Then he got a book on &quot;weather&quot;. Apply what he already <br/>
knew &quot;w&quot;+&quot;at&quot;+&quot;er&quot; but that didn&#39;t fit. So we touched on &quot;ea&quot; <br/>
and &quot;th&quot;. Now he&#39;s got 5 &quot;building blocks&quot; instead of just 3, <br/>
without trying to memorize rules with more exceptions than <br/>
regularities (ah the joys of the English language!lol). One key (I <br/>
think) to this was knowing the letters and sounds and picking up <br/>
basic sight words first to provide a foundation to work from. We <br/>
didn&#39;t use any of the standard &quot;lists of sight words&quot; - just <br/>
whatever words we came across a lot &quot;Exit&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Thank <br/>
you&quot;, &quot;Blue&#39;s Clues&quot; &quot;Go, Dog, Go&quot; and suchlike. <br/>
<br/>
One video that was helpful was Sesame Street&#39;s Do the Alphabet - a <br/>
particularly good part was that the main character (Baby Bear) <br/>
wanted help because he kept forgetting the letters - he&#39;d go A,B,C,D <br/>
and get lost. So Big Bird and the gang helped with letters and <br/>
sounds. And in the end, Baby Bear did it! It helped DS to have <br/>
confidence that he&#39;d eventually get it, didn&#39;t have to have it all <br/>
right away. Admittedly, that might be a little young for your 7 yr <br/>
old. I liked that they used a different tune for the alphabet song <br/>
so it avoided the &quot;lmnop&quot; all as one &quot;letter&quot;.</div>

<br/>
A lot of kids at school aren&#39;t either.<br/>
When I taught 7th grade, only maybe a third of them were REALLY readers, <br/>
another third could read but their comprehension wasn&#39;t so good because (I thought <br/>
at the time, maybe) they were reading in a cloud of resistent frustration, <br/>
and the other third were hesitant readers, afraid of making mistakes if they <br/>
read aloud, unsure of &quot;rules,&quot; avoided reading to themselves because of a wad of <br/>
fears, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not just that unschoolers might not read at six (the boy is six; <br/>
&quot;almost 7&quot; doesn&#39;t change that, &quot;almost 7&quot; or even &quot;just turned 7&quot; is sixish, <br/>
first grade age).  MOST six year olds aren&#39;t reading.  Most of those who&#39;ve been <br/>
told they are reading are only reading &quot;graded readers&quot; which are books with <br/>
carefully chosen words they&#39;ve already seen lots before.  Their other textbooks <br/>
and directions are &quot;written at first grade level&quot; too which means reading <br/>
specialists have looked at sentence length and word length and never used a bigger <br/>
word when a smaller one would do.    <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s an older video that might still be available.  Shari Lewis, 101 <br/>
Things to Do, I think it&#39;s called, and there are some tricky things of all sorts <br/>
mixed in there.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to only do things that are like playing around with words, <br/>
nothing like &quot;reading lessons.&quot;   The same discouraging damage reading classes do <br/>
at school can be done at home.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878820649">When I get worried about my 10 year old not reading yet, I think <br/>
about the variety of reading levels and interests in my family. I <br/>
taught myself to read in Kindergarten (reading wasn&#39;t taught under <br/>
first grade, when I was five). (This ability, btw, torqued my first <br/>
grade teacher, who hated me) And I&#39;ve loved reading ever since. I was <br/>
the kid you see walking down the street with her nose in a book.<br/>
<br/>
My brother was reading by second grade, I&#39;m pretty sure, but he never <br/>
loved it like I did. Favorite books for him were the &quot;...Do the <br/>
Strangest Things&quot; series and the &quot;Meet George Wasington et al&quot; To <br/>
this day, he isn&#39;t a reader of novels. Magazines? I think so.<br/>
<br/>
My sister enjoys reading, and is involved in a book discussion group. <br/>
But I think she reads those books because being in a book group <br/>
is &quot;the thing to do&quot; more than just reading for sheer pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
My mom: a pleasure reader.<br/>
<br/>
My dad: a novel-once-a-year, with Smithsonian level magazines in <br/>
between his Michener binges.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest child, now 24, was in second grade when reading clicked for <br/>
him. He reads when he has to, but isn&#39;t a novel or even a magazine <br/>
reader.<br/>
<br/>
In my own home, I and my 17 year old are the voracious readers. My 12 <br/>
year old boy reads now and then. He is perfectly capable, but reading <br/>
isn&#39;t his main brain stimulus.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, who has dyslexia and has a brain injury, is a slow and <br/>
plodding reader, with many starts and stops. I have no idea if this <br/>
is from the dyslexia or the brain injury. But he is capable of <br/>
reading, and started reading late, according to his mother. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t remember what age he was when he started reading, but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t by age 7. He doesn&#39;t read novels, but gobbles up the Popular <br/>
Science and Pop Mechanics, as well as religious books.<br/>
<br/>
And there&#39;s my 10 year old, who wants to read VERY much, for whom it <br/>
is just not clicking yet. Who has had phonics and sight reading cards <br/>
and many other helps. For whom it STILL is not clicking, yet. I <br/>
suspect hers is a spatial brain, like her dad&#39;s. (aka dyslexia) She <br/>
listens to books on tape, watches videos about things that interest <br/>
her (big cats are her passion. And birds, right now) and I read to <br/>
her sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
The blessing is, she hasn&#39;t had to deal with frustration <br/>
and &quot;failure&quot; in the context of the classroom. She hasn&#39;t had other <br/>
kids giving her grief. Or teachers, for that matter.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<br/>
Karen&#39;s idea of relating it to other activities is a good one, too, <br/>

remembers that. &quot;Remember how much you wanted to ride a 2-wheel bike <br/>

&quot;It can be hard to wait, though, I know.&quot;<br/>

were  ready.  He grew up with that reality.   I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s  why he <br/>
learned at 7 over any other age.  But I  believe that&#39;s  why he never had any <br/>
anxiety about it or frustration that he   couldn&#39;t do it, yet.<br/>

We&#39;ve used this &quot;someday you will&quot; or &quot;you  just don&#39;t yet&quot; about all  kinds <br/>
of things, from reading to caring about the opposite sex to foods.   Holly <br/>
doesn&#39;t like green chile yet.  SHe figures she will (&quot;When my taste  buds die&quot; <br/>
she jokes), because her brothers didn&#39;t used to and now they do.   Kirby lately <br/>
started liking mushrooms.  Marty still doesn&#39;t like spinach  yet, but we <br/>
haven&#39;t branded him &quot;a spinach hater,&quot; and I don&#39;t think anyone  should consider a <br/>
child &quot;a non reader,&quot; just one who &quot;doesn&#39;t read yet.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 11 year old daughter and I played Scrabble last night, and my 7 <br/>
year old watched us for a little while.  She was challenging the <br/>
word &quot;ax&quot; that I made because she thought it was spelled &quot;axe&quot; (she <br/>
looked it up to prove me wrong and found out that it can be spelled <br/>
either way).  But anyway...<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old took her side and said, &quot;Yeah, I think axe just looks <br/>
more like the way it should be spelled.&quot;  He can recognize a few <br/>
words like mom, dad, go, yes, no, and zoo, but he doesn&#39;t read yet.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t seem to be just being silly and taking his sister&#39;s side <br/>
over his mom for fun.  He seemed to be really pondering the way the <br/>
word looked.  <br/>
<br/>
I found it fascinating that a 7 year old who can&#39;t read would ponder <br/>
the spelling of a word and decide which spelling looks best to him. <br/>

<br/>
That is how I decide on a correct spelling.  If I&#39;m not sure, I&#39;ll write the word down with variations until I *see* which one looks right.<br/>
