<div id="ygrps-yiv-136817268">Hi all,<br/>
I really enjoyed reading all of your posts. I though I would share a <br/>
few comments also. My son Joey is 7 and was pulled out of school in <br/>
K. Before he went I bought a program called &quot;Front line phonics&quot; and <br/>
he absolutely HATED it.  So I returned it and thought I&#39;ll leave <br/>
this alone. I also thought maybe the schools would do something I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to (now I know different). I sent him to school and <br/>
they suggested I put him into a thing they call Title one (special <br/>
help) for him to learn his letters because he would forget them. I <br/>
would talk to the Title one teacher and she would say he is doing <br/>
wonderful and he knows this, this and this letter. I would go home <br/>
and ask him and he wouldn&#39;t know. I realized that he just remembered <br/>
them just to shut her up. I of course was devastated because I <br/>
didn&#39;t know about unschooling at the time. Although I didn&#39;t know I <br/>
pulled him out because I couldn&#39;t bear the pain of watching him be <br/>
so unhappy. I decided to give him a break (of course not right away <br/>
lol......) and just read to him. Thankfully I found this group !!!!! <br/>
I even let him have his video games he&#39;s always wanted and I find <br/>
that he knows a lot of big words and he can listen to very long <br/>
stories and loves them !! He can understand and comprhend many <br/>
things that doesn&#39;t require reading. He has started asking me what <br/>
certain words say. I am totally relaxed now. I see he has the desire <br/>
to learn in his OWN way and that is fine for me. I see HIS progress <br/>
and have let go of my own ideas of how it should be mastered. He <br/>
begs me to read to him at night and hates me to point my finger <br/>
LOL................ He use to feel ashamed that he couldn&#39;t read and <br/>
I assured him that he is fine and will learn in his own way on his <br/>
own time and he is fine now. He always proudly says I can&#39;t read <br/>
tell me what that says - but I can see the wheels turning and I do <br/>
see that he understands small words but desn&#39;t think he is reading <br/>
because he cannot pick up a book or a note like I can and fluently <br/>
read. I have two stepsons who live with their mother who go to <br/>
public school. I can totally understand what you ment by the SOLID <br/>
foundation because they are not fluent but they are required to do a <br/>
book report - WHAT IS THAT ALL ABOUT ?????? Also my oldest who is 15 <br/>
HATES to read and I feel badly.  Anyway, back to my little Joey he <br/>
is also missing 4 teeth in the front and cannot pronounce certain <br/>
words and I think it is so cute !! They of course had him in speech <br/>
therapy. His fornt teeth peeking through(peeing LOl....) and I&#39;m <br/>
excitied and sad that my little boy is growong up reading and <br/>
speaking correctly now .......................................... <br/>
sigh :)<br/>
