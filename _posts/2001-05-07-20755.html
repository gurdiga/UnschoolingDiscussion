I can&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think of a situation in<br/>
&gt; which carrying my child would not &quot;hold him&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your child was not my child.  And you were not me. <br/>
<br/>
But if you use your imagination, I think you *can*<br/>
think of just such a situation.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which you are recovering from<br/>
cancer which you avoided treating for seven months,<br/>
against doctor&#39;s recommendations,  because you wanted<br/>
to give your baby the best chance possible rather than<br/>
aborting him.  Imagine that after he was born he was<br/>
the most beautiful thing you&#39;d ever seen, that you<br/>
loved him with all of your heart... and that twenty<br/>
minutes later his heart stopped beating and he stopped<br/>
breathing, and that the doctors rushed in and snatched<br/>
him from your arms, and that for nearly an hour you<br/>
thought he was dead.<br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which your child&#39;s immune<br/>
system was not normal, so that he could not be cared<br/>
for by someone else or go to a public place without<br/>
fear that he would be killed or damaged by a simple<br/>
cold or flu virus.  Imagine he had seizures, so that<br/>
you had to watch him and worry about him all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that his blood sugar would not regulate, that<br/>
you had to poke him with needles to check his blood<br/>
every two hours until his tiny toes were like<br/>
pincushions.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which you have degenerative<br/>
spinal discs and &#39;benign tremors&#39; (think of<br/>
Parkinsons, except that the weakness and tremors<br/>
happen when you are trying to use your muscles rather<br/>
than when you are at rest); imagine that these<br/>
conditions existed relatively unnoticed and<br/>
undiagnosed until the trauma of your pregnancy,<br/>
cancer, and the birth of your child started a chain<br/>
reaction that severely worsened the symptoms.  Imagine<br/>
that you had watched your grandfather become entirely<br/>
crippled, unable to even feed himself, with this same<br/>
condition, and that now your doctors told you that<br/>
this was a likely fate for you sometime in your<br/>
future.  Imagine that you had been an artist, but now<br/>
were unable to control your hands enough to do your<br/>
work.  Imagine you were dealing with this change in<br/>
your life at the same time that you are dealing with<br/>
all these other things.<br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which your husband was working<br/>
two full time jobs in order to pay for your and your<br/>
child&#39;s medical bills, so that you are acting in<br/>
effect as a single mom.  Think of living with the<br/>
knowledge that one more serious illness on either of<br/>
your parts would leave you homeless.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which your life seemed to be<br/>
just one long round of doctor visits, and that the<br/>
doctors couldn&#39;t tell you if your child would ever<br/>
love you, or talk, or look at your face, or sit on<br/>
your lap without struggling and screaming.  Imagine<br/>
that in the scant moments during which your son slept,<br/>
you spent every waking moment searching for something<br/>
to help him.  Think of finding something after two<br/>
years of searching, and doing it even though your<br/>
toddler screamed as though he were being boiled alive<br/>
for the entire duration of each treatment, and the<br/>
doctors told you that it wasn&#39;t likely do any good at<br/>
all; imagine that it was agonizingly painful to you<br/>
and left you with crippling chronic back pain and more<br/>
damaged discs.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which you felt horrendously<br/>
guilty the whole time you were applying this<br/>
treatment, because your child so obviously felt that<br/>
you were torturing him for no reason, and you weren&#39;t<br/>
so sure he wasn&#39;t right.  Imagine that the horrible<br/>
thing you were doing primarily consisted of simply<br/>
holding him in your arms (with a little eye contact<br/>
thrown in for good measure)... and that he would<br/>
scream and struggle like a trapped animal for two<br/>
hours straight, so long and hard that he would fall<br/>
asleep every twenty minutes or so, and then wake up<br/>
screaming again... Imagine that for a stretch of time<br/>
(seems like forever) you did this for several hours a<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Think of a situation in which those conditions might<br/>
conspire to make it difficult to always perfectly hold<br/>
on to a wildly struggling and fast-moving child,<br/>
especially while also trying to walk across a crowded<br/>
clinic parking lot. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to think of it.  I lived it.  My son and<br/>
husband lived it.  Our extended family lived it.  We<br/>
still live much of it, to some degree or other.  But<br/>
some things are now much, much better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had enough drama to last a lifetime.  I&#39;ve<br/>
learned to stop making decisions based on what &#39;most<br/>
people&#39; think... most people thought my child would<br/>
never be capable of demonstrative affection, or<br/>
&#39;normal&#39; mental functioning.  He&#39;s not *average*, but<br/>
he is the most affectionate, demonstrative,<br/>
sweet-tempered, sensitive eleven year old male I have<br/>
ever met.  He has trouble interpreting people&#39;s<br/>
expressions and body language, and some social cues...<br/>
but he helps others who are in trouble, is generous,<br/>
and is a gifted writer.  He is the light of my life. <br/>
And he is extremely demonstrative, even in public,<br/>
with his old mom.  He knows it isn&#39;t Cool.  He doesn&#39;t<br/>
care.  The people who have known him from birth know<br/>
he&#39;s a miracle.<br/>
<br/>
So does he.<br/>

    Thank you for sharing your story. After reading this, I am convinced<br/>
that you have more courage than most people I have ever met. Please stay<br/>
here. Your perspective is different than mine, because you are you.  You<br/>
and your son are miracles. I  appreciate  and respect your comments very<br/>
much.<br/>

People like you always really help me with my life.  I am so in awe of people<br/>
who can turn hardship into positive.  I am very bad at that, but try hard to<br/>
do it.<br/>
A positive attitude is EVERYTHING!  Thanks for reminding me once again.<br/>
Your son is very lucky, as probably you are too....<br/>
Thanks for sharing.<br/>
