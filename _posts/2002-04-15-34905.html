<div id="ygrps-yiv-908020824">&lt;&lt;super-saturation of interesting things to do&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our lives ARE super-saturated with interesting things.  I don&#39;t remember the<br/>
last time I was bored and my kids have rarely mentioned it since they left<br/>
school.  Sometimes I suggest things, sometimes the kids do.  Sometimes we<br/>
aren&#39;t doing much of anything, watching the stars, watching a movie, hanging<br/>
out (today I&#39;m doing laundry, one kid is napping, 2 are playing their own<br/>
creation of a game, 2 are watching &quot;gunsmoke&quot;)...but we almost always find<br/>
the world fascinating.  We talk about how things fit together and are<br/>
connected.  We are broadening each others horizons.<br/>
<br/>
That is what I thought being an unschooler meant......<br/>

unschooling t-shirt slogan or a bumper sticker, to me &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
