<div id="ygrps-yiv-345783964">Did someone mention they were looking for soy nut butter? I use the I.M.<br/>
Healthy brand; I used to mail order it from Whole Foods online, but they<br/>
have recently merged with another site and I can&#39;t seem to order it. I am<br/>
still looking for another place to get it. It does have other ingredients<br/>
besides soy nuts (sucanat-cane juice, naturally pressed soybean oil, salt)<br/>
that give it a sweeter flavor and better texture. So if you are looking for<br/>
just plain soy nut butter, this is not the one. I hope this wasn&#39;t the<br/>
brand that you tried already but didn&#39;t like. <br/>
