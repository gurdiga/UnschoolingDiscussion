&lt;&lt; To me, the really wonderful thing about hsing, is I get to enjoy my dd <br/>
 every day - I&#39;m not missing out on half her life due to school and homework. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amen!!!  My 11 year old loves to be read to also; I enjoy it, until my voice <br/>
gives out.  We are reading in the 4th volume of Joy Hakim&#39;s History of US, <br/>
and I often read to both my 11 and 6 year old.  My oldest loves Harry Potter <br/>
as well.  We seem to end up in the used book section of Barnes & Noble at <br/>
least once a week!<br/>
