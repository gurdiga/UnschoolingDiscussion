<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079279707"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Take two house <br/>
 </span></blockquote>painters. One does the job you do not want to do: You pick the colors <br/>
and make all the decisions; he provides the labor. The other comes into <br/>
your home, looks at your overall scheme, makes suggestions, talks about <br/>
color combinations and textures; will even go with you to the store to <br/>
pick out the product or even mix the colors himself. Both are house <br/>
painters, which one is the creative one?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, my dad had a &quot;good&quot; job in the steel mill that his father retired from and where everyone expected him to work his entire career.  He hated it.  He&#39;d always wanted to be an artist.  So he just up and quit a &quot;secure&quot; job and opened his own business painting houses.  The year I was born, he made $600.  Total.  But each year he had more and more business, and in the evenings/weekends he was doing what he really loved: art.  <br/>
 <br/>
After years of improving as an artist, he started getting the courage to make suggestions to his customers: a steel door painted to look like wood, a mural on the wall, an old table top painted like marble, etc.  He started building a portfolio of that kind of work and learning new techniques.  He learned how to build fireplaces cheaply from a special light-weight blend of concrete and paint it to look like whatever kind of stone the family wants.  He&#39;s experimenting with scuplture.  <br/>
 <br/>
Now the steel mills in his town are all but shut down, and a lot of people are doing do-it-yourself jobs around their homes rather than hiring painters.  But it hasn&#39;t affected his career because of his new skills.  People fly him in from other parts of the country to do murals and custom paint jobs in their homes.  He hasn&#39;t been hired to &quot;just&quot; paint a room in years.  It didn&#39;t happen overnight, but he is doing what he loves now and getting paid for it.  If he&#39;d done what his father wanted, what his father firmly believed would lead to a good life, he&#39;d be another of the thousands of laid-off steel workers in my hometown.<br/>
