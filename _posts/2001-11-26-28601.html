  Hi Christine,<br/>

  Can you briefly mention your 2 new subjects?  I&#39;ll try to respond if I <br/>
  can.  There are so many posts on this list that I simply don&#39;t have the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540199479">I dont have any direct experience with kids attending a college class or<br/>
two, but Ive often thought that sign language would be a great choice for<br/>
older kids to study at a community college.<br/>
<br/>
I took a short (three session) course in sign language at the local public<br/>
library. My son came along  he was just learning to stand up at the time,<br/>
and we had been doing baby signs at home  and he was very welcome. There<br/>
were three or four teens in the class, and the others were adults.<br/>
<br/>
Sign language is the sort of thing that, since it is so new to most of us<br/>
and since it relies much less on traditional academic skills than other<br/>
courses, can sometimes level the playing field for kids who are not<br/>
necessarily at college level in other areas. Some of the kids were a lot<br/>
faster at picking things up than some of us adults were.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what policies colleges might have about these courses  maybe<br/>
it would be easier to access them if theyre non-credit, adult education<br/>
or community courses held at the college.<br/>
<br/>
One warning about sign, though  there seem to be a lot of colleges and<br/>
other institutions hiring non-native signers to teach these courses. Thats<br/>
not necessarily bad, but it might be. Unless the person is Deaf or very<br/>
involved in the Deaf community (child of a Deaf adult, very experienced<br/>
interpreter, etc.), what you might get is a teacher who has basically<br/>
memorized a bunch of signs and has no idea how to string them together. That<br/>
s like memorizing the dictionary for a spoken language, never having heard<br/>
it and having not a clue as to sentence structure. So ask a lot of questions<br/>
about the teacher before you sign up.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is whether the child in question is likely to be<br/>
good at sign. Some people are more visually oriented and have better<br/>
coordination. I have trouble with both of these areas, but since Ive<br/>
already had a lot of experience in various educational settings, and am<br/>
aware of the hidden classroom dynamics (initially through John Holts<br/>
books), I didnt let the fact that I was kind of slow to catch on bother me<br/>
too much. Its pretty evident when youre making mistakes in sign (as<br/>
opposed to in some written exercise), so you wouldnt want a kid to feel so<br/>
much on the spot that he or she missed having any fun and decided that all<br/>
classroom learning is by definition horrible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340296801">Mine have not attended classes on their own yet but they did accompany me<br/>
to one of mine so they know what to expect.  Rachel is looking into the<br/>
college thing right now.  She will either start in Jan or Sept of 2002. <br/>
I have a friend whose son started post secondary at Kent State this year<br/>
and he is doing fine.  The regulations vary by state and by college. <br/>
Ohio has a program (post secondary) where high school age kids can go to<br/>
college for free.  They get credit both in High School and College for<br/>
the classes.  Homeschoolers who are using an umbrella school can do this<br/>
too.  We may sign up with Clonlara so we can use this option.<br/>
To be admitted as a regular student at the school she wants to attend<br/>
Rachel will need to pass the GED test.  As I said we are still in the<br/>
reasearch phase of this but I am hoping she can get away without it.  But<br/>

  Mine have not attended classes on their own yet but they did accompany me<br/>
  to one of mine so they know what to expect.  Rachel is looking into the<br/>
  college thing right now.  She will either start in Jan or Sept of 2002. <br/>
  I have a friend whose son started post secondary at Kent State this year<br/>
  and he is doing fine.  The regulations vary by state and by college. <br/>
  Ohio has a program (post secondary) where high school age kids can go to<br/>
  college for free.  They get credit both in High School and College for<br/>
  the classes.  Homeschoolers who are using an umbrella school can do this<br/>
  too.  We may sign up with Clonlara so we can use this option.<br/>
  To be admitted as a regular student at the school she wants to attend<br/>
  Rachel will need to pass the GED test.  As I said we are still in the<br/>
  reasearch phase of this but I am hoping she can get away without it.  But<br/>
  then that is my bias not hers so I won&#39;t balk if she wants to take it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In Ohio to use the program that lets you take classes for free you have<br/>
to be &quot;enrolled&quot; somewhere.  At least that&#39;s what I have been told so<br/>
far.  We are still researching though - looking for that loophole to slip<br/>
through.<br/>

has helped her learn to converse with almost anyone.<br/>
