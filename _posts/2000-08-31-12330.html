<div>In our house, I never tried to force my girls to eat anything, I think that 
is why my DH and I are overweight to this day!&nbsp; Our parents used to make us 
clean our plates!&nbsp; Our rule for our kids was that they at least had to 
taste everything on their plate and if they didn&#39;t like it, then they didn&#39;t 
have to eat it!&nbsp; A lot of times they found that they liked something, or 
not.&nbsp; My youngest was a very picky eater and didn&#39;t like textures of food 
for some reason.&nbsp; So I would let her eat bland textured foods like macaroni 
and cheese and spaghetti and applesauce or other soft fruits or foods.&nbsp; She 
is an adventurous eater now!&nbsp; Another thing that helped my daughter to eat 
was to involve her in the preparation of dinner.&nbsp; If she felt like she made 
it, she was more apt to eat it(sometimes, not always!) &nbsp; Just giving them a 
choice helps them&nbsp;feel like their in control of their environment and their 
bodies.</div>
