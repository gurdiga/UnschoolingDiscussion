<div id="ygrps-yiv-298465639">I have been thinking a lot about this lately, and I<br/>
wrote a day-in-the-life kind of post about it last<br/>
week, but I guess that wasn&#39;t enough because I keep<br/>
thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
We live on a half acre...not huge, but private and<br/>
across the street from the river.  We have lots of<br/>
birds, the occasional pheasant, raccoon, or owl.  We<br/>
have a good garden, an old house and lots of time.<br/>
<br/>
Before kids, I was a homebody... a reader, crafter,<br/>
movie-watcher kinda gal. But Sophia is a go-er...very<br/>
social and active and wanting to be involved and<br/>
playing a lot of the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Up until lately, we&#39;ve been really busy.  We do things<br/>
the girls enjoy.  Going here and there, yonder and<br/>
yon... show my kids *more*, eat out *more*, buy<br/>
*more*. More smells, more tastes, more sights, more<br/>
sounds.  (Aren&#39;t we Zen:)?)<br/>
<br/>
Turns out, we&#39;re all really happy staying home lately.<br/>
 We&#39;re enjoying our yard, cold as it&#39;s been.  And we<br/>
are really enjoying re-watching movies we&#39;ve already<br/>
seen, playing computer games and board games we<br/>
haven&#39;t played in awhile, listening to books on tape,<br/>
making lots of messes, cooking and rearranging<br/>
furniture.  I&#39;m emailing to touch base with a<br/>
community I don&#39;t have IRL, and my girls are playing<br/>
with each other a lot.  And arguing a little.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re getting great snail mail lately--magazines and<br/>
books and birthday presents and craft kits and posters<br/>
and Florida shells.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some fun visitors and some visitors we could<br/>
have done without.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re reading the paper every day to find a doggie<br/>
companion for our 10 year old wolf-lab cross.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re watching the wild cat family when we don&#39;t scare<br/>
them away.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re finding new songs for the iPod. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re playing guitar and recorder and drums and<br/>
singing and making up songs.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re calling old friends on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re counting down the days to a birthday.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been following obscure Internet links.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re having food delivered instead of going out.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re finding things on eBay that are interesting and<br/>
having them delivered.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re doing some of the craft projects from our *many*<br/>
craft books.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re knitting and making wrapping paper.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re figuring out ways to make no-sew doll clothes<br/>
for American Girls and creating hair salons for the<br/>
plethora of dolls at our house.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re really busy and engaged and learning and we&#39;re<br/>
sticking really close to home.<br/>
<br/>
This is huge for me.  &quot;Mom,&quot;  Sophia said, with a big<br/>
smile, &quot;Lets stay home for a whole year!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been a little more relaxed.   We&#39;re getting to<br/>
know each other a little better because we&#39;re getting<br/>
to know ourselves better because we&#39;re thinking a bit<br/>
more because we have time because we&#39;re not rushing<br/>
around because we&#39;re staying home and we&#39;re still<br/>
learning and happy and engaged.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have resources here to last a<br/>
while...remnants of over-strewing and over-yard<br/>
sale-ing, Christmas leftovers and oldie-goldies.<br/>
<br/>
But, part of the reason we&#39;ve been home is an injury,<br/>
then a sickness.  We&#39;re healed, for the most part. <br/>
And the requests to go have started coming again.  The<br/>
girls like to be active, too.  So Sophia is sleeping<br/>
over at Grandma&#39;s tonight, then gymnastics tomorrow,<br/>
and girls club and ceramics on Tuesday. Eva&#39;s got<br/>
dance which she loves, then the hot springs on<br/>
Thursday because they really want to go swimming,<br/>
Friday play date and a Saturday birthday with a<br/>
sleepover in a different town and the yurt on Sunday<br/>
and skiing on Monday...and I&#39;m a little sad that our<br/>
cocoon time is ending and a little glad to get fresh<br/>
air.  I think we&#39;ll remember, though, that we don&#39;t<br/>
*have* to keep busy outside of the house, our own<br/>
house is full of learning and fun!<br/>
<br/>
And when the next ebb comes, we&#39;ll be ready.<br/>

I needed to remember that. We have just left our large<br/>
social circle and moved back to our house in the<br/>
country. There are tons of things here to do, but my<br/>
fear is about making the kids world big enough. This<br/>
is the first time we have lived here as radical<br/>
unschoolers. I needed to look at your list and nod and<br/>
remember the joy that comes in making those<br/>
connnections at home, with the world we have created<br/>
around us.<br/>
