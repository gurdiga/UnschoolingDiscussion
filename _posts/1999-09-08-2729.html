<div id="ygrps-yiv-214497150"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Now, I sure didn&#39;t join this list to get into a big hairy argument and<br/>
&gt;pollute the listwaves with it, but I will respond to publicly made<br/>
&gt;innuendos.  My sincere apologies to all.  I will not address these<br/>
&gt;issues again.  Any further differings with how I do things regarding<br/>
&gt;unschooling I will post with individuals personally, regardless of where<br/>
&gt;they post their comments.  I thank the list participants and moderators<br/>
&gt;for being so gracious, and again, I apoligize for creating an entry that<br/>
&gt;made so many waves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely and with Love<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wish we could all just &quot;cool it&quot; also.  I enjoy everyone&#39;s friendship and<br/>
input here, and I don&#39;t like to argue.  We are here to share ideas, what<br/>
would be the point of sharing ideas if we all had exactly the same ideas?<br/>
Anyway, I can understand DJ&#39;s defensiveness, because picking apart<br/>
someone&#39;s message and interjecting arguments and counterpoints for each<br/>
point can look very much like agressive judgement.  However, I also,<br/>
knowing this list, do not think that argument or judgement were MEANT by<br/>
it.  I can just see how someone unfamiliar with the list community here<br/>
would feel attacked after getting this message right off the bat, I know I<br/>
would!  Anyway, I think it was a misunderstanding, and can we all KISS and<br/>
MAKE UP now?  Here, I&#39;ll start...<br/>
