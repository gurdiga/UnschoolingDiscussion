<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637496211">Hi Nanci - <br/>
My family and I have looked into co-housing in the past and actually<br/>
seriously visited one. We didn&#39;t end up joining that particular one, and<br/>
like you haven&#39;t found one yet that really excites us... We actually got a<br/>
little discouraged and quit. It is still something that we would like to<br/>
explore, and finding the right group would be very excited to participate<br/>
in. The time frame sounds right - I&#39;d love to &#39;listen in&#39; on your group and<br/>
see who and what&#39;s cookin&#39;!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Subject: Intentional Community (WA)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For anyone interested, we are investigating the possibility of<br/>
&gt; Cohousing, or a similar such ecovilliage community, in NW Washington<br/>
&gt; most likely.  We are looking into existing communities, and thinking<br/>
&gt; over beginning putting together our own, should we not be able to<br/>
&gt; find what we are looking for.  We will be moving up there in the next<br/>
&gt; several years, with the time frame depending on what we eventually<br/>
&gt; decide to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right now we own our home in SE Idaho, and would not be able to<br/>
&gt; liquidate that for at least a year.  We do not want to rent, as we<br/>
&gt; consider that a waste of money, but may have to out of necessity,<br/>
&gt; until we get settled on land for our more permanent home.  Our<br/>
&gt; primary consideration right now is to get over there (to NW WA) so<br/>
&gt; that we can be local to investigate properties and opportunities,<br/>
&gt; and begin forming relationships with prospective community members.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are not looking to create an exclusive or exclusionary community,<br/>
&gt; and are not limiting based on race, sex, sexual orientation,<br/>
&gt; religion, age, physical condition, etc.  We will however, be looking<br/>
&gt; for mentally sound members who can contribute to the greater good of<br/>
&gt; the community  We are looking more for folks with a general attitude<br/>
&gt; of earth stewardship and openmindedness who can enrich and diversify<br/>
&gt; a community living lightly on the land, in individual family homes<br/>
&gt; around shared common space, gardens, land and group facilities.  One<br/>
&gt; group facility would be a group house, with space for optional shared<br/>
&gt; meals, socializing, child care, entertainment, laundry, projects,<br/>
&gt; crafts, meetings, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone with interest and or/experience in this area is welcome to<br/>
&gt; contact us privately and offer advice, encouragement, ideas, etc.  I<br/>
&gt; have begun an email group for sharing on this topic, limited to<br/>
&gt; serious prospective community members, as well as those with<br/>
&gt; experience in community living, sustainable living and related<br/>
&gt; issues, from whom we can all learn.  Contact me if you are interested<br/>
&gt; in discussing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
