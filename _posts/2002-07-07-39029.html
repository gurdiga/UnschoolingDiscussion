<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If unschooling is a lifestyle that is meant to counter the <br/>

&gt; will define our new lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother (who is 72 and has been a classroom teacher forever) wants me to <br/>
say we use an &quot;unschooling curriculum&quot; and it drives her crazy when I say we <br/>
don&#39;t use any curriculum. She thinks it sounds like we &quot;don&#39;t do anything.&quot; <br/>
She doesn&#39;t like me to say &quot;I don&#39;t teach&quot; the kids, either.  I think it is <br/>
important to say it because it is what makes unschooling different than <br/>
schooling. It is HARD for people to change the way they think about learning <br/>
and it is EASIER if we are really really clear and precise in the language we <br/>
use to talk about what we do (or don&#39;t do).<br/>
<br/>
This whole discussion makes me think about Linda Dobson talking about how she <br/>
took her little boy to the pharmacy with her - he&#39;s grown up now and that was <br/>
way back when homeschooling was unheard of and she was worried about him <br/>
being out during school hours. A nice older woman asked him, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you <br/>
in school today?&quot; He answered gleefully, but to his mother&#39;s great dismay, <br/>
&quot;My mom learns me at home!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got the third degree from some visitors we have from out of town - old <br/>
school chums of my husband&#39;s, mostly the husband. He&#39;d apparently decided we <br/>
must be doing this because there is something wrong with the kids, but then <br/>
he MET them and couldn&#39;t reconcile the reality with his expectation that they <br/>
were &quot;slow&quot; or something &lt;G&gt;. After about 2 hours of grilling and him shaking <br/>
his head and basically not believing me that they &quot;just learn because that&#39;s <br/>
what they do&quot;, I got tired of it and resorted to spouting numbers at him -- <br/>
how homeschoolers test in the 80th percentile, etc. It was the wimpy way out <br/>
- but I could tell that THAT would shut him up and that&#39;s all I cared about <br/>
by that time &lt;G&gt;. He liked the idea of homeschooling - thinks the schools are <br/>
WAY too lenient and don&#39;t ask enough of the kids - ought to be much more <br/>
rigorously demanding academically and discipline the kids much more harshly.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time talking about math with his 12 yo - he is in the gifted <br/>
math program at his middle school. He was the absolute EPITOME of what I <br/>
expect from accelerated math programs - he had absolutely no ability to do <br/>
anything with any of the math techniques he had memorized. He could work <br/>
problems if they were given to him in the usual textbook out-of-context <br/>
format - but couldn&#39;t hold a conversation about them or follow what I was <br/>
doing if I used them to explain something. For example, I drew a graph <br/>
relating the price of skateboards and the number of skateboards sold by a <br/>
skate shop and he was confused because I hadn&#39;t used X and Y to label the <br/>
axes of the graph. When I explained and he got it he said, &quot;So this is sort <br/>
of like a line graph right?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, it IS a line graph,&quot; and he said, <br/>
&quot;I know how to do that, you find the slope.&quot; As if that was the point of it. <br/>
Absolutely no comprehension of any meaning of what he was doing. Zero.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I doubt it, really. Unless someone doesn&#39;t speak the language well enough to <br/>
say what they mean, then what they say means something &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If you talk about teaching your children or your children teaching <br/>
themselves, there is still that concept of someone having something done to <br/>
them or doing something to themselves. It shows that you&#39;re thinking of <br/>
learning as something &quot;done to&quot; someone. That&#39;s different than thinking of <br/>
learning as something that someone does. It is a small little word change, <br/>
&quot;done to&quot; as opposed to &quot;does.&quot;  But it signifies a different perspective. <br/>
Sandra&#39;s point is that it is helpful to unschooling parents to try to think <br/>
of learning as something we all just do - not &quot;to&quot; ourselves or someone else. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could try reserving &quot;they teach themselves&quot; for times when they <br/>
purposely set out to systematically learn something. I bought a book and <br/>
purposely learned guitar chords - you could say I taught myself guitar. But <br/>
MOST of what kids are learning isn&#39;t that kind of purposeful systematic <br/>
self-education and to refer to it as them &quot;teaching&quot; themselves makes me <br/>
think that that is what they&#39;re doing.  <br/>
