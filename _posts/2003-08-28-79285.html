cool, completely entertained by my kids and very helpful.  We got the books for <br/>
first grade (to appease them, not to use in the manner intended &lt;g&gt;) and the <br/>
woman gave Hayden the kindergarten handwriting workbook.  He&#39;s the writer, so <br/>
he was very excited!  <br/>
<br/>
Last year, the *late* registrants were pressured about putting their kids in <br/>
school until the next schoolboard meeting.  Luckily, my kids are vaccine-free <br/>
so they don&#39;t want them there anyway &lt;bg&gt; (I&#39;m in Rapid City, SD ~ btw)<br/>
<br/>
I decided to go ahead and register her because we are required to volunteer <br/>
as part of receiving HUD money for housing ~ if the kid is registered, my <br/>
homeschooling counts as volunteer hours!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the warning, I&#39;ll let ya know how things develop from here :)  <br/>

Good.  I didn&#39;t mean that I thought the school district would chose to <br/>
be rude to you because of your marital status, just that I was extra <br/>
nervous for you when you said you were tempted to stay underground.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a form of classic bully behavior that leads some school <br/>
administrators to prefer to pick on poor families and single-parent <br/>
families.  (Like a predator looking for the slowest gazelle.)  But I <br/>
think we&#39;re all stronger if we have a big &quot;herd&quot; of homeschoolers around <br/>
us to scare them away.  Being connected to each other on the internet is <br/>
a great way for all of us to increase our perceived &quot;size&quot; and power.<br/>
