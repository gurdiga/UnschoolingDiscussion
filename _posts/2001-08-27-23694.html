  ANSWERS:<br/>
<br/>
  1. The man is very, very short and can only reach halfway up the elevator<br/>
  buttons. However, if it is raining then he will have his umbrella with him<br/>
  and can press the higher buttons with it.<br/>
<br/>
  2. The surgeon was his mother.<br/>
<br/>
  3. It was day time.<br/>
<br/>
  4. At the time she went into labor, the mother of the twins was traveling<br/>
  by boat. The older twin, Terry, was born first early on March 1st. The<br/>
boat<br/>
  then crossed a time zone and Kerry, the younger twin, was born on February<br/>
  the 28th. Therefore, the younger twin celebrates her birthday two days<br/>
  before her older brother.<br/>
<br/>
  5. A square manhole cover can be turned and dropped down the diagonal of<br/>
  the manhole. A round manhole cannot be dropped down the manhole. So for<br/>
  safety and practicality, all manhole covers should be round.<br/>
<br/>
  6. The poison in the punch came from the ice cubes. When the man drank the<br/>
  punch, the ice was fully frozen. Gradually it melted, poisoning the punch.<br/>
<br/>
  7. He recognized Adam and Eve as the only people without navels. Because<br/>
  they were not born of women, they had never had umbilical cords and<br/>
  therefore they never had navels. This one seems perfectly logical but it<br/>
  can sometimes spark fierce theological arguments.<br/>
<br/>
  8. They were two of a set of triplets (or quadruplets, etc.). This puzzle<br/>
  stumps many people. They try outlandish solutions involving test-tube<br/>
  babies or surrogate mothers. Why does the brain search for complex<br/>
  solutions when there is a much simpler one available?<br/>
<br/>
  9. The man had hiccups. The barman recognized this from his speech and<br/>
drew   the gun in order to give him a shock. It worked and cured the<br/>
hiccups-so the man no longer needed the water.</div>
