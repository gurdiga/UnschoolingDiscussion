 </span></blockquote>Dear Laraine --  there are other approaches between giving out<br/>
assignments and completely butting out (sometimes I hear this called<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot;, but I think it can be more broadly defined as approaches<br/>
which do not resemble school -- actually, I hate to be defined by what<br/>
my approach is not!)  Now, my two never attended school, so am no expert<br/>
on the &quot;deschooling process&quot;.  But it is possible for a child after, say<br/>
8 (sometimes earlier, sometimes later), to define what it is she wants<br/>
to learn about (in the big picture), and have you help structure a day,<br/>
month, year, which will help her achieve her own learning goals.  The<br/>
trick is not falling for just making &quot;assignments&quot;, but working with<br/>
your kids and listening hard to see where it is they really want to go.<br/>
You then become the &quot;learning facilitator&quot;, not the taskmaster, and, if<br/>
it works for you and and your daughter, you can &quot;contract&quot; together for<br/>
what it is you provide, and what is expected from her.<br/>
<br/>
So I encourage you to think &quot;outside the box&quot; (school or &quot;unschooling&quot;)<br/>
-- there are as many ways to go as there are children and families.<br/>

If my youngest son (now 9) hadn&#39;t been born at home, and didn&#39;t look just like<br/>
the others, I would have been accusing the hospital of swapping babies! He has<br/>
always loved structure, and I hate it, and my three older children are like me.<br/>
I kept thinking he would grow out of it. The other day he organised his father<br/>
into sitting down at the computer and showing him how to use Microsoft Projects<br/>
so that he could work out a schedule to last him through to the end of the<br/>
year, and planned days for math etc. in among all our other activities.... I<br/>
have to point out that here in New Zealand, it isn&#39;t just Christmas that&#39;s<br/>
coming, but this is the last week of school, for those poor unfortunates who<br/>
attend such institutions, the last week of all sorts of things for us - music,<br/>
gym etc, prior to our summer holidays! But ds has scheduled maths etc. all the<br/>
way through Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s always done such stuff all the time (like waking me up at 6.30am on a<br/>
Sunday for help with math problems) but now he wants it scheduled so he knows<br/>
just what he has to do (his &#39;has-to&#39;, not mine) and so he can check it off on<br/>
his chart as he does it! But, hey, if that&#39;s his way why not? As long as he<br/>
doesn&#39;t expect me to do it too &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s gradually learning that the rest of us<br/>
are naturally disoganised and is slowly stopping getting cross. He organises<br/>
the cutlery drawer several times a week, and finally agreed that we could put<br/>
the clean cutlery on the bench and he would put it away - before that, everyone<br/>
got growled at for not putting it away carefully enough.<br/>
<br/>
And I am finally accepting that his way is okay too - it&#39;s okay for him to<br/>
structure his life, and really, it&#39;s okay for us to help him if he asks.<br/>
Sometimes it really is what they want, and sometimes they need help to learn<br/>
the skills of organising and structuring. I have come to realise that structure<br/>
and unschooling aren&#39;t necessarily at odds - as long as the structure isn&#39;t<br/>
imposed. Your kid who has been in ps may be the same sort of kid as my little<br/>
boy (who tried school for 5 weeks at his own request), but the skills don&#39;t<br/>
always come naturally, and may need to be learnt, just like other skills.<br/>

	If my dd asked for this, my first assignment for her would be: make a<br/>
list of what you want to learn, and how you want to learn it.  Second<br/>
assignment would be: now, take that first list and make yourself a<br/>
schedule. &lt;BWEG&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And this is just what we did one year, when my 11 year old wanted to feel<br/>
more in control of what she was doing.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, working in all my different online persona&#39;s, I wish I had a<br/>
nickel for every 11-12 year old girl who wanted to add structure to her day.<br/>
I could afford a retreat weekend.<br/>
<br/>
This is a time of great upheaval on the inside, many people need their<br/>
outside to be predictable.  Those hormones sure aren&#39;t.  Shay&#39;s right, ask<br/>
her for all the input and help her devise a plan that will work for her Warn<br/>
her that schedules like this have to be adjusted every so often, what she<br/>
creates today will not work come next June.  At  some point they begin to<br/>
feel in control again and the need to write this down and stick to it goes<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Have to go play Uno now!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t as bad as you might think, depending on how you approach it. :)<br/>
<br/>
If my kids come to me and say, &quot;I want you to force me to do a set amount of<br/>
work every day and you pick it&quot; I&#39;m going to say, &quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But if they want me to sit down with them and help them find activities and<br/>
acquire things to do and teach them to schedule their time and explore the<br/>
things that might be of interest to them - well, great! :) No problem.<br/>
<br/>
So the situation might look like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay, Hortensia, if I have it right you&#39;d like to spend the next month<br/>
learning about butterflies and rock stars of the 70&#39;s. Now, here are the<br/>
cool resources we&#39;ve found together and here is a tight schedule for you to<br/>
follow, as per your request and what we&#39;ve discussed. From 8:00 to 9:00<br/>
every morning you wish to study Rod Stewart, from 9:00 to 10:00 you wish to<br/>
study monarch butterflies. Here&#39;s the schedule, all written up in<br/>
triplicate. Shall we put one on the refrigerator? Do you know how your alarm<br/>
clock works? Super!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s it. If *she* then chooses to maintain her schedule, change it,<br/>
expand upon it, or hit the alarm clock the first day and say to herself,<br/>
&quot;Nah!&quot;, that&#39;s up to HER.<br/>
<br/>
So it isn&#39;t really the asking for structure or &quot;schoolwork&quot; -- it&#39;s whether<br/>
she&#39;s asking you to force her to do it, and whether you apply that force.<br/>
That&#39;s where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. That&#39;s the part that<br/>
damages.<br/>
<br/>
She also may just want more of your time. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
