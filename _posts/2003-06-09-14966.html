Guess what I did!  Pam Hartley usually handles these things but she&#39;s not <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the site and set it so she can&#39;t post, but she&#39;ll get individual <br/>
e-mails.  So maybe she didn&#39;t keep that e-mail address, but if she did she&#39;ll <br/>
have to unsubscribe after she feels spammed by some homeschooling mail.<br/>

Too bad Yahoo sends confirmation letters now.  (Well, not really too bad,<br/>
but it would be nice to give them a taste of their own medicine.<br/>
