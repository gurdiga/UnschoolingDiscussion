&quot;Anyone who can&#39;t show social workers or relatives what they&#39;ve been <br/>
doing that is just totally remarkable might not be doing enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This quote and possible impending changes in the law here (UK) to have all Home edders register and inspected has triggered anxieties for me.<br/>
<br/>
Briefly - i have a 4 year old boy who should have started reception (kindergarten in US i think?) year this september.  I started applying RU principles to our lives in April so thats almost 8mths ago which included lifting of TV restrictions.   He has also just got into the playstation (and so have I - lol!!) over the last 2 months and plays it A LOT!  He also likes to stay home a lot and is not really into playing with other kids when we do go to places which would make this possible - i think he prefers the predictability of playing with the adults in his life who will do what he tells them to rather than other children who might not be so &#39;obeidient&#39; to his wishes!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - *I* think all of this is fine for now - he is only 4 and *i* can see that he is doing remarkable things - the way he is mastering the playstation games and figuring out puzzles and such which sometimes i have missed! And the playstation is a new thing and he is just engrossed in it for now which is perfectly to be expected. Also i have been focusing on getting our relationships in the right place - getting my head around unschooling - i suppose deshcooling in a way.  <br/>
<br/>
However, if an inspector were to come round i doubt that he would consider what we are doing &#39;remarkable&#39; enough.  And relatives and friends have been telling me wonderful stories of children they know what have started school this year who can write their names already and are reading lots and lots of books - and look at me expectantly as if i&#39;m going to say, well, L is reading Harry Potter and writing essays or something.  <br/>
<br/>
Also i recently read a story about a disabled girl who was home edding here in the UK, the mum had pulled her out cos of frustrations with the school and they even did a film/documentary on her and showed her thriving on being home edded and at HE groups engaging with the other kids and enjoying herself.  Anyway,  in the end she has been forced back to school under the grouds of emotional neglect as they (authorities) decided her social needs were not being met.  Apparently the mum is now considering a move to scotland where the law is more relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
My point?  Well if they can say this girls social needs were not being met what on earth would they make of my son who doesnt even really like to play with other kids?  I&#39;m sure they would prescribe to the notion that he needs to be playing with other kids of his own age etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Before we starting down the RU path - we did do a lot of stuff that would have looked traditionally &#39;remarkable&#39; to outsiders - lots and lots of book reading, painting, sensory play, outings, crafting.  He used to cook with me and bake with me and just always be there with me doing stuff - now he has unlimited tv and has discovered the playstation he does very little of the other stuff &#39;compared&#39; to previously.   I&#39;ve always presumed this will balance itself out in the end (and still do)- i am enjoying the freedom and fun RU has brought to our lives - but when i think about how others, espcially inspectors or concerned relatives who may report us to inspectors, might see us i get very anxious.<br/>
<br/>
I do offer other things to do and also just start doing other stuff myself that he will often then just join in with - but there are still many days where his main acitivity all day is watching tv and playing playstation.  I can see the value in it myself but an inspector wouldnt.<br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also have a 4 year old.  I live in Quebec but I&#39;m from France and Dh is from Germany and we used to live in Belgium, so I am familiar with homeschooling difficulties in Europe (from hearsay and doing a bit of research, obviously, since my daughter is not yet school age.)  I am also not very sure how I am going to proceed here in Quebec, if I&#39;m going to register as a homeschooler (which most homeschoolers from here advise me *not* to do) or not.  All of this has made me very aware of how I would handle a situation like that, if an inspector were to come to my house.<br/>
<br/>
What I have been doing is keeping a blog of our activities, with pictures.  I have also started keeping a log (in my agenda) of things we are doing.  So far that&#39;s all I&#39;m doing, but my thought is that when my daughter becomes school age, I will (maybe ;-), in addition to these records, start translating all of this in school speak and keep a log, at least in the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
As for 4 year olds in school reading and writing: our neighbour is 4.5 years old and goes to preschool.  He can write the first letter of his name, and recognize it, but that&#39;s it.  (He did however tell me that he could write his name, I think because to him the concept is not very clear yet.)  He doesn&#39;t count very well yet.  In brief, I don&#39;t notice all that much difference between him and my daughter.  I would be wary of what others tell you about other children.  (And of course, all children are different.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-581320109">I liked Bea&#39;s responses.  If a four year old at home isn&#39;t writing his  <br/>
name, that&#39;s not a big deal.  If a four year old at school isn&#39;t,  <br/>
maybe also not a big deal.<br/>
At six, if the child at home isn&#39;t writing his name, that&#39;s not a bid  <br/>
deal.  At six, in school, they start labelling some kids &quot;advanced&quot;  <br/>
and some &quot;slow,&quot; and those labels can stick for life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Briefly - i have a 4 year old boy who should have started reception  <br/>
(kindergarten in US i think?) year this september-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is that mandatory for four year olds?<br/>
Many states (maybe all by now; I hope not) in the U.S. require  <br/>
kindergarten of five year olds.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He has also just got into the playstation (and so have I - lol!!)  <br/>
over the last 2 months and plays it A LOT! -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could look at some of the recent mainstream writings on  <br/>
video games and lift some phrases to use for what he&#39;s doing.  He&#39;s  <br/>
preparing for his future in ways that kids who are off playing with  <br/>
rotary-dial toy phones and such are not doing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And the playstation is a new thing and he is just engrossed in it  <br/>
for now which is perfectly to be expected. Also i have been focusing  <br/>
on getting our relationships in the right place - getting my head  <br/>
around unschooling - i suppose deshcooling in a way. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Document something sweet and good every week, maybe.  Maybe in a blog,  <br/>
or a post to this list!   You could gather those up later if you  <br/>
needed to.  A blog could have photos.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Before we starting down the RU path - we did do a lot of stuff that  <br/>
would have looked traditionally &#39;remarkable&#39; to outsiders - lots and  <br/>

playstation he does very little of the other stuff &#39;compared&#39; to  <br/>
previously-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to guess that because you&#39;re using the term/abbreviation  <br/>
&quot;RU&quot; (which I&#39;ve always tried to discourage on this list, for various  <br/>
reasons) that you got information elsewhere, which is fine but I don&#39;t  <br/>
think &quot;unlimited tv&quot; is necessarily a goal to treasure.   Choices,  <br/>
yes.   Acceptance of preferences, sure.  But &quot;unlimited tv&quot; that&#39;s  <br/>
crowding out reading, painting, sensory play and outings? Maybe plan  <br/>
your days in advance, knowing what programs he would be sad to miss,  <br/>
and watch those before you leave, or record them, or plan to return in  <br/>
time for that.   When our kids were little we would let them watch  <br/>
lots of videos and TV--probably all the wanted-- but we didn&#39;t just  <br/>
leave it on.   After a show ended, I&#39;d try to have something else in  <br/>
place (sometimes I didn&#39;t need to try--people were waiting for us, or  <br/>
kids had called and wanted to come and play or something), and unless  <br/>
they knew what show was next and wanted to watch it, there was no  <br/>
reason not to turn the TV off.  Because it had been part of the fabric  <br/>
of their life, it wasn&#39;t a glory-box that represented freedom or  <br/>
anything.  It was no different from the record player or the tape  <br/>
player or the radio.  It could be turned on for something and then it  <br/>
was turned off.<br/>
<br/>
If your change is very new, then I think you&#39;re right that it will  <br/>
taper off, and with winter here and video games being so big in his  <br/>
life, there might not be a change before April or May, but there might  <br/>
be places you could go that you could sell in a special way.  Museums  <br/>
or other places.  Maybe you could meet another home ed family to go to  <br/>
lunch, without the intent of matching the kids up as playmates, just  <br/>
to have someone else there so you get a double benefit from going out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-there are still many days where his main acitivity all day is  <br/>
watching tv and playing playstation. I can see the value in it myself  <br/>
but an inspector wouldnt.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the inspector (IF there come to be inspectors) can  <br/>
expect you to do glorious schoolish things 365 days a year.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know how many days a legal school year is in England, but here it&#39;s  <br/>
180 days.  That leaves 185 to be &quot;not school days.&quot;  And if those are  <br/>
the days he plays games and watches TV and learns scads of stuff, no  <br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re in the SW, when it&#39;s warmer maybe go to the Welsh history  <br/>
museum at St. Fagan&#39;s.  I got to go last summer.  It was big, and  <br/>
rich.   (I was going to say &quot;awesome&quot; but Brits don&#39;t think &quot;awesome&quot;  <br/>
is as lovely as Americans do. &lt;g&gt;)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/">http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/stfagans/</a><br/>
So kids go on field trips to places like that, and they&#39;re rushed  <br/>
through, and asked stock questions, and given dumbed-down  <br/>
explanations, but one child alone, or a small group of home ed kids,  <br/>
can linger on what they like, ignore some completely, ask all kinds of  <br/>
questions of the docents/guides, and REALLY, really learn.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a local castle.  Maybe you don&#39;t think a young child would care  <br/>
much, but you could be surprised.  And rather than telling him when it  <br/>
was built and why, maybe just wander around after him and see what he  <br/>
likes.  Spiral tower stairs?  Hand-wrought hinges and nails in the  <br/>
doors, maybe?  Furniture?   Stone floors.  Who knows?  No sense  <br/>
&quot;creating a unit&quot;--just go and be, touch, smell, see, hear, maybe  <br/>
taste (not the castle, but you could go to a pub for new and different  <br/>
food).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515628150">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Also i recently read a story about a disabled girl who was home edding <br/>
here in the UK, the mum had pulled her out cos of frustrations with the <br/>
school and they even did a film/documentary on her &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds scary but it&#39;s worth taking a deep breath and being calm about <br/>
it. Living in fear is a barrier to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to know the whole story from films, even documentaries. Even the <br/>
most objective documentarian still has a point a view. Choices are being <br/>
made in which footage to edit together and use. Perhaps the story was told <br/>
with extra sympathy for the mum because of some ideology on the part of the <br/>
filmmaker.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH perhaps the authorities have made a dreadful mistake with this case.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that happens when a law like this comes into being is that <br/>
unfortunately and most likely there are going to be mistakes made, in both <br/>
directions. By this I mean there will be kids that are missed who are <br/>
genuinely being neglected or abused, and there will be kids forced into <br/>
school for spurious reasons. These are likely to become high profile cases. <br/>
But statistically most people are going to fall into the middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
What the authorities will find is that suddenly they have a huge change in <br/>
the way they have to work. The number of homes and situations they have to <br/>
inspect will be enormous. The number of workers to do the job will probably <br/>
be inadequate. Standards will probably slide. The amount of paperwork and <br/>
work required to start the legal proceedings to drag kids into schools will <br/>
be huge. Chances are that they will start to focus on the more clear cut <br/>
problem kids, and leave the middle alone.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that they will have to do is define &quot;enough&quot;. If they have a bell <br/>
curve in schools (as we know they do), they will have to define a bell curve <br/>
for home education.<br/>
<br/>
If the UK is anything like here, there are probably groups mobilizing right <br/>
now to fight the new laws with statistics, positive outcomes and sheer <br/>
numbers. I hope it does not pass. I gather that in Australia homes get <br/>
inspected when you want to home school. When I heard that I was outraged <br/>
which shows that I have been living in the USA, where &quot;they&quot; need a warrant <br/>
or probably cause to enter your home, for a long time. My Aussie friend who <br/>
was telling me about the home inspections had a &quot;no big deal&quot; attitude about <br/>
it. Of course he hasn&#39;t seen my house.<br/>
<br/>
If it becomes a question of jumping through a few hoops, to have something <br/>
on paper for the inspectors, isn&#39;t it worth colluding with your son to <br/>
produce some busy work - with the full understanding that this is what you <br/>
are doing - to be able to continue your happy life the other 23 hours a day? <br/>
You may find that some of the kindergarteny stuff would be fun for you <br/>
both - without the grading/shaming/comparing part that goes on in a <br/>
classroom situation. Play up the puzzles and strategy aspects of the <br/>
playstation games on paper too.<br/>
<br/>
I see that you are worried about socialization. I would think that you could <br/>
give that a bit of time. Perhaps he will make friends with other gamers and <br/>
be able to talk about that. I would look for more autonomous learners to be <br/>
friends with, who might have kids who love playstation and get to play a <br/>
lot. That is not the only place to find gamers, but we all know that most <br/>
kids are going to be restricted and limited in their gaming time if they <br/>
aren&#39;t unschoolers, so it seems likely.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  Before we starting down the RU path - we did do a lot of stuff that <br/>
would have looked traditionally &#39;remarkable&#39; to outsiders - lots and lots of <br/>
book reading, painting, sensory play, outings, crafting.  He used to cook <br/>
with me and bake with me and just always be there with me doing stuff - now <br/>
he has unlimited tv and has discovered the playstation he does very little <br/>
of the other stuff &#39;compared&#39; to previously.   I&#39;ve always presumed this <br/>
will balance itself out in the end (and still do)-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what balance would look like in your home. If you are <br/>
continuing to be connected and active in meeting him where he is at with his <br/>
interests, maybe this amount of gaming and tv and that amount of other stuff <br/>
is &quot;balance&quot; for now. If you are all happy that is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
However what happens here is that this is cyclic. Yesterday an inspector <br/>
would assume that my dd did nothing but play on her computer and watch tv. <br/>
The day before that she loved the Wii more than life itself - she played <br/>
alone, she played with me, she played with her friends. If the inspector had <br/>
come three days ago he would have seen a girl making crafts, drawing a lot <br/>
and reading aloud about coral reefs and sea life from a book, with the tv <br/>
off. Last week the Monopoly board was out for three days in an ongoing game, <br/>
and we played several of our favorite card games.<br/>
<br/>
If you are missing some of those other activities, set up the paints on a <br/>
folding table in the tv room and do some while you watch together. Jayn uses <br/>
clipboards with drawing paper to draw while sitting on the sofa. Lay out a <br/>
puzzle of some kind on the coffee table for between the games. Jayn always <br/>
does a couple of things at once when watching.<br/>
<br/>
Also you could consider a hand held gaming device (we love Nintendo DSI) so <br/>
that he can take his passion with him. This is a great way to find other kid <br/>
gamers when out and about too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; espcially inspectors or concerned relatives who may report us to <br/>
inspectors, might see us i get very anxious &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see also that you are worried about your relatives. I would go back to the <br/>
old standby that Sandra has mentioned recently - tell them how happy you all <br/>
are focussing on his enthusiasm and skills, and say that &quot;this is working <br/>
really well for now. Of course if that changes, we can always put him <br/>
school.&quot; It&#39;s a shame not to be able to trust your relatives.<br/>
<br/>
And finally sometimes it is worth really considering the worst case <br/>
scenario. What would it take for you to move to Scotland yourself? Is it <br/>
doable, is it desireable? If the idea excites you, maybe it&#39;s worth looking <br/>
into even without the added impetus of the imminent inspections.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t speak for all Australian states, but here in Victoria the approach from the authorities is very hands-off.  No inspections, no testing, no records. Because home education is undertaken by such a tiny proportion of families, they figure you are probably going to do a reasonable job at it.<br/>
<br/>
At least, that&#39;s how it is for now!<br/>

And relatives and friends have been telling<br/>
me wonderful stories of children they know what have started school this year<br/>
who can write their names already and are reading lots and lots of books - ===<br/>
<br/>
My sister and I both have 5yo children.  My daughter, at 3, mastered writing her 8-letter name while sitting on her bed.  She spelled and wrote it properly, in sequence. She has never in her life had a spelling or writing lesson, but her questions have been answered, and her interests supported.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew, just a few months younger, does not write his 3-letter name legibly.  He has been in preschool (first a small community one, and now a private Montessori school)since age 3. He has had lessons,and hand-over-hand practice, since then. <br/>
<br/>
If school could make children able to write their names, he would be able to write his.  <br/>
<br/>
But, like so many things, each child will write when and only when they are ready.  They don&#39;t need lessons.  They need time and freedom, interest, something to write with and on...soap on mirrors? fog on the car window?  kindling wood on the driveway?  All of those and more are popular, here, and we&#39;ve got enough pencils, markers, crayons, inks, paints, and paper for a classroom, all free for our two kids to indulge in....once a month or in a glorious feast of page after page after page. <br/>
<br/>
My digital camera is a godsend.  My kids both build.  My son, 8, is a gamer, and my daughter makes a lot of art, just now.  Both perform for me regularly, and they play many hours-long fantasies, alone and together or with whoever happens by.  <br/>
<br/>
Most days, I snap at least a couple of shots of what they&#39;re up to. some days the camera just becomes a part of the fun...both love to share what they are doing, and they like that I post things on Facebook and on my blog.  They feel a little like superstars.  <br/>
<br/>
And I have incontrovertible documentation that, indeed, a vast amount of learning is happening here. At any moment, I could point someone to a dozen or more examples.<br/>
<br/>
For my gamer son, I often take pictures of him playing, report on what he&#39;s discovered during his play.  He&#39;s been playing Pokemon Diamond on his DS since he got it at Halloween, what he&#39;s learned could likely fill a few months worth of classroom hours. He loves vintage cartoons and animation - this is, in schooly terms, history and art and science and music...<br/>
<br/>
I think making the initial shift in perception is the hardest part.  Once I got used to it, it has gotten easier and easier. In my state, I&#39;m required to submit an instruction plan, then report quarterly, and present an end-of-year narrative. I used to spend hours trying to make them perfect, and that was time not spent with my children.  Now I know I could never fit in all the learning that is going on here, and I don&#39;t try.  I give the school enough to show I&#39;m upholding my end of the bargain, and I share the coolest stuff.   <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, you will see, as your son gets older, how very much deeper and wider his knowledge base is, how eagerly he soaks up new information and hoes his chosen skills...even if he never does stop finding the Playstation so fascinating!<br/>

I too have spent some time evaluating my children&#39;s education through the eyes of an inspector and understand how you feel. The proposed changes in the law are extremely worrying for all unschoolers here.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is very important that you get linked in to unschooling (or autonomous as we call it) groups and possibly campaigning groups too. Then when the law changes (and we know the only thing that will stop it now is a change of government) you will be as well prepared as possible. There is masses of action and support out there. <br/>

curriculum.&quot; You&#39;re in the honors class, I guess, using the &quot;write the <br/>
joke curriculum.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Margaux liked the joke.  She said, &quot;it&#39;s not so happy but very funny!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Margaux&#39;s joke that she made up isn&#39;t quite so &quot;educational&quot;, but it&#39;s cute anyway...<br/>
<br/>
What did the teddy bear say after it ate?<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m stuffed&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She made that one up after a several day run of playing with a huge pile of teddy bears.<br/>
