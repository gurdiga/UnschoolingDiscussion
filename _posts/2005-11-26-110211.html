<div id="ygrps-yiv-384265742">we are a family of 5 & have 3 daughters. (4, 12, & 16) we are making<br/>
the transition from homeschooling to unschooling. i have been reading<br/>
the unschooling handbook & gave our oldest the teenage liberation<br/>
handbook to read as well. i have also been pouring over sandras site &<br/>
these boards.<br/>
<br/>
we believe life experience is the BEST teacher. what they learn from<br/>
us as their parents & their own personal experiences are better than<br/>
what the school system could ever teach them! unschooling has been our<br/>
desire the past few months. i still have questions about math. that is<br/>
the subject that bothers me most. our oldest is not strong in math. i<br/>
worry for her future in that regard. she knows her basic math & i know<br/>
deep down this is all that matters. why do i worry so much about this?<br/>
especially since she is getting closer to age 18. she has no desire to<br/>
go on to school. no college or tech school. the girls love to read &<br/>
write so no worries there. our middle girl is quick with math. we dont<br/>
use workbooks or textbooks either. never have. we believe they are<br/>
very well rounded! both girls tell me often how glad they are to be<br/>
home after hearing the horrors of p.s./private school from their<br/>
friends & family. they feel they arent missing out on anything special.<br/>
<br/>
we have discussed this many times. the girls want to unschool & i want<br/>
them to be happy. so that is the direction we will take. if others<br/>
here have EVER been in our position, how did you make the transition<br/>
to unschooling? how did you let all the fears melt away? i would<br/>
appreciate hearing about what others have done. thanks!<br/>
<br/>
*now for a little background info. i hope this makes sense so bear<br/>
with me. lol!<br/>
<br/>
weve been homeschooling for 7 years. we are happy with the results &<br/>
are happy all around as a family. We never had any probs with our<br/>
previous methods of homeschooling. it worked for us. we used the cmm<br/>
method & we were very eclectic at the time. we have always been close,<br/>
open, & honest with the girls. we talk with them & vice versa. we are<br/>
attentive to their needs & feelings. when our youngest (& not our last<br/>
child that&#39;s for sure! lol) was born we unschooled for almost a year<br/>
but then went back to homeschooling because the girls missed the<br/>
structure i guess. (& so did mum i will admit.) hubby doesn&#39;t mind<br/>
what method or style we use. he is for them being at home bottom line.<br/>
he feels what i am doing is right & as long as everyone is happy<br/>
that&#39;s cool with him. the girls & i (when hubby is at work or out of<br/>
town hunting) together enjoy sharing our interests & just hanging out.<br/>
when hubby is home we do this together.<br/>
<br/>
the girls help around the house without us asking. we do chores<br/>
together. they love to cook/bake & are handy. very mechanically<br/>
inclined. especially our oldest. there are no bedtimes & hasnt been in<br/>
7 years! we try not to place too many restrictions on them. we are<br/>
looked at in the neighborhood, by our friends, & in the family as very<br/>
&quot;cool&quot; parents! the ones with the tats who dont conform not to mention<br/>
the openness we have with our girls.<br/>
<br/>
currently we are watching our favorite show babylon 5 (i have the<br/>
whole series on dvd-all 5 seasons) in the evenings. usually on mon &<br/>
tues we (the girls & i) camp out in our bedroom. we love to discuss<br/>
the characters & the worlds with their high tech space life. we refer<br/>
to the books on the show (i have them all. lol!) when we dont get<br/>
something. we watch it every year along with centennial. (which we<br/>
have on vhs & a childhood fav of mine!) we tape a lot of our fav<br/>
sci-fi/fantasy shows & educational shows to watch during the<br/>
afternoon. hubby is not watching with us this time around cuz he is<br/>
busy attending the tech college for his associate degree on mon & tues<br/>
nights after work. he comes in around 10 p.m. on these nights.<br/>
<br/>
since they were very young we have kept a lot of art supplies, dvds,<br/>
computer & ps2 games, videos, crafts, board games, books, puzzles, &<br/>
other resources always available for them. we have a big interest<br/>
together in religion/spirituality, history & science fiction/fantasy.<br/>
last march we-the girls & i decided to make our very own &quot;spirit<br/>
book&quot;. it is an ongoing project! it is filled with religious &<br/>
spiritual online info & personal info we have found on the net & have<br/>
written ourselves. it is eclectic. we have everything from catholic,<br/>
christian topics to paganism topics. there are 3 binders with almost<br/>
600 pages to date. we often refer to these binders. it is another one<br/>
of my legacies to our children. the girls even started their own<br/>
spirit books!<br/>
<br/>
we attend zoos, take trips, go hunting, (oldest) museums, concerts,<br/>
enjoy nature, & other functions together as a family.<br/>
<br/>
thanks again to anyone who responds. :) Amethyst</div>

There&#39;s no more to really say.   People worry.   It&#39;s not helpful.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Been in your position in what way?<br/>
Lots of people have been in all the whole range of positions.   There&#39;s only <br/>
one way to understand unschooling, and that&#39;s to try it a little, gain a <br/>
little confidence, and go some more.   You can&#39;t jump across a football field, but <br/>
you can walk across or run across or crawl or roll across.   You just have to <br/>
make the first move.   If you&#39;re closer to the other side than you were before <br/>
and you like that, make another move. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My husband loves those, but he&#39;s the only one who is of that religion. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
I&#39;ve thought of watching them so we can discuss them, but it just doesn&#39;t <br/>
appeal to me much so I stall.<br/>

I am fairly new here but I  also homeschooled for a few years before I  <br/>
actually made the full transition to unschooling. It sounds to me that you have  <br/>
all the bases covered when it comes to what&#39;s most important. <br/>
As Sandra said&quot;  People worry  It&#39;s not helpful&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I for one still have the days where I worry.  But then I realize what  I am <br/>
doing and go back to living a happy life with my children and trust all  will <br/>
be fine. I know I have made the right choice.  As long as you don&#39;t  start <br/>
throwing worksheets and tests at them (grin) It will all even out!<br/>
It took me a year and a half to make the full trasition.Just take one step  <br/>
at a time and you will start seeing the things they learn all on there on in  <br/>
there own time(yes Math too)<br/>
If they need the further math skills besides basic.....they will know what  <br/>
they need to know.<br/>
My husband taught himself chemistry at the age of 28 due to a job position.  <br/>
Anyone can do it if they need to or choose to.<br/>
 Hope this  helps!!!!                                                         <br/>
