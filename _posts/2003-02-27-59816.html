I may have misunderstood the website and I certainly don&#39;t know anyone living in an earthship but I have visited the website often and it seems to me that the earthship community in NM is off the grid. <br/>

An earthship can be off the grid even in a community that is not out in the middle of nowhere. Off the grid simply means that you are not plugged into the grid. Am I wrong? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500095263">No, they are off the grid.  They don&#39;t get power or water from <br/>
anything but immediate sources.  We stumbled upon them on a camping <br/>
trip about 5 years ago and are hoping to be able to build one in the <br/>
next 4 years or so. You can have an earthship be on the grid, if <br/>
required by code, but the goal is to be a completely self-sufficient <br/>
house.<br/>

Ah!  I get it.  Some earthships are still plugged into &quot;the grid&quot; and <br/>
some are not.  Depends on whether the owners choose all the <br/>
alternatives available to them (photovoltaic electricity, composting <br/>
toilets, gravity fed water supply system, grey water system, gas <br/>
refrigerator, Paloma type water heating).  Most all earthships <br/>
incorporate passive solar heating.  Some also have active solar <br/>
systems.  And some include a form of wood heat, especially around <br/>
Taos where the winters can be brutal.  Most earthship owners I know <br/>
have some plugs in some grids, but usually not as many grids as the <br/>
rest of us, for sure.<br/>
