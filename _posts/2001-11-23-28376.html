<div id="ygrps-yiv-856496549">&#39;Spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;<br/>
<br/>
While I couldn&#39;t find one of the translations that I ran across some time <br/>
ago, I found what seems to be a collectively more popular POV from <br/>
experienced moms and people with translations backgrounds. I waded <br/>
through quite a few and found one that had the most concise info, along <br/>
with backing up its statements with support. Great debate material!!<br/>
<br/>

Here&#39;s the summary:<br/>
<br/>
CONCLUSIONS <br/>
<br/>
      There is no authority in the Bible for the corporal punishment of <br/>
children with rod or otherwise, except in the Proverbs of Solomon. It is <br/>
only Solomon who recommends child-beating. Never the Lord. <br/>
<br/>
      Solomon&#39;s child-rearing methods worked very badly for his own son, <br/>
Prince Rehoboam. Solomon has an undeserved reputation for wisdom. In <br/>
reality, he left his country oppressed and impoverished. In his later <br/>
years, he turned to idol worship and practiced &quot;the abominations of <br/>
Chemosh and Moloch&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
      There is no support for he beating of youth outside of Solomon&#39;s <br/>
Proverbs. Solomon&#39;s views are controverted both by Jesus and the Apostle <br/>
John. <br/>
<br/>
      Paul warned Fathers against the anger and resentment that might be <br/>
aroused in their children by corporal punishments. The way of love was <br/>
better. <br/>
<br/>
      St. Paul deplored the punishment of youth by human fathers who <br/>
chastised youth &quot;for their own pleasure&quot;. Only divine chastisements were <br/>
righteous. <br/>
<br/>
      Jesus and John saw children as being close to God and urged love <br/>
rather than fear in education. <br/>
<br/>
      If a Christian henceforth grabs for a rod or a paddle because &quot;the <br/>
Bible says so&quot;, he is heeding the words of an idol-worshipping king, <br/>
rather than the words of Christ. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-751671317">Hi Kolleen....I never tried to look it all up<br/>
before...Thanks.....&quot;Suffer the little children...&quot;<br/>
didn&#39;t sound like beating to me......<br/>
However I&#39;m not a Christain....but if I haven&#39;t drunk<br/>
of the Water it is not becuase it hasn&#39;t been<br/>
opffered. Perhaps it is becuase the Water is so often<br/>
poluted.<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
Sharon<br/>
ps I spoil my children as much as I am able!!! And<br/>
will the grands, too and any others that come my<br/>
way!!!<br/>
