commercial interests.<br/>
<br/>
For our purposes, unschooling includes an attitude and certain intentions<br/>
regarding schooling, I believe. Sandra&#39;s example exclude themselves because<br/>
of their intentions. Those who would say the above are either<br/>
misunderstanding the word &quot;unschooling&quot; (as seems to be common) or maybe<br/>
just want to sound &quot;cool.&quot;<br/>
