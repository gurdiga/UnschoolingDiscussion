<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226346534">My 19 year old son works at a liquor/convenience store. He has learned a<br/>
lot while there. He runs the cash register, opens and closes the store,<br/>
etc. He also learned just how many people in out town of 10,000 are<br/>
alcoholics and how they are are to manipulate their lives in order to<br/>
stay that way. He learned how to help a young girl who had just been<br/>
attacked when she ran to him for help and about a woman in desperation<br/>
who came in and bought a bottle of vodka and drank it in the parking lot<br/>
along with downing a bottle of pills. She left a suicide note on the<br/>
window so people saw it eventually - it is a very busy store - and got<br/>
her help. For what ever &quot;higher educational&quot; reason he chose to work<br/>
there he is leaving. I am hoping he follows his heart for his next step<br/>
in what ever he chooses. Actually he said that he has decided to write a<br/>
book about aliens:) I&#39;m all for it. One of our other convenience/liquor<br/>
stores in town sold beer to a man who was so drunk he could barely stand<br/>
up and he was slurring his speech. Of coarse I happened to be next in<br/>
line. Not for alcohol:) I was remembering a young persons boyfriend who<br/>
had died in a car accident (drug related) two weeks earlier and that it<br/>
took hours to get the people out of the car. We could see the blaze of<br/>
shining lights - flashing on and off - from across the river. I called<br/>
liquor control when I got home. <br/>
Two days ago my family and I were out for a nice day. There were 8 of<br/>
us. &quot;Nice&quot; being relative. Anyway, a few were having difficulties and as<br/>
usual we discuss these issues. My 11 year old son was really ranting and<br/>
no one could stand it. We were walking a path in a wooded area that is<br/>
quite stunning. Three of us broke off from the pack and sat on a large<br/>
rock. My daughter who was in my group was having a difficult time so we<br/>
were going over things. The other group were ignoring my 11 year old so<br/>
he decided to retrace his steps to find me. He was alone, in other<br/>
words. He found me and I was busy. The other part of our group quickly<br/>
caught up with us and we asked for another minute to end our<br/>
conversation. They and my 11 year old son went to the van. We caught up<br/>
with them and went on our way. Meanwhile - I am sure you&#39;ve all heard<br/>
about the mass of child abductions lately. My daughter remembered seeing<br/>
a guy at the place where we had walked. He had parked his vehicle and<br/>
was pulling out the carpeting and scrubbing it. There is no water - it<br/>
is not a facility to clean your car. He had just abducted and raped a 15<br/>
year old boy - who got away. He is from Massachusetts. They caught the<br/>
guy and arrested him. Someone was watching out for us - especially my 11<br/>
year old son. My daughter reported what she saw. Another few lessons<br/>
learned. Did you hear Jeb Bush hired a guy - Mr. Renier - to straighten<br/>
out the Florida foster care system? Mr. Renier believes children should<br/>
be hit until they bruise and you see welts. Women should stay home (good<br/>
for home schooling anyway). No one should get a divorce. Etc. More<br/>
lessons learned. I have never hit my kids and neither has my husband. I<br/>
told him 30 years ago if he ever did we would get a divorce (that was<br/>
before we were married). I guess he likes me because we are still<br/>
married and he never did hit our kids:) All our kids are the ministering<br/>
sensitive kind who are there for others. We are learning to care for<br/>
ourselves as well. People frequently wonder what we have done to<br/>
&quot;produce&quot; such great people - not perfect-yet, great. We talk. Every one<br/>
matters. We don&#39;t demean - sometimes - not often. I don&#39;t know what<br/>
everyone else is doing so I don&#39;t have a ruler to measure the<br/>
difference. I have always believed life is a learning process that never<br/>
ends here or here after. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other<br/>
one and you will get where you are going. Thanks for listening. Michele<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012624840">Here in Vermont we have Perkins Pier down near Lake Champlain. It was<br/>
named after a man - Mr. Perkins :) - who was then president of UVM. His<br/>
son was involved in making sure there were no more Abenaki. This Mr.<br/>
Perkins began tricking them into thinking they were getting an injection<br/>
for health reasons. While they were out cold he castrated, etc. them so<br/>
they could not produce any more &quot;subhuman&quot; - his words NOT mine -<br/>
people. He became famous for this and went all over the world lecturing.<br/>
One day he was speaking and guess who was in the audience? A young Adolf<br/>
Hitler. Hmmm... Our esteemed Gov. Dean says the Abenaki don&#39;t exist.<br/>
They are not entitled to any thing &quot;special.&quot; Abenaki children cannot<br/>
receive government monies set aside for college tuition because &quot;they<br/>
don&#39;t exist.&quot; I guess I have been talking to &quot;dead people&quot; because they<br/>
seem real enough to me:) Michele<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-625928365">What about vouchers for homeschooling? If we are able to use them to<br/>
choose a public school and the government &quot;lets us&quot; home unschool why<br/>
can&#39;t we get our money and use it at home? Michele<br/>
