<div id="ygrps-yiv-39332974">That&#39;s pretty funny!  We&#39;re so used to having the question &quot;what year is<br/>
it?&quot; asked in relation to our vehicles that it seems a normal thing for me<br/>
to be asked that!  My first vehicle was a beauty of a VW bug 1964<br/>
convertible...bright red!  I&#39;m driving around an old 87 minivan and and<br/>
a1987 Saab.<br/>

I&#39;ll let him know.  His truck is a 1985 Ford F150 straight 6/4.  He&#39;s<br/>

watched dh do the whole front end (wheels, breaks that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795045375">Wake that man up!!  Dh is still trying to deal with this mess.  I tried to<br/>
email cathie privately and the message came back as returned.  I highly<br/>
apologize for cluttering the list with this but if you&#39;ll all bear with me<br/>
one more time.  Here&#39;s the problem.  85 Ford F150 straight 6/4 top loaded<br/>
transmission only engages drive intermittently.  The clutch, pressure plate,<br/>
throw out bearings are ruled out as a problem.  Do you know what in the<br/>
transmission would cause the gears to engage sometimes and not others?<br/>
Thanks for any and all help.  We need to get this thing going so he can get<br/>
back to work....yikes!<br/>

I just asked my DH who drives a 86 F-150 (which is a rattletrap by <br/>
the way) and he said it sounds like the synchronizers. I asked what <br/>
your husband should do, and his wise answer was to get the <br/>
transmission rebuilt. Not much help, sorry!<br/>
