<div id="ygrps-yiv-446235496">We have been very relaxed unschoolers from the beginning,back in <br/>
February, interspersed with occasional panic attacks from me, <br/>
wondering if I truly trust my daughter to learn what she &quot;needs&quot; to. <br/>
Been looking through the scope and sequence-type books, trying to <br/>
guestimate if she is on track with her peers. She came out of 4th <br/>
grade public school by request. Just when I finally start to relax in <br/>
my mind, she tells me that she wants more leading and input from me. <br/>
She said I have been leaving her alone too much. She is an ADHD type <br/>
that was burning out badly in school, and I didn&#39;t want to pressure <br/>
her at all. SO maybe it is her interest for me to be more of a <br/>
teacher than I have been? What&#39;s the worse that can happen, we can be <br/>
more structured and she can decide that she was wrong? Does anyone <br/>
else have a child that wants more direction? Is she just still <br/>
deschooling, thinking that she is not learning if someone doesn&#39;t <br/>
hand her the material? Does she need a &quot;school at home experiment&quot; to <br/>
show her that it is not the best way? Does she just need time to <br/>
trust how natural learning occurs? Please advise me if you can! She <br/>
is also kinesthetic-type learner I think, she doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>
drills or worksheets with paper and pencil, we brainstormed that <br/>
making a Price is Right-type game would be more exciting for her, she <br/>
is constantly wanting to move around. Any advice that you think may <br/>
be helpful would be greatly appreciated!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932870374">&lt;Does anyone<br/>
else have a child that wants more direction?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son thought he wanted that at one time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; Is she just still<br/>
deschooling, thinking that she is not learning if someone doesn&#39;t<br/>
hand her the material?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Probably - she is used to school and has been told time and time again &quot;you<br/>
need to know this...so you can grow up and get a good job and be a good<br/>
adult and survive&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;Does she need a &quot;school at home experiment&quot; to<br/>
show her that it is not the best way?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We did that with an ISP -- it was after we stopped doing that that my son<br/>
thought he needed &quot;to be taught&quot;.  We did a lot more talking about it and<br/>
decided that we would continue to talk about what he needs and it would all<br/>
work out.  We still don&#39;t do anything like school at home. He no longer<br/>
thinks he needs to be &quot;taught something just to be being taught something&quot;.<br/>
He is starting to understand when HE really does need to learn something,<br/>
and takes the time to learn it whether or not it is taught to him by some<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
There was one other time he said he thought that he might go to middle<br/>
school.  I asked what he thought he would be missing.  It came down to a<br/>
couple of his friends that want to homeschool were telling him that he<br/>
should go to middle school with them because it was fun and if he didn&#39;t go<br/>
to school that he wouldn&#39;t graduate or get a diploma and then wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
able to work or get a good job. He didn&#39;t think he would be missing anything<br/>
since there are other avenues for the things that he may want to do and he<br/>
really wouldn&#39;t miss the homework that would go along with all the other<br/>
stuff that school has to offer.  And trips to the beach is not offered<br/>
during school hours or in school at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt; Does she just need time to<br/>
trust how natural learning occurs? &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Could be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It may take time -- no one knows how much; maybe a year or two.  It will<br/>
happen, lots happens, it is unbelievable.  It is 20/20 hindsight :).<br/>
<br/>
It was almost 2 years after leaving school that my son has started to read<br/>
books for the pleasure of it again.  A 3rd grade teacher had squelched it by<br/>
stressing reading for points.  She told him to read the harder more<br/>
interesting book at home and read lots of the easy books at school so he<br/>
could get more points.  He left reading altogether.  But, like I said now he<br/>
reads -- to his little brother (stories he enjoyed me reading to him), to<br/>
himself the more challenging books and also some magazines and internet for<br/>
research on games and such or information or interesting articles.  The<br/>
metamorphosis has been amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Relax and eventually she will too.  And talk to her, again and again.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That is exactly what is supposed to happen in this transition, <br/>
right?  They get bored and eventually come out of it on their own <br/>
with their own motivation and initiation.  From what I&#39;ve heard, this <br/>
happens to every kid that is going from teacher-directed to self-<br/>
directed.  It sounds like you&#39;re doing a great job!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a HUGE range between leaving people alone too much and &quot;being a <br/>
teacher&quot; to them.<br/>
<br/>
You can spend all day every day with her and never be teacherly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What&#39;s the worse that can happen, we can be <br/>
more structured and she can decide that she was wrong?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The worst thing that can happen is that some ofthe same damage school can do, <br/>
moms at home can do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is she just still deschooling, thinking that she is not learning if someone <br/>
doesn&#39;t <br/>
hand her the material?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly that&#39;s part of it.  Handing her material won&#39;t bring her closer <br/>
to the goal, then.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does she need a &quot;school at home experiment&quot; to <br/>
show her that it is not the best way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does she need to cut herself on scissors to learn that it&#39;s not just knives <br/>
that can cut?  If school wasn&#39;t the best way, school at home is just another <br/>
version of that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does she just need time to trust how natural learning occurs? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not time so much as experience in learning naturally.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She <br/>
is also kinesthetic-type learner I think, she doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>
drills or worksheets with paper and pencil, we brainstormed that <br/>
making a Price is Right-type game would be more exciting for her, she <br/>
is constantly wanting to move around. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Making a game for her would still be &quot;doing school.&quot;  Why not just turn the <br/>
TV on and watch the Price is Right???   Or go to the mall and guess prices <br/>
with her and then look at the price tags.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps if you word it as &quot;learn what *she* needs to&quot; it will help. I think<br/>
if you&#39;re checking scopes and sequences, you&#39;re expecting her to learn on<br/>
her own what the experts think she needs to. What *she* needs to learn are<br/>
the skills and knowledge to pursue the things that interest her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does she mean by alone?<br/>
<br/>
She may not be asking for you to be a teacher so much as a partner, though<br/>
the only way she knows how to ask is to ask you to lead her. Are you<br/>
exploring and discovering the world together? Reading books together?<br/>
Watching movies together? Going places together? Are you her facilitator?<br/>
Are you actively strewing her path with opportunities? What are your days<br/>
like?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anyone <br/>
&gt; else have a child that wants more direction?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some kids do like having their days more scheduled. They may ask for<br/>
direction but what they want is help setting up a schedule. You could talk<br/>
to her about what her goals (any goals, not just academic) are, talk about<br/>
ways to acheive them and help her set up a schedule. (*If* that&#39;s what she&#39;s<br/>
asking for.) Then talk to her about it after a week to see how things are<br/>
going, what might need changed or tweaked, or whether the whole thing needs<br/>
scrapped.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801373205">Recently I noticed that Emily was &quot;looking for structure&quot; She was asking<br/>
&quot;What are we doing today/tomorrow/the next day/etc.? Are we going anywhere<br/>
t/t/tnd?&quot; She asked  EVERY day a couple of times. I think If we were still<br/>
battling that mindset that school is the way to learn, I may have tried to<br/>
add school, thinking that school and structure are synonomous. We decided to<br/>
discuss on Sunday evenings, our plans for the week. We decided to set up<br/>
more playdates. I told her that at least once a week we&#39;ll go someplace new<br/>
and interesting. One week we went to a farm (We are very big on farms) the<br/>
next week we went to Lilypons&#39; Water Plant nursery, this week we&#39;re going to<br/>
see SPIDERMAN!! Woo Hoo!<br/>
Anyway, All she wanted was a little knowledge of what was happening and a<br/>
voice in making those decisions. Not more School Structure, but more fun<br/>
things to do. More interesting outings.<br/>
I can do that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648282771">I have one who *needs* structure.  He needs more than I can possibly <br/>
give him so he gets it from my mother in the form of &quot;school&quot; which is <br/>
a certain time of day that he spends with her doing whatever they do <br/>
over there.  I know he is choosing the subject matter because my <br/>
mother is simply not that interested in trains!  He is, however, an <br/>
extremely complicated case.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds to me like yours just needs a a little help in figure out <br/>
what she wants to do.  Does she know the options?  what&#39;s available? <br/>
etc.  Maybe what she really needs is to sit down with you and figure <br/>
out what SHE wants to do.  Discussion can go a long way toward <br/>
allaying any fears she may have about not being like the other kids <br/>
and not learning what they are learning in school.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it is very important to remember that every child is <br/>
different.  What works for two of mine is an absolute disaster with <br/>
the third one.  As a parent, you need to figure out what YOUR child <br/>
needs and follow that guideline.<br/>

Yes.<br/>
I have one that really likes to know what is happening the next day. He used <br/>
to like having his clothes laid out the night before when he was little.<br/>
His need for &quot;structure&quot; just means a knowledge of some schedule of <br/>
events....which I am not very good at.<br/>
I really believe a child that needs structure, simply needs knowledge of <br/>
upcoming plans, an understanding of the planes for the week.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that means unschooling doesn&#39;t work for them. It works for <br/>
all kids in my very passionate opinion.<br/>
School at home or otherwise is NOT the answer.<br/>

but he also needs the majority of his days to be the same.  If we do <br/>
too much and go too many places and disrupt his schedule too many <br/>
times, no matter how good we are about telling him exactly where we <br/>
are going and when, hw still has problems from it. I think there is a <br/>
whole spectrum of kids and they range from those who don&#39;t care if <br/>
they know what is happening in the next minute to thise who need <br/>
sameness and structure in their lives.<br/>

wants to make some spelling words of her choosing, like words that she has <br/>
asked me the definitions of, or multiplication facts, that her grandmother <br/>
has been regularly drilling her on, to my dismay. She loves gameshows, and <br/>
The Price is Right was the first thing I could think to liken it to. She <br/>
wants to make index cards, and have fun sorting them whatever way she feels <br/>
inclined to, on the wall. She wants us to get some chalkboard paint and make <br/>
a big board in the basement (a huge finished room that has been designated <br/>
the schoolroom, with plenty of space and bookshelves and games and toys and <br/>
tv/vcr/dvd, but has overflowed into every room of the house LOL) to play at, <br/>
she wants to &quot;teach&quot; her almost 3yo sister. In fact, she wants to read aloud <br/>
to her sister, and gets frustrated when little sister won&#39;t stay in one place <br/>
on the floor and listen, she wants to climb in her lap, talk about the <br/>
pictures, etc. That lead to an interesting conversation about how that <br/>
&quot;method of schooling/teaching&quot; didn&#39;t work for her, and she can&#39;t expect her <br/>
naturally curious sister to want to Sit Still and Pay Attention!!!! But, I <br/>
digress :0)  I am not trying to make her a game to trick her into learning, <br/>
she is &quot;kinesthetic&quot; from what I have gathered, and I encourage her to play <br/>
and learn whatever delights her. Please continue to provide opinions and <br/>
feedback, I always welcome different perspectives on this list! Thanks again!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you Joyce, for some great questions and answers. She has always had <br/>
this thing about &quot;alone&quot;. In our old cape cod house a year ago, she had a <br/>
bedroom upstairs while our bedroom was downstairs. She hated going up there <br/>
to play, sleep, etc. I basically let her do whatever she wants, and at first <br/>
I was &quot;worried&quot; because she would only seem motivated for &quot;real learning&quot; in <br/>
spurts, then I read how children learn in waves, sometimes taking longer <br/>
periods to process and reflect, and they are still learning whether it shows <br/>
from the outside. I have not shared any of these concerns with her, just <br/>
wanted her to be free of pressure. We don&#39;t watch much tv, she doesn&#39;t read a <br/>
full book by herself, she would rather I read aloud to her (and I have, but <br/>
want to more than I have), she leaves a lot of &quot;projects&quot; and books <br/>
unfinished, but that&#39;s normal, I hope? When we started in February, she had <br/>
an interest in learning French. We (okay, I) kind of went a *little* <br/>
overboard, buying up books, getting materials from the library, almost making <br/>
a unit of it. We learned about Impressionists, went to the museum, which she <br/>
begged to do, but hasn&#39;t really done more than learn some numbers and common <br/>
phrases. I was enjoying it, because I retained some of my 3 years of high <br/>
school french, because i did learn most of it by interest. So maybe she had <br/>
all she needed of it for now, and I let it go. The same for a few other <br/>
topics. But now she liked it &quot;better&quot; when we got up on a schedule, and I was <br/>
giving her a plan to follow and materials to explore. It was by no means <br/>
&quot;school at home&quot;. We do a lot together, I probably overdo it with leaving <br/>
things strewn about (especially laundry LOL LOL my house hasn&#39;t been the same <br/>
since bringing her home), but i still think she expects us to sit at a table <br/>
and &quot;learn&quot;. My next question: does anyone explain what unschooling is to <br/>
their kids, do their kids ever question why things are so unstructured? This <br/>
probably would only apply to the ex-schooled children who are learning the <br/>
concept of &quot;natural&quot; learning right along with their self-conscious moms!!  <br/>
Should I try to explain what I have read by Holt, or that I was mistaken in <br/>
assuming that schooling was necessary to learn?  I haven&#39;t really explained <br/>
it to her, would that help alleviate her need to play school? Or just keep <br/>
going with the flow~~~~~~~~~<br/>

I would, definitely.  <br/>
The same way you could to an adult, you could just point out the things she <br/>
has learned for fun, mostly on her own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s thinking you don&#39;t care whether she learns.  Allaying her fears <br/>
and putting happy hope in the places where the fears were might help a lot!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Megan&#39;s got a play chalkboard that has &quot;home&#39;s cool&quot; written on it LOL. We <br/>
were given a very fortunate opportunity to buy this house a year ago. Ready <br/>
for a soap opera :0) ? We were happy in our little starter cape cod, I called <br/>
it my &quot;doll house&quot;. I had no desire to move or upgrade. Except for the public <br/>
school. In April of 2001, I was seriously considering homeschooling. Then my <br/>
father makes us an offer to buy his house, after he lived here alone for many <br/>
years. My mom had moved out a few years after they had bought it together. <br/>
They had made many attempts to reconcile. This time they were getting back <br/>
together for good, and he was moving in with her. He had offered to sell this <br/>
house to us several times, and we never took him seriously, he is very <br/>
fickle. I was also pregnant and due in June. It was the craziest thing we <br/>
ever did. We moved in the first week of May, 2001. I thought the opportunity <br/>
was God&#39;s way of giving Megan a new start at a new school. The new district <br/>
was a small improvement, but I know now why it ultimately failed her again. I <br/>
have learned more about compulsory education AFTER I removed her in February. <br/>
I had some guilt that I didn&#39;t start her homeschooling at the old house, but <br/>
I had a lot of anxiety then, how could I be her teacher when she was defiant <br/>
about anything involving teaching? Anyhoo, it has been much easier starting <br/>
it in this house, with the baby older and more independent. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
sound like I am bragging, but I love this house. I didn&#39;t really care for it <br/>
when my parents bought it, but I am so glad my dad made me an offer I <br/>
couldn&#39;t refuse. It would have been more than we could afford, but he gave it <br/>
to us furnished and below market value. It sits on a big pond(probably an <br/>
acre), that 5 or 6 houses all have a piece of. We have gotten to observe <br/>
canada geese, a great blue heron, rabbits nesting somewhere nearby, we have <br/>
hummingbirds, and now there are white ducks that someone asked the neighbor <br/>
to let live here. There is a huge basement that my parents finished, but my <br/>
dad never used for years. We put all our old furniture down there, including <br/>
entertainment center, and my dh was calling it the &quot;man room&quot;, because it <br/>
used to have a pool table that dad got rid of, and it has beer signs all <br/>
over. It was his room to get away from us hyper girls LOL. Slowly i have made <br/>
it the homeschool room LOL. I took down the lighted bar signs, and covered up <br/>
another one with a big poster, and added other signs and posters that are <br/>
&quot;educational&quot;.  It was a nice place to start in the cold of february, lots of <br/>
room for the little ones to play while Megan and I explored subjects <br/>
together. Also, plenty of room for Megan, the kinesthetic and distracted <br/>
type, to move about. Now we hardly go down there, so we have been bringing <br/>
books up, and we spend a lot of time outdoors. But I have a feeling, as it <br/>
gets hot and humid out, we will be down there more.<br/>
<br/>
OH, and my dad bought my old house after it sat empty for sale for 6 <br/>
months...........<br/>
