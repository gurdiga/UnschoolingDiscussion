<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127940221">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t normally post much, but was delighted to find that I am 158.4 <br/>
Mercurian years old.<br/>
Now, that&#39;s longevity!  (grin)<br/>

I&#39;m only 62 Venusian years old, but somehow, I can&#39;t help but think that <br/>
Venusians have more fun than Mercurians, so maybe those 62 years are just <br/>
more jam-packed...<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cool.  I&#39;d only be 21 if I lived on Mars.  And--I get 4 birthdays <br/>
next year, one in Jan, Feb, May and July. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a poster at my job that says &quot;Birthdays are good for you.  <br/>
The more you have, the longer you live.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700206545">Thank you for posting this great website.  The children were studying<br/>
about the solar system this afternoon and this was a neat and timely<br/>
addition to our studies.<br/>
