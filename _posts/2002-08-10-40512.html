&gt;&gt; IS the natural opposite of school. Perhaps some feel that if we openly<br/>
&gt;&gt; criticize schools and it&#39;s supporters such as the government, NEA, and PTO,<br/>
&gt;&gt; that the unschoolers way of life might be regulated out of existence. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; thought this was &quot;The Land of The Free and The Brave&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned responds: <br/>
<br/>
Yes, that has been going on in CT. Some HSers believed that the best way not<br/>
to lose our freedoms (CT has virtually no regulations) was to keep low, not<br/>
make waves, not seek our natural rights, and we&#39;ll be fine...we don&#39;t want<br/>
to risk losing even more freedoms...Well, that worked OK until this year,<br/>
when the people who want to eliminate our threat to their full control came<br/>
out of the woodwork and did their damnedest to regulate us out of existence.<br/>
It was only by luck that homeschoolers even got wind of the impending<br/>
attack. We were lucky this time, but the legislators have vowed to return,<br/>
and the superintendents and their own union never rest in their<br/>
self-interest of eliminating alternatives to their educational rice bowl.<br/>
<br/>
 My hope is that unschoolers who are in denial will at least be aware that<br/>
there are a great many people working hard and long to preserve what<br/>
freedoms exist for us to keep from being force to turn our children over to<br/>
the state&#39;s schools.<br/>
<br/>
Then Tuck writes: <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t believe most unschoolers are afraid that it will be regulated<br/>
&gt; out of existence, because it never has been.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned sez: <br/>
Tuck, you&#39;re probably right about &quot;most unschoolers&quot; but it&#39;s denial by them<br/>
and, unfortunately, by you also. Not just unschooling, but homeschooling is<br/>
&quot;regulated out of existence&quot; in several European countries -- people just<br/>
like many of us. Why is that so? Are those countries so different from ours?<br/>
It can happen, and it didn&#39;t happen without having people in power who want<br/>
total control of all citizens. In the US, that&#39;s the NEA and its types.<br/>
<br/>
Before 1850, there was no such thing in this country. (In fact,<br/>
homeschooling was the norm)  Today, the government system controls 90<br/>
percent of all children  -----  Do we see a trend there? ----- And the<br/>
teachers unions advertise like gangbusters, spending teacher&#39;s money, to<br/>
increase it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765138603">It is awful that we also have to enter the politics of Homeschooling. But if <br/>
we don&#39;t protect our rights they will be gone.  Think about this: <br/>
Homeschooling might have always been but until now  it wasn&#39;t always known as <br/>
an alternative. And now it is and the homeschoolers are publicly doing a <br/>
better &quot;job&quot; at &quot;teaching&quot; and the powers that be don&#39;t like public school to <br/>
not be in control of our children.<br/>

<br/>
My thoughts:<br/>
Why do we homeschoolers need to go on the offensive? Why is vigilance and<br/>
action not enough?<br/>
<br/>
Second thought (ooohhh!!! TWO today, and it&#39;s only 7:00am)<br/>
Home/Unschooling parents bring many talents to the arena. Some start email<br/>
lists, Some write for related periodicals, Some start local groups to<br/>
network for social events, Some put on info nights at public libraries, Some<br/>
act as &quot;Secular Watchdogs&quot; (my word) making sure teh religious don&#39;t claim<br/>
homeschooling as their own, some travel the country speaking at conferences,<br/>
some write books and some focus on the political side. And many simply act<br/>
as an example to other home/unschoolers quietly, by living their unschooling<br/>
lives as if nothing out of the societal norm were happening. All these are<br/>
good and valid and important to our homeschooling futures. Just because some<br/>
of us choose to focus on less political areas doesn&#39;t mean we are ignoring<br/>
or denying anything.<br/>
Everyone contributes something In Their Own Way.<br/>
I am thrilled with the bright, hard working vigilant people at Maryland Home<br/>
Ed Association and in my own county. The are doing a great job staying on<br/>
top of the inevitable boundary crossing that the school system here does.<br/>
They have given me a great gift, to contribute in my way to our<br/>
homeschooling community, which is currently starting our SECOND unschooling<br/>
group in the county. I (or anyone) can&#39;t focus on everything! Neither can<br/>
we. The school system threatening our rights to educate our own is a very<br/>
important AND interesting discussion. But  I can&#39;t monopolize a homeschool<br/>
information night with unschooling, &quot;But it is so important everyone MUST<br/>
know ALL about it!&quot; So I make my announcement, &quot;Maryland Unschooling Family<br/>
COnnection meets forparent support groups once a month and lots of fun<br/>
things for the kids all month long. Please speak with me after the meeting<br/>
and I will give you all the info you need to start learning about<br/>
unschooling.&quot;<br/>
Maybe there are Not enough email lists dedicated to the political side, I<br/>
think this topic DESERVES its own forum.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174508431">right Elissa!<br/>
When I didn&#39;t have little ones nursing like now,  I ran alot: resource dept. <br/>
of hm sch org., hm sch group at my house, organized parties like the solar <br/>
system, field trips,...<br/>
I found that 10% of people are doers and the rest complain.  Found this true <br/>
in the church too.<br/>
When you&#39;re the one running things you keep seeing the same old doers. The <br/>
same 10% of whatever group it is.<br/>
too bad.<br/>
Being raised in the institution of public schools probably contributes to <br/>
this alot.<br/>
Another great reason for unschooling!<br/>
&#39;Course any reason for unschooling is a good reason!<br/>
