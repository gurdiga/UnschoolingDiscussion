<div id="ygrps-yiv-101303901">&lt;&lt;why is it so hard for some people to accept that their writing style is<br/>
abrasive and try to change the tone of their writing&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have always found it easier to change my perceptions of<br/>
people, to simply accept them as they are and not take it personally, than<br/>
to try to force others to change.<br/>
<br/>
My best friend all through school had few friends other than me.  People<br/>
described her as caustic....I continue to love her dearly because I always<br/>
know exactly what she thinks about things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024314353">&lt;&lt;it happens on this list on a regular basis&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have yet to see it.  What I DO see is people posting imprecisely (is that<br/>
a word?) and when others respond to what they posted, rather than what they<br/>
meant, they feel defensive.  Rather than posting &quot;Oh, I see where you might<br/>
have misunderstood me. This is what I meant.....&quot;  They squawk and holler<br/>
about how people are just mean to them.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t particular to this list.  I have seen it on virtually all lists<br/>
that I have had dealings with.  And I often see it in real life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809954856">I think you need to go back and read the whole string of posts that started<br/>
when Bridget joined the list.  While she might not have been clear enough<br/>
for SOME people, others had no problem understanding what she was saying.<br/>
AND, when she followed your advise and tried to more clearly describe what<br/>
she was talking about she WAS definately attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because you don&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t happening.  And it<br/>
still isn&#39;t paranoia simply because you see it as such and don&#39;t see things<br/>
that are happening on the list in the way that some others may see them.<br/>
