I sat  with him on the <br/>
couch and held him and listened to him and he told me how  he was feeling and <br/>
I listened <br/>
and gave him hugs and kisses. After he was  in a calmner space, i started <br/>
talking wiht him <br/>
about what his options  were-of either our room or his and which did he want <br/>
but he got <br/>
really  upset again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
Why can&#39;t he sleep on the couch?  Why is it either your room or  his?  <br/>
 <br/>
I always turned the lights down and got the house quiet and stayed on the  <br/>
couch or wherever was comfortable for the little one to be until he had enough  <br/>
and snuggled in with me.  <br/>
 <br/>
Why don&#39;t you just sleep on the couch with him?  Or sleep on the couch  while <br/>
he&#39;s playing nearby.<br/>
