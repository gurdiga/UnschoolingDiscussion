<div id="ygrps-yiv-776409003">Heya!<br/>
<br/>
Rowan is almost 7. Kestrel is almost 4. Aurora, almost 1. None of them have<br/>
even so much as set foot in a school, and when I asked Rowan if he was<br/>
interested, the other day, he flat-out laughed at me. So far so good.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my problem. I&#39;m still catching myself being all happy when something<br/>
that I identify as schoolish benchmarks and accomplishments pops up. We<br/>
don&#39;t do spelling exercises or workbooks or anything; Rowan wants to spell<br/>
stuff so he can find things on the internet, or contribute his input to the<br/>
grocery list. And yet I am all giddy in my heart-of-schoolish-darkness that<br/>
he&#39;s *spelling*. He does amazing math in his head, when he&#39;s doing<br/>
construction projects with his father, and I&#39;m all stoked because in my<br/>
brain I know that that&#39;s math I didn&#39;t do until 4th or 5th grade.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m wondering when schoolishness gets eradicated from my thoughts? And<br/>
what&#39;s it attached to? And most importantly... does this kind of backbrain<br/>
chatter show through, and damage what I&#39;m doing? Ack!<br/>

So do I, but it went from giddy and &quot;AHA!  Take THAT!&quot; thoughts to my  <br/>
current more &quot;Cool, I should write that up on Always Learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I love easy questions!<br/>

Never.<br/>
<br/>

Self image and childhood expectations and fears.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe it shows sometimes, but there&#39;s probably less damage to  <br/>
unschooling by it, because you&#39;re actively trying to change, than  <br/>
there would be to your own personal growth if you didn&#39;t try to change  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
(Wow.  That swirled and whirlpooled...  Wait...)<br/>
If you didn&#39;t let your backbrain chatter and then look at what you  <br/>
were thinking, that might be more damaging than processing it on out  <br/>
and seeing it for what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I still have sudden thoughts of &quot;Oh no!&quot; and although they go away  <br/>
quickly, they still do pop up like little weeds sometimes.   I was out  <br/>
picking weeds this morning.  Some of those weeds that take two hands  <br/>
to pull if they&#39;re grown can be pulled out with two fingers when  <br/>
they&#39;re seedlings.    And that&#39;s why I point out when people seem not  <br/>
to be &quot;pulling their little weeds&quot; (like using &quot;student&quot; or &quot;taught&quot;  <br/>
or &quot;6th grader&quot; or &quot;have to&quot;).  Because I know they&#39;ll be harder to  <br/>
get rid of the longer people wait to start.<br/>
