should they not be excited and giddy and why should we not share that<br/>
with them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
I totally agree with Pam. Once that baby or toddler get to teen <br/>
years, you aren&#39;t parenting the same person. You&#39;ve already said <br/>
many sad goodbyes, and yet, there is such joy in the next stage. I <br/>
would no more want Trevor to be a toddler again, than I would want <br/>
Jalen to suddenly grow up. (well, maybe for a day or two:)<br/>
Every stage is so interesting, and our relationship evolves to new <br/>
levels. I LOVE watching Trevor try new things, philosophize about <br/>
deep matters and talk about his own place.<br/>
He&#39;s always been fiercely independent, and he already talks about <br/>
having his own place. I lamented that maybe home wasn&#39;t so great if <br/>
he wanted his own place so badly, and he laughed and said &quot;that&#39;s <br/>
not it Mom, I don&#39;t want to move out yet, I&#39;m just looking forward <br/>
to having things exactly how I want them without anyone messing with <br/>
it&quot; (a problem with younger sibs).<br/>
That&#39;s cool.<br/>
I&#39;ll be happy for him as he explores the world in new ways, <br/>
including his own house or apartment. It will be fun helping him get <br/>
started when he&#39;s good and ready, and he knows the door is always <br/>
open should he need to come home again. I hope he waits a good <br/>
while, but when he feels the need, whether he&#39;s 16 or 20 or beyond, <br/>
I will be happy for him.<br/>

was talking about moms who are happy they don&#39;t have to &quot;deal&quot; with <br/>
their kids anymore &quot;oh god i cant WAIT until they are gone and i can <br/>
have a REAL life&quot; (whether that is when the kids are off to college, <br/>
or grade school, or full time daycare at six weeks....), not parents <br/>
who are happy to see that their kids are going to be starting the <br/>
next step in their journey into adult life. Parents that are &quot;giddy&quot; <br/>
for themselves, and not remotely for their children. Sure, not <br/>
everyone is cut out to be a full time/stay at home parent and those <br/>
kids are probably better off in school--and i understand pam&#39;s desire <br/>
that this list not turn into a bash-fest against these other parents <br/>
and remain a forum for unschooling. But there is a big difference in <br/>
a parent being supportive and encouraging independance when the <br/>
child/young adult is ready, and a parent kicking the child out the <br/>
door at age 18 with a good riddance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750283948">I am wondering, and not in a &quot;superior&quot; way but instead a <br/>
philosophical one, if many unschooled children will perhaps be more <br/>
ready for independence at any age, be it 5, 18, or otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
We of course are nowhere near officially schooling or unschooling in <br/>
any capacity, as Morgaine is 4.5, but I have begun to call <br/>
us &quot;unschoolers&quot; partly for my daughter&#39;s sake, who is being <br/>
pressured from all sides to &quot;go to school,&quot; and partly for my sake, <br/>
as a more complete answer to those approaching the <br/>
preschool/kindergarten/homeschool question (though it&#39;s not a word I <br/>
use with everyone).  That qualification made, here&#39;s the thought: <br/>
<br/>
Since unschooled children are learning through day to day life, <br/>
there is so much more opportunity to gather the skills they need to <br/>
lead a safe, rich, unsupervised life.  And it seems that many people <br/>
who would be unschoolers start with the attitude from a younger age <br/>
of involving their children in their day-day lives in a way that not <br/>
only helps them form healthy attachments to people but also size up <br/>
the world -- not to say these are not skills other children can&#39;t <br/>
and don&#39;t learn, only a particular tendency of unschooled children <br/>
to be actively engrossed in the parents&#39; world rather than <br/>
segregated.  <br/>
<br/>
I think also when we are with our kids, learning as they do, we are <br/>
so aware of what they do and don&#39;t know; what they have discovered <br/>
vs. what they need to discover still -- it is easy to delegate <br/>
responsibility for many skills (let&#39;s say money sense as one <br/>
example) to a curriculum or public school teacher; parents assume <br/>
the necessary skills have been taught and yet often they haven&#39;t <br/>
been.  A child in an unschooling home will likely have more exposure <br/>
to these skills, and a parent can easily pick up on places the <br/>
child/young adult needs more experience to lead a <br/>
safe/content/independent life and fill in.  Also the child&#39;s been <br/>
schooled in life rather than in a classroom, so of course more real-<br/>
life experience follows. <br/>
<br/>
I do think this begins at a very young age on a philosophical level; <br/>
almost every person I know with 3-4 year olds feels compelled <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; them or send them to preschool; few trust life to provide <br/>
enough learning opportunities.  I think unschooling implies a faith <br/>
in children to learn in a way that empowers children, likely paving <br/>
the way for more independence at a younger age, esp. if they find it <br/>
a necessary skill.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242164742">I think the independence does come a lot from temperment. I do think <br/>
that unschooling will prepare them for that independence. I went to <br/>
public school, and from personal experience I can say that naturally <br/>
I am a very independent person, but when I was ready to leave my <br/>
parents house and when I was prepared to, differed greatly because <br/>
of my inexperience with the daily life tasks that would be necessary <br/>
to be on my own. I see this in a lot of schooled adults. My thought <br/>
now is that I have a VERY independent almost four year old, and has <br/>

Your thoughts ring true in many ways.  But think about this...my dh pointed out to me years ago our cultural need to raise &quot;independent&quot; children and wondered at the time what constitutes true independence - his point being that the ability to depend on one another is not a hindrance and can perhaps serve us better as human beings.  So part of what is important to me in my family structure is feeling comfortable with our dependence on one another without it being judged as a failing or problem or negative in anyway.<br/>
<br/>
And as pointed out by Danielle...if we are trully respectful of each our children&#39;s own individuality i think we&#39;ll see that the trait of &quot;independence&quot; varies from one person to another.<br/>

Yes I do - I am fortunate and thanks for reminding me.  I credit him with pointing me (20 plus years ago) towards the path of parenting the way I do today - not to say that i may not have found it without him in my life...but his wisdom back then certainly turned me or guided me toward where i am today.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, since he has left his alternative-minded business 5 yrs ago and is now daily in a mainstream environment he&#39;s not as &quot;wise&quot; as he used to be &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t know if his anxiety about &quot;schoolish&quot; stuff would be as prevalent as it is had he remained in his old profession.  What we do and who we are with on a daily basis can be so important in terms of how we are and what we think.  Not that the new career hasn&#39;t served him (or us) well in many ways - it&#39;s just that he is not as patient with our unschooling journey as he was when dd&#39;s were young and he was around folks who supported the family-style choice we live on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
Your email reply has prompted me to give him a big hug and kiss and spawned a rather interesting conversation between the two of us acknowledging the changes in him (not the first time this has been discussed),  as well as recognizing that I still very much seek his insights to human nature.<br/>
<br/>
I am fortunate and always learning...<br/>

and if you&#39;re there for him to come back to, he will eventually be able to go <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       To do that -- to raise your children to do that -- you may need to <br/>
help them understand and overcome some pretty strange things about human nature <br/>
and response in various situations. It&#39;s not all nature, but not all nurture <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m reading a new book called &quot;Opening Skinner&#39;s Box&quot; by Lauren <br/>
Slater. It is written as literature rather than a scientific text, to tell the Power <br/>
of Story in the most famous and controversial psychological experiments of <br/>
the 20th century. <br/>
<br/>
       The first is Milgram&#39;s 1961 obedience to authority experiments, in <br/>
which 70% of the ordinary people tested gave escalating electrical shocks to <br/>
strangers, up to and past the point of hearing their screams. I heard about this, <br/>
but hadn&#39;t known that the subjects&#39; upbringing (how they were parented) and <br/>
life experiences (such as military service) were studied and analyzed, and some <br/>
surprising conclusions drawn about who was more likely to stand up to <br/>
authority, &quot;to be strong and wise enough to ask for help,&quot; et cetera.<br/>
<br/>
       Then there was Kitty Genovese, stabbed in the streets for nearly an <br/>
hour while which 38 witnesses refused to help, or even *call for* help from the <br/>
safety of their dark NYC apartments. The public assumed they must be wicked, <br/>
heartless city folk, but the experiment seemed to find otherwise -- that lack <br/>
of action is inevitable in a situation of such &quot;diffuse responsibility&quot; (maybe <br/>
like schools spreading the accountability among too many programs and <br/>
professionals for any one to get the job done?)<br/>
       <br/>
       And now I&#39;m reading the part about how individuals respond to cries <br/>
for help when they believe no one is in charge (similar to, but also different <br/>
from Milgram, in which a single authority was right on the spot and calmly in <br/>
control of everything.)<br/>
<br/>
       In other words, the emerging theory is that the situation can matter <br/>
much more than we&#39;d like to admit. I suspect this could be big news as <br/>
scientific support for independent unschooling, btw, as an optimal situation. <br/>
<br/>
       But it also probably means that we can&#39;t use unschooling as some kind <br/>
of magic that inoculates our own children against their own deepest instincts <br/>
and responses. The best we can do, I&#39;m thinking, is to help them learn to <br/>
understand themselves and others and the world we all live in, and deal with it <br/>
all.  JJ<br/>

       The first is Milgram&#39;s 1961 obedience to authority experiments, in <br/>
which 70% of the ordinary people tested gave escalating electrical shocks to <br/>
strangers, up to and past the point of hearing their screams. I heard about <br/>
this, <br/>
but hadn&#39;t known that the subjects&#39; upbringing (how they were parented) and <br/>
life experiences (such as military service) were studied and analyzed, and <br/>
some <br/>
surprising conclusions drawn about who was more likely to stand up to <br/>
authority, &quot;to be strong and wise enough to ask for help,&quot; et cetera.<br/>
<br/>
       Then there was Kitty Genovese, stabbed in the streets for nearly an <br/>
hour while which 38 witnesses refused to help, or even *call for* help from <br/>
the <br/>
safety of their dark NYC apartments. The public assumed they must be wicked, <br/>
heartless city folk, but the experiment seemed to find otherwise -- that lack <br/>
of action is inevitable in a situation of such &quot;diffuse responsibility&quot; <br/>
(maybe <br/>
like schools spreading the accountability among too many programs and <br/>
professionals for any one to get the job done?)<br/>
       <br/>
       And now I&#39;m reading the part about how individuals respond to cries <br/>
for help when they believe no one is in charge (similar to, but also <br/>
different <br/>
from Milgram, in which a single authority was right on the spot and calmly in <br/>
control of everything.)<br/>
<br/>
       In other words, the emerging theory is that the situation can matter <br/>
much more than we&#39;d like to admit. I suspect this could be big news as <br/>
scientific support for independent unschooling, btw, as an optimal situation. <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Both of these were brought up at that Sociology class Cameron and I attended.<br/>
<br/>
In considering Milgram&#39;s experiment, I had to add my two cents worth: I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that ALL of the subjects had been schooled. So ALL of the subjects were <br/>
used to being told what to do by someone in authority (in the white lab coat) <br/>
and were used to following orders, no matter how inane. It was also done <br/>
during the Cold War when folks were rigidly following stupid orders.<br/>
<br/>
I think that----no, I KNOW that---I would have followed the instructions and <br/>
just done as I was told when I was in my teens and early twenties. Now that <br/>
wouldn&#39;t happen. I question more and am skeptical of a lot. I would think this <br/>
through a lot more and not be as swayed by the &quot;lab coat&quot; and the rules. <br/>
<br/>
I think that my sons----even at their young ages----would not follow the <br/>
rules like a blind rat just because someone says so. They question gentle things <br/>
*I* say! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I brought this up in class (surrounded by thirty college students who had <br/>
just spent 12-15 years in school! &lt;G&gt;), and the professor had never really <br/>
thought about that. That our Prussian attitude towards following rules, no matter <br/>
what, will win out in such situations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>of magic that inoculates our own children against their own deepest instincts <br/>
and responses. The best we can do, I&#39;m thinking, is to help them learn to <br/>
understand themselves and others and the world we all live in, and deal with <br/>
it <br/>
all.  JJ&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about that. I&#39;d love to see that experiment done on people who <br/>
haven&#39;t been raised in that environment. I think our deepest instincts and <br/>
responses are to DO something. I think that school rubs it out with all its rules <br/>
and &quot;follow-what-I-say-no-matter-what&quot; orders. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177850843">Quotes from book:<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;Not long after the initial experiments, Milgram and Elms went on a <br/>
hunt for personality traits that correlate with obedient or defiant behavior. <br/>
They did follow-up studies of their subjects, scrutinizing their lives and <br/>
psyches for clues as to who did what as why. This, understand, is a no-no in the <br/>
field of social psychology . . . so [two-thirds were obedient and the others <br/>
defied the experimenter and the situation] Why? WHY? This is a question no social <br/>
psychologist can answer. It is at this critical juncture where social <br/>
psychology breaks down . . .<br/>
<br/>
       ****************<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;In the mid-60s, Milgram and Elms called subjects back into the lab <br/>
and administered a series of personality tests. . . extensive one-on-one <br/>
interviewing, asking obedient and defiant subjects about their childhoods, their <br/>
relationships with their mothers and fathers . . .<br/>
<br/>
       &#39;Catholics were more obedient than Jews. We did find that,&#39; said Elms. <br/>
&#39;And the longer one&#39;s military experience, the more obedient.&#39; . . . They did <br/>
find that obedient subjects reported being less close to their fathers during <br/>
childhood than defiants did. As children, they found that obedients received <br/>
either spankings or very little punishment, whereas defiants had been punished <br/>
by severe beatings or some kind of deprivation -- dinner, perhaps . . . Most <br/>
obedients in the military admitted to shooting at men; defiants denied it.<br/>
<br/>
       When you look at this information what do you get? Not a whole lot. . <br/>
. . either the scale is wrong or the defiant and obedient have so many strands <br/>
in them we cannot cleanly sort it out.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139018325">I would also like to see that. I had also studied those experiments <br/>
in college. I always found them very interesting.  I would like to <br/>
read the book.  I also think that it is not only the schools that <br/>
teach children to blindly follow orders. In our society that is what <br/>
a &quot;good&quot; child should do.  Parents also play a big part in it, with <br/>
their attitudes of &quot;because I said so&quot; and so on. I was all ready to <br/>
teach my son to question authority, but even at four I can see I <br/>
don&#39;t need to.  I would really like to see a study on people, who <br/>
were brought up the way we are raising our children as well.  I do <br/>
think some of it is temperment, and some people are naturally more <br/>
questioning (and more skeptical) than others.  Should&#39;ve known I <br/>
would have a son that questions everything! LOL! I love it! - Tara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786798621">It was around this time that people started to question ethics with regard to human research subjects. After studies like this and the one done of a mock prison setting and a first or second grade classroom setting in the 70s when things started to become more stringent. Today in order to use human subjects in any sort of research you have to be approved by an institutional review board and have to jump through hoops in proving that there is more benefits than risks.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106010155">This exchange really highlights that there are two ways to think about <br/>
this: one is as social situation differences, and the other is as differences <br/>
between individuals. <br/>
<br/>
       The overall interpretation of all the experiments (as the author <br/>
describes it at least) is that individual differences like schooling or maturity or <br/>
confidence or compassion don&#39;t make nearly as much difference as we might <br/>
expect or want to believe. The book seems to show that situation differences need <br/>
more weight and thought than we tend to give them -- and to me, this might be <br/>
especially true for unschoolers, who focus on independence, self-reliance, <br/>
courage, swimming against the mainstream, et cetera. <br/>
<br/>
       That&#39;s why I brought it up here, to see if we as unschooler <br/>
non-conformist types can consider these social-situation variables *along with* personal <br/>
development variables, and maybe reach a higher level of understanding about <br/>
how they fit together (if they do fit-- I&#39;m still thinking and I haven&#39;t even <br/>
finished the book yet! &lt;grin&gt;)  JJ<br/>

It fits me and my sister.<br/>
There are other factors too, but if someone were JUST testing for that <br/>
factor, my sister and I would be supporting evidence.<br/>

&gt;pointed out to me years ago our cultural need to raise &quot;independent&quot; <br/>
&gt;children and wondered at the time what constitutes true <br/>
&gt;independence - his point being that the ability to depend on one <br/>
&gt;another is not a hindrance and can perhaps serve us better as human <br/>
&gt;beings.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a very wide way of looking at independence. This <br/>
reminds me of a scene from a movie I&#39;ve been watching this week -<br/>
 28 Days Later. In the movie, a killer virus wipes out most of the <br/>
population of England, and one of the themes among the survivors is <br/>
how much they need each other. One of the survivors dreams that he <br/>
wakes up and the other survivors have left him alone. You can see in <br/>
his panic just how much we need other humans for survival. Almost <br/>
none of us is truly &quot;independent&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
As for my kids, I hope they achieve the level of independence that <br/>
they need at any given time, and that it&#39;s true independence and not <br/>
reactionary independence. I began moving out of my parent&#39;s home at <br/>
age 16, and declared myself independent from them for financial and <br/>
other reasons. At times, I lived on the street rather than ask them <br/>
for money or assistance. That&#39;s what I mean by reactionary <br/>
independence, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s healthy. It was more of <br/>
a &quot;I&#39;ll show them I don&#39;t need them&quot; kind of a thing. I&#39;d like to <br/>
think that if my kids every really *need* us, they&#39;ll come to us for <br/>
help. And that when they don&#39;t need us, they&#39;ll be happy taking care <br/>
of themselves at whatever age that is. I like that at the ages they <br/>
are now, they&#39;re around us so much that they&#39;re learning many of the <br/>
skills you really need to be independent (how to cook, shop, make <br/>
phone calls, interact with people in the general public) just by <br/>
being in the real world in the daytime instead of sequestered away in <br/>
an artificial environment. I had to learn most of that stuff by trial <br/>
and error when I was already on my own.<br/>
