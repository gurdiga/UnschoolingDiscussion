<div id="ygrps-yiv-755091094">This is from Escaping Education by Madhu Suri Prakash and Gustavo Esteva <br/>
  (Peter Lang Publishing, 1998).  Esteva has a knack for taking little <br/>
  individualized acts resistance and turning them into political issues. <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Years ago, some of us campaigned for legislation imposing ten years of <br/>
  jail upon anyone demanding a diploma to qualify for work.  [This was in <br/>
  Mexico.]  In the debates generated by these campaigns, the central <br/>
  conclusion was that most students will abandon education once diplomas <br/>
  become an illegal currency.  These debates revealed the extended <br/>
  awareness of the people that schools and universities are not really <br/>
  places for learning useful skills or for &#39;socialization&#39;--as it is <br/>
  called.  They are principally places for procuring diplomas, which <br/>
  guarantee nothing in terms of skillfulness or hard work and responsible <br/>
  character yet still carry the illusion of avoiding grim diaster. <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;After our failures at making diplomas illegal, we have sought to <br/>
escape <br/>
  them by following other routes in the exact opposite direction: we now <br/>
  give diplomas to anyone learning any useful skill--especially those <br/>
  mastered autonomously in a matter of a few hours of study with a <br/>
  non-expert.  After three days in our workshop[s on dry latrines, for <br/>
  example, young people now receive a big, beautiful diploma certifying <br/>
  them as &quot;Experts in Alternative Sanitation.&quot;  If you cannot beat them, <br/>
  join them, they say.  One possible route for escaping the diploma game <br/>
  is through its multiplication--thus widening access to those who do not <br/>
  want to or cannot attend school.  Our three-day diplomas and other <br/>
  certificates offer immediate access to creative and profitable <br/>
  occupations.  We have received support for our endeavors from the <br/>
system <br/>
  of &#39;open education&#39; created by the government for &#39;adult learners.&#39; <br/>
  Students can receive certification equivalent to three to six years in <br/>
a <br/>
  few months of study in community workshops we have participated in at <br/>
  the grassroots.&quot; <br/>

It may very well equal out to the same thing! I don&#39;t think many are willing <br/>
to admit all the time and money they have spent couldv&#39;e been done in a <br/>
fraction of that time and money!  Lori in TX</div>

 </span></blockquote>I for years have offered to make up official-looking degree certificates<br/>
for any of my friends who want them.  They can make up the name of the<br/>
University, the degree they want, even who they want to sign it.  I will<br/>
usually provide a Latin gloss on the document (the most popular is the<br/>
latin for &quot;No one but me knows when my shoe hurts.&quot;)  Some of them have<br/>
my Ph.D.s and M.A.s and M.S.s hanging proudly in their offices.  I make<br/>
no claim about their veracity (other than the fact that they asked me<br/>
for them), and they can use them anyway they wish.<br/>
<br/>
The long-time Philadelphia Superintendent of Schools DR. Michael Marcase<br/>
had a mail-order degree.  When it was revealed, he was supported by the<br/>
Board of Education, which basically said that if he hadn&#39;t earned the<br/>
degree traditionally he sure deserved it by now!  (Philadelphia schools<br/>
were the worst in the country!<br/>
<br/>
I am also ordained in the Universal Life Church -- which gives me the<br/>
right to make anyone else a minister, a pope, a rabbi, or a saint, a<br/>
metropolitan or anything else one might choose -- and I actually have<br/>
conducted two marriages, one over a 1-800 line, duly certified by the<br/>
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I refuse to accept money for either of these services.  Having earned<br/>
&gt; more than my share of degrees &quot;the traditional way&quot;, I have to say<br/>
&gt; that the degrees themselves aren&#39;t worth any more than the ones I<br/>
&gt; offer  -- except that most of those I end up handing out are to people<br/>
&gt; with more useful experience, and are done with a lot more love.<br/>
