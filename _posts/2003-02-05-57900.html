<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733816511">I haven&#39;t participated in this group in some time, it&#39;s hard to keep <br/>
up, it&#39;s so busy! I am happy to report we are still unschooling, <br/>
after pulling my daughter from fourth grade last February. It has <br/>
taken faith and patience. At one point she planned on returning to <br/>
school, but has changed her mind. In the past few months she has <br/>
really taken charge of her learning, taken some real initiative, and <br/>
I admit it&#39;s a big relief that she has been gravitating towards <br/>
schoolish subjects. Right now it&#39;s anatomy (a big human body project <br/>
she is working on) and geometry. She still never finishes a book that <br/>
she starts, but neither do I! I have sat back nervously while she <br/>
seemed to waste days watching tv, now she has decided she likes it <br/>
better when we don&#39;t even turn it on anymore. I think she is finally <br/>
past the habit of waiting for me to spoonfeed her knowledge. It is so <br/>
exciting watching this process! She has also made big changes in <br/>
keeping herself and her bedroom organized and some other behavioral <br/>
issues that she had. I really believe that a job well done is reward <br/>
in itself, and bribing and nagging is just ineffective. She is not <br/>
the same child she was when I pulled her from school. Our <br/>
relationship and her confidence has improved so much, and so has mine <br/>
&lt;g&gt;. Thank God i had a child who had the school allergy and gave me <br/>
reason to look beyond compulsive schooling. Here&#39;s to <br/>
unschooling!!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391809158">It sounds wonderful!  Brianna likes TV, at night. She loves Law & Order. At<br/>
first I was concerned. Now, it&#39;s cool!  We discuss law, justice, and<br/>
fairness; last evening we discussed &#39;blurring&#39; the law as a way of getting<br/>
&#39;justice&#39;. She also is aware that Law & Order calls upon a host of New York<br/>
actors. She can spot the gray areas in search & seizure. We talk about each<br/>
case as it starts unfolding. Last night, as soon as she saw the victim, she<br/>
said &quot;blow to the head&quot; and then she said, &quot;She was a victim on this show<br/>
before&quot;.  She has started to read a bit about animals & the law. And she&#39;s<br/>
putting together a list of places that have strong animal protection laws.<br/>
Now, we&#39;re going to walk the dog.<br/>
Take care,<br/>
