        -- Views from the world of learning in Japan --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the 11 June 2000 edition of KnoK (pronounced &quot;knock&quot;) NEWS, an <br/>
informal and periodic bulletin concerning issues of learning in Japan. It <br/>
is brought to you by the Covert family -- Kazumi, Kenya and Brian -- a <br/>
multicultural, homelearning family in Osaka, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
KnoK stands for *Kodomo no Kokoro*, meaning &quot;Heart of a Child&quot; in <br/>
Japanese. It is our belief that the heart of any child is indeed at the <br/>
center of true learning, wherever and however such learning may take <br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
EDITOR&#39;S WELCOME:  Once again, greetings everybody! The humid summer heat <br/>
is already well upon us in parts of Japan, and with the approach of <br/>
summer come the usual thoughts of vacations, festivals and the getting <br/>
together of friends, old and new. It is in this spirit that we bring you <br/>
our feature this time: an introduction to Japan-based homelearning <br/>
families on the Web.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you will take some time and enjoy browsing around the websites <br/>
and homepages you see here, whether they be in English or Japanese. <br/>
There&#39;s no better way to get acquainted with the homelearning community <br/>
here in Japan, a community that is small in number (2,000 to 3,000 <br/>
homelearners nationwide, by unofficial estimates) but large in spirit. <br/>
You&#39;ll find sites here from various parts of Japan, and each site as <br/>
unique as the family or group that put it together.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted, however, that not all of the families included here <br/>
are &quot;technically&quot; homelearners. In Japan, there are thousands of <br/>
schoolchildren who, for whatever reason, have decided they will not go to <br/>
school. This is known as *fu-toko* (&quot;school avoidance&quot; or &quot;school <br/>
nonattendance&quot;). *Fu-toko* is more or less a state of &quot;educational limbo&quot; <br/>
in which a child stays at home to avoid school, with the idea that, <br/>
sooner or later, she/he will probably be placed back into the mainstream <br/>
school system once things are smoothed over.<br/>
<br/>
This is different from homelearning in Japan, which involves a family&#39;s <br/>
formal declaration to learn at home independently of school, not just <br/>
staying at home to avoid school. In any case, since *fu-toko* sometimes <br/>
is the starting point for families in Japan to discover and embrace <br/>
homelearning, we wanted to respect that by including the voices of some <br/>
prominent *fu-toko* families here as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, is homelearning a workable educational choice in Japan? Most <br/>
definitely, yes. But don&#39;t just take our word for it: Look here at what <br/>
some Japanese homelearners themselves are doing on the Web -- and with <br/>
their lives. They are proof positive (if any were needed) that <br/>
homelearning can be done in Japan, and be done well. These families and <br/>
organizations are part of a living, breathing community of home-based <br/>
learners in Japan that is slowly but steadily rising in number and, as <br/>
time goes on, learning the value of networking and uniting. These are <br/>
people who are helping to change the face of Japanese education forever <br/>
in their own humble ways.<br/>
 <br/>
Feel free to pass this info around and share it with others. If you come <br/>
across any Japanese or Japan-based homelearning families on the Web that <br/>
we may have missed, let us know and we promise to follow it up in a <br/>
future edition of KnoK NEWS. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, and in the spirit of summer, enjoy!<br/>
<br/>

          ON THE WEB WITH HOMELEARNING FAMILIES IN JAPAN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(1) HOMESCHOOLING IN JAPAN  (english)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.gol.com/users/milkat/index.html">http://www2.gol.com/users/milkat/index.html</a><br/>
Your &quot;one-stop support network&quot; for home-based learning in Japan: This is <br/>
by far the most comprehensive resource guide and gathering place on the <br/>
Web for Japanese and foreign-resident homelearners in Japan. The <br/>
webmaster is Katherine Combs, originally from the US (Seattle, <br/>
Washington) and now doing home-based learning with her family in Tokyo. <br/>
Says Combs: &quot;&#39;Homeschooling in Japan&#39; was created to bring together home <br/>
learners through monthly outings, and encourages families to get involved <br/>
in helping plan social/learning opportunities for our children.&quot; The <br/>
site&#39;s newsletter, discussion list and other resources are handled by <br/>
homelearning parent Aileen Kawagoe, originally from Singapore and now <br/>
living in Japan with her family in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture. The <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling in Japan&quot; website is also mentioned in the book &quot;Japan For <br/>
Kids: The Ultimate Guide for Parents and Their Children&quot; by Diane <br/>
Wiltshire and Jeanne Huey (Kodansha International, 2000), a new edition <br/>
of which has just hit the bookstores.<br/>
<br/>
(2) HOME SCHOOLING NETWORK - HIMEJI  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2h.biglobe.ne.jp/~hsn-hime/">http://www2h.biglobe.ne.jp/~hsn-hime/</a><br/>
Website of an independent support group headed by Tomiko Kugai of Himeji, <br/>
Hyogo Prefecture. A respected homelearning advocate in Japan, Kugai has <br/>
been homelearning with her daughter for about six years now. We are proud <br/>
to have featured Kugai&#39;s two-part &quot;Q & A on Homeschooling in Japan&quot; in <br/>
recent editions of KnoK NEWS. Her homelearning activities have also been <br/>
covered in Japanese TV news programs, and in magazine and newspaper <br/>
articles. She puts out a printed version of her support group&#39;s <br/>
newsletter as well.<br/>
<br/>
(3) HOME SCHOOLING NETWORK - MICHIKUSA  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www09.u-page.so-net.ne.jp/tj8/hsn-miti/">http://www09.u-page.so-net.ne.jp/tj8/hsn-miti/</a><br/>
Website of an independent support group led by Kimiyo Matsuura, a <br/>
homelearning parent based in rural Toyono-cho, Osaka Prefecture. Matsuura <br/>
is one of several contributing authors of a Japanese book published in <br/>
1999, titled *Warau Fu-toko* (literally: &quot;Happy Without School&quot;), which <br/>
extolls the virtues of children not attending school in Japan. Matsuura <br/>
and her son each regularly put out printed versions of homelearning <br/>
newsletters as well. (&quot;Michi-kusa,&quot; by the way, is a Japanese expression <br/>
meaning to take one&#39;s time and smell the roses along the way.)<br/>
<br/>
(4) HOTTO RUUMU [HOT ROOM]  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aay.mtci.ne.jp/~shine/kimiko/">http://www.aay.mtci.ne.jp/~shine/kimiko/</a><br/>
Website hosted by Kimiko Saito of Fukushima Prefecture, parent of a <br/>
*fu-toko* child who was enrolled in, and has since graduated from, the <br/>
home-based education program of Clonlara School in Ann Arbor, Michigan in <br/>
the US. Saito also is one of the contributing authors of the *Warau <br/>
Fu-toko* book mentioned above. (The Chinese kanji characters for this <br/>
website&#39;s name, &quot;hot-to-ruu-mu,&quot; are also a play on words, roughly <br/>
meaning &quot;a person walking carefree in a dream.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
(5) IKUTA FAMILY GA YUKU [HERE COMES THE IKUTA FAMILY]  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~iku/">http://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~iku/</a><br/>
Meet the Ikuta homelearning family from the city of Kobe, Hyogo <br/>
Prefecture. They&#39;ve set up a colorful, creative website to introduce <br/>
themselves and some of the things they love doing together. The main page <br/>
features a simple animated cartoon, so it takes a bit of time to load. <br/>
But stick around: The rest of the site features lots of artwork and nice, <br/>
clear photos. (Don&#39;t leave without checking out the cool shots of the <br/>
frogs!)<br/>
<br/>
(6) IO [&quot;ee-oh&quot;]  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.itoh.org/io/">http://www.itoh.org/io/</a><br/>
Website set up by Miyoshi Itoh of Tokyo and Yuko Inoue of Saitama <br/>
Prefecture, both parents of *fu-toko* children. Heavy emphasis in this <br/>
website on children&#39;s rights and other human rights. Itoh, who spent two <br/>
years living in Denmark with her children, has written about their <br/>
experiences there in an extended series of articles for the Tokyo <br/>
Shimbun, a major metro daily newspaper in Japan&#39;s capital city. Both Itoh <br/>
and Inoue are contributing authors of the *Warau Fu-toko* book mentioned <br/>
in listing #3 above. (And now, for those who are interested, a nonschool <br/>
quiz: The name of this website, &quot;Io,&quot; comes from both (1) the name of a <br/>
woman loved by which mythological Greek deity? AND (2) the name of a <br/>
volcanically active moon affiliated with which planet of the solar <br/>
system?)   [Answers to be found further down in this newsletter.]   <br/>
<br/>
(7) KODOMO ISHA [CHILDREN&#39;S DOCTOR]  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~dw3r-isbs/ryoko.html">http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~dw3r-isbs/ryoko.html</a><br/>
Website of Ryoko Ishibashi, a Tokyo-based pediatrician and parent of a <br/>
*fu-toko* child. This site includes info about Dr. Ishibashi&#39;s personal <br/>
experiences as a parent of a school avoider in Japan, backed up with lots <br/>
of other professional childcare advice to parents from her position as a <br/>
medical specialist. Dr. Ishibashi is yet another of the contributing <br/>
authors of the *Warau Fu-toko* book listed above in #3.<br/>
<br/>
(8) KUBO HOMESCHOOL FAMILY  (japanese)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.seaple-n.icc.ne.jp/~yoshikok/">http://www.seaple-n.icc.ne.jp/~yoshikok/</a><br/>
Website of Yoshiko Kubo, one of the veterans of the homelearning <br/>
community in Japan. She lives in Narashino, Chiba Prefecture, located <br/>
about 30 minutes from Tokyo. Kubo has been homelearning in Japan with her <br/>
two children, ages nine and 12, from the beginning. Her website includes <br/>
a report on her family&#39;s travels last summer to Canada and the United <br/>
States, where they enjoyed staying with other homelearning families. More <br/>
recently, Kubo appeared as a panelist at a symposium in Tokyo on 3 June <br/>
to help introduce homelearning as a positive alternative to conventional <br/>
schools in Japan. She also regularly puts out two printed newsletters in <br/>
Japanese -- one by the &quot;Sweet Heart&quot; social childcare network she heads, <br/>
and another called &quot;LIVE&quot; (as in &quot;live and learn&quot;) that specifically <br/>
covers homelearning matters. And Kubo has self-published a book titled <br/>
*Kodomo wa Asobi no Tensai* (&quot;Children are Geniuses at Playing&quot;), which <br/>
introduces some of her and her children&#39;s homelearning adventures. Busy, <br/>
busy!  <br/>
<br/>
(9) MISAWA HOME EDUCATORS SUPPORT GROUP  (english)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.xoom.com/MHESG/">http://members.xoom.com/MHESG/</a><br/>
Website of the 35th Support Group, a Christian-oriented homelearning <br/>
support network in Japan for US military and civilian families stationed <br/>
at the Misawa Air Base in Misawa, Aomori Prefecture. This site includes <br/>
sections on homelearning resources and curriculums. (Note: You may <br/>
encounter, as we did, several errors in the loading of this particular <br/>
website.)<br/>
<br/>
(10) MUKAI FAMILY TIMES  (english)<br/>
--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/mukaifamilytimes/homeschooling.html">http://members.tripod.com/mukaifamilytimes/homeschooling.html</a><br/>
Christian-oriented homelearning website of Katheryn Mukai and family, <br/>
currently living in Tokyo. Though Mukai says the site is in need of <br/>
updating and that her family will be leaving Japan soon for Raleigh, <br/>
North Carolina, we are nevertheless happy to include her &quot;Mukai Family <br/>
Times&quot; here. Katheryn Mukai is originally from the United States and has <br/>
10 years of homelearning under her belt, in both the US and Japan, with <br/>
her three children. She also helped with the launching of the <br/>
&quot;Homeschooling in Japan&quot; website (see listing #1 above) and has been an <br/>
active contributor to that site. We will miss having the Mukai family in <br/>
Japan, but look forward to maybe seeing a &quot;Stateside edition&quot; of the <br/>
Mukai Family Times in the future! <br/>
<br/>

--&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lain.ais.ne.jp/~iris1226/">http://www.lain.ais.ne.jp/~iris1226/</a><br/>
Website of Yumi Matsushima of Tokyo, parent of a *fu-toko* child. Tons of <br/>
links to be found throughout Matsushima&#39;s site, including to her &quot;Museum <br/>
of Rainbow&quot; section, where she displays artwork, and her new &quot;World of <br/>
Iris&quot; section featuring her own poetry in Japanese. For those who like <br/>
some simple music to go with their browsing, there is a link to that too! <br/>
Matsushima is another of the contributing authors of the *Warau Fu-toko* <br/>
book mentioned above in listing #3.   <br/>
<br/>

             WISH I&#39;D SAID THAT  (Quote of the Day):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[E]ducation is not achieved when you have completed college. It is <br/>
happening every moment. The Western system has emphasized the <br/>
achievement, the success. And I say to students, seek not success, but <br/>
seek fulfillment.&quot;   <br/>
