<br/>
Nick has had a friend who&#39;s also a girl from a summer farm camp for a few <br/>
years.  He&#39;s now 12.  He and I have talked a lot about love and relationships <br/>
-- the expectations and realities of engaging someone&#39;s heart and the <br/>
relationship between physical and emotional responses.  The pressure to <br/>
&quot;mature&quot; in this area some kids discover in school -- the teasing and <br/>
encouragement, the games of who likes who and steps along the way to social <br/>
and physical maturity.<br/>
<br/>
He and his friend have chatted via im for several years -- spent time at each <br/>
other&#39;s houses.  We&#39;ve done things as families -- movies, ice skating, <br/>
museums.  They&#39;ve exchanged Christmas presents for two years -- he&#39;s also <br/>
given presents to friends who are boys.<br/>
<br/>
She is now pressuring him to declare himself her boyfriend, saying that she&#39;d <br/>
feel better at school if she could say she had one.  He is not interested in <br/>
that status or in exploring that part of himself at this stage, feels <br/>
uncomfortable about her insistence, and is backing off from the relationship. <br/>
 It&#39;s sad, really, because he has worked to be a good friend, and feels a bit <br/>
helpless in the face of this.  He has been surprised by some of the things <br/>
she&#39;s done to be accepted at school, and this is another in that vein.  I&#39;m <br/>
glad he&#39;s being true to himself and not caving in to the &quot;help me fit in&quot; <br/>
argument.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also glad he can talk to me about it.<br/>

I may be more nervous about this because there was an incident in our area<br/>
recently where a teenage girl was found tied up in some guy&#39;s apartment.<br/>
She met him on the internet.  Another reason is my dh is really convinced<br/>
that you must protect your identity from people on the internet.  He<br/>
wouldn&#39;t even let me put my whole last name for my identity.  He is<br/>
convinced that those of you who show your names are using fake names!  Well<br/>
are you?<br/>
<br/>
My dd&#39;s both chose boys names when giving themselves email ids.  They also<br/>
said they were 32 year olds.  It was pretty funny the first time they<br/>
emailed Grandma and she had no idea who the email was from before opening<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Girls are tied up by clergy, coaches, brothers, fathers, teachers,<br/>
policemen, and plenty of other people not met on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a claim that the internet is without danger. And the easy<br/>
anonymity is definitely something for us and our children to know,<br/>
understand, respect and keep in mind when forming any relationships here.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t try to protect my identity from people on the internet. My real<br/>
legal name is Pamela Denise Hartley, my e-mail address reflects that. I own<br/>
a home business that is based on internet-only sales and I give out my real<br/>
name and address every single day.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters really are named Brittany and Michael-Anne, as I write about<br/>
them here and other places on line. My husband&#39;s name really is Wally<br/>
(Wallace) and my dog&#39;s name is Penny and my cat&#39;s name is Blue. I really<br/>
live in Tracy, California, in a real townhouse with real mini-blinds. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If weird freaky stalkers are going to come after me or mine, they can find<br/>
us in any number of ways, including following us home as we walk from the<br/>
library (which we really sometimes do).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t live life by worst-case scenario. There are no worse boogey-men on<br/>
the internet than there are at the local Safeway.<br/>
<br/>
My husband works with a citizens group in town that does a lot of support<br/>
and other stuff with the local police department. In one of the training<br/>
courses he took, he found out how many registered sex offenders live in our<br/>
nice, safe town (hundreds, in a town of 60,000 and remember that&#39;s just the<br/>
ones registering).<br/>
<br/>
There are good and bad people everywhere.<br/>

I agree about all that lack of paranoia.<br/>
<br/>
My name and address have been published in local, regional and international <br/>
SCA publications off and on (mostly on) since I was 24 years old.    But I&#39;ve <br/>
never had an unlisted phone number.  For a buck or whatever your phone <br/>
company will charge you, you could find out my phone number and street <br/>
address.  Plug it into Mapquest and get directions from your house.<br/>
<br/>
That is just the way it has been my whole life.  I&#39;ve never hidden, and I&#39;ve <br/>
never been stalked, and stalkers will find people who are hiding carefully <br/>
and have body guards, if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the paranoia.<br/>

I do think caution is in order when meeting internet friends in real <br/>
life.  The common advice for young people is that the meeting should take <br/>
place in a public place, possibly with parents nearby for the younger ones <br/>
anyway.  That&#39;s going to rule out the people who are pretending to be <br/>
someone completely different than they are.  That said, I&#39;ve met a lot of <br/>
my internet friends in real life.  It&#39;s one of my favorite things, seeing <br/>
how they match up with my preconceived notions of what they&#39;ll be like.<br/>
