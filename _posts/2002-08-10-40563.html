 </span></blockquote>Comics are great reading! I made my list of books Moly likes earlier. I asked <br/>
her if she would suggest anything else. She said she loves all her books on <br/>
tape. I forgot about those!!! Many kids don&#39;t like to read, or don&#39;t read <br/>
well enough to like it. Books on tape are great. The book is read to you, <br/>
while you follow along (or don&#39;t) this is a great help for wanting to read a <br/>
book of interest, that might be beyond the ability. Along this vein, turn on <br/>
the closed captioning option (if you have it) on your TV. We turned it on a <br/>
few years ago, and the kids (seem to) benefit from it. I also recommend some <br/>
magazines. Cobblestone publishing puts out some great kids magazines. Moly <br/>
gets Spider, and the new science mag, ASK. Both kids get Highlights as a gift <br/>
sub. from my Mom. Both Moly and Jack love their gaming magazines as well. And <br/>
we have had a request for the kids version of National Geographic. I had that <br/>
one when I was a kid, I hope they still publish it.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
