<div id="ygrps-yiv-957594698">amy,<br/>
maybe you and some others with an understanding of chiro can help me see what <br/>
the justification for birth being so traumatic is?  how can something so <br/>
natural by design cause such havoc on the system?  what did people do before <br/>
chiropractic?  i have heard this before but it has never made sense to me and <br/>
i am willing to listen...  also, why the continual adjustments?  what do we <br/>
keep doing to ourselves in the course of our days where we&#39;d need to keep <br/>
going and going to keep getting adjusted?  i guess the thought of being so <br/>
dependent is unappealing, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569512182">I just wanted to say something about Chiropractic care<br/>
<br/>
My son often woke in the middle of the night with leg pains.  He also <br/>
had problems during the day with his feet.  Then when my son jumped <br/>
into one of those ball pits he hurt his ankle and could not walk.  <br/>
Our homeopath suggested we take him to a chiropractor.  They did an <br/>
adjustment on him and it was amazing.  He felt better right away.  <br/>
Then the next week when he was jumping around as he loves to do he <br/>
later said he felt fuzzy in his leg.  We went the following day and <br/>
when Sam got on the table she could even see which leg was out of <br/>
alignment.  My son has such better health do to his visits to a <br/>
chiropractor.<br/>
<br/>
Also there are different methods we use the Activator method.<br/>

Here is something from a Chiropractor in Texas <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.babycottagehealth.com/">http://www.babycottagehealth.com/</a><br/>
Go to the heading<br/>
Kids and Chiropractic<br/>
As a concerned parent, you want the best for your child and no doubt <br/>
wonder if your child is as healthy as he or she could be. Several <br/>
factors determine your child  &#39;²s overall health. These include:<br/>
diet, <br/>
exercise, proper rest, emotional and spiritual support, and a <br/>
properly functioning nerve system.<br/>
<br/>
A major component for health is the communication between your <br/>
child  &#39;²s brain and body. This vital link controls the growth,<br/>
repair, <br/>
& function of every tissue and organ. The spinal cord sends messages <br/>
from the brain throughout the body via billions of nerves. <br/>
Interference (nerve pressure or irritation) places the body in a <br/>
state of disharmony. This can lead to decreased immune function and <br/>
sickness.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the birthing process itself, our bodies are subjected <br/>
to many spinal traumas. Even the most natural of births can cause <br/>
stress and strain to the tiny developing spine. This initial damage <br/>
can be compounded when the child is developing proper head support <br/>
and learning to sit up, crawl, stand and walk. During this time of <br/>
rapid spinal growth, these bumps and falls can be the cause of many <br/>
unexplained health problems.........................(go to the site <br/>
