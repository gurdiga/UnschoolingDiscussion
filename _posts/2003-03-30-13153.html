the parent, and I have more of a reserve of patience than she does.  I&#39;m<br/>
the parent, so I can step back and change how I&#39;m acting more easily<br/>
than she can.  When Rowan wants me to get up for the hundreth time to<br/>
get her something in the kitchen, I remember that I&#39;m the parent, and<br/>
she can&#39;t do everything she wants to without asking for help.  I can<br/>
make her feel good or bad about that.  I&#39;m the parent, and I can choose<br/>
to happily help her when she wants me to.  When either one of them wants<br/>
me to drop what I&#39;m doing to do something with her, I remember that I&#39;m<br/>
the parent of two kids who won&#39;t be kids forever.  I remember that I<br/>
don&#39;t want to miss one minute of being their parent. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting this, Rue.  A good reminder for ME.  Dh and I try very<br/>
hard to do this, but I find myself sometimes feeling like I&#39;ve waited on<br/>
them hand and foot all day, and the second I sit down to do something for me<br/>
(watch the news, read a book) they keep right on with their requests.  Mind<br/>
you, my kids are 8 & 4 and are capable of doing things for themselves (the 4<br/>
yr old was getting his own food and getting dressed on his own at 2 (his<br/>
choice - very independent and determined) but lately they won&#39;t do anything<br/>
for themselves at all.<br/>
<br/>
Somedays I feel taken advantage of and drained by it all and wonder if those<br/>
other &quot;controlling&quot; parents are right.<br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;re not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812503211">I think it helps me that I really vividly remember being a kid.  I<br/>
remember that no other peanut butter toast tastes just like my mom&#39;s<br/>
does.  It may have been the exact amount of golden brown-ness she gave<br/>
the toast, or the perfect, not too thin, not too thick layer of peanut<br/>
butter, or the way she cut it into special shapes for me and put it on a<br/>
tray.  But really it&#39;s that all of those things made me feel loved. When<br/>
my kids ask me to do something that they &#39;can&#39; do for themselves, I know<br/>
that it&#39;s not only a glass of chocolate milk they want - it&#39;s me,<br/>
putting it in a special cup with a special straw and delivering it to<br/>
them with a kiss. It&#39;s me showing them I love them.  We all try to keep<br/>
in mind that love is a verb. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it CAN be very draining.  When my I am feeling that<br/>
way, my husband will step in and nurture me, as well as dealing with the<br/>
kids&#39; needs for a while. (Of course, I&#39;ll do the same for him.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had confirmation this last weekend that they aren&#39;t right.  We are at <br/>
a camp with about 6 or so other families and a few other couples, no <br/>
kids.  It was sad, because most of the families were not &quot;mindful&quot; <br/>
parents (as one mom, who was mindful, said).  They were controlling. <br/>
 Janene and Lexie ruled the roost.  At the talent show, Janene was the <br/>
youngest to perform, and Lexie directed the other two in a skit she had <br/>
seen on Zoom.  She also had a &quot;rock&quot; show where she described rocks they <br/>
had found as other things &quot;this rock looks like a piano, this one looks <br/>
like a bed for a baby, this one is a door stop.&quot;  It was very cute and <br/>
funny, but Lexie was feeding the other kids their lines, and was <br/>
obviously at ease in front of a bunch of people while the other kids <br/>
were nervous.  Lexie and Janene made lots of friends, talked to <br/>
everyone, introduced themselves, were quite at ease in a situation where <br/>
they really didn&#39;t know anyone.  The other kids were obviously not as <br/>
relaxed nor did they seem to possess the ability to talk to people they <br/>
didn&#39;t know.  Everyone commented on how self assured and confident the <br/>
girls were.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone else also schooled, except for the one young mom with a 17 <br/>
month old--she was also the only one who was really open to <br/>
homeschooling.  One of the dads and his partner were both teachers, and <br/>
their son was in school.  Another mom and her partner (this was a <br/>
rainbow family camp, most of the attendees were gay, but not all) had a <br/>
7 year old who had serious developmental delays, didn&#39;t talk until 3, <br/>
and now is still pretty behind.  She was adopted from Brazil.  One of <br/>
the moms was a special ed teacher.  Lots of traditional school stuff. <br/>
 We didn&#39;t tell (have a chance, not that we witheld the info) that Lexie <br/>
and Janene were homeschooled, let alone unschooled, until after most <br/>
people had commented on how self assured, smart, etc. the girls were. <br/>
 So they really couldn&#39;t say that what we were doing wasn&#39;t working,a nd <br/>
you could tell that one man was a bit annoyed by this.  At first when we <br/>
were talking about homeschooling, I was saying things like &quot;with <br/>
homeschooling, you don&#39;t HAVE to have your child in school 7 hours a <br/>
day, plus 2-3 afternoons for homework help, and then still have them <br/>
come home and have another hour or two of homework.  You can help them <br/>
learn in just a few hours, and enjoy life.&quot;  They came up with the <br/>
normal &quot;most parents can&#39;t teach their children, the kids just learn <br/>
better from the authority of a teacher.&quot; bull shit as well as other <br/>
crap.  At one point they were saying that MOST kids NEED, MUST HAVE <br/>
repetition of facts, information, math, etc. to learn.  That they CANNOT <br/>
learn some things unless they do 100 math problems a day, read about <br/>
George Washington every year, etc.  I said I disagreed with that, and <br/>
talked about how many unschooled kids learn to read at age 9-10 and <br/>
never go through the primer reading stages, they simply go from not <br/>
really reading to being able to read whatever they want easily, no need <br/>
for repetitive phonics lessons.  Also, how Lexie has learned <br/>
multiplication by understanding the concept and when she needs to <br/>
memorize the facts she will, but knowing the concept is os much better <br/>
than just memorization.  Most of these parents just didn&#39;t get it.  The <br/>
poor little girl who was DD and 7, well, she can&#39;t remember her letters <br/>
from day to day.  Does she need to now? was a question these people had <br/>
never thought to even question, and so instead of spending their days <br/>
loving and being with their daughter, instead she spends it in a <br/>
classroom and in various special ed situations, and also she goes to <br/>
after school homework help 3x a week for another 1 1/2 horus a day. <br/>
 Amazing.  <br/>
<br/>
When I really did explain how lexie learns, they really couldn&#39;t get it <br/>
so I explained the example i always use (how she took Island of the Blue <br/>
Dolphins at age 6 from just reading the book to reading the sequel, <br/>
finding out about the author, the Chumas Indians, geography, islands, <br/>
catholic missions, the inslavement of the Chumash, driving to Santa <br/>
Barbara, etc. etc.) and their response was that Lexie and Janene are <br/>
remarkable children who are obviously gifted and they have a wonderful <br/>
mother who has a background in Education and was a teacher and so that <br/>
is why unschooling works for us, but that most kids could never learn <br/>
this way, and most kids need the structure of school and teachers and <br/>
homework.  I almost wanted to throw up.  I know Lexie and Janene are <br/>
remarkable (what kind of mother would I be if I didn&#39;t think that) but <br/>
their kids were pretty remarkable too.  One of the older kids overheard <br/>
some of this and later asked me how come Lexie could learn algebra stuff <br/>
at age 8, and when I explained how we learn in our house, he just said <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s really cool, wish I could do that.&quot; but his tone was such that <br/>
he obviously knew that he never would &quot;do that.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I tried to explain that one reason I really think school fails kids is <br/>
that it teaches kids that they can only learn in school and that they, <br/>
the kids, are not responsible for their learning but that they need to <br/>
just sit and let someone teach them.  Lexie doesn&#39;t think that, she is <br/>
responsible for her own learning and she sees learning as something that <br/>
happens all the time, and that learning is fun.  I think that might have <br/>
made an impression, but I&#39;m not sure.  I had just forgotten how totally <br/>
unmainstream I have become.  And I think that was the strangest thing to <br/>
me, here I was talking to lesbian moms, gay dads, one couple (no kids) <br/>
the one woman had obviously been born a male and she&#39;d been made <br/>
surgically a woman, and *I* was the one that was alternative in terms of <br/>
my parenting and education of my children.  They were so mainstream in <br/>
how they parented, how they educated their kids, it wasn&#39;t even funny. <br/>
 So controlling, strict bedtimes (even though we were at a camp), eat <br/>
your vegies, no you may not have pudding (how can you have any pudding <br/>
if you don&#39;t eat your meat!) (this was a real conversation, I kid you <br/>
not, which I overheard), I even overheard one mom threaten to spank.  I <br/>
just thought that within a community where parenthood was so much harder <br/>
to obtain that there would be parents who parented more thoughtfully, <br/>
but it seemed that at least with this limited control group that this <br/>
was not the case.  <br/>
<br/>
And what is really scary is that I will be back in the classroom, as a <br/>
teacher on Monday.  I have gotten a job, as a full time long term sub <br/>
for I&#39;m not sure what yet (I&#39;ll find out tomorrow).  I&#39;m glad to have a <br/>
job, I needed to have a job, but I&#39;m sad to have a job and not be at <br/>
home any longer and I&#39;m wondering how I will do in the classroom.  My <br/>
entire outlook on education has changed since I was a teacher last.  <br/>
<br/>
OK enough rambling...<br/>
<br/>
One very funny moment was when I was talking to the 70ish man with the <br/>
long gray/silver beard who was wearing a very pretty denim dress with <br/>
flowers down the front, and the other four year old came running up, in <br/>
a dress (I was in my jeans, as were my girls and most everyone else) and <br/>
he said &quot;I&#39;m sure glad to see someone else wearing a dress.&quot;  I kinda <br/>
chuckled and I said with the rock climbing that my girls were doing, <br/>
jeans were more appropriate for the activies of the camp.  We had a nice <br/>
conversation about dressing children and trying not to put our own <br/>
values into them, and he told me about his desire to wear dresses at a <br/>
very young age and his grandmother reading from the bible why his mother <br/>
couldn&#39;t wear slacks to work and how he knew that he probably shouldn&#39;t <br/>
tell his grandmother that he wanted to wear her dresses.  <br/>

<br/>
My mother criticised my parenting the other day.  She was telling me how <br/>
wrong she thought it was that my oldest son Jake, 20, had just recently moved <br/>
in with his fiance Mandy, 19, without the benefit of marriage.  First of all, <br/>
I&#39;m rolling my eyes anyway because these are the 00&#39;s, you know.  But I <br/>
really, really, REALLY wanted to ask her to compare the success of her method <br/>
of parenting (me pregnant before I was married, which was precisely what she <br/>
was hoping to avoid) with mine (Jake & Mandy in a committed relationship for <br/>
3 YEARS, no pregnancy in sight).  You know, that smartass (yet right on <br/>
target) comment that would have made her stop talking to me for a few months? <br/>
 I restrained myself, because I like talking to my mom, for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Surely some of those GLBT folks you met have had issues with the way they <br/>
were parented!  <br/>
