<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;Good question, Mary! &quot;What do you buy a kid that just had Christmas&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a friend whose oldest was born on Christmas day.  When she turned 1,<br/>
they announced that the party would be an &quot;and a half&quot; affair from here on<br/>
out.  June 25 they had a big bbq bash in the back yard, invited half the<br/>
town, and had at it.  She&#39;s 8, and still likes having a summer &quot;birthday&quot;.<br/>
I know that some years they&#39;ve done a big water park thing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an idea, if your child will buy the idea.<br/>

to me this year and said he is changing his birthday to June.  He is 5 now.  <br/>
So we are planning a party for June so he can have the pool party he wants.  <br/>

The queen&#39;s birthday is celebrated in June because the weather is better<br/>
for parades.  Her actual birthday falls at some less clement time in the<br/>
year.  <br/>
<br/>
(She&#39;d probably like a pool party, but the paparrazzi really put a<br/>
damper on that.)<br/>
