You turned me onto google and it has become a favorite haunt for my<br/>
daughter and me.  When we come across one of those &quot;I would like to find<br/>
out more about that&quot; moments we look at one another, grin and say<br/>
&quot;Google!&quot;.  The next space of time is taken up by the two of us huddled<br/>
around the computer munching on all the tidbits google has to offer.<br/>

<br/>
AND I own stock in public schools and socialism and agnosticism and <br/>
unschooling which is why I so ignorantly support them, just for my own <br/>
personal profit.  I&#39;m rich and getting richer.   So keep using google, keep <br/>
being ignorant and I will become a millionaire.   BWAAAAhahaaaaa...</div>
