<div id="ygrps-yiv-1700658251">Normally my dh would be home, he was injured on the job a year ago <br/>
and is not able to go back to work, but he has been helping a friend <br/>
out of a tight spot the past few days so has been unable to be home. <br/>
Usually he would take Avery out so that Jaiden and I could spend some <br/>
time together or he&#39;ll take Jaiden and they&#39;ll do something just the <br/>
two of them. The only kids around us, that we know, are the kids in <br/>
our apt. complex and they are very mean to Jaiden, so I&#39;m not <br/>
comfortable letting him spend much time with them.  Also the only <br/>
homeschoolers in my area, again that I know, are the school at home <br/>
type and they tend to schedual their days, on top of that today, is <br/>
the Park day that everyone goes to, I would be going but dh has the <br/>
car and it&#39;s to far of a bus ride (@2 hours yuck!) Hopefully things <br/>
will return to normal, what ever that is :-), soon.  Just wondering, <br/>
anyone in the San Diego area?<br/>
