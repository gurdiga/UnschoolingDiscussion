<div id="ygrps-yiv-18802143">Or that falling asleep with the TV isn&#39;t gentle.  We have a TV in our bedroom <br/>
and have a family bed. We watch TV before we fall asleep to unwind.  Our <br/>
sleep is gentle and peaceful.<br/>

We watch BC while we cuddle on the couch or rock in the rocking chair (we used to nurse<br/>
up until 3 weeks ago when he decided that he did not want to). I could not think of a more<br/>
gentle way to fall asleep...cuddled with or lying on top of one of his favorite people<br/>
and drifting off to sleep doing something that he loves.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that I found this list...I would have felt really guilty about letting him<br/>
fall asleep with me in front of the tv and would have missed out on some great memories.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re the only two.  :-)  I first encountered<br/>
unschooling when my older son was an infant.  I was on an attachment<br/>
parenting bulletin board and all these unschooling moms were talking<br/>
about the &quot;sensory enhanced&quot; homemade play dough they make for their<br/>
kids, and the fairy gardens they plant, complete with tiny fairy<br/>
furniture, and the many, many, MANY different things they build and<br/>
make.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think I stared at the screen in awe for about a week, thinking, &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
supposed to make sensory enhanced play dough?  Huh?&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
We have a box right now filled with pom-poms and feathers and wiggly<br/>
eyes and felt.  It&#39;s a nightmare.  And what&#39;s worse, he loves it and<br/>
constantly wants me to &quot;make stuff&quot; with him. <br/>

knitting drop-out, a woman whose husband sews better than she does. I <br/>
do bake though, I guess there&#39;s one thing in my favor ;-)<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have come to realize is that each of us brings gifts to <br/>
our children. Mine happen to be things like taking the kids camping, <br/>
hiking, biking, swimming, and finding all sorts of cool and <br/>
interesting stuff that my kids might be interested in doing. My gifts <br/>
do *not* include gluing googly eyes and bird feathers to styrofoam <br/>
pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
Sooooo, the great thing is that I have homeschooling mom friends who <br/>
*are* great at crafts, and when my kids play at their house they do <br/>
this kind of stuff. When they play at my house, we build forts or set <br/>
up Hot Wheel Car races or do something physical. We can take <br/>
advantage of each other&#39;s gifts.<br/>
<br/>
 Also there&#39;s a local resource center that&#39;s open to everyone and <br/>
they have every kind of craft supply imaginable. We go there and the <br/>
kids can create any sort of thing they want. Children&#39;s museums are <br/>
also good sources of crafty type stuff, as are community classes like <br/>
clay-play.<br/>

<br/>
  No. Count me in on that challenged postion too. Every time a holiday rolls around and the kids want to make stuff, I spend hours on the internet late at night in search of crafts I can comprehend!!!! Luckily they don&#39;t do it often. Christmas was a big one as they wanted to make gifts. It actually turned out great and I even enjoyed what they made. Valentines went by and so did St. Patricks day without them wanting to do crafts. Not sure about Easter either. Usually it&#39;s Halloween and Christmas that are big for them. Maybe they feel sorry for me and take it easy!!<br/>

We were looking at your webpage and my husband said, &quot;That&#39;s the skating<br/>
rink in Johnstown!!!&quot;  He&#39;s from Johnstown and his parents still live<br/>
there.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re from Johnstown or just happened to take a<br/>
picture at the skating rink there, but we&#39;re about a half hour from<br/>
there.  When we were first married, we lived in Newark, but we&#39;re in<br/>
Columbus now.  That would be cool if your daughter wanted to come over.<br/>
We also have a son who will be 2 in less than two weeks.  Your other<br/>
kids might like to play with him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We go there skating all the time. We are in Pataskala, southeast or so of <br/>
Johnstown, a 10 minute drive.  We went when the local school sponsored there <br/>
monthly skate, when a homeschooling group had a skate, when a cousin had a <br/>
birthday party there. We even went a few weeks ago on a sunday afternoon, <br/>
they have open skate. Anyhoo, Pataskala is 15 miles west of Newark, it is our <br/>
county seat. I am right smack between Newark and Columbus,  I got bored once <br/>
and used mapquest to see which stores were further, it&#39;s about even. I lived <br/>
in Newark in 1990, my freshman year at Ohio State I did a summer pre-quarter <br/>
and my first quarter there. I lived in the apartments behind the campus. I <br/>
grew up and graduated in Whitehall(suburb of Cols), and moved back there to <br/>
start my family. I have only been away from Whitehall and in Pataskala about <br/>
2 years. Ramble ramble, more than you ever wanted to know LOL<br/>

If you&#39;re from Whitehall, you&#39;re familiar with our area.  We&#39;re in a<br/>
part of Columbus that isn&#39;t Whitehall and isn&#39;t Reynoldsburg but seems<br/>
like it should be one or the other.  I also went to OSU (the main<br/>
campus).  We took the kids there a few weeks ago and my son wanted to<br/>
see art.  There was nothing at the Wexner Center.  Apparently<br/>
renovations were supposed to begin last July and haven&#39;t yet started.<br/>
They expect to begin renovations this July.<br/>
 <br/>
I know exactly where Pataskala is.  We go to Newark about as often as we<br/>
go &quot;into&quot; Columbus.  During the week we stay in the Reynoldsburg area,<br/>
but on weekends we either head over to the Dublin area or Newark.<br/>
Columbus has the zoo and an awesome library system.  Newark has the<br/>
arboretum and Indian Mound (we like the mall and the park both &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
When we buy a house, it will probably be somewhere in Licking County.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m from Wintersville, all the way over by the river.  Pittsburgh is<br/>
closer to my hometown than any Ohio city.<br/>
 <br/>
There are kajillions of places we could get together in the<br/>
Columbus/Newark area.  Let me know if you want to.<br/>

turning. I remember taking 10yo Megan when she was a baby and being so <br/>
disappointed that they cut down the lettered hedges that spell out the park <br/>
name to replant them. They were so huge, it reminded me of the maze in The <br/>
Shining.  Well, there about 4ft high now. We love Indian Mound mall, and <br/>
haven&#39;t been to the indian mound park yet. Megan wants to, we go down 30th <br/>
street and there is a golf course with fake mounds and she is interested. All <br/>
in due time. We do the zoo too, we have season passes. We also go to the <br/>
Reynoldsburg library/Brice road area a lot. We were there yesterday :0)<br/>
I think it would be great to get together! Wanna meet at Blacklick Woods <br/>
sometime? This weeks kinda busy, soccer practice is starting, we are going to <br/>
see Barney with the little kids tonight &lt;g&gt;, got a mall concert friday night, <br/>
and dh&#39;s birthday party this weekend. Thank goodness we are not always this <br/>
busy. Plus it&#39;s spring break for the school kids and everywhere is more <br/>
crowded than normal LOL. It&#39;s so cool to have people so close to hook up <br/>
with! <br/>

Sorry I didn&#39;t reply right away.  We got word that my little brother<br/>
will be gone longer than expected (he&#39;s a Marine and he&#39;s been gone<br/>
since July.  His wife had a baby in January that he&#39;s never seen yet,<br/>

your dh&#39;s birthday and the weekend after that is my son&#39;s birthday.<br/>

We just built a storage building {building another so in total we will have three ~ 5 of us live very small trailer} Well one of them wil  have all the crafts stuff in it and I just let them go it on their own. I can do crafts ok, but I&#39;d rather not hold em back. But it is so tight in here they couldn&#39;t do it as much as they would have liked. So I am storing SOME of my stuff out there but they have a big table {like one you&#39;d put in a living room}and boxes of material and craft stuff we have collected or been given when my husband&#39;s step-mom cleaned her attic.<br/>
<br/>
They come in now painted {the youngest had some of the clothing paint in her hair at the scalp ~ LOL ~ which does come out with conditioner and some time} and I don&#39;t even look out there to see the mess. I just ask them to clean things up at the end of their day. It has been a great addition for them and me. :)<br/>

Here&#39;s a book for all you craft-challenged folk out there. It&#39;s called<br/>
Discovering Great Artists by MaryAnn Kohl and Kim Solga. I bought it last<br/>
year and it is fantastic. Everything from impressionism to surrealism. The<br/>
activities are lots of fun. She has done a few other books as well,<br/>
Preschool Art has lots of edible art and Mudworks is great also.<br/>

Anyway...I too am a craft challenged person.  I HATE crafts!!!!  I<br/>
can&#39;t even wrap a xmas present!!  And my daughter LOVES crafts.  UGH!<br/>
I love the story about teh box of stuff and the kids who want their<br/>
parents to &quot;help make stuff&quot;. LOL, that would be us too.<br/>
<br/>
I have books on neat crafts and &quot;experiments&quot; and stuff.  I&#39;m finding<br/>
