<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944386898">Thank you ladies for your supportive posts about my posts. Robin is <br/>
right though. I was posting too much. I wasn&#39;t even saying much in <br/>
the posts the last day or so because I was trying to get to them all. <br/>
I&#39;ll continue posting, I&#39;ll just be a bit more picky about what I <br/>
post and how often. And I will privately email, huh Lucy? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
love, Valerie</div>
