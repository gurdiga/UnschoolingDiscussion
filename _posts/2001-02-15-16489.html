<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071321095"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Dont do anything drastic, yet. My husband is a<br/>
&gt;carpenter, and every part of my house is 1/2 finished.<br/>
&gt;He does beautiful work when paid, but here its more of<br/>
&gt;a hapless hobby, so beware! I hear this happens to<br/>
&gt;lots of women who think they have found the perfect<br/>
&gt;tradesman(husband,lol)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK. Good advice.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can hope that a kid of yours will show interest in carpentry...<br/>
then, voila... so many projects sitting their so ready to hand.<br/>
