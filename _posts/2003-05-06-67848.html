<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278383265">I&#39;m also new to the group and to homeschooling and wanted to add my &quot;two <br/>
cents&#39; worth&quot;!  I have fallen in love with the idea of unschooling (and have <br/>
begun implementation) because that is exactly how my daughter learns.  She <br/>
dives into a subject that interests her and becomes an expert.  If only I <br/>
had discovered this sooner!  I do love this group and am so glad I found <br/>
y&#39;all!!<br/>
