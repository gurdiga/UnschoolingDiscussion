&lt;&lt; To me, you either unschool or you don&#39;t.  No radical needed.<br/>
 Joanna &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree Joanna. Unfortunately, like you said, there is some confusion with <br/>
certain people about what it really means.<br/>
I only use the term to describe an unschooler that lets the unschooling <br/>
philosophy affect all areas of life. From letting children choose their food, <br/>
to bedtimes and beyond.<br/>
I don&#39;t even like the term unschooling, I prefer natural learning. But terms <br/>
can help people understand where you&#39;re coming from.<br/>
If unschooling is just about education, then radical unschooling is about <br/>
parenting.<br/>
Just my way of seeing it.<br/>

RADICAL UNSCHOOLING <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd expounds on how people learn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This is the &quot;office&quot; of Sandra Dodd, of Albuquerque. Mother of three ( Kirby 16b, Marty 13b, Holly 10g), some kind of writer, sort of a teacher, and occasionally a counselor, Sandra is found mostly on the message boards at www.unschooling.com in the Conversations with Sandra Dodd folder. A great site for new homeschoolers is the National Home Educators Network site. <br/>
SANDRA IN PERSON:<br/>
October 4-5, 2002, Houston, Texas<br/>
Oct 11-13, 2002, Columbia, South Carolina. <br/>

LEARNING ALL THE TIME<br/>
People learn by playing, thinking and amazing themselves. They learn while they&#39;re laughing at something surprising, and they learn while they&#39;re wondering &quot;What the heck is this!?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big John Holt fan. Even the book titles are informative and inspiring: Learning All the Time; Never Too Late; Teach Your Own. Here&#39;s a link to an interview with John Holt There is a discussion group for John Holt fans you can join called AlwaysLearning which can be joined by sending a blank e-mail to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> . <br/>
CAN IT WORK IN THE REAL WORLD?<br/>
If unschooling can&#39;t work in the real world, nothing at all can. People will say &quot;How will they learn algebra in the real world?&quot; Is there algebra in the real world? If not, why should it be learned? If so, why should it be separated artificially from its actual uses? &quot;Why?&quot; should always be the question that comes before &quot;What?&quot; and &quot;How?&quot; There is a Sesame Street book called Grover and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Museum. There is a &quot;things under the sea&quot; room and &quot;things in the sky&quot; room, but still each room is just a room in a museum, no windows, everything out of context. Then he opens a big door marked &quot;everything else in the whole wide world&quot; and goes out into the sunshine. There is unschooling. <br/>
NOT JUST FOR KIDS!<br/>
The way adults tend to learn things is the way people best learn--by asking questions, looking things up, trying things out, and getting help when it&#39;s needed. That&#39;s the way pre-school kids learn too (maybe minus the looking things up), and it is the way &quot;school-age&quot; kids can/should learn as well. Learning is internal. Teachers are lovely assistants at best, and detrimental at worst. &quot;Teaching&quot; is just presentation of material. It doesn&#39;t create learning. Artificial divisions of what is &quot;educational&quot; from what is considered NOT educational, and things which are &quot;for kids&quot; from things which are NOT for kids don&#39;t benefit kids or adults. Finding learning in play is like the sun coming out on a dank, dark day. <br/>

<br/>
 Articles and essays I&#39;ve written, and the HEM interview, are listed and linked here. This page is the cutting edge of this site, as it actually gets updated! There&#39;s a new article there right now on deschooling! <br/>
<br/>
 Unschooling articles tending toward spiritual matters, by Nancy Wooton, Richard Prystowsky, Carol Rice, Kathy Ward and myself.<br/>
 A collection of accounts of later readers to encourage those who are willing to wait.<br/>
<br/>
 HUMOR A profound and profoundly tongue-in-cheek article from the future: &quot;Home Eating a Threat to Public Kitchens? State Allows Growing Trend of Eating At Home&quot; <br/>
 READING FOR PARENTS, besides all this. Four or five life-changingly important books are listed and each linked to sites with summaries and samples (the bottom of that page). <br/>
 THINKING STICKS (trust me)<br/>

SOME UNSCHOOLING FAMILIES&#39; WEBSITES<br/>

They&#39;re not easy to find, so bookmark them when you get there! Becoming an Unschooler, What Unschooling Is, Unschooling Pages and Websites. They don&#39;t have children so how do they rate here? They are adults in their twenties, both of whom were unschooled! <br/>
<br/>
Kathy Ward&#39;s big, fun family has a website which is a marvel in every way.<br/>
<br/>
Karen Arnold has an unschooling page with tales of her children&#39;s inspiring doings, and excellent resource lists with more links. <br/>
<br/>
Linda Wyatt writes clearly and passionately about unschooling. Read about her trip to Scotland.<br/>
