<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oddly, Brenda, when I watched it was when we were stationed in Germany! I was<br/>
&gt; *just* pregnant and living in the Amelia Earhart Hotel next to the Mainz<br/>
&gt; hospital. The only tv was Armed Forces (preprogrammed, Sesame Street one hour<br/>
&gt; everyday, no other channels).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, yes.  Armed Forces Network is so wonderful, isn&#39;t it?  We now get 5<br/>
channels on free AFN.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at 2 p.m. I had the choice of the Fox Morning News (4th time in a<br/>
row they ran the exact same half hour), a football game rerun, Sesame<br/>
Street, an old horror movie, or &quot;local programming&quot; -- military people<br/>
running the cameras and the news desk.<br/>
<br/>
I took local programming, it&#39;s always funnier than Sesame Street.  &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
