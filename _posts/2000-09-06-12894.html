<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125700504">I know I&#39;m late on this one, but I couldn&#39;t think of anyhting until now!  My<br/>
girls used to love playing with their Magna Doodles in the car on a trip!<br/>
Those are the magnetic boards that the kids draw on and then erase with a<br/>
slide of the bar.  My DD just told me that they liked to play with their toy<br/>
ponies and drawing while traveling.<br/>
