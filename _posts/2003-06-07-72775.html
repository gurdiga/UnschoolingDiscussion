 Maybe THAT&#39;S the downside of the word &quot;project&quot;.  To me a project seems<br/>
 to have a defined, expected outcome.<br/>

    Well, now, sometimes I want the curtains to hang below the windowsill, <br/>
not one inch above it, right?  ( Can you tell that what I am doing now?? Stupid <br/>
sheers!  Impossible to pin straight!  ARGH!)  <br/>
<br/>
    That&#39;s my defined, expected outcome. But really, the point is to hem the <br/>
sheers.  I could do it crooked, or sewn badly, but I have my own standards.  <br/>
They&#39;re not rigid standards, I just want it to look right after all this <br/>
planning and work, that&#39;s all.  <br/>

    Alex is making a wooden box.  He&#39;s not sanding down the edges of the <br/>
pieces yet, and he&#39;ll probably figure out soon that if he wants the end flush to <br/>
the other piece, he&#39;s gonna hafta sand that puppy down a bit. Because his <br/>
project is a box, and he&#39;ll want it to look like a box when he&#39;s done.  <br/>
<br/>
    I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with working toward a desired <br/>
outcome.  People do it in real life.  They set goals, and work towards them.  They <br/>
just don&#39;t have to be done by after lunch on Tuesday.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513399987">For me the essence of a &quot;project&quot; is that it has many steps or stages to<br/>
completion, rather than one or two. I think we use the word lightly and<br/>
humorously when a task with small number of steps becomes a project<br/>
because of many obstacles - sometimes because of interruptions.<br/>
Sometimes for me loading the dishwasher becomes a &quot;project&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
In primary (US-grade) school a &quot;Project&quot; was regurgitating encyclopedia<br/>
information about the wildlife in Antarctica with illustrations, a<br/>
pretty title page and formatted like a picture book. Drawing (or<br/>
tracing) got more points than pasting. Neatness counted. It makes me<br/>
think of the craft of scrapbooking without the personality. Sometimes it<br/>
was making diorama. Presentation was all.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly in high school, Projects became Assignments, and the many<br/>
illustrations needed to be fewer b&w line drawings and the words typed,<br/>
and a &quot;Project&quot; was some kind of group produced thing.<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, I think we were just recreating the visual style of<br/>
the &quot;grade appropriate&quot; textbooks we were using.<br/>
