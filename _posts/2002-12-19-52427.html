<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019296512">***You know who fits this is   Greg Brown.   And he sings....grrrrrr<br/>
 Kelli***<br/>
<br/>
I agree Kelli, he&#39;s a little weird looking.  I remember seeing him up<br/>
close one year while he was signing one of my cd&#39;s and I was amazed that<br/>
someone who looks a bit like Pan could be so mesmerizing.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s definitely on my list, along with a few ex&#39;s, and I think I would<br/>
have to add Peter Jackson (the director of LOTR).<br/>
