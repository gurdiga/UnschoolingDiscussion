&gt; daughter is 81/2.  They have both chatted a bit on<br/>
&gt; icq, but we can&#39;t <br/>

&gt;  Perhaps we could arrange a time, and<br/>
&gt; a server <br/>
&gt; where all of the children could meet.  I could set<br/>
&gt; the channel up as <br/>
&gt; invite only, so only those children who ask<br/>
&gt; permission via this list, <br/>
&gt; have access to the channel.  I have a 12 year old<br/>
&gt; son, who is a <br/>
&gt; computer whiz, and he could help ensure security.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-874790005">Good Morning all,<br/>
<br/>
We have just set up a channel for the children to chat in, on irc.<br/>
The channel will not show up if you do a search for it, because it is <br/>
set as secret.  The only people who will be able to access the <br/>
channel, must have the password.<br/>
<br/>
The channel is set up on Efnet.  Some of the irc servers which will <br/>
reach efnet are:<br/>
irc.mcs.net<br/>
irc.nethead.com<br/>
irc-w.frontiernet.net<br/>
irc.core.com<br/>
irc.concentric.net<br/>
irc.sprynet.com<br/>
irc.lightning.net<br/>
irc.telia.se<br/>
irc.prison.net<br/>
irc.mindspring.com<br/>
irc.idle.net<br/>
irc.total.net<br/>
irc.idirect.ca<br/>
irc.etsmtl.ca<br/>
<br/>
There are many other servers.  If anyone has difficulty, please <br/>
email me, and I will send you additional servers.<br/>
<br/>
The channel name is #unschoolkids.  To join the channel type <br/>
&quot;/join #unschoolkids September&quot; September is the password. <br/>
<br/>
You can download mIRC at www.mirc.co.uk, look in the download <br/>
section for mIRC32.  To set this software up, after you download it, <br/>
run the file, it will ask you where to install it and if you want to <br/>
create shortcuts, allow everything it wants.  When it is done, start <br/>
mIRC, it will prompt you with a bunch of things to setup.  There is <br/>
Full Name, E-Mail address, Nickname and Alternative nickname.  <br/>
Fill everything in correctly.  On the left panel, it will say Connect, <br/>
IRC, Sounds, Mouse, Dcc, Display and a bunch of other tabs.  <br/>
Double click on Connect, then click on Identd.  In the userid space, <br/>
enter unschool.  mIRC is now setup and you can connect to a <br/>
server, once everything is setup, press Ok.  Now type &quot;/server &lt;irc <br/>
server&gt;&quot; where irc server is one of the servers I have included <br/>
above.  Once you are connected, you will see a bunch of junk flash <br/>
by your screen, you can ignore it.  Now type in the channel name, <br/>
and the password.<br/>
<br/>
The above paragraph is compliments of my not quite 13 year old <br/>
son. :)<br/>
