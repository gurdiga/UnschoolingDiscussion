<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643450736">One other suggestion for those of you interested in trying vegetarian foods. <br/>
Go to www.vegsource.com and read some of the recipes on Chef Deb&#39;s recipe <br/>
board. They are wonderful and she can give you great ideas for fixing vegan <br/>
versions of just about anything you ask her for. Even veggie buffalo wings, <br/>
LOL. Try it!<br/>
<br/>
Priss<br/>
p.s. They also have some nice homeschooling boards at vegsource.</div>
