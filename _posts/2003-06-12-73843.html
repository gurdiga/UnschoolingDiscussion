<div id="ygrps-yiv-829792322">&lt;&lt;Like the mini desks<br/>
idea..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tammy,<br/>
<br/>
I found my lap desks at a resale shop.  They were a hard top with a bean bag <br/>
type bottom.  If you can&#39;t find any, or if they are too expensive, here are <br/>
some other ideas:<br/>
<br/>
A small dry-erase board or chalkboard.  Gives them something to do as well <br/>
as a hard surface for other things.<br/>
<br/>
Homemade lap desks are easy with a few tools, I&#39;ve made these for my kids.  <br/>
I&#39;d be happy to make them for anyone who wants one, too! (Shameless plug!)<br/>
<br/>
Buy a piece of wood, cheap particle board works fine.  With spray adhesive, <br/>
cover it on one side with wallpaper, wrapping paper, contact paper, fabric, <br/>
anything you have will work.  If you want a soft side, cut out a piece or <br/>
pieces, depending on how thick you want it, of batting to cover the back, <br/>
cut a piece of fabric large enough to cover the batting and sides.  Staple <br/>
the fabric in place around the baord edges and cover with trim.  You can <br/>
either staple or glue the trim on, depending on how clean you want the edges <br/>
to look.  For the hard side, you can also spray it with chalkboard paint if <br/>
you&#39;d like.  I&#39;ve done this, too and it works out great!<br/>
<br/>
The ideas are endless!  We&#39;ve used felt on one side for felt play....great <br/>
for car rides...and made homemade felt people and such before going out of <br/>
town.  I&#39;ve made them in secret and broken them out on the car ride for a <br/>
fun, new surprise.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I did on some of my boards was use an old tin can, veggie, <br/>
etc., and covered it in fabric to make it pretty.  I cut out a hole in the <br/>
lap desks for a tight fit and stuck it in the hole, sunk in only about an <br/>
inch or two, depending on the back surface of my board, and glued it in <br/>
place.  Usually you can get a tight fit without needing glue.  In this we <br/>
placed their drawing supplies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A tape recorder can be fun if you don&#39;t mind the noise.  My kids love taping <br/>
silly sounds and playing them back.  Once, we sang songs onto the tape and <br/>
played it back to sing to ourselves in rounds.  THAT was a LOT of fun!  We <br/>
also sang silly made-up songs about things we saw on the way.  It is fun to <br/>
go back and listen to those tapes of our trip to AK.  Many of them have <br/>
running commentary of what we were seeing which is really neat.  I secretly <br/>
taped a lot of our conversations and love going back and listening to <br/>
them...and how tiny they all sound!!!  The kids think those tapes are really <br/>
neat!<br/>
<br/>
We bought some Colorforms and I found some window decals on clearance and <br/>
the kids liked sticking those to the car windows and making scenes and such. <br/>
  With so many kids, of course we had to stop and seat swap so everyone got <br/>
a turn but it worked out really well for us.  Try the dollar stores as they <br/>
tend to have out of date things for really cheap.<br/>
<br/>
We spent nearly an entire day before our trip cutting out pictures from <br/>
magazines and such and placed them in a recipe box.  Obviously you would <br/>
have to find small pictures or cut larger ones up into small pieces.  On the <br/>
trip, I gave the kids glue sticks and construction paper and they had a ball <br/>
pasting their pictures onto paper.  By cutting out ahead of time, we <br/>
eliminated the need for scissors in the car.<br/>
<br/>
We did bark and leaf rubbings in the car too.  On our pitstops, we grabbed <br/>
various flowers, leaves, bark, etc and once back on the road, the kids did <br/>
rubbings with crayons.  Haleigh, the only one really old enough at that <br/>
time, used a field guide to locate what she had found in nature and gave <br/>
each item a name in pretty letters.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, I have a running list of great ideas we have tried and come up <br/>
with for things to do in the car.  If I can find it, or if I come up with <br/>
anything else, I&#39;ll let you know!<br/>
<br/>
OH!  One last thing.  Give everyone a backpack or something similar to store <br/>
their own things in.  It&#39;s so much better for them each to have their own <br/>
things and a safe place to keep them!  If each child has a seat in front of <br/>
them, you can hang a simple bag on the back of the seat in front of them or <br/>
even make a flat piece of canvas with various pockets to store things in.  <br/>
If you can swing it in your behicle, this is the way to go!  I&#39;ve made <br/>
several of these and my kids adore them!  Easy access and keeps the floor <br/>
and seats free of junk for extra space...a premium on a road trip!<br/>
