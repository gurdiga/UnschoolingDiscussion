&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>
&gt; husband (BTW, what IS a &quot;DH&quot;?).  Although you want this subject to be<br/>
&gt; closed, I hope you&#39;ll consider these few points.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>
&gt; from the act of feeding/nurturing our babies.  If anything, I feel I<br/>
&gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>
&gt; watch how babies cuddle into the breast, breathe in their mother&#39;s<br/>
&gt; scent, burrow ever deeper into her bosom, run their tiny fingers over<br/>
&gt; their mother&#39;s body, and play footsies all over their mama, it totally<br/>
&gt; melts my heart.  I was a bottle-fed baby, and although I don&#39;t have any<br/>
&gt; memories of that, I now know what I would have preferred.  My children<br/>
&gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>
&gt; missed out on.  As our babies have nursed, I have often found myself<br/>
&gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
&gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
&gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
&gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>
&gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>
&gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>
&gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>
&gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>
&gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>
&gt; never learned to be sensitive or emotionally intimate with his children.<br/>
&gt; He simply FED me.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In summary, I cannot express adequately just how wonderful an experience<br/>
&gt; it has been for ME to be part of our breast-feeding team.  Like Sonia, I<br/>
&gt; understand that there are those 1-2% of cases where breast-feeding is<br/>
&gt; not possible for medical reasons. But I strongly encourage it for all<br/>
&gt; the other fathers, if it&#39;s at all an option for them......<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180251532">Good Morning,<br/>
OK, I  have to get a word in here too....<br/>
My wife was able to nurse beautifully with both our boys and for that I am<br/>
thankful as well.  But I have seen my sister in law recently go through<br/>
breastfeeding problems (challenges!!) that really opened my eyes to how much<br/>
of an unbelievable challenge it can be.  She had all kinds of support ( her<br/>
Midwife, My wife who is also a Midwife, and a lactation consultant) but she<br/>
still says labout was nothing in comparison to the emotional challenges of<br/>
the first couple of months of breastfeeding.  Since then I have noticed many<br/>
other of my wife&#39;s clients with similar challenges.  It can be a enormous<br/>
challenge, and, for instance, if my sister in law had not been successful at<br/>
surmounting all her challenges, I would NEVER hold it against her... even if<br/>
it was medically possible.  I think that by saying there are only 1-2% of<br/>
women who cannot breastfeed that it invalidates the experiences of so many<br/>
women who have such extreme challenges, which may come from a variety of<br/>
sources...   The last thing a woman needs after deciding it is too<br/>
challenging for HER to breastfeed is a whole lot of guilt.  On the other<br/>
hand, I am completely in favor of promoting breastfeeding as the first<br/>
choice, and providing all the support and information that can be provided<br/>
to make the chances of success as high as possible.<br/>
Just another mans openion....<br/>
(I feel funny chiming in on this topic as a man... but I have been reading<br/>
the posts for a long time... and I feel I shouldn&#39;t hold back my thoughts<br/>
just on account of my gender)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hello, one and all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s time for another father to speak to this issue.  I am Sonia&#39;s<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a &quot;breast-feeding father&quot;, I have never thought myself to be excluded<br/>

&gt; have bonded MORE with our children because of breastfeeding.  When I<br/>

&gt; are learning a level of intimacy, sensitivity and love that I think I<br/>

&gt; drawn in by the beauty of what I am seeing, and lay down beside my wife<br/>
&gt; and baby to cuddle them both.  Quite a change for a formerly insensitive<br/>
&gt; and self-centred jock!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I consider myself to be essential to my babies&#39; breastfeeding also, for<br/>
&gt; the simple reason that I make it possible for my wife to break away from<br/>
&gt; some of her tasks to have quiet time to nurse our babies.  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t do this when I&#39;m away at work, but when I&#39;m home, it&#39;s my greatest<br/>
&gt; pleasure to enable my babies to nurse.  Then, I have made the time to<br/>
&gt; bond with our babies by changing their diapers, dressing them, walking,<br/>
&gt; rocking, bathing and napping with them, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From a purely financial standpoint, I can only say how grateful I am<br/>
&gt; that nature has provided breast-milk for babies.  I don&#39;t know HOW we<br/>
&gt; could ever have afforded the $1,500.+  it would cost to bottle-feed a<br/>
&gt; baby per year.  Furthermore, I don&#39;t really think that a father bonds in<br/>
&gt; the same way by bottle-feeding a baby, that I have in participating in<br/>
&gt; the breast-feeding of our babies.  My father bottle-fed me, but he still<br/>
