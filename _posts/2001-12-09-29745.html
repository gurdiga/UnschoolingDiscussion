<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388806892">I thought I&#39;d share this story since I found the message to be the <br/>
opitome of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My son has bothered me to get him &#39;Hooked on Phonics&#39; for almost a <br/>
year now. I know its because the commerical is so enticing with <br/>
the &#39;Now Austin is a reader&#39; and it really hits home with the <br/>
competition complex that he developed while we stayed with his two <br/>
(male) cousins for 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I gave in and bought it, with the money-back guarantee.<br/>
<br/>
After it came, we opened it. I was dismayed that only the first level <br/>
comes with a CD. He&#39;s a computer kid, and the audio tapes are just <br/>
not his style.<br/>
<br/>
So, while playing the CD it asked questions that he needed to respond <br/>
to get to the next level.<br/>
<br/>
Since he didn&#39;t do the flashcards or the tape. He was having a hard <br/>
time with the sounds and the answers.<br/>
<br/>
I watched him as he went into the box, grabbed the workbook and found <br/>
the answers by using the pictures to identify them. <br/>
<br/>
I was ELATED! <br/>
<br/>
I know,  most people would of been apalled at watching their <br/>
children &#39;cheat&#39;!<br/>
<br/>
I was happy. He knew how to solve his dilema. And thats all he needs <br/>
to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365877472">Also I wanted to try hooked on phonics, but that&#39;s too expensive for <br/>
   our budget right now.  So any helpful affordable advice woudl be <br/>
   appreciated. <br/>

If you choose to use Hooked on Phonics, you could try the library.<br/>
In Kentucky, they have a long waiting list for it.  Hope this helps.<br/>
