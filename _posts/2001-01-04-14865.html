<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155356817">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been out of town for almost two weeks.  My son has been making up<br/>
symbols and using letters/symbols from other languages such as Egyption<br/>
and Chinese.  It&#39;s really fun seeing his languages develope.   He has<br/>
some awareness of  English rhyming words and how words begin with<br/>
similar letters and asks how words are spelled sometimes.  He writes<br/>
some of his letters backwards. He probably has word recognition for<br/>
about 100 words.  He&#39;s six years and would be in first grade and be<br/>
forced to do the traditional way if he was in school, I&#39;m sure glad he&#39;s<br/>
not.  Who knows, maybe he&#39;ll be a linguist some day!  I wonder what<br/>
language he will write today.<br/>
