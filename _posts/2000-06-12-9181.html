<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi All!&nbsp; Thanks everyone for replying to the 
Meeting new people post....It was great for me...I had alot of fun reading about 
others on the list.....it seems we all have alot in common......I am an avid 
breast feeding supporter, although I am not a part of LLL.......My husband had a 
friend who was a UU member, and I heard it was&nbsp; pretty diverse, and 
positive.. I appreciated being able to look at an official UU site....there&#39;s 
actually a local church in Edmonds, and we&#39;re considering giving it a visit...I 
really liked the part about religtion being within someone, rather than 
without.......and respecting everyone&#39;s right to persue their own spiritual 
path, no matter what that may be, and their community, and global activism, and 
participation....Just Great.......Also, there was a member on the list from 
North , here in Washington, that I wanted to touch base with..I think your name 
is Tiffany..sounded like we had some common interests, if you&#39;d like to get 
together sometime.......It was reallly neat seeing where you are all located all 
around the U.S., and in Portugal, and other spots abroad....it&#39;s inspiring to 
have members from all over the globe.......SO keep it coming...I also found 
myself nodding my head going&quot;yah, us too, us too!&quot;..Well we&#39;ve found the 
magician for our ds&#39;s birthday party in July.....he does the doves appearing and 
all.....sounds like we&#39;ll have great fun.......Thanks for all your input!!!!! 
Many Blessings All!&nbsp;&nbsp; Michelle</font></div></html></div>
