That was a great post about the experience issue...you put it well.<br/>
Speaking of snow, I am heading North tomorrow morning. My Mom is not going to <br/>
make it much longer and it&#39;s time to fly home. I won&#39;t be on the boards much <br/>
probably, as I will be helping my family and planning a funeral.<br/>
I&#39;ll be here in spirit though!!<br/>
Carry on good friends....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507929873">Sorry to hear about your mom, Ren. I know you&#39;ve been mentioning for a while that she&#39;s been fighting a losing battle with cancer. I almost lost my mom in 1998 to a brain tumor and it was very traumatic for all of us. I feel so lucky that she&#39;s still alive and well today. I hope you and your family can find comfort in each other at this difficult time and that your mom finds comfort in having her family come together for her.<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some people who switch to homeschooling (or to unschooling) have said it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;easy because their children had the basics from school (i.e. they can read <br/>
&gt;and write and multiply, I guess).  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, it was easy.  I didn&#39;t have the worries about when he would <br/>
learn to read or if he would ever know how to do math.  (I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to even wonder if he would ever become interested in it, because it had <br/>
been forced into him, which surely killed his interest.)  I already knew <br/>
first-hand the damage that school could do.  But that gave me a chance <br/>
to evolve on his watch instead of his little brother&#39;s, who was only <br/>
about 18 months old when we started.  <br/>
<br/>
I evolved so far that when the little one learned to read a month after <br/>
turning 7 it was only a slight relief, instead of a great big one.  ;) <br/>
 I knew it was going to happen.  Not because I&#39;d seen it, but because I <br/>
had read and learned and immersed myself in what unschooling was, and I <br/>
was already there, before the baby was even 3 or 4.  Lucky boy.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I envy some of my much younger friends, some of them who are having <br/>
children at the same ages I was, who *get it* earlier than I did.  I <br/>
want them to realize how lucky they are.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010736317"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And opinions: is it unreasonable of me to ask my husband to plan some trip <br/>
&gt;with the children some weekend and take them by himself for the sole purpose <br/>
&gt;of me getting sleep and cleaning the house? (housecleaning appears to be the <br/>
&gt;thing that falls by the wayside when I&#39;m way-tired. My son and husband do <br/>
&gt;their own laundry, but they are not big cleaners. I get ooked out when things <br/>
&gt;aren&#39;t clean -- clutter isn&#39;t a problem, dirt is.) Or is that just too <br/>
&gt;irresponsible/selfish of me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not selfish.  Necessary.  Do it.<br/>
<br/>
I know it seems unfair to your husband to expect him to get up with the <br/>
little one on occasion, but sleep-deprivation is a serious thing, and <br/>
it&#39;s his kid, too.  If he could do it just once a week, you&#39;d be that <br/>
much better off, and he can catch up on the weekends.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s awful to help your daughter adjust her schedule some, either. <br/>
 After all, everyone has to do their part to help the family along.<br/>
