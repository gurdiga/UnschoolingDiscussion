<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552940678">Many people put  quotes or phrases that tell a little about the person and<br/>
their interests. It&#39;s called a signature line.<br/>
My interpretation of that one is that the person is  Pagan (a nature based<br/>
religion based on ancient tradition) and has a great sense of humor!<br/>
BTW, I saw a bumpersticker recently that says<br/>
&quot;Sorry I haven&#39;t been to church lately, I was busy practicing witchcraft and<br/>
becoming a lesbian.&quot; LOL<br/>

have<br/>
not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry.&quot; A. Einstein</div>
