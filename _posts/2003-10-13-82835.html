ok, wanting to make sure I understand<br/>
- not knowing that your friend&#39;s mom was gay for many years after middle <br/>
school -rather, believing some incorrect assumption...helped you to &#39;normalize&#39; it?<br/>
Please forgive what may come accross as...offensive, I am new here and even <br/>
if I wasn&#39;t (new) I assure you, attacking is not my line, promise.<br/>
but something isnt sitting right here, with me anyways, <br/>
and its not about gay, good/bad/normal or anything controversial, <br/>
its about being open and honest with my kids...about MY feelings...and <br/>
allowing my kids to have feelings of their own about the subject, objectively, and <br/>
to do that, they would have to KNOW what the subject is...<br/>
Avoiding entirely the issue of normalcy, and other potential controversies I <br/>
would suggest an example;<br/>
every time you have ever seen a bowl of fruit it contained apples and <br/>
bananas, you have seen green, yellow and red apples, and bananas in many fruit bowls, <br/>
all of your friends have them on their tables, in their dining rooms, apples <br/>
and bananas.<br/>
Your best friend had a green looking roundish object in her bowl, with her <br/>
banana, her mother always referred to the bowl as the bowl, and your mother <br/>
never said anything, never brought attention to it, you knew she had seen it,and <br/>
it was sitting in front of everyone- on the dining table. You assumed it was an <br/>
apple, <br/>
Later you found out it was an avacado, and your mom was very matter of fact <br/>
and accepting. This helped you to understand that avacados are normal.<br/>
ummm<br/>
I read this differently. I read it as if her mom didn&#39;t make a big deal about <br/>
it one way or another -- that this was a family she visited, and it happened <br/>
to be a same-sex couple. It&#39;s likely they weren&#39;t out (since the other woman <br/>
was referred to as an &quot;aunt&quot;), and that it wouldn&#39;t, at the time, be <br/>
appropriate to share with her daughter, &quot;Oh, they&#39;re lesbians.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108956607">Those of you using AOL 9.0 - your &quot;quoting&quot; isn&#39;t working automatically <br/>
and so it is nearly impossible to tell, from your posts, what you are <br/>
quoting versus what you are writing yourself because it is all run <br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody has figured out how to make it work - please feel free to <br/>
post it here so that others can fix it too.<br/>
<br/>
If not - maybe those on AOL 9.0 can manually edit their own posts, <br/>
before hitting send, to put quote marks of some sort around their <br/>
quoted material? I know I&#39;d sure appreciate it because I do WANT to be <br/>
able to read and comprehend what you&#39;ve written.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too. When I was growing up in small-town Nova Scotia in the 70&#39;s there <br/>
were a few couples like this that we knew. Everyone (or just about) knew <br/>
they were lesbians but no one ever said it out loud. It was only when I was <br/>
in my teens I realized the full nature of the relationships. My cousin has <br/>
been in a long-term relationship for twenty years or more and no one talks <br/>
about it, they just accept it, and her partner is present at all family <br/>
events. I&#39;m sure some people don&#39;t like it but they are free to suffer in <br/>
private :-)<br/>
