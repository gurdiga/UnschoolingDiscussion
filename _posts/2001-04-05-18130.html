I loved your post!<br/>
I know that unschoolers and h/s whos children are the next *Enstien* <br/>
(sp) and have their heads in text books because they want too, have <br/>
reason to be very proud.  But my dd doesn&#39;t do anymore than she <br/>
needs, which is basically nothing to talk about!! At the moment she <br/>
is watching Titanic AGAIN. (I..  know she is actually learning)So it <br/>
was lovelly to hear that your children, who did not do workbooks etc <br/>
have done so well. Gives me hope.......<br/>
<br/>
Just as a matter of interest, my ds who did go to school, but was <br/>
there in body only and never did any work and never learned a thing, <br/>
left school at 15yrs - went from one job to another - bumed around - <br/>
and gave me hell, is now a fully qualified mechanic with his own <br/>
mechanical repair shop, a wife and 2 sons.<br/>

I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;d be interested in any of the &#39;how <br/>
they made...&#39; type documentaries, or any stuff about <br/>
Titanic itself?  Or would this be too obviously <br/>
&#39;educational&#39; for her?  As for your ds, sounds like <br/>

Oh way too obvious..... dd showed an interest in sewing, untill I <br/>
managed to get a sewing machine!!!!   She is definetly a radical <br/>
unschooler - as radical as they come - just wish mother was as <br/>
comfortable with it as she is!!!!  But I am learning......<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I agree, ds was a typical late unschooler.  he would have <br/>
been in heaven if I had unschooled him.  He would have spent all day <br/>
building trolleys and taking motors apart<br/>

anything? What age do you think a child has to be to be able to really think 
about these things? Did you ever &quot;encourage&quot; certain learning? I have an 
(almost) 8-year-old son and I still worry about choosing the unshooling 
philosophy :o) for him as opposed to his being able to decide for himself... Did 
you ever worry about what they might want &quot;to be when they grow up&quot; and worry if 
the unshooling philosophy would prepare them well-enough? I know that supposedly

There&#39;s more to miss with a movie than with a book or record, and then <br/>
there&#39;s the additional factor, true to all of those, of having different <br/>
understandings at different ages.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to understand seeing a movie differently at six, twelve, fifteen; <br/>
but there are movies I knew well as a childless adult that, now as a parent, <br/>
I see very differently.  I imagine when I&#39;m older, have had a child die, have <br/>
no parents living, have a retired husband, whatever all, there will be movies <br/>
and books I understand at yet another level again.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you don&#39;t mind, may I ask a few questions? You always unschooled, right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well... our oldest son took a state correspondence course program for <br/>
the first grade when we lived in Alaska. It only took us about a <br/>
month of reading the textbooks and filling out the workbooks to <br/>
figure out that it was mostly busywork, that he either already knew <br/>
all that stuff or could pick it up quicker with short explanations <br/>
than via their texts. So we skipped most of the textbooks and just <br/>
did the stuff he found interesting. He passed at the end of the year <br/>
with a special commendation from the overseeing teacher for a paper <br/>
mache globe he built on his own. Of course almost anyone can pass <br/>
first grade &lt;g&gt; but it showed us that schooling, even long-distance <br/>
schooling, was mostly about keeping kids busy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Did you have discussions with your children while they were growing <br/>
&gt;up about the unschooling philosophy and compare it to other options?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We publish Home Education Magazine, and when our kids were young we <br/>
travelled to conferences all over the country, where, in addition to <br/>
helping us do workshops and answer peoples&#39; questions, and sitting in <br/>
on the other workshops and speeches, our kids compared notes with <br/>
lots of other kids, so they grew up knowing about all the various <br/>
ways people homeschool - everything from our very laid back approach <br/>
to the school-at-home other end of the spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Has any of them ever said they wish they&#39;d been &quot;pushed&quot; into <br/>
&gt;learning anything?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Our oldest son, John, spent about six months living with his <br/>
biological dad and that dad&#39;s new wife, who knew nothing about <br/>
homeschooling and was convinced that it was all just a very bad idea. <br/>
John came home one day and confronted us with questions about why we <br/>
hadn&#39;t sent him to school so he could be like &quot;normal&quot; kids... or at <br/>
least forced him to do schoolwork and take tests and all that. We <br/>
recognized the source of the problem and the reasons for John&#39;s <br/>
questions, so we patiently explained all the reasons we believed in <br/>
this different way of learning, why we had decided that school was an <br/>
unhealthy place for kids, basically nothing new, but just reinforcing <br/>
what we&#39;d always done. And we discussed it all in front of the <br/>
younger kids, because we knew they were interested in what had <br/>
happened, and why John was upset, and we wanted them to be able to <br/>
discuss it with him, too. (Interesting aside: John&#39;s younger brother <br/>
Jim wasn&#39;t interested in living with the bioDad and the new wife - he <br/>
thought the new wife was too controlling and flaky. Apparently my <br/>
ex-dh decided so too, as they split after less than a year.)<br/>
<br/>
Right now our youngest son, 15, has been insisting on more and more <br/>
structured learning opportunities, books on certain subjects, <br/>
computer programs, etc., because he&#39;s interested in the idea of going <br/>
to college. He&#39;s spent some time at various colleges in Seattle where <br/>
his cousins and several of our kids&#39; friends are now, and likes the <br/>
atmosphere, the ambiance... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  What age do you think a child has to be to be able to really think <br/>
&gt;about these things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that totally depends on the child. All our kids have <br/>
developed on very different schedules.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Did you ever &quot;encourage&quot; certain learning?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the time! From publishing this magazine for so long we receive <br/>
incredible amounts of curriculum materials, computer programs, all <br/>
the newest, best stuff. And we always make sure the kids know it&#39;s <br/>
available to them if they&#39;re interested. They rarely are. They see <br/>
all those learning resources (some of which I think are quite <br/>
wonderful) as just ways to trick kids into learning, to make parents <br/>
happy, or something. Their BS detectors are pretty refined. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I content myself with buying - or more often these days, helping <br/>
them figure out how to buy - what they *are* interested in, which <br/>
translates to tons of books and magazines on their favorite topics, <br/>
and tools and materials for all kinds of endeavors from furniture <br/>
building to horse training to car repair to gardening to cooking. <br/>
They&#39;re all hands-on learners - they get interested in something, <br/>
like making pottery or stained glass windows, and just dive in and <br/>
start doing it, learning as they go. This spring they&#39;ve all been <br/>
interested in sailing, so the house is full of books and magazines on <br/>
sailing, we&#39;ve been watching movies about sailing, they&#39;re lining up <br/>
adventures this summer with all our friends who own sailboats, and <br/>
studying how much a small one would cost! Immersion learning.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always travelled a lot - we just spent 2 weeks in California <br/>
and Oregon, and we go to Alaska at least 2 or 3 times a year - and <br/>
travelling is always an excellent way to learn, especially when <br/>
you&#39;re able to take your time and enjoy the special places along the <br/>
way. And of course they also like computer and video games, movies, <br/>
music... all the usual stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have an (almost) 8-year-old son and I still worry about choosing <br/>

&gt;want &quot;to be when they grow up&quot; and worry if the unshooling <br/>
&gt;philosophy would prepare them well-enough?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope. I never really questioned our decision to let our kids follow <br/>
their bliss and learn from living an interesting life - but then I <br/>
already knew how well it had worked for me and my brothers and <br/>
sisters.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I know that supposedly children will what they need when they need <br/>
&gt;it but did you ever worry? etc., etc., etc.! As you can see, I&#39;m in <br/>
&gt;worry mode right now...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well... I think that&#39;s good. Parents are supposed to worry about <br/>
what&#39;s best for their children, to be concerned about their futures, <br/>
whether or not they&#39;re doing the right thing, or enough of the right <br/>
thing... And now, please don&#39;t take this wrong, but I&#39;m potentially <br/>
going to get myself in hot water with this list... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not convinced that the kind of totally laid-back, no textbooks, <br/>
no expectations approach we took with our kids is right for everyone. <br/>
In fact, we don&#39;t even advise it as anything to emulate. For those <br/>
who find it working, great - we do think it&#39;s an excellent way to <br/>
live with your kids, to prepare them for all the various <br/>
peculiarities of life. But one needs to come to that kind of <br/>
understanding about learning on their own, not because someone - no <br/>
matter how respected they may be - says it&#39;s something they should <br/>
do. It&#39;s not something you can try this week, decide it&#39;s not <br/>
working, and go back to a curriculum next week saying it didn&#39;t work. <br/>
It&#39;s not an approach to learning so much as a way of life, a belief <br/>
and a trust and a certain surety about the outcome. Not that one is <br/>
ever finished learning... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I do think it takes a certain kind of headset. Mark and I are <br/>
both very relaxed and mellow people. We tend not to worry about <br/>
things, feeling that even when things aren&#39;t going the way we think <br/>
they should, we can learn and grow from the experience and figure out <br/>
what needs to be done differently to make them go the way we think <br/>
they should. Sometimes even that doesn&#39;t work out, and then we need <br/>
to totally rethink everything... and more often than not we end up <br/>
doing something completely different than what we&#39;d started out <br/>
doing. That&#39;s just not a comfortable way for some people to function. <br/>
We&#39;ve learned that many people need certainty, rules, regulations, <br/>
proven solutions, and all the rest. And that&#39;s okay for them, but it <br/>
might make unschooling difficult. At least I can&#39;t imagine how the <br/>
kind of radical unschooling we&#39;ve embraced would work without a <br/>
serious amount of flexibility involved.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

  Helen!<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If you don&#39;t mind, may I ask a few questions? You always 
  unschooled, right?<br><br>Well... our oldest son took a state correspondence 
  course program for <br>the first grade when we lived in Alaska. It only took 
  us about a <br>month of reading the textbooks and filling out the workbooks to 
  <br>figure out that it was mostly busywork, that he either already knew 
  <br>all that stuff or could pick it up quicker with short explanations 
  <br>than via their texts. So we skipped most of the textbooks and just <br>did 
  the stuff he found interesting. He passed at the end of the year <br>with a 
  special commendation from the overseeing teacher for a paper <br>mache globe 
  he built on his own. Of course almost anyone can pass <br>first grade 
  &lt;g&gt; but it showed us that schooling, even long-distance <br>schooling, 
  was mostly about keeping kids busy.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Did you have discussions 
  with your children while they were growing <br>&gt;up about the unschooling 
  philosophy and compare it to other options?<br><br>We publish Home Education 
  Magazine, and when our kids were young we <br>travelled to conferences all 
  over the country, where, in addition to <br>helping us do workshops and answer 
  peoples&#39; questions, and sitting in <br>on the other workshops and speeches, 
  our kids compared notes with <br>lots of other kids, so they grew up knowing 
  about all the various <br>ways people homeschool - everything from our very 
  laid back approach <br>to the school-at-home other end of the 
  spectrum.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Has any of them ever said they wish they&#39;d been 
  &quot;pushed&quot; into <br>&gt;learning anything?<br><br>Yes. Our oldest son, John, 
  spent about six months living with his <br>biological dad and that dad&#39;s new 
  wife, who knew nothing about <br>homeschooling and was convinced that it was 
  all just a very bad idea. <br>John came home one day and confronted us with 
  questions about why we <br>hadn&#39;t sent him to school so he could be like 
  &quot;normal&quot; kids... or at <br>least forced him to do schoolwork and take tests 
  and all that. We <br>recognized the source of the problem and the reasons for 
  John&#39;s <br>questions, so we patiently explained all the reasons we believed in 
  <br>this different way of learning, why we had decided that school was an 
  <br>unhealthy place for kids, basically nothing new, but just reinforcing 
  <br>what we&#39;d always done. And we discussed it all in front of the <br>younger 
  kids, because we knew they were interested in what had <br>happened, and why 
  John was upset, and we wanted them to be able to <br>discuss it with him, too. 
  (Interesting aside: John&#39;s younger brother <br>Jim wasn&#39;t interested in living 
  with the bioDad and the new wife - he <br>thought the new wife was too 
  controlling and flaky. Apparently my <br>ex-dh decided so too, as they split 
  after less than a year.)<br><br>Right now our youngest son, 15, has been 
  insisting on more and more <br>structured learning opportunities, books on 
  certain subjects, <br>computer programs, etc., because he&#39;s interested in the 
  idea of going <br>to college. He&#39;s spent some time at various colleges in 
  Seattle where <br>his cousins and several of our kids&#39; friends are now, and 
  likes the <br>atmosphere, the ambiance... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; What age 
  do you think a child has to be to be able to really think <br>&gt;about these 
  things?<br><br>I think that totally depends on the child. All our kids have 
  <br>developed on very different schedules.<br><br>&gt;&nbsp; Did you ever 
  &quot;encourage&quot; certain learning?<br><br>All the time! From publishing this 
  magazine for so long we receive <br>incredible amounts of curriculum 
  materials, computer programs, all <br>the newest, best stuff. And we always 
  make sure the kids know it&#39;s <br>available to them if they&#39;re interested. They 
  rarely are. They see <br>all those learning resources (some of which I think 
  are quite <br>wonderful) as just ways to trick kids into learning, to make 
  parents <br>happy, or something. Their BS detectors are pretty refined. 
  &lt;g&gt;<br><br>So I content myself with buying - or more often these days, 
  helping <br>them figure out how to buy - what they *are* interested in, which 
  <br>translates to tons of books and magazines on their favorite topics, 
  <br>and tools and materials for all kinds of endeavors from furniture 
  <br>building to horse training to car repair to gardening to cooking. 
  <br>They&#39;re all hands-on learners - they get interested in something, <br>like 
  making pottery or stained glass windows, and just dive in and <br>start doing 
  it, learning as they go. This spring they&#39;ve all been <br>interested in 
  sailing, so the house is full of books and magazines on <br>sailing, we&#39;ve 
  been watching movies about sailing, they&#39;re lining up <br>adventures this 
  summer with all our friends who own sailboats, and <br>studying how much a 
  small one would cost! Immersion learning.<br><br>We&#39;ve always travelled a lot 
  - we just spent 2 weeks in California <br>and Oregon, and we go to Alaska at 
  least 2 or 3 times a year - and <br>travelling is always an excellent way to 
  learn, especially when <br>you&#39;re able to take your time and enjoy the special 
  places along the <br>way. And of course they also like computer and video 
  games, movies, <br>music... all the usual stuff.<br><br>&gt;I have an (almost) 
  8-year-old son and I still worry about choosing <br>&gt;the unshooling 
  philosophy :o) for him as opposed to his being able <br>&gt;to decide for 
  himself... Did you ever worry about what they might <br>&gt;want &quot;to be when 
  they grow up&quot; and worry if the unshooling <br>&gt;philosophy would prepare 
  them well-enough?<br><br>Nope. I never really questioned our decision to let 
  our kids follow <br>their bliss and learn from living an interesting life - 
  but then I <br>already knew how well it had worked for me and my brothers and 
  <br>sisters.<br><br>&gt;I know that supposedly children will what they need 
  when they need <br>&gt;it but did you ever worry? etc., etc., etc.! As you can 
  see, I&#39;m in <br>&gt;worry mode right now...<br><br>Well... I think that&#39;s 
  good. Parents are supposed to worry about <br>what&#39;s best for their children, 
  to be concerned about their futures, <br>whether or not they&#39;re doing the 
  right thing, or enough of the right <br>thing... And now, please don&#39;t take 
  this wrong, but I&#39;m potentially <br>going to get myself in hot water with this 
  list... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>I&#39;m not convinced that the kind of totally laid-back, 
  no textbooks, <br>no expectations approach we took with our kids is right for 
  everyone. <br>In fact, we don&#39;t even advise it as anything to emulate. For 
  those <br>who find it working, great - we do think it&#39;s an excellent way to 
  <br>live with your kids, to prepare them for all the various <br>peculiarities 
  of life. But one needs to come to that kind of <br>understanding about 
  learning on their own, not because someone - no <br>matter how respected they 
  may be - says it&#39;s something they should <br>do. It&#39;s not something you can 
  try this week, decide it&#39;s not <br>working, and go back to a curriculum next 
  week saying it didn&#39;t work. <br>It&#39;s not an approach to learning so much as a 
  way of life, a belief <br>and a trust and a certain surety about the outcome. 
  Not that one is <br>ever finished learning... &lt;g&gt;<br><br>But I do think 
  it takes a certain kind of headset. Mark and I are <br>both very relaxed and 
  mellow people. We tend not to worry about <br>things, feeling that even when 
  things aren&#39;t going the way we think <br>they should, we can learn and grow 
  from the experience and figure out <br>what needs to be done differently to 
  make them go the way we think <br>they should. Sometimes even that doesn&#39;t 
  work out, and then we need <br>to totally rethink everything... and more often 
  than not we end up <br>doing something completely different than what we&#39;d 
  started out <br>doing. That&#39;s just not a comfortable way for some people to 
  function. <br>We&#39;ve learned that many people need certainty, rules, 
  regulations, <br>proven solutions, and all the rest. And that&#39;s okay for them, 
  but it <br>might make unschooling difficult. At least I can&#39;t imagine how the 
  <br>kind of radical unschooling we&#39;ve embraced would work without a 
  <br>serious amount of flexibility involved.<br><br>Hope this 
  helps,<br>Helen<br><br><br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message

Leguizamo never pretties himself up enough (he looks atrocious in a baby doll <br/>

forget that it&#39;s Swayze you are watching. More than that, he is moving. We <br/>
like his character.&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s a really sweet movie.  Stockard Channing is in it, as an abused wife.  <br/>

<br/>
Unfaithful was originally a French movie and I&#39;ve been told that the ending was much more conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of the American version is that we can pretty much decide what we think they did and debate over it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s why the American film makers did that but who knows.  ;o)<br/>

HTH,<br/>

ps. I didn&#39;t put the French version ending here because maybe some people don&#39;t want to not know.<br/>
It&#39;ll be much easier to find info. on the movie imo knowing that it&#39;s supposedly a classic French movie originally.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346644457">Did anyone else catch &quot;Danny Deckchair&quot; with Rhys Ifans and Miranda <br/>
Otto?  It&#39;s an Australian film and unfortunately it didn&#39;t get shown <br/>
around these parts.  As soon as Netflix had it available we rented it <br/>
and both DH and I really loved it.  It&#39;s a romantic comedy, I guess, <br/>
but so much more.  For a description and some more reviews go to <br/>

I found a trailer online, but I think it really gives away too much of <br/>
the film.  Here&#39;s the link in case you want to watch it anyway.  :)  <br/>

We liked it so much we bought a copy.  :)  Really sweet movie.<br/>
