BTW, I looked up RV&#39;s for my family to go to the conference(we have a <br/>
wedding in CT the following weekend so we had to go up anyway)  <br/>
www.cruiseamerica.com had some specials.  From Florida or Louisana it <br/>
was get 7 days and get 7 more free (about $1000).  Now, you may need <br/>
to purchase additional miles and they charge you per hour for the <br/>
generator running so I am sure that will add up.  However, we are <br/>
weighing all that right now.  I personally think that is the ultimate <br/>
family unschooling vacation!!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re planning an weeklong RV vacation in Arizona and then a week in the mountains in BC.  I&#39;m getting really excited - we leave the end of May!  It&#39;s taking a bit of wrangling to get it set up (and a bit of convoluted travel to get the stopovers we needed), but I think it will all be great fun.<br/>
<br/>
We fly to LA and take an overnight train to Tucson where we get the RV.  We&#39;re spending a couple nights at Kartchner Caverns State Park then driving (stopping at Montezuma&#39;s Castle along the way) to Grand Canyon National Park for four nights, then back to Sedona (spending the day at Red Rock State Park) for the last night.  We take the overnight train back to LA and then fly to Calgary and drive to Fernie, BC where friends of ours have a condo in the mountains and spend a week there before flying home.<br/>
<br/>
Our whole family loves hiking and exploring outdoors so I think we&#39;ll have a great time!<br/>

When are you going?  You will have to give me the scoopwhen you come <br/>
back.  We really need to make a final decision soon so I can make all <br/>
the arrangements!  <br/>
