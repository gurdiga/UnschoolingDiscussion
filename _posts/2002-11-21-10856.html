&lt;&lt;  The old ladies who just LOVE my <br/>
 kids, think they are so beautiful, and rave about them--they are trying <br/>
 to prove to themselves that they are not racist but I see right through <br/>
 them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So anyone that is nice to your kids and raves about how cute they are is <br/>
automatically suspicious?<br/>
Sounds like you have a lot of prejudices yourself Joylyn.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

When people tell me Holly&#39;s cute and nice, I never wonder about their <br/>
motivations or beliefs.  I assume they think she&#39;s cute.   She&#39;s been hanging <br/>
out a lot with Ramona King&#39;s family.  All of them are African American, and <br/>
BOTH parents say Holly is great at their house, very helpful, good kid, <br/>
funny, smart.  Are they somehow being racist?  When Tam is here and I brag <br/>
HER up for getting Holly  more involved in art and music, am I being racist <br/>
and Ramona can tell?<br/>
<br/>
IF every contact is racist, I don&#39;t know what we can do but avoid contact.<br/>
<br/>
That would be nuts.<br/>
<br/>
I think trusting people until they prove untrustworthy is better than any <br/>
other considerations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are so many forms of hatred in the world it&#39;s sad. Any of the &quot;isms&quot;<br/>
can be painful whether it&#39;s race, age, sex or caste bound (ok that&#39;s not an<br/>
ism but I don&#39;t have a word for it:)<br/>
<br/>
A young woman and her new husband were just beaten and then burned alive in<br/>
India the other day because they fell in love and got married. Their crime?<br/>
They were of different castes. The people who killed them were their own<br/>
family members. Hatred and lack of tolerance comes in many forms.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes living in a multicultural community such as we do here in Abu<br/>
Dhabi is a strain and yes it&#39;s easy to get mad or frustrated when &quot;those&quot;<br/>
people behave a certain way (you&#39;d have to see this place to understand how<br/>
many cultures are packed in together). BUT overall it&#39;s fascinating and<br/>
enriching and I know my family and I are so lucky to be experiencing this. <br/>
<br/>
Stereotypes often do come from very real things. However understanding and<br/>
then accepting the reasoning behind those behaviors is what moves us all<br/>
closer to tolerance and peace. <br/>
<br/>
So contact, contact, contact!!<br/>
