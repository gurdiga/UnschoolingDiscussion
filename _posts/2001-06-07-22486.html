<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664213119">Hi to all! I am new to this list, I started homeschooling my 2 <br/>
children this past year and we have really enjoyed it! I think I am <br/>
lucky to live in Kansas, where we don&#39;t have to report to state <br/>
officials or school districts. (other than the initial filing with <br/>
the KDoE)I do have a ? though, does anyone know of a support group <br/>
specfically for unschoolers, in the Topeka area? I have checked out <br/>
the two I have found, and they both ask for a signed statement of <br/>
faith, and one costs quite a bit to join, and requires you to test <br/>
your child using the CAT. I was very put off by this since the state <br/>
doesn&#39;t require me to test my children I found it hard to take that a <br/>
supposed support group would require it. (But then that is my <br/>
oppinion.) If no one knows of a support group in my area, how would I <br/>
go about starting one? What would I expect in starting one? I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even want anything fancy, just a small group of folks to get <br/>
together, go to the park for the kids, support/help and friendships <br/>
for the adults. No statements of faith, no testing... really don&#39;t we <br/>
all do this to avoid having to follow someone else as much as <br/>
possible? Thanks for listening! :o) ~Nancy<br/>

  Welcome to the list!  Depending on how far you are willing to drive, there<br/>
is a good support group in Johnson County.  I don&#39;t recall having to sign a<br/>
statement of faith although that was 9 years ago.  If you would like me to<br/>
research and get some phone numbers for you - I will be willing to do that. <br/>
If it&#39;s not convienant for you to drive to Johnson County, maybe someone in<br/>
that group can assist you in setting up a homeschool group in the Topeka<br/>
area.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Nancy --<br/>
<br/>
The closest I can come is I think there is a group of &quot;eclectic&quot;<br/>
homeschoolers in Nebraska and online called &quot;EHO&quot;.  (Might stand for<br/>
Eclectic Homeschoolers Online, but I&#39;m not absolutely certain.)  They do<br/>
have a website, if you want to search for it.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not suggesting that you drive to Nebraska for events, just that you<br/>
might find leads through this group.)<br/>
<br/>
While &quot;eclectics&quot; aren&#39;t unschoolers, they can be supportive of unschoolers<br/>
(generally), provided the unschoolers don&#39;t preach at them.  ;-)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Just wanted to jump in and say hello, I am new to this list. I have to<br/>
laugh<br/>
&gt; because while looking for an unschooling list today I found this one first<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; joined and there were no archives, nothing. So I went on down the yahoo<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; and also joined alwayslearning which looked to be active so I sent an<br/>
&gt; introduction there only to come home and find no mail from that list and<br/>
my mailbox<br/>
&gt; full from this one. So which to choose or both? I am not sure I can keep<br/>
up here<br/>
&gt; but am so starved to talk with other unschoolers since I think we have<br/>
&gt; finally arrived, LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I see a few people I know here, Hi Barb and Laura B!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Laura too, mom to 6 boys, hsing this last 5 yrs with the youngest 2<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; are now 12 and 16. We&#39;ve been working towards unschooling the past 2 years<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; it seems we&#39;ve finally left Kansas and arrived in Oz, LOL Never thought it<br/>
&gt; would happen that way one day you just realize where you are what you are<br/>
doing.<br/>
&gt; (Or maybe not doing, LOL)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, hello,<br/>
