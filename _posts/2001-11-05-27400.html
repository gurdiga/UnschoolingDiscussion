&gt; That&#39;s awesome! but here&#39;s a question for all. If one&#39;s son were a<br/>
&gt; &quot;fairy&quot;<br/>
&gt; would that change your feeling or acceptance? Words can be very<br/>
&gt; powerful<br/>
&gt; things and  can be hurtful even if not intended to be. I don&#39;t &quot;worry<br/>
&gt; &quot; that<br/>
&gt; my son or daughter would be gay or lesbian. I worry that they won&#39;t be<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; content, happy confident, caring individual.<br/>

a fairy costume for Halloween. It got some raised eyebrows, but HE loved<br/>
it. As far as sexual preferences, however, who knows? He IS only six. If<br/>
I had to guess, though, I&#39;d guess he&#39;s gonna turn out bisexual, like his<br/>
mother.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-613838430">I am assuming that by &#39;fairy&#39; you mean gay. If my son were gay it would not<br/>
change how we care for and love him. I agree Elissa, our only want for our<br/>
children is to be happy, caring, sensitive, and be treated WELL and know<br/>
themselves.<br/>
