Uh, I probably play more than my son does &lt;g&gt;.  Have you tried the help section of the game?  Also, I think the website has a hints section.  <br/>
<br/>
I have never done a sea lion show, but I was having trouble doing a sea lion exhibit with both land and deep water, I had to put two exhibits right next to each other; one land and one water (with a water tank wall around the water exhibit, and a regular fence around the land exhibit).  If you make the walls that are shared the same height, the sea lions can go between exhibits.  I assume you could do the same thing with a show tank,  make it share a wall with a land exhibit, then make the walls the same height.  You will probably have to make a moat or another fence around the exhibits to keep the sea lions from escaping.  You can also sink the land exhibit a little, then the rock sides of the exhibit act like fences, but I don&#39;t know if that would work in conjunction with a show tank. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744951884">Thanks, Katy.  I&#39;ll print that out for her.  I personally haven&#39;t played at all, so I&#39;m no help. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
