<div id="ygrps-yiv-383578560">I don&#39;t know if this will help you but I wanted to reply to this question <br/>
because<br/>
I had this same expirience with my son (although I wasn&#39;t unschooling him at<br/>
the time - he was in a Waldorf school). First, I just wanted to say that <br/>
every year<br/>
gets better! He&#39;s now nine and his meltdowns are much less intense or very <br/>
fleeting.<br/>
Last night I asked him if he could explain what was going on for him. He said<br/>
basically exactly what you suspected, that what he pictured in his mind was <br/>
not <br/>
at all what he ended up with. Sometimes when we, or his teacher tried to help<br/>
it would upset him even more because he said it wasn&#39;t his work or his idea <br/>
and didn&#39;t count. My son was slow to learn to read, reversed letters and <br/>
numbers<br/>
(still does - but better), and had trouble remembering where to place letters.<br/>
For him, I wonder if this had something to do with why what was in his head<br/>
wasn&#39;t what came out on paper even in his drawings. I really don&#39;t know how <br/>
much<br/>
is his temperment and how much is visual caused  frustration. Anyways, I <br/>
really just wanted to say, have hope because it gets easier. Also, he&#39;s too <br/>
young <br/>
to even know if he shows any dyslexic/dysgraphic tendencies but if he does in <br/>
the future , there is a writing program I just started. It&#39;s called <br/>
Handwriting Without Tears and you could use it as a reference when he&#39;s ready <br/>
(www.hwtears.com).<br/>
Hope it helps,<br/>

Good to know there is hope!  I think was is even more frustrating for me is <br/>
that he seems to &quot;get&quot; so many things, that I wonder why he struggles with <br/>
writing sometimes.  I am almost convinced that there is a different picture <br/>
in his head than what comes out on the paper.  He writes backwards almost <br/>
always and I thought maybe it had something to do with being left handed.  <br/>
Some of my relatives are suggesting that maybe he is dyslexic, but I thought <br/>
it was too early to tell.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said in my earlier post, it is not as if his meltdowns occur very <br/>
often, but once in a while it gets to both of us.  Having some feedback on <br/>
the topic has been helpful.  Thanks.<br/>
