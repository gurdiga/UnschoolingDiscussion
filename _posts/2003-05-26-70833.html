 or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only <br/>
unpatriotic and servile, <br/>
but is morally treasonable to the American public.&quot;<br/>

To spread them out evenly in layers, to cover whole odd-sized sandwiches so <br/>
you get some in every bite, and for thinner sandwiches, to make them more <br/>

<br/>
To TASTE tomatoes by themselves, I just want to eat them like an apple, with <br/>
salt.<br/>
