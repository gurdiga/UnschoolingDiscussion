I love the words!! Got a good laugh this morning, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I also love reading all the nursing vocabulary your kids developed, so sweet. <br/>
My dd called it &quot;nurries&quot;.....we still say nurries around here so babsy boy <br/>
will probably pick that one up too.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s almost one now, I can&#39;t even imagine trying to wean him. He nurses about <br/>
3 or 4 times at night still. He would be so upset to stop now! I only get a <br/>
small window of time (in view of my entire life) to enjoy breastfeeding and <br/>
this incredible closeness with him. Our children begin to seek independence <br/>
fairly soon in life, why not slow down and just enjoy them really needing us? <br/>
YK?<br/>
No rush to wean here....the poor guy would fall apart!  Besides, it&#39;s the <br/>
only time I actually have boobs and I ain&#39;t givin&#39; that up any time soon!! LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, since you brought it up... there is much anthrolopolical research<br/>
to suggest that a child this young who stops nursing has actually been<br/>
weaned, whether the mother realizes she&#39;s done it or not. Did you use<br/>
substitute nipples of any kind (pacifiers, bottles, etc.)? Were you<br/>
available to nurse, or did you put your child on a nursing schedule or<br/>
spend a good bit of time away from him/her? Did you often try to distract<br/>
a child who wanted to nurse? Did you night-wean your infant (&gt;1 yr, some<br/>
say &lt; 2 years)? Because our culture is so breastfeeding-unfirnedly, it&#39;s<br/>
easy to slip into weaning your child without meaning to. <br/>
<br/>
I know lots and lots of people who intentionally did *not* do any of this<br/>
weaning-behaviors, and none of their children weaned before 2... the<br/>
average was 3 to 4. I&#39;ve never read anthropological research about, say a<br/>
!Kung child who weans at a year - it would be suicide in that<br/>
environment, and that&#39;s the environment we all evolved in, and lived in<br/>
until the very recent past. Kathy Dettwyler has done some rearch on this,<br/>
it&#39;s available on the LLL site. <br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t like the phrase &quot;decided to be independent by  their first<br/>
birthday&quot;, and maybe that attitude towards nursing is part of why your<br/>
child stopped nursing so young. Weaning has *nothing* to do with<br/>
&quot;deciding to be independent&quot; - my daughter was still nursing when she<br/>
performed with a dance group at 3 1/2, plus by that age she was regularly<br/>
walking across to the hall and going to play with the kids over there,<br/>
and outside... she was swimming by herself, reading simple stories to<br/>
herself, etc., etc.... doing lots of things independently. Again, it&#39;s<br/>
our culture that has decided that nursing is a sign of dependency, unless<br/>
you also want to consider being hugged or read to a sign of dependency...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691695116">Independence takes me forms but a child who quits nursing at one still<br/>
needs some form of milk. One of the greatest comforts to me as a mother<br/>
was being able to nurse my toddler while sick, even if she couldn&#39;t<br/>
swallow solid food knowing that she was getting just what she needed to<br/>
feel better soon. <br/>
<br/>
Just recently saw the Japanese film _Tampopo_ by Juzo Itami again after<br/>
many years. One of the scenes shows a woman nursing her baby. She calmly<br/>
unbuttons her shirt, from the top, and sits on a park bench and feeds<br/>
her child. Totally unselfconscious.<br/>
<br/>
Or there is the old joke about the American doctor who accidentally<br/>
walked into a room in a hospital in the Middle East where a bunch of<br/>
women were nursing their babies. Embarrassed, they all covered their<br/>

Hey, <br/>
Long ago I was visiting a boyfriend (Keith the future husband) who was having <br/>
a big party.  I had come from work 90 miles away, and went in the bedroom to <br/>
change.  Someone I&#39;d never seen before came in to use the 2nd bathroom, while <br/>
I was stark naked.<br/>
<br/>
I quickly held some article of clothing up against my face while he said <br/>
&quot;Sorry&quot; and shut the door.<br/>

He didn&#39;t know who he had seen, and I didn&#39;t get a good look at who&#39;d seen <br/>
me.  It was better than covering up one or the other halves of me and having <br/>
to look at him looking at me...<br/>

It&#39;s Aletha Solter&#39;s website (She&#39;s the author of The<br/>

Also, recommend to them the book The Continuum Concept<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can say no to all those and my daughter weaned herself at maybe 14 months.<br/>
She liked using glasses and sippy cups so I never bothered with bottles. She<br/>
gave up naps at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm ... now that I&#39;m thinking of it, breastfeeding was for hunger followed<br/>
by a nap. When she was hungry at other than nap time (she fell into a<br/>
natural schedule that she readjusted herself as she needed fewer and fewer<br/>
naps) she ate food which she enjoyed so I didn&#39;t get any feedback that she<br/>
was being deprived. If she was hurt I hugged her just because it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have occured to me to make a connection between pain and food. If I need a<br/>
culture to make that connection for me, then is the connection strongly<br/>
biological? In a culture where infants are nursed when they cry regardless<br/>
of the cause, is it done because that&#39;s natural or because there is social<br/>
pressure to do so to quiet the infant because so many people are living so<br/>
close together? Or is it both? I suspect that children are adaptable and can<br/>
find comfort in a number of ways so ultimately the decision of what way is<br/>
best is whatever fits best with the society.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there were clues from my daughter that I was missing but if the<br/>
clues were that subtle, then how biologically necessary were they? I&#39;d<br/>
really hate to have women feel guilty if their child weans early. I think<br/>
it&#39;s much more nurturing to help women ignore the cultural pressures that<br/>
encourage them to wean early rather than to shame them into nursing as long<br/>
as possible because some have decided it isn&#39;t natural to wean early and to<br/>
even set a specific year before which they claim it would be unnatural to<br/>
stop nursing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve never read anthropological research about, say a<br/>
&gt; !Kung child who weans at a year - it would be suicide in that<br/>

&gt; until the very recent past.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people. The Polynesians, for instance, grew up in a land of plenty. (I<br/>
wonder at what age their children weaned before western influence?) I&#39;d say<br/>
nursing and weaning -- as with most of human biology -- is adaptable to the<br/>
environment so children can get what they need in the best way. Our<br/>
adaptability is what has allowed us to be so successful in exploiting a wide<br/>
variety of environments.<br/>
<br/>
I went looking for some report about the Polynesians and weaning but came<br/>
across a report of how certain tribes find mothers and fathers sexually<br/>
stimulating infants to be perfectly normal and calming for them, where there<br/>
was a strong connection between nursing and sexual stimulation.<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hugcares.org/ph/childhod/chch62dm.htm">http://www.hugcares.org/ph/childhod/chch62dm.htm</a> -- the reseach appears to<br/>
have all done by men and seems chock full of bias but that doesn&#39;t negate<br/>
the practices they observed regardless of what conclusions they drew from<br/>
them.) Most cultures as so full of taboos and the baggage of cultural<br/>
practices that made sense for a situation that no longer exists that it&#39;s<br/>
very hard to determine what is natural and what is unnatural from what<br/>
people do and have done in the past. I think the best we can do is to become<br/>
more aware of why we are choosing to do certain things so we can throw off<br/>
our own cultural baggage rather than taking on the baggage of others because<br/>
we assume they&#39;re more natural.<br/>
