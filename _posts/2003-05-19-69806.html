Do you know if the digests count as the same amount of space as the <br/>
individual emails?  My ds-6 with medical disabilities is often <br/>
hospitalized suddenly, and it can be days before I check my email.  <br/>
My mailbox has been shut down twice because of excessive mail, and <br/>
I&#39;m afraid of tempting fate with a third event.  Consequently, I read <br/>
the mail at the website...it&#39;s inconvenient, but I&#39;ve been able to <br/>
keep my mailbox from self-destructing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry Debbie, I really don&#39;t know the answer to your question. <br/>
Maybe someone else does? I&#39;ve never had those types of probelms with <br/>
receiving e-mails.  Maybe just try digest for a while and see what <br/>
happens. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck~<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your mailbox probably has a maximum amount of storage space allowed for your <br/>
inbox.  The digests will be about the same MB (space) as individual mails.  <br/>
So, you will still reach your limit if you don&#39;t clean your inbox out often.<br/>

by reading and lurking. Honestly, it&#39;s a time issue for me. I find that I&#39;m<br/>
barely able to keep up with just reading, never mind posting, but I don&#39;t<br/>
want to unsub, either, or even read at the yahoo website. I recently<br/>
switched to digest to cope with the volume, and I think it has helped a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not afraid of posting, like I explained, it&#39;s not having enough time. I<br/>
enjoy this list and learn so much from it, I feel it&#39;s one of my addictions!<br/>
LOL  I just can&#39;t give it up. I bet there&#39;s more out there like me - at<br/>
least one or two. :-)<br/>
