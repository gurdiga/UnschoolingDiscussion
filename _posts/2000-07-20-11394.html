you must have a great memory!  I can never remember all the clever things my <br/>
kids have do.  I have to write them down somewhere.  It is amazing what I <br/>
have already forgotten about Ali being a new toddler....just too many things <br/>
going on I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137308575">Thanks!  acutally H has an AMAZING memory!  She can tell us <br/>
about thigns that she/we did long ago.  Like we were driving past <br/>
a restaurant, around xmas last year, and she told us that we&#39;d <br/>
been there when she was 3 and she&#39;d had prawns (for her <br/>
birthday, she was 4 last October...) and then there had been <br/>
fireworks, and they were really noisy and she was very scared.  <br/>
(this is what she told us.  It was more than a year before.  The <br/>
fireworkd were part of a display we saw on the way home for <br/>
Guy Fawkes night.)<br/>
<br/>
She asked me about the farm, and whether daddy had been, and I <br/>
told her yes, he was there when u got in with the donkeys...<br/>
<br/>
Tracy<br/>
PS,  it will get better.  Honestly, it will.  people kept telling me this <br/>
and i didn&#39;t believe them...<br/>
