<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373261695">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
After a couple of weeks going back and forth with yahoo, I can finally<br/>
receive mail again from the list (my mail kept simply bouncing out of my<br/>
mailbox for some unknown reason).  Anyway, I had to change my ID, I used to<br/>
be jnjstau and am now callingmoon, but am still Julie in Texas.  I missed<br/>
you guys.<br/>
<br/>
About sibling fighting, my kids are all fairly close in age and often get<br/>
along really well and sometimes really fight.  I try to take a look at what<br/>
is going on behind the fighting.  Usually, somebody stayed up late and is<br/>
tired or its about lunch time and somebody is getting hungry.  Sometimes,<br/>
the kids are just looking for attention from the other kids or they are kind<br/>
of transitioning in their interests and are somewhat at wit&#39;s end as to what<br/>
to do with themselves.  So of course, they torment a sibling.<br/>
<br/>
When we have a particularly bad spell, we have a &quot;lock down&quot;.  At least that<br/>
is what we called it when I worked on an adolescent psychiatric unit.<br/>
Everything becomes of secondary importance to getting our family back on<br/>
track.  We talk, hug, cry, yell with each other.  Whatever needs to happen<br/>
so that people feel listened to and again committed to our family.  We talk<br/>
a lot about our family being a team and us needing to work together not<br/>
against each other.<br/>
