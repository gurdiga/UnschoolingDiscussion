<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061325115">we are enjoying wizard101. but, after a while, you can&#39;t do any more tasks<br/>
without paying ($10/mo). still, it would be fun to test it out - we loved it<br/>
so much that we are paying now. we didn&#39;t like club penguin or pixie hollow.<br/>
we do have webkinz. good luck!<br/>

cheers, jessie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405136017">Megan is a big fan of Wolfquest. You play as a wolf. A new version is coming soon. The game is 100% free. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s recently found &quot;Impressive Title&quot; (such a cheeky name, lol). It seems to have been created by someone who loved The Lion King because the graphics are very similar and you play as a lion. Also free.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I of the Dragon&quot; is another game. You play as a dragon. The demo is free.  <br/>
<br/>
Webkinz has been a huge hit here for over three years. My husband & I have our own accounts. You buy a stuffed animal ($10 -$17) & it comes with an access code that is good for a year or so. <br/>
<br/>
Neopets wasn&#39;t popular with Megan - she didn&#39;t like the way things looked. The games on Neopets & Webkinz are similar - Webkinz is kind of like Neopets&#39; cuddlier cousin.<br/>
<br/>
There is also Furcadia, but we didn&#39;t really play it. Megan didn&#39;t like the graphics.  <br/>
<br/>
What about The Sims? Or Zoo Tycoon?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Zoo Tycoon (in its many permutations) was Michelle&#39;s favorite PC game  <br/>
for years. I remember her announcing that she could *really* read,  <br/>
because she could recognize &quot;reticulated giraffe&quot;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449437799">This is not so much directed at the OP (original poster), but I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s meant by &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, in terms of paying a membership fee.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking because I said that for a few years - no, we can&#39;t afford that! Monthly fee?! No way! <br/>
<br/>
When the truth is, my finances were in such disarray, I couldn&#39;t have honestly told you if we *could* afford it or not! It just felt overwhelming, to add one more thing.<br/>
<br/>
During those months I was saying &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, I&#39;m sure I spent more than $9.99 on Starbucks, or books for myself, or eating out. I was saying &quot;can&#39;t&quot; but really meant &quot;can&#39;t be bothered to get organized enough to see if we can&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship I have with my boys, and wanting to continue unschooling even as a single, working mom, was enough to motivate me to finally look at budgeting, making a spending plan, etc. AND to get honest with how *I* was spending money, but telling the boys &quot;no&quot;. (Wow, that&#39;s still painful to admit!)<br/>
<br/>
Evan, my oldest, played Phantasy Star Universe on his XBox. He had an account that was free that allowed him to play online with others, but was only good for one month. After the month was up, he&#39;d either have to pay for an account or he&#39;d lose all of his points and levels and have to start over again. Because of my overwhelm, we didn&#39;t pay. There was a whole group of friends he had for whom this was the case (the not paying - not sure about the overwhelm!); they kind of formed their own community. He stopped playing after about six months or so.<br/>
<br/>
Years later, recently, his brother found the game, and asked for an account. I was in a much more stable, honest place financially. Looked things over - yep! We can do that. Evan got an account, too, and started playing again. They both had SO MUCH fun on that game, got really high levels, upleveling their partner machines, etc. At one point, I apologized to Evan and told him I was very sorry to have not been willing to pay for the membership fee before. He said it really wasn&#39;t that big a deal to him, he was still XBox friends with some of the people from the free PSU accounts, and he understood.<br/>
<br/>
Seth has gone through phases of online gaming, with ToonTown and FusionFall. He&#39;ll play intently for a while, then not at all. He chose paying for Phantasy Star Universe over FusionFall, when we weren&#39;t able to pay for both. The only thing I&#39;m paying for now for him is XBOX Live, and because of gift cards we got for Christmas, he&#39;s good with that for a while. They are both &quot;done&quot; with Phantasy Star Universe, for now.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly everything we do is a *choice*. I was choosing Starbucks over my kids, but believing &quot;can&#39;t&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I&#39;m certainly NOT saying Belinda&#39;s doing that, but I wanted to share my story here. It&#39;s worth looking a little more deeply at &quot;can&#39;t&quot; any time it pops up.<br/>

peace,<br/>

 <br/>
This was exactly what I was thinking too.  I KNOW that there are things that I&#39;m willing to pay for and some things I&#39;m not.  I try to be really honest about that with my kids.  When a family struggles to make ends meet, and believe me, I know what that&#39;s like, one of the worst things to do is pass on that feeling of lack to your kids.  Even if you are really tight financially, there is generally wiggle room somewhere.  <br/>
 <br/>
Think about all the things a person can spend $10 on every month.  It&#39;s a very insignificant amount of money.  I spend more than that on gas each week.  I can buy 3 loaves of bread for that much money, or I can make my own bread and spend a small fraction of that on bread, instead.  It&#39;s only one example.<br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling requires creativity in meeting the needs/wants of your kids.  Looking into free games is but one way to meet needs.  Really examining the cost of an online game is yet another.  ToonTown has a $25 card that you can purchase at Target and will cover 3 months, that&#39;s less than $10 per month.  Three months would get a kid right into spring at this point, where they may likely be getting antsy to get out of the house and play less online.<br/>
 <br/>
Monthly subscriptions don&#39;t have to last forever and probably most of those accounts are saved so that a person can suspend and reactivate and keep all their stuff.  Our whole family tends to back waaaay off online activity during the spring and summer months.  Fall and winter are mostly spent indoors, so naturally we all tend to do stuff online more.<br/>

Consider finding learning in all kinds of things, and fun in all kinds <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-884832925">&lt;&lt;&lt; I&#39;m new to all this.. so I apologize if I rubbed anyone the wrong way...<br/>
I just struggle to let my ADHD child play games all day that make him wild <br/>
and want to run around the house....&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No one is rubbed the wrong way by honest questions from folks new to <br/>
unschooling or this list.<br/>
<br/>
How long has your child been out of school? How long have you been <br/>
unschooling? Are you still deschooling? (I suspect yes since you say you are <br/>
new.)<br/>
<br/>
I would ask you to consider whether ADHD, a school based diagnosis, is a <br/>
good concept to be bringing home with your child. There are so many parts of <br/>
ADHD that only matter in a school setting. I have no idea whether my dd <br/>
would be diagnosed ADHD if she were in school. It is irrelevant to how we <br/>
spend our time unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Consider too the logic of what you have just written. ADHD is supposed to be <br/>
an INability to concentrate or focus for any length of time, yet you write <br/>
that your son wants to play computer games &quot;all day&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Is it really &quot;all&quot; day? Often we find that people write &quot;all day&quot; when what <br/>
they really mean is &quot;longer than I am comfortable with&quot;. One answer is to <br/>
invest mental and emotional energy in learning what your child loves about <br/>
the games, and finding ways to become more comfortable with longer game <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean by &quot;wild&quot;? Is it just a desire to get out some restless <br/>
energy? Is it actually a response to being dragged away from his passion <br/>
before he is ready? Have you made sure he has enough snacks and drinks while <br/>
he plays?<br/>
<br/>
Is it the games that cause it, or is it the fact of having been sitting <br/>
still for a while? My 10 yo dd certainly gets physically antsy at times when <br/>
she has been hunkering down at home for a day or two, whether that be to <br/>
play a lot of computer games, do a lot of drawing or any other largely <br/>
sedentary activity. Usually she will want to go to the park for while, or do <br/>
more physical stuff at home, including yoga and sofa balancing, and some <br/>
kicking and wrestling. Sometimes she is rowdy before sleep.<br/>
<br/>
How can you describe his energy in positive, empowering terms rather than as <br/>
a problem to eliminated?<br/>
<br/>
How can you support and facilitate his need for some exercise towards the <br/>
end of his day?<br/>
<br/>
We used to grab our flashlights and go for night walks in our neighborhood. <br/>
That&#39;s how we saw the little owl that time.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to get him to be still, perhaps try asking him about his <br/>
gaming experience while he jumps or climbs. A small trampoline? A jump rope? <br/>
You will know whether these activities are possible. (One of the reasons we <br/>
tend to go for a walk is that we live on the second floor.)<br/>
<br/>
First coming to unschooling can turn your whole mind inside out - it can <br/>
seem like nothing you say is right, that people are asking you to question <br/>
everything (we kinda are), that we get really knitpicky about every little <br/>
word and detail.<br/>
<br/>
The words you write can reveal shadow assumptions, and we change our <br/>
thinking by examining our words. As a tip - avoid unexamined colloquialisms <br/>
or making the assumption that we will &quot;know what you mean&quot; - case in point <br/>
the phrase &quot;all day&quot;.  Be as accurate and straightforward as possible, and <br/>
err on the side of the full story rather than brevity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869674125">I agree with this post, as I have been there.  Always saying &quot;no&quot;, but not really knowing.  It&#39;s interesting, but my husband&#39;s work has really slowed down (he&#39;s a carpenter) which has made us take a long hard look at our financial situation, and we have been able to free up more money now that he isn&#39;t working as much due to us being very frugal in certain areas.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for the past year my 7 year old has had memberships to 2 sites at a time (what we can afford), and besides ToonTown, none has lasted longer than 3 months.  He does all that he can and gets bored and moves on.  So I NEVER do the 6/month memberships to save money, as he never plays anything longer than a couple months.<br/>

&gt; ****This is not so much directed at the OP (original poster), but I&#39;m wondering what&#39;s meant by &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, in terms of paying a membership fee.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m asking because I said that for a few years - no, we can&#39;t afford that! Monthly fee?! No way! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When the truth is, my finances were in such disarray, I couldn&#39;t have honestly told you if we *could* afford it or not! It just felt overwhelming, to add one more thing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; During those months I was saying &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, I&#39;m sure I spent more than $9.99 on Starbucks, or books for myself, or eating out. I was saying &quot;can&#39;t&quot; but really meant &quot;can&#39;t be bothered to get organized enough to see if we can&quot;.****<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; This was exactly what I was thinking too.  I KNOW that there are things that I&#39;m willing to pay for and some things I&#39;m not.  I try to be really honest about that with my kids.  When a family struggles to make ends meet, and believe me, I know what that&#39;s like, one of the worst things to do is pass on that feeling of lack to your kids.  Even if you are really tight financially, there is generally wiggle room somewhere.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Think about all the things a person can spend $10 on every month.  It&#39;s a very insignificant amount of money.  I spend more than that on gas each week.  I can buy 3 loaves of bread for that much money, or I can make my own bread and spend a small fraction of that on bread, instead.  It&#39;s only one example.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Unschooling requires creativity in meeting the needs/wants of your kids.  Looking into free games is but one way to meet needs.  Really examining the cost of an online game is yet another.  ToonTown has a $25 card that you can purchase at Target and will cover 3 months, that&#39;s less than $10 per month.  Three months would get a kid right into spring at this point, where they may likely be getting antsy to get out of the house and play less online.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Monthly subscriptions don&#39;t have to last forever and probably most of those accounts are saved so that a person can suspend and reactivate and keep all their stuff.  Our whole family tends to back waaaay off online activity during the spring and summer months.  Fall and winter are mostly spent indoors, so naturally we all tend to do stuff online more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are really into Dizzywood here! (www.dizzywood.com). My daughter Roxie is 7 in a few months and adores it. I actually love playing it with her too, and she recently convinced her dad to get a character as well.  We play it together on 2 separate computers, which is really fun and I read out any instructions and missions she wants to do. You can do lots on it for free. We played it free for months and only recently got a membership ($7.95 usd per month for 3 months) which opens up more of the &#39;world&#39; and things you can do. I also think the graphics are great and it&#39;s really easy to learn and get around, there&#39;s some quite challenging games in it too. Can you tell we love it!<br/>
<br/>
 We also tried &#39;Club Penguin&#39; which is a similar format, but didn&#39;t get into it as much. I&#39;ve also had a brief look at &#39;Fantage&#39;, &#39;Super Secret&#39;, &#39;Franktown Rocks&#39; and &#39;Runescape&#39; they all look pretty cool and you can play for free till you want to go on more missions etc... Runescape is too scary for my daughter, but the others look cute. We haven&#39;t played them so I can&#39;t say a lot about them or recommend, but I thought i&#39;d mention just in case you wanna check &#39;em out (you can google them).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943402047">I do feel bad because sometimes I may say something the wrong way or it&#39;s interpreted differently than how I meant it.  (which can happen with e-mails anyway)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure some of this will sound like I&#39;m rambling, which is just how I am. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son has been out of school for about a month. I&#39;m still researching different homeschool techniques.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure &quot;wild&quot; was the wrong word to use.  So if he&#39;s restless, and full of energy... I should find him something active to do? I don&#39;t really mind him being full of energy, but it usually leads to him singing.. which is great, but he makes up innapropriate songs.<br/>
<br/>
If his sisters are around he will call them pests, etc. and if he gets upset with them he&#39;ll threaten them to the extent of wanting to smack them beat them. I&#39;m not saying all that is &quot;because&quot; of him playing video games or some computer games, but it happens A Lot more after he&#39;s played for hours. So rather than saying he becomes &quot;wild&quot; he becomes restless, which usually leads to him being obnoxious and aggressive.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 I do make sure that he is eating and drinking throughout the day. However, I don&#39;t want him eating and drinking while sitting on the couch.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My husband has very little patience. To be honest, he has more of a problem with him &quot;playing video games all day&quot;  than I do.  You&#39;re right, &quot;all day&quot; = &quot;more than I am comfortable with&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was actually quite surprised that my husband let me pull our son out of school. He was brought up a certain way and was in the Navy for 10 years, so he expects us to do something constructive with 99% of our time.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not as strict as my husband, but I would like &quot;something&quot; to be accomplished during the day. If my son&#39;s room is messy, he&#39;s left clothes all over his bathroom (along with garbage, etc.), he has left his things laying around all over the house and wants to play video games rather than pick anything up, then I am not happy about that choice.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It is true that ADHD is usually diagnosed in schools. (he also struggles with depression/anxiety and might be bi-polar or have Aspergers)  I&#39;m not so concerned with his inability to focus, more with his excessive energy. At home it&#39;s not always a big deal, but I would like him to act &quot;appropriately&quot; when we are at other people&#39;s houses or at a restaurant, etc. I want all of my kids to be respectful of others.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 My daughter just turned six and I think she is ADHD, although she hasn&#39;t been diagnosed yet. We will call her name 10 times before she will respond and she has a hard time sitting in her seat at school and focusing. (I witnessed it when I helped out at a school party)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to home-school all my kids eventually. For now, my girls LOVE school, so I will probably let them finish out the year. My son needed out desperately. School was killing his self esteem and he was feeling &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;useless&quot;.  I am working to heal all that.  I know that he is creative and very smart.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to learning more about this, but I&#39;m sure most of you can understand what a new concept it can be to people. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess I have some random questions about all this. (to everyone)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We are a religious family and want to instill values and morals in our children. We certainly don&#39;t want to shove it down their throats though and have them rebel. That happened to both myself and my husband. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So for those of you who are religious, does that fit into your unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do you limit anything? Do you just let your kids do what they want all day?  What about chores/bathing/getting dressed/meal time?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My son has strong interests which are: Video Games, Legos, internet, playing with action figures.  He does like the Wii Fit. He was doing that yesterday which I thought was great. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate you trying to help me understand all this and I appreciate your &quot;tone&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

    I can only speak for myself on here. But as the original postee, I was<br/>
not offended. My 10 yo daughter also has ADHD, but she can sit for hours<br/>
playing video games. I have found that as she plays them more, her reading<br/>
improves. So it is actually helping her.  I also like the ones where they<br/>
have to solve a problem like math or to spell a word in order to continue<br/>
doing something on the game.  But that is my opinion.<br/>

Both of those pages are about the terms parents choose to comment on  <br/>
their children.  From the first one:<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
Goodness, I didn&#39;t realize I would be offending so many by the use of  <br/>
the word &quot;lazy&quot;. The meaning of that word is &quot;unwilling to work.&quot;<br/>
No one&#39;s offended. It&#39;s discussion. It&#39;s stepping back and discussing  <br/>
the concept, the *idea*, of labeling someone lazy.<br/>
<br/>
If we use negative words in relation to our kids they internalize that  <br/>
and can live up to those words. They become the labels we put on them.  <br/>
Or they can decide we have no clue about who they are and decide not  <br/>
to listen to us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871675545">***My son has been out of school for about a month. I&#39;m still researching different homeschool techniques.***<br/>
 <br/>
There should be a deschooling process that needs to happen.  Even hardcore school at homers recommend deschooling. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m sure &quot;wild&quot; was the wrong word to use. So if he&#39;s restless, and full of energy... I should find him something active to do? I don&#39;t really mind him being full of energy, but it usually leads to him singing.. which is great, but he makes up innapropriate songs.***<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe he likes the shock value of innappropriate songs!  People have made livings off of shock value.  I wouldn&#39;t dismiss it entirely, shock value requires being clever.  That doesn&#39;t mean that he needs to sing about farts at the dinner table.  Think time and place.<br/>
<br/>
***I do make sure that he is eating and drinking throughout the day. However, I don&#39;t want him eating and drinking while sitting on the couch.***<br/>
 <br/>
Why?  You don&#39;t have to answer on list, but it will help you maybe to think about the rules you have in your house.  Is there a place that he can eat and drink and play video games?<br/>
<br/>
***Now, I&#39;m not as strict as my husband, but I would like &quot;something&quot; to be accomplished during the day. If my son&#39;s room is messy, he&#39;s left clothes all over his bathroom (along with garbage, etc.), he has left his things laying around all over the house and wants to play video games rather than pick anything up, then I am not happy about that choice.***<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not a real choice then.  My 15 yr old daughter has always been messy.  I&#39;ve picked up after her for years.  I&#39;ve cleaned her room and her bathroom because she appreciates it and I like it cleaner than she keeps it.  Just this last month she&#39;s decided that she wants to keep her room and bathroom clean, and just like that she&#39;s doing it, no prompting from me.  It&#39;s very internal, for personal reasons.  She has friends who&#39;s parents MAKE them do these things and it&#39;s a constant struggle of power.  These kids will not do any of it without being told to do it first.  That&#39;s what forced chores do to a person, it ensures that mom and dad must ask and make sure that their child does it, and it ensures that it won&#39;t happen unless mom and dad make sure it happens.<br/>
 <br/>
Is that your intended goal, to be the keeper of your son&#39;s cleanliness until he moves out?  If it&#39;s not, then it really will help to examine that aspect of your life.  It will help too, to see his messes as life happening.  Living is messy.  Clothing is easy to pick up, just do it if you want it done.  It will go a long way towards happiness and helping to create a happy nest for your children to explore in.  Here&#39;s something else on chores... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/kidstohelpwithchores.html%c2%a0and">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/influencing%20kid%20behavior/chores/kidstohelpwithchores.html%c2%a0and</a> more here... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores/">http://sandradodd.com/chores/</a><br/>
<br/>
***It is true that ADHD is usually diagnosed in schools. (he also struggles with depression/anxiety and might be bi-polar or have Aspergers) I&#39;m not so concerned with his inability to focus, more with his excessive energy.***<br/>
 <br/>
That label is harmful.  His depression and anxiety could be recreated at home unless you are careful not to.  Some of these links may help...<br/>

<br/>
***My daughter just turned six and I think she is ADHD, although she hasn&#39;t been diagnosed yet. We will call her name 10 times before she will respond and she has a hard time sitting in her seat at school and focusing. (I witnessed it when I helped out at a school party)***<br/>
 <br/>
How wonderful that your child has the ability to tune out nonsense and focus on something more important to her.  You should read the book Clementine, it&#39;s a cute kid&#39;s book, probably perfect for a 6 yr old, it&#39;s a short chapter book, all about a girl who really pays attention, but is always accused of not.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m open to learning more about this, but I&#39;m sure most of you can understand what a new concept it can be to people.***<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s another link to check out...  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/beginning">http://sandradodd.com/beginning</a><br/>
<br/>
I guess I have some random questions about all this. (to everyone)<br/>
<br/>
***We are a religious family and want to instill values and morals in our children. We certainly don&#39;t want to shove it down their throats though and have them rebel. That happened to both myself and my husband. <br/>
<br/>
So for those of you who are religious, does that fit into your unschooling?***<br/>
 <br/>
You will be way more effective if you don&#39;t force, but do it because it&#39;s something you love and believe and want to share.  Just like offering a plate of delicious food, some will be eaten and some will not.  That is how people are.<br/>
<br/>
***My son has strong interests which are: Video Games, Legos, internet, playing with action figures. He does like the Wii Fit. He was doing that yesterday which I thought was great. ***<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447129991">***I have found that as she plays them more, her reading<br/>
improves. So it is actually helping her. I also like the ones where they<br/>
have to solve a problem like math or to spell a word in order to continue<br/>
doing something on the game. But that is my opinion.***<br/>
 <br/>
That may be what you like, but what does the video game player like?  <br/>
 <br/>
My oldest daughter learned how to read and spell and type and chat through online role playing games and various other video games.  She still plays Pokemon on her DS.  That has a huge amount of math and strategy and memorization involved.  Leveling characters up involves numbers and strategy, both are hugely mathematical.<br/>
 <br/>
Kids will learn more doing things they like.  That&#39;s partly why schools try to make learning &quot;fun&quot; by using cute worksheets or playing games or watching videos and what not.  In the absence of school and school goals of trying to get kids to attain certain knowledge and skill sets, kids can do what they find fun and learn through that.  It rarely looks like school.  <br/>
 <br/>
As my oldest has gotten older she looks less and less like a school kid.  What she does is far from what any average school kid does, but it doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t learning.  The goal is different.  She learns because you can&#39;t not learn, she learns because she wants to, she learns about all kinds of things because life is interesting and full of interesting things to learn.  Schools have this insideous way of making learning yucky and distasteful.  <br/>
 <br/>
Video games are fun, they are designed to be fun and entertaining.  Don&#39;t make them yucky and distasteful, see the learning that is happening BECAUSE they are fun and entertaining.<br/>
 <br/>
