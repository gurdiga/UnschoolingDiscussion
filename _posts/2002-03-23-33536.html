When I left the list in December (I think it was) there were no moderators.  <br/>
Now that I&#39;ve returned, nobody  met me at the door and said &quot;Here are the <br/>
rules,&quot; and I didn&#39;t even get a &quot;Welcome to this yahoolist letter&quot; (maybe <br/>
because I joined when yahoo was shutting down for the weekend?  Maybe others <br/>
got letters).  But to say you can only do things this way or that way is in a <br/>
technical way and not just a philosophical way is too complicated for me.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on unschooling-dotcom came in one day and wanted her free information <br/>
NOW, quick, and it had to match her ADHD son, and she specified she did NOT <br/>
want anyone questioning the validity of ADHD.    I objected to her telling <br/>
other peole how to give free information.<br/>
<br/>
When I was first in here someone said &quot;mindful&quot; wasn&#39;t a good word to use.   <br/>
I can see being told not to use &quot;fuc*&quot; but not being told not to use <br/>
&quot;mindful.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Is it a game with arbitrary rules or is it real, living, immediate <br/>
communication in the real world?<br/>

IMO, all of those things you mentioned should happen when somebody joins the<br/>
list. A welcoming letter, which includes the list rules or expectations of<br/>
its members. I prefer specifics you can post addys of other lists but you<br/>
cant tell somebody to head on outta here. You can vehemently object to a<br/>
post but that objection needs to be strictly about the content and not the<br/>
post*er*.<br/>
I know lots of folks here dont care for rules and I can see their POV as<br/>
well. It was a tough call back when the moderators were appointed and its<br/>
still a tough issue. I feel that a more clearly defined outline of what can<br/>
and cant go on on the list would clear up that confusion.<br/>
Oh well, just an opinion and they are a dime a dozen these days :-)!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t mean that exactly those words should be used.  I meant getting <br/>
across the idea that the person is welcome to stay here, but they might get <br/>
more support for their homeschooling style on list X or Y<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re way smarter than that, Sandra.  &lt;g&gt;  I wasn&#39;t even suggesting it be <br/>
a rule.  I was trying to find a way to get past the hostilities with as few <br/>
rules as possible.  This list and some of the people on it have a history, <br/>
and there are obviously some people on it with baggage between themselves.<br/>
<br/>

didn&#39;t much like the term.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is it a game with arbitrary rules or is it real, living, immediate<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s real, living, immediate communication in the real world that shouldn&#39;t <br/>
require rules but seems to need a few anyway.<br/>
