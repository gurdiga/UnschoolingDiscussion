<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000729882">-=-I grew up with the idea that being allowed to &quot;think for yourself&quot;  <br/>
is earned with age, as if adding another year to your life made you  <br/>

practice. Better to get that experience now, while your parents are  <br/>
right there to help you through it, than later when everyone expects  <br/>
you to just be able to handle it on your own and you are brand new at  <br/>
it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a quote from a blog entry by Kristen/littlerooh, writing about  <br/>
her kids&#39; online writings, about how they&#39;re not always &quot;nice,&quot; but  <br/>
how much they can learn from being online.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is learning html in leaps and bounds.  No one has told her  <br/>
&quot;that&#39;s programming.&quot;  No one has said &quot;This is the same as website  <br/>
building.&quot;  To her she is &quot;just&quot; working on her myspace page.<br/>
<br/>
I could (as Kristen discussed) try to control and limit my kids.  But  <br/>
that would be making them smaller and their world smaller.  So I  <br/>
encourage them, even though sometimes they embarrass me.  I give them  <br/>
real information about what could be problematical about putting  <br/>
things out there that might offend others.  Then they make their own  <br/>
decisions.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never said anything racist around my chidlren, and have never <br/>
allowed anyone else to. But lately, my 12 year old have been making <br/>
racist remarks. I&#39;ve caught him posting it on messageboards too. <br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to form their own opinions--but in this case, he&#39;s <br/>
expressing an opinion that I don&#39;t want him to have. I&#39;vwe tried <br/>
tallking to him about it and trying to sway his opinion. I&#39;ve ven <br/>
threatened to take away his internet priveleges if he continues to <br/>
post hate speech. <br/>
<br/>
Was wondering whether or not you should allow your kids to their own <br/>
opinions if those opinions are dangerous. <br/>

Those are two extremes, trying to sway him and trying to remove his  <br/>
&quot;privileges.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is this the same son wanting to find scientific evidence of Christian  <br/>
claims about creationism?<br/>
Who&#39;s he hanging out with?<br/>
<br/>
If one of my children was doing something potentially illegal I would  <br/>
probably be willing to introduce a few pieces of evidence or  <br/>
persuasion.  If it&#39;s something that could get him in trouble, that  <br/>
could affect our freedom to homeschool or to stay together as a  <br/>
family.  If the state or county were to investigate something that  <br/>
could be turned toward delinquency or hate crimes, the parent might  <br/>
be considered negligent.  The child could be removed from the home.   <br/>
That&#39;s extreme, but maybe worth mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
Does he believe what he&#39;s writing, or is he posturing to impress  <br/>
someone else?<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has a friend who has made a couple of prejudiced comments.  I  <br/>
addressed the friend directly, and kind of belittled his opinionâ€” <br/>
pointed out evidence to the contrary of which I knew he was aware,  <br/>
and then just kept my gaze on him.  It was basically a challenge and  <br/>
a stare-down that I won.  It was for the benefit of my children both  <br/>
directly and indirectly.  They could see that such comments could be  <br/>
diffused/defused, and they saw the he wasn&#39;t willing or able to  <br/>
defend them.<br/>
<br/>
How long has your son been unschooled?  How much time does he spend  <br/>
with you and his dad?<br/>

Please try not to blur the line by calling that &quot;not really  <br/>
unschooling,&quot; which does imply it&#39;s sort of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He might be right about the freedom of speech.  Maybe you and he  <br/>
together could research what is legal and illegal about posting  <br/>
things.  There are special problems with the internet, because it&#39;s  <br/>
interstate and international.  It&#39;s not just U.S. law involved.   You  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to be sitting together at the same time to do that, but  <br/>
it might be something that would bring the two of you closer  <br/>
together.  Instead of you saying it&#39;s bad and him saying &quot;Huh uh,&quot;  <br/>
find out where the truth really lies about it, or at least where the  <br/>
arguments lie, legally speaking.  That might distract him enough to  <br/>
satisfy you.  Every day he&#39;s older, and could easily grow out of his  <br/>
need to be doing something shocking, if that&#39;s what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could look up some history of the KKK or something fairly  <br/>
easy to research, and share the interesting parts with him.  Maybe  <br/>
instead of resisting his interest you could relax toward it and find  <br/>
some good bad examples to help him see other aspects.  If you move  <br/>
hard and fast toward a wall of shame, you might have all wall, and  <br/>
resistence, and defensiveness, and no shame.  Don&#39;t make it you  <br/>
against him.  Make it about logic and goodness and morality.  Make it  <br/>
about resumes and integrity and trust and becoming a good dad, maybe.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not experienced with racist remarks specifically (that would <br/>
bother me as well- yikes!) so I don&#39;t know how helpful this will <br/>
be...<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about the wording you chose above that suggests <br/>
that you and your son aren&#39;t quite on the same side.  And by &quot;on the <br/>
same side&quot; I don&#39;t mean agreeing about everything, I mean mutual <br/>
respect, genuine interest in each other&#39;s thoughts, and openness to <br/>
input from each other.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;I&#39;ve caught him&quot; thing- I wouldn&#39;t even think in those terms.   <br/>
I&#39;m thinking of a recent scenario here... my son shares his myspace <br/>
pages with me.  I have them bookmarked and check them out now and <br/>
then.  Sometimes I&#39;ve noticed something that I don&#39;t think is a good <br/>
idea to put out there, and recently it was a comment about a local <br/>
boy he&#39;s had some trouble with IRL.  We&#39;d had conversations before <br/>
about posting deragatory things about others online, but I didn&#39;t <br/>
think &quot;I&#39;ve caught him&quot; and I didn&#39;t go lecture him or threaten to <br/>
take away his &quot;priveleges&quot; (really *I* feel priveleged that he <br/>
shares his stuff with me as many of his friends&#39; parents don&#39;t even <br/>
know about their pages).  I waited until the right moment to bring <br/>
it up, told him I noticed what he&#39;d written, and I gave him some <br/>
examples of what I thought were possible repercussions.  He <br/>
genuinely listened, and it led to some conversation about social <br/>
dynamics in general (both online and IRL) and about this boy in <br/>
particular.  The next time I visited his page I noticed that he&#39;d <br/>
removed it even though he didn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to.   <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the parents around me who focus too much on <br/>
control lose their power to influence.  (Parent/Teen Breakthrough: <br/>
The Relationship Approach, which I highly recommend, talks a lot <br/>
about that distinction).<br/>

<br/>
Threats or any activities to prevent him expressing his opinions simply<br/>
because they are different from your own are liable to backfire into secrecy<br/>
and dishonesty. However having a discussion about why you disagree with the<br/>
opinions is a much better course. What I mean is stating your case, and<br/>
listening to his might be better than the proposing that unless he agrees<br/>
with you, here&#39;s a punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Some genuine information about the possible consequences of posting hate<br/>
speech to the internet may be found at:<br/>

t_hate_speech<br/>
<br/>
I just googled &quot;hate speech versus first amendment&quot;, and got a ton of<br/>
webpages. This one is a bibliography with links:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you are concerned that posting racist remarks will make the family a<br/>
target for investigations of any sort, it is worth expressing those worries<br/>
to him in a rational way from an informed position.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being belittled by my mother at different times in my life<br/>
because of differing political or spiritual beliefs. What really rankled on<br/>
top of her nastiness, was her lack of information - truly uniformed not just<br/>
about my position but even about her own conservative stances. She was a<br/>
real knee-jerk reactor, using scorn to express her fear (which led to<br/>
loathing). She also believed that Russia was standing by ready to physically<br/>
invade the USA at any moment.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
:)  My parents said that too.  They didn&#39;t really think it through or<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have said it.  Conversely and at the same time, their<br/>
opinion was and still is that children (no matter how old they get)<br/>
should love and honor their parents to the degree that they don&#39;t balk<br/>
at the philosophies of the parents.  Because they believe that, my<br/>
opinions leave them feeling despised and dishonored even though that&#39;s<br/>
never been my intention.  <br/>
<br/>
The scary thing isn&#39;t that kids might have differing opinions but that<br/>
parents&#39; influence will be too weak or ignored (unless of course the<br/>
parents aren&#39;t a good influence then having a weak/ignored effect on<br/>
kid(s) is a good thing).  <br/>
<br/>
We want to be (a) a *good* influence and (b) influential.  <br/>
<br/>
Having different opinions is not only true and something we all need<br/>
to learn to deal with peaceably (relationships intact) but also<br/>
healthy.  I want the next generation to be an improvement not a blind<br/>
so called &quot;safe&quot; replica of generations before.  It&#39;s not possible to<br/>
relive the past even if it were safe or safer than the unknown future<br/>
of our children.  Getting past the myth of a &quot;safe&quot; past would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Making our relationships so that it&#39;s understood that people don&#39;t<br/>
realize when they&#39;re wrong (because then they might want to correct<br/>
themselves and not be wrong, at which point they would no longer be<br/>
wrong --hehe -Catch 22).  Everybody is wrong about something sometime.<br/>
 It&#39;s not shameful.  Have it understood between us that those who can<br/>
be wrong include parents and other adults.  Otherwise, children may<br/>
grow to believe that kids are automatically wrong and adults are<br/>
automatically right.  That&#39;s a scary idea, whether believed as a kid<br/>
or as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of adults being 100%-correct-and/or-wise leads to incredible<br/>
feelings of powerlessness and possibly the adoption of alien beliefs<br/>
propogated purposedly to fill the void of incompetence that the<br/>
disenfranchised experience, to use the powerless as cogs in some nasty<br/>
machinery. Our kids don&#39;t need to experience powerlessness.<br/>
<br/>
They need to understand their own power.  Helping children to use<br/>
power wisely takes time... and is worth every minute.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068514664">I agree and on my micropath to adulthood springing from totally not<br/>
trusting a word my parents uttered, I eventually learned somewhat at<br/>
least to balance reality with my fantasy of parents who were<br/>
automatically wrong because they bought into the party line, which<br/>
wasn&#39;t ALL bad-- hook line and sinker.  My parents thought of<br/>
themselves as quite nonconformist and, in many ways, they were and<br/>
are.  But by the same token, through often insidious cultural<br/>
influences they were and are a product of their times, the 50s, which<br/>
was in its own way quite a departure from the past.  <br/>
<br/>
Cultural changes really act as springboards for still more change down<br/>
the road.  All based on collective and individual decisions.  Western<br/>
cultures propelled by ever-increasing technology have been comprised<br/>
by such a mob that it can&#39;t seem to act moderately.  The interesting<br/>
thing to me is the strong development of the individual voice in<br/>
modern times directly across from society.  Where moderacy may have<br/>
occasion to show up.  Conscience counts for something in the life of<br/>
the one person who lives it, and that something is what each<br/>
individual is made up of, at their unique heart of hearts.  &quot;What life<br/>
do I want to live?&quot; is a good question, even if I&#39;m not unschooling,<br/>
but paramount if I *am* unschooling.<br/>

I&#39;m reading a fun book on the difference between American Culture and  <br/>
British.  American expectations and assumptions don&#39;t always match  <br/>
the rest of the English speaking world.<br/>
<br/>
I also think there&#39;s a reality in any collection of humans, that only  <br/>
so many will be leaders and the majority will be followers.  And one  <br/>
isn&#39;t just &quot;a leader&quot; or &quot;a follower.&quot;  There&#39;s an instinct to  <br/>
follow, and sometimes leading become inevitable.  It can come down to  <br/>
who&#39;s the most qualified and pressured to lead, in small emergency  <br/>
situations.  And in largescale times of peace, lots of potential  <br/>
leaders can chill.<br/>
<br/>
What I think that has to do with parents needing to be honest and  <br/>
open and thoughtful is two parts:  People can&#39;t just blindly follow  <br/>
along with unschooling.  It has to be internalized in each  <br/>
responsible parent.  One who doesn&#39;t get it can&#39;t convincingly or  <br/>
effectively Do it.  And within the family, no matter how egalitarian  <br/>
the family is set up to be, the parents are the leaders, THEY decided  <br/>
on an egalitarian arrangement, and need to manage that and sell it  <br/>
and make it real.  They can&#39;t do that if they don&#39;t really mean what  <br/>
they say and practice what they preach.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All this is unschooling and mindful parenting is harder than it  <br/>
looks. &lt;g&gt;  Simple but not easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836003968">In my case, as long as both my parents are alive, it would seem to<br/>
take a sincere effort on both their parts because they present such a<br/>
unified front to me even as their 40+ year old child.  It&#39;s that &quot;we&quot;<br/>
thing that many have talked about on this and other discussion boards;<br/>
that while it&#39;s in operation between parent(s)/child, it forms a sort<br/>
of borg-ish monopoly on real relationship.  For many, this may mean<br/>
basically squeezing the life out of the chance to even begin to<br/>
relate, let alone trust.  I don&#39;t like to think such relationships are<br/>
a reality...  that in the dance of control, *Trust* remains a<br/>
non-issue, or a precarious potentiality that doesn&#39;t yet exist and is<br/>
continually out of reach, or perhaps even a word for manipulating<br/>
others.  There are families where sadly the word *Trust* is laughable.<br/>
<br/>
Like you, Patti, I would be absolutely thrilled even if only one of my<br/>
parents were to reach out to me on an open sincere individual basis--<br/>
one-to-one.  Even if it didn&#39;t lead to much depth and I end up sad<br/>
about the overall relationship, I would value the memory of such a<br/>
moment.  Fleeting moments as these have been around a few times with<br/>
both my parents.  As angry as I&#39;ve been with them for much of my life,<br/>
I treasure those times.  I feel we&#39;ve missed each other somehow and<br/>
the people we seem to be to each other covers our true selves.<br/>
<br/>
My reaction is to stretch myself diametrically across from the way I<br/>
was brought up...  take the good, leave the bad and seek out the rest<br/>
of the good elsewhere to complete it.  A lot of work.  I want to<br/>
preserve some things I grew up with, such as alert protective<br/>
parenting, but without attempting to exert mastery and control over ds<br/>
just because he&#39;s a child.  For me, the wholelife aspects of<br/>
unschooling philosophy(ies) answer the level of involvement I want<br/>
which I hope will lead to close yet trusting and trustworthy family<br/>
relationships as well as confidence for everyone in my family to live<br/>
a full life.<br/>

up.  What might be fun is finding time to read while ds is 2 1/2.  I<br/>
should keep a list of things to read with commentaries on why I<br/>
originally thought to read them so the list will mean anything later.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; American expectations and assumptions don&#39;t always match  <br/>
&gt; the rest of the English speaking world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ain&#39;t that the truth.  I&#39;ve only travelled once out of the US.  Mexico<br/>
in the early 90s.  Americans look so weird there. I squirmed a lot<br/>
while on excursions.  I wanted to get some Mexican dust on my clothes<br/>
and shoes, and on my soul too.  We&#39;re too affluent and reliant on our<br/>
wealth for my comfort.  I&#39;ve never felt wealthy before or so ashamed<br/>
of it.  I&#39;m sure the relative importance of money isn&#39;t the only<br/>
difference.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Leadership can be a lot like teaching.  Not everybody is qualified. <br/>
Also some things and people that should lead haven&#39;t the voice or<br/>
calling.  <br/>
<br/>
Yourself.  The most important follower you&#39;ll ever have, the most<br/>
essential of leaders.  It&#39;s not originally my thought that everybody<br/>
leads and everybody follows, even if they don&#39;t realize it.  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting at is we&#39;re led in varying and often conflicting ways<br/>
by other things and people, and choices arise even if we&#39;re barely<br/>
conscious of them.  Leaders come in so many stripes: I come after a<br/>
ton of ancestors, back to how long?  I am younger than a whole bunch<br/>
of people.  I come after them as well as people younger than me who<br/>
have done things I haven&#39;t done, which one day I will do or attempt to<br/>
do.  *Things* influence me too, such as instinct, heredity, culture<br/>
and so on.  <br/>
<br/>
Decisions decisions.  I have no way of knowing for sure if I follow<br/>
simply because something or someone&#39;s idea seems the most pressing at<br/>
the time, although I might think I have my reasons in a row like so<br/>
many ducks.  I mean, how many decisions does a person make everyday? <br/>
Thousands at least, I would think.  All important to some degree or<br/>
you wouldn&#39;t do anything to decide them.  <br/>
<br/>
Leadership, especially leading your own life, means deciding what is<br/>
most crucial and to what purpose.  Yeah... and it&#39;s what makes<br/>
unschooling so mindbendingly difficult to incorporate into life.  To<br/>
distance yourself from seemingly harmless influences that block it<br/>
while you maintain a balance and hold onto reality.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
necessary to become aware and to remind yourself of influences that<br/>
have tainted you.  Yet a sort of burgeoning *instinct* needs to<br/>
develop in order to make radical/wholelife unschooling doable in the<br/>
long run, so that life together is doable and fun.  Of course at first<br/>
you bend your mind, wrap your head around so many aspects, in order to<br/>
*not* take them for granted.  Eventually I hope to get where I don&#39;t<br/>
carefully consciously decide what fits me and my spouse and<br/>
child(ren)&#39;s needs, so much as breathe naturally and consider it<br/>
together from a tranquil place.  At least more often than I do now. <br/>
Not complaining so much as hoping.<br/>

&gt; on an egalitarian arrangement, and need to manage that and sell it  <br/>
&gt; and make it real.  They can&#39;t do that if they don&#39;t really mean what  <br/>
&gt; they say and practice what they preach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this is unschooling and mindful parenting is harder than it  <br/>
&gt; looks. &lt;g&gt;  Simple but not easy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where my &quot;AMEN&quot; comes in.  Unschooling is *definitely* not a<br/>
lazy thing-to-follow/life-to-lead.  Radically or educationally... <br/>
both = tall orders.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295167920">**Yeah... and it&#39;s what makes<br/>
unschooling so mindbendingly difficult to incorporate into life.  To<br/>
distance yourself from seemingly harmless influences that block it<br/>
while you maintain a balance and hold onto reality.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
necessary to become aware and to remind yourself of influences that<br/>
have tainted you.  Yet a sort of burgeoning *instinct* needs to<br/>
develop in order to make radical/wholelife unschooling doable in the<br/>
long run, so that life together is doable and fun.**<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if having gone thru a previous radical or revolutionary <br/>
reassessment of our culture makes moving to unschooling any easier or <br/>
less distressing?  (Not that I was distressed, I&#39;m kind of projecting on <br/>
to other people.)  Would being the first feminist or first entrepreneur <br/>
or first vegetarian in one&#39;s family be good practice for being the first <br/>
unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
Or would previous practice veering from the &quot;norm&quot; not encourage <br/>
independent thought, merely the substitution of one ideology for the <br/>
other?  Following a *new* doctrine instead of the old one probably isn&#39;t <br/>
as difficult as making each deciding step based on independent thought.<br/>

since they seem so vague.)  (That&#39;s the way they come to me!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753472737">I think I know what you mean by being and having firsts in the family.<br/>
 The reason probably varies considerably from person to person as well<br/>
as moment to moment for each person.  I really don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
told I have a certain reputation but I don&#39;t agree that I do things<br/>
only for novelty.  Maybe because that&#39;s saying I don&#39;t think but act<br/>
randomly, or I&#39;m contrary for the sake of showing off or something. <br/>
Not that I&#39;m above showing off.  <br/>
<br/>
Blah blah blah... me me me.  :)  See?  <br/>
<br/>
A frequent joke is if I can do something backwards, I will.  Sure.  I<br/>
like different methods for novelty&#39;s sake as well as curiosity --all<br/>
the &quot;why not,&quot; &quot;how come&quot; and &quot;let&#39;s see&quot; which lots of people don&#39;t<br/>
engage in or care about.  It&#39;s not random behavior in *my* eyes and<br/>
also not my sole characteristic.  <br/>
<br/>
Why unschooling distresses me -- mostly not wanting to change or even<br/>
see what needs changing.  There&#39;s this old yarn: It&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling... it&#39;s me... it&#39;s us.  Trading the purely feminist for<br/>
humanity.  Dh not really adjusting to married life after divorce. <br/>
Changing power structure, ignoring bad advice, finding ways to talk<br/>
without feeling unheard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Following a *new* doctrine instead of the old one probably isn&#39;t <br/>

thought.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It could be said too: &quot;Making each decision based on independent<br/>
thought probably isn&#39;t as difficult as following a &quot;new&quot; doctrine<br/>
instead of the old one.&quot;  (My brain flipped it and then I went back to<br/>
re-read because I knew I got it wrong.)  Looking at unschooling as<br/>
wholesale change is harder, scarier, than taking a step at a time--<br/>
doing being easier than thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
By thinking, I&#39;m asking if we&#39;re able to do unschooling.  Sometimes, I<br/>
think we are and sometimes I think we aren&#39;t.  It&#39;s just life really.<br/>
 It helps to have the name of a somewhat varyingly defined philosophy<br/>
to start with and some ideas to hang your hat on so that you&#39;re not<br/>
just struggling with nameless things floating around in your head and<br/>
heart.<br/>

Hi, Kathe --<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember from earlier in the thread whether you are divorced <br/>
and/or have an unsupportive (of unschooling) husband.<br/>
<br/>
But I guess you are not asking ME to answer your question, rather are <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985295738">I&#39;m asking questions of myself.  Right.  And of others but not of any<br/>
one person.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I are trying to break free of harmful ideas we grew up with,<br/>
and sometimes I wonder if we can do it.  That stuff is so ingrained in<br/>
us.  Unschooling encapsulates ideas that have sent us in some growing,<br/>
happier directions.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning more by posting my questions and thoughts than I have by<br/>
reading (and so much can be had just by reading).  Saying the words<br/>
for what I&#39;m doing in a circle of people who live unschooling.  I need<br/>
that.  I live in an area where people who are or have been unschooling<br/>
are nowhere to be found.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to get it together<br/>
without some help.  And having people to talk with online means so much.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh is not convinced but not adamantly opposed to unschooling as he was<br/>
last year.  He *is* beginning to understand the point of a rich<br/>
environment which is great! even if he can&#39;t bring himself to support<br/>
unschooling.  He definitely wants to homeschool ds who is now only 2<br/>
1/2, and he sees how ds learns things all the time, things we haven&#39;t<br/>
spent time trying to teach him.  His work requires long mandatory<br/>
hours.  Hopefully we can make it to the conference in Albuquerque. <br/>
Keeping my fingers crossed.<br/>
