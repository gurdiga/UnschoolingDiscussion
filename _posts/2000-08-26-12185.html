&lt;&lt; I got tired of <br/>
 switching them and started using my right hand for the mouse or I <br/>
 would use my lefthand and had to remember not to use my index finger <br/>
 to click with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OH MY!  I just realized that whenever my dd does play on the computer we make <br/>
her use the mouse just as it is!!  I NEVER thought about changing the <br/>
buttons!!  Wow, I guess I&#39;ll have to change the mouse and see if there is a <br/>
difference?!  DD does eat, write, and do MOST tasks with her left hand but <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed she throw with her right hand (quite well) and I guess she also <br/>
uses the mouse with her right -- I&#39;ll have to let you know what happens if <br/>
she uses the left with the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks to all who are responding -- the more I read and listen to all <br/>
of you the more confident I am becoming about the hschooling endeavor.  I am <br/>
looking into a support group in my area (DE).<br/>
<br/>
Carron, on the behavior issues -- so far so good!  I guess I have been doing <br/>
the Love and Logic thing *correctly* but I am guessing it is just going to <br/>
take some time.  I only started implementing the whole L&L ideas in January <br/>
of this year.  Also, late that same month my ds was born so we were ALL <br/>
adjusting to life with a newborn.  I&#39;ll keep up the choices and implementing <br/>
my own if she doesn&#39;t make a choice.  Now, I just have to work on REALLY <br/>
keeping my voice calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer and I <br/>
think I REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)  Also, the Library thinks they <br/>
may have the book which they got from the interlibrary loan service -- a <br/>
local college apparently has or will have several copies of the Toddler book <br/>
you referred to -- I am really looking forward to reading it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support and advice!<br/>
<br/>
Michelle in DE</div>

 </span></blockquote>I can relate REALLY well to this. I naturally have a loud voice since <br/>
birth. I was a screamer as an infant. I was so loud that people would <br/>
move away from my parents when they sat down at church. I am also the <br/>
second of six children. It got pretty loud around the house with so <br/>
many kids. It has taken me most of my adult life to hear that I am <br/>
talking louder than everyone else. Now that I have kids, I realize <br/>
that when I am frustrated my volum rises, again. I have learned that <br/>
keeping the radio and t.v. down or off helps a lot. I have also <br/>
learned that when I am REALLY upset with the children to use a softer <br/>
calmer voice. You can almost tell how irritated I am by how calm and <br/>
controled my voice is. It is when things are calm around here that I <br/>
tend to lose control of my volum. I am still working on the control <br/>
in those frustrating times though. Think I always will. Corallyn</div>
