I wish I had a magic wand to make your financial troubles disappear. <br/>
Try to focus on what you do have and work to get the rest under some <br/>
manageable system. Hang in there.<br/>

I am sorry you are struggling.  We have been lucky thus far in that <br/>
we have enough to get by and a little extra but who knows what the <br/>
future holds.  It does give me alot of faith when I hear others tell <br/>
me they are happy with less and are managing.  I am trying to make <br/>
steps towards that on a daily basis.  My dh could care less, he is <br/>
wonderful about being happy with where he is.  His family lost his <br/>
brother in a fire before he was born but that loss effects my dh to <br/>
this day.  He is not materialistic and I am  trying to get better <br/>
about it myself.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a very affluent neighborhood (we bought our house for <br/>
almost nothing and then there was a huge boom).  We have been fixing <br/>
our house ourselves slowly.  Homes in our neighborhood are benig <br/>
knocked down to make way for million dollar homes on the water.  The <br/>
funny thing is me and dh were discussing this the other day.  He <br/>
said, we all spend the same in a sense.  If you have more, you spend <br/>
more but are we truley more free?  For example, I had to pick up <br/>
something from a mom from my mommy & me program.  She lives on the <br/>
water in a very wealthy area.  Her house was all remodoled, HUGE.  <br/>
But, I noticed her windows were still old and so was her kitchen.  I <br/>
thought, here is this woman who probably pays about $20,000 a year a <br/>
in taxes alone and they can&#39;t even have it all.  Even the wealthy <br/>
live above their means, it is just not so obvious to the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is frustrating.  I have a friends who both work and their <br/>
kids are in preschool.  They did the Disney cruise and are planning <br/>
to go again.  I had this twinge of jealousy.  Then I thought, you <br/>
know what I am on vacation with my kids everday!  I could go to work <br/>
and make a nice income and we could have vacations and a bigger house <br/>
but my choices tell me that is not important.<br/>
<br/>
Your beleifs and choices tell you it is more important to give your <br/>
son an amazing childhood and memories.  That family is more important <br/>
than money.  Just try and remember what you enjoy about these choices <br/>
because it is all too easy to see what we do not have.  Lord knows, I <br/>
am trying to remember that too!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689379725">Hi,<br/>
What you are feeling is part of &quot;the theology of consumerism&quot;. <br/>
Stop.<br/>
Step back.<br/>
Think.<br/>
<br/>
Look around - you have so much! Really! You have your own home - so you&#39;re better off then those that are paying rent and on the edge of bankruptcy.<br/>
You speak of people living beyond their means. That&#39;s a symptom of this illness. Consume. Purchase. Covet<br/>
Is your home warm in the winter, cool in the summer?<br/>
Is it dry in the rain and snug in the snow??<br/>
<br/>
What is it you need? A newer model home? A newly remodeld home?<br/>
<br/>
You know what I would do?<br/>
I&#39;d sell the house - and go somewhere else in this great big world and buy a house there! I&#39;d pay less for my mortage..and worry less about my kitchen or my windows - and I won&#39;t ever drive a SUV . <br/>
<br/>
Be happy.<br/>
I know about being broke. I have no property, not even a car - I borrow a van for work.<br/>
I have no credit.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it&#39;s a beautiful day and none of this stuff really means anything.<br/>
<br/>
Shake it off - woman!!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009860498">Laura, <br/>
reading you post brought tears to my eyes.  My DH and I have just<br/>
crawled out of that hole you are talking about.  He was laid off after<br/>
9/11 (he worked for American Airlines in SF).  Luckily, I was able to<br/>
go back to my pre-mommy job and we earned the same amount of money.  <br/>
<br/>
All that ended when my DH decided that he wanted to move us to Fresno,<br/>
CA to be closer to his family.  He just didn&#39;t feel like a man when he<br/>
couldn&#39;t be the one to &quot;bring home the bacon.&quot;  So...off we moved<br/>
(about 3 to 4 hours south of where we were).  He worked several<br/>
different jobs, trying to find something that not only paid the bills<br/>
but made him happy as well.  We lived with his parents for about a<br/>
month before he just couldn&#39;t take it any more and we moved to an apt.<br/>
 Shortly after that, he quit his next job and we were both unemployed<br/>
for about a month.  We had no savings and no income, I still don&#39;t<br/>
know how I managed to pay the bills.  And, let me tell you, there was<br/>
NOTHING extra and I mean nothing.  We turned off the cable and were<br/>
thinking of having the phone turned off when his brother sent us a<br/>
check for $1000!  They didn&#39;t even call to say the money was<br/>
coming...I just went out the mail box one afternoon and there it was.<br/>
 When we called to say thank you they just said that they had been<br/>
there and do that and they wanted to help.  Told us if we needed more,<br/>
to call and not to worry about paying them back.  That&#39;s when things<br/>
started to change for the better.  My husband, through a network of<br/>
old friends, got a great job working for an airline here in town. <br/>
Now, a year later, we own a home and have started to pay some of the<br/>
credit card bills down.  We can just now go to Target or Wal-mart and<br/>
buy a pair of jeans, if we need them.  That&#39;s not to say that we just<br/>
go and spend only that we have less worries now than before.  But, we<br/>
also learned from our mistakes of spending beyond our means.  If we<br/>
had saved when he had that great job with American, we never would<br/>
have been in that mess to begin with.  So....now we put money into a<br/>
savings account every month.  There&#39;s not much there now but, there<br/>
will be soon.<br/>
<br/>
I can honestly say that, we never once fought over money.  Both of us<br/>
have seen what can happen when you start to do that and just didn&#39;t<br/>
want to go there.  That experience only made us more solid that we<br/>
already were.  We can even look back and smile at that time and wonder<br/>
how we ever paid bills and put food on the table.  But, it is true<br/>
what Olga said about the wealthy also living beyond their means.  The<br/>
more money you make, the more you spend.  If you can just hand in<br/>
there, I&#39;m sure things will start to look up.  Something I started to<br/>
do that made me feel better every day.  I kept a journal and every<br/>
night, after my little girl had gone to bed, I wrote 5 things that I<br/>
was thankful for during that day.  Once you start to be grateful and<br/>
thankful for what you DO have, it makes the negitave much easier to<br/>
deal with.  You aren&#39;t alone, try to remember that as well.<br/>
<br/>
Melissa<br/>

&gt; son an amazing childhood and memories.  That family is more important <br/>
&gt; than money.  Just try and remember what you enjoy about these choices <br/>
&gt; because it is all too easy to see what we do not have.  Lord knows, I <br/>
&gt; am trying to remember that too!!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; One thing I&#39;ve noted that is interesting (this is veering off on <br/>
&gt; a tangent,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but oh well here goes) is when people post about their <br/>
&gt; unschooling days,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost all of the posts I&#39;ve read involved going somewhere and <br/>
&gt; buying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something - Target, WalMart, whatever. Buying video games or <br/>
&gt; clothes or <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; toys<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; or books or going out for food or whatever. That&#39;s one thing we <br/>
&gt; just don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do very much of. I can&#39;t remember the last time I was in a Target <br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Walmart - maybe 6 months ago? I don&#39;t buy books in Borders or <br/>
&gt; Barnes and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Noble anymore, I get them at the library or borrow them from <br/>
&gt; friends. Our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clothes are hand-me-downs or thrift stores, and going out to eat <br/>
&gt; (even fast<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; food) happens less than once a month.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I just wrote an email about funds and spending money and deleted <br/>
&gt; it. Then I <br/>
&gt; &gt; read this so now I guess I will add my thoughts. We go to Walmart <br/>
&gt; for diapers <br/>
&gt; &gt; and groceries and we can write a check before Friday and it wont <br/>
&gt; clear till <br/>
&gt; &gt; Saturday. We are actually the ones that went to B & N and I spent <br/>
&gt; 40.00 and <br/>
&gt; &gt; sat and had a capachino (sp) with my son. It was great BUT I did <br/>
&gt; come home to <br/>
&gt; &gt; my husband who said you spent what! We dont have the money! <br/>
&gt; &gt; I go once every couple months.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Yesterday I sat in the kitchen and cried and told him I feel like <br/>
&gt; it will <br/>
&gt; &gt; always be this way. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We own a home and a vehicle each but we are in debt and ready to <br/>
&gt; file <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bankruptcy. I am very depressed about this and have put it off for <br/>
&gt; almost two <br/>
&gt; &gt; years.  We have two mortgages and the second is what caused this <br/>
&gt; whole mess. <br/>
&gt; &gt; There is actually a class action suit against them but it is too <br/>
&gt; far off to <br/>
&gt; &gt; help us. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I too want to go to SC but he says no we cant do it and I didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; even tell <br/>
&gt; &gt; him about the fees to get in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know he works hard and has often worked Saturday&#39;s to make the <br/>
&gt; mortgages <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I know I sound inconsiderate.  He says please dont get a night <br/>
&gt; job and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; dont want to do this either but there has to be a light at the end <br/>
&gt; of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; tunnel..<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think what stresses me the most is when I see these families in <br/>
&gt; their SUV&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; or not counting what is in their cart at the store. I know the <br/>
&gt; grass looks <br/>
&gt; &gt; greener on the other side and no I dont want to be them but it all <br/>
&gt; does way <br/>
&gt; &gt; heavy on my heart.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187475752">&quot;I think what stresses me the most is when I see these families in their<br/>
SUV&#39;s <br/>
or not counting what is in their cart at the store. I know the grass looks <br/>

heavy on my heart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, I have an SUV (so scary to admit here :0)), that we bought used, for<br/>
cash.  I count what is in my cart before it goes in my cart.  Really, before<br/>
I go into the store.  We have no debt, aside from our mortgage - no credit<br/>
cards, no other loans.  We live below our means, on a budget. We don&#39;t<br/>
consider shopping a pastime.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It was not always this way.  I&#39;ve been on the buybuybuy treadmill, I<br/>
remember the nagging guilty feelings at the cash register, the night-time<br/>
worrying, and the thrill of finding a &#39;bargain&#39; on some unnecessary item<br/>
that I just had to have.  When we decided that something had to change, we<br/>
just stopped shopping.  That simple.  We throw away catalogs without looking<br/>
at them.  We came up with a yearly budget.  We agreed never to have another<br/>
credit card.  We only go to a store when there is something we NEED.<br/>
Thinking about what a need is made a huge difference for us.  We started<br/>
putting any money we could find into savings - even if it was .02.  If the<br/>
electric budget was $50, and the bill was $48.50, $1.50 went into savings.<br/>
We couldn&#39;t believe how quickly those small amounts added up.  We do buy<br/>
things that we want, but not on impulse, and not without making sure we can<br/>
spare the money first.  Our whole perspective has changed.  <br/>
<br/>
We are by no means wealthy, and Jon had been laid off for over a year, but<br/>
we are in control of what money we do have.  I don&#39;t think it matters how<br/>
much you make (I&#39;m not talking about truly impoverished families) - anyone<br/>
can make a budget and stick to it if they decide to.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all responsible for our own grass.  If it doesn&#39;t look green enough,<br/>
we&#39;re the only ones who can change it.  The same way we can be at peace in<br/>
our families because of the choices we make, we can be at peace with our<br/>
money because of the choices we make.  ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465716678">You really don&#39;t need to be spending money to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
We hike a lot.   We pack a lunch, peanut butter and jelly and water, and<br/>
go.<br/>
We take our sketch books and some drawing stuff and our binoculars and we<br/>
always find something interesting.   We go to ghost towns, rock quarries,<br/>
old mining camps, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams.   Last week when the sun<br/>
came out we hiked up middle fork Cottonwood creek to Cliff Mountain.  We<br/>
saw so many animals and birds we&#39;re still talking about it.   <br/>
<br/>
Or, we go to the parks.   There are two in our town and several in the<br/>
next town.    When we&#39;re going to be out for the afternoon I take snacks.<br/>
  Our snacks are home made usually, sometimes raisins and nuts.  <br/>
<br/>
We tour places.   The Great Harvest bread company gives tours and when<br/>
you go in everyone gets a big slice of warm bread.   You get to see<br/>
handsome hairy guys tossing great gobs of dough around.  Kids love it.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
Find a fish hatchery!   Last time we went they let Dylan put on waders<br/>
and get into the tank.  Scurry to the nearest rancher&#39;s agra and look at<br/>
the baby chicks and ducks and geese. (and bunnies.)<br/>
<br/>
Go see your friendly local fish and wildlife biologist and see if you can<br/>
tag along sometime when she&#39;s going somewhere.   You usually have to<br/>
drive your own vehicle but once you&#39;re at the destination you have a good<br/>
brain to pick for interesting trivia which will impress your mother in<br/>
law.<br/>
<br/>
You can visit the animal shelter and play with puppies and kittens.<br/>
<br/>
Some museums are free and have great things for kids to do. <br/>
<br/>
We shop for books at the Goodwill or other second hand stores.   Goodwill<br/>
paperbacks are ten cents each here.   We go to library book sales.   <br/>
<br/>
We shop the thrift stores for clothing too.  AND costumes for silly plays<br/>
at home.   <br/>
<br/>
Pick up a belly dance video at the library and try it with your kids.   I<br/>
dare you not to laugh yourself sick. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan had an idea this year to plant a flower bed in the shape of his<br/>
body.  He said he wants to put crime scene tape around it like a fence.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not easy to be struggling financially but if you are not the<br/>
family wage earner I&#39;m recommending you stop worrying about it.  Your<br/>
worry won&#39;t change things and will only affect how you approach each day<br/>
with your kids.   Let your concern be having fun with your kids and leave<br/>
the worry behind.    Things will work out.  <br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids and what do they like to do?   Do you live in the<br/>
city or country.  I&#39;m sure folks here will have some fun ideas for things<br/>
to do.<br/>

juxtaposed it didn&#39;t make it come across the way I was thinking it (which<br/>
was more stream of consciousness). I hope I didn&#39;t inadvertantly make anyone<br/>
feel like I was passing a judgement for going to Borders!<br/>
<br/>
And I really sympathize about the B & N. That&#39;s the one thing I think I miss<br/>
the most. I always used to go to bookstores and never came out empty-handed,<br/>
I love buying books! Well, that and traveling. I just keep thinking that<br/>
these years are short, it&#39;s much more important to be at home with my kids<br/>
than to have my former salary and no time with my children when it counts.<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything but some days you just wish you could have<br/>
your cake and eat it too!<br/>

<br/>
Been there; done that. Filed for bankruptcy. Saved the house, our cars, and <br/>
my small business. Almost ruined the marriage. Severe depression. The hole <br/>
kept getting deeper and deeper.<br/>
<br/>
The bankruptcy---as awful as it was---actually helped in the long run. It&#39;s <br/>
been five years, I guess. It gets better. It doesn&#39;t have to last forever. <br/>
Life sucked for a long time. We were both angry for a long time. And sad. <br/>
 <br/>
I felt so bad for so long. Things got better. A lot better. The cool thing is <br/>
when the money does finally come in, you don&#39;t know what to DO with it! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
We found that we don&#39;t NEED as much as we used to think we did. Life is <br/>
easier now because we know what we really need and what we can do without.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t envy you your position. Happy thoughts---and (((Hugs)))<br/>
