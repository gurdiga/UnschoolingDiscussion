<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783220390">Since we got cable internet, I&#39;ve discovered the joys of listening to radio<br/>
stations from around the world on RealOne Player.  I started exploring the<br/>
classical stations and figured I&#39;d get good stations in Germany.  I was<br/>
right.  But the unexpected side benefit is that my extremely rusty German,<br/>
which wasn&#39;t great to begin with, is improving.  Because I recognize<br/>
composers, cities, even the German names for various kinds of music, I find<br/>
I&#39;m getting a lot of pieces of what&#39;s said, and it&#39;s getting better as I go<br/>
along.  I can&#39;t quite understand the news yet, but I can get a sense of what<br/>
they&#39;re talking about.<br/>

I have a German friend ALWAYS repeatedly trying to get me to listen to German <br/>
radio, and I can&#39;t figure out how to get it.  Maybe because I have a modem <br/>
and not DSL?    I don&#39;t want to listen to German country&#39;n&#39;western enough to <br/>
find out, I guess.    He&#39;s in Seattle and loves being able to get it there.<br/>

broken down by Austrian, German, or Swiss on that one.<br/>

Neither one of those looks like what Wolfgang has sent me, but still... it&#39;s <br/>
a start.<br/>

There&#39;s one with all kinds of stuff, not just German!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You have to download RealOne Player.  Once you have that installed (there&#39;s<br/>
a free version) you click on radio at the bottom.  Then it shows you all the<br/>
genres.  I clicked on classical.  Then you get a list of the free stations.<br/>
They&#39;re mostly from the US, but there are stations in Germany, Norway,<br/>
Sweden, Great Britain, and lots of other places.  You click on the station<br/>
you want, it loads, and away you go.  I&#39;ve put Deutschland Radio Berlin,<br/>
Deutschland Funk in Cologne, and NDR in Hamburg in my favourites.  If she<br/>
likes other music besides classical, there are probably some German stations<br/>
for that as well.  There are several talk stations from Germany.  I never<br/>
tried radio before getting cable.  I think it would have been too slow for<br/>
it.<br/>
Where is your mother from?  My father was born in Hamburg, came to the<br/>
States when he was 13.<br/>
