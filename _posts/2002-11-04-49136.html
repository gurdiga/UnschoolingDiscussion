&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2600<br/>
&gt;Date: Mon, Nov 4, 2002, 6:15 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re a year into unschooling and love it.  My daughter is often<br/>
&gt; asked &quot;what grade are you in?&quot; by people when we&#39;re out and about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m looking for a clever, (but nice) answer to give people, without<br/>
&gt; answering a specific grade.  I&#39;m trying to get away from those<br/>
&gt; schoolish things!  I also don&#39;t want to get into a big discussion in<br/>
&gt; the grocery store, for instance, about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughters just tell people kindly, &quot;I homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once, someone still insisted they wanted to know what grade. &lt;g&gt; Brit looked<br/>
to me and I told her, in front of the stranger, &quot;If you were in school,<br/>
you&#39;d be in third grade&quot; and Brit kindly repeated that information. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This morning, I loaded the wagon up with some of the candy orders Moly took <br/>
for Girl Scouts. I told her some of the people would be easier to deliver to <br/>
during the day. She took her brother along so he could take some orders for <br/>
popcorn. I wasn&#39;t too sure, but thought what the hey! They just came back <br/>
with pink cheeks and out of breath. Most people on our block know the kids <br/>
are at home. One lady asked the kids why they weren&#39;t in school. Moly is <br/>
telling me that Jack told the woman that &quot;My Mom doesn&#39;t believe in school. <br/>
She wants us to grow up smart and happy.&quot; So then she said &quot;Oh, you&#39;re <br/>
homeschooled!&quot; Jack said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t do that either.&quot; Moly said she didn&#39;t <br/>
ask anything else. But she did pay Moly for her candy order and took an order <br/>
for popcorn from Jack. So that was nice. I can just hear her talking to her <br/>
neighbor about those kids down the block! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most times my kids tell people we unschool and since most people around here <br/>
don&#39;t know what they are talking about, they don&#39;t say much. Once a woman <br/>
asked what grade Moly would be in, and Moly told her we don&#39;t do grades. The <br/>
woman wanted to know how Moly knew how well she was doing. Moly said &quot;Well, <br/>
my Mom, Dad, Grandma and Grandpa Edds, Uncle Will and Aunt Renee&#39; tell me I <br/>
am really smart, so I guess I do just fine.&quot; (Good girl!)<br/>
