the most well balanced diet of us all.  And he&#39;s the skinniest.<br/>
  I have worried about my son&#39;s weight and health.  I started buying fat free <br/>
cheese and margarine, and skim milk.  I buy Dole frozen fruit juice bars.  <br/>
He&#39;s just starting to try new foods, and I also notices lately he&#39;s growing <br/>
taller.  I think he&#39;ll be ok.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769177167">Last year,  I was diagnosed with PCOS with insulin resistance.  The<br/>
physician says that it is nearly impossible for someone with this to<br/>
lose weight and/or maintain a healthy weight.  He prescribed a<br/>
medication to assist my body in normally utilizing insulin.  My sugar<br/>
cravings at this point are almost always emotional triggers.  The<br/>
occasional other trigger is, I believe,  a real sweets craving that<br/>
needs to be fed.  I go back and forth on whether to &quot;buy&quot; the whole<br/>
thing.  On the one hand,  clearly this has helped my body hormone cycles<br/>
become regular. (Meaning I menstruate regularly,  and (doc says) ovulate<br/>
regularly.)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand,  he and a previous OB insist that I was infertile<br/>
until I started taking this meds. Hard to explain four young people that<br/>
I carried to term,  without the aid of fertility meds, etc.  Course,  dh<br/>
thinks he is something else to have fathered 4 children with ma and my<br/>
&#39;condition&#39;!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580983305">Hi Mary J;<br/>
I just wanted to mention, after reading your post re:eating and diabetics,<br/>
that foods high in carbohydrates (pretzels!), turn into sugar after you eat<br/>
them. So, someone who craves alot of carbs can very much have blood sugar<br/>
issues. My family is full of diabetics (my sister is a type 2), and it&#39;s<br/>
something I work on alot, watching carb intakes. My middle child, skinny as<br/>
a rail, has horrible mood swings if I don&#39;t watch the carbs for her. Just<br/>
wanted to mention...<br/>
