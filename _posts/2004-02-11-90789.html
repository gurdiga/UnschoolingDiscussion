(Maybe if I can round up a few more North Floridians, we can plan an outing to the theater.)  I know my kids love to go to that one.  It&#39;s so fancy in there.  Yet it&#39;s inviting.  Not like &quot;too fancy to get comfy&quot;.  <br/>

         Yes!! What a hoot!  My folks gace me the tickets for Christmas and the <br/>
  whole family drove over from Gainesville for the day. It was the fanciest <br/>
  theatre I had seen and the first film I ever saw with an intermission. What an <br/>
  experience. <br/>
<br/>
         So you&#39;re living in Jax, now? I&#39;m a couple of hours to your west, in <br/>
  the currently-crowded-with-legislators city. :)  JJ<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730396004">Yep!  Fort Clinch rocks.  We got on a fairly regular basis just to do little hikes or walk out on the pier on a nice day.  <br/>
<br/>
Fort Clinch is so many different things.  History, science, marine biology.<br/>
<br/>
We were out walking the pier about 2 months ago and this guy had what looked like a mini hammerhead, except the head didn&#39;t look quite right.  It was then that I learned of the &quot;Bonnet Head Shark&quot;...The kids thought it was pretty amazing.<br/>
