better for it when we see other points of view?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  I guess I find your example a little unfathomable, even in fun. <br/>
Perhaps I&#39;m just extra knee-jerky today. But wouldn&#39;t the Pope be the party to do <br/>
introductions, being the Vatican is his home, and unless Holly already knew <br/>
the Pope, shouldn&#39;t he introduce himself to both Holly and Gudrun? In which case <br/>
if Holly and the Pope were acquaintances, shouldn&#39;t Holly introduce the dog <br/>
to the Pope? Maybe it&#39;s the idea of &quot;rank&quot; that also bothers me, in real life <br/>
as opposed to play. <br/>
<br/>
Years ago when I still worked, I used to talk to both our company CEO and CIO <br/>
all the time in a personable manner and even joked around with them on <br/>
occasion. Once my immediate manager, upon hearing me tease the CIO about his running <br/>
ability in the company softball game, had a conniption fit as soon as he <br/>
walked out. Mind you, I was not offensive and he in fact laughed at my remarks and <br/>
announced to the department that a conversation with Rhonda Hill was always a <br/>
pleasure. You see, my twins were a year younger than his twins and we bonded <br/>
over the whole multiple birth thing early in my career, during my pregnancy in <br/>
fact. However this manager knew nothing of our friendship, but thought she <br/>
should reprimand my inability to see rank. She was a lovely lady, by the name of <br/>
Elaine, and when she told me I should never speak to our CIO in such a <br/>
manner, I couldn&#39;t help but give her a hug. She was shaking. I asked what on earth <br/>
bothered her so much about our conversation and she said the fact that I teased <br/>
him and she never would have expected me to be rude to the likes of our CIO. <br/>
<br/>
My response was something to the effect, &quot;Elaine, he (CIO) makes more $ than <br/>
me, but he is no more human than I am or you are for that matter. I have known <br/>
him for years, but even if I met him last month, I&#39;d still speak my mind for <br/>
if I get hit by a Mack truck, and he gets hit by a Mack truck, we&#39;re both <br/>
gonna be squashed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Little did any of us know that he had come back to ask her for some stats and <br/>
heard the whole conversation. So when I ended with the word &quot;squashed&quot; he <br/>
roared with laughter and said he wished more people in our company would think of <br/>
him as a real person. Elaine looked like she was gonna puke. When he left, I <br/>
hugged her again and told her not to worry so much. A year later the CIO left <br/>
the company to be the CEO of one of our biggest competitors. Guess who he came <br/>
to say goodbye to on his last day? In a department of 80 people, he came to <br/>
say goodbye to me. A person of no company rank, but a fellow human who treated <br/>
him as such. He also said if I should ever decide to leave, to make sure I <br/>
looked him up and he&#39;d make me a job if he had too. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I went off on an &quot;all about me&quot; tangent again, sorry. But is this rank <br/>
thing an everyday issue or more to do with SCA, where I would fully imagine <br/>
it to be of importance?<br/>
