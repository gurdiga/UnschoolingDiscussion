<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753948852">For two days now I have been unable to sign on to the unschooling.com <br/>
 message boards.  I have sent an e-mail to them but had no response, and <br/>
thought that someone here might have some ideas for me.  The message reads:<br/>
<br/>
The username and password combination you supplied is not valid. You may <br/>
receive this message for several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) The username and password you entered are not correct<br/>
<br/>
2) The board administrator or a moderator has denied you permission to <br/>
edit your profile<br/>
<br/>
3) You recently changed your password but did not log out and then back <br/>
in to activate your new password<br/>
<br/>
4) You did not supply your current password, but attempted to log in <br/>
with a password that was stored in a cookie -- you must manually enter <br/>
your password into the box to edit your profile<br/>
<br/>
Please contact Home Education &lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschool@...">unschool@...</a>&gt; if <br/>
this problem persists. &lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschool@...">unschool@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschool@...">unschool@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But none of these apply!  Everything is saved to come up automatically <br/>
when I go to the new mesasge page.  I have changed nothing.<br/>

Right.<br/>
<br/>
I put in how many hours (top option, number, hours), and that&#39;s working okay.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2073643200">Thanks Joyce and Sandra - that worked for me - I was getting paranoid <br/>
about being picked on  - our computer has also had several hissy fits <br/>
over the last few days, doing things for no apparent reason.  Hopefully <br/>
they are all sorted now, with this last problem solved.<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to reading the message boards.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even better than the above ... Someone discovered that if you do &quot;Instant<br/>
Registration&quot; that it will remember who you are, display your old profile<br/>
and all you need do is change the temporary password.<br/>
<br/>
So click on Profile at the bottom of the page, click on Instant<br/>
Registration, then fill in your old user name. It will give you a new<br/>
temporary password. Write that down. Log into your profile, scroll to the<br/>
bottom and change your password to a better one, save it and then all is<br/>
fixed!<br/>
