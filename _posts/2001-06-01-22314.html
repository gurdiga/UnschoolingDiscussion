ABOUT NFAA <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since its inception in 1981, NFAA, based in Miami, FL, has continued<br/>
<br/>
founders Lin and Ted Arison&#39;s mission of identifying exceptionally talented<br/>
<br/>
artists and nurturing their talent through various educational and<br/>
<br/>
professional development initiatives. Through the ARTS 2001 program, over<br/>
<br/>
600 awards were given to teen artists across the U.S. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Over the past 20 years, more than 128,000 aspiring young artists from across<br/>
<br/>
the U.S. have applied to NFAA&#39;s ARTS program. ARTS has awarded about $4<br/>
<br/>
million in cash awards to approximately 8,000 winners, many of whom are<br/>
<br/>
continuing their artistic pursuits to build successful professional careers.<br/>
<br/>
During the past two decades, 400 ARTS winners have been named Presidential<br/>
<br/>
Scholars in the Arts.  ARTS alumni include Grammy-nominated singer/actress<br/>
<br/>
Vanessa Williams, renowned jazz musician Roy Hargrove and National Book<br/>
<br/>
Award nominee Allegra Goodman.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NFAA, through its ARTS program, is also the exclusive nominating body to the<br/>
<br/>
White House Commission on Presidential Scholars, and it is through NFAA&#39;s<br/>
<br/>
nomination that the Commission selects its 20 Presidential Scholars in the<br/>
<br/>
Arts each year.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As part of its 20-year anniversary celebration, NFAA created The Arison<br/>
<br/>
Award, in appreciation of the organization&#39;s founders. Given for the first<br/>
<br/>
time earlier this year to musician, composer Quincy Jones, NFAA will present<br/>
<br/>
the award annually to an individual who has had a significant influence on<br/>
<br/>
the development of young American artists, and who has nurtured the<br/>
<br/>
appreciation for the arts among young people. The award carries a $10,000<br/>
<br/>
donation to the recipient&#39;s arts organization or charity of choice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Arts Recognition and Talent Search(r) (ARTS) is a program of the National<br/>
<br/>
Foundation for Advancement in the Arts (NFAA). NFAA&#39;s mission is to identify<br/>
<br/>
emerging artists and assist them at critical junctures in their educational<br/>
<br/>
and professional development, and to raise the appreciation for, and support<br/>
<br/>
of, the arts in American society. The ARTS program is sponsored, in part, by<br/>
<br/>
Ashland Inc., AT&T, Bank of America, Carnival Cruise Lines, The Coca-Cola<br/>
<br/>
Foundation, International Association of Jazz Educators, Music for Youth<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416602957">My middle child attended the NFAA Arts week in Miami a few years ago, and it <br/>
was great. They did pay for airfare, hotel, food, gave her a nice little <br/>
scholarship to take to college (I think it was $2000) and the kids got to <br/>
participate in great workshops in their arts fields and in others. It&#39;s <br/>
pretty stiff competition to get in but well worth trying for.<br/>
