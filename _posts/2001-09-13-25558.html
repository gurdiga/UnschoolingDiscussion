&gt; As far as they are concerned they are a homeschool<br/>
&gt; family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are a homeschool family, as much as any other family in California.<br/>
<br/>
There is no legal homeschooling in California. If you file the R4, you are<br/>
legally operating a private school, not legally homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you and your family found a charter with requirements you&#39;re<br/>
comfortable with.<br/>
