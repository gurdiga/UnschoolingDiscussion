<div id="ygrps-yiv-4160212">I just want to remind everyone that the Early Bird Deadline for the <br/>
upcoming Live and Learn Unschooling Conference is rapidly approaching!<br/>
<br/>
  End of this month: June 30, 2006 <br/>

  If you&#39;re looking to host a funshop, I&#39;d like to know that before the <br/>
end of this month as well. I&#39;d need to approve the funshop first, but <br/>
then I&#39;ll need a photo of you, a 4-5 line bio, a title & description of <br/>
your funshop.<br/>
<br/>
 Scholarships need to be requested before the end of this month too.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m expecting to be *very* busy these next 4 weeks! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>
