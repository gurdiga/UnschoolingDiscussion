<div id="ygrps-yiv-743277515">I just found this ad on our local craigslist. (Hoping you all can see it,<br/>

A mom is selling a ton of Thomas the Train stuff and most of it is new in<br/>
the packaging. I was wondering why she had so much NIP stuff then I read her<br/>
intro: <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;This is a big lot of Thomas the train stuff I had bought for my Son. I<br/>
would let him open one as a &quot;bribe&quot; to try to get him doing his chores, good<br/>
at his school work, etc. The problem was since each one cost so much he had<br/>
a hard time earning them. Now we have decided since he is almost 12 that we<br/>
will cut our losses and move onto something that we would all enjoy.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Just reading this ad I&#39;m so sad for the kid, so many toys bought for him,<br/>
but he was never allowed to enjoy them!<br/>

Oh Kim, that&#39;s so very sad.  The poor kid - you can just imagine  how he <br/>
must have felt trying to earn his way towards those prizes.  It  makes me <br/>
appreciate our own Christmas even more, and the joys of watching Jess&#39;s  face as <br/>
she opens surprise presents, knowing they&#39;re given out of  love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157367025">Yuck, yuck and triple yuck!  Sharing, love and trust as a basis for family<br/>
life seems to have eluded her.  I really hope she isn&#39;t repeating this<br/>
horror with new &quot;bribes&quot;, because the life she wants with her son is<br/>
probably not one of deception, bribery, and manipulation.  Unless she is<br/>
hoping to raise a player who will dole out strings of pearls to her she hits<br/>
old age, hard earned wealth from the mindgames he plays with his<br/>
lovers/romantic partners.<br/>

 <br/>
Unfortunately the loss is something she probably won&#39;t consider and it isn&#39;t monetary, and it will only deepen and widen as her 12 yr old boy enters into teen years.  I&#39;ve seen it over and over and over with people we know that have been raised in this way.  For some kids, the reward was never worth their dignity and self worth.  One day there may be no way to bribe a kid who has a little bit of dignity and self worth and from that point onward it will be a struggle of wills.  Who lost here?  I&#39;d say they all did.  It sure doesn&#39;t breed love and happiness.<br/>
