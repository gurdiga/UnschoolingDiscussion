THEN, I would wave another wand to have mini-conferences show up all over  <br/>
the US in the spring, as a kind of shot in the arm half-way through the  <br/>
year. <br/>
Pam Genant has pulled together a min-conference in Nov in NC----the  kind I&#39;m <br/>
Being the recovering controller that I am, and not wanting to wait until 2054 <br/>
to have a conference here, I&#39;m planning a one day mini-conf in the DC area <br/>
for the late spring. Probably in Silver Spring, maybe closer to my home in WV. <br/>
It&#39;s a beautiful crunchy area here.<br/>

Hi Liz - I&#39;m right in your local area.  I just sent you a message<br/>
off-list about meeting up if you&#39;d like and the VHEA Conference that was<br/>
in the Science Museum of Virginia in Richmond.  It&#39;s not an unschooling<br/>
conference per se, but I consider it to be unschooler-friendly.  VHEA is<br/>
an inclusive group that focuses strictly on homeschooling issues and is<br/>
not tied to any religious or political philosophy.  www.vhea.org<br/>
