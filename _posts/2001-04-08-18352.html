<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862935016">First, thank you to all who responded to my post about kidnapping.  I <br/>
still have a lot of posts to read, but I just wanted to say thank <br/>
you. I&#39;m not so terrified now.  I guess in a way, it was the way I <br/>
was raised, and I&#39;m glad I haven&#39;t raised my kids with the same fears.<br/>
<br/>
My problem now, is about lying.  4yo ds lies to us a lot.  I don&#39;t <br/>
understand why.  I lied all the time as a kid to try to keep from <br/>
getting in trouble.  But since he never gets in trouble about <br/>
anything, and we rarely show disappointment - then only briefly (like <br/>
when he hits his sister), and he seems to be doing well.  But still, <br/>
he lies to us, and then we do show disappointment.  I just don&#39;t know <br/>
what to do.  We have talked with him about it.  DH told him that the <br/>
only time he will ever get in trouble is when he lies.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
about that, but he seems to understand.  For the moment anyway.  Next <br/>
thing we know, he&#39;s lying about something else.  Suggestions?  <br/>

I read somewhere that it was a natural thing for children around that <br/>
age to do, maybe mixing up real and not real, not sure abut that <br/>
myself...  Maybe the threat being &#39;out there&#39; is making him see how <br/>
far he can get before he&#39;s &#39;in trouble&#39; and what being &#39;in trouble&#39; <br/>
means, if it hasn&#39;t been specifically spelled out what being &#39;in <br/>
trouble&#39; will mean to him.  I had a bit of this with dd1, she&#39;s 5, it <br/>
seems to have stopped though...  I told her that if I didn&#39;t know if <br/>
what she was saying was &#39;right&#39; or not, I wouldn&#39;t be able to trust <br/>
what she was saying, and it was important for me to be able to <br/>
trust her.  Maybe you could turn it around to something he could <br/>
relate to?  Not sure what though...<br/>
<br/>
Tricky one, this.<br/>

He might not be old enough to understand the concept well.  And boys are <br/>
sometimes slower than girls to become analytical and philosophical.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead of saying &quot;You&#39;re lying&quot; (which might cut of conversation and stun <br/>
him into defensiveness) you might say &quot;Are you sure?&quot; or &quot;Is that how you <br/>
wish it had happened?&quot; or something a little easier to recover from.  <br/>
<br/>
Being a liar is a bad thing--people won&#39;t trust him, other kids won&#39;t want to <br/>
play with him--but telling him all that when he might not really know what&#39;s <br/>
going on yet could scar him longterm.<br/>
<br/>
If you get chances, tell stories of lies people told that they didn&#39;t need to <br/>
tell, and what the result was.  Casually, not like &quot;Here is your Instructive <br/>
Tale for today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids all know &quot;The Boy who Cried Wolf,&quot; and they have known since they <br/>
were little what it means, and it&#39;s not just about lying.  The kid in that <br/>
story had a good reason to cry wolf--he was really lonely, being sent to work <br/>
all by himself.  There could have been other solutions.<br/>
<br/>
But if a kid complains too much about small hurts, it will be hard for <br/>
parents to get excited about a large hurt.  If someone claims &quot;no money&quot; and <br/>
is found to have some, &quot;no money&quot; will cease to mean anything.  (My husband <br/>
earned that one from saying &quot;we&#39;re broke&quot; when we weren&#39;t, and now I don&#39;t <br/>
believe him anymore about that--but we discussed it and he realizes he &quot;cried <br/>
wolf,&quot; and so he is more specific now.)<br/>
<br/>
These things are all too much for a four year old.  Maybe you can figure out <br/>
a way to correct the stories you DO know in a gentle way so he sees what <br/>
kinds of exaggerations or denials he&#39;s making.   <br/>
<br/>
Please try to remember to give him a way out, a way to escape and re-group <br/>
and tell the story a different way.  And the second way might not be &quot;the <br/>
truth&quot; either at first, but with practice and real reasons (not &quot;consequeces&quot; <br/>
made up), and with understanding and sympathy, I bet he&#39;ll come around within <br/>
a couple of years.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Melanie,<br/>
Some wise person once told me that kids this age can&#39;t distinguish lying<br/>
from telling the truth very easily. Often what they are telling us is *what<br/>
they wish was true* and they tell it as if it was the truth. I&#39;ve really<br/>
noticed this with my 4 y.o. Mostly, I try to avoid situations that would<br/>
make a lie inevitable. If I come into a room with my kids and my youngest is<br/>
crying, I don&#39;t turn to my son and say &quot;What happened?&quot; Most likely the<br/>
answer will be something like &quot;She bumped her head on the wall&quot; (even though<br/>
she&#39;s sitting in the middle of the room). What I do is just come into the<br/>
room and say &quot;Asa is very hurt, do you need kisses Asa?&quot; and I&#39;ll pick her<br/>
up and comfort her. At some point, my DS will often then either say &quot;Sorry<br/>
Asa&quot; (so apparently he caused the tears) or he&#39;ll say &quot;I got really mad at<br/>
her&quot; and I can help him process that emotion and talk about alternative<br/>
actions.<br/>
When something has happened (like for instance the toilet was overflowing)<br/>
and I asked my DS what happened and he told me &quot;Nothing&quot;, I&#39;ve just<br/>
emphasized to him that I need to know truly  what the problem is in order to<br/>
fix it (in that case, turns out he flushed his underwear down the toilet).<br/>
Eventually, they will learn to tell the truth so that we can mutually solve<br/>
the problem. At this age, it&#39;s probably a hard thing for them to do. Kids<br/>
are very smart about what will and will not frustrate their parents,<br/>
regardless of whether we actively &quot;show disappointment&quot; or not. So often<br/>
they wish that the problem didn&#39;t happen or that they didn&#39;t cause it,<br/>
because they know that it IS a problem. And this is what they say - their<br/>
wish. Keeping that in mind makes it a lot easier to deal with effectively,<br/>
IMHO :-)<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Sandra.  I also try to phrase my questions so they aren&#39;t<br/>
given the opportunity to lie, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
When my dd was 3 (mind you, she had the verbal and comprehension skills<br/>
of a 5 or 6 year old) we had a talk about honesty and I told her I would<br/>
never punish her for lying because no one, not even I, could MAKE her be<br/>
honest.  I told her it was up to her if she wanted me and others to<br/>
believe her when she told us something.  It was about WHO she wanted to<br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
I may have needed to go through the message with her once or twice again<br/>
but I doubt that she has lied to me more than twice since that time.  She<br/>
has waited to tell me something if she thought I was in a less than<br/>
&quot;optimal&quot; mood but she has always told me.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most important thing is to believe them unless you are given<br/>
proof otherwise.  They can always come clean about a lie but you can&#39;t<br/>
ever take back an accusation.  Knowing that you see them as trustworthy<br/>
(along with modeling honesty) may be their biggest motivation to be that<br/>
way.<br/>

<br/>
True, and scary.<br/>
<br/>
Once when Kirby was very young (7?) he stole a $20 bill from a neighbor.  He <br/>
could have hidden it, or spent it subtly, but he brought it in, showed it to <br/>
me and said &quot;Look what I found.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Where?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the road.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But when he was telling the story, he didn&#39;t act or sound like he would have <br/>
if he had found twenty dollars in the road.  He sounded calm, but kind of <br/>
stunned, like he had surprised himself disturbingly.  (Hard to describe it--I <br/>
could say it the way he said it, but for one thing--he didn&#39;t look at me, he <br/>
kept looking at the bill when he was telling me; it just was wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
I could have said &quot;Why are you acting so weird?&quot; but I didn&#39;t.  And I wasn&#39;t <br/>
sure.  I said sometimes people do lose money, and my sister finds money all <br/>
the time, always has.  I told him if nobody claimed it in a day or two he <br/>
could keep it.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbor called after a few hours and I said yes, Kirby did have a $20 <br/>
bill.  One had disappeared from her dresser.  So I talked to Kirby about it <br/>
really gently, and he admitted he had picked it up and hadn&#39;t known how to <br/>
put it back, or what to do.  So we went back over, and she was very cool <br/>
about it, and so was Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
That might have been the end of it, but when he was nine and had only been at <br/>
his dojo for a few months, the sensei called me and said some money was <br/>
missing from the dressing and did I think possibly Kirby had taken it.  I <br/>
said I would love to say &quot;no,&quot; but there was this one prior incident.<br/>
<br/>
(And that all really taught Kirby the power of one serious failure to affect <br/>
people&#39;s future trust.)<br/>
<br/>
But the teacher asked me not to mention it to Kirby, that they would look <br/>
further and that he would ask him himself, and that if it turned out Kirby <br/>
did have it, they wouldn&#39;t put him out of the school or anything at all, but <br/>
would speak with him about honor and all that.  That was fine with me.  I <br/>
felt good having been honest and saying &quot;maybe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I waited a rough whole day, kind of worried.  And I had looked subtly in <br/>
Kirby&#39;s stuff and there was no money, and he acted absolutely calmly normal.<br/>
<br/>
The next day the teacher called and said the money had been found!!<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Kirby about it in a really neutral way, and he was relieved not <br/>
to have been in a position to have to defend himself, but he did understand <br/>
why I would say &quot;maybe.&quot;  It was great.<br/>
<br/>
When I give my kids lunch money they bring back the change.  They&#39;re very <br/>
sweet about money, and because we trust them, we&#39;re more generous with it.  <br/>
If I don&#39;t have change, I can give Marty a $20 and tell him what he can use <br/>
and what he can&#39;t, and I have always gotten change (and more than I expected, <br/>
often).<br/>

<br/>
When he&#39;s cutting, can you just hand him something he CAN cut up (and so <br/>
forth)?  He might discover that he&#39;s wanting to be destructive, and not know <br/>
why.  Or maybe he was just dying to cut something up.  Pillows from garage <br/>

&lt;&lt;    *Well, last night, FE, I caught him cutting up the couch.  <br/>
 Cutting big chunks out of the fabric.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have read some good advice about the lying and especially agree with<br/>
the idea that little children lie because they wish it to be true.  <br/>
I wanted to give you a suggestion about cutting.  We went through this<br/>
phase (cut in almost in half a handmade wallhanging, cut up my pajama<br/>
sleeve...).  A friend of mine suggested this. Give him his very own cutting<br/>
box.  Put all kinds of things in it from fabric to sponges, old jeans, carpet,<br/>
chunk of glycerin soap, cardboard, old magazines.  He is 6 now and just<br/>
pulled it out the other day when he felt like cutting up some stuff.  It gave<br/>
him control and direction to have this cutting box.  You can suggest when<br/>
he looks frustrated if he would like to go get his cutting box.  Remind him<br/>
that he it is there and available.  About a year and a half after he cut<br/>
my pajama top, I was  wearing it (it was still usable, just not pretty lol)<br/>
and he said to me in the most sincere voice, mom I am really sorry I cut<br/>
up your pajamas.  I know he didn&#39;t mean to do it.  My boy just has needs<br/>
to do, try, experience or know that are stronger than his need to please<br/>
me.  He has even told me that he doesn&#39;t know why he does the things<br/>
he does (hitting sibling or throwing somehting or breaking something)<br/>
and I believe him.  He gets frustrated and lashes out without thinking.  I<br/>
do the same thing and I am 30 years older than him and am STILL <br/>
working on this trait!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144333805">&lt;&lt;My eldest was about 5-6yrs (long time ago - cant remeber exact age)<br/>
when he would lie.  I would be stood next to him and he would do <br/>
something, lets say pull the cats tail, I would say &quot;dont pull the <br/>
cats tail&quot; and he would look me in the eye and say &quot;I didn&#39;t&quot;!!  He <br/>
was so convincing that he almost had me believing him.......This son <br/>
is the most honest truthfull person I know.<br/>

LOL, this sounds like my dd at age 3, she was so convincing.  She told me<br/>
several years later about some lies she told me and I had no idea.  She<br/>
would rather eat a slug than lie to me now.<br/>

What a great idea!  I read stuff like this and have a real V-8 moment. <br/>
My little guy LOVES to cut and tries so hard to stick with the &quot;legal&quot;<br/>
paper.  He&#39;s gonna think he&#39;s landed in heaven!<br/>

<br/>
Maybe wishful lying could be minimized in this age group by saying &quot;Next<br/>
time, remember don&#39;t pull the cat&#39;s tail.  It hurts the cat.&quot;  That gives<br/>
the child the chance to say &quot;I won&#39;t&quot; instead of &quot;I didn&#39;t&quot;.<br/>

Thanks for all the input.  It really helps me understand my behavior <br/>
growing up.  And that makes it easier to deal with my kids when they <br/>
act the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
