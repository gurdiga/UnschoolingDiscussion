<div><font face="Arial" size="2">HI All!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I just thought it would be a 
good idea to do some sort of intro, which we may have already done. I get kinda 
confused on who&#39;s who.&nbsp; And since we have so many new people everyday, it 
would be nice to know more about them.&nbsp; So I&#39;ve listed a few categories, 
and filled my answers in myself, so we can all get to know each other 
better.&nbsp; This would be very helpful to me, to get to know people 
better.&nbsp; Thanks.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Why do you un/home school?&nbsp; I un/homeschool 
because I want the best&nbsp; for my child. I believe he is a unique, and 
wonderful individual who has the right to learn at his own pace, and cultivate 
the skills that are inherent in him naturally.&nbsp; So that when he grows up he 
may choose a labour of love, that best suits him, and that he will consider to 
be his life work, rather than serve his community in a position that does not 
encourage his spirit to be whole.&nbsp; The public school system does not offer 
the means to achieve this goal.&nbsp; His emotional, spiritual, mental, and 
educational health depends on his freedom to choose his own path of learning, 
and I am here to provide him with the resources to cultivate his dreams, so he 
can make them come true(we can go on forever with this one , eh&#39;?)</font></div>

interested, so for his birthday next month , I&#39;ve just arranged to have a real 
magician come, doves, wands, and all...WHAT fun! Pajama Sam games, and carrying 
little gadgets in his pockets for saving the day.&nbsp; (his favorite clothes 
are the ones with many pockets)</font></div>

Pacific Northwest, a beautiful green, lush area.</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218802826">Why do you un/home school? Because I spent years doing curriculum with my<br/>
kids and that&#39;s just not how they learned.  I finally realized that most of<br/>
what they were learning was when pursuing their own interests but that I<br/>
wasn&#39;t leaving much time for their own interests.  What I was teaching<br/>
wasn&#39;t sticking so why waste my time?<br/>
<br/>
How many children do you have, how old, and names?  4 kids: Kate:almost 14,<br/>
Lisa:11, Karl:9 and Ben:4<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your child/ren&#39;s most recent interest(s)?  Hmm, the boys build with<br/>
legos, blocks, K-nex, and some other things I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re<br/>
called.  We have recently discussed insects and book making.  Kate wants to<br/>
learn to make a web page and Lisa is busy with her volunteer work at the<br/>
library.  Kate also reads at least a book a day.  We are all currently<br/>
re-reading (aloud) the Little House books.<br/>
<br/>
WHat area does your family live in?  The Midwest<br/>
<br/>
Are you satisfied with the homeschooling laws in your state?  Yes. No<br/>
restrictions at all.<br/>
<br/>
DO you have any pets?  no<br/>
<br/>
ANy thing else you&#39;d like to add: We are at the beginning of our unschooling<br/>
journey but are so much happier.  The kids are learning more and we have<br/>
time now for more reading aloud and going to the many museums and zoos and<br/>
such in our area. We live in the suburbs and I love it, we are not into<br/>
natural eating (though we do eat fairly healthy), we are learing to<br/>
incorporate the many great TV shows on cable into our learning, and though I<br/>
love my kids dearly and they are well adjusted, we do not do what you would<br/>
call attachment parenting. Just thought I would add some diversity to the<br/>
list! LOL  (as though this group isn&#39;t diverse!, I just seem to be in the<br/>
minority with these things, but that&#39;s OK by me.  I love the wisdom I&#39;ve<br/>
seen here).<br/>
