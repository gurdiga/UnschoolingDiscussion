&lt;&lt; then you don&#39;t get any time alone <br/>
<br/>
again til 10 pm, when you can take a bath and read. That is a long day! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i agree that that particular day of carol&#39;s was long, too long for me!  but <br/>
from her next post i got the feeling that they arent all that way.  probably <br/>
working, having a child in school and a two yr old are absolutely as <br/>
draining-- esp the running around -- if not more so than being home with <br/>
several ages all day.  just my opinion.  we are all so different in our <br/>
needs.  to answer your question, this is definitely why i choose the regular <br/>
bedtimes with our four kids.  i need the break.  it keeps me sane, and my <br/>
marital relationship in shape.  as we have added more children to our fam, i <br/>
have chosen to slow our daytime &quot;going&quot; pace quite a bit, so that there is a <br/>
margin...  it sounds like you may have the impression that hmschlrs are <br/>
martyrs to their own needs, but it probably more true that we are just like <br/>
everyone else, trying to do the balancing act of giving vs. conserving....  <br/>
my husband is very supportive and i plan things for myself, going to meet a <br/>
friend for dinner, or to our support groups mom&#39;s nite, or to go get a <br/>
haircut (alone!) etc.  knowing your needs is important...<br/>
