<div id="ygrps-yiv-36938562">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
This question is not about my own kids, but about the piano studio I <br/>
run in my home. I&#39;m thinking of implementing something new this <br/>
fall, and while it appeals to me, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s at odds with <br/>
what I think about learning and rewards.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking of having a spreadsheet for each piano <br/>
student with a little points sheet. At each lesson, they would get, <br/>
say, a point for remembering to bring all their books, a point for <br/>
completing any written assignments given, etc. [I would not give <br/>
them points for how much/long/often they practiced, for various <br/>
reasons.]<br/>
<br/>
They could them get extra points at any time, if they wanted, for <br/>
things like memorizing a piece, playing an informal &quot;concert&quot; for <br/>
family or friends, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Then, I would buy various little candies, keychains, various dollar <br/>
store toys, and maybe once a month have &quot;open store&quot; when they could <br/>
purchase various things with their points earned. Maybe have the <br/>
option, especially for older kids, that they could save a lot of <br/>
their points and &quot;buy&quot; a Target gift card or something.<br/>
<br/>
The reason this appeals to me is that I could picture my students <br/>
liking it: I&#39;m hoping it would give a more &quot;fun&quot; and special feel to <br/>
the whole studio and coming over for lessons. I also could see some <br/>
of the kids liking a tangible way of keeping track of their <br/>
progress, and taking advantage of doing some of the extra things, <br/>
like memorizing pieces.<br/>
<br/>
But I am hesitant ... I remember reading a book called &quot;Punished by <br/>
Rewards.&quot; Would something like this ruin natural learning or <br/>
enthusiasm? Do you think your own kids would like or benefit from <br/>
something like that? Is it &quot;too schoolish&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your opinions,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do several children come together and/or know eachother well?  I think if the <br/>
kids were in groups it may strike up unnecessary competition between them.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d do in this situation because I understand the desire to <br/>
make the lessons fun and exciting but I also see that it could have negative <br/>
side effects.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read that book you mentioned but I do know that on several <br/>
occasions in my son&#39;s K class last year, there were reward situations that didn&#39;t <br/>
quite work out.  Example:  teacher had a basket with goodies for the end of the <br/>
week and many kids never got anything because their behavior was never &quot;good <br/>
enough&quot;.  The children would line up outside waiting for their transportation <br/>
and several would have treats and many wouldn&#39;t.  There would be bickering among <br/>
the kids and name calling, &quot;you&#39;re a bad kid so you don&#39;t get any&quot; or &quot;Ms. So&<br/>
So doesn&#39;t like you.&quot;  Once a kid took another kids&#39; treat and ate it.  Not a <br/>
cool thing to observe.  And better yet, parent&#39;s were asked to help stock <br/>
these treats and I remember one Mom brought those push pop things and her kid <br/>
never got any and he was in hysterics one day because he &quot;couldn&#39;t even have his <br/>
own Mommy&#39;s treats.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It probably depends on the kids, really.<br/>
<br/>
How about just a constant thing after each lesson?  Or once a week?  Like a <br/>
movie and popcorn after the week is through?  Maybe they could each bring games <br/>
to play one day a week?  I don&#39;t know your availability or desire to have a <br/>
group thing in your home or if they&#39;d even want to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not a big fan of rewards systems but I guess they work in some <br/>
situations.  Like my old preschool class, we were encouraged to give stuff for good <br/>
behavior but I couldn&#39;t stand to leave kids out so I gave everybody something and <br/>
the kids who did &quot;really well&quot; got two.  I guess if they all understand that <br/>
they may not get the rewards and they are OK with it, then it would work.  If <br/>
you have the time and desire to help set personal goals for each kid so that <br/>
they are achieving their own things, that could work.  Then it doesn&#39;t matter <br/>
that the other kids always do well and they may not, it becomes all about <br/>
themselves and what they want to accomplish and not competing with eachother.<br/>

Would any of those various reasons apply to the other things?<br/>
 <br/>
If you reduce it to principles does that help you answer your  question?<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Piano lessons aren&#39;t such an unschooling thing in any case.  I would  have, <br/>
personally, as a kid, gotten totally into earning points.  I would&#39;ve  done any <br/>
crazy thing to get little toys.  But I was school-trained.  &lt;g&gt;  It was a <br/>
game I liked.<br/>
 <br/>
I think if a kid&#39;s going to take any formal class or lessons, they&#39;ve  signed <br/>
up for the oddities and particularities of that thing.<br/>

This is exactly the kind of thing that would likely eliminate your school<br/>
from my list of possibles if Jayn wanted to do piano. <br/>
<br/>
However we are Unschoolers and do not use extrinsic motivations - for all<br/>
the reasons Alfie Kohn talks about. <br/>
<br/>
What do your current students think about this proposal?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891599517">When I was a kid I took piano lessons and the teacher gave out full-sized<br/>
candy bars after each lesson, irregardless of how you did.  I loved piano<br/>
lessons and I loved the candy bars because we didn&#39;t get them often.  My<br/>
sister however, confessed as an adult, that she only took piano lessons for<br/>
the candy bar and that my parents could have saved $6 a week by buying her a<br/>
candy bar.  LOL!  Not sure if this helps any but I thought I&#39;d share it<br/>
since your question reminded me of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally think that rewards take away from the intrinsic value of the<br/>
lessons if the lessons are something the children have chosen.  But often<br/>
kids are forced to take piano lesson because they are good for them.  If you<br/>
have students like that, the reward system might make piano lessons a nicer<br/>
place to be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1617121298">The only time I really liked piano lessons, was when I really liked the  <br/>
music I was given.  We had a sort of flamboyant teacher that gave us a lot  of <br/>
show-type tunes, much that I hated or had never heard.  <br/>
 <br/>
But I remember one time a friend played a very difficult song that I loved,  <br/>
and I asked my teacher if I could learn that one.  He got me the music, and  <br/>
because I liked it I tried very hard.  It was way beyond my ability at the  <br/>
time, but I remember spending hours and hours that week practicing  it.  <br/>
 <br/>
I sort of learned it, but not perfectly, and my teacher closed the book on  <br/>
it and said &quot;It&#39;s too hard for you&quot; and gave me something simple.  I felt  so <br/>
crushed, and hated piano lessons after that.  It probably wasn&#39;t even 3  months <br/>
later I talked my mom into letting me quit.  <br/>
 <br/>
I like the idea of the candy bar :o)  I might have kept going with  that, but <br/>
I think a more encouraging, challenging teacher would have been the  ticket.  <br/>

I don&#39;t like reward systems like that at all.  I don&#39;t even like them at the dentist.  You know, the &quot;if you&#39;re good, you get a prize after I clean your teeth&quot;.  If my kids go to the dentist, they go because they want to have their teeth cleaned, not because they want a prize.  If they want a cheap prize or cheap candy, I&#39;ll just buy them for them.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gosh, that is awful! But I&#39;m not surprised. Once I did a 6-week job <br/>
for an elementary music teacher on maternity leave. She had a system <br/>
of giving each class a &quot;ribbon&quot; at the end of each class, their <br/>
behavior would determine the color. When I was hired, the principal <br/>
raved to me about this ribbon system, and I was expected to continue <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
I remember one class in particular where their regular classroom <br/>
teacher would assign extra homework if they came back with any less <br/>
than the &quot;best color ribbon.&quot; This class was always so stressed and <br/>
angry at each other, looking to see who would &quot;blow it&quot; for the <br/>
whole class. I believe I finally got smart and picked up the ribbon <br/>
when class began and said, &quot;Here it is. You&#39;re getting it. It&#39;s <br/>
done. Now let&#39;s have class.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I hated about it (other than how all it seemed to <br/>
do was upset the kids) was that it was so vague. What does it mean <br/>
to say, &quot;You were good today&quot; or &quot;Mm, you weren&#39;t so good today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
********************************************************************<br/>
More thoughts about my idea for piano ....<br/>
<br/>
It would not be in a group setting. It would *not* be the kind of <br/>
thing like, &quot;Johnny, you can pick a prize today, but Suzy, you <br/>
can&#39;t.&quot; The points or prizes would not be announced or posted <br/>
anywhere, although I guess some kids could choose to discuss it if <br/>
they wanted to on their own time, but that&#39;s their choice and I <br/>
could actually picture some of them getting a kick out of that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think the only reason I would even consider something like <br/>
this is because it&#39;s so concrete. Bring your book, get a point. <br/>
Choose to memorize a piece, get a point. Or not. It&#39;s not a matter <br/>
of trying to please me, or me saying, &quot;Johnny plays better than <br/>
Suzy.&quot;  I remember my piano teacher when I was a kid would actually <br/>
grade each lesson, and I hated that, and I would hate doing it as a <br/>
teacher. How do I even decide something like that?<br/>
<br/>
As far as me not wanting to give points about practice time ... I <br/>
don&#39;t want to encourage more &quot;minutes&quot; spent at the piano, because I <br/>
think a lot of times kids (like me) will check the clock a hundred <br/>
times, hoping they&#39;re &quot;almost done&quot; and deliberately wasting time <br/>
and not even enjoying it or really even doing anything. I don&#39;t want <br/>
to encourage time on the bench; if fact, I want to move them as far <br/>
away as possible from being concerned about &quot;time.&quot; In fact, I hope <br/>
to make them more efficient so they can do what they want in *less* <br/>
time, not more.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback. Still mulling this one over ...<br/>

<br/>
Fun story, and it made me think.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the desire to have students enthusiastic about showing up <br/>
for lessons, but in a perfect world, in which one had a choice of <br/>
available students, wouldn&#39;t the most gratifying students be the ones <br/>
that were enthusiastic about playing the piano, and came every week for <br/>
that reason?<br/>
<br/>
**If my kids go to the dentist, they go because they want to have their <br/>

<br/>
I my dentist gives a small toy, (not candy), to every child patient.  I <br/>
think the idea is to have the visit end on a positive note, so the kid <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel wildly negative about coming the next time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106284891">Oh, Jenny - I would not go down that path, no matter<br/>
what appeal it may hold.  I started piano when I was 5<br/>
(that was a VERY long time ago) and loved it until I<br/>
got a teacher who my mother adored (which meant my<br/>
opinion was irrelevant).  Her use of such &#39;systems&#39; of<br/>
grading/scoring/etc. as well as her pedagogical<br/>
approach absolutely killed my natural enthusiasm and<br/>
ability.  When I was 28, I almost got some of it back,<br/>
thanks to a professor with an amazing ability to reach<br/>
me.  I could see it on the horizon but could never get<br/>
closer and it makes me sad.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot know what other pressures are pushing your<br/>
students.  I was shy, easily embarassed and did not<br/>
seek attention but when I played, I floated in the<br/>
clouds and could forget the unpleasantness of our<br/>
household.  Then this teacher came with her &#39;rewards&#39;<br/>
and &#39;scoring&#39; which my mother embraced<br/>
enthusiastically and suddenly piano became one more<br/>
stick with which I could get beaten.<br/>
<br/>
I taught for a year in a public school as an<br/>
instrumental music teacher.  I was hired on a Friday<br/>
and school started the following Monday.  I was<br/>
instructed to give the students stickers, candy, gum,<br/>
pencils, etc.  I was shocked and appalled.  The older<br/>
kids resented that I did not follow that path at first<br/>
but they started to enjoy playing together rather than<br/>
as competition.  My beginners never knew the<br/>
difference and were the most amazingly enthusiastic<br/>
bunch who ever made noise in a band room.  We just had<br/>
fun.  My private students felt the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Just love the music, infect them with the joy of it<br/>
and let the details go.  Some of the best fun and most<br/>
excitement my students and I had was when we were<br/>
&#39;unprepared.&#39;  Then it was an adventure we could<br/>
share!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649086068">Oh definitely.  I think it was just a waste of money.  She never really<br/>
liked playing piano all that much and hasn&#39;t played hardly at all since<br/>
stopping lessons as a kid.  I, on the other hand, went because I liked it<br/>
and I still play occasionally.  (I just have a keyboard now but I enjoy it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s kinda tuff.  I read all the responses and they all have a point.  I <br/>
guess it will come down to the kids.  Unschooled children may not understand or <br/>
enjoy the rewards because most likely they are there because they want to be and <br/>
will put their all in to it.  Schooled kids may relate to the rewards and <br/>
appreciate them, especially if they are there more for the parents.  I liked the <br/>
idea of letting the kids try out some music they choose.  &quot;Learn the basics <br/>
and we&#39;ll work our hardest on your favorite piece.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I bet all the kids would enjoy treats or prizes.  Maybe if you know in your <br/>
own mind that certain kids need to remember their books or whatever and you <br/>
begin to notice they do it, just say, &quot;Hey, I noticed your bringing all your <br/>
stuff lately,&quot; and just give them something because your proud and that&#39;s it.  No <br/>
reward really, just noticing their efforts and getting on with things.  <br/>
<br/>
Tonight my son was desperately trying to ride his bike and he had no notion <br/>
of rewards or prizes and frankly neither did I but when we came in I was so <br/>
proud and he was pooped and kinda discouraged cuz he&#39;s the type that enjoys <br/>
instant gratification and wants to know how NOW.  Well, I took out some treats and <br/>
got a movie and popped it in and we just enjoyed ourselves.  I asked him if he <br/>
was ready for a new helmet as his is kinda toddler-ish with little animals <br/>
all over it.  He said yeah he&#39;d like a new one and so we&#39;ll go and get it.  Not <br/>
really rewards to him, just my way of saying I&#39;m proud-along with SAYING &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
proud.&quot;<br/>

Some kids might really thrive on the rewards, and some might feel<br/>

sugar that they need to make the parent-prescribed medicine go down.  <br/>
<br/>
And as I mentioned, there are other things you could talk over doing<br/>
with them, too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of them would like a more mentoring relationship, where<br/>
they get to see you play some of your favorite music sometimes, and<br/>
they can learn from that.  As someone mentioned, maybe some of them<br/>
would like to choose different music.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you teach how to play songs by ear, but when I took<br/>
piano, that was where I put my focus -- I can still play &quot;For He&#39;s a<br/>
Jolly Good Fellow&quot; with harmony, but I can barely read the bass line<br/>
on any piece of music.  Some of your kids might enjoy focusing on<br/>
that, or on composing their own simple pieces.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you already do all of this, or maybe none of this fits with the<br/>
expectations that you currently have set for &quot;piano lessons.&quot;  But<br/>
since you came to an unschooling list with the question, my answer is<br/>
to focus on each individual and try to help them with their own goals<br/>
-- to use the &quot;relationship-based&quot; approach that works so well in<br/>
unschooling.  <br/>

This was pretty much why I asked what the current students thought about the<br/>
idea. I pretty much envisioned them as not being Unschoolers. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that they can&#39;t be treated with same respect and asked for their<br/>
preferences, however rarely that might happen in other schooling situations<br/>
for many of them.<br/>

Some  kids might really thrive on the rewards, and some might feel<br/>

point (that would have  been me, and it would be my son, too).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that&#39;s true.  Some kids might focus all their attention on the  thing <br/>
they would have gotten if they had remembered to do X, but are NOT getting  <br/>
because they forgot to do X, and how much they WISHED they had done X and gotten  <br/>
the thing, and there goes half an hour.<br/>
 <br/>
I can only read bass clef with my left hand at a piano.  Anywhere else  in <br/>
the world, I have to translate it in words from treble clef, and that&#39;s not  <br/>
&quot;reading,&quot; that&#39;s as painstaking as any misunderstood mathematical equation, or  <br/>
as sounding out a long word phonetically only to find out it&#39;s a native <br/>
American  word originally written out by the Spaniards.  (Guachupangue and Pojoaque  <br/>
come to mind, as towns on either side of where I grew up.)<br/>
 <br/>
But my left hand can read it if it ignores my brain&#39;s saying &quot;That&#39;s a  C.  <br/>
C!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I wish my piano teacher had done bass-only exercises, because the right  hand <br/>
was zipping along because I did vocal and clarinet and treble cleff was my  <br/>
language.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, I only liked old stuff.  Clementi and Bach were fun.  It  would&#39;ve been <br/>
nice to have had a teacher who could&#39;ve looked at that and said,  &quot;Okay, <br/>
you&#39;d like Telemann, then&quot; but I was dragged through the same Thompson  books as <br/>
everyone else, regardless of my interests or theirs.  I despised  playing the <br/>
late 19th century stuff, the schmlatzy old parlor music.  But  had she told me <br/>
that that&#39;s EXACTLY why most people in the 19th century learned  piano, <br/>
because they didn&#39;t have the means to listen to recorded music at home  yet (but <br/>
would soon), and so it was a great thing to have music at home, and  especially <br/>
music people could sing along to... THAT would&#39;ve made it come to  life.  But <br/>
she didn&#39;t tell me, probably because she didn&#39;t know or care,  because what SHE <br/>
liked was Rachmaninoff and Chopin, both of which gagged me then  and gag me <br/>
now.  Perhaps they&#39;re the olympic sports of the keyboard, but  it&#39;s not any fun <br/>
to listen to and you sure&#39;s hell can&#39;t sing along or dance a  minuet.<br/>
 <br/>
This isn&#39;t about prizes, it&#39;s about music and playing being satisfying for  <br/>
their own sake.  <br/>
 <br/>
In school if a kid loves painting but is forced to do photography and  <br/>
sculpture to get the six weeks of painting instruction, he might decide &quot;I hate  <br/>
art&quot; and stop taking art classes.  Some people who say they hate piano  probably <br/>
just hate the controls and the lack of honest personal attention.   A private <br/>
lesson is &quot;attention,&quot; but if the teacher&#39;s paying more attention to  the book <br/>
and the Curriculum than to the individual student, that&#39;s not very  personal.<br/>
 <br/>
The story of the kid whose teacher said &quot;too hard for you&quot; was sad.   They <br/>
could&#39;ve done four measures at a time, or one hand at a time, or turn it  into a <br/>
duet, or the teacher might have (had he had such an awareness, creativity  <br/>
and willingness) found pieces that were easier versions of the KINDS of things  <br/>
necessary for that other piece to come within the student&#39;s range of ability  <br/>
more quickly.   If that piece was &quot;The Entertainer,&quot; more Schubert  wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to help.<br/>
 <br/>
Children can be rewarded by feeling truly and directly heard and  seen.  They <br/>
can feel rewarded by playing piano for fun, without so much  focus on <br/>
recitals and perfection, and more on the feel of getting a fancy run  right whether <br/>
they ever even START on the second movement.  It&#39;s the  difference between <br/>
success and failure.  Successes can be small and  relaxing and fun.<br/>
 <br/>

&gt; Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] A question about rewards<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This question is not about my own kids, but about the piano studio I <br/>
&gt; run in my home. I&#39;m thinking of implementing something new this <br/>
&gt; fall, and while it appeals to me, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s at odds with <br/>
&gt; what I think about learning and rewards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I was thinking of having a spreadsheet for each piano <br/>
&gt; student with a little points sheet. At each lesson, they would get, <br/>
&gt; say, a point for remembering to bring all their books, a point for <br/>
&gt; completing any written assignments given, etc. [I would not give <br/>
&gt; them points for how much/long/often they practiced, for various <br/>
&gt; reasons.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They could them get extra points at any time, if they wanted, for <br/>
&gt; things like memorizing a piece, playing an informal &quot;concert&quot; for <br/>
&gt; family or friends, etc. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then, I would buy various little candies, keychains, various dollar <br/>
&gt; store toys, and maybe once a month have &quot;open store&quot; when they could <br/>
&gt; purchase various things with their points earned. Maybe have the <br/>
&gt; option, especially for older kids, that they could save a lot of <br/>
&gt; their points and &quot;buy&quot; a Target gift card or something.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The reason this appeals to me is that I could picture my students <br/>
&gt; liking it: I&#39;m hoping it would give a more &quot;fun&quot; and special feel to <br/>
&gt; the whole studio and coming over for lessons. I also could see some <br/>
&gt; of the kids liking a tangible way of keeping track of their <br/>
&gt; progress, and taking advantage of doing some of the extra things, <br/>
&gt; like memorizing pieces.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I am hesitant ... I remember reading a book called &quot;Punished by <br/>
&gt; Rewards.&quot; Would something like this ruin natural learning or <br/>
&gt; enthusiasm? Do you think your own kids would like or benefit from <br/>
&gt; something like that? Is it &quot;too schoolish&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your opinions,<br/>
&gt; Jenny<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not go down that route, for several reasons.<br/>
You mention that you want there to be a more &quot;fun&quot; feel to the studio, and this is kind of a pet peeve with me.<br/>
People assume that kids won&#39;t want to do anything that<br/>
isn&#39;t made &quot;fun&quot;.  To me, this seems like you&#39;re telling kids what to think, regardless of what their instincts are telling them, and this is not something I would think that you wan&#39;t to encourage.  Why wouldn&#39;t someone want to do something that is interesting and/or challenging?<br/>
This alone ought to be enough to bring in those who truly care, and isn&#39;t that who you want?<br/>
<br/>
Since you mention the book, &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot;, I&#39;ll say that what you are considering setting up is what he calls a &quot;token economy&quot;, similar to what is often set up in prisons and/or schools to reward &quot;good&quot; (officially sanctioned) behavior.<br/>

&gt; the reasons Alfie Kohn talks about. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughters and I were at the library last week and my oldest (8.75) <br/>
saw that the library was having a reading program.  She asked me about <br/>
it, we read the directions and she got REALLY excited.  Free prizes just <br/>
for reading like she already does?  She _had_ to sign up.  She was so <br/>
excited about it afterward in the car that I mentioned to her that the <br/>
bookstores are doing similar summer reading contests where after you <br/>
read so many books, you can actually get a free book.  We had to go and <br/>
sign up RIGHT THEN.  She was so excited at the idea of free books.  She <br/>
has made this a goal of hers now for the past week.  She was reading <br/>
just as much before last week, but now she has a personal goal to <br/>
accomplish, too.  It would have been very wrong of me to tell her that <br/>
she couldn&#39;t participate in these programs when she wanted to do so.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of Girl Scout cookie selling time.  We&#39;ve always told our <br/>
daughter that she doesn&#39;t have to sell any, but she has always chosen to <br/>
(with a specific goal), therefore, we always help her reach whatever <br/>
goal she wants to reach with no pressuring from us.  These are her goals <br/>
to accomplish and we are her supporters.<br/>
<br/>
So, I can see that my wholely unschooled daughter, Zoë, could <br/>
potentially be thrilled with some sort of reward program in a piano <br/>
class.  Could you set it up in such a way that it isn&#39;t required by the <br/>
students, but optional for those that are interested?  Of course, the <br/>
parents might try and force their kids to participate...<br/>

I consider all interesting/challenging problems to be fun.<br/>
It&#39;s probably not necessarily going to be easy, but it will be fun to solve the problem.  That&#39;s one of the reasons I don&#39;t like the sugar-coating.  It implies that the sugar-coating is the &quot;fun&quot; part, rather than the solution itself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060510443">Hi, Jenny-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll do my best to answer your questions but much is<br/>
forgotten (or buried?!?) after such a long time!  Not<br/>
that fading memory will shorten my reply ;)<br/>
<br/>
This teacher was one that my mother&#39;s best friend used<br/>
which translated into &#39;the best piano teacher in the<br/>
world.&#39;  Her methods amounted to &#39;if it&#39;s not on the<br/>
page, you don&#39;t play it.&#39;  Every crescendo had to<br/>
match the marking on the page, for example.  She kept<br/>
a sort of scoresheet, assigned writing tasks (yes, I<br/>
wrote whole pages of G clefs), etc.  She had a pointer<br/>
that she&#39;d use to beat time on the page or poke my<br/>
hands or wrists.  Which caused me to make mistakes. <br/>
Which she marked down in her book and wrote my &#39;score&#39;<br/>
on the page of whatever I was playing.  She made me<br/>
play the same piece over and over and over, week after<br/>
week, until I scored &#39;100&#39; (as in played it EXACTLY as<br/>
it was written on the page).<br/>
<br/>
All of this was reported to my parents (this is the<br/>
extra beating I mentioned).  My &#39;reward&#39; for getting<br/>
100 was that I got to start on yet another piece of<br/>
her choosing.  And then there was the ever-so-horrid<br/>
annual piano recital.  You don&#39;t want to know about<br/>
that.  Suffice to say that I have tremendous<br/>
performance anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
So, you see, her requirements were VERY concrete.  And<br/>
were, for me, almost completely unattainable.  She was<br/>
constructing musical mechanics, not musicians.  In my<br/>
case, she immobilized and destroyed the musician.  So<br/>
I married one :)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I know you could not possibly be teaching<br/>
by her methods.  I can only think of a few situations<br/>
where I&#39;d expect to find anyone who followed her<br/>
&#39;techniques.&#39;  However, in my later learning and<br/>
teaching experiences, I found that my students each<br/>
required and desired something different from their<br/>
music experience.  <br/>
<br/>
I spent time trying to find that out.  Most of them<br/>
were absolutely shocked that I asked, &quot;Why do you do<br/>
this?  What do you like about it?  How can I help<br/>
you?&quot;  The ones who did it because &#39;Mom/Dad said so&#39;<br/>
needed more help from me to find something THEY could<br/>
like about it, even if they never got &#39;better&#39; at it. <br/>
My students ranged from age 6 to (I&#39;m not kidding) 68.<br/>
 We had up days and down days and days when we didn&#39;t<br/>
get where we thought we were going but ended up<br/>
someplace else that was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
But it was always about music and everything was good<br/>
when it stayed that way.  If a student told me, &quot;I&#39;d<br/>
try more if you gave me (insert your favorite<br/>
treat/prize/cash award here),&quot; I would say, &quot;I see,&quot;<br/>
and then have a conversation with their parents about<br/>
maybe finding something else their child wanted to do<br/>
more.  Maybe it was a different instrument or maybe it<br/>
was a different activity altogether.  <br/>
<br/>
I always tried to make sure they knew it was because I<br/>
cared about their child&#39;s experience.  If we combine<br/>
forces to make your kid hate music today, what happens<br/>
in five, ten or fifty years (see my aforementioned 68<br/>
year-old student)?  It&#39;s a missed opportunity and<br/>
something that may end up on the &#39;I wish I could&#39; or<br/>
&#39;Why didn&#39;t I&#39; lists that we all seem to have.  Some<br/>
kids dig music, some don&#39;t.  It&#39;s all around us so I<br/>
always spent a lot of time talking about what we hear,<br/>
what it means to us, what we like about it, what we<br/>
can do ourselves.  For me, technical skill was easiest<br/>
to grow in my students when I spent time tending to<br/>
the root desire.  (or this could be a load of<br/>
fertilizer, if I extend the metaphor)<br/>
<br/>
Now aren&#39;t you sorry you asked? :D<br/>

<br/>
Although as I&#39;m thinking about it, I think I do see your point. If I <br/>
said, &quot;Here&#39;s a new thing we&#39;re gonna do that will make lessons FUN! <br/>
Isn&#39;t playing the piano FUN!&quot; then yes, that would be annoying. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a fine line, in some sense. I always hate it when the parents <br/>
say things like, &quot;Oh, wow, we see you&#39;re trying to make piano fun!&quot; <br/>
Ugh. No. <br/>
<br/>
But do I try hard to make it an enjoyable, pleasant experience for <br/>
each kid, and make them look forward to coming to my home each week? <br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for the input,<br/>

<br/>
Some people have fun births.<br/>
Once you&#39;re pregnant, there&#39;s an inevitability down the road one way or  <br/>
another. <br/>
 <br/>
Some surgery is optional, and you decide based on the alternatives.   That&#39;s <br/>
not quite &quot;to choose&quot; to do something interesting and challenging.   It&#39;s like <br/>
the dentist.  You don&#39;t *HAVE* to go but the consequences might  be bad.  <br/>
Lesser of two evils.<br/>

<br/>
But having a nice environment, speaking pleasantly, and in this description<br/>
having cookies, aren&#39;t rewards that are tied to something that the students<br/>
must do outside of the lessons to receive. It is the normally courteous<br/>
behavior of a civilized person who invites people into their space.<br/>
Presumably you would be like this with anyone visiting you, not just your<br/>
piano students. Also if the student failed to bring their notes or whatever<br/>
the designated behavior was that you were proposing to reward, you are not<br/>
then going to put them in the hot, stuffy corner and be rude to them, I&#39;m<br/>
sure!<br/>

If I were a piano student going against my will already, I&#39;d like it tons! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was a piano student going by my own choice, and liked it okay.  Food <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have helped, I don&#39;t think.   Maybe having the teacher not have long read <br/>
fingernails while she was telling me to cut mine all the time because &quot;you <br/>
can&#39;t play piano with fingernails&quot; would&#39;ve been nice.  I had short on one hand <br/>
and longer on the other, because I played guitar and finger-picked, but they <br/>
weren&#39;t as long as hers.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what&#39;s fun for me is when people are just honest and straightforward. <br/>
 <br/>
And when things are challenging and (forgot the other thing the other day <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).<br/>
And when lessons are intersting, or when there&#39;s food. <br/>
I guess I&#39;m just easily amused, and it&#39;s fun to be amused. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
