I need ideas for board games. We&#39;ve done Pokemon, Chinese Checkers & <br/>
Trouble to death.<br/>
Thing One is 6 and Thing Two is 3.5 :-)<br/>
This is the coolest game, and if you care, it deals with math, etc. It&#39;s <br/>
called Pass the Pigs. You get two cute little pis that you throw like dice and <br/>
gather points depending on how they land. Yesterday afternoon we had four adults <br/>
and a teenager play this for a LONG time and crack up the entire time. And <br/>
even pretty little kids would get it quickly. Cool game.<br/>
