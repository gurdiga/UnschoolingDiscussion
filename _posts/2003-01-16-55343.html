<br/>
We are trying to rev up life around here.  We&#39;ve been discussing interests, and my son is big into this...but I wasn&#39;t sure where to start.<br/>
<br/>
Are there other sites?  If I missed any (was no mail briefly) could you resend them??<br/>
<br/>
THanks!<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s also Digipen (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.digipen.edu/fun.shtml)">http://www.digipen.edu/fun.shtml)</a>. I think it&#39;s $20<br/>
for a year&#39;s access. (Or the $20 rate is for Nintendo Magazine subscribers?)<br/>
They have walkthroughs/lessons on designing games. The first one was on<br/>
making a pong game. (There have been write ups each month in Nintendo<br/>
magazine on the month&#39;s lesson but I think everything you need is on line.)<br/>
That&#39;s all I know since you need a PC with Windows 98 or higher and we<br/>
didn&#39;t (until yesterday!) have easy access to that.<br/>
