Wow!! You&#39;ll be happy to know that we will be continually adding peices to <br/>
the site.  The front page should change on a weekly basis, as should the book <br/>
reviews.  We have some more ideas on the back burner, but we wanted to go <br/>
ahead and release the site..... it seemed as if we could *tweak* things for <br/>
forever. :)<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just getting home.  :)  Again! In the last 10 years I have not travelled <br/>
as much as I have in the last 30 days.  It&#39;s been fun and exciting, but I do <br/>
declare I haven&#39;t slept more than 3 hours a night all month.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve about 500 peices of email, and when I sort through it, I will return to <br/>
start talking.   I do love to talk. &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

I just read your letter this morning.  I have been preparing an answer for <br/>
you &lt;g&gt; -- I am not totally familiar with all the laws of all the different <br/>
states, so if someone from your state doesn&#39;t answer right away, it may take <br/>
a little while for an answer to appear.  We are a brand new site, up only a <br/>
little over a week!!  So glad you found us, and keep on checking back, the <br/>
answers will come as more and more people find out about the site!!<br/>
