<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742819044">&lt;&lt; I like crossword puzzle books. Get a few for yourself and work on them <br/>
when you are around your kids. If they ask to do it also you could say No. or <br/>
Well, this one is mine, but I could get you one of you own. or Sure, just put <br/>
it on the table when you&#39;re through. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This also happens at my house. I like table puzzles and when I ask my sons <br/>
they never want to do them .  So I started buying them for myself with themes <br/>
they would like and start doing them. Sure enough I have all the help I need! <br/>
It takes us about a week to do them and my boys all enjoy it. But if I ask <br/>
them to do the puzzle they&#39;d say &#39;No way!&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363138126">Way back when, I had a few moments of panic or uncertainty. I decided that Kenna needed to read the Little House books. I got tons of them from the library and the yard sales and left them lying around. She didn&#39;t take the bait and getting more and more &#39;weirded out&#39; I pushed her to read one. I know, bad mommy. She hated it! She would much rather be reading Anne McCaffrey or Piers Anthony or Tamora Pierce. So I read them. They were pretty bad, but I felt better. I&#39;ve found my most panicky times are when I want to learn more. So now I&#39;ll let myself learn and then I&#39;m much more relaxed with the kids. Takes care of the demon for awhile.<br/>
