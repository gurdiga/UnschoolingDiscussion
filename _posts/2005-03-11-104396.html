<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044809934">Kelly.. I am glad for your post.. it was an inspiration for me. It&#39;s <br/>
funny.. because I once was that sort of person.. the most outspoken <br/>
supporter of unschooling in a very conservative hm&#39;school group. My family <br/>
and I have had a tough year, one thing after another. I&#39;m just a bit beat <br/>
down lately, and this last hurdle; having to deal with the juvenile dept. <br/>
was scary. I have no excuse for not being more confident. We aren&#39;t new <br/>
unschoolers, I know this is right for my kids. I&#39;ve read almost everything <br/>
Sandra has written and I&#39;ve been a lurker here on the unschooling discussion <br/>
list for a while too. I will be at the conference in Oct, and hopefully when <br/>
it&#39;s over, will feel &quot;armed to the teeth&quot; again too. Anyway I&#39;m saving what <br/>
you wrote. Julie in MO</div>
