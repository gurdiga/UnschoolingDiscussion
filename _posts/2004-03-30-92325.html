<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930355272">I&#39;m sending to this list because I think it would be very nice to <br/>
introduce Sweden to the unschooling side of homeschooling, if possible.<br/>

<br/>
This one needs a fast response:<br/>
<br/>
A Swedish television program is doing a spot on homeschooling. They<br/>
are interested in visiting and interviewing a homeschooling family<br/>
with 3 or more kids interested in appearing on camera. A reporter<br/>
and cameraman would spend 30 to 45 minutes with the family and is<br/>
interested in their reasons for homeschooling, opinion of public<br/>
schools, and what type of activities they do.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the DC region (Northern Virginia, Maryland) and would<br/>
be interested in being interviewed for Swedish television (where<br/>
homeschooling is a new concept to the mainstream population), please<br/>
call Alexa immediately at (703) 577-2812<br/>
<br/>
Summary:<br/>
<br/>
Who: homeschooling family, preferably 3 or more kids<br/>
What: Interview for Swedish television with on-camera appearance<br/>
