 </span></blockquote>I had a great conversation on the way to and back from the dentist today with <br/>
my 12yro. (I love car conversations, my 16yro and I also have some great ones <br/>
when I drive him to and back from the place he teaches snowboarding, it&#39;s <br/>
about 45 minutes each way but that&#39;s another post, LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway on the way to the dentist Tom was telling me that he has a lot of <br/>
friends and he names off the neighborhood kids plus he adds all the kids he plays <br/>
on sports teams with. Later, on the way back he was telling me that his <br/>
friends think he should go back to school to make more friends. I mentioned that he <br/>
had said he had a lot of friends already and I wondered what he would do with <br/>
more right now? He agreed and said he didn&#39;t know. I also added that I was <br/>
remembering that he also likes a certain amount of time alone to work on his own <br/>
stuff and he agreed. He also told me somewhere in this conversation that he is <br/>
a lot more mature than his friends because he is with adults a lot and that <br/>
he would be different if he were with kids all of the time. <br/>
<br/>
Somehow we got onto reading and he told me that all his friends know he is <br/>
not a good reader and they are OK with it. I wondered if that were still true or <br/>
was that just something that was true once but had changed and he hadn&#39;t <br/>
realized it, I mean maybe you are a better reader today but you keep saying you <br/>
aren&#39;t a good reader. He thinks he reads OK but not as good as his friends. I <br/>
asked if he was OK with how well he reads now and he said he was.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about what people could do if they wanted to read better, one thing <br/>
was to read more. So you are OK with how you read now and you know some <br/>
things to do if you decide you want to read better in the future? And he said yes. <br/>
So I told him that was OK with me, that it sounded like he had given this some <br/>
thought and I was here to help if he ever needed it. This is so powerful to <br/>
me, knowing that he is aware of the power he has over his own life.<br/>
<br/>
Last night he asked me if science couldn&#39;t be done just building things like <br/>
robots? I feel so privileged to be along on this ride.<br/>
