&gt; Kids who&#39;ve spent very long in school, or with parents pushing &quot;educational <br/>
&gt; activities&quot; at them, might be twitchy about museums and hikes and other <br/>
&gt; really <br/>
&gt; cool stuff, so a parent trying to deschool might have to avoid those yet for <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; awhile - especially if they&#39;d be inclined to put on the teacher voice and <br/>
&gt; start <br/>
&gt; quizzing and rushing on a museum visit or a nature hike or whatever. And <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even THINK about going along on a &quot;field trip&quot; with a homeschool <br/>
&gt; group.   :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We&#39;re off to visit the new grocery store that opened a few blocks away. Very <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; cool.<br/>

through it), although he was willing to go to museums, but anything that seemed even <br/>
vaguely schoolish was strictly verboten.<br/>
<br/>
One of the coolest things we did during our first year was to go to a Chinese <br/>
market and shop for food for a traditional Chinese dinner that we prepared <br/>
together.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;d been interested in anything Chinese for awhile...we&#39;d watched movies, <br/>
read stories, played with calligraphy (stamp sets), the Chinese horoscope, ate <br/>
out at Chinese restaurants, went to exhibits of Asian art and antiques at <br/>
museums and galleries, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I found recipes at the library and off the internet, and found an <br/>
authentic Chinese cookbook and travel book combination at a remainder store...he <br/>
enjoyed looking through the recipes with me and learning about the differences <br/>
between northern and southern Chinese cooking, among other things.  We <br/>
planned the whole things out, complete with exotic ingredients, and headed out.  We <br/>
must have wandered that store for hours, buying lucky bamboo and engraved <br/>
porcelain chopsticks along with all of our eventually found ingredients...then we <br/>
came home and had a blast cooking it and presenting it as traditionally as we <br/>
could.<br/>
<br/>
The wonton fell apart in the broth and the rice cakes were tough, but we sure <br/>
did have a good time. :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of ways of engaging the mind without resorting to schoolish <br/>
activities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952453493">** There are sometimes worksheets out in at the door, with the exhibit flyer <br/>
and<br/>
my kids look and laugh, because the questions are inane. They&#39;re not<br/>
designed to do anything but prove that the kids scanned the whole room, and <br/>
they DO<br/>
scan. They end up ignoring important and interesting things just to find<br/>
their answers. Just like answering the questions at the end of a chapter, <br/>
only<br/>
worse. One question for the cool Canadian sports exhibit was &quot;Which exhibit<br/>
had a green ball?&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
On one of our zoo visits a few years ago, we were hanging out in the rain <br/>
forest building, two of the kids sketching and the third bouncing back and forth <br/>
watching something or other, when a cluster of mid-teens from a school group <br/>
came swirling through, yelling and pushing and reading a question aloud from <br/>
their worksheets to the docent accompanying them. When they had rushed on out of <br/>
the building a few minutes later Patrick noted &quot;Mom, they didn&#39;t look at <br/>
ANYTHING if it wasn&#39;t on their sheets. I don&#39;t think they really saw anything in <br/>
here at all, not even the bats they were answering the question about.&quot; The <br/>
docent hung out watching my children sketch bats and foxes for a few more <br/>
minutes, and then we were on our way.<br/>
