<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780066720">I have realized something recently in my struggle with the grandparents:<br/>
short is better.<br/>
<br/>
I send my parents short, enlightening quotes or ideas periodically.  They<br/>
respond very well to this, and don&#39;t get defensive like they do when I shove<br/>
books, articles, etc. on them.  But after a few quotes here and a few there,<br/>
I think they&#39;re starting to &quot;get&quot; that unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
The latest quote I sent them came straight out of the Unschooling.Com Online<br/>
Newsletter.  It&#39;s copied below.  My Dad liked this one well enough to share<br/>
around at work.  I consider that quite an improvement.  My Dad is an<br/>
Educational Consultant for the State of Iowa.  I *love* when I&#39;m right on<br/>
education -- it&#39;s pretty rare!  Thanks (yet again!), Unschooling.com!<br/>

&quot;Your efforts may, at first, seem more like scrap lumber randomly scattered<br/>
across the vast universe that is your child rather than a remarkable<br/>
structure you watch rise, floor by measurable floor. But the Eiffel Tower<br/>
didn&#39;t appear overnight, and the most beautiful cathedrals of the world took<br/>
decades to complete.<br/>
<br/>
It helps to think of yourself not as &quot;teacher&quot; the way you remember it, but<br/>
like the supplier whose purpose is merely making sure the builder - your<br/>
child - can get his hands on the necessary materials when he needs them. Be<br/>
happy when you make any sale, however modest. The true architect will use<br/>
the <br/>
materials in his own way, in his own time.<br/>
<br/>
Schools force a child into using his limited resources today. &quot;Build a bird<br/>
house,&quot; they demand, &quot;so that we may count how many sticks you&#39;ve<br/>
collected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At home there&#39;s no need for immediate &quot;proof&quot;. Be patient. Don&#39;t measure.<br/>
Who <br/>
can say what exquisite masterpiece your child will shape and build from the<br/>
scraps tomorrow - or ten years from now? The more he collects, the greater<br/>
the structure he&#39;s capable of building. And when that structure is life<br/>
itself, don&#39;t settle for a bird house today. Trust you&#39;ll find a castle<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Simply provide the materials.&quot;</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that the truth?  My ILs have been the biggest struggle for us in<br/>
our homeschooling life.  I did the &quot;send them info&quot; stage.  I sent<br/>
books, articles, websites, and finally a really long letter trying to<br/>
explain that we were doing our very best and parenting in the best way<br/>
that we knew how based on current information.  [They basically believe<br/>
that we are saying that they were horrible parents since we were/are<br/>
doing everything different than they did- which is NOT what we were<br/>
saying (they were the best parents they knew how to be at the time).]  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they finally told us that we had a lot to learn in life and that<br/>
they didn&#39;t want anything to do with grandchildren who would probably<br/>
die from parents that wanted to homeschool and vegetarian feed them! <br/>
So, we had no further contact...  for over 3 years.  When our second<br/>
child was born, after much debate, we decided to tell them that she<br/>
existed.  She is almost 2 years old now, and we are just starting to<br/>
have an acquaintance-type relationship with them.  They will never<br/>
actually know us (their choice, I&#39;ve tried being open about who I am),<br/>
but at least they are willing to be around us and not scream at us (or<br/>
roll their eyes, which is WORSE!).  We haven&#39;t outright said it (we&#39;ve<br/>
only seen them ONCE in 5 years and that was about 3 months ago), but a<br/>
bunch of topics are just off limits.<br/>
<br/>
To the mother who wanted help dealing with her grandmother-  Know when<br/>
to walk away.  Sometimes that makes the biggest statement of them all. <br/>
I truly wish and pray that her eyes will open to the greatness of<br/>
unschooling, but for some people that is impossible.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good for you, Lisa. You are right, there are definitely times to just cut <br/>
your losses and run! You get the &quot;worst in-laws&quot; award!! Yuck. I wish you <br/>
well in your new contacts with them. Maybe they&#39;ll see how fabulous your <br/>
kids are and realize that you&#39;re not so evil after all. Maybe not. :-/ So <br/>
sad.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391226456">Oh Lisa, this is so sad. I can&#39;t believe that grandparents would actually go<br/>
so far as to not want to see there own grandchildren for such silly reasons<br/>
as being homeschooled and raised vegetarian. DH and I also told his parents<br/>
about our plans for homeschooling our boys (who are 9 & 11) and they were<br/>
raised vegetarian since birth. Now I can see that their response to our<br/>
parenting choices were very mild and even accepting, although they did<br/>
question us at first. I guess I should be thankful for the in-laws that I<br/>
have.<br/>
