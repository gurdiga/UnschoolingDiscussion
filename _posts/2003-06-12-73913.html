<div id="ygrps-yiv-765542461">Today I had finally had it with some kids that have been bugging Dustin.<br/>
There are three boys and when two are put together they are mean to him.<br/>
A couple days ago this one boy Zack took his watch and threatened to also <br/>
take his bike. Dustin told him to knock it off and that he was a typical public <br/>
schooler bully.<br/>
He was upset that they where being mean and began to cry. The boy told him to <br/>
run home baby.<br/>
 <br/>
Today the other boy called him an F***ing A** hole and the Zack kid smashed <br/>
into his bike and messed up his front end.<br/>
Dustin came home all upset and told me. With in 15 minutes the nice boy <br/>
Jarred came by and told him to come back over. I explained nicely (Jarred stutters <br/>
when he gets nervous so I was really talking softly) that I was concerned <br/>
about what was happening and I want to make sure Dustin isn&#39;t being treated <br/>
poorly.<br/>
 <br/>
THEN.. the two other boys showed up and I told them that I was NOT going to <br/>
tolerate ANYONE touching him or his property. That we choose to Homeschool <br/>
because of bullies and public school crap and I&#39;ll be darned if I am going to <br/>
allow it or put up with it.<br/>
 <br/>
The kid Zack is sitting on his bike with a shit eaten grin on his face. I <br/>
said ZACK do you think this is funny??? I said as a matter a fact if I see or <br/>
find out this has continued I will be visiting your parents and oh by the way <br/>
maybe you both should go home and tell your parents exactly what I have said and <br/>
if they would like to discuss this have them come by I would love to talk with <br/>
them! <br/>
 <br/>
They left and later told my son I was a witch, lol. Then I guess the father <br/>
of the nice boy told them that if they couldn&#39;t be nice that they should stay <br/>
away also. <br/>
 <br/>
Who knows what will happen now. I actually stayed out in the yard with <br/>
Cassidy and Nicholas waiting for a parent to come by (pulled then in the wagon, not <br/>
stood and waited). I know who they are so no surprise to me.<br/>
 <br/>
I really hope this doesn&#39;t continue. I want to see my son happy and this just <br/>
totally broke his heart.<br/>

Raine replies: I have this same problem with my 12 yr. old son. It seems all the boys he comes into contact with are bullys. It&#39;s awful for him because, not only is he subjected to their abuse, but he has no friends. On occassion he has been so desperate for playmates that he has endured certain kids for a time (we put our foots down only with the ones who are physically abusive), but quickly decides it&#39;s simply not worthwhile.  <br/>
Anyway, just thought it was interesting that this is not an isolated problem. What is happening to the boys in our culture to make them unable to be kind to each other??<br/>

Well, I&#39;m running into the same problem here, only my son is caving to all the peer pressure to avoid the lonliness.  It seems he has also been tolerating plenty of physical abuse in order to have someone to hang out with.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish I knew what I could do to help him establish some good long-term, local friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713834412">IMHO, Bullying comes from a lack of power to control oneself, so you control those you see as weaker.  Hence, if school controlled where I had to sit, when I had use the loo, who I had to  pass the ball to, then I controlled my lil brother when I got home.  The more out-of-control I felt (which was made worse by my &quot;feelings&quot; nature, the more I needed to control him.  If bullies beat me up, then I beat him up too.  If I had to stay afterschool and do math problems, I made him miserable.<br/>
<br/>
If my Dad was doing his usual 25 hour days catching poachers, then I watched TV and had no one around to model male behaviours.  So I yelled &quot;Gilligan&quot; at my brother and whacked him repeatedly with my hat/toy/hand.<br/>
<br/>
We lived in a town where the boys were esp. vicious for 2 years.  Awful. Farming community in S. Alberta.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1856856924">LOL..thanks!<br/>
<br/>
So far, I&#39;m just taking it one day at a time.  Each day I try to find things to keep them busy.  Yesterday, I offered the brand spankin new lawn tractor to him so he could mow both yards.  He took me up on it.<br/>
<br/>
Today he is working.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is a picnic. Ok, thats 3 days covered LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live???  I&quot;m thinking as soon as I get the bills paid through July I&#39;m going to start planning some trips for next year.  Maybe I&#39;ll have to call upon all you unschooler hostesses that offered your homes for traveling unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Might be fun!<br/>

Full time in the Bay Area, part time in the middle of nowhere (northern <br/>
California!)<br/>
Unschooling folks are always welcome to visit our tiny but fabulous home - <br/>
and if they don&#39;t mind dirt, camping or showering surrounded by nothing but <br/>
a water tank, a few mosquitoes and a whole lotta space and mountains, <br/>
they&#39;re welcome up at the northernly space too!  (...or, you could take a <br/>
really big bath in the Eel River if you don&#39;t like showers...)<br/>
Consider it an engraved invite.<br/>
