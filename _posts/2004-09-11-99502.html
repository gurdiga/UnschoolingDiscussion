<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650129568">We got DS his Gameboy Advanced when he was not quite 5 1/2 - we were <br/>
flying to OK and thought it might be a fun thing for him to have on <br/>
the plane and waiting in the airport and all. It came with Pokemon <br/>
Crystal I think and he and DH played that cooperatively - DH would <br/>
handle things like following specific paths to gain certain things <br/>
and DS would travel around and have battles and such. Over time, DS <br/>
got better at handling things over all. He also had all the <br/>
different types memorized and knew which was most effective against <br/>
which. It also sparked an interest in learning days of the week in <br/>
order so he could know when certain things were happening - certain <br/>
boats only sail on certain days and such. We also have Piglet&#39;s Big <br/>
Adventure - not one we&#39;d recommend really  -it was hard even for DH <br/>
who is a game player to figure out; Snood - that is kind of fun and <br/>
arcade-like; a Mario Kart racing type game which is okay; gee, we&#39;ve <br/>
got a bunch of games now, I don&#39;t even know what all AND we&#39;ve <br/>
upgraded to the Gameboy Advanced SP - the design of the thing is <br/>
much nicer - less bulky and a backlit screen. DS sold his old one to <br/>
a friend of ours (coworker who&#39;s grandson left his on a airplane <br/>
while on vacation - bummer) for half what it would have cost for her <br/>
to replace it new.<br/>
<br/>
I think it just depends on the individual child - some kids just <br/>
have that videogame fine motor type thing going at 5 and others <br/>
might not be quite ready.</div>

my 3yo can play the easiest level great.  They have it in both PC and <br/>

I have another meaning for &quot;snood&quot;----if you&#39;re interested!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a piece of fabric with elastic at both ends that goes over  a dog&#39;s head <br/>
& neck. It keeps his ears clean by not allowing them to drag  the ground or <br/>
slosh in food or water buckets. Used most often by owners  of Afghan hounds and <br/>
basset hounds.<br/>

apparel - human or canine.  ;)  I have a greyhound and he needs a coat <br/>
in cold weather.  His Winter coat is similar to a standard dog coat, <br/>
but it has a &quot;snood&quot; sewn onto it also to keep his neck and ears warm <br/>
and covered too.<br/>

The snood has been around for a long time. The last time a snood was a<br/>
*popular* hair accessory for women was during the forties (WWII). A mesh or<br/>
net kind of bag over the back of the head going behind the ears and holding<br/>
the loose hair - so a practical item to keep hair out of the machines for<br/>
those who didn&#39;t want to cut in an era where pony tails were not something<br/>
adults tended to wear. It also was made decorative by being made from lace<br/>
or velvet ribbon sometimes, or having gems or pearls attached. You can find<br/>
them a lot on Turner Classic Movies. They were really meant to be under a<br/>
hat, especially for evenings. <br/>
<br/>
In the period immediately following the war, especially with Dior&#39;s &quot;New<br/>
Look&quot; hair got shorter, up in back behind the ears and I&#39;m not sure that the<br/>
snood has ever really recovered as a mainstream item. Then again we don&#39;t<br/>
wear hats in the same way either since the 60&#39;s, and snoods really did work<br/>
best with a hat.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254775776">DS saw the PC version at MIL&#39;s (MIL is a PC game player - stuff like <br/>
Snood and Solitaire and assorted games like that, relatively calm <br/>
things). When he saw it for his GameBoy he was thrilled and gets <br/>
excited as he gets to ever more challenging levels. What was even <br/>
more fun was going to the science center one day and playing Snood <br/>
on their computers in the computer/technology area - DS thought that <br/>
was too cool.</div>
