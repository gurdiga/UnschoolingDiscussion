Seems like it&#39;s usually said by someone who&#39;s never used a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been using Macs since 1985, when we traded up from our first <br/>
KayPro II (anyone remember those?). We use our computers seriously, <br/>
sometimes literally running them for months at a time, and dragging <br/>
our PowerBooks off into the wilderness with us, horsebackriding, <br/>
sailing, 4-wheeling - you name it, we&#39;ve probably done it with a Mac <br/>
or two along!<br/>
<br/>
I like Macs because they&#39;re almost foolproof and they *rarely* glitch <br/>
up - in over 15 years of running one Mac after another after another <br/>
(trading up to keep our hardware state-of-the-art for production <br/>
purposes, not because they wore out or anything), the most serious <br/>
problem I&#39;ve run into has been my own dumb fault, and fixing it has <br/>
never been more than a restart away. Right now we have six or <br/>
seven... I&#39;m not sure because most are over in the office (which I <br/>
try to stay out of) and I lost track of how many we have. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people I know run PCs, so I&#39;m pretty familiar with them - <br/>
and even the best ones just sound like one big ongoing headache. I <br/>
don&#39;t want to rebuild everything once a week or even once a month - I <br/>
just want my computer to do what I want it to, when I want it to, <br/>
period. Macs do that. I&#39;d never consider using anything else. Nevah! <br/>

programmed and networked and administrated hundreds,<br/>
if not thousands, of macs AND PCs. <br/>
<br/>
But I still don&#39;t know the difference. I think macs<br/>
are best if you want something simple and trouble-free<br/>
while pcs are for more computery people.<br/>
<br/>
But I really have no idea. I&#39;ll ask him why he said<br/>
that, since it&#39;s still being discussed. He will<br/>
probably be embarrassed that I repeated it, because he<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have wanted to offend anyone. Juli<br/>

<br/>
The old Mac vs. PC war has been going on for as long as I can remember!<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t like Macs and I hate Windows because it is nothing but<br/>
Apple wannabee stuff and if I wanted that I would buy that!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I love GTOs and the 400 that ran in them.  They run &quot;hot&quot; and that&#39;s<br/>
just the way they are.  So, I never thought I would upset a fellow PC user<br/>
by saying that PCs run hot.  I mean, it isn&#39;t really a &quot;bad&quot; thing, just the<br/>
way they are.  Guess I&#39;ll have to let the kidlets in on this discussion and<br/>
they&#39;ll run and do some tests &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We will interrupt your regular programing when they find some Macs to test.<br/>
We only have PCs here.  Hmmmm, wonder which friend they are going to bug<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Ok, I asked DH about this and he said and I quote:<br/>
&gt; &quot;Mac users will tell you PCs run hot, but don&#39;t try to<br/>
&gt; reason with them because they are unreasonable as<br/>
&gt; evidenced by the fact that they use Macs.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His words, not mine. I don&#39;t even know what he means,<br/>
&gt; but his PC prejudice is showing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then he said, &quot;IF your PC runs hot, you should turn it<br/>
&gt; off. Ours is set to shut down if it gets too hot. They<br/>
&gt; can tell if theirs runs hot by putting their hands by<br/>
&gt; the fan in back. The air near it shouldn&#39;t be hotter<br/>
&gt; than body temperature. Like testing a baby bottle on<br/>
&gt; the wrist.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I said,&quot;These are unschoolers, natural parenting<br/>
&gt; people, they didn&#39;t use bottles.&quot; (My children are his<br/>
&gt; step children, so he hasn&#39;t raised a baby.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, he said, like testing bath water then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So there you go. The lowdown from a Mac hater, anyway.<br/>

when I was a wee girl that Dad was into computers even back then and the kaypro

from the 8082 or something like that. Slowly moved up to a 286, 386, 486, and 
finally a pentium that is already a dinosaur in computereze world...and all this 
over ten years time. I cannot afford to have more than one computer at a time

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been away from the graphic art field for about ten years now. We all had <br/>
Mac&#39;s in the art dept. when I was there. Do ANY art departments use anything <br/>
but Mac&#39;s now?  (I mean, I&#39;m asking, I don&#39;t know.)<br/>
<br/>
Is this the question that will polarize human society and lead ultimately to <br/>
apocalypse? Mac or PC?<br/>
<br/>
 The question to ask at parties, instead of &quot;What do you do?&quot; &quot;Mac or PC?&quot; <br/>
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re one of us, then.&quot; :)<br/>

&lt;&lt; i think schools would prefer macs since my kids have been on them from teh<br/>
time they could crawl into the chair and never harmed the machine or the<br/>
software.  Can&#39;t say that about our PC &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, true!!!<br/>
<br/>
My kids have used our computers for baby games with never a problem, but we <br/>
got a housemate with a PC and she is often complaining that the kids messed <br/>
up this or that.<br/>
