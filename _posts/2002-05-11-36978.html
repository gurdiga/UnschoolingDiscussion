<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363228901"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; DH and I have had the discussion before about how to keep gifts (i.e.<br/>
&gt; birthday and Christmas) special, when throughout the year we pick up<br/>
&gt; learning type stuff - books, crafts, learning toys etc.  Maybe it&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; because our oldest is just 3 1/2, but it&#39;s hard for him to distinguish<br/>
&gt; between the two things right now.  Books are a lot of this, because they<br/>
&gt; are something I&#39;ve always bought a lot of so whenever I find a good<br/>
&gt; source of used kids books I pick some up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I give a toy or two of the non-educational variety for these -- the kind of<br/>
stuff kids like but really are not vastly educational in and of themselves,<br/>
and I&#39;m not likely to spend money on during the year.  Also, we are building<br/>
a tool set for our son, so he always gets a tool for these occasions and<br/>
looks forward to that (screwdriver, hammer, wrench, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t what you&#39;re asking, but have you considered making those<br/>
kind of occasions more about the non-gift stuff and just doing the holiday<br/>
stuff together - pagents, church, decorating, baking, etc.  Birthdays might<br/>
be harder with that, but surely somebody will have some good ideas!<br/>
