&lt;&lt;I wonder, what is the difference that I recall these childhood memories<br/>
with<br/>
fondness and affection rather than resentment and hostility towards my<br/>
Daddy?<br/>
I think it&#39;s because for all the &quot;wrong things&quot; my Daddy did, he done many<br/>
times over more &quot;right things&quot;   Thank goodness for that, otherwise, I might<br/>
have been scarred for life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Teresa, I was reading your post and thinking how sad it sounded with your<br/>
dad, not your mom and sister parts. I&#39;m glad you have better memories and<br/>
don&#39;t look back on that and get upset. Sounds like maybe your mom had a lot<br/>
to do with how you looked at it also.<br/>

Nowadays, I am watching all those myths collapse in front of my very eyes.  And I&#39;m so glad.<br/>

  I remember getting yelled at for spilling things.  I also remember <br/>
  when me and my sis were growing up we could not laugh or talk at the <br/>
  dinner table.  Well, of course we would end up in the giggles <br/>
  probably from stress&lt;G&gt; and then get yelled at, maybe spanked.  It is <br/>
  so ridiculous to me, all I want to do is hear my kids laugh.  It is <br/>
  always the right time for that!  We are all pretty relaxed around <br/>
  here.  I think humor is the cornerstone for our marriage and how we <br/>
  interact with the kids.  We are always laughing at eachother, <br/>
  probably too much..LOL!  Don&#39;t trip in front of me, my maturity <br/>
  reaches an all time low!! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

  &gt; &lt;&lt;They didn&#39;t spill their juice on purpose.  They come to me and <br/>
  say &quot;Mom I<br/>
  &gt; spilled my juice on the rug.&quot;  I say &quot;OK do you need help cleaning <br/>
  it up?&quot;<br/>
  &gt; Then they either say no and go get a towel or they say yes and we <br/>
  clean it<br/>
  &gt; up<br/>
  &gt; together.  There is no punishment.  I don&#39;t scream at them for <br/>
  spilling the<br/>
  &gt; juice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; And aside from our children crying, isn&#39;t this one of the first <br/>
  things that<br/>
  &gt; really test our patience and the way we parent? Spilling stuff?? <br/>
  And is it<br/>
  &gt; really that big of a deal? I can&#39;t think of any time that it is. So <br/>
  you<br/>
  &gt; spend some time cleaning it up, we&#39;ve all spilled stuff. I can&#39;t <br/>
  imagine<br/>
  &gt; getting all bent out of shape over something like that. And if our <br/>
  children<br/>
  &gt; see us so upset over something that was a genuine accident, what <br/>
  they must<br/>
  &gt; think we&#39;ll do if they really make a mistake?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &lt;&lt;I also try to help whenever asked.  Even if I think they can do it<br/>
  &gt; themselves.  If my oldest asks me to make him a peanut butter <br/>
  sandwich,<br/>
  &gt; unless there is some reason that I can&#39;t, I will say yes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; And again, not really a big deal and it makes them so happy. I <br/>
  still do<br/>
  &gt; things like that for Tara. Sometimes without her asking I&#39;ll just <br/>
  go and<br/>
  &gt; finish food she started cooking and bring it to her. She is just so <br/>
  happy to<br/>
  &gt; have me do it. And like this morning, she stayed home from school <br/>
  and came<br/>
  &gt; out all sleepy and kissing me and said &quot;Mommy&quot; in a voice that I <br/>
  know she&#39;s<br/>
  &gt; going to ask for something. I always tease when she uses that tone <br/>
  and just<br/>
  &gt; say no and she laughs. She was hungry for pancakes. Now she&#39;s quite <br/>
  capable<br/>
  &gt; of making them herself and I was doing about 5 other things but so <br/>
  what? I<br/>
  &gt; made pancakes and she was so very happy and so was Alyssa and <br/>
  Sierra as they<br/>
  &gt; ended up eating again!!! It was a great way to start a great day!<br/>

I was so overwhelmed with the WAY overactivity of my firstborn.  I just<br/>
didni&#39;t know what I could or should do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I should also say that I too use to get a bit ruffled with spills from my<br/>
first child. Again it was inexperience and just not seeing that it wasn&#39;t a<br/>
big deal. I do now though and luckily it didn&#39;t take me long to see that. Of<br/>
course even now my first instinct is to think OH NO because I am a bit of<br/>
clean freak. It&#39;s a big house with a lot of inhabitants. But I refrain and<br/>
say it&#39;s okay, no big deal and then secretly the next day pull out the<br/>
carpet cleaner!!!<br/>

&gt; Teresa<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mine did and was an alcoholic also. From what I understand I was to be a boy. <br/>
I paid dearly for that.<br/>
When I lived with him I was beaten because I didn&#39;t wake up with a smile. <br/>
Every morning my stepmother would stand at the top of the stairs and wait. If <br/>
I was not smiling and did not say good morning back I was punished and hit. <br/>
This went on for months. I refused to do that and why the hell did it matter <br/>
anyway?  If they would have just let me wake up I would have been fine. I <br/>
still wake up grumpy at times.<br/>
<br/>
He is a better man now and we have talked about it. Actually when I was 22 I <br/>
was very much a big drinker.  One night I called him totally drunk and let <br/>
him have it. I told him I hated what he did to me and that most of my <br/>
childhood was spent dealing with what he had done to me. We talked for hours <br/>
that night.<br/>
<br/>
I was a very quiet child and would never talk to any adults. I constantly <br/>
herd &quot;oh she&#39;s so quiet.&quot; Gee I wonder why?<br/>
<br/>
Fact is I joined the Marines because he said I was too cocky to make it <br/>
through any boot camp. So I joined the hardest one.  Well, I showed him. I <br/>
was also able to deal with my anger. Boot camp broke me. I was angry that <br/>
they pushed me so hard but in the last month I learned a lot about my self.<br/>
<br/>
I was/am a survivor or abuse, rape and was dumped child. I was in a foster <br/>
home (right across the street from my family) and my foster father also raped <br/>
me when I was 13.  I was confused and very reckless later.  My Mom who <br/>
thought she was the know it all of drug detection accused me of using drugs. <br/>
I did experiment later but I has actually been secretly drinking for years. <br/>
It was the constant accusations that drove me to try drugs.  <br/>
<br/>
I will never do that to my kids. I talk to them about everything. My oldest <br/>
knows if he needs to come to me he can.  <br/>
<br/>
At almost 33 I wish I knew then what I know now.  I think I am still a work <br/>
in progress and their are missing years in my life.  I was tested constantly. <br/>
I know those tests especially the one with the physiologist holds the answers <br/>
to the missing information. My Mom has them and keeps making excuses like she <br/>
cant find them etc.<br/>
<br/>
I let it go until an old friend of the family told me a few years ago that <br/>
she is proud of me and had really thought I would not have made it past 18.  <br/>
Not a good thing to tell me but part of me is glad someone knew something cuz <br/>
something was eating away at me.<br/>
She is very I&#39;ll right now. I am afraid she will pass and I will never know. <br/>
Maybe from her concerns it is best I don&#39;t know...... She is a great woman <br/>
and I know she is keeping it for a good reason.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe too much information but this is what was in my head when I <br/>
read some of the posts.<br/>
