<div id="ygrps-yiv-489283618">Thank you to all who responded to my message about my son.  He is not <br/>
attending school - though he did last year.  He struggled every day and <br/>
summer school really opened my eyes to the lack of individual attention he <br/>
gets in a classroom setting.  I did homeschool him one year while we moved, <br/>
but he wanted to go back.  This year, we are both excited about our upcoming <br/>
school year together.  Getting him motivated is my biggest concern.  He has <br/>
very little interest in anything related to school - even when it is just fun <br/>
(cooking, art, etc.)  I think some of this is related to his depression as I <br/>
go through those moods as well.  Any suggestions on motivating reluctant <br/>
learners would be helpful as well.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought of food allergies - does anyone have any resources on an <br/>
elimination diet?  I am unsure of how to approach finding out if he has food <br/>
allergies and our doctors here are of very little help.  I am also looking <br/>
into many different forms of natural healing (like aromatherapy, massage, <br/>
sound therapy, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all of your thoughts and ideas - just feeling like I&#39;m <br/>
not alone in all this is helping tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just read in Gentle Spirit Magazine, (www.gentlespirit.com) an article by a <br/>
gal who has ADD. I&#39;m not sure if this particular article is online or not.  <br/>
She uses a combination of Tangerine Oil and Lavendar Oil to help her focus <br/>
more.  She uses a spritz in the room.  You could also use it as a massage <br/>
oil, in a bath, etc.  I will look up some of my other resources too and let <br/>
you know.<br/>

every so often. He&#39;ll bloom in his own time.  :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You might try to find Doris(I think) Rapp&#39;s book about kids with food <br/>
allergies.I can&#39;t remember the title. I took my kids to an allergist (both <br/>
are allergic to milk, at least). He suggested we try the multiple food <br/>
elimination diet.   We had had a really tough couple of years and i just <br/>
couldn&#39;t add one more thing to my plate!! So we never did it.<br/>
  I know that we see many changes in our girls when they have too much dairy: <br/>
aggressiveness, irritibility, insomnia, as well as stuffy noses and stomache <br/>
aches.<br/>
  let me know if you need more info, and I&#39;ll try to find the diet for you.<br/>
