<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486009364">You all may be interested to know that the National Home Education Network <br/>
wrote to the NEA not too long ago and received a reply. <br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. Chase:<br/>
I saw your recent speech to the National Press Club on CSPAN. I was <br/>
arrested in my spin around the dial by a man who said he was a <br/>
history teacher. Since I, too, was a history teacher, I stopped to <br/>
listen to what he had to say. I was immediately impressed by this <br/>
man&#39;s authenticity and humility, as well as by his compelling <br/>
presentation â€“ all hallmarks of an excellent teacher. I was very <br/>
pleased to discover that this man was Bob Chase, President of the <br/>
National Education Association. I am a former member of your <br/>
organization, but for the past twenty years I have been retired from <br/>
classroom teaching. Instead, I have been homeschooling with our two <br/>
children, the younger of whom is now in her first year of college. <br/>
<br/>
It is as a homeschool advocate that I now write you. I am currently <br/>
the Legislative Director of the National Home Education Network <br/>
(NHEN). NHEN was formed two years ago as a grassroots organization, <br/>
committed to celebrating the diversity of homeschoolers. In our <br/>
short life, we have grown to include thousands of homeschoolers in <br/>
our network and have been successful in showing the public the <br/>
diversity of homeschoolers, through numerous media articles. (one <br/>
included) Homeschoolers are indeed a diverse bunch, but the one thing <br/>
we all have in common is our commitment to assume responsibility for <br/>
our children&#39;s education. We know, from the successes we see in our <br/>
own families and those of our friends, that homeschooling really <br/>
works. So we cannot comprehend why the NEA would see the need to <br/>
adopt a resolution opposing homeschooling. (see copy attached)<br/>
<br/>
The resolution is well known in the homeschooling community and has <br/>
generated hard feelings among a population that is now numbering <br/>
between 1.5 and 2.5 million students, according to a recent <br/>
government survey. I am certain that an objective review of the <br/>
available evidence will reveal that NEA&#39;s categorical position cannot <br/>
be supported. I am enclosing with this letter a short list of <br/>
research articles that are available on the web; I would be pleased <br/>
to provide you with as much additional information as you would care <br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
When I saw you on television, I was convinced that with your common-<br/>
sense approach you would be able either to provide a coherent <br/>
explanation of the NEA&#39;s reasoning and motivation in adopting that <br/>
resolution, or to consider eliminating the resolution from your <br/>
platform the next time around.<br/>
<br/>
I would welcome a chance to meet with you by phone or in person to <br/>
discuss home education as it exists across the United States today. <br/>
I would like to hear your thoughts on the possibility of persuading <br/>
the NEA not to re-adopt that resolution another time, and what steps <br/>
homeschoolers might take to help persuade NEA.<br/>
<br/>
(It was signed by Nicky Hardenbergh, an NHEN board member)<br/>

***************************<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ms. Hardenbergh;<br/>
Thank you for your recent comments about my speech at the National Press<br/>
Club. I also appreciate the information on homeschooling and the National<br/>
Home Education Network.<br/>
The Association is very concerned about the education and well-being of all<br/>
children, and works to ensure that they are taught in an environment<br/>
conducive to effective learning. The NEA Representative Assembly, made up of<br/>
9,000 delegates who represent the 2.6 million members throughout the country,<br/>
is the Association&#39;s primary policy-making body. This body thoroughly<br/>
discusses and debates every proposed policy before voting to approve or<br/>
reject it.<br/>
During the 1988 RA, delegates approved the policy on homeschooling. They were<br/>
concerned that homeschooled students were not provided a comprehensive<br/>
education experience because they did not have an opportunity to interact<br/>
with students of different cultures, economic status, or learning styles. The<br/>
felt homeschooled students learned in a setting primarily made up [of] family<br/>
members and friends.<br/>
We know that parental involvement is imperative for school achievement, but<br/>
delegates were concerned that home schools were not required to use<br/>
state-approved curricula. The agreed that homeschooled students have done<br/>
well on national tests and were the top spellers in the National Spelling Bee<br/>
two years ago, but felt home school instruction should meet certain state<br/>
education standards.<br/>
These are some of the reasons delegates approved the 1988 resolution on<br/>
homeschooling, and reconfirmed their position at the 2000 annual meeting.<br/>
Members who want this policy reviewed my submit a proposal to the Resolutions<br/>
Committee for presentation at the RA.<br/>
Thank you again for your comments and the materials on homeschooling.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Bob Chase<br/>
President</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280092599">First, Pam, I want to know who those typos in the NEA&#39;s part of the <br/>
exchange belonged to?  If you transcribed the letter, than you&#39;re <br/>
absolved.  &lt;g&gt; But was it sent to NHEN like that?<br/>
<br/>
Second, I&#39;m curious about how the NEA feels about private school <br/>
students who don&#39;t used state curricula?<br/>
<br/>
I know that resolution, verbatim, has been renewed every year since I <br/>
started homeschooling.  You&#39;d think they had the time to at least <br/>
re-word it after 14 years!<br/>
