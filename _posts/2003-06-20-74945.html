<div id="ygrps-yiv-705130754">&quot;I disagree and so do a lot of experts on long term breastfeeding <br/>
and <br/>
natural weaning. I don&#39;t think any child who nurses less than about <br/>
2 <br/>
1/2 years naturally weans. Instead, the weaning involves a bunch of <br/>
factors, including mom working, the use of artificial nipples <br/>
(bottles <br/>
and/or pacifiers), people in the family saying the child is &quot;too <br/>
old&quot;, <br/>
etc. &#39;<br/>
<br/>
While I totally agree that toddlers nursing is natural and <br/>
desirable, I also believe that some will wean before 2.5 quite <br/>
happily on their own.<br/>
Out of four children, one weaned at 19 months and one at 2 y.o. <br/>
without anything but on demand feedings from birth.<br/>
With Jared (weaned at 19mos) I often wonder if I inadvertantly <br/>
sent &quot;weaning messages&quot; to him. I wasn&#39;t quite as aware then, but <br/>
with Sierra (weaned at 2) I was all too aware and she still weaned <br/>
herself. It was NOT a sudden thing (I would assume that is a nursing <br/>
strike), it was a slow and steady lessening of feedings and finally <br/>
only nursing morning and night.<br/>
She truly weaned herself, of that I have no doubt. Jared I&#39;m not <br/>
totally positive about, poor Trevor had weaning forced on him and <br/>
dear Jalen is nursing like mad at 2.5 y.o.!! I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll <br/>
ever lose interest. <br/>
I love nursing long term, but I sure would love to sleep all night. <br/>
ugh. He&#39;s very needy and intense, but oh-so-sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s perfectly natural for some children to wean before <br/>
2.5, but I imagine the messages sent to most mothers and children <br/>
make weaning happen before it would naturally, if we lived in a <br/>
society that wasn&#39;t so hung up on boobs.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of boobs, can you even imagine pumping milk from a cow to <br/>
bottle feed her baby!!! Sheesh. What IS the hang up with breasts in <br/>
this country?</div>

 </span></blockquote>I should have probably put in Social Factors in the list of why I think <br/>
weaning happens before humans would naturally wean.  Society factors <br/>
into our lives in so many ways, and I think sometimes unless we make a <br/>
huge effort to be aware of how it does effect us we really can&#39;t on a <br/>
conscious level go against it.  Children who are toddlers are supposed <br/>
to act a certain way, be independent, etc.  Even the way we nurse <br/>
newborns in this society is different then how people nurse newborns in <br/>
other societies.  In our society we are taught that babies should nurse <br/>
10-15 minutes on each side every 2-3 hours (IF they are lucky and dont&#39; <br/>
follow horrible advice to feed less or on a strict schedule.)  In other <br/>
societies where mommies hold babies all the time, the baby will nurse <br/>
1-2 minutes every 5 minutes.  Constantly.  Around the clock.  The mother <br/>
does not put the baby down.  If mother needs to do something, the baby <br/>
is in the sling right next to her.  Mothers don&#39;t worry about having a <br/>
few minutes to take a shower or cook dinner (most societies have <br/>
prohibitions against moms doing any chores or cooking in the first month <br/>
or two anyway, mom simply takes care of her personal needs and gets to <br/>
know her baby and nurses).  Our society wants our babies to sleep <br/>
through the night and even if a mother is aware that sleeping through <br/>
the night is not biologically good for the newborn, or even the older <br/>
baby, there is still the pressure as people say &quot;so how&#39;s the baby <br/>
sleeping?&quot;  Many new parents have rooms for their babies (even if they <br/>
end up sleeping with their child and not using the crib).  In some <br/>
cultures the idea that a mother would sleep in a different room or even <br/>
a few feet away from their baby, and that men find breasts sexy--those <br/>
ideas are foreign and laughable.  Some sociologists showed video clips <br/>
of women from the US taking care of their babies to women who were still <br/>
basically  hunters and gatherers and the mothers were appalled at how <br/>
the US mothers seemed to ignore the baby&#39;s cries and needs.  Even for <br/>
those of us who go against our society by unschooling our children or <br/>
nursing past a year are, cannot help but be, influenced by society.  <br/>
<br/>
Toddlers in the US are busy people.  I&#39;m often amazed at how busy.  If <br/>
there are older siblings they are even more busy.  There are various <br/>
classes, gymnastics, swimming, etc.  Babies and toddlers take mommy and <br/>
me swimming, gymnastics, etc. classes, and go to play groups, etc.  I <br/>
used to think, right before a vacation--great, we can spend lots of <br/>
quality time together, Janene (or Lexie) can nurse more.  But the <br/>
reality of the vacation was that we were so busy doing fun things, as a <br/>
family, that there didn&#39;t seem to be enough time to sit and cuddle and <br/>
nurse.  Even at night, it seemed we nursed less because we were so busy <br/>
and she was so tired that sleep came easily and quickly.  I think we can <br/>
get caught up in the go go go routine and forget that toddlers <br/>
especially need mommy sitting and still to cuzzle (our word for <br/>
nursing).  That is why I think often our children wean earlier--our <br/>
lives are busy.  This is not necessarily a bad thing--nursing for 18 <br/>
months, or two years is great in our society and while I do consider it <br/>
premature weaning, I also think it&#39;s a great thing, to have nursed that <br/>
long and provided milk and comfort to a child for that length of time.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think there are times when it is OK for a mom to encourage <br/>
breastfeeding to continue.  I lost a baby while Lexie was still nursing, <br/>
and I encouraged her to continue nursing after that loss.  She might <br/>
have weaned during Janene&#39;s pregnancy, but I realized that if I had also <br/>
lost Janene, it would have been even harder if Lexie had been weaned, so <br/>
I continued to encourage her to nurse, and with the promise of milk when <br/>
the baby was born, she was willing to nurse enough to keep up the skill <br/>
until Janene was born.  Then she was THRILLED with the wonderful new <br/>
milk supply and kept up for that reason!  <br/>
<br/>
One more thing, on Tandem nursing.  I did tandem nurse, and I&#39;ve given <br/>
talks on the subject, but I do not think it is normal for our species to <br/>
tandem nurse.  Our bodies are not made to nurse two children who are of <br/>
two different ages (it is normal to nurse twins or triplets).  The <br/>
normal way of things, biologically, is for moms to not ovulate until a <br/>
nursing baby is a year or so old (14 months is the average).  This <br/>
naturally spaces babies out.  Historically (or should I say <br/>
pre-historically) if a mom got pregnant while she still had a young baby <br/>
or toddler, she would not continue the pregnancy.  In others, the <br/>
toddler would be weaned.  It makes sense that if food is not plentiful <br/>
to take care of the baby which is alive first.  But in our society, food <br/>
is plentiful.  So we tandem nurse.  I don&#39;t think there is anything <br/>
wrong with it, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s our biological norm.  That said, <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do anything different.  It was good to tandem, good for me <br/>
and my daughters.  I am sad I am no longer lactating.  <br/>
<br/>
One last thing... I have spoken to many many women about breastfeeding. <br/>
 I have never heard a woman say they wish they would have weaned their <br/>
child earlier.  I have heard many women say that they wish they nursed <br/>
longer, especially those whose children nursed two or fewer years.  As <br/>
someone used to say--things that make you go hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
A great book to read on this subject is our babies ourselves.  Meridith <br/>
Small I think.  Excellent book.<br/>

<br/>
People DO say &quot;I wish I had taken my kids out of school sooner,&quot; and then &quot;I <br/>
wish I had unschooled sooner,&quot; but they don&#39;t say &quot;I wish I had stalled just a <br/>
FEW more years with structure before I unschooled.&quot;<br/>
