<div id="ygrps-yiv-485063185">first:  How do you deschool yourself?  I don&#39;t have access to any books<br/>
in English (though I did ask for the Teenage Liberation Handbook for<br/>
Christmas - my dad freaked at the title &lt;VBG&gt;), so I need live advice. <br/>
I trust my kids to take care of their own education.  I don&#39;t have a<br/>
problem with them.  Just with myself.  I&#39;ve found that unless my brain<br/>
gets a workout, I have a hard time getting to sleep - no matter how<br/>
exhausted my body is.  But whenever I try to do anything, nobody else is<br/>
there to care what I&#39;ve done, or tell me I&#39;ve done a good job (punished<br/>
by rewards?), so what&#39;s the point?  I mean, I know deep inside that I&#39;m<br/>
really doing this for myself, but there&#39;s also a probably bigger part of<br/>
me that wants someone to congratulate me for my effort.  Does anyone<br/>
else go through this?  How do you overcome it?<br/>
<br/>
second:  Mook is such a perfectionist.  DH is studying Russian at some<br/>
military intelligence school, and always has lots of homework and<br/>
studying to do.  So, Mook wants homework, too.  I&#39;ve printed out lots of<br/>
pictures for him to color (thank you, Stephanie, for all the URL&#39;s), but<br/>
if he doesn&#39;t color everything exactly right (like the professionals who<br/>
illustrate his books), he cries.  The kid is only two - almost three. <br/>
I&#39;ve told him before that he doesn&#39;t have any homework except the<br/>
homework he gives himself, and he doesn&#39;t even have to do that if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to.  I&#39;ve suggested free drawing - just giving him a blank<br/>
piece of paper, but then he gets upset that it doesn&#39;t look perfect.  He<br/>
throws a tantrum on paper (scribbling until the paper rips and he gets<br/>
crayon, pencil, pen, or marker, or whatever he&#39;s using all over the<br/>
table).  I&#39;ve tried distractions (&quot;let&#39;s go read together instead&quot;), but<br/>
then he tells me that if he doesn&#39;t do his homework, his teacher will be<br/>
angry.  I don&#39;t know where he got that from.  He has NEVER been to<br/>
school in his life.  How do I deal with this?  <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions will be helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427107481">Hey!  I just had an idea.  What about workbook pages.  Really easy ones.  I<br/>
have some great ones I could probably figure out how to scan in and send to<br/>
you?  I bought them from Timberdoodle, and they were very inexpensive.  But,<br/>
maybe I could send them to you?<br/>
