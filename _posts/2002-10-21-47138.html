<div id="ygrps-yiv-779443399">I read a child&#39;s book, It Takes a Village, about an African market and<br/>
everywhere the kids went they were treated beautiful by adults, everyone<br/>
knew each other, the kids were safe and secure. I have never read<br/>
Hillary&#39;s book but not all Demos are against Homeschooling.  The house<br/>
representative in my local district is a demo who thinks Homeschooling<br/>
is beautiful.  I just had to put my 2 cents in.  Lisa of MT<br/>
