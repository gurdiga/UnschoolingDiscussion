I haven&#39;t officialy introduced myself yet. I recently had to &quot;finish&quot; our <br/>
bedroom floor which was bare grey concrete in order to appease an appraiser. I <br/>
had less than a week to do it, so not enough time to lay the tile that&#39;s sitting <br/>
in the garage. Priced professionally coloring concrete and that was around <br/>
$1000 and out of the question. So, I rag painted it a beautiful subtle sea blue <br/>
w/paint I already had.  You just buy some painter&#39;s rags and some latex enamel <br/>
paint or even milk paint...dip the rag in being careful to not soak it and <br/>
wipe the floor in a circle or big swooping arks. Just rub it in and play w/it <br/>
until you get the look you&#39;re happy with. It&#39;s so easy..like cleaning the floor. <br/>
Then when you&#39;re finished let it sit a day or so to dry and then seal w/water <br/>
based sealer. I still have to seal ours and it&#39;s not wearing well (with four <br/>
big dogs and an active 5 1/2 yo) at all w/out sealer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
