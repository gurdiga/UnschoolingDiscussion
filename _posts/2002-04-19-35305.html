<div id="ygrps-yiv-492545248">Thank you to everyone who&#39;s answered my questions about my little person. <br/>
It&#39;s helpful to hear &quot;just let it go&quot; from people with older children and <br/>
more experience. He is an only grandchild to my parents and I think they <br/>
worry more about him than they did about me when I was little! :)<br/>
<br/>
Bonni mentioned reading -- yes, I think he&#39;s trying to teach himself to <br/>
read. He has memorized lots of books (mostly Dr. Seuss) and &quot;reads&quot; them to <br/>
himself moving his finger under the words. He&#39;s learned a lot of sight words <br/>
that way and likes to pick them out when he sees them on signs or on TV or <br/>
on the computer. I think he is trying to teach himself to sound things out <br/>
-- at least beginning sounds. He saw a violin on TV the other day, for <br/>
example, and turned to me and said, &quot;Violin! A violin ducka V!&quot; He uses the <br/>
word ducka when he doesn&#39;t know how to pronounce or say something. :) But he <br/>
does this with lots of words and tries to figure out the beginning sound and <br/>
what letter the word starts with from listening to it. He can sound out some <br/>
simple words like dog and cup etc. Every time we pull into the driveway he <br/>
says Duh-aaawwww-g! and points to the &quot;beware of&quot; sign. :)<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just paranoid about pushing him. I was even considering some <br/>
sort of alphabet detox for him -- but I&#39;m not going to do that I guess. He <br/>
knows all the letters and what sound they make (short vowel and hard <br/>
consonant). I think if his goal is to learn to read I&#39;ll help him do it... <br/>
one of his challenges right now is that he can &quot;read&quot; better than he can <br/>
pronounce.<br/>
<br/>
I had been working with him on learning his letters -- we were doing one a <br/>
week, but he got way way way ahead of me :) So I guess I felt a little <br/>
guilty that maybe I introduced him to this all too soon. I don&#39;t know why I <br/>
would think that -- at his age I was reading primers and sounding out words. <br/>
But I didn&#39;t have the same level of intensity and addiction that he has, <br/>
according to my parents.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for all the advice! I really appreciate it. I think this kid <br/>
is much smarter than either of his parents :) and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll continue <br/>
challenging me as he gets older... it&#39;s nice to have people to ask questions <br/>
and get opinions. :) He is a humbling experience.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
LILY<br/>
