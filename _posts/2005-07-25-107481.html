<br/>
Siblings without Rivalry (Faber and Mazlisch) is a great book with<br/>
lots of ideas for how to break up fighting.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I remember is that when one kid is about to hit anyone, she<br/>
suggests yelling, &quot;Quick - You to the other room and you to the<br/>
couch.&quot; Something like that. She says not to yell disapprovingly but<br/>
to defuse the situation by separating the kids and stopping the action.<br/>
<br/>
Worry about the sources of the anger after you&#39;ve stopped the<br/>
potential for harm.<br/>
<br/>
If the hitting is coming at you, I think you could do something<br/>
similar. Grab the hands of the child and walk that child to another<br/>
part of the room saying, &quot;Quick. Hands down. Stand here while you get<br/>
control of your body again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the response is &quot;flat&quot; (without anger or shock), the child will see<br/>
that you are taking control of his out of control feelings without<br/>
shaming him. If you repeat that over and over again, he will slowly<br/>
get the message that hitting isn&#39;t required to gain control of a<br/>
situation. He can turn to you instead and eventually will be able to<br/>
control himself.<br/>
<br/>
To deal with the emotions that led to the hitting, we try to get our<br/>
kids talking to each other with our help.<br/>
<br/>
We sit the two kids on the couch opposite each other. Then we ask each<br/>
kid to express what he or she is feeling to the other child. The other<br/>
child is to listen and then say back to the first child what he or she<br/>
expressed. We help them to do this as there is usually lots of<br/>
miscommunication.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal isn&#39;t to lecture or fix the problem. It is to allow the kids<br/>
to say what is really going on until there is some mutual<br/>
understanding. We also ask them to think of ways to avoid the problem<br/>
that might come up again in the future. If there is a lot of anger and<br/>
no movement, we sit quietly and wait. It has taken a long time sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
This process is one we&#39;ve used for fifteen years. My oldest kids now<br/>
(18 and 15) used to say how &quot;dumb&quot; it was to talk on the couch... yet<br/>
now they are the first to suggest it, even when we are out of sorts<br/>
with them or each other. One of the kids will say, &quot;Mom, you can&#39;t<br/>
keep going on with the day until you resolve things with X (child).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The point is that it takes loads of hours to patiently model and<br/>
support respectful disagreements. There are probably lots of ways to<br/>
do it too. But over time, if you care about it every time, they will<br/>
learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197786815">Sandra, I just wanted to add to my previous email. It was the use of<br/>
the word &quot;torture&quot; that got my back up. That&#39;s why I came off testy.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve done with our kids has had the opposite effect of torture.<br/>
Torture is the feeling of being victimized by the bigger, more<br/>
powerful person without recourse. What we are facilitating in our home<br/>
is the possibility of redress - that both parties can find a way to<br/>
get their point of view across and come to a reasonable alternative to<br/>
yelling, hitting, fighting, calling names or throwing things.<br/>
<br/>
That is not torture. That is compassionate communication.<br/>
<br/>
Miscommunication is common in all relationships so we, as the parents,<br/>
are a part of the process when the kids are learning how to say what<br/>
they need to say without their making it worse with abusive comments<br/>
or out of control emotions. We *help* them feel heard and express what<br/>
they want to say in such a way that it is heard and understood by the<br/>
other party. We explore solutions that make everyone feel considered<br/>
in the process. <br/>
<br/>
Is this not what you do when you are the &quot;third party&quot; to help sort<br/>
out the issues between your children?<br/>
<br/>
To me, coercion exists when someone uses their power abusively to hurt<br/>
or control another person, to intentionally bring pain.<br/>
<br/>
What happens in our family is that we have created the conditions for<br/>
healthy communication so that whoever feels victimized can have a way<br/>
to communicate with the other person without worry that he or she will<br/>
be unheard, further injured or dismissed.<br/>
<br/>
The result all these years later? A family who can be together on<br/>
vacation for 18 days 24/7 without conflict. Kids who know how to<br/>
express their hurts without insulting or damaging the other person.<br/>
Kids who are willing to hear someone else say &quot;You hurt me when you<br/>
said it that way.&quot; Parents who know that they are responsible to<br/>
apologize for abusing their power when that occurs. a family that<br/>
doesn&#39;t use hitting or violence to get their points across. Kids who<br/>
feel that they can hold each other and their parents accountable to<br/>
kinder, considerate communication.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-=-Who said anything about torture and coercion?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did.   I said &quot;seems to me&quot; which means to me &quot;seems.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe your kids don&#39;t get as angry as I&#39;ve seen mine.   For me to &quot;sit&quot; <br/>
(would be &quot;set&quot; and either way it&#39;s one person putting another person in a place) <br/>
my child on the same couch with the one he had just been physically accosting <br/>
would not, in the scenarios asked about or that I&#39;ve been describing, have been <br/>
easily possible, so it would have taken some coercion to pull it off.    <br/>
<br/>
What a child will express in such a situation might not be as honest as if he <br/>
can express himself while he&#39;s still angry and away from the other party.     <br/>
What he expresses while he&#39;s angry and in the absence of the other party can <br/>
be therapeutic and also helpful to the mom or other mediator.   What he <br/>
expresses while he&#39;s angry (which can be therapeutic and helpful) doesn&#39;t leave the <br/>
lasting sting on the other child.   The other child can hear it softened and <br/>
neutralized rather than in its harshest, crudest light and noise.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m too angry (I was talking about how I feel when I&#39;m angry, and not <br/>
jumping to conclusions) I don&#39;t want anyone else saying &quot;Sit right there, and <br/>
we&#39;re going to put [Keith or whoever else] on the other end of the couch now.   <br/>
Just stay there.   Trust me.&quot;   I might not want to be around the other person <br/>
for hours, and waiting hours for someone to calm down doesn&#39;t give him a <br/>
chance to express his frustration.<br/>
<br/>
If that works, placing children together and coaching and rephrasing and then <br/>
asking the other to say whatever he wants to say TO that person in front of <br/>
witnesses, then your children are not like mine in such situations, and I KNOW <br/>
it would cause more hurt than help with them to do it that way, so it is <br/>
possible that if those children in the original problem family are even more <br/>
volatile than mine (who don&#39;t hit me), then putting the two of them on a couch would <br/>
be coercion and also possibly dangerous.<br/>

<br/>
We haven&#39;t tried 18 days, but all three kids went with us yesterday to meet <br/>
another family whose oldest child was not yet &quot;schoolage&quot;, and Kirby went on <br/>
his own (he had been in a new-job orientation) and though he and Marty could&#39;ve <br/>
left early they stayed until we were all ready to go.   When we went on our <br/>
last road trip, people got along really well.   It was only eight days or so, <br/>
but it was in a van.)<br/>
<br/>
The arguments I&#39;ve written about weren&#39;t frequent.   MAYBE once in two months <br/>
in the busy season and once in six months or a year as they got older.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Kids who are willing to hear someone else say &quot;You hurt me when you<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s useful, but the hurtful phrases are still inside us and I like to try <br/>
to avoid them entirely if possible.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We have that, but we don&#39;t have formalized meetings where the two have to be <br/>
together on the same furniture.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith said something kinda snippy to me one night and I just stood up and <br/>
quietly left the place, but I heard Holly behind me say &quot;That was mean,&quot; and I&#39;m <br/>
sure they discussed it and I&#39;m sure Keith won&#39;t do that again, but I didn&#39;t <br/>
need to hear any more than I had already heard. He was cranky and I didn&#39;t want <br/>
the brunt of it.<br/>

<br/>
The principle in our house has been that if you are nasty with<br/>
someone, you are accountable for it.<br/>
<br/>
If a family member uses his or her power (verbal, physical or psychic)<br/>
to control or hurt someone else, that kid or parent can&#39;t just go on<br/>
as though it didn&#39;t happen; he or she can&#39;t simply use &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>
to talk about it right now&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m too angry to talk to you&quot; as a way<br/>
to continue the abuse or avoid the impact of his or her meanness.<br/>
<br/>
If the victim isn&#39;t interested in resolving at that time (needs space<br/>
to recover), that&#39;s different. That person can take some time to<br/>
regroup. Then we address it when the victim is ready.<br/>
<br/>
If both are being cruel, we stop the fighting and then help everyone<br/>
say what needs to be said in a kinder, more useful manner.<br/>
<br/>
But if the one being cruel powers-over to get the computer or X Box<br/>
and then doesn&#39;t want to deal with the hurt he or she caused but wants<br/>
to go right ahead with the X box or whatever, that isn&#39;t okay.<br/>
<br/>
We talk first.<br/>
<br/>
The couch is just a piece of furniture. It&#39;s not &quot;formalized,&quot; it&#39;s<br/>
just handy. We have seven people. Sometimes sitting down helps to<br/>
lower the tone of the arguing. Standing can add to the sense of one<br/>
being bigger than the other. Sitting equalizes. We sometimes suggest<br/>
breathing before talking too.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that my oldest (18) almost always takes big deep breaths now<br/>
on his own when he and his sister tangle before he addresses what she<br/>
said that hurt/angered him. I find that interesting.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve noticed is that in many families, kids say mean things to<br/>
each other and the parents just issue a &quot;don&#39;t you dare say that to<br/>
your brother&quot; kind of comment. That does nothing to hold the abusive<br/>
child accountable nor does it aid the victim in voicing his or her own<br/>
anger or perspective. Having to stay with the impact of your beahvior<br/>
is what helps someone to change in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Walking out on abusive speech is a good way to handle it immediately.<br/>
But if you are in the middle of your computer turn, it sure doesn&#39;t<br/>
work. You lose your turn as you leave and the mean one gets the<br/>
control he wanted. So it depends on whether or not walking out is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, we just almost never have these issues any more. We&#39;ve been<br/>
consistent in stopping cruelty between family members for over fifteen<br/>
years. And when something comes up now, I hear the victim say things<br/>
like, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ll give you a turn but you don&#39;t have to raise your<br/>
voice&quot; or &quot;You can&#39;t talk to me like that. Tell me what you want<br/>
without being mean.&quot; And those things actually work because the kids<br/>
are used to working their stuff out with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal has been to empower the victim and to hold the abuser<br/>
accountable. That&#39;s it.<br/>

a break, because he tends to be so hard on himself and the pain and<br/>

the world goes on and his favorite things are still there and people<br/>
still love him.  <br/>
<br/>
So the time that we usually talk about those things is when we&#39;re<br/>
snuggled up in his bed before he goes to sleep, while I&#39;m scratching<br/>
his back.  That&#39;s our really safe time to talk about all sorts of<br/>
things.  So after he tells me his favorite Dragonball character and<br/>
what his score is on Megaman, I say, &quot;We still need to talk about<br/>
something.&quot;  That&#39;s the time that he&#39;s very responsive and open to<br/>
listening, and it can just be a loving discussion of the facts (what<br/>
happened) and the options (what could we do differently).<br/>
<br/>
And I often do what Karen and Sandra were talking about -- change the<br/>
environment -- based on what we come up with during that talk.  Or I<br/>
make a plan about how I&#39;m going to engage a bit differently.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that the words &quot;peaceful parenting&quot; became an issue in the<br/>
previous discussion, because all that forethought and attention to<br/>
factors outside of the actual incident between kids, all that *action*<br/>
but not *reaction* -- that *is* what I think of as peaceful parenting.<br/>
 Not just the talk -- heck, my 2 y.o. doesn&#39;t talk yet and as I said,<br/>
my 8 y.o. sometimes can&#39;t verbalize.  But seeing the whole picture,<br/>
and seeing the world through my children&#39;s eyes, so I can create a<br/>
space for them that leads to more peaceful living -- all that, to me,<br/>
is peaceful parenting.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Often such meanness is a response to stimuli.   How can you co clearly know <br/>
who is the victim and who is the &quot;accountable&quot; ONE?   <br/>
<br/>
What if all rape victims had to report and discuss their rape with the <br/>
victim, sitting on the same couch?   YES, that&#39;s an extreme example.   But there&#39;s a <br/>
scale of seriousness, and from my point of view it&#39;s not always apparent who <br/>
(if either) &quot;did the damage&quot; but it is possible for further   damage to <br/>
potentially be done in the &quot;settling&quot; of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-he or she can&#39;t simply use &quot;I don&#39;t want<br/>

to continue the abuse or avoid the impact of his or her meanness.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
If someone was angry enough to be hurtful, she needs to let the anger <br/>
dissipate or the potential danger remains.     So you do seem to be suggesting that <br/>
it&#39;s okay for a person &quot;to be held accountable&quot; before he calms down.   That <br/>
has got to involve coercion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The couch is just a piece of furniture. It&#39;s not &quot;formalized,&quot; it&#39;s<br/>
just handy. We have seven people. Sometimes sitting down helps to<br/>
lower the tone of the arguing. Standing can add to the sense of one<br/>
being bigger than the other. Sitting equalizes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t want to sit but is required to sit, that is not <br/>
equalizing.   The requirer is bigger then the one who is now, against his or her <br/>
wishes, sitting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I noticed that my oldest (18) almost always takes big deep breaths now<br/>
on his own when he and his sister tangle before he addresses what she<br/>
said that hurt/angered him. I find that interesting.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Kirby got that tool down well by the time he was six.   He and the other kids <br/>
will remind each other to breathe if they&#39;re frustrated or scared or <br/>
overwhelmed.   They will remind me or Keith to breathe.   They will remind visiting <br/>
friends to breathe, if they seem to be having a hard time with a project, move, <br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
What I&#39;ve noticed is that in many families, kids say mean things to<br/>
each other and the parents just issue a &quot;don&#39;t you dare say that to<br/>
your brother&quot; kind of comment.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s helpful either.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Having to stay with the impact of your beahvior<br/>
is what helps someone to change in the future.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Having to stay&quot; where?   Being made to stay by whom?<br/>
<br/>
What helps someone change is awareness and desire to do better.   Staying <br/>
doesn&#39;t create change.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Walking out on abusive speech is a good way to handle it immediately.<br/>
But if you are in the middle of your computer turn, it sure doesn&#39;t<br/>
work. You lose your turn as you leave and the mean one gets the<br/>
control he wanted. So it depends on whether or not walking out is helpful.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t apply to anything at our house.   Leaving the computer (or food <br/>
or a movie or a good seat on the couch) because of a disagreement wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
the same as leaving because one was going to do something else.   No one in <br/>
this family would say &quot;you left, so I took it&quot; if a person left to get adult <br/>
assistance or left to calm down.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Frankly, we just almost never have these issues any more.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We never had many of them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Our goal has been to empower the victim and to hold the abuser<br/>
accountable. That&#39;s it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never had abusers.   We&#39;ve had people whose situations got out of <br/>
control, and every time they had new tools and experiences to help keep it from <br/>
getting there again.     And they&#39;re able to help others with those tools as <br/>
well.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have almost never had an instance of one being mean and the other being a <br/>
victim.   It starts small and gets worse.   When it doesn&#39;t get worse, it&#39;s <br/>
not a problem.   Only the exchange that the kids can&#39;t handle on their own are <br/>
&quot;incidents,&quot; and by the time they&#39;re incidents that need mediation, probably <br/>
both have contributed to the problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t the goal to learn how to curb that raging and crying so that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t spill over onto others?-=-<br/>
<br/>
The goal is not to get to a raging and crying stage at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Not all kids are hard on themselves after being mean. Sometimes they<br/>
cathart by raging and then think others are being unreasonable for<br/>
reacting badly.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the question of &quot;being mean&quot; (which I still am not clear on in <br/>
your writing on this topic), sometimes the person who goes into a rage or cries <br/>
*IS* the victim.    Sometimes the person who stabs another person WAS the <br/>
victim, up to that point, of violence, bullying, attempted rape, mortal insult, and <br/>
the stabbing was a reasonable response under the circumstances.   Sometimes a <br/>
person who gets really violent or destructive does so after just one too many <br/>
adults ignored the fact that he/she was being bullied and belittled and <br/>
tweaked over and over and over by people who never did any overt photographable <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
None of this applies to my kids because they have since they were little had <br/>
lots of ideas (naturally occurring and developed after conversations) for <br/>
defusing situations and distracting irritated others and backtracking when they <br/>
saw they were being irritating and needed to back off.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They benefit from learning how to interact with each other<br/>
even when we&#39;re not present.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not present, will one of them &quot;sit&quot; two others down on the couch <br/>
and have them take turns addressing one another until everyone&#39;s happy? <br/>
<br/>
If I call the police on my neighbors behind, I don&#39;t want the police to set <br/>
us both down on the same porch and take turns telling the other what we&#39;d like <br/>
to see happen in the future, and I don&#39;t want to tell him how hearing him <br/>
threaten his wife made me *feeeel.*   I want the police to know I didn&#39;t call <br/>
until it got bad and that I shouldn&#39;t even be a factor in that guy&#39;s following the <br/>
law.   <br/>

person who got hurt has a need to talk directly to the person who hurt<br/>
him, *then* I would make sure that can happen in a way that doesn&#39;t<br/>
escalate the situation.<br/>
<br/>
I give feedback to other family members all the time about the impact<br/>
of their words and actions, to the degree that they can hear it<br/>
(depending how emotional or distracted they are in the moment).  Not<br/>
just as follow-up to an argument -- as part of life.  &quot;That was cool<br/>

like it if you were holding my hands when I didn&#39;t want them held.&quot; <br/>
&quot;I can see you getting frustrated.  Would a couple of breaths help?&quot; <br/>
And so on.  The rest of my family does this as well.  That&#39;s how we<br/>
meet the need of each of us to have feedback and information about how<br/>
our words and actions are affecting others.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, the concepts of &quot;abuser&quot; and &quot;victim&quot; just don&#39;t really<br/>
register on my radar.  It&#39;s more about meeting needs and giving<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
==I find it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just as important to offer support to the child on the receiving end.==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and I certainly wasn&#39;t saying that I was taking sides or giving<br/>
more attention to one or the other.  I split my time between those in<br/>
need.<br/>
<br/>
==That may mean that the one being mean has to listen or stay put long<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is where the parent, who is already present, can help<br/>
create a safe space for the child who is melting down, so it&#39;s not an<br/>
imposition on others.<br/>
<br/>
== Isn&#39;t the goal to learn how to curb that raging and crying so that it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doesn&#39;t spill over onto others?==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My goal is not to &quot;curb&quot; it if that means repression or oppression. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean.  My son&#39;s crying doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else<br/>
-- if it&#39;s too loud, we leave or he leaves the room, so he can have a<br/>
good cry in peace. If he&#39;s throwing himself around, again, I can keep<br/>
everyone safe -- some cushions near him and the rest of us in a safe<br/>
place. <br/>
<br/>
My goal is to give tools for self-awareness and social awareness, to<br/>
accept the need for crying as part of healing and learning, and to<br/>
create a peaceful space overall so that there aren&#39;t unnecessary<br/>
meltdowns and bickering and fighting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
== Not all kids are hard on themselves after being mean.==<br/>
<br/>
No, but I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that some -- many -- are,<br/>
especially after their side of the story has been heard and understood.<br/>
<br/>
== Sometimes they<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cathart by raging and then think others are being unreasonable for<br/>
&gt; reacting badly.==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  Yes, kids need to rage sometimes<br/>
(otherwise known as a &quot;tantrum&quot; or a meltdown) to release tension.  As<br/>
a parent, I can give them a safe space to do so, where it doesn&#39;t<br/>
affect others.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s human nature to see only your own side of things when you<br/>
are upset (&quot;thinking others are being unreasonable&quot;) and that is<br/>
coming out of real pain and feeling misunderstood and not heard.  I<br/>
prefer to show some understanding while still giving feedback and<br/>
information about the effect on others (and this is where some finesse<br/>
comes in, giving information when it can best be heard), rather than<br/>
blaming the child for feeling his emotions.  <br/>
<br/>
As a general rule, I think kids who are respected and have access to<br/>
good information about self-awareness and social awareness grow out of<br/>
the meltdowns and rages -- brain development and emotional maturity<br/>
catch up when they&#39;re ready, much like reading and the other things we<br/>
talk about in unschooling do.  I don&#39;t see it as something that needs<br/>
to be curbed as much as worked with and worked through.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648240854">I have a hunch we&#39;re talking about different situations.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about a melt down or a tantrum. I&#39;m talking about one<br/>
kid being inconsiderate or using his size or age to power-over the<br/>
other kid. I&#39;m talking about those rude interchanges where someone<br/>
uses name-calling or grabs the remote without asking or yells to get<br/>
his way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s in these instances that I think it&#39;s important for the parents to<br/>
support better communication. We do that by bringing them together to<br/>
talk (and we happen to use our couch to do that).<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has said that asking them to sit on the couch to talk it out is<br/>
coercive. She does not think it coercive to tell kids to breathe,<br/>
however. (I hate it when my husband reminds me to breathe when we&#39;re<br/>
fighting, for instance. But I don&#39;t mind it at all if he suggests we<br/>
stop what we&#39;re doing to sit down and discuss the issue more<br/>
rationally. These are just differences.)<br/>
<br/>
It feels coercive to be in a conflict that demeans you or prevents you<br/>
from expressing your viewpoint. That&#39;s what I want to help my kids<br/>
work through.<br/>
<br/>
As parents, we have explained to our kids that when there is a<br/>
conflict, we will help them to talk to each other civilly until<br/>
everyone feels heard and a solution agreeable to all has been reached.<br/>
They know this before anyone has a conflict. <br/>
<br/>
The end result has been that our kids know how to work out their<br/>
problems with each other, they know they will have support when they<br/>
run out of ideas for how to get their point across and they won&#39;t<br/>
settle for less than clear communication and respectful speech between<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still scratching my head about why this suggestion is being<br/>
described as torture or coercion.<br/>
<br/>
But so be it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got to get back to work, so I&#39;ll have to let it go for now.<br/>

&gt; Again, the concepts of &quot;abuser&quot; and &quot;victim&quot; just don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt; register on my radar.  It&#39;s more about meeting needs and giving<br/>
&gt; information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ==I find it<br/>
&gt; &gt; just as important to offer support to the child on the receiving<br/>
 </span></blockquote>end.==<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, and I certainly wasn&#39;t saying that I was taking sides or giving<br/>
&gt; more attention to one or the other.  I split my time between those in<br/>
&gt; need.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ==That may mean that the one being mean has to listen or stay put long<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to hear from the person who was hurt by the one raging.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; His rage and anger is an imposition. Sometimes hearing the person who<br/>
&gt; &gt; was hurt is an imposition on him.==<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think this is where the parent, who is already present, can help<br/>
&gt; create a safe space for the child who is melting down, so it&#39;s not an<br/>
&gt; imposition on others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; == Isn&#39;t the goal to learn how to curb that raging and crying so that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t spill over onto others?==<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My goal is not to &quot;curb&quot; it if that means repression or oppression. <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean.  My son&#39;s crying doesn&#39;t hurt anyone else<br/>
&gt; -- if it&#39;s too loud, we leave or he leaves the room, so he can have a<br/>
&gt; good cry in peace. If he&#39;s throwing himself around, again, I can keep<br/>
&gt; everyone safe -- some cushions near him and the rest of us in a safe<br/>
&gt; place. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My goal is to give tools for self-awareness and social awareness, to<br/>
&gt; accept the need for crying as part of healing and learning, and to<br/>
&gt; create a peaceful space overall so that there aren&#39;t unnecessary<br/>
&gt; meltdowns and bickering and fighting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; == Not all kids are hard on themselves after being mean.==<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, but I think it&#39;s worth pointing out that some -- many -- are,<br/>
&gt; especially after their side of the story has been heard and understood.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; == Sometimes they<br/>
&gt; &gt; cathart by raging and then think others are being unreasonable for<br/>
&gt; &gt; reacting badly.==<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure what you mean here.  Yes, kids need to rage sometimes<br/>
&gt; (otherwise known as a &quot;tantrum&quot; or a meltdown) to release tension.  As<br/>
&gt; a parent, I can give them a safe space to do so, where it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; affect others.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it&#39;s human nature to see only your own side of things when you<br/>
&gt; are upset (&quot;thinking others are being unreasonable&quot;) and that is<br/>
&gt; coming out of real pain and feeling misunderstood and not heard.  I<br/>
&gt; prefer to show some understanding while still giving feedback and<br/>
&gt; information about the effect on others (and this is where some finesse<br/>
&gt; comes in, giving information when it can best be heard), rather than<br/>
&gt; blaming the child for feeling his emotions.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a general rule, I think kids who are respected and have access to<br/>
&gt; good information about self-awareness and social awareness grow out of<br/>
&gt; the meltdowns and rages -- brain development and emotional maturity<br/>
&gt; catch up when they&#39;re ready, much like reading and the other things we<br/>
&gt; talk about in unschooling do.  I don&#39;t see it as something that needs<br/>
&gt; to be curbed as much as worked with and worked through.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>

emotions better than he liked the feeling of raging, and though he was VERY <br/>
quick to melt and lost it when he was younger, help from me and his dad to learn <br/>
to breathe deeply and slowly and to remember what he needed and wanted to do <br/>
(which was not to tear things up or hurt people) and also karate (learning <br/>
physical control in similar and other ways) have resulted in one of the calmest <br/>
and most collected people I know.   I know how he was, and I know how he is.   <br/>
He&#39;s had the need to calm strangers down before and has done it with humor <br/>
strength of character and eye contact.   He&#39;s never lain a hand on another person <br/>
in those situations.   In one, the guy was laying hands on Kirby and Kirby <br/>
just dodged and turned casually until the touching was gone.   He didn&#39;t have to <br/>
lift his arm a bit, and the person (a weirdo who had come to the store where <br/>
he was working, wanting money--not a robbery, a beggary &lt;g&gt;) didn&#39;t feel <br/>
embarrassed or chased off, but treated with dignity.   Many others (including his <br/>
karate teacher) said &quot;you should&#39;ve done THIS and THAT&quot; (physical responses), <br/>
but Kirby was happier with his quiet send-off.<br/>

&gt; his way.==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking more about this, so I thought I&#39;d think &quot;out loud&quot; here<br/>
and see what happens.  <br/>
<br/>
This really isn&#39;t about Julie&#39;s process for resolving conflict -- it<br/>
sounds like that&#39;s worked for you (though I think others on the list<br/>
need be careful about adopting this method in a way that forces kids<br/>
to &quot;work it out or else,&quot; or &quot;apologize or else,&quot; or that sort of thing).<br/>
<br/>
So -- there are meltdowns that are angry in nature (there are sobbing<br/>
sad ones, too, but originally I was referring to an angry meltdown<br/>
situation).  Sometimes they&#39;re turned inward or turned towards a bed<br/>
or a pillow -- sometimes they&#39;re turned outward toward another person.<br/>
 Meltdowns tend to be an out-of-control explosion.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the kind of hitting/meanness that seems more calculated<br/>
-- &quot;I want this and I&#39;m bigger and so I&#39;ll take it.&quot;  Or &quot;You didn&#39;t<br/>
give me what I wanted so I&#39;ll hurt you.&quot;  But even in those<br/>
situations, in my experience, there is a bit of an explosion, an<br/>
inability in the moment to think of what *else* to do, or to see<br/>
another solution as more beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
The original poster said her son punched her for 15 minutes.  The way<br/>
I saw the interaction taking place, he was<br/>
out-of-control/meltdown/raging angry.  I think it&#39;s useful to try to<br/>
understand that.<br/>
<br/>
To me, there are only limited differences between having an angry<br/>
meltdown and having an angry meltdown where you try to hurt others. <br/>
The big difference is that somebody needs to keep the others safe<br/>
during this time, and get the angry person to a place where he/she<br/>
can&#39;t hurt others.<br/>
<br/>
But past that, there is still the anger to deal with -- that&#39;s the<br/>
biggest part of the problem.  So here are some thoughts about anger.  <br/>
<br/>
One definition I&#39;ve heard:  anger actually stems from helplessness --<br/>
it&#39;s a way to feel powerful when one actually feels very<br/>
out-of-control and powerless under the surface.  Fear and sadness are<br/>
also often a big part of anger.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to think of it -- anger is a way to make yourself big and<br/>
scary when there&#39;s a dispute over limited resources.  Not usually a<br/>
great solution for living in civilization, but it works very well in<br/>
nature, and the fact that it remains with us speaks for its<br/>
evolutionary usefulness.<br/>
<br/>
Something else I&#39;ve heard about anger -- when we are infants,<br/>
screaming and crying are the main tools we have to get our needs heard<br/>
and met.  When things go poorly and our brains shut down, that&#39;s what<br/>
we revert to.<br/>
<br/>
Adrenaline is a big part of an anger reaction -- the &quot;fight or flight&quot;<br/>
reaction is a very difficult one to reason ourselves out of once it<br/>
hits.  In addition to giving us quick reactions and additional<br/>
strength, adrenaline gives us &quot;tunnel vision&quot; -- we are only able to<br/>
think about, or even see, one or maybe two variables at a moment (as<br/>
opposed to when our conscious minds function normally, and we can<br/>
juggle 5-7 variables in a situation).<br/>
<br/>
I hope it doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m just philosophizing (in a non-helpful<br/>
way) about anger.  I have collected these tidbits about anger because<br/>
it has played a big part in my own life.  It is only in the past few<br/>
years that I can consistently count on myself to act the way I want<br/>
to, even when &quot;driven to anger.&quot;  Knowing these things about anger<br/>
have helped my own self-awareness, which led to much more peaceful<br/>
behavior on my part. <br/>
<br/>
Because of my own past, my focus with my children has been to address<br/>
the underlying issues of anger, and not to focus as much on their<br/>
behavior as &quot;inappropriate&quot; or &quot;unacceptable,&quot; or on them as<br/>
&quot;abusers.&quot;  Anger is a difficult emotion to feel, and then when others<br/>
think that one is a freak or an abuser for feeling a lot of anger, or<br/>
for feeling it very intensely -- that makes it that much more difficult.  <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m still not saying that it&#39;s okay for anyone to be abused, and if<br/>
someone does get hurt, that hurt needs to be dealt with just as much<br/>
as the other person&#39;s anger.  I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s helpful to<br/>
put the main focus on the hitting or other abuse, at least in my<br/>
situation.)<br/>
<br/>
So I think that knowing and understanding something about what anger<br/>
is can be very helpful for a parent&#39;s relationship with their kids and<br/>
for helping a child with their own self-awareness.  It&#39;s normal to get<br/>
angry when you don&#39;t get your way.  Our brains are set up so that we<br/>
need to work a little harder at problem-solving and win/win situations<br/>
-- these aren&#39;t always our first responses.  We can work past that,<br/>
but we can also have have some understanding and tenderness toward our<br/>
kids&#39; anger (and our own).<br/>
<br/>
I also think that knowing how narrowly focused the brain gets when<br/>
angry does highlight the need for giving information.  People get very<br/>
self-absorbed when they&#39;re feeling angry and needy.  As well as<br/>
dealing with the needs themselves, when the child is in a better frame<br/>
of mind, the parent can point out things that the child may not have<br/>
considered.  &quot;It&#39;s not fun for me when you&#39;re fighting at the grocery<br/>
store.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But all that information often can&#39;t be heard if the a person is still<br/>
in angry mode or &quot;fight or flight&quot; mode -- adrenaline doesn&#39;t make<br/>
enough room in the brain for any more information or talking at that<br/>
point.  That information tends to be more helpful before a situation<br/>
arises, with some forethought as to what might arise before it does. <br/>
It&#39;s also more helpful afterwards, when the child is calm and has a<br/>
chance to re-think the situation.<br/>
<br/>
(Of course, giving information in a direct, condensed form in the<br/>
middle of an angry situation can sometimes help the person re-focus. <br/>
&quot;That hurts, so stop.&quot;  &quot;Your voice is hurting my ears.&quot;  &quot;If you<br/>
throw that it will break, and you won&#39;t have it anymore.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
At my house, we do have a word for that before-and-after talking and<br/>
thinking -- we call that processing.  Or briefing and de-briefing --<br/>
I&#39;ve heard it called that, too.<br/>
<br/>
There was some talk about the word, &quot;processing,&quot; on the list, too,<br/>
with some unpleasant examples/associations of the word -- all true.  I<br/>
do have another view.  <br/>
<br/>
Processing is also what a computer does to information, breaking it<br/>
down into binary information that it can work with.  We process grain<br/>
in a mill and then in an oven -- breaking it apart, taking out the<br/>
hard unhelpful parts, and cooking it with other things so that our<br/>
bodies can swallow and digest it.  <br/>
<br/>
Digestion itself is a process, and through it our cells get the fuel<br/>
and nutrients in a form they can use them -- and our bodies get rid of<br/>
the crap we don&#39;t need in the same process.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to process people, but I think processing ideas and<br/>
emotions and one&#39;s understanding of a situation can be pretty useful.<br/>
 I usually need to do it quite a bit, for my own peace and<br/>
understanding.  <br/>
<br/>
I just would never force anyone else to join me in the process or to<br/>
go through it themselves if they weren&#39;t ready.  That causes stress,<br/>
and as we all know, stress doesn&#39;t aid digestion -- of food or ideas<br/>
-- well at all.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s part of how we helped Kirby get past his native and normal childhood <br/>
reactions.   He is truly a VERY calm and calming person now at 19, and it <br/>
started out with &quot;just philosophy,&quot; and understanding that he was likely to become <br/>
angry quickly, and helping him find ways to avert that.   <br/>
<br/>
It seems some people want to let people be the way they are regardless of the <br/>
effect on others, but I doubt many people really want to be anti-social to <br/>
the extent that they would have a hard time keeping friends, roommates, wives, <br/>
freedom...    We could&#39;ve encouraged Kirby to destroy property and to rave and <br/>
roar, but we helped him breathe and think and decide what would be most useful <br/>
and appropriate in various situations.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m responding to myself here &lt;g&gt;, but if as I look more at the<br/>
adrenaline reaction with anger, that really does give a *lot* of<br/>
useful information about how to help someone who is approaching this<br/>
reaction or is in the middle of it.  <br/>
<br/>
--Breathing deeply helps our cells get oxygen and flush out the<br/>
chemicals (hormones) associated with an adrenaline reaction.<br/>
--Drinking liquids helps the cells flush out the adrenaline itself.<br/>
--Eating protein helps the conscious, problem-solving part of the<br/>
brain wake up and start working again.<br/>
--Sleep restores our ability to make judgements and problem-solve as well.<br/>
--Changing the environment ---removing the thing that the angry person<br/>
is fixated on helps relieve the tunnel vision problem.<br/>
--Trying humor or something pleasantly surprising can get the<br/>
conscious mind working again and over-ride the anger response.<br/>
--Giving needed information in a quick, calm and direct form has the<br/>
best hope of getting through.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as what not to do:<br/>
<br/>
--Physical restraint of any kind does somewhat heighten the &quot;fight or<br/>
flight&quot; response.  In this mode, the angry person trying to beat down<br/>
resistance -- even someone holding up their hands to ward off our<br/>
blows.  If we feel a physical resistance of any kind, that&#39;s a signal<br/>
to the body that we need *more* adrenaline, and to fight harder.  <br/>
<br/>
(As I think about it, that may explain why Sheila had to hold her<br/>
hands up for 15 minutes -- a really long time -- to protect herself<br/>
against her son.  She needed a different strategy that didn&#39;t send a<br/>
signal for *more* adrenaline.)  <br/>
<br/>
I think there are times we have to physically intervene, and it&#39;s<br/>
better than nothing if someone&#39;s going to get hurt, but it makes sense<br/>
why it needs to be a last-ditch effort.<br/>
<br/>
--Excessive talking just increases the fear and confusion -- lots of<br/>
information and my poor little monkey brain (at the moment of anger)<br/>
can only focus on one thing.  At best, lots of talking is useless --<br/>
at worst, it&#39;s confusing and adds stress.  <br/>
<br/>
--Yelling in a threatening tone just increases the adrenaline<br/>
response.  Adding anything to the environment that would be perceived<br/>
as a threat or that causes pain may only add to the response.<br/>
<br/>
--Sensing fear in others might add to the adrenaline response, much<br/>
like in dogs and horses, I think.  The over-focused brain picks up on<br/>
the fear and figures that it might mean another threat -- &quot;maybe I<br/>
should be afraid, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We talk about these things a lot on the list -- I just like having an<br/>
organizing concept that ties them all together like this.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
been one of those people that needs to know why.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe others can add things or offer other considerations to this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hesitant to send this because it might be too obvious and<br/>
spelled-out, but it might help others to put it all together, too.<br/>

Humor and distraction is definitely somethig we do alot here.  When I<br/>

prevents a disaster.  Like, with the pool problem, I&#39;d start one of<br/>
these games while staying in the pool and keep playing until probably<br/>
one or the other child (or both) determined that either they didn&#39;t<br/>

in the grocery store, or standing in line - all kind of places. <br/>
Anyone else use games like this? and if so, what other types of games<br/>
do you use where you don&#39;t need pencil and paper of anything - just<br/>
yourselves?<br/>
Another thing in the grocery store type of problem is maybe I&#39;d tickle<br/>
the child doing the bothering of the other child, or stick my toungue<br/>
out at him in a humorous way - it&#39;s not a mean thing and it often gets<br/>
the kids laughing when they see me do stuff like this and it lightens<br/>
the mood.<br/>

<h4>Quinlon&#39;s Mommy</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980387566">When I was in college I learned, when confronted by<br/>
someone who was angry, to lower my voice, offer them<br/>
water, and listen as we walked. If the person is old<br/>
enough offering them gum was also a good trick.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the people I dealt with back then were 3yrs<br/>
and younger, but when I graduated and started working<br/>
more in board rooms than play grounds I found these<br/>
methods to work just as well.<br/>
<br/>
Of course now that I&#39;m home with my kids I generally<br/>
try humor as a first method to counter anger (mine and<br/>
theirs)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a policy to allow anyone who wants one a<br/>
place and time to cool off. I usually go into the<br/>
bathroom or in the backyard. My 3 yr old like to go<br/>
into the bedroom and bounce on the big bed and throw<br/>
pillows, my one year old likes to go &quot;shopping&quot; at her<br/>
stuffed animal bookshelf &quot;store&quot; and my DH usually<br/>
goes to the gas station or somewhere else kinda quick<br/>
but away.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are times when growing likes to shake up<br/>
our hormones and talking about anger and rage when in<br/>
a calm relaxed environment helps to diffuse it,<br/>
understand it, and plan for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-499528757">Amy, your posts on anger couldn&#39;t be more timely for me! I printed<br/>
them out, and plan on leaving them around so DH will find them.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, Gabe (almost 9) has been getting angry a lot, mostly at his<br/>
dad and his friends. Amy&#39;s post is helping me think more carefully<br/>
about why. I had some vague ideas before about what was bothering him<br/>
(in general, rather than the triggers for each specific meltdown), but<br/>
I know that I need to be much more focused on what&#39;s going on, so that<br/>
I can be more proactive, and try to help him avoid these episodes as<br/>
much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
In one month, we&#39;ll be moving halfway across the country, so, no<br/>
surprise, I think that&#39;s a big contributor to the stress that Gabe&#39;s<br/>
feeling. <br/>
<br/>
But I think the things that set him off are also important. With his<br/>
friends, he&#39;s been feeling lately that he is much more generous with<br/>
them than they are with him. We live in a complex with lots of kids,<br/>
so he never really has any down time unless I make him come inside. He<br/>
always wants to bring popsicles and other food and drinks outside to<br/>
share, but rarely would the other kids do so. (I have a feeling that<br/>
it is partly because their parents can&#39;t or won&#39;t buy them enough, so<br/>
they feel like they have to hoard what they have...) Eventually we<br/>
suggested that he not offer things, because the lack of reciprocity<br/>
was making him feel bad, and none of our compliments about his<br/>
generosity made him feel any better. <br/>
<br/>
another big factor, and the one I have the hardest time with, is his<br/>
dad&#39;s attitude about respectful parenting. We&#39;ve (I should say &quot;I&#39;ve&quot;)<br/>
been doing this more thoughtfully for less than a year, and DH&#39;s<br/>
&quot;paradigm shift&quot; regarding parenting is a bit behind mine. He&#39;s still<br/>
too authoritative too often, and DS is not having it. Gabe is very<br/>
sure of himself, and he fights back. I do intervene, and I&#39;m getting<br/>
better at doing so in a way that defends DS while not pitting me<br/>
against DH. But Gabe still has the cumulative effect of often having<br/>
to rebel against ridiculous/arbitrary rules.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for DH, I can&#39;t wait for the Live and Learn Conference! And<br/>
for DS, I hope that understanding his anger better will help me to<br/>
intervene and advocate better for him.<br/>
