<div id="ygrps-yiv-471321507">I met with the certified teacher here in Ohio to go over our first complete year of <br/>
unschooling. We are supposed to give evidence of progress in the various subject <br/>
categories required by the state. This was my first time that I didn&#39;t have a single <br/>
workbook to show her. She&#39;s a wonderful friend and homeschooler who dislikes textbook <br/>
based education (she&#39;s more eclectic). So I was comfortable with her but nervous that even <br/>
still I might not match the expectations.<br/>
<br/>
What I decided to do this year is to write an individual narrative for each of my five kids. I <br/>
focused on how each one spent his or her time and gave subhead categories. I didn&#39;t <br/>
flinch. I listed their areas of interest in order so my first category for my 7 year old was <br/>
&quot;TV&quot; and focused on her extenisve knowledge of Disney sit coms. For my 10 year old son, I <br/>
declared his first category: Computer Gaming. I detailed his mastery of War Craft and Star <br/>
Craft. For my third child, I began by discussing his passion for all things Lord of the Rings. <br/>
I went on to express how they learned math etc. but I started with the most controversial <br/>
topics.<br/>
<br/>
I figured that if my narratives didn&#39;t reveal &quot;enough&quot; education according to the certified <br/>
teacher&#39;s standards, she&#39;d let me know and I&#39;d figure out a way to meet those <br/>
expectations. But if I could be straightforward without finessing the language, then I knew <br/>
I&#39;d never look back about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Several wonderful things occurred in the process.<br/>
<br/>
First, I enjoyed writing these narratives. It felt like a time capsule of their treasures. I could <br/>
see the way they learned, what they valued and how they spent their lives (well-spent!). <br/>
<br/>
Second, my kids loved hearing me read them. They were astonished at all they had learned <br/>
this year. I asked each one to let me know if I had over-stated or forgotten to include <br/>
anything. My 12 year old who often worries that he isn&#39;t getting an education said at the <br/>
end of his narration, &quot;Wow! I learned so much this year. Can we write something like this <br/>
each month? It really helps me to see how I&#39;m learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Third, the certified teacher loved what I did for my kids. She said two things, &quot;Now this is <br/>
what I call an education.&quot; She also said, &quot;Let&#39;s always schedule you last. I get so tired of <br/>
Abeka and Bob Jones paraded through my living room as education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told the truth - I shared their strenghts and weaknesses. I expressed it all in common <br/>
language. And I included personal comments that they the kids had made about what they <br/>
were learning.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the individual narratives, I included a description of a day at the art museum <br/>
with my kids. I wanted her to see what a typical outing to the msuem is like for us and all <br/>
the ways that the kids reveal the complex, intergrated knowledge they&#39;ve gained and how <br/>
they use it. She loved this as well.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone&#39;s interested, I&#39;d be happy to post one of them or email them. I will post the art <br/>
museum narrative. It was an especially fun one to write and helped me to affirm the <br/>
education happening within my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought those wondering how to quantify unschooling might like some examples and <br/>
encouragement.<br/>

Hey, Julie - I&#39;m interested. I am always looking at new ways of representing our learning and unschooling for our yearly education department visit. If you prefer, you can email me privately...Leonie <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:westen@...">westen@...</a><br/>
