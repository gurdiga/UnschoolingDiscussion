&lt;&lt; Sandra, weren&#39;t those the books you mentioned in your last HEM column as <br/>
just <br/>
sitting on the shelf?  You never know... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There doesn&#39;t seem to be a solid cool page on Henry Treece, but I found this <br/>
in a review at Amazon UK, the page about a Poul Anderson book called &quot;The <br/>
Broken Sword.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Poul Anderson was one of the earliest SCA members (and then went away to <br/>
become a famous author).   Keith might have that book.  But the Henry Treece <br/>
mention is BIG:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;P.S. I agree<br/>
with the earlier reviewer who mentioned Henry Treece, another<br/>
writer who came before Tolkien and in my opinion did the job a<br/>
whole lot better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had read six Henry Treece books in Jr. High, and never got hold of Tolkien <br/>
until I was in college.<br/>
