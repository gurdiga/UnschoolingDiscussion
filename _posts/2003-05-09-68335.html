&lt;&lt; This is something I&#39;ve struggled with ever since I was in third grade <br/>
<br/>
and my father told me that the Thanksgiving story they told me in <br/>
<br/>
school wasn&#39;t true. Why does our culture lie to children? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;mythology,&quot; and all cultures have it.  In some it&#39;s exactly the <br/>
same as their religion.  In a separation of church and state situation, the <br/>
state takes on some mythological overtones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;and people in Europe in 1492 <br/>
<br/>
didn&#39;t think the world was flat. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some knew it wasn&#39;t flat.<br/>
Most didn&#39;t know diddly.<br/>
Some thought it was flat.<br/>
<br/>
There weren&#39;t professional journals or anything like that.  Some of the maps <br/>
from those days seem woeful now.<br/>
<br/>
Just because SOME people know that school is bad for kids doesn&#39;t mean you <br/>
can say &quot;At the beginning of the 21st century, peope didn&#39;t think school was <br/>
good for kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When someone says, &quot;It&#39;s a modern-day <br/>
<br/>
Cinderella story&quot; I don&#39;t want my children to say, &quot;What the heck is <br/>
<br/>
a Cinderella story?&quot;  I hope they don&#39;t respond to a reference that <br/>
<br/>
the Emperor has no clothes by saying that we have a President, not an <br/>
<br/>
Emperor.  I don&#39;t think anyone born in this country needs a school to <br/>
<br/>
teach them cultural literacy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When a family plans to shield their children from modern culture by keeping <br/>
them away from television, music, movies, and people who don&#39;t go to their <br/>
church, it might help for those parents to have a checklist so they can <br/>
mention things like Cinderella and The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes, since they&#39;re <br/>
not in the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I do wonder what people tell their <br/>
<br/>
children when the cultural myth is a blatant lie.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Double trouble for Christian literalists.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What do you say onThanksgiving?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could say there&#39;s a traditional story, which isn&#39;t altogether true, but <br/>
has vague basis in some historical happenings, and talk about folklore!  What <br/>
it is, though, is a feast of new-world foods, and that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
Folklore and mythology aren&#39;t &quot;blatant lies.&quot;  They&#39;re folklore and <br/>
mythology, which grow gradually, as crystals grow.  <br/>
<br/>
There ARE blatant lies in the world, but most of the traditional American <br/>
stuff falls under myth, I think.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a painting at the U.S. capitol building of George Washington and <br/>
Abraham Lincoln standing and shaking hands.   Is that a blatant lie?  It&#39;s <br/>
symbolic art.  Nobody&#39;s pointing it out to tourists and saying &quot;This is from <br/>
a photograph of the day Washington met Lincoln.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think telling kids there&#39;s a conspiracy and the national symbols and <br/>
stories are all lies is likewise a lie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been interested in traditional ballads since I was fifteen.  They&#39;re one <br/>
of my favorite collectible things.  In literature books they&#39;re sometimes <br/>
listed as &quot;anonymous.&quot;  They&#39;re not &quot;anonymous.&quot;  Anonymous means someone <br/>
wrote it, but forgot to sign it, or sent it out into the world without <br/>
wanting credit.  There are broadside ballads which are truly anonymous.  <br/>
Someone wrote a parody, or the account of a hanging or something (&quot;to be sung <br/>
to the tune of Greensleeves&quot;), it was published that afternoon to sell at the <br/>
public execution site as souvenirs, and it was over that same day.    <br/>
<br/>
But a traditional ballad will be found in different parts and places, with <br/>
variations and maybe different tunes, having changed gradually over long <br/>
periods of time.  And when you find one it&#39;s not &quot;anonymous,&quot; it&#39;s <br/>
&quot;traditional.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So are lots of the simplified elements of history which schoolkids recite <br/>
back, which pass for &quot;learning history.&quot;  They&#39;re learning mythology, and <br/>
traditional accounts and such.<br/>
<br/>
There is a growing set of lies which ARE composed by particular purposes and <br/>
they&#39;re being sold in homeschooling catalogs every day.  That&#39;s the revised <br/>
history of America used by many homeschoolers, the history that shows that <br/>
America was always a Christian country, corrupted by immigrants and bad <br/>
influences; that the Indians were cannibals, killing each other all the time <br/>
in their mean igorance; that God chose and maintains this country but he&#39;s <br/>
very angry and this country needs to get back to its true roots.  The paint <br/>
is still wet on those new true roots.  How will kids who are presented that <br/>
as &quot;this is history, period&quot; know that what they have is a brand new kind of <br/>
mythology?<br/>
<br/>
Then there is Christian &quot;science.&quot; Not christian-science as in the church, <br/>
but homeschooling science materials written by Christians to match the Bible, <br/>
and if kids are limited to JUST the input their parents choose, how will they <br/>
know there is other more objective, more scientific science out there?<br/>
<br/>
When kids gather up their own cultural literacy, Rumplestiltskin is a name to <br/>
know, and Teddy Roosevelt is a name to know.  One&#39;s more real than the other, <br/>
but they&#39;ve both had stories told about them that weren&#39;t true!<br/>

Thanksgiving?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pass the turkey and gravy??<br/>
<br/>
No, really.  When  was in school, my Dad told me the true story of Columbus, <br/>
too,  and always sang us his own little twist on the famous poem...<br/>
<br/>
In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue<br/>
Round and round and round he went<br/>
Till his ship dropped sail, his energy spent<br/>
But what was poor Columbus to do?<br/>
Well, find an Indian,<br/>
HE&#39;LL tell you the truth!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-172826188">I guess alot of this depends on what one considers &quot;their&quot; culture to be. For example the Thanksgiving and Columbus issues are pretty much non-issues for me because even though my daughter is only 5 1/2 I was and continue to be honest about what went down because it directly relates to her heritage as an Indigenous/Latina person. While I think it is sad on some level, I feel we are outside the mainstream American culture. However because we live within the mainstream culture she sees for herself and is exposed herself to the images of the Natives having turkey with the pilgrims and of Columbus being welcomed by the Tainos. I really do discuss with her the different perspectives and where they come from ( we&#39;ll look at books or go to events/places etc).

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680429879">Good for you!!! The straw that broke the camels back for me was the teacher telling my Brianna (Abenaki, Mandan-Hidatsu, Mohawk) that she had to be a pilgrim and that I had to make the outfit! Brianna (aka Mudpuppy) came home and said &quot;the teacher wants......... I&#39;m not doing it.&quot;   So she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger - I was told that the Azores (we are also Azorean) - a group of islands approx. 750 miles west of Portugal - were conquered by the Portuguese around the 1200&#39;s. I was told that we - the Calouro&#39;s - could trace our family back to the invasion. I was told stories of what the invaders did on the island ( they found the women beautiful, and able to fish and fight along side the men;  traders were warned about the islands, although the islands were beautiful, they were inhabited by witches and infidels)<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you look up history about the Azores - the islands are described as &quot;uninhabited&quot; when the Portuguese &quot;discovered&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that the current Japanese are not indigenous to those islands??<br/>
This seems to be a habit - assassination or assimilation.<br/>
<br/>
Mudpuppy & I live outside the mainstream - that&#39;s good.  She isn&#39;t so bothered about weight, looks or clothes. She&#39;s concerned with things of the People - which powwow will we go to.  Will her new regalia be ready?  Will her aunt Kelly get well ( fighting cancer) will we ( the council) get the long house and garden done this season? and how much will she do? <br/>
<br/>
We can (and should) look at the culture and - maybe -0 if it&#39;s right for you - take what we want, what we need.<br/>
But stay outside of mainstream culture - it is the culture of consumerism, it is the culture of self- destruction - <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you like some books???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-25215322">Okay - to finish this response.......<br/>
<br/>
Brianna has been raised with the truth. I really don&#39;t see how we can do anything other than be truthful about &quot;our&quot; culture.  The fact is - the Mashpees ( the folks who fed the Pilgrims) - do not have Federal recognition.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that the &#39;creation myths&#39; of the US are insidious and I feel that Brianna has to know the truth.<br/>
<br/>
I teach her about the invasion and the occupation; she knows People that have been in boarding schools - after being kidnapped from their families.<br/>
<br/>
She knows that there are people that treat us differently because we are &quot;Indian&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of us protest Thanksgiving.<br/>
Some use it as a generic holiday - we are giving thanks for our ancestors that survived.<br/>
We are giving thanks for our sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends that survived.<br/>

It&#39;s really not so hard - when you wrap your mind around it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341204597">Did someone say books???? Janis, I think for me it was not wanting to deal with teacher&#39;s telling my daughter to play a pligrim or tell her as they told me when I was a student that the Rican indigenous culture didn&#39;t survive Spanish colonialism that led me to keep the MapucheRican, Carolina, out of mainstream schools. Knowing about the myths and being culturaly literate doesn&#39;t mean you have to be a part of it though or perpetuate it. In order to fight the enemy you have to know the enemy right?

Good for you!!! The straw that broke the camels back for me was the teacher telling my Brianna (Abenaki, Mandan-Hidatsu, Mohawk) that she had to be a pilgrim and that I had to make the outfit! Brianna (aka Mudpuppy) came home and said &quot;the teacher wants......... I&#39;m not <br/>
<br/>
doing it.&quot;   So she didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger - I was told that the Azores (we are also Azorean) - a group of islands approx. 750 miles west of Portugal - were conquered by the Portuguese around the 1200&#39;s. I was told that we - the Calouro&#39;s - could trace our family back to the invasion. I was told stories of what the invaders did on the island ( they found the women beautiful, and able to fish and fight along side the men;  traders were warned about the islands, although the islands were beautiful, they were inhabited by witches and infidels)<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you look up history about the Azores - the islands are described as &quot;uninhabited&quot; when the Portuguese &quot;discovered&quot; them.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that the current Japanese are not indigenous to those islands??<br/>
This seems to be a habit - assassination or assimilation.<br/>
<br/>
Mudpuppy & I live outside the mainstream - that&#39;s good.  She isn&#39;t so bothered about weight, looks or clothes. She&#39;s concerned with things of the People - which powwow will we go to.  Will her new regalia be ready?  Will her aunt Kelly get well ( fighting cancer) will we ( the council) get the long house and garden done this season? and how much will she do? <br/>
<br/>
We can (and should) look at the culture and - maybe -0 if it&#39;s right for you - take what we want, what we need.<br/>
But stay outside of mainstream culture - it is the culture of consumerism, it is the culture of self- destruction - <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you like some books???<br/>

  I guess alot of this depends on what one considers &quot;their&quot; culture to be. For example the Thanksgiving and Columbus issues are pretty much non-issues for me because even though my daughter is only 5 1/2 I was and continue to be honest about what went down because it directly relates to her heritage as an Indigenous/Latina person. While I think it is sad on some level, I feel we are outside the mainstream American culture. However because we live within the mainstream culture she sees for herself and is exposed herself to the images of the Natives having turkey with the pilgrims and of Columbus being welcomed by the Tainos. I really do discuss with her the different perspectives and where they come from ( we&#39;ll look at books or go to events/places etc). We don&#39;t &quot;celebrate&quot; Thanksgiving in my household. We protest it and I explain to my daughter why and she has the option of participating with me or not.  Maegan la Mala <br/>

<br/>
  Columbus didn&#39;t discover America, he didn&#39;t use the word &quot;Indians&quot; <br/>
  becuase he thought he was in India, and people in Europe in 1492 <br/>
  didn&#39;t think the world was flat.  But could someone be culturally <br/>
  literate (mainstream American culture, not multiculturally literate) <br/>
  without at least knowing that some people do believe these things?<br/>
<br/>
  Abraham Lincoln didn&#39;t fight the Civil War to free the slaves and <br/>
  give them American citizenship, but it&#39;s a cultural myth so big that <br/>
  it clouds any discussion of the Civil War.<br/>
<br/>
  I do &quot;get&quot; where E.D. Hirsch is coming from, that it helps if people <br/>
  are on the same page when they&#39;re talking.  If I was going to do a <br/>
  curriculum it would be his.  When someone says, &quot;It&#39;s a modern-day <br/>
  Cinderella story&quot; I don&#39;t want my children to say, &quot;What the heck is <br/>
  a Cinderella story?&quot;  I hope they don&#39;t respond to a reference that <br/>
  the Emperor has no clothes by saying that we have a President, not an <br/>
  Emperor.  I don&#39;t think anyone born in this country needs a school to <br/>
  teach them cultural literacy.  But I do wonder what people tell their <br/>
  children when the cultural myth is a blatant lie.  What do you say on <br/>
  Thanksgiving?<br/>

Please recommend some books.  I agree about the mainstream culture, <br/>
which is why I homebirth, homeschool, and avoid stupid things like <br/>
the mall.  But I wonder sometimes how much my children need to know <br/>
about mainstream culture.  I mean, they will move out someday and I <br/>
don&#39;t want them to be completely lost in society.  It&#39;s one thing for <br/>
me to reject the mainstream culture and live differently.  I know <br/>
both ways and I made my choice.  But I feel like I&#39;m doing them a <br/>
disservice to raise them in this country and not tell them what it&#39;s <br/>
like (they&#39;re young right now so it hasn&#39;t been a problem so far).  <br/>
It&#39;s the same as when I left Christianity -- I thought I&#39;d raise my <br/>
kids to not even know Christianity, but now I&#39;m wondering if I should <br/>
expose them to it while they&#39;re growing up.  I mean, seventy percent <br/>
of Americans are Christian; it would be wrong for my kids to not even <br/>
know it&#39;s out there.  I&#39;m confused.  And I&#39;m tired on top of it and <br/>
not making any sense.  But please, recommend some books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-888205415">Betsy, Regarding rape as an assimilationist even genocidal tactic of  imperialist nations, I know in Puerto Rico and in Rican history classes here in the United States it was taught that it was the rape of the indigenous Tainos that contributed to the extinction of that culture  (and also attached to that how Taina women would kill themselves and their babies to avoid those rapes and having mixed blood babies). Of course then later I find out that the Taino nation was never really complete made extinct but you get the point.  Maegan la Mala<br/>
