walked close, but not too close, and *asked her* if it was okay for me to <br/>
touch her now. I told her I wanted us to reconnect and feel better and that <br/>
maybe touching would help. She still wasn&#39;t communicative, but didn&#39;t scream <br/>
louder so I took it as a yes. I touched only her hands. She calmed just a <br/>
little. I aked if I could touch her shoulders, she said yes but didn&#39;t like <br/>
it. I stopped. I asked if I could rub her back. She liked this and started <br/>
really calming. We ended up playing chess and I was able to get her to eat <br/>
something. Things are better now.<br/>
<br/>
I know that touching has always helped her if I can get it in the right way. <br/>
Now I also know that it&#39;s important to request permission to touch her when <br/>
she&#39;s that upset. Seems so simple, yet it took me this long.<br/>

it&#39;s just never about the unschooling. I know it frustrates some people to <br/>
hear me say that. But it&#39;s true. Without unschooling I would not have the <br/>
freedom that I do to honor my children for Who They Are. To give them the <br/>
room they need to learn to live within their own bodies no matter what age <br/>
the learning takes place. To let them Be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know - this sentence could just have been stopped BEFORE the &quot;with <br/>
kids who have special needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes find it confusing figuring out how unschooling &quot;works&quot; or <br/>
fits into our lives.<br/>
<br/>
THAT would be a sentence that makes sense. Lots of people find it <br/>
confusing - when trying to apply it to their own lives.<br/>
<br/>
Here is another sentence that makes sense:<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes find it confusing figuring out how unschooling &quot;works&quot; or <br/>
fits into our lives with our particular kids and the specific kinds of <br/>
issues we deal with around here.<br/>
<br/>
It really is the &quot;special needs&quot; label that makes people react - it <br/>
sounds to people like you are saying that there is this group of kids <br/>
wearing the &quot;special needs&quot; label and that unschooling, which works for <br/>
everybody else, is problematic for them.<br/>
<br/>
What people are then saying back is that unschooling is the IDEAL for <br/>
all kids, since it specifically means supporting the kids in whatever <br/>
idiosyncratic way works for that specific kid. But it doesn&#39;t help <br/>
someone unschool if they think of their kids as &quot;special needs&quot; because <br/>
that is a label that is meaningless in an unschooling context. <br/>
Unschoolers think of each of their kids as so completely individual <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t make any sense to label them in this context. Labeling <br/>
them, or taking the labels too seriously, in fact, could make it more <br/>
difficult to unschool and might lead to unnecessary confusion.<br/>

Do you stay up with them and actively participate in their activities <br/>
with them late at night?  My husband has the exact same sleeping <br/>
schedule.  In bed between 9 and 10, and up at 5 for work.  I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed that when the kids are playing by themselves and I&#39;m doing my <br/>
own thing, they&#39;re much more likely to be loud and wake up dh.  When <br/>
I&#39;m actively playing with them, they are much more likely to be quiet <br/>
enough. My presence tends to keep things more quiet and them less <br/>
likely to fight loudly with each other.    <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really consider this an unschooling issue. My kids have no <br/>
bedtimes, but I definitely would find a way to make sure they are quiet <br/>
enough for my dh to sleep. In fact, because our house is not very <br/>
soundproof - we all have to work hard to be quiet. For years I sat up <br/>
with my younger kids, to keep them quiet so my dh could get to sleep. I <br/>
turned the tv down, I turned their music down, I shushed them when <br/>
their voices got loud, I distracted them from noisy games, and so on. <br/>
They get too tired and sometimes can&#39;t settle down and go to sleep - <br/>
they actually got hyperactive when they were overtired. I&#39;d bribe and <br/>
cajole them to snuggle with me and let me read to them long enough to <br/>
settle them down. I&#39;d give them warm milk. I&#39;d put on quiet types of <br/>
movies. I&#39;d try to give them separate things to do - so that they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t rile each other up. I gave them piles of pillows and blankets <br/>
so that they could settle down right where they were. I put up the pup <br/>
tent in the living room so they could sleep in it. I put them in warm <br/>
baths. I gave them warm milk. We did slow breathing techniques to <br/>
relax. We listened to environmental sound tapes and relaxation tapes. <br/>
We listened to books and stories on tape - Jim Weiss especially. I gave <br/>
them a massage. I laid down in their room with one on each side of me <br/>
and told them stories about themselves or imaginary stories but using <br/>
their names as the heroines.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  And  the breaking of controllers and other things.. &quot;Pre&quot; <br/>
&gt; unschooling, those<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At my house they&#39;d probably be put up out of reach somewhere until I <br/>
was convinced it wouldn&#39;t happen again. Not as a punishment, per se, <br/>
but because we just wouldn&#39;t get something fixed that is going to just <br/>
be broken again. Can&#39;t waste money like that.  I&#39;d work on those anger <br/>
issues in whatever ways I could, of course, as I&#39;m sure you are. The <br/>
controllers and other things would not be the focus - it would be the <br/>
self-control issues. I like the book by Marilyn (Madilyn?) Shure -- &quot;I <br/>
Can Problem Solve.&quot; There is one for younger kids and one for older <br/>
kids. I also like the &quot;How to Talk so Kids will Listen and ....&quot; book. <br/>
Both gave me a lot of ideas. I also like, The Explosive Child. Again, <br/>
though, i don&#39;t really see this as unschooling issue.<br/>
<br/>
I know that lots of people here do see all child-raising issues as <br/>
unschooling issues and I get their point - but that tends to get <br/>
confused with total noncoercive parenting and I just don&#39;t believe that <br/>
THAT is necessary for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;unlimited gaming&quot;   All that stuff I posted earlier about thier<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; frustrations, ect.. and the fact that they can&#39;t work out a sharing <br/>
&gt; system<br/>
&gt; between themselves.  My previous solution was to allow each one a <br/>
&gt; block of<br/>
&gt; time and to take turns.. Well, thats not unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s my solution too, to having one computer. I know some people just <br/>
have the policy in their family that the next person just should wait <br/>
until the first person is done...but that didn&#39;t seem fair to my <br/>
family, so we had a policy, for a long time that when the next person <br/>
wanted the computer, the previous person would have 1/2 hour more and <br/>
then had to turn it over. And so on. We had sign-up sheets, too, for a <br/>
while. We&#39;ve tried different things - now I have my own computer, my <br/>
husband has his own, my 18 yo has her own and our 12 and 15 yo&#39;s seem <br/>
to be able to share almost all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Again - I don&#39;t get why that is not unschooling - are you &quot;schooling?&quot; <br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmm, let me see, I have also had quite a bit of flack from family <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of people get a lot of flak. Sometimes people eventually come <br/>
around and support it - but often not until the kids get older.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, my daughter , the &quot;model student&quot;  is feeling very disconcerted <br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - you are forcing her to unschool? Something oxymoronic there -- <br/>
maybe she&#39;d like to sign up for online courses or take workshops of <br/>
some kind or do a public school isp or a correspondence course or <br/>
something else that is more what she&#39;s comfortable with. It might be <br/>
easier for her to move from a place of comfort to a more unschooling <br/>
life on her own. Or maybe she&#39;d just like to go to school with the <br/>
understanding that you&#39;ll let her handle it and let her leave if she <br/>
decides to do that.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Labeling them, or taking the labels too seriously, in fact, could make it <br/>
more <br/>
difficult to unschool and might lead to unnecessary confusion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And that is still thinking about the mother&#39;s understanding and the mother&#39;s <br/>
convenience.<br/>
<br/>
Labels and test scores last a lifetime.  The more kids who can be told <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re great the way you are,&quot; and &quot;Just do what&#39;s in front of you, you&#39;ll <br/>
learn ever day!&quot; the more healthy and happy and contented adults there will <br/>
be ten and twenty years down the line.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is the way you are and I love you&quot; has got to be better to hear than <br/>
&quot;OH! You&#39;re dyslexic; that&#39;s why we homeschool; that&#39;s why you can&#39;t read <br/>
yet; that&#39;s why you have a hard time with math.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it will come in its own time&quot; has got to be better than, &quot;Well <br/>
if you were an average, normal kid you&#39;d be doing it by now, but you&#39;re not.  <br/>
There&#39;s something wrong with you...&quot; even if it&#39;s followed by &quot;But that&#39;s <br/>
okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And for kids who have already been labelled defective by schools for not <br/>
sitting still, or by parents because the curriculum wasn&#39;t coming along at <br/>
the pace the teacher&#39;s guide said it should, maybe they can be told, &quot;I used <br/>
to think this was a problem, but there are lots of kids like you, and with <br/>
unschooling it won&#39;t matter what order you learn things in or how you hold <br/>
your pencil.  Let&#39;s watch a movie and eat some popcorn.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
It has been stated more than once that the lifting of limits and the ideas <br/>
about bedtimes and chores and food are not required for unschooling but that <br/>
lots of unschoolers eventually get there.<br/>
<br/>
To life all rules suddenly without an understanding of WHY, and without <br/>
adjustments in the family relationships isn&#39;t going to work.   This has been <br/>
discussed quite a bit of late.<br/>
<br/>
If something&#39;s not working, don&#39;t do it.  <br/>
Or try to understand WHY it&#39;s not working.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It IS getting better, but she still misses school and I <br/>
think she would go back in  minute if I suggested it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she really wants to go to school and isn&#39;t happy with unschooling, what&#39;s <br/>
the advantage of keeping her home?<br/>
<br/>
Unless both parents and the kids are into unschooling, it&#39;s not likely to <br/>
work anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Since the kids have been homeschooling, and we lifted &quot;bedtime&quot;  they <br/>
stay up LOUDLY til after midnight.  They wont respect Dh need to sleep. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Without gradual adjustments and a change in awareness, just saying &quot;stay up <br/>
as late as you want&quot; has nothing to do with unschooling.   MANY people have <br/>
said if the dad has to sleep, he has to sleep!  If gradually children get to <br/>
stay up later responsibly that could lead as far as it can  and chaos ensues, <br/>
blaming the advice on this list is not productive.<br/>
<br/>
Had there been one more mom to advice, or thirty more, or five hundred fewer, <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t change the situation.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST moms should understand.  THEN natural learning starts and gradually <br/>
people get into the flow and rhythm of unschooling.  It can&#39;t really happen <br/>
by one parent declaring one day that it&#39;s unschooling time, all rules are <br/>
off, and that&#39;s it.  <br/>
<br/>
All KINDS of suggestions and explanations and principles have been discussed <br/>
here.  People could read all the archives or  just take my word for it, but <br/>
people HAVE tried to help Teresa with her specific situations, and it seems <br/>
to me that the response is &quot;Well THAT didn&#39;t work.&quot;  Repeatedly.  <br/>
<br/>
Teresa, I&#39;m sorry you feel that I&#39;ve singled you out somehow.  I&#39;m dealing in <br/>
ideas, not people.  Since you&#39;ve stated you&#39;re very  new to unschooling and <br/>
you seem not to really getting it, and you remind us that your kids and your <br/>
relatives and your husband aren&#39;t into it, maybe it&#39;s just not going to work <br/>
for you this season and you need to try something else for a while.  I&#39;m not <br/>
trying to be mean, I&#39;m trying to be practical.   <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve said this and you got angry, but it&#39;s really important so I&#39;m going <br/>
to risk saying it again.  You&#39;ve written LOTS on this list.   If you had <br/>
spent all that energy on being with your children instead of being here and <br/>
being angry and being defensive, you would be further along on the path than <br/>
you are now.  That&#39;s not saying &quot;don&#39;t post.&quot;  It&#39;s saying &quot;if you want <br/>
unschooling to work, look at your kids, not at us.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They wont respect Dh need to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One possibility is that they don&#39;t feel their needs are treated with<br/>
respect. It *is* easy to not respect kids needs when we view them from adult<br/>
perspectives. If we&#39;re in the middle of something and they ask us to watch a<br/>
cartoon with them, it&#39;s difficult to see that as being as important to them<br/>
as our important stuff is to us. So when we approach them with &quot;This is what<br/>
I need&quot; they may have learned to act as if they were saying -- as we may do<br/>
to them more often than we realize -- &quot;Yes, but I need this so that<br/>
overrides your need.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another is that they can&#39;t understand. My daughter who is 11 still has<br/>
conflicts between her need to pick up the cats and their need to be doing<br/>
whatever they want to be doing at the time. It&#39;s sort of like she<br/>
subconsciously feels that if she picks them up they&#39;ll understand her need<br/>
and comply.<br/>
<br/>
We wouldn&#39;t expect a 2 or 3 yo to understand that she needs to set her needs<br/>
aside so someone else can meet his needs. Since your boys are responding as<br/>
though they don&#39;t understand, then treat them as though they can&#39;t<br/>
understand and give them the help and patience you&#39;d give to a 2 or 3 year<br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;unlimited gaming&quot;   All that stuff I posted earlier about thier<br/>
&gt; frustrations, ect.. and the fact that they can&#39;t work out a sharing system<br/>
&gt; between themselves.  My previous solution was to allow each one a block of<br/>
&gt; time and to take turns.. Well, thats not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually working out sibling clashes isn&#39;t part of unschooling. But helping<br/>
kids deal with life while being respectful and trusting is an outgrowth of<br/>
unschooling that many unschoolers are drawn to.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has posted a lot about this. I think it&#39;s telling that you say that<br/>
*they* can&#39;t work out a sharing system. It isn&#39;t up to them to work it out.<br/>
They don&#39;t have the skills to draw on in order to try things out. They need<br/>
your help. They don&#39;t need you to solve it for them. They need you to help<br/>
them work through the problem and through various solutions.<br/>
<br/>
There are probably a lot of things contributing to the problem. Have you<br/>
read Siblings Without Rivalry? That might help you deal with the part that&#39;s<br/>
contributed by sibling rivalry.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hmm, let me see, I have also had quite a bit of flack from family about my<br/>
&gt; choice to unschool.   Especially from my 16 yo son.  I have written about<br/>
&gt; this in detail in the past..<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though you may have tried out every single idea that people suggested, since<br/>
you haven&#39;t said what has worked and what hasn&#39;t, since you&#39;re repeating the<br/>
problem as though no one gave you any advice at all, there&#39;s a *feeling* you<br/>
haven&#39;t done anything. It *feels* like you&#39;re waiting for someone to give<br/>
you an answer that you like.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you haven&#39;t done anything. Only that if you want people to<br/>
give you help, they&#39;ll need to feel like they&#39;re being heard and that you&#39;re<br/>
trying to help yourself. If it feels like the advice is going into a black<br/>
hole, people aren&#39;t going to feel as willing to spend time helping.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; think she would go back in  minute if I suggested it.<br/>

What are her feelings? What does she say?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I copied this paragraph so I could address it specifically, but I also want <br/>
to respond to the rest of the stuff you said.<br/>
<br/>
Everything you said, regarding bedtimes, controllers, etc. IS how we have <br/>
been handling situations.   I am very surprised that you agree with our <br/>
decisions.   Some of the more &quot;hard core/radical&quot; unschoolers here would <br/>
disagree for ME to say I handle them in those manners.( I know, because they <br/>
have)  But, I feel pretty sure that your approach ( even though its just like <br/>
mine) will be accepted and agreed that it&#39;s OK..  It is nice to know that <br/>
someone who is a regular, well-liked, veteran unschooler on this list sees <br/>
some of the &quot;issues&quot; the same way I do.<br/>
<br/>
Now, for Anna going to school.  I am not &quot;forcing&quot; her to homeschool, or to <br/>
unschool.  She CAN go back to public school, but not to the school she was in <br/>
before she quit.  Its a transportation, money, time, issue.  She can catch <br/>
the bus and go to the public school in her district, but she does not want to <br/>
do that.   She IS signed up for several &quot;classes&quot;   One of the big struggles <br/>
with homeschooling is that the unschooling appraoch is GREAT for the boys.. <br/>
but not for Anna.. I still think it would be, if she can sort of get <br/>
&quot;unconditioned&quot; to her way of thinking about learning/teaching/schoolwork.   <br/>
I am trying to help her self motivate.. set her own goals,   follow her OWN <br/>
path of learning,  not some laid out plan that someone else makes up.  She is <br/>
doing better.  And there are lots of things about school she does not miss <br/>
and she is glad to not be bothered with ( art, PE, homework, several &quot;weirdo&quot; <br/>
teachers, bullies, fashion pressure.)   Honestly, I spend so much time <br/>
&quot;supervising/refereeing/intervening with the boys, I can&#39;t really &quot;help&quot; her <br/>
find her own way.     Everything she wants to do outside of the house, its a <br/>
big hassle getting the boys to go along.   She feels trapped and frustrated <br/>
because its a big ordeal just to go to the library.    She is so different <br/>
from them.   Its a conflict of interests and needs .. Basically, thier <br/>
interest is video/computer games and hers are MUCH more varied and geared <br/>
toward social involvement and &quot;project&quot; oriented.   Its only been about 10 <br/>
weeks.. we&#39;ll figure it out.. <br/>

could help or if she needed to be alone. But I bet I usually do invade her <br/>
private space more than I should. Asking her about the simplest act of just <br/>
touching her hand seemed to give her contol over the situation and calm her.<br/>
<br/>
We have talked more about what might be triggering these incidents. (It&#39;s <br/>
been a long time since we&#39;ve had to deal with this.) It turns out to be a <br/>
combo of too much stimulation from her birthday and (even bigger) anxiety <br/>
over the fact that I&#39;m going away for a few days this week. Once we started <br/>
talking about ways to deal with that anxiety, and redirected her fears, <br/>
she&#39;s been much more relaxed and the outbursts have calmed. &lt;whew!&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t be a tug of war. It won&#39;t work at all that way. That&#39;s the <br/>
whole idea of where people get the child led term from. My daughter asked <br/>
for a math work book last night to do. I could have said well we don&#39;t do <br/>
workbooks here. She *likes* them and so has Joseph on occasion in the past. <br/>
They are here, just not suggested by me for them to do. One of the most <br/>
radical unschoolers I have known had a daughter who at 15 wanted to enroll <br/>
in Clon Lara. So she did. She *wanted* to do it and did it on her own. It <br/>
was something she actually enjoyed doing and although her mother never <br/>
suggested such a thing, she was fine with her daughter finding her own way. <br/>
That&#39;s the point.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest uyse to struggle with school. I desperately tried to get her home <br/>
with me. Long story but I needed &quot;permission&quot; from her dad. It never <br/>
happened. She still had a hard time in school. Finally we got to the point <br/>
where she was miserable and her dad knew he had to okay her coming home. <br/>
Well that never happened either. I sat down with her and explained as best I <br/>
could how things might be with her home. It was a great option for her to <br/>
have and she really gave it quite a consideration. Once she knew she had the <br/>
option, or maybe even the power to say I&#39;ve had enough, things turned <br/>
around. SHE turned them around. She stayed in school because it was <br/>
something she knew she didn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to do. She&#39;s there because she wants to <br/>
be. She&#39;s pulling a 3.7 right now, working 5 days a week and making plans to <br/>
go to college.<br/>
<br/>
I actually thought very long and hard about forcing her to come home. <br/>
Thought about it a lot. It would not have been the right thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Give your child the option of making her own decision regarding school or no <br/>
school. Sometimes turning the power over to them will make all the <br/>
difference in the world. And if she still wants to go to school, then say <br/>
okay. As long as she knows she can come back home the second she decides to. <br/>
You might be real surprised how things work out.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is really important.<br/>
<br/>
In most (maybe all) of the school-at-home families I&#39;ve met or read about, <br/>
the parents made that decision without the children&#39;s input.  They parents <br/>
sometimes then make a decision to put the children back on school, without <br/>
regard for what the children want.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between &quot;schooling&quot; and unschooling has way more to do with <br/>
the relationship between the parents and the children than it has to do with <br/>
workbooks or location or hours.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that someone with a great relationship with her kids whose <br/>
kids are in a Catholic boarding school is an unschooler.  What I mean to say <br/>
is that if parents are controlling and children aren&#39;t free to say &quot;no&quot; (even <br/>
to the point of saying &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to homeschool anymore, I want to go <br/>
back to school), then the children aren&#39;t learning in freedom.  And until the <br/>
child has some independent rights, the miraculous kinds of things that <br/>
families report here can&#39;t start to happen.<br/>
<br/>
Children who are in school by their own choice are having a different school <br/>
experience than those who are there against their will, or who just don&#39;t <br/>
know there IS an option.   <br/>
<br/>
Children who are home by their own choice are having a different <br/>
homeschooling experience than those whose parents won&#39;t let them go to school <br/>
even if they want to.<br/>

It seems you&#39;re more concerned with having other parents tell you you&#39;re okay <br/>
than you are with what your kids need.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some folks suggested that since the kids are not respecting thier dads need <br/>
to sleep, then go ahead and have then turn the stuff off at 10. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re wanting our permission and approval for what you do.<br/>
<br/>
The list is good for suggestions and ideas, but you seem to be using it for <br/>
something entirely different, which is direction for your life.<br/>
<br/>
You need to make your own decisions based on all the input you care to <br/>
gather, and then defend your own decisions to yourself and your family.  It <br/>
seems you&#39;re taking our advice without regard for how it will or won&#39;t work <br/>
and then getting angry when it doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t seem to be a healthy use of a discussion list at all.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not clear what you meant, but if you meant to say that Pam won&#39;t be <br/>
criticized and you would have been for the same statements, Pam has been <br/>
unschooling for years, she&#39;s thoughtful and she&#39;s generous with her time and <br/>
energy to help other unschoolers.  If she writes something, we trust that <br/>
she&#39;s really thought it through and is offering it to be helpful.   <br/>

Pam has never been angry at other people&#39;s advice that I know of, and I&#39;ve <br/>

such thing as school or the convoluted notion that learning is hard and must <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe just leave her alone. I don&#39;t think you CAN help someone self <br/>
motivate. And what exactly are the goals you&#39;re thinking she should set for <br/>

to these, too, a couple of hundred posts ago. So have others. I&#39;m glad <br/>
you got it though, that what we&#39;re talking about doing is not the <br/>
extreme - &quot;just let them be&quot; that lots of people think unschoolers are <br/>
promoting. It is far from it. It is MUCh harder work than just having <br/>
rules and enforcing them, for most of us, at least at the beginning, <br/>

you pretty much reject them all as fast as they come. I think there is <br/>

what it is and so we&#39;re frustrating you as much as you are frustrating <br/>
us. And I suspect that when we&#39;ve gotten just a bit close that you&#39;ve <br/>
reacted negatively and sidetracked the conversation. I bet it has to do <br/>
more with your own emotional reaction to your kids and husband than <br/>
specific actions. You could probably do exactly what you&#39;re doing - but <br/>
with a different underlying attitude - and it is that attitude that we <br/>
can&#39;t help you with (although people have tried) because this is email <br/>
and it just doesn&#39;t work well.<br/>
