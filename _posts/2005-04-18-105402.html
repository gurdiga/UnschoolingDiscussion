<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081804937">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am new here and wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Denise, but <br/>
I go by Deece on my yahoo groups.  We have 2 dc (ds is 10 and dd is <br/>
8).  They want to unschool and we are trying it, but boy am I having <br/>
a hard time completely letting go.  This list has been some great <br/>
reading for me.  Thanks.<br/>
I have a question.  Was there a certain age that your children can go <br/>
about town on their own?  My biggest fear is having my child/ren <br/>
abducted or molested and because of my fear, there are things my <br/>
children are not allowed to do.<br/>
They can go outside and ride their bikes, but they have to stay on <br/>
our block and can only go from corner to corner (we are on a block <br/>
where the backside is the main street through town).  We have allowed <br/>
our ds to ride around the block across the street from us, but only <br/>
when we are outside.  We live a block and a half from a park and I <br/>
don&#39;t let them go alone, but I have let them run home for something <br/>
once we are there.  The other thing is that they don&#39;t have to ask to <br/>
go out, but I need to know they are going so I can keep an eye on <br/>
them if I am doing something.<br/>
Anyway, am I being paranoid?  My dc trust me and I trust them, I <br/>
don&#39;t trust creepy people who do bad things to little kids and they <br/>
are out there.  We do have good relationships with our dc and I want <br/>
them to have freedoms, but I still feel they are too young to be able <br/>
to do somethings (like ride their bikes around the neighborhood <br/>
without me or dh along).<br/>
Any opinions?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son has, in the past year, started &quot;exploring&quot; our city on his <br/>
own. (He turned 8 in Oct.) Last summer, he and his cousin (18 mos <br/>
older)would walk anywhere that was within 1-2 miles radius. They <br/>
weren&#39;t allowed to cross any major streets, but luckily that means <br/>
they were still able to access several parks, a &quot;corner&quot; store/gas <br/>
station, and even a Chinese restaurant. I&#39;m more uncomfortable <br/>
letting my son explore alone, without his cousin, esp since she <br/>
tends to be the more cautious &quot;dont break any rules&quot; type, and he is <br/>
more fearless. She told me about how he crossed a busy street but <br/>
she wouldnt do it because she knew it wasnt allowed. I had to <br/>
explain to him more clearly why he needed to stay within the <br/>
boundaries i set, and not cross the &quot;traffic light&quot; streets. <br/>
<br/>
One thing i do, that makes me feel tons better, is give my son my <br/>
cell phone (preprogrammed with our number so he can just hit the <br/>
call button)so he can call me if there is any trouble, he is lost, <br/>
or is too tired and needs a ride home. This actually came in handy <br/>
when my niece cut her toe pretty badly while they were hiking <br/>
through a &quot;trail&quot; (just a woodsy area in the park)...they handled <br/>
the situation very calmly, and i was able to bring bandaids, and <br/>
drive them home. <br/>
<br/>
We live in a very safe area, which is relatively crime-free (maybe <br/>
one murder in the past 20 years, and it wasnt random)...however, i <br/>
still go over safety issues with my son and what to do if someone <br/>
approaches him. <br/>
<br/>
I dont know how safe the area is where you live, but with kids being <br/>
kidnapped right out of their bedrooms, it doesnt seem like keeping <br/>
them at home is going to necessarily &quot;protect&quot; them. If you live in <br/>
a relatively safe area, i would let them go explore together. And if <br/>
you have a cell phone you can loan them for their trips, it would <br/>
probably make you feel better that you can call them, or they call <br/>
you, if needed.<br/>

The best answer is, &quot;It depends.&quot; It depends on your neighborhood, the <br/>
size of your city/town, your children&#39;s maturity levels, the amount of <br/>
traffic betwen your house and the park, your comfort level, their <br/>
comfort levels, .....<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much bigger than just that they&#39;re ten and eight!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re comfortable with their riding their bikes there and playing <br/>
----have you thought of walkie-talkies? When we go to Lake Eden Arts <br/>
Festival, we have four walkie-talkies that we each carry. That gives <br/>
everyone a certain amount of freedom while still being &quot;connected&quot; We <br/>
also feel *very* safe at LEAF---very family friendly.<br/>
<br/>
One of Cameron&#39;s friends always carried a walkie-talkie when they used <br/>
to go to the park---that gave us the idea. I think they all went down <br/>
to the park together at ten or eleven---but they had to go as a group.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing was: all these boys (and Kim) lived in the same <br/>
neighborhood, but they didn&#39;t know each other for years because Cameron <br/>
and Deveon were only allowed to ride around *this* block; Thomas and <br/>
Mark were only allowed to ride around *that* block, Kim and and Paschal <br/>
were only allowed to ride around *the other* block!<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until they started playing baseball together that we realized <br/>
that bring allowed to go another few yards would have given them all <br/>
more friends! &lt;G&gt; They had several great years together as a &quot;gang&quot;---- <br/>
until they got cars!<br/>
<br/>
Again---it depends.<br/>

 <br/>
True. And just as statistically people are more likely to die of a tornado  <br/>
if they&#39;re Baptist (and Baptists in trailer parks shouldn&#39;t expect to live at  <br/>
all)...<br/>
 <br/>
Statistically...<br/>
Homeschooled kids are more likely (statistically) to be murdered by their  <br/>
mothers than snatched from a public park.    I think we&#39;re up to  ten or so (in <br/>
batches, not singles that I know of) on the first and zero on the  second.   <br/>
Statistically.<br/>
 <br/>
Baptist and homechooling makes it more dangerous.  If one doesn&#39;t die  of the <br/>
tornado, mom might drown or bash with rock.<br/>
 <br/>
(Humor, but humor based on truth and statistics.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121375701">I am still trying to understand how exactly unschooling works.(I am one of those folks that have been lurking,trying to figure it out.)<br/>
If you don&#39;t set rules,then how do you go about not allowing your children to go about town if you feel they are not mature enough?<br/>
I am like Bob,I just don&#39;t get it!Although it only took him a few days and he got it!<br/>
I have been at it for over a yr,went to the conference last yr,and I still just for the life of me can&#39;t <br/>
seem &quot;to get&quot;how it works. like what if your 4 yr old said Mom,I am going to go to Wal-Mart<br/>
I will be back this afternoon.......how do you do it?<br/>
Call me a fruit cake but I just don&#39;t get it!!<br/>

============<br/>
 <br/>
Not &quot;a certain age,&quot; no.<br/>
 <br/>
We used to live a couple of blocks from a card shop (baseball and gaming  <br/>
cards) and I have a photo of the first time all three of my kids left together,  <br/>
alone. I hope to get it scanned in.  It&#39;s taped up downstairs with that  plan. <br/>
 Looks like Holly was two, so the others would&#39;ve been five and seven  or so. <br/>
 I remember that moment.  I had the phone number where they  were going, and <br/>
could&#39;ve run there in three minutes or driven in one.  But  the symbolism of <br/>
it was huge.  <br/>
 <br/>
The next time that happened was just last fall, when Marty had just started  <br/>
driving alone and went to a card tournament 15 miles away alone, Holly had <br/>
gone  out with a teenaged friend, and Kirby was at work.   All three GONE,  no <br/>
two together.  None with a parent or another family&#39;s parent.   (Turned out <br/>
Holly and the friend ate and then went to hang out where  Kirby worked, so they <br/>
weren&#39;t as scattered in reality as in my  imagination.)<br/>
 <br/>
Different things, different ways.  Rather than have a rule that says  &quot;When <br/>
you&#39;re 12 you can go,&quot; treat each instance on its own merits and  realities, <br/>
and build up as the child gains confidence and ability.<br/>

  True. And just as statistically people are more likely to die of a tornado<br/>
  if they&#39;re Baptist (and Baptists in trailer parks shouldn&#39;t expect to live<br/>
at<br/>
  all)...<br/>
<br/>
  Statistically...<br/>
  Homeschooled kids are more likely (statistically) to be murdered by their<br/>
  mothers than snatched from a public park.    I think we&#39;re up to  ten or<br/>
so (in<br/>
  batches, not singles that I know of) on the first and zero on the  second.<br/>
  Statistically.<br/>
<br/>
  Baptist and homechooling makes it more dangerous.  If one doesn&#39;t die  of<br/>
the<br/>
  tornado, mom might drown or bash with rock.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Rather than using broad definitions or proclamations like &quot;you&#39;re not old  <br/>
enough&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re not mature enough&quot; (condemnations), break it down into the  <br/>
REAL factors.  And don&#39;t wait until a child is ready to go out for  hours.  <br/>
Start with the five minute trips, the twenty minute biked  rides.  It&#39;s not an <br/>
all or nothing thing.<br/>
 <br/>
Are they careful about traffic?<br/>
Do they always let you know where they&#39;ll be and then BE there?<br/>
Would they know what to do in an emergency?<br/>
Will someone be with them?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-like what if your 4 yr old said Mom,I am going to go to Wal-Mart<br/>
I  will be back this afternoon.......-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Has that happened to you?<br/>
I&#39;ve had three four year olds and none of them ever wanted to go off all  <br/>
alone.<br/>
 <br/>
Once someone used the example that without rules and controls, a child  might <br/>
want to get in the car and drive to grandma&#39;s house.  I said simply  that my <br/>
keys are hanging by the door.    Using wild examples  doesn&#39;t help.  <br/>
Speculating wildly only scares the mom and muddies the  waters of logic and of living <br/>
right in the moment.<br/>
 <br/>
And when I say &quot;stop wild thinking,&quot; the accusation comes back that I&#39;m in  <br/>
denial and just don&#39;t want to face &quot;real questions.&quot;  I LOVE to face real  <br/>
questions.  Tell us what your child REALLY wants to do.<br/>

Because of school, I think, because of what school calls reading, people  <br/>
will go to a webpage, move their eyes back and forth as they scroll down, sound  <br/>
the words out in their mind, close the page and say &quot;I read it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s not useful real-world reading for personal benefit.  That&#39;s  tagging <br/>
it school-style.  I&#39;m not saying you&#39;ve done that, but it&#39;s  happened a couple <br/>
of times lately and so I wanted to bring it up in a  conversation where people <br/>
are saying &quot;I really want to get it,&quot; and that MIGHT  be the problem.  Too <br/>
much mental noise, not enough stillness and  acceptance.  People have to stop <br/>
what they&#39;re doing before they can do  something else.  People have to stop <br/>
walking the wrong way before they can  look and decide which new way to go.  <br/>
Trotting along the wrong direction  while calling out over one&#39;s shoulder that they <br/>
don&#39;t understand that other  trail isn&#39;t the way to change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374370694">You have to take each moment as it comes with the children and also know<br/>
your kids. Each child is different as is each circumstance as is each<br/>
household and town.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest now, being a schooled child was different at the ages my two<br/>
middle ones are now. She wanted to go out on her bike alone and ride around.<br/>
At the time, in that neighborhood, I wasn&#39;t comfortable with it. I explained<br/>
that it was my comfort level and not her. With the way she looked at the age<br/>
of 13, her being rather naive and where we lived, she was only able to ride<br/>
up and down the block alone. If I couldn&#39;t walk outside and see her down the<br/>
street, I wasn&#39;t comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
By the time she was 14, things changed a lot. We moved and she grew up<br/>
rather quick. So she was out and about for long walks and bike rides alone.<br/>
She also had a cell phone and was always good about keeping in touch with me<br/>
on her own. She&#39;s 19 now and incredibly responsible and careful. She goes<br/>
out for the whole day taking her 3 younger sisters and brother with her and<br/>
I never worry one bit.<br/>
<br/>
The 3 younger ones are 10, 9 and 4. They don&#39;t ride bikes because they just<br/>
don&#39;t like to. The have scooters but only want to go out and ride them with<br/>
us walking with them. They love walks but never go out alone. They just<br/>
never have asked. They have never been to school and all their friends are<br/>
homeschoolers. They are extremely comfortable being around the family and<br/>
don&#39;t like being much of anywhere alone. My son (10) even declined on<br/>
staying home alone with his dad sleeping in the bedroom and chose to leave<br/>
with his grandma instead. He also doesn&#39;t like to stay up after I&#39;ve gone to<br/>
bed.<br/>
<br/>
All 3 of the younger ones always ask before going out in the yard. They<br/>
generally only go out back, which is completely fenced in with a privacy<br/>
fence. They never just go out. It was a never a rule, it&#39;s just what they<br/>
do. Then again, they ask for a drink of water too. It&#39;s just the way they<br/>
are. Sometimes I wonder why they do ask so much when the answer is never no.<br/>
(as far as eating and going out) That&#39;s just them. And I&#39;m comfortable with<br/>
that. Makes me feel that when they are ready, they will know it.<br/>
<br/>
Every once in awhile they want to go out front alone. Alone being all 3<br/>
together. They ask, and they never go farther than the front sidewalk.<br/>
Again, no rules, just them. So it seems like starting with what is<br/>
comfortable and explaining things at a young age has my children not asking<br/>
for things that would make me wonder what to do. When we go to one<br/>
particular park, where there are lots of woods, the kids all stay together.<br/>
(with friends) All the kids are very careful to stay around the area and at<br/>
least stay with one other person. Us moms joke about how no one would ever<br/>
come and take our kids because if they took one, they would have to take<br/>
them all!!!!<br/>
<br/>
If we go somewhere unfamiliar or large, like a zoo or something, the kids<br/>
know to stay close. If they can&#39;t see me, then I can&#39;t see them. That&#39;s<br/>
something I ask of them and there is never any problem with that. So again,<br/>
each circumstance is handled as it comes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192135598">&quot;If you don&#39;t set rules,then how do you go about not allowing your children to go about town if you feel they are not mature enough?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try to find a way to allow them to do what they want in a way that&#39;s comfortable for you too.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about looking at the principle of safety realistically instead of just arbitrarily saying, &quot;No kid can go farther than the block by himself until he&#39;s 12 years old&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Every time they want to do something might be different.  If there&#39;s a really good reason why you don&#39;t think something&#39;s a good idea, don&#39;t just say no.  Discuss why you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea with them.  See if you can come up with a safer plan together. My kids are used to me trying to find a way to say yes to them, so when I have to say no for safety reasons, they usually think the explanation why I&#39;m saying no makes sense.  We&#39;re usually able to find a happy alternative. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;like what if your 4 yr old said Mom,I am going to go to Wal-Mart<br/>
I will be back this afternoon.......how do you do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you go with him?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I have a plan to walk to wal-mart through the woods.  Dh and I are each going to park a car at wal-mart, then drive home together.  The kids and I are going to hike through the woods (woods are a few blocks from our house) to wal-mart (we&#39;ll come out in the woods behind wal-mart), and go to our car in the parking lot and drive home.  They&#39;re pretty excited about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be wise for my kids to walk to wal-mart by the highway, because the traffic can be pretty heavy.  But if they really wanted to, I&#39;d go with them.  <br/>

&gt; Call me a fruit cake but I just don&#39;t get it!!<br/>
&gt; And folks I REALLY want too!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your not a fruitcake :o)  I still have a hard time with some issues and I <br/>
think I have always been an unschooler.  Well, I was until I lost my nerve and <br/>
sent ds to Kindergarten the first year I would have to account for him.  And I <br/>
only say &quot;think&quot; because it never had a name before it came time to <br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot;.  I had always wanted to homeschool and we have been a family of natural <br/>
learning since day one.  When it came time to think about the &quot;red tape&quot; <br/>
involved, I lost my nerve.  Then got it back after tons of researching.  When I <br/>
researched, I heard the term &quot;unschooler&quot; and I read up on it and realized that it <br/>
described our home in almost all aspects.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I never understood is, why call in un&quot;school&quot;ing?  It still <br/>
contained &quot;school&quot; and that is totally NOT what we do.  Deschool, I get.  Unschool, I <br/>
don&#39;t.  That&#39;s just me.  Life learner, natural learner, freethinker-they&#39;re <br/>
all too wordy, so I guess unschooler works.  I have heard of SOOOO many things <br/>
since I began this &quot;labeled&quot; journey.  Before we had a label, it all seemed <br/>
easier.  When you define yourself, that&#39;s when people ask questions and the <br/>
stories begin.  Most helpful and enlightening, others not so.  <br/>
<br/>
For us it boils down to being there for our kids first and foremost.  We help <br/>
them find answers to their questions.  We never shhh! or demean something <br/>
that is important to them.  Even when I&#39;ve heard about all I can stand of the <br/>
latest cartoon craze or whatever has them all in a blur, I bare with it.  This is <br/>
their time and I want for them to be able to do and feel and see and smell <br/>
and touch and think about whatever pops into their heads.  In the same process <br/>
we still have limits or rules.  We are not so loose that the kids would be in <br/>
danger or disruptive to others.  We help them make choices, we set examples.  <br/>
<br/>
An example of our &quot;rules&quot;, (never written or set in stone, but used):<br/>
<br/>
Eating:  Please try everything, but you never have to eat anything you don&#39;t <br/>
want to. <br/>
<br/>
Bathroom things:  We bathe, brush, wash everyday.  We just don&#39;t have a set <br/>
schedule.  If the kids hang out in pj&#39;s the whole day-cool.  Eventually we will <br/>
wash up.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning up:  We put away our stuff to make room for more stuff.  If said <br/>
stuff is still being used or we&#39;re coming back later, so be it.  Dishes and <br/>
things, when we&#39;re done, we wash.  If we&#39;re in the middle of something then it can <br/>
wait but if not we do it real quick so there&#39;s lots of time later to do other <br/>
things without interruption.  I am needed 24/7 and if I have a ton of dishes <br/>
or chores, then I&#39;m not as available as they or I like.  So we or I do little <br/>
bits here and there.  Mine are 7 and 3.5;  they don&#39;t really do chores.  But <br/>
they sure do like to help.  They may not when they&#39;re older and figured out it&#39;s <br/>
work and not just spashin&#39; in the sink or making baskets with dirty clothes <br/>
into the washer.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtimes:  Pretty loose.  We&#39;ve never had bedtimes.  My youngest says he&#39;s <br/>
tired or he&#39;ll ask if it&#39;s time for bed yet.  My older one goes in his room when <br/>
we go to bed and he reads or draws or plays quietly.  He&#39;s been doing that a <br/>
long time and every now and then if I come out, his lights are always out <br/>
within an hour or two.  He gets up on his own as does his brother.  They both know <br/>
that we try to have quiet time if others are sleeping.  We do that and they <br/>
do that.  We try to be respectful of others.  It&#39;s not a perfect world but it <br/>
sure is close :o)<br/>
<br/>
Just examples of how I think.  If my 3.5 year old said I am going to Walmart, <br/>
I&#39;d say hey do you want a ride?  He&#39;d probably giggle and we&#39;d talk about how <br/>
far away it is and the dangerous streets and all that jazz.  Would I let <br/>
him-hell no!!  Would I talk to him and probably even take him-hell yes.  <br/>
<br/>
Same with anything.  Sometimes they want to watch something I wouldn&#39;t pick <br/>
for them and I&#39;d love to say no but I end up just watching with them or I might <br/>
say I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like that and give them some other things to watch or <br/>
ideas to do and if after all that they still want to, then I say go for it-if <br/>
they want to that badly then it&#39;s a desire that should be met if it&#39;s not <br/>
unbelievably drastic.<br/>
<br/>
What is unbelievably drastic in my home may be worse in yours or less so.  <br/>
That&#39;s the biggest thing of all.  What others do doesn&#39;t have to be what you do.<br/>
<br/>
In my neighborhood, I don&#39;t let my 7 year old out alone because we have a <br/>
very busy street on one side.  He also doesn&#39;t know anyone on our street.  And <br/>
he&#39;s actually never asked to go outside.  We are always at parks or activities <br/>
or museums and such.  If he asked, I&#39;d say yeah and I&#39;d go too.  When I knew he <br/>
felt comfortable with the streets and all that, I&#39;d probably let him go <br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
To me unschooling means saying yes a lot.  Being there for them.  Opening <br/>
doors and/or showing them answers until they can open them or answer them on <br/>
their own.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this got so long, I haven&#39;t posted much lately and I thought I could <br/>
help on this one.  Responding like this helps remind me of things too.  Like <br/>
when I loose my patience or feel overwhelmed or I am in need of a mom-only day.  <br/>
I can look back and remember what it&#39;s all for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-437670398"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like what if your 4 yr old said Mom,I am going to go to Wal-Mart<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will be back this afternoon.......how do you do it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would walk there with the child and point out various things on the way - safe places to cross streets, where to walk if there is no sidewalk, why it is usually recommended that walkers face traffic, etc.  Does your 4 yr old really want to walk to Wal-Mart?  Maybe they just want to GET to Wal-Mart.  Maybe the child would be just as happy to have you drive there.<br/>
<br/>
Due to increased development resulting in a change in roads in our area, it is now feasible to walk to a Wal-Mart from my house.  There is also a convenience store/gas station within walking distance, but out of the &quot;safety&quot; of the neighborhood.  My 12 yod has been wanting to walk to the convenience store with friends, without me.  A couple weeks ago, my girls and I did the walk together, talking about the things I described above.  Part of the walk has no shoulder on a 2 lane road with 40 mph speed limit.  However, because of the new road diverting much of the traffic, the road with no shoulder is mostly pretty quiet.  Lisa thought it was OK to walk right next to the edge of the pavement when cars come.  I explained to her that although cars are supposed to stay on the road, they may end up on the shoulder for a number of reasons.  We talked about how near/far to the edge was a good amount to stay safe.  There are some houses and a pre-fab housing development along the way.  Yesterday, she and her friend walked there together.  Her friend carried a cell phone.  I am not ready to let my 9 yo do the same walk without me.  I have no logical reason - she is very cautious about traffic, etc.  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  If she asks to walk there with a friend, I will ask if I can go with them.  If they want to feel that they are on their own, I&#39;ll offer to walk a bit behind them, or something.  However, she has not asked to do so.  I need to arrange to walk to Wal-Mart with Lisa sometime soon, to see how feasible that is.  The route that we would walk is not the same way that we would drive there.  It is between 1 and 1 1/2 miles.   In this case, it is that she wants the experience of going somewhere independently.  She knows I would drive her there if her actual goal was to just be there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a related note about keeping our children safe when we are not with them, I will share an incident that happened here this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
My neighborhood homeowner&#39;s association organized a giant yard sale Saturday morning.  People set up in their own yard, and buyers had the convenience of lots of yard sales all in one neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
One of my neighbors, who is the mother of one of Lisa&#39;s best friends, had a miscommunication with her husband and dd.  The 11 yod and a friend left with the dad while the mom was bathing, but mom had thought the girls would be waiting to go with her.  When she was ready, and couldn&#39;t find the girls, and couldn&#39;t contact her husband on his cell phone, she feared the two girls had been abducted while walking around the neighborhood because of all the increased traffic from the yard sales.  She called here to ask if I&#39;d seen them.  I told her that the girls were too smart to just get in someone&#39;s car, but she feared that perhaps the abductor had a gun.  Story ends well (after she calls the police) when she discovers they were with dad all along and had really thought mom had heard when they said they were leaving with him.  The mom and I talked about it later that day.  She is a teacher and gets to look at the poster of local registered sex offenders every time she goes in the teacher&#39;s lounge and is frightened by it.  Strangers driving around looking for kids is one of my neighbor&#39;s constant fears.  She is always living on the side of fear rather than the side of caution.  Her 11 yod is literally afraid when she sees an unknown car in our neighborhood.  My children do not have this &quot;fear&quot;, because I&#39;ve always approached the idea of &quot;strangers&quot; as how to interact with people we don&#39;t know - not to just blindly avoid them because they may be dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
We discussed the incident about Lisa&#39;s friend at dinner last night - Pat, Lisa, Jackie, and I.  I said that it is highly unlikely that they would be abducted by strangers, but I wanted to talk about it since the subject had just come up with one of their friends.  I told Lisa that it is easier for me to let her do things without me if I am confident that she will be able to take care of herself - that she has and will use good judgment about how to react in various scenarios.  I explained that it is my job to keep her safe, that I would be devastated if something did happen, and that if she has children someday, she will understand.  I pointed out that if someone in a car stops and asks the child if they&#39;ve seen their lost pet, it is most likely that they really are looking for their lost pet.  However, it is still good to be cautious, avoid going too close to the car, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I had never mentioned gun point before, but did this time, again, because of the incident with the neighbor.  She had feared that her daughter would get in the car if someone had a gun, rather than risk the people shooting her if she ran off.  So I asked my kids what they would do if someone in a car had a gun.  Jackie (9) said she didn&#39;t know.  Lisa wasn&#39;t sure either.  I said that you are always safer to get away from the person with the gun.  Then I said again how unlikely it was to happen, that it had never happened to me or anyone I know.  When I think about it this morning, I see that it really is just adding more detail to what we&#39;ve always told them they should do in a scary situation - just get away.  I&#39;m kind of sorry that I brought it up, because Lisa was visibly upset by the conversation.  OTOH, she spends a lot of time with this other girl and it is likely that the topic will come up in some way when they are together.  I&#39;d rather my dds be aware that these situations are extremely unlikely, and have an idea of how to react, so that if the topic comes up when they are with the neighbor they won&#39;t become paranoid about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312388076">See....I shouldn&#39;t have sit here just reading what ever question someone else had for you guys.<br/>
Instead I should have got off my duff and asked what I needed to know,cuz this does make sense to me.<br/>
So if I feel uncomfotable saying yes,then I should look for a way to say yes that makes me and the kiddos happy.Is that correct?<br/>
Thank you Sheila,You will never know just how much that helped this old dog that is trying SO very hard to learn some new tricks.<br/>
Love~Pat<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you don&#39;t set rules,then how do you go about not allowing your children to go about town if you feel they are not mature enough?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Try to find a way to allow them to do what they want in a way that&#39;s comfortable for you too.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about looking at the principle of safety realistically instead of just arbitrarily saying, &quot;No kid can go farther than the block by himself until he&#39;s 12 years old&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Every time they want to do something might be different.  If there&#39;s a really good reason why you don&#39;t think something&#39;s a good idea, don&#39;t just say no.  Discuss why you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea with them.  See if you can come up with a safer plan together. My kids are used to me trying to find a way to say yes to them, so when I have to say no for safety reasons, they usually think the explanation why I&#39;m saying no makes sense.  We&#39;re usually able to find a happy alternative. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;like what if your 4 yr old said Mom,I am going to go to Wal-Mart<br/>
I will be back this afternoon.......how do you do it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can you go with him?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I have a plan to walk to wal-mart through the woods.  Dh and I are each going to park a car at wal-mart, then drive home together.  The kids and I are going to hike through the woods (woods are a few blocks from our house) to wal-mart (we&#39;ll come out in the woods behind wal-mart), and go to our car in the parking lot and drive home.  They&#39;re pretty excited about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it would be wise for my kids to walk to wal-mart by the highway, because the traffic can be pretty heavy.  But if they really wanted to, I&#39;d go with them.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827819414">Thank You very much Maryellen,<br/>
I shared your story with my 14 and 9 yr old,we had just had this conversation this morning.<br/>
It really helped us alot.I only have joint custody of my 14 yr old.He spends half his time with his Mom(my ex dil)and he goes to ps.<br/>
She lets him run the streets all hrs of the night and so I try to talk to him about it when I can.<br/>
I will continue to talk to him,but since reading your post I will now have a whole new approach.<br/>
Love~Pat<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;like what if your 4 yr old said Mom,I am going to go to Wal-Mart<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I will be back this afternoon.......how do you do it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would walk there with the child and point out various things on the way - safe places to cross streets, where to walk if there is no sidewalk, why it is usually recommended that walkers face traffic, etc.  Does your 4 yr old really want to walk to Wal-Mart?  Maybe they just want to GET to Wal-Mart.  Maybe the child would be just as happy to have you drive there.<br/>
<br/>
Due to increased development resulting in a change in roads in our area, it is now feasible to walk to a Wal-Mart from my house.  There is also a convenience store/gas station within walking distance, but out of the &quot;safety&quot; of the neighborhood.  My 12 yod has been wanting to walk to the convenience store with friends, without me.  A couple weeks ago, my girls and I did the walk together, talking about the things I described above.  Part of the walk has no shoulder on a 2 lane road with 40 mph speed limit.  However, because of the new road diverting much of the traffic, the road with no shoulder is mostly pretty quiet.  Lisa thought it was OK to walk right next to the edge of the pavement when cars come.  I explained to her that although cars are supposed to stay on the road, they may end up on the shoulder for a number of reasons.  We talked about how near/far to the edge was a good amount to stay safe.  There are some houses and a pre-fab housing development along the way. <br/>
 Yesterday, she and her friend walked there together.  Her friend carried a cell phone.  I am not ready to let my 9 yo do the same walk without me.  I have no logical reason - she is very cautious about traffic, etc.  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  If she asks to walk there with a friend, I will ask if I can go with them.  If they want to feel that they are on their own, I&#39;ll offer to walk a bit behind them, or something.  However, she has not asked to do so.  I need to arrange to walk to Wal-Mart with Lisa sometime soon, to see how feasible that is.  The route that we would walk is not the same way that we would drive there.  It is between 1 and 1 1/2 miles.   In this case, it is that she wants the experience of going somewhere independently.  She knows I would drive her there if her actual goal was to just be there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On a related note about keeping our children safe when we are not with them, I will share an incident that happened here this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
My neighborhood homeowner&#39;s association organized a giant yard sale Saturday morning.  People set up in their own yard, and buyers had the convenience of lots of yard sales all in one neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
One of my neighbors, who is the mother of one of Lisa&#39;s best friends, had a miscommunication with her husband and dd.  The 11 yod and a friend left with the dad while the mom was bathing, but mom had thought the girls would be waiting to go with her.  When she was ready, and couldn&#39;t find the girls, and couldn&#39;t contact her husband on his cell phone, she feared the two girls had been abducted while walking around the neighborhood because of all the increased traffic from the yard sales.  She called here to ask if I&#39;d seen them.  I told her that the girls were too smart to just get in someone&#39;s car, but she feared that perhaps the abductor had a gun.  Story ends well (after she calls the police) when she discovers they were with dad all along and had really thought mom had heard when they said they were leaving with him.  The mom and I talked about it later that day.  She is a teacher and gets to look at the poster of local registered sex offenders every time she goes in the teacher&#39;s<br/>
 lounge and is frightened by it.  Strangers driving around looking for kids is one of my neighbor&#39;s constant fears.  She is always living on the side of fear rather than the side of caution.  Her 11 yod is literally afraid when she sees an unknown car in our neighborhood.  My children do not have this &quot;fear&quot;, because I&#39;ve always approached the idea of &quot;strangers&quot; as how to interact with people we don&#39;t know - not to just blindly avoid them because they may be dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
We discussed the incident about Lisa&#39;s friend at dinner last night - Pat, Lisa, Jackie, and I.  I said that it is highly unlikely that they would be abducted by strangers, but I wanted to talk about it since the subject had just come up with one of their friends.  I told Lisa that it is easier for me to let her do things without me if I am confident that she will be able to take care of herself - that she has and will use good judgment about how to react in various scenarios.  I explained that it is my job to keep her safe, that I would be devastated if something did happen, and that if she has children someday, she will understand.  I pointed out that if someone in a car stops and asks the child if they&#39;ve seen their lost pet, it is most likely that they really are looking for their lost pet.  However, it is still good to be cautious, avoid going too close to the car, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I had never mentioned gun point before, but did this time, again, because of the incident with the neighbor.  She had feared that her daughter would get in the car if someone had a gun, rather than risk the people shooting her if she ran off.  So I asked my kids what they would do if someone in a car had a gun.  Jackie (9) said she didn&#39;t know.  Lisa wasn&#39;t sure either.  I said that you are always safer to get away from the person with the gun.  Then I said again how unlikely it was to happen, that it had never happened to me or anyone I know.  When I think about it this morning, I see that it really is just adding more detail to what we&#39;ve always told them they should do in a scary situation - just get away.  I&#39;m kind of sorry that I brought it up, because Lisa was visibly upset by the conversation.  OTOH, she spends a lot of time with this other girl and it is likely that the topic will come up in some way when they are together.  I&#39;d rather my dds be aware that these situations<br/>
 are extremely unlikely, and have an idea of how to react, so that if the topic comes up when they are with the neighbor they won&#39;t become paranoid about it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to ask a little more specifically.  We were doing fine <br/>
with this.  We have lived in various places and my children have had <br/>
freedom based on the situation.  Ds is almost 11 and dd is 7.  When <br/>
we lived in the downtown area of a large city with very interesting <br/>
neighbors they had less freedom than when we lived in an apartment <br/>
in the suburbs. <br/>
<br/>
The problem we&#39;re having now is that we moved into the country on <br/>
the end of a dirt road.  We loved it here and the children were free <br/>
to ride their bikes all over our neighborhood.  But we just recently <br/>
found out that a convicted sex offender has moved in a block away!  <br/>
We are researching our options with the authorities, but we have <br/>
felt the necessity to limit their bike riding.  I even feel <br/>
uncomfortable now letting them go to the end of our road to check <br/>
the mail, which is on the main road where this man lives.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;m being paranoid, but would like to hear others opinions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739191418">But this is really how things are with my 9 yr old!!! He is the one that climbed ontop of McDonalds restaraunt at 18 mths.<br/>
DHR took him,placed him in foster care and had to go get him every day and find him a new foster home.For 5 days that went on.They called us to come get him.It was not my daughters fault.(This happened before I adopted)<br/>
He has left our home in the middle of the night at 2 yrs old.We have had neighbors come banging on the door in the middle of the night because he was on the top of their house.<br/>
DHR thought they were so brilliant to have him hospitalized because we were neglecting him.<br/>
NO he was born this way to my 16 yr old daughter.<br/>
No,She didn&#39;t use drugs or alcohol.She was homeschooled.(not unschooled)<br/>
My grandsons father was 17,his Mom had just commited suicide when he was concieved.<br/>
After the babies birth and finding we had a combination Bam-Bam/Dennis the Menice on our hands we started researching.I have a whole new education now in mental illness.<br/>
I have bipolar all thru my family and always just thought thats the way things were.<br/>
My GS&#39;s father has bipolar as did his grandmom,so does hisgrandad and his aunt.<br/>
When my grandson was 6 and his baby brother was 2 we were all painting bird feeders outside.<br/>
My sil(his dad) had been riding the 4 wheeler.He got off to go to the bathroom,when Elijah put his baby brother on the 4 wheeler and drove off up the mtn.<br/>
And no we didn&#39;t see it coming,one minute he was all into painting his very own bird feeder the next he is gone.This kind of stuff has happened every since this child has been in the world.<br/>
I had never known of any child like this before him and I have never met another.<br/>
But I will tell you this,I would not trade any of my experiences with him,I have learned much more from him in his 9 yrs on this earth than I learned in all my other 39 yrs before he was born.<br/>
But as he gets older he is not quite as impulsive.He is maturing and is realizing that dangers do exist.<br/>

<br/>
Has that happened to you?<br/>
I&#39;ve had three four year olds and none of them ever wanted to go off all  <br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
Once someone used the example that without rules and controls, a child  might <br/>
want to get in the car and drive to grandma&#39;s house.  I said simply  that my <br/>
keys are hanging by the door.    Using wild examples  doesn&#39;t help.  <br/>
Speculating wildly only scares the mom and muddies the  waters of logic and of living <br/>
right in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
And when I say &quot;stop wild thinking,&quot; the accusation comes back that I&#39;m in  <br/>
denial and just don&#39;t want to face &quot;real questions.&quot;  I LOVE to face real  <br/>
questions.  Tell us what your child REALLY wants to do.<br/>

There&#39;s a link there to an article Danielle Conger had published, and if  you <br/>
read those things don&#39;t skim them and say &quot;read them.&quot;  Read a line a  day, <br/>
if you have to, to let it sink in and to see how it fits in YOUR  life.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of school, I think, because of what school calls reading, people  <br/>
will go to a webpage, move their eyes back and forth as they scroll down, sound  <br/>
the words out in their mind, close the page and say &quot;I read it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not useful real-world reading for personal benefit.  That&#39;s  tagging <br/>
it school-style.  I&#39;m not saying you&#39;ve done that, but it&#39;s  happened a couple <br/>
of times lately and so I wanted to bring it up in a  conversation where people <br/>
are saying &quot;I really want to get it,&quot; and that MIGHT  be the problem.  Too <br/>
much mental noise, not enough stillness and  acceptance.  People have to stop <br/>
what they&#39;re doing before they can do  something else.  People have to stop <br/>
walking the wrong way before they can  look and decide which new way to go.  <br/>
Trotting along the wrong direction  while calling out over one&#39;s shoulder that they <br/>
don&#39;t understand that other  trail isn&#39;t the way to change.<br/>

Rather than continue to feel alone in this, have you heard of Anne Ohman&#39;s<br/>

We are  researching our options with the authorities, but we have <br/>
felt the  necessity to limit their bike riding.  I even feel <br/>
uncomfortable now  letting them go to the end of our road to check <br/>
the mail, which is on the  main road where this man lives.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think I&#39;m being paranoid,  but would like to hear others opinions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have had 2 recent cases too close by in Florida recently. Both girls  were <br/>
murdered by sex offenders.  Neither were out riding bikes but they  were 9 <br/>
and 13 and  it&#39;s scary.  If I knew a sex offender lived in  my neighborhood, my <br/>
kids would be in the company of an adult if they were out  riding their bikes. <br/>
 It&#39;s a known that he is there.  That&#39;s way beyond  my comfort level and I <br/>
think you have to decide your own comfort level.   I&#39;d push it with the <br/>
authorities to see what rights you do have. <br/>
 <br/>
My kids ride bikes close by and my daughter (15) runs a 3 mile loop in our  <br/>
neighborhood.  It was a process to get there.  We all needed to get  <br/>
comfortable  and it started out with us running together.  She still  calls me if she <br/>
goes for a run and I&#39;m out doing errands.  She carries a  cell phone.  I check <br/>
the sex offender listings...none here right now that  are registered.  It&#39;s <br/>
what works for us.  I think if you are  uncomfortable with them riding their <br/>
bikes alone knowing he is there, that you  should honor your feelings.  Ride with <br/>
them...take them   somewhere else and ride together.  Find other options in <br/>
your neighborhood  for now.<br/>
I think you have a unique situation.  There are good reason sex  offenders <br/>
are supposed to register.  If one has, I&#39;d be extra  cautious.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928181722">Registered just means they have been caught.  I&#39;m not sure that it should really change your behavior, because ones who haven&#39;t been caught could possibly be there anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986215720">I struggle with letting them walk alone or explore on a daily <br/>
basis!  It really isn&#39;t entirely the same world as it used to be 30 <br/>
years ago when I was enjoying my &quot;freedom&quot;.  When things happen now, <br/>
they are a lot more...intense.<br/>
<br/>
In our town, we have a prison for sexual offenders about 2 miles <br/>
down the road.  When they get out, some of them stick around town.  <br/>
Yippee!  I have 3 level 3&#39;s (all child related) living within a one <br/>
mile radius of my home.  So it&#39;s a very real threat and we are <br/>
careful, but try to also keep in mind that our children deserve to <br/>
live without irrational fear of the unknown.  It&#39;s hard to balance <br/>
and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve made mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 year old is not as interested in exploring for the sake of it <br/>
as she used to be, she&#39;d rather I drove her somewhere!  Bikes aren&#39;t <br/>
even an issue with us, my dds don&#39;t really like them and my ds is 7 <br/>
and happy with the driveway.  But my 10yo dd is very interested in <br/>
walking to the store by herself, etc.  I used to let her sister at <br/>
her age (although I admit I watched secretly with binoculars a few <br/>
times in the beginning), but my younger dd is much more child-like <br/>
than my older daughter was, and she tends to panic over things more <br/>
easily.  So my instinct is that it&#39;s not time yet for her to walk <br/>
somewhere by herself.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I always feel a lot better about is letting either of them <br/>
walk around with a. another friend(s) or b. in a public place (no <br/>
backstreets, etc.).  Rules like don&#39;t go into the bathroom alone, <br/>
don&#39;t go behind buildings, that type of thing.  Cell phone at all <br/>
times.  I find that the girls are pretty comfortable and happy with <br/>
being able to be on their own in stores, malls, movies, amusement <br/>
parks, etc. and don&#39;t have as much interest in just walking around <br/>
town.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ll have them run into the supermarket, bank, etc. for me <br/>
instead of taking in the whole gang.  They really like doing that!  <br/>
I get a lot of comments from folks, good and bad, mostly very good, <br/>
about my 10yo doing the shopping herself.  But she LOVES it and <br/>
she&#39;s really good at it and it gives her that sense of freedom(?) or <br/>
maturity(?) she is striving for by being alone.  They all ask to do <br/>
the store errands now!  And for the record, she shops like a pro..no <br/>
carriage mishaps, very polite, calls me about substitutions, asks <br/>
the butcher when she can&#39;t find eye of the round (unlike hubby who <br/>
will just bring home chuck roast). <br/>
<br/>
So maybe bringing your children someplace that they can test the <br/>
waters (like driving them to Walmart and letting them go solo from <br/>
the parking lot) is a good place to start, both for you and the <br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>

Actually no. The first little girl was living with her grandparents and her<br/>
father. Her mother lived away in another state. She was taken from her<br/>
bedroom by a sex offender the family didn&#39;t know. He took the little girl<br/>
just across the street where he was staying with relatives.<br/>
<br/>
The second little girl had a habit of taking off for a day. She was killed<br/>
in her own home by her mother&#39;s ex boyfriend who was a sex offender. Her<br/>
mother was away and she was home with her brother, who was not there at the<br/>
time of the murder.<br/>

Okay.  Sorry if I mixed up the two stories.  I thought only one was taken <br/>
from her home and the other disappeared while out and about.<br/>
<br/>
If we simply keep our children in the house because there are sex offenders <br/>
in the world, they will miss riding bikes and playing with neighbors and <br/>
learning to be careful and cautious.  Then when they&#39;re older and are really tired <br/>

<br/>
Helping children always make safer choices helps in EVERY way, in every <br/>
situation, not just with registered sex offender neighbors.  Making rules about <br/>
particular dangers is living by rules and not principles in a HUGE way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110219354">That was the 13 year old who disappeared and was killed, and no one reported her missing until 2 days later. They assumed she&#39;d gone to a friend&#39;s house, they said. They hadn&#39;t actually seen her since before she went on the church field trip, so it had been many days, more than two. That seems like the real problem, to me. I do know where my kid is, she tells me. She&#39;s pretty free to go places, but I&#39;m involved and know what&#39;s going on, too. I can&#39;t imagine not touching base via cell phone for days...<br/>
