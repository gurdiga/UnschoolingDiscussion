<div id="ygrps-yiv-308509910">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s election time here in Japan, and you know what that means: more <br/>
clouding of the real issues at hand, tons of promises, and little or no <br/>
action taken to address the problems once all the noise is over.<br/>
<br/>
Following is a newspaper editorial in today&#39;s Japan Times newspaper that <br/>
gives some idea of what those in official circles are thinking during <br/>
this election campaign about child-related crime.<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;official circles&quot; because despite its independent status, the <br/>
Japan Times is well-known for historically having a very cozy <br/>
relationship with the Japanese government. The paper has dutifully earned <br/>
its reputation as the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; of Japan&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs <br/>
on just about every economic and political issue you can name. One of the <br/>
newspaper&#39;s past presidents, Mr. Shintaro Fukushima, in fact, has <br/>
formerly served as Japan&#39;s ambassador to the United Nations.<br/>
<br/>
But for what it&#39;s worth, here&#39;s the editorial. Not too surprisingly, the <br/>
article never delves into the influence that Japan&#39;s oppressive school <br/>
system has on the psyches of these so-called &quot;young miscreants.&quot; Oh well, <br/>
maybe in the next election....<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I hear a campaign soundtruck coming up the <br/>
street, and I must go outside and get my daily dose of noise pollution. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

AGE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With the volume favored by candidates&#39; loudspeaker cars, it can be <br/>
difficult to tell what issues they are addressing in the campaign leading <br/>
up to Sunday&#39;s election for the House of Representatives. Both the ruling <br/>
and opposition parties are engaging in the usual name-calling and <br/>
sloganeering and not giving more than superficial attention to some of <br/>
the main concerns of potential voters. One of these is the rising tide of <br/>
juvenile violence that parents, school authorities and the police all <br/>
seem powerless to control.<br/>
<br/>
A number of heinous incidents this year have all involved 17-year-olds. <br/>
But as each day&#39;s news brings a fresh report of yet another case of <br/>
youthful criminal behavior, the age level of the perpetrators has dropped <br/>
to as low as 15 or even 14. Meanwhile, all the political parties are <br/>
mainly concentrating on the idea of lowering the age at which young <br/>
people legally become adults to 18 from the present 20. Prime Minister <br/>
Yoshiro Mori, campaigning nationwide for the Liberal Democratic Party and <br/>
its partners in the governing coalition, is having some success in <br/>
controlling his tendency to make provocative statements that embroil him <br/>
in instant controversy. He is putting the emphasis in stump speeches on <br/>
reducing the age at which minors can be tried in criminal courts for <br/>
serious offenses from 16 to 14.<br/>
<br/>
This appears to be what all the parties have in mind, in the wake of the <br/>
public&#39;s disappointment at the failure of the regular Diet session, which <br/>
ended June 2, not only to pass but even to discuss the widely heralded <br/>
bill aimed at revising the Juvenile Law to better deal with the increase <br/>
in youthful crimes of violence. As a result, the bill was scrapped.<br/>
<br/>
The present Juvenile Law, which came into effect in 1949, stresses the <br/>
rehabilitation of young wrongdoers. The Family Court has jurisdiction <br/>
over cases involving young people under 20. Serious cases involving <br/>
youths 16 or older can be referred to prosecutors for handling in a <br/>
criminal court, although until recently this has rarely occurred. <br/>
Juveniles under the age of 14 who engage in acts that legally would be <br/>
considered criminal offenses are referred to a special consultation <br/>
office for children. But as the level of youthful violence has escalated, <br/>
and the types of crimes perpetrated have become more serious, many people <br/>
now believe the law is too lenient.<br/>
<br/>
Young people in Japan today certainly are more physically mature than <br/>
their counterparts of half a century ago. They also are more <br/>
sophisticated, thanks to rapid developments in mass communications and <br/>
the influence of unsavory elements in the media. Whether they are more <br/>
mature emotionally is debatable. Many are clever enough to admit, if <br/>
challenged, that they are sometimes tempted into risky behavior by the <br/>
knowledge that they will be treated lightly if they happen to get caught.<br/>
<br/>
If the youth of Japan are to be empowered to vote from the age of 18, a <br/>
step many other nations have already taken, then it stands to reason that <br/>
the Juvenile Law should be revised to apply to young people under that <br/>
age. Before this is done, however, any proposed revisions must be <br/>
discussed and debated in detail, with testimony provided by educators and <br/>
law-enforcement officials. Voters should not allow politicians to fall <br/>
back on hollow promises. Vague suggestions of cracking down on teenage <br/>
criminal behavior do not solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The issue is not simply the age of the culprits. The larger question is <br/>
why so many young people in this country now resort to violence so <br/>
easily. A recent survey of male junior and senior high school students by <br/>
the Management and Coordination Agency found that the older they are the <br/>
more likely they are to consider physically attacking their parents or <br/>
teachers. The National Police Agency has just reported that police <br/>
throughout the nation arrested 31 male juveniles suspected of murder or <br/>
attempted murder from the beginning of this year through the end of <br/>
April, double the number in the same period of 1999.<br/>
<br/>
It is all too easy, however, to use the threat of severer punishments as <br/>
a cure-all. Some youthful lawbreakers deserve and require time in <br/>
juvenile reformatories, or possibly even in adult prisons. The motives <br/>
for the violence and the warning signs that are often ignored by parents <br/>
and teachers need to be considered. Too-hasty moves to incarcerate young <br/>
miscreants with adult offenders will only succeed in turning more of them <br/>
into hardened criminals.<br/>
