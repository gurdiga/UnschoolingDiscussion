Well all  that money they were spending on enrichment and giftedness can now <br/>
be  spent on more programmed teaching programs where the teacher reads from <br/>
the  <br/>
manual and no creativity is involved.   Oh!   Then  they can hire all cheaper <br/>
teachers too.   Minimum wage, and  dispense with all that &quot;master teacher <br/>
program&quot; crap, because in fact the  better the teacher, the less likely she <br/>
will be <br/>
to go along with the new  order of education and will have to be disposed of <br/>
to <br/>
keep the  peace.<br/>

Robots.  We only need robots.  I think the techonology has come  along to <br/>
make it possible, don&#39;t you?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I listened to an interview on the radio yesterday about artificial  <br/>
intelligence and robots. Seems that there are two ways robots can  <br/>
become &quot;intelligent.&quot; One is a top-down method -- lines and lines of  <br/>
computer programming giving the robot ALL the possible information it  <br/>
could ever need to know. This is VERY limiting and nobody thinks this  <br/>
is the direction that will really work, in the future, other than for  <br/>
very limited purposes.<br/>
The other is building the ability to learn into the robot so that it  <br/>
responds to &quot;bumping into its environment&quot; by creating its OWN  <br/>
programming. This is the way real intelligence happens and the way  <br/>
humans really learn, It is unpredictable and exciting.<br/>
<br/>
UNSCHOOLED robots! YEAH!<br/>

If education were only a matter of acquiring facts, computer programs could do the job just fine.<br/>
