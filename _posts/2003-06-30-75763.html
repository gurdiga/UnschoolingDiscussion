&gt;  &gt;The way they define slavery is someone who is:<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Controlled by violence or the threat of violence,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;Forced to work for no pay,<br/>
&gt;  &gt;having their labor used for the economic gain of another.<br/>
&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Practically every child in public school would fall into THAT category!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As I say this, keep in mind that I have recently been to a workshop where <br/>
they showed a video that depicted contemporary, very real slavery of human <br/>
beings, including pictures of people who have been beaten, whipped, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Enforced poverty and, most of the time, kids in school can be very <br/>
oppressive, and are certainly not good things. They are NOT the same as the stuff in the <br/>
workshop I attended. I think what startled me was how many people, in an age, <br/>
where slavery is illegal across most of the world, really are living in real <br/>
slavery. If a kid in school or someone in a very low-end job tries to run <br/>
away, they are not beaten or killed.  Their oppressors generally can&#39;t sell them, <br/>
as if they were a chair.<br/>

I know you can&#39;t possibly go into full detail of all you learned from your <br/>
workshop, but could you give a few details about where and how slavery is still  <br/>
used today?.  I do not doubt the claim, I just am not familar with the <br/>
dynamics slavery today.   Is it in the USA?  where?  how?   Or more in 3rd world <br/>
countries?    I am going to do some googling research myself, because I find this <br/>
a fascinating topic, appalling, yet intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
