<div id="ygrps-yiv-636820235">Your sister is behaving rudely, your daughter&#39;s behaviour is perfectly normal <br/>
for a 3 year old. If your relatives want to have a good relationship with her <br/>
in the future they should be encouraged to back off with her now.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too much to expect a three year old to be able to respond to a <br/>
persistent questioner with &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk right now, please.&quot; It&#39;s not too much <br/>
for adults to be expected to give a child some space without pestering them.<br/>
<br/>
An adult gently greeting a child and being given a nasty reply is different <br/>
from an adult pestering a child repeatedly when the child is not responding. <br/>
It&#39;s teasing and it&#39;s not nice.<br/>
