<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149565957"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; And - SHEESH - imagine teaching musical notation to a kid who hasn&#39;t ever<br/>
&gt; heard music?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Schools teach math to kids who have no equivalent of having &quot;heard music&quot;.<br/>
&gt; They have no relevant context.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now here&#39;s the scary part -- I have 2 degrees in music, and was never<br/>
required to take any math courses.  I understood all the computational<br/>
rules, but back then, I didn&#39;t have a clue of the reasons behind it all.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm, do you think the fact that I didn&#39;t really understand fractions might<br/>
possibly explain all the problems I had with rhythm my first couple years of<br/>
college music classes?  (sigh)<br/>
