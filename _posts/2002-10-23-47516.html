<div id="ygrps-yiv-383438719">&lt;&lt;Hopefully this helps with some of your questions&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Dorothy, it does.  I have found an organization (I contacted them as<br/>
soon as I found out we were having puppies) and they agreed to evaluate the<br/>
dogs for their program at 9 months.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing the socialization thing.  The dogs ride in the car, go to<br/>
baseball games, spend time with our rabbits, goats and chickens, go for<br/>
walks.  I&#39;m hoping to spend more time taking them into the city soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114755279">&lt;&lt;you could place them as pets&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that has been plan A all along with plan B being the service<br/>
organization (I did talk with one that is willing to evaluate the dog and my<br/>
Dad has contacts with the drug dogs in Texas) and having them as our pets is<br/>
plan C.  We live in a semi-rural area just north of San Antonio, prime<br/>
dog-dumping real estate so finding homes for pups is tough.  Of course, the<br/>
only people we&#39;ve had ask about them are people I wouldn&#39;t give a cat too<br/>
much less a dog  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
The limited interaction with other dogs is tricky around here.  But I&#39;ll see<br/>
what I can do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the insight.<br/>

Okay I&#39;m really tired here so consider the source. Reminds me of the old <br/>
joke about a guy finding a monkey and his friend asks him if he took him to <br/>
the zoo and the guy said yes, and they had to much fun, they&#39;re going to the <br/>
baseball game tomorrow!!<br/>

eating hot dogs and talking about their big trip to the city!!!)<br/>
