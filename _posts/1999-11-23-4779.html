<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118009835">hi,<br/>
<br/>
the perfect unschooler&#39;s college<br/>
is life.<br/>
<br/>
i think goddard holds this belief as well:<br/>
&#39;graduate program in teacher education emphasizes alternative, progressive and<br/>
holistic approaches.  all graduate as well as undergraduate programs regard<br/>
each student as a unique individual in charge of his or her own learning.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
i had heard about goddard when i was 17/18 (the mid &#39;70&#39;s)  but never went and<br/>
then last night i ran across this &#39;blurb&#39; in the back of a new mag   &#39;paths of<br/>
learning&#39;  options for families and communities.  this mag has an article<br/>
entitled  &#39;john holt and the origins of contemporary homeschooling&#39; by patrick<br/>
farenga.   mr farenga says  &#39;holt asks parents to respect children and allow<br/>
them freedom to pursue their intellectual interests (although he never dictates<br/>
that they do so)&#39;.  this sound very close to goddards approach.  so if someone<br/>
is looking to go to college this sounds like it wouldn&#39;t be a huge culture<br/>
shock.<br/>

&gt; Maybe this is heretical, but in my opinion, the perfect unschooler&#39;s college<br/>
&gt; is life.<br/>

&gt; &gt;    Has anyone heard of Goddard College in Vermont?  I was going through a<br/>
&gt; &gt; book I got at the library which lists accredited colleges in the U.S. and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Canada that have off-campus/long distance learning with degrees available.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Goddard was one of them so I did a search on the Internet and was really<br/>
&gt; &gt; surprised to read about them.  They sound like a perfect unschooler&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; college.  The learning is very self-directed and the on-campus classes are<br/>
&gt; &gt; small discussion groups with teachers acting instead as &quot;facilitators.&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; am<br/>
&gt; &gt; really excited about this school.<br/>
