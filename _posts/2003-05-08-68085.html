<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So...what would someone who goes to the church of Scotland believe<br/>
&gt; differently than, say, a Baptist?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow.  Now there&#39;s a question.  Well, Anglicans come in several &quot;brands&quot;, for<br/>
lack of a better word, just like the Baptists do.  So I&#39;ll tell you what my<br/>
church believes, and other Anglicans are likely is pretty much in agreement<br/>
with, too.  (Correction: my husband tells me that Church of Scotland is<br/>
Presbyterian.  A different brand of mainline Christianity.)  But don&#39;t sue<br/>
me because you can name three Anglicans who don&#39;t believe this, because<br/>
that&#39;s the nature of religious faith, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Episcopalians (the American version of Anglicans) believe that the Bible is<br/>
the history of the people of God.  It was written by people who were<br/>
inspired by God, but we do not take the Bible literally.  That makes a huge<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
I think that when I first became Episcopalian, the other thing that struck<br/>
me as very different than other Protestants is that scripture (the Bible) is<br/>
seen as an equal partner with tradition and reason.  The image used is a<br/>
three-legged stool; scripture is one leg of it only.  It is not the sole<br/>
device by which the church considers issues, problems, etc.; traditions of<br/>
the church and our God-given ability to reason out a situation are also<br/>
given an equal place.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously there are worship difference, and such, too, but they&#39;re not<br/>
necessarily what you&#39;re asking about here.  But I have been told before, and<br/>
it&#39;s often implied, that I&#39;m not a &quot;true Christian&quot; because of those types<br/>
of beliefs.  Hence my sarcastic comment before.  I am truly sorry if what I<br/>
said offended you, it wasn&#39;t my intent.<br/>
