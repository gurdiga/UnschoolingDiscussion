&lt;&lt; &gt; Newbie here! Don&#39;t need special wording to understand that I was not <br/>
being <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; insulted for being Christian.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t feel insulted.  If was very apparent that it was <br/>
classifying an entire group of people &quot;Christians&quot; as exhibiting behaviours <br/>
that I would certainly not want associated with me at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that on this list you need to be especially clear what you are <br/>
talking about or who you are referring to in order to make your point clear <br/>
and get the answers you are looking for.  It does make a difference in how <br/>
others respond to you.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I&#39;m VERY glad that others have decided to not lump me in with <br/>
that group of radical &quot;christian homeschoolers&quot; that I suspect would probably <br/>
STILL raise their children the very same way they do without a church or <br/>
&quot;religion&quot; but find the church a comfortable excuse or the acceptance of <br/>
their behaviours somehow reassuring.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that Sandra would not be offended if I were to tell you all about <br/>
the two unschooling families that I am familiar with who now have children <br/>
who are 19 and 20 (and a handful of younger ones too) that can&#39;t read, can&#39;t <br/>
write, can barely be verbal in any social situation.  They know nothing about <br/>
getting along in the world.  It&#39;s very sad really.  There are lots of things <br/>
I could tell you about them, but there is no need because it wouldn&#39;t change <br/>
their circumstances for them.<br/>
<br/>
BUT if I were to say things about these unschoolers as fact, I&#39;m sure that <br/>
Sandra would feel the need to point out that they are NOT unschoolers in her <br/>
sense of the word.  You don&#39;t want others to misunderstand or think you <br/>
approve or accept things like rods with names, whipping babies to change them <br/>
and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I&#39;m gonna try to explain why it is offensive to be grouped in with <br/>
these radicals.  If it didn&#39;t offend you, I&#39;m glad, it does bother me enough <br/>
to make sure no one thinks I am a part of that.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First Glena, you don&#39;t need to explain anything to me! Second, If you looked <br/>
into this group and read and did your research you would KNOW without having <br/>
to jump, that this group is NOT associated with these radicals. Why would <br/>
someone or anyone here that does not associate with these radicals try to <br/>
group one of us unschoolers in with them? Just don&#39;t get your point and I <br/>
really don&#39;t care to. I find in this group that you have to listen to what is <br/>
being said and not to be so defensive. Newbies are supposed to sit back and <br/>
listen, read, research and the such. Did you do this before joining this <br/>
group? Did you go and read all the archives? Did you visit Sandra&#39;s site? Do <br/>
you use google? Sure we may come here thinking we know it all and may be a <br/>
bit defensive but the way you have handled all of this gives me a headache. <br/>
For someone that has claimed to have gone through so much, why can&#39;t you just <br/>
ask questions?  I was not offended because I know what I am and where I am. <br/>
Do you? I didn&#39;t need this issue to be beaten to death to see that I was not <br/>
being grouped. You don&#39;t have to keep on explaining why you became defensive <br/>
but I sure hope you learn from it and just ask, research and listen and stop <br/>
being so defensive. Thanks but no thanks I don&#39;t need to hear about the 2 <br/>
unschooling families you are familiar with, I&#39;m busy with more important <br/>
things like learning from this group and getting all I can from them so that <br/>
I can be a better parent. You see I have a teenage boy who was in the public <br/>
school and because of them and because of us NOT LISTENING he was hurt. I now <br/>
have to live with his slight brain damage, hearing loss, vision loss and <br/>
extreme anger towards children and adults not to mention all the guilt. My <br/>
husband and I have made great progress with him and I owe it all to this <br/>
list. If I thought they were anything than what they say they are, I sure <br/>
would not be here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, yes, and yes. I came here knowing I knew next to nothing about <br/>
unschooling in the context most of the ladies do and I&#39;ve repeatedly said so, <br/>
and said I&#39;m grateful for their experience, their thoughts and willingness to <br/>
share.  I do ask questions LOTS of questions.<br/>
<br/>
And like it has been said before I&#39;m glad YOU got it, no explanation needed, <br/>
but there are over a thousand people here.  It&#39;s not wrong to say you don&#39;t <br/>
believe in whipping babies or buying a rod to beat your child and that you <br/>
don&#39;t want associated with them.  It&#39;s just NOT.<br/>
