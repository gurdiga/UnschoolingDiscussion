Homeschoolers International list<br><br>Howdy,<br><br>Okay, I&#39;ve started the 
list.&nbsp; So far there are three homeschooling families from England&nbsp; 
who&#39;ve signed up (if I&#39;m guessing correctly by their email addresses).&nbsp; 
I&#39;ve invited people from nearly a dozen countries to join.&nbsp; As the number 
of members increases, hopefully we&#39;ll see the list evolve into a truly 
international homeschoolers forum.<br><br>If you decide to join, please grant me 
two favours:<br><br>1. Post an introductory message right away.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t 
need to be long or involved.&nbsp; Just say who you are, where you&#39;re from, 
etc.&nbsp; This is very important in order to break the ice.<br>.<br>2. Make an 
effort at least for a few days to participate to get this group off the 
ground.<br><br>I believe this list has a lot of potential.&nbsp; We just need to 
attract good people from around the world.&nbsp; I know they&#39;re out there, it&#39;s 
only a matter of finding them.<br><br>You can join by visiting the group 
homepage at:<br><a rel="nofollow"
