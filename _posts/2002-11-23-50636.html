<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876775280">I have a few recipes for dough creations. The first one is traditional<br/>
dough recipe:<br/>
        Stir 4 C flour and 1 C salt in large bowl till well mixed. Stir<br/>
in 1.5 C warm water. Add paste food color or tempera powder if desired.<br/>
Put dough on lightly floured surface, and shape into a ball, using<br/>
floured hands. Knead dough 5 to 10 minutes or until dough is smooth and<br/>
elastic. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap, and take out only as much as<br/>
you need at a time. (It dries out quickly) Make your shapes and put them<br/>
on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake about 1 hour or until dough is dry and<br/>
just begins to brown. Take shapes off cookie sheet and cool completely.<br/>
Paint shapes with tempera paint or watercolors, if you like. If you spray<br/>
them with clear sealing spray they will last longer. Store unbaked dough<br/>
in fridge for up to 30 days.<br/>
My children made ornaments with this recipe and their aunts and grandmas<br/>
really liked them:<br/>
Mix equal parts applesauce,  cinnamon, and white glue. You can add a<br/>
little red food coloring to make them a deeper red. Roll out to about 1/4<br/>
inch thick and use cookie cutters to cut out shapes. Use toothpick or<br/>
straw to make hole at top. You can either let them air dry, or to hasten<br/>
the process,  put them in a food dehydrator.    They smell great, and<br/>
also make cute gifts if you mix them with some potpourri and put them<br/>
around a candle.<br/>
There is also a great book called Creating Art with Bread Dough by Dona<br/>
Meilach that has a ton of pictures and ideas for the skilled and<br/>
not-so-skilled artists. Hope this helps.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a wonderful book from Kids Can Press called Bake It and Build It by<br/>
Elizabeth MacLeod.  It&#39;s only $6, and well worth it.  There are some cool<br/>
ideas in it, and most of them are edible.<br/>
<br/>
This is the recipe from it for cinnamon applesauce dough which can&#39;t be<br/>
eaten but makes wonderful smelling ornaments.<br/>
<br/>
1 c. smooth applesauce (she says storebought works best)<br/>
1/2 c. cinnamon<br/>
1/2 c. flour<br/>
1/2 t. salt.  <br/>
<br/>
Mix all.  Roll out on waxed paper WITHOUT flour (it won&#39;t mix in and will<br/>
show).  She suggests patting dough to about 1/2 inch thick with hands, then<br/>
rolling to 1/4 inch thick with clean rolling pin.  Use cookie cutters to cut<br/>
shapes from the dough and place on pans lined with aluminum foil.  Make a<br/>
hole in the top with a drinking straw before baking.<br/>
<br/>
Bake for 2 hours at 225 degrees.  Remove from oven and let cool on the sheet<br/>
for 2 minutes, then use spatula to move to a cooling rack to cool entirely.<br/>
<br/>
But buy the book!  It&#39;s so worth it!<br/>
<br/>
About the paint:  &quot;Feed Me! I&#39;m Yours&quot; says that you can dye salt dough with<br/>
food coloring, or paint it with plastic or acrylic based paints or markers.<br/>
If you use any other paint, spray with shellac type stuff or paint with<br/>
clear nailpolish to preserve colors.  This book is by Vicki Lansky and might<br/>
be out of print (mine is ancient, from a thrift store), but it has about 10<br/>
recipes for playdough, clay, and dough ornaments that can be baked, dried,<br/>
etc.  Maybe your library has it.<br/>
