<div id="ygrps-yiv-285138138">&lt;&lt;Her demand for swim trunks on my babies gave me the urge to march over there and ask her to please<br/>
refrain from screaming obscenities and abusing her children where mine could hear and see it.  Of<br/>
course I didn&#39;t, as that would be petty and childish. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Petty and childish, MY FOOT!  Why have you been putting up with this?  Since when is it petty and childish to protect your children?  (protect them from someone who is a criminal, no less, [we have laws against child abuse]).</div>
