&lt;&lt; Could you actually skip 3 grades and not have anyone from the state <br/>
knocking on your door asking why you have never tested your child??   I am <br/>
not very good at intentionally &#39;breaking the rules&#39; so I guess this is why I <br/>
would be hesitant to do it.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The test scores were treated as a batch in New Mexico and not associated or <br/>
listed as/with individual files or individual kids or families.  It was for <br/>
state statistical purposes only.  <br/>
