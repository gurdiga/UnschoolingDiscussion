with even more bad science. It&#39;s not just that they&#39;ve decided to <br/>
program children, it&#39;s that they don&#39;t then even do that in what <br/>
would be the most productive way! Dumb and dumber...&gt;&gt;<br/>

ARGH!!!!  * I must breathe*  I am cursing *years* spent failing algebra until <br/>
senior year where all was understood....in Physics class.  Thank god the <br/>

wonderful class that I  loved!!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where are you thinking he&#39;ll get a diploma from? Surely they must require<br/>
more than just algebra. If he just needed a course in algebra there are<br/>
community colleges, lots of good books like Painless Algebra and the Keys To<br/>
workbooks, getting a tutor ...<br/>
<br/>
You can print up a diploma on your printer. A diploma just says that a<br/>
student has performed to the standard a particular school considers<br/>
graduation material.<br/>
<br/>
But, really, none of that shouldn&#39;t be necessary. Most colleges have<br/>
accomodations for homeschoolers so you should check into that. Some colleges<br/>
may not have had to deal with homeschooled applicants so may not know what<br/>
to do but they&#39;re going to recognize that it&#39;s something they need to have a<br/>
policy for since homeschooling is growing.<br/>

admit a kid who hasn&#39;t got a diploma?  Did you ask them to try?  (Calmly and<br/>
patiently but forcefully!)  They&#39;ve never ever had a talented kid with a GED<br/>
admitted?  They&#39;ve never in their lives dealt with a homescholer before?<br/>
(And even if they haven&#39;t, they can surely start now...he won&#39;t be the<br/>
last!)<br/>
<br/>
Give us all the facts, surely one of the 1000+ people on this list can help<br/>
you figure out a way around it!  Algebra is a stupid thing to stand between<br/>
your son and what he wants to do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t even have to have a diploma to get into college. But - there <br/>
are costs to not doing things the &quot;usual&quot; way, of course. There are <br/>
colleges that look at the individual as a whole when making admissions <br/>
decisions - New College of New York might be one of those, I&#39;d guess - <br/>
they have no specific list of requirements for admissions.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter applied to a University of California campus - the <br/>
requirements are normally very clearly laid out - you must have x, y, <br/>
and z, in order to be considered for admission. But - she has a lot of <br/>
community college coursework completed with very high grades, and they <br/>
accepted her to this UC, on the spot, with the understanding that she&#39;d <br/>
take a science class and a couple of math classes at the UC, to make up <br/>
for &quot;deficiencies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But - if a kid wants something and knows the requirements, then the <br/>
easiest way to handle that is for him to find a way to fulfill the <br/>
requirement, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

a good grasp of algebra to delve very far into almost any scientific <br/>
field, these days -- just to be able to read the professional <br/>
literature of most fields.<br/>

Thanks for your post, the sites that I was able to access are really good.  <br/>
The school he wants does accept a GED, so I guess I will look into that, and <br/>
I am going to talk to the college again.  <br/>
I know that many colleges do have special admission procedures for <br/>
homeschoolers, but, at least so far, I have been told that This college does not.  But, <br/>
I will look into it further, <br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

thanks for your interest.  The school is Berklee College of music in Boston.  <br/>
I am going to call and talk with some other people there and find out what I <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284748463">See if you can find a copy of Realm of Algebra by Isaac Asimov.  It&#39;s <br/>
perfect for an 8 yo who&#39;s interested.  It&#39;s out of print but can <br/>
usually be found in college libraries.  It&#39;s book that is to be read <br/>
not worked through written by a man who loves and is enthusiastic <br/>
about the subject.  It&#39;s like sitting down with Asimov and have a <br/>
conversation with him- very gentle.<br/>

I wondered if that was the school.  Berklee is one of the most radical (in a<br/>
good way!) music schools out there.  They have to be able to figure out how<br/>
to admit your son without algebra.  Call and ask lots of questions, and let<br/>
us know what you learn.   If you hit a brick wall, write me off-list.  I&#39;ve<br/>
met a couple folks from there, maybe they can send you the right direction.<br/>
