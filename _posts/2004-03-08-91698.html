<br/>
I had that situation twice, with a baby and another child 2.5-3 years older.  <br/>
I carried the littler one a lot in a backpack, and I used to RUSH to do <br/>
something with the toddler when the baby fell asleep.   I would also ask my husband <br/>
to take a kid for a drive/walk/play/trip to the store when he got home, if <br/>
one kid was feeling left out or needy for more time.<br/>
<br/>
We also did things that seemed like one on one but weren&#39;t.  Going to a <br/>
playground.  Several combos of two and three.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I borrowed other kids a lot. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Adding one other child to the Kirby/Marty combo gave them a whole new angle <br/>
on the same old activities, and then I could spend time with the youngest.  <br/>
(That still works.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737751280">It also helps to remember that, although the older sibling tends to get  <br/>
more one-on-one time with the parents, the younger sibling gets the  <br/>
addition of interaction with an older sibling. That&#39;s a plus for them  <br/>
that balances out some of the minus of less parent-time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459273519">I have a 9yo ds & dd triplets (6) - and in terms of 1:1 it is challenging when they are young.  When they were little & dh was home, or help was available - I made a point of taking one of the 4 with me on errands, shopping, etc.   They all understood the game plan - (though they didn&#39;t always like it) and just being alone with mom - even if it was just to run errands was a chance for us to talk, play & enjoy.  At home my son cld easily be absorbed in an activity, and 2 of the girls (at 2 yo) cld be drawn into their own activities in the same room  (play doh & gadgets to press into it work great!) - Thus allowing me to spend time with 1 of them reading, playing - cooking in the kitchen, etc.  My ds got 1:1 time when the girls napped, or in the evening when the girls were already asleep.  There were other opportunities when I cld take ds to an event & have a friend watch the girls.  One of my favorite times for 1:1 was bed time - 3 wld play downstairs with dad while I rocked, read & chatted w/ 1 - then I wld take that 1 and tuck them in; repeating the process through the  girls (they shared a room - so the rocker was in the den).  Ds ended up w/ 1:1 w/ dad and me!  He knew once the girls  were in bed - I was his, we&#39;d snuggle in bed, read stories, talk, play a quiet game, whatever until he was ready to sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
Now - 3 will be on computers while I have 1:1 time with the 4th, and we rotate through - not necessarily all in one day but I still manage to get in the 1:1 fairly regular.  Cub Scouts is a 1:1 time w/ ds too.   If it&#39;s any help, it does get easier as they get older.  I try very hard to make the 1:1 time happen - but allot of the time I find that can happen when we&#39;re all out somewhere and 1 will walk w/ me, sit next to me, etc. and naturally get some focused attention.  We&#39;re a large family (8 in all- 6 at home) and we enjoy being together - reading, playing, watching a show/cartoon, cooking, brushing the dogs, cleaning the little critter cages, and lately even housework!  1:1 comes in snippets of time and blocks of time.  Sometimes it&#39;s just taking a moment to really listen to or look at what 1 child is bringing to you.  <br/>
