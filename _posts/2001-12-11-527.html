<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030696574">I&#39;ve been lurking in the shadows, enjoying all of your posts, but just had to <br/>
respond to the &quot;special day&quot; topic.<br/>
My dh was adopted and his parents did a &quot;chosen day&quot; for him (the day he was <br/>
adopted). As our oldest became more aware, he realized that Daddy had a <br/>
Birthday plus another special day and that didn&#39;t sit well with him. So we <br/>
celebrate their half Birthday now.<br/>
Our day is fairly simple, the child picks out the entire days menu....usually <br/>
pizza and rootbeer floats all day! And we do the activities that they want <br/>
all day too. This may sound like a normal unschooling day, but in a household <br/>
with six people, one person rarely ever dictates the entire day so they love <br/>
it.<br/>
I can&#39;t run errands or pick the stores we go to at all....that person is in <br/>
charge the entire day.  It&#39;s been a hit around here.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m really glad to be here....I love reading all the posts. I see a <br/>
lot of unschooling.com people!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363745492">Hey Ren!<br/>
Nice to see you here.<br/>
<br/>
Since I started thinking about this, a half-birthday would be perfect. My kids always make a special note of remembering when they are 1/2 way into their year, like 8 1/2, 10 1/2, etc. It would be the perfect time to have their other special day.<br/>
Now why couldn&#39;t I think of this idea on my own?<br/>
You guys are giving me great ideas. My kids and I thank you!<br/>
<br/>
