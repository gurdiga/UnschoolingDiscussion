<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023931007">Two BIG indicators that Jesus is no peacnik.<br/>
<br/>
AND that he would&#39;ve made a really bad military strategist.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a clue that maybe priests and nuns are the only ones going to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Mat 10:34   Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not <br/>
to send peace, but a sword. <br/>
  <br/>
    Mat 10:35   For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, <br/>
and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her <br/>
mother in law. <br/>
  <br/>
    Mat 10:36   And a man&#39;s foes [shall be] they of his own household. <br/>
  <br/>
    Mat 10:37   He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of <br/>
me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. <br/>
  <br/>
    Mat 10:38   And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is <br/>
not worthy of me. <br/>
  <br/>
    Mat 10:39   He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth <br/>
his life for my sake shall find it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Mat 19:29   And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, <br/>
or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name&#39;s sake, <br/>
shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. <br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
Mar 10:29   And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no <br/>
man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or <br/>
wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel&#39;s, <br/>
  <br/>
    Mar 10:30   But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, <br/>
and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with <br/>
persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. <br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:3     And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon&#39;s, and <br/>
prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, <br/>
and taught the people out of the ship. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:4     Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out <br/>
into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:5     And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all <br/>
the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down <br/>
the net. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:6     And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude <br/>
of fishes: and their net brake. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:7     And they beckoned unto [their] partners, which were in the <br/>
other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled <br/>
both the ships, so that they began to sink. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:8     When Simon Peter saw [it], he fell down at Jesus&#39; knees, <br/>
saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:9     For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the <br/>
draught of the fishes which they had taken: <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:10    And so [was] also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which <br/>
were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from <br/>
henceforth thou shalt catch men. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 5:11    And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook <br/>
all, and followed him. <br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Luk 14:26    If any [man] come to me, and hate not his father, and <br/>
mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own <br/>
life also, he cannot be my disciple. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:27   And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, <br/>
cannot be my disciple. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:28   For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not <br/>
down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have [sufficient] to finish <br/>
[it]? <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:29   Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not <br/>
able to finish [it], all that behold [it] begin to mock him, <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:30   Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:31   Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth <br/>
not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet <br/>
him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:32   Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth <br/>
an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. <br/>
  <br/>
    Luk 14:33   So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all <br/>
that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Luk 20:35   But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, <br/>
and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What He&#39;s saying there is that some people are going to turn against <br/>
you if you follow Christ.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, I have a friend who became a born again Christian after <br/>
she got married.  Her husband got very upset.  They ended up being <br/>
seperated and him telling her that they would never get back together <br/>
unless she stop being a Christian.  Therefore, she had to choose <br/>
between Christ and her husband.  She chose Christ, but her husband <br/>
knows that if he ever wants to take her back, she&#39;s there.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Luk 20:35   But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>world, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>marriage:<br/>
<br/>
If you read that in context with the verses around it, it&#39;s saying <br/>
that we won&#39;t get married in heaven.  It&#39;s not saying that only <br/>
unmarried people can get into heaven. <br/>
<br/>
Luke 20:33-36<br/>
(Saducees questioning Jesus)&quot;Now then, at the resurrection whose wife <br/>
will she be, since the sever were married to her?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Jesus replied, &#39;The people of this age marry and are given in <br/>
marriage.  But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that <br/>
age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be <br/>
given in marriage, and they can no longer die; for they are like the <br/>
angels.  They are God&#39;s children, since they are children of the <br/>
resurrection.&quot;  <br/>

Please don&#39;t tell us what he&#39;s saying.  I know whether you know or  not that <br/>
there&#39;s not a verse in there that hasn&#39;t been interpretted three or four <br/>
different ways by different people for different purposes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66020534">-=- For a time, he traveled to England, where a disciple of his, Douglas <br/>
Dewar, enthusiastically echoed his mentor, saying bluntly, &quot;The Bible cannot <br/>
contain false statements, and so if its statements undoubtedly conflict with <br/>
the views of geologists, these latter are wrong.&quot; (cited in Numbers, 1992, p. <br/>
146) Much of Price&#39;s &quot;flood geology&quot; can be found, nearly intact, in the <br/>
writings of modern creationists. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is from an article on creation &quot;science&quot; at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/whoare.htm">http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/2437/whoare.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really interesting all in and of itself, but it caused me a couple of <br/>
thoughts.  One was an article in Home Schooling Digest which claimed that any <br/>
math that&#39;s in the Bible must be correct, and so anyone who tries to prove <br/>
otherwise is anti-Christian.  (Party about pi, but other things... I wish <br/>
that article were on line.  I should look again.)   <br/>
<br/>
This came up because a childless friend of mine in Arkansas came up with a <br/>
little tirade on homeschooling, and in defending myself, I described the kind <br/>
of homeschoolers I&#39;m guessing he might have come across there.  <br/>
<br/>
And then I wondered whether maybe it&#39;s easier to be a really good <br/>
fundamentalist when surrounded by people who are that way.  Most people are <br/>
sheep, not leaders.  And so if the sheep can&#39;t shake a crook without hitting <br/>
another fundamentalist &quot;shepherd,&quot; that&#39;s a pretty tight pen.  <br/>
<br/>
And I wondered whether the Bible Beittle hills covered over with green.  I <br/>
wonder whether it&#39;s harder to be a young earth proponent in a place like Utah <br/>
or Colorado, with BIG mountains.  Or in Europe, where even the local history <br/>
is as nearly as old as claims of young-earth creationists.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I&#39;ve had to explain that I&#39;m not like THOSE homeschoolers.<br/>
