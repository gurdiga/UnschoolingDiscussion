<div id="ygrps-yiv-197897827">I have tried the Seventh Generation dishwasher gel and a few others but <br/>
found they left a film on the dishes. Perhaps it is our hard water or that <br/>
I should try the powder instead of the gel. I wonder if there is something <br/>
(like vinegar or baking soda) that would boost the cleaning power of their <br/>
soap for hard water? I read that a company called Bio-Kleen has a good <br/>
dishwasher soap. Otherwise we do use the Seventh Generation toilet paper <br/>
and unbleached paper towels. When we recently switched to the brown paper <br/>
towels, my son said that his grandmother (my mom) would think the paper <br/>
towels were dirty! LOL  My mother is a white paper, Lysol and bleach <br/>
fanatic. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s going to change after 65 years. BTW, She <br/>
hasn&#39;t seen the brown paper towels yet!    :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545530636">Melaleuca has a bunch of great cleaning products that I&#39;ve used and been<br/>
happy with. I think their website is www.melaleuca.com, but I can&#39;t find my<br/>
catalog at the moment to know for sure :).<br/>
