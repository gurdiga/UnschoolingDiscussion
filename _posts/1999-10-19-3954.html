<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723962972">For those of you interested in the senate&#39;s compilation of reports of <br/>
their Y2K discoveries, go to <br/>
www.senate.gov/~y2k/documents/report/index.htm<br/>
    Do note: The Senate has written that y2k is indeed a problem. For those <br/>
thinking that (after reading) the biggest problem is overseas and that we <br/>
(Americans) do not need to worry, are WRONG. Most of our businesses contract <br/>
out of our country. We will find a large blank in the supply/demand sector. <br/>
If we think that it is not our concern, think of where over 80% of our oil <br/>
products come from (including gasoline). What kind of crisises are going to <br/>
spill onto our hands? <br/>
    As for others, preparation is indeed necessary. Even if it is a week of <br/>
living without one utility or another, we need to prepare. I am preparing for <br/>
the &quot;Mays&quot; in life, and for the &quot;chances&quot; that are out there. You know, the <br/>
&quot;May&quot; y2k cause a big overall problem, and the &quot;chance&quot; that I need to alter <br/>
my family&#39;s life in some way to live thru it. <br/>
    My mother (who knows all, lol) is prepared. She lives in Florida, and <br/>
says that she is prepped for the family to live there for a time. She has <br/>
always been prepared, because as many Floridians know, one hurricane can make <br/>
you live pre twentieth century for up to and possibly over two weeks. <br/>
    I am preparing. I am not where I want to be, yet. I have canned goods, <br/>
and boxed foods. I am starting on the water. I do not want to suffer. We plan <br/>
on having garbage pails filled with water for cleaning and cooking. I will <br/>
have food and water for my pets. Lots of it. I will have all the vehicles <br/>
filled with gasoline before the 24th of December. I am not leaving the area <br/>
of over a month after the 1st of January. Our plans are like every other <br/>
year, and we are hoping to be thoughtful and smart in our planning. <br/>
    This month I am drying meats and vegetables. I will do this for many <br/>
reasons, but y2k is a good enough reason for me. My hope is that either way, <br/>
I will have no need to go to the market until March. Either way, normal <br/>
beginning of year, or for survival purposes.    <br/>
Sorry if you feel that I went overboard, but I do not see y2k as a little <br/>
problem. DH does, he does not say that it will not cause some problems, or <br/>
not to prepare for it; he feels that it is not going to be as big as some of <br/>
us think. I see it as something that I intend to be prepared for. Something <br/>
that if all is ok, then I am prepared for life, if y2k comes (with its <br/>
predicted problems) I want to have my family pull thru it, all present and <br/>
accounted for. <br/>

I know what you mean! I did notice a site that is real good for all that.<br/>
www.y2kkitchen.com<br/>
I do hope that it does not go that far, but I am not going to go insane like <br/>
the ostrich when the calendar turns! <br/>
