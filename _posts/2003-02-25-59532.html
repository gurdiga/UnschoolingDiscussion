<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809933770">Ummmm because it gets dark???  Really he&#39;s asking about<br/>
capacitors I think - something that holds the charge while the<br/>
sun isn&#39;t shining.<br/>
<br/>
Having raised a kid who still at 24 is convinced he WILL invent<br/>
perpetual motion (other than his own) and anti gravity and<br/>
invisibility... I commend a trip to Goodwill for a number of<br/>
things that operate on a simple electric motor (round and round),<br/>
along with a subscription to a few mags you find in the shade<br/>
tree mechanic&#39;s bathroom - Popular Mechanics etc.  Mother Earth<br/>
News is great, but you want &quot;down and dirty&quot; &quot;what works how&quot; to<br/>
capture that budding engineer - as well as to let him teach<br/>
himself. If it scares you to think about physics, you&#39;ll scare<br/>
him trying to do much to help him learn.<br/>
<br/>
Oh also, at a yardsale get one of those &quot;75 electrical<br/>
experiments&quot; box kits.  I never got a nibble on a new, pristine<br/>
ones - but the ones with a few missing wires and unidentifiable<br/>
stain on the back were hours of fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-690760605">It may light up for a while, but will slowly get dimmer until it does not <br/>
light at all.  When energy is transferred, some of it is lost.  So the <br/>
energy required to power a light bulb is greater than the energy emitted as <br/>
light.  Some of this &quot;lost&quot; energy is expressed as heat.  Therefore, the <br/>
light cannot create enough energy to power itself continuously.  However, <br/>
even if the light energy was sufficient when it left the bulb, some of the <br/>
energy from the light is lost when it travels to the panel, some is lost <br/>
while being absorbed, some is lost traveling through the wires, and so on.  <br/>
So the energy would not be enough to light the bulb with the same brilliance <br/>
once it got back there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well it&#39;s confusing because he has some concept that batteries are supplying<br/>
something that solar cells aren&#39;t. Maybe if you ask him what he thinks is<br/>
happening with the light bulb and the battery then you can explain it<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
You could hook up a light bulb to solar panels and have it light. There<br/>
isn&#39;t a need for a battery to get it started. You just hook it up. (A rather<br/>
bizarre concept, though, converting light to electricity in order to convert<br/>
electricity to light ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The lightbulb doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s connected to. All it knows is that<br/>
there&#39;s something pushing enough electricity into it (and supplying an<br/>
outlet path for the electricity) to get the filament hot enough to emit<br/>
photons.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s seeing a difference between the electricity supplied by batteries<br/>
and that supplied by solar panels? But they&#39;re the same. They are both<br/>
objects that convert one form of energy into another form (electricity). A<br/>
battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Solar panels<br/>
convert solar energy into electrical energy. A generator converts mechanical<br/>
(wind, moving water, moving pistons) energy into electrical energy.<br/>
<br/>
One difference is a battery has a limited supply of chemical energy. Once<br/>
all the chemicals are changed, it can&#39;t supply any more electricity. Same<br/>
for generators that run off gasoline. Once the energy that&#39;s being converted<br/>
to electrical energy is gone, so&#39;s the electricity. But solar panels and<br/>
wind and water power generators *appear* to have an unlimited supply of<br/>
energy to convert to electricity. But of course that&#39;s not true. If the wind<br/>
dies or the sun goes down, the electricity stops just like a battery&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, what Tupelo said. That&#39;s the same with any perpetual motion machine.<br/>
Energy doesn&#39;t get converted perfectly from one form to another. There&#39;s<br/>
always some energy that gets converted to something you don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the energy going into the light bulb is converted to heat to get the<br/>
molecules banging around against each other in the filiment to emit photons.<br/>
That energy can&#39;t be recaptured by a solar panel. Even florescents which can<br/>
convert more of the energy into light than incandescents get really hot even<br/>
though it doesn&#39;t seem like it because the gas is spread out. The molecules<br/>
inside are moving very fast.<br/>
<br/>
And that heat loss happens all along the process. Not all of the solar<br/>
energy gets converted to electricity because of heat loss. Not all of the<br/>
electricity gets to the light bulb because of heat loss. Molecules<br/>
vibrating, atoms, electrons banging around.<br/>
