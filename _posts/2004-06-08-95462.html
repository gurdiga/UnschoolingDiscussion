I&#39;m sure  parenting has something to do with encouraging or <br/>
discouraging natural  fearlessness, but I also think that a whole lot <br/>
of it is just inherent  personality. My two kids are like night and <br/>
day in this regard. One total  risk-taker, one very cautious kid. Both <br/>
have had respectful parenting and  unschooling from the start.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Yeah, the old nature/nurture thang. And I should have prefaced it with  that!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
I think I&#39;m naturally a risk-taker, but had it ingrained in me that I  <br/>
*could* do and be...whatever. So it was easy and comfortable to try new  things.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Ben&#39;s probably not a natural risk-taker, and his family (all  <br/>
better-safe-than-sorries) did not help him venture out very far. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Both nature AND nurture hard at work for both of us!  I might have  been less <br/>
of a risk-taker if I&#39;d been in Ben&#39;s family, and Ben might have been  more of <br/>
one!<br/>
