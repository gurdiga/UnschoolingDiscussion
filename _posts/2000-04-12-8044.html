    I will answer your question the best I can.  There are still some<br/>
states (Alaska for one) that still has a homesteading law that enables<br/>
you to stake a claim on remote pieces of land.  If you build a cabin or<br/>
house stay there a certain amount of time and meet all the requirements<br/>
the land is yours.  <br/>
    What I mean by homesteading is a little different.  My definition is<br/>
to move to a piece of land that  is remote or not, but very unimproved,<br/>
and start from scratch.  Live there as you are making the improvements<br/>
and building the house.  Living off the land as much as possible.<br/>
