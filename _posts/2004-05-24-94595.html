<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877210947">I told DD&#39;s story here last week, about how she thought a group of <br/>
girls sounded mean when they defended spanking as the way to bring up a good <br/>
child. And we  talked before here about the movie Mean Girls, which DD really <br/>
loved both as comedy and social Power of Story. <br/>
<br/>
       Then she read a newspaper column about movies like Mean Girls being <br/>
the cause of bad girl behavior, by glorifying it. So now she&#39;s developed her own <br/>
theory about Mean Girls and spanking. It moved her to fire off a letter to <br/>
the editor. <br/>
<br/>
       This was totally her own motivation, ideas, and words, even her own <br/>
transmission to the paper by email. I never saw it, although as she worked on it <br/>
she read bits of it out loud while I was playing Scrabble with DS.  Anyway, <br/>
it appears in today&#39;s newspaper, as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t Blame Movies for Girls&#39; Cruelty<br/>
<br/>
Re: &quot;Girl-on-girl cruelty isn&#39;t entertaining&quot; column, May 8.<br/>
<br/>
       The truth is, girls talk about other girls behind their backs and they <br/>
say mean things. Isn&#39;t it just as likely that these girls are the way they <br/>
are because their parents spank or hit them, not because what they see in a <br/>
movie looks cool?<br/>
<br/>
       When a movie like &quot;Mean Girls&quot; comes along, girls don&#39;t like it <br/>
because they want to emulate it or because it is cool, but because it is an exaggerat<br/>
ed version of what happens to them every day.<br/>
<br/>
       Outreach programs such as the ones the author mentioned are an <br/>
excellent idea, as is parent involvement, But to understand and curb this behavior, <br/>
it is necessary to step back and consider that perhaps life is not imitating <br/>
art (tv and movies) but art is imitating life.<br/>
<br/>
       And perhaps we should do something about THAT.<br/>

Note: the newspaper&#39;s website isn&#39;t loading at the moment so I typed this in <br/>
from the morning paper, but the uploaded version should be linked at <br/>
www.tallahassee.com in the Letters/editorial section if anyone wants to see it.  We&#39;ve  <br/>
had a couple of chuckling phone calls this morning from family friends, but <br/>
DD herself is still asleep - these unschooled teens! &lt;grin&gt;   JJ<br/>
