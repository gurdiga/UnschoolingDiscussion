<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661335925">Thank you to everyone who gave suggestions and thoughts in response <br/>
to my question about helping my son learn to read.  They were all <br/>
very much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking all day on my husband&#39;s job situation (feeling <br/>
frustrated about it as usual) and wondered if any of you, being <br/>
outside-the-box thinkers, might be able to offer any ideas.  I feel <br/>
so helpless about the whole thing.  Dh was laid off in August of &#39;01 <br/>
and finally hired again in June of this year.  Those almost-two-years <br/>
of unemployment brought major stress (compounded by the birth of my <br/>
second son)into our home, as well as putting us FAR into debt.  We&#39;ve <br/>
barely begun digging ourselves out of that hole and have found out <br/>
now this job is in danger of being lost.  If he loses this one I <br/>
don&#39;t know where we&#39;ll turn.<br/>
<br/>
One of my frustrations is I feel dh is not working from his <br/>
strengths; that his talents are in other areas.  He tries to fit into <br/>
the corporate world (he&#39;s an IT architect) but it&#39;s like bashing a <br/>
square peg into a round hole.  Something just doesn&#39;t fit.  And his <br/>
bosses see it.  He works hard, but just can&#39;t reach the bar.  The <br/>
thing is, at 38 years old, how do you switch into another career path <br/>
without starting at square one?  When he was out of work we kept <br/>
hearing, &quot;Well, why doesn&#39;t he get out of IT [the bottom fell out of <br/>
IT especially]&quot; like it should be the easiest thing in the world, yet <br/>
we found, as well as did others we knew out of work, that unless you <br/>
had concrete experience in your field, you were out of contention.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t matter if you had the education or the ability; without <br/>
experience to back it up, no one would take a chance on you.  Dh <br/>
would be excellent in some sort of graphics work, even one of the <br/>
computer-generated special effects shops (that would be like going to <br/>
play every day instead of work), but, how do we get there?  I found <br/>
one book that profiled people who had made about-face career changes <br/>
and by the end of the book had found out their secret in pulling it <br/>
off -- all of them had bank accounts large enough to support them <br/>
while they made the change.  We don&#39;t have that.<br/>
<br/>
So, with 20 years experience in the corporate world, how do you get <br/>
out of it into something else?  We are so sick of corporate America <br/>
we could scream, but we don&#39;t know how to escape, with no savings, no <br/>
real assets, major debt, and two children to support.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for reading this far if you have, and for putting up with a <br/>
non-unschooling question, and a rambling one at that -- I&#39;m just <br/>
stumped and need some sort of workable ideas.</div>

~~So, with 20 years experience in the corporate world, how do you get <br/>

<br/>
Ok, since I don&#39;t know any specifics about your personal situation, this is just general &#39;get back on your feet&#39; ideas.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re way in debt, the first thing I would do is to downsize absolutely everything possible.  Less expensive housing, older cars, sell everything you don&#39;t absolutely need.  (This is all temporary, and can all be upgraded later.)  Talk to your debtors, in person if possible, and tell them what&#39;s going on.  A lot of the time they will cut, if not eliminate the interest owed, and may let you make tiny, &#39;good faith&#39; payments until things get better.  Some will even forgive large chunks of the debt.  Maybe talk to a credit counselor, they can sometimes help.  Bankruptcy (not a great option, but if there&#39;s no other way, there&#39;s no other way.  There IS life after bankruptcy, I am living proof.)  Is there anything you can do from home to help with the finances?  Crafts, sewing, computer work, selling on ebay, writing...anything you&#39;re skilled at is sellable.  <br/>
<br/>
~~The <br/>
thing is, at 38 years old, how do you switch into another career path <br/>
without starting at square one?~~<br/>
<br/>
Work for yourself.  Start a business.  Whatever he and you are good at, check into getting a grant for small businesses (which sometimes will cover living expenses while your business is getting off the ground), do some research in your area, demographics, and figure out what the area NEEDS, or even better than that, what your area people would WANT.  You&#39;d still be starting out at square one with your own business, but it would be YOUR square.<br/>
<br/>
~~Dh <br/>
would be excellent in some sort of graphics work, even one of the <br/>
computer-generated special effects shops (that would be like going to <br/>
play every day instead of work), but, how do we get there?~~<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know exactly, but I would start by talking to the people that are doing it now.  Go to the shops, get to know the people, use friends of friends to get your foot in the door.  Do some research to find out how to get there.  For something like graphics work, I&#39;ll bet that creativity and persistence speak louder than education and experience.  I&#39;m in the graphics business, and I know a few people that have years of experience, but very little talent.  They keep their jobs by being diligent and reliable, and someone else comes up with the creativity.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend that was stuck in a dead end job, hated it with a passion, and finally turned his back and walked away.  He was fairly good on a computer, fairly creative, and now has his own vinyl graphics shop.  He makes a ton of money creating vinyl decals you see on the sides of trucks and in store windows.  <br/>
<br/>
I have another friend that started a trophy business and is doing VERY well.  All he does is assemble the trophy parts, engraves the little tags, and collects the money.  He works out of his garage, so he has very little overhead.  His customers come to him, he doesn&#39;t even advertise except for word of mouth, business cards, and a little tag with his company name on the bottom of every trophy he makes.  <br/>
<br/>
Daycare can be a money maker, if you have the patience for it, lol.  I&#39;m not a big fan of daycare, but it&#39;s definitely something that is in need in most areas.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone will come up with something better.  There is always a way.  <br/>
<br/>

Sometimes a different corporation is the easiest change.  If he goes to <br/>
another place in town and tells them he feels stuck, and wants a different <br/>
environment, they might have just the thing for him.  Still computer stuff, but <br/>
different people, different projects.  And if that still doesn&#39;t do it, he&#39;ll know <br/>
he wants to do something REALLY different.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe?<br/>

could gradually build up a business, maybe with your help in some areas, <br/>
that would carry at least part of your financial load if he got laid off. <br/>
At that point he could put full time into it. He might be able to get it <br/>
going to the point of quitting before being laid off. Just a thought. I <br/>
don&#39;t know hard freelancing is in that area or how much time he has <br/>
available to put into it. Or the contacts he made while working on the <br/>
business might help him get into paid employment in that field.<br/>
