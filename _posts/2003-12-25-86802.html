and somehow feel cheated?<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest was little she used to give her stuff away all the time.<br/>
Drove me nuts....Then it finally dawned on me that I was working hard to<br/>
teach my child that stuff is more important than people.  Talk about<br/>
learning from your kids.  She is still very, very generous with herself,<br/>
time and possessions but she has some special things that she keeps for<br/>
herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181577100">Ok, at the risk of upsetting someone else, this sounds pretty disturbing <br/>
to me.  I also have questions about the brother&#39;s reactions.  Do they <br/>
care?  Do they feel as though they are being manipulative?  Does it <br/>
really matter if she&#39;s playing with them?  It&#39;s hard to be the youngest, <br/>
maybe she perceives they have all the good toys.  If the two boys are OK <br/>
with her coaxing the toys away, then it might be a game the kids play <br/>
together.  At any rate, I think that I might sit down with the three <br/>
kids together and have a conversation about how this concerns you.  If <br/>
the three kids are all OK with the situation, then you have expressed <br/>
your concerns and that should be the end of it.  If the boys don&#39;t like <br/>
it, then everyone needs to talk about how to deal with it differently.  <br/>
But I don&#39;t think making her pay you (they aren&#39;t YOUR toys) is anything <br/>
but coercive. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814916720">Hmmm.... First- yes, food for thought, I might have gone about it wrong- true. But, I don&#39;t think you understood-she&#39;s the OLDEST and she didn&#39;t pay ME, she paid her brothers. THe reason I choose the money route is because she cares about money. Her brothers DO give her their toys- but, thinking they will be returned within their lifetime.. When I give them their toys back, it&#39;s like Christmas to them! At any rate- yes, I will sit all three of them down, and if they say they do not mind- END IT- I will!! :) No hard feelings about what you said... THat&#39;s kinda why I wrote it- to get other&#39;s opinion if I was going at it right or what...  :)  Thanks, Pam    --- On Thu 12/25, joylyn &lt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:joylyn@...">joylyn@...</a> &gt; wrote:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012053011">&lt;&lt;So, I told her next time I find their toys in your room, you will pay them<br/>
25 cents for each toy and then return it. Well--- Found two blocks in their<br/>

<br/>
I guess my concern would be that she will find some other thing to do with<br/>
the toys that is a secret from you - like toss them in the garbage, bury<br/>
them in the garden or hide them behind the sofa. You have already said that<br/>
you are going to all get together for some conversation on this topic. One<br/>
of the earliest parenting advice articles I ever read said to beware of<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t let me CATCH you doing ...&quot; statements, since it was a mixed message<br/>
that could be taken as a challenge. I have to say I am a bit intrigued as to<br/>
why she does this. A second concern is that every once in a while the toys<br/>
might be borrowed for legitimate purposes of play, and just forgotten. The<br/>
&quot;pay a fine&quot; method might discourage that as an unintended consequence.<br/>
