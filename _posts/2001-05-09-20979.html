&gt;&gt; should be legislated that *adults* wear seatbelts. Â I<br/>
&gt;&gt; think that insurance companies could perhaps refuse to<br/>
&gt;&gt; pay for injuries caused by failing to wear<br/>
&gt;&gt; seatbelts... that would certainly provide incentive to<br/>
&gt;&gt; wear them, and would also address the major problem I<br/>
&gt;&gt; can see with people who don&#39;t wear them, which is that<br/>
&gt;&gt; all our rates go up from paying for the much more<br/>
&gt;&gt; expensive injuries sustained by non belt-wearers (that<br/>
&gt;&gt; goes for wearing helmets on motorcycles as well).<br/>

states<br/>
they were heavily in effect there - including road block checks  ACCCK LOL)<br/>
<br/>
but what they did there was if you got into a wreck without seatbelts<br/>
ICBC (ins co) would reduce your compesation GREATLY!<br/>
as seat belts were the law<br/>
<br/>
I agree - If it is the law<br/>
and you disobey it and get hurt because of it<br/>
insurace companies should not have to pay<br/>
as the damage will be much greater and in the<br/>
end it is us that pay for insurance that get the higher<br/>
rates to pay because ins companies have to pay out so much<br/>
<br/>
I am an avid seatbelt wearer and my kids have neber been a day without them<br/>
in their life<br/>
after 7 accidents (none my fault so dont bash me LOL) i am thankful i have<br/>
always worn them<br/>
or i probably wouldnt be there<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I also plan to read them the &quot;All creatures&quot; books by James Herroit this<br/>
 summer. They are above their reading level but are so well written and so<br/>
 enthralling.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There are some wonderful cellulose baggies you can get.  You <br/>
 know, cellulose, the fiber that&#39;s in carrots that makes them so <br/>
 crunchy?  I&#39;ve gotten them by mail from a company called 7th <br/>
 Generation in the past.  We wash them out and re-use them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I am attempting to use something other than the Cascade type of dishwasher <br/>
detergent.  I have tried, either singly or in combination, the following:  <br/>
Borax, salt, baking soda, vinegar, Dr. Bonner&#39;s, and a couple of health food <br/>
store brand formulas specifically for automatic dishwashers.  My silverware <br/>
is not completely clean, there&#39;s a film left on, probably from starchy <br/>
veggies and pastas.  A similar film is on the dishes.  I have plastic <br/>
(haven&#39;t found large glass jars yet) jugs for our raw goat&#39;s milk.  I have a <br/>
white film left on these that looks like detergent film, milk film, or some <br/>
combination.  <br/>
 <br/>
 I do not want to give up on this yet.  I am committed to removing the harsh <br/>
chemicals from our home.  But the dirty dishes are a bit embarrassing, I do <br/>
not wish to hand-wash as I am overwhelmed with ill-health and the needs of <br/>
three severely allergic children.  I do not know how much longer my husband <br/>
will hold out on this issue as it is my commitment not his.<br/>
 <br/>
 Any ideas?  Annette &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   I just bought Life Tree. I have no other harsh commercial chemicals here <br/>
but dish washer det. was my last hold out. It freaked me out though b/c we <br/>
eat off these plates. The Life Tree is working fairly well I&#39;d say. I do have <br/>
to re wash a few things each load but I can deal w/ that so far. I wish I <br/>
could find one that works as well as Cascade or electrosol or whatever,but it <br/>
is scary to me to use those types. <br/>
<br/>
    My glasses are coming out fine btw so maybe it would work for you too? <br/>
<br/>
    The other thing I use that I don&#39;t like is a Swiffer. I know it has <br/>
chemicals and makes me shiver. Then I bought the wet ones and I was <br/>
overwhelmed by the smell. Every window was open and I woke w/ a very sore <br/>
throat this Am after using them yesterday. We have alder wood floors and no <br/>
storage so it is tough to find a simple solution. Also floor scrubbing by <br/>
hand and knee is not easy for me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; We use cellophane bags, waxed paper and tin foil.  For those having <br/>
