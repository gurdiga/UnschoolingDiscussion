<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416329427">I absolutely love the relaxed lives we lead as unschoolers.  But I have a <br/>
problem on days where we have to leave the house at an appointed time.  My <br/>
son Colton (12), carries the unschooling approach into getting ready as well. <br/>
 I will explain to him that we have to leave the house at a certain time to <br/>
go wherever, and ask him to get dressed so we can leave on time.  But Colton <br/>
is a dreamy, emotional, and imaginative kid, and I will invariably find him <br/>
ten or fifteen minutes later playing with his cockatiel or reading a book, <br/>
blissfully oblivious to the time.  I frequently end up waiting impatiently by <br/>
the door, tapping my foot and jingling my car keys.  Even when it&#39;s something <br/>
he absolutely can&#39;t wait to go do, he gets ready with a lot of daydreamy <br/>
stops along the way.  Does anyone have any respectful, unschoolerish ideas on <br/>
how I can light a fire under this kid?<br/>

<br/>
I ask them to get ready early, by saying &quot;Could you put on what you&#39;re going <br/>
to wear when we leave and THEN eat?<br/>
(or play<br/>
or read...)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes (Kirby&#39;s karate gear, Holly&#39;s fiddle-class bag) I&#39;ll ask them <br/>
to put their stuff in the car early too, so we can all leave at the last <br/>
minute in happy peace.<br/>
<br/>
When they were little I would just leave earlier than necessary and if we <br/>
actually pulled off getting on the road early, I&#39;d use the extra time to <br/>
drive by and show them something interesting, or to stop at a store for one <br/>
item, or some such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370426257">A couple of things that work around here.<br/>
<br/>
I take 2 choices of clothing to the kid (I&#39;ll bring others if<br/>
neither suits, but since she has selected them initially, there<br/>
are very few &quot;unfavored&quot; choices).  Next pass through the area, I<br/>
bring a hairbrush and desired &quot;trimmings&quot;.  Next pass, I&#39;ll bring<br/>
shoes and socks.   The deal is not that I&#39;m doing nothing but<br/>
walking back and forth - I may answer an e-mail, take &quot;stuff&quot; to<br/>
the car, bank the fire, feed animals or whatever - but every few<br/>
minutes in the course of those preparation for leaving steps, I&#39;m<br/>
helping her stay on track.  When she was 3-4, I really had to<br/>
almost hand over hand the process, now as often as not, she will<br/>
go from the first step to ready without any further prompts from<br/>
me - I&#39;ll hear her head back to her room and the sounds of<br/>
preparation.  But if she gets involved in watching a squirrel or<br/>
a book or whatever, the habit keeps us from devolving into a<br/>
struggle.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is to allow enough time for some transitions,<br/>
changed minds and distractions.  It is a 30 minute drive to most<br/>
every where from here - an hour before I intend to leave, I<br/>
assess what we need to do to get out the door, including the<br/>
food/clothing status (If there isn&#39;t a set arrival time, I may<br/>
wait a little longer, since an error doesn&#39;t matter as much).  If<br/>
we are ready early, then the natural result is a more pleasant<br/>
drive and maybe time to make a favored stop or an unplanned one.<br/>
But because getting ready isn&#39;t wrapped up in unpleasant<br/>
experiences of &quot;Mama Exasperation&quot; there is little resistance to<br/>
doing it.<br/>

Oh, this is like Dylan...<br/>
When he was younger he would go in to get dressed and I might find him a<br/>
half hour later with one shoe on and his sweat pants on his head, the<br/>
legs wrapped around like a turban.   He&#39;d be fighting dragons or<br/>
something.   <br/>
<br/>
Start earlier. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
Plan one little thing several hours before the big thing and get ready<br/>
for the little thing, a walk, a quick trip to the store, the library,<br/>
whatever.   <br/>
<br/>
Talk about it the night before.   Dylan never likes things to be sprung<br/>
on him, he wants a detailed plan, time, etc.  He can be hurried sometimes<br/>
if everyone is hurrying and happy, it&#39;s an adventure, but if people are<br/>
just waiting on him he gets upset and can&#39;t think about what he&#39;s<br/>
supposed to do.   Talk it out the night before. <br/>
<br/>
Wander by his room and remind him where you have to be soon and is he<br/>
almost ready and does he need help... but keep it happy if you can and<br/>
remember being late isn&#39;t the worst thing in the world. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>BINGO!  I&#39;ve thought about this since I originally posted, and realized that <br/>
I worry about being late to things that don&#39;t really matter.  I just have <br/>
this &quot;thing&quot; about being late, and frankly I don&#39;t think I have ever been <br/>
late to anything in my life.  I was even born a day before my due date, lol!  <br/>
Now that I think about it, I think Colton is the wise one here.  I learn so <br/>
much from my kids!<br/>

My child like this is Jared...so dreamy and unaware much of the time.<br/>
My friends comment on how quiet and sweet he is. Well, he&#39;s not here most of <br/>
the time, of course he&#39;s quiet!! lol<br/>
He lives in a dreamland of dragons I&#39;m quite sure since that&#39;s all he has <br/>
drawn since he was four years old!!<br/>
I really wish I could get into his head sometimes...I know it&#39;s gotta be <br/>
interesting.<br/>
But getting anywhere is almost impossible. Anything can be a distraction, <br/>
absolutely anything.....<br/>

Have you asked him to tell you a story?   Don&#39;t ask for what he&#39;s<br/>
thinking about, just someday if you&#39;re alone together tell him you wish<br/>
someone would tell you a story and see what happens.   I have volumes of<br/>

Um...  it doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to do with how many worries one <br/>
does or doesn&#39;t have. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a distractable one. When we get out the door late it&#39;s not usually the <br/>
fault of any of my children, it&#39;s because I got sidetracked somewhere along <br/>
the line. The more worries I have, the more likely I am to get sidetracked. <br/>
It&#39;s possible that&#39;s because drifting is more attractive than thinking about <br/>

stressed I&#39;m less succesful at using the strategies I&#39;ve learned over the <br/>
years to keep myself focused on single goals. :)<br/>
<br/>
Just thought you should know so you won&#39;t be thinking that he&#39;ll get less <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91632698">I don&#39;t know if anyone can get a grain of help here, but this is what I do<br/>
with Brianna.  Sometimes, when I&#39;m running to the store or to the post<br/>
office, Brianna will want to stay alone. She&#39;s 10 y.o. I have a cell phone;<br/>
she&#39;s won&#39;t cook, open the door; tell anyone on the phone that I&#39;m not here<br/>
(&quot;Sorry, coyote is unavailable just now, but I can take a message&quot;, when<br/>
anyone pushes the point, she asks, &quot;If I were an adult, would you still be<br/>
asking for her?&quot;) Anyway, I hate leaving her. But she doesn&#39;t like to dress.<br/>
She&#39;s is a world-class dawdler! She&#39;ll do this and that.now, time to leave!!<br/>
Usually she wasn&#39;t ready.<br/>
Once I started giving her a choice and then leaving it, things changed!<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m going to the market, the bakery and I&#39;d like to stop by Savers, would<br/>
you like to come? She would say &quot;I&#39;ll be all right here&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times she stayed home, calling frequently to the cell phone.<br/>
&quot;Where are you now?&quot; &quot;Are there any ------ there&quot; (That one I would answer<br/>
w/ &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t like leaving you anywhere, so I don&#39;t have time to<br/>
look, you can look next time we&#39;re here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Know what happens?<br/>
5 - 10 minutes before I leave, she&#39;ll ask, do I have time to get ready?<br/>
She does get ready.<br/>
She does look okay.<br/>
We have hair problems to, but the braids work here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This may not work for everyone. I have one child and a protective dog. I<br/>
have only agreed to her staying home when I&#39;m running quick errands. But it<br/>
does work for us.<br/>

Yes, he doesn&#39;t like being &quot;on display&quot; so to speak. He prefers being <br/>
unnoticed and dictating anything puts way to much attention on him.<br/>
I think that&#39;s why he won&#39;t let me anyway.....he keeps to himself a lot and <br/>
doesn&#39;t share much about what he&#39;s thinking.  The only way to draw him out <br/>
(no pun intended here :) is to give him paper and he&#39;ll draw elaborate <br/>
fantasy beings and worlds.<br/>
He&#39;ll tell me all about those, but if he sees me writing it down, he clams up.<br/>
So I listen and smile and ask questions and sometimes I dictate stuff on the <br/>
back of the picture later. So I remember the stories that go with the <br/>
creatures.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I have to get into his world...those days when I&#39;m in a hurry it&#39;s so <br/>
frustrating. But my kids always have a way of reminding me what is truly <br/>
important.<br/>
I kept trying to read an email yesterday but Jalen (that&#39;s the littlest guy) <br/>
kept taking my hand and taking me places. He wanted me to push him on the <br/>
swing, watch him play in the dirt with a Tonka truck etc....<br/>
He wasn&#39;t about to let me sit and read!! Not when the sun was shining and <br/>
there were things to discover. What a smart guy......:)<br/>

&lt;&lt; The more worries I have, the more likely I am to get sidetracked.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yep. Me too...<br/>
But in reference to these &quot;dreamy&quot; type children it is truly a lack of stress <br/>
that causes the behavior.<br/>
Trust me, you&#39;d see it in an instance if you could observe for a day.  He&#39;s <br/>
just thinking and watching things, it&#39;s SO cool.<br/>
I can literally just watch him drift out of this world in a calm, peaceful <br/>
way. His thoughts far from where he is. He is still and quiet and has this <br/>
totally dreamy look about him, like and angel.<br/>
And 9 times out of 10, when he comes to, he&#39;s got some questions for me about <br/>
something really interesting.<br/>
It&#39;s definitely not a distraction from stress!<br/>
But I am incredibly distractable as an adult, so I have NO doubt he could <br/>
easily be too.<br/>

5 - 10 minutes before I leave, she&#39;ll ask, do I have time to get ready?<br/>
She does get ready.<br/>
She does look okay.<br/>

I like it!  I don&#39;t know if it would work for my kid, but it definitly<br/>
works for me.  I truly have to say &quot;no&quot; and have that answer be<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; before I can willingly say &quot;yes&quot;.  It&#39;s important for me to<br/>
KNOW that I have a choice.<br/>
