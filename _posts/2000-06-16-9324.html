<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322767880">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Following is a notice about an upcoming book release -- and more <br/>
importantly, about an alternative learning center in Kyoto, Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Let me stress that I am not in the habit of reproducing press releases (I <br/>
abhor them, generally speaking). But I felt this one warranted an <br/>
exception since it does provide some useful background to the alternative <br/>
learning scene in Japan. This includes the homelearning and community <br/>
learning movements, and the Kyoto school mentioned here appears to be <br/>
supportive of such citizen-led movements in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
I am a Japan-based homelearning parent and have no affiliation at all <br/>
with the Kyoto center. My only motivation in reposting this message here <br/>
(with permission of the author) is the hope that people in and outside <br/>
Japan will more fully understand that home-based learning and other means <br/>
of alternative learning are nowadays *slowly* becoming practical and <br/>
workable options to the mainstream school system here in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
I have recently met face to face with Dayle Bethel, originator of this <br/>
release, in Kyoto and found him to be an individual with decades of work <br/>
in the field of holistic learning in the US and Japan. As I understand <br/>
it, he has been here in Japan for many, many years as head of the Kyoto <br/>
center. He came here at a time when there were far fewer foreigners in <br/>
Japan than there are now, let alone foreigners promoting the &quot;crazy&quot; <br/>
concept of alternative learning methods. But times are changing, and now <br/>
the Japanese public seems to be taking heed of the need for just such <br/>
alternatives to conventional schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the news media in Japan will reportedly be receiving this same <br/>
information about the book and Kyoto center later in the summer, so we <br/>
are getting a bit of a jump on them by sharing it here.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that Mr. Bethel has recently transferred to the TIUJ&#39;s <br/>
sister center in Hawaii, so anyone wanting to get in touch with the Kyoto <br/>
learning center directly can do so through Mr. Motoshi Suzuki at the <br/>
e-mail address noted at the bottom of this release.<br/>

PRESS RELEASE<br/>

Japanese University Included in New Book on<br/>
World&#39;s Most Innovative Educational Institutions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
KYOTO -- Creating Learning Communities, just off the press of Solomon <br/>
Publishing Company (New York, USA), was written, on-line, by an <br/>
international coalition of professional educators and lay persons. The <br/>
book, which has been hailed by some pre-publication reviewers as possibly <br/>
the most revolutionary volume on education of the 20th century, proposes <br/>
a totally new way of thinking about and conducting education, from <br/>
kindergarten to the university. In the words of editor Ron Miller in an <br/>
introduction entitled, &quot;From Schools to Learning Communities,&quot; the book <br/>
reflects &quot;a new way of thinking about teaching and learning, about <br/>
curriculum and testing, indeed about the whole institution of schooling, <br/>
that during the last few years has begun to make a great deal of sense to <br/>
thousands of parents and educators, and to a growing number of social <br/>
critics and futurists.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The International University Japan (TIUJ) in Kyoto is one of the <br/>
educational institutions featured in &quot;Creating Learning Communities.&quot; <br/>
TIUJ is this year celebrating the 25th anniversary of its founding in <br/>
1975. Little noticed in Japan, it has quietly gone about its <br/>
self-appointed task of creating a model of a restructured university <br/>
system. That system, according to Motoshi Suzuki, TIUJ co-director, has <br/>
three unique features that set it apart from traditional universities:<br/>
<br/>
1. The student, rather than teachers and administrators, is responsible <br/>
for learning. Teachers serve as mentors and advisors who support, <br/>
encourage, and share in creating an environment in which the student, <br/>
motivated by the joy, challenge and excitement of gaining new insights, <br/>
can pursue a program of learning jointly planned and agreed upon.<br/>
<br/>
2. The purpose of educational institutions, according to TIUJ&#39;s <br/>
educational philosophy, is to introduce students to and enable their <br/>
direct involvement in the life, history, and planning for the future of <br/>
their local community and bio-region and, at the university level, the <br/>
planet as a whole. The community is the learning environment. Educational <br/>
institutions and organizations, whether they are called schools, centers, <br/>
libraries, or learning support groups, serve as learning  resources which <br/>
students, of any age, and at any time, can utilize. The community, then, <br/>
is the primary source of the curriculum, while books and other <br/>
second-hand information, though important, are for the support of the <br/>
student&#39;s own observations, study, and research.<br/>
<br/>
3. Each student pursues an individualized learning program within a <br/>
human-scale educational structure, a semi-autonomous sub-unit of the <br/>
university, consisting of a maximum of 25 students, a program <br/>
advisor-facilitator, and mentors who are specialists in the areas or <br/>
fields of learning in which the students are studying.<br/>
<br/>
While university education in Japan has changed little during the past 25 <br/>
years, community learning at the elementary and secondary levels has <br/>
mushroomed, spurred by the rise of community parent and student support <br/>
groups and experimentation in a few public schools. The  Family and <br/>
Community Learning Network in Nagoya [Japan] is an example of the former. <br/>
Ojiya Elementary School in Niigata Prefecture -- known  as the School <br/>
with Forest and Meadow -- is an example of a learning community within a <br/>
public school framework.<br/>
<br/>
There is now a growing body of research findings which suggest that <br/>
graduates of alternative, community based learning centers are generally <br/>
more alert, more creative, more highly motivated, more responsible, and <br/>
more socially conscious than most graduates of traditional schools.<br/>
<br/>
According to Suzuki, it is now possible for students to learn in this <br/>
kind of alternative, community learning environment from kindergarten <br/>
through the university. Mr. Suzuki welcomes observations and questions <br/>
from persons interested in finding out more about study in learning <br/>
communities. His email address is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:motoshi@...">motoshi@...</a>-inet.or.jp.<br/>
