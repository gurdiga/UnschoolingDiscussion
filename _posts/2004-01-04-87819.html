bothers me -- adopting the attitude that experts are stupid is no smarter than <br/>

Sandra Dodd, for example, as probably stupid solely because she has the <br/>
temerity to advise others on unschooling and therefore seems to be some kind of <br/>
&quot;expert&quot;, it would be irrational and un-helpful to their unschooling success. :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483322362">We live in an era in which parents hardly trust themselves at all - <br/>
don&#39;t rely on their own good sense, their own experience, their love <br/>
for their own children, their own traditions, their own values, the <br/>
gentle examples of more experienced friends and relatives, but instead <br/>
are &quot;parenting advice&quot; junkies, spending millions of dollars on <br/>
parenting classes, books, magazines, counselors, etc, looking to <br/>
experts to help them make every possible decision. Over-reliance on <br/>
experts makes parents feel they are never doing enough, never making <br/>
good enough decisions. Parents are persuaded by first one expert and <br/>
then another. Their approach to parenting does not come from deeply <br/>
held personal beliefs about what it means to care for and rear a new <br/>
human being - instead they try out the newest parenting fads, often one <br/>
after another, with increasing desperation when they don&#39;t &quot;work&quot; (kids <br/>
are still kids with their own individual strengths and weaknesses) and <br/>
they feel like failures when they don&#39;t feel the deep satisfaction that <br/>
the experts tell them parenting ought to bring them. Relying on experts <br/>
makes parents fearful and anxious about doing the wrong thing since <br/>
they are &quot;not experts&quot; themselves. It drains the confidence from <br/>
parents and the joy from family life.<br/>

feel just horrible when things do go wrong, even if they do think they <br/>
did follow the experts advice and are bewildered by it not &quot;working&quot; <br/>
for them. I&#39;m not sure they are thinking, &quot;It couldn&#39;t be helped,&quot; so <br/>

extremely anxious - either trying to protect their kids from every <br/>
possible danger or trying to create designer kids who are showpieces <br/>
for their &quot;perfect&quot; parents. I think maybe you meant &quot;relax too much&quot; <br/>
as in not spend enough time, thought, energy on their kids, though, and <br/>
that I agree with. For example, some parents &quot;relax&quot; by following the <br/>
expert advice that says let a baby cry for 10 minutes longer every <br/>
night until he/she is sleeping all night.<br/>

<br/>
OTOH, if you had a childhood/family life like mine, or in a different way,<br/>
my husband&#39;s, it is a good thing that the &quot;traditions&quot; that I was reared<br/>
with, such as being hit and screamed at, have been left behind. It is<br/>
through reading parenting books, including some that I found useless and not<br/>
gentle enough, that eventually led me to unschooling. And hearing from the<br/>
experts, as in long experienced, here has helped me more than any examples<br/>
from any friends or relatives. <br/>
<br/>
My mother phoned me to beg me to not have Jayn in our family bed when<br/>
Michael Jackson was arrested, drawing some bizarre mental parallel between<br/>
him and Jayn&#39;s father! This is the same person who told me that she got her<br/>
idea of how a good relationship was supposed to look from movies and<br/>
television soap operas. I didn&#39;t have anyone modeling good gentle parenting<br/>
for me when I was young, or modeling good relationship and marriage skills<br/>
for me. Thank goodness there are other sources of information.<br/>
<br/>
Since Jayn has gotten older, to be reaching the same age that I have my<br/>
earliest memories of being shouted at, spanked, punished and shamed, in some<br/>
respects it has gotten harder for me. I keep having flashes of how I was<br/>
treated when I acted similarly to Jayn is acting. I have utterly rejected<br/>
spanking or punishing her, but sometimes the thought that &quot;one hit and all<br/>
this hysteria would be over&quot; comes unwanted into my head, followed by &quot;good<br/>
thing I WILL NOT EVER hit her&quot;. I had to stop and actually develop a<br/>
strategy for dealing with her unpleasant behaviors (like throwing objects at<br/>
us, or hitting us and laughing hysterically) that bring up feelings of<br/>
powerlessness and anger at her. I already know what my mother would have<br/>
done. I know that I would have been hit for it, instantly and without<br/>
thought. <br/>

Planners who thought they knew what was best for a community without consulting the people that lived in the community. The comment was more general as she had many unkind things to say about her school experience and college (she lasted two years and never finished). She had quite a bit to say on how people are taught to believe what they are told and not what they themselves see so yes, I think Pam&#39;s interpretation is spot on. It&#39;s a warning to people that they should trust themselves instead of the label &#39;expert&#39;.<br/>

that I agree with.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;relax&quot; isn&#39;t right.  But they become defensive of the method and <br/>
expert, not more reflective of their own feelings and responses.  If they feel <br/>
they&#39;re not qualified to HAVE feelings and responses, and the expert says &quot;this <br/>
will take years,&quot; it seems to me they&#39;re off the hook for years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen too many school parents who had blind faith that the school had <br/>
their child&#39;s best interests at heart, and so they did nothing to check on how <br/>
the child was doing emotionally or socially or creatively, but just depended on <br/>
report cards and teacher&#39;s feedback to know their own child.<br/>
<br/>
The people who let their kids cry themselves to sleep because a book said <br/>
to--they HAVE to be thinking of the book or the expert during that heartwrenching <br/>
time, or they would pick the baby up.   They&#39;re blaming someone else for <br/>
their baby&#39;s crying, and not taking responsibility themselves.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Okay put it this way - prevents parents from developing confidence in <br/>
themselves and their own values, decisions, ideas, experiences, logic.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But it seems you&#39;re saying their confidence is in experts.  So their values <br/>
involve deferring to experts.  They decide to defer.  They have the idea that <br/>
experts are good.   Their experience might seem to be that they must not have <br/>
followed the directions, if it didn&#39;t work.  <br/>
<br/>
Logic???<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but you didn&#39;t choose one book or person and glom on there.<br/>
<br/>
I really l iked the Penelope Leach book I had when Kirby was little.  I liked <br/>
her style of writing, and I liked some of her ideas of things to do with <br/>
babies.  But she said &quot;never let them sleep with you&quot; and I had no problem <br/>
thinking, &quot;No, that&#39;s wrong thinking; biological necessity has mammals sleeping with <br/>
their babies in the natural world.&quot;  And she liked school, and that seemed (as <br/>
others have mentioned lately) an abrupt change from the nurturing she was <br/>
recommending for younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Thank goodness there are other sources of information.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And good for Jayn that you&#39;re good at checking several and then making your <br/>
own decisions based on all the &quot;values, decisions, ideas, experiences, logic&quot; <br/>
Pam discussed.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;On another network&quot; (unschooling.com) months ago, we were talking about <br/>
something like how much to trust experts, and I said people needed to read the <br/>
stuff but then think for themselves, to compare sources and read critically, not <br/>
blindly.   Someone went off on that saying she was tired of hearing people <br/>
talk about &quot;critical thinking,&quot; that she didn&#39;t even know what they meant and she <br/>
thought it was just school buzz-word and why was I recommending a schoolish <br/>
thing (or some such). <br/>
<br/>
I was kind of stunned.  Can school ruin even people&#39;s desire to be critical <br/>
thinkers?<br/>
<br/>
By critical thinking I meant thinking at all times that the person you&#39;re <br/>
reading or hearing could be wrong.  I meant that while taking in new information <br/>
one should hold it up to all that they already know and believe, filter it <br/>
through their personal convictions and prior problems, and see if it seems true <br/>
and useful.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think an interest in experts&#39; opinions is bad in any way.   I think <br/>
&quot;over reliance&quot; (I don&#39;t know who used that descriptor, but &quot;over reliance&quot; <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to imply &quot;critical thinking&quot; to me) is the problem.  Laying down our <br/>
thoughts in deference to an expert&#39;s, even if they don&#39;t seem right to us.  <br/>
Some people do.  No people should.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Much of the interview was, of course about cities and city planners. <br/>
Planners who thought they knew what was best for a community without consulting the <br/>
people that lived in the community. The comment was more general as she had <br/>
many unkind things to say about her school experience and college (she lasted <br/>
two years and never finished). She had quite a bit to say on how people are <br/>
taught to believe what they are told and not what they themselves see so yes, I <br/>
think Pam&#39;s interpretation is spot on. It&#39;s a warning to people that they <br/>
should trust themselves instead of the label &#39;expert&#39;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a big fan of Howard Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences.   There&#39;s not a <br/>
good word for &quot;well rounded expert,&quot; but maybe someday there will be.  Maybe <br/>
someday nobody would take ANY advice from a city planner who wasn&#39;t known to have <br/>
some interpersonal awareness, who could think of what people needed and liked, <br/>
and who could interpret what the people with whom he was dealing directly <br/>
seemed to think was good.<br/>
<br/>
Some people can be whiz-bang at something technical and not know the <br/>
difference between extreme full-body disapproval of someone in the room and a happy <br/>
invitation to lunch.   And when those people are planning human experiences <br/>
(malls, classrooms, whatever involves people and human needs) sometimes they <br/>
TOTALLY miss the mark.<br/>
<br/>
I have one mostly autistic kind of adult friend whose party planning used to <br/>
involve inviting everybody she knew because she couldn&#39;t figure out how to <br/>
decide, and she would just say that if two of them hated each other that was <br/>
THEIR problem, not hers.  So she would invite just-broken up couples, roommates <br/>
who had stolen from other roommates and been thrown out, invite all those people <br/>
without regard to the effect on the other guests, because she herself <br/>
couldn&#39;t tell the difference between a tense room and a relaxed room.   All she cared <br/>
was how many showed up, and did they like the food.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m just guessing on that second one actually, because she did try to plan <br/>
enough food, and would have been confused or unhappy had there been much food <br/>
left, so maybe that was mathematical too.)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe in any area in which people are directly involved (like medicine) <br/>
expertise in a person with no human skills is irritating.  And the advice given <br/>
by proclaimed experts who  would easily give advice that wouldn&#39;t work outside <br/>
the theoretical is likely to be unworkable advice.<br/>

follow John Rosemond&#39;s advice - because he is a so-called expert - just <br/>
BECAUSE he&#39;s the expert. I can&#39;t count how many people have defended <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m saying they put their confidence in experts instead of developing <br/>
their own self-confidence and their own values and learning by BEING <br/>
parents who make their own decisions. For many young parents, they see <br/>
their job as deciding which parenting expert they are going to follow <br/>
and then doing it faithfully, they miss out on the experiences the rest <br/>
of us had of taking responsibility for a decision, figuring out it did <br/>
or didn&#39;t work, thinking about what we&#39;re doing, being conscious that <br/>
this is our OWN family and that the guy with Dr. in front of his name <br/>
doesn&#39;t even KNOW our family.<br/>
<br/>
Logic in the sense that they  lose track of commonsense. I have a <br/>
relative who went to some parenting classes put on by a PhD in Early <br/>
Childhood Education. It was stressed that it is important for kids to <br/>
have an early bedtime so that parents get their alone time. The person <br/>
talked about how one of the biggest mistakes young parents make is that <br/>
they want more time with their kids (after work and daycare all day) so <br/>
they keep them up too late and lose out on couple time. Blah blah blah. <br/>
So my relative has this kid who is a little unusual in that he really <br/>
has always needed fairly little sleep - at four he really sleeps only <br/>
about 8 hours and that&#39;s enough for him. He&#39;s never been much of a <br/>
sleeper - not a napper, etc. So - they put the kid to bed at 7:30 or 8 <br/>
- because that&#39;s his bedtime and it is ruining their family life <br/>
because the kid is up and wakes them up at 4 in the morning. They have <br/>
no sense of thinking logically about this problem - all they do is try <br/>
to figure out how to apply the expert&#39;s advice - it doesn&#39;t occur to <br/>
them that the expert doesn&#39;t know THEIR kid and their family and that <br/>
they can work out their own solution. That&#39;s what I meant by reliance <br/>
on experts makes people stop using logic.<br/>

we got because the &quot;experts&quot; were not always sure and gave you the <br/>
simple asnwer: circumsice him.  It took alot of digging and visits <br/>
to a whole slew of different doctors to find an answer we were <br/>
comfortable with.  We did end up circumscising him but not until we <br/>
were sure that was the best thing for him and not the easiest thing <br/>
for the doctor.  We sleep alot better at night knowing we took the <br/>
time to collect the best data and not blindly follow the <br/>
first &quot;expert&quot; urologist and dermatologist we saw.  <br/>
<br/>
It is the same attitude with vaccinations.  My gf looked at me when <br/>
I told her we only chose certain ones, etc. and said &quot;I didn&#39;t know <br/>
you could turn them down.&quot;   I have often spoke up to my doctor when <br/>
something did not sit well with me in terms of nursing, shots, even <br/>
waiting too long.  One time I made them get me another nurse because <br/>
there was so much confusion on which shot we wanted.  She kept <br/>
offering the wrong ones and she was so pissed I refused to let he <br/>
touch my child.  All I need is some angry, most likely underpaid <br/>
nurse to give my child a shot.  No Darn Way!<br/>

that when she took one many years ago, and would<br/>
analyze each question.  <br/>
<br/>
One question was if a horse ate 10 apples in 5 days,<br/>
how many did he eat each day?  They wanted her to<br/>
choose 2, of course, but she sat there and worried<br/>
about it for 15 minutes.  What if the horse ate 3 one<br/>

or feelings.  They are not reliable because they are<br/>
influenced by the sinful desires in your heart.  Spank<br/>
your child even if you feel nauseous and lightheaded<br/>
at the thought of it, because you must not let those<br/>
emotions keep you from doing what is right. <br/>
<br/>
By turning off and ignoring the cues that something is<br/>
wrong, eventually we become numb to those cues.  Just<br/>
like a baby who is left crying for long enough will<br/>
stop, because they have lost hope.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is too painful to turn those receptors<br/>
back on, too.  Change is good, but can rend and tear<br/>
as well.  But the mere struggle is part of the<br/>
rebirthing and letting go process.  <br/>
<br/>
Those who can&#39;t bear the pain go back to the way they<br/>
know.  Those that push through it and beyond end<br/>
up.....unschooling!  WHEE!<br/>

This reminded me of something I was thinking about earlier this <br/>
morning.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always (even when my daughter was first born and supposedly <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand me) explained why we couldn&#39;t do something that <br/>
she wanted to do rather than simply saying &quot;no.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
For example:  we went to sign her up for Gymboree a while back.  Of <br/>
course, as soon as we walked in the door, she wanted to play.  At <br/>
that time, it was the babies in there and she wasn&#39;t able to right <br/>
then.  So, I got down to her level and explained that the babies <br/>
were playing today but that we were going to come back tomrrow and <br/>
then she could play.  She looked at me, said &quot;ok&quot; and walked out <br/>
without a fight.  She spent the rest of the day telling everyone who <br/>
would listen that she was playing at Gymboree tomorrow.  And she was <br/>
as happy as a lark when we went back the next day and she played her <br/>
heart out.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other examples that I could give (I won&#39;t bore you <br/>
with them).  When it happens to happen in front of other people, it <br/>
never ceases to amaze them when she leaves without a fight or fit.  <br/>
All I tell them is that I don&#39;t just say &quot;no&quot; and drag her out of <br/>
the store of take something away.  I tell her why it&#39;s happening and <br/>
she is (almost always) ok with it.  It&#39;s not something that someone <br/>
told me to do, I just figured that I would want to know why someone <br/>
was telling me no so why wouldn&#39;t I extend that same courtesy to my <br/>
daughter?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538822343">That reminds me of my SIL who is a special ed &quot;expert&quot;.  Her son <br/>
started Kindergarten last year with the same teacher his sister had <br/>
the year before (a teacher my SIL had the luxury of picking out but <br/>
that is another story..grrr).  His sister had done exceptionally <br/>
well, but then she is the typical high achiever.  He, although <br/>
reading even better then his sister, struggled with his behavior.  <br/>
My SIL was going mad having her friends observe as well as herself <br/>
to try and figure out what was wrong, even considering if it could <br/>
be ADD.  Her son can sit for hours and play on his own quietly, what <br/>
the heck is she thinking?  She is so conditioned to believe that if <br/>
you don&#39;t fit in the hole there must be something wrong with the <br/>
peg.  This year, he has a new teacher (another one handpicked, <br/>
teacher of the year, etc)  but is doing great.  Turns out he was <br/>
bored and this teacher is challanging him more.  How many kids are <br/>
labled or tested only because they do not match their learning style <br/>
with their teacher&#39;s teaching style.<br/>
<br/>
My other SIL had a similar problem with her 1st grader who loved <br/>
school and did excellent last year.  This year he was having all <br/>
these behavior issues and his teacher commented that he had a <br/>
language issue.  The kid is 6 and can read all the instructions <br/>
during playstation games as well as write extremely well written <br/>
sentences.  She got him moved to another teacher and is he doing <br/>
great.  Hopefully, everything is great from here because chances of <br/>
her being able to move him or her daughter in the next 10 years is <br/>
slim to none.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-200915596">My 14 yo had kind of the same experience when she was 10.  We were <br/>
taking the TAAS on line and one of the questions asked if a carpenter <br/>
has a board 10&#39; long and needs a board that was 6&#39;7&quot; long, how much <br/>
will he need to cut off.  After sitting for a few minutes looking <br/>
confused, she said &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter- he&#39;ll just measure 6&#39;7&quot; and <br/>
then cut.&quot;  That ws the last question she did.<br/>
<br/>
I was the director of an educational center last year where I tutored <br/>
kids and helped them with their school work and this year help kids <br/>
with their homework at the local government school. From kindergarten <br/>
up, the work is confusing because it has no application in the real <br/>
world. It&#39;s easy to say illogical things when you&#39;re not following <br/>
any logic.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Laying down our <br/>
&gt; &gt; thoughts in deference to an expert&#39;s, even if they<br/>

&gt; Many churches teach this.  Don&#39;t rely on your emotions<br/>
&gt; or feelings.  They are not reliable because they are<br/>
&gt; influenced by the sinful desires in your heart.  Spank<br/>
&gt; your child even if you feel nauseous and lightheaded<br/>
&gt; at the thought of it, because you must not let those<br/>
&gt; emotions keep you from doing what is right. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By turning off and ignoring the cues that something is<br/>
&gt; wrong, eventually we become numb to those cues.  Just<br/>
&gt; like a baby who is left crying for long enough will<br/>
&gt; stop, because they have lost hope.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it is too painful to turn those receptors<br/>
&gt; back on, too.  Change is good, but can rend and tear<br/>
&gt; as well.  But the mere struggle is part of the<br/>
&gt; rebirthing and letting go process.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Those who can&#39;t bear the pain go back to the way they<br/>
&gt; know.  Those that push through it and beyond end<br/>
&gt; up.....unschooling!  WHEE!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  It&#39;s not something that someone <br/>
<br/>
told me to do, I just figured that I would want to know why someone <br/>
<br/>
was telling me no so why wouldn&#39;t I extend that same courtesy to my <br/>
<br/>
daughter? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was three or so he tripped on a string that was tied between <br/>
stakes (marking where they were going to put a kind of barrier later).   There was <br/>
grass, so it wasn&#39;t too bad, but I helped him up and walked him back a few <br/>
steps to show him what he tripped over, and to show him where it was strung, and <br/>
help him see that he was big enough to step over it.<br/>
<br/>
An adult friend who saw me seemed amazed, and said so later.  I guess he had <br/>
never seen anyone talk to a little kid that way about something, and he <br/>
thought it was great that I had explained to Kirby what caused him to fall.<br/>
<br/>
I was amazed that he would be amazed, and after that I started watching to <br/>
see how other parents reacted when a toddler fell.  Horribly, often.  I&#39;ve seen <br/>
people grab the kid up by one arm and get angry with them for falling.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen them just say &quot;Oh, you&#39;re not hurt,&quot; without even looking.  (I always ask <br/>
the child if he&#39;s hurt, instead of telling him he&#39;s not.)<br/>
<br/>
So maybe explaining to a child IS really rare, but it&#39;s not rare among <br/>
attachment parenting families or unschoolers, in my experience.  And maybe it&#39;s that <br/>
level of communication and concern that makes unschooling work.<br/>

<br/>
I had saved folders of stuff when Kirby was little.  The circumcision folder <br/>
was put to great use by other families, and I probably still have that <br/>
somewhere (but in this age of websites it&#39;s not as crucial).   One article I loved <br/>
that really helped was someone&#39;s list of 50 things to try if a baby was crying <br/>
and you couldn&#39;t figure out what to do.  I was nursing, so that was always my <br/>
#1.  But other things on the list were things like provide more light; provide <br/>
less light; take some clothes off; put more clothes on.  I thought it was <br/>
interesting to see the range of things that babies might be trying to communicate, <br/>
and it helped me to also go through the things that had happened before and <br/>
really try to pay attention to Kirby&#39;s face and posture to see if I could <br/>
discern what was helping and what was making him more frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the articles, though, were one-time things and I had just saved them <br/>
like talismans.<br/>
<br/>
What really helped me was La Leche League meetings, and seeing the variation <br/>
in the babies there, and seeing other mothers be really patient and creative <br/>
and responsive.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was kind of stunned.  Can school ruin even<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; YES YES YES!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kids are taught NOT to think, just open up like little<br/>
&gt; birds, have the information for the standardized<br/>

&gt; test to make room for the next batch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so true.  I remember a letter I sent home to parents at the end <br/>
of the year, before vacation.  The bottom portion was a contract between <br/>
me and the kid, about how they would read three books over vacation and <br/>
write summaries on them.  The top portion, which they took home was a <br/>
letter letting the parents know this.  It began, Dear Parents:.  3/4 of <br/>
the kids, even though I had read the letter out loud, asked me, &quot;what do <br/>
I do with this.&quot;  I said &quot;read it and figure it out.&quot;  They would read <br/>
it and all of them figured it out.  But they are so used to doing what <br/>
they were told.... Not figuring it out.<br/>
<br/>
And, first day back, about 1/3 of the kids had not done the essays.  <br/>
They read the books but &quot;didn&#39;t know they were supposed to write <br/>
essays.  So I pulled out the contract &quot;did you read this before you <br/>
signed it?&quot;  (I had read it out loud in class too!)  &quot;No, I didn&#39;t read <br/>
it.&quot;  &quot;And yet you signed your name to it!&quot;  Amazing.  I am teaching my <br/>
students, best that I can, to think.  Not all teachers do.  It&#39;s easier <br/>
if they don&#39;t think and just follow directions. <br/>

be generic pictures of a horse, a rabbit, a dog, etc.  Lexie would think <br/>
