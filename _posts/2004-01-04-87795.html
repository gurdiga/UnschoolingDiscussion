<div id="ygrps-yiv-176223054">Just a friendly reminder that the new AOL runs your responses together <br/>
with what you are quoting, making it difficult to read. You apparently <br/>
need to be aware of this and fix it manually, by finding some way of <br/>
separating your response from what you are responding to, before <br/>
hitting send.<br/>
