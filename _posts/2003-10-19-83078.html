There is more fallout from a controversial two-part report on <br/>
home schooling, produced by the CBS Evening News.<br/>
<br/>
During Monday&#39;s &quot;Eye on America&quot; segment, CBS reporter <br/>
Vince Gonzales cited a murder-suicide involving three <br/>
teenagers in rural North Carolina as proof of what the network <br/>
refers to as a &quot;dark side&quot; to home schooling. In that tragic case, <br/>
the children&#39;s parents had been under investigation for abuse <br/>
and neglect and were not abiding by the state&#39;s home school <br/>
law.<br/>
<br/>
But Hal Young, president of North Carolinians for Home <br/>
Education (nche.com), says CBS News overlooked certain <br/>
important facts in its coverage of the story. According to Young, <br/>
if parents commit monstrous acts against a child, there are <br/>
laws in place to deal with that situation. He says educational <br/>
regulation is not meant to be a tool for social services or for <br/>
dealing with criminal activity.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&quot;By highlighting criminal cases that supposedly had a <br/>
connection to home educators, CBS News is trying to create <br/>
a linkage there to adapt the laws, adapt the regulations, to <br/>
do something they are not intended to do,&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
Young was interviewed for the &quot;Eye on America&quot; news report. <br/>
During that interview, he says, the reporters went over the <br/>
same questions several times, and it became apparent that <br/>
CBS had only one objective in producing the report: to portray <br/>
home education as a haven for potential child abusers and <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When they came to speak with me, I think they already had <br/>
their story planned and outlined. I&#39;d have to say it was <br/>
obvious where the story was going,&quot; the home education <br/>
advocate says, adding, &quot;I believe CBS already had a plan <br/>
in mind, and their contact with us was mainly to gather a <br/>
few sound bites.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The CBS Evening News, which is hosted by veteran news <br/>
anchor Dan Rather, has several high-profile sponsors, <br/>
including Cingular Wireless, Honda, Arby&#39;s, Philip Morris, <br/>
and Wal-Mart. Young says in order to hold the network to a <br/>
higher standard of journalistic integrity, families and <br/>
individuals should contact CBS, its affiliates, and advertisers <br/>
to express their concerns about the CBS Evening News <br/>
and its anti-home-schooling coverage.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-382938161">Does anyone think that maybe CBS aired that bit about homeschooling to help the legislation that is currently before Congress?  <br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought I&#39;m floating out there....<br/>
