<div id="ygrps-yiv-251738758">Most of what I have read about unschooling says that it is a very <br/>
casual approach in the sense that you do what the kids are <br/>
interested in at the moment. I, too, have a very casual approach <br/>
because, well, *life* just gets in the way of our *schooling* most <br/>
of the time.LOL  BUT--- I have noticed that my kids handle life much <br/>
better when they have some sort of *schedule*. They seem to get <br/>
stressed out (i.e. sibling fighting, bad attitudes, short tempers <br/>
etc.) when I leave them to their own devices and do not <br/>
impose &quot;schoolwork&quot; on them.  Does anyone else&#39;s kids do this?  As <br/>
far as them going off and delving into subjects all by themselves, <br/>
NO WAY!  They would rather just play! And by playing I don&#39;t mean <br/>
they are re-creating a time period in history or some other <br/>
impressively educational experience.  Just playing.  You know, ride <br/>
a bike, run around, pretending they are animals of some sort or <br/>
whatever.  Average, typical kid sort of playing.  Not to mentinon my <br/>
son would sit and play Playstation for hours at a time if I didn&#39;t <br/>
limit it.  I guess I am wandering all over the place with this post <br/>
but I would like to know about how structure can fit into the <br/>
unschooling philosophy.  And can it?<br/>
Am I missing something about the unschooling philosophy?  Sometimes <br/>
I feel like I really don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; yet.<br/>
Someone enlighten me, please!</div>

&lt;&lt;They seem to get stressed out (i.e. sibling fighting, bad attitudes, short<br/>

etc.) when I leave them to their own devices and do not<br/>
impose &quot;schoolwork&quot; on them.  Does anyone else&#39;s kids do this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No not my kids. They really aren&#39;t into structure much. They prefer to have<br/>
free reign and go at their own pace, no matter what that is. The most<br/>
structured thing would be playdates on certain days of the week. We usually<br/>
have a park day every Tues. which is never timed as far as when we get there<br/>
or how long we stay. Usually Thurs. are craft days with a few other families<br/>
which involves a craft of maybe 20 minutes and then free play time for a<br/>
couple hours. Every Fri. is homeschooling sports camp for 3 hours. Their<br/>
Fridays they won&#39;t miss. The other two are free to take it or leave it<br/>
depending on what is going on with us and who wants to go or not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As far as them going off and delving into subjects all by themselves,<br/>
NO WAY!  They would rather just play! And by playing I don&#39;t mean<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My 3 youngest that unschool do play all day. And I do mean play!!! They are<br/>
9,8 and 3. They watch tv, play games, play video games, play outside, swim,<br/>
draw, create, read, build, role play, etc. That IS their play and they do it<br/>
whenever they want. They learn so much every day. They are always coming up<br/>
with things that sometimes I don&#39;t even know where they got them from.<br/>
They&#39;re kids and the world is theirs to learn whatever interests them. And<br/>
right now if it looks like &quot;just playing&quot; all day, that&#39;s fine with me. Of<br/>
course with my kids, I don&#39;t see it as &quot;just playing,&quot; I see learning all<br/>
the time. If I were looking for learning in schoolish terms, I would<br/>
probably not see much at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess I am wandering all over the place with this post<br/>
but I would like to know about how structure can fit into the<br/>
unschooling philosophy.  And can it?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think structure can fit in well with unschooling as long as the structure<br/>
comes from the child and not the parent. I know of a few unschooled kids<br/>
that make their own schedules, starting and stopping at their leisure. It&#39;s<br/>
when it&#39;s imposed and forced that it stops being a part of unschooling for<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
As far as getting it, I think you are looking in terms of learning from<br/>
school standards. That&#39;s something that a lot of people have a hard time<br/>
giving up and seeing any other way.<br/>
<br/>
Read the boards, stay here and read. Read the archives and Sandra&#39;s sites.<br/>
Try to rid yourself of what learning is in school terms. You will see a<br/>
whole new way of looking at things!<br/>

can keep them a bit more busy with some fun activities or going out to <br/>
fun places and ease them into having more &quot;free&quot; time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are more choices than &quot;leave them to their own devices&quot; and &quot;impose<br/>
&#39;schoolwork&#39; on them&quot;. Unschooling generally falls into those other choices.<br/>
So you might be involved in cooking with them and talking to them and<br/>
watching movies with them and reading books to them and with them and<br/>
playing board games and video games with them and being nearby so that when<br/>
they are on their own and one or more of them becomes irritated with the<br/>
company of their siblings you can defuse before the bomb goes off, or help<br/>
patch up a problem that does occur.<br/>
<br/>
We sometimes have a daily schedule of some sort to meet (like when we have<br/>
outside appointments or tv shows that are important to someone) but mostly<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; far as them going off and delving into subjects all by themselves,<br/>
&gt; NO WAY!  They would rather just play!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because they are more advanced unschoolers than you are. :) Playing<br/>
IS their work, and their learning. And I don&#39;t mean:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they are re-creating a time period in history or some other<br/>
&gt; impressively educational experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I mean:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Just playing.  You know, ride<br/>
&gt; a bike, run around, pretending they are animals of some sort or<br/>
&gt; whatever.  Average, typical kid sort of playing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All the time they are running and riding and pretending and being average<br/>
typical kids, they are learning, processing, blowing off steam so that the<br/>
next time they get the urge to do some serious thinking their bodies are<br/>
relaxed and fit and healthy and they can do so.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Not to mentinon my<br/>
&gt; son would sit and play Playstation for hours at a time if I didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; limit it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is limitless learning in life, and Playstation is no exception. My<br/>
daughter has learned almost everything she knows about reading through<br/>
playing video games that require reading. From us reading the screens to<br/>
her, and her playing them over and over, she has progressed on her own.<br/>
<br/>
Limiting Playstation does nothing more, in my opinion, than develop an<br/>
artificially high desire for it. My daughters have never had limits on how<br/>
much tv, or how long playing video games, and they fluctuate from playing<br/>
for days on end to not looking at the various game systems for weeks. Where<br/>
there is no deprivation there is no fear-induced gorging.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t. And I don&#39;t mean that harshly -- it&#39;s one of those things that<br/>
can take some time to &quot;get&quot;. This list will help.<br/>
<br/>
When you stop thinking of play as &quot;just play&quot; and learning as &quot;real work&quot;<br/>
and &quot;subjects&quot;, you&#39;ll have a made a big step.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that sometimes helps new unschooling parents is to keep a journal<br/>
-- just for your own benefit, not for the kids to participate in directly --<br/>
of what your kids do all day every day and every possible small bit of<br/>
learning you notice they produce from their activity. When they&#39;re<br/>
pretending to be tigers, are they mentioning that tigers eat meat? Have<br/>
stripes? Pounce on prey? Have large fangs? If little Beulah most often<br/>
pretends to be a giraffe, she might very well like a giraffe video or poster<br/>
or book, to take or leave just as she could take or leave a new stuffed<br/>
animal you casually handed her. Playstation game guides only improve reading<br/>
and strategy skills. A costume tail or a pair of ears for the animal players<br/>
will improve the game, and the games is what they&#39;ll learn from.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308657793">Finally got back online. Celyn is now 8 weeks old. Very needy - she screams when not being held. I&#39;ve learnt to pee at high speed ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Physically she is doing ok although she is behind &#39;normal&#39; babies. Its too early to tell how handicapped she will be as the brain damage is in the basal ganglia which controls voluntary movements. As a 8 week baby she doesn&#39;t really make any purposeful movements as yet.<br/>
<br/>
Fingers crossed.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve spent an awful lot of time watching day-time TV as I need to hold or feed Celyn contsantly. Luckily the other 3 have re-discovered Runescape and spend a lot of time playing that. Mind you, Heather has got into chemistry big time and asks questions about valence and atomic bonds. Usually when I&#39;m up to my armpits in nappy-soup.<br/>

A lot.  You don&#39;t. Read the archives here. Go to www.SandraDodd.com; read <br/>
there. Go to www.unschooling.com; read there. Read, read, read. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect learning to look like &quot;subjects&quot; or historical reinactments. <br/>
Expect it to look like PlayStation, riding bikes, and acting like animals---you <br/>
know, typical kid stuff. That&#39;s how they learn!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is NOT school, so it shouldn&#39;t *look like* school.<br/>
<br/>
You need to read more and enjoy your children more. *Watch* the learning <br/>
happen in front of your eyes.<br/>

<br/>
Got it, though it did fail to say &quot;all day&quot; which is my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
I would watch a good three hour movie all the way through if someone didn&#39;t <br/>
stop me.  (Luckily, they rarly stop me and sometimes watch parts or all with <br/>
me!)<br/>
<br/>
I would stay up laughing with a friend I hadn&#39;t seen for years until 3:00 <br/>
a.m. if someone didn&#39;t make me go to bed.  (I&#39;m rarely sorry when that happens; <br/>
it can be wonderful.)<br/>
<br/>
I would eat until I wasn&#39;t hungry anymore if people didn&#39;t make me stop.  <br/>
(Ceasing to eat when one is no longer hungry, without regard to &#39;cleaning a <br/>
plate,&#39; is really quite a mark of maturity and self awareness.)<br/>
<br/>
I would stay on the computer for hours sometimes if my husband let me.  [I <br/>
did yesterday, because interruptions (fun ones, mostly) caused it to take four <br/>
hours for me to get through the e-mail and unschooling.com&#39;s message boards.]<br/>
<br/>
If it sounds worse when applied to adults, that means people are not having <br/>
as much respect as they could have for children.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The car keys scenario came up yesterday or Monday (at the message boards, I <br/>
think)--that without rules kids will drive the car (meaning little kids who <br/>
don&#39;t have a driving clue).   But it didn&#39;t fit the format, so I didn&#39;t save it, <br/>
but isn&#39;t it an interesting &quot;threat&quot; (on a short list of traditional threats) <br/>
that being strict, rule-applying, limit-making parents keeps children safe <br/>
from being hit by a truck, driving a car with no training, shooting heroin right <br/>
then and there, and playing video games all day?<br/>
<br/>
And here we are with three non-rule-bound, never hit by truck, never seen <br/>
heroin, stop playing games when they&#39;re finished, always-unschooled kids about <br/>
whom nobody complains?  Relatives, neighbors, friends, all impressed by my kids&#39; <br/>
behavior and attitude.  (Maybe not always impressed by haircuts and clothing <br/>
and teaparty manners.)  Police instructors at Junior Police Academy Marty <br/>
attended at 14 SURE we have lots of rules and discipline at our house, because <br/>
Marty is so attentive and courteous.<br/>
<br/>
It can&#39;t be, then, that deprivations are necessary.<br/>
<br/>
This post was in response to nothing but Kelly&#39;s post, as I know I&#39;ll be <br/>
interrupted soon by the arrival of a baby I&#39;m holding this morning, and I am not <br/>
reading the e-mail in order; sorry.<br/>

You can&#39;t see unschooling until you know what it looks like.<br/>
It&#39;s not about &quot;delving into subjects,&quot; it&#39;s about learning.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some people do handle life better when they have some sort of <br/>
schedule. My kids often like to make up a loose schedule for the day -<br/>
 we call it a day plan, just so that they make sure that we fit in <br/>
the things that they really want to do. That way I can set aside <br/>
time, where otherwise things might slip past. But that&#39;s miles <br/>
different than imposing a schedule on them. You can always ask -<br/>
 &quot;hey, do you want to sit down and make a plan for the day?&quot;  it <br/>
that&#39;s something that they&#39;re interested in.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes my kids do this. It&#39;s usually a sign that I&#39;ve gotten too <br/>
distracted with my own stuff and need to come hang out with them and <br/>
do stuff. If they&#39;re short-tempered or fighting, a wrestling match on <br/>
the bed, or baking something hands-on in the kitchen (kneading bread <br/>
dough or gooey cookies is a good one), or going outside to wander <br/>
down to the creek with them are all good options that don&#39;t involve <br/>
imposing schoolwork.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things here. <br/>
1)It&#39;s hard to say this if you haven&#39;t ever *tried* unschooling for <br/>
any given time. Kids who are made to do &quot;schoolwork&quot; will most <br/>
naturally avoid it when given time away from it. They might avoid <br/>
anything that looks vaguely related to school subjects for hours, <br/>
days, months, or years, depending on their reactions to it. There&#39;s <br/>
usually a time period known as &quot;deschooling&quot; when kids stop going to <br/>
school or doing school-at-home where the kids just need to decompress.<br/>
2) Learning for kids *is* play, and play is learning. If learning <br/>
isn&#39;t shown to them as something separated out and different from <br/>
everyday life, it will just be a natural and joyous part of their <br/>
every day existance. Right now, my kids are playing with Legos. They <br/>
might do it for a few minutes or a few hours, and I can guarantee <br/>
that they&#39;re not reinacting a historical battle with the Lego <br/>
figures. :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it can, if the child desires structure and creates it. My <br/>
son, who is a Legomaniac, usually builds all kinds of interesting <br/>
creations of his own imagining. Every now and then, he&#39;ll pull out <br/>
the instructions for something (he saved them all in a box in his <br/>
room) and sit down and build for hours from the instructions. That is <br/>
structure that he&#39;s imposing. My daughter at age 3 asked for violin <br/>
lessons. She is still taking them, chooses to go, chooses to practice <br/>
every day, wants to make the pieces of music sound better, asks for <br/>
my help, etc. That&#39;s structure that she&#39;s imposed. Other things are <br/>
much more freeform. I guess it&#39;s the same in my life, some things I <br/>
choose structure, some things I choose none. It seems like the <br/>
natural way to go about things.<br/>

&gt; Someone enlighten me, please!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To really get unschooling, you need to let go of all of the ideas <br/>
about life, learning, play, the way children&#39;s minds work, what <br/>
children &quot;need&quot; etc. that our schooled society has told us <br/>
are &quot;truths&quot;. For me, this happened over a period of years when my <br/>
kids were young and I spent my nursing time on the couch with a copy <br/>
of &quot;Learning All the Time&quot; by John Holt or &quot;Dumbing Us Down&quot; by John <br/>
Taylor Gatto, or &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; by Grace <br/>
Llewellyn. Later, I found email lists, bulletin boards, etc. like <br/>
this one where these ideas were discussed in greater deail and in <br/>
real life situations. All of that immersion helped to free my own <br/>
mind from some of its preconceived notions about learning <br/>
and &quot;education&quot;. This list is a great resource. If you hang out here <br/>
for awhile and read, you&#39;ll see plenty of interesting situations <br/>
where unschooling plays out in real life.<br/>

<br/>
Have you got a sling for Celyn? Since she wants to be held all the time, it<br/>
sounds like a lifesaver for you and her. I wish I would have known about<br/>
them with my kids. Unfortunately when I did with the last child, she hated<br/>
it. I think the only kid in the world that didn&#39;t like the sling. Figures!<br/>

leave a couple of bites on your plate. The hostess, thinking he was just not<br/>
hungry, successively served smaller and smaller portions, until the poor guy<br/>
was rushing out to buy fast food before each meal to avoid starvation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791976356">** Finally got back online. Celyn is now 8 weeks old. Very needy - she <br/>
screams when not being held. I&#39;ve learnt to pee at high speed ;-)**<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Shyrley, it&#39;s good to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
I used to pee holding my baby (for months!) and I learned to poop at <br/>
very high speed.  I also took 90 second showers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very hopeful about Celyn&#39;s brain development and will send you all <br/>
my positive vibes.  (Yes, I am a crunchy Californian.)<br/>
<br/>
Doctors used to say that all the recovery that could be made after a <br/>
stroke would be made in the first year and then the situation was <br/>
hopeless.  (Such cheerful fellows!)  But my mom&#39;s boyfriend is over 70 <br/>
and in the third year after a major stroke he still makes progress, <br/>
albeit slowly.  And recent medical statements in the media have <br/>
acknowledged (paraphrasing) &quot;Yeah, we were wrong.  Progress does occur <br/>
after the first year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a very old brain can outperform the expectations of the medical <br/>
community, I would think a very young brain would have even more <br/>
potential to amaze us all.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning doesn&#39;t have to look anything like school. Schooled-at-home <br/>
kids whose parents teach them with Konos and other unit study <br/>
curriculums expect their kids to be doing historical recreations and <br/>
other impressive &quot;educational&quot; things (in the way that you&#39;re meaning <br/>
educational).   But unschooling isn&#39;t about everything always looking <br/>
like it came out of konos.  Real life learning often doesn&#39;t look <br/>
anything like something that you&#39;d do in a school-at-home <br/>
curriculum.  Have you read John Holt&#39;s &quot;How Children Learn&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about letting go of schoolish ways and schoolish <br/>
expectations.  It doesn&#39;t work if the mom says she won&#39;t teach <br/>
anymore but still expects the kids to spend their time doing <br/>
schoolish things.  <br/>

Good point.  I swear it took me a couple of years reading about <br/>
unschooling to realize this.<br/>
<br/>
I kept waiting for my son to be interested in something like &quot;Geology&quot;, <br/>
or at least &quot;Rocks&quot;.  I was thinking he had no interests!  Then my brain <br/>
unfroze and I realized that Pokemon IS an interest.<br/>

And map reading.<br/>
And research.<br/>
And notation.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby bought an index for Nintendo Power Magazines before he could read, and <br/>
I would help him look up game tips, when there Nintendo Power was on Issue #60 <br/>
or so.  He still has every issue he ever got, in order, in boxes, and the <br/>
indexes (he bought another one later; nowadays it&#39;s probably online) taught him <br/>
the notation for 72:30 (issue 72, page 30) which is the same kind of notation <br/>
used for the Bible, and Shakespeare, and other magazine research.<br/>
<br/>
He learned to read maps because of the map of the game of the first Mario <br/>
game for original.  It probably helped him to learn to read left to right, <br/>
because that&#39;s the way that game went.<br/>
<br/>
And that was just starters, for a kid who was five and six years old. <br/>
