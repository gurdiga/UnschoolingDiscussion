<div id="ygrps-yiv-834997906">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Abby, mom to 3 daughters, 5yo twins and an 11mo.  I love lurking on<br/>
this list and am learning more and more about unschooling, so thanks for<br/>
that. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about handling birthday and other holiday gift issues<br/>
as far as the rest of the family is concerned.  I&#39;ve been told that I&#39;m<br/>
being too much of a control freak by asking the grandparents, aunts and<br/>
uncles to limit toys.  For my baby&#39;s first birthday next month I&#39;m<br/>
considering asking them to donate a book to our tiny public library in<br/>
the baby&#39;s name instead of loading her up with toys.  Other than that, I<br/>
have no idea how to curb the over-giving.  Can anybody share experiences?<br/>
 What about for the older kids?  My girls love to play dollhouse with<br/>
anything--dinosaurs, Spider-man figurines, even colored pencils.  No<br/>
matter what kinds of toys they get, they turn them into families or<br/>
friends and have roles for each of them.  That is the kind of play they<br/>
most enjoy, but nobody ever wants to get them yet another set of<br/>
&quot;people,&quot; and I&#39;m not sure I want them to have that much stuff anyway.  I<br/>
just feel like they have too much stuff and I don&#39;t know how to stop the<br/>
accumulation.  Any advice would be appreciated.<br/>
TIA,<br/>

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to give a child something you thought would be wonderfully <br/>
interesting to him, how would you feel if another person nixed it?<br/>
<br/>
Gifts are gifts.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a really bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you think a child can overloaded with toys?   She won&#39;t play with them <br/>
all right away, but over the years she will probably learn from all of them.  <br/>
 Kids play with different toys differently as they get older.  My kids still <br/>
have and play with things they&#39;ve had for years and years.  I put them away <br/>
sometimes and bring them out sometimes and they present new opportunities.  <br/>
That&#39;s the mainstay of my whole &quot;strewing&quot; principle (some new stuff, some re-run <br/>
stuff, left out to be discovered or rediscovered).<br/>
<br/>
-=-That is the kind of play they<br/>

I think you should worry about storage of what they do have and like, and not <br/>
spend energy wishig the world to be different.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
They&#39;re not very old!  Toys and playing are their best learning <br/>
opportunities.  I would no more limit toys than I would tell a kid &quot;Stop reading books, <br/>
you&#39;ve read enough&quot; or &quot;you&#39;ve asked ten questions today,and that&#39;s your limit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Learning needs input and experience, and if you have relatives willing to <br/>
give you more toys, be happy!  Your older kids might TOTALLY love whatever the <br/>
baby gets for her birthday.<br/>

I completely agree with Sandra, and also would like to add another thought.<br/>
<br/>
The Grandparents and Aunt who loved and cared for my children are now gone <br/>
from their lives, due to a car accident, cancer, and stroke. The family they <br/>
have left do not give a crap about them enough to think about their birthdays, <br/>
let alone buy them a present.<br/>
Instead of worrying about your children receiving too many toys, maybe you <br/>
should just be thankful they have family in their lives who care enough to find <br/>
the time to buy the gift, and to celebrate their birthday with them.<br/>
So many times in life, we take for granted the importance of even the <br/>
simplest gestures, because we are so busy with our own agenda. Just let life happen, <br/>
and learn to find the positive, and not the negative.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have never known a kiddo that had too many toys!!  Or wouldn&#39;t absolutely <br/>
love to have more.<br/>
<br/>
Your twins are at the age when toys are starting to have tons of <br/>
possibilities.  When they are really little they have fun manipulating and exploring the <br/>
toys they have, at this age they continue to do that but also use those huge <br/>
imaginations they have.<br/>
<br/>
When our relatives overload the kids with gifts (especially since all of our <br/>
relatives are very distant) we are very appreciative.  Overwhelmed, yes.  For <br/>
the last couple events, we have put the &quot;overflow&quot; goodies away until they are <br/>
asked for or when we feel like strewing in some &quot;new&quot; stuff.  Our closets are <br/>
stuffed with stuff that&#39;s still in boxes and it has become more a challenge <br/>
to store the stuff than anything else.  We are planning a yard sale and my 6.5 <br/>
year old is so excited to make some money for all the stuff he no longer needs <br/>
or wants.<br/>
<br/>
The grandparents and others miss seeing the kids grow up and love to stay a <br/>
part of the magic of little ones in the family so they participate by buying <br/>
things for them.  My oldest loves to talk on the phone with the family and then <br/>
when I talk to them they ask me about buying something for him that he&#39;s <br/>
&quot;into&quot; right now.  Mine always love to brag about who sent them what.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s really important to you to limit the toys, then maybe ask the <br/>
relatives to send money for a piggy bank, or savings bonds, or clothing you may need <br/>
for them, etc.  We asked everyone once to not send any more stuffed animals <br/>
cuz they are expensive and my kids don&#39;t play with them ever.  We have chains <br/>
from the ceilings filled with the cutest dust collector&#39;s you&#39;ve ever seen.  <br/>
Once in awhile we throw them all down for cleaning and they fiddle with them for <br/>
a minute, then they&#39;re off to do something else.  So the collection is lesser <br/>
now and the money isn&#39;t being wasted, they send other stuff instead.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; being too much of a control freak by asking the grandparents, aunts and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I certainly understand feeling overwhelmed by the consumerism of our<br/>
culture, with every occassion being a time to get more and more stuff.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is important to remember that your children may not (and at<br/>
their ages, probably don&#39;t) share your beliefs.  Things to consider:<br/>
<br/>
1) Even though it may feel to you that your home is overflowing with toys<br/>
and stuff.  For that child, it is the only birthday they will have for a<br/>
tremendously long time.<br/>
<br/>
2) I would never tell someone what kind of gift to give but you might ask<br/>
your relatives if they have considered giving activities rather than things<br/>
(perhaps a home-made coupon book with pages for fishing with grandpa or<br/>
making cookies with grandma &lt;my kids love these&gt;) or perhaps memberships at<br/>
the zoo or children&#39;s museum, movie tickets, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101873397">We do put the new stuff away and we rotate toys often, but we are<br/>
seriously running out of room here.  My mother and MIL will easily spend<br/>
$200 per kid per birthday.  I don&#39;t even want to know what they spend at<br/>
Christmas.  I just think it&#39;s a bit much. I&#39;m all for the sentimentality<br/>
of knowing that Grandma gave them such and such, but isn&#39;t there room for<br/>
that with limits?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s the relatives that spend the most who seem to not care what<br/>
the kids are &quot;into.&quot;  They&#39;re usually just going down the toy aisles<br/>
chucking things into the cart with nobody in particular in mind.  The<br/>
relatives who really know them and spend time with them don&#39;t do that. <br/>
My dad buys everybody a book and writes inside it, &quot;I thought you might<br/>
like this because of x,y,z...Grandpa,&quot; usually along with a simple toy<br/>
that he buys with them in mind.  I think that&#39;s going to mean more to<br/>
them in 20 years than all of the crap that the other relatives buy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Why do you think a child can overloaded with toys?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe not overloaded, but overwhelmed with all the choices. Just my<br/>
experience with my own children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; She won&#39;t play with them <br/>
&gt;&gt;all right away, but over the years she will probably learn from all of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>them.<br/>
<br/>
So, I should keep accumulating thousands of dollars worth of toys every<br/>
year because some day they *might* learn from all of them?  We don&#39;t have<br/>
enough room in our house for that.  Has anybody here struggled with the<br/>
space issue when it comes to too much accumulation?  If so, what have you<br/>
done about it?  It hasn&#39;t been an issue until this year.  Now it&#39;s just<br/>
too cramped here and I am overwhelmed with the amount of toys we have.  I<br/>
am also overwhelmed at the thought of getting so many more in the next<br/>
month.  It seriously stresses me out.  I&#39;m not trying to take fun away<br/>
from my children, but there has to be a happy medium.  We can not<br/>
continue to accumulate toys at this rate.  I appreciate the advice about<br/>
being happy that we have people who want to give them things, and I&#39;m<br/>
sorry for those of you who don&#39;t have anybody, but I think this is a<br/>
different issue.  We&#39;re not talking about a few well-chosen gifts.<br/>

&gt; cuz they are expensive and my kids don&#39;t play with them ever.  We <br/>
&gt; have chains <br/>
&gt; from the ceilings filled with the cutest dust collector&#39;s you&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; ever seen.  <br/>
&gt; Once in awhile we throw them all down for cleaning and they fiddle <br/>
&gt; with them for <br/>
&gt; a minute, then they&#39;re off to do something else.  So the collection <br/>
&gt; is lesser <br/>
&gt; now and the money isn&#39;t being wasted, they send other stuff <br/>
&gt; instead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1161783955">Hi Abigail,<br/>
I wondered if you could not suggest a small toy & a savings bond or even only a savings bond.  Since they want to spend the money for the children - do they help with clothing?  Maybe 1 outfit & 1 toy.  Then again, let them buy the toys & you purchase the savings bonds etc.  lol<br/>

one special gift carefully and if they would like, you are also asking  that <br/>
anything over one gift be brought so your child can take and donate it to a  <br/>
homeless or battered women&#39;s shelter or a child in a group home or something of <br/>
 the sort.<br/>
 <br/>
After my son died I had people who normally would have been a part of his  <br/>
birthday celebration and they weren&#39;t sure whether they should mention Jack&#39;s  <br/>
birthday or say nothing or do something or do nothing.<br/>
 <br/>
The next birthday after he died we sent out little invitation type cards  <br/>
saying that we are honored so many people remember Jackson&#39;s short life and a  <br/>
little verse about how our friends had touched us in so many ways, etc., and  <br/>
offered if they would like to celebrate Jack&#39;s short life they could donate an  <br/>
age appropriate toy to the local women&#39;s and children&#39;s shelter.  Many did,  <br/>
many family friends who buy gifts for the other children still bring along a  <br/>
gift that would be age appropriate for Jackson and ask us to drop it off at the <br/>
 shelter or other place of our choosing.<br/>
 <br/>
My children, who are mostly grown now, enjoying going by with a new toy for  <br/>
these kids who have so little in life, maybe your twins will enjoy sharing <br/>
their  bounty with others as well.<br/>

Just a thought.<br/>

Well then you should emulate your dad when you give gifts.<br/>
<br/>
But it might be worth considering multiple intelligences.  A kid who loves <br/>
sports and is good at kinesthetic activities but not verbal might think a book <br/>
is the biggest waste of money and space of all time.  And conversely, to give a <br/>
bookish kid a football because the giver thinks the kid should get out and <br/>
play instead of reading is not a good gift.<br/>
<br/>
Your children are one and four and they don&#39;t need books as much as they need <br/>
toys.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  I just think it&#39;s a bit much. I&#39;m all for the sentimentality<br/>
of knowing that Grandma gave them such and such, but isn&#39;t there room for<br/>
that with limits?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
You mean can&#39;t you call the shots?<br/>
No.<br/>
Do you want your kids telling you what you can give your grandchildren?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, I should keep accumulating thousands of dollars worth of toys every<br/>
year because some day they *might* learn from all of them? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you already know the answer and just wanted us to agree, you asked the <br/>
wrong list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Has anybody here struggled with the<br/>
space issue when it comes to too much accumulation?  If so, what have you<br/>
done about it? -=-<br/>
<br/>
We got a bigger house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  I am also overwhelmed at the thought of getting so many more in the next<br/>
month.  It seriously stresses me out. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Breathe deep breaths, think lovely thoughts, and figure out how to NOT be <br/>
seriously stressed out, for the sake of your kids.  Causing friction between you <br/>
and their grandchildren is not a way to lessen the stress.<br/>
<br/>
If your relatives live nearby and have a bigger house, maybe you could ask <br/>
them to store the off-season toys, or the cycled-out-for-now toys, and every few <br/>
months you could trade some boxes in and out from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57234846">Three suggestions other than telling people not to give your kids toys:<br/>

Ask for tickets to shows.<br/>

Get a storage shed - $200 for a really big Rubbermaid shed for outdoors.<br/>

You&#39;ll be getting rid of toys, eventually, in favor of new ones. It <br/>

You don&#39;t have to KEEP anything people give you - just let the kids <br/>
play with them and take a picture and enclose that with a nice note <br/>
saying thank you for the gifts. Then donate them to Goodwill.<br/>

 <br/>
Nah, I don&#39;t think so.  I don&#39;t think just ANYTHING that Grandma gives  a <br/>
kids is special.  Special things are special.  My mil had been  giving my <br/>
teenagers shirts or sweaters for Christmas for years that they NEVER  wore.  They did <br/>
NOT appreciate them and she had no idea what kind of  clothes they liked.  <br/>
Her health started to slip and by the time they were  grown she had started <br/>
giving them gift certificates, and it was so much better  than a shirt or sweater <br/>
they would never wear!<br/>
 <br/>
My mother gives my youngest son stuff that she&#39;s picked up on her  <br/>
travels...old maps or interesting things that she gets as freebies as a senior  citizen. <br/>
 Even if it&#39;s not something he really wanted or fit his interests,  it&#39;s at <br/>
least an oddity or a novelty that can hold more than an obligatory  interest.  <br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t say that my mother knows my kids better than my mil.  I think  she <br/>
just puts more zing into her gift ideas.  Yeah, the kids are going to  miss both <br/>
grandma&#39;s when they&#39;re gone, but they&#39;re not going to cherish totally  <br/>
irrelavent gifts no matter what.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m completely against the kind of toy-giving you&#39;re talking about.   How <br/>
about a little thought for the receiver?  How about a little  relationship to get <br/>
to know what the kid is all about?  Can&#39;t buy  love.<br/>

that will make them see that we really do have a problem with storing all<br/>
of these toys.  They only see the toys that are currently being played<br/>
with; they never see the tubs and tubs that are overflowing our closets. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746666621">&lt;&lt;&lt;Also, it&#39;s the relatives that spend the most who seem to not care what<br/>
the kids are &quot;into.&quot;  They&#39;re usually just going down the toy aisles<br/>
chucking things into the cart with nobody in particular in mind.  The<br/>
relatives who really know them and spend time with them don&#39;t do that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Basically what we do with Jayn&#39;s gifts, taking into account her dislike of<br/>
surprises, is ask her what she would like from a specific relative, like<br/>
Nan. Last Christmas she chose Mommy&#39;s Little Patient a couple of months<br/>
before. She got a huge amount of joy in anticipation, and in telling<br/>
everyone that Nan and Grandpa were going to give her that particular<br/>
present. She would have been really upset if anyone else had tried to give<br/>
her that doll earlier. Naturally Nan was on board with this, and did not try<br/>
to get some other thing, which would have been devastating. I would suggest<br/>
creating a list with your kids of specific toys they would like, and then<br/>
distributing this to some of the relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we are lucky with all of dh&#39;s family, because they have a tradition<br/>
of distributing lists of desired items and checking up with people about<br/>
what they might like. For them this is more important than surprise. I was<br/>
pretty startled by this when I first joined the family. However it seems to<br/>
work. Dh&#39;s mother likes to give clothes or homemade jewelery to Jayn, but<br/>
always checks with us first about colors or styles (from catalogues). We<br/>
usually run the suggestions by Jayn first. My mother OTOH seems to have a<br/>
real line onto what Jayn will like to wear in the dresses she makes or buys<br/>
as surprises. Sure has changed from when I was a little girl and spent my<br/>
entire childhood hating most of my clothing.<br/>
<br/>
For her last birthday Jayn wanted a Maleficent doll from Disneyland. She<br/>
told everyone that she was getting this, with enormous excitement making her<br/>
unintelligible. (Many confused looks from friends and neighbors). On no<br/>
account was I permitted to buy the doll for her on any earlier visit to<br/>
Disneyland. Tears ensued when I offered to do so.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was a baby, we sometimes asked family members for the money for<br/>
her bank account (actually a Mutual Fund).<br/>
<br/>
Below is part of a post that I sent about toys last time this question was<br/>
active. There was a lot in that thread about some really creative storage<br/>
solutions also. The thread was actually called &quot;Violent toys?&quot; if your want<br/>
to search the archives.<br/>
<br/>
Quote Begins:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Now the only criteria I use for whether I will buy a toy are: 1/ Jayn<br/>
(4.5) has actually asked for it; 2/ We can afford it; 3/ We have the room<br/>
for it in our apartment. (She can hardly wait for a new room so she can have<br/>
a dolls&#39; house). *All* her toys are learning tools, and the issue of quality<br/>
has been one that I have also let go of. For example, I was only interested<br/>
in getting her nice paints and real bristle paintbrushes. She asked for the<br/>
really cheap little watercolor trays that come with coloring books, and<br/>
likes using those awful cheap brushes they come with to scrape on the paper,<br/>
along with her good brushes. She has often gotten just as much out of the<br/>
dolls that come with her Happy Meal, as she has out of her collectible<br/>
Barbies - and boy do I feel better about her pulling those ones apart to<br/>
turn them into puppets, or repainting their clothes different colors.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I let go of my anxiety about her destroying any of her own things,<br/>
as long as she is doing it deliberately and mindfully - transformation not<br/>
destruction. I mean, if she is throwing something in a fury, I try to<br/>
prevent the damage since I know she will be sorry later, but if she is<br/>
cutting their hair knowing it won&#39;t grow back - well they are her things,<br/>
not mine. She also has a bunch of porcelain dolls, of which she is very<br/>
careful.<br/>
<br/>
How does Jayn discover the toys she wants? TV, internet, catalogues,<br/>
browsing at stores, visiting friends, seeing some toy/tool Daddy has bought<br/>
for himself. Least successful: adults buying her some unseen or unasked for<br/>
toy and giving it to her as a surprise. Sometimes she gets downright angry<br/>
and insists we take it back to the store.<br/>
<br/>
I have always disliked those electronic toys along the lines of Lets Pretend<br/>
Elmo (is that the right name?) that direct the child&#39;s play. I think<br/>
disliking them allowed me to feel superior somehow. Jayn solves that problem<br/>
with pretty much all the dolls she has that talk, by choosing to switch them<br/>
off. What a concept: she is in charge of her own playing and there is no<br/>
&quot;right&quot; way to use any of it! I can trust her to use all her stuff in ways<br/>
far beyond the instructions.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Further to this, we have just spent a charming afternoon repainting her<br/>
Fisher Price plastic farmhouse with what she evidently considers more<br/>
realistic colors.<br/>

leaving the receiver empty.  I&#39;ve seen this as my nieces and nephews have<br/>
grown.  The orgy of toys that really don&#39;t have anything to do with their<br/>
interests translates into the feeling that the giver didn&#39;t really think<br/>
about the child.  Where my 11 yo niece used to just not play with the<br/>
toys she didn&#39;t like, she now confides in me that she feels like grandma<br/>
is trying to buy her love or apologize for things with gifts.  It&#39;s<br/>
wonderful that she sees this on her own, and I know my kids will get<br/>
there too, but maybe that&#39;s the real root of my issue with all these<br/>
toys.  Wow, therapeutic. ;)<br/>

Unschooling is deeply, profoundly different from school and school at home.  <br/>
Toys are good things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602217913">Maybe your mil and the others who want to spend alot of money would be happy to buy some activity -- say 2 months worth of dance, or horseback riding lessons, or karate, or whatever it is your kid would be interested in trying, or already do.  <br/>
 <br/>
My inlaws have offered to pay for things like karate or little league, because they really think those are beneficial for the kids and know we can&#39;t always afford it.  Dh is an only child and my fil planned retirement well enough that they can easily afford to buy the kids extras -- and it brings them joy.  We explain to the kids that such & such is a gift from G&#39;pa and G&#39;ma, which also gives them something to talk about when they speak to their grandparents.  <br/>

My mother and MIL will easily spend $200 per kid per birthday.  I don&#39;t even want to know what they spend at Christmas.  I just think it&#39;s a bit much. I&#39;m all for the sentimentality of knowing that Grandma gave them such and such, but isn&#39;t there room for<br/>
that with limits?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s the relatives that spend the most who seem to not care what the kids are &quot;into.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
This is an idea that is nagging at me. I want to say that it can&#39;t be the<br/>
responsibility of relatives, especially geographically distant ones, to know<br/>
what the kids are into, without receiving that information somehow from you<br/>
or the kids themselves. Are they getting enthusiastic, joyful letters or<br/>
phone calls about the cool stuff the kids and you are all doing? <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is hard to talk to disapproving relatives about Unschooling. Is<br/>
this part of the problem? If so it is an issue that gets canvassed here<br/>
quite a lot, and there may be ideas in that area also.<br/>
<br/>
Do they sense your disapproval of their past gifts, and so communication has<br/>
already been damaged?<br/>
<br/>
Or do they genuinely not care, but are just sending mass quantities of<br/>
expensive gifts for forms sake? (Ask for the money instead??)<br/>

entirely devoted to things for her grandchildren - toys, blocks, art <br/>

She also collected picture books and had a fantastic collection. It was <br/>
the hardest - most painful - thing to divide up after she died - my 2 <br/>

stack after another of picture books and just took turns each picking <br/>
one. None of us has young children anymore - but all of us intend to <br/>

books and spending hours and hours reading to our grandchildren from <br/>
them.<br/>

<br/>
  Also, it&#39;s the relatives that spend the most who seem to not care what<br/>
  the kids are &quot;into.&quot;  They&#39;re usually just going down the toy aisles<br/>
  chucking things into the cart with nobody in particular in mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Could you offer to go shopping with them? Or throw them ideas? Sometimes those people buy any old thing because they don&#39;t have a clue and might appreciate it if you offered some help. It&#39;s their right to refuse of course.<br/>
   <br/>
<br/>
  My dad buys everybody a book and writes inside it, &quot;I thought you might<br/>
  like this because of x,y,z...Grandpa,&quot; usually along with a simple toy<br/>
  that he buys with them in mind.  I think that&#39;s going to mean more to<br/>
  them in 20 years than all of the crap that the other relatives buy.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That&#39;s what you think but it&#39;s not what may be true. Your kids will have their own ideas about that. I have great childhood memories of crappy toys that were likely bought with little thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So, I should keep accumulating thousands of dollars worth of toys every<br/>
  year because some day they *might* learn from all of them?  We don&#39;t have<br/>
  enough room in our house for that.  Has anybody here struggled with the<br/>
  space issue when it comes to too much accumulation?  If so, what have you<br/>
  done about it? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Our house is under 800 sq. feet. The toys are not confined to one room but are part of the whole..um..decor? I sort it all. One rubbermaid tub for Barbies, another for small animal toys. No puzzle stays in its box but gets dumped in a ziplock bag with the picture cut out. I have one bucket for dinkies, one for Transformers (my DH&#39;s old ones and my daughter LOVES these). I know we have too much because I have to rearrange everything when a new toy comes into the house. My livingroom looks like a rec room. But, I can&#39;t get rid of this stuff. It&#39;s not mine.<br/>
<br/>
   It hasn&#39;t been an issue until this year.  Now it&#39;s just<br/>
  too cramped here and I am overwhelmed with the amount of toys we have.  I<br/>
  am also overwhelmed at the thought of getting so many more in the next<br/>
  month.  It seriously stresses me out.  I&#39;m not trying to take fun away<br/>
  from my children, but there has to be a happy medium.  We can not<br/>
  continue to accumulate toys at this rate.  I appreciate the advice about<br/>
  being happy that we have people who want to give them things, and I&#39;m<br/>
  sorry for those of you who don&#39;t have anybody, but I think this is a<br/>
  different issue.  We&#39;re not talking about a few well-chosen gifts.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  You need to share this with the gift givers if they&#39;re open to it. Another thing...would some like to give gifts like annual museum r zoo passes? Magazine subscriptions? <br/>
<br/>
  I DO know the feeling of dreading Xmas because of all the work I&#39;ll have to do to fit everything in. But it always does fit. Granted, every room in the house has toys somewhere. Oh, but there&#39;s one advantage to lots of stuff that I&#39;ve noticed. It&#39;s that my kids can recognize that some of it doesn&#39;t have any value and so it can be given away. The idea of a few special toys sounds good (I bought it for ahwile) but can give material possessions a weight they might not deserve. <br/>

We&#39;re refinancing this summer and repairing and renovating the basement so it&#39;s liveable (and so the many rodents, large and small, no longer use it to winter in) I KNOW the basement would not be the top priority if we weren&#39;t unschooling. But I can&#39;t wait. I&#39;m dreaming of wide open space to race around in, several different TV&#39;s and gaming systems, old mattresses thrown down to wrestle on...Fun is my top priority in renovations now. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have the same problem with space.  Right now, we just put them wherever <br/>
they&#39;ll fit.  Eventually stuff will be outgrown and we give it away.  And there&#39;s <br/>
always eBay!!!  Like I said before, have a yard sale and let the girls &quot;make <br/>
money&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do YOUR kids feel about the toys?  Are they overwhelmed but lovin&#39; it?  <br/>
Is it just you that has the problem with space and such?  Would you feel guilty <br/>
giving the gifts away cuz your kids will go nuts if they lose one thing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would just talk to the gift givers and tell them that you and the kids are <br/>
ovewhelmed with the toys but would absolutely love tickets and things like <br/>
that to events or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This past year I was talking to my mom and she wanted to know what the kids <br/>
would enjoy for X-mas and I knew they would be getting stuff from all over and <br/>
suddenly I came up with season passes to Busch Gardens/Water Country.  It&#39;s <br/>
expensive for us but we manage each year, but what a great idea for grandma and <br/>
grandpa to give and it helps us too.  So we have a gift that will last nearly <br/>
8 months and both kids love to go and they can&#39;t wait to tell the g-parent&#39;s <br/>
what they did on this visit or that visit.  Do you have anything like that <br/>
nearby that you enjoy but don&#39;t want to have to pay for?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a big house, over 3300 sq ft.  It still gets stuffed to the gills<br/>
with &quot;stuff.&quot;  What is amazing to me is that the kids rarely play with it.<br/>
They play with each other.  Right now, one kid is at a shoot with his dad.<br/>
One is spending the week with a friend.  One is feeding the deer some corn<br/>
and the other two are dragging each other around in circles by their legs.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to your kids.  What do they want to do with their stuff?  Do they want<br/>
to see about storing it?  Do they want to make &quot;wish lists&quot; for relatives?<br/>
Do they want to have a garage sale?  Do they want to see about donating<br/>
some?  Do they want to see about keeping some at grandma&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
I think you can come to a solution you all can live with.  The thing is it<br/>
is YOUR house too so you shouldn&#39;t have to live your life with<br/>
claustrophobia due to the accumulation of stuff.  But it ISN&#39;T your stuff.<br/>
It belongs to wonderful little kids that you love and want to be happy.<br/>
Look for a balance.  Look outside the box.<br/>

&gt; Well then you should emulate your dad when you give gifts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it might be worth considering multiple intelligences.  A kid who loves<br/>
&gt; sports and is good at kinesthetic activities but not verbal might think a<br/>
book<br/>
&gt; is the biggest waste of money and space of all time.  And conversely, to<br/>
give a<br/>
&gt; bookish kid a football because the giver thinks the kid should get out and<br/>
&gt; play instead of reading is not a good gift.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your children are one and four and they don&#39;t need books as much as they<br/>
need<br/>
&gt; toys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-  I just think it&#39;s a bit much. I&#39;m all for the sentimentality<br/>
&gt; of knowing that Grandma gave them such and such, but isn&#39;t there room for<br/>
&gt; that with limits?  -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You mean can&#39;t you call the shots?<br/>
&gt; No.<br/>
&gt; Do you want your kids telling you what you can give your grandchildren?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-So, I should keep accumulating thousands of dollars worth of toys every<br/>
&gt; year because some day they *might* learn from all of them? -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you already know the answer and just wanted us to agree, you asked the<br/>
&gt; wrong list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-Has anybody here struggled with the<br/>
&gt; space issue when it comes to too much accumulation?  If so, what have you<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Breathe deep breaths, think lovely thoughts, and figure out how to NOT be<br/>
&gt; seriously stressed out, for the sake of your kids.  Causing friction<br/>
between you<br/>
&gt; and their grandchildren is not a way to lessen the stress.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If your relatives live nearby and have a bigger house, maybe you could ask<br/>
&gt; them to store the off-season toys, or the cycled-out-for-now toys, and<br/>
every few<br/>
&gt; months you could trade some boxes in and out from them.<br/>

-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was straightening up the library (which has mostly books, and <br/>
gaming stuff, but also some toys that need space, and that adults like).  We have <br/>
three sets of marble works and a hot-chocolate can full of marbles.  I <br/>
vacuumed a whole end of the room for visiting kids to play with those.  (I kept some <br/>
kids while their parents went to see Spiderman.)<br/>
<br/>
I took Kirby&#39;s gaming stuff carefully off the table up there and put out the <br/>
Spanish castle blocks.  I undid some structures, but left a couple of tricky <br/>
things (how a window fits into a tower) and put the papers/booklets out, but <br/>
that didn&#39;t get played with. It&#39;s still there.  I imagine Marty or the next <br/>
teens or young men who come by will find it irresistable.<br/>
<br/>
When do people &quot;outgrow&#39; realistic castle blocks?<br/>
I think our first problem with those will come when it&#39;s time to decide which <br/>
grown child inherits them.<br/>
<br/>
We have a wooden rocking horse puzzle someone made with a band saw out of 2&quot; <br/>
thick wood, and stained the pieces afterward.  It&#39;s flat but when it&#39;s put <br/>
together it can stand up and rock.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby got it when he was too little to work it, from his grandparents.  But <br/>
it&#39;s a beautiful thing, and it comes out from time to time and now the kids all <br/>
know how to do it and find it easy.  (Not all pices fit together from the <br/>
same side, so it&#39;s a bit tricky.)   It&#39;s apiece of art, and I would pack it <br/>
carefully and stick it in a shed before I would give it away or sell it.  It&#39;s <br/>
Kirby&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe packrats have an easier time with unschooling, and maybe not.  I think <br/>
if someone lived sparsely, more trips out to see, hear, touch, play, taste, <br/>
and smell would be necessary. My kids really like being home, more than I <br/>
thought they would.  More than I did when I was their ages.<br/>
