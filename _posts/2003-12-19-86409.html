<div id="ygrps-yiv-677848840">&quot;I am feeling like such a horrible mother right now. Megan was just evaluated<br/>
 this morning by the Early Intervention Team. We were worried about her speech,<br/>
 she had basically no words until the end of August (turned 2 on August 3), but<br/>
 her speech is blossoming since then, but it still isn&#39;t that<br/>
 clear...understandable, but not clear.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I feel badly about something, I examine it carefully. Guilt can be a very good teacher...IF (and only if) we learn what it needed us to learn and let the guilt go.<br/>
The fact that she isn&#39;t speaking much would not concern me a bit.<br/>
My Jalen didn&#39;t speak more than single (very unclear) words until the last few months and he&#39;s going to be three in Feb. I can see that he is a very intelligent, capable human being. He will talk when/where and if the need arises. He&#39;s barely able to put three words together at the prompting of his siblings (they find his gibberish highly amusing) but uses two words a lot now. He is not delayed. He is Jalen. Learning what he needs, when he needs it. And he has the all important &quot;na na&quot; word down, what else does he need!!?:) (that&#39;s his word for nursing)<br/>
<br/>
I wish you hadn&#39;t had Megan tested...I realize you may not have had a choice, but it just makes you see your child differently and doesn&#39;t help them in any way.<br/>
It sounds like you have a lot of issues going on in your family right now. I would read a lot of unschooling and gentle parenting books to see if there are areas you could strengthen in your interactions with the children. Beyond that, I think it&#39;s time to get a lawyer if homeschooling is going to continue and you want to get social services out of the picture.<br/>
It does concern me that there was spanking and such an issue at the doctors office that she felt she needed to call outside help in. I don&#39;t think that kind of interaction with your children will help unschooling blossom at all. Have you read &quot;Whole child, whole parent&quot;? An excellent book for any parent, but especially if you&#39;re looking to make changes.<br/>
It&#39;s obvious you love your children a lot. Either there is truth to what these people are saying or there isn&#39;t. If not, then stand up for yourself and take a course of action to end all the intrusion. I wish I could give really great advice about how to go about this, but I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t. I do think you need to know your legal rights though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185867993">Don&#39;t feel badly about Megan, my son Evan [now aged 28 and very verbal] had a very limited vocabulary at age three, I was so concerned myself that I had taken him for hearing tests believing that he may be deaf.  His hearing test came back perfect, and still at three he could only say about thirty words, so his IQ was evaluated and that put him at about 130.  So he could hear and he had a well functioning brain and cognitive skills, so what could the problem be?   <br/>
<br/>
Well 25 years later I still don&#39;t know, he had speech therapy which I believe was mostly a waste of time, I&#39;ll never forget his little brother aged 2 helping him with his pronunciation.    <br/>
<br/>
Relax, two is very young to be overly concerned, especially since you mention that her &quot;speech is blossoming&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  My son had a speach &quot;delay&quot; and we went the route of therapy for <br/>
him.  I don&#39;t think it helped him, but I don&#39;t really regret it either because <br/>
they had some really great toys for him to play with.  I think he had to talk <br/>
on his own time schedule, not some chart&#39;s.  At 2 years, 2 months he tested at <br/>
the 15 month level and at three years he tested at the 4 year plus level.  <br/>
Whatever that means to the makers of the charts and tests, it just meant to us <br/>
that he decided to talk.  Oh, and his year younger sister would often answer the <br/>
therapists questions for him while he was busy putting together puzzles they <br/>
laid out in front of him.<br/>
<br/>
His memory of therapy at age five?  Learning the Five Green and Speckled <br/>
Frogs song from Suzi (therapist), Suzi had the best toys and how shocked everyone <br/>
was when he played with the boggle junior came and said, clearly, &quot;C A T, that <br/>
spells cat.&quot;  He thinks that&#39;s funny.  He still doesn&#39;t spontaneously spell <br/>
cat or read cat, but he figured out what the game was trying to do and thought <br/>
he&#39;d let everyone know.<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to relax.  Talk a lot to your children, assume they know what <br/>
you are saying (they do) and could talk back if they wanted.  My worst days were <br/>
the ones where I fretted over his speech or, worse, got mad about it.  My <br/>
best days were listening to him use his own words, or half words, to communicate <br/>
and celebrating his advancement.  My best and worst days are defined the same <br/>
way still, I guess, just in terms of different worries...<br/>
<br/>
OH, and Einstein didn&#39;t talk until four or five, as I remember.  Didn&#39;t utter <br/>
a word.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61991491">My son Luke is 4 1/2 and has a wonderful vocabulary.  Problem is, <br/>
people outside of our immediate family can rarely understand him.  <br/>
I&#39;m always translating what he says.  He is improving, slowly.  He <br/>
used to repeat the first sound of every sentence he said &quot;Like Like <br/>
Like Like Like this&quot;.  Now he doesn&#39;t do that anymore.  I am having <br/>
him treated homeopathically and the remedy he&#39;s on is one that people <br/>
who have unclear speech often need.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the same child who still uses his pronouns incorrectly.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad that my he&#39;s not my oldest, because I used to be all school <br/>
at homey and probably would have had him enrolled in speech therapy <br/>
classes.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;s so outspoken that his speech is a blessing. ;)  Once <br/>
we were at a museum and the museum guide was really talking down to <br/>
my kids (You know how sometimes older people talk to little kids as <br/>
if they&#39;re idiots? My kids hate that.)  Well, Luke piped up with &quot;Us <br/>
knows how to do it, you stupid man&quot;.  I held my breath and looked at <br/>
the man, who obviously didn&#39;t have a clue what he said because he did <br/>
the &quot;Oh, yeah&quot;, smiling and shaking his head thing that people do <br/>

I don&#39;t really see Megan as being any different, she&#39;s still herself. The delays may have been there regardless of anything we could have done differently in the past year. <br/>
 <br/>
Last night, we went to a Christmas party being thrown by the local WIC office. My oldest found a girl she knows from Brownies and went off to play with her. My son doesn&#39;t care for parties, and was terrified of Santa. That&#39;s the way he is...he doesn&#39;t like crowded situations, loud noises, or people in costumes. I don&#39;t blame him really! He stayed by me, and we really got a kick out of watching Megan who seemed to totally be in her element. She waited pretty patiently in line for a two year old I think, then went straight to Santa. She sat on his lap, looked him over VERY careful, touching his sleeve and his beard and poking his nose. Then she smiled really wide and gave him a big hug. She got down, went over to &quot;Mother Goose&quot; (a lady who told nursery rhymes and played her acoustic guitar, both Chistmas and toddler-type songs), and she just ran back and forth between Santa and the other children. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s been quite awhile since she&#39;s been anywhere with more than just a handful of children, so I wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d do. She went over to MG and sat right down with the other kids. She played &quot;Where is Thumbkin&quot; and then signed &quot;More&quot; and waved her hands as they do in the song with the line about &quot;Family&quot; (we&#39;d begun teaching her a few signs because of her not speaking). <br/>
 <br/>
She danced and played, and kept finding little ones just learning to walk and she&#39;d hold out her hand to them and walk with them; if she saw any child upset, she&#39;d walk over and hug them. <br/>
 <br/>
I watched her through all this, and I didn&#39;t think one second about her &quot;developmental delays&quot; but rather &quot;Wow, what a sweet child I have.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
About our family...maybe all of this lately has been God trying to show us where we need to get things together. We&#39;ve been paying attention, and things are getting better lately. Like I said before, I&#39;m not perfect and I&#39;m not unwilling to admit when I&#39;m wrong. Yes, things were pretty much &quot;just fine&quot; but in some ways (spanking) they weren&#39;t; and was &quot;just fine&quot; what we really want things to be - are we being truthful about the way things go - and if not, what needs to change and how? <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re getting there. I have spoken with a lawyer about DSS, and his advice was to play it cool and work with DSS, use it as an opportunity to scrutinize our lives and really see if changes could be made for the better and make any changes. Going up against this doctor could ruin us as a family, he said, because of the way we&#39;re &quot;transient&quot; (military)and she&#39;s &quot;well established&quot; and &quot;considered the BEST pediatrician between Provincetown and Boston;&quot; regardless of how many people know me and the children and know how well I truly do interact with them. But to use this as an opportunity to take the good things about our family and strengthen them, would be the best &quot;revenge.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
Specifically in regards to the homeschooling, he said to continue as we feel is best; we are the parents, and have the right to make the decisions for our children&#39;s educations. He wasn&#39;t wild about us not using a curriculum, because it makes things difficult to &quot;prove&quot; things, so I&#39;m keeping a log of the educational things she does. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683341762">I read your article about Conor. Thanks! I have really had to fight thinking about my oldest in terms of her &quot;ADHD&quot; label from the school system and recognize her as she is. LOL I&#39;m getting better...my friend&#39;s two oldest children keep bringing up somthing that happened about a week and a half ago. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah got dressed for church in jeans and a tank top, and threw on a jacket over it. We got to church, and she hung up her jacket. The girls FREAKED &quot;OMG, Miss Beth, Sarah&#39;s wearing a TANK TOP in the winter and there&#39;s snow outside and isn&#39;t she cold?!&quot; I looked over at my daughter, standing there with this look on her face like &quot;Am I trouble now?! What&#39;d I do?!&quot; and I just smiled at her, and said &quot;So what?&quot; to the girls. They spit and sputtered and I just said &quot;Sarah is Sarah. If she is fine in a tank top, that&#39;s her choice. If she gets cold she&#39;ll put on her jacket. I&#39;m not worried about it.&quot; I make warm clothes available to her. I&#39;m not going to make an issue out of it if she chooses to wear something else. <br/>
<br/>
Especially when I&#39;d do the same, and have! I wouldn&#39;t want to wear a bulky, heavy sweater under a bulky winter coat either. <br/>
<br/>
But still in the back of my mind is this label they&#39;ve given Sarah...it&#39;s quieter now than it used to be...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717717690">I did that growing up for my younger brother Jeremiah, who is now nearly completely deaf. It was just natural for me to look out for him. I have noticed that Logan will do this for Megan. They are only 15 months apart in age, and are often thought to be fraternal twins. <br/>

<br/>
My youngest is like that.  At 10  he&#39;s learned a lot of coping mechanisms.  <br/>
But one of the best things I&#39;ve ever done for him was invest in a pair of <br/>
industrial headphone type hearing protection (huge $12 investment &lt;g&gt;).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reminded of it because he used them again yesterday while he was <br/>
vacuuming cat litter that he spilled.  I saw him standing there working the vacuum <br/>
hose with one hand, right ear to shoulder, left hand to left ear (his typical <br/>
loud noise pose).  I knew he wouldn&#39;t be very efficient and he would tire of it <br/>
more quickly like that and there would still be cat litter to be vacuumed when <br/>
he was done.  So I went and got the headphones and he ended up doing a perfect <br/>
job of vacuuming cat litter!  <br/>
<br/>
He was also deathly afraid of clowns from about the age of 6 months, and has <br/>
never even stood near a live Santa.  He&#39;s not afraid of clowns anymore, but he <br/>
won&#39;t have anything to do with them if they&#39;re around.  He won&#39;t go near <br/>
Santa because he thinks he&#39;s too old for that!  But we just adapted to his level <br/>
of tolerance and it just never became an issue.<br/>

present a highly advanced cutting-edge curriculum such as this one:<br/>
This is an elementary Course of Study which is a revision and extension <br/>
that I wrote of Carol Narigon&#39;s Unschooling Curriculum combined with <br/>
stuff based on on the California State Standards and some child <br/>
development stuff that I just made up.  There is another document like <br/>
this one but for secondary level students, too. Both of these documents <br/>
are in the files area of this list and anybody can download them and <br/>
use them or modify them for their own purposes. They are Word <br/>
documents. Carol&#39;s original unschooling curriculum written for her own <br/>
family, is on Sandra&#39;s website at &lt;sandradodd.com&gt;.<br/>

ACME Academy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Course of Study<br/>
<br/>
Elementary Students<br/>
<br/>
ACME Academy is a private full-time day school established in <br/>
compliance with the Education Code of the State of California. Because <br/>
we believe that the family is the most fundamental social institution <br/>
and the preferred means of caring for, preparing, and training children <br/>
to be productive members of society, ACME Academy promotes and supports <br/>
a family-centered education through our independent study program.<br/>
<br/>
At ACME Academy, independent study, in which children learn primarily <br/>
under the immediate direction, guidance, and support of their parents <br/>
and other caring and involved adults, offers an outstanding educational <br/>
opportunity by providing a natural learning environment, extensive <br/>
real-world experience, flexibility of schedule, and the ability to <br/>
respond to the specific needs and inclinations of the child. Each ACME <br/>
student’s program is developmentally appropriate, integrated and fully <br/>
individualized, and continually built upon student strengths and <br/>
interests throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
English: ACME students will develop knowledge of, and appreciation for <br/>
literature and the language, as well as the skills of speaking, <br/>
reading, listening, spelling, handwriting, and composition.<br/>
<br/>
Students will read from self-chosen or parent-chosen literature on a <br/>
regular basis and will engage in reflection on those literature pieces <br/>
in a variety of ways, such as: journal writing, book reviews, <br/>
conversations, drama based on the books, book clubs. Our educational <br/>
goal is for ACME students to read for pleasure, to gain exposure to a <br/>
wide variety of genres, and to be able to reflect critically on what <br/>
they read.<br/>
<br/>
Students will read content-related non-fiction materials to support <br/>
their chosen areas of interest. They will reflect on these pieces in a <br/>
variety of ways, such as: journal writing, writing articles for <br/>
submission to magazines or newspapers, discussions, or development of a <br/>
scrapbook in an area of interest. Our goal is for ACME students to <br/>
learn to read critically for information, to understand and be able to <br/>
reflect on materials read, to be able to compare them to other sources <br/>
of information, and to learn how and where to find written resources as <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
Writing, spelling and grammar will be covered as part of ACME students’ <br/>
natural writing processes. Students will develop their ability to write <br/>
creatively, to write letters and lists, to create and write drama <br/>
pieces, informational essays, persuasive articles, etc. Our goal is for <br/>
ACME students to enjoy writing, to gain expertise in both the writing <br/>
process and in technical writing and editing skills, and to develop a <br/>
sense of power over the written word<br/>
<br/>
Science: ACME students will develop their knowledge of the biological <br/>
and physical sciences, with emphasis on the processes of experimental <br/>
inquiry and on the place of humans in ecological systems. They will <br/>
relate these to areas of specific student interests by engaging in <br/>
hands-on activities, watching science videos, reading related written <br/>
materials, conducting scientific experiments, keeping journals, making <br/>
and recording observations, visiting scientists in their work places, <br/>
visiting local science museums, participating in science fairs and <br/>
workshops, and through cooperative learning. Our goal is for ACME <br/>
students to experience a wide range of scientific exposure, to develop <br/>
a positive interest in science, to learn to think scientifically, to <br/>
develop a respect for the work scientists do, and to understand the <br/>
importance science has in daily life and in the overall environment.<br/>
<br/>
Social Sciences: ACME students will develop their understanding of the <br/>
social sciences and humanities by reading and discussing fiction and <br/>
non-fiction materials, participating in field trips to historic and <br/>
politically or culturally significant sites, or through discussion and <br/>
debate. Anthropology, economics, psychology, geography, history, <br/>
political science, and sociology are fully integrated into the students <br/>
studies in a wide variety of ways, such as: the use of time lines and <br/>
maps, discussion, journal writing, cooking, plays, road trips, <br/>
invention building, field trips, and art. Our goal is for ACME students <br/>
to develop a foundation for understanding the history, resources, <br/>
development, and government of California and the United States of <br/>
America; the development of the American economic system including the <br/>
role of the entrepreneur and labor; the relations of persons to their <br/>
human and natural environment; eastern and western cultures and <br/>
civilizations; and contemporary issues including the wise use of <br/>
natural resources.<br/>
 <br/>
Health and Physical Education: Health and physical education will be <br/>
fully integrated as a part of daily living skills and participation in <br/>
the wider community with an emphasis upon the physical activities that <br/>
my be conducive to health and vigor of body and mind. Students will <br/>
learn to care for their health and physical environment in a variety of <br/>
ways, such as: shopping for and preparing food, discussing the <br/>
necessity of a healthy diet, participation in fire drills and other <br/>
emergency preparedness activities, exercise both as play and as part of <br/>
a structured group experience and through camping, hiking, and other <br/>
outdoor activity. Our goal is for ACME students to appreciate the <br/>
necessity of a healthy body and to develop lifelong habits of regular <br/>
exercise and good nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
Visual and Performing Arts: ACME students will develop their knowledge <br/>
of art, music, and drama through informal and structured methods in a <br/>
variety of ways, such as: art classes, instrumental lessons, choral <br/>
singing, listening to various styles of music, learning about the <br/>
people who have influenced music through history, or working on <br/>
individualized or group projects that relate to music, art, and drama, <br/>
including acting and performing in a variety of venues and genres. Our <br/>
goal is for ACME students to enjoy a wide variety of art, music, and <br/>
drama experiences, including performance, while developing an <br/>
understanding and appreciation of the importance of art, music, and <br/>
drama as creative expressions of human life experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Mathematics: ACME students will develop mathematical concepts, <br/>
operational skills, and problem solving through participation in daily <br/>
real-world activities such as cooking, building, shopping, budgeting, <br/>
computing, etc. Mathematics materials will be chosen to support <br/>
students’ individual learning styles in order to achieve competency in <br/>
operational skills and insight into problem-solving procedures.  Our <br/>
goal is for ACME students to gain a strong conceptual knowledge of <br/>
mathematics as well as an appreciation for the daily applications of <br/>
mathematics in their lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598470679">We registered our home education program for our first child when she <br/>
was five. Drawing on my ps background to fashion a sort of chain maille of our <br/>
own &lt;g&gt;, I wrote something up to send in with our registration, so it would <br/>
be on file if anyone ever questioned us down the road. I called it an <br/>
&quot;independent education program&quot; specifically for her, a written plan like a gifted IEP <br/>
would be. <br/>
<br/>
       I wrote it in educationese but very deliberately from the point of <br/>
view of serving HER -- her individual needs and goals -- rather than of serving <br/>
the demands or standards of various curriculum areas like science, math and <br/>
reading. <br/>
<br/>
       This is the big difference in unschooling imo -- it serves the child <br/>
rather than the child serving it. :)<br/>
<br/>
       I wanted to make it clear we knew what we were doing and why, but also <br/>
to spell out that schoolish things could actually interfere with her learning <br/>
and thus were purposely being omitted as harmful. We would not be pretending <br/>
to do these things because we opposed them as not good for her.<br/>
<br/>
       So rather than just having no curriculum or plan, here our written <br/>
&quot;Purpose&quot; for dd&#39;s independent education program (unschooling):<br/>
<br/>
       To recognize and encourage the development of her intelligence, <br/>
creativity, insight, humor and special aptitudes and interests, while fostering <br/>
healthy physical, social and moral growth;<br/>
<br/>
       To sustain a flexible, authentic learning environment that fully <br/>
engages her aptitudes and abilities:<br/>
<br/>
       To stimulate and challenge her to construct knowledge for herself, <br/>
emphasizing inquiry and experimentation, literature and the liberal arts, <br/>
symbolism, relationships and the complete range of thinking skills;<br/>
<br/>
       To avoid institutional devices such as rigid scheduling, age peer <br/>
confinement, basic skills instruction, and remediation;<br/>
<br/>
       To free her to embrace her own strengths and to focus on lifelong, <br/>
self-directed &quot;education for understanding&quot;;<br/>
<br/>
       To expand and enrich her educational opportunities in a variety of <br/>
special-interest areas, accessing expertise beyond the regular home-based program <br/>
to broaden her base of intellectual, emotional, artistic, social and physical <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
       (note - this was several years ago. The last bullet was meant for the <br/>
permanent record that we didn&#39;t want her to just stay home.)<br/>
