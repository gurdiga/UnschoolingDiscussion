<div id="ygrps-yiv-915318205">**Any input on the Moore Formula would be appreciated also, I identify with <br/>
some of their theories, but not sure how it would mesh with unschooling**<br/>
<br/>
I read the Moore&#39;s books a long time ago, so I&#39;m rusty on the details. But <br/>
I&#39;m remembering that the &quot;formula&quot; included work and service, is that right?<br/>
<br/>
I happen to agree that those are important for kids to experience. Kids (all <br/>
people) should have ample opportunity to do real things for real purposes. <br/>
They should have the opportunity to be needed and valued for their <br/>
contributions both within the family and without. Pubertal people ESPECIALLY <br/>
need to have real jobs to do that affect others besides themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Our huge challenge can be helping them to find the opportunities, and <br/>
sometimes helping to convince the adults that hold the keys to take a chance <br/>
on them.<br/>
