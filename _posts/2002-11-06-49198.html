<div id="ygrps-yiv-1588187403">T***hat is the sickest crap I have seen in a long time. Who told your wife this? <br/>
I just really hope no one else has visited this site. But if you have and <br/>
would like to know the truth of the matter, please let me know. It never <br/>
ceases to amaze me what pro-lifers will come up with to scare and bully on <br/>
their way to dominate.***<br/>
<br/>
Hi Nancy...<br/>
I did visit the site, actually, out of curiosity.<br/>
I&#39;m now wondering what you mean by &quot;the truth.&quot;  How exactly is partial birth abortion different from those labelled drawings?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, doctors don&#39;t stab the fetus in the back of the head/neck with <br/>
scissors. If the fetus is already dead, they induce labor and deliver the <br/>
baby. If the fetus isn&#39;t dead and the health of the mother is at risk or the <br/>
fetuses head is too large because of hydrocephalous they insert a catheter in <br/>
the spinal column to draw out fluid so the head will decrease in size making <br/>
it easier to extract the fetus. Either way, abortion isn&#39;t and can&#39;t be made <br/>
nice. I just think that scaring women with ugly pictures and statements that <br/>
are partial truths isn&#39;t the way to educate and give informative choices. <br/>
Although this site used drawings, there are many sites that use inflammatory <br/>
pictures to get their point across. <br/>
<br/>
Between Moly and Jack, I lost a baby. It was due on my birthday, and I had <br/>
this attachment to it that was more intense than the one I had with Moly <br/>
before she was born. At 22 weeks my doctor informed me the baby was not <br/>
alive. My choices were to either carry the baby until my body went into labor <br/>
(which normally a woman&#39;s body will do, but mine did not.) or to induce and <br/>
deliver. If I continued to carry the fetus, I ran the risk of severe <br/>
infection. Darin, my Mom, my doctor, and I talked and we decided that I <br/>
needed to deliver the baby. I was induced and prepared for an almost normal <br/>
delivery. Five hours into labor, a sonogram showed what hadn&#39;t been evident <br/>
before and my doctor explained that the fetuses head wouldn&#39;t pass through <br/>
and explained what he would have to do. I was devastated. But I got to hold <br/>
and love a baby for a while. If my doctor had stabbed the back of my baby&#39;s <br/>
head and sucked out the brains as this site describes the procedure, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have had that time. <br/>
<br/>
Last month, I lost twins. This time at 14 weeks. Again, I never went into a <br/>
natural labor. Since the fetuses were small enough, I didn&#39;t go through what <br/>
I went through the first time. I was induced, I delivered and then I had a <br/>
routine D&C. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655683433">Hugs Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
For all your losses.  And thank you also for explaining about the procedure and how, why it is preformed.  Unfortunately I do think it important that women like you tell your stories; otherwise women like you may not be around to tell their stories.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you,<br/>
be well,<br/>

many reasons.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I too have experienced this. I was told at 22 weeks that my baby was not<br/>
&quot;viable&quot;. I was given the option of letting my body take care getting<br/>
rid of the baby, or take matters into my own hands. With a husband who<br/>
traveled and a toddler at home, going into labour alone was not an<br/>
option. This would have been considered a &quot;partial birth abortion&quot;. But<br/>
it was not my choice! I wanted and loved this baby, I did not want to<br/>
giver her up. I am so offended and furious when people who do not know<br/>
my story make the assumption that all abortions are wrong or even<br/>
voluntary. I would have given just about anything to have kept this<br/>
baby. And following this loss I experienced another loss. Then finally I<br/>
had a wonderful baby boy.who is now 2. Nancy, I know how you feel, and<br/>
my heart goes out to you and anyone else who has to make this horrible<br/>
decision.<br/>

this one specifically, but the whole thread.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Is this what this list is all about? I am not here for a debate; I am<br/>
here to share Homeschooling feelings, beliefs, philosophies, and<br/>
