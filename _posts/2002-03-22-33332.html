<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829314310">Burial at sea is totally legal as long as certain rules and regulations are<br/>
followed.<br/>
I believe that JFK Jr. and his wife were within the 3 mile limit, I can&#39;t<br/>
remember if they were cremated remains or full-body. I think the request was<br/>
to be buried by a navy ship rather than private boat.<br/>
Later I can look it up if anyone is interested.<br/>
<br/>
   Federal Law:<br/>
The United States Environmental Protection Agency requires the burial of<br/>
cremated<br/>
remains at sea occur at least 3 nautical miles from land and that each<br/>
burial of<br/>
cremated remains be reported to:<br/>
In california the law is 500 yards from shore/<br/>
United States Environmental Protection Agency<br/>
<br/>
From a wbsite of a company performing BAS (burial at sea)<br/>
Burial at sea can be performed legally by anyone who can sail the seas and<br/>
comply with the regulations concerning ocean burials.  There are certain<br/>
environmental requirements that must be met to satisfy the law as well as<br/>
Coast Guard requirements concerning boating.<br/>
<br/>
For full body burial at sea:<br/>
Can an uncremated body legally be buried at sea in the United States?<br/>
<br/>
The simple answer to this is yes.  There are many restrictions and<br/>
requirements, however, the least of which concern maritime issues.  Many<br/>
county health departments will not release a body to a captain for sea<br/>
burial.  While this issue could probably be overcome, the cost and time<br/>
spent attempting to win a decision against a government agency could be<br/>
oppressive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Would a direct burial at sea be expensive?<br/>
<br/>
A full body buried at sea must be placed in waters of a specified depth,<br/>
mainly to insure that the body remains at the ocean&#39;s floor.  To reach the<br/>
required depth can require a long journey in an ocean-going vessel.<br/>
Depending on the time of year, weather and sea conditions, special vessels<br/>
or crew members may be required.  The costs of a 16-hour trip from New York<br/>
Harbor, as an example, could be quite costly.<br/>
<br/>
Any burial costs would be compounded by traditional funeral costs, if<br/>
desired, such as preparing the deceased for viewing and transporting the<br/>
remains to the vessel.<br/>
<br/>
Added to this are the costs associated with any legal actions necessary to<br/>
insure release of the body by county or state officials.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t I perform a full sea burial myself?<br/>
<br/>
If an individual was apprised of all applicable laws and regulations,<br/>
secured any necessary permits and had the proper craft to transport the<br/>
remains into the ocean, he could probably find a place where he could<br/>
legally perform a sea burial himself.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of the environment, for your safety and out of respect for the<br/>
law, do not perform a sea burial without being certain you comply with local<br/>
and national regulations.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are a number of laws, some pertaining to cremated remains, some to<br/>
full body. There were two different snips from different pages on the site.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350801200">Most states not only require a casket but a liner also.  Hubby use to work<br/>
for the Dumbya&#39;s buds in the Funeralgate conspiracy (SCI owns more<br/>
cemetaries, crematoriums, etc. in the world that anyone else) and they had<br/>
huge books of laws relating to burials, cremations, crematoriums, how deep<br/>
for the graves, double deeps, and the list goes on!<br/>
