<div><font size="2">A slightly hung-over mum and dad (after commiserating over the 
last ever episodes of DS9, aired last night over here) wake to being asked for 
milk and to make fox masks.&nbsp; Kids get up and head in their room for a 
little while, told to tidy up so there&#39;s room to do fox masks, mum gets up and 
showers, dad gets up and shaves, dad gets himself coffee, gets his stuff 
together and goes to work, mum gets breakfast.&nbsp; Tells kids to tidy floor in 
room so mum can vac up.&nbsp; Papers, pencils and stencils sorted and put on 
shelves.&nbsp; Kids go downstairs,&nbsp;told it would be a good idea to tidy 
their counters off the floor.&nbsp; Mum vacs upstairs, goes downstairs when 
finished to find the floor totally clear (videos, newspapers, magazines and 
clothes all piled on sofas)&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a total surprise, and I&#39;m 
grinning from ear to ear!!&nbsp; Not bad for a 4&amp;1/2 and a 
3&amp;1/4!!</font></div>
