<br/>
It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of<br/>
instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of<br/>
inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation,<br/>
stands mainly in need of freedom. ~ Albert Einstein ~<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
WATERCOLOR CHILDREN<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/194/japubnote.html<br/>
<br/>
In his introduction  [&quot;The Watercolorist&#39;s Essential Notebook&quot; author<br/>
Gordon] MacKenzie writes &quot;...Watercolors are not recommended for<br/>
those who are unwilling to relinquish the role of &#39;master.&#39;&quot; He<br/>
counsels that the would-be artist become, instead, &quot;a partner in the<br/>
process&quot; of creating a painting. Hmm. That seems true of<br/>
homeschooling. He goes on: &quot;In this medium you must be willing to<br/>
play the role of both patient director and alert stagehand, while the<br/>
pigment and water are free to perform their magic. Try to push this<br/>
medium around, and it quickly loses its charm, its transparent<br/>
radiance and its life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm again. How often have we advised parents to act as facilitators<br/>
rather than directors of their children&#39;s&#39; learning? I know I&#39;ve<br/>
often written that learning happens best when the learner is<br/>
encouraged rather than instructed. These were interesting parallels:<br/>
the comparisons between what MacKenzie was telling me about painting<br/>
and what we&#39;ve been telling parents about homeschooling for 20 years.<br/>
MacKenzie explains &quot;...Unlike a book of rules that tend to close our<br/>
minds, this is a collection of principles, concepts, and general<br/>
information designed to expand the creative process.&quot; He writes that<br/>
much of his material is based on &quot;common sense, visual perception,<br/>
and your own innate sense of design.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often written that homeschooling is based on common sense,<br/>
parental perception, and one&#39;s own innate sense of what one&#39;s<br/>
children need. MacKenzie goes on: &quot;We all embrace an individual sense<br/>
of what &#39;feels right&#39; that also seems to reflect an unconscious<br/>
universal consensus.&quot; This made sense to me when I thought about how<br/>
new homeschooling parents almost instinctively know how to teach<br/>
their kids to read, or how little advanced mathematics is really<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
MacKenzie advises, &quot;The hardest part about this is believing in your<br/>
ability to do it. The second hardest part is shutting off that little<br/>
left-brain voice that says &#39;This is stupid. It won&#39;t work.&#39; It takes<br/>
courage to step into the unknown and trust what you find...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many times have I written those very words to parents worried<br/>
about whether or not their children will ever learn to read? It takes<br/>
courage to step into the unknown. And yet just as MacKenzie advises<br/>
me to let go and trust the process of water and paint and paper, so<br/>
I&#39;ve often advised parents to let go and trust the process of<br/>
children and exploring and learning. If letting go of a little paint<br/>
and water takes courage, how much more courage must be involved when<br/>
one knows the letting go will affect their child&#39;s future?<br/>

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br/>
<br/>
Questions for the November/December issue of Home Education<br/>
Magazine&#39;s Questions and Answers column:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My husband and I would like to homeschool our three children, the<br/>
oldest of whom is now five and eligible to start kindergarten in the<br/>
fall. She desperately wants to go to &#39;real school&#39; (her words not<br/>
ours) like her friends and like she sees children do in books,<br/>
magazines, TV etc. For the first time, a magazine she receives<br/>
(Click!) has a homeschool family attending a picnic, but otherwise<br/>
everything she reads is about children in school. Any ideas on how we<br/>
can make this feel more like a special opportunity and less like we<br/>
are preventing her from doing what she wants to do?&quot; ~~ Inge O&#39;Connor<br/>
~~<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have always been the one to take the pictures, write down the<br/>
titles of books, search the net for resources, etc.  Is there a more<br/>
efficient way?  Now that my children are preteens, I&#39;d like to know<br/>
how others get their kids to keep track of their learning.&quot;<br/>

UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh my!! I just had a flashback! Before our unschooling days, my<br/>
5-yr-old DS and I were in the lunchbox aisle in Wal-Mart and he was<br/>
picking out his lunchbox for school. As he was standing there holding<br/>
it, it suddenly dawned on me (with much force) that he and I would no<br/>
longer be eating lunch together. I broke down and cried, right on the<br/>
spot. Later that evening when his dad got home, he said, &#39;Mama cried<br/>
in Wal-Mart today.&#39; My husband looked duly concerned and asked me,<br/>
&#39;Why? What happened?&#39; And my sweet little son replied, &#39;Because I get<br/>
to go to school and she doesn&#39;t.&#39; Of course he was thinking that he<br/>
was going to a wonderful place. He had a very different opinion after<br/>
the very first day, and told me &#39;Mom, I think you were crying in<br/>
Wal-Mart that day for a different reason.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
He is now well into his teens and we did go shopping this week for<br/>
some new goodies. But it was SO NICE to just all go home together<br/>
again and BE together and use our new stuff! You should see my house.<br/>
Stuff strewn all over the place. You can&#39;t find the carpet. Or the<br/>
walls, either. Art &#39;masterpieces&#39; stuck all over the place.&quot; ~~ Ginny<br/>

NOT GOING BACK TO SCHOOL-YAY!<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t you glad your kids aren&#39;t going back to school this month? I<br/>
see those ads for back-to-school clothes and supplies, the ones where<br/>
the parents can&#39;t wait for the kids to go back and the kids aren&#39;t<br/>
really so happy about it, and I feel sad. When those busses start<br/>
running, I&#39;m always thankful my kids aren&#39;t on them, looking like the<br/>
kids who gaze out the windows with unhappy, glazed-over faces because<br/>
they don&#39;t want to be taken away on the big banana.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I know some kids like school. But for all of those kids who<br/>
just want to escape and can&#39;t see any way out, I sure wish their<br/>
parents would take advantage of what I think is the best educational<br/>
choice a family can make--living and learning together as a family.<br/>
<br/>
This month, celebrate back-to-school-NOT.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
We think parents and kids should be together! So with this issue we<br/>
are running a special to encourage you to do just that - be with your<br/>
kids. Our &quot;Don&#39;t Send Your Kids to School!&quot; special is available to<br/>

MATH IS POWER<br/>
http://www.mathispower.org<br/>
<br/>
I found myself caught up in this website playing arcade games when I<br/>
should have been working on this newsletter. In addition to arcade<br/>
games, you&#39;ll find a section on math challenges for families to<br/>
figure out together, a message board where you can ask math<br/>
questions, a math search engine and more. Try some of the math<br/>
challenges as you&#39;re eating dinner together some night. This website<br/>
is supported by the National Science Foundation, just a click away<br/>

NHEN LAUNCHES MEMBERSHIP DRIVE!<br/>
www.NHEN.org<br/>
<br/>
Since its founding in 1999, NHEN, an all-volunteer organization<br/>
connecting homeschoolers nationwide, has evolved into a respected<br/>
source of information for the homeschooling community as well as the<br/>
general public. Our award-winning website contains a wealth of<br/>
first-hand information about homeschooling, written from a variety of<br/>
viewpoints. In keeping with our mission statement, NHEN espouses no<br/>
one particular political agenda or homeschooling philosophy.<br/>
Instead, we know that homeschooling parents can read all of the<br/>
material and determine for themselves what is best for their family.<br/>
<br/>
In response to media requests, we help reporters find accurate,<br/>
balanced information about homeschooling and put them in touch with<br/>
NHEN members who have previously indicated a willingness to be<br/>
interviewed. Information and interviews provided by NHEN contacts<br/>
have appeared in articles in Time, on National Public Radio, and<br/>
other national, state, and local media.<br/>
<br/>
All homeschoolers are invited to participate in our network. NHEN<br/>
membership is free. By joining NHEN you will add your voice to those<br/>
of thousands of other homeschoolers who have approved our mission<br/>
statement. NHEN operates only through volunteer contributions. Once<br/>
you&#39;ve joined, be sure to read the NHENotes and find out how you<br/>
could help!  NHEN T-shirts, fanny packs, and tote bags are also<br/>
available for sale. And, as a 501C3 nonprofit organization, NHEN is<br/>
happy to receive a donation of any size.<br/>
<br/>
Join us and help change the way the world sees homeschooling!<br/>

FLYLADY<br/>
http://www.flylady.net<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll either love her or hate her. No, the FlyLady doesn&#39;t really<br/>
have anything to do with homeschooling or flying for that matter, but<br/>
a lot of homeschoolers swear by her program for keeping their houses<br/>
manageable. Let&#39;s face it. We live in our houses. Very few<br/>
homeschoolers go out to a job for 8-10 hours every day and come home<br/>
to a clean house. We live in our homes all day, every day, except<br/>
when we&#39;re running out the door leaving the peanut butter, jelly and<br/>
bread open on the counter for the dog to drag down and eat.<br/>
<br/>
FlyLady can help you tame the dirty clutter monster. She sends a<br/>
daily motivational email, the backbone of the program, and offers a<br/>
detailed plan on her website for getting control and keeping control<br/>
in an hour a day or less. Starting out as a &quot;FlyBaby,&quot; you are<br/>
instructed to &quot;get dressed to your shoes&quot; every morning, take a 15<br/>
minute break every hour, laugh every day, clean one zone (out of 5<br/>
rotating zones) every week, hit the Hot Spots, 5-minute room rescues<br/>
and perform the entertaining 27 Fling Boogie. (I can vouch for the<br/>
dressing to your shoes part. It&#39;s really easy as homeschoolers to<br/>
stay in our PJs and never really feel ready to start on those<br/>
drudgery chores. Dressing to your shoes makes a bigger difference<br/>
than you would think.)<br/>
<br/>
Not everybody takes to the FlyLady. Some of us have our own routines<br/>
and we&#39;re happy with how our houses look. But I know a number of<br/>
homeschoolers who feel she&#39;s saved their lives by giving them some<br/>
structure and a reason to get started in the morning. Me, I wish<br/>
she&#39;d just come and clean my house for me! Ready for a challenge,<br/>
FlyLady?<br/>
