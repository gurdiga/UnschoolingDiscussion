<div id="ygrps-yiv-95180453">-=-I&#39;m curious.  Is there a movement in Germany to try to make homeschooling legal?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of the group members here will know more. <br/>
Is there a general European discusson of home education somewhere, anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
I’ve heard about law changes in The Netherlands, and that Clonlara.org is in Europe, useable legitimately in some countries, and not in others.<br/>
<br/>
Where can people ask, to find more about German laws?<br/>
<br/>
I did let the question through, even though the topic of laws has from the very beginning been NOT my topic.  What I want to collect and share about it how learning can work, and that doesn’t have to do with laws.  My own volunteer time and energy (including keeping this group) isn’t about laws, but it about helping people who want to unschool and who CAN do it, to do it as well as they can.<br/>
<br/>
And resources change, so a page I had many years ago that was useful and valuable isn’t so much anymore, as many discussions have gone to Facebook. <br/>
My old resource page:<br/>

<br/>
Oh! The German section isn’t so old. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That little animated sun up top of that page was the fanciest “clip art” expage.com had in the late 1990s when that page was first created. :-)<br/>
The flags all came later.<br/>
