<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785721423">I have been talking with the children one on one when there is an &quot;issue&quot;.  I find that by doing this there is no need for a punishment.  My dh thinks that there must be a punishment in order for the children to learn the lesson.  I feel like putting a cute picture on the wall that also says, Parents who punish their kids, do not know How to solve the problem.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not even know what to punish the kids with.  I can&#39;t ground them because that is keeping them and rest of the family from society (learning opportunities), I can&#39;t ground them from tv (learning opportunities) , I can&#39;t ground them from the computer, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I am open to all suggestions, and please tell me what I NEED to hear not what you think I WANT  to hear.  <br/>

<br/>
Well you could jokingly tell your husband that their punishment is having to <br/>
hear you talk about it for half an hour. <br/>
<br/>
But seriously, ask him whether punishments changed his life in good ways, or <br/>
whether he does what he does now because he knows it&#39;s just better to do the <br/>
right thing.<br/>
<br/>
When kids are &quot;punishment trained&quot; it makes them sneaky and gives them real <br/>
reasons to lie.   When they&#39;re punishment trained it often means &quot;This is <br/>
wrong if you get caught,&quot; rather than &quot;this is wrong because it&#39;s harmful to <br/>
others or to property or makes me a lesser person than I would be if I had <br/>
made a better decision.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One only lasts when parents are around, but the other is for life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405208462">I&#39;ve been watching a video tape while I exercise called &#39;How to Behave<br/>
So Your Kids Will Too&#39;. The part I watched today talked about<br/>
punishment. He said that punishment doesn&#39;t actually reform children. He<br/>
didn&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t appropriate at times, but he said no child starts<br/>
excelling or really behaving well because they&#39;re really &#39;punished<br/>
well&#39;.<br/>

Sounds good to me!<br/>
<br/>
I explained to Amanda (we were alone) that she and I like to be part of a group.We are the type &quot;the more the merrier&quot;.  I explained that Heather is different than us in that aspect. <br/>
<br/>
I also had this talk alone with Heather.  Long story short- Amanda and Heather have been playing YuGiOh  cards or whatever it is called together nicely. Amanda has found other things to do while Heather is spending her time alone. They also gave each other a hug before going to bed; this has never happened between the two of them before. <br/>
<br/>
Relationships are improving .  Maybe there will be a domino effect here and hubby will jump on board.  <br/>

My dh says he does not believe in the concept of win/win. This makes <br/>
negotiating very difficult. You may want to talk to your dh about what <br/>
his goals are regarding the kids (i.e. having them *want* to live <br/>
nearby, having a lot of money, just being *gone* by 18, etc.). You may <br/>
find his ideal interaction is very different than yours.<br/>

<br/>
What you all are saying is the only thing I have found to work.  I will not let dh get in the way of my relationship with the children.  I am too emotional to make any decisions.  But if he isn&#39;t willing to put any effort into this I won&#39;t be able to stay here.  I may need some advice as how to continue unschooling with 4 children and the oldest is 9.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was having a discussion about this with my husband and he says that we<br/>
are a bunch of illogical, bleeding heart women.  My dad used to say the same<br/>
thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What you all are saying is the only thing I have found to work.  I will<br/>
not let dh get in the way of my relationship with the children.  I am too<br/>
emotional to make any decisions.  But if he isn&#39;t willing to put any effort<br/>
into this I won&#39;t be able to stay here.  I may need some advice as how to<br/>
continue unschooling with 4 children and the oldest is 9.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also found that punishment breeds a negative, angry, hostile<br/>
&gt; environment. The kids don&#39;t trust each other OR the parents. Discussing<br/>
&gt; the issues allows each to understand the other&#39;s point of view and<br/>
&gt; respect that. The understanding may not always work, but a respectful<br/>
&gt; environment is more pleasant for everyone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve also had the issue where the kids and I can discuss and cooperate<br/>
&gt; but then DAD comes in and wants *obedience* and *punishment*. My issue<br/>
&gt; there is that I don&#39;t know what Dad&#39;s goals are. I did ask him, though,<br/>
&gt; who should spank HIM when he did something he knew was wrong.<br/>

how you think and why.  And how you feel when he says things like bleeding <br/>
heart women.  What you want for your children right now and how they are <br/>
learning to make choices in a safe environment with safe people and how that <br/>
will help their decision making abilities later in life when it isn&#39;t so safe <br/>
and people aren&#39;t so safe.<br/>
Talking helps when it isn&#39;t the heat of the moment.  I don&#39;t know your <br/>
particular situation but it is easier when the two people are calm and can <br/>
talk together and think about things.<br/>

<br/>
This was the situation:<br/>
<br/>
Dh said that he is not getting enough sleep.  He wants kids in their rooms at 7:00pm for quiet time and light out and kids asleep at 8:00.  Because I am the mom I am responsible for MAKING the kids fall asleep at 8:00.  I told him that is too much for me; I cannot make anybody do anything, but what we could do is have the children go their rooms at 8:00 and tvs have to stay below a volume level where no one outside of the room will hear it.  He said he didn&#39;t want tvs on all night.  I told him I was willing to stay up until all the children were asleep and then turn tvs and lights off.  Then he said that come to bed after that he would wake up.  I told him I was willing to sleep on the sofa.  He said ok to all this.  I went to each child seperately and explained that Mike needed more sleep and the solution that we came up with.  The children were all in agreement.  I also told Dh that we would try for a week and make changes when needed (to let him know that I am flexible here).  Everyone was in agreement until Mike went to bed.  For no reason whatsoever, he caused chaos with the whole situation.  I will stop here cause I am at a pt of calling him names.<br/>

Yes, when we are done playing with them we just put them back in their<br/>
cages...  I hope the phone call helps.<br/>
<br/>
My dh sometimes says things like the above about bedtime or other parenting<br/>
situations.  It is usually based on the way he was raised, and usually when<br/>
we talk about it he realizes that it isn&#39;t a realistic parenting strategy.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtime often becomes the mother&#39;s problem, especially if she is sahm and<br/>
the father isn&#39;t.  He *needs* his sleep because he has to go out and support<br/>
the family.  Never mind that she needs her sleep if she is going to be a<br/>
decent parent all day long with no breaks!<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to involve dh in bedtime since the kids were young.  Even when<br/>
they still nursed to sleep, he would help them get ready for bed (pjs,<br/>
teeth, etc.) and lay down with them and read stories while I had a few<br/>
minutes to myself in the evening.  We still do this most nights.  Snuggling<br/>
with daddy is one of their favorite parts of the day.<br/>

Dan(BIL) says this is not a sleep issue.  The real issue is Mike was taught that fathers work and come home to peace and quiet.  Kids are to be out of sight and mind.  It is as tho it is another job.  <br/>

the kids, because that is what moms do, in his mind.  Our 7 yod loves<br/>
baseball too.  Sunday, dh spent the afternoon playing with her and a couple<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453400582">It&#39;s funny (and sometimes not) how two partners come to a relationship<br/>
with expectations based on what their parents did.  In my family, my<br/>
father always went out in the cold to warm up the car and clear off the<br/>
snow.  I still think of it as dh&#39;s job.  In his family, his mom did that<br/>
and he thinks of it as my job.  We both do it depending on who is busy<br/>
at the time, but we always joke that it is the woman&#39;s job or the man&#39;s<br/>
job.  We do things fairly traditionally here as far as splitting up<br/>
household chores, but that is because we each prefer those jobs not<br/>
because we have to do those jobs based on our gender. I&#39;d rather do the<br/>
laundry any day over getting wood or mowing our lawn ( we mow between 2<br/>
and 3 acres depending on how much time dh is home).  <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520586956">My dh is not very happy with the idea that the kids are up all night watching tv or playing on the pc.  Fortunately though, I was always able to intercept his &quot;moods&quot; and tell him not to make it a &#39;moral&#39; issue.<br/>
<br/>
Our solution was to make sure dh is on one floor and the kids were on another.  In other words, when our bedroom was on the main floor, we had the kids watch tv downstairs in the basement and the computer (which is right next to our bedroom door) had to have the speakers off.  <br/>
<br/>
NOW, and I&#39;m so thankful for this....we JUST slept in our BRAND SPANKIN new bedroom last night for the first time. l We renovated the garage to make a fourth bedroom.  it is in the daylight basement and is VERY quiet.  We have the entire downstairs area to ourselves and the kids can be on the main floor and not bother anyone. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568688227">This isn&#39;t about how I think any individual mother feels, it&#39;s an inspired <br/>
riff on the idea that moms need sleep too, in cases when dads are baffled AND <br/>
tired.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Bedtime often becomes the mother&#39;s problem, especially if she is sahm and<br/>
the father isn&#39;t.  He *needs* his sleep because he has to go out and support<br/>
the family.  Never mind that she needs her sleep if she is going to be a<br/>
decent parent all day long with no breaks! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It IS the mother&#39;s &quot;problem&quot; if she wants to make exceptions to hundreds of <br/>
years of tradition.  The fact that that tradition was based on the cost of <br/>
lighting with candles or oil lamps at night doesn&#39;t matter.  The tradition <br/>
stands.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to buck tradition and culture, it is going to be a chore!  <br/>
And those who don&#39;t want to do it can fall back on what their relatives and <br/>
neighbors and half the child-raising advice published will say is good and <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
The mom can put those kids in dark rooms at a pre-determined bedtime and <br/>
threaten them if they don&#39;t get quiet and stay there, and she can go to bed <br/>
when her husband goes to bed.<br/>

OR she can have some modern new-fangled electricity-based idea and SHE (not <br/>
her husband who has to go to work in the morning) can figure out how to make <br/>
it work.<br/>
<br/>
You either figure out how to make it work or you abandon the project.  That&#39;s <br/>
the way engineering works.  And what we&#39;re doing is social engineering.  If a <br/>
bridge isn&#39;t working, building it the same way again isn&#39;t going to help.  <br/>
You need to prepare the ground, KNOW what&#39;s underneath, deal with making the <br/>
owners happy, and the neighbors happy, and have good materials, a good plan, <br/>
consider environmental impact and structural longevity.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is like bridge building in sf of it&quot; is no way to build ANY <br/>
bridges.</div>

&lt;&lt; For instance, dh loves to play baseball.  When he was a kid, it was his mom<br/>
who played catch with him and was at all his games.  So even though HE is<br/>
the one who loves baseball, he expects me to be the one to do baseball with<br/>
the kids, because that is what moms do, in his mind. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My husband used to be that way about swimming, and I don&#39;t even SWIM!  <br/>
He said I needed to LEARN to swim so I could help the kids learn.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to learn.  Keith&#39;s tried to teach me. It&#39;s not happening in this <br/>
lifetime. <br/>
<br/>
I got another homeschooling mom to go with me to take our kids to swimming <br/>
lessons, but I continued to patiently tell Keith he likes to swim, and it&#39;s <br/>
something he could do with the kids.  Finally he got it and he DID have fun.  <br/>
For a long time, he and Holly went swimming every Friday afternoon.  She <br/>
plays Harry Potter now, but they will probably resume when and if this <br/>
tournament series ends.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s funny (and sometimes not) how two partners come to a relationship<br/>
&gt; with expectations based on what their parents did.  In my family, my<br/>
&gt; father always went out in the cold to warm up the car and clear off the<br/>
&gt; snow.  I still think of it as dh&#39;s job.  In his family, his mom did that<br/>
&gt; and he thinks of it as my job. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of one of those &quot;lightbulb&quot; moments we had as a family years ago.  <br/>
I asked my oldest daughter if she&#39;d like to see how the washer and dryer <br/>
works.  She was older, wearing three or four changes of clothes a day and <br/>
often was frustrated waiting on the laundry she wanted to wear to be done.<br/>
<br/>
In our household most often my DH does the laundry, he prefers ANYTHING that <br/>
doesn&#39;t require constant interaction with the children.  Specific things like <br/>
reading stories or watching ball games are fine, just that time that he can&#39;t <br/>
himself figure out what to do with them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she looks at me smugly and says, &quot;Mom I am never going to HAVE to do <br/>
laundry, it&#39;s MAN&quot;S work&quot;.  My husbands head snapped around and we realized <br/>
at that moment we had definitely succeeded in breaking the mold our families <br/>
both had about &quot;women&#39;s work&quot; and &quot;man&#39;s work&quot;, ultimately just renaming <br/>
tasks.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest girl is grown and living on her own and comes home to do laundry <br/>
and she still tries to talk her brothers into doing it for her before she <br/>
would ask her sister.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest boy lives on his own and in his house he does the laundry, I guess <br/>
because his dad always did it.  He has no children, just him and his <br/>
girlfriend, so I guess the things we see our parents do can be broken but we <br/>
should carefully guard ourselves that our children don&#39;t take up where we <br/>
left off.<br/>
