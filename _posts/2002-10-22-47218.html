The function of show dogs is to &quot;show&quot;. They really aren&#39;t used for work. <br/>
It&#39;s impressive to see a dog (or even better, a BREED!) which is still <br/>
following it&#39;s function in form. But to be realistic, the function is gone.<br/>

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I prefer a working dog to be able to work too, but that&#39;s <br/>
not the function anymore! Showy companion, yes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-580847449">Showing my dog ignorance here.  <br/>
The only thing I really know about dogs is they steal your pillow and<br/>
push you out of bed if they can.  <br/>
<br/>
I have always liked Spaniels.  Is it rude to just say Spaniels without<br/>
saying Springer, Cocker, etc?<br/>
I like that size range and personality.   Although my sister had a<br/>
Brittany Spaniel, he was a little bigger.<br/>
His name was Rodney and if you said ---would you rather be neutered or a<br/>
dead dog--- he would fall over with his tongue hanging out.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a Basenji.  These dogs were not a good idea.  I have a Shi tzu. <br/>
Ditto. <br/>
I end up with any dog or cat that other people, the people in their right<br/>
minds, don&#39;t want.  And they all live to be 45 and they all have some<br/>
kind of mental problem.<br/>
<br/>
My husband wants a Golden Retriever, he has the name picked out already. <br/>
My son wants a Basset Hound, he writes poetry about them.   My city says<br/>
two dogs and that&#39;s it, so for now I don&#39;t have to worry about it.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;re all spaniels. Like &quot;retrievers&quot; covers labs, golden, chessies, <br/>
curlies, etc. It&#39;s just less specific.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I like that size range and personality.   Although my sister had a<br/>

years ago because they are classified as pointers.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now, see. I was looking at Basenjis a few years ago. I&#39;m STILL interested! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
  They&#39;re a GREAT idea if you&#39;re hunting in the African savannah! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Shih Tzus were bred to sit in your lap and draw fleas! How&#39;s yours living up <br/>
to her purpose?<br/>
<br/>
The main problem with the way people pick out a breed is that they don&#39;t <br/>
consider what the dog was bred for (that ol&#39; &quot;form follows function&quot; again! <br/>
and not just for looks, but behavior). CERTAINLY don&#39;t get a dachshund or a <br/>
terrier if you mind holes in your back yard (and often have high pain <br/>
tolerances). Labs and goldens will worry you to death to throw things for <br/>
them. Bassets often stink (thick, oily coat with those ears dragging the <br/>
ground) and have their noses stuck to the ground. Bulldogs feel little pain. <br/>
Basenjis just aren&#39;t excessively &quot;friendly&quot;, but ARE incredibly curious. <br/>
Border collies MUST work, or they&#39;ll FIND work.<br/>

border collie cross.  The brits still seem to be called spaniels here in<br/>
Canada.<br/>

<br/>
She really is the most loving and affectionate dog.  She is just<br/>
different.  She climbs like a monkey.  She likes to sleep on the fridge,<br/>
or in the sink.   And there&#39;s that noise.<br/>
But, she&#39;s a wonderful hiking partner and will stop at nothing.  She<br/>
hiked across the basalt flows with me at Newberry Crater and that wasn&#39;t<br/>
easy for someone without shoes.  She&#39;d go into a cave or up or down a<br/>
cliff to follow me.  <br/>
She has this incredible expressive face.  <br/>
My husband hates her passionately, but he still shares his pizza crust<br/>
with her.  She won&#39;t let anyone in the house or yard unless we say it&#39;s<br/>
ok.  <br/>
She&#39;s little, but she has a big heart. <br/>
She&#39;s never been hunting but she gets wildly excited about mountain lion<br/>
tracks and bear scat!<br/>
<br/>
***Shih Tzus were bred to sit in your lap and draw fleas! How&#39;s yours<br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s a very happy little guy.  That tail never stops.  His name is Pie<br/>
and my son actually made a comic strip out of him.  The cartoon Pie has a<br/>
rotor like tail and can fly.   He is Sky Pie.&lt;g&gt;  My mother comes over to<br/>
sit and rock him in the rocking chair.  He might be a little spoiled.  We<br/>
are fortunate enough to not have a flea problem here in Western Montana. <br/>
 He stomps spiders unless we rescue them.  He likes dill pickles.  He<br/>
digs my tulip bulbs out of the ground and carries them around.  I had the<br/>
hardest time planting onion sets this year because he would come along<br/>
behind and dig them out.  I got a lot of exercise chasing him down. <br/>
Aerobic gardening.  He does a weird little dance when the Basenji sings. <br/>
They&#39;re a perfect pair.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In my youth, (ok I was 27) I,  shall we say &quot;liberated&quot;  the Basenji from<br/>
an unhappy situation. The Shi tzu was a three day dog sitting job.  That<br/>
was three years ago and I never heard from the man again.  His sister did<br/>
offer to take the little dog but after hearing how their last dog met his<br/>
demise I decided we liked him well enough to keep him here.  Someday I<br/>
may actually select a dog on purpose instead of just acquiring what ever<br/>
comes along.   That will be after the Retriever and the Basset Hound I<br/>
guess. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
