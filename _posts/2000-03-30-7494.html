<div id="ygrps-yiv-531201145">I wanted to share this....<br/>
I&#39;m sitting here at the computer going through email, and then I was<br/>
reading the post from Sandra Dodd on Unshcooling.com about reading.<br/>
As I&#39;m doing this my boys come to me with paper they have been doing<br/>
next to me at the dining room table.  They want to know what they wrote<br/>
(they are 7 and 5)  I have been bothered by the not reading thing, and<br/>
the no interest.  I also have a bad habit of comparing ect...  So here<br/>
they come with these papers, and proceed to tell me all the letters they<br/>
wrote.  I didn&#39;t even know they knew a fraction of these letters.  I&#39;m<br/>
thrilled!!  I wish you could see their faces.  So proud they are.<br/>
