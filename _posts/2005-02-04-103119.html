&lt;&lt; What I found interesting about the Mailer article was that it wasn&#39;t <br/>
anti-TV, <br/>
just anti commercials. <br/>
<br/>
=Heck, I&#39;m with Norm on that one! :)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Commercials were put there by God so that people would get up and <br/>
go to the bathroom<br/>
get a drink<br/>
feed the cats<br/>
switch out the laundry<br/>
check the mail<br/>
check on the kids who are doing something else<br/>
get more firewood<br/>
pet the dog<br/>
scoop the litter box<br/>
turn off some lights<br/>
stir the stew<br/>
<br/>
Without commercials, people could go an hour or two without exercise, without <br/>
home maintenance, without attending to their pets.<br/>
<br/>
Those who sit through the commercials attentively are just lazy.<br/>
<br/>
God told me to say that.<br/>

Yeah, I know.  They don&#39;t bother me.  They don&#39;t make me want to buy a Ford <br/>

We might record the &quot;best commercials&quot; special that&#39;s showing tonight, <br/>
because we were talking just yesterday about the best part of the superbowl being <br/>
the commercials, but we&#39;re going to a folksinging party and won&#39;t be here.<br/>

Oh - I&#39;ll have to look for that - since I often miss commercials <br/>
during the superbowl while chatting with folks and refilling my <br/>
snack plate and whatnot at the superbowl party we go to (annual <br/>
event). Thanks for the heads up</div>

Especially this year, I could not care less about either team. :) <br/>
I&#39;ll check on things at half time and in commercial breaks from <br/>
whatever I&#39;m watching on another channel.<br/>
 I can&#39;t help it, I was a public relations and advertising major in <br/>
college. I love a good ad, and there aren&#39;t that many around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145497795">And me... I tried quiznos because someone recommended them.  They were <br/>
good.  I eat them because I like them.  The commercials don&#39;t enter the <br/>
picture.  I watch so little live tv, I record what I wish to watch and <br/>
cc through it.  During live tv I do other things during the <br/>
commercials.  I see my kids doing the same thing. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess that just shows the difference in advertising and what people like.<br/>
We loved the little Quizno spongemonkey commercial. My oldest still walks<br/>
around singing in a squeaky little voice &quot;Quizno subs!!!!!!&quot; And she&#39;s<br/>
nearly 19!<br/>
<br/>
And we also like the new little baby one. I can go without the model but the<br/>
baby is just too cute talking!<br/>

I tried Quizno&#39;s because Holly really liked it, and she&#39;s a picky eater.  I <br/>
figured if Holly likes it, there must be something good about it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think this concept of babies with adult voices is something that kids find<br/>
funny - that topsy-turvy schism between grown and not. My personal pick for<br/>
the strangest one of these babies (also see &quot;Look Who&#39;s Talking&quot; and<br/>
sequels, and &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;) is the Red Nose Baby on &quot;The Proud Family&quot;<br/>
which combines a baby/urbane man with the &quot;Dancing Frog&quot; concept (Warner<br/>
Bros classic cartoon) - poor Oscar Proud (the dad in the sitcom) is the only<br/>
one to whom the baby reveals his true nature, with disastrous results for<br/>
Oscar every time.<br/>
<br/>
I get weirded out by the living and intelligent food characters that are<br/>
either terrified - the Weiner with running shoes is no fool - or inviting us<br/>
to eat them - the CA Raisins were one of the first I think, but there are<br/>
others. The latter are less funny and more creepy in commercials in my<br/>
opinion. Makes me think of Douglas Adams (&quot;The Hitch Hiker&#39;s Guide to the<br/>
Galaxy&quot;). Remember the pig?<br/>
