and a digital camera ( its broken right now!!.. gosh, that could be another <br/>
whole thread.. it got broken when Landon took it to school with him!!)   The <br/>
digital camera ( when its working) is so wonderful cuz the kids can take all <br/>
the pix they want , see them right away, and delete the ones they dont like.  <br/>
Landon has taken some REALLY good pictures.  <br/>
