<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920046585">certainly not picking on anyone or trying to direct this at one person<br/>
(don&#39;t even remember who said it)...<br/>
<br/>
but from personal experience - it really irks me when people tell me i<br/>
should do things.  i have had way too much of that in my life.  of course,<br/>
out of habit, i still occasionally say should to someone else or myself,<br/>
when i really mean could or (when talking to someone else) that i would do<br/>
things a certain way.  i&#39;m working on changing how i say it so it comes off<br/>
as more a suggestion or my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
i probably wouldn&#39;t even mention it, but i just had it out with my mom over<br/>
her telling me how i should be raising my kids.  ugh.<br/>

&gt; LOL  I actually wrote &quot;should&quot; first, but then wrote &quot;could&quot; instead.<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t want to give anyone a &quot;have to&quot; in my post.  ;&#39;)  But, yeah,<br/>
&gt; if it sounds fun . . . do it for YOU!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Think of the list like a request to Google. You type in your problem and you<br/>
get a bunch of replies. Not all of the replies will be useful to you. But<br/>
they might be useful to someone else who has the same problem. To tailor the<br/>
list specifically to you would make it less useful to someone else. So you<br/>
skip the sites that aren&#39;t useful to and concentrate on the ones that are.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, though the suggestions someone receives to a posted problem<br/>
are tailored to the specifics in a post it&#39;s best to see that the replies<br/>
are general in nature and aimed at helping anyone in a similar situation.<br/>
<br/>
The way to get the most from the list is to assume everyone is giving the<br/>
best they can. And to read as though something is said by the nicest person<br/>
we know in the most helpful voice.<br/>
<br/>
So skip the ones that aren&#39;t reaching you. Or find a way to read past the<br/>
shoulds.<br/>
<br/>
Take what you can use. Leave the rest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry about your relationship with your mom. But if you yell at your child<br/>
because you had a problem with your mom, it might be understood by others<br/>
why that happened but there are much better choices. Expending frustration<br/>
on a child spreads frustration and whittles away at the relationship. Same<br/>
with expending it towards 1600 people.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about the better choices we can make.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  i&#39;m working on changing how i say it so it comes off<br/>
<br/>
as more a suggestion or my opinion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How can it be more than a suggestion or an opinion in a forum like this?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m standing next to someone who&#39;s about to burn butter or meat and I say <br/>
&quot;Take the pan off the burner!&quot; that might be more than a suggestion or an <br/>
opinion, but if your pan is thousands of miles from me, and I can&#39;t smell your <br/>
butter burning, but you say &quot;It seems the butter&#39;s burning&quot; and I say &quot;Take the <br/>
pan off the burner,&quot; what I mean is this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it seems to you that the butter is burning, you could just turn the heat <br/>
down, but the burner will still be hot.  So IF you don&#39;t want the butter to <br/>
burn, pick the pan up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has come to anyone else&#39;s house and knocked on the door and told them <br/>
what to do.  Every single person who is on this list came here by choice and <br/>
free will, and then either posted or didn&#39;t, and read or didn&#39;t.<br/>
