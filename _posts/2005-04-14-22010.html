<div id="ygrps-yiv-239300580">Mandy had an ultrasound today.  The doctor said she has 80 mg of  amniotic <br/>
fluid now, which means it&#39;s on the low side of normal.  Normal is  50-250 mg.  <br/>
To put that in perspective, when she entered the hospital after  the water <br/>
broke, she had 4 CM of fluid.  80 mg translates to 7 CM of fluid  (I didn&#39;t figure <br/>
that, Jake did).  <br/>
 <br/>
The baby looks great, still moving around.  He weighs about 1 lb 6 oz,  which <br/>
is 3 oz more than last week.  His limbs look like they have not been  <br/>
affected by the lack of fluid, and the heartbeat is still strong.  He will  likely be <br/>
born around 28 weeks, which is 3 weeks from Friday.  He is in  breech <br/>
position, but that&#39;s to be expected.  <br/>
 <br/>
Jake will not come home from Iraq until July, unless there is some  <br/>
life-threatening emergency.<br/>
 <br/>
Just wanted to let everyone know the good news!<br/>

<br/>
Can you send me your snail mail address? I have something for her. <br/>
Thanks! And I still have my fingers crossed that all turns out well! <br/>
Hugs to you, Will, and Mandy!<br/>

the doctors thinking 3 weeks? I&#39;m assuming they&#39;re concerned about <br/>
infection, is that as far as they think it safe to push it? I would <br/>
think keeping the baby in longer rather than out would be better as long <br/>
as the fluid levels are staying up and he&#39;s gaining?<br/>

 <br/>
Apparently there&#39;s a point of diminishing returns, where the risks of  <br/>
keeping him in there as he grows with barely adequate fluid are more than the  risk <br/>
of being born premature.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m guessing.  <br/>
 <br/>
The infection risk is virtually gone, I think, with the leak apparently  <br/>
closed up.  They&#39;re giving her little test strips to see if she&#39;s getting  any <br/>
slight amniotic fluid leaks...but I haven&#39;t heard any results<br/>
 <br/>
Thansk for the good wishes, everyone.<br/>
