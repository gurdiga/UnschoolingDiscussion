<div id="ygrps-yiv-575531199">I love telling Canadians that there are few/no bank service charges in the US and anyone can start a bank, if they want to.  Here, we pay $10-$25 per month for the banks to hold our money.  The gov&#39;t is sooo afraid that they will have to pay for a bank failure they have allowed the 6 Can. banks to make BILLIONS each year this way.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, in April each year, you find out there are no tax deductions here.  Well, OK, one.  But that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, gay weddings allowed, but 50% of the country is actually upset enough to get up out of easy chairs and tell the gov&#39;t/courts to stuff that new court ruling.  The other 50% are still &quot;in chair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Canadian consumers subsidize MILK, chicken, turkey, & eggs to the tune of billions because no one can start a farm and sell these things, just those the gov&#39;t allows.  Those farmers have pools.  But not beef farmers. Why? I dunno...<br/>
<br/>
Canada is sooo frikkin&#39; huge, even our provincial government is remote from most of the needs of the regions, let alone the gov&#39;t in Ottawa.  The differences in service you get when you are close to the legislative capital or large population centre is appalling - even finding a doctor!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Can. brand health care may be &quot;free&quot; but you line up with all the others.  If you need heart surgery, you wait.  And wait.  And if you die in the meantime, aww well, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have political log rolling I&#39;m told is rampant in US, so instead we elect a KING for 4 years in provincial capitals and in Ottawa, and unless they do something wholly stupid/evil, they cannot be removed, slowed down, or negotiated with.  They can cut spending or increase it without fear in Years 1&2.  In fact, an old 50&#39;s politican had the recipe that got him re-elected over and over.  &quot;Cut spending deep in Years 1&2, then give it back in Year 4&quot;  Essentially buy votes with your kingly powers.  Sigh.   Oh, and the regional rep from your hometown is a LAME duck.  He votes the party line or he&#39;s out as an independent - where he&#39;s MORE useless and won&#39;t get re-elected, not ever.<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve heard, US unions are there to train the worker, help them, you know.  Can. unions have evolved in monstrous bureaucracys where some of the workers use their union power to sit on their butts.  Pitiful.  I was in a union in the forest industry that walked out on a nice day on a ridiculous issue - to go fishing.  <br/>
The most powerful is CUPE.  They organized all the municiplaities in Canada.  They get lovely wages and benefits and never strike for more than a week because no mayor in Canada is going to let the garbage pile up.  I&#39;ve negotiated two such contracts from the employer&#39;s side and it&#39;s revolting compared to what a hard worker at a small company gets.<br/>
<br/>
Taxes on Can. gasoline are appalling too.  I live in a town with a refinery, but my gas is more expensive here than in most of Canada.  Aboooot 60% of the price (or some such) is tax.  An American &quot;foreign&quot; student I went to univ. with in the early 90&#39;s said that if the US applied the same gas tax then, their national debt would be gone in 5-10 years.  EEK!  You could be debt-free!  But paying $2.50 per gallon, I think.  (let&#39;s see $0.80 per litre times 4 litres in a gallon...makes my head hurt.  Where&#39;s the kid who like math at 5 a.m. when you need her?)<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t remember the percentage, but a huge percent of the Canadian population actually lives in Calif.  I know why.  It&#39;s warm there!!!!  :O))  -40 degrees sucks.  Really.  Not that all of Canada gets that temperature.  Some of the weenies on the Coast (Hi, Tia!) haven&#39;t seen -40 (recently).  And where I live we don&#39;t get the 40 mph winds when it&#39;s -40.  The snow piles up on the fence post til it topples over.  Shangrala!<br/>
<br/>
So, Canada has a dark side, eh.  Esp. when you are struggling to raise a family/make ends meet.  Not that I&#39;m moving south, mind you :O)))<br/>
<br/>
My (morning) thots.  TTFN!<br/>
<br/>
Tim T.<br/>
<br/>
PS.  Can&#39;t skate.  Almost hate hockey.  Soccer is wayyyy better.  But don&#39;t tell any Canucks - I&#39;ll get beat up.<br/>

<br/>
Holly started one just this week.  <br/>
She owed me $3 and said she was going to put it in the bank instead, and I <br/>
should sign the way I wanted my account to read.  I said &quot;signature or name?&quot;  <br/>
She said whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I signed her little book, and I think I&#39;m account #1.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I asked her what I needed to do to get my money out.  She hesitated, and <br/>
I thought if it were me I would say &quot;Who said anything about getting it out?&quot; <br/>
 But she said just ask for it.  I asked if I needed to request it in advance <br/>
and she said it depends.<br/>
<br/>
Just like a real bank, then.<br/>
<br/>
Then she went to hit Marty up to put his money in her bank too.  He was <br/>
unenthusiastic. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby lately got a bank account with a debit card, which might have been her <br/>
inspiration.<br/>
