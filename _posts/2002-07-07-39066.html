 </span></blockquote>I would say I learned to play guitar on my own, too. But - once again - I&#39;m <br/>
doing that thing where I&#39;m offering an intermediate way to look at it, <br/>
thinking that a stepping stone might help someone get across the river, <br/>
whereas you are telling them to just jump the whole river at once. I, myself, <br/>
jumped the whole river &lt;G&gt; gleefully!!!! -- but I must admit that there were <br/>
moments when just THINKING about the stepping stones helped me be able to <br/>
jump. So - if someone just stops and thinks, for a minute, of &quot;they teach <br/>
themselves&quot; as not pertaining to MOST of what the kids are learning, but only <br/>
to the times when they follow a structured, systematic instructional mode of <br/>
learning sometthing, then I think it won&#39;t be long before they &quot;get it&quot; that <br/>
THAT is learning on their own, too. I remember asking, on the AOL boards, <br/>
&quot;So, when you say your kids learn on their own, do your kids just go to the <br/>
bookshelf and pick out a math book and start from the beginning and study on <br/>
their own?&quot; Well - unschoolers answered that question in so many different <br/>
ways, but I remember Christine Webb saying, &quot;Yes, that is possible.&quot; Somehow <br/>
that indicated to ME that it was also possible that they wouldn&#39;t and THAT is <br/>
what got me really focused on thinking about all the OTHER ways kids might <br/>
really learn math, and the rest is history.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People get paid to teach even when nobody learns!  But I think it&#39;s very <br/>
&gt; strange to refer to &quot;I teach&quot; as intransitive, as being a verb which <br/>
&gt; requires <br/>
&gt; no object/learner/student.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a teacher lectures in the forest and nobody hears it...<br/>
&gt; If a teacher lectures in a classroom and nobody&#39;s actually listening...<br/>
&gt; If a teacher presents a lesson and everyone there already knows the <br/>
&gt; material...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is no teaching happening.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And yet, they DO get paid for it &lt;G&gt;. So maybe going through the motions of <br/>
giving instruction is the best definition of &quot;teaching.&quot; All the more reason <br/>
for the term to be discarded by people who are trying to get a better <br/>
understanding of unschooling.<br/>
