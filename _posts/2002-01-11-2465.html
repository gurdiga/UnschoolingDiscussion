<div id="ygrps-yiv-410940338">&lt;&lt;history of style project&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;cool idea even without the patch&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I tested for my black belt, it was required that we write a paper.<br/>
Some of the required topics were a history of the style and of karate in<br/>
general, past masters, etc..  It was so cool.  Mine ended up being longer<br/>
than my Master&#39;s Thesis.  What&#39;s funny is I know exactly where my copy of<br/>
that paper is at this very minute.....don&#39;t have a clue about the Thesis.<br/>
