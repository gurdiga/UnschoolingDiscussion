My mother didn&#39;t die - she left my dad and he wouldn&#39;t allow us to <br/>
go - or to see her.  This was many many years ago when divorce was <br/>
unheard of - but it was almost as though she was dead.<br/>
But I survived just like you and many more children have - and Yes <br/>
i&#39;m sure it made me a stronger person<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097613229">My mother didn&#39;t die - my father did 2 years ago.  It took me a year to get<br/>
guardianship of my mother, she has Alzheimers.  My brother who was the<br/>
closest to her didn&#39;t want to do it or help other than sign that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
stop me.  We moved her out of her home & she&#39;s been in assisted living for a<br/>
year now & is in another world most of the time.  I used to be the daughter<br/>
that got in her way & was too independant & too different for her to want to<br/>
know.  My brother on the other hand let her do everything she wanted.  Guess<br/>
that shows you who the strongwilled child was in our house.  But now when<br/>
the staff talks to me they say I&#39;m the only one she speaks of.  And when my<br/>
brother came to see her (one time only) she didn&#39;t recognize him, I felt so<br/>
bad for him.  He couldn&#39;t face seeing her this way so I&#39;m glad she&#39;s here in<br/>
town close to me.  The three youngest kids go with me to visit 1-2 times a<br/>
week.  It gives them an understanding that not all older people have the<br/>
same active life style their other grandparents do.</div>
