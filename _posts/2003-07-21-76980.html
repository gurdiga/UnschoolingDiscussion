<div id="ygrps-yiv-145394404">Some grandparents don&#39;t deserve rights some do, some can not be worked out<br/>
. <br/>
My sons grandmother threatened for years to take him. The last time he saw <br/>
them Grandpa was trying to run out of a mall with him while Grandma and Aunt <br/>
tried to keep me busy. I spotted him and ran to get my son. He was 3 maybe 4, he <br/>
had no idea what was happening.<br/>
<br/>
I called his biological dad who by the way has never seen or met him. I told <br/>
him what happened and that I was getting an order against them. He and I <br/>
agreed that since I was remarried and his Mom was controlling and abusive that it <br/>
was best if he relinquished rights so he did. Kinda sad but the best situation.<br/>
<br/>
They tried to come once someone at their home even told the local police that <br/>
they had flown here. We packed the kids and took the dirt road out of here. <br/>
<br/>
They say he is considered a king as he is the first male grandchild. They <br/>
have savings accounts and stocks in his name. I don&#39;t know how they did that?  <br/>
They tried to buy his love when they where here. No amount of money or court <br/>
will cause me to send him to visit them when I know he will not be safe.  <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; In Pennsylvania and several other states, grandparents do have the <br/>
right to get court-ordered visitation rights to their grandkids.  It really <br/>
bothers me that this should even be necessary, though.  You would think we <br/>
would all <br/>
have the maturity to work these things out like adults.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
