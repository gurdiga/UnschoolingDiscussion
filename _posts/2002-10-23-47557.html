<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118208165">When ever I hear about the I spank my kids idea I want to say &quot;do unto<br/>
others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; Would you want to be<br/>
physically injured every time you take a mis-step in life? We would all<br/>
be belting each other and often. When do you stop assaulting the<br/>
child/ren? What age?When they learn what? Physically injuring little<br/>
people hurts. It is NOT OKAY! There are other ways. They might not be<br/>
the McDonalds (quick method)&quot;I feel angry so I think I will hit you so I<br/>
get the control and power and you go away temporarily until next time&quot;<br/>
way.  If you go overboard and cause bruises and welts what do you do/say<br/>
to the child? Can you control your own anger? Can YOU learn a different<br/>
way of thinking and reacting instead of physically injuring your child<br/>
to release these emotions? I think so many adults expect more out of<br/>
kids than they do themselves or other adults and it REALLY makes me<br/>
angry. I am not going to hit you for it though. Your kids don&#39;t get that<br/>
choice do they? Michele <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; Can I think of you even when I&#39;m drinking my blue Gatorade??? &lt;BEG&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The colored foods thing reminded me of something I learned at a Halloween<br/>
party this week --<br/>
<br/>
Orange juice and peppermint syrup make a really stunning green concoction<br/>
which the woman who made it deemed witches&#39; brew.  It even tasted good.<br/>
<br/>
And I never thought I&#39;d drink those wacko colored things...something new<br/>
every day!<br/>
