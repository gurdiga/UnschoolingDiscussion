<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049822572">&lt;&lt;&lt;A LOT of people do &quot;menu planning&quot; down to the daily snacks, desserts,<br/>
drinks - planning 20-40 meals EVERY WEEK. This is actually common &quot;wisdom&quot;<br/>
for budget planning and reducing your grocery bills (though I don&#39;t think<br/>
that&#39;s true). That would exhaust anyone, much less someone with mountains of<br/>
laundry, a baby and a kid with special needs. Something&#39;s gotta give; I saw<br/>
that as an area that could be deprioritized easily.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done weekly menu planning for many years, and yes, it does have<br/>
something to do with wanting to save money (we&#39;re on a tight budget, as are<br/>
most homeschooling families), but it has more to do with me making a good<br/>
use of my time and energy.<br/>
<br/>
I started doing it when my children were infants/preschoolers because just<br/>
about the last thing I wanted to do was to put them in the car to go to the<br/>
grocery store. If I could whittle grocery trips down to once a week I was<br/>
real happy.<br/>
<br/>
I still go to the grocery store once a week - the girls are now 11 and 13.<br/>
When the meals are planned and items bought, it&#39;s there and I don&#39;t have to<br/>
think about it again until that day.<br/>
<br/>
I do a weekly dinner menu. For breakfasts and lunches we eat leftovers and I<br/>
keep staples on hand.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner is important for our family - both kids and husband. When given a<br/>
choice they all choose having a meal at home that I&#39;ve fixed over going to a<br/>
restaurant, getting carry-out or having a frozen dinner. It&#39;s just something<br/>
I do to make everyone happier and our life go smoother.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>
