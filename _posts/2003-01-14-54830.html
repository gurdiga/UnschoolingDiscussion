<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202706526">This is creepy. I&#39;m having a Sandra Dodd moment--I was just <br/>
sitting talking about this very topic with my dh tonight and now it&#39;s <br/>
on the list. (Enter twilight zone theme music)<br/>
<br/>
He brought  up a similar concern--shouldn&#39;t kids learn to do <br/>
things that they don&#39;t like for the discipline of it? (He was asking <br/>
this as a way to explore the question, not at all antagonistically).<br/>
<br/>
I wondered too and then had this strange change come over me. <br/>
My own dh is a model of not sticking to what he doesn&#39;t really <br/>
like. He has switched jobs multiple times in our 18 years <br/>
togetherfrom missionary, to ESL teacher, to high school <br/>
English teacher to parttime professor, to self-employed, to <br/>
magazine editor to text book writer tto freelance writer/editor to <br/>
communications director at a church to IT director in his current <br/>
job. He also has a home business that he created from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are people who end up in jobs they hate, who learn to <br/>
put up with living lives that they must simply gut out, but is that <br/>
the goal for our kids? Do we want them to feel they must learn <br/>
how to put up with what they don&#39;t want to do as a way to train <br/>
them to do what they don&#39;t want to do?<br/>
<br/>
And as far as doing things that we choose to do that we don&#39;t <br/>
enjoy.... well it ocurred to me that there are plenty of years to <br/>
learn that. Why waste the precious years of childhood (where all <br/>
their expenses are paid, their lodging and clothing and food <br/>
needs are met, their safety is assured) on training them for a <br/>
time of life that in fact may not come! I would rather they start now <br/>
with a chance to discover who they are so that they will choose <br/>
lives that they fully embrace because they know themselves that <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
We watched a new show on Bravo tonight called &quot;The It Factor&quot; <br/>
all about 9 young actors trying to make it in LA. it was fantastic. <br/>
Here are these young people laying themselves open every day <br/>
to rejection, negativity, and pain for the sake of their <br/>
passionacting. But they would clearly rather have a life that <br/>
included acting than live a life that avoided the repeated <br/>
rejections.<br/>
<br/>
When we become mothers, we choose to give up sleep, privacy <br/>
and our time for the sake of others and don&#39;t always enjoy it. But <br/>
we&#39;ve made a choice that is worth it to us. I want my kids to make <br/>
choices that cost them seomthing when it is worth the price. I <br/>
don&#39;t want them to pay up for something they care nothing for. <br/>
What a waste of childhood.<br/>

Perhaps it has moved from me to you, this mysterious deja-vu again and <br/>
again...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, there are people who end up in jobs they hate, who learn to <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
the goal for our kids? Do we want them to feel they must learn <br/>
<br/>
how to put up with what they don&#39;t want to do as a way to train <br/>
<br/>
them to do what they don&#39;t want to do?.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the scariest justifications for school. If people complain <br/>
about teachers they don&#39;t like or being in class with kids who bully and <br/>
torment them, people will say (JUST AS IF IT MAKES GOOD SENSE) &quot;Well that&#39;s <br/>
okay, because when you grow up and get a job you will have bosses you don&#39;t <br/>
like and co-workers you don&#39;t like, and so you need to learn to deal with it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, people don&#39;t have to stay in jobs where they&#39;re being harrassed and <br/>
bullied, nor work for bosses who are sadistic or stupid.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When we become mothers, we choose to give up sleep, privacy <br/>
<br/>
and our time for the sake of others and don&#39;t always enjoy it. But <br/>
<br/>
we&#39;ve made a choice that is worth it to us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ideally! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I feel that way, and I LIKE being a mom!  I am frustrated when even people <br/>
who are homeschooling will act as though they were minding their own business <br/>
when these horrible CHILDREN showed up and now the mothers have NO privacy, <br/>
etc.    <br/>

&gt; If I didn&#39;t do it, we&#39;d be in deep trouble. In fact, I took over when<br/>
&gt; his mismanagement GOT US into deep trouble with the bank, as well as<br/>
&gt; lots of local merchants, and I&#39;ve been digging us out for a year or<br/>
&gt; so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You see my point? Sometimes life hands you things that you 1)don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like 2) aren&#39;t any good at and 3) find extremely stressing, boring,<br/>
&gt; and futile...but you HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY.<br/>
