&quot;If you don&#39;t like how things are, change it! You&#39;re not<br/>
a tree. You have the ability to totally transform every<br/>
area in your life - and it all begins with your very own<br/>
power of choice.&quot;<br/>

AND NOW FOR TODAY&#39;S SITE... Ye olde story<br/>
<br/>
Create your own medieval story. This Flash site lets you create a<br/>
story by adding people, buildings, animals, trees and text. You can<br/>
add as many as scenes as you want. It&#39;s like creating a historical<br/>
comic strip.<br/>
<br/>
You might choose to write a story about hunting beasts or a kindly<br/>
king. After you&#39;re done, upload your story to a central gallery or<br/>
e-mail it to friends.<br/>
