<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079184522">I made my vaccination decisions when my son was born, and have left it at <br/>
that. i did so much research it made my head spin.  i think the bottom line <br/>
for everyone is to make your own decision. but the catch is to make an <br/>
&#39;educated&#39; decision. i&#39;ve talked to several people who honestly thought <br/>
vaccinations were preventative antibiotics, they had no idea that they <br/>
contained traces of the actual virus.  there are so many people who have no <br/>
idea the risks of vaccinations.my son does have allergies, which in some <br/>
cases doctors say that makes it ok not to have the shots, but there are lots <br/>
of reasons.<br/>
<br/>
when i researched the ingredients, mercury, formaldehyde, etc.<br/>
when i read studies connecting vaccinations with sids<br/>
when i learned that the federal government has established a fund to <br/>
&#39;compensate&#39; victims and families for injuries and deaths from vaccinations. <br/>
(it must&#39;ve happened a few times)<br/>
when i learned the theory that all major diseases and plagues go in waves, <br/>
and that these major diseases were on a downturn anyway when the miracle <br/>
shots came out<br/>
when i read the theory that aids, an immune system shut down, has grown <br/>
rampantly in the generations following the widespread use of vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
please don&#39;t ask me to provide resources on all of these. it&#39;s been a long <br/>
time since i did the research. i found a lot of information from mothers who <br/>
had home birthed, midwives, mothering magazine, other complementary health <br/>
books, and mothering magazine has published a book specifically on this <br/>
topic.  in the book they really try to cover all viewpoints. if you contact <br/>
the magazine they can get you a copy.<br/>
<br/>
i try not to judge or shame families i know who do get shots. i try to open <br/>
the door for conversation about all the things i&#39;ve learned, but i never <br/>
push. and i know some people who have all that info and still get them. but <br/>
at least they&#39;re educated about it.<br/>
a lot of people aren&#39;t, and have no idea there&#39;s anything to be educated <br/>
about. get these shots, and you won&#39;t get those nasty diseases. i just don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s that simple.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237985437">&lt;&lt;Actually, you have more choices than that. You can opt out of<br/>
vaccinations <br/>
for religious, medical, and philosophical reasons in most states,<br/>
although <br/>
some states only allow one or two of those three. Of course, they don&#39;t<br/>
like <br/>
you to know that you have that right, because then you might exercise<br/>
your <br/>
freedom to do so. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My two youngest children have only had one vaccine injection (tetenus),<br/>
and I know about the exemptions for PS and such.... but does anyone have<br/>
any info on organizations such as the YMCA?  We live in Washington state,<br/>
by the way.  We recently joined the Y and I&#39;d like to let my 2 & 4 year<br/>
olds go to the daycare occasionally so I can swim alone but on the<br/>
admissions form in BOLD letters it states that any child without<br/>
up-to-date vaccines will not, under any circumstances, be allowed in the<br/>
daycare. You have to fill out the vaccine dates and everything.  My<br/>
desire to have them in there once a week for an hour or so is not enough<br/>
incentive for me to launch a full-blown argument with them, but I&#39;m<br/>
curious as to what my options are, if any.  Does anyone know?<br/>

federal funds then they cannot by law keep you out due to your exemption. I <br/>
guess you would have to have the advice of an attorney specializing in this <br/>
type of thing. I used to have the link for someone, but I have lost all my <br/>
old links. Maybe someone else has it. . . its an attorney well versed in <br/>
vaccinations and the law.<br/>
