<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519795918">**If your library interloan has Pimsleur Japanese I would recommend it. <br/>
  I found Pimsleur recommended in a book about how to learn any language <br/>
and the author recommended Pimsleur.  From trying to learning French <br/>
over and over again over the years without much if any confidence in <br/>
fluency I have to say this is the best program I&#39;ve yet to experience <br/>
personally.**<br/>
<br/>
Jumping off on a tangent about French...<br/>
<br/>
Last Saturday (9/20) I heard on This American Life on NPR, a hysterical <br/>
piece by David Sedaris about communication between students in the <br/>
French classes he took when he lived in Paris.  All the fractured French <br/>
is translated literally into English.  I found the piece so funny that <br/>
it was hard to steer my car straight.<br/>
<br/>
This segment should be available online if one goes to www.npr.org and <br/>
selects the show This American Life.  From there look for a 9/20 air <br/>
date, or a title that says it&#39;s a classic or greatest hits show, or <br/>
search for David Sedaris.  (His story about being a Christmas elf is <br/>
also hysterical, if you like bitter humor.)<br/>
