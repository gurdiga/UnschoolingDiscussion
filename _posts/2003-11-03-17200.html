<div id="ygrps-yiv-831674938">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
My stoic child, Mikey, took a tumble off her scooter this evening and<br/>
can&#39;t/won&#39;t put weight on her right foot. The pain seems to be one general<br/>
small area to the inside of her ankle. There is no noticeable swelling or<br/>
any exterior sign of damage.<br/>
<br/>
I am loathe to visit doctors unless necessary, perfectly willing to go if it<br/>
is necessary. Our current plan is to see how she is tomorrow morning and<br/>
decide.<br/>
<br/>
Any experiences with general ankle injuries, how long to &quot;wait and see&quot;,<br/>
etc., appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451995967">I usually wait 24 hours, over night. <br/>
<br/>
The reason being, if the pain was great when the injury first happened, <br/>
then it only makes sense that the body would remember that pain and not <br/>
want to put weight on it.  After a while (usually overnight) the body <br/>
forgets that pain.  If the child is still not weight bearing the next <br/>
morning, regardless of swelling or not, I would take them in.  If Mikey <br/>
is putting some weight on the foot, I might wait for another 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I went for two weeks iwth a broken arm becuase it wasn&#39;t <br/>
swollen and the pain was only sometimes.  After a few weeks, I put my <br/>
hand into a pair of tight jeans and pulled it out and broke it more.  It <br/>
was still a minor break but it probably didn&#39;t do my arm a whole lot of <br/>
good to go for two weeks with the bone not set correctly. I was also in <br/>
some pain those weeks, not all the time but there were bad moments, I <br/>
remember.  I was just told I bruised my arm and that it would get <br/>
better.  It did, after the break was set and the doc said I was in <br/>
enough pain to be offered some pain killers for a few days. <br/>
<br/>
So I try to find the middle ground between &quot;wait and see&quot; and go to the <br/>
doctor immediately.   Non-weight bearing (or non using) means to me a <br/>
trip to the doctor pretty quickly, depending upon the kid.  My nephew <br/>
was hit with a baseball pretty seriously last week, and if he had been <br/>
my kid I would have taken him right away, just based on the way he <br/>
wasn&#39;t using the arm and wasn&#39;t moving it, etc. after the injury.  They <br/>
took him late that night and while it wasn&#39;t broken, it was bruised <br/>
severely.  One of the girls on my soccer team had her finger jammed when <br/>
she blocked a ball.  It swelled up pretty quickly, and we put it on <br/>
ice.  I suggested strongly that they wrap the finger to the other two <br/>
fingers right away and if the swelling didn&#39;t go down within 24 hours, <br/>
to take her to the doc.  They didn&#39;t. Two days later the finger was <br/>
still very swollen, and I was much stronger in my words.  They took her <br/>
to the doctor and the finger was splinted for two weeks, no goalieing. I <br/>
wanted to say &quot;I told you so&quot; and I wonder what would have happened if <br/>
they would have splinted immediately...<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m rambling now, need to go off to bed.  I think wait and see is ok <br/>
for a short time period (about 24 hours) but if he can&#39;t put weight on <br/>
it in the am, I&#39;d take him to the doc.<br/>

<br/>
Lots of experience with ankle and other injuries here.  I am a <br/>
homeopath and my daughter is a 16-year-old competitive figure <br/>
skater.  She falls dozens of times every day, at high speed, and <br/>
hard.  A month or so ago she dislocated her shoulder.  Last week she <br/>
had a huge swollen bruise on her thigh.  It is always something in <br/>
high level figure skating.<br/>
<br/>
I always carry homeopathic Arnica Montana 30C with me to the ice <br/>
arena, and a bottle of Arnica spray, as well as Arnica gel for <br/>
topical application.  We apply the spray if the injury is too sore to <br/>
touch, and the gel if we can touch it, and she takes the Arnica 30C <br/>
internally, as often as one pellet every 15 minutes when the pain is <br/>
severe.  And we ice the injury with a bag of crushed ice.  As the <br/>
pain lessens we take the Arnica 30C pellets less and less frequently <br/>
until she doesn&#39;t need them, or needs them only a couple of times a <br/>
day as the healing progresses.  <br/>
<br/>
For sprains and strains we additionally use Ruta Graveolens 30C.  And <br/>
for injuries to areas rich in nerves, like finger, toes, elbows or <br/>
tailbones, we use Hypericum 30C and Hypericum spray. <br/>
<br/>
If there is swelling or bad pain that continues despite the remedies <br/>
and the icing then I might get an appointment with an orthopedics <br/>
specialist to have someone look at an x-ray and see what she has <br/>
done.  When she had the mild shoulder dislocation I figured that was <br/>
what it was and that there really is nothing that we can do about <br/>
that.  So the Arnica is the best treatment anyway.  We did get the x-<br/>
ray to be sure she hadn&#39;t done more than that, though.  Same for the <br/>
bruise on her thigh.  <br/>
<br/>
When she has sprained her ankle, or her wrist, or injured her coccyx, <br/>
or broken bones (usually hairline or stress fractures are most <br/>
common), we do Arnica first and continue it, usually taking care of <br/>
the pain and healing the injury quickly and completely.  We go to the <br/>
orthopedics doc if it doesn&#39;t seem to be healing quickly, mostly just <br/>
to verify what has been injured and how bad it is.  So far she has <br/>
never needed a cast, only an &quot;immobilizer&quot; wrap for a broken humerus <br/>
once, and a soft ankle cast for a bad sprain.  <br/>
<br/>
For head injuries, however, we do not hesitate to go to the doctor.  <br/>
I still administer the homeopathic remedies, but we do not want to <br/>
take any chances with brain injury.<br/>
<br/>
I also broke my ankle stepping in a pothole and twisting it.  It hurt <br/>
badly, but I had my Arnica 30C with me, took some, and was able to <br/>
drive home.  I kept up the Arnica both internally and topically, iced <br/>
the ankle when it hurt, wrapped it with an Ace bandage, and was doing <br/>
well.  But after about ten days I noticed that it had suddenly <br/>
ballooned up, which hadn&#39;t happened until then.  That was when I went <br/>
to an orthopedics person for an x-ray and he said that it was indeed <br/>
broken.  <br/>
<br/>
He, of course, wanted to put me in a cast.  I said, gee, I have been <br/>
walking around on this for ten days now.  Seems to me I could just go <br/>
with one of those walking casts during the day, and wrap it at night, <br/>
so that I can get some sleep.  He agreed, grudgingly, and when I went <br/>
back for my check-up a month later he was very surprised.  He <br/>
said, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you did, but it sure worked.  You do not <br/>
need a cast, which I had expected I would be giving you today, and <br/>
you no longer need the walking cast, either.&quot;  He showed me the x-<br/>
rays and the break had healed very nicely.  <br/>
<br/>
So get some Arnica 30C from your local health food store.  Get some <br/>
Arnica spray and/or Arnica gel, too.  The Ruta and Hypericum, <br/>
including the Hypericum spray, are also excellent to have on hand.  <br/>
These are your best first line of defense in these types of injuries <br/>
and cheap, too!  Ice and immobolize as much as possible.  If pain <br/>
continues or swelling occurs then get to the orthopedics doc to see <br/>
what has happened.  Usually this is just reassuring, but helps to <br/>
know exactly what you are dealing with.  <br/>
