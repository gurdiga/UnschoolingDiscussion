<div id="ygrps-yiv-361495435">Julian is a very happy boy right now. His dad for the holidays got him a <br/>
great present...a box of 4000 Magic cards. The hobby shop is no longer <br/>
selling individual cards, so they packed them up in boxes of 4000 for forty <br/>
bucks. They&#39;re all common cards, but since he&#39;s a player and not a collector, <br/>
he is thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
He is also learning to do chain mail, which is very cool. We gotta connect <br/>
with SCA finally after Christmas.<br/>
