******************<br/>
It&#39;s a longstanding motherly tradition for moms to heave a great sigh about *how HARD* it is to be a mom, and *how DIFFICULT* children are, and then for all the other moms to mutter on about how they understand and how entirely correct the sigh-heaving mom is.<br/>

It&#39;s like everything in life has a plus and a minus, otherwise we will be stepford wives. We get the glory and we take the blame. The key is to get more glory then blame. I had to be the Mom and the Dad to my kids. I was and still am awesome in some areas and in others it&#39;s a learning curve. My children never bring up the bad choices, they just love me for loving them when they were driving me CRAZY. We work it out and give each other space to succeed and to fail. The rest we leave up to God.<br/>

So the first response she got was someone sighing and whining about how her children drive HER crazy, but she loves them anyway, even though she &quot;has to&quot; be both mother and father to them.<br/>

Negativity causes divorce.<br/>
Negativity causes sorrow.  Negativity IS sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
And having the boogey-man &quot;stepford wife&quot; as a justification for NOT being generous or kind or good gives one permission to do anything she wants, and say &quot;Well otherwise I will be a stepford wife.&quot;  But in this situation, she&#39;s not a wife at all, for some reason I don&#39;t know.  I think if she were widowed she would&#39;ve mentioned it, maybe.<br/>

I had the feeling you were trying to find ways to justify and protect your negative attitudes instead of ways to let them go. I could be entirely wrong. It&#39;s a longstanding motherly tradition for moms to heave a great sigh about *how HARD* it is to be a mom, and *how DIFFICULT* children are, and then for all the other moms to mutter on about how they understand and how entirely correct the sigh-heaving mom is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691237650">I struggle with what to do when these situations come up face-to-face. I<br/>
tend to remain silent, or make neutral conversational noises, but sometimes<br/>
people will press you when you don&#39;t agree with them.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do when a your friend&#39;s kid comes to your house and tells you<br/>
her mom is �mad all the time�?<br/>

Any mom who says she likes being with her kids is either lying, a martyr, or unfairly has compliant kids. Whichever, she&#39;s obviously someone who has no intention of fitting in which generally irritates people in the group.<br/>

<br/>
It could be hyperbole, depending on the child - if she&#39;s used to other kids complaining about parents and parents complaining about each other and their parents and siblings and friends then she&#39;s doing what people do - it&#39;s her norm. Recognize that it&#39;s common to say &quot;all the time&quot; as an off-hand turn of phrase which is really meaningless - one of the reasons we discourage parents from using it with reference to kids (he&#39;s always whining... she&#39;s always on the computer...).<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, is there reason to believe mom is stressed out? Is there some way you can help? Offer to host this friend more often so mom gets a break and can be easier with her kids? That would be a kind thing to do for the other family. <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s something more than a tired, stressed-out mom who tends to be grumpy, the best you can do is provide a safe refuge for the kid - and for that to happen, her mom needs to feel okay about her kid going to your house. <br/>

<br/>
And it&#39;s us-vs-them bonding, which seems to be an aspect of our human nature - not one of the nicer aspects! It&#39;s not really any different than men complaining about fickle, demanding females... or people complaining about other ethnic groups or religious groups or political parties. It&#39;s a kind of bonding, but with an ugly twist, instead of celebrating what&#39;s good about &quot;us&quot; it&#39;s attacking &quot;them&quot;. <br/>

Maybe, too, you could talk about the different things &quot;mad&quot; can be--frustration, or negativity, out of habit or in response to situations.  The idea can be talkeda bout without talking about that particular always-mad mom.  <br/>
<br/>
Giving the visiting child ideas about how to be more patient, or how to deal with other people&#39;s anger, could be a huge gift.  Maybe examples will come up at your house, or in movies, TV shows, songs, books....<br/>
