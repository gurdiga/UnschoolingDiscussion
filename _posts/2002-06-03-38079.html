&lt;&lt; Ren - the term for the distinction you draw is &quot;people first&quot;<br/>
 language.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m aware of that. I guess in dealing with so many people that have <br/>
varying disabilities, I have distaste for the term &quot;disabled&quot; when referring <br/>
to physical and mental disabilities.<br/>
I do however, think that disabled perfectly applies to miserable, selfish, <br/>
dysfunctional people.  I suppose that&#39;s unfair.<br/>
The Deaf community is very exclusive sometimes.<br/>
My sis and her good friend started a program to help build bridges between <br/>
the deaf community and the hearing. It&#39;s been an interesting project, there <br/>
is certain etiquette one has to know when dealing with the deaf community. <br/>
Things I never would have been aware of.<br/>

&lt;&lt; .  So really our brains are always capable of being &quot;re-wired&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To a  point. I&#39;m sure there will be amazing research in this arena over the <br/>
next decade and beyond.  You can do a hemisperectomy (removal of half the <br/>
brain) on a young child and the other half can almost take on the tasks of <br/>
the entire brain.<br/>
The older the child is, the more likely there will be permanent, severe <br/>
problems. I can&#39;t imagine a Hemispherectomy done on an adult yielding very <br/>
good results.<br/>
Neural pathways are still formed at an amazing rate the first five years.<br/>

Any chance you could get them to split it up and go running, go exercise,<br/>
box, ride bikes, etc?  Maybe they could channel that fighting instinct in a<br/>
more positive way.  Just a thought.<br/>
