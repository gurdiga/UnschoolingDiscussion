However, in addition to requiring more sleep than do 9 and 10 year <br/>
old children, or adults, teenagers typically have altered biologic <br/>
rhythms which vary the time of night teenagers sleep best and the <br/>
times of day teenagers are most alert. The timing of sleep and wake <br/>
is very dependent on the sun. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130537294">Yet another reason to run not walk away from public schools.   This <br/>
is reasonably well accepted information. <br/>
So given that . . .<br/>
. . .  Why do the majority of school systems start the high schools <br/>
EARLIER than the elementary schools???  Most of them claim it is <br/>
because the same buses are used for both so they have to stagger the <br/>
hours.  Of course, they could stagger them the other way round but <br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
