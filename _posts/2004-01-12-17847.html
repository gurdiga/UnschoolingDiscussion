<div id="ygrps-yiv-1065674420">    &quot;Set me a task in which I can put something of my very self, and it is a <br/>
task no longer; it is joy; it is art.&quot; - Bliss Carman<br/>
<br/>
On a Candian homeschooler&#39;s site (she started it as a teen, I think, but is a <br/>
little older now, I&#39;m guessing) she has a page of quotes, and lots of other <br/>
great things.<br/>

<br/>
The site is a little tricky to get ALL of, meaning I don&#39;t think anyone could <br/>
find everything, which makes me feel guilty about my own site being somewhat <br/>
the same way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to link to her advice to new homeschoolers&#39; parents, though, <br/>
probably from my deschooling page.<br/>
