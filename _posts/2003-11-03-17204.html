<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040164917"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; entered school after homeschooling, many<br/>
&gt; of my colleagues just couldn&#39;t wait to point out all the poor student&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &quot;deficiencies.&quot;  Much catty talk ensued about how &quot;those people&quot; are ruining<br/>
&gt; their children&#39;s lives, so I understand your dread.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son went to school this year and is making it hard for all those kind of<br/>
teachers because he&#39;s NOT what they expect a homeschooled kid to be.  He<br/>
gets along with kids of all different ages and is way ahead of his age peers<br/>
academically.  They just decided to move him up a grade so he&#39;d be<br/>
challenged more.  <br/>
<br/>
Tim is really liking school, but he knows he doesn&#39;t have to be there and<br/>
that I don&#39;t give a darn about his grades.  So far, he&#39;s gone every day but<br/>
one when we went to the art museum instead, and today, because he&#39;s got the<br/>
flu.  And he&#39;s done most all the work, although he refused to color the<br/>
train cars according to the instructions after doing the math problems<br/>
inside them.  The teacher threatened him with a poor grade if he didn&#39;t<br/>
color them and he told her he didn&#39;t care and I wouldn&#39;t care, either.<br/>
<br/>
That earned me a phone call from the teacher, who was unpleasantly surprised<br/>
to learn that Tim was right that I didn&#39;t care, and that I thought<br/>
worksheets are a poor way to teach children anything.  His new teacher<br/>
doesn&#39;t believe in worksheets and thinks children need lots of opportunities<br/>
to learn by doing.  I think we&#39;ll get along just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, don&#39;t fear Holly going to school.  There really are some good<br/>
teachers out there who are fun and challenging and she might get lucky and<br/>
have someone like that.  Or she could get by the books, worksheet-happy<br/>
teachers and last about 3 days.  Either way, she&#39;ll be fine because she has<br/>
parents that love and support her, and don&#39;t value her based on grades or<br/>
school status.  <br/>
