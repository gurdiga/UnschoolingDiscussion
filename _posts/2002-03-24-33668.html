&gt;That sounds like a really fun life. Your post made me giggle (well, <br/>
&gt;chuckle,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m not really a giggle type) to the end.<br/>
&gt;Emily and Max have been going up to teh CSA farm with me, I&#39;ve taken on the<br/>
&gt;project of starting herbs from seed, in order to learn more about seed<br/>
&gt;starting for when we move to our homestead.<br/>
&gt;Max is very into star wars, I have started getting VERY interested in Star<br/>
&gt;Trek: TNG, love the pseudo-science! I would like to take max to a science<br/>
&gt;fiction/star wars/star trek convention. Any one have ideas?<br/>
&gt;Emily and I have been focused on building her socila life. Not that it is<br/>
&gt;really lacking there are just some kids that she is intent on getting to<br/>
&gt;know better. Our unschooling community is really growing. That is the worst<br/>
&gt;thing about moving out of the area, leaving my tribe. BUT, I&#39;ll just make a<br/>
&gt;new one! There&#39;s unschoolers in NYstate!<br/>

Our family is going next week to look at a place in Camden - Oneida<br/>
County.It&#39;s not nearly as upstate as Rochester. About 40 minutes east of<br/>
Syracuse.<br/>
We are currently in Maryland.<br/>
