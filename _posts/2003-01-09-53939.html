 No, I&#39;ll probably unsubscribe. I guess I&#39;m just spoiled by that silly little <br/>
 so-called right called &quot;Freedom of Speech.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>

OK, do you even know what Freedom of Speech means?<br/>
If Ned was actually censored, as you claim, he wouldn&#39;t be able to talk about <br/>

You seem to not understand what censorship or freedom of speech mean at all.<br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
