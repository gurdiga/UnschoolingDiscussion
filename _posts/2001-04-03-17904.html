worry about doing it right.&nbsp; I think focusing on your breath is just as

yourself up about it. That&nbsp;kinda defeats the purpose.&nbsp;

&lt;&lt; Sometimes if there&#39;s no action to take, thinking a lot can be turned to <br/>
 compassion.  Think soothing thought-blankets over the other people who are <br/>
 irritating you.  If another driver turns without a signal or some irritating <br/>
 thing, give them the possibility that they&#39;ve had a horrible day and if you <br/>
 were their friend you could follow them home and give them a hug (instead of <br/>
 thinking they&#39;re stupid and didn&#39;t take driver&#39;s ed or they hate you and <br/>
 wanted you to rear-end them).  <br/>

I have a suggestion for those whose brains won&#39;t shut down <br/>
enough for them to get to sleep, what about a relaxation tape and <br/>
headphones?  Or some &#39;white-noise&#39; thing, like some people have <br/>
for their babies?<br/>

the hours it used to.  Lie flat on your back, hands folded on your <br/>
stomach (if that&#39;s possible and comfortable...).  Close your eyes and <br/>
imagine your feet getting very warm and heavy.  Then your legs, and <br/>
move all the way up until your neck.  Go up the back of your head, <br/>

he&#39;s done the first time.  It takes me sometimes 10 times.  But it&#39;s <br/>
better than it was.  And it doesn&#39;t matter if your mind wanders <br/>
(which, I&#39;m sure is my problem).  Just keep part of your mind <br/>
focussed on the hypnosis, and it gets easier.  Well, for me, it does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-767675646">I used to listen to this &quot;relaxation tape&quot; from an<br/>
anxiety course I have called &quot;Attacking Anxiety&quot;<br/>
(lucinda bassett) and I&#39;ve misplaced it somewhere, but<br/>
it was soooo good. You did basically the same thing,<br/>
there were waves in the background and her voice<br/>
guiding you through each muschle group being relaxed<br/>
and getting heavy with each breath and then you<br/>
feeling your whole body just sinking into whatever<br/>
surface you&#39;re lying/sitting on....then some<br/>
visualization stuff and then floating back to reality.<br/>
It was amazing. I need to find that tape. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I&#39;ve seen a news report of at least one scientific study that<br/>
suggested that warming your feet does help you get to sleep.  They<br/>
suggested using socks, rather than your imagination.  Probably you can get<br/>
good results either way.  Whatever works.  :-)<br/>

&gt; This is a great idea, thank you. I am actually making tea right now b/c <br>
&gt; she has a cough. I can&#39;t believe she is going for it. I cannot mention honey <br>
&gt; though, for some reason she swears she doesn&#39;t like it. Strange.<br>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s funny I don&#39;t like honey either.... unless it&#39;s wildflower honey or orange blossum honey. Regular clover honey is total yuck as far as I&#39;m concerned... My kids love blackberry honey... You may try finding a different flavor honey and see if she likes that...<br>
