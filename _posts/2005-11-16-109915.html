 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t make two things every night (but then I don&#39;t always make ONE <br/>
thing &lt;g&gt;)--<br/>
I would make vegetarian meals sometimes and let anyone who&#39;s feeling meat <br/>
deprived make a meat snack later, and I would make meat meals sometimes and let <br/>
Cameron make something later, similarly, if the side dishes didn&#39;t do him.<br/>
<br/>
With casserole and lasagna, I do meat for 2/3 and then a smaller meatless one <br/>
for Holly.    She&#39;ll eat meat sometimes, but usually prefers not to, and she <br/>
especially doesn&#39;t like beef (neither do I, generally; neither does Kirby, <br/>
come to be cataloging it...).<br/>
<br/>
Another family we know had a kid go extreme vegan, and they&#39;ve about gone <br/>
broke getting her what she wants, and had it been me I would&#39;ve given her a food <br/>
budget, taken her shopping, and told her she needed to figure out how to feed <br/>
herself.   Instead, she usually gets prepared food (like fancy deli-counter <br/>
food) at the health food co-op or Wild Oats.   Or get her to at least plan some <br/>
foods that others will eat, and help with the research and prep work.   I said <br/>
&quot;kid&quot; but she&#39;s not little-- she&#39;s 16 and this has gone on for four years.   <br/>

<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to try to cook this stuff just by the prepared tofus.<br/>
<br/>
Nasoya makes prepared, marinated tofu in four flavors.  These are really<br/>
good.   You could keep some on hand and Cameron could heat and eat them<br/>
with rice or noodles and vegetables, or as they are for a quick protein<br/>
fix.   This way you don&#39;t have to buy extra ingredients to try to make<br/>
plain tofu taste like something other than muck. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other companies that make prepared, marinated tofu:  Soyco, Blue Lotus,<br/>
Nutrisoy and Kingland Soy.   These are all very easy, can be eaten cold<br/>
or heated and chunked and added to vegetables or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
There are a variety of seasoning packets for plain tofu and &quot;shake and<br/>
bake&quot; style things. <br/>
<br/>
There are prepared deli slices of vegan &quot;turkey&quot; and other lunch meats. <br/>
On nights when you are really not into fixing a vegetarian alternative<br/>
maybe he could make himself a sandwich.   The Tofurky people now make<br/>
sliced tofurky for turkey sandwiches.  David says it&#39;s not bad but he&#39;d<br/>
take genuine dead bird over tofurky any day.  Nine out of ten turkeys<br/>
disagree. <br/>
<br/>
There are vegan hot dogs if he&#39;d like that.  I was never a hot dog fan<br/>
but Dylan likes these when we go camping. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Fast for Cam to fix on his own or for you when you&#39;re not inspired by any<br/>
of the recipes I&#39;ll be sending you off list.  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
While not super high in protein hummus and Baba Ganoush will last a few<br/>
days in the fridge for quick sandwiches or dips.   Falafel is fast and<br/>
filling in a pita.    <br/>

when we were vegans we spent hardly anything.  Bags of<br/>
lentils, beans, split peas, rice, soy beans--they made<br/>
up most of our diet, and they are all under $1 a<br/>
pound, especially when bought in bulk.  You can buy a<br/>
culture and make your own tempeh, you can buy bulk<br/>
wheat gluten and make your own seitan--but mostly we<br/>
made stews and one-pot bean/rice/veggie-type meals. <br/>
We ate vegan for a family of 4 for $200 or less a<br/>
month.<br/>

<br/>
The prepared vegan foods can be expensive but we haven&#39;t found them more<br/>
expensive than prepared normal people foods. &lt;g&gt;   As Sandra said it is<br/>
possible to buy some of what you really want and eat it half the time.  <br/>
<br/>
We eat rice and beans a lot.  A lot.  And when were in a money crunch,<br/>
which has been all the time lately &lt;g&gt; we eat rice and beans even more.  <br/>
I grow a little garden in the summer.  I do a little canning.  It all<br/>
works out. <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to be expensive.  When I was a teenage vegan living in<br/>
Portland (Sounds like a bad movie title, &quot;I was a Teenage Vegan&quot;)  I<br/>
would buy a head of cabbage, a bag of rice, a bag of dry white beans, a<br/>
bottle of soy sauce and a bottle of sesame oil.   I subsisted on fried<br/>
cabbage and rice and beans.  I could live on that for a month or more. <br/>
(I accepted every dinner invitation I received though, too.&lt;g&gt;)     <br/>
<br/>

&quot;No ones life should be rooted in fear. We are born for wonder, for joy,<br/>
for hope, for love, to marvel at the mystery of existence, to be ravished<br/>
by the beauty of the world, to seek the truth and meaning, to acquire<br/>
wisdom and by our treatment of others to brighten the corner where we<br/>
are.Â”  ~ Dean Koontz from &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-462406009">Hey Kelly, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll email you offlist. I&#39;m the lone veg-head here....sort of. Most of<br/>
them eat whatever I cook, they LIKE my vegetarian meals. And I keep<br/>
frozen chicken for those that need a meat hit once in a while. Gross.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of recipes that even hard-core meat eaters love. And you<br/>
really don&#39;t need tons of protein, your body is just pissing it down<br/>
the toilet. It does use up some extra calcium for your body to process<br/>
though.:) There&#39;s plenty of protein if you eat a varied and healthy<br/>
mix of food, I bet I can find some recipes you&#39;ll all like.<br/>
<br/>
Something else you can do is cook a food like tacos and just make two<br/>
different fillings. It takes about the same amount of time to do a<br/>
meat filling and a veg filling.<br/>
I always make lasagne veg..but if you really wanted meat, you just<br/>
layer up a separate dish for Cam. It&#39;s all the same ingredients, you<br/>
just aren&#39;t adding the cooked burger until later.<br/>
Same with casseroles. Mix up everything but the meat, scoop a small<br/>
dish out for him and then add the meat for everyone else.<br/>

the available potato toppings was cheddar cheese. After eating a <br/>
bunch of squash and a potato, DS asked for a chunk of cheese and <br/>
wandered off happy as a well-fed mouse. Since we typically have mix <br/>
and match meals anyhow, and since any move in the veg direction is <br/>
from dietary (fat, sodium, additives, etc) concerns rather than <br/>
ethical concerns, it&#39;s no biggie to have meat sitting as a side dish <br/>
on the table. I would think that it might be an issue for someone <br/>
who is totally grossed out by the whole concept of meat and prefers <br/>
not to be near it/see it/smell it. That could make it harder on some <br/>
families with mix of veg/non veg members.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32822327">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have repeatedly tried vegetarian and vegan many times and <br/>
often for several months at a time over the last 15 years.  I have a <br/>
question maybe someone here can help me with.<br/>
Philospohically for many reasons we would like to be veggies but we don&#39;t <br/>
seem to be able to sustain it.  We go several weeks or months sometimes and <br/>
then we feel all out of balance and sort of too ungrounded and light and it <br/>

figure out what kind.  I read the &quot;Eat Right for Your Type&quot; and I am A which <br/>
is basically &quot;supposed&quot; to be vegetarian and he is O which is &quot;supposed&quot; to <br/>
be a meat-eater.  But nevertheless, even though I make a good balanced diet <br/>
of grains, beans, and veggies we still can&#39;t sustain it.  Any ideas?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our culture has told us for decades that humans have no instincts left.   <br/>
It&#39;s a lie.   If something looks and smells like food to you, you should probably <br/>
eat it.   If something does NOT seem like food to you, don&#39;t eat it no matter <br/>
what a book says or what you think sounds like a cool philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Within an unschooling context, I think it&#39;s worth suggesting that you listen <br/>
to you own body first and what books say and what other people tell you <br/>
second.<br/>
<br/>
Anthropologically speaking, people eat meat.   They don&#39;t eat meat every day <br/>
(anthropologically speaking), but our bodies can digest it.   And fire, though <br/>
it did scare away some tigers, fire some pots and smelt some bronze and smelt <br/>
some bronze (woohoo!)   they didn&#39;t move on to tofu, or use it to cook roots.<br/>
<br/>
-=- But nevertheless, even though I make a good balanced diet<br/>
of grains, beans, and veggies we still can&#39;t sustain it.Â  Any ideas?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think moving through a state of actual unhealthiness hoping for a state of <br/>
theoretical health is less mentally healthy than living in the moment, and if <br/>
you can learn to feel what your body needs by not eating by the clock, but <br/>
eating by what seems to be what you need, you might get a better real clue.    No <br/>
book knows what your body&#39;s telling you, and people have been told and <br/>
trained to ignore their bodies.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t ignore theirs.   Gradually I came to be able to feel some <br/>
message myself.   Sometimes I really truly want root vegetables.   Sometimes I <br/>
don&#39;t want anything.   Sometimes I really want juice and fruit.   Sometime I want <br/>
nuts, and not anything else.     Sometimes I go by smell, and if pizza smells <br/>
great I&#39;ll eat some. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know all the arguments for vegetarianism, and while I know lots of heathy <br/>
vegetarians, I know some who do it because they think they should, because <br/>
they&#39;re afraid to go back on something they talked up so vehemently, and some that <br/>
are just unhealthy and blame it on all kinds of things other than their <br/>
diets, because they have DEFINED their diet as &quot;healthy&quot; (or allowed someone else <br/>
to define it for them) and no evidence to the contrary will change their <br/>
course.   If they&#39;re having other problems, they&#39;ll blame something in the <br/>
environment, or the planets, or the insulation of the house, or <br/>
2nd-hand-aerosol-ozone-lack.   They don&#39;t listen to their bodies, they read expensive scary <br/>
magazines.<br/>
