<div id="ygrps-yiv-512901426">Well Christmas has arrived here.  My son is driving me nuts in the fact <br/>
that he wants to open presents now...I am a mean evil person in making him <br/>
wait until 10:00 to open presents.<br/>
<br/>
I got a present today...only 4 out of 12 of my foster dogs pooped in their <br/>
crate and no one danced it all over the walls of their crate &lt;G&gt;  and the <br/>
radio station that I like to listen to that does not always reach where I <br/>
live, is coming through loud and clear today and playing great seasonal <br/>
music...Talk about finding joy in small things hehehehe<br/>
<br/>
The roast is cooked, my cold is allowing me to breath at least a little bit <br/>
today out of my nose and I have a home, heat and food for today.  I am very <br/>
thankful.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that all of you find one large or small thing to smile about today...<br/>
<br/>

I did have a good day and it was even better when the SIL from hell <br/>
arrived and it was *her* dog that pooped where he shouldn&#39;t have and <br/>
not my new puppy! There *are* small things to smile about:-)<br/>
