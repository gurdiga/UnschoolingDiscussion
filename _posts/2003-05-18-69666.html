If we ignore him. he repeats and repeats and gets louder.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Me personally?  I&#39;d talk to him.  Introduce him to your aunt.  At the pow <br/>
wow?  I&#39;d acknowledge him, finish business, then talk to him.  (John!  Nice <br/>
to see you here!  I can talk to you as soon as I finish talking to this <br/>
gentleman.)  <br/>
<br/>
My son has some autistic behaviors.  Any conversation starter from &quot;Are you <br/>
taking the bus to town?&quot; to &quot;No school today?&quot;  will be met with a monologue, <br/>
usually about trains.  Often he&#39;ll initiate the &quot;conversation&quot; himself.   <br/>
Some people--a few neighbors, the cashier at the grocery store--talk to him <br/>
like he&#39;s a human being.  One bank teller looks through him like he&#39;s <br/>
invisible.  I seethed for a few weeks, couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and told <br/>
her, clearly and distinctly, &quot;He&#39;s talking to you.&quot;  (He wasn&#39;t interrupting <br/>
anyone here.  He started talking to her, and she never looked at him, <br/>
answered him, or acknowledged him in any way.)<br/>

<br/>
If we&#39;re still talking about the same guy, he&#39;s not trying to be rude.  <br/>
Really.  As for the &quot;others&quot;--I don&#39;t know enough about the circumstances to <br/>

Sometimes it&#39;s hard to know how to act around someone who&#39;s &quot;different&quot;.  I&#39;m <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-9922447">Hi,<br/>
Thanks so much for your insight.<br/>
We do introduce him to folks - again sometimes it&#39;s hard. I know he doesn&#39;t mean to do/say these things - but it&#39;s hard.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s an adult male and there have been a few instances where he was going to get hurt !<br/>
<br/>
But I will try that one about acknowledging him at powwow (in front of the customer)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
You know, he&#39;s a sweetheart, but he can be very annoying.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Janis<br/>
PS - my older children & I used to shop at a market in Prov. One of the butchers developed a little crush on me. Whenever we went in, he would leave his counter and walk around the store with me. He ignored my kids. Usually, he didn&#39;t acknowledge them w/ anything more than a nod. One day, my youngest, JL, asked him a question - point blank. The guy ignored - totally! JL asked again. Again, he was ignored. His sister, my oldest ( she was around 5-6; said &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Butcher Man. Our Mommy isn&#39;t going to go out with you&quot; Well, that got his attention. He looked down at her - my two kids were looking right up at him. He asked &quot;And how do you know that?&quot;<br/>
Channa said &quot;Our mommy won&#39;t waste her time on anyone that doesn&#39;t  &#39;spect us&quot;<br/>
She looked at me and said &quot;Isn&#39;t that right Mommy?&quot;<br/>
I smiled and said &quot;Yes, sweetheart - that&#39;s exactly right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hate it when adults ignore kids. We see so much of that. How can kids think well of themselves if their parents accept other folks disrespecting them??<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let me get off my soap box before I trip and hurt myself!<br/>
