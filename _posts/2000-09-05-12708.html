&lt;&lt; Also, we just got a satelite dish <br/>
 and suddenly we are receiving 45 channels with all kinds of stuff that I <br/>
 can&#39;t even believe is on there &gt;&gt;<br/>

I&#39;m a bit behind on posts but couldn&#39;t help understanding your disbelief in <br/>
what is allowed on TV and at what times!!  My children are young, 3yo and <br/>
8mo, so I will be very curious to read other responses to your message.  I <br/>
only allow an hour of TV for my 3 yo and it is only PBS child shows or videos <br/>
that I have previously watched.  I do this mostly because she is too young to <br/>
understand some situations and has a vivid and wild imagination...I know your <br/>
children are much older but I do believe I will monitor my childrens amount <br/>
and content of TV.  I think my main reason will be that I will want my <br/>
children to watch shows that have a high moral content (not sure if this is <br/>
the right way to say it).  I personally do not believe it can be healthy for <br/>
my children to watch wrestling or mob movies without parental supervision (or <br/>
at all in some instances).. Even at this young age of 3 I watch shows WITH my <br/>
daughter, to expand on topics, relate topics to OUR dialy lives or explain <br/>
why WE as a family don&#39;t do some of the things she sees, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I kinda spewed off (I&#39;ve been away from e-mail for several days!!) but wanted <br/>
to share my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
