<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621472595">I agree that you don&#39;t have to go to college to get a life. College can help<br/>
you meet interesting people, though (and get you those yummy credits, hehe).<br/>
I plan on taking a philosophy course in a community college, which should be<br/>
pretty cool. Also I&#39;d probably have to go to college if I want to do<br/>
something in the physics/astronomy range of the sciences. I don&#39;t plan on<br/>
going to college anytime soon, though. I want to travel around the world and<br/>
do my own thing :) ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906185426">I may have missed it, but regarding college...  What<br/>
about online courses??  There are many<br/>
colleges and universities now offering online<br/>
courses, either individually, or as part of a<br/>
degree program.  Thus far, I haven&#39;t found any that<br/>
offer a *complete* degree program<br/>
online... they all require at least *some* campus<br/>
attendance, though not necessarily at the<br/>
same college or university.  As a resource, try Lone<br/>
Eagle Consulting&#39;s website:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lone-eagles.com">http://www.lone-eagles.com</a> and look for Making the<br/>
Best Use of Internet for K-12 Education, a<br/>
free, online handbook featuring many, many links in<br/>
lots of areas which we have found useful.<br/>
If you need additional sources, just ask. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

 Find a Ceramic&#39;s Monthly Magazine and look for workshops in the Classifieds. <br/>
She could also call a local pottery shop (a supplier not a potter) and see if <br/>
she can find someone who would work with her. <br/>
 I&#39;ve helped a lot of potential potters on their way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-663716010">Even if you want to have a traditional transcript (perhaps even from a traditional school?),   one could &quot;get&quot;  4 years of English, 4 years of Math, etc   in the time period after age 13 or 14  and complete it in plenty of time to pack off to a traditional college. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, &quot;my&quot; feeling is that  instead of 4 &quot;years&quot;, one might complete 4 courses in less time.    Plenty of time to think of that once child is past age 10 or 12. <br/>

If our thoughts are accomplishments and credits primarily, you should maybe <br/>
buy into American School or some correspondence thing that gives credits.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at what Cafi Cohen has written about transcripts and maybe look <br/>
at one of her books, you might think of ways to work that into your life.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has to do with natural learning unfolding at a child&#39;s own pace.  <br/>
 There are no four year plans with math credits guaranteeing college-ready <br/>
transcripts.  Sorry.<br/>

premed is what she wants and it will be soon?  If she is there now then she <br/>
will learn that there are certain requirements for college, she will research <br/>
different colleges to see what requirements are different for each college.  <br/>
And if she has her heart set on one certain college she will either see if <br/>
there is a way around that requirement or she will learn enough algebra to <br/>
pass the entrance exam.  <br/>
<br/>
I just went through this with my best friend, she wants to go to a certain <br/>
college for her nursing degree and had to take an entrance exam with Algebra. <br/>
 She shuddered at the thought of math but was determined to do it.  So I <br/>
helped her learn.  We looked for a basic algebra book and I helped her get <br/>
through enough to pass the exam.  The other option for her was to take a <br/>
basic algebra class offered at the college.<br/>
<br/>
To satisfy your DH maybe you could try to translate what she does during the <br/>
day into &quot;school language&quot;.  That way he would feel better about your <br/>
efforts.<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts.<br/>

&quot;prelaw&quot;.  Students major in whatever they want to major in as an<br/>
undergrad.  At my college (Ohio State) there was no premed or prelaw<br/>
program.  There was also no undergrad education major.  They want their<br/>
students to be well-rounded, not spend their undergrad years just<br/>
preparing for their chosen graduate program.  I know a man who actually<br/>
majored in Golf so that his grades would be high enough to get into<br/>
medical school and he&#39;d enjoy his undergrad years.  He did get into<br/>
medical school and is now a doctor, and is very glad he majored in Golf.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-300802368">Interesting you mention this.  I was going to say that, but couldn&#39;t actually remember for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it matters WHAT you major in.  If you take the MCATS and you pass, you are eligible for med school.<br/>
<br/>
I hears someone else say this before too...that they had majored in something totally not health care, and they took the MCATS.<br/>

  *       studied so much together actually BUT you HAVE to be strong in<br/>
  math to get <br/>
  &gt; in <br/>
  &gt; a premed program, you just have too.  <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Actually, at many colleges, there is no such major as &quot;premed&quot; or<br/>
  &quot;prelaw&quot;.  Students major in whatever they want to major in as an<br/>
  undergrad.  At my college (Ohio State) there was no premed or prelaw<br/>
  program.  There was also no undergrad education major.  They want their<br/>
  students to be well-rounded, not spend their undergrad years just<br/>
  preparing for their chosen graduate program.  I know a man who actually<br/>
  majored in Golf so that his grades would be high enough to get into<br/>
  medical school and he&#39;d enjoy his undergrad years.  He did get into<br/>
  medical school and is now a doctor, and is very glad he majored in Golf.<br/>

for getting into medical school.  Well I know there are, I&#39;ve seen lists that <br/>
Cait has produced and printed and showed me from different schools.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe, if  you are wealthy enough to afford hanging out at college for years. <br/>
 There  are certainly other ways to figure out what you like or don&#39;t.  <br/>

******************************<br/>
I went to a cool, hippy college where everyone designs their own course of  <br/>
learning (Hampshire College in western MA). It was one of the things that led <br/>
me  to unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
I went there from a traditional high school without a lot of choices, and I  <br/>
loved it. I loved being in an environment where almost all of the other <br/>
students  were also excited about learning. Lots of other students there at the time <br/>
had  been homeschooled or went to alternative schools. I loved it, and it <br/>
changed my  life.<br/>
 <br/>
Peter Kawolke went to Hampshire for a year and dropped out. He told me that  <br/>
his experience was more frustrated-- that he thought his fellow students <br/>
DIDN&#39;T  get learning for its own sake, etc. He thought he could do the kinds of <br/>
stuff he  was doing at Hampshire (which he liked well enough) cheaper on his own.<br/>
 <br/>
My son Julian is 15 and has been unschooled most of his life. He&#39;s thinking  <br/>
about different options for the next few years, including possibly college. <br/>
One  option is just to work very hard on his music and focus on that. Another is <br/>
a  music conservatory. And he told me the other day that if he DOES decide on <br/>
a  traditiona college, he wants something competitive, probably Harvard.<br/>
 <br/>
The reason for Harvard is that he had a very positive experience taking a  <br/>
Harvard Extension college course, and he figures that while many less  <br/>
competitive college have professors as great as the one he had, that Harvard&#39;s  money <br/>
and prestige (and the student ratings of professors) make it likely that  he <br/>
could find excellent professors. <br/>
 <br/>
So there&#39;s quite a range: working on the Grunge band to entering  Harvard.<br/>
 <br/>
He already knows himself pretty well, even if he&#39;s not sure what he&#39;s going  <br/>
to want to DO yet.<br/>
