<div id="ygrps-yiv-494587302">I have a friend who&#39;s just decided to homeschool in Washington State.  In previous e-mails she&#39;s leaned towards unschooling but she&#39;s worried about the state&#39;s requirements etc.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any Washington Unschoolers out there (or anyone else for that matter) that can help me sooth her fears?  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what she recently wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been looking at the different curriculums and ways to do it, trying to figure them out. There&#39;s so many different ways to do it. The unit studies sound like the best mix of things so far, though I&#39;m not sure I completely understand them yet. I know in the beginning I&#39;ll be worried about the testing. He&#39;ll have to do standardized testing every year starting at 8 years, or be evaluated by a teacher who does a report on him. Blech. So with the unit studies, we&#39;d have the basic textbook type thing and reading other books, but all the creative, go with the flow stuff too. If we did total un-schooling, I&#39;d be scared that we&#39;d miss things that the &quot;state&quot; believes he should know and we&#39;d get in trouble. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472720625">Here!  Here!<br/>
<br/>
WA state requires us to cover 11 subjects.  I have used Family Learning<br/>
Organization for my annual assessment.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.familylearning.org">http://www.familylearning.org</a>  Your<br/>
friend can learn a lot from this website.  She promotes &quot;natural learning&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They sent me a form with a space for each of the 11 subjects.  I had to use<br/>
extra paper.  Under each subject, I listed the things my dd had done that<br/>
fit in that category.  It was really really really easy and quite nice for<br/>
me to see how much we had done just by living.  FLO has a &quot;certificated&quot;<br/>
teacher look it over, comment, and send it back.  I keep it in my files.  It<br/>
tells far more than any of my elementary report cards ever did, that&#39;s for<br/>
sure!<br/>
<br/>
Tell her to also check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.washhomeschool.org/">http://www.washhomeschool.org/</a> Washington<br/>
Homeschool Organization.  Their site has links to local support groups and<br/>
good info about the laws here.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works very nicely here.<br/>

Maybe someone looked over the typists&#39;s shoulder and said &quot;There&#39;s another <br/>
&#39;n&#39; in &#39;government&#39;.&quot;  She wasn&#39;t intersted in finding out where.  (Just <br/>
guessing.)<br/>
<br/>
Certified to certificated?  Maybe they really DID mean to say &quot;they need a <br/>
certificate, but nobody needs to REALLY have signed off and thereby become <br/>
legally responsible for complaints about the person&#39;s qualifications.&quot;  That would <br/>
make legal sense.  If you&#39;re certified, someone has guaranteed your knowledge. <br/>
  If you&#39;re just &quot;certificated,&quot; all it says is you have a piece of paper.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  <br/>
Makes sense.<br/>
Not good sense, but it can be twisted to a logical position.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592929374"><blockquote><span title="qreply">----- Original Message ----- &gt; &lt;&lt;  FLO has a &quot;certificated&quot; teacher look it<br/>

&gt; &gt; No kidding?  People who are unaware of the word &quot;certified&quot; are telling<br/>
people what their kids  need to know?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, this issue has received lots of discussion in Washington, and<br/>
not just among unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a summary of the law:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.washhomeschool.org/whoLaw.html">http://www.washhomeschool.org/whoLaw.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The state law says parents must &quot;3) ensure that a standardized achievement<br/>
test ... or that an annual assessment of the student&#39;s academic progress is<br/>
written by a certificated person who is currently working in the field of<br/>
education...&quot;  The law says &quot;certificated&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So FLO has contracted with a &quot;certificated person&quot; to read the assessments<br/>
and sign them.   There are some in the state who believe that this doesn&#39;t<br/>
meet the intent of the law.  I have never met this person and she has never<br/>
met my kids.  All she knows is what I write on the form.<br/>
<br/>
It would be nice if the state didn&#39;t require any testing or assessment at<br/>
all, but since they do, I&#39;m quite happy to use this method to fulfill the<br/>
law.  It gives me a nice record of some of the activities we&#39;ve done in the<br/>
past year.  The *certificated person&#39;s* comments have never been an issue<br/>
for me and she doesn&#39;t say much anyway.  I suspect that it is mostly the<br/>
less structured families who are using this assessment.  The<br/>
school-at-homers seem to prefer to have their kids take the standardized<br/>
tests.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the 11 subjects, the law doesn&#39;t detail how they must be covered.<br/>
It simply lists the subjects.  &quot;reading, writing, spelling, language, math,<br/>
science, social studies, history, health, occupational education, and art<br/>
and music appreciation&quot;  All very easily &quot;covered&quot; in real life.  My kids<br/>
don&#39;t need to be told they are doing &quot;subjects&quot; and it is easy enough for me<br/>
to decide which category different activities can go under.  Also, since the<br/>
state only expects us to educate our kids for an amount of time that is<br/>
equivalent to what ps kids spend in school, I only need to write down a<br/>
small amount of our activities to produce a very impressive assessment.<br/>

recognized quickly that they would be embarrassed by homeschoolers&#39; <br/>
high test scores. The law makes it clear that the test scores and <br/>
assessments are solely for the purpose of allowing parents to &quot;remedy <br/>
any deficiencies&quot;. Of course, one doesn&#39;t have to look at the test <br/>
scores -- one can simply have the child take them, and then deposit <br/>
the results, unopened, in a draw.<br/>

<br/>
That is correct.  The law states that a parent shall have the duty to &quot;(3) <br/>
Ensure that a standardized achievement test approved by the state board of <br/>
education is administered annually to the child by a qualified individual <br/>
or that an annual assessment of the student&#39;s academic progress is written <br/>
by certificated person who is currently working in the field of education. <br/>
The state board of education shall not require these children to meet the <br/>
student learning goals, master the essential academic learning <br/>
requirements, to take assessments, or to obtain a certificate of <br/>
mastery.....].  The standardized test administered or the annual academic <br/>
progress assessment written shall be made a part of the child&#39;s permanent <br/>
records.  These testing records belong to the parents, and reside with the <br/>
family.  If, as a result of the annual test or assessment, it is determined <br/>
that the child is not making reasonable progress consistent with his or her <br/>
age or stage of development, the parent shall make a good faith effort to <br/>
remedy any deficiency.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There have been many interpretations re the type of tests, test providers <br/>
and subjects to be tested as none of these are specifically outlined.  So <br/>
there is some room for flexibility here.  Secondly, assessment can be very <br/>
user-friendly among local support groups as homeschoolers use referrals to <br/>
get people who fit their style of homeschooling.  Results of either of <br/>
these are kept only by the parents.  Neither the state nor the local <br/>
schools ever see any of these UNLESS the child is enrolled at some point in <br/>
time in the public school system.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really not too complicated to homeschool here.  You file a <br/>
&quot;Declaration of Intent&quot; form every fall with the school district which has <br/>
your name and address and your kids names and that&#39;s pretty much it....and <br/>
you worry...the usual!!<br/>
