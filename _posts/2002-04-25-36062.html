&lt;&lt; My belief is, what you put in, eventually comes out in one form or another.<br/>
 <br/>
 eg. Read/watch violence.  Act violently. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then why does this peace loving, vegetarian Mum of four love <br/>
suspense/action/drama (often with quite a bit of violence)?<br/>
And how on earth do I get more and more peaceful every year that I age????<br/>
I also have read Stephen King a lot in the past...<br/>
Hmmmmm?<br/>

instinctual that we know we don&#39;t need? How many women read bodice busters<br/>
but how many of them want to be taken by violence? Perhaps some people love<br/>
peace because they are repelled by violence and some people love peace<br/>
because it makes sense so therefore watching it manages to enhance our<br/>
convictions.<br/>

giving your &quot;shadow side&quot; an outlet.  I believe he would also say that those<br/>
who try to be so rigid about these things end up with repressed &#39;shadow&#39;<br/>
side/unconscious impulses.....and that they&#39;ll make their way out somehow.<br/>
In other, less psychobabblish words,  what you fear,  you get.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you see a difference between movies like Lethal Weapon and Die Hard <br/>
and movies that are just gratuitous violence?  I can&#39;t think of any <br/>
example off the top or my head except Virtuosity - which is a halfway <br/>
there movie.<br/>
<br/>
I watch the one type but detest the other and many people can&#39;t <br/>
figureout why that is.<br/>
