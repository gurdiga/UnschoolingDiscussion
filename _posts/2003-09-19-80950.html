<div id="ygrps-yiv-428004438">My daughter made friends with another Sophie at the conference (Howath I<br/>
think?).  She sent us an e-mail today and I accidentally deleted it through<br/>
my mailwasher.  Could someone send me their address?  Or if Sophie&#39;s mom is<br/>
on the list could you re-send?  Sophie wants to respond, but can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Marjorie</div>
