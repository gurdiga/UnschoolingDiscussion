&gt; &gt; He just can&#39;t do it on paper, which is what the school will want him to <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But it&#39;s a bigger problem than what the school wants.  If you can&#39;t do it <br/>
&gt;on<br/>
&gt;paper, somehow you&#39;re missing a piece in your head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Many people here have talked about how their kids know how to do math<br/>
&gt;things, but not on paper.  They know how to do them in their minds, because<br/>
&gt;they understand the concept.  When shown how to do it on paper, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;simple transfer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it&#39;s like learning to play piano without music, and then having<br/>
&gt;someone explain what the silly little black marks on the paper mean.  This<br/>
&gt;black dot here refers to this key on the piano, and we call it C.  We could<br/>
&gt;call it George, or Fudnups, or whatever, but we call it C.  It&#39;s giving a<br/>
&gt;name and a symbol to something that any pianist would understand, but <br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;know how to put into writing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;School math is all about memorizing a series of steps to convert fractions,<br/>
&gt;come up with common denominators, multiply them, etc.  If your son <br/>
&gt;memorizes<br/>
&gt;that series of steps, then he&#39;ll &quot;get&quot; it.  But only as long as he <br/>
&gt;remembers<br/>
&gt;the steps.  (Hopefully long enough for the test is how I usually figured<br/>
&gt;it!).  But if he truly understand the big picture and understands what<br/>
&gt;fractions and decimals are, and how they work *in real life*, then doing it<br/>
&gt;on paper is merely an extension of that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;For him to have success at this, he needs to go find fractions, decimals,<br/>
&gt;and all that stuff, all over your life.  USE them, manipulate them, and <br/>
&gt;live<br/>
&gt;with them.  When you go back to the paper, THEN your son can expect <br/>
&gt;success.<br/>

Funny you should ask. I just posted this awhile ago. Alcohol will take it <br/>
out. You may have to use a lot but it dissolves it. If there was a lot, <br/>
right after I got it out I washed the clothing right away so it didn&#39;t leave <br/>
any discoloration clue that it had been there.<br/>
