<div id="ygrps-yiv-289146913">Hi all~<br/>
I live in a fairly isolated community that has very little available<br/>
children&#39;s activites.  I can drive to some museums or &quot;for-the-day&quot; jaunts<br/>
but nothing to do on a regular local basis, like horse-back lessons, karate<br/>
or dance or something artsy, etc. I have an 11 year old dd and 6 year old<br/>
ds.  My daughter is very out-going and is starting to think government<br/>
school would be the place to get in these fun activities.  I know this to<br/>
NOT be true!  I, on the other hand, dream of moving to a community near a<br/>
BIG city that would provide unschool/homeschool activities and social<br/>
groups, etc.  So I guess what I&#39;m asking is, how involved are you and your<br/>
kids involved in weekly lessons of some sort or how involved are you in<br/>
homeschool groups that provide kid interactions, etc.?  And do you feel<br/>
these lessons/activities are enjoyable and/or useful?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your responses,<br/>
Lisa</div>

 </span></blockquote>I think every family or child is different.  We meet with our homeschool <br/>
group once a month and then have one activity with that group a week.  The kids <br/>
are interested in dance, so we have that lesson once a week.  We are fortunate <br/>
enough to live in the Chicago suburbs and have family that has given the kids <br/>
memberships to some of the museums, so we do an outing of that nature about <br/>
once every week or two.  And we are even more fortunate to have a homeschooling <br/>
(but not unschooling, unfortunately) family just three doors down on our block, <br/>
so we play with them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
But I know kids that are scheduled each and every day and love it.  I know <br/>
some who are scheduled and hate it.  I know some prefer no schedules.  Tuesday <br/>
is our one busy scheduled day, the rest of the week we are free to do what <br/>
moves us.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the answer doesn&#39;t lie in what our kids do but in what your kids<br/>
need. My daughter likes to stay home so dragging her to activities would be<br/>
cruel. But it would be cruel to treat a child who loved outside activities<br/>
like my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
The question isn&#39;t what do kids need but what do *your* kids need.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain is involved in lots of stuff - dance classes, clay class (we&#39;ve<br/>
found the most wonderful unschooling clay class with the greatest<br/>
teacher), and shows. After doing soccer for 4 years, two seasons each<br/>
year, she&#39;s not doing soccer this year, and it feels weird. Those all<br/>
involve kid-interaction, but Rain&#39;s main focus is the activity itself.<br/>
<br/>
We generally hit a few activities with one of the local homeschool groups<br/>
every month - park day, astronomy night, farmer&#39;s market crafts day, or<br/>
something. For those things, Rain mainly plays with other kids - at<br/>
astronomy night last night, she took 2 30 second peeks through the<br/>
telescope, jumped on the tramp for an hour with kids, and then organized<br/>
the group into the cast of Peter Pan and got halfway through the second<br/>
act. <br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s just going to someone&#39;s house to play, which happens a lot,<br/>
too...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all enjoyable, I think. I don&#39;t know if Rain always enjoys dance<br/>
classes, but she wants to take them to further her musical theater<br/>
ambitions, so she does. I think what&#39;s enjoyable is always useful,<br/>
because enjoyment is useful...<br/>
<br/>
Rain is not as happy when we spend more than a day at home with just us,<br/>
or even with the boys next door. She thrives on lots of action and<br/>
interaction. We live about 40 minutes from the town where we do most of<br/>
this stuff, so it&#39;s a drive to do most anything. On the other hand,<br/>
that&#39;s just Rain. I know lots of kids who would be happy to stay here<br/>
more, to kick around the farm and play with the dogs and watch the hawks<br/>
and owls and all that... but not the kid I have.<br/>

<br/>
I can relate to the isolation part.  I live on a small U.S. army base in<br/>
Germany.  There&#39;s plenty happening around here, just not in English.  My son<br/>
prefers to not try to function in German.  That&#39;s fine, it&#39;s his choice.<br/>
But it does limit our options.<br/>
<br/>
My son takes tap dance lessons from a British woman who comes out once a<br/>
month from the city to teach him (I&#39;d drive there, but she doesn&#39;t have<br/>
space.  So I pay for her to come here.)  He plays soccer in the army&#39;s rec<br/>
program.  He&#39;s involved at our church, but I drive 1/2 hr. each way for<br/>
that.  And we do cub scouts locally.<br/>
<br/>
However, he does get use out of the local public (military) school.  I know<br/>
this isn&#39;t a popular suggestion with some homeschoolers, but it&#39;s realistic<br/>
when you&#39;re truly isolated.  See if there&#39;s a policy already in place (or if<br/>
they&#39;d create one for you) that would allow for your children to take a<br/>
class like art or music, get involved in extracurricular activities, clubs,<br/>
or athletics, or so on.  If the public school turns you down, try a private<br/>
school.  They might be more accomodating.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Tim went to a library &quot;class&quot; at the school and was in chess<br/>
club.  This year, he&#39;s interested in taking art, library, and a once-a-week<br/>
literature class that&#39;s a new &quot;special&quot; they&#39;re offering.  They also added a<br/>
computer club he thought about checking out.  Things we&#39;re not taking but<br/>
that were open to us were aikido (did I spell that martial art right?),<br/>
chess, general music, guitar club, p.e., etc.  I don&#39;t have a problem with<br/>
using the schools, we just do it our way.  And this year, the school called<br/>
ME to see what Tim wanted to do.  Maybe they&#39;re getting $$ for his<br/>
occasional presence.  I don&#39;t care, the money won&#39;t hurt them any; I just<br/>
want to get what he wants and not have to commit to more than that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as whether the lessons are useful or enjoyable depends on your<br/>
children!  Can you make a once a month trek to the homeschooling group of<br/>
the nearest town?  (Where are you?)  Would it be possible to drive to<br/>
something a couple hours away occasionally?  Have you called the community<br/>
rec dept. or parks dept. or whatever to see if they could offer more kid<br/>
stuff?  You may have to be really proactive!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if your children can identify what it is they&#39;d like to do, ask<br/>
around.  I found the tap dance teacher through a friend of a friend who<br/>
heard I was looking for someone who spoke English.  Even small towns have<br/>
talented people who do all sorts of stuff, and they might well be interested<br/>
in working with a homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
