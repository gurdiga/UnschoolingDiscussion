I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your leg.  Can you have your furniture<br/>
rearranged so that your computer ends up next to a recliner, or something?<br/>
<br/>
I always thought that using a Palm Pilot or a cell phone to read email<br/>
was kind of silly, but maybe it makes sense for someone in your situation.<br/>

This is such a rotten thing, and I&#39;m sorry it happened to you.  I can&#39;t<br/>
imaging how painful and miserable it must be.  <br/>
That it happened at all is awful, that it happened while you were away<br/>
from home, and away from most of your family is even worse.   <br/>
I hope Holly&#39;s not too upset.  <br/>

Glad you&#39;re back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140434418">I&#39;m so sad I missed the conference, and will make it a priority for <br/>
next year.<br/>
I chose to go camping with 18 other unschooling families, the week <br/>
before, instead.  Couldn&#39;t do both.<br/>
I keep reading about how joyful it was to be at the conference, <br/>
around like minded souls, and can relate to that because of the <br/>
experience of this camp.  We made some good friends and can&#39;t wait <br/>
for the next one (spring).<br/>
I hope you have a quick recovery Sandra.  I was so sorry to hear <br/>
about it.  I&#39;m sure everyone really missed you.  I know I would have.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Carol. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be back one more year, I think.  And Joyce Fetteroll will be  <br/>
traveling with me next year.<br/>
<br/>
I think Julie Daniel will be confident enough to speak, and James,  <br/>
soon.  I would listen to them already, but Julie thinks having an only  <br/>
child who is young and easy isn&#39;t enough.   I was speaking when Kirby  <br/>
was nine, and just didn&#39;t say anything I didn&#39;t know for sure from  <br/>
personal experience, or that I didn&#39;t know from having taught, or read  <br/>
John Holt, or having been around other unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
Rippy and Graham Dusseldorp will be worth listening to, also, when  <br/>
they get the confidence to speak about unschooling and parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Soon I can stay home. :-)<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of being home, there is this, in Albuquerque, in  <br/>
December, and I encourage anyone who thinks someday they want to go to  <br/>
a serious symposium to come now, because life does not last forever,  <br/>
and your children are getting older, and Rosie Sorooshian will someday  <br/>
be too busy with her own family to come and speak to other people&#39;s  <br/>
parents, but this year she is going to come and speak, and lead a  <br/>
panel that should include Kirby, my oldest, and my other two kids too,  <br/>
perhaps, and maybe other older unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For those on the other end of North America from where I am in the  <br/>
southwest, you might consider Florida in October.  Keith, Holly and I  <br/>
will be there.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://floridaunschoolingconference.com/">http://floridaunschoolingconference.com/</a><br/>
It&#39;s fancier than the one in Albuquerque, but not as information- <br/>
rich.  Nicer surroundings (Gulf of Mexico, beach, two swimming pools)  <br/>
and more expensive, but there are kitchenette rooms so you can cook  <br/>
your own food.<br/>
<br/>
And anyone in Europe who has missed me, there will be at least these:   <br/>
Lisbon June 1, Leiden probably June 29, and Ashford, Surrey west of  <br/>
London probably July 14/15.<br/>
Start making plans now, if you want to see me in Europe.  I can&#39;t keep  <br/>
going there too much longer.  I&#39;m going to turn 60 next year.<br/>
