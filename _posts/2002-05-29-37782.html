<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459294885">I began homeschooling last August. We (ignorantly) started schooling at home<br/>
(lasted a week) and then tried to &quot;decompress&quot; and just let the kids hang<br/>
out. I did order some curriculum, but it didn&#39;t interest the boys. BTW, they<br/>
are 11, 9 and 6. I have been reading a lot of Holt, Unschoolers Handbook,<br/>
Gatto, your site etc. I would like to know how to take a more hands off<br/>
approach and really unschool, but recently the only things my children will<br/>
do if left on their own is watch TV or play on the computer. I have not seen<br/>
much interest in anything else unless I intiate it. Is this because they<br/>
have been in school so long that they are accustom to having things shoved<br/>
down their throats? I would really like to get some different<br/>
advise/input/suggestions etc. from any and all on the list. I am not<br/>
worried, but concerned. I would really like to get to a point of having them<br/>
find stuff they are interested in knowing and and go for it. (even if that<br/>
means they ask me for help) How do we get there from here?</div>

<br/>
Decompression itself in action.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing to do is your hard work, not theirs.  You can learn to see <br/>
the learning that&#39;s happening while they watch TV and play on the computer.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is this because they have been in school so long that they are accustom to <br/>
having things shoved down their throats?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Partly that, and partly they&#39;re just TIRED.<br/>
And partly they&#39;ve been told that books are good, and school is good, and <br/>
&quot;WORK&quot; is good, and that that&#39;s where learning is.<br/>
<br/>
Since that&#39;s not true, they need to find learning in other things.  If they <br/>
avoid &quot;schoolwork&quot; looking stuff for the next five years, they will still <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I would really like to get some different<br/>
advise/input/suggestions etc. from any and all on the list. I am not<br/>
worried, but concerned. I would really like to get to a point of having them<br/>
find stuff they are interested in knowing and and go for it. (even if that<br/>

<br/>
Slowly and patiently and immediately.  If learning is everywhere then the <br/>
parents have further to go to see it in their laps than the kids do.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s physically close, but mentally walled off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say give yourself six months or so before you even think of pressing the <br/>
schooly looking stuff like the library.<br/>
<br/>
Do the kids have e-mail?  maybe e-mail them website links.  And not anatomy <br/>
or the history of Liberia, but FUNNY stuff, fun stuff, pretty stuff, silly <br/>
stuff, stuff about the video games and TV shows they like.<br/>

<br/>
yes, I see that they ARE learning, lots of stuff! The other day my 6 year<br/>
old was at the park and pointed out that the spiral ladder on the slide<br/>
looked &quot;just like a strand of DNA!&quot;  I think I just need to build up my<br/>
faith that it is working. I look at some of the post here where I hear of<br/>
kids deciding they want to learn more about __________ and go to it. My kids<br/>
are still (in my opinion) being &quot;fed&quot; learning by watching too much TV and<br/>
playing too often on gameboy or computer. I will take your advise and give<br/>
it 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing. Carol</div>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think learning can be &quot;fed&quot; in.  It would be like pushing a rope. <br/>
But kids can pull it in.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re learning watching videos it&#39;s because they&#39;re thinking and <br/>
processing ideas and patterns and factoids (DNA or whatever!) and words...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s scary to start, but it&#39;s worth overcoming that fear!<br/>

or paper gets written doesn&#39;t look like much either. But loads more than<br/>
will show up in the book needs sucked in before patterns start emerging and<br/>
the important stuff rises to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
They are exploring seemingly (to adult eyes) random portions of the world.<br/>
And once they start noticing connections between the parts you see less<br/>
value in and the parts you see more value in, the greater confidence you&#39;ll<br/>
have in unschooling. And in the parts they find value in. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another thing to realize is that unschooling won&#39;t look like undirected<br/>
standard schooling. When they explore their interests, they won&#39;t be<br/>
building nuclear reactors in the basement. ;-) It&#39;s more than likely going<br/>
to look like playing. They&#39;ll write comic books, collect and organize and<br/>
play complicated card games, they&#39;ll make up convoluted stories with dolls<br/>
or stuffed animals, they&#39;ll build things with Legos. They&#39;ll watch TV and<br/>
play on the computer. ;-) Occasionally they&#39;ll do something that looks like<br/>
something that would be done in school which is when new unschoolers will<br/>
speak up and say &quot;Look! It&#39;s working!&quot; Well, it was working all along and<br/>
they just didn&#39;t notice! ;-) To the kids, the &quot;play&quot; interest and the<br/>
&quot;school&quot; interest aren&#39;t any different. They&#39;re just things they&#39;re<br/>
interested in. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974198145">&lt;&lt;I would really like to get some different<br/>

<br/>
Many times my kids have found things that interest them because I am a<br/>
voracious learner myself.  I am always reading, watching shows about<br/>
nature, science, history, etc., indulging myself in a hobby or craft<br/>
(sewing, writing, art).  This is what I would be doing if they weren&#39;t<br/>
here so it&#39;s not contrived, kids see through that.<br/>
<br/>
They are drawn to learning/discovery because of the light they see in MY<br/>
face.  Sometimes they spend time with me in what I&#39;m doing and vice versa<br/>
and sometimes we are doing our own things.  I&#39;m truly interested in what<br/>
they are doing and so far that seems to translate to an interest from<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Being interested makes one interesting.  Schooling does a good job of<br/>
putting out that internal spark, the hunger for learning.  It may take a<br/>
long period of being trusted to learn for the spark to get back to full<br/>
flame.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487422468">I FEEL THAT IF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM EVEN 1 OR 2 YEARS YOU <br/>
WILL NOTICE THAT THEY ARE USE TO BEING &quot;TOLD&quot; WHAT TO DO OR BE INTERESTED IN. <br/>
JUST AS YOU ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THIS TRANSITION, YOUR CHILDREN ARE <br/>
PROBABLEY TOO. I HAD A HARD TIME WITH THIS TOO AS I&#39;M SURE DID MANY OTHERS!!! <br/>
JUST ALLOW THE CHILDREN TO DISCOVER WHAT REALLY INTERESTS THEM ON THEIR OWN <br/>
AND I&#39;M SURE YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE LEARNING TAKE PLACE ALL THE TIME. TWO <br/>
YEARS AGO WHEN MY DAUGHTER(NOW 10) WAS TAKEN OUT OF SCHOOL SHE HATED TO READ <br/>
AND REALLY WASN&#39;T VERY GOOD AT IT. HOWEVER, AS SOON AS SHE DISCOVERED THINGS <br/>
THAT WERE OF INTEREST TO HER SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT READER. THE SAME WITH <br/>
SPELLING. SHE COULDN&#39;T SPELL WORTH A LICK AND WOULDN&#39;T EVEN TRY. SHE ASKED ME <br/>
TO SPELL EVERYTHING AND I MEAN EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! AS SOON AS SHE DISCOVERED A <br/>
PURPOSE FOR HER SPELLING IT JUST CLICKED. HONESTLY, JUST BE PATIENT WITH <br/>
YOURSELF AND YOUR CHILDREN. UNSCHOOLING DOES WORK!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST LIKE A <br/>
SEED YOU PLANT YOU TRUST WILL GROW WITH RAIN AND SUNSHINE SO TOO YOU MUST <br/>
TRUST YOUR CHILDREN TO LEARN WITH A NURTURING AND LOVING ENVIRONMENT. I HOPE <br/>
ALL THE BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME <br/>
ANYTIME!!!!!!!!!!KIMBERLY</div>
