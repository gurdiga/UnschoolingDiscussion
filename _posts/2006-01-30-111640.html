<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125901969">Well, for me..I learned to read very young, around 3. My mother says she read to us constantly, but I have no memories of sitting with her reading. I have always adored books, and remember being teased by kids in preschool because I&#39;d rather sit and read a story than run around playing. I don&#39;t really remember much about K or 1st grade, but by second grade I was extremely frustrated with the limitations of being in whatever reading group, because I was so far ahead. They wouldn&#39;t let me skip ahead, but I took advantage of a mid-year switch to a new school to insist to my teacher that I was not in one book, but at the end of two books ahead. So she got a copy from the 4th grade classroom, brought it to me, and asked me to read it to her. I did, so she let me go on from there. <br/>
<br/>
  What struck me as odd was that earlier that day, I&#39;d already proven my reading skills. My class had been in the library when we joined them and I was introduced to the class. I was told I could pick out two books, so I found two and went to check them out. The librarian and I got into it because she insisted I could not read them and had to be limited to the &quot;second grade shelves.&quot; I stood there and opened up one book and read aloud LOUDLY, my entire new class STARING at me, and the librarian stammered and insisted I MUST only check out books from the second grade shelves. <br/>
  My teacher had been nice, and she helped me choose a couple books..Madeleine was one of them...even though I was crying at that point because I&#39;d read it so many times and I really wanted the other books. She had simply said she would talk with the librarian and find out how I could check out what I wanted to. <br/>
  By the 3rd grade, I was really getting frustrated at having to learn about things I didn&#39;t want to learn about, moving on from interesting things (I remember specifically adoring amphibians because it&#39;s a longer word than reptile, so those animals were &quot;better&quot; LOL). <br/>
  I started being very selective in what assignments I completed, and started figuring out ways to hide books I wanted to read behind whatever I was supposed to be doing. 4th grade I spent nearly entirely within another teacher&#39;s classroom than the one I was supposed to be in, because I was allowed to just sit in the back and read to my heart&#39;s content (how they thought it was punishment I&#39;ll never get!) so I&#39;d do whatever to get sent there. <br/>
  Ultimately, I decided that school REALLY intereferes with real learning, so I only selectively participated as I wanted to. I realized that I had no other option in my attendance, but while they could have my BODY present, my mind could be otherwise occupied. <br/>
  The only reason I graduated from high school was because it was easier than dropping out, and I wanted to leave for the CG after graduation rather than have to wait another 5 months til I turned 18 living at home with my mother (we&#39;ve NEVER gotten along) in order to enlist. <br/>
<br/>
  With my kids, while intuitively I understood unschooling and why it&#39;s best, I have had difficulty letting go and trusting in it; and my husband has not been supportive at times. But with time, we&#39;re getting it. <br/>
