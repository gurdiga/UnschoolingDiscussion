<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001863861">to get started with this unschooling.  I have four dc and have <br/>
been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for five years now.  I&#39;m tired of having &quot;school <br/>
at home&quot; and want to allow my dc to enjoy being just that...children. <br/>
Their ages by the way are 9, 8, 6, and 19 mos.  I suppose I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
even have said &quot;get started&quot;, eh?  lol  Also, as I&#39;ve been discussing <br/>
this approach with my dh, he&#39;s showing some resistance to allowing our <br/>
dc to just &quot;be.&quot;  Any tips on encouraging him to relax...A LOT?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa</div>
