<div id="ygrps-yiv-860227285">Jayn had the work done on her teeth, including several fillings and the one<br/>
extraction, yesterday. It went very smoothly after a couple of tiny hiccups,<br/>
and she is recovering extremely quickly and enjoying the sensation of having<br/>
a gap in her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
We talked over the procedure beforehand and Jayn was not keen on having a<br/>
pinch. But we arrived a little early and were prepared to wait for her<br/>
willingness. <br/>
<br/>
When we got to the dental surgery, the only person out front was the<br/>
anesthesiologist, a stranger to Jayn. She introduced herself and was very<br/>
nice, gave us the paperwork, but the dentist was not around. I had a kind of<br/>
intuition that she wasn&#39;t intending to come out, and I also noticed that<br/>
Jayn was beginning to get anxious, not seeing her. So Jayn and I went back<br/>
in search of her, at which time Jayn got a big relieved smile and told her<br/>
the story about the sky falling as usual. <br/>
<br/>
She was waiting in her office, and later she explained that she usually<br/>
doesn&#39;t come out, but leaves this first part to the anesthetist. That would<br/>
probably be fine in the case of children who had been coming there for<br/>
years, but I could tell that Jayn was not happy with that arrangement. After<br/>
all the whole point was to find a DENTIST Jayn liked, not an office<br/>
environment she liked.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn went up into the tree house and repeated that she didn&#39;t want a pinch.<br/>
I said that the pinch was to help her sleep so that it wouldn&#39;t hurt, and<br/>
said &quot;I know you don&#39;t want it&quot; sympathetically a few times, and asked her<br/>
to tell me what she was scared of...I also told her that we would wait until<br/>
she is ready. After a remarkably few minutes she agreed to have the pinch<br/>
and chose which leg, and then came down from the tree to sit in my arms. <br/>
<br/>
The injection was over in a moment, with the an&#39;ist telling Jayn everything<br/>
she was doing, and then she chose her prize (a colored slinky) from the<br/>
magic tree, and after a few moments started fading and staggering. I put her<br/>
on my lap wrapped in her own blanket. I was asked to sing her a little song,<br/>
or tell a story, so that she would stop fighting it, and then she was quite<br/>
literally gone. I carried her back to the chair, and stayed with her until<br/>
the IV was in, and they put some paper tape to keep her eyes closed. Then<br/>
James and I waited in the waiting room reading magazines and listening to<br/>
the drilling - feeling grateful that Jayn was not &quot;hearing&quot; that stuff. He<br/>
tiptoed back once to check it out, and was given an update, and I did too. <br/>
<br/>
What was most reassuring to me, was the lengthy conversation that James and<br/>
the an&#39;ist had about her new high tech portable monitors and the detailed<br/>
explanation of the different drugs that were being used in a cocktail for<br/>
Jayn&#39;s comfort. It was entirely worth the extra money to have the<br/>
specialist, just for my peace of mind. It was all over in two hours, and we<br/>
just had to wait for Jayn to become sufficiently alert to leave. I was<br/>
beside her as she started to come to, and I carried her to the waiting room<br/>
to wait on my lap again - almost as if we had never moved.<br/>
<br/>
Once she was muttering and responding to our questions somewhat we put her<br/>
in the car and left. I just about melted with love when the first full clear<br/>
sentence she said was, &quot;Thank you for sitting in the back with me Mommy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn woke up somewhat, vomited once (just water) and then went to sleep for<br/>
what might have been an early night, except that she woke up after about 5<br/>
hours, hungry and energetic, and stayed awake until 6.30am - so no<br/>
interruption to her own schedule!<br/>
 <br/>
She got up today, Tuesday, full of beans at 2pm, ready to go to the<br/>
Aquarium. There has been none of the drowsiness or wooziness that we were<br/>
warned of. No swelling or bleeding. Her sense of taste seems to have<br/>
returned, and she has had no pain at all. She is chafing at one restriction<br/>
- no popcorn - but uncaring of the other - no straws. Her one resentment is<br/>
that she didn&#39;t get to see her tooth coming out, as she has reproached me<br/>
for. She also remembers getting the pinch and choosing her slinky, which is<br/>
unusual. Apparently most kids don&#39;t recall the injection.<br/>
<br/>
Now she just will get a spacer inserted in two weeks. <br/>
<br/>
In response to the arnica suggestion, Jayn would not take a pellet once a<br/>
day, let alone every hour. Any palliative or healing herbal medicines would<br/>
have to be dissolved in liquid and either tasteless or tasty. She has one<br/>
more week of antibiotics, just to be sure, and she is taking a bit of<br/>
acidophilus powder dissolved. I open the capsules and sprinkle. She finds<br/>
the liquid supplements too sour, but is eating yoghurt.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for sharing your story.  My boys have told me that they don&#39;t <br/>
like our dentist and would like me to look for another, so reading your <br/>
story was very helpful to me.  <br/>
<br/>
I missed the arnica suggestion, but I did want to let you know that <br/>
arnica pellets are sugar pellets.  The arnica is sprayed onto the sugar <br/>
pellets but you can&#39;t taste it.  So it&#39;s like eating sugar. :) <br/>
