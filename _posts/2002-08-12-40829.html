<div id="ygrps-yiv-965648085">I saw this term pop up in the diapers/babies discussion, and it struck me <br/>
as a meaningless word.  I&#39;m not trying to be offensive, but If you think <br/>
about it, when is a child at a &quot;pre&quot; unschooling stage?  It&#39;s rather like <br/>
&quot;learning to X&quot; as opposed to &quot;doing X&quot;    At what point do you cross <br/>
over?<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3yo daughter, and although she would be considered a <br/>
&quot;preschooler&quot; in the world at large, I consider that she is already an <br/>
unschooler, not a &quot;pre-unschooler&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem like a small nit, but I think it&#39;s an important one.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard both sides argued pretty convincingly.  But until a child is the <br/>
age of compulsory education in his state of residence, what would be the <br/>
difference between unschooling and just not being in school yet?<br/>
<br/>
What if every parent who intended to and did send a child to kindergarten at <br/>
5 said &quot;up until that time, we were unschoolers, but now it&#39;s time for him to <br/>
go to school&quot;?<br/>

&gt;age of compulsory education in his state of residence, what would be the<br/>
&gt;difference between unschooling and just not being in school yet?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One difference would be that they aren&#39;t going to be in school.  It isn&#39;t a <br/>
matter of yet.  Or maybe it means that they don&#39;t do any formal &quot;preschool&quot; <br/>
stuff with the kid, like a lot of people do.  Maybe the family is just <br/>
living their lives with their kids, just like they are going to when the <br/>
child reaches the magic age of compulsory education.  In states where the <br/>
magic age is 7, for instance, do families not call it unschooling until then?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What if every parent who intended to and did send a child to kindergarten at<br/>
&gt;5 said &quot;up until that time, we were unschoolers, but now it&#39;s time for him to<br/>
&gt;go to school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But why would people do that?  I can see a few families changing their <br/>
minds during those years, but most don&#39;t.  If they are planning to <br/>
unschool, most of them do.  Actually, it can be useful for some people to <br/>
start noticing all the learning that goes on during the &quot;preschool&quot; <br/>
years.  Then they&#39;re less like to start panicking when their kid doesn&#39;t <br/>
happen to learn something that his friends are learning at school.<br/>
<br/>
I could see making the distinction if people were going to be doing <br/>
something very different with their kids once they were school age, but we <br/>
didn&#39;t do anything different with Lars when he turned 5, and neither did my <br/>
daughter with my granddaughter.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything magic about <br/>
school age, at least to us types.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
How about she&#39;s just a 3 year old? I&#39;m being serious and you brought up a <br/>
good point. We use the term unschooling because it&#39;s sort of well known, but <br/>
lots of us wish we weren&#39;t defining our learning in terms of school at all.<br/>
<br/>
The terms unschooler, pre-unschooler and such are helpful for parents who <br/>
are stressed about moving away from the school frame of mind. If everyone <br/>
they know is sending their kids to school or pre-school, then defining what <br/>
they&#39;re doing as unschooling helps alleviate some of those society-induced <br/>
fears about learning.<br/>
<br/>
But you are so right, there is really no difference between learning at 3 <br/>
and learning at 7 and learning at 16. The stuff they learn may be different <br/>
stuff, but it&#39;s all along the life continuum. There needs to be no break <br/>
where you say &quot;Now I am an unschooler.&quot; It&#39;s all life and it all counts.<br/>
<br/>
BTW it is so cool to see so many parents here who have such little kids. It <br/>
gives me chills to think of all those precious little beings who wil never <br/>
have to be forced into schooling. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

at home? Maybe not. Okay probably not. LOL But I still think a parent who <br/>
has chosen to unschool when the child is 3 is an unschooling parent in an <br/>
unschooling family. There&#39;s a change of attitude that comes with recognizing <br/>
the value in that unschooling label and lifestyle.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know her best, of course, but I&#39;ve found that with older people, you <br/>
can relate it to things they&#39;ve spent their lifetime learning, and they <br/>
get it much faster (than people who currently have children in <br/>
school-for sure).  It helps if they&#39;re not steeped in east coast <br/>
academia, too.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother, who will be 97 this year, is the ultimate unschooler&#39;s <br/>
example. An active woman all her days who was always attempting to learn <br/>
some new skill--guitar, roofing, new ways to garden.  That&#39;s what I <br/>
remember about her just when I was a teenager--and she was in her 70s <br/>
then, and I&#39;ve heard lots of stories of her attempts and victories.  (I <br/>
almost said she &quot;was&quot; the ultimate example, since Alzheimer&#39;s has now <br/>
claimed most of her memory--but then my uncle was telling me last week <br/>
about how she was interested in how the electric seats work in his new <br/>
car--STILL learning something!)<br/>
<br/>
My dad, thankfully, lives by her example, and he completely *got* <br/>
unschooling without me even trying.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some old people are stodgy and hard to get along with.  I <br/>
just try to let them talk about their medical conditions.  ;)<br/>

But I wouldn&#39;t say my 3 year old is an unschooler.  There is no <br/>

There is &quot;un-ing&quot; for me, in my thoughts and perceptions (still...) <br/>

themselves even with the world around them telling them things aren&#39;t <br/>

Good point.  I see the difference as being one of intent.  For example, my <br/>
attitudes, expectations, and treatment of my child&#39;s activities are <br/>
different than those of my parents and other family members.  They think <br/>
that her abilities will cause to be advanced &quot;once she gets into school&quot;, <br/>
while I think her abilities are a natural occurrence.  Also, it takes time <br/>
for us to &quot;unschool&quot; ourselves!<br/>

<br/>
I just picked up whatever I could find and tried it, and soon learned to tell <br/>
by looking whether I&#39;d be able to play it or not, which was the beginnings of <br/>
reading music without an instrument in my hands, which many musicians can&#39;t <br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; (BTW, the other day, <br/>
someone asked her about school and she says, &quot;I do homeschool&quot;!) :)<br/>
I agree, it is neat to see that so many kids are not being introduced to <br/>
school at all.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was six or seven and Marty wasn&#39;t &quot;school-age yet,&quot; we thought <br/>
maybe Marty would want to go to school, because much of his life has been <br/>
doing the opposite of what Kirby had done.  I remember we were in a grocery <br/>
store and someone said something to Kirby about not being in school and MARTY <br/>
chirped up &quot;We&#39;re homeschooled!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh!  <br/>
<br/>
That was the first indication I&#39;d ever had that he was into the idea himself.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t asked for a few years, but the first several years I&#39;d always ask <br/>
each child if he or she wanted to go to school that year or stay home.  Holly <br/>
was thinking about school one year, but when she visited the playground and <br/>
saw that kindergarten kids never mixed with first and second graders (which <br/>
her friends/neighbors were) she decided against it.  <br/>

the bottom, etc. while her friend does not do these things, and when I asked <br/>
her mom why, she said, &quot;they&#39;re not expected to do that in her swimming <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m often asked where Casey took swimming lessons. Parents seem to have a <br/>
hard time blieving that she learned to swim by going with me to the pool and <br/>
being in the water. It&#39;s odd how things have turned around so. My parents <br/>
would never have thought to put me in swim lessons. That was what my older <br/>
brothers were there for, to show me how to swim. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
OTOH at least Serena&#39;s friend doesn&#39;t have a mom who is worried that she&#39;s <br/>
not swimming yet and putting her in remedial swimming. Or worse yet, forcing <br/>
her to go underwater before she&#39;s ready.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m thinking 9 is a good age for swimming lessons :-) Rain already knew how to dog paddle around, and float, and have tea parties on the bottom of the pool, and stuff like that, just from being in the water all the time... but she wanted to learn to swim actual strokes, and I wasn&#39;t doing very well at showing her (maybe because I&#39;m not very good at it). So she&#39;s been having private lessons with an 18 yr old former hser and current college sophomore, and it&#39;s been wonderful. They talk about what she wants to learn, he knows swimming inside and out and can break every skill down into the tiniest parts, if need be. He knows all sorts of little tricks to help her refine the techniques. She enjoys it a lot, and he&#39;s talked about how much faster she learns than the 5 yr olds he teaches - probably mostly because she&#39;s not 5. <br/>
<br/>
I also think she would have been fine paddling around the rest  of her life, she didn&#39;t *need* to know the freestyle and the backstroke and the breastroke. But she wanted to, and I didn&#39;t know them all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of signing her up for singing lessons for the same reason- she wants to know stuff that I don&#39;t know (she told me I sing alto, which was news to me) and learning something like that from an actual person sounds much easier than trying to do it from a book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565510340">I asked my 9 year old daughter if she wanted to go to school this <br/>
year.  She has been kind of bummed out lately that she doesn&#39;t have <br/>
enough friends.  She thought about it and came to the conclusion that <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be worth it because too much of her time would be wasted <br/>
doing what the teachers wanted her to do. <br/>
<br/>
So instead, I&#39;ve been making friends a focus.  We&#39;ve been inviting <br/>
different girls over a lot and I think we&#39;re going to start a girl <br/>
scout troop.  My plan is to make it THEIR troop.  They can get <br/>
together and do what they want in their troop, down to picking what <br/>
crafts, activities, and trips they want to do.  My only agenda will <br/>
be to give them freedom to have fun together and be themselves.<br/>

I shuddered reading that!<br/>

This interesting because in our house it&#39;s just the opposite.  Robin&#39;s<br/>
friends can all swim with their heads under the water, but he can&#39;t.<br/>
Their parents say it&#39;s due to swimming lessons.  I say (and so does<br/>
Robin) that he will get it when he&#39;s ready to swim.  He says that right<br/>
now he just likes to be in the water.  Ditto for my daughter.<br/>

took several years of gymnasics that way at about half the regular <br/>

none of the coaches could safely spot him anymore.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481781695">I agree that it&#39;s sort of a nonsense term, but there is some market for <br/>
people with an unschooling bent to be able to talk about matters <br/>

and other unschooling forums, I&#39;ve also seen people attacked more than <br/>
once for asking questions or expressing concerns relating to younger kids.<br/>

:-) Diane (NOT Bill!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I saw this term pop up in the diapers/babies discussion, and it struck me <br/>
&gt;as a meaningless word.  I&#39;m not trying to be offensive, but If you think <br/>
&gt;about it, when is a child at a &quot;pre&quot; unschooling stage?  It&#39;s rather like <br/>
&gt;&quot;learning to X&quot; as opposed to &quot;doing X&quot;    At what point do you cross <br/>
&gt;over?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a 3yo daughter, and although she would be considered a <br/>
&gt;&quot;preschooler&quot; in the world at large, I consider that she is already an <br/>
&gt;unschooler, not a &quot;pre-unschooler&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This may seem like a small nit, but I think it&#39;s an important one.<br/>

I was just thinking about turning the phrase around. Instead of <br/>
PRE-unschooling, the idea is really better suited as UN-preschooling. Like <br/>
Ned said, it&#39;s anything BUT school. It&#39;s anything BUT sending off 3 year <br/>
olds to do school type work.<br/>
