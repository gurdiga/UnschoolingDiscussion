<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084202710">-=-I think i am going to the other extreme with my purse. My mother&#39; was<br/>
totally forbidden to even touch.My husband will not let me touch his<br/>
wallet. I wanted to be open with Lukas about it but seems to be not  <br/>
such a good idea,right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have few thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Even if everybody on this list unanimously said &quot;good idea&quot; or &quot;bad  <br/>
idea,&quot; that wouldn&#39;t make it so.  Needing other people&#39;s approval  <br/>
isn&#39;t good.<br/>
<br/>
If I think he shouldn&#39;t be digging through your purse, WHY do I think  <br/>
that?  Maybe that&#39;s what you could be thinking.  Why did your mom not  <br/>
want people in hers?  Why does your husband not want you in his?   <br/>
Maybe his mom used to get into it.  Maybe they&#39;re going along with  <br/>
the tradition of having one little private place.  It IS a tradition,  <br/>
that wallets aren&#39;t dug through.  If you go to prison, they go  <br/>
through your wallet.  If you&#39;re in a car wreck, someone will look at  <br/>
the ID, but they won&#39;t go through every movie stub and family photo.<br/>
<br/>
To live in reaction to one&#39;s mom&#39;s rules is still letting the mom  <br/>
control the situation.  It&#39;s still being a child.<br/>
<br/>
To want to allow one&#39;s child to not only get into one&#39;s purse but  <br/>
pull things out (the money out!) in front of one&#39;s mom, at the mom&#39;s  <br/>
house, seems to me to be (potentially) a passive aggressive show of  <br/>
defiance and rejection.   You probably didn&#39;t mean to use your son to  <br/>
get back at your mom, but just from the account of it, it seems like  <br/>
a slight-to-probable possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, what is your son learning?  Will he think it&#39;s just cool  <br/>
to go into anyone else&#39;s purse?  Because I can tell you for sure,  <br/>
it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t look in my sons&#39; wallets.  I don&#39;t look in Holly&#39;s purse.   <br/>
Sometimes they&#39;ve told me something was in there and I could get it  <br/>
(a key, or my own debit card or something) and so I know they&#39;re very  <br/>
organized, like their dad, and that&#39;s cool to see, but it&#39;s a place  <br/>
I&#39;m very occasionally privileged to go, not something that&#39;s my right  <br/>
(socially; whether legally or not, I don&#39;t care).<br/>

<br/>
A quote from that:  &quot;My favorite &quot;new rule&quot; has always been that  <br/>
learning comes first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When deciding what to advise your son to do, or how to explain things  <br/>
to him, it IS extreme (&quot;I think i am going to the other extreme&quot;) to  <br/>
choose to do the opposite of what your mom did.<br/>
<br/>
We had rules at the table when I was a kid.  I didn&#39;t adopt all of  <br/>
them, but I considered each one, as my kids got older, and picked up  <br/>
a few other ideas as Keith and I mingled our own families&#39; traditions  <br/>
and our own quirks.  My dad never walked around without a shirt on.   <br/>
Keith has sat down at the table without a shirt.  Not cool, said I.   <br/>
Please put a shirt on.  He doesn&#39;t like for someone to read at the  <br/>
table, so I don&#39;t read if he&#39;s there.  If I&#39;m sitting all by myself,  <br/>
I do.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said &quot;No singing at the table,&quot; and she was serious.  We might  <br/>
choke.  She didn&#39;t want us goofing around.  My kids aren&#39;t told not  <br/>
to sing, but they chew with their mouths closed, and they have some  <br/>
more-formal and less-formal table knowledge, which is useful for when  <br/>
they go to fancy restaurants.  They don&#39;t embarrass themselves at  <br/>
other people&#39;s houses (or not much, I hope).<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness and real thought require more than deciding to do as our  <br/>
parents did or to do the opposite.  Neither of those is balance and  <br/>
choice.<br/>
