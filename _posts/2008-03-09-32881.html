<br/>
She had a good description of distraction.  My response, and some  <br/>
expansion:<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It is not a bad thing to distract an angry child.  My children are  <br/>
good evidence of that.  Their relationships are good evidence of  <br/>
that.  Those people who, over the years, have assured whole lists  <br/>
that I was wrong and manipulative, where are their children?  Do  <br/>
people even remember who they were?<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was nine, I was just about the only person writing about  <br/>
unschooling online, and I got some criticism, and someone said &quot;You  <br/>
can ignore her; her oldest child is nine.&quot;  I didn&#39;t defend myself  <br/>
then with details of having had custody of three relatives before  <br/>
(from two different families), nor of having taught Jr. High for  <br/>
years, nor of having been very analytical about how much of my own  <br/>
learning happened outside of school, or inside school but outside  <br/>
their plans for my learning.  I just sucked it up.<br/>
<br/>
But this is important:  I was telling stories about what was working  <br/>
with Kirby and Marty.  I was sharing personal successes.  I was  <br/>
reminding people what John Holt had discovered in his observations  <br/>
(or telling them for the first time usually).  I wasn&#39;t saying &quot;I  <br/>
know it all.&quot;  My kids all agreed early, and continue to support, my  <br/>
sharing their lives in enough detail that others can see how it can  <br/>
work in the long term.<br/>
<br/>
I still distract them when they&#39;re frustrated, and they&#39;re  <br/>
practically grown (or grown) at 16, 19 and 21.  If Holly is wound up  <br/>
tightly and is about to say or do something regrettable, I&#39;ll ask her  <br/>
to come and help me carry laundry, or unload the dishwasher (WITH me,  <br/>
not by herself), and I get her away from other people and she can  <br/>
vent a bit, and I remind her of something good and right about the  <br/>
situation, or remind her she has the power to make it better or  <br/>
worse, and that&#39;s about all the reminding she needs now.    This is  <br/>
built on years of other such incidents when she needed more  <br/>
aggressive saving from herself.<br/>
<br/>
When a child is furious or violent, it hurts him too.  When a child  <br/>
hits, it makes him a child who hits.  Parents shouldn&#39;t partner up  <br/>
with that, but should support their child&#39;s being a thoughtful,  <br/>
aware, careful person.  If it&#39;s too soon for the child to be  <br/>
thoughtful or careful, then the parent can prevent him from doing  <br/>
damage by getting him out and involved with something else while he&#39;s  <br/>
calming down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680087554">Thanks for this topic. A friend of mine argues that kids need to be  <br/>
able to work through situations. She is especially referring to my  <br/>
kid, who is highly sensitive and not &quot;easy going&quot; like her kids.<br/>
I don&#39;t agree, especially when, in the heat of the moment, my child  <br/>
is not able to &quot;work through&quot; much on a rational level. I also think  <br/>
5, or even 7 (the age of her oldest) is too young to place this  <br/>
expectation upon. It was comforting to hear how you use distraction  <br/>
with your teen age daughter. As adults, we often use distraction,  <br/>
when needed. It frustrates me when parents put different expectations  <br/>
upon kids then they would for adults.<br/>
Blabbering now.<br/>

Ooh!  I just posted this on another list:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Aptitude and desire are WAY more important than training.  There  <br/>
are a few things people get in college that help, and I recommend  <br/>
them to unschooling parents.  Know about child development (google  <br/>
Piaget stages and read for twenty minutes, maybe, if it&#39;s new to you-- <br/>
don&#39;t take a whole college course).  Know what Maslow said about the  <br/>
hierarchy of needs.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Here it is in context (not important to this discussion, so skip it  <br/>
anyone who&#39;s fond of staying on topic!)<br/>
<br/>
I was responding to/backing up that first quote.<br/>
<br/>
==============================================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-... This in no way means that I think it is perfectly okay to be  <br/>
uncertified. Schools do what they can do to serve the kids, as do  <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-There are poorly trained and bad teachers unfortunately, certified  <br/>
and<br/>
uncertified, as in any profession.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I was a certified teacher, and I wasn&#39;t &quot;trained&quot; to teach.  We read  <br/>
lots of research summaries and books by the school reformers of the  <br/>
late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s.  I was trained not to trust traditional  <br/>
schooling.  Then I was put into a traditional school.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt wasn&#39;t a certified teacher.  I taught with some certified  <br/>
teachers who should never have been teachers.<br/>

hierarchy of needs.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen my son Kirby &quot;teach.&quot;  I&#39;ve seen him run tournaments at a  <br/>
gaming store, where he worked from the ages of 14 to  18 or 19.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
seen him teach beginning karate lessons.  I&#39;ve seen him demonstrate  <br/>
games (as have some who were at the HSC conference when he did  <br/>
gaming).  He has an ease, a compassion, a clarity and a natural  <br/>
understanding of what the people need to know to advance happily.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen my husband teach people to do knotwork, in the SCA and at a  <br/>
homeschooling conference.  He&#39;s more longwinded than Kirby, but he&#39;s  <br/>
methodical and clear and good at assisting when people are having a  <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them is a trained teacher, and Kirby had never seen &quot;real  <br/>
teachers&quot; (except his karate teacher, one dance teacher he didn&#39;t  <br/>
like and an art teacher he loved, when he was very young).<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about California or certification.  It&#39;s a little about  <br/>
private schools.  Last I knew in my state, some percentage of the  <br/>
teachers had to be &quot;real certified teacher&quot; in private schools, but  <br/>
not all of them (that had to do with certifications--so kids could  <br/>
transfer to another school and &quot;keep credits&quot;).   But often the best  <br/>
teachers are those who simply really want to be there, who wake up in  <br/>
the morning glad about where they&#39;re going, and not those (certified  <br/>
or not) who are miserable and resentful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Same with parenting!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165924842">I wanted to say that when my boys were younger--say 5 and under--I used little finger puppets ALL the time to help diffuse conflict, whining etc.  I made sure one was with me when we left the house, as this was when little ones mostly needed a distraction from themselves or the boring but necessary event (grocery store ring a bell??).  Shopping, I would have one on my finger and it would be using its own, very unique voice to talk to the boys, and the kids each had their own 2-3 favorite ones that became a bit like friends to them.  These finger puppets didn&#39;t have MY point of view of things....they had theirs.  Sometimes it was Rosie the Giraffe&#39;s--who had a long history all of her own that she shared with the boys.  Rosie showed up in their easter saucers--filled with wheatgrass all tall and towering at her neck.  She had a little story that I read about how her mother wanted her to visit a family of humans and have a very special friend, that she was an &quot;only&quot; giraffe, and the mom thought that (my son inparticular) would be the greatest person to learn from and play with.  They just accepted along the way, that I could interpret for her perhaps...I do this with the family car too.  &quot;Sally&quot;---- she has her own voice and concerns and needs and DISTRATIONS when we are in the car and all things aren&#39;t going so well!  I avoided a lot of whining, perhaps even tantrums...I don&#39;t really know what I avoided, as I rarely ever experienced anything negative from the kids, because when in need, I kept them distracted!!  With story, funny observations (from the point of view of a giraffe or dragon) and just love!  And because it wasn&#39;t MOM saying something to them, they always listened up!  They were never scolded or reminded of manners or &quot;how to behave&quot;---just distracted.  It was awesome!  Now I just need something like that with my 13 year old again and we would be off on a new footing!<br/>
<br/>
I will say that I realize I was much better at parenting in general when they were under 7.  At the 8-9 year change, it has been really hard for me to not place more emphasis on what I think they SHOULD be or OUGHT to be or COULD be doing, thinking, experiencing!  It is much more challenging for me to redirect and distract MYSELF now than it ever was to redirect them!    That&#39;s why I am here, every day trying to learn from the &quot;pros&quot; about territory that I have not lived yet.  <br/>

Oh, good point!  I have several times in the past year or so thought  <br/>
of what I ought to say, and then thought I should actually go  <br/>
downstairs or outside or for a walk to the grocery store, and if it  <br/>
still felt like a good thing to say when I got back, the people would  <br/>
still be there.<br/>
<br/>
I never leave dramatically (in a cloud of &quot;huff&quot;) or anything.   <br/>
Nobody knows I extricated myself. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids do really well at solving their own problems (and helping  <br/>
their friends with theirs, lots of times) and they really don&#39;t need  <br/>
me as they used to.  That&#39;s pretty wonderful.  Some of the tools  <br/>
we&#39;ve used here to keep peace and joy have worked with them out and  <br/>
about with other groups of friends.<br/>

I find that the people are usually my family.  The biggest thing I  have done <br/>
to improve my relationship with my family since our years of  unschooling <br/>
began is to just keep my mouth shut.  Seriously,  we truly  have wonderful <br/>
relationships but there still are many days when something  surfaces that I choose <br/>
to deal with by not saying anything.  It works time  and time again.  It works <br/>
so well that it&#39;s my first choice in any  situation when I feel the slightest <br/>
bit annoyed by something or feeling  stressed.  I can&#39;t think of any time that <br/>
my saying something when I was  stressed has ever been beneficial.<br/>
 <br/>
This week we have relatives visiting from out of state and I got home from  a <br/>
few hours of work this morning with 2 kids asleep and one reading the  paper <br/>
on the couch.  Dishes from last night in the sink, laundry piled up  to fold, <br/>
plans to take the relatives to the beach, the dog needed to be fed and  for <br/>
some reason I just really wanted to have all the leaves blown off the front  <br/>
porch and walkway before the relatives arrived.  My issues,  really.  Everyone <br/>
was happy and I was so close to saying something that  would have ruined <br/>
everyone&#39;s day, including mine.  However, I made the  choice to go outside and clean <br/>
off the leaves and enjoy the beautiful day for  awhile rather than spewing out <br/>
something unpleasant.  A few minutes later,  the leaves were gone and I <br/>
walked back in to find 3 happy kids not at all aware  of any problems that I was <br/>
having.  We had the most lovely day because I  took the time to breathe a bit <br/>
and distance myself from a situation that really  was not worth being upset <br/>
about.<br/>
 <br/>
Tonight, the kids folded the clothes to make some room to play the new  Super <br/>
Smash Bros. Brawl that we bought while we were out, we ordered pizza and  <br/>
someone has cleaned the kitchen.  Truly amazing..&lt;g&gt; I can guarantee  that if I <br/>
had said something earlier that our day would not have been anywhere  near so <br/>
fun.<br/>
 <br/>
Years of practice doing this has made it second nature.  If I&#39;m  bothered by <br/>
something it is almost always something that I need to deal  with.  Not <br/>
something that anyone else is doing.  I&#39;m either tired,  hungry, or need to lighten <br/>
up a bit.  Years of helping them become aware of  how to deal with hunger, <br/>
tiredness and just general life stuff has led to a  home of children who are most <br/>
often happy and a mom who knows how to slip  outside for awhile and come back <br/>
to happy.<br/>

&gt; kid, who is highly sensitive and not &quot;easy going&quot; like her kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are soooo different, I almost had to reinvent how I parent.<br/>
What one child needs for distractions or working through tough<br/>
moments is so totally different than the other child.<br/>
<br/>
My older,13yo, daughter has her own techniques of working through her<br/>
frustrations.  I have no idea how it works in her own head, she&#39;s<br/>
never been able to articulate it to me.  I do know, that the less I<br/>
do, the better the situation is.<br/>
<br/>
A simple acceptance on my part of what she&#39;s going through, maybe a<br/>
suggestion or two, is about all I do, just something to let her know<br/>
that I&#39;m on her side and available to help her if she so chooses my<br/>
help.  Anything else is going to feel intrusive to her and cause her<br/>
frustration.  On the surface it may look like I&#39;m doing nothing, yet<br/>
I&#39;m totally tuned in to her in her time of need and I monitor the<br/>
situation from afar.  I do what I can, like keep her little sister<br/>
occupied and out of her space, find a cool song for her, make her a<br/>
nice little snack, bring her a drink, whatever seems appropriate.<br/>
For me, it&#39;s like bringing light and hope into her life in a time<br/>
that for her it appears somewhat dim.<br/>
<br/>
My other daughter, 6, NEEDS very involved physical distraction.  It&#39;s<br/>
not just her age, but her personality.  I have to be very proactive<br/>
in the whole situation.  Dropping the ball, on my part, could mean<br/>
prolonged agony for all parties involved.<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading on Sandra&#39;s site about how it takes more time when<br/>
the kids are younger <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto">http://sandradodd.com/howto</a>&gt;  , and progressively<br/>
less time or ratio of mom/kid time as the child gets older.  I find<br/>
this is definitely true for my relationship with my younger<br/>
daughter.  As she&#39;s gotten older, she can handle more and better,<br/>
situations that frustrate her, on her own, with less and less help<br/>
from me.<br/>
<br/>
