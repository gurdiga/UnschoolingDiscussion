<div id="ygrps-yiv-110102742">This is one of the many reasons that I&#39;m a garage<br/>
sale/thrift store fanatic! The majority of my dd&#39;s<br/>
toys are older 2nd hand stuff. She still has and plays<br/>
with some of my old FP stuff, dolls (and clothes for<br/>
them) that were mine, and doll house furniture that my<br/>
mom made for me. The only toys she&#39;s had that have<br/>
broken are modern ones that she&#39;s gotten! She even has<br/>
an original Tinkertoys set that I found at a garage<br/>
sale for $3. Now if only I could find a metal kitchen<br/>
set like I had (stove, sink and refrigerator)! I<br/>
played with that for years. I guess I&#39;ll just continue<br/>
with my plans to make her a wooden one, &#39;cause I<br/>
certainly can&#39;t afford to buy her one!<br/>
