Just this morning walking back from leaving my van in the shop I was thinking <br/>
about living with animals.  I saw pigeons and a prairie dog on the way back <br/>
and that was it.  I was thinking about some of the traditional architecture <br/>
in colder parts of Europe in the middle ages that involved animals living <br/>
under the people-part.  The animals generated some heat under the floor, the <br/>
people could still get in and out if the snow got really deep, but they must <br/>
have smelled the poop.  Then I came to read and find that some people like <br/>
that smell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802140670">In the U.S. many ranches did and still do build living quarters over the<br/>
stables.  Depending on the neatness :-} of the stable workers, there is<br/>
little if any smell in the apartments.<br/>
<br/>
You can see lots of examples of these barns in Kentucky and, in CA, in<br/>
Sonoma County where there is a world famous round barn and another in Wikiup<br/>
Estates.<br/>
<br/>
There is another one that is still in use in Mendocino County where<br/>
Seabisket lived and is buried.<br/>
<br/>
Also the rental stables in SF use to have one but I&#39;m not sure that they are<br/>
still running.  I think I heard that about 10-15 years ago they were torn<br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
My cousin who lived in Scotland for awhile lived in an old stone one there<br/>
and they kept the cattle under her apartment.  She said that it would get a<br/>
little smelly on warm days but that didn&#39;t happen often as they didn&#39;t get<br/>
many days that were all that warm &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722398281">I don&#39;t know how cattle would be in the NM/Arizona type climate but we have<br/>
friends that raise horses in Arizona.  I think the main thing is that with<br/>
horses the stalls are generally cleaned daily and sometimes twice daily for<br/>
show horses.  I&#39;m thinking that the old type open barn where cattle just<br/>
lounge would not be as pleasant, shall we say, to live above as the horse<br/>
stalls.  Cattle being, hmmm, how to say this without posting a tv type<br/>
warning of content &lt;g&gt;, more liquid and messier &lt;g&gt;  with what they leave<br/>
behind &lt;g&gt;  Sheep aren&#39;t that aromatic except during the winter (yuck, wet<br/>
wool).  And you can forget pigs.  I don&#39;t even want them up wind let alone<br/>
near my house %-{<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295073966">My father&#39;s surname was Speed (English) and his mother&#39;s maiden name was <br/>
Russell (French), both had come from San Antonio, Texas.  A few years ago my <br/>
best friend found a scrap book in an antique store.  It had belonged to a <br/>
teenaged girl attending a fairly elite private school in San Antonio during <br/>
the year of 1901.<br/>
<br/>
One of the pictures was of a girl with the last name of Speed.  A recital <br/>
program in the book listed two French teachers, sisters, with the last name <br/>
of Russell.<br/>
<br/>
It was astonishing to me that this book would make it&#39;s rounds into my hands. <br/>
 I&#39;m certain that all of these people are relations.  It was almost eerie.<br/>
