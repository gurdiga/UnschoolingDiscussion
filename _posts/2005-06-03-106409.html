&gt; That was before they had the DARE program, though, which keeps all <br/>
&gt; schoolkids off drugs.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was at the local elementary school the other day for a girl scout function<br/>
and there were these HUGE posters each class had made.  Each one had photos<br/>
of each kid  and artwork of various types on the theme &quot;born to be drug<br/>
free&quot;.  With little pledges that all these second and third graders werren&#39;t<br/>
