&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I are doing the Kamana Naturalist<br/>
Program (its a long distance/corespondence coursework)<br/>
through the Wilderness Awareness School(WAS).  My<br/>
husband wants to mentor people using skils we are<br/>
learning in WAS.  I want to use these skills and<br/>
extend them to Permaculture and more &quot;natural&quot; living.<br/>
<br/>
Check out their site a natureoutlet.com. The school<br/>
has several workshops all over the US. Some of the<br/>
workshops that would interest homeschoolers especially<br/>
unschoolers is the Art of Mentoring and Coyote<br/>
Mentoring. All of the programs would interest those<br/>
who want to undertand out earth better.<br/>
<br/>
The schools goal is to create a Stalking Wolf on every<br/>
corner. For anyone who doesn&#39;t know Stalking Wolf was<br/>
an Apache Indian who mentored Tom Brown who runs The<br/>
Tracker School in New Jersey.  Tom Brown mentored Jon<br/>
Young founder of the Wilderness Awareness School.<br/>
<br/>
My question would be: do you know the name of the<br/>
plant outside you fron door?  Could you describe it<br/>
now without going and looking at it? Does is shelter<br/>
any animals? Does it have flowers. The Kamana Program<br/>
is about helping us be more aware of our environment<br/>
our place in it and everything else.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Get out of your house walk on the land the trees are<br/>
all talking you can undertand.  The Mountains are<br/>
calling and the trees and the wind. The bear and the<br/>
deer are invinting you in&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Can you hear it that whispering sound. Through the<br/>
treetops and up from the ground. Listen oh Listen and<br/>
when you the magical earth calls out to you.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667747909">One thing I&#39;ve been trying to do for the world for many years is to spread<br/>
the word about biointensive gardening and the work of an organization called<br/>
Ecology Action. Many of you probably know all about biointensive already,<br/>
but for those who don&#39;t, the quick explanation is that through the use of<br/>
double digging and composting you can get huge yields from a very small<br/>
garden plot with little to no input from artificial fertilizers. Practiced<br/>
on a local scale, it can help solve worldwide food distribution problems, as<br/>
well as resource squandering and pollution problems arising from the<br/>
trucking and manufacture of petrochemical fertilizers and use of pesticides<br/>
and herbicides. It conserves and actually restore lost topsoil. It is very<br/>
water-conservative -- important given the water shortages looming in many<br/>
parts of the world. In my (admittedly very idealistic) opinion, it offers<br/>
one of the fundamental keys to world peace, because when everyone has a bit<br/>
of productive garden to tend resulting in enough food for their family and<br/>
community to eat, the motivation for territorial aggression goes way down.<br/>
<br/>
They have an impressive network of training workshops that operates<br/>
worldwide, and those they train are committed to teaching others. So that,<br/>
person by person, the word is spreading in Africa, Mexico, Russia, South<br/>
America, Asia.<br/>
<br/>
They need all the money they can get, and whenever I have a little spare<br/>
money, I make a donation. They have almost no overhead and use every penny<br/>
for the work.<br/>
<br/>
So, check them out at www.growbiointensive.org. Buy &quot;How to Grow More<br/>
Vegetables: Fruits, Nuts, Berries, Grains, and Other Crops&quot; (formerly titled<br/>
&quot;How To Grow More Vegetables on Less Land Than You Ever Though Possible&quot;) by<br/>
John Jeavons. (Amazon has it.) Make a donation. (Once you join, you get a<br/>
great newletter a few times a year.)<br/>
<br/>
One of these days I&#39;ll write to Warren Buffet and Bill Gates and urge them<br/>
to support this organization. In the meantime, I have you guys to nag -- and<br/>
to think I only just joined this list. Oh, the cheek of me. Sorry -- I just<br/>
really, really believe in what Ecology Action does.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, we also homeschool, drive as little as possible, don&#39;t expose our<br/>
kids or ourselves to commercial advertising, buy and grow organic, don&#39;t buy<br/>
or eat packaged, processed food, and try to spread love and kindness with<br/>
every though, word and deed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening! Best wishes to everyone,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Hmmm.  I guess my latest tiny contribution to the<br/>

&gt; instead of poisoning the snails & slugs, I&#39;ve been<br/>

still had a garden :( You can also put out bowls of<br/>
beer and slugs and snails are attracted to it.  A<br/>
friend of mine thought if you&#39;re gonna die it could be<br/>
a pleasant way to go;)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a funny snail story. Dd when 2yrs got a puzzle<br/>
with things in the garden that had snail in it.  She<br/>
would put the snail peice on the floor and stomp on it<br/>
when she was working on the puzzle. <br/>

You might contact Ya-Ka-Ama Indian Education Center in Sonoma County and<br/>
Freshwater Farms up here.  They both specialize in native plants and don&#39;t<br/>
remove them from the wild.  They collect seeds and start all their own or,<br/>
in some cases, do air grafting or collect suckers.  Both have worked at<br/>
bringing back some really endangered plants and have also done plantings on<br/>
the land swaps to return areas to natural plants.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for posting this!  One of the columnists for the Newshour did an<br/>
&gt; essay on something similar - how we lose sight of the poor in this season<br/>
&gt; of excess.  The visual at the end was stunning in its poignancy.  She had<br/>
&gt; all these images of excess (furs, yachts, etc.) and in the upper center<br/>
&gt; outlined by a strand of pearls was the face of a small African child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So what am I doing for the world : I am homeschooling my children, I am<br/>
&gt; working on recycling more, simplifying more, consuming less, composting<br/>
&gt; more, using organic products and planting more plants.  I am particularly<br/>
&gt; interested in getting some rare (endangered) native CA plants to put on<br/>
&gt; my land.  I know a native plant nursery which sells them so I won&#39;t take<br/>
&gt; something from the wild! I am working on being a good steward for the l<br/>
&gt; and where I now live - I have 12 acres of redwoods, live oaks, madrones,<br/>
&gt; and lately lots of mushrooms! Spiritually I am working on developing<br/>
&gt; more compassion and in May I have tickets to see/hear the Dalai Lama<br/>
&gt; teach.  I hope from that to learn what more I can do to heal the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW Sonoma State University (part of the California State University<br/>
system)<br/>
&gt; used to publish a report of the ten most under-reported news stories of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; year.  It was a project that a journalism professor did every year.  There<br/>
&gt; were some surprising stories on it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439825473">This one is fun &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is well after 10 p.m. and I&#39;m upstairs and not cheating &lt;g&gt;  Outside the<br/>
front door is a sword fern.  It stands about four feet tall and has rather<br/>
hardy looking fronds.  It doesn&#39;t flower, however, a frog jump to the south<br/>
are native Columbines which do flower.  Under the sword fern we have lots of<br/>
bugs, an occasional mouse (cats don&#39;t allow too many of them or maybe they<br/>
are just smart and go next door &lt;g&gt;), and on occasion a tree frog (they<br/>
sometimes seem to get confused about where they belong).<br/>
<br/>
A few jumps to the south east we have a large holly tree and it is covered<br/>
with red berries.  The sparrows and robins love it!  Of course, right now<br/>
the robins are busy getting drunk off the pyracantha in the backyard.  Up<br/>
here the fuschia are still blooming (even after this miserable frost we have<br/>
been having) and the Anna&#39;s still flit about under my kitchen window.<br/>
<br/>
We are all nature and animal nuts here.  Even living in the city, we still<br/>
see plenty of deer, raccoons, every once in awhile a yucky skunk &lt;g&gt; and<br/>
lots of birds.  A redtail hawk sits in the top of the tree outside the<br/>
window next to my computer.  About once or twice a year a bear wanders<br/>
through some part of the city (we have greenbelts that make it possible for<br/>
you to walk in wilderness from one side of town to the other).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731293798">Well, thanks, I guess.  But we&#39;re really not hsing for any altruistic reason. <br/>
 We started doing it because the school system around here stinks and it is <br/>
working and that&#39;s all the reason there is.  No big philosophy behind it.  No <br/>
thought that &quot;if only others would hs, the world would be a much better <br/>
place.&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027104792">My question would be: do you know the name of the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; plant outside you fron door?  Could you describe it<br/>
&gt; now without going and looking at it? Does is shelter<br/>
&gt; any animals? Does it have flowers. The Kamana Program<br/>
&gt; is about helping us be more aware of our environment<br/>
&gt; our place in it and everything else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are green plants outside my front door.  Some trees.  Some<br/>
bushes.  Many of them are different shades of green.  They have leaves.<br/>
Green leaves.  Sometimes one of them, the trees I think, have light<br/>
purplishish flowers.  Or maybe they&#39;re pink.  Sort of cone shaped.  No,<br/>
maybe not.  Cats take shelter there.  Neighborhood cats.  They were each<br/>
given a name by my husband.  They also have names given to them from the<br/>
people who feed them.  I can almost remember one of the names, it starts<br/>
with an M.  I&#39;ll get this later.  Anyway, there is always at least one<br/>
in the front yard when I open the door.  Unless they&#39;re all on top of my<br/>
car.  It&#39;s &quot;cashmere&quot; but it looks beige to me.<br/>
<br/>
Mandy.  No, Mindy.  No.  I know it&#39;s going to come to me.  I&#39;m no good<br/>
at this.  I&#39;m probably the least observant person you ever met.  But I<br/>
do have an incredible eye for what interests me.  I like the color<br/>
green.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659064475">This is a great topic! I&#39;m saving the digests with people&#39;s answers because<br/>
there is so much great info in there.This is something I think a lot about<br/>
at this time of year, because I try to make at least one New Year&#39;s<br/>
resolution that has to do with being a better steward of the planet. Last<br/>
year it was to cut down on my car driving by 50%, and I got a bicycle<br/>
trailer for the kids and dropped the average number of weekly miles I put on<br/>
my car by about 75%, using my bike for all trips under 6 or 7 miles (which<br/>
are the most polluting ones anyways because your car is firing up and<br/>
stopping). The year before it was to buy at least 50% organic. I&#39;ve found<br/>
that usually when I start at a &quot;doable&quot; level, I find myself working up from<br/>
there anyways as I find that it is not that hard to change. I agree with the<br/>
person who said that if we all just make incremental changes it can make an<br/>
enormous difference. I used to be involved in the &quot;Ecoteams&quot; project which<br/>
was exactly that idea - people would go through a 6 week class that focused<br/>
them on changing the things that make the *most* difference in areas like<br/>
energy, food, transportation, water, etc. and you committed to doing certain<br/>
activities in the workbook (like replacing your shower heads with low-flow<br/>
showers) or making certain changes (like turning off the faucet when you are<br/>
brushing your teeth, or carpooling once a week). They found that once a<br/>
person changes a habit for a few weeks, they have developed a new habit and<br/>
it usually sticks. People could set the level of commitment wherever they<br/>
were comfortable. Then, each ecoteam was supposed to go out and<br/>
recruit/spawn two more ecoteams in their neighborhood., thus it would grow<br/>
to a critical mass.You can find out more about ecoteams and starting them<br/>
at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.globalactionplan.org/.">http://www.globalactionplan.org/.</a> I really urge people to read this<br/>
website, it is a great program for instituting real change, household by<br/>
household!<br/>
<br/>
This year, my goal is to plant and tend my own organic garden. I can<br/>
sympathize with you Carol because I hardly got any gardening done last year<br/>
after my little girl started crawling! Before that I could set her in the<br/>
garden on a blanket, but after that it was chasing her and pulling rocks,<br/>
bugs, twigs, dirt out of her mouth. This year we&#39;re going to re-do and<br/>
terrace our backyard and put in a swingset. Hopefully she and her brother<br/>
can then entertain themselves while I get some gardening done! My son loves<br/>
to help me garden and this year we did manage to plant and harvest our own<br/>
Halloween pumpkins and pie pumpkins. Next year I hope to grow a much bigger<br/>
percentage of food. I&#39;m also trying to reclaim my knowledge of sustainable<br/>
practices, things like canning and sewing. This year I managed to can some<br/>
blackberry jam from our wild blackberries, next year I hope to put up some<br/>
of the food from our garden and reduce our dependence on food that is<br/>
trucked to us.<br/>
<br/>
Other things we try to do in our household are eliminate household chemicals<br/>
and bleach-containing products, eliminate buying bleached paper products,<br/>
reduce, re-use, recycle, use cloth diapers, breastfeed, eat whole foods,<br/>
reduce consumerism, etc. etc.<br/>

doing things with them for a number of years, and she has been doing the<br/>
Kamana program for over a year.  She also goes to the tracking club up in<br/>
Gold Bar (where are you located?)  and last summer she was part of the<br/>

&quot;entertaining&quot;.  As Friends, we don&#39;t celebrate a traditional Christmas. The<br/>
two girls and I went to the local hospital, and they went from room to room<br/>
playing Christmas carols (violin and flute), and rejoicing when we came to<br/>
empty rooms (meaning no one was stuck there for Christmas.)<br/>
<br/>
Then, last night we traveled to Seattle for our one family tradition -<br/>
singing and playing the entire Handel&#39;s Messiah with 500 folks at the<br/>
University Unitarian Church.<br/>
