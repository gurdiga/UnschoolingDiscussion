police when reaching for a wallet or carrying a candy bar, and been cleared <br/>
because they thought it was a gun. Actually, Michael Moore did a great piece <br/>
offering black people in NYC bright orange wallets to replace their black and <br/>
brown ones, so the police couldn&#39;t get confused. They also counselled people <br/>
on their candy bar choices. (Brown wrapped Hershey bar--dangerous...better a <br/>
Nestle Crunch with the Blue wrapper!)<br/>
