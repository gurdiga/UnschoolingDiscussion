-Photographer & stay-at-home-mom of &quot;C-C&quot;(dd=6) and &quot;Libby&quot; (dd=2)<br/>
-&quot;previous life&quot;: grew up in dysfunctional family (mother-dead; father/sperm <br/>
donor-estranged; one bro.-estranged for past 6 years; now trying to <br/>
re-establish contact, now that he&#39;s getting a divorce from a schizophrenic <br/>
who refuses to take her meds.<br/>
<br/>
dh-Dale, recently quit working for consulting firm in Indianapolis, now <br/>
independent contracting as software engineer (which will involve moving <br/>
every couple of yrs. or so)  His family is my family.  (MIL said: God forbid <br/>
something doesn&#39;t work out between you two, we&#39;re keeping Her...) &lt;GGG&gt; <br/>
She&#39;s also a psychologist.  (And, boy has it been true that sons marry there <br/>
mothers...)<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve lived in New Hampshire for almost 6 weeks, now; past 8 yrs lived in <br/>
Indy. ..still have house in Indy since dh contract could last from 6 mo to 2 <br/>
yrs--depending on how they like his work, they so far keep giving him more <br/>
projects.<br/>
Plus, Indiana &quot;laws&quot; are soooo easy, we&#39;re keeping residency there (NH <br/>
requires paperwork, testing....ICK)<br/>
<br/>
Family is quite supportive (lucky me!)  C-C is very physically oriented, a <br/>
tactile learner.  She would be diagnosed as ADHD, if we wanted her <br/>
labled...We&#39;ve unschooled them since birth: always at the library and on a <br/>
&quot;field trip&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
UH, what else...<br/>
I&#39;m re-educating myself-lousy ps experiences (teasing because of weight, <br/>
glasses, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I love this forum!<br/>
I love growing my children!<br/>
My live is soooo blessed!<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to all!<br/>
<br/>

    That is what I would do too!  Indiana laws are great for unschoolers!  I <br/>
would hate living where there was paperwork and testing.  You go girl!<br/>
