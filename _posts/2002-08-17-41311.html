&lt;&lt; And he simply couldn&#39;t get over that since defined Christian= to be like <br/>
 Christ. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Although I was raised in a fairly strict sect, my parents were fairly liberal <br/>
types (comparitavely).  I never knew we were any religion, because it wasn&#39;t <br/>
talked about....so one day I asked my Mom if we were Christian. <br/>
Her answer was &quot;I try to be&quot;.<br/>
I didn&#39;t fully appreciate that at the time, but I do now. She was striving <br/>
for a life that reflected Christ, not a set doctrine. Trying to be a <br/>
Christian is what mattered to her, not being a label. I&#39;m glad for her <br/>
attitude, although on other issues they were way too strict!!<br/>
