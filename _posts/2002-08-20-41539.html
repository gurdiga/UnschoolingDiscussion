&lt;&lt; Then we were asked to name our favorite Christian author and our favorite <br/>
Christian artist.<br/>
. . . .  Little did I know they meant MUSICAL <br/>
artist!!! &lt;G&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told this story before, but there are people here who weren&#39;t around <br/>
before!<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was seven or eight, maybe (?) there were homeschooling kids&#39; chats <br/>
on AOL and he wanted to be on one.  I was typing for him, he was speaking.   <br/>
<br/>
The question came up &quot;Who is your favorite singer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby thought hard.  He was very into voices--voice acting, ventriloquism, <br/>
singing.  He said &quot;Julie Andrews&quot; and I typed that and all around the others <br/>
in the chat were posting &quot;Amy Grant&quot;<br/>
&quot;Amy Grant&quot;<br/>
and Kirby said<br/>
&quot;and Michael Jackson&quot;<br/>
and the rest went <br/>
&quot;Amy Grant&quot;<br/>
and<br/>
&quot;Amy Grant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had no idea who Amy Grant was, but he wondered why they all named the <br/>
same person.  When I told him it might be the only one their parents were <br/>
letting them listen to he was so surprised!!!<br/>
<br/>
So here he was thinking it was an honest question about singing ability and <br/>
expression, and it was just girlie chit-chat about &quot;who do you think is <br/>
cool,&quot; and he wasn&#39;t much interested in those chats after that.<br/>
