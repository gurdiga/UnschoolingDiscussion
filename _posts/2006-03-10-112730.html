<div id="ygrps-yiv-582509458">Hi: I am a few-months-new member of this list. I&#39;ve been homeschooling my<br/>
daughters, who are almost-eight and ten years old for about 1.5 years.<br/>
Before that they were in public school, bored and unhappy. I&#39;ve never posted<br/>
on this list before, but always enjoy reading it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m writing to ask if any of you have read a book titled Ida B by Katherine<br/>
Hannigan, and if so, what you thought. I read the book because my older dd<br/>
and I are in a mother-daughter book discussion group run by our public<br/>
library, and it is this month&#39;s book. We are the only homeschoolers in the<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
The main character, Ida B, is homeschooled and then has to return to public<br/>
school when her mother becomes ill with cancer. Most of the story deals with<br/>
her adjusting to returning to public school.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves Ida B. She&#39;s getting a lot of mileage out of finding a<br/>
book featuring a child who is homeschooled and who is very imaginative. I<br/>
read it and was irritated. I&#39;m still trying to discern exactly why I feel so<br/>
grumpy whenever I think about the book. The titles it reminds us of are the<br/>
Junie B Jones books (which we love!) and Because of Winn Dixie.<br/>
<br/>
As the lone homeschoolers, I&#39;m also anticipating being put on the spot and<br/>
am trying to think ahead. I&#39;ve known the other book discussion group members<br/>
for a few years (we live in a small town) and they are a friendly bunch. I&#39;m<br/>
not expecting hostile questions, just uninformed ones.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara B</div>
