<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950656321">&lt;&lt;We also teach them about gun safety (we have 3 rifles and 2 1/2 <br/>
pistols (the third is a single shot black powder jobie we have no <br/>
ammo for, more a collector piece than anything) in our home.  All 4 <br/>
children will be getting their NRA memberships for Saturnalia.  We <br/>
will also enroll them in a gun safety class this summer (maybe <br/>
sooner).  The boys will not be getting a gun of their own until they <br/>
are a few years older.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a gun in our home, but gun safety is so important.  One<br/>
thought, I am &quot;paranoid&quot; about when our son goes to visit another child who<br/>
has a gun in the home, and was not taught safety or respect for guns.  I<br/>
told our son that if ANYONE ever takes out a gun in his presence, to say<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back!&quot;  and leave and come right home!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also showed him gun safety.  I&#39;ve told him stories about his<br/>
grandfather (who was a police officer), and about animals and gun safety<br/>
(my dad never believed in unloading his gun in front of our dog, as he knew<br/>
a fellow officer on the force whose dog jumped him when he unloaded his<br/>
gun, causing the gun to go off and kill someone).<br/>
<br/>
Our little one has great admiration for soldiers in the armed forces and at<br/>
a recent trip to a military &quot;museum&quot; that has active military ships<br/>
visiting, I pointed out to our son the children pointing guns at others,<br/>
and how wrong it was, and pointed out the soldiers and how they handled the<br/>
guns (always pointing them down when cocking, etc.)  That had a major<br/>
positive impact!<br/>
<br/>
For fire safety, we go every year to the open firehouse, and we visit the<br/>
firehouses.  We even began practice drills at home, should there ever be a<br/>
fire (stay low, don&#39;t open doors that are hot, etc.)  Being only 7,<br/>
Clifford the big red dog has a cute story, and it shows &quot;stop, drop and<br/>
roll&quot; (but, we learned a new one that I hadn&#39;t known, at an open firehouse,<br/>
to stop, cover the face, drop, and roll).<br/>
<br/>
Writing this has caused me to think about the local Red Cross.  I think<br/>
they have programs for children to take with their families, on safety and<br/>
emergency care.  I think I&#39;ll look into that for us :-).  <br/>
