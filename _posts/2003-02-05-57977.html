&lt;&lt; $300,000 ten years ago?  It&#39;s got to be worth at least a million now! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ouch. <br/>
Yeah, I wish we&#39;d had the money...it would have been a good investment. We <br/>
couldn&#39;t even afford a $100,000 house at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t they have a craft/art type festival in the summer down at the beach?<br/>
Glad  you&#39;re gonna post more!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Anyway, if you ever make back out here, feel free to call (we have an<br/>
 extra futon!). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to take you up on that one day.....keep us in mind too. The <br/>
water is much better for swimming in here in FL.<br/>
