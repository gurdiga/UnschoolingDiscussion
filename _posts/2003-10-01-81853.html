<br/>
Well damn!! Why didn&#39;t anyone tell  me this? I didn&#39;t know I could make decent money without being proficient in math.<br/>
Ok, sarcasm aside. You&#39;re parrotting stuff you&#39;ve been taught. It isn&#39;t even remotely true.<br/>
Tell my friend Koral that he needs math to make good money. His paintings sell for $10,000 a piece.<br/>
And he&#39;s only one example of many I could think of. We aren&#39;t all meant to be math geniuses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL, Ren!  THANK GOD you told me this!  Kidding aside, I want to finish my <br/>
degree in Special Ed (yea, I know, Homeschool the kid, and then go and teach in <br/>
brick & mortar), but my daughter is only one year away from finishing <br/>
homeschooling, and my first love is education, not only could I do the job I like, but <br/>
I could help other homeschoolers.  I started college when Kaycee was 2, she&#39;s <br/>
now 17, and I&#39;ve never finished.  WHY?  MATH!  I&#39;m just not a genius here <br/>
when it comes to Algebra.  So, I do great in the other classes, but when it comes <br/>
to Algebra, I just can&#39;t get it through this thick skull.  And, never being <br/>
great at math, I didn&#39;t take Algebra in HS; I got away w/basic & business math!<br/>
<br/>
After many failures, I&#39;ve finally discovered that I DON&#39;T NEED TO TAKE THE <br/>
HARDEST MATH classes in the world!  LOL, I&#39;m just going to do the math at a <br/>
community college; not the 4 year where the same damned class is harder!  Took me <br/>
3 tries to figure this one out.  My problem was that I *thought* I *had* to <br/>
take the hard classes to get a *good job*!  NOT!  NOBODY CARES as long as you <br/>
take the class and pass it!  My other problem WAS that I&#39;d be getting all &quot;A&quot;&#39;s <br/>
in EVERY OTHER class I&#39;d be taking until I took that first Math exam and get a <br/>
horrid grade on it.  I&#39;d get so discouraged that it would affect my other <br/>
classes!  Well, I&#39;ve got a fix for that one too!  I&#39;m ONLY going to take the MATH <br/>
classes; NO OTHER CLASS w/IT!  It may take longer that way, but, it CAN&#39;T <br/>
affect those other classes that I do so well at!<br/>
