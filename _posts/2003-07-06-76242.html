<br/>
If your son does want to go to school, would he have the option to stop<br/>
going anytime he decided home was a better place to be?  If he went to<br/>
school for 3 days and wanted to quit, would be that be okay with your<br/>
husband?<br/>
<br/>
And finally, if he doesn&#39;t want to go to school, or you don&#39;t feel he&#39;s<br/>
ready yet, why couldn&#39;t he wait until he&#39;s older?  School will still be<br/>
there, whenever he wants to try it out, if ever.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Teach Your Own, by John Holt?  (Or the new one edited by Pat<br/>
Farenga).  He talks about how school just isn&#39;t such a great learning<br/>
situation.  <br/>

<br/>
Although It&#39;s written about girls I can see my sons also dealing with<br/>
many of the issues mentioned in this book. This is why my children make<br/>
the choices they do, pick the friends they do, think the way they do.<br/>
This is why I think the way I do. It&#39;s like reading the posts on lists<br/>
like this one and thinking hey, I could totally relate. It all makes<br/>
sense, and it&#39;s good. <br/>
It&#39;s those unschooled girls I&#39;ve been wishing would move into the<br/>
neighborhood so my daughter doesn&#39;t have to feel so alone being<br/>
different, or at least be her support group in a book.<br/>
I so strongly believe everyone should read this book regardless of<br/>
whether they homeschool or not, if they&#39;re thinking about it or if<br/>
they&#39;re thinking about going to school, or if they don&#39;t even have<br/>
children, girls or boys. It&#39;s based on girls but it is about everyone in<br/>
our society. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991593547">I realize this discussion has been out there a while, but I just thought I <br/>
would add that my daughter, the perfectionist, had NIGHTMARES during <br/>
kindergarten about coloring outside the lines and using too much glue on <br/>
her projects.  I then found these comments written on her projects by her <br/>
teacher.  The teacher (a much older woman) and I came to a better <br/>
understanding very quickly there after!<br/>
<br/>
Childhood is often no picnic for the children!  Not when you&#39;re looking <br/>
from the inside out. Sometimes we don&#39;t realize just how much our kids are <br/>
affected about things we would never consider as having an impact on their <br/>
daily lives.  What we think of as &quot;fun&quot; may just be the opposite.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last december i needed immediate/emergency daytime care for my son. I <br/>
am a single parent, worked fulltime days at a job i couldnt really <br/>
bring him along too, and his father refused to change shifts to keep <br/>
him. My son at this point was refusing to go to school, and i would <br/>
have to take him into work with me after a half hour of tears trying <br/>
to get him to go into the school (his father would just bodily drag <br/>
him up the steps and dump him off in class)...what i did was post a <br/>
plea for temporary care on my local hs email list. I got several <br/>
responses offering to help. I found a really great mom with a boy my <br/>
son&#39;s age who was more than happy to have a playmate for her son. I <br/>
did pay her, although she said she didnt need me to. This allowed for <br/>
enough time for me to figure out a plan of action (in my case, <br/>
quitting my job and moving back in with family.)<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend your local HS email list or support group and <br/>
asking for help. Its not an ideal situation but will give you more <br/>
time until you can figure things out. Maybe find a job in which your <br/>
daughter can go with you, or maybe providing childcare in your home. <br/>
It was very frustrating at first for me because i couldnt find any <br/>
help, but joining the email group for my area was the key. I wish all <br/>
of us single homeschoolers could just move to the same area so we <br/>
could support one another!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>
