<div id="ygrps-yiv-156721106">&quot;But still at most every house he kept doing it but now<br/>
my husband (thinking he&#39;s helping the situation) is now repeating<br/>
all the suggestions I had made earlier, we just went around one<br/>
block and my son was exhausted and so we headed for the van. The<br/>
people were nice enough but I feel like my 7yo was really rude and<br/>
that he can&#39;t understand or follow simple polite directions.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds stressful.<br/>
Breathe deep and relinquish control...let go of the thought that you<br/>
need to make him act a certain way and just accept where he is right now. <br/>
I really doubt he upset anyone, Halloween is a bit crazy and people<br/>
understand. I think there were a LOT of directives given to a very<br/>
young person that can&#39;t remember all that coaching, and a LOT of<br/>
expectations on a night that should just be FUN.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if my child is incapable of acting appropriately, I am there<br/>
WITH him. If I deemed it really important to ring the doorbell just<br/>
once, or act a certain way, and I knew this child had difficulty with<br/>
it, I would hold the child, or hold his hand and do all the door<br/>
ringing FOR him. It&#39;s like expecting a baby to walk when they aren&#39;t<br/>
ready.<br/>
He just isn&#39;t ready to remember all that social etiquette.<br/>
And really, it wasn&#39;t important etiquette anyway.:)<br/>
<br/>
The fact that your dh was repeating things more and more often, is a<br/>
big clue that he couldn&#39;t handle the instructions...it was just a<br/>
bunch of stress for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
BE with your child. BE totally, fully present, doing for them the<br/>
things they can&#39;t/won&#39;t do until they&#39;re ready (though ringing the<br/>
doorbell a few times would be fun in my world.)<br/>
<br/>
I really think releasing your expectations and letting him be who he<br/>
is today will take a load off of you and your dh. It sounds to me like<br/>
everyone was a bit too focused on how this child &quot;should&quot; act, do you<br/>
think he felt a bit of pressure? Next time talk about cues he can give<br/>
you when he needs help, or the fun parts or something other than his<br/>
behavior. He&#39;s seven.<br/>
Seven years isn&#39;t a very long time to figure out all the ins and outs<br/>
of etiquette and social behavior. Let him be seven.<br/>

etiquette-lacking, rule-forgetting failure.    Negativity like that spoils Halloween and <br/>
home both.   Find the happy positive stuff and let him be a happy seven.<br/>
