&gt; about the hard realities of parenting for 24/7.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As some of you know, one of the things I do in my life is serve as a Director <br/>
of Religious Education at a Unitarian Universalist Church. One of my jobs is <br/>
to provide parenting religious education. Early on, I discovered that the most <br/>
important part is a place for parents to talk about those hard days where <br/>
you&#39;re sure you&#39;re screwing up, or you&#39;re not liking your kids much, or you&#39;re <br/>
just tired and scared. All the other stuff is good and useful, but that space <br/>
where we confess those things that we fear is ONLY us is vital.<br/>
<br/>
Anne Lamott wrote a book called &quot;Operating Instructions&quot; about being a single <br/>
parent of an infant, about the time I was parenting a wee one. My favorite <br/>
part of the book is where she says something like &quot;It&#39;s not working out. Sam is <br/>
going to have to go back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because I think every parent has felt like that, but we don&#39;t hear about it <br/>
often. I LOVED it when Sandra expressed her relief when her daughter started <br/>
reading pretty recently. Because this parenting stuff is scary anyway, and <br/>
unschooling is an enormous act of faith!   Intellectually, we know it works and <br/>
it&#39;s going to be okay, but sometimes we all get terrified. We also get tired, <br/>
impatient, jealous, exasperated, etc., etc. -- just like everyone else. Doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean we&#39;re bad people or bad parents. <br/>
<br/>
So...confess. I bet for every Bad Mommy or Daddy moment you share, there&#39;ll <br/>
be a dozen people who say &quot;Me too!&quot; and twenty more who can&#39;t say it out loud, <br/>
but are still relieved that it happened to someone else too.<br/>
