<div id="ygrps-yiv-121075323">Just thought I&#39;d let you know what we decided to do about the dental work for Michelle (I&#39;d posted about this some time ago.)  We went to a highly recommended dentist who has privileges at her local hospital to do general anaesthetic work.  <br/>
 <br/>
Now while I would not want to go to her on a regular basis (too cold and businesslike for me), Michelle likes her (especially the toys they have.) The work is apparently extensive, and the wait is shorter for the hospital in this city as opposed to Children&#39;s Hospital in Vancouver.  I also feel safer than in a clinic, plus the anaethesia is covered under my medical plan. <br/>
 <br/>
I plan to let her come with me in the future to watch how my appointments go, if she&#39;s willing.  I think I was so afraid of her picking up my fear of dentists, I didn&#39;t take her earlier on.  As it is, she&#39;s picked up on it anyway &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
She has been receptive to brushing more often - she now has a Scooby-Doo electric toothbrush which she picked out and she lets me do the brushing most of the time.  So she is getting comfortable with more &quot;hands in her mouth&quot; than before.<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh (though my first notion was to cry) at something this new dentist said to me, after she examined Michelle, had asked about what grade she was in and Michelle told her she homeschooled.  The dentist then equated tooth decay with homeschooling.  She said that being at home and having access to food whenever she wanted was a cause of her decay.  <br/>
 <br/>
She asked me what she drank and looked surprised when I told her Michelle preferred water and milk to anything sweet to drink.  I only thought later that I could have countered with &quot;homeschooled kids have more opportunity to brush their teeth than kids in school, who also eat throughout the day at two recess breaks and lunch with little time for dental hygiene.&quot;  But she had to latch on to some reason why, I guess.  Dentists wouldn&#39;t stay in business long if we didn&#39;t feel guilty for something we&#39;d done or not done.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your suggestions and thoughts.  I really appreciated them.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065747534">Those were my thoughts, too.  And really in our case, it&#39;s fear of dentists<br/>
and having her teeth touched or cleaned that is more of the problem.  I&#39;m<br/>
hoping that we can reduce the fear, and the dental health will follow.<br/>

What the hell is it with dentists?  They seem to think there are NO factors <br/>

They can&#39;t be that simple minded, really, and still have advanced degrees.  <br/>
What&#39;s the deal?  <br/>

Don&#39;t they believe in genetics, nutrition, general health, biochemical <br/>

too. Joe brought home some lovely bug for us all. Poor little Joseph got the <br/>
worst of it. After fever and sore throat it headed to his nose and now a <br/>
nasty cough. Sierra had fever and sore throat and the baby just fever <br/>
although I think her throat hurt a bit too. I&#39;m half getting it half not for <br/>
the past 3 days. The baby is the only one that was only sick a day. Tara is <br/>
immune. Tough kid. Poor Joseph is so sick of feeling like doing nothing he <br/>
wonders around the house just trying to figure out what he feels like doing. <br/>

We&#39;ve never used Flouride toothpaste and the area the kids grew up in England didn&#39;t have flouride in the water (Thankyou Pure water campaign!)<br/>
I accidenty let slip to our first American dentist these little facts. He spent ages with his pick pulling and poking hard at the kids teeth to find &#39;soft spots&#39;. Eventually Rhodri said &#39;are you trying to<br/>
make holes so you can earn money?&#39;. I&#39;ve never seen a dentist poke so hard with his pick. It pulled the kids heads around.<br/>
The dentist got a bit stroppy after that and said I misut have given the kids flouride cos he couldn&#39;t find any holes (kids are 10, 9 and 7) and its impossible to get to that age without cavities. I<br/>
pointed out that I&#39;m 34 and don&#39;t have any cavities either. I also told him that flouride is a neurotoxin and as I have MS I would never dream f using something that affects the nervous system.<br/>
We ain&#39;t going back to see that one.<br/>
