 have always understood this to be an appropriate way of continuing <br/>
 or commenting on an on-list discussion which has worn out its <br/>
 welcome on the list.  No doubt I&#39;ll be corrected if I&#39;m wrong, but I <br/>
 thought this was proper netiquette.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I thought so too.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe some people would rather be asked while the chat is on-list -- &quot;May <br/>
I continue this discussion with you privately off-list?&quot; -- rather than just <br/>
getting an email privately.<br/>
<br/>
Then they could accept or decline and not feel intruded upon.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But I thought I&#39;d say that while these were very <br/>
 strongly-felt topics I didn&#39;t perceive any specific bashing of anyone.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
well, i felt the same way... the only bashing i saw was someone&#39;s responses <br/>
that felt they were being bashed... lol... and i never perceived that they <br/>
were...</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211614486">dia and i have continued off-list and i felt it was a good move.  i <br/>
understand her position better now (though honestly i was not really <br/>
keeping up with the whole thing:)   to me she comes across as a <br/>
passion person making a sincere effort to do what is right for her <br/>
children - what more can one ask.  when one is sincere and honest a <br/>
child knows this and that, imo, builds a stronger foundation than any <br/>
externally movtivated reason simply because the parent is internally <br/>
motivated and true to themselves and their own beliefs.   <br/>
<br/>
judgments are a precarious thing like the vedics say poison can be <br/>
turned into nectar. something i know is possible because i feel that <br/>
due to my own abusive upbringing i possess a deep compassion for <br/>
others which, imo, is a good thing  - &#39;nectar from poison&#39;.  so who am <br/>
i to judge the choices of another w/out knowing the intricate details <br/>
of the given situation. <br/>
<br/>
i think - imo- the bottom-line problem, or perhaps the common ground, <br/>
is w/ parents who make choices, which are potentially harmful or <br/>
detrimental to the well being of their child(ren) when other choice <br/>
are available, and they do so with utter disregard for the consequence <br/>
of those choice - e.g. spanking as the first and only choice for <br/>
discipline; daycare used as a self-serving tool while disregarding <br/>
other possibilities - basic unconscious responses.  all choices -imo- <br/>
should be made consciously and deliberately with as full (as possible) <br/>
knowledge of the pros and cons - be those choices about working, <br/>
spanking, breastfeeding, vaccination .......... - these are personal <br/>
choices and are completely unique to each and every family and no <br/>
blanket right or wrong stance make sense - warning/knowledge of the <br/>
risks - yes,  blind judgement/disregard of the specifics -no. <br/>

tracy,<br/>
i agree with you that ot conversations that go on too long should be<br/>
continued off list. however, i think it&#39;s only appropriate if the person<br/>
sending the message extends an invite to the replier/s. if you feel like<br/>
you&#39;re being attacked by someone it&#39;s nice to be able to go off list to get<br/>
away. if people are &quot;following you home&quot; (not my words) you can&#39;t achieve<br/>
this. JMHO of course.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I think that if the message is an unwelcome one (ie: a debate one did not wish to continue, or some such) it can FEEL (intentions not withstanding) very much like one of those phone solicitors calling during your dinner hour when you have out of town guests:  Very irritating, inconvenient and inconsiderate. <br/>
