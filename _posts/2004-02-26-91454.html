<div id="ygrps-yiv-241908845">The Schoolboy, by William Blake<br/>
<br/>
I love to rise in a summer morn<br/>
When the birds sing on every tree;<br/>
The distant huntsman winds his horn,<br/>
And the skylark sings with me.<br/>
O! what sweet company!<br/>
<br/>
But to go to school on a summer morn,<br/>
O! it drives all joy away;<br/>
Under a cruel eye outworn,<br/>
The little ones spend the day<br/>
In sighing and dismay.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! then at times I drooping sit,<br/>
And spend many an anxious hour,<br/>
Nor in my book can I take delight,<br/>
Nor sit in learning&#39;s bower,<br/>
Worn thro&#39; with the dreary shower.<br/>
<br/>
How can the bird that is born for joy<br/>
Sit in a cage and sing?<br/>
How can a child, when fears annoy,<br/>
But droop his tender wing,<br/>
And forget his youthful spring?<br/>
<br/>
O! father and mother, if buds are nipped<br/>
And blossoms blown away,<br/>
And if the tender plants are stripped<br/>
Of their joy in the springing day,<br/>
By sorrow and care&#39;s dismay,<br/>
<br/>
How shall the summer arise in joy,<br/>
Or the summer&#39;s fruits appear?<br/>
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,<br/>
Or bless the mellowing year,<br/>
When the blasts of winter appear?</div>
