<div id="ygrps-yiv-826301713">Hi,<br/>
I have never heard of the on-line games that you were talking about <br/>
but I recently bought my sons (15,11,7) a Play station 2 game and <br/>
they absolutely love it !! So I recently went to a BJ&#39;s I don&#39;t know <br/>
what you guys carry for game stores in your area but I found a <br/>
STARTWARS STARFIGHTER game and they love it.  I also saw on the game <br/>
web site that they carry more that one starwars game.  <br/>
<br/>
I really like the video games because of the graphics and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
eat all your memory on the computer or tie up your phone line.  <br/>
Anyway, Just a thought possibly a christmas idea.  I really cannot <br/>
imagine life without video games my kids are never bored and it <br/>
stimulates their thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712616619">Hi Sonya,<br/>
I asked my son and he apparently has played or beaten nearly all of <br/>
the PS 2 Star Wars games.  He is ready for some interaction I guess.<br/>
We have a really cool library here that lets you get games out for 3 <br/>
weeks, renewable up to 3 times.  By the time you do that you can <br/>
beat them, can&#39;t you?  LOL.<br/>
Thanks though--he knew of the game you mentioned.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1350387378">My boys played one of those subscription online games for a while and really <br/>
enjoyed it for the first few months and later it wasn&#39;t worth $5 each a month <br/>
anymore so we let it go.  But I can see the attraction, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
that expensive.  Way cheaper than bowling or laser tag, by the hour (WAY <br/>
cheaper) and they&#39;re at home in their own rooms.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the name of the one they did, but it was a sword&#39;n&#39;sorcery <br/>
medieval thing with great art.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443623054">This is a $40-60 game and then a $15 subscription.  I don&#39;t mind the <br/>
money.<br/>
Did your boys get the game, read the rules and etc. and then sign up?<br/>
Is that how it is done?  I&#39;m really lost in the getting started mode.<br/>
