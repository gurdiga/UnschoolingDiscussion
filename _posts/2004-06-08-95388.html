<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277287379">I&#39;m wondering if anyone might give me suggestions on what to say/how <br/>
to react when dd (5yo) talks about school, and expresses a desire to <br/>
go?  Orion has been bringing up going away to &quot;the big school&quot; and <br/>
riding the school bus a lot recently.  I seems to be related to <br/>
seeing shows or reading books, etc. where she sees kids going off to <br/>
the wonderful place...and she wants to know when she will go.<br/>
<br/>
We have been responding by saying that some kids go away to school, <br/>
but some kids are homeschooled.  We have said that we believe that <br/>
kids learn all the time, and don&#39;t have to go away to school to <br/>
learn.  We have acknowledged why it seems she is interested, &quot;you <br/>
think it would be fun to ride the school bus&quot; or &quot;you think that it <br/>
will be fun because you might get to play with the other kids&quot;.  We <br/>
have casually explained that recess is only for a short time, and <br/>
that the rest of the time, she would have to sit very quietly in a <br/>
desk, and will not be allowed to talk much with the other kids.  We <br/>
have said that we would miss her, and that she would be gone most of <br/>
the day, and not able to be with the family doing fun things like <br/>
________.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight she said she wants &quot;to sit at a desk and listen to the <br/>
teacher tell her to write in her book&quot;.  I said I would be glad to do <br/>
that at home with her and she emphatically said &quot;NO&quot;.  I changed the <br/>
subject and told her that I have been thinking that it might be fun <br/>
for her to join a club called Girl Scouts...where she will meet with <br/>
other girls, and have a book to write in.  She was excited and happy <br/>
about that and dropped the school talk.<br/>
<br/>
How best to handle so she can feel right?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids say &quot;real&quot; school.  Ugh.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a GREAT topic and one I&#39;m sure lots of readers on this list <br/>
are dealing with or have.<br/>
<br/>
My kids go through stages wanting to know when they can go to &quot;real&quot; <br/>
school.  I&#39;ve tried explaining that what we are doing is REAL but <br/>
alas, they don&#39;t get that yet.  May not for a looooong time.  May <br/>
never....I just believe in what we are doing and trust that the <br/>
benefits will outweigh the losses (if there are any).    <br/>
<br/>
One of the best things is simply their friends and cousins.  We hear <br/>
horror stories all the time about ps.  They get to hear their <br/>
friends complain that they can&#39;t do all the cool stuff we get to do, <br/>
gripe about homework, watch them being grounded for bad grades, <br/>
etc.  So I think that in itself removes a lot of their desire.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter had a fit last year when she was so determined <br/>
that I told her her she was welcome to go.  After talking about it <br/>
for a few weeks and answering her questions she decided she didn&#39;t <br/>
really want to go.  From our talks, we figured out that she wanted <br/>
more friends and more structure so we talked about ways she could <br/>
acheive those things.  She signed up for some classes and clubs to <br/>
broaden her base of friends and she came to me one day with a <br/>
notebook that looked so much like a teacher&#39;s planbook that I could <br/>
have sworn she&#39;d stolen it from a classroom somewhere.  She even had <br/>
a M-F schedule, a place for grades, &#39;due dates&#39;; the works.  For <br/>
about 4 days she kept that thing up faithfully, asked me how to <br/>
calculate grades, even scheduled in her lunch and break times.  <br/>
<br/>
On the fifth day, she had assigned herself a paper on &quot;a non-fiction <br/>
topic of her choice&quot;.  She chose to write a story about how she <br/>
became interested in skateboarding.  The second week she had stopped <br/>
doing everything but her story writing and working in her Saxon math <br/>
book.  <br/>
<br/>
That was about 6 months ago, give or take a couple of months.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen her do any textbook work aside from the Saxon math <br/>
since.  Although she may pick something else up here and there, she <br/>
hasn&#39;t brought anything to me to see.  About once a month she brings <br/>
me her Saxon work and asks me if I&#39;ll &quot;kind of&quot; check it to see if <br/>
she&#39;s getting it right.  I don&#39;t grab red pens or write anything.  <br/>
If I notice she&#39;s missed 5 or more in a row, or so, and I can see <br/>
it&#39;s throwing her off, I&#39;ll point it out and she may or may not ask <br/>
me to help her out.  Usually she resolves it herself and I don&#39;t see <br/>
it for another few weeks or more.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the skateboarding story?  She&#39;s been writing on it ever <br/>
since.  It is now taken up two spiral notebooks and part of a third. <br/>
Once the spirals started falling apart, she decided to type it in <br/>
Word, which she had never used.  It took her a couple of days <br/>
goofing around in Word and using the help wizard guy and she was off <br/>
writing.  The grammar and spelling check irritated her so she <br/>
figured out how to turn those off.  (She told me she was tired of <br/>
seeing red and green lines everywhere. lol)  So far she has typed 24 <br/>
pages in Word in a size 11 font.  WOW!   Not only is she writing a <br/>
great story, but she has taught herself to use Word better than I <br/>
can, she types so fast it amazes me, she now uses the dictionary <br/>
while she writes (guess the spell check gave her the hint...I didn&#39;t <br/>
even have to fight my English-major urge) and has started <br/>
researching how to use graphics to illustrate and enhance it. The <br/>
Saxon has stayed on because she is working on ramp and half-pipe <br/>
plans alongside her story and needs the math to figure it all out.   <br/>
<br/>
I love that she hasn&#39;t erased all the spelling and grammar errors <br/>
yet.  I copy and save the story in a separate file under my name <br/>
because when she&#39;s done with it (if it ever will be done...it has <br/>
become an ongoing diary of her skating and it&#39;s offshoots) and has <br/>
made all her corrections, if she does, I want to be able to look at <br/>
it when I&#39;m 80 and get warm fuzzies remembering how this one story <br/>
sparked so many learning and growing adventures for her.  I think <br/>
one of the coolest things about it is how much *I* am learning and <br/>
learning about her just by reading it!  <br/>
<br/>
I think I got a little side-tracked here. :)  Basically, I think <br/>
once kids are truly allowed to follow their own paths, they will <br/>
realize how much more they get out of unschooling, they&#39;ll go to <br/>
school and decide they want to come back home, or they&#39;ll go and <br/>
want to stay (though I think that&#39;s unlikely if they are given a <br/>
rich environment to pursue their own dreams, fancies and <br/>
curiosities).  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get a lot of wonderful advice and other shared <br/>
moments that will inspire you and lead you to the right answers for <br/>
you and your family.  It wasn&#39;t easy for me to tell my daughter she <br/>
could go to school if she wanted to.  I have so many reasons why I <br/>
didn&#39;t want her to go (and I was practically carrying a bucket to <br/>
collect the sweat) but in the end, she fgured it out all by herself.<br/>
<br/>
We still have our days when she mentions wanting to go but as soon <br/>
as I say, OK, she is quick to tell me she doesn&#39;t REALLY want to and <br/>
then follows up with what is missing in life that she needs help or <br/>
ideas to fill.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a little tidbit from her story I just have to share.  This <br/>
makes all the heartache and nerve crushing disappear after 5 years <br/>
listening to her stages of wanting to go back to REAL school worth <br/>
it:<br/>
<br/>
   &quot;My mum pulled me out school when I was in the third grade and <br/>
started home schooling me. It was a good thing too, `cause if she <br/>
hadn&#39;t I probably wouldn&#39;t be where I am today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I cried the first time I read that.  Still do. &lt;b-teary-g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer<br/>
(Don&#39;t know why she writes MUM since we&#39;re from Texas but maybe it&#39;s <br/>
because we watch Degrassi and BBCAmerica all the time!  LOL  Goofy <br/>
kid!)</div>

experiencing. For a five year old, she is interested in tasting the experience (doubtful she <br/>
has a real understanding of the demands of being gone all day away from you).<br/>
<br/>
Can you give her an experience of school without going to public school? My kids got that <br/>
experience in Sunday school at church and that was enough for them to realize they <br/>
weren&#39;t really interested.<br/>
<br/>
We have also been a part of homeschool co-ops that offer a bit more school-like <br/>
structure.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, my daughter who was interested in school eventually did go to school part <br/>
time (this past year as a 14 year old). Her part time enrollment convinced her that she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to ever go fulltime and she has a much better appreciation for homeschooling <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Five years old is so young. It may be that you just have to hear and hold her feelings <br/>
without changing them (&quot;I can see why school is so interesting to you!&quot; and &quot;It must seem <br/>
odd that mommy went to school but you don&#39;t.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we want to change the feelings rather than just accept them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter Asa (almost 5) has done this off and on. There&#39;s an <br/>
elementary school that we bicycle past frequently and for awhile, she <br/>
used to say &quot;That&#39;s the girls school, where I&#39;m going to go when I&#39;m <br/>
6, with all the other girls.&quot; I don&#39;t know where she got the idea of <br/>
a girl&#39;s school - Madeline maybe? But she was adamant about it. We&#39;ve <br/>
discussed it off and on in the past couple of years, just answering <br/>
her questions about school and what she could realistically expect if <br/>
she went. The desire to go has definitely waned. I think a large part <br/>
of that was becoming part of an active homeschooling group. Now the <br/>
kids that she sees on a regular basis - especially the older girls <br/>
that she adores - do not go to school. And she knows about all the <br/>
fun activities she would miss out on and I think she has lost her <br/>
desire for it - at least she hasn&#39;t mentioned it in awhile.<br/>
<br/>
But one thing that I discovered through all of this is that she does <br/>
crave structured activities and she really wants to be doing things <br/>
independently of me. When the summer camp catalog from a local nature <br/>
group arrived in the mail, she wanted to sign up for every week&#39;s <br/>
camp. And for a long time, she talked about wanting to go to &quot;ballet <br/>
school&quot; (which comes from a book we read), so we signed her up for <br/>
ballet classes (which she insisted we call ballet *school*), she <br/>
asked for violin lessons after watching the two female violin players <br/>
in the Lord of the Dance DVD and she has been taking them now since <br/>
she was 3, and playing the violin every day. She&#39;s a hard taskmaster <br/>
on herself. She&#39;s going to play in a homeschool talent show this week <br/>
and she chose her newest, hardest piece to play and is diligently <br/>
attacking it in practice. It&#39;s a bit mind-boggling to see a 4 y.o. <br/>
who is so driven, but I&#39;m much this way myself so I just need to <br/>
accept that this is who she is, and that this is how unschooling <br/>
looks for her - a more scheduled approach to learning, but one that <br/>
is self-driven. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that there are going to be kids who crave the <br/>
kinds of things that school offers - structure, lessons, constant <br/>
presence of other kids. The challenge in unschooling is to provide <br/>
them with enough of what they need. For extremely social kids in <br/>
areas with little homeschool support, that can be pretty tough, and <br/>
it might mean getting more involved in things like scouting or other <br/>
organized groups (which you mentioned you said to her). Summer is a <br/>
good time to try out more schoolish things. A lot of working parents <br/>
have to have their kids in summer camps, so there are a lot more <br/>
daycamps offered than there used to be. Maybe there&#39;s a couple that <br/>
she&#39;d like to try, and she would get to see a little bit of what it <br/>
entails - the routine of having to get there at 8:00 in the morning, <br/>
for instance.<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re on the right track with pointing out that we don&#39;t <br/>
need school to learn.  Also finding out what she is wanting out of <br/>
the experience,  like you said, riding the bus or being with other <br/>
kids.   Or the writing in a book. :)<br/>
<br/>
You can fill those wants in other ways. How about a journal to write <br/>
and to create in?   I know we&#39;re going to go and ride the city buses <br/>
soon,  just to check out the city in a different way.   And as far as <br/>
being with other kids,  if my kids want that, I make sure we&#39;re <br/>
having friends over and doing things with other kids. <br/>
<br/>
As far as Girl Scouts, Kyra, my now 7 yr old dd, learned a bit about <br/>
structured group activities and now doesn&#39;t want to be in it.  She <br/>
had one leader/helper who was always telling her the &quot;right&quot; way to <br/>
do her crafts.  It drove her crazy!  I know Scouts don&#39;t have to be <br/>
this way but there are usually time constraints and other rules to be <br/>
followed.  The groups that my girls were part of were pretty rigid.<br/>
<br/>
Kyra talked a lot about going to school when all her <br/>
friends were going off to kindergarten and 1st grade.  It has since <br/>
tapered off.  We have so many kids coming to our <br/>
house and saying that they wished they could stay home.  My other two <br/>
kids who have been in school never ask to go back.  For Kyra, it <br/>
really is an unknown so I can understand why she&#39;s curious about it.<br/>
<br/>
I do always say that if they really, truly want to go back to school, <br/>
I will let them. I believe it is up to them.   But then we also have <br/>
lots of talks about what that would entail. <br/>

OH! Duncan got a whiff of that at a homeSCHOOLING (emphasis on the  <br/>
*schooling*) 4-H meeting.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
We had to stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance, sit in neat rows, raise  <br/>
our hands to speak, and then follow the &quot;program&quot;, which was about leaves and  <br/>
trees and bark. *I* did the &quot;assignment&quot; of collecting the items from the yard  <br/>
while Duncan played with the host kids toys! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We went back the next week, mostly because Duncan&#39;s friends were there,  but <br/>
he didn&#39;t want to go a third time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868509223">Jaiden(5.5) wanted to &quot;go to school&quot;  a few weeks ago. We sat down and talked about what it was that he wanted. He didn&#39;t like saying &quot;we homeschool&quot; he wanted a name and classes. We talked a bit more about names and classes and he came up with where he really wanted to go was Hogwarts.<br/>
<br/>
So, we are now calling our school, Hogarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardary; Michigan Chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Avery(2.5) goes to Red Power Ranger Fighting School.<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden has plans to redecorate his room to look like Gryfindor, he wants to make a big banner/poster to hang in the livingroom letting eveyone know that we are Hogwarts-he wants the whole house to look like Hogwarts :)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s planning out his class schedual, potions class = cooking or playing in the mud, stuff like that. He wants a typed up schedual and notebooks, with the class names on each one and some days he puts on his Harry Potter costume, and he has developed a strange lightning bolt scar on his forehead, and I&#39;m missing my eyeliner....<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell he&#39;s a Virgo? :)<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter may enjoy setting up her own &quot;school&quot; naming it, and planning it out. Jaiden has had a blast doing his. And I love watching him plan it all out.<br/>

<br/>
From what you posted, it sounds as though your dd knows that you are<br/>
attempting to dissuade her from school and she isn&#39;t having it &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
So, let&#39;s talk about you.  Why don&#39;t YOU want her to go to school?  What are<br/>
YOU concerned might happen?  If she did go to school, what would your day be<br/>
like?<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think if kids really want to go to school, adults should trust<br/>
their judgement and let them go.  Even if the parent doesn&#39;t think it is the<br/>
best of all ideas.  We either trust the kids or we don&#39;t.<br/>

&gt; go?  Orion has been bringing up going away to &quot;the big school&quot; and<br/>
&gt; riding the school bus a lot recently.  I seems to be related to<br/>
&gt; seeing shows or reading books, etc. where she sees kids going off to<br/>
&gt; the wonderful place...and she wants to know when she will go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have been responding by saying that some kids go away to school,<br/>
&gt; but some kids are homeschooled.  We have said that we believe that<br/>
&gt; kids learn all the time, and don&#39;t have to go away to school to<br/>
&gt; learn.  We have acknowledged why it seems she is interested, &quot;you<br/>
&gt; think it would be fun to ride the school bus&quot; or &quot;you think that it<br/>
&gt; will be fun because you might get to play with the other kids&quot;.  We<br/>
&gt; have casually explained that recess is only for a short time, and<br/>
&gt; that the rest of the time, she would have to sit very quietly in a<br/>
&gt; desk, and will not be allowed to talk much with the other kids.  We<br/>
&gt; have said that we would miss her, and that she would be gone most of<br/>
&gt; the day, and not able to be with the family doing fun things like<br/>
&gt; ________.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tonight she said she wants &quot;to sit at a desk and listen to the<br/>
&gt; teacher tell her to write in her book&quot;.  I said I would be glad to do<br/>
&gt; that at home with her and she emphatically said &quot;NO&quot;.  I changed the<br/>
&gt; subject and told her that I have been thinking that it might be fun<br/>
&gt; for her to join a club called Girl Scouts...where she will meet with<br/>
&gt; other girls, and have a book to write in.  She was excited and happy<br/>
&gt; about that and dropped the school talk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How best to handle so she can feel right?<br/>

the muggles don&#39;t get suspicious). Yesterday, we capped it all off by <br/>
renting a theatre for a private showing of the 3rd Harry Potter <br/>
movie. We had 25 kids in this year&#39;s Hogwarts class. It&#39;s been loads <br/>
of fun! Maybe you could do something similar if you have a local <br/>
homeschooling group. We started off small, I think the first year we <br/>
only had 5 or 6 families doing it (10 - 12 kids) and met for classes <br/>
in people&#39;s houses, and the next year was about 18 kids, this year <br/>
was the biggest of all and we had to use bigger areas to accomodate <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;My kids say &quot;real&quot; school.  Ugh.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids say &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
Nothing we do makes us any kind of a school-lite or school-anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said things like &quot;It&#39;s not as fun as it looks,&quot; or &quot;Yeah, if you could <br/>
just do what you wanted to and go home when you were tired of it, it could be <br/>
fun,&quot; or &quot;There&#39;s a lot of waiting, and sitting, and standing in line, and <br/>
doing things you&#39;ve already done before.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re intrigued by TV shows showing school as a fun place, I talk <br/>
about that.  I talk about clever scripting, casting of an attractive variety of <br/>
kids, SMALL classes shown on TV, interesting teachers with interesting lines <br/>
written for them (or comically silly teachers, with interesting comical lines).   <br/>
I&#39;ve told Holly about Welcome Back, Kotter, where there were six or seven <br/>
kids in the class, the teacher would invite them over to hang out, and one of <br/>
them was John Travolta.  Not very realistic for a typical, random special ed <br/>
class.  <br/>
<br/>
And in reference to the earlier discussion(s) on advertising, my kids know <br/>
that Barney is one big school-propaganda campaign, and that when kids cannot go <br/>
to school after hours without an adult around and play with puppets and <br/>
costumes and the coolest wooden toys and paints, and dance in the shaded, inviting <br/>
playground with a magic dinosaur.    Knowing that, watching that show (which <br/>
has good music a lot of times and had some great guest starts like Tomie <br/>
dePaola) and then seeing the real playgrounds of schools around us which are two <br/>
acres of hard dirt with plain steel equipment, and another couple of acres of <br/>
soccer-field grass, MAYBE if they&#39;re lucky, they know.  It&#39;s fantasy.  And they <br/>
rarely see any kids on those playgrounds, but when they do it&#39;s a couple of <br/>
hundred kids at once, and there are always a few facing the chain-link fence <br/>
looking sadly out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played school a few times with kids.   Holly went three or four days <br/>
once of saying &quot;TIME FOR SCHOOL&quot; and setting up her &quot;desk&quot; and telling me I had <br/>
to teach her now.  I would protest for the record, and then do something fun <br/>
and then something boring.  The boring thing lasted her ten or fifteen minutes, <br/>
and then I said it was recess and she never &quot;came back in,&quot; but would get <br/>
distracted playing and that was fine with me!<br/>
<br/>
I found the folder from that &quot;session&quot; last week, looking for something else. <br/>
 It had some drawings and some writing practice (loops and a row of &quot;c&quot; or <br/>
something) and a math page from a workbook.   It said &quot;Duckford Elementary&quot; on <br/>
the outside. <br/>
<br/>
That was our school at home experience. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

going to Hogwarts Summer School. Its some moms doing things for their kids<br/>
this summer. It has alot of good stuff, and he is having a blast. The first<br/>
morning he woke up with letters all over his bed and by his door, that the<br/>
owls left. Enrollment and that sort of stuff. Potions to do, coloring pages,<br/>
the works. Look into it, there might be something your son would like. Its<br/>
fun. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:HogwartsSCS@...">HogwartsSCS@...</a><br/>
You have to join the groups to get into the files. It is alot of fun, some<br/>

Jaiden(5.5) wanted to &quot;go to school&quot;  a few weeks ago. We sat down and<br/>
talked about what it was that he wanted. He didn&#39;t like saying &quot;we<br/>
homeschool&quot; he wanted a name and classes. We talked a bit more about names<br/>
and classes and he came up with where he really wanted to go was Hogwarts.<br/>
<br/>
So, we are now calling our school, Hogarts School of Witchcraft and<br/>
Wizardary; Michigan Chapter.<br/>
<br/>
Avery(2.5) goes to Red Power Ranger Fighting School.<br/>
<br/>
Jaiden has plans to redecorate his room to look like Gryfindor, he wants to<br/>
make a big banner/poster to hang in the livingroom letting eveyone know that<br/>
we are Hogwarts-he wants the whole house to look like Hogwarts :)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s planning out his class schedual, potions class = cooking or playing in<br/>
the mud, stuff like that. He wants a typed up schedual and notebooks, with<br/>
the class names on each one and some days he puts on his Harry Potter<br/>
costume, and he has developed a strange lightning bolt scar on his forehead,<br/>
and I&#39;m missing my eyeliner....<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell he&#39;s a Virgo? :)<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter may enjoy setting up her own &quot;school&quot; naming it, and planning<br/>
it out. Jaiden has had a blast doing his. And I love watching him plan it<br/>
all out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m working on a website and an article about our experiences with <br/>
creating this for the last few years. I&#39;ll let you know when I get <br/>
one or the other or both done. Basically, we just sat down and looked <br/>
at what parts of the books would be fun to recreate, looked at what <br/>
we had available, and went from there. Diagon Alley has always been <br/>
held in someone&#39;s house. Different rooms were different &quot;shops&quot;. I <br/>
have always run the wand shop. I tried to think what would be a fun <br/>
way to make wands, and ended up finding these clear plastic tubes at <br/>
a local plastics manufacturer. They come with end caps that you can <br/>
fit on them. So then I got some &quot;phoenix feathers&quot;, &quot;unicorn <br/>
hair&quot;, &quot;pixie dust&quot; and other supplies at the craft shop and when <br/>
kids come to my wand shop they can select a wand and then fill it <br/>
with the magical artifacts that they desire. I even found enchanted <br/>
glow-in-the dark pixie dust. Fun! You can really just use your <br/>
imagination and create it the way you want to. The kids seem pretty <br/>
willing so suspend disbelief (even the older ones) and go along with <br/>
it as long as you stay in character and be serious about the fact <br/>
that you would never *gasp* want to put a black phoenix feather in <br/>
your wand unless you worked for &lt;whisper&gt; you-know-who...<br/>
<br/>
For classes, we did the same thing - potions classes were home <br/>
chemistry (baking powder and vinegar experiments, rubber eggs, <br/>
levitating raisins, and other experiments you can find onlin). I did <br/>
an herbology class where we planted wolfsbane, went into the field <br/>
behind our house and picked mint leaves and lemonbalm <br/>
for &quot;Dumbledore&#39;s favorite bedtime tea&quot;, etc. Another mom did a great <br/>
arithmancy class where she did a cool probability exercise. All the <br/>
kids got a pair of dice each and she had a big chart on the wall with <br/>
12 characters from Harry Potter, each character assigned to a number <br/>
that could be rolled with dice. The kids tried to predict which <br/>
character would win the race, then they all rolled the dice and she <br/>
moved each character once for each number each kid rolled (I think <br/>
Harry Potter was 7, so for each child that rolled a 7, she moved <br/>
Harry one spot). You could see the probability curve in action, with <br/>
the characters like Snape (who was 2) barely moving, and the <br/>
characters who were more likely to be rolled moving more.<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few things we did, like I said, I&#39;m going to have to <br/>
spend some time writing it all up. Each parent who taught a &quot;class&quot; <br/>
came up with their own way of doing it - from broom-making to <br/>
divination. We&#39;ve kept a light-hearted and fun tone and tried to <br/>
stay &quot;in character&quot; as professors and make it as realistic as <br/>
possible. For the quidditch match, I looked up &quot;Quidditch for <br/>
muggles&quot; online and got some good ideas, and then just worked with <br/>
what I had. All in all, the kids have had a great time.<br/>

group arrived in the mail, she wanted to sign up for every week&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
camp. And for a long time, she talked about wanting to go to &quot;ballet <br/>
<br/>
school&quot; (which comes from a book we read), so we signed her up for <br/>
<br/>
ballet classes (which she insisted we call ballet *school*) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly did a couple of weeklong dance/theatre camps when she was younger.  She <br/>
had fun, generally, but complained about other kids goofing around too much, <br/>
and being lazy.   I told her it was because they have to go to school, and any <br/>
chance they get to relax and goof, they do!   <br/>
<br/>
When Holly was in karate classes, she quit because she didn&#39;t like the <br/>
teasing and farting around of the other kids.   <br/>
<br/>
BUT...<br/>
She did like being able to say &quot;My teacher said...&quot; or &quot;My teacher&#39;s name <br/>
is...&quot;  and she said so.  She said at least when kids talked about their <br/>
teachers, she had something to say.<br/>
<br/>
(Minor point, but maybe will help someone else.)<br/>

Then he needs to study hard and grow up to attend Cambridge, in England.<br/>
He could be reading in history, singing in the chapel, <br/>
punting/bunting/whatever the hell they do on the river, having a pint in the pub (almost like going <br/>

There used to be a goth catalog of home furnishings.  I think Cher was <br/>
involved.  Maybe it&#39;s still around and you could get some few things to help.  It <br/>
might end up looking more like a vampire-themed whorehouse, but hey...  Same <br/>

An art-history opportunity!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

Oh!!  When Christmas cloth comes around, there is often cloth that&#39;s printed <br/>
in  medieval patterns, with gold on red, or gold on dark green.  Maybe you <br/>
could get some this year and hang it here and there for tapestry effects.<br/>

Thanks, it&#39;s a holdover from my skydiving days. Actually, in the ol&#39; <br/>
days of skydiving when the airplane took off, someone in the plane <br/>
used to shout &quot;Blue Skies&quot; and everyone else shouted &quot;Black Death!&quot; - <br/>
I never liked the death part much :-), and I used to say &quot;Blue Skies, <br/>
Black Jellybeans but no whuffos (non-skydivers - a term a bit like <br/>
muggles) ever got it, so I abbreviated it. There, more than you ever <br/>
wanted to know about my sigline.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quo Vadis is a week-long gathering for people interested in creating <br/>
&gt; strong, supportive community for adult unschoolers and self-educators.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We work to empower those dedicated to lifelong learning by <br/>
&gt; facilitating an event that cultivates, sustains, and unites individual<br/>
<br/>
&gt; self-educators and their allies.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Quo Vadis strives to provide younger adults with practical help and <br/>
&gt; support; self-educators in general with an opportunity to meet, <br/>
&gt; network, and share; and anyone interested, a positive example of <br/>
&gt; self-education and cooperation in action - a place where people can <br/>
&gt; dream big, work hard, and learn much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The first week of Quo Vadis was in the late spring of 2001. Forty-two <br/>
&gt; autodidacts gathered in the mountains of Oregon for a week of playing <br/>
&gt; in the sun, brainstorming, sharing knowledge and ideas, and <br/>
&gt; envisioning the future of self-education. Now, with two years under <br/>
&gt; our belts, we are diving into the third annual Quo Vadis. This year&#39;s<br/>
&gt; gathering takes place June 20th through June 26th at Camp<br/>
&gt; Lane, just outside of Eugene, Oregon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are a self-educator, autodidact, unschooler, homeschooler, life<br/>
<br/>
&gt; long learner, or an average everyday Joe who thinks this all sounds <br/>
&gt; fascinating, we would love to get an application from you! Call <br/>
&gt; yourself what you like, but come to Quo Vadis to discuss, practice and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; experience education with others who see it as a lifelong process<br/>
&gt; larger than schooling. We are an adult gathering, but we<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t turn anyone away on the basis of age alone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

I resisted it at first just because it was so popular, but once I did read it <br/>
I was hooked.  By the time I read any, the first three were out which was <br/>
pretty cool because I could read them all through.  When the fifth one came out, <br/>
I read it and then read all five in a row, and I think it&#39;s pretty wonderful.<br/>

and see if it&#39;s more fun for you that way.  My two get a real thrill out of <br/>
connecting the Harry Potter characters and themes to other epics. LOTR and Narnia <br/>
obviously, but also Star Wars and Shakespeare, mythology and the classics. DD <br/>
noticed that To Kill a Mockingbird&#39;s Scout was suspect for learning outside of <br/>
school just as Harry was suspect for doing magic outside of school.  JJ<br/>

when book 3 had been out and book 4 was coming in a few weeks so I got to read <br/>
them in a row.  I was hooked as well.  My son IS Harry right now, and his <br/>
little brother IS Ron.  My only dislike is that it takes FOREVER for them to come <br/>
out.  Once book 5 was released we did CD audio for all of them in a row so the <br/>
boys could listen anywhere and we could read it too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I felt the same way when I started reading the first one. For one <br/>
thing, it&#39;s not terribly well-written in terms of the actual writing <br/>
craft. She does a lot of things that irritate me, like always <br/>
appending an &quot;-ly&quot; adverb to everything anyone says, i.e. &quot;he said <br/>
smugly&quot;, &quot;she said sharply&quot;, etc. That drives me a bit nutty. And <br/>
I&#39;ve read a fair bit of fantasy so I can see where it&#39;s derivative in <br/>
places. <br/>
<br/>
BUT...... all that being said, she tells a darned good tale, and you <br/>
might have to make it past the first couple of chapters to see it. My <br/>
kids wanted me to read the books to them, so we started with the <br/>
first book. By the time I was 5 or 6 chapters in, I was reading ahead <br/>
after the kids went to sleep and finished the first book and was on <br/>
to the 2nd. The brilliance of the books is not just in her imagined <br/>
details, though some of them are quite nice, but in the relationships <br/>
between the people and the things that they struggle with. She really <br/>
knows how to draw good characters and then set them in motion with <br/>
and against each other. There have been slow spots to be sure, but <br/>
overall she can weave a good yarn. I guess what I&#39;m saying is that <br/>
when your kids are interested, you might enjoy them more than you <br/>
think.<br/>

Great ideas Robin.<br/>
We had a HP book group (which is really the HP Social Hour) in our <br/>
support group this year. The kids ended up being more interested in <br/>
playing &quot;Hogwarts&quot; then talking about the books.<br/>
It&#39;s been fun.<br/>
We went to see POA as a group to the 12:01am movie on the 4th. The great <br/>
thing was The Witching Hour (those doing the HP convention next year, <br/>
Oct., in Salem) sponsored &quot;line parties&quot; all over the world and there <br/>
was one here. So we went out to eat before with other folks as obsessed <br/>
about HP (and luckily I met, IRL, some other who find <br/>
Snape....*fascinating*) then went to the theater and for 4 hours played <br/>
games, did trivia, just fun HP stuff. So cool.<br/>
I love the idea about playing Quidditch, I wonder if we have enough <br/>
folks for teams and a snitch.....hmmmmm.<br/>

ground - it is young adults who are unschoolers - too old for <br/>
&quot;Not-back-to-school-camp&quot; but still want to get together once a year <br/>
for a big shot of unschooling inspiration - these are just AWESOME <br/>
people. They&#39;re exploring what life as a grown-up unschooler can be <br/>
like - they are the most &quot;thinking&quot; people I&#39;ve ever known.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may have heard Evan Wright who was on an unschooling panel <br/>
discussion with Sandra Dodd, Mary Griffith, Jan Hunt, and me at the HSC <br/>
conference in Sacramento a couple of years ago. He was so amazing, <br/>
telling his story of finally leaving school behind after being labeled <br/>
and medicated when he was younger - he discovered unschooling through <br/>
Grace Llewelyn&#39;s book, The Teenage Liberation Handbook, and he took <br/>
charge of his own life and is doing some really cool things with it. <br/>
Like running Quo Vadis, for one thing. He brought some of us to tears, <br/>
telling his story at the conference. He&#39;s an amazing young man and I <br/>
have tremendous admiration for him. Tapes of that panel discussion are <br/>
probably still available - maybe contact HSC (HomeSchool Assocation of <br/>
