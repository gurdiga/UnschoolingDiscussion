&lt;&lt; Unschooling is only an advantage, I believe, when kids are MORE<br/>
 involved in life than they would be if they were in school.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
Yes, I truly believe this. And we as unschooling parents have to make sure <br/>
that our children have access to the wider world. It is all well and good to <br/>
say that children should be responsible for their own education, but parents <br/>
Have to help them do that. We are the ones that takes them to lessons and <br/>
meetings, we are the ones who make sure that they get to whatever volunteer <br/>
opportunity they choose. Their education, has to come from us. Sheese, I am <br/>
tired just thinking of it&lt;g&gt;<br/>
By the way, Hafidha, I am from the Portland area too:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-372582225">Hi,<br/>
We did things sometimes. I had a lot of pen pals and was an avid reader. I belonged<br/>
to a small Girl Scout troop; we met twice a month for about ... a year, I think.<br/>
The meetings were held about 45 minutes away from my house (in Brooklyn; I was<br/>
on Long Island). I remember that I looked forward to these meetings. We weren&#39;t<br/>
as active about getting badges as other troops might be; but it was just nice<br/>
to see the other girls. I think I earned one badge. =)<br/>
<br/>
I had interests, but I was also very shy and didn&#39;t know how to take initiative.<br/>
My mom would often get mad at me because I didn&#39;t get out or do anything. I<br/>
wanted to, but it was hard for me to be in new situations. We&#39;d moved to a new<br/>
town several months before we started unschooling and I literally had no friends<br/>
there. When I was about 13, my mom met a few other unschooling parents and we<br/>
would get together with them and their kids once a month or so at a local park.<br/>
One family we were friends with, and we&#39;d visit them at their house from time<br/>
to time. <br/>
<br/>
I had a weekend paper route. We&#39;d go to the library a lot because we all liked<br/>
reading. I enjoyed writing and would make up little stories, poems and songs.<br/>
Most days I would just read from the time I woke up till I fell asleep that<br/>
night. I also slept a LOT - I would actually look forward to sleeping. I think<br/>
that might have been (in part) a teenage thing because my younger brother went<br/>
through the same phase some years later. I spent a lot of time with my brothers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I get home I&#39;ll take a look at my journals to see what other things I did.<br/>

<br/>
By lazy I mean the inclination to be inert. For example, I know a lot of kids<br/>
who only want to watch television all day. As a parent, I wouldn&#39;t allow this<br/>
even if it was what they wanted. Some folks need no encouragement to learn or<br/>
try new things; others could use some hand-holding in the beginning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1584707404">Dear Hafidha,<br/>
Thanks so much for your enlightening post. You toughed on some of my<br/>
greatest fears and I appreciate your honesty. There are many days when I<br/>
give in to my feelings of laziness and I now know that I was right to worry<br/>
that this would affect my kids. (In fact, Ispent all afternoon preparing a<br/>
unit study of the Revolutionary war for this week). I&#39;m sorry to hear that<br/>
your situation was not ideal, but thanks to you, I hope my kids won&#39;t feel<br/>
the same way. Things are going to  be different around here from now on.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello Jackie, Sonia, and Linda (and whoever else asked about being a<br/>
&gt; former unschooler)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry for the delay in getting back to you about this. I wanted to<br/>
&gt; respond, but didn&#39;t quite know where to begin. I&#39;ll try now, but<br/>
&gt; please excuse me if this sounds scattered; it&#39;s late and it&#39;s been a<br/>
&gt; long day. This is kind of long (I&#39;m HORRIBLY longwinded).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t have the ideal home/unschooling experience. I was homeschool<br/>
&gt; from the ages of 12 to 16. At times it was extremely dull and weeks<br/>
&gt; would go by when I don&#39;t think I did anything at all. My interaction<br/>
&gt; with other people (of any age) was pretty limited. I think sometimes<br/>
&gt; my parents didn&#39;t know what to do with me and my brothers. They are<br/>
&gt; not very structured or disciplined themselves, so they were not so<br/>
&gt; good about teaching us how to be. There was not much emphasis on<br/>
&gt; developing serious hobbies or interests or even our talents. Still,<br/>
&gt; they did the best they knew how, and I have no hard feelings towards<br/>
&gt; them. I only feel like I have a lot of catching up to do as an adult<br/>
&gt; because there are a lot of things I have an interest in that I wish I<br/>
&gt; already knew (e.g. Latin & piano) - and that I could have learned back<br/>
&gt; then if I&#39;d known how to be diligent. Since the age of 16, I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; either in college or working. I am trying to unschool myself now as an<br/>
&gt; adult, and the hardest thing for me is just knowing how to *finish*<br/>
&gt; things. It&#39;s not easy to learn these skills when you&#39;re 20-something<br/>
&gt; ... and I&#39;m something of a dilettante by nature; *my* unschooling<br/>
&gt; experience probably reinforced that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Despite all that, I support other people&#39;s efforts to home/unschool, I<br/>
&gt; believe in the philosophy and if I had children I would more than<br/>
&gt; likely unschool them.  I enjoy learning and would love to be able to<br/>
&gt; spend time with my kid(s) everyday exploring the world and learning<br/>
&gt; with them. My main suggestion to parents (and I don&#39;t intend this to<br/>
&gt; be AT ALL accusatory)  is to really fight the urge to be lazy.  Make<br/>
&gt; sure your kids are really learning and engaged in life - taking<br/>
&gt; lessons, volunteering, getting outdoors, and developing skills;<br/>
&gt; whether they&#39;re playing an instrument, re-enacting history, sewing,<br/>
&gt; gardening, working on computers, fixing cars, or flying planes, they<br/>
&gt; should be experiencing things and trying things out. We don&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; have these opportunities as adults. (We should, but we don&#39;t.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book Grace Llewellyn edited (I believe it&#39;s called &quot;Real Lives&quot;)<br/>
&gt; that featured essays by a dozen or so unschooling teens was excellent.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling is only an advantage, I believe, when kids are MORE<br/>
&gt; involved in life than they would be if they were in school. And when<br/>
&gt; they are more in touch with themselves. I was VERY in touch with<br/>
&gt; myself as an unschooling teen, but I wasn&#39;t immersed in life; that was<br/>
&gt; a very serious inbalance, and seven years later it&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; still trying to right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think my parents keeping me out of school prevented me from being<br/>
&gt; overly concerned with what other people think about me because when I<br/>
&gt; first left school I was very, very easily hurt by others. I had low<br/>
&gt; self esteem.  I got along with everyone, but was also easily<br/>
&gt; intimidated and fearful of being disliked. To some degree it&#39;s part of<br/>
&gt; my personality to want to get along and avoid confrontation, but I<br/>
&gt; think my parents saw that school wasn&#39;t helping me in this regard;  I<br/>
&gt; do believe I&#39;m a much stronger-willed and independent person now than<br/>
&gt; I would have been had I stayed in junior high.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps the best thing about my parents&#39; decision to unschool is that<br/>
&gt; it exposed me to various subcultures ... different way of looking at<br/>
&gt; things. I was alerted to alternative movements and ideas at a young<br/>
&gt; age, and learned to view everything (especially mainstream lifestyle)<br/>
&gt; with some skepticism, to not believe everything I was told, and to<br/>
&gt; question convention. I can say with a fair amount of certainty that<br/>
&gt; had I gone the normal schooling route I&#39;d be in the rat race with so<br/>
&gt; many other people, just trying to keep up with the Joneses, trying to<br/>
&gt; appear impressive and accomplished, and not asking myself &quot;Why am I<br/>
&gt; doing this? Who am I doing this for?&quot;  There&#39;s a large part of me that<br/>
&gt; can be really uptight and conservative, so unschooling was a fantastic<br/>
&gt; counterbalance to that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I could go back 10 years and do things differently, I would have a<br/>
&gt; more active and fulfilling unschooling experience;  I wouldn&#39;t choose<br/>
&gt; school.  So that&#39;s that. I hope this answered your questions. Oh, and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a pretty &#39;normal&#39; adult. I work for a utility company, make decent<br/>
&gt; money, keep my own apartment, and have some friends. Still, I really<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like this office work and plan to next year move to Spain to<br/>
&gt; study Spanish for a year, and then who knows? There are so many things<br/>
&gt; I want to do, that if one thing doesn&#39;t work out it just points me in<br/>
&gt; another direction I was interested in anyway.<br/>

Thanks for the input. You certainly made some good points and I know you&#39;re<br/>
right. If we try to change everything in 1 day because of something someone<br/>
else says, it will prbably only last a week. But, you&#39;re also right that we<br/>
have been looking to make a change for a while. I need to get myself more<br/>
motivated and Hafidha&#39;s post just made me realize that not doing so could be<br/>
detramental to my kid&#39;s education.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Amy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not picking on Amy :-) but I just wanted to comment. I&#39;m often<br/>
&gt; dismayed at people who change their whole way of parenting (hs-ing, etc)<br/>
&gt; because of an off hand remark or one person&#39;s story that they&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt; on-line. I really appreciated Hafidha&#39;s story (tho, sadly, I saw some of<br/>
&gt; my childhood in what she described, and I was sent to school), but I<br/>
&gt; would urge everyone to not go against their instincts because of one<br/>
&gt; story, which, by the way, was over-all a positive one! Children are<br/>
&gt; different and so are parents. I don&#39;t think unschooling or parenting the<br/>
&gt; way someone else says to will work. You have to raise your kids the way<br/>
&gt; that works for you and your family. We can learn by other&#39;s successes<br/>
&gt; and mistakes, and the example of others certainly gives us something to<br/>
&gt; think about (which is one reason we&#39;re all on this list) but I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think we should let ourselves have knee-jerk reactions to other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; experiences. Basically, we&#39;re all going to make mistakes. Whether you<br/>
&gt; send your kids to school, or homeschool, or unschool, there are always<br/>
&gt; going to be things you could have done better, and things you could have<br/>
&gt; done worse. I think we should learn as much as we can from the<br/>
&gt; experiences of others, take a good, hard look at our own families, and<br/>
&gt; then do what our instincts tell us to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And Amy, I&#39;m really not singling you out. I did notice you said you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; been worried about how it&#39;s going for your family so it&#39;s not just<br/>
&gt; Hafidha&#39;s story that is prompting you to make a change. But I have met<br/>
&gt; too many people online who read one story from one person and then panic<br/>
&gt; and run out and change everything. I just thought I&#39;d comment on that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you so much for sharing your history!  I just wanted to tell you,<br/>
don&#39;t feel too bad, I was in school and was terrbily bored from 12-18, when<br/>
I got involved in smoking/drinking , the opposite sex  and later <br/>
recreational drugs (and still maintained an honor roll and good girl<br/>
status).  At 15 I was working and still doing very well in school where<br/>
I was biding my time.  I hung out with my business teacher and took<br/>
all her advanced classes in addition to be an aid.  I did a few <br/>
interesting things, petitioning the coach to let sophomore girls in<br/>
his weights class (me and my gf won and paved the way for other<br/>
girls), was able to take archery (fun would like to do more of that<br/>
again when the kids grow older) and my passion, scuba diving was<br/>
offered one quarter at my school.  So these are the things I took<br/>
away from my school experienc.  Not a bad one?   My parents<br/>
never encouraged me to really do anything specific (I didn&#39;t know what<br/>
I wanted to do anyhow) although they always told me that I could do/be <br/>
whatever I wanted,<br/>
and quite frankly that has always stuck with me more than anything, the <br/>
fact that my parents had the confidence in me and helped to instill in<br/>
myself that I can do whatever I set out to do.  I am not sure if I believe<br/>
that we can be taught or learn how to be diligent.  Certain things are<br/>
inherent in our personalities.  I for instance, am a procrastinator, would<br/>
rather read (books or email) than do just about anything yet I run a <br/>
successful construction business with my husband (I do take care of things <br/>
when they need to be done within deadlines--but nothing I learned in <br/>
school prepared me for running a business--the skills I learned were typing,<br/>
shorthand--a dead art &lt;g&gt;, and beginning computer which is nothing like<br/>
what I later on taught myself at my first professional job or what I do<br/>
today in business, in fact I remember my gf and I mostly telling jokes and<br/>
getting out of that class early LOL--if my work was done my teach would<br/>
let me go).  My children are <br/>
learning all kinds of cool stuff everyday mostly on their own, in addition<br/>
I am running a house and being a mother.    After immersing myself for<br/>
the last seven years in the education and practical application of <br/>
childbirth, nutrition, parenting and child development,<br/>
homeschooling/un I am just now seeing that I may have other interests.  Not<br/>
burning LOL but interesting just the same such as I look forward to some of <br/>
our historical field trips as much as the children do.  (I like history, but <br/>
remember zero--yup not one date other than 1776 from school.)  So this<br/>
is an activity/interest that I have whether or not my children are interested<br/>
(they are though) that I am hoping to learn more about. Geography, we<br/>
like to travel as well as natural science/botany.   Well, I could<br/>
go on all morning, but will cut myself short here!  Again, I enjoy hearing<br/>
your experiences : )<br/>
