<div id="ygrps-yiv-1848740251">&quot;Gingerbread or chocolate chips?  Maybe, but I&#39;m just see it as a different<br/>
way, a much better way of course but the goal is learning isn&#39;t it? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to say the goal was learning.  I wouldn&#39;t say that anymore.  Now I<br/>
would say the goal is happiness, peace, and thorough enjoyment of life.<br/>
Learning is something that I trust to happen naturally  when there is<br/>
happiness, peace, and thorough enjoyment of life.<br/>
