&lt;&lt; Isn&#39;t this true? I mean I&#39;m sure if the parent does not interact with<br/>
 the child they will still learn something. But isn&#39;t unschooling still<br/>
 about &quot;teaching&quot; our children? Actually, facilitating is probably a<br/>
 better word. But isn&#39;t this statement basically true? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No. It isn&#39;t true. Unschooling means doing NO school, not no learning.<br/>
Unschooling is simply being a good parent. One that assists their child in <br/>
what they want to learn, not deciding what, when or how they will learn it.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
