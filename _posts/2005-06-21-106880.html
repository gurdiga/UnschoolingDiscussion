an odd number of  boys) -=-<br/>
 <br/>
They should&#39;ve put three in one tent.   That&#39;s just<br/>
hateful bad  <br/>
planning.<br/>
 <br/>
If that were my kid, I would make a glorious<br/>
counter-offer and not  <br/>
encourage <br/>
him to go at ALL.  <br/>
 <br/>
Crap like that will stick with a person for life. <br/>
You&#39;re not  <br/>
protecting him <br/>
right now if you send him back and it&#39;s not just a<br/>
passing  thing.<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Amen, sister!!! crap like that stuck with ME for life.<br/>
that&#39;s why I pulled my son away from it as soon as I<br/>
regained consciousness. my credentials: i was teased &<br/>
bullied as a child, i am a mom, i have a son, he was<br/>
bullied, i removed him from the situation, and it was<br/>
the smartest thing I ever did.<br/>
<br/>
also: re:  marriage: I am a single parent, and if I<br/>
could do ONE thing over again in life, I would go back<br/>
to the point of the break up and try a few more things<br/>
I didn&#39;t try at the time, because having separated<br/>
parents is hell for kids.<br/>
