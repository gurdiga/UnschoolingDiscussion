Not really! but history will tell. I never saw a clip of Hitler asking<br/>
Germany to be tolerant of Jews, etc., and begging people to please not judge<br/>
European Jews by the actions of a few. (Disclaimer, I am not saying that the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405259750">Hitler used the phrase &quot;evil in our midst&quot; to describe all the supposed evil<br/>
things the Jews were doing and to pump up public outcry.  It is dumbya&#39;s<br/>
latest trirade and he uses that phrase to describe the nutcakes that are<br/>
sending the anthrax.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, why am I not surprised.  Seems the reading of history has gone<br/>
both ways.  Hitler was an avid reader of American history and used the<br/>
U.S.&#39;s &quot;the only good Indian is a dead Indian&quot; campaigns as the basis for<br/>
his to remove the Jews.<br/>
<br/>
Not one law with a grandfather clause has ever been rescinded.  The free for<br/>
all for law enforcement agencies will not be rescinded when the parts with<br/>
grandfather clauses come due.  AND, what most folks don&#39;t realise is that<br/>
only PARTS of that new law have grandfather clauses.<br/>

Governments Use &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; to Threaten Civil<br/>
Liberties<br/>
<br/>
In times of crisis, whether real or manufactured,<br/>
national governments often find it expedient to<br/>
eliminate or abridge the rights of activist citizens<br/>
in an effort to &quot;maintain order.&quot; Ongoing incidents<br/>
concerning surveillance and repression of citizens by<br/>
their own governments take place almost everywhere on<br/>
Earth -- recently, for example, throughout Europe, in<br/>
Argentina, India, Slovenia and Italy. Now, the &quot;War<br/>
against Terrorism&quot; has served to intensify this<br/>
dynamic. In France, in order &quot;fight terrorism,&quot; the<br/>
government is weighing a series of exceptional<br/>
security amendements, part of the &quot;Loi Securite<br/>
Quotidienne&quot; (&quot;Day-to-day Security Law&quot;) that would<br/>
infringe upon constitutional rights. Human Rights<br/>
activists are protesting such measures. In Germany,<br/>
police officers broke into the homes and office of the<br/>
group &#39;Libertad!, confiscating computers, hard disks,<br/>
CD-ROMs and documents. &#39;Libertad!&#39; had mobilised in<br/>
protest of the deportation of refugees by the airline<br/>
&#39;Deutsche Lufthansa AG&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
In the United States, where so much is made of freedom<br/>
and democracy measures that threaten civil liberties<br/>
like former President Clinton&#39;s Executive Order #12919<br/>
have been in place, or intended to be put in place for<br/>
years. There is a relatively long history of<br/>
repression against progressive activists in the United<br/>
States and the countries the U.S. influences<br/>
worldwide, both during peace time and war. Civil<br/>
libertarians are strongly protesting creation of the<br/>
Office of Homeland Security along with the debates<br/>
surrounding the US Anti-Terrorism Act. Some call<br/>
&quot;Orwellian&quot; the increasingly sweeping proposals that<br/>
are being put forward. <br/>
<br/>
In the present atmosphere of war, many are calling for<br/>
measures that will further restrict civil liberties<br/>
and human rights. Both on the ground and in cyberspace<br/>
national security is being used as an excuse to<br/>
question free speech. U.S. government surveillance<br/>
techniques as Carnivore and Echelon as well as<br/>
encryption crackdowns are finding even more support<br/>
than they did before the September 11 attacks, when<br/>
surveillance by governments and private corporations<br/>
was already on the rise worldwide. Likewise, in real<br/>
space workplace surveillance, face recognition<br/>
technology, fingerprint tracking and Social Security<br/>
number schemes are being seriously considered in<br/>
government and corporate circles. Many who rely on the<br/>
freedom to dissent are preparing to protect<br/>
themselves, wondering if appeal to government is still<br/>
viable. Some are taking their fears, inspiration, and<br/>
creativity to the streets.<br/>

for them, but perhaps they are right.<br/>
