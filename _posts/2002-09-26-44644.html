<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215305314">Hi all<br/>
This post is so hard to write, I&#39;m not even sure<br/>
if it will come out sounding right.<br/>
<br/>
My ds is 10 and we&#39;ve always homeschooled. Last<br/>
week I had him tested for LDs. The results came<br/>
back as severely learning disabled (I really don&#39;t<br/>
have the particulars yet, I&#39;m waiting for the<br/>
report).1st grade reading/ 2nd grade math. I knew<br/>
what it would be but for some reason having<br/>
someone else tell me put me into a tailspin. Maybe<br/>
it was their insistence that only a &quot;special<br/>
education teacher&quot; was the only one who could help<br/>
ds. I spent days coming up with a new &quot;learning<br/>
program&quot; to work with him that would include more<br/>
and more phonics practice. sigh, It was harder<br/>
that everyone who unschooled, that I knew, had<br/>
kids who were not having any problem picking up<br/>
reading. Whereas with ds it was and is like the<br/>
printed english language was a foreign language to<br/>
him.<br/>
I could cry. We started out saying we were<br/>
unschoolers but never really seemed to embrace it.<br/>
I kept saying I was unschooling but I have never<br/>
really trusted ds enough to truly give him his<br/>
lead. I always had to be trying to teach him to<br/>
read or do &quot;a little&quot; math with him. Once I<br/>
finally admitted we were not unschoolers I plunged<br/>
ds into &quot;school at home&quot; but he has never taken to<br/>
it or reading or math. School is what he does<br/>
around the things he wants to do.<br/>
Is it the schooling that makes the dyslexic? Maybe<br/>
ds would not be having problems with reading and<br/>
math if I had just followed his lead. He&#39;s always<br/>
said he&#39;s not interested in reading, does not<br/>
really care if he can&#39;t (Of course I&#39;ve always put<br/>
that down to him not wanting to do something that<br/>
he fails at so he&#39;s got a type of  &quot;learned<br/>
helplessness&quot; that he uses as a way to protect<br/>
himself)<br/>
In the last few days I&#39;ve had to rethink<br/>
everything. I&#39;m kinda lost right now. I&#39;m not<br/>
really sure where we are heading. Is it that<br/>
school at home caused the LDs or does he really<br/>
have some processing problems that need to be<br/>
addressed? Is it still the problem of not working<br/>
with ds&#39;s strengths? Everything I read about<br/>
dyslexia/language disabilities states how you need<br/>
to be working with these kids in intensive phonics<br/>
programs like Spaulding or Orton-Gilliham(sp) and<br/>
the older they get the less chance there will ever<br/>
be for them to read fluently. I had a long talk<br/>
with a friend who has known us for years who just<br/>
belives ds needs more time.<br/>
Can I really drop the reading and math and let him<br/>
take his time to find his way with our help? Is it<br/>
still &quot;unschooling&quot; if your still insisting that<br/>
the child does his therapies (audiblox, braingym,<br/>
and earobics in our case) that will help in<br/>
processing if ds does really have Dyslexia. Kinda<br/>
like medicine for the brain.  I guess I was<br/>
wondering if anyone with ld kids have been able to<br/>
let go and relax?<br/>
I hope I can lurk for awhile while I sort this all<br/>
out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481041715">My feeling is,  your son will probably be better for dropping it for awhile, and while he is just doing his own thing, watch him.  He may just surprise you on the math and reading skills he does have.<br/>
<br/>
My daugther is also a late to read child...she isn&#39;t quite up to where other kids her age are.  Of  course she is also a gesalt learner, and won&#39;t consider herself reading until she is able to read H.P. on her own.  <br/>
<br/>
We started penpalling, and neopets, and both have offered her more relaxed opportunities to read.  In fact the other day I typed out a letter for her that she dictated, and she found my spelling and grammar errors.  Welll, at least some.  Realized I said mine istead of my, that I wrote I not I&#39;m.  Pretty cool to me. She also is reading the short descriptions under the pets when the eat something.<br/>
<br/>
Did you, or does anyone know of the site which recommends using a colored transperancy over the writing to help a child read.  I don&#39;t remember the URL.  I did ask my daughter, as she was watching BETWEEN THE LIONS, taking in how the show highlighted the words of the book they were reading, whether that made it clearer to her, and she felt it did.  I don&#39;t know all the particulars.  You may simply want to cut out a pale colored piece of transparency and place it over the words.  Try different colors etc, lengthening the transparency as he becomes better at reading the words. <br/>
<br/>
Also, as far as math goes,  how does his difficulties manifest itself?  Does he understand the concepts but doesn&#39;t get the memorization?  That will come from naturally working with numbers.  I would let him use a calculator or other device to find the answer to the times tables/addition tables etc.  whatever else he is doing. My concern would be that he knows how to carry and borrow, and when. But other problems may masquarade as an inability in math.  He may have a tactile aversion to paper (so he wouldn&#39;t like holding or touching books either) he may not be able to grip the pencil comfortably.  There are grips that may writing a pleasure, that are fairly cheap.  He may not like the sound of pen/cil against paper.  You can try doing these things on a white board, chalk board, with paint or plain or magnetic number tiles...see if he can do it then.  His hand may tire more easily than the next person, so writing more than one or two sentences or one or two problems will become annoying.  <br/>
<br/>
 He will, by the way, most likely outgrow the aversion as he gets older.  My son also had this difficulty.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, while it helps to have a label sometimes,  do keep reminding yourself that what matters is he is learning, not how or when he gets to a specific goal. That is the beauty of unschooling.  There is, really, no such thing as being behind or, for that matter, ahead.  There is just the child being the child.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

  Can I really drop the reading and math and let him<br/>
  take his time to find his way with our help? Is it<br/>
  still &quot;unschooling&quot; if your still insisting that<br/>

<br/>
Growing Without Schooling used to have lots of accounts of and by teens who <br/>
hadn&#39;t learned to read UNTIL they were teens, and were caught up in a year or <br/>
two so that no one would ever know they &quot;read late.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it that<br/>
school at home caused the LDs or does he really<br/>
have some processing problems that need to be<br/>
addressed? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s that trying to keep him on school&#39;s timetable showed him not to <br/>
be mid-curve/average, and now you&#39;re freaking out.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling needs for people to allow kids to develop in their own time and <br/>
in their own ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Is it still the problem of not working<br/>
with ds&#39;s strengths? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
For seeing reading as more important as learning.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t he learn from videos and games and in-person explorations of places and <br/>
things?  Can&#39;t reading wait?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Everything I read about<br/>
dyslexia/language disabilities states how you need<br/>
to be working with these kids in intensive phonics<br/>
programs like Spaulding or Orton-Gilliham(sp) and<br/>
the older they get the less chance there will ever<br/>
be for them to read fluently. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re reading has to do with TRYING (very often unsuccessfully) to get <br/>
kids &quot;back on schedule&quot; so they can &quot;succeed in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You brought school home, and school can hurt you at home the same way it can <br/>
down the street where it lives.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I had a long talk<br/>
with a friend who has known us for years who just<br/>
belives ds needs more time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree.  But the labelling, pressure and testing will make it take longer, <br/>
because he&#39;ll have to recover now from the attempts to help him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can I really drop the reading and math and let him<br/>
take his time to find his way with our help? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Your help hasn&#39;t been as helpful as you had hoped so far.  <br/>
<br/>
I think if a bridge falls down three times in the same place, don&#39;t put up a <br/>
fourth one.  Shake loose of the idea that something needs to be there.  It&#39;s <br/>
not working.  Change course and philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it<br/>
still &quot;unschooling&quot; if your still insisting that<br/>
the child does his therapies (audiblox, braingym,<br/>
and earobics in our case) that will help in<br/>
processing if ds does really have Dyslexia.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Insisting?<br/>
Does he like it? Do you see any immediate benefits?<br/>
Do you see any harm?  (Like frustration or time waste?)<br/>
<br/>
Offering and accepting &quot;No, thanks&quot; would be more productive, I think, than <br/>
insisting.<br/>
<br/>
Insisting got you where you are today, and you don&#39;t sound very happy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Kinda<br/>
like medicine for the brain. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Medicine?  or school training?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129663317">Hi Julie,<br/>
I read your post and my heart goes out to you because it sounds like you are<br/>
really struggling right now.<br/>
I&#39;m sure others will come through with better words for you. But I wanted to<br/>
let you know a couple things. First, the *testing* he went through is not<br/>
the end all be all. It is a snapshot in time with many variables involved.<br/>
Is there really such a thing as &quot;1st grade reading&quot;? My oldest (10 years<br/>
old) has developmental delays and was in public school for a few years. He<br/>
was constantly tested and we always treated that information as just another<br/>
tidbit to add to the other tidbits of information to gain knowledge on how<br/>
he learns.<br/>
Second, your ds is the same person to day as he was the time before the<br/>
tests. Sometimes I would let a particular test or report get to me. I found<br/>
myself responding to my son a little differently. It was like I was viewing<br/>
him in a different light. Boy did he pick up on that. I was pressuring him<br/>
to work harder...learn more. He was pushing back and just wanted me to quit.<br/>
Soon he would &quot;shut down&quot;.  He began to think that I thought there was<br/>
something wrong with him.<br/>
Now that he is home the only learning clock he is on is his own. We are<br/>
still working together to gain his confidence and love of learning back.<br/>
But he is so happy. Which brings me to my last thought. Don&#39;t let the<br/>
special ed folks interfere at all. You are a very smart, intuitive mom who<br/>
loves her son. Just relax and let him shine his own light.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Cathy<br/>

it may have been harmful. Another friend reminds<br/>

not ready to read nor does he care to<br/>
read.....what is it about the &quot;reading&quot; that gets<br/>
us so tense.<br/>
You know its really pathetic I&#39;ve become like<br/>
everyone I disdained when we 1st started<br/>
homeschooling...&quot;oh those &quot;schoolathomers&quot; sniff<br/>
sniff. Serves me right.<br/>
DS likes the idea of unschooling, always has,<br/>
maybe that&#39;s been the problem all along...ds the<br/>
unschooler and has pretty much ignored my attemps<br/>
to &quot;help&quot; him. I can remember when he 1st tyed his<br/>
shoes and rode a bike. Ds, of course, did it on<br/>
his timetable and taught himself.<br/>
He was pretty happy today with the conversation.<br/>
Now if I can just keep my hands off for awhile.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764649294">I&#39;ve decided there is nothing so magical about what the &quot;professionals&quot;<br/>
do.  Don&#39;t be intimidated by them.  My oldest son is 17 now, reads with no<br/>
problems, makes movies, writes scripts, etc., but it wasn&#39;t always like<br/>
that.  At 10 years old he was severely struggling, at that time I was<br/>
convinced that he was dyslexic.  (His dad is dyslexic.)  He didn&#39;t get<br/>
anywhere with reading and spelling until I backed off and let him read only<br/>
things of interest to him - comic books, video game guides, etc.!  He also<br/>
discovered when editing his own books recently that his spelling had<br/>
improved dramatically over the course of about two years.<br/>
  Now, it is happening with my younger son, 11 years old.  I am positive<br/>
that if I had him tested the results would only take away his confidence<br/>
(and mine).<br/>
  Even my husband - after putting public school many years behind him - has<br/>
improved (in his reading and spelling skills).  There was a time when I<br/>
NEVER saw him read.  Now he currently has three books going at a time!<br/>
  My suggestion is to not look at that report when it comes.  Lock the<br/>
results away or burn them!  The &quot;professionals&quot; don&#39;t know your son.  He is<br/>
so lucky to be at home with you and not in the &quot;system&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453259518">I posed this question to an alternative learning list I am on.  This is the<br/>
most comprehensive of the answers I received.  Regards,<br/>
Liz<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Just some thoughts<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am Dyslexic, for me it was only diagnosed when I approached a doctor<br/>
for help as a mature student reading for my Degree.<br/>
<br/>
Literally - Dyslexia means word blindness. Its not just a reluctance to<br/>
learn to read and or write it has within it a number of specific<br/>
difficulties which are characteristic of Dyslexia as well as some<br/>
characteristics which may be regarded as beneficial (for example in the<br/>
mid 1980&#39;s it was noted that 9 out of ten of the worlds highest paid<br/>
architects were profoundly Dyslexic. The man who produced the<br/>
motherboard for the first Apple Mac was dyslexic) a remarkably high<br/>
proportion of Nobel Laureates are dyslexic.<br/>
<br/>
While there are some who believe that it is a product of poor teaching<br/>
there are others who believe that it is physiological. It is certainly<br/>
true that the brains of Dyslexics are structured differently to those of<br/>
non-dyslexics - this has been known to be the case since the mid 1970&#39;s.<br/>
This could however be an effect rather than a cause as the brain is<br/>
dynamic - it changes its structure depending upon the environment it<br/>
finds itself in - so as far as I understand it the jury is out.<br/>
<br/>
Either way dyslexia presents real problems for which there are specific<br/>
methods which can be used to help solve them. There are some specific<br/>
teaching methods for this problem - you need to know what they are -<br/>
some are very effective - there are some good mailing lists in the<br/>
internet where these are discussed (there is a good group run by the UK<br/>
home education community)<br/>
<br/>
His self esteem is probably low and needs a boost, find an activity in<br/>
which he excels. Encourage him to be in situations where he can gain<br/>
peer status. I used to do First aid up to competition level and was team<br/>
captain and loved it - no writing involved and a useful skill. In the UK<br/>
we have Red Cross and St. Johns organisations who do this for example -<br/>
it also put me top of the year at school for anatomy by the age of 15 I<br/>
probably know more anatomy than any pupil the school had ever had and<br/>
gave the science teacher who had a remarkably low opinion of me quite a<br/>
surprise when I know the Latin names of nearly all 206 bones of the body<br/>
:).<br/>

Use computers with spell checking facilities - get a full copy of<br/>
Outlook perhaps where the email facility uses Word to write the emails,<br/>
thus spell checking occurs as it does in word - while you are actually<br/>
typing the email - this assists the child to analyse their mistakes as<br/>
they write them and gives them confidence to actually write. Remember<br/>
that when he does write anything you must approach the subject<br/>
separately to the way he express&#39;s himself. It is common for example for<br/>
dyslexics find alternative words to those they find difficult - this<br/>
makes written work look idiosyncratic at best - a word I came to loath<br/>
at school (Michael has an idiosyncratic way of expressing himself...) to<br/>
be fair on re reading my work my sentences were so convoluted it looked<br/>
like a poor attempt to copy the style of Charles Dickens.<br/>
<br/>
Remember using a PC is very useful but since typing uses a different<br/>
part of the brain to writing with pen and paper it means that one may<br/>
learn a spelling on a PC but still have difficulties on paper.<br/>
<br/>
I would not send a child with dyslexia to a state school for a couple of<br/>
reasons. Firstly children in school can be very cruel - he will appear<br/>
to be stupid to them and will be constantly pointed out either by<br/>
insensitive teaching staff of by his separate teaching regime - he is<br/>
therefore likely to be bullied and treated as stupid by the other<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
He will probably be grouped together with children with other learning<br/>
difficulties - this fails to recognise his real intelligence and<br/>
abilities to learn. He will become bored and frustrated. He may even<br/>
become disruptive and difficult to teach. Schools rarely recognise this<br/>
chain of events and will probably believe that he is ADHD or some such<br/>
pseudo scientific label. Schools rarely have the staff with enough<br/>
training to be able to provide a sufficiently high quality of help. And<br/>
its remarkable how many teachers are totally ignorant of Dyslexia.<br/>
<br/>
Use visual teaching methods pictures and experiential learning methods<br/>
for example, film media is probably one of the best. I used to watch TV<br/>
documentaries - I was practically addicted to them. I&#39;d say that most of<br/>
my early education was gained from the BBC.<br/>
<br/>
Above all don&#39;t pressure him into reading or writing - it won&#39;t work, he<br/>
will come around to it eventually. He will come to realise that he needs<br/>
it for daily functionality. Encourage him when he shows an interest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088347179">Below I have pasted two more responses to the question I posed the other<br/>
alt. ed. list.<br/>
Liz<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Liz et al,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, I&#39;ve included Chris&#39;s message below because I think it&#39;s a perfect<br/>
answer to your question under this subject heading.  I&#39;m writing in<br/>
support of his response and because I think your topic is such an<br/>
important one (hey, it&#39;s motivated me to actually say something to the<br/>
list for the first time in a while).<br/>
<br/>
Here at PSCS in Seattle we have tended to attract a lot of young people<br/>
who have been classified in other settings as &quot;dyslexic&quot; (btw, we<br/>
absolutely stay away from labels when talking about our students).  In<br/>
some cases the right approach has been to back off and let them find their<br/>
way, believing that the pressure put on them in these other settings is<br/>
the root of the problem.  But this &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach, which<br/>
seems to be what is being suggested on the other mailing list, is not<br/>
always right.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t repeat the list of other causes and contributing factors that<br/>
Chris mentioned (see below), but I will say what he said about trying to<br/>
find the best way to teach each child.  Me, my educational background is<br/>
in Special Ed (a misnomer if ever there was one).  As an ungrad at The<br/>
Evergreen State College I did extensive research into &quot;special education&quot;<br/>
across cultures and, not surprisingly, discovered how much more prevalent<br/>
learning problems are now than in the past.  There are certainly a lot of<br/>
theories as to why this is, but that is not relevant here.  The personal<br/>
result of my research left me believing that our current system is<br/>
basically backwards and horribly disrespectful (not too groundbreaking for<br/>
people on this list, obviously).  It nearly took me in another<br/>
professional direction.<br/>
<br/>
This past year, having shied away from what I saw as &quot;canned approaches&quot;<br/>
to addressing children with learning differences since college, I started<br/>
studying the work of Mel Levine and his colleagues.  I am very impressed<br/>
with what they are doing, especially after having attended their &quot;Schools<br/>
Attuned&quot; training in Palo Alto in June.  Certainly, their focus is on the<br/>
mainstream school systems but many of their applications fit well for<br/>
those of us working in free schools.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the Levine approach takes a neurodevelopmental perspective to<br/>
addressing students with learning differences, believing that every<br/>
person&#39;s brain is uniquely &quot;wired.&quot;  A profile of the child is developed<br/>
based on input from the child, the child&#39;s parents, and teachers.  From<br/>
that profile, the child&#39;s strengths and weaknesses are highlighted.<br/>
Helpful accommodations (things the school should do to assist the child)<br/>
are suggested and specific interventions (strategies designed to help the<br/>
child) are offered.  The child is involved in the most respectful and<br/>
honoring way every step of the process.  Strengths are emphasized.<br/>
Labels are avoided.<br/>
<br/>
My simplistic explanation does not give the concept justice and,<br/>
certainly, parents and educators should adapt things to fit their needs<br/>
and settings.  And I recognize that such an approach may run counter to<br/>
how most people in the free/alternative school world think.  Regardless,<br/>
I&#39;d encourage you, Liz (and others interested), to check out:<br/>

&gt; I think it&#39;s important to remember that &quot;dyslexia&quot; simply means<br/>
&gt; difficulty with reading. Here at the Albany Free School we don&#39;t sweat<br/>
&gt; it if a ten year old isn&#39;t reading fluently yet. But we do ask why<br/>
&gt; not. Of course the first question is does the child have his or her<br/>
&gt; own reasons for wanting to learn? If he or she does, then the next<br/>
&gt; question is, is there something blocking the learning? Is the child<br/>
&gt; too anxious, too riled up, too distractible? Or has someone turned<br/>
&gt; reading into an onerous chore? There are more possiblities of course,<br/>
&gt; depending on the child, but this gives you an idea of our thinking.<br/>
&gt; Then if a child is intent on learning to read but it isn&#39;t coming<br/>
&gt; easily -- which is usually the case because kids whose brains are<br/>
&gt; naturally attuned to reading learn to read almost automatically --<br/>
&gt; then we figure out the best way to teach that particular child (there<br/>
&gt; are an infinite number of ways to do it), making sure of course that<br/>
&gt; it is a freely chosen, pleasurable, successful, unhurried experience.<br/>
&gt; Two things we never do: We don&#39;t say the child has a reading problem,<br/>
&gt; and we don&#39;t take the child&#39;s process away from him or her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So here, it&#39;s of little concern to us when a child learns to read. The<br/>
&gt; only limitation sometimes is that we end after the eighth grade and if<br/>
&gt; kids are going on to high school after they leave us, then they<br/>
&gt; obviously need to master reading before they go. In our thirty-three<br/>
&gt; years, it has rarely been a problem. Reading just isn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; difficult, once the impediments if there are any have been addressed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143929764">We went to the Student Success Center with our son before we left <br/>
the states.  This is part of all kinds of minds program under Dr. <br/>
Mel Levine.  I have the book &quot;All Kinds of Minds.&quot;  I also have a <br/>
few of the tapes i.e. self-esteem.  The assessment they did was <br/>
extremely helpful in that it came at a time when I was needing help <br/>
desparately.  The school psy. had just told me our son would need to <br/>
carry either learning disabled or mentally disabled.  I was assured <br/>
by the center that our son was in NO way mentally disabled.  They <br/>
were able to highlight his strengths and they never used labels.  <br/>
They were all very nice and genuinely concerned.  The only part I <br/>
was not too keen on was the fact that the med.doctor did recommend <br/>
medication, but he did so respectively.  I thought it strange when <br/>
he said, &quot;it was recommended that our own child be medicated, but we <br/>
chose not to.&quot;  Nevertheless, he respected my decision to not go <br/>
that route.  One other thing...the report suggested that the teacher <br/>
talk to the children in the class about how my son learns <br/>
differently while he was not in the classroom.  I&#39;m don&#39;t think I <br/>
like that idea...it seems it would really set him apart and kids can <br/>
be terribly cruel.  To his teacher&#39;s credit at the time, she felt <br/>
the same and did not do it.  Their learning specialist came out to <br/>
my son&#39;s school and talked with his spec. needs team and teacher <br/>
about things they could do and how to approach his learning.  His <br/>
teacher at the time was already doing most of it.  I find now as I <br/>
look over the report (in giving it to the school here) that some of <br/>
the tactics I am sure a school the size of the one here would laugh <br/>
at.  Just because it would be near to impossible to enforce them.  <br/>
Here they group the spec. needs kids together in one classroom with <br/>
a few reg. ed kids.  The big problem that presented for us is that <br/>
many of the children he was in class with had major behavior issues <br/>
(wonder why?) and he was showing an attitude he had NEVER shown <br/>
before.  He was dealing with a lot more aggressive, mean behavior <br/>
and comments.  Anyway, Dr. Levine&#39;s program helped me to understand <br/>
better how my son perceives things and processes things.  It gave me <br/>
a confidence that I greatly needed.  I met with the principal of his <br/>
school (there not here)prior to the year starting and she said to <br/>
me, never having met my son, &quot;Just be prepared that he is going to <br/>
have to repeat 2nd grade and then I am not sure THAT will even be <br/>
enough.&quot;  Just makes me feel warm and fuzzy all over!  So we are <br/>
here now, unschooling.<br/>

*********************************<br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts about Dyslexia<br/>
<br/>
I am Dyslexic, for me it was only diagnosed when I approached a doctor<br/>
for help as a mature student reading for my Degree. This meant that my<br/>
experience of school was miserable. However having run a Home education<br/>
website in the UK for more than two years I have come to the conclusion<br/>
that for many children even when they are diagnosed and provided with<br/>
special help it is still a difficult time.<br/>
<br/>
Literally - Dyslexia means word blindness. Its not just a reluctance to<br/>
learn to read and or write it has within it a number of specific<br/>
difficulties characteristic of Dyslexia as well as some characteristics<br/>
which may be regarded as beneficial. for example Dyslexics tend to have<br/>
higher than average IQ and significantly better spatial awareness. In<br/>
the mid 1980&#39;s it was noted that nine out of ten of the worlds highest<br/>
paid architects were profoundly Dyslexic. The man who produced the<br/>
motherboard for the first Apple Mac was dyslexic a remarkably high<br/>
proportion of Nobel Laureates are dyslexic. It has even been argued that<br/>
Einstein, Leonardo De Vincy  and Shakespeare were dyslexic. Shakespeare<br/>
rarely even used the same spelling of his name twice.<br/>
<br/>
Dyslexia manifests itself in different ways. Some children find reading<br/>
difficult others find spelling impossible, yet others will find both<br/>
difficult. Generally my reading was good but my spelling was very poor.<br/>
Under pressure however my ability to read accurately declined. This<br/>
meant that under exam conditions I would frequently mis-read the<br/>
questions I was being asked - thus my answers were wrong.<br/>
<br/>
While there are some who believe that dyslexia is a product of poor<br/>
teaching there are others who believe that it is physiological. It has<br/>
been known since the mid 1970&#39;s that the brains of Dyslexics are<br/>
structured differently to those of non-dyslexics. This could however be<br/>
an effect rather than a cause as the brain is dynamic - it changes its<br/>
structure depending upon the environment it finds itself in - so as far<br/>
as I understand it the jury is out.<br/>
<br/>
Either way dyslexia presents real problems for which there are specific<br/>
teaching methods which can be used to help solve them. Parents of<br/>
Dyslexic children need to know what they are as I understand that some<br/>
are very effective - there are some good mailing lists in the internet<br/>
where these are discussed (there is a good group run by the UK home<br/>
education community).<br/>
<br/>
The self esteem of Dyslexic children is often low and needs a boost.<br/>
Parents can help by finding an activity in which s/he excels. Encourage<br/>
your child to be in situations where s/he can gain peer status. I used<br/>
to do First aid up to competition level and was captain of a successful<br/>
team and loved it - no writing was involved and it was a useful skill -<br/>
it put me top of the year at school for anatomy. By the age of 15 I<br/>
probably know more anatomy than any pupil the school had ever had and<br/>
gave the science teacher who had a remarkably low opinion of me quite a<br/>
surprise when I know the Latin names of nearly all 206 bones of the body<br/>
:). For my English verbal test at the age of sixteen I chose the subject<br/>
of the Lymph nodes.<br/>
<br/>
Use computers with spell checking facilities and grammar checking. A<br/>
full copy of Outlook perhaps where the email facility uses Word to write<br/>
the emails, thus spell grammar checking and occurs as it does in word -<br/>
while you are actually typing the email - this assists the child to<br/>
analyse their mistakes as they write them and gives them confidence to<br/>
actually write remember Latter and Later are both correct spellings of<br/>
words but the dyslexic child will not know which is which so a grammar<br/>
checker is essential. It is also common for example for dyslexics find<br/>
alternative words to those they find difficult - this makes written work<br/>
look idiosyncratic at best - a word I came to loath at school (Michael<br/>
has an idiosyncratic way of expressing himself...) to be fair on re<br/>
reading my work my sentences were so convoluted it looked like a poor<br/>
attempt to copy the style of Charles Dickens.<br/>
<br/>
When s/he does write anything you must approach the subject separately<br/>
to the way he express&#39;s himself. There is nothing worse for a Dyslexic<br/>
child to write a great story than to find that the parent concentrates<br/>
on the mis-spellings and ignores his creative effort - s/he will soon<br/>
stop writing altogether if the result is ridiculed and there is no<br/>
reward for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Remember using a PC is very useful but since typing uses a different<br/>
part of the brain to writing with pen and paper it means that one may<br/>
learn a spelling on a PC but still have difficulties on paper. In my<br/>
professional life no one ever ever sees anything I write by hand - even<br/>
memos.<br/>
<br/>
I would not send a child with dyslexia to a state school for a couple of<br/>
reasons. Firstly children in school can be very cruel - he will appear<br/>
to be stupid to them and will be constantly pointed out either by<br/>
insensitive teaching staff of by his separate teaching regime - he is<br/>
therefore likely to be bullied and treated as stupid by the other<br/>

<br/>

difficulties - this fails to recognise his real intelligence and<br/>
abilities to learn. He will become bored and frustrated. He may even<br/>
become disruptive and difficult to teach. Schools rarely recognise this<br/>
chain of events and will probably believe that he is ADHD or some such<br/>
pseudo scientific label. Schools rarely have the staff with enough<br/>
training to be able to provide a sufficiently high quality of help. And<br/>
its remarkable how many teachers are totally ignorant of Dyslexia. Even<br/>
at University I was consistently marked down by a Politics lecturer who<br/>
insisted that I was just careless - this after a half dozen re-writes,<br/>
with fresh mistakes each time. Without the computer I bought in my<br/>
second year at incredible cost in those days - I would not have been<br/>
able to complete my degree.<br/>
<br/>
Use visual teaching methods, pictures and experiential learning methods<br/>
for example; film media is probably one of the best. I used to watch TV<br/>
documentaries - I was practically addicted to them. I&#39;d say that most of<br/>
my early education was gained from the BBC.<br/>
<br/>
Above all don&#39;t pressure him into reading or writing - it won&#39;t work, he<br/>
will come around to it eventually. He will come to realise that he needs<br/>
it for daily functionality. Encourage him when he shows an interest. And<br/>
praise his efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Having Dyslexia does not mean that your child is doomed to go through<br/>
life unable to spell or read. It normally improves over time. As time<br/>
goes by your child will develop strategies for dealing with certain<br/>
problems. Technology today is a terrific boon. Personally I&#39;d recommend<br/>
marrying someone who is a walking dictionary.<br/>

<br/>
I felt compelled to paste this in all by itself so it might be easily read or read again. <br/>
<br/>
I cringe at the obsession with intensive phonics as a cure-all.  My younger was recently given a battery of standardized tests (he is now in college) so that he could have the magic paper  allowing him to use a keyboard instead of handwriting for ANY class.   For what it is worth, standardized tests have usually ranked his reading comprehension extremely high.  The M. Ed.  testing him thought he needed all sorts of remedial phonics work since he had difficulty  on the subtest for &quot;decoding nonsense words&quot;.  Yes, let me try to make this clear.   He reads English fluently....both silently and aloud.<br/>
He has an impressive vocabulary and usually has the &quot;correct&quot;  pronunciation for any unfamiliar words he might encounter in text.  But because he can not sound out what someone else would consider the proper pronunciation for a string of letters that do not form any word known to English speakers,  he is supposed to undergo intensive remediation.   I think some followers of the phonics cult have it backward.   Phonics should be one or many tools that might be tried to make reading easier.  Supposed to be the means to an end............not the end itself!<br/>
<br/>
I firmly believe that many of the 8-12 year olds with &quot;severe problems with reading&quot;  would probably BE reading well if there had not been such intensive intervention at ages 5-7!!  Or even younger it seems nowadays. <br/>
<br/>
I  DO recognize it is hard NOT to be worried.   My older son (who intermittently attended out of home private schools and occasionally took standardized tests)  went from basically being a non-reader at age 9  to reading at what the standardized test ranked as &quot;college freshman&quot;  at age 10.   Despite my recognizing that the older one was reading fluently,   I still was sometimes uncomfortable when the younger one turned 6 and 7 and 8 and was &quot;still&quot; not reading.  <br/>
Hard to &quot;keep the faith&quot; even when evidence is before your eyes. <br/>
By age 10, HE was sometimes upset although I would try to assure him that he could read more than he was giving himself credit for and that the day would come when it would be easier.  In the meantime, it was sensible to utilize his strengths (such as an incredible memory)  in getting on with exploring life. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really remember  exactly when he started reading &quot;full-length&quot; &quot;adult&quot; books in addition to manuals and magazines and &quot;trivia&quot; books but it was definitely in his teens. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, he does have some processing difficulties...... the kind that give him a &quot;professionally diagnosed reading  disability&quot; even at age 18.  However,  he has pretty well worked out his own means of compensating.    Watching his peers over the years (many who had reading tutors at age 7),   I figure that had we bought into &quot;early intervention&quot; , it is possible he would be truly handicapped by an inability to read for himself.  Instead, he reads for pleasure AND is able to read whatever he wants.   His reading speed might not be optimum (his silent reading not terribly faster than vocalized reading) but he does NOT find reading to be  unpleasant or a duty.  And no, at present we are not doing any &quot;treatment&quot; for the diagnosed disabilities.     <br/>
<br/>
I think it was important that I not only avoided &quot;therapies&quot; and &quot;remediation&quot; but that I was consistent in assuring him that he &quot;would&quot;  be able to read.  That if he wasn&#39;t reading yet, it was because it was not yet time for him to.   And that when it WAS time, it would not be so difficult. <br/>

My first thought was &quot; test of faith of the Phonics Inquisition!&quot;<br/>
and then I read the next line, which was...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think some followers of the phonics cult have it backward&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I firmly believe that many of the 8-12 year olds with &quot;severe problems with <br/>

<br/>
Yes, and MANY adults just don&#39;t want to read any more than they would want to <br/>
get shots for fun or drink yucky medicine for snacks.  They have reading <br/>
filed under &quot;horrible torture to be avoided at all costs as soon as I am out <br/>
of this prison,&quot; and to some that comes upon them very, very early.<br/>
<br/>
Carol Rice, who wrote about her four children all reading late, got her first <br/>
piece of critical feedback yesterday.  She was upset, and I was expecting <br/>
something HORRIBLE, but it wasn&#39;t so bad.  It was a kindergarten teacher <br/>
telling her that if she had used this or that her kids would have read <br/>
sooner, like THIS woman&#39;s kids, one of whom as a teen is a messed up human <br/>
who left home early...  (why she included that, I don&#39;t know; Carol has GREAT <br/>
relationships with all her kids, the 18 year old are still living at home...) <br/>
 BUT the clincher was a mention of them missing great literature.  Like <br/>
Clifford books.<br/>
<br/>
Now I haven&#39;t read a lot of Clifford books, although I&#39;ve seen a couple, but <br/>
they  offering life lessons children couldn&#39;t be without.<br/>
<br/>
Carol wrote, &quot; She is stupid to think I didn&#39;t read to my kids.  I read a <br/>
huge array of books to my kids.  And none of them turned out to be <br/>
nightmares. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it seems the defenses of those who are sure they are right and we are <br/>
wrong are weak even when they have time to prepare an argument, proofread it <br/>
and launch it away.<br/>
<br/>
But our luxury is being off the assembly line.  If Holly wasn&#39;t reading at <br/>
nine, she had other ways to learn and tons of other things to do, because <br/>
nobody was setting her down in a desk and giving her fourth grade busywork <br/>
which requires reading at a fourth grade level.  <br/>
<br/>
Some skills are only needed in school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are also some risks with reading early. I know a young 3-year-old <br/>
who recognizes many words, and one of those is &quot;danger.&quot; She becomes <br/>
frightened of many things (a train ride with a &quot;danger--bridge out&quot; <br/>
sign, the bunk beds with their warning labels, the warning label on the <br/>
Little Tykes slide). She&#39;s afraid of many really age-appropriate things, <br/>
because she has access to information that&#39;s not intended for her, and <br/>
lacks the capacity to process it and to discriminate.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s my rant of the day, and yes, I know if she wants to read <br/>
she&#39;ll learn, and I know she&#39;ll learn to process this fearful <br/>
information, but it&#39;s just frustrating to me right now.<br/>
