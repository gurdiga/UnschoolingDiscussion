<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036894886">The teachers&#39; unions and the education bureaucracies are threatened by<br/>
&quot;regular&quot; parents who feel competent to direct the education of their<br/>

&quot;job.&quot;  We know better.<br/>
<br/>
In response to CA&#39;s recent attempts to eliminate homeschooling, Michelle<br/>
Malkin, a consistently fine syndicated writer, responds with the following<br/>
recent column. <br/>

Crusading to keep kids clueless<br/>
The public education monopoly can&#39;t stand the thought of &quot;unqualified&quot;<br/>
parents teaching their own children. That is why they are cracking down on<br/>
home schooling, even as a new study shows that thousands of public school<br/>
teachers themselves are shamefully unqualified to educate the nation&#39;s<br/>
students.<br/>
<br/>
(snip of CA specific reports)<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve said many times before, there&#39;s nothing like stiff competition to<br/>
bring out the worst in government.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere does this prove more true than in the battle between home-schooling<br/>
parents and public school bureaucrats. More than 1.2 million children now<br/>
call mom and dad their controlling educational authorities.<br/>
 <br/>
Their overwhelming success -- in academic competition, on national tests,<br/>
and in college -- poses a mounting threat to the government-run education<br/>
monopoly and to the public school teachers&#39; unions.<br/>
<br/>
Despite abominably low test scores, enormous waste, unsafe classrooms and<br/>
administrative incompetence, the public schools have remained a hallowed and<br/>
untouchable fixture.<br/>
<br/>
How dare &quot;uncredentialed&quot; parents rise up in revolt? How dare they demand<br/>
excellence, discipline, and a curriculum that reflects their values and love<br/>
of country? Mocking home schoolers as fringe radicals and religious<br/>
extremists, meddling with their teaching materials, and forcing them to beg<br/>
public school officials for permission to educate their own children wasn&#39;t<br/>
enough to defeat the growing movement.<br/>
<br/>
So now California&#39;s educracy has adopted a new motto: If you can&#39;t beat &#39;em,<br/>
criminalize &#39;em. These bully tactics are bound to backfire in California and<br/>
the rest of the country as the public school system&#39;s incompetence continues<br/>
to be laid bare. <br/>
<br/>
As California wages its war on &quot;unqualified&quot; parents, a new report by the<br/>
Washington, D.C.-based Education Trust reported this week that one-fourth of<br/>
all secondary school classes are taught by public school teachers untrained<br/>
in the class subject. It&#39;s a problem that hasn&#39;t improved for nearly a<br/>
decade. The researchers examined whether classes in four core subjects --<br/>
English, math, science and social studies -- were assigned to a teacher who<br/>
lacked a college major or minor in that field or a related field.<br/>
<br/>
Nationally, 24.2 percent of classes were taught by such unqualified<br/>
teachers. <br/>
In California, 27 percent of classes were taught by the untrained.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve states had more than 30 percent of classes fitting that category.<br/>
Five states -- Arizona, Delaware, Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee --<br/>
averaged more than one-third. Among those hurt the most by this trend: poor<br/>
and minority students. In schools that serve mostly poor students, the study<br/>
found, nearly twice as many courses are taught by out-of-field teachers as<br/>
in schools with few poor students. In schools that mostly serve minority<br/>
students, 29 percent of classes were taught by unqualified teachers,<br/>
compared with 21 percent for schools that have low minority enrollments.<br/>
<br/>
Our public schools are filled with substandard math teachers who never took<br/>
math in college, French teachers lecturing about biology, art teachers<br/>
masquerading as history teachers, and other instructors who have absolutely<br/>
no expert knowledge or intellectual curiosity about the subjects they&#39;ve<br/>
been assigned to teach.<br/>
<br/>
This is a system whose first priority is self-preservation of its<br/>
tax-subsidized employees, not academic enlightenment of its captive charges.<br/>
And they dare to accuse home-schooling parents of educational malpractice?<br/>

Hi, <br/>
<br/>
The situation in California is not as scary as it sounds.  People who<br/>
want more information can find all the details at the HSC website <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a>  <br/>
<br/>
There have been no changes in the California laws.  Most independent<br/>
homeschoolers in California establish small private schools in their own<br/>
homes.  The educational laws regulating private schools in this state<br/>
are very vague -- there is nothing that prohibits a private school being<br/>
in a home and having only one student, like my school does.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that is new in California this year is that private<br/>
school affadavits (R-4 forms) are being distributed by the state online,<br/>
instead of being sent out as paper forms by each county.<br/>
<br/>
This is probably only of interest to people who live in California. <br/>
Hope the rest of you hit the delete button pretty fast.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
