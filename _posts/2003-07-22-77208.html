<div id="ygrps-yiv-304816400">Hello all, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m posting this here as it conveys much better than I can what I was <br/>
attempting to say. Dr. Rosenberg explains the importance of non-<br/>
violent and compassionate communication much better than I ever could.<br/>

Compassionate Communication<br/>
by Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
At an early age, most of us were taught to speak and think Jackal. <br/>
This language is from the head. It is a way of mentally classifying <br/>
people into varying shades of good and bad, right and wrong. <br/>
Ultimately it provokes defensiveness, resistance and counterattack. <br/>
Giraffe bids us to speak from the heart, to talk about what is going <br/>
on for us - without judging others. In this idiom, you give people an <br/>
opportunity to say yes, although you respect no for an answer. <br/>
Giraffe is a language of requests; Jackal is a language of demands.<br/>
<br/>
Human beings the world over say they want to contribute to the well-<br/>
being of others, to connect and communicate with others in loving, <br/>
compassionate ways. Why then, is there so much disharmony and <br/>
conflict?<br/>
<br/>
Setting out to find answers, I discovered that the language many of <br/>
us were taught interferes with our desire to live in harmony with one <br/>
another. At an early age, most of us were taught to speak and think <br/>
jackal. This is a moralistic classification idiom that labels people; <br/>
it has a splendid vocabulary for analyzing and criticizing. Jackal is <br/>
good for telling people what&#39;s wrong with them: &quot;Obviously, you&#39;re <br/>
emotionally disturbed (rude, lazy, selfish).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The jackal moves close to the ground. It is so preoccupied with <br/>
getting its immediate needs met that it cannot see into the future. <br/>
Similarly, Jackal-thinking individuals believe that in quickly <br/>
classifying or analyzing people, they understand them. Unhappy about <br/>
what&#39;s going on, a Jackal will label the people involved, <br/>
saying, &quot;He&#39;s an idiot&quot; or &quot;She&#39;s bad&quot; or &quot;They&#39;re culturally <br/>
deprived.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This language is from the head. It is a way of mentally classifying <br/>
people into varying shades of good and bad, right and wrong. <br/>
Ultimately, it provokes defensiveness, resistance, and counterattack.<br/>
<br/>
I also came upon a language of the heart, a form of interacting that <br/>
promotes the well-being of ourselves and other people. I call this <br/>
means of communicating Giraffe. The giraffe has the largest heart of <br/>
any land animal, is tall enough to look into the future, and lives <br/>
its life with gentility and strength. Like-wise, Giraffe bids us to <br/>
speak from the heart, to talk about what is going on for us - without <br/>
judging others. In this idiom, you give people an opportunity to say <br/>
yes, although you respect no for an answer. Giraffe is a language of <br/>
requests; Jackal is a language of demands.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I identified these two languages, I had thoroughly <br/>
learned Jackal. So I set out to teach myself Giraffe. What would I <br/>
say, I wondered, if someone were doing something I found unpleasant <br/>
and I wanted to influence him to change his behavior? Giraffes, I <br/>
realized, are aware that they cannot change others. They are not even <br/>
interested in changing people; rather, they are interested <br/>
(italics) &quot;in providing opportunities for them to be willing to <br/>
change.&quot; One way of providing such an opportunity, I decided, would <br/>
be to approach the other person with a message such as: &quot;Please do <br/>
this, but only if you can do it willingly - in a total absence of <br/>
fear, guilt, or shame. If you are motivated by fear, guilt, or shame, <br/>
I lose.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As Giraffes, we make requests in terms of what we want people to do, <br/>
not what we want them to feel. All the while, we steer clear of <br/>
mandates. Nothing creates more resistance than telling people <br/>
they &quot;should&quot; or &quot;have to&quot; or &quot;must&quot; or &quot;ought to&quot; do something. <br/>
These terms eliminate choice. Without the freedom to choose, life <br/>
becomes slave like. &quot;I had to do it,superior&#39;s orders&quot; is the <br/>
response of people robbed of their free will. Prompted by directives <br/>
and injunctions, people do not take responsibility for their actions.<br/>
<br/>
As time passed, I learned much more about Giraffes. For one thing, <br/>
they do not make requests in the past. They do not say, or even <br/>
think, &quot;How nice it would have been if you had cleaned the living <br/>
room last night.&quot; Instead, Giraffes state clearly what they want in <br/>
the present. And they take responsibility for their feelings, aware <br/>
that their feelings are caused by their wants. If a mother is upset <br/>
because her son&#39;s toys are strewn about the living room, she will <br/>
identify her feeling: anger. She will then get in touch with the <br/>
underlying want that is causing this feeling: her desire for a neat <br/>
and orderly living room. She will own the anger, saying, &quot;I feel <br/>
angry because I want the living room to be clean and instead it&#39;s a <br/>
mess.&quot; Finally, she will ask for a different outcome: &quot;I&#39;d feel so <br/>
much better if you&#39;d just put these toys away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Whereas Jackals say, &quot;I feel angry because you... ,&quot; Giraffes will <br/>
say, &quot;I feel angry because I want ... &quot; As Giraffes, we know that the <br/>
cause of our feelings is not another person, but rather our own <br/>
thoughts, wants, and wishes. We become angry because of the thoughts <br/>
we are having, not because of anything another person has done to us.<br/>
<br/>
Jackals, on the other hand, view others as the source of their anger. <br/>
In fact, violence, whether verbal or physical, is the result of <br/>
assuming that our feelings are caused not by what is going on inside <br/>
us but rather by what is going on &quot;out there.&quot; In response, we say <br/>
things designed to hurt, punish, or blame the person whom we imagine <br/>
has hurt our feelings. Aware of this tendency, a Giraffe will <br/>
conclude, &quot;I&#39;m angry because my expectations have not been met.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As Giraffes we take responsibility for our feelings. At the same <br/>
time, we attempt to give others an opportunity to act in a way that <br/>
will help us feel better. For example, a boy may want more respect <br/>
from his father. After getting in touch with his anger over the <br/>
decisions his father has been making for him, he might say: &quot;Please <br/>
ask me if I want a haircut before making a barbershop appointment for <br/>
me.&quot; Giraffes say what they do want; rather than what they don&#39;t <br/>
want. &quot;Stop that,&quot; &quot;Cut it out,&quot; or &quot;Quit that&quot; do not inspire <br/>
changed behaviors. People can&#39;t do a &quot;don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Giraffes ultimately seek a connection in which each person feels a <br/>
sense of well-being and no one feels forced into action by blame, <br/>
guilt, or punishment: As such, Giraffe thinking creates harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Stating a Request Clearly<br/>
<br/>
Stating a request in simple Giraffe is a four-part process rooted in <br/>
honesty:<br/>
<br/>
Describe your observation <br/>
Identify your feeling <br/>
Explain the reason for your feeling in terms of your needs <br/>
State your request <br/>
In describing the situation, do so without criticizing or judging. If <br/>
you have come home from a busy day and your partner seems preoccupied <br/>
with the newspaper, simply describe the situation: &quot;When I walked in <br/>
the door after an especially trying day, you seemed busy reading.&quot; <br/>
Identify your feeling: &quot;I feel hurt.&quot; State the reason for your <br/>
feeling: &quot;I feel hurt because I would like to feel close to you right <br/>
now and instead I&#39;m feeling disconnected from you.&quot; Then state your <br/>
request in do-able terms: &quot;Are you willing to take time out for a hug <br/>
and a few moments of sharing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The same process applies if your teenager has been talking on the <br/>
phone for hours and you are expecting a call. Describe the <br/>
situation: &quot;When you have the phone tied up for so long, other calls <br/>
can&#39;t come through.&quot; Express your feeling and the reason for it: &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
feeling frustrated because I&#39;ve been expecting to hear from someone.&quot; <br/>
Then state your request: &quot;I&#39;d like you to bring your conversation to <br/>
a close if that&#39;s all right.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In a Jackal culture, feelings and wants are severely punished. People <br/>
are expected to be docile, subservient to authority, slave like in <br/>
their reactions, and alienated from their feelings and needs. In a <br/>
Giraffe culture, we learn to express our feelings, needs, and <br/>
requests without passing judgment or attacking. We request, rather <br/>
than demand. And we are aware of the fine line of distinction between <br/>
these two types of statements.<br/>
<br/>
In Jackal, we expect other people to prove their love for us by doing <br/>
what we want. As Giraffes, we may persist in trying to persuade <br/>
others, but we are not influenced by guilt. We acknowledge that we <br/>
have no control over the other person&#39;s response. And we stay in <br/>
Giraffe no matter what the other person says. If she or he seems <br/>
upset or tense, we switch into listening, which allows us to hear the <br/>
person&#39;s feelings, needs, and wishes (italics) without hearing any <br/>
criticism of ourselves. Nor does a Giraffe simply say no; as Giraffes <br/>
we state the need that prevents us from fulfilling the request.<br/>
<br/>
Responding to a &quot;No&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Responding to a refusal is a four-part process rooted in empathy:<br/>
<br/>
Describe the situation <br/>
Guess the other person&#39;s feeling <br/>
Guess the reason for the feeling, together with the unmet need; then <br/>
let the person verify whether you have correctly understood <br/>
Clarify the unmet need <br/>
When people say no in a nasty way, what they invariably want is to <br/>
protect their autonomy. They have heard a request as a demand and are <br/>
saying, in effect, &quot;I want to do it when I choose to do it, and not <br/>
because I am forced to do it.&quot; Sighing, sulking, or screaming can <br/>
likewise reflect a desire to protect one&#39;s freedom of choice, one&#39;s <br/>
need to act from a position of willingness. If people scream at us, <br/>
we do not scream back. We listen beneath the words and hear what they <br/>
are really saying - that they have a need and want to get their need <br/>
met.<br/>
<br/>
If a mother has asked her daughter to please do her chores and she <br/>
has refused, the Giraffe dance may go something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Parent: Are you feeling annoyed right now because you want to do your <br/>
chores at your own pace rather than being forced to do them?<br/>
<br/>
Child: Yeah, I&#39;m sick and tired of being a slave. [Note the defensive <br/>
mode, indicating a need to be listened to.]<br/>
<br/>
Parent: So, you really want to do things when it feels good to do <br/>
them, and you&#39;re not just avoiding them altogether?<br/>
<br/>
Child: You order me around! [The child still needs to be listened to. <br/>
The parent must keep guessing what the child is saying about feelings <br/>
and wants.]<br/>
<br/>
Parent: So, it&#39;s frustrating when I seem to be ordering you around <br/>
and you have no choice about when to do your chores?<br/>
<br/>
Child: I don&#39;t want to do chores! They&#39;re stupid. If you want them <br/>
done, you do them.<br/>
<br/>
Parent: You really hate doing chores and you would like me to do all <br/>
of them?<br/>
<br/>
Child: Yeah... no... I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t feel like being <br/>
bossed around. (The child is becoming vulnerable and starting to open <br/>
up because she&#39;s feeling heard without judgment.)<br/>
<br/>
If we have been Jackalish and demanding in the past, the people close <br/>
to us may need a lot of empathy at first. So we listen and listen, <br/>
reflecting back with guesses about what they are feeling and wanting, <br/>
until they feel heard and shift out of being defensive. We don&#39;t take <br/>
anything personally, for we know that upset, attacking, defensive <br/>
statements are tragic expressions of unmet needs. At some point, the <br/>
person&#39;s voice and body language will indicate that a shift has <br/>
occurred.<br/>
<br/>
At a meeting I attended at a mosque in a refugee camp near Jerusalem, <br/>
a man suddenly stood up and cried, &quot;Murderer!&quot; As a Giraffe, all I <br/>
heard was &quot;Please!&quot; - that is, I heard the pain, the need that wasn&#39;t <br/>
being met. That is where I focused my attention. After about 40 <br/>
minutes of speaking, he did what most of us do when we sense we have <br/>
been accurately heard and listened to: he changed. The situation was <br/>
immediately defused of all tension. He later invited me to dinner.<br/>
<br/>
In international disputes, as well as in relationship, business, <br/>
classroom, and parent-child conflicts, we can learn to hear the human <br/>
being behind the message, regardless of how the message is framed. We <br/>
can learn to hear the other person&#39;s unmet needs and requests. <br/>
Ultimately, listening empathically does not imply doing what the <br/>
person wants; rather, it implies showing respectful acknowledgment of <br/>
the individual&#39;s inner world. As we do that, we move from the <br/>
coercive language we have been taught to the language of the heart.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking from the heart is a gesture of love; giving other people an <br/>
opportunity to contribute to our well-being and to exercise <br/>
generosity. Empathically receiving what is going on in others is a <br/>
reciprocal gesture. Giraffes experience love as openness and <br/>
sensitivity, with no demands, criticism, or requirements to fulfill <br/>
requests at either end of a dispute. And the outcome of any dialogue <br/>
ruled by love is harmony.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Jackals are simply illiterate Giraffes. Once you&#39;ve <br/>
learned to hear the heart behind any message, you discover that <br/>
there&#39;s nothing to fear in anything another person says. With that <br/>
discovery, you are well on your way to compassionate communication. <br/>
This form of dialogue, although offering no guarantees of agreement <br/>
between disputing parties, sets the stage for negotiation, <br/>
compromise, and most importantly, mutual understanding and respect.</div>

<br/>
I read something that expanded on this idea recently (The book:<br/>
Emotional Intelligence) and added the idea that it&#39;s not okay to say<br/>
things like &quot;I feel disappointed&quot; because that &quot;emotion&quot; contains a<br/>
judgement.  The book was pushing the idea that it was important to stick<br/>
with primary emotions like fear and anger.<br/>
