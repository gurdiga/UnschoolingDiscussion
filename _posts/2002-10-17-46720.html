<div id="ygrps-yiv-254711707">&lt;&lt;Hemp is not the same as Maruana (I really can&#39;t spell that). They <br/>
are plants from the same family.<br/>
Hemp is used widely in Europe for clothing, food etc. I didn&#39;t realise <br/>
it was banned here in puritan-land until I attempted to walk through <br/>
customs eating a hemp cookie from the UK. They removed it and <br/>
searched my luggage and confiscated all my hemp cookies. My <br/>
sons were devastated. We&#39;d made a special supermarket trip <br/>
before we caught the plane in London to buy some as they hate <br/>
American cookies :-(&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Omaha, Nebraska for a year and it grows wild there.  Here is<br/>
the hysterical part; everyone knows that you can smoke yourself into lung<br/>
cancer with that stuff and it won&#39;t give you even the slightest of a<br/>
buzz.  YET the government patrols the skies looking for people trying to<br/>
harvest the stuff.<br/>
