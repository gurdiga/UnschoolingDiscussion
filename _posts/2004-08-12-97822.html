<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758091199">The following is a partial response to a mom who is interested in coming to  <br/>
the conference. Her husband is reluctant----in more ways than one. Ben wrote <br/>
to  encourage her to bring the whole family. I thought some of you might be  <br/>
interested in reading a dad&#39;s viewpoint. I&#39;ve deleted her questions and some  <br/>
specifics, but I think you&#39;ll get the gist.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m lucky.<br/>

*************************<br/>
 <br/>
At least 10 dads (not to mention countless moms and kids) have had  <br/>
life-changing experiences at the past two conferences.  I can&#39;t pinpoint a  specific <br/>
event which made those things happen, so I must attribute it to the  entire <br/>
conference.  The presenters ... the funshops ... the dads&#39;  get-together ... <br/>
children experiencing some of their own ... the talent show ...  everything that <br/>
the conference offers (and leaves out) is important.   Complete submersion into <br/>
the entire conference will help more than just picking  and choosing certain <br/>
things to see and hear.  You can&#39;t submerge or pick  and choose if one of you <br/>
is not there.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that you mean my talk with the fathers  when you say &#39;your <br/>
talk&quot;; I actually am presenting in the main tent on &quot;Rules vs  Principles&quot;, also.  <br/>
For the sake of this e-mail, I&#39;ll go with my  assumption.  My get-together <br/>
with the fathers will give him some insight  into unschooling and ways that <br/>
others experience it in and outside of their  homes.  Unschooling is not the <br/>
product of an equation; there is no one  definition or way to do it.  It is the math <br/>
equivalent of  infinity because it is continuous and evolving and maleable <br/>
and has no defined  stopping point.  It must be lived and experienced correctly, <br/>
and it extends  the journey of learning.  As far as &#39;graduation&#39; and college <br/>
are concerned,  there should be people there with whom he can speak about <br/>
those subjects (in  fact, one of the speakers, Valerie Fitzenrieter, will be <br/>
talking about  her daughter, Laurie, who just began working on her  <br/>
doctorate---unschooled until college).  As far as successful goes, you&#39;re  treading on thin <br/>
ice with me.  My DW never graduated from college, and  she&#39;s been successful <br/>
from society&#39;s and unschooling&#39;s standpoint.   Maybe you both need to define the <br/>
meaning of being &quot;successful&quot;.  Bill  Gates would take exception to needing a <br/>
college degree to be &quot;successful&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your can&#39;t support or understand what he hasn&#39;t  experienced or read about.  <br/>
Having him there at the very least means  exposure; besides, he&#39;s agreed to <br/>
come already.  But if you think he&#39;ll  make it miserable for your son, you need <br/>
to ask whether or not you will continue  to unschool if your husband is not <br/>
supportive.  My get-together with  the fathers is crucial to his being in a <br/>
&#39;safe&#39; environment to discuss issues  specific to the dads.  Everything else at <br/>
the conference is just as  important because he&#39;ll see how fathers are <br/>
interacting with their children  every minute of every hour of every day of the <br/>
conference.  Not knocking  you moms, but that is a thing of beauty for me.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is more of a separate subject than the conference itself, but two  <br/>
things here: 1) what &#39;you&#39; want vs what he wants and 2) teaching vs  learning.  <br/>
What he wants is what your focus is in unschooling.  One of  the basic themes <br/>
throughout your note is how much you want this to work, and  that&#39;s good ... you <br/>
have to have the passion to do it.  But in the end,  it&#39;s got to be what he <br/>
wants.  I don&#39;t deny that being home in an  unschooling environment would be the <br/>
best thing for him, but he&#39;s gotta be the  one to make that choice.  His <br/>
choice will be to stay home if he realizes  that you will help him learn <br/>
absolutely anything that he&#39;s interested in.   If that means watching TV, playing video <br/>
games, playing cards, or coloring in a  coloring book all day for the next <br/>
two months, let him do it.  He&#39;ll be  &#39;deschooling&#39;, gaining confidence in <br/>
himself (and you), become more responsible  for his own learning, and experience <br/>
the value of self-led learning.  Your  responsibility is not to teach, but to <br/>
find ways to turn your &quot;no&#39;s&quot; into  &quot;yes&#39;s&quot;.  In his time, his responsibility <br/>
will be to make choices based  upon his passions and interests and not upon what <br/>
some faceless administration,  government official, or other self-appointed <br/>
expert thinks he should be  doing.  He will empower himself.<br/>

There&#39;s more----but I just thought I&#39;d share a bit.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not above &quot;bargaining&quot; with my husband.  Such as &quot;if you come with <br/>
me to the conference I&#39;ll be really delighted and I&#39;ll do something nice <br/>
for you like: visit your family cheerfully or clean the garage or make <br/>
shepherd&#39;s pie every week for 6 weeks.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I would do it.  (Note: my husband has to go back to work before the <br/>
conference and it&#39;s hard to squish a cross country trip into his <br/>
unlengthenable weekends.)  (So I&#39;m not just blowing hypocritical smoke, <br/>
here.  Um...really.)<br/>
<br/>
If the rest of you have some better tips in spousal persuasion, let&#39;s <br/>
hear &#39;em.<br/>

PS  Although we aren&#39;t making it to MA, my husband is coming to the <br/>
Sacramento HS conference with me, finally.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052618325">Betsy, I totally understand where you are coming from, although I <br/>
don&#39;t have any answers for you.  I just posted a reply to this on <br/>
the unschooling basics list saying just about the same thing you <br/>
did, that my dh has to work and doesn&#39;t want to come.  I&#39;m going to <br/>
cut and paste it here, since Kelly posted it here too. <br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Thank you, Kelly, for sharing this. I, even more now, want my<br/>
husband to attend the conference. Right now he still doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to go. I think if I pushed he would, though. I have told him it<br/>
would mean a lot to me if he would be there with me, but he is<br/>
working on Friday and he might work Saturday morning, then he wants<br/>
time to relax before Monday and it all starts over again. So, I see<br/>
his reason for not wanting to go, but I also know this is a once in<br/>
a lifetime opportunity for me to help him understand where I am in<br/>
my thinking. (Next year is a whole nother year away!, plus he hates<br/>
Florida.)<br/>
<br/>
He mostly understands the academic parts of unschooling. The things<br/>
I think he needs to understand is why I don&#39;t make the kids do a lot<br/>
of housework, like, when Erica is drawing and her drawing stuff is<br/>
all out around her along with a dirty dish or two and a drink, and<br/>
her laundry needs to be done, etc. In his culture, girls my<br/>
daughter&#39;s age would be running the household--cooking and cleaning,<br/>
not drawing. What makes it worse is our neighbor is like he is, the<br/>
women and girls spend their day taking care of the kids and the<br/>
house while the men work and fix cars. I&#39;m hoping he might listen<br/>
to someone who is not me (ie, another man).<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have going for me is that he is not my kids&#39; father. I<br/>
do not have to wait to unschool until he &quot;gets it&quot;. I wish we were<br/>
both on the same page, though.<br/>
<br/>
Crystal, crossing her fingers that dh comes to the conference.&lt;/snip&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-65214847">Last year I had to talk the whole family into going to the conference, but<br/>
they have been looking forward to this one since then!  After we made plans<br/>
to come, my DH found out that he was overbooked; he&#39;s supposed to be picking<br/>
up a colleague at the airport on Sunday in Columbus, Ohio and driving to<br/>
Michigan to lead a seminar.  He was bummed and didn&#39;t want to miss the any<br/>
of the conference (I, particularly didn&#39;t want him to miss the dads&#39; get<br/>
together).  My son also started playing football for the first time this<br/>
year and has a game on Sunday. (It&#39;s also football picture day!) So, we<br/>
arranged for the two of them to fly home Saturday night to be at their<br/>
various events on Sunday and the rest of us will drive home after the whale<br/>
watch. DH &quot;gets&quot; unschooling, but sometimes gets stuck in old patterns of<br/>
behavior (don&#39;t we all?).  It is really great to be able to hang out with<br/>
all these people who respect and trust their kids and love being with them.<br/>
It&#39;s such a great atmosphere of camaraderie.  Anyone who is sitting on the<br/>
fence, or has a spouse up there---COME!!!  It&#39;s so worth it!<br/>
<br/>
Also, after last year&#39;s chainmaille funshop my DH decided to make a shirt<br/>
with DS&#39;s help.  It turned out to be a very long tunic, with no sleeves.<br/>
It&#39;s very cool and they want to bring it to show Julian.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marjorie, who now has 2 extra whale watch tickets available.  Any takers?</div>
