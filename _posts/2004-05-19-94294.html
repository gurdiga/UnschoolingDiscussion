<div id="ygrps-yiv-648229872">Has anyone read the article on pre-school age computer use in the latest<br/>
Life Learning magazine? I am pretty disappointed in it, but am having<br/>
trouble organizing my thoughts for a dissenting Letter to the Editor (also<br/>
the writer).  It seems like the author is extrapolating the results of a<br/>
study on schooled and pre-schooled children on to unschooled children (as<br/>
often occurs).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The quote I like least:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
�it is safe to say that very early computer use � like early television<br/>
exposure � should be avoided or limited�<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to say something about the experience of unschooling families being<br/>
the opposite of every problem that is quoted in the article, without<br/>
sounding peevish. It is almost offensive to me that it is implied that if<br/>
your young child uses a computer for games or learning, that s/he is being<br/>
neglected and the parents are not actively engaged with her/him. This<br/>
doesn�t happen with unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Aside from that broad idea, my other criticism of the statement is that it<br/>
is not �safe to say� any of that, but rather it is the subject of ongoing<br/>
debate - as the article makes clear. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Later in the magazine, in a short piece on anti-consumerism, there is a<br/>
second recommendation to parents to limit TV exposure.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Gee, the more I write the more I feel like canceling my subscription<br/>
(although on balance I�m not going to). I�m troubled partly because this<br/>
magazine is pretty much �the only game in town� other than on line. I just<br/>
ignore the �necessary evil� of the advertising - curriculum vendors and math<br/>
lessons programs.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess what I really want to do here is just share my disillusionment about<br/>
what had hitherto been a terrific publication with enlightening articles,<br/>
particularly Naomi and Jan�s columns.<br/>

  ****I just got that as a sample issue and was very disappointed in the articles that you mentioned. I didn&#39;t think of writing a letter to the editor though, I just figured I may not subscribe.  I&#39;m assuming that it usually doesn&#39;t go that route?  I do have a subscription to HEM and I did enjoy your article Sandra :)<br/>

but it might be.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The article was addressing a couple of recent studies about childhood<br/>
computer use, but the author/editor Wendy Priesnitz clearly has an<br/>
anti-electronic media opinion and is pro parental limiting and controlling<br/>
in this area, judging by what she writes springing from the reporting of the<br/>
study. She sees computers as a distraction from &quot;interaction with caring<br/>
adults and from the hands-on exploration and play that lay the true<br/>
foundations for learning.&quot; (Not in my house.) She also wrote a lot about<br/>
what seems to be life divided into academic subjects and discussions of<br/>
&quot;academic achievement&quot;. At best this is writing about stuff that is entirely<br/>
irrelevant to unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m vaguely concerned that she is going to bring that anti-media agenda to<br/>
the Conference, but if that is the case, since I don&#39;t want to be grumping<br/>
and harrumphing unpleasantly in my seat, I am not obliged to attend her<br/>
particular presentation. I would have no expectation of being able to change<br/>
her view with my anecdotal evidence (the foundation of this list after all<br/>
is the combined anecdotal evidence of those who have gone before),<br/>
especially since she is very impressed by the list of child advocates and<br/>
experts who appended themselves onto a group promoting these anti-computer<br/>
findings.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that this was such a different point of view from any of the others<br/>
I have read about in that magazine, with so much schoolish jargon thrown in,<br/>
was what made it such a startling disappointment. <br/>
<br/>

magazine. I would love to see her daughter&#39;s list about the clues linking up<br/>
through the HP books. Wondering what is a clue for a yet to come installment<br/>
has given me many happy moments of contemplation.<br/>

<br/>
This is the first really anti-media article - we&#39;ll have to wait and see.<br/>
The editor also publishes a magazine called &quot;Natural Life&quot;, though I checked<br/>
out the website and it&#39;s not really anti-TV, more anti-advertising.  And<br/>
there&#39;s a cool article there by Jan Hunt about how much her son learned from<br/>
&quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; One of the articles from the newest Life Learning was sent to me after<br/>
the magazine came out for website use, and it here (Thank you Pam<br/>
Laricchia!!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And just as a bit more of an update - it&#39;s just so fun to watch her!  I<br/>
mentioned in the update to the article that she was reading Harry Potter fan<br/>
fiction on the net.  Lately she&#39;s been posting reviews.  Last night she came<br/>
to tell me that one of the authors had posted a note saying hers was the<br/>
best review she received.  She thought that was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
And last weekend she and her laptop were hanging out in the family room and<br/>
I guess she pulled up the first story she wrote (only two months ago).  She<br/>
was laughing and commented on how bad her spelling was.  Too funny! &lt;g&gt;  And<br/>
she hasn&#39;t offered to let me read anything yet!<br/>
<br/>
Last week she started her latest story.  She told me that she came up with<br/>
chapter titles (21 chapters) and then wrote a paragraph or two for each<br/>
describing what it&#39;s about.  Now she&#39;s writing the story itself.  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about learning on your own ... the only thing she&#39;s ever asked me was<br/>
how to spell a few words!<br/>
<br/>
And as an aside, she mentioned that she likes her chapters to have 8 pages<br/>
and she had figured out that that would mean her latest story would be 168<br/>
pages long.  She talked about the length of some of the fan fiction chapters<br/>
and stories she&#39;s read and I mentioned averages and we worked out the<br/>
average number of pages per chapter for a couple of her fave stories.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention I love unschooling?!<br/>

others I have read about in that magazine, with so much schoolish jargon<br/>
thrown in, was what made it such a startling disappointment. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was really quite shocked as I read that particular article as well.  The<br/>
study being discussed had nothing to do with an unschooling / life learning<br/>
approach to computer use.  It seemed to me that they looked at young kids<br/>
who were being encouraged to use preschool &quot;edutainment&quot; software for<br/>
learning purposes only (i.e. &quot;to get ahead&quot;) or preschool / kindy classes<br/>
using this &quot;learning software&quot; as part of their curriculum.  Very far from<br/>
an unschooling approach to multimedia.<br/>
<br/>
And the Alliance for Childhood&#39;s &quot;Call to Action&quot; which was signed by many<br/>
&quot;children&#39;s advocates, educators&quot; etc encourages: &quot;a refocusing in<br/>
education, at home and school, on the essentials of a healthy childhood:<br/>
strong bonds with caring adults; time for spontaneous, creative play; a<br/>
curriculum rich in music and the other arts; reading books aloud;<br/>
storytelling and poetry; rhythm and movement; cooking, building things and<br/>
other handcrafts; and gardening and other hands-on experiences of nature and<br/>
the physical world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, that sure sounds good.  Sounds like many of the interesting activities<br/>
that a young unschooling kid would come into contact with!  They just left<br/>
out TV and computers. :-(  It seems they are definitely talking to<br/>
mainstream parents who they are concerned are using multimedia outlets (TV<br/>
and computers) to keep their kids occupied at the expense of exploring the<br/>
&quot;real&quot; world and to avoid building meaningful relationships with them. That<br/>
is just not an unschooling approach to multimedia.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll ask her if she&#39;d like to put up a page about it on our website.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, have you checked out JK Rowling&#39;s new and improved<br/>
website?!  Alyssa was so excited Sunday when she found out what Molly<br/>
Weasley&#39;s maiden name was - I won&#39;t spoil it but it was another cool<br/>
connection.  Lots of other interesting tidbits as well I hear.  I can&#39;t wait<br/>
to find an hour to poke around myself!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15128051">Well this thread got me going and I&#39;ve spent some time this morning finding<br/>
and reading the &quot;Zero to Six&quot; study and the Alliance for Childhood&#39;s &quot;Call<br/>
to Action&quot;, as well as writing a short letter to the Life Learning editor.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s the email to the editor I&#39;ve written.  I do really enjoy the magazine<br/>
(not to mention that they just published my article!) so I don&#39;t want to<br/>
come across as bitter but I did want to point out that a lot of the concerns<br/>
expressed are not applicable to unschoolers (or life learners, as is their<br/>
naming preference).<br/>
___________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Dear Life Learning,<br/>
<br/>
The article &quot;Computers for Kids - Learning Tools or Imagination Stunters&quot;<br/>
did not seem to fit in well with the overall life learning approach of the<br/>
magazine.  I would imagine that with the random-digit dial telephone survery<br/>
of 1,000 parents that they conducted for the study &quot;Zero to Six: Electronic<br/>
Media in the Lives of Infants, Toddlers and Preschoolers&quot; they did not come<br/>
in contact with very many (if any) parents taking an unschooling or life<br/>
learning approach to computers, or multimedia in general.<br/>
<br/>
The article states that &quot;critics of early computer use are concerned that<br/>
computers will replace opportunities for hands-on manipulation in real-life,<br/>
real-time situations.&quot;  And this seems to be the motivation behind the<br/>
Alliance for Childhood&#39;s &quot;Call for Action&quot; calling for, among other actions:<br/>
&quot;a refocusing in education, at home and school, on the essentials of a<br/>
healthy childhood: strong bonds with caring adults; time for spontaneous,<br/>
creative play; a curriculum rich in music and the other arts; reading books<br/>
aloud; storytelling and poetry; rhythm and movement; cooking, building<br/>
things and other handcrafts; and gardening and other hands-on experiences of<br/>
nature and the physical world.&quot;  It seems they are talking about mainstream<br/>
parents who they are concerned are using multimedia outlets (TV and<br/>
computers) to keep their kids occupied at the expense of exploring the<br/>
&quot;real&quot; world and building meaningful relationships with them.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly the Zero to Six study did *not* find that electronic media is<br/>
frequently being used as a &quot;babysitter&quot;, with young kids being left alone<br/>
for many hours with no adult presence or guidance.  &quot;The vast majority of<br/>
parents (85%) reported that most of the time, the child was watching with<br/>
someone else.  Moreover, 69% of parents  reported that they were in the room<br/>
either all or most of the time their child was watching.&quot;  They do concede<br/>
that they don&#39;t know whether the parent was actually watching the show with<br/>
with their child.<br/>
<br/>
However, the majority of the readers of this magazine do not have kids in<br/>
daycare or school.  And their life learning kids are living real-life<br/>
hands-on with the full active participation of caring parents.  The &quot;Call<br/>
for Action&quot; list sounds like many of the activities a young life learner<br/>
would come into contact with regularly!  And without the burden of a daycare<br/>
or school schedule a life learning child does not have to wait until<br/>
evenings and weekends to pursue these real-life interests so it&#39;s not an<br/>
either-or situation.  I agree with Seymour Papert that problems with<br/>
computer use arise when it is &quot;isolated from the learning process and from<br/>
life, rather than integrated into the whole.&quot;  Time that our kids spend with<br/>
computers and the TV does not take away from real life, it&#39;s just another<br/>
part of it.  Life learners are uniquely able to pursue their interests and<br/>
learning by living freely every day using any and all avenues available.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>============<br/>
<br/>
I agree that would be great! But, I wonder how many would make it in because<br/>
the editors seem to try to keep a balance of approaches. Even if they<br/>
received more unschooling articles, they might not publish them because they<br/>
don&#39;t want to be an unschooling magazine. I don&#39;t know--that&#39;s just my<br/>
perception.<br/>
<br/>
I like LL because it does seem to focus on unschooling and non-coercive<br/>
parenting while HEM is more comprehensive of homeschooling in general. LL<br/>
also strikes me as more philosophical/ theoretical while HEM is more<br/>
practical/ day in the life kind kind of stuff.  I get them both and look<br/>
forward to both arriving in the mail. I probably prefer the articles overall<br/>
in HEM--they seem more real to me somehow, probably because of the practical<br/>

&lt;&lt; But, I wonder how many would make it in because<br/>
<br/>
the editors seem to try to keep a balance of approaches. Even if they<br/>
<br/>
received more unschooling articles, they might not publish them because they<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t want to be an unschooling magazine. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think HALF would be too much! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also I think (but can&#39;t prove or guarantee) that they&#39;ll choose inspiring, <br/>
sweet articles over dry technical stuff.  Even school-at-homers can benefit from <br/>
inspiring/sweet, but hardly anyone benefits from dry.  But if dry homer stuff <br/>
is all they get, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll publish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360483123">I have to say that as a new homeschooler Life Learning helped me see the <br/>
benefit of unschooling.  I would give it alot of credit hepling me make the <br/>
radical change from CLASSICAL homeschooling to radical unschooling. It usually gives <br/>
clear and reassuring explainations of life learning/ unschooling.  I leave it <br/>
in the bathroom for my DH to read in an attempt to expain unschooling and <br/>
reassure him that we are doing okay.  He liked the article in this issue which <br/>
was an excerpt from the Unprocessed Child.  I was very reassuring to him that <br/>
someone who decided to persue college could succeed without 13 years of school <br/>
behind them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-844920175">I buy it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on a tight budget, as are many.  In my early homeschooling years, I<br/>
didn&#39;t subscribe to HEM or my state homeschool group.  I do now, because I<br/>
want those resources to be around.<br/>
<br/>
Of course not every article in HEM fits me, but I always find several<br/>
articles that seem to be just what I needed for inspiration, motivation, or<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Our state group, Washington Homeschool Organization, is a great clearing<br/>
house for Home Based Instruction (legal term in our state).  They help<br/>
homeschoolers network and keep up with local legislation.  They provide a<br/>
forum for all homeschoolers, regardless of style or other values.<br/>

Well there&#39;s my column in Home Education Magazine!<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe if I didn&#39;t spew forth so freely here, more people would buy that to<br/>
read what I wrote. LOL.  The current column is called &quot;Jubilation and<br/>
Triangulation,&quot; and the next one will be &quot;Playing.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945427433">Just thought I&#39;d close the loop on this one.  I heard back from Wendy<br/>
Priesnitz (the editor of Life Learning) regarding my comments about the<br/>
Computer for Kids article.  She mentioned that they had received a number of<br/>
letters, both critical and praising about the article, and she was glad to<br/>
see that the magazine was &quot;generating such thoughtful and eloquent<br/>
responses!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mine arrived too late but she is publishing a couple of them in the next<br/>
issue.<br/>
