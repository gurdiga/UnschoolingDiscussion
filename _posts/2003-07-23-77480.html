it&#39;s more than a parenthetical thought.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can be very different. For some, the above is true. For others, not so<br/>
much. Just like Pam&#39;s post talked about how each of her girls needed<br/>
something different when they melted down, the same can be true of reasons<br/>
to have a tantrum. <br/>
<br/>
One of my kids almost never lost it and when she did wanted close contact<br/>
with me. One lost it very often, not because he wasn&#39;t listened to, just<br/>
went straight to it. He wanted no contact, no talking. That&#39;s the beauty of<br/>
mindful parenting, giving each child what they need.<br/>
