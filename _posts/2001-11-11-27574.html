<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580939509"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; WHAT IS A VET?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the cop on the beat who spent six months in Saudi Arabia<br/>
&gt; sweating two gallons a day making sure the armored personnel carriers<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t run out of fuel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the barroom loudmouth, dumber than five wooden planks, whose<br/>
&gt; overgrown frat-boy behavior is outweighed a hundred times in the cosmic<br/>
&gt; scales by four hours of exquisite bravery near the 38th Parallel.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the nurse who fought against futility and went to sleep<br/>
&gt; sobbing every night for two solid years in Da Nang.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the POW who went away one person and came back another - or<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t come back at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the drill instructor who has never seen combat - but has<br/>
&gt; saved countless lives by turning slouchy, no-account punks and gang<br/>
&gt; members into marines, airmen, sailors, soldiers and coast guardsmen, and<br/>
&gt; teaching them to watch each other&#39;s backs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the parade-riding Legionnaire who pins on his ribbons and<br/>
&gt; medals with a prosthetic hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the career quartermaster who watches the ribbons and medals<br/>
&gt; pass him by.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the three anonymous heroes in The Tomb Of The Unknowns,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>whose<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; presence at the Arlington National Cemetery must forever preserve the<br/>
&gt; memory of all the anonymous heroes whose valor dies unrecognized with them<br/>
&gt; on the battlefield or in the ocean&#39;s sunless deep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is the old guy bagging groceries at the supermarket - palsied<br/>
&gt; now and aggravatingly slow - who helped liberate a Nazi death camp and who<br/>
&gt; wishes all day long that his wife were still alive to hold him when the<br/>
&gt; nightmares come.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is an ordinary and yet extraordinary human being, a person who<br/>
&gt; offered some of his life&#39;s most vital years in the service of his country,<br/>
&gt; and who sacrificed his ambitions so others would not have to sacrifice<br/>
&gt; theirs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    * A vet is a soldier and a savior and a sword against the darkness, and<br/>
&gt; he is nothing more that the finest, greatest testimony on behalf of the<br/>
&gt; finest, greatest nation ever known.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So remember, each time you see someone who has served our country, just<br/>
&gt; lean over and say, &quot;Thank You.&quot; That&#39;s all most people need, and in most<br/>
&gt; cases it will mean more than any medals they could have been awarded or<br/>
&gt; were awarded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Two little words that mean a lot, &quot;THANK YOU&quot;. </span></blockquote></div>
