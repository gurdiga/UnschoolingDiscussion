Ununschooling, created to criticize the terminology, I guess.  I didn&#39;t read it.  It&#39;s irritating even without reading it. <br/>
<br/>
But if there are people here who REALLY hate the term, maybe you&#39;ll hate it less with another &quot;un&quot; in front.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782810056">I checked out both links.  The website is sponsored by Life Learning Magazine and the article was written by a woman who reads and agrees with that magazine & the recent article that was discussed here a few weeks ago.  There was a supportive post by Wendy Priesnitz&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://disqus.com/twitter-61526521/">http://disqus.com/twitter-61526521/</a>&gt;  at the end of the article.  It sounds like this is a group of people who want to feel good about being traditional parents who don&#39;t send their kids to school but are not comfortable with applying unschooling principles to all aspects of their lives.  I guess that&#39;s their prerogative.  I am still fairly new to unschooling & I feel very lucky to have found this group right off the bat and that it feels right and comfortable to me and also makes sense to my more logical/analytical side as well (not to say it&#39;s all been smooth sailing by any means but I can see the direction we are headed and I like it so I breathe deeply and keep reading, trying, watching).  But I&#39;m still trying to figure out the rest of the unschooling landscape.  I recognized the critiques of this site (I&#39;m assuming you guys are the gurus who make people feel badly about themselves) but who are they talking about in this statement?  I don&#39;t see anybody here getting rich or famous. <br/>
<br/>
-=-  if I am to be cynically honest, I am gonna say that the newer faces simply saw the marketing potential for themselves and decided to invest in it and take everyone else on a reality TV ride. And while they sell books without an ounce of data to back up a single claim and build a brand for themselves; parents are crying in emails and forums over-analyzing with guilt whether or not it is “authoritarian” of them to tell her child to please get in the car because it’s time to buy groceries.-=-  From the article linked below.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very sad that this is where people are stuck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86312554">From that site:<br/>
<br/>
“Ununschooling.com is meant to be a place to move beyond the terminology of <br/>
“unschooling,” “radical unschooling,” and other related usages. We have <br/>
observed that there is much misunderstanding, confusion, and conflict <br/>
associated with those terms. So we feel it’s time to move past them and <br/>
their related definitions, and to explore how to support each other in the <br/>
quest to live and learn without school. In effect, we feel that there is a <br/>
need to ununschool ourselves!<br/>
<br/>
The site is sponsored by Life Learning Magazine, which is a popular <br/>
eleven-year-old publication that provides a respectful, supportive place <br/>
where subscribers can get information and inspiration about trusting and <br/>
helping children to learn and grow without school. It is written by Life <br/>
Learning’s editor Wendy Priesnitz.<br/>
<br/>
We want to keep Ununschooling.com positive. We’re not here to criticize <br/>
anyone, but to support everyone as they design their own family’s unique and <br/>
ever-evolving living and learning adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Ununschooling.com is, like Life Learning Magazine, based on the premises <br/>
that we do not need gurus or experts; that each parent knows best what is <br/>
right for his or her family;  that children are able, with their parents’ <br/>
trust, respect, and guidance, to make good decisions about life and <br/>
learning; and that it is helpful to discuss these ideas in a respectful, <br/>
thoughtful manner.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not much else there right now.<br/>
<br/>
I will probably lose interest before they can adequately explain, without <br/>
criticizing anyone,  how &quot;unschooling&quot; causes confusion but ununschooling <br/>
will make everything better.<br/>

<br/>
I am stuck on ununschooling being a double negative - <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m ununschooling, aren&#39;t I simply schooling, since double-negatives cancel each other out?<br/>
<br/>
To see if it was just me who was confused by the word-choice, I asked my 10 year old &quot;if I&#39;m ununschooling, what am I doing?&quot; and he said, without missing a beat and without even looking up from his Minecrafting, &quot;you&#39;re in school, Mom!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Glad it&#39;s not just me :-)<br/>
<br/>
Ununschooling - <br/>
Makes my head hurt a smidge :-)<br/>

Yes, it’s somewhat ununambiguous.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like plain ol&#39; eclectic homeschooling to me - but I guess that&#39;s a term which has fallen out of vogue. Nowadays everyone wants to be Some kind of unschooler! And with the added cachet of rebellion in Un-unschooling, maybe it will draw off some of the &quot;you can&#39;t tell me what to do because I&#39;m an Unschooler btttttt!&quot; folks. I&#39;ve been thinking that eventually radical unschooling would slip away under another name, as it were, but maybe anything-goes unschooling itself will disappear into this special new category, instead. That would be nice. I&#39;m glad someone has taken that on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s what my very first unschooling mentor called &quot;dreck.&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
Laurette Lynn (and the &quot;aspiring essayist&quot; Desiree Alonso) co-own this site. Here&#39;s the description: The Living Free Project is a virtual &quot;Project&quot; for Free thinking, Liberated families who embrace Home Education and all things Liberty...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not been especially impressed with Ms. Lynn&#39;s writings or ideas. She&#39;s kind of hard to pin down. She&#39;s libertarian in her politics, which may give rise to the notion of &quot;no one can tell *me* what to do.&quot; She&#39;s a believer in trivium (the teaching of grammar, logic and rhetoric). She has a radio podcast called &quot;The Unplugged Mom.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Desiree Alonso has floated around on various groups, it seems, because I remember her name. And her apron company.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another article, in which Ms. Lynn states: &quot;But what we are not, never were and never will be is Unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a &quot;Home Edventurer.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Okay, then. Why bother even discussing unschooling on this site? Is it just another place for people to nurse hurt feelings and get all het up about how they&#39;ve been treated by nameless &quot;gurus&quot;? The place for disgruntled unschoolers to go and find the &quot;truth&quot; maybe? <br/>
 <br/>
Oh...maybe it&#39;s the money-making of which they speak of so derisively. Or being a guru, which goodness gracious, couldn&#39;t possibly account for all the websites and blogs and radio shows and books and vanity photos that *she* has. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like this kind of &quot;look at me, instead!!!&quot; stuff. If your ideas hold water and result in happy families, tell people that. Be confident in what you do and what you can give people without this other nonsense. People will find you. Like people find Sandra and Pam and Joyce. And they&#39;ll stay because they have proof that unschooling works.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid these folks of the &quot;Living Free Project&quot; have been &quot;anti-everything&quot; for so long (like the publisher of Life Learning is) that that&#39;s their only frame of reference.<br/>
