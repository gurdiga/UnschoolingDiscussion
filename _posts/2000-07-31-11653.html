I think that bascially an acitve/alert child is a highly spirited child.  The <br/>
thing is that as a parent of this type of child, it is important to recognize <br/>
their gifts and focus on those.  It is also very important that they be <br/>
disciplined and/or taught in a positive and loving way.  It sounds to me <br/>
though, as if you already have a wonderfully positive attitude towards your <br/>
child.<br/>
