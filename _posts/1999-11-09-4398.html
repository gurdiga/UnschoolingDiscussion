<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198530835">My fav saying &lt;poem or whatever you want to call it&gt; is as goes...AHEM:<br/>
A squirrel learns to climb by climbing, <br/>
A bird learns to fly by flying, <br/>
A monkey learns to swing through the trees by swinging, <br/>
In all of the animal world each species learns from their mommies and <br/>
daddies, <br/>
and in packs&lt;Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, etc.&gt;<br/>
But yet some Humans think if we are left to our own devices, our children <br/>
will fail to learn, we are not capable.<br/>
Have any of you ever seen a school to teach a bird how to FLY????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry....just had to vent : )<br/>
If anyone has that poem or saying can you send it to me PLEASE????</div>
