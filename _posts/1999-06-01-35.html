What is the reference for the following quotation from your web site?<br/>
It does not sound like Winnie the Pooh to me.    Dale<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If anybody wants to clap,&quot; said Eeyore when he had read this, &quot;now is<br/>
the time to do it.&quot;<br/>
They all clapped.<br/>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Eeyore. &quot;Unexpected and gratifying, if a little<br/>
lacking in Smack.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s much better than mine,&quot; said Pooh admirably, and he really thought<br/>
it was.<br/>
&quot;Well,&quot; explained Eeyore modestly &quot;it was meant to be.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>sorry to butt in, that&#39;s definitely winnie the pooh!<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s in the last story in &#39;house at pooh corner.&#39; eeyore has just delivered<br/>
his goodbye poem to christopher robin.<br/>
<br/>
i must say you show highly developed taste in winnie the pooh - that<br/>
particular story is uncharacteristically sentimental in places, and so<br/>
doesn&#39;t have the same groovy taoist style as the others, so maybe that&#39;s why<br/>
you thought it wasn&#39;t real.<br/>
<br/>
um... and hello unschoolers!<br/>
