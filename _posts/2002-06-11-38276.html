<div id="ygrps-yiv-1231079655">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
The eclipse is happening right now here in Davis, Ca. We are home with sick <br/>
kids. As I searched the web for ways to view the eclipse, I looked on my <br/>
floor and we had a hundred big images of the solar eclipse right on the rug. <br/>
The sun was filtered by the grape leaves on the arbor. My image to verify <br/>
that yes this was the eclipse was about 100th the size of the ones on the <br/>
floor. Very cool. My son had images on his legs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-521567438">How cool, we drove about thirty minutes to lake Michigan to get a look, by <br/>
the time we got there the clouds moved in and the temp dropped to 69 from 83 <br/>
at home.  Needless to say we had to head back without seeing a thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075994664">We did the mask around the binoculars thing and projected it onto a <br/>
wall.  It was very cool, but unfortunaley we forgot the camera at <br/>
home.  BUMMER!  Well it was a great experience anyway:)<br/>
