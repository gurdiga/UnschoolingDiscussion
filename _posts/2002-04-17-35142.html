<div id="ygrps-yiv-775121294">Chaelene would LOOVE something like that.  I am so glad you suggested that.<br/>
The large animal vet that comes out for our horses is married to another<br/>
veterinarian who has a small animal clinic here in town.  I will check this<br/>
out.<br/>
Thanks so much.<br/>
