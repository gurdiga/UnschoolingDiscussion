&lt;&lt;I would like to hear from those of you who employ (or have employed) <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I unschool all my children:  Lia (6), JoAnn(7), Paige (10), Antonio (11), and <br/>
Emily (15).  One of the things that kept me a relaxed/eclectic homeschooler <br/>
for a while was that I had so many children, and I thought that as a <br/>
unschooler, I just naturally wouldn&#39;t give each child enough attention.  Well, I was <br/>
definitely wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
Now it is so much easier to give each child what they need at the moment.  My <br/>
children do what they want when they want...while still respecting the others <br/>
they live with (their siblings and me.)  Sometimes this means that I&#39;m not <br/>
available for help right away because I&#39;m helping someone else.  That&#39;s OK.  <br/>
That&#39;s just part of being a big family. (I&#39;m a single parent too, so I don&#39;t have <br/>
a *helper*.)  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily, most of my children are able to explore their interests on their <br/>
own.  They are very independent.  But I have become very adept at multitasking <br/>
too!  Lately Lia (who cannot read very much yet) has taken an interest in <br/>
writing.  I&#39;ve developed the ability to spell words while doing pretty much anything <br/>
else at the same time.  All my kids like to join me in the kitchen, and the <br/>
older ones enjoy spending time with the younger ones most of the time.  We all <br/>
have our own strengths and weaknesses so I think that we really all help each <br/>
other.  For example, right now, Emily is helping me explore my interests in <br/>
graphic design and dancing.  JoAnn often does the spelling for Lia.  Antonio <br/>
(the resident computer expert) helps all of us!<br/>
<br/>
I recently asked each of my kids, during a rare alone with me moment,  how <br/>
they felt about the *radical unschooling* (I&#39;ve only extended the philosophy to <br/>
bedtimes, food, and chores since about Oct. 2003.)  They were all so happy and <br/>
had no reservations.  Matter of fact, I&#39;ve noticed a few of them have started <br/>
referring to school as *juvenile jail*.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147022957">We have four (ages 4-13). I have a Pocket PC with our calendar, shopping<br/>
lists, etc. Makes life a lot easier to remember who goes where, and<br/>
when!<br/>
 <br/>
We have several families with whom we swap kids, so not all of the<br/>
adults take all of the kids to all of the places they want to go. This<br/>
gives my girls a chance to go and do much more than if I felt I needed<br/>
to accompany them everywhere. Gives them a bit of independence, and<br/>
saves money too.<br/>
 <br/>
The girls help pay for their stuff at times - just depends on my budget,<br/>
their budget, the particular activity, etc. They&#39;re game for saving for<br/>
something that&#39;s just for their fun, and may cost more than what I want<br/>
to spend.<br/>
 <br/>
Probably the biggest thing is realizing that I can&#39;t be everywhere with<br/>
all of the girls, and have any time to myself. I want them to see me<br/>
learning and doing stuff that I like to do. Sometimes they can join<br/>
in... I knit - one likes to do that with me, a couple like to be in the<br/>
room but doing something else, one doesn&#39;t care. Sometimes I have an<br/>
interest on my own, and they see me learning and growing in that area<br/>
apart from their proclivities.<br/>
 <br/>
Each girl and I have at least one area that we both are interested in<br/>
together, so I purpose to do that thing with that girl when I have the<br/>
chance. It just sort of works itself out... but the main thing is that<br/>
I&#39;m not the glue that holds it all together - having to be and do it<br/>
all. The family is more like a web of interconnectedness, and I just<br/>
coordinate the calendar :-)<br/>

sometimes feel chained to my car, find myself digging in the couch for <br/>
change to pay for stuff and wonder if we&#39;ll ever have a free Saturday <br/>
again. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The hardest part for us is paying for all they want to do and driving <br/>
them to their various activities. I have several who love to play <br/>
sports (three during the spring), one who takes art lessons, two who <br/>
are in drama, another who has a cookie business and we&#39;re a part of a <br/>
co-op.<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep a family calendar and we juggle the finances by expecting <br/>
more contributions toward their interests by the older ones who can <br/>
earn and less from the younger ones. We try to keep sports to one per <br/>
child per year, but that isn&#39;t totally working now that we have a <br/>
couple who are really into what they play. So we keep juggling.<br/>
<br/>
During the weeks at home, the older two pretty much follow their <br/>
interests on their own, with dialog and support. The younger three <br/>
spend the days with me and we do stuff together - reading aloud, <br/>
drawing, hiking, playing games, watching movies, cooking.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest adjustment for me has been to realize that I don&#39;t have to <br/>
&quot;make&quot; anything happen. I just need to be available. As interests <br/>
develop, I support as far as I can. One of our kids loves astronomy and <br/>
has wanted to go to Space Camp for the last two years. My husband <br/>
helped him start a cookie business and this kid (now 12) has earned <br/>
over $700 selling cookies in our neighborhood to pay for camp. When we <br/>
were cash poor and my two older kids wanted to do Vintage Dance <br/>
lessons, we offered to post flyers every week in different <br/>
neighborhoods and they waived the fees.<br/>
<br/>
We have several computers (keep collecting more), we have X Box, we <br/>
have DVR and two TVs. I recommend multiple everything so that there <br/>
aren&#39;t unnecessary conflicts over who gets to watch, play what and <br/>
when.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve learned that with five kids, motivation must come from within <br/>
them. We support them as far as we can, but they are the ones to <br/>
practice or follow an interest. I&#39;m an avid bird watcher and have a son <br/>
who enjoys it too. I just do what I do with birds. He&#39;s welcome to <br/>
participate or not. He does. The others only show mild interest, and <br/>
that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
Rambliing, but hope that helps a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430295221">We have 5 children.  I have found that for us the key is that I make sure I<br/>
get enough sleep.<br/>
<br/>
What does not work in our home is me being involved in everything everyone<br/>
is doing at all times.  There just isn&#39;t enough of me to go around and it<br/>
turns into a fight between the younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
They pretty much do what they want, often together, sometimes alone, and I<br/>
&quot;touch base&quot; with them often throughout the day.  But when I &quot;touch base&quot;, I<br/>
am 100% in the moment with them, asking questions I am truly interested in,<br/>
making comments from the heart, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Over time, some of the kids have become interested in things the other kids<br/>
are doing.  Two are competitive gymnasts, 3 are huge into 4-h.<br/>
<br/>
We have found that we do have to limit the number of outside activities per<br/>
kid somewhat simply do to logistics.  Even so, on some Wednesday evenings,<br/>
we have 4 different places we are supposed to be at the same time.  So we do<br/>
the best we can.<br/>
<br/>
But most important, a sense of humor is such a good thing.  Things will be<br/>
very chaotic at times.  If any of you have seen the new &quot;Cheaper By the<br/>
Dozen&quot;, the kids laughed and laughed at how much that was like our family.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

is that if we did NOTHING else different from other families at all, <br/>
unschooling still would be vastly better for our kids than schooling, just because they <br/>
can get enough sleep at the right times for their needs, to be centered and <br/>

<br/>
I agree with you. The body grows and heals when we sleep. Those poor schooled <br/>
teens----up at 6:00, schooled until 3:00, afterschool programs until 5 or <br/>
6:00, homework for 2-3 hours and supper. Plus somehow they have to squeeze in <br/>
those seven hours of decompression TV everyday. Only to get up at 6:00 the next <br/>
mroning.<br/>
<br/>
How do they DO that???<br/>
