I used to think this too, but I think it depends a lot on the<br/>
circumstances.  If she wanted to go to a 4 week-long sleep-over summer<br/>
camp, you would probably give a lot of thought to the environment there,<br/>
her age and maturity level, her reasons for wanting to go, etc., instead<br/>
of just saying that she can go because she wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
When my 8yr dd wanted to try school, we sat together and made a list of<br/>
what it was about school that she wanted to experience and then talked<br/>
about the pros and cons of those things and other ways to meet those<br/>
needs/desires.<br/>
<br/>
You know your child best, so give it a lot of thought and do what you<br/>
think is best for her.<br/>

In the huge rush to build shopping malls and banks,<br/>
no one is thinking about where kids can play.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t generate tax revenue.<br/>
