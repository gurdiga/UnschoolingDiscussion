<div id="ygrps-yiv-341138672">Dear All,<br/>
    Thanks for all of the insights and wonderful book and website<br/>
recommendations.  I found it all to be enlightening to say the least.<br/>
Sorry if my question derailed some of our discussions away from<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling in particular.  Sandra&#39;s original post<br/>
just got me thinking.  (Oh how my husband hates when I &quot;get to<br/>
thinking.&quot;)  Thanks again and sorry for getting so far off track.<br/>
Caroline in LA</div>
