these squiggles and rules into my head without ever telling me what I <br/>
was supposed to be doing!  I could cry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVED your whole post Sorcha! I can totally relate.<br/>
I had a math epiphany lately about cubic yards. I just couldn&#39;t get how there <br/>
were 27 cubes in a Square yard!! I kept saying &quot;but it&#39;s three across and <br/>
three down, HOW can that equal 27&quot; completely not able to &quot;see&quot; the depth of <br/>
it.<br/>
My dh drew a picture and explained it to me.<br/>
AHA!! Maybe if they&#39;d slowed down and put it all into REAL terms, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have struggled so badly in school and have all these hang ups now.<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>

years old and discovered men, pot and LSD, I always thought I had fried my <br/>
brain cells and wrote if off to that, but what you people are describing is <br/>
making sense to me. I think I am traumatized about math, as I adored it as a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003652367">The book is Mathematical Sorcery: Revealing the Secrets of Numbers <br/>
and the author is Calvin C. Clawson.  I&#39;m traumatized about math too, <br/>
but I&#39;m trying to get over it.  I got a Kindergarten math workbook <br/>
out of the library a few months ago and started to have a panic <br/>
attack just looking at all the problems.  It&#39;s not the difficulty of <br/>
the problems that got me, just the fact that it was page after page <br/>
of them.  Luckily my son is not math-traumatized.  He likes to play <br/>
with his &quot;letters and numbers&quot; and doesn&#39;t consider one more fun than <br/>
the other.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed my mom about this and I got an email from her saying that <br/>
what I should do is put my kids in public school, go to graduate <br/>
school for a masters in education, become a teacher, and reform <br/>
education from the inside out.  Gag, gag, wretch.  I told her that <br/>
homeschooling was on the cutting edge of education reform, but, as is <br/>
the pattern every single time I mention homeschooling, her response <br/>
was to change the subject entirely.<br/>

Ah, but Barbie must be reasonably adept at math and sciences. Her many<br/>
careers include Pediatrician, Veterinarian and Astronaut.<br/>
<br/>
In fact I am convinced that Barbie is the ultimate unschooler/life<br/>
learner. Not only has she investigated every career under the sun, she<br/>
still finds time to be involved in a wide variety of sports, the arts,<br/>
charity work AND to hang out and play with her younger sisters. Of<br/>
course her parents seem a little absent. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*The Primal Teen: What the New Discoveries About the Teenage Brain Tell Us<br/>
About Our Kids*, by Barbara Strauch.<br/>
<br/>
Evidentally, this book provides a great deal of<br/>
evidence for growth and new abilities in the brains of teenagers, and<br/>
specifically for a growth spurt at about 15.<br/>
<br/>
I have it on request at the library.<br/>
<br/>
AND THen- from a friend on another list:<br/>
<br/>
I just heard Joseph Chilton Pearce give a talk, and he was saying that the<br/>
growth spurt at 15 is in the prefrontal area of the brain (the newest part<br/>
of the brain, which was considered unused and not relevant only a few years<br/>
ago.)  I believe he was saying that this is the part of the brain that<br/>
communicates with the heart (whose major function is really neurological --<br/>
60-65% of the heart cells are neurons.)  So potentially, the major<br/>
development from 15-21 is for universal or heart connections.  Certainly<br/>
looking at the world from a different perspective than most of us do.  The<br/>
other key to developing our potential is that we need living models, so the<br/>
body can entrain with someone who is actually using or experiencing the<br/>
parts of the brain/heart which are being developed in the child/young adult.<br/>
<br/>
There is also another major growth spurt at 21, which he suggests is where<br/>
we are evolutionarily designed to go... but don&#39;t make it because of the<br/>
lack of entrainment within our cultures.  We never really get to the point<br/>
where we are using our prefrontal and our heart minds, so who knows what<br/>
would be possible!<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s no wonder that teenagers are crazy.  They are biologically designed<br/>
to experience something really BIG -- universal connections with their<br/>
minds and their hearts.  And what do they experience instead?  No wonder<br/>
they feel rage.<br/>
<br/>

I think there&#39;s another kind of brain-spurt of some sort around 30/32.  <br/>
People can understand philosophy.  I don&#39;t mean read about philosophers and <br/>
repeat back what their major contributions to thought were.  I mean they <br/>
become philosophical themselves (if they want) and can understand things at a <br/>
level which encompasses a depth of space and time.  <br/>
<br/>
People under 30 get really irate when I say that.  I just wait patiently for <br/>
them to turn 32 and say &quot;Oh; sorry; I know now what you meant.&quot;<br/>

unschooled people wax philosophical sooner than schooled ones? Because they <br/>

I didn&#39;t believe it until I got to the over-40 range and looked back and saw <br/>
one person after another come out of the choppy waters of confusion and into <br/>
some kind of calm around 30.  Something changed.  Maybe there&#39;s a <br/>
relationship to school, but some of them were drop outs and some professional <br/>
students.   They cared about things they hadn&#39;t cared about before.  They had <br/>
stopped caring about some things they had cared about earlier.  It was like <br/>
seeing the clouds from a jet after all those years of just seeing them from <br/>
the ground or something.<br/>

<br/>
Figured it out myself from having SCA students.  In the Society for Creative <br/>
Anachronism, much of the teaching of squires and apprentices has to do with <br/>
philosophy.  My husband has had several squires, I&#39;ve had some students, and <br/>
if they&#39;re in their teens or 20&#39;s it&#39;s like trying to push a rope.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people who have hung around us and been frustrated with <br/>
philosophical principals and said &quot;That&#39;s just Stupid, though!&quot; will go away <br/>
grumpy, but come back in their early 30&#39;s, saying &quot;Could you tell me that <br/>
thing again, about integrity?&quot;  (or whatever)<br/>
<br/>
I used to read zen stuff  in my 20s and it was like trying to learn math at <br/>
15!  But in my 30&#39;s the very same books made clear sense.<br/>
<br/>
And (with emotion-free apologies to any to whom it applies, and I don&#39;t know <br/>
of any off hand) in unschooling discussions, often the most stridently d<br/>
efensive are among the youngest moms.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just easier to think &quot;maybe so&quot; instead of &quot;NO DAMNED WAY&quot; after <br/>
30, for a lot of reasons.   I don&#39;t know why I think it is yet, but since I <br/>
got the idea maybe a dozen years ago, I&#39;ve seen lots of evidence to support <br/>
it and nothing has caused me to amend the theory or the &quot;gate age.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Great, so where do I go from here, now that it is no longer a reason?&lt;g&gt;<br/>
The brain thing makes sense. I watched a show on the local knowledge network <br/>
taht discussed the brain dev. of teenagers, and it talked about the only time <br/>
in a human<br/>
&#39;s life that we go through as much brain development and change as when we <br/>
are infants, occurs during adolesence.I believe it, hence the talk of aliens <br/>
that take over the bodies of teens etc. , yet the kids I see with supportive <br/>
and communicative families seem to weather these changes well, I am hoping th <br/>
at is the key and will save my kids the heartaches I went through. Not that <br/>
they won&#39;t try stuff, just that I will be ;there  for them to talk to if they <br/>
need me.<br/>

It helps that she gets answers to her questions and has never once yet been <br/>

Oh, yeah.  Barbara Sher, who does some motivational shows on PBS about<br/>

<br/>
Come to think of it, I was almost 30 when I had Conor. So maybe <br/>
forget the squeezing out the babies part. &lt;g&gt; But by that point I did <br/>
have a husband and a home and had been out of school and working for <br/>
9 years. So I had been doing all that life stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, in retrospect, I just always assumed it was having a baby <br/>
that produced a change in my outlook. Maybe it was the brain spurt. <br/>
Although I do know Jon and I had been considering big life changes <br/>
even before we had kids. We were planning our move out west when I <br/>
found out I was pregnant.<br/>

<br/>
Absolutely. I&#39;ve seen a huge development in Conor this past year, 13-<br/>
14. I&#39;ll keep my eye on him again at 15. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not disagreeing with the brain spurt idea, just pondering on some <br/>

Keith and I were talking about this, about whether it might not be true of <br/>
unschooled kids when they turn 30 (and I&#39;m dead and no longer paying <br/>
attention to my little theory &lt;g&gt;).  We couldn&#39;t see similarities in the <br/>
