<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347794391">Isn&#39;t there a poem about fingerprints on the glass and no more dandelion bouquets?  Does that sound familiar, does anyone know the name of it?<br/>
                                                                                      Deb K.        <br/>

...I know those of you with toddlers are hoping for them to GET BIG, but I have <br/>
  big kids, and I would love to have one of them be three for a day or two, or <br/>
  an hour, or a minute.<br/>
<br/>
  And now I cried.    They&#39;re all not even in the house right now.  Kirby&#39;s at <br/>
  work, Marty&#39;s helping an adult friend of mine unload a truck (for money and <br/>
  lunch!) and Holly&#39;s off riding bikes with another homeschooler.  <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m going to go read a magazine and feel sorry for myself and wish I had some <br/>
  little kids to come wake me up from a nap.<br/>
