<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521963980">We&#39;ve been busy.  <br/>
There was a death in the family, a little cousin, and we had family here<br/>
for the funeral from everywhere. <br/>
We were baby sitting pug puppies for five days.  That was moist. <br/>
We&#39;ve been swimming and playing piano and painting.<br/>
We&#39;ve been here and there doing this and that.<br/>
<br/>
One of the here and there&#39;s, this and that&#39;s was the third annual &quot;Punkin<br/>
Chunkin&quot; in Missoula.<br/>
Otherwise normal people get together to build air cannons and trebuchet&#39;s<br/>
and such to fling pumpkins in a farmer&#39;s field.<br/>
This kind of thing speaks to my son.  <br/>
We went early so he could look at everything and talk to the folks who<br/>
made these strange contraptions.  One trebuchet was fashioned after the<br/>
Trojan Rabbit from Monty Python.  Dylan liked that.<br/>
We stood around in the cold drinking coffee and hot chocolate watching<br/>
test firings and misfires and record pumpkin launches for five hours.  <br/>
The winning air cannon, Gourds in Space, with a sixty foot barrel, shot a<br/>
pumpkin over 3,100 feet.  No one ever told me what exactly one does with<br/>
a sixty foot air cannon for the other 364 days of the year, but maybe<br/>
that doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>
The winner in the trebuchet&#39;s and others category was an &quot;other&quot;.  It was<br/>
a kind of big sling shot and fired a pumpkin four hundred and some feet. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you have to be ten to appreciate this.   David and Dylan have been<br/>
planning and thinking about a trebuchet for a year now.  I suspect there<br/>
is some pumpkin flinging in our future.   At least I hope it&#39;s only<br/>
pumpkins. <br/>
<br/>
We went that same day Oct, 26, to a corn maze, spookified for Halloween. <br/>
 That was wonderful and scary and I did more screaming than anyone.   We<br/>
found a haunted house that night, too and were chased around buy creepy<br/>
guys with chain saws, and little kids with silly string.    It was a good<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan is working on a comic strip to go into the magazine a girl on the<br/>
local MT unschoolers list is making.   <br/>
He&#39;s having some trouble getting everything just right.   I&#39;ve been<br/>
listening to story lines all day as he tries to decide on the best one. <br/>
<br/>
He asked if he could make up the menu for Thanksgiving and so far all I<br/>
know for sure is we&#39;re having corn chips and salsa.&lt;g&gt;   I hope our<br/>
guests have a sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re having friends over tomorrow to make paper.  We&#39;ve been collecting<br/>
onion skins and scrap paper for awhile and need to do something with it. <br/>
 That should be sticky and messy and fun. <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is having a good week.<br/>

You may happen to come during a cold front that brings rain or wind, or you<br/>
may experience high pressure and warm, beautiful days like we have now. It&#39;s<br/>
currently 87 degrees in Phoenix and we&#39;ve been breaking 100 year records for<br/>
high temperatures!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, be prepared for cold nights and relatively warm, pleasant days -<br/>
that&#39;s what I would recommend.<br/>
<br/>
And as your trip gets closer, check out this website which gives you the<br/>
current weather (most anywhere in the world) and the 7 day forecast, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103836392">When you go to Death Valley, you *have* to go down into one of the canyons <br/>
- that&#39;s where the beautiful stuff is!  The rest is mostly flat, dry and, <br/>
well, flat.  Also be sure you have plenty of gas.<br/>
We were there in early October and it was pretty toasty still (but not <br/>
boiling.)  It should be almost liveable this time of year.<br/>

Try to go to the the giant sand dunes (awesome!).  Also, Scotty&#39;s <br/>
Castle is beautiful (although not a &#39;castle&#39; in an English sense of <br/>

Pug puppies have these little punched in noses and such funny faces that<br/>
you hold them right up to look at them and every time they exhale you get<br/>
sprayed.  They sneeze a lot too, but only when you&#39;re eyeball to eyeball.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s always something wet at the other end, too.  <br/>

coffee grinder, (coffee tastes a little like root beer this morning!) and<br/>
stirred it into the slurry.   It made the paper a wonderful color, with<br/>
tiny freckles and it smells good enough to eat!<br/>
We still have onion skins and sage meadow seeds and rosemary left for a<br/>
batch today.   There&#39;s paper<br/>
everywhere this morning and I&#39;ve already told my husband I may need a new<br/>
iron for Christmas as the goo on the bottom of mine seems to be<br/>
permanent.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve done lots of crafts with irons, and made mistakes with materials, and <br/>
been slopy with stitch-witchery, and ironed over what I shouldn&#39;t have in <br/>
various ways for years.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really?  My husband, may he long be praised but may he also think a little <br/>
first, used my beautiful *cordless* , steam-with-a-button, no-stick iron <br/>
(that I won several years ago) to glue some laminate while making a gift <br/>
for me.  Wood glue all over and cooked onto the bottom, then bits of fuzz <br/>
and wood stuck into that.  This mess is nothing like hitting a bit of <br/>
stitchwitch...  I love him and he was only trying to help, but good lord <br/>
honey, you couldn&#39;t have used a cheapo iron instead of my nice one?<br/>
(and sure, I only use it maybe once a year for going out fancy or weddings <br/>
or something, but still...)<br/>
Do you think it could be fixed?<br/>
