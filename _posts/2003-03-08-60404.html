&lt;&lt; I could really write a book, but I&#39;ll stop now.  :-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ugh. That sounds really awful Sorcha.<br/>
I was lucky on this issue. I do remember my Mom making me eat a little of <br/>
everything when I was younger, but then she got on this &quot;no thank you&quot; bite <br/>
thing and decided that was good enough.<br/>
We had to take ONE little taste of everything at the table. Just to see if we <br/>
might like it, but other than that there was no issue about eating everything.<br/>
I do remember my Mom cleaning up our plates after us though, and having <br/>
struggles with weight!! So she couldn&#39;t totally let go of some of the damage <br/>
she recieved, but she did try to incorporate new ideas into her parenting <br/>
style at least.<br/>
My kids are encouraged to try new things, but never, ever forced to put <br/>
anything in their mouth they don&#39;t want to.<br/>
Usually they will though. Because they HAVEN&#39;T been forced.<br/>
I did try the &quot;no thank you&quot; bit crap when Trevor and Jared were younger. <br/>
Since that all stopped, they&#39;ve been much more likely to try weird foods. <br/>
Unschooling has saved a lot of kids from unecessary torture. ugh.<br/>

*I* do if I don&#39;t like something! Why would anybody keep something that&#39;s <br/>
icky in his mouth? <br/>

My &quot;guarantee&quot; on tasting things was they could spit it in my hand if they <br/>
didn&#39;t like it, and I would take it away.  They didn&#39;t even have to run <br/>
gagging to the trashcan.  A few times, a kid did take me up on that, and to <br/>
drop it gently in your hand after a taste isn&#39;t nearly nasty.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve since made the same offer to adult friends.  &quot;If you try it and you hate <br/>
it, you can spit it in my hand,&quot; and I hold my hand out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yes, we usually have the trash can nearby for those instances though, or a <br/>
plate.<br/>
But usually, if they&#39;re really unsure, I just tell them to touch it with <br/>
their tongue and see if it warrants further testing.<br/>
That usually gets them curious enough to try stuff.<br/>
If they don&#39;t want to even with that offer, I don&#39;t say a thing.<br/>
And interestingly enough, my pickiest eater will usually try something if he <br/>
sees us eat it joyfully often enough.<br/>
He thought he&#39;d would hate fish....but he positively devours Salmon now!<br/>
