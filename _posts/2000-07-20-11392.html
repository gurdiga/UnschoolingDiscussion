<div id="ygrps-yiv-386447861">Eiraul, I knew I liked you! Now I know why-your story sounds so much like <br/>
mine!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest boy was much the same-in the 5th grade at ps, my first parent <br/>
teacher conference had 2 teachers and the principal present to confront me <br/>
about how Rick was getting no score lower than a 95 from tests and classroom <br/>
work, but when they averaged in the homework that never seemed to make it to <br/>
class (although I was wasting all of our evenings making him do it) he was <br/>
getting D&#39;s. One teacher actually cried and said &quot;I&#39;m just afraid he&#39;s not <br/>
getting the practice he needs&quot;. Excuse me, but if you can get a 98 without <br/>
homework, why do you need it?<br/>
<br/>
Public school took up our entire lives, it seemed. If they weren&#39;t at <br/>
school, then they were doing homework or getting ready for school. Not to <br/>
mention all the times I had to race 20 miles to town to get something that <br/>
they just had to have for school tomorrow. Absentee policy was also a <br/>
problem for me, as the school and I disagreed on the importance of just <br/>
taking a day off to have some quality time alone with your mom. Now, where I <br/>
live, parents are even being taken to court and fined for school <br/>
absences-its a good thing we got out when we did!<br/>
<br/>
Your younger son sounds alot like mine-I call him an unschoolers dream <br/>
child! He only went to ps for k and 1st grade, not enough to rob him of his <br/>
innate capacity to learn naturally-just because he wants to know. He also <br/>
was late to ride a bike! He reads alot, has fun with numbers, remembers how <br/>
to spell words easily, and is happy and free to be himself.<br/>
<br/>
I still worry that they are not doing enough actual school work sometimes, <br/>
that they will never learn to write, as it is something that the boys never <br/>
seem to want to do. I still hold out hope that when they get a bit older and <br/>
want to meet more kids on the net they will need to communicate in writing <br/>
and will then learn it-as everything else, when they decide they need to <br/>
know, they will learn.<br/>
<br/>
We do quite a bit of running around, there are alot of hsers in our area, <br/>
and many opportunities for classes and group activities. I also work 4 days <br/>
a week, so although I certainly do not envy your illness, I would like more <br/>
time to just talk as it seems to be our best learning time also. The years <br/>
when they were little and I stayed home were so full of joy for us all. Then <br/>
we may have only gone to town once a week-now it seems I am driving all the <br/>
time. I am trying to wean us all off of the constant running so that I can <br/>
drop at least one more day of work. But as soon as I think that, I get an <br/>
email about gym day and think, Oh, wouldn&#39;t that be fun! (I am still trying <br/>
to decide on that one)<br/>
<br/>
I love hearing about your oldest son. It is so reassuring to know that it <br/>
pays off and I think about these kids often when I have my doubtful days.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844111203">Eiarul, thank you so much for sharing your experiences.  There is alot of<br/>
hope and encouragement for those of us who are starting after years in ps.<br/>

&gt; Relaxing enough to trust that we will learn &#39;enough&#39;!  I&#39;m figuring out<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &quot;IT&quot; doesn&#39;t all have to be learned in 8 years or 12 years or 20 years.<br/>
&gt; Whatever we don&#39;t cover while my children are in my care, they will learn<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; their own in years to come.  I&#39;m still learning about the world around me<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; have every reason to expect they will do the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW, my unschooling experiences started with a stubborn teenager who<br/>
refused<br/>
&gt; to cooperate with any formal schooling...at home or in a ps setting.  At<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; point I figured my choices were to protect our relationship and wait for<br/>
him </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>Gee, you don&#39;t live in the Puyallup, WA school district, do you?!  It was the <br/>
worst we&#39;ve ever seen about this.  Other places had no problem with our <br/>
taking a day off as long as I let them know our son would be absent.<br/>
<br/>
Problems in that school district started with our keeping him out of school <br/>
the day we moved (we had been living with his g&#39;parents in Puyallup, finally <br/>
found a home of our own and had to go across the mountains (2 hours one way) <br/>
to retrieve our belongings.  We planned to do it on Saturday, but the pass <br/>
was closed, so we had to take care of it on Monday.   The school district <br/>
SECRETARY had a cow.  We went round and round and round with that secretary.  <br/>
If DS was absent and we sent a note, she insisted she needed a phone call <br/>
instead.  So the next time we would call and she would insist she needed a <br/>
note.  Always declaring that she only needed one or the other.  At one point <br/>
she refused to allow DS into his classes until he called me and I verified <br/>
the note he had presented to her.  At a later date she claimed that she NEVER <br/>
kept ANY child from attending class for this issue.  In fact, it went so far <br/>
as a letter from the school principal chewing ME out and telling me I was to <br/>
quit harrassing their school secretary!!!  I couldn&#39;t get away fast enough.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-168660371">My child last year had a med reaction that resulted in a severly lowered <br/>
white blood count, so couldn&#39;t go to school until we got it up.  It took 3 <br/>
weeks.  I got harrassed even though I had a doctors note, one for each day he <br/>
was out, because we went daily for a blood test.  His teacher refused to give <br/>
me his work to keep up, and I am a certified teacher.  I am going to <br/>
homeschool this year.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope, we are in Ohio. When we first started into school, I would call and <br/>
say that we are taking a personal day-I didn&#39;t want the kids to think it was <br/>
okay to lie-and they didn&#39;t say a word. Now though, I don&#39;t think that would <br/>
cut it!<br/>
