 My brother-in-law fell down at the state fair a couple of days ago and broke <br/>
his nose, requiring eight stiches. He has bruises and lacerations all over <br/>
his face. Everyone in the family knows he was drunk, but his wife (also a <br/>
drunk) neglected to mention that fact when she called to say why they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be attending a family birthday party. They both, the sil especially, <br/>
are capable of drinking enormous amounts and not appearing to be intoxicated. <br/>
I&#39;m tired of the charade and of the powerlessness the rest of us feel about <br/>
their situation. Sigh. &gt;&gt;<br/>

    We had several calls over the course of my childhood from my father about <br/>
how he fell asleep driving and had an accident. I figured it out by the time <br/>
I was 12 or so and had to drive to bars to pick my father up. Luckily living <br/>
w/ my mother in another state and learning to drive b/c we lived on a farm I <br/>
was able to do this on my yearly visits. Lovely.<br/>

   NICKI~ the late night love you and miss you calls were a bonus.</div>
