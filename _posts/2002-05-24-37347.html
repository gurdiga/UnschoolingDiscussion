<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052757383">Yes, a soda bottle.  We cut a hole in the plywood that was off-set <br/>
from the top of the volcano so we could slip the bottle in and out but <br/>
still have it resting on the plywood when it was in.  The volcano was <br/>
a bit taller than the bottle so we just propped it on a block of wood.<br/>

&gt; What did you use inside the chicken wire frame to hold the baking <br/>
soda? A<br/>
&gt; soda bottle? I guess I&#39;ll be going to HOme Depot instead of Walmart <br/>
today!<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the advice.<br/>

One tip, if you use straight baking soda and vinegar for your <br/>
eruptions it is rather spectacular.  It acts somewhat like a stromboli <br/>
eruption.  If you add a bit of dishsoap to the solution the eruption <br/>
is more steady (and I can&#39;t think of the name of that type of eruption <br/>
to save my life right now!) like Mt Kilowea (I suspect that is spelled <br/>
wrong)<br/>
We build ours on a plywood base out, with a chicken wire frame and <br/>
that plater wrap stuff they sell in the craft stores - looks like the <br/>
stuff they used to make casts out of.  They we painted it with acrylic <br/>
paints and sealed it with polyurethane sealer.  It lasted for years!<br/>
