<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>14 Apr 2003, at  4:47am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117625541">Would you let your kids go just ANYWHERE they wanted to go?  Skinhead rally?  <br/>
Cock-fights?  My kids have never gone anywhere without talking to me about it <br/>
first, and darned if they don&#39;t care about my opinion.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a sincere question for anyone here.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that you have bent over backwards to be respectful of your children, and give them the freedom they need to make decisions, what *would* you do if your child wanted to go to a skinhead rally or do something else objectionable?  <br/>
<br/>
I realize that some of you will answer that its not an issue at your home.  But it *is* an issue here at the present moment and I could use some ideas.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have a sincere question for anyone here.<br/>
 Assuming that you have bent over backwards to be respectful of your<br/>
children, and give them the freedom they need to make decisions, what<br/>
*would* you do if your child wanted to go to a skinhead rally or do<br/>
something else objectionable?<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t quite get this either really.  Some here say their children aren&#39;t<br/>
the kind of children that would do objectionable things like searching porno<br/>
sites and seeking out dirty movies so I&#39;m not sure where cock fights and<br/>
skin head rallies come into play. Wouldn&#39;t they also be the kind of children<br/>
who wouldn&#39;t want these things either. If it was something they were curious<br/>
about, there are plenty ways to research it without going.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really say for sure as I haven&#39;t been in this situation but I would<br/>
do whatever I had to in keeping my child safe. And I mean that as in very<br/>
probable danger of some kind. Also that means getting in probable trouble<br/>
with the law. I would talk until I was blue in the face to try and make my<br/>
point. Not sure exactly what extremes I would go to after that but if it was<br/>
a safety issue, I would stop it somehow if I was able to. That would also<br/>
mean keeping someone away that I was in fear of.<br/>
