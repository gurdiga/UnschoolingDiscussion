<div id="ygrps-yiv-265519144">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Crys and I have been teaching and learning from Terry (3/31/97) <br/>
and Lapis (2/11/99) since the day they were born.  I would call it <br/>
unschooling if I had to call it anything, but if I really had to call it <br/>
something I would simply call it life &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I have been noticing that Lapis learns from Terry (who I have taken <br/>
to calling my assistant or little helper) who learns from her father <br/>
and I, who STILL learn from our parents &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to learn a great deal here.  Perhaps even meet parents in <br/>
the Katy/Sealy Texas area &lt;G&gt; ????<br/>

though.  I get the strangest looks......      :)<br/>

&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m Crys and I have been teaching and learning from Terry (3/31/97) <br/>
&gt; and Lapis (2/11/99) since the day they were born.  I would call it <br/>

&gt; something I would simply call it life &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Hi and Welcome!!<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if we could just call it life. &lt;G&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
