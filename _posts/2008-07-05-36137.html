I was looking for your personal email address, I have an Albuquerque favor to ask of you... <br/>
<br/>
I came across your blog.  I&#39;m sorry Flower is no longer with you.  However, I thought that was great that he was rescued...  It&#39;s a great story.<br/>
<br/>
Can you email me privately?<br/>
