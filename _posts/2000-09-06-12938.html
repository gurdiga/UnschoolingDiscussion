I have just the thing!  We actually bought a one room school house --- hand<br/>
hewn antique log school house from somewhere in West Virginia.  It was going<br/>
to become a really cool master bedroom if we hadn&#39;t gotten tired of the HEAT<br/>
in TX.  Now the 1850s cabin is for sale.  Either to be moved and set<br/>
assembled or to go with the ranch.  It&#39;s got a house already.  We just<br/>
wanted more space!<br/>

School is the worst way to provide for a child&#39;s -- any child&#39;s --<br/>
education.  And because I am sure to get flamed, I might as well say that of<br/>
course some people, single parents, those few families in which both parents<br/>
must work, or for those few families that just don&#39;t have the temperment,<br/>
must make provision for their children.  Personally, I would much rather see<br/>
those children in the arms of a nice cooperating homeschooling family during<br/>

Oh well, I think we&#39;d just turn it into a fabulous playhouse.  No sense <br/>

Dallas isn&#39;t that far.  I carried by 15 year old to dance in the big D.<br/>
People seemed rather amazed that a mom would travel that many hours and<br/>
miles for a DANCE.  Oh well, we unschoolers are a bit unconventional now<br/>
aren&#39;t we?!  But I have digressed!! Sorry<br/>
<br/>
Actually, there is a company in Fredericksburg called Timber & Stone that<br/>
scours the countryside looking for these old building.  They buy them,<br/>
disassemble them, bring them to Fredericksburg (where they have lots of them<br/>
setup) and basically have a showroom style setup.  One could buy one or<br/>
several and have a contractor design something really elaborate!  It was<br/>
going to be so cool to have a one room school house as our master ---a very<br/>
large master bedroom  27&#39; X 32&#39; (plus a loft our half).  Anyway, they<br/>
reassemble the cabin(s) for you at your location.  At that point you either<br/>
finish it yourself or bring in a contractor.<br/>
<br/>
The playhouse idea sounds pretty neat too!  If anyone is interested, it&#39;s<br/>
really neat!<br/>
