<div id="ygrps-yiv-339235072">I can utterly relate to the devastation caused by our health systems - or <br/>
lack thereof.  As a young, recently divorced mother I had a infant to care <br/>
for that battled numerous illnesses (bronchities, chronic ear infections, <br/>
asthma).  Even with the coverage we had the copays and deductibles nearly <br/>
broke me financially.  I thanked God every day that I had a very supportive <br/>
mother that didn&#39;t mind helping out financially.  At times I know the burden <br/>
was almost too much for her to bear.  Here I am now, nearly 10 years later, <br/>
in the same boat.  We pay over $400 a month for medical coverage that really <br/>
doesn&#39;t cover much.  Our copays are astronomical on top of this huge monthly <br/>
burden.  Getting decent care in this state seems to be too much to ask as <br/>
well.  Though my son outgrew most of the ailments that burdened us earlier - <br/>
now we have a whole new set of ailments that are frowned upon severely in <br/>
this medical community - mental health issues.  How quaint that our copay <br/>
increase only affected mental health prescriptions that don&#39;t happen to have <br/>
a generic version available.  Sorry to get on such a soap box, but this issue <br/>
is so near and dear to my heart and my every day life.  I truly believe there <br/>
has to be a better solution for available health care for all.<br/>

    You are not alone, we pay more than that for coverage that is sadly <br/>
lacking.<br/>
