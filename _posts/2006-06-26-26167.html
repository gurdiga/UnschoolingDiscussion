<div id="ygrps-yiv-475626707">I sometimes enjoy looking at people�s bookmarks, or websites that have tons<br/>
of categorized links, books, games, etc.  There are a few drawbacks to that<br/>
format that I found�<br/>
<br/>
One is that they are compiled by one person so only comprise what that<br/>
person thought was worthy of mention (or was paid advertising money to<br/>
mention).<br/>
<br/>
Another is that they are often outdated, bad links, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A third is that there is no ranking system or discussion about each link or<br/>
book, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Virtual Homeschool Group Resources (HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;http://resources.virtualhomeschoolgroup.com/&quot;http://resources.virtualhomesc<br/>
hoolgroup.com)  is my attempt to get a good community-based list of amazing<br/>
resources.  It has some cool features!<br/>
<br/>
-          Any user can submit any link, book, dvd, etc. and a description<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
-          Any user can vote on any link, book, dvd, etc. that someone else<br/>
has submitted to show that they too like that same resource.<br/>
<br/>
-          Any user can mark a link as bad or outdated with a simple click.<br/>
<br/>
-          Any user can add comments to a listed resource, and the comments<br/>
can also be ranked by helpfulness.<br/>
<br/>
-          Resources are categorized into broad categories, and are<br/>
searchable.<br/>
<br/>
-          They can also be �tagged� so there are an infinite number of<br/>
possibilities for subcategories too.<br/>
<br/>
-          If you like someone�s style, you can select certain users as your<br/>
�friends� and easily see what resources they submitted or voted for.<br/>
<br/>
-          You can add a bookmark to your �Links� section on your browser to<br/>
quickly add a favorite site to the VHSG Resources list!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope you agree that this has the potential to be an amazing resource in<br/>
itself!  Your child mentions an interest in something; you can easily see<br/>
what others have liked for that particular topic quickly and easily, and you<br/>
can add your own feedback as well.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The site is brand new, and only has my own personal favorites entered at<br/>
this moment, and not all of my personal favorites, but some. :-)  In order<br/>
to become a valuable resource, it needs users and submissions!  It is free<br/>
and easy to sign up, free and easy to add your favorites, everything about<br/>
it is free and easy!  I hope you will check it out, make an account, and add<br/>
some of your favorites today!!<br/>

Please feel free to pass this on to any homeschooling lists you think may be<br/>
interested :-)  There is no monetary gain involved for anybody in this<br/>
endeavor, it is simply a service for the homeschooling community at large.<br/>
