 </span></blockquote>Oh, yea, duh.  I didn&#39;t have my thinking cap on--LOL.<br/>
<br/>
My idea:  One thing that helped my daughter find her gift of writing was<br/>
Unlimited Use of the Computer.  Many parents are afraid of their children<br/>
meeting preditors online, so they limit it&#39;s use.  I don&#39;t mean limiting<br/>
time (although that happens, too), I mean limiting what their children are<br/>
allowed to use the computer for.  My computer is in the center of the house<br/>
where there is a lot of activity so I didn&#39;t worry so much about what<br/>
websites my daughter was going to.  Anyone walking by could see what she was<br/>
looking at.  She found a website called Fanfiction.net where people write<br/>
fictional stories using real cartoon characters and they critique each<br/>
other&#39;s stories.  It has been the greatest resource for teaching my daughter<br/>
spelling and grammar and it is what introduced her to poetry, her new love.<br/>
My daughter also talks to a lot of the authors on Yahoo Instant Messenger.<br/>
I did worry about who she was talking to so I just sat with her once in a<br/>
while.  I saw that no one was writing anything I didn&#39;t approve of.  These<br/>
kids range in age from about 12 to maybe 20.  My daughter has her friends<br/>
online now and she talks to two of them on the phone often.<br/>

<br/>
Until a few months ago, many sections of Fanfiction.net had X-rated (or <br/>
NC-17-rated) stories.  The policy was changed and the most explicit <br/>
stuff was removed, but many areas still do include R-rated stories.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t *expect* to find R-rated stories about cartoon characters, but <br/>
I don&#39;t know for sure.  I do know that there are stories about Harry <br/>
Potter where his hatred for Draco Malfoy is just a cover for their <br/>
mutual unresolved sexual attraction, and I *know* that not everybody is <br/>
expecting that when they let their kids read at this website.  FYI.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ll find a lot of my kids&#39; writing there &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
That IS their main form of writing--that and reviewing books on Amazon, which Roxana does a lot of, apparently.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie was just telling me today that she had a story up on fanfiction.net and people wrote her to say it was good but seemed not &quot;enough&quot; for a story. After a few of these comments, she thought about it more and decided it was really more of an &quot;introduction,&quot; so she began to add to it, to make it meatier.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read it and don&#39;t know the title or what its about or anything else. I think their ownership of all this writing they do is so awesome that I&#39;m very very careful about stepping in - I read when they offer it to me - sometimes they send me links. But if I purposely got into it - even just to observe - it would feel like parents hovering over younger children who are just trying to play pretend - making mudpies and playing house or whatever. As much fun as it is for some of us adults to watch kids play - it doesn&#39;t seem entirely &quot;right&quot; to me - it feels like we&#39;re using them for our entertainment (which is okay in small doses - we LOVE them and enjoy them, etc., but I also think we have to leave them alone and show we trust them to grow outside our constant watchfulness.  I mean - its a fine line I guess - and we have to use our own sense of how things are going in their lives and not be so out of touch that we don&#39;t even KNOW what their lives are like, of course. But I&#39;m in no danger of that and yet, I think the fact that the writing they do is so totally THEIRS - that it has absolutely NOTHING to do with writing to satisfy an adult - is an extra extra special and wonderful gift I can give them.<br/>
<br/>
So far it has panned out in terms of my kids LOVING to write - and becoming extremely proficient writers. But, truth is, that&#39;s not what motivated me to let their writing alone, not to even ask to see it, to be super cautious about even remotely seeming to be intruding. I just did it because it felt right - writing is private - asking to read something is like asking someone to tell you what she is thinking. They know I read - they know they can share what they write with me. I don&#39;t need to ask. And, sometimes they do - something they think I will like. Mostly they don&#39;t see their writing as the kind of thing I&#39;m usually into - and it doesn&#39;t occur to them that I&#39;d be interested just to observe how well they write - they aren&#39;t writing as an exercise, they aren&#39;t writing with the purpose of learning to write. They don&#39;t think of it that way and don&#39;t realize that I MIGHT think of it that way.  I think this is so cool. One of the things I feel like I did RIGHT in my journey of parenting/unschooling! <br/>
<br/>
As far as the porno thing - I&#39;m beginning to think that kids are going to have to learn to delete and ignore -- they just are stuck with that in their lives.<br/>
