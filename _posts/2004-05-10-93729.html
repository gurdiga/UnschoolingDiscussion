<div id="ygrps-yiv-305834781">&lt;&lt; What&#39;s scary is that a lot of the homeschooling faithful are as <br/>
<br/>
fueled<br/>
<br/>
by a fanatical, religion-based belief in their mission as Islamist<br/>
<br/>
terrorists, and seem to be just about as brainwashed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That sounds pretty informed to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Informed? About ONE segment of homeschoolers, sure. But an informed article would have been about more than one type of homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
He obviously based the entire article on what he&#39;d seen in HIS neighborhood, not on a broad base of different homeschooling families across the country. THAT&#39;S what makes it uninformed. He&#39;s lumping all homeschoolers together....overgeneralizing and stereotyping. That&#39;s a lame article for this reason.<br/>
<br/>
Just because it&#39;s uninformed and completely biased doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true of SOME homeschoolers. Yeah, a strong group of them, that are rising in numbers, but it&#39;s still a crappy piece of journalism at best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101863998">Also, I live in the Bible belt, where most all homeschooling families are doing it for religious reasons.  I haven&#39;t met very many of them where the kids are miserable and want to be in school. Overall, they&#39;re happy, well adjusted, interesting people. <br/>
And I know of NO families personally, that spend all day at home. Most of them are on the go a lot, doing really interesting things.<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with their religion, I don&#39;t like the way they school at home (even if a lot of them are relaxed), and I think they pass on definite biases to their children about &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, but for the most part, these kids are much happier than their schooled counterparts I meet.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no way that guy even took time to really understand the families he&#39;s writing about. Did he interview them, try to know what they really do all day? Maybe they are like the few fanatics I know down here, but maybe not. He didn&#39;t do enough research to prove diddly.<br/>

anywhere in there that I saw, to be trying to say something about all homeschoolers <br/>

<br/>
No, that&#39;s what makes it personal.<br/>
<br/>
What is uninformed is someone feigning surprise (or being honestly surprised? <br/>
 That would be WORSE) that such homeschoolers exist.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime something like that comes up public, half a dozen unschoolers (those <br/>
are the only people I tend to follow regularly or hear from, which is find <br/>
with me) start to sputter as though they do not believe such homeschoolers exist.<br/>
<br/>
MANY, hundreds of THOUSANDS and I hope not millions of those homeschoolers <br/>
exist.  They have big damned glossy magazines and HUGE conventions.  Not like <br/>
the little laid-back conventions unschoolers have sometimes when they&#39;re lucky, <br/>
but GIGANTIC state-fair sized insane kind of conventions.<br/>
<br/>
They do exist.  Darned if some non-homeschooler discovered some.  But he was <br/>
not uninformed.<br/>
<br/>
If we other homeschoolers are going to express opinions, please, PLEASE let <br/>
THOSE benorance.</div>

<br/>
We could lump all writers together and come to one conclusion and be just<br/>
as wrong as he was about homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If that&#39;s the worst you&#39;ve ever seen, stick around a few years.<br/>
 <br/>
If anyone were to go out all a-huff that that article is wrong, that<br/>
would <br/>
make homeschoolers look worse than just saying nothing.  Much of that<br/>
article is <br/>
bang on.<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have homeschooled seventeen years and some of the earlier articles were<br/>
pretty ignorant and biased like this one, but it&#39;s been awhile since I<br/>
saw anything wrote from such inner bitterness and not facts.  If the<br/>
writer wants to judge Christians (the part about the mom who put her<br/>
children into public school and reaped a disaster where I believe he<br/>
mentioned she threw them to the wolves made me wonder if the target may<br/>
have been those overly zealous Christians who helped pave the way for<br/>
such a horrid movement [tongue-in-cheek].  I believe the opening title<br/>
mentioned martyrs.)<br/>
<br/>
If his beef is with Christians then say so,but to lable a whole movement<br/>
with what I feel was ignorant bias means the article was pretty<br/>
worthless.  It was a big ole&#39; vent against his neighbors, for God know<br/>
whatever they did to him.  Maybe their kids didn&#39;t play with his kids?<br/>
&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see anything that was &quot;bang on&quot;.  See how opinions even among<br/>
homeschooler vary?  I don&#39;t mind, but at least the guy could get educated<br/>
on what certification does for helping students and get his facts<br/>
straight.<br/>
<br/>
So there&#39;s my big ole&#39; vent!<br/>
<br/>
God bless, Alice</div>

Baptist pushes resolution against public schools <br/>
<br/>
Charleston native proposes church measure calling on Christian <br/>
parents to spurn system <br/>
<br/>
BY DAVE MUNDAY <br/>
Of The Post and Courier Staff <br/>
A Charleston-born Southern Baptist leader is urging America&#39;s biggest <br/>
Protestant denomination to call on parents to pull their children out <br/>
of public schools.<br/>
<br/>
T.C. Pinckney, a Charleston native and Citadel graduate who publishes <br/>
The Baptist Banner in Alexandria, Va., submitted the controversial <br/>
resolution for next month&#39;s annual meeting in Indianapolis.<br/>
<br/>
The resolution says Christian parents should put their children in <br/>
Christian schools or teach them at home because public schools <br/>
are &quot;anti-Christian,&quot; &quot;humanistic&quot; and &quot;officially Godless,&quot; <br/>
and &quot;many Christian children in government schools are converted to <br/>
an anti-Christian worldview rather than evangelizing their <br/>
schoolmates.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The resolution has been widely circulated through e-mail. Pinckney, a <br/>
former second vice president of the convention and one of the leaders <br/>
in the denomination&#39;s conservative takeover in the 1970s and &#39;80s, <br/>
confirmed the resolution&#39;s authenticity in a telephone interview <br/>
Friday.<br/>
<br/>
A committee appointed by President Jack Graham will decide whether to <br/>
release it for debate on the floor, said John Revell, executive <br/>
committee staff liaison to the resolutions committee. The convention <br/>
never comments on resolutions in advance, he said in an interview, <br/>
which he followed up with a statement by e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Southern Baptist Convention has more than 43,000 churches with <br/>
more than 16.3 million members,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Any -- or all --<br/>
of those members could hypothetically submit a proposed resolution <br/>
on any subject matter they choose. The resolutions committee <br/>
prayerfully and carefully evaluates each proposal to determine if it <br/>
is suitable for submission to the Southern Baptist Convention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In 1999, messengers passed a resolution urging churches to support <br/>
Christian educational programs &quot;whether they are implemented in <br/>
Christian, private, public, or home schools.&quot; In 1997, they passed a <br/>
resolution supporting parents who teach their children at home and <br/>
Christians who teach in public schools.<br/>
<br/>
If the committee does not release the resolution for debate, Pinckney <br/>
said he will make a motion from the floor after the convention opens <br/>
June 15. Two-thirds of the messengers would have to approve for the <br/>
resolution to stay alive.<br/>
<br/>
The resolution was co-sponsored by Bruce Shortt of Houston, a former <br/>
attorney who is active in the home-school movement through the Exodus <br/>
Mandate, which is based in Columbia.<br/>
<br/>
Shortt has spearheaded the unusual preconvention publicity.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;As Christians, we have to take a serious look at this,&quot; he <br/>
said. &quot;Government schools are a seething cauldron of educational <br/>
pathologies. Most parents have no idea how bad the government schools <br/>
are and how toxic that is for children. Christian children who attend <br/>
public schools are being enticed out of the church.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Exodus Mandate founder Ray Moore Jr. of Columbia, also a Charleston <br/>
native and Citadel graduate, said he made some suggestions while the <br/>
resolution was being drafted. He&#39;s not a Southern Baptist but <br/>
welcomes the discussion the resolution has generated.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Even in South Carolina, the school system is officially anti-<br/>
Christian and godless,&quot; said Moore, whose four children were schooled <br/>
at home. &quot;Anything goes but Christianity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pinckney grew up attending Citadel Square Baptist Church in downtown <br/>
Charleston, which operated a Christian school until the mid-1980s. <br/>
Pastor Ken Hardin declined to comment on the resolution, saying he <br/>
had not had time to read it.<br/>
<br/>
Phone calls to several local Baptist school administrators Friday <br/>
afternoon were not returned.<br/>

  Wow.  The fact that this struck me as &quot;blech&quot; must mean that I&#39;ve come a long way!! LOL.<br/>

  I was never heavy into spanking, but I also live in an area where spanking is heartily defended.<br/>

  I guess I&#39;ve been out of that loop for so long I had sort of forgotten about it ;o).  Good thing too.<br/>
