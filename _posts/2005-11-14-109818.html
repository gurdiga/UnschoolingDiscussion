<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516317532"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Many times said person starts their own list (or in this case goes back to <br/>
&gt; their list to *report* and bash) and most times the list lasts for a few <br/>
&gt; months and then dries up in the backwaters of Yahoo Groups.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>==================<br/>
<br/>
And from what I&#39;ve seen of those, before they dry up they&#39;re very, very <br/>
negative and depressing.<br/>
<br/>
I was accused recently (on one of those kinds of lists, by one of those kinds <br/>
of people) of this:<br/>
&quot; She never defends unschooling as having its own quality--just as being <br/>
&quot;better than.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s profoundly baseless, but often it seems a guilty person points the <br/>
finger and states her crime.   Those lists sometimes exist to be better than <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion.   They state up front that they will be better than this <br/>
list, nicer, more open.   And then they spend energy badmouthing this list.   I <br/>
haven&#39;t yet seen one be better than this one is at discussion of unschooling, <br/>
and there&#39;s nothing else I personally would want from an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
Obsessions are interesting in any case, and obsessions about topics can be <br/>
interesting but obsessions about people can be a little spooky when one is that <br/>
person.   All my essays are gone from unschooling.com now, I noticed the other <br/>
day.   Someone(s) pressing to have me obliterated.   My name is being <br/>
stricken from all the buildings in Egypt, as it were--also spooky.    But they don&#39;t <br/>
own this building, or SandraDodd.com, so hooray for free speech.   But I know <br/>
when my kids get obsessed about something they learn a lot, and make <br/>
connections to lots of other things, so even an obsession with unschooling or with one <br/>
unschooler can&#39;t help but expose the person to more unschooling ideas.<br/>
<br/>
My current obsession (very new and can&#39;t last long because there&#39;s not much <br/>
of it) is Little Britain, a TV sketch series in its third season in the U.K.    <br/>
 Friends brought me Season 2, for which I switched my computer&#39;s DVD player <br/>
to European settings.    For those who know the series, my very favorite <br/>
character is Andy, of Lou and Andy.    But this weekend I&#39;ve been thinking much more <br/>
of Vicky Pollard, as this list was attacked in such &quot;Yeah but, no but, yeah <br/>
but... I so can&#39;t believe you just SAID that!&quot; fashion.    It&#39;s been doubly <br/>
amusing for me to see someone be so VickyPollardesque in my own life.<br/>
<br/>
The first season is on a north American DVD now and I&#39;m hoping it will arrive <br/>
today!   I&#39;ll have to watch it elsewhere, as I&#39;m not yet ready to turn off <br/>
access to that second season.     This stuff is as good as any Monty Python or <br/>
Mike Myers stuff.    <br/>
<br/>

(Wait--found that quote better.   It wasn&#39;t &quot;every building&quot;:<br/>
-=-Let the name of Moses be stricken from every book and tablet. Stricken <br/>
from every pylon and obelisk of Egypt. Let the name of Moses be unheard and <br/>
unspoken, erased from the memory of man, for all time.-=-(From a fine Charlton <br/>
Heston movie)<br/>

hopping and ran into Monty Python on BBC America. DS (7 1/2) sat and <br/>
laughed so hard it was fun just watching him enjoy this new to him <br/>
silliness. About 20 minutes ago I looked up the program guide to see <br/>
when it is broadcast and called home to let them know it comes on @ <br/>
2 pm EST. When I told DH, he said that DS had just minutes before <br/>
asked about when it would be on again. So they&#39;re off to Python <br/>
land... BTW DS found it interesting that DH and I <br/>
understood &quot;British&quot; - during a commercial we were talking about why <br/>
some of the words were different (lift-elevator, etc) and we&#39;d <br/>
translate the odd joke that didn&#39;t quite connect. He got an absolute <br/>
kick out of the suit of armor/knight that came in and bonked people <br/>
over the head with a chicken (rubber chicken that is) when they got <br/>
too silly. He took the next break to run into his room and come back <br/>
with 3 assorted stuffed critters which we were to use to bonk <br/>
(gently) anyone that got too silly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341482314">I should post a warning about this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My current obsession (very new and can&#39;t last long because there&#39;s not much<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s rated, in England, for no one under fifteen.   Here it would be <br/>
definitely N-17.<br/>
<br/>
The humor is mostly situational and slapstick, but Brits tend not to worry <br/>
much about nudity.   Some of the nudity and partial nudity is not real (body <br/>
suit, a fake breast in a sketch about nursing), but rough for the unprepared.   <br/>
The language is rough in the &quot;Dafydd Thomas&quot; episodes.<br/>
<br/>
So all but the bravest families with teens or the parents who can hide DVDs <br/>
where younger kids won&#39;t get them, never mind.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to download small parts online, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Not for children, though, though depending on the humor and tolerance levels <br/>
of individual families, disclaim, blah-blah, beware...<br/>
