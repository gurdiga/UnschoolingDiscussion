I&#39;m starting a new virtual support group.  It is for nightowls and<br/>
others who tend to spend most of their awake hours when others are<br/>
asleep, a habit we got into when my husband had odd shift hours.<br/>
Homeschooling after Midnight is designed as a virtual support group<br/>
for nightowls.  It will give an environment that is supportive to<br/>
your homeschooling, but give you an interactive group that are on<br/>
when you are.  It offers a freedom to post when you are up and<br/>
thinking about topics, without wondering what people will think of<br/>
you when they see a timestamp of 3:45am.<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest reached &#39;school age&#39;, our friends would kiddingly<br/>
ask if we did her school work at midnight and sheepishly I said yes.<br/>
It was the time of day when she was most creative and attuned to<br/>
learning, so it fit our family.  If this sounds like you, come join<br/>
us at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/H-a-M">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/H-a-M</a><br/>
