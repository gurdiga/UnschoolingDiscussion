I try to duck my sense of guilt with a shield of humor.  So I say &quot;Darn <br/>
it!  The laundry fairy didn&#39;t bring us any socks.&quot;  (Sometimes I&#39;ll add <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m gonna have to have a talk with her.&quot;)  (If it starts to happen <br/>
frequently, I will buy more socks.  When the laundry gets piled up, <br/>
socks do seem to sift down to the bottom of the heap and stay there.)<br/>
<br/>
I think cat boxes are so disgusting that I&#39;m not willing to have a cat.  <br/>
(The fact that ds is violently allergic helps reinforce that decision.)<br/>
<br/>
I read a lot of feminist stuff about housework in the 70&#39;s, so my guilt <br/>
demons are very tiny and easily stomped out.  In my opinion, no one who <br/>
works 7 days a week every week and is on call at nights should work more <br/>
than 3 or 4 hours per day.  Down with the 12 hour work day!  Up with <br/>
dust balls!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m kind of crabby and won&#39;t &quot;follow orders&quot; unless they make sense.  I <br/>
don&#39;t expect obedience from my kid either, just cooperation.<br/>

I use a doggie door to let my cats come and go as they please.   :)<br/>
 <br/>
Last week we were seeing record rainfall and our back yard was completely  <br/>
flooded. One morning while it was pouring, Cooler, our black cat, kept  running <br/>
in and out of the doggie door really fast.  Charles came upstairs  to let me <br/>
know the cat was acting strange.  I said I thought he had to &quot;go&quot;  really bad, <br/>
and so I filled up the cat box we used to have and he couldn&#39;t wait  to get in <br/>
it.  <br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
Wash the damned socks without attaching angst or history or politics  or  <br/>
power struggles to it.<br/>
~~~<br/>
Or, make it easy for hubby to do it.  In our house, whomever wants the  house <br/>
the cleanest does most of the work.  It varies from week to week, day  to <br/>
day.  I probably do more just because I&#39;m home more.  But I&#39;d  probably go move <br/>
the load out of the washer while he went and gathered up his  socks.  I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine him ever telling me he&#39;s out of socks, and then  expecting me to wash <br/>
them.  He does his own laundry.  On  Sundays.<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve had our share of power struggles over housework, but after 15  years <br/>
we&#39;ve worked them out.  <br/>

one of our three cats is a weirdo male who wants a litter  box.  So he&#39;s the <br/>

cloth somewhere.  He goes outside too  sometimes.  It&#39;s easier to furnish him a <br/>
dark corner and a box than it is  to clean up.  The females like to go <br/>
outside.  Sometimes I rake up a  place for them to go easily.  Nice to have a big <br/>
yard with some plain dirt  places, and not all too fancy for cats to go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805201016">(If it starts to happen frequently, I will buy more socks.  <br/>
 <br/>
*****<br/>
 <br/>
I spent the last couple of weeks complaining that Gary didn&#39;t ever have clean socks (I check early in the week for him, so he won&#39;t run out -- saves on my stress levels).  I was convinced he should have enough socks, just couldn&#39;t figure out where they&#39;d all gone.  Finally, I bought another 4-pack last week - now there are 8 or 9 pairs in his drawer.  <br/>
 <br/>
Another helpful thing for me is to do laundry all thru the week, rather than just on one day.  I do a couple of loads every other day or so, and it seems less daunting.  Catboxes get changed the evening before trash day, so it all goes out the next morning.  Having two boxes seems to help, too.<br/>
 <br/>
I spent some years specifically NOT doing all the things my Mom had required of me, and NOT doing anything the way she had done it.  The negative method didn&#39;t give me great guidelines, but at least I avoided things like spanking and forcing my kids to be house-slaves.<br/>
 <br/>
When my Mom was with us (from Halloween to New Year&#39;s -- she&#39;s out now!) she several times mentioned how hard I work, how much I do around the house, and how I should have the kids do more.  I ignored her the first few times.  Some time during her last week here, I&#39;d had enough.  When she said, &#39;you did housework as a kid, now it&#39;s your turn to...&quot;  I interrupted her and said that just because I had done housework as a kid, didn&#39;t give me the right now to demand the same of my kids.  I told her I ask of my kids what I&#39;m comfortable with.  I know it&#39;s not what she&#39;d be comfortable asking of kids, but now it&#39;s my turn to the be Mom, and this is what I&#39;m comfortable with.<br/>
 <br/>
I realized that&#39;s really what it&#39;s all about.  I clean house -- to the extent that I do -- because it&#39;s what I want.  I like order in the living room, but the playroom can be chaotic.  I really like to find an empty sink in the morning so I do the dishes every night.  I like clean towels, but whether the bathroom floor gets mopped is really a non-issue to me.  If the mirror is too streaked to see my reflection (and if I really want to see what I look like&lt;g&gt;) I&#39;ll clean it when it bothers me.  I do the things that matter to me as an adult, and I&#39;m confident that when my kids grow up, they&#39;ll do the things that matter to them.  They won&#39;t need me to tell them what should be done, or who they should have do it for them.<br/>

I have been considering that for my two cats.  I either get that the  <br/>
cats/family love it or they hate it.  Did your cats have any period of  adjustment to <br/>
the box?  Has it ever started it&#39;s cleaning cycle while the  cat was in the <br/>
box?<br/>
 <br/>
Is yours the &quot;littermaid&quot; brand?  I know there are two of them on the  market <br/>
right now.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your input.  My two cats seem to be getting snarky with  each <br/>
other over the litter box and I&#39;m thinking of just doing something less  <br/>
maintenance wise these days.<br/>

  Elissa<br/>
  ************************<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Elissa, <br/>
  This is a constant battle for me, too, but I&#39;m finally winning.  I have been rebelling against people telling me what to do ever since I can remember and now at 36, I&#39;m getting a hold on it.  It&#39;s not about socks, it&#39;s not about the cat box, it&#39;s about being told what to do, or *hearing* that we&#39;re being told what to do even when we&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
  Now, I do a whole lot of self-talk, affirmations, even chanting--I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s working exactly, but my house is cleaner and I&#39;m not so uptight about it.  Another thing, if my house is clean there&#39;s no way anyone can tell me it&#39;s not.  I might not also turn innocent comments into something they&#39;re not.  <br/>
<br/>
  My childhood was very controlled, and punished, etc.  So, though I may choose to clean, like my mother would have wanted and ordered me to, I can likewise make choices that she&#39;d hate, like hanging maps on the walls of the living room, letting my child stay up to 1:30 am, or whenever she wants to go to bed, letting my desk be as messy as it can be for as long as I can stand it.<br/>
<br/>
  I think we change being rebellious or resentful now by choosing what&#39;s best for us because it IS best, not because someone told us to or expects us to.  When it comes right down to it, everything we do is a choice.  I enjoy making choices that benefit my family and myself.  It&#39;s a much less complicated way to live.<br/>
<br/>

If it did start cleaning while they were in there, it didn&#39;t traumatize<br/>
them. Maybe it resets when whatever triggers the delayed cleaning cycle gets<br/>

<br/>
This instant desire to rebel because I was told/ordered to do it is<br/>
something that I struggle with also. It seemed to happen a lot in my<br/>
childhood that I would be on the point of doing some task, for example<br/>
getting up to carry out my plate, when my mother would tell me to do it. It<br/>
was infuriating. I felt that I never got the credit for doing the job, or<br/>
even for being willing to do it. I also felt completely untrusted, and as if<br/>
she thought I was stupid. If I ever said, &quot;I was just about to do that&quot;, I<br/>
was treated to disbelieving and condescending comments.<br/>
<br/>
The way my husband occasionally does a similar thing now is that he says in<br/>
a somewhat reproachful tone, &quot;I thought you were going to ....... today&quot;, as<br/>
if I have blown it off when I merely haven&#39;t done it *yet*. He tells me that<br/>
he believes that if he didn&#39;t say this kind of thing I would not complete<br/>
whatever the household task is - like do the grocery shopping. It drives me<br/>
crazy, because there seems no way to get him to stop this commentary except<br/>
to prove him wrong with utter perfection on my part. I guess it is a hot<br/>
button trigger for me, probably because of my experience with Mum. <br/>
<br/>
Amazingly I managed to have clean clothes and food in the house when I was<br/>
single, which I can tell you from our dating days were not by any means<br/>
assured in *his* apartment.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of laundry what works over here (in an apartment complex) is that<br/>
generally I do all the laundry on Wednesdays. OTOH here is something that<br/>
puts a slightly different spin on the whole housekeeping thing, that I have<br/>
posted before.<br/>
<br/>
Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Our house is pretty messy, but at one time was much more so than usual<br/>
for a while. Jayn was very little at the time, and not being the big creator<br/>
that she is now. I was just letting things go some, feeling a little<br/>
overwhelmed and resentful - alone in the task. I hadn&#39;t learnt to ask for<br/>
help very well yet. Dh was getting snappier and grumpier. And there were<br/>
some arguments, where I was baffled at the intensity of his emotions. I mean<br/>
he is the person who would step over the doll five times, and then explode<br/>
about mess and make it my responsibility, rather than just pick up the doll<br/>
the first time.<br/>
<br/>
It finally came out, with many tears on both our parts, that he was afraid I<br/>
didn&#39;t love him anymore and was planning to leave him, because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
taking care of &quot;his home&quot;. He truly saw (sees) the housework I do as a gift<br/>
of love to him. It had never occurred to me to see it that way, just as I<br/>
don&#39;t think it occurred to him to have to express that idea, and his<br/>
gratitude, to me. He just tried to &quot;force&quot; my love back by demanding I clean<br/>
up. Since from my perspective my love hadn&#39;t gone away I just got hurt and<br/>
angry. <br/>
<br/>
Things have been way better since. He is more relaxed, or at least acceptant<br/>
of the times when the house gets out of hand. I try harder to stay on top of<br/>
things and am much more successful at asking for help, including regular<br/>
purges of accumulated clutter - my stuff only, sometimes his. Jayn is a<br/>
hoarder at the moment. He is also more grateful, and I do all I can to<br/>
express love and reassurance to him in other ways. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
