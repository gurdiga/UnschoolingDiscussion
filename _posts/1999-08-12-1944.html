<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053680644">do you know how many baby foods have apples in<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;them? wow! I cannot even immagine what you go thru with the food items, how<br/>
&gt;do you choose things to eat?? I think that my life with my daughter must be<br/>
&gt;easier than yours, she may be extreeme, but with patience and understanding<br/>
&gt;we get thru, but I don&#39;t think I would survive those severe allergies only<br/>
&gt;because I am the queen of JUNK FOOD!!!! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For Thomas we must choose foods that contain no dairy proteins (milk, and<br/>
cheese mostly,) no eggs (or trace amounts,) no preservatives, no heavy<br/>
spices and no nuts, nut oils, or other nut products.  Do you have any idea<br/>
how many things have NUTS in them?!  He can eat butter and yogurt, which do<br/>
not contain the dairy proteins that cause most allergies, and that is a big<br/>
help to us as I can make him sandwiches with butter instead of Mayo, or<br/>
make buttered noodles, give him frozen yogurt in lieu of ice cream, etc.<br/>
We also look for foods with Calcium added (O.J., cereal bars, Eggo<br/>
Waffles)to ensure that he gets enough in his diet.  He cannot eat the<br/>
typical kid things like canned pastas, cheese, ice cream, cake, pizza, most<br/>
cookies, etc.  We also have to be careful with things like Ketchup.  He<br/>
loves the stuff, and will eat it with a spoon, but it affects his sensative<br/>
skin (as if his food allergies were not enough!!)  So if he is having<br/>
&#39;tater tots&#39; or chicken nuggets or some such with ketchup, we have to keep<br/>
a damp towel handy and wipe off his face every few minutes or he gets a<br/>
hivey rash around his mouth.  He eats a lot of whole foods (fruits and<br/>
veggies) dried, jellied, raw, steamed or otherwise prepared simply, loves<br/>
fish (although we are avoiding shellfish for now as a common allergen)<br/>
chicken and other meats, and eats a lot of crackers (like wheat thins and<br/>
graham crackers.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, when we are out to eat, we will construct meals out of several<br/>
side dishes, or ask for a special meal for him if we cannot find anything<br/>
on the menu for him.  I sometimes make a seperate &quot;kids meal&quot; at home for<br/>
the boys (although our youngest has no known allergies of any type) if we<br/>
adults would like to eat something Thomas cannot have.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I can get myself together to test for allergies soon, what would you<br/>
suggest<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;as the best place to start? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would not know about allergy testing.  Thomas is only 2.5 and too young<br/>
for it.  Anyway his protein type allergies (nuts, eggs, dairy) do not<br/>
respond to traditional testing.  We discovered his allergies the hard way,<br/>
with very scarey trips to the ER, particularly for the nut one.  The ER doc<br/>
said it was a good thing he did not actually ingest any of the peanut<br/>
butter, but meerly played with it (his first try of peanut butter at age 1)<br/>
or else I would never have made it to the hospital in time.  His reaction<br/>
was VERY severe.  We also had ER visits for Dairy allergy (9 months,) Egg<br/>
allergy (15 months,) and Asthma (18 months.)  The pet allergies,<br/>
preservative allergies and dust allergy were less severe and we were able<br/>
to treat his reactions at home with the allergy medication we already had<br/>
on hand.  His sensative skin surfaced at about 6 weeks old when we had to<br/>
put a humidifier in his room and cycled through several perscriptions<br/>
looking for something that worked on his Eczema and rashes.<br/>

<br/>
I would recommend finding a good allergist.  My HMO id for an immunologist<br/>
for my then nine month old son, and I found a wonderful doctor.  He was a<br/>
member of the Food Allergy Network, and very informed on the latest research<br/>
regarding allergies.  He helped me through two hour long sessions identify<br/>
and eliminate the most prominent allergens, and encouraged me to breastfeed<br/>
my son as long as I could.   We did scratch testing when he was nine months<br/>
old and discovered his worst allergies were obviously dairy, dust, and mold.<br/>
This helped in managing his severe eczema.  We were already a dairy free<br/>
household, and the elimnation diet helped us identify only one other food<br/>
allergy.  So much attention is paid to diet that often environmental<br/>
allergens aren&#39;t addressed.<br/>
<br/>
There are several comprehensive books about dealing with allergies, I<br/>
recommend starting with IS THIS YOUR CHILD,  and THE ALLERGY RESOURCE BOOK.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331300624">I&#39;ve talked about allergies before.  Yes, dyes and preservatives can be<br/>
allergens and frequently are.  I highly recommend a book called, &quot;Is this<br/>
your child?&quot;  I often hear people talk about how their kid gets &#39;wired on<br/>
sugar&#39;  and I&#39;d be willing to bet that in at least half those cases the<br/>
true culprit is the baggage with the sugar.  You can use Kool-Aid as hair<br/>
dye, why would you want to drink that.<br/>
<br/>
You asked about the symptoms, here are Wyndham&#39;s.  When he eats wheat he<br/>
has predominately intestinal symptoms with just a few behavioural ones<br/>
thrown in.  Wheat will cause him to mess his pants and not know it is<br/>
going to happen.    It will also cause him to get rashy and wheezy a bit.<br/>
 The chemical allergens act completely different.  The initial symptoms<br/>
are behavioural.  He will go from a sweet little boy to Mr. Hyde in the<br/>
space of an hour.  I am always the first to see it coming because I can<br/>
hear a change in the pitch of his voice.  He will bounce of the walls and<br/>
act really bizarre.  He also will be more prone to the OCD symptoms I<br/>
discussed earlier.  I believe all of this is connected, the ICD and<br/>
allergies.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting allergy symptom is handwriting.  There is a really<br/>
good example in the book I mentioned above.  I know with myself that I<br/>
can look at my handwriting and tell how close to a major allergy attack I<br/>
am.  It&#39;s kinda weird but pretty accurate.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure if it was this list or another, but I&#39;ve heard other <br/>
&gt; mom&#39;s talk <br/>
&gt; about children&#39;s allergies.  My son is allergic to dairy and eggs, <br/>
&gt; since <br/>
&gt; birth, but now I&#39;m wondering about other stuff too.  Seems like I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt; heard <br/>
&gt; someone talk about preservatives and other unnatural stuff, just <br/>
&gt; wanted a bit <br/>
&gt; more specific info.  Like he gets wired on sugar, but sometimes when <br/>
&gt; he has <br/>
&gt; candy, he behaves like he&#39;s had dairy or eggs.  I&#39;m wondering if <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s dyes or <br/>
&gt; preservatives or something. So just wondering what were allergies <br/>
&gt; for other <br/>
&gt; kids. Any feedback would be great....Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692182255">Okay,<br/>
Where do I start, we are coming into spring, so our 6<br/>
week break is over summer, the Christmas holidays. <br/>
This year i think it starts on 22 December and goes to<br/>
1st week in February.<br/>
Daniel was in   a small school when he first started<br/>
school.  If I could have, I would have left him there.<br/>
The school had 28 pupils from year 1 through to year<br/>
7.<br/>
The homeschooling requirements are:<br/>
you apply for an exemption.<br/>
You get it,<br/>
maybe if you are unlucky you get a review.<br/>
That is it.<br/>
At this stage, no reporting, no testing no nothing.<br/>
We just &quot;have to teach as well and as regulary as a<br/>
normal school&quot;, or something like that.<br/>
In primary years, that equates to about 2 hours per<br/>
day of &#39;schooling&#39;.<br/>
Me personally, I do no seat work as a rule, but Daniel<br/>
reads, and reads, and reads.<br/>
We are a food allergy family, with my second son being<br/>
mild special needs.<br/>
I am looking forward to learning what other<br/>
unschoolers do, and how they &#39;prove&#39; to the<br/>
authorities that the children are learning.  I am<br/>
sometimes concerned that Daniel who I believe has a<br/>
high IQ (mine is 120), is learning the skills<br/>
necessary to go into the field of &#39;expertise&#39; he will<br/>
one day decide is for him.<br/>
I have brought my children up not to get too attached<br/>
to anything, and as a result daniel has no hobbies or<br/>
any great interests, I dont know if he is like this<br/>
naturatlly or if it is the way I have brought him up.<br/>
I have been on my own for over 3 years now, and there<br/>
is very little male input, other than my step-father<br/>
who isnot a mans man, but my boys are.<br/>
Does this make sence, I hope I have answered your<br/>
queries.<br/>
<br/>
Julz (Whose real name is Julie, but for the first time<br/>
in my life, I am finding Julie&#39;s all over the place<br/>
and I really dont like the name Julie, so it is<br/>
becoming Julz, NOT jules, for some reason I prefer the<br/>
z to es)<br/>

<br/>
Why did you not &quot;leave him there&quot;?<br/>
How do you show that you are providing equilivant<br/>
instruction? Here, in the USA each state has different<br/>
requirements. Some are as vague as those you describe.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you answered all of my queries. Thanks. &#39; got<br/>
some more.<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel that you must provide about two hours per<br/>
day of sructured lessons?<br/>
<br/>
Is the water really so pure in NZ it can be drunk from<br/>
the streams and rivers? or is that only is some areas?<br/>
In any areas at all that sounds so wonderful. Do you<br/>
use thermal heat?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327687564">Hi Sharon, and any other interested peoples,<br/>
My marriage broke and I moved from Levin to Auckland,<br/>
so Daniel changed schools when he was 6, he then had a<br/>
really good teacher last year, but I didnt like any of<br/>
the teachers he could have ended up with this year.  I<br/>
thought I could do better, and also, he was getting<br/>
very aggressive and verbally abusive.<br/>
<br/>
RE the 2 hours per day, I would love to give him 1<br/>
hour a day structure, but I am not yet that sort of<br/>
person.  I would love to do htat but not yet.<br/>
<br/>
As for our pure water, well for the most part, where<br/>
the streams are that are pure, are where there are no<br/>
cattle farms and no towns yes the water can be that<br/>
pure.  But mainly in the South Island where there is<br/>
lots of hills, lots of snow in winter and very few<br/>
people and some animals, mainly sheep.<br/>
Sheep pellets for those that dont know are the best<br/>
fertiliser, because sheep dont eat weeds and junk.<br/>
The thermal heat, well, I cant actually answer that. <br/>
I think some parts of Rotorua have thermal heat, but I<br/>
dont really know.  Sorry about that.<br/>
I live in Auckland, the largest city in NZ.<br/>

Thanks for the reply. And acknowledging my questions. <br/>

That you are not &quot;that kind of person&quot; is great. Not<br/>

and how they can (in some cases but not all) often cause cravings similar<br/>
to an alcoholics craving for booze.  I forget now the reasons behind it,<br/>
but I know from experience that it can be true.  He also warned me to be<br/>
expecially careful with the alcohol I drank.  I am allergic to corn and<br/>
crave it.  I also come from a family with a high history of alcoholism. <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>

<br/>
I found mine by using a food diary.  For a month I wrote down every<br/>
single thing that went in my mouth.  I also wrote down every symptom and<br/>
when it occured.  My Doctor reviewed it and picked out the correlation<br/>
between corn and my headaches immediately.  I then did an elimination and<br/>
test thing.  For four or five days I ate no corn at all.  Then I ate pure<br/>
corn (mush if I recall) and he tested my bp, pulse, etc. for changes.  Of<br/>
course, I promptly had a killer headache too.<br/>
<br/>
With the kids the discoveries were more difficult.  I am not disiplined<br/>
enough to put them through an elimination diet.  We found Rachel&#39;s corn<br/>
allergy because he symptoms were so much like mine we decided to test<br/>
that one first with her.  Jenni&#39;s milk problem (and it is beyond just<br/>
lactose intolerance) we found by accident when she was three and a half. <br/>
We ran out of milk one day and I didn&#39;t go get any for two days.  Her<br/>
symptoms cleared up but I didn&#39;t make the connection until I ran out of<br/>
milk a second time!<br/>
<br/>
Wyndham is the difficult one.  I figured out the dye allergy in a very<br/>
novel way.  He kept throwing up a lot.  It was always bright yellow. <br/>
After about a dozen cases of vividly bright yellow vomit, I made the<br/>
connection.  He developed dye allergies one color at a time.  Wheat was<br/>
another trial and error thing.  We tested milk first with him because the<br/>
symptoms were bowel related.  It wasn&#39;t that so I went looking for other<br/>
allergies that tended to present with bowel symptoms first and decided to<br/>
try wheat.<br/>
<br/>
I often run into people who think I am exaggerating (or making up) my<br/>
kids allergies.  Then they happen to be around for a Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde<br/>
and they usually are turned into true believers on the spot.  With<br/>
Wyndham especially, they difference is astounding.  You will see a nice<br/>
talkative but calm and intelligent little boy suddenly turn into a boy<br/>
shaped pingpong ball bouncing off the walls and acting very peculiar.  I<br/>
am alway the first to know he had something but my mother is now running<br/>
a close second.  We can both hear a change in the pitch of his voice that<br/>
precedes the outbursts by about 20 minutes or so.  If we can get<br/>
anti-histamines in him in that window, we can keep him from going<br/>
completely over the edge.  Our biggest problem right now with him is that<br/>
he seems to be allergic to a cleaner or a purfume in a cleaner.  We know<br/>
Zep carpet cleaner is a big no-no, but Wal-mart doesn&#39;t have carpet and<br/>
something there sets him off too.  The reaction from wheat is more subtle<br/>
and involves skin and wheezing and bowels.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it is important to make certain your kids understand why they<br/>
can&#39;t have certain foods.  It has taken several years but Wyndham is<br/>
finally getting the connection between how he feels and what he eats.  If<br/>
I had not limited his foods though, he would never have known he could<br/>
feel good.  He is allergic to so many things that he would never have<br/>
been allergen free to feel the difference.  For that matter, I would<br/>
never have figured out my own allergies without a really great doctor who<br/>
took the time to really explain things to me.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes and one other allergy related baby hint - If your baby is rashhy<br/>
and no amount of lotion helps - try NO lotion.  When Rachel was a newborn<br/>
baby she had a constant full body rash.  I finally just gave up trying to<br/>
make it go away.  I washed her with water only and soap on the ucky parts<br/>
only.  I used no lotion or soap or powder anywhere on the rest of her. <br/>
The rashes magically cleared up.  Just because the nice nurse sent that<br/>
cute bottle of lotion home with you, does not mean it is necessary or<br/>
even good for every kid.  Wyndham was allergic to diapers with that gel<br/>
stuff too, just another thing to think about.  Oh yes, and I had nasty<br/>
red sore nipples.  The culprit was the nipple cream they sent home from<br/>
the hospital!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not how I saw the conversation at all.  What I saw and still see<br/>
is someone saying that &quot;most&quot; people who say their kids have allergies<br/>
are either delusional or using it as a control issue.  I believe the<br/>
exact phrase was something about the minute number of people with deadly<br/>
allergies.  Granted there aren&#39;t oodles of people out there with life<br/>
threatening allergies.  There are, however, oodles more with non-life<br/>
threatening allergies.  Lynda discussed the differences in medical<br/>
terminology.  Whether you call it an allergy or a sensitivity there are<br/>
thousands of people out there with these problems.  They are often<br/>
misdiagnosed and put on medications they don&#39;t need.  They are often<br/>
convince sugar in general is the problem when it is really dyes or corn<br/>
or wheat or milk.  <br/>
<br/>
Not one of the people who has stated here that his/her child has<br/>
allergies has said that those experiencing no problems should limit their<br/>
children&#39;s diets.  They have instead said, &quot;if you see these kinds of<br/>
symptoms, you might want to consider looking into the allergy<br/>
connection.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I learned long ago that those who do not recognize that my children have<br/>
allergies should not be allowed in any way shape or form to  influence my<br/>
decisions about food for my family.  One of the biggest problems I<br/>
personally face is that it is darn near impossible to feed us all without<br/>
having something someone is allergic to in the house.  And I&#39;m not sure<br/>
just not buying it is a great way to handle it either.  They need to<br/>
learn to monitor themselves and if it is never in the house they may not<br/>
learn how.  I guess it is sort of like the soda pop thing someone here<br/>
was discussing.  For a long time, I kept most corn products out of the<br/>
house because both Rachel and I are allergic.  I found that she would<br/>
binge on it at her friend&#39;s house and then come home with a miserable<br/>
migraine-like headache.  So, we decided to keep it in the house and just<br/>
remind her every time she got headaches why she had them.  She learned to<br/>
control it.  Obviously that does not work if you have life-threatening<br/>
allergies though!<br/>

As for the issue itself, sometimes it is difficult to find the<br/>
sensitivities if there are several. I do encourage everyone to avoid dyes<br/>
and preservatives as much as they can.  And the issue is complicated by<br/>
sensitivities to airborn substances like perfumes.  Another thing to be<br/>
aware of, allergy testing is not always accurate (especially for<br/>
non-life-threatening allergies) and it can be off in both directions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-106640017">Apis Mell. in the higher dose (30 C I believe) is a<br/>
good homeopath to carry which helps reduce swelling in<br/>
&quot;Bites, Stings and Swellings&quot;.  My friend carries this<br/>
for her 3 year old son who has a severe peanut<br/>
allergy.  I got it for my 3 year old son who had<br/>
swelling due to mosquitoes (he also has an uncle who<br/>
had a peanut allergy).  <br/>
