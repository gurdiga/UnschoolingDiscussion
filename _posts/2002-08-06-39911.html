<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985446695">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;,I think the best way to teach kids responsibility toward animals is<br/>
to model<br/>
it, showing  them that it&#39;s a responsibility for mature people .... like<br/>
driving a car or caring for younger kids.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Another good way (especially if you can&#39;t have pets at home) to teach caring<br/>
for animals is to volunteer at the humane society or SPCA.  I did several<br/>
things like that in my childhood.  One year I was able to volunteer at the<br/>
Vet clinic on an army base, caring for the MP&#39;s german shepards.  I also<br/>
handed out pamphlets at a fair for the SPCA one summer.  I donated supplies<br/>
to the humane society, etc. Being involved with those places taught me alot<br/>
about animals and humans.<br/>
