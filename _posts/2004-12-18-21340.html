<div id="ygrps-yiv-234358752">One of the songs on Clay Aiken&#39;s Christmas album was new to me.  It&#39;s fairly <br/>
new to the world in general (early 90&#39;s, written by Buddy Greene and Mark <br/>
Lowry ).  I looked up a couple of other renditions, but  I didn&#39;t like them <br/>
better.   Lyrics lose power without the context of their tunes, but poetically <br/>
speaking, there are some big moments here:<br/>
<br/>
Mary did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Would one day walk on water<br/>
<br/>
Mary did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Would save our sons and daughters<br/>
<br/>
Did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Has come to make you new<br/>
<br/>
This child that you delivered<br/>
Will soon deliver you<br/>
<br/>
Mary did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Will give sight to a blind man<br/>
<br/>
Mary did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Will calm the storm with His hand<br/>
<br/>
Did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Has walked where angels trod<br/>
When you kiss<br/>
Your little baby, you kiss the face of God<br/>
Oh Mary did you know<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The blind will see<br/>
The deaf will hear<br/>
The dead will live again<br/>
The lame will leap<br/>
The dumb will speak<br/>
The praises of The Lamb<br/>
<br/>
Mary did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Is Lord of all creation<br/>
<br/>
Mary did you know<br/>
That you baby boy<br/>
Would one day rule the nations<br/>
<br/>
Did you know<br/>
That your baby boy<br/>
Is Heaven&#39;s perfect Lamb<br/>
<br/>
This sleeping child<br/>
You&#39;re holding<br/>
Is the great<br/>
I Am<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
I love Christmas, and Christmas has inspired some of the most wonderful music <br/>
and art over the past thousand years.   This is a good example.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the literal meaning of the words of &quot;Mary did you Know&quot; that <br/>
inspires me, it&#39;s the spiritual/emotional concept of God being born perfectly new <br/>
again every year.  (Other religions have annual renewal moments too.)  And I&#39;m <br/>
touched by such ideas surrounding the relationship between a mother and child in <br/>
any context.<br/>
<br/>
How should a mother treat a child? How should a father be?<br/>
Christians should treat others as they would treat Jesus.  That&#39;s pretty <br/>
clear in the Bible.  So shouldn&#39;t every baby be treated as though he were the baby <br/>
Jesus?<br/>
<br/>
What about those who aren&#39;t Christian?  Isn&#39;t each child a new potential?  A <br/>
dawn?  The start of an unforeseen adventure in which the mother is a <br/>
supporting character and not the hero?<br/>
<br/>
Even atheists see the moment of shining perfection in a birth.<br/>
<br/>
The better we handle the trust given us by a child, the better people we are, <br/>
and the better the child&#39;s young life, adulthood and old age will be.  We&#39;re <br/>
not just dealing with little children.  We&#39;re dealing with the whole of life <br/>
itself, which will outlast us all.  We are dealing with joy and with eternity.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We just saw my 9 yr old niece&#39;s Christmas program televised on <br/>
public access (you know...where the kids all stand on risers and <br/>
sing for their parents, and the music teacher hopes it all works <br/>
out)...i was really suprised that they were singing lots of songs i <br/>
had never heard of (and werent all that great) &quot;Yankee Doodle <br/>
Santa&quot;?? sheesh. I remember when i was in elem. school the kids <br/>
singing beautiful renditions of &quot;Silent Night&quot;, or even newer songs <br/>
like &quot;Up on the Roof Top&quot; (dont know if thats the real name of the <br/>
song)...but i only recognized one song (&quot;We Wish You A Merry <br/>
Christmas&quot;)from my niece&#39;s program. I wouldve thought that they <br/>
excluded any religious songs to be more &quot;inclusive&quot; (although based <br/>
upon where we live i bet nearly 100 percent of the kids do celebrate <br/>
Xmas in one form or another)...but they also included what they <br/>
called &quot;an old time spiritual&quot; that had a religious theme. It seems <br/>
there was a culteral literacy or something that wasnt being passed <br/>
on, and the whole thing seemed kinda sad to me, to have these kids <br/>
singing newly made-up songs with little meaning, to a prerecorded <br/>
tape (that had other, recorded kids singing on it as well), when <br/>
there is such a rich history of holiday music around that couldve <br/>
been used.<br/>
<br/>
They did have a harp player there, which was kind of nice and not <br/>
something i am used to seeing. <br/>

 <br/>
I knew which song you were talking about before you started.   Unfortunately <br/>
for me, it was quite overworked in my church-going days, so I  can&#39;t really <br/>
relate to its beauty anymore.  But now it&#39;s stuck in my  head!  <br/>
 <br/>
I think your post is one for the ages.<br/>

<br/>
I had just missed it, pretty much avoiding C&W the past few decades and <br/>
missing out on most &quot;contemporary Christian&quot; stuff.  Once in a while a phrase leaps <br/>
out, though and that song had several leaping and dancing phrases (to quote <br/>
another happy but 500 year old Christmas song, &quot;shepherds and lasses go leaping <br/>
and dancing, leaping and dancing the eve of Noel...&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
It stunned me, to hear Clay Aiken sing it.<br/>
