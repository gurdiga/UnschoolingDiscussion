<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989239751">Below is an email with lots of links sent to another group I&#39;m on, I have permission from the author to pass it on since she believes that it is very important for all of us to be as prepared as possible for any future scenario.  To me that means having a supply of non-perishable food, solar or wood cookers, alternative heat source for those of us living in the areas where winter without heat could prove fatal, clothing, basic medical supplies, cleaning supplies, seeds to plant for food crops, fruit trees in the yard [or on the balcony for apartment dwellers] etc make sense for lots of reasons, not just the Y2K and such.  <br/>
<br/>
Peak oil is a fact, we have used about half of the world&#39;s fuel reserves, and it costs more and uses more and more fuel to extract the remainder of the fuel.  We are using fuel at a faster rate than any other time in history and we don&#39;t look like slowing down any time soon, here in the USA we carry on about gas prices instead of limiting our use of it to ensure that at least essential services will have fuel in 10 to 20 years time.<br/>
<br/>
Life could be about to change quite drasticly, but for some reason the powers that be are ignoring the facts, big oil companies are in denial, auto manafacturers are making bigger gas guzzlers than ever before [Hummers come to mind] and here in the States fuel has been ridiculously inexpensive for too long, almost everywhere else in the world people pay a lot more for fuel than we do.  <br/>
<br/>
For once I agree with GWB, dipping into the nations emergency fuel supply is not the thing to do.   If the worse case scenarios occur it will make the depression of the 30s look like a picnic.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple of things we can all do are:  Buy locally produced items, and locally grown food where possible, even if it costs a little more it will keep the local producers in business for when we need them.   Cut back as much as possible oy our use of all fossil fuels, it will save some for later as we learn how to get by with less for when there is none.<br/>
<br/>
Some people I have discussed this with are full of optomism and believe that there will be plenty of alternative fuel sources by then, I&#39;m not, I&#39;ve seen the waste of funds:<br/>
<br/>
We are presently trying to generate power using a large wood gasifier which we are designing with help from &quot;experts&quot;... there are grants and &quot;experts&quot; in abundance, but the &quot;experts&quot; mainly do feasablity studies and little else, we had one graduate student &quot;research&quot; our options and was paid $5000 for doing what we had already done, look on the internet, speak to the self <br/>
proclaimed &quot;experts&quot; and at his presentation, say in summing up &quot;It&#39;s beyond me.&quot;... yet he still got his $5000.  What he had been asked to do was get a small prototype up and running, and all he did was give us a presentation that I could have put together in a few days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then another expert, says &quot;If you invest $100,000, the power you generate would pay it back in five years, my charge os $200 per hour to design the system, but there are no guarantees.&quot;, the next &quot;expert&quot; comes up with a fancy looking design &quot;That will be $12,000 thanks.&quot; and after talking to people who have been experimenting with these things we realise that his whole design is worse than useless.   There are millions of your tax dollars paying these people to play on the internet and make fancy/useless designs, that even we amateurs can blow away with the logic we have from years of burning wood. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we talk to these people some immediatley say &quot;I charge $100/$200 per hour, send money and I&#39;ll talk.&quot; or they seem right friendly and almost neighborly, say that they would like to help with such a worthy venture, talk on the phone for an hour at a time, email back and forth, <br/>
then bait the hook with &quot;I think it might just work, I charge $250 an hour.&quot;    There is too much money spent on thinking, drawing, researching with nothing to show but a presentation, or if we had gone ahead with the last design that had all the bells and whistles and technology that made it look good, but was destined to fail within a few months due to a glass like substance that forms when you burn wood with a lot of dirt in it.  The expert would have his money, the small government grant would have paid him and we would have been stuck with a <br/>
debt and a destroyed gasifier....  my husband is still obcessed with getting this to work as a way to hanlde large pieces of wood dropped here by the dump truck load.   They are too big to grind and too big to break down very rapidly... my suggestion is to stop taking them, but <br/>
then he is concerned about the waste of their potential energy output for cheap fuel...   anyway, onto the email that I am forwarding:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  The author said:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d remove my email addy, but otherwise, yes, <br/>
please, pass it on.  This is important stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, _it is really important to keep perspective_ - some of those <br/>
links are to very scary, semi-apocalyptic scenarios, which I hope are <br/>
unlikely.  To me, things aren&#39;t so bleak - if everyone, and I mean <br/>
everyone, gets on the same page and starts working together.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure we can&#39;t all go on living the way we do, but if we start covering <br/>
those suburban lawns, central park, industrial parks, the white house <br/>
lawn, with small scale grazing animals and victory gardens, we can soften <br/>
the blow a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are sending this to kids, please add this - _being scared is <br/>
appropriate_ - I&#39;m scared.  _Feeling that things are futile is another thing <br/>
- this should be a call to action,_ and not just personal action, but the <br/>
collective.  Those of us with land and skills and tools will have the <br/>
oppotunity to help others use what they have.  I feel like the 13th fairy <br/>
in the sleeping beauty legend - after the curse has been laid, you can&#39;t <br/>
take it away, but you can keep the story going and the wolf (mixing my <br/>
fairy tales) from the door with the right action.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;  how soon do the best estimates state that the oil will be gone?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a harder question than it sounds, since the problem is not running <br/>
out of oil per se, but failing to meet production and using more energy to <br/>
extract it than we actually get from the oil.  <br/>
<br/>
The textbook my husband teaches from bets around 10 years from now, give <br/>
or take 5 years.  I&#39;ve seen estimates that go as far as 2030, but I don&#39;t <br/>
find them credible - most are based on consumption lowering or staying the <br/>
same, whereas it is actually rising quite rapidly.  Since nearly everyone <br/>
who has oil lies about how much they have to ensure that people will keep <br/>
buying from them, its hard to tell.  Even the most optimistic outlook <br/>
means that we&#39;ll run out of oil in about 25 years - but I don&#39;t think <br/>
there&#39;s any reason to be optimistic.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is we&#39;ll see oil rationing in the US within the next 10 years.  <br/>
It is possible we&#39;ve already passed peak (ie, the point at which oil stops <br/>
meeting need) and our rising gas and oil prices are a sign of that.  It is <br/>
also possible that the Saudis will release more oil and temporarily lower <br/>
prices.  But it will be a temporary lowering<br/>
<br/>
The big problem is *food* - the average American meal travels more than <br/>
1000 miles to get there.  We&#39;ve centralized food production - much of the <br/>
produce comes from CA, the wheat and beef from the west, the corn from the <br/>
midwest.  All commercial agriculture uses between 5 and 40 calories of oil <br/>
to produce every calorie of food - in pesticides, in transport, as <br/>
fertilizer, to store it, etc...  We&#39;re seeing inflation in basic <br/>
commoditities now - that bag of flour is going to go up a lot in price <br/>
when gas hits 5, 6, 7 dollars per gallon.  And eventually it may become <br/>
unavailable.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, without oil, there&#39;s no evidence that we can feed the 6-9 <br/>
billion people who will be on the planet when the crash comes.  We&#39;ve <br/>
grown above our capacity to sustain ourselves.  If everyone went right now <br/>
to John Jeavonsesque diets (he suggests that an entire balanced diet for a <br/>
human being can be grown on about 1000 square feet, but there&#39;s not a lot <br/>
of fat in it, and you eat a *lot* of parsnips) maybe.  But since food <br/>
production is about to become local - very, very, very local, famine <br/>
probably will be too - there&#39;s no way, for example, to feed most of the <br/>
major cities, since there&#39;s simply no farmland left nearby.  The west, <br/>
which depends on energy-intensive irrigation and water diversion from <br/>
depleted aquifers and rivers, probably will not be able to sustain the <br/>
population it has now.  <br/>
<br/>
The thing is, whether it happens in 10 years or 25, our children are <br/>
looking at a future that is much darker than our own - at the best <br/>
economically depressed, at the worst, starving.  I don&#39;t want to sound <br/>
like the Raven, croaking &quot;Nevermore&quot; but the reason I keep singing this <br/>
tune is because I don&#39;t want anyone on this list to be unprepared.  Most <br/>
of us are lucky enough never to have heard a child say, &#39;Mommy, I&#39;m <br/>
hungry.&quot; and have to answer, &quot;There&#39;s nothing to eat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve included some references at the bottom of the page.  There are a lot <br/>
of them, so I hope it isn&#39;t overwhelming, but I want to be totally clear <br/>
that I&#39;m not the only one who believe this - in fact, this may be the only <br/>
thing on earth on which Michael Moore and Bush&#39;s Energy Czar agree on, <br/>
believe it or not.  My personal suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
Get the heck out of the cities/suburbia before it becomes obvious and the <br/>
price of rural land goes up.  In the short term, as gas prices rise, I <br/>
suspect it will go down, but don&#39;t wait to see if I&#39;m right.  There are <br/>
parts of the country where land is very cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to your family and friends about this - consider land-sharing, <br/>
community building, anything.  No one can do everything alone.<br/>
<br/>
Invest in tools for off-grid living - woodstoves, water pumps, etc... <br/>
Solar/hydro/wind is a good idea, although expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Store food and grow food - the one upside of this is that you can expect <br/>
realistically to find homesteading a lot more profitable - maybe even <br/>
self-supporting in the long term.  But remember, times will probably be <br/>
hard for a while, and it takes a good while to learn to grow enough food, <br/>
save seed and produce your own grains/animal feeds.  You are going to want <br/>
a bigger garden, and a lot of reserves - extra food, extra seeds.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect to rely on hunting - there&#39;s going to be a lot of competition <br/>
there, and during the depression, large game was hunted almost to <br/>
extinction in places.  There are a lot more people now and they have <br/>
better guns.<br/>
<br/>
Prepare your kids for a different world - teach them practical skills, and <br/>
try and have something to pass down to them - the ancestral home may <br/>
become a lot more attractive.<br/>
<br/>
Try and be as healthy as possible - medications are going to get more <br/>
unaffordable or unavailable.  Find natural remedies, learn to reproduce <br/>
them, and take good care of yourself now.  <br/>

Susan, you might be interested in biodiesel. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biodiesel.org/">http://www.biodiesel.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
Basically, you can run any diesel engine on most types of oils (corn, <br/>
soy, peanut, etc. They&#39;ve even made a biodiesel oil from squashed <br/>
bugs). We&#39;ve gotten used fryer oil from Taco Bell and processed it <br/>
into fuel for our diesel car. Already farmers are using it in their <br/>
tractors, some cities are using it in their buses, and hopefully it <br/>
will just be a matter of time before it is used in diesel trains, <br/>
trucks, motorhomes, etc. You can convert a furnace to run on it too. <br/>
As for the rest of your post, I think it&#39;s always a good idea to use <br/>
less energy, whether we reach the fuel crisis or not - we had a bad <br/>
ice storm this year for instance and couldn&#39;t drive or ride a bike <br/>
off of our hill. We used the wood stove for heat and for cooking, and <br/>
had plenty of food supplies already. It was nice to know that we&#39;re <br/>
relatively self-sufficient, at least in the short-term. We&#39;d like to <br/>
be off the grid completely eventually.<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve looked into biodiesel since two of our tactors run on deisel, but <br/>
when the crash comes I don&#39;t think there will be a whole lot available, <br/>
it will be in high demand and grain growing is energy intensive. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen articles on using the used cooking oil right from the <br/>
waste oil tanks you can find out the back of most McDonalds and <br/>
restaurants.  This seems easier, but you also need diesel or biodiesel <br/>
to get started and to run through your fuel system before shutting the <br/>
motor off.<br/>

That is something I find astonishing. Oil is a precious rescourse. We need it to make plastic. At the moment we need plastic - machines, medical equipment etc etc, yet we treat oil as if there was an infinite supply. People drive 2 miles to the store because they are too lazy to walk. Once in the store they use plastic carrier bags to pack their groceries whihc they then will throw away when they get home.<br/>
<br/>
Which is another thing about plastic. The things we use for the least amount of time get made from a material that takes hundreds of years to break down :-(<br/>
<br/>
We should be legislating for fuel efficency plus have a toll for each mile driven. We would then use less oil plus the money raised could be put into research for green fules.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley, who really should be running the world :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know that farmer&#39;s cooperatives are springing up where the farmers <br/>
use some of their crops (like soybeans) to make the oil to run the <br/>
diesel tractors. I&#39;ve read that one of the largest biodiesel <br/>
production facilities is a fermer&#39;s cooperative in Ralston Iowa. But <br/>
it&#39;s pretty easy to make your own from waste oil, even if you can&#39;t <br/>
buy it. The book &quot;From the Fryer to the Fuel Tank&quot; outlines the <br/>
process, which can be done in a garage or shed with some fairly <br/>
simple stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually (hopefully?) I imagine there will be other fuel sources as <br/>
well. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think if you use straight cooking oil, you have to filter it first, <br/>
and you have to add a conversion to the regular diesel engine that <br/>
warms it up to the appropriate temperature before running it through <br/>
the engine. If you don&#39;t want to convert the engine, you have to <br/>
first convert the waste oil into biodiesel, which is a relatively <br/>
simple chemical process. But either way, the small amount of biodisel <br/>
or regular diesel needed would be infintisimal compared to the <br/>
amounts of gas and regular diesel being used today.<br/>

This is the website of a family living in urban Pasedena, CA (part of Los<br/>
Angeles) who make their own biodiesel after collecting oil from local<br/>
restaurants. Their vehicle uses this exclusively with no special<br/>
modifications. Also they are working on becoming self sufficient for food<br/>
