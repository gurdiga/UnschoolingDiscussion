<br/>
Did he beat the child to get him to eat a tub of squash?  <br/>

If a parent whips out a spelling workbook and the child balks, what happens?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Come one, it&#39;ll be fun.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do it or lose your allowance/toy/whatever.&quot;<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
The beatings begin?<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t get it.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Father MAKES 5yo eat the entire family&#39;s servings of squash.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course fear/threats/punishments work fast. And the scars from them run <br/>
deep.<br/>

recently, would have done anything I put in front of her.  She&#39;s not<br/>
quite so pliant now that she is a teen-ager.  But I do know families for<br/>
whom that system works.  There are no beating, no bribes, it just seems<br/>
to work for them.  I think it is just differences in  personality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048214775">Well, I know a couple of ways it works, oops, make that three.<br/>
<br/>
1)  Very rigid household (this particular one is Christian) where the<br/>
children are raised from day one this way.  They don&#39;t know any different<br/>
and they are raised not to question.<br/>
<br/>
2)  The family that does believe in the spare the rod, spoil the child.<br/>
<br/>
3)  The parent in charge is an &quot;alpha&quot; personality and uses that &quot;alpha&quot;<br/>
ability to &quot;rule&quot; their roost.<br/>
