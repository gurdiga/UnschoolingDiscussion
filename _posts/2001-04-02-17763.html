 </span></blockquote>   I meant in the condo. We live in the upstairs unit and it is loud w/ wood <br/>
floors. We spend so much time outside. I am trying to teach her respect for <br/>
others also. Out here she has been a wildchild which has been great (most of <br/>
the time)but she doesn&#39;t get the whole respect for others concept yet. <br/>
believe me there is no taming of this child. She is a major individual and I <br/>
would never try and tame her. We do all need to respect others though.<br/>
