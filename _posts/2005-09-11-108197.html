Whats monkey platters?  Sounds interesting.  My 6 yr. old gets really grumpy too when he&#39;s hungry.  When I hear him being that way a little pick me up works wonders.  He doesnt realize thats what is happening at the time but after a quick bite he&#39;s back to himself.<br/>

  I take monkey platters to Duncan (9) and his friends all the time. He&#39;s learning to ask for them now---when or *before* he needs them. THAT&#39;s what you&#39;ll see if you take care of him now. <br/>
