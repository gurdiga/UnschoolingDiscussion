Title:	 	 Unschooling Circuit Riders<br/>
Description:	 	<br/>
Have you attended a unschooling conference wishing you could go to more during the year? <br/>
Have you never had a chance to attend a conference and have heard everyone sharing how <br/>
much they loved the one that just past? Do you belong to unschooling yahoo groups but <br/>
don&#39;t have time to get on and read as much as you would like since you are busy doing other <br/>
things with your family?<br/>
<br/>
Here is one place where all unschooling conferences, gatherings and events can be posted so <br/>
that those of us who would like to &quot;ride the circuit&quot; can easily find which ones are coming up. <br/>
<br/>
If you know of an unschooling event that is not posted here, please add it to our list! :)</div>
