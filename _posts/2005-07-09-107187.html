<div id="ygrps-yiv-369616212">I&#39;ve thought just the things that the article talks about, from &quot;At least MY <br/>
kids aren&#39;t THAT bad&quot; to &quot;is the family really being themselves, with a <br/>
camera there?&quot; along with &quot;well, not having rules and schedules doesn&#39;t <br/>
translate straight across to out of control kids (my family being a terrific <br/>
example of just that)&quot; and &quot;I know that unschooling doesn&#39;t produce familiy <br/>
dynamics like this&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, I must say, one of the episodes I watched all the way through <br/>
really showed the value of having that camera running. It was a set of four <br/>
year old twins, out of control, rude, nasty little girls, and their nine <br/>
year old brother (who also had his issues, but it really was about the <br/>
twins) Well, there was a camera running in his room, when he was sitting <br/>
doing his homework (because of the camera? hmmm) and the twins were being <br/>
obnoxious as all get out, pestering him and disrupting what he was trying to <br/>
do. Finally, he shouted at the girls, and the mom came busting into the <br/>
room, shouting at HIM, for raising his voice to the twins, and then shouting <br/>
at him some more, for talking back to her when he tried to explain.<br/>
<br/>
When they showed the mom that footage, you could see how appalled she was, <br/>
in her face. The nanny was trying to get across how the older child was <br/>
starting to feel resentful, because he was blamed so often for altercations <br/>
with the twins, and the mom was denying it...and then she saw that clip.<br/>

&gt;I think this article about nanny reality shows is interesting, and some <br/>
&gt;school issues are mentioned as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565624824">I also wanted to point out one thing that the article doesn&#39;t get <br/>
around to mentioning, and that is, part of every day that the Nanny <br/>
schedules, is the mom and dad spending play time with their kids. It <br/>
might be scheduled, but the nanny does teach the parents the <br/>
importance of spending relaxed, enjoyable time with their children. <br/>
The article didn&#39;t bring that little tid-bit up. Though I do agree <br/>
with the main gist of the article, I think the author of it also has <br/>
his point to make, and left out what didn&#39;t seem important: <br/>
Supernanny&#39;s techniques aren&#39;t conducive to healthy child-parent <br/>
relationships, so I just won&#39;t mention that part of Supernanny&#39;s <br/>
instruction to the parents that CAN BE conducive the health of their <br/>
relationship. <br/>
