<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; s there a natural remedy for arthritis pain?  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ambersand (Kandi, right?) :-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if anyone else has answered this yet- I&#39;m on digest, so I&#39;m <br/>
answering as I go.  There are many things to take for arthritis pain that are <br/>
natural.  From glucosamine to homeopathic supplements.  The best thing you <br/>
could do is visit your local health food store- or if there are any good <br/>
natural remedy websites (Does anyone know any?), and get some information.  <br/>
Usually people who own the h.f. stores are very knowledgable, if not degreed, <br/>
in natural healing.  Just doing a bit of research for yourself and matching <br/>
the available remedies with your needs usually works great. Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
  IMHO, going natural is always best and more effective in the long run, <br/>
instead of using the chemicals- including the antiobiotics that are beginning <br/>
not to be affective anyway.  Chemical antiobiotics also wreak havoc in other <br/>
ways in our bodies.  Natural remedies don&#39;t.  Unless you take say an herb <br/>
with a chemical remedy. There&#39;s lots to say on this subject!  That&#39;s why it&#39;s <br/>
best to just grab a book from the library, pull up a website, or talk to your <br/>
health food store owner to see what&#39;s right for you.  Hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1959728825">I think dairy and wheat are huge influences on arthritis. . . I think you can <br/>
get some major relief if eliminating those products  (much easier said than <br/>
done!!)<br/>
