<br/>
Because there’s “cash and valuable prizes” involved, and it won’t be difficult for her to pass it, she should just get one, so her dad will pay for her classes.  It’s not difficult or expensive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758139838">-=-I think that it depends on the state that you live in.  Our state has raised the minimum mandatory school attendance age to 18, but has left the age at which you can take the GED at 16. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It has always depended on the state.  Kids from New Mexico used to go out of state, but they lowered the age here (years ago; I haven’t needed to know for a long time).<br/>
<br/>
But “mandatory school attendance” doesn’t apply to kids who are out legitimately, and homeschooled kids are legitimately out.  And if the parent says “We’re done, now, he’s graduated, let him take the test,” that can work.<br/>
<br/>
Also, even when that age is in place, there ARE ways to drop out, and ways to leave early, always, in the fine print.  And to attend a different school (which might require a GED) would not stump very many school administrators, on letting a kid out.<br/>
