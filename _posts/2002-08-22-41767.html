I spend a lot of time travelling through Canada on my way to and from <br/>
Alaska. Five trips so far this year. One of my favorite foods en <br/>
route is called poutine (Tia - did I spell that right?), which is <br/>
french fries smothered in gravy. Sometimes onions and cheese will be <br/>

And forget about trying to order *oatmeal.* I carry my own supply of <br/>

those cold frosty morns :)  <br/>
Canadians and Aussies must be very similiar in names of food.  I have <br/>
canadian friends who I talk to online and it&#39;s quite funny the amount <br/>
of times they say &#39;please explain the lingo&#39; (g)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s right.  I recognize &quot;oatmeal&quot; from growing up in the States, but <br/>
yes, people here call it porridge.  My husband calls it poo-idge, but <br/>
that&#39;s another story.  &lt;g&gt;  He really doesn&#39;t like it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I *love* your beautiful island - I&#39;ve been there twice already this <br/>
year! We usually travel the Inside Passage, via Port Hardy to Prince <br/>
Rupert and then picking up the Alaska State Ferry System from there. <br/>
It&#39;s far and away my favorite route to and from Alaska. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we also love just wandering around Vancouver Island; we&#39;ve stayed <br/>
overnight in several towns, including Victoria, Nanaimo, Campbell <br/>
River and Port Hardy. We really want to explore the northwest coast, <br/>
and we&#39;d love to take our sailboat out exploring the islands in the <br/>
channel some day. A year or so ago Mark and our ex-columnist Jeff <br/>
Kelety made plans to sail their two boats from Port Townsend (WA) up <br/>
the coast and into Victoria Harbor, but stuff happened and we never <br/>
firmed up the plans.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the invitation - next time we&#39;re headed up (or down) your <br/>
way I&#39;ll definitely get in touch!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm. No, it&#39;s the smashed up spuds... My Dad particularly loves them <br/>
and has tried to order them on many trips across Canada - only to <br/>
meet with puzzled looks.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of a story he tells about one trip when he and Mom <br/>
ran out of bread somewhere up in the north country, a long ways (like <br/>
hundreds of miles) from the nearest store. They stopped in at a <br/>
wilderness lodge and asked if they could buy four slices of bread, as <br/>
they had their own sandwich makings. The waitress at the lodge said <br/>
they didn&#39;t sell bread. Dad asked if they sold toast as a side order. <br/>
Yes, she said, of course they did. &quot;So,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;d like two <br/>
orders of toast, unsliced and untoasted.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

something. We&#39;ve found a number of things with different names north <br/>

person is saying. Like &#39;pigs fly&#39;, &#39;you&#39;re having me on&#39; &#39;I can smell <br/>
the crap from here&#39; and stuff like that. I bet you guys have your own <br/>
quaint sayings too - care to share :) I&#39;d love to surprise my friend!<br/>
My friend, Kevin, lives in Toronto and recently took his family out <br/>
into the wilderness - no electricity,no running water and NO <br/>
toilets!  He said he was &#39;backed up&#39; in fear of all the bugs and that <br/>
there was a massive struggle for who got the shower when they got <br/>
home.  He won! His poor wife, Nic, gave in, exhausted!  Ya gotta love <br/>
nature :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442509654">One food I have trouble finding is chocolate malt o meal. My kids LOVE it but I can not find it anywhere except in Texas and Oklahoma. So I have family mail us boxes of it. Right now we have about 5 boxes. Also, I noticed here, where I live, that people love to put chili on spaghetti. I personally don&#39;t like it, but while traveling it is fun to see the different foods. Grits is a fun one. I don&#39;t care for it, but if you let it sit long enough, it will hold the shape of whatever it sat in. Something fun for the kiddles to experiment with :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462382050">Hello from Australia: <br/>
I can confirm that oatmeal is porridge here, <br/>
but we have two different substances called molasses<br/>
and treacle, they are different stages of processing,<br/>
molasses is very black (full of iron) whereas treacle<br/>
is a dark brown, golden syrup is lighter again, I<br/>
don&#39;t know what sohrgum is. I&#39;ve had to learn a few<br/>
terms as I used to edit Australian books which were<br/>
being reprinted for the US market.<br/>
Enjoying the group so far, reading mostly.<br/>
