&gt; &gt;I&#39;m in the same situation with Lars, and the one I worry about is mumps<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just so folks know it&#39;s not always so terrible to have these things as <br/>

I had chicken pox at age 27 and it was kind of like the flu only itchy and <br/>
not so bad.  The itching wasn&#39;t as bad as poison oak and I kept thinking, <br/>
&quot;Thank god I didn&#39;t have this as a kid because it would be sooooo hard not to <br/>
scratch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My husband had mumps in his early thirties and we were a little panicked <br/>
since we&#39;d neglected to have kids so far!  But when we looked into it we <br/>
learned that only 10% of adult male mumps cases have testiculur involvement <br/>
and of those only 10% lead to sterility, and then just on one side almost <br/>
always.<br/>
<br/>
Pam T. who has two kids now who are vaccinated except for chicken pox and <br/>
they already had that<br/>
