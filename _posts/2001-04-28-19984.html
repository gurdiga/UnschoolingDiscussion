&lt;&lt; Dh is taking a business trip near Valley Forge, PA.  We are thinking about<br/>
 joining him.  Is there anybody close by that wants to get together with us?<br/>
 We would be looking for something to keep us busy during the week while he<br/>
 works and then sight seeing on the weekend.  I am not sure if it will be one<br/>
 or two weeks.<br/>

    How much driving freedom will you have?  I&#39;m not in PA but grew up there. <br/>
Valley Forge itself is great. The museums in Phila. are great and go for the <br/>
Ben Franklin Institute for sure.  Further afield I&#39;d say Hawk Mountain, <br/>
Hershey Park (fun and choc.) merry Mead Farm in Lansdale area (great <br/>
ice-cream). There is a great train ride and such in Lancaster and I am <br/>
drawing a blank for the name ugh! Lancaster itself would be fun to tour <br/>
around.OH! If you all like walking around towns and such I&#39;d hit NewHope and <br/>
then cross the bridge to Jersey......more shops and such (Frenchtown) You <br/>
could visit a winery in Bucks County, Buckingham Valley Vineyard they do <br/>
tours and such. I believe you can get something from the Chamber on covered <br/>
bridges and go from bridge to bridge, great scenery. Peddlers Village in <br/>
Bucks County is great too. How old are your kids? I&#39;ll keep thinking.<br/>

great. I cannot stand this type of bribery myself. I am also against a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875525266">Actually this time I guess we won&#39;t be coming as we just found out it is<br/>
only a 5 day trip.  Hopefully in the near future he will be coming again.<br/>
But if summer comes too quickly here, we will be swamped in plans we already<br/>
have.  :0)  Thanks for your thoughts and time.  I will save them for the<br/>
future.<br/>
