one point Marty left for an R-rated movie, saying if he couldn&#39;t get in he&#39;d be <br/>
back.   (He took a separate car so if he was turned back the older two boys <br/>
could still get in.)   <br/>

Keith&#39;s mom told us he doesn&#39;t need to see an R rated movie.   She said, &quot;If <br/>
*I* were doing it, I wouldn&#39;t let him go, but I&#39;m not doing it.&quot;   Keith <br/>
looked over her shoulder at me with an amused look, like &quot;your move&quot; to me.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Have you seen any problems with our kids?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said with a &quot;knowing&quot; tone:   &quot;Not YET.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;They&#39;ve all been watching R rated movies their whole lives.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She muttered on something about Marty being right at that age, though (when <br/>
problems should start).<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 13, 16 and 18 and have NOT had problems.<br/>
Still, she figures it&#39;s any day now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am reminded of an incident with my ex and his wife<br/>
over the boys watching &#39;Down Periscope&#39; (PG-13<br/>
maybe?).  They blew up all over me about the<br/>
&#39;inappropriate language&#39; etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The boys were 8 and 10 at the time, I think.  We<br/>
watched it all together and found it hysterically<br/>
funny.  Early in the film and only one time, Kelsey<br/>
Grammer was outraged and used the word &quot;fuck&quot;.  This<br/>
is what the ex and his wife were spewing venom at me<br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, I asked my then-8, now almost 16yo what he<br/>
remembered about the film.  His reply, &quot;There was that<br/>
guy making whale sounds and the guy who farted.  It<br/>
was FUNNY!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Scarred?  I don&#39;t really think so.  At least, not by<br/>
that movie.  The ex?  That&#39;s another story...<br/>

know *I* sure would have loved to have a friend like him when I was that <br/>
age... in fact, it&#39;s an honor to know him now &lt;vbg&gt; <br/>

expected to hear -- glad you surprised her by biting your tongue and <br/>
remaining civil :)  [he doesn&#39;t *NEED* a pissy gramma, he doesn&#39;t <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids, too.  Guess I figured out pretty quickly that the attitude <br/>
scars far more than film can! <br/>
The people I babysit for have their movies separated for adults & <br/>
children; recently I went thru them with the mom, she was looking for my <br/>
advice to broaden her children&#39;s selection.  Most of the movies now left <br/>
in the &#39;adult cabinet&#39; are movies my kids wouldn&#39;t ask to see anyway or <br/>
would walk out of if they saw them playing.  The adults have seen all <br/>
the movies they own, they *know* if their kids would enjoy them or not, <br/>
the separation ceremony seems more of a marker for being a &quot;good mommy&quot; <br/>
with her.  Hayden and I once watched the &quot;Atomic Bomb Movie&quot; (Hannah was <br/>
not interested) with the dad; I was shocked he had never watched this <br/>
movie with his own kids, he&#39;d never considered it until he saw Hayden&#39;s <br/>
enthusiasm for watching and talking and aaaaawwwwwing.  We&#39;ve since <br/>
watched a couple of other A-bomb movies and really enjoyed discussing <br/>
the topic from many different perspectives (another great reason to <br/>
return to NM-the atomic museum)<br/>

what? you think you&#39;re doing a better job than she did with her son??  <br/>

problem, even the normal ones tons of adults get into, she&#39;ll blame it <br/>
on how you raised them.<br/>
&quot;If only you had kept them away from those R rated movies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know that in our family the belief is that Josh&#39;s eccentricities and <br/>
reading &quot;issues&quot; all have to do with unschooling/homeschooling and <br/>
nothing to do with inborn personalities and just being himself. They <br/>
actually believe that if he went to school he would have been a totally <br/>
different person....they might be right, but what I imagine is he would <br/>
have been a totally miserable teen.<br/>
