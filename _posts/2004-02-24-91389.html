<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860053976">Hello All,<br/>
<br/>
I am planning a messy day with the children and we would like to do something with clay. I have some recipes for home made clay but it never really worked for us, so I want to visit Michael&#39;s and get something from their. <br/>
<br/>
Can any of you suggest a brand or a type of clay for small and medium size projects, figurines, sculptures etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181766739">Sculpey! It is very cool stuff. You can bake it in the oven once you&#39;ve made your creation and then paint it. It comes in white or colors. You can make jewelry with it to, which is lots of fun. I&#39;d highly recommend it!<br/>

love Sculpey!<br/>
<br/>
They also sell a larger box of plain ol&#39; clay... you might have to ask, <br/>
because it&#39;s very non-descript. However, it&#39;s an air dry clay, so there&#39;s <br/>
no oven baking involved. It comes in white/grey and a terra cotta color. I <br/>
think it was something like $12 for a larger-than-a-shoebox box of it.<br/>
<br/>
They used it to make jars and bowls and such... things bigger than Sculpey, <br/>
for much less money.<br/>

variety of wonderful colors, then you put it in a glass oven proof dish and back <br/>
for 15 min for each 1/4 inch thickness.  I ball park it.  At 275 degrees.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be exact in the timing.  <br/>
<br/>
There is also something put out by crayola usually with all the other crayola <br/>
stuff.  It is like a really light clay, light as in light weight.  You mold <br/>
it and it air dries into something in the range of Styrofoam for weight, they <br/>
have some colors but you can paint it when you are done and just use the white.<br/>
<br/>
Also I saw yesterday they had a clay that is more like potters clay, they had <br/>
white, and several different brown colors.  That also has to air dry.  <br/>
<br/>
Those are the ones that don&#39;t need any special equipment or a kiln.<br/>
<br/>
We love clay and have lots of fun and have used both the sculpey stuff that <br/>
you bake in the oven and the crayola stuff.  The boys like the sculpey stuff <br/>
more. I think it is because they have so many different colors.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234841247">At craft stores there is also a clay that hardens when it is put into water<br/>
ï¿½ a physics concept (or is it chemistry?) that confuses the heck out of me.<br/>
It is white, soft to manipulate and can be painted after it is hardened and<br/>
then dried off. I have used it to make miniature accessories for set models.<br/>
