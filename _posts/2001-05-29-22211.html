<div id="ygrps-yiv-354435281">I&#39;m happy to say, it wasn&#39;t me :-).  I&#39;m a happy Tammy. I&#39;ve always taken on the<br/>
Thumper&#39;s father advise, &quot;If you cannot say something nice, don&#39;t say anything<br/>
at all.&quot;  Of course, there are times when that does change but not usually on a<br/>
post. I believe everyone has a opinion and I listen to everyone, but ultimately,<br/>
make my own decisions.<br/>
