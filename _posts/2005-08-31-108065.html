<div id="ygrps-yiv-639920553">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Denise, who lives north of NEW ORLEANS has asked me to post a message.  If anyone can <br/>
help them, it would be GREATLY appreciated.  Alison <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abzb@...">abzb@...</a>   Here&#39;s the <br/>
message:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been staying in Houston and don&#39;t have a hotel room anymore so we&#39;re trying to get <br/>
into the Parish today.  If we can&#39;t, is there anyone in the Baton Rouge area who could be a <br/>
back up for us to find us shelter.  If you cab could you call Alison @ 310 828-5788 (home) <br/>
or 310 403-5788 (cell) and she can relay the message to me (Denise).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Denise</div>
