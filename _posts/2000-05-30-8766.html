<div id="ygrps-yiv-205973552">&lt;&lt; Thank heaven for strawberries!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well,....<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Weil, a doctor who is heading the campaign to bring together traditional medicine and alternative medicine, says &quot;I have written of the dangers of agrichermicals and of my strong belief in the importance of organic agriculture, which, I am happy to report, is growing exponentially...learn which crops are most likely to carry unhealthful residues of pesticides and fungicides and avoid them if you cannot find organic versions. The list of suspect crops changes over time, but strawberries always top it. They are often full of methyl bromide, a fungicide and known carcinogen, that consumer pressure has so far been unsuccessful in eliminating, and I do not eat them if I cannot find organizally grown ones.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Strawberries and white grapes used to be one of the ways I got through summer (I hate heat and humidity). Sigh. I have a crop in the garden, but it only produces once. Eating organic strawberries is tantamount to eating money, so we usually go without.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone ever heard of ground cherries? They&#39;re sweet and wonderful, a relative of tomatillos. My grandfather used to have them in his garden and I try to, but they are getting harder and harder to find.<br/>
