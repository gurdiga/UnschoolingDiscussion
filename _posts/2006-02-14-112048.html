<div id="ygrps-yiv-449989109">We use 3 computers, an xbox and a playstation all hooked in through <br/>
a wireless router. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that works with dial-up internet, only high speed (DSL <br/>
or Cable)<br/>
<br/>
Routers are about $40 at Bast Buy, and pretty easy to set up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336904751">I might be able to help with this one. <br/>
  First thing&#39;s first,...find out if you can get DSL in your area. I see that you have a sbcglobal.net ISP so I am assuming that you can. <br/>
  Next, you will need to buy a router and wireless cards for the back of the computers. <br/>
  Once you do that you should be able to follow the directions and get them set up!<br/>
  I would suggest microsoft as a go to. They always have decent equipment and the insructions are easy to follow. <br/>
  Also, this will free up the phone line and you will be able to get rid of the 2nd one. <br/>
  Hope this helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-725266896">You need a &quot;router&quot;.   In the past we have had as many as 5 different<br/>
computers on the internet (at different sites)  at the same time.   Even<br/>
when ALL were on internet,  it was still faster than when only one was on<br/>
phone line.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 Are you in an area where you could get cable or high speed rather than<br/>
using a phone dial up?   I cannot imagine  a scenario that a 3rd phoneline<br/>
would be an economical solution. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39321674">We have Internet through the cable company, so it may not be the same as <br/>
using phone lines.<br/>
<br/>
You probably just need to buy a router, which allows 2 or more computers to <br/>
be hooked up to the one Internet connection.  Your modem connects to your <br/>
computer via the router.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a way to &quot;network&quot; the computers that are hooked up that way <br/>
so that files can be viewed on more than one computer and printers can be <br/>
shared.   I only know how to do this with Windows XP, which walks you <br/>
through the procedure.  One of the computers on my home network is running <br/>
Windows 98.  It connected easily, but I haven&#39;t managed to get it to work <br/>
with the computer running Windows 2000.<br/>
