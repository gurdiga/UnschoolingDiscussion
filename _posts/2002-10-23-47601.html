How about an idea that might help you?<br/>
<br/>
I went back and counted.  I&#39;ve written 12 emails to this list in the last 2<br/>
days.  I think that&#39;s a record for me.  I have no idea how many you&#39;ve<br/>
written, but I know it&#39;s been a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem you&#39;re having about accuracy is related to sheer<br/>
quantity of email.  Not every single reply to something you&#39;ve said needs an<br/>
answer.  The quantity of mail would be horrendous if everybody replied that<br/>
many times.  (It&#39;s already pretty heavy today!)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would help if you read email in blocks (getting on digest helps for<br/>
that) and then answered those messages that you really felt needed an<br/>
answer.  I find that when I read a bunch, then write, I&#39;ve had time to<br/>
think, and I benefit from having heard other folks&#39; perspectives as well.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note, I find it easier to read your posts when you space<br/>
between quotes and commentary.  That helps me.  The ones that run together<br/>
are tough to read. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you are learning and growing from your reading here.  I am.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-980050651">Hi Brenda,<br/>
Yes, I have wrote a lot, more than I have time for, really. I&#39;ve deleted a lot, but most seem to address me and ask things of me in particular. Ho Hum. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also noticed that the spaces don&#39;t always appear, and wondered why. Anyone have any ideas? I enter at least twice before and after, and usually have a good inch space on my screen before I send it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your suggestions. Yes, I am DEFINITELY learning. <br/>
