<div id="ygrps-yiv-73819122">Thanks Pam for sharing this,  I&#39;m late in getting this out.   I think its helpful for people to see how a transformation can take place.<br/>
<br/>
Your transformation/experience in &quot;getting&quot; unschooling is similar to mine.   I read and read and read, oh did I say that I read?  &lt;g&gt;   It just clicked.  Made soo much sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
**What got me to this <br/>
place was that there were people way out ahead of me - shining a light <br/>
and beckoning and giving me real clear no-nonsense uncluttered <br/>
direction.**   <br/>
<br/>
I think that light was shining brightly for me also!  Right here at unschooling.com and Sandra&#39;s web site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But then,,instead of sitting and thinking about these &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot;---  I just jumped in,  head first,  no looking back.  Which sometimes can be quite a shock for some..my dh especially.    I look back now and wonder if I was too impulsive,  too brash?    <br/>
<br/>
Nahhhh,  I did my research, my reading and you know what?  In my  heart I knew  that I was doing the right thing.  How could it be wrong?<br/>
<br/>
My kids have loved the change,  its been over a year now and I&#39;m so glad that it wasn&#39;t a shock to them.   I know others have said that some kids have had a hard time with the change.   Mine have not.   Maybe its an age thing,  mine are still quite young, 10, 8 and 6.  Maybe its a personality thing.   Maybe we rode the tide of change together, so it was OK.   We talk alot,  maybe that&#39;s it?   I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I guess to me as long as we listen to our children and figure out what they need and like,  it can&#39;t be bad.   If a child wants some structure, we can help them find it.  If a child wants freedom its there.   <br/>
<br/>
Its interesting the way change takes place in peoples lives.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your post!<br/>
<br/>

  &gt; No, I only asked because.. well, I think I stated the reasons I asked <br/>
  &gt; in my<br/>
  &gt; original post.   I just meant, if you are a close, personal friend <br/>
  &gt; with someone<br/>
  &gt; in real life, its much easier to &quot;know&quot; and understand thier <br/>
  &gt; communications<br/>
  &gt; online.<br/>
<br/>
  This discussion got me thinking about how I got started down this <br/>
  unschooling road and what really helped me. Although I&#39;d been enamored <br/>
  of Summerhill and the free school movement way back in the late 60&#39;s, I <br/>
  first read about unschooling on the AOL message boards. I was a quick <br/>
  study - the minute I read the first few posts I was hooked and I <br/>
  immediately ordered every back issue of Growing Without Schooling - and <br/>
  read every one of John Holt&#39;s books and reread Summerville (having read <br/>
  it as a college student) and so on. I was thrilled with the whole <br/>
  concept of unschooling. Still, I had hang-ups. I was very very <br/>
  &quot;well-schooled&quot; and it was scary to think of not guiding my children <br/>
  along that same path of straight &quot;A&#39;s&quot; and honor societies and teacher <br/>
  recommendations, etc. My own self-esteem was very wrapped up in my <br/>
  school successes and degrees and professional life and I was afraid not <br/>
  to push my children in that same direction.<br/>
<br/>
  I asked a lot of questions. I got a lot of answers that varied from <br/>
  &quot;take it one step at a time&quot; to &quot;you can&#39;t unschool part time, it is <br/>
  all or nothing.&quot; I confess I got a THRILL from the radical unschooling <br/>
  answers. The more firm and blunt and clear, the better. I absolutely <br/>
  needed the uncluttered-with-caveats and apology-free absolutist kinds <br/>
  of statements that I heard from a number of people, but most especially <br/>
  from Sandra. Anything less than that created more clutter in my <br/>
  already-teeming brain. I was trying desperately to come to the most <br/>
  important decision in my life (and, yes, that is how I DID think of <br/>
  education - the MOST important decision) and I didn&#39;t need to be <br/>
  coddled and I didn&#39;t want to hear watered-down ideas, I wanted straight <br/>
  talk and nothing less. I skimmed over the posts that told me that <br/>
  whatever worked for my family was what I should do. It was just a kind <br/>
  of feel-good, everybody is okay, nonsense that said nothing and didn&#39;t <br/>
  help me at all. I soon learned which posters would answer my questions <br/>
  with concrete real solid-thinking advice and information and principles <br/>
  and ideals and who would just say, &quot;Whatever&quot; (except, unfortunately, <br/>
  they&#39;d say it at great length). I skipped the &quot;Whatevers&quot; and avidly <br/>
  read (and reread) the hard-hitting stuff.<br/>
<br/>
  Then there was a conference scheduled in my neck of the woods (Los <br/>
  Angeles area) and Sandra was going to speak at it. I bravely wrote to <br/>
  her offlist and offered to pick her up at the airport and take her to <br/>
  her hotel. She seemed a bit taken aback, but she let me do it and I got <br/>
  to meet her and her family. We continued, over the years, to find ways <br/>
  to meet in person and we have become good friends. The first time I <br/>
  heard Sandra speak, she talked about &quot;thinking dangerous thoughts.&quot; <br/>
  This was EXACTLY what I was struggling with. I had all these radical <br/>
  scary dangerous ideas now filling my head and I was a bit paralyzed, <br/>
  mentally, because I had some real decisions to make. Sandra said, &quot;If <br/>
  you&#39;re really afraid, duct-tape yourself to a chair or get a spotter <br/>
  and just sit there and think all the dangerous thoughts you want. When <br/>
  you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll still be sitting in that chair and you can, if you <br/>
  want to, get up and live your life as if none of those thoughts had <br/>
  ever existed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I was electrified. It hit me that I could just do it - just think as <br/>
  radically and extremely as I could possibly manage - and that it didn&#39;t <br/>
  mean I was stuck or that I had to actually DO anything. I just needed <br/>
  to stop worrying and really open up and think. It changed my life. It <br/>
  was absolutely the right thing for someone to say at absolutely the <br/>
  right time. I thought, honestly, about what my schooling had really <br/>
  done to me. I thought about how superficial my experience had been - <br/>
  high school, college, and grad school. I thought about how unrewarding <br/>
  my career really was, how I felt like I was doing nothing worthwhile, <br/>
  just earning money. I thought about what I&#39;d been like as a toddler and <br/>
  preschool-age kid - how learning had been so exciting and how I&#39;d been <br/>
  so passionate and enthusiastic about everything. I thought about how <br/>
  I&#39;d lost that and how that was really, ultimately, losing out on loving <br/>
  life itself.<br/>
<br/>
  I literally sat, in a chair, and did nothing but urge myself on - <br/>
  trying, on purpose, to think things that were difficult for me. (No, I <br/>
  didn&#39;t duct-tape myself to the chair - I didn&#39;t need to, I got the <br/>
  point.) If I started to feel uncomfortable about something I was <br/>
  considering, I&#39;d force myself to think even more about it, not to shy <br/>
  away from it.<br/>
<br/>
  I am now as confident in unschooling as I am confident that I live in <br/>
  California and have three daughters and a husband and am sitting here <br/>
  typing on a nice new iBook. In other words, I have absolutely no doubts <br/>
  about unschooling. Unschooling is as natural to me now as eating and <br/>
  sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t get to this place of confidence overnight. What got me to this <br/>
  place was that there were people way out ahead of me - shining a light <br/>
  and beckoning and giving me real clear no-nonsense uncluttered <br/>
  direction. If they&#39;d met me where I was - we&#39;d all still be there.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, Sandra is now a dear friend of mine and I adore her and owe her <br/>
  more than I&#39;ll ever be able to repay. There are also a lot of other <br/>
  people who were down there at the end of the unschooling road urging me <br/>
  on and some of you are here and remember me then and know how far I&#39;ve <br/>
  come!  All the time I was devouring every word they wrote, there were <br/>
  people nitpicking and criticizing their posting style and their tone <br/>
  and saying they should be more gentle, etc. That they just kept going <br/>
  and helping and were tireless in answering questions with infinite <br/>
  patience and stamina and are STILL doing it today - is an amazing <br/>
  testimony to their good-heartedness and, mostly, to how much they <br/>
  deeply care about children. My kids are lucky that they know Sandra <br/>
  and, believe me, they know that the magical life they lead is largely <br/>
  due to her influence. They love her as much as I do. I hope that every <br/>
  mom who is just starting out considering homeschooling gets as lucky as <br/>
  I did and finds their path lit as brightly as mine was.<br/>
