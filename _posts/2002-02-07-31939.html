<br/>
THE FLORIDA KIDS HAVE DONE IT AGAIN!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve organized another amazing youth liberation conference!<br/>
CELEBRATE YOUTH!: A CONFERENCE ON LIBERATION will take place<br/>
Friday, Feb. 15 through Sunday, Feb. 17, 2002, in sunny St. <br/>
Petersburg.<br/>
<br/>
This three-day gathering will incorporate discussion, analysis and <br/>
hands-on activities in the form of workshops, panels and <br/>
presentations. The goal is to develop an understanding of the various <br/>
forms of oppression confronting American youth and to equip us with <br/>
the tools we need to dismantle these sick systems in favor of a <br/>
healthier approach to learning and living. Of course, we will also <br/>
have fun with activities such as a picnic, games, a concert, an open <br/>
mic night and a mass bike ride.<br/>
<br/>
Through this conference, we hope to empower youth and their adult <br/>
allies from a variety of communities and diverse backgrounds to begin <br/>
building a society based on freedom and respect, rather than <br/>
oppression and domination.<br/>
<br/>

*DISMANTLING WHITE SUPREMACY<br/>
