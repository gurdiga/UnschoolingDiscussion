<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090293613">Until my Dungeons and Dragons loving son gets up and has a chance to hear<br/>
this question and come up with an answer for you (and I know he&#39;ll want to),<br/>
I thought I&#39;d post this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/library">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/library</a><br/>
<br/>
(see also <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/29/">http://www.boingboing.net/2005/08/29/</a><br/>

<br/>
Wizards of the Coast will sponsor after-school D&D programs in public<br/>
libaries. (Note the &quot;after-school&quot; - this is not a specifically home-<br/>
or unschooling activity.)<br/>
<br/>
The Afternoon Adventure with DUNGEONS & DRAGONS program will include<br/>
everything librarians need to start regular gaming programs in their<br/>
library with the original pen-and-paper roleplaying game Dungeons &<br/>
Dragons (D&D for short). Players assume the persona of fantasy<br/>
characters and pursue magical adventures, confronting and solving<br/>
problems using strategic thinking and teamwork. For three decades,<br/>
D&D has appealed to an ever-increasing population of fans for its use<br/>
of imagination and storytelling over competition. This free program<br/>
will include a Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game (a $24.99 value),<br/>
instructions for starting a D&D group in the library, a guide to<br/>
using D&D as an introduction to library use, recommended reading<br/>
lists, and other practical resources.<br/>

<br/>
I also know that he just recently bought the DandD for Dummies book, just<br/>
for fun recently.  I thought that was pretty well written.  He really likes<br/>
the idea of bringing new people into the fold.<br/>
