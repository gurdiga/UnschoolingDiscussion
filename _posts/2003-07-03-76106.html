                  <br/>
 Also there is some type of emblem on the right that says:  &quot;Educational <br/>
Assistance Council&quot; (LOL, sorry, can&#39;t draw this.<br/>
<br/>
It asks numerous questions such as:<br/>
     The customary name, address, phone, etc.<br/>
     Then wants to know info about your school rank, GPA, etc.<br/>
     Information about Heritage, Racial, ID (illegal to ask),           <br/>
Religious background, Organizations, Talents, skills,<br/>
            Hobbies, Competitive Sports, Colleges Interested in,<br/>
            Desired College Majors, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
THEN ON THE BACK IN SMALL PRINT (COULD BE HARD TO FIND, BUT IN BLUE ALSO, #28 <br/>
TELLS ABOUT FEES & REMITTANCE.<br/>
<br/>
It then goes on to say to &quot;Make Checks Payable to EAC&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you determine if this is the same paper we received.  If NOT, <br/>
please share the one you received so we can ALL BE AWARE OF THAT ONE TOO!<br/>

Thank you. I just had Tara bring the paper in and it was exactly as you<br/>
said. I would have looked it over sooner or later, you just helped save me<br/>
some time. Thanks again.<br/>
