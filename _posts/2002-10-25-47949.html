&lt;&lt; UG! This whole post is just really, really repulsive to me. Do you have<br/>
 any idea what kind of crap people do to their kids out there? Is it okay<br/>
 for parents to make their kids drink piss because they forgot to flush<br/>
 the toilet? How about beating them bloody for not brushing their hair<br/>
 right and then locking them in a hot, stuffy attic room for 3 days with<br/>
 no bathroom and no food? Is that really all okay with God? If he<br/>
 intentionally places kids with those parents then he&#39;s one sick bastard. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AMEN Dar!!<br/>
I feel that posts like that are purposely inflammatory at this list and the <br/>
poster damn well knows it.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s your view, but it is not appropriate here and that should be <br/>
obvious at this point. <br/>
Sick.<br/>

motivations.<br/>
<br/>
In my teens and 20&#39;s my world view was that there were regular people and<br/>
abnormal people. If I made a statement about how people should behave, it<br/>
applied just to regular people.<br/>
<br/>
The statement &quot;Parents have a right to raise their children as they see fit&quot;<br/>
is, I&#39;m thinking, intended to apply only to people who are fit to be<br/>
parents. Others are abusers and need dealt with separately.<br/>
<br/>
So the thought that abusers are not included is automatically implied in<br/>
this way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
(And, yes, it&#39;s making my head spin trying to get my thinking back to that<br/>
mode!)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s also making it more difficult to discuss is that there are different<br/>
definitions of abuse being used also.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps at the heart is a disagreement on the degree of damage that<br/>
spanking, verbal lashings, yelling, being removed from the home, etc. have<br/>
on a child.<br/>
