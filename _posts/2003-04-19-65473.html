<br/>
Have been swamped here, and almost missed this message from you. <br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;ve never performed at Jonesboro, although that is the secret desire of <br/>
every storyteller on the planet.  :-)  As a matter of fact, I hate to admit <br/>
that I&#39;ve never even been to the festival, which is an absolute shame.  It is <br/>
the Mecca of storytelling, that&#39;s for sure.  Someday.  Someday.<br/>
