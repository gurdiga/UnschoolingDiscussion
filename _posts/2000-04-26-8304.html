<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Tam posted the Wall Street Journal article to our list, and I thought some of<br/>
&gt; you might be interested in reading the National Home Education Network&#39;s<br/>
&gt; response:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To the Editor:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In your recent feature article, &quot;A Powerful Lobbying Force,&quot; you reported<br/>
&gt; that the National Home Education Network does not take a stand on issues.<br/>
&gt; Our National Network does take a stand on one issue only, and that is to<br/>
&gt; support the freedom of families to choose home education, and to direct such<br/>
&gt; education.  We believe that homeschooling parents are intelligent enough to<br/>
&gt; make up their own minds on political issues, and we would not presume to<br/>
&gt; speak for them.  Homeschoolers are quite capable of speaking for themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While the Home School Legal Defense Association has put together a political<br/>
&gt; constituency, with its 60,000 members it still only represents a small<br/>
&gt; fraction of the  estimated 1.5 million homeschoolers. Based on the issues on<br/>
&gt; which HSLDA has chosen to focus, it is more accurate to describe the<br/>
&gt; association&#39;s political agenda in conservative Christian advocacy terms than<br/>
&gt; in homeschooling terms.  Because regulation of education in general, and<br/>
&gt; homeschooling in particular, is a state issue, homeschoolers lobbying at the<br/>
&gt; federal level are by definition addressing issues unrelated, or only<br/>
&gt; marginally related, to homeschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You noted that as a nonprofit organization, HSLDA cannot endorse candidates<br/>
&gt; without jeopardizing its tax-exempt status.  Political lobbying is another<br/>
&gt; legal tightrope for nonprofits, yet HSLDA openly recruits, trains and has<br/>
&gt; established an approval process for its lobbyists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The overall homeschooling population is tremendously diverse.  It makes no<br/>
&gt; more sense to expect all homeschoolers to agree on politics than it would to<br/>
&gt; expect all journalists to think alike.  But it would be a grave mistake to<br/>
&gt; dismiss the rest of the homeschooling community&#39;s political strength simply<br/>
&gt; because they do not play follow-the-leader.  Indeed, when HSLDA filed suit to<br/>
&gt; overturn the Gun Free School Zones Act, homeschoolers in Texas and across the<br/>
&gt; country, concerned that HSLDA was jeopardizing homeschool freedoms to further<br/>
&gt; its own political agenda, mounted such a swift and powerful campaign in<br/>
&gt; opposition that HSLDA was forced to withdraw its suit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschoolers as a group may well be better informed and more politically<br/>
&gt; active than the average American, but as the movement grows, those watching<br/>
&gt; would be wise to recognize its diversity.  It is misleading and dangerous to<br/>
&gt; perpetuate the misconception that any segment of the homeschooling community,<br/>
&gt; no matter how well organized, well funded, or vocal, speaks for all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; Laura Derrick<br/>
&gt; Public Relations Director<br/>
