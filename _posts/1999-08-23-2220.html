<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877825764">Dear Editor-<br/>
<br/>
I have just received an e-mail on the comic that you chose to print on a<br/>
day of homeschooling.  I can tell you that your interpretation of<br/>
homeschooling is wrong !!  I hope that you have a homeschooling support<br/>
group in your area that you can visit and families that you can talk to<br/>
so that you can see that extremely few homeschoolers are like that.  My<br/>
daughter at the age of 6yo. knows plenty of the &quot;world&quot; outside of our<br/>
home.  She has a childhood, more than a child who spends 8 hours away<br/>
from their family and stuck in a classroom, behind a desk, with a teacher<br/>
that can not give individual attention to each child because she has so<br/>
many to teach and she is only one person.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have a support group in your area, I would love to be your<br/>
guinea pig- study our family, see for yourself, and learn more of<br/>
homeschoolers before painting such a ugly picture of how you interpret<br/>
what homeschoolers are like.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
