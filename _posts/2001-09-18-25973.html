<div id="ygrps-yiv-417702616">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a hard time today.  Zak is watching the Magic School Bus (the <br/>
dinosaur one) for the 3rd time.  He&#39;s also been doing The Land Before Time <br/>
Math on his computer for a while.  I&#39;ve offered to do other things with him.  <br/>
But no he only wants to do what he wants to do.  He did let me play a game of <br/>
Dinosaur Monopoly when my 2 year old was asleep... So what&#39;s the problem you <br/>
are asking? <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s me... I feel like he ought to be doing more or I ought to be &quot;making&quot; <br/>
him do more by offering him more things.  He went to the park this morning <br/>
for an hour with his dad and brother, then the grocery store and since then <br/>
we&#39;ve been home.  It&#39;s about 96 and hummid outside and he just wants to watch <br/>
The Magic School Bus....<br/>
<br/>
So help me let go of this need to want to take control and also the thoughts <br/>
that he ought to be &quot;doing&quot; more.<br/>
<br/>
He also did some math this morning with DH.  He thinks it&#39;s puzzles and he <br/>
did that for about 20 mins.<br/>
<br/>
So some emotional support and support that this is normal and I&#39;ll get used <br/>
to this and the guilt will go away....<br/>
