Than again, it could simply be the respect and responsibility afforded the Murias children.  They are given a great deal of freedom and autonomy, while still expected to perform vital and important functions within the cultural structure.  They have an important place in their community.  Perhaps this helps to give them a greater feeling of their roles within the community, and sense of being personally responsible for upholding community values, which in turn produces adults with these same qualities.<br/>
