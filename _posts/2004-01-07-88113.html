<div id="ygrps-yiv-694098083">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lari and I have an 11 year old son, John.  I remember when I was pregnant I started reading about homeschooling and TCS.  I knew at the time that I was going to be a single parent - John&#39;s father has had no contact with us since about a year after John was born.  Being whelmed with the idea of handling this alone, I put the idea of homeschooling to the back of my mind and just carried on.<br/>
<br/>
All through the time he was in public school I mentally fought with myself and often raged at what was going on.  And, just as I would be about to pull him out, something would change and it would seem that leaving him in would be best.<br/>
<br/>
Just before Christmas 2002 I&#39;d simply had it.  His major Christmas present that year was my promise that he&#39;d never see a public school again unless he *really* chose it for himself.  I had joined this list before that and had already decided that unschooling would be the way to go for us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been an... interesting... year... For the first few months we had the nanny he had always had with him during the day (I work full-time)... but, she had some VERY strong objections to the changes and quit last May.  I have tried to find someone to be with him - but, for a variety of reasons, it just hasn&#39;t worked out.  He&#39;s been on his own at home during the day for the last couple months. (keep in mind, we talk over a dozen times a day).<br/>
<br/>
The deschooling has been difficult for me mostly.  I was brought up believing that a good life was out of the question unless one did well in college.  I keep having nagging fears in the back of my mind that I&#39;m ruining his life.  Still, I truly believe that I&#39;m basically doing the right things.  I know how little of the forced education I received has stuck with me.  I know that he&#39;s learning and growing by leaps and bounds every day.  He&#39;s an excellent reader - although he&#39;ll only read video game guides at the moment.  But, then, how many of us read something we&#39;re not interested in to begin with?<br/>
<br/>
Still - I come to this group day in and day out and want to thank you all for the incredible support you&#39;ve given me - without even knowing it.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
<br/>
