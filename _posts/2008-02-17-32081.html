&gt; Subject: A New Froebelian  Revolution<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Early last century there was a &quot;Froebel Revolution.&quot; It was picked up <br/>
&gt; by Dewey and later Buckminster Fuller.<br/>
&gt; Froebel not only invented the idea and the word &quot;Kindergarten,&quot; but <br/>
&gt; also promoted the idea that we learn best when we play.  He used <br/>
&gt; blocks, cards, and other devices designed so anyone learned as they <br/>
&gt; played.   Today everyone seems to be playing computer games.  It seems <br/>
&gt; only natural the one learns while playing.  It seems only sensible <br/>
&gt; that we design computer games from which the player learns. There is a <br/>
&gt; lot on the internet on this topic.  But I can&#39;t find a directory  or <br/>
&gt; other listing that rates games by their learning excellence.  I would <br/>
&gt; like to mention a couple of the best computer games for learning in my <br/>
&gt; book &quot;A Gaian Paradgm.&quot;  May I ask members of this list to send me <br/>
&gt; their nominations for all 5 star learning computer games, that you <br/>
&gt; have used or are familiar with,  rated by excellence for learning and <br/>
&gt; by age group (preschools through college to senior citizens ). .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for you help.<br/>
