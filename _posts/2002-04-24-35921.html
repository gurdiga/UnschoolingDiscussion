&lt;&lt; .  And I&#39;ve read lots of your posts and <br/>
 they have come across as you saying that if you truly respect your <br/>
 kids you MUST be unschooling.  That&#39;s why I ASKED if that was what you <br/>
 really meant. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never said anything of the kind. <br/>
Must be reading my posts with &quot;colored&quot; lenses.<br/>
<br/>
I have however, mentioned that my posts will continue to point to unschooling <br/>
AND to respecting children....they are often intertwined.<br/>
If I thought that children should be told what to do and have no choice in <br/>
their own lives, I wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.<br/>
There are friends of mine that are very respectful of their children and <br/>
their children are in school. However, if that child decides they hate school <br/>
and the parent refuses to do anything about that, it would be disrespectful <br/>
of that child.<br/>
Other friends of mine homeschool and are very disrespectful of their children.<br/>
Respect for children is not very high on the priority list of this society in <br/>
general.<br/>
Most of the people that first begin the unschooling journey or are seeking <br/>
thoughts in line with unschooling, are often doing things that are <br/>
disrespectful to children....without even being aware.<br/>
I&#39;m glad that people made me aware of the ways I do/don&#39;t give my children <br/>
equal respect.<br/>
I have and will continue to point that out in my posts, regardless of whether <br/>
or not certain people like it.<br/>
My goal in sharing information is to help people see the many choices <br/>
available to them that they never previously considered.<br/>
How you take my posts isn&#39;t what I&#39;m worried about right now.<br/>
