<div id="ygrps-yiv-121011551">I subscribed to a pagan homeschoolers online newsletter several months <br/>
ago-had to unsub due to tooooooo many emails...(barely can keep up with what <br/>
lists i&#39;m on now...)<br/>
I&#39;ll try to find the info and post it asap....(please bear with me, it may <br/>
take a week or so--we just moved and are not connected online with our <br/>
computer (using a friends today)....and i&#39;m going thru email withdrawal....)<br/>

Yes, I&#39;m interested in Pagan holidays.  I found Nanci K. in Idaho&#39;s post<br/>
about Samain, etc. fascinating.</div>
