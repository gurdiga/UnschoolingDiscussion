girl we&#39;ve known well has begun reading fluently (i.e., pretty much<br/>
anything they can put their hands on)I&#39;d like to hear others&#39; experiences.<br/>

Guess my girls are more like boys?..My oldest dd learned to read in<br/>
school..during first grade..very traditional.  But my middle dd..totally<br/>
homeschooled and left to her own timing.. didn&#39;t read fluently until age 9<br/>
or almost 10.. now she is 12 and reads as well as I do. My youngest dd is<br/>
7yrs and has no interest in reading yet...not even in being read to..she is<br/>
way too busy with artwork, animals and outside stuff.<br/>
