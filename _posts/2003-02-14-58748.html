<div id="ygrps-yiv-155458661">----- snip-----&gt; I&#39;m spending most of my energy and time with him now.  Yes,<br/>
I pulled the plug and cut him off.  I did the regulating.  I&#39;ve struggled<br/>
many times with whether that was the right decision, although it wasn&#39;t made<br/>
lightly.  But we&#39;re doing a lot more things together.  I have a lot less<br/>
personal time, a lot less time when he plays alone, and I feel it.  It&#39;s<br/>
tiring, emotionally for me.  But it&#39;s helping, and that&#39;s been<br/>
wonderful.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You feel that what you did worked.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that pulling the<br/>
plug was the ONLY possible solution.  What if you had asked him if you could<br/>
watch him play or play with him or ask him to explain the game to you?<br/>
(maybe you have, I don&#39;t know)<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list a few years ago but have often been no mail because I<br/>
couldn&#39;t keep up.  (guess I was self-regulating, huh?).  I came back<br/>
recently because I felt a need for more support and information on<br/>
unschooling.  I thought I&#39;d been giving my children freedom in TV and food,<br/>
but reading here helped me to realize I wasn&#39;t, truly.  As a result of<br/>
reading these posts, I&#39;ve been watching more TV with my kids.  I personally<br/>
don&#39;t watch much TV on my own, because I would rather be doing other things.<br/>
My husband watches TV every evening, and he loves to have any available<br/>
family members cuddling on the couch with him while he&#39;s watching.  It does<br/>
make me uncomfortable to see my kids watching so much TV be I had bought<br/>
into reports on TV viewing that are based on kids who spend a lot of time in<br/>
school.  But over and over, I hear people on this list say that children<br/>
with NO limits WILL self regulate.  They don&#39;t say children with no limits<br/>
until the parent can&#39;t stand it anymore and must set limits for the child&#39;s<br/>
benefit.  They don&#39;t say that children will self regulate within 24 hours.<br/>
They say that eventually, children with NO limits WILL self regulate.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I could continue to set MY limits on the kids watching TV, or I<br/>
could join them, while also continuing to offer other opportunities for<br/>
things to do.  Joining them has enabled me to discuss what they are viewing<br/>
with them.  So, I am spending more time with the kids doing what they want<br/>
to be doing at the moment, sharing THEIR interest of the moment with them.<br/>
And it does impact my &quot;personal time&quot;, but if spending time with my kids is<br/>
one of my priorities, then what we are doing together should not be as<br/>
important as the fact that we are together.<br/>
<br/>
Last night, 7yod was unhappy because she couldn&#39;t find anything she wanted<br/>
to watch on TV.  I could have decided for her that it was time to turn it<br/>
off.  Instead I spent time with her.  I helped her look through the channel<br/>
guide.  I mentioned that she could do something else instead, but (I hope)<br/>
in a way that made that ONE of her options.  I asked her questions about<br/>
what type of show she wanted to watch - cartoon, animal, real people, etc.<br/>
Then, when she did settle on something to watch, I stayed in the room and<br/>
folded laundry while watching with her.<br/>
<br/>
So far today, my kids have made valentine&#39;s for each other and mom and dad.<br/>
This was not my idea or suggestion.   They had bought valentine gifts for<br/>
each other with their own money, neither one knowing that the other was<br/>
doing the same thing.  Again, this was not my idea or suggestion.  They took<br/>
a shower together and both washed their hair.  (OK, the hair washing was my<br/>
suggestion, but they could have said no and that would&#39;ve been OK too.  I<br/>
reminded them how good they had got at washing their own hair in the shower<br/>
in Mexico.)  The TV was on for a few minutes, but it is off now.  They<br/>
didn&#39;t even watch a complete show.  Now they are playing with wooden dolls<br/>
that have separate heads and bodies.  Jackie got her set out first.  Lisa<br/>
wanted to play, but Jackie would only let her use the sad faces.  They were<br/>
starting to get mad at each other, so I stepped in.  I said I heard that<br/>
Lisa didn&#39;t want to play unless she could have a happy face, and that it was<br/>
OK for Jackie to choose not to give her a happy face, but it would mean that<br/>
Jackie would have to accept playing by herself.  (Those weren&#39;t my exact<br/>
words, but that&#39;s the jist).  I also reminded them that Lisa also has her<br/>
own set of the dolls that are a bit different.  They got excited and decided<br/>
to play with both sets, sharing and mix-matching the pieces.  Things could<br/>
have ended differently, but this time, it worked that I stopped what I was<br/>
doing to be with them and help them work something out (techniques well<br/>
described in How to Talk So Kids Will Listen).<br/>
<br/>
My heart is also lighter about my household chores since reading some<br/>
thoughtful posts here.  Why will my kids want to do chores if I&#39;m grumbling<br/>
about them?  I have a certain standard of how I want my house to look.  So<br/>
I&#39;m working on that, without making it their problem.  And they are doing<br/>
some tasks without me asking them to.  Thanks again to the women on the list<br/>
who are taking the time to repeat and repeat.  I am not yet where I want to<br/>
be, but I am where I am, and it&#39;s really good most of the time!<br/>
