<div id="ygrps-yiv-479521037">Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get my 3 and 4 year olds on an <br/>
airplane?  I&#39;m not sure why they are afraid except that they think it will be <br/>
really loud.  My son, in particular, is very sensitive to loud noises - he <br/>
even begs people in public bathrooms not to use the hand dryer.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>
about the noise level on the plane, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably just the fear of the unknown.  For the oldest, he may have some <br/>
September 11th memories because it took me about 10 minutes to realize he was <br/>
actually watching the TV news coverage immediately after the attacks.  But he <br/>
hasn&#39;t brought that up.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to force them to do something they are afraid of.  But we have <br/>
an opportunity to use a friend&#39;s United miles and I&#39;d rather not pass that <br/>
up!  It&#39;s not like we can visit an airport to watch the planes take off and <br/>
land, either.  I thought we could look for some books and videos at the <br/>
library...  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I remember the days when the flight attendants would push a cart around that <br/>
had a steam tray built in it. They passed out warm (actually hot) washcloths. <br/>
What a wonderful thing that was! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In any case, talk to the kids about the noise. It is loud at take off, don&#39;t <br/>
say things like, its only a little loud, tell them it is loud. Explain how it <br/>
feels when the plane takes off, how it feels to be laying back for a few <br/>
minutes, that feeling in your stomach when the plane levels off, and when the <br/>
plane lands.<br/>
<br/>
We traveled tons when I was a kid. I have been in little nuts-and-bolts <br/>
planes, planes that weren&#39;t fit to fly 5 feet in, planes that were long and <br/>
sleek and beautiful where you didn&#39;t hear a sound or feel a thing. I flew in <br/>
a plane that lost 3 of its 4 engines, and a UPS plane once took me across the <br/>
Pacific. There are a few things I ALWAYS take with me. Ear plugs; to help <br/>
with the noise, Chewing gum; to help my ears pop, A hot washcloth in a <br/>
thermos; for after the plane has leveled off. (I boil water, put the <br/>
washcloth in, wring it out, microwave the washcloth and then drop it into a <br/>
thermos. This keeps it hot for a few hours. I also put boiling water in the <br/>
thermos to heat it up, and dump the water out before I put the washcloth in.) <br/>
I flew on September 30, last year and was allowed to take my thermos on the <br/>
plane. You might want to check. I also take books, paper and crayons. Even in <br/>
the most economical planes there are usually trays that pull down from the <br/>
seats. <br/>
<br/>
Talk to the kids about the noise, and the feelings they will experience. Talk <br/>
to them about popping their ears, and chewing gum. Talk to them about their <br/>
fears. Take them to the park and swing them. (its not quite the same, but <br/>
close) Get some ear plugs and show them how to wear them. Call the airline <br/>
and ask if they still hand out those wing pins. Ask if the kids could <br/>
possibly meet the captain. Even if it is before take off, out of the plane. <br/>
Ask if you can board first so the kids can see the plane without tons of <br/>
people milling around the aisles. <br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684669">Dramamine (they have orange chewable now, and liquid, I think) and headphones <br/>
with happy music.  Fancy water bottle of their own.  (Don&#39;t wait for the <br/>
drink service.)  Gum to chew so they don&#39;t get the ear-discomfort as easily.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you not close to an airport? We went on a field trip with a homeschool <br/>
group to the airport and got to walk onto the planes and see the cockpit and <br/>
sit in the seats for a while. My 6 year old has never been on a flight, so <br/>
this was pretty cool for him.<br/>
I&#39;m sure if you were to call out to a nearby airport they would allow him to <br/>
take a tour---especially after the attacks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as I know, unless you have a ticket, you cannot get up to the waiting <br/>
area&#39;s in airports anymore. So in most airports it is impossible to get the <br/>
good view of planes landing and taking off like you get at the boarding <br/>
waiting area. Maybe if she lives near a small airport that would be <br/>
different. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a great idea!  I had thought they wouldn&#39;t let us after the attacks, <br/>
because security is tight.  We are 1/2 an hour away from Chicago O&#39;Hare of <br/>
Midway.<br/>
<br/>
And the suggestions about what to bring, etc are great too.  Thanks!  I&#39;ve <br/>
never given my two chewing gum before, is it safe for a 3 and 4 year old?  I <br/>
was thinking about the drinks, definately and headphones.  But probably <br/>
pullups because they hate public bathrooms and I&#39;m very claustrophobic (can&#39;t <br/>
even get my own car washed, much less squeeze the three of us in a teeny tiny <br/>
toilet).<br/>
