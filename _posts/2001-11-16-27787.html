<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749826130">I have three kids and when we had two rooms for them, they chose who was<br/>
where.  They moved around occassionally.  I used to get lots of comments<br/>
from well meaning strangers that I should put the girls in a room<br/>
together and my son by himself.  Problem was my oldest really needed her<br/>
own space some of the time.  I just let them work it out and they did.  <br/>
However, I must admit it is great to be in a bigger house where everyone<br/>
has space.  <br/>
<br/>
We all have space intensive hobbies and keeping Rachel&#39;s music and<br/>
Jenni&#39;s books and puzzles and Wyndham&#39;s trains sorted out is great.  (Not<br/>
that they  don&#39;t share, just that they can find it all now!)  Of course<br/>
then there are Ron&#39;s radios and my craft stuff (which gets &#39;borrowed&#39;<br/>
more than anything else in the house!  All in all, we have managed to<br/>
fill this four 1/2 bedroom house with full walk-out basement in no time<br/>
flat!  We moved from a house half this size and when we had about half<br/>
the stuff moved one of our friends can over and said, &quot;Wow, you must be<br/>
about done.&quot;  He was astounded when we told him how much more there was<br/>
to move.  I personally think it doubled in size while being transported.<br/>

while being transported.  Also furniture adds one to<br/>
three inches in either width or depth, blue modifies<br/>
to green and brown becomes purple. <br/>
<br/>
A feature of new homes is that helpful things like<br/>
light swtches seem to move around on their own.<br/>
Cupboard conntents switch with the closets and<br/>
commmodes only stay exactly where they were if you<br/>
turn on the light.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434996314">We have not required that the kids maintain their bedrooms to any kind of standard. <br/>
Consequently, we have a variety of bedroom conditions. There are two kids who love to <br/>
keep things neat, but the rest don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (almost 17) has such a messy room that you can&#39;t cross the floor without <br/>
walking all over things (guitar, music, CDs, books. clthes, shoes, sports gear...). My <br/>
husband wants to clean it for him once (said he isn&#39;t out to shame our son or anything, <br/>
but just wants to get in there and vacuum, change the sheets, dust, wash the windows, <br/>
etc.). He wouldn&#39;t put things away, just move them to a big box or two while he cleans up.<br/>
<br/>
My son is resistant to this idea. He doesn&#39;t want anyone in his room.<br/>
<br/>
My husband feels that he should be free to clean it up once every six months or so since <br/>
the conditon of the house matters to him.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for how to handle this?<br/>

Julie, <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would help to have a discussion, either on paper or in <br/>
person, about how to meet everyone&#39;s needs.  Your husband (and <br/>
assumingly your own) needs are that your son&#39;s room is reasonably <br/>
clean.  I think changing the sheets and vaccuming twice a year isn&#39;t <br/>
an unreasnable standard of cleanliness.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Your son needs his space, and to know that it&#39;s HIS.  <br/>
<br/>
After discussing it, it is likely (though not absolute) that you can <br/>
come up with a solution that meets everyone&#39;s needs -- either he <br/>
does the basic housekeeping your husband wants to do, or takes time <br/>
to box up personal items before someone else does the housekeeping, <br/>
or you do it together, etc.  But if you approach it as &quot;We have a <br/>
problem.  Here are my needs, here are yours, how can we compromise?&quot; <br/>
looking for a true compromise you likely will find one.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060013851">Okay, I have an inquiry, and I know I&#39;m opening myself up here, but I <br/>
have to ask.  Since I&#39;ve begun my unschooling journey, the one thing <br/>
that I have the biggest block with is the whole not requiring <br/>
anything out of the children in the home.  Maybe part of it is that <br/>
I&#39;ve not come across that in a book, yet.  I&#39;ve been doing a ton of <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
We are a family of nine, seven children.  Two just graduated, two <br/>
graduate next year, two are in charter public school and one his at <br/>
home.  He&#39;s the youngest at 10 years.  Due to the dynamics of our <br/>
family, we may never reach this level of unschooling, since I&#39;m <br/>
technically only unschooling one child.  Not to say that my knowledge <br/>
and practice of unschooling has no effect on the rest of the family.  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen that it does.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t understand is how it&#39;s wrong to require things from our <br/>
children especially when it&#39;s OUR house.  One of Pat&#39;s biggest <br/>
frustrations with our children is their lack of regard for our home.  <br/>
When we don&#39;t require them to care for things, they get ruined.  As <br/>
he puts it, they will eventually move on, but we still have to live <br/>
here.  It makes me ill when I think that our upstairs is only 5 years <br/>
old, and it looks at least 10 years old.  Why is it wrong to expect <br/>
your children to care for your things?  As their parent I don&#39;t <br/>
mistreat their possessions.  At last check our homes are probably our <br/>
biggest financial investment.  Who wants that neglected?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603392564">Tina, I have to ask...what things of yours do they get to ruin? I&#39;m <br/>
guessing furniture?<br/>
<br/>
If that is one of the things then they need to go pick out some <br/>
thrift store stuff they like and you may need to put yours away. When <br/>
my son redecorated his room and bathroom, he started being pickier <br/>
about keeping it nice. He hates for anyone to sleep in his bed now<br/>
(but he still doesn&#39;t make it!:P)<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I&#39;ve really asked of them is not to hurt my stuff but <br/>
if my stuff is something they must use then I know it&#39;s going to get <br/>
worn. Discussions of why you like your things a certain way and what <br/>
they might like to buy or make for themselves may be in order. Sara <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So where exactly is THEIR house?  And *require* sound awfully brute, <br/>
disrespectful and controlling.  It may just be the typewritten <br/>
words, but if they come out at home sounding that way, you might <br/>
have the answer to your own question.<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re old enough to move out, they&#39;ll probably understand and <br/>
come back and help you paint and recarpet if you ask nicely.  If <br/>
while they are boarding, they feel like it isn&#39;t their house, too, <br/>
then maybe they don&#39;t give a crap what the carpet and walls look <br/>
like or how well the house looks.  I mean, it isn&#39;t THEIR house <br/>
after all.  People tend to learn about respecting other peoples <br/>
things by learning how to care for their own.  (WHY didn&#39;t I apply <br/>
this to my wallpaper???)<br/>
<br/>
I have seven children, too.  All mine are home (the oldest 13, the <br/>
rest under 8) and I&#39;m not enough to keep up after everyone&#39;s <br/>
messes.  They are pretty good about cleaning up after themselves.  <br/>
If not, it doesn&#39;t take much more than a nice request.  We make a <br/>
game out of it, set the timer and everyone picks up for 15 minutes.  <br/>
Sometimes, we do it a lot during the day, sometimes we only do it <br/>
once.  Sometimes, I forget about it and the house gets crazy-madman-<br/>
messy and I get mad and have to remind myself that if I can leave <br/>
the dishes on the counter for two days, surely they will make  <br/>
bigger messes and forget to clean them up because they are a LOT <br/>
younger than I am.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning as I make mistakes.  Go back and read the wallpaper <br/>
thread.  You&#39;ll learn a lot, too! The same advice applies.  :)<br/>

Just ask the questions without an antagonism alert.  It&#39;s less antagonistic!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Since I&#39;ve begun my unschooling journey, the one thing <br/>

that I have the biggest block with is the whole not requiring <br/>
<br/>
anything out of the children in the home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;the whole&quot;?  <br/>
Recommendations are made and stories are told and you don&#39;t have to <br/>
incorporate any of it whatsoever.  Take what you need and leave the rest.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe part of it is that I&#39;ve not come across that in a book, yet.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been doing a ton of reading.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it were in a book, you&#39;d believe it more? <br/>
Self-publication is going to make that a problematical philosophy to live by.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a ton of reading, and it&#39;s not in a book.  It&#39;s peppered throughout <br/>
unschooling.com over the past few years, and some of the good parts are <br/>
collected here:<br/>

family, we may never reach this level of unschooling, since I&#39;m <br/>
<br/>
technically only unschooling one child. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has to change anything in their lives because of what they read here.  <br/>
Some like to.  Some do so against their conscious will. &lt;bwg&gt;  If you can&#39;t <br/>
or don&#39;t want to, don&#39;t!<br/>
It&#39;s not a part of unschooling.  It&#39;s not a prerequisite of unschooling.  <br/>
It&#39;s a part of a larger way of related thinking.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I don&#39;t understand is how it&#39;s wrong to require things from our <br/>
<br/>
children especially when it&#39;s OUR house. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people like to think it&#39;s the kids&#39; house too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One of Pat&#39;s biggest <br/>
<br/>
frustrations with our children is their lack of regard for our home.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you consider it your home (and they are visitors, or inferior beings who <br/>
are temporarily there) then of course your priorities and principles will be <br/>
different, and that&#39;s the way priorities go.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;When we don&#39;t require them to care for things, they get ruined. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The things, or the kids?<br/>
<br/>
And by &quot;require them to care for things,&quot; do you mean require them to polish <br/>
wooden tables weekly, or dissuade them from carving their names in them?  <br/>
There&#39;s a great range of &quot;to care for&quot; and another great range of &quot;require.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s your house, why don&#39;t you care for all the things yourself?  Part of <br/>
that might be having guidelines about who can use what how.  No jumping on the <br/>
couch.  No Playdoh on the carpet.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;As he puts it, they will eventually move on, but we still have to live <br/>
<br/>
here. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or you might die and they&#39;ll have spent those years taking care of a house <br/>
you weren&#39;t going to live in after they were gone after all.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a facetious answer, but even facetious answers could have photos in <br/>
the book next to them.  Not all parents outlive the childhoods of their <br/>
offspring.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It makes me ill when I think that our upstairs is only 5 years <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
What does that have to do with unschooling, then, since most of your children <br/>
are in school?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Why is it wrong to expect <br/>
<br/>
your children to care for your things?  As their parent I don&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
mistreat their possessions. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That would be the thing I would recommend.  Take good care of their things, <br/>
tell them why you are, and theoretically, ideally, they will want to take care <br/>
of YOUR things.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what caused the dynamics in your home to be what they are, but <br/>
by your own description, it&#39;s not an unschooling matter.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t destructive of property.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a wooden box her dad made her for her medieval clothes (for SCA).  <br/>
It&#39;s about three feet long, and can be used as a seat or a table.  She got <br/>
nail polish remover on it and it marred the finish.  She felt AWFUL.  And it was <br/>
hers.  And her dad can fix it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At last check our homes are probably our <br/>
<br/>
biggest financial investment.  Who wants that neglected?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Our children are our biggest responsibility and &quot;investment.&quot;<br/>
We have a house so our children have a place to live, and we were happy to <br/>
have this particular house (which we bought six years or so ago) because it&#39;s a <br/>
great house for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If a house is bought as an investment, maybe that&#39;s a better activity for <br/>
childless couples.   We had neighbors for a while whose mutual hobby was buying <br/>
houses, fixing them up themselves and selling them for more.  After just a few <br/>
houses, their houses were not &quot;costing them&quot; anything--they got ahead of the <br/>
game.  But they were doing it for fun, and as a shared activity.  They would <br/>
decide &quot;this bathroom needs wooden fixtures,&quot; and would go to fleamarkets and <br/>
garage sales.<br/>
<br/>
Expecting one&#39;s children to be partners in a home-improvement or even <br/>
investment-maintenance scheme seems unreasonable.  And especially if you consider it <br/>
YOUR house, not theirs.<br/>

since we are renting and sharing a room, and he no longer writes on <br/>

Do you have a specific concern that you&#39;d like help with? Maybe a <br/>

Funny story then, not so funny now.  Pre-unschooling, when my middle <br/>

comforters so it was just a matter of pulling it up and smoothing out <br/>
the wrinkles, but he even hated doing that.  So he would sleep on top <br/>
of the comforter so he wouldn&#39;t have to make it.  That was a long, <br/>

list is for us to talk and analyze and evaluate and critique what it is <br/>
like for us to live an unschooling life. We&#39;re unschoolers - we&#39;re <br/>
talking &quot;about&quot; unschooling lifestyles. We hope that by doing this <br/>
we&#39;ll help each other delve ever deeper.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about housework, family finances, food issues, materialism, TV <br/>
and video games, and movies and sports and on and on - ALL in the <br/>
context of living life as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We are not saying you have to have unlimited TV or no bedtimes or <br/>
include the kids in making financial decisions or any of those things <br/>
in order to unschool. Unschooling means not doing school in the home - <br/>
not having lesson plans, teacher-moments, assignments, grades, tests. <br/>
It means trusting kids to learn what they need to learn in their own <br/>
way and with the help of loving attentive involved supportive parents <br/>
who provide an environment conducive to natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
But there are often &quot;repercussions&quot; to living an unschooling life -- <br/>
there are &quot;side effects&quot; of trusting our children and living in freedom <br/>

Some folks are mixing up control issues with schooling practises I <br/>
think. I guess having to parent and advocate a freer learning style <br/>
can be hard for many to integrate or instigate in their daily lives. <br/>
I think you are very clear and if you repost the above statement <br/>
every few days, you&#39;d do us all a favor...<br/>
<br/>
So...how many of us started out letting our children grow and explore <br/>
without much restriction and encouraging independence? With the <br/>
exception of safety issues and respect for others sanity, I let my <br/>
kids do anything they could tackle, physically and mentally. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra mentioned not trying to change adults when it comes to teens <br/>
questioning other adults....to coach the teeen to better deal with <br/>
those he wishes to discuss things with. Maybe some of the new <br/>
unschoolers need to be more open to coaching from this core group <br/>
instead of challenging them. Maybe the constant influx of new <br/>
unschoolers is increasing....I can see where those that maintain good <br/>
lists get tired of saying the same things over and over. I see the <br/>
use of links but I wonder if they are being read. People want answers <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The reason you&#39;re having problems understanding is that you&#39;re seeing two<br/>
choices: make them or be the maid.<br/>
<br/>
What it sounds like you did is that you made them pick up when they were<br/>
younger (I assume since you say you don&#39;t get the idea) and then left them<br/>
to their own devices with the expectation that they&#39;d care for things to<br/>
your standards. The first obviously didn&#39;t turn them into people who care<br/>
for things on their own. And the second isn&#39;t being advocated.<br/>
<br/>
Another choice is to accept ownership of the household tasks and then<br/>
sincerely ask for help (which means no is an acceptable answer) and<br/>
sincerely thank people when they have helped (even if it isn&#39;t up to the<br/>
standards you would have done it or standards you think they&#39;re capable of).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just basic human nature that it&#39;s more rewarding to help someone who is<br/>
working hard at what they&#39;re doing and is appreciative of help than someone<br/>
who is spreading their work around and angry that no one is helping in the<br/>
way she wants the work to be done.<br/>

Really?  How would it get in? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Air.<br/>
Most wind carries dust and sand.  It the house is totally closed up, you&#39;ll <br/>
suffocate.  The way most houses are cooled is evaporative coolers, and even <br/>
that comes in with some &quot;airborne particulates,&quot; because although there are wet <br/>
pads, they&#39;re sufficiently open that &quot;live air&quot; is coming in.  And every person <br/>
or dog who comes in from the inside is likely to bring some dust/sand on <br/>
shoes and clothes, in hair...<br/>
<br/>
We just get used to it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people live in wetter neighborhoods (farmland by the river).   Then they <br/>
have mud and (different) stickers and mosquitos.   Uphill, we have sand and <br/>
no mosquitos.  People high enough for big pine forests and ferns on the ground <br/>
don&#39;t have stickers or mosquitos.  They might have bears and mountain lions <br/>
they didn&#39;t particularly want.  But they won&#39;t get in the bed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A  homeschooling family moved here lately from southern California and bought <br/>
a house.  The mom is mystified by the local need for this or that, didn&#39;t get <br/>
the swamp cooler, has a septic tank, lives where she can irrigate.   Very <br/>
foreign for her.  It&#39;s always fun to discuss such things, though, and for the <br/>
local kids to see how much they knew without knowing it would be exotic <br/>
information for anyone.<br/>

It&#39;s likely that people think unschooling is easier than it is, that it&#39;s ten <br/>
simple rules to follow:  no more messy thinking required.<br/>
<br/>
Yet this list has ten simple rules which are mailed to new members, and the <br/>

new rules, even though there are two versions of them here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/info">http://sandradodd.com/lists/info</a><br/>
<br/>
AND they&#39;re available at a link/URL listed at the bottom of every single <br/>
e-mail from this group.   <br/>

the worse days.<br/>

whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Is this clear as mud? Although I&#39;m clear in my own head about what we<br/>
mean - it seems to be a little hard to get it across clearly.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m going to look at just a subset of what you said.  Something that I <br/>
think is an assumption that new-to-the-list people make that can lead to <br/>
confusion.  That is this list will not tell you the step-by-step, <br/>
optimum way to raise and educate your child.  Because top-down <br/>
instruction is not what this list is about.) <br/>
<br/>
We discuss all kinds of parenting issues on this list and have some <br/>
valuable experience to share.  We think we have some information about a <br/>
novel form learning, *unschooling*.  This information is not commonly <br/>
available.  We think there is some real MISinformation in our culture <br/>
about how people learn, and we want to point out that some of the <br/>
reasons for sending kids to school are not valid.  **But, the purpose of <br/>
this list is not to supercede the thinking process and the awareness of <br/>
the parent.**  The purpose of this list is to **stimulate** each <br/>
parent&#39;s thinking and awareness about parenting and learning in her <br/>
family life.<br/>
<br/>
The parent is the one living with and interacting with her children.  <br/>
She&#39;s the one who already knows them, and has the potential to increase <br/>
her knowledge of them every day.  This is valuable expertise, (even <br/>
though institutional experts like school and doctors have been known to <br/>
underestimate it&#39;s importance).  If a parent just followed the <br/>
suggestions of the list **without thinking about them** and <br/>
experimenting with them then an important part of the process of <br/>
interacting wiht her childen would be short-circuited.  And unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t want parents to throw away what they&#39;ve observed about their <br/>
children and what they know about them in their hearts.  That&#39;s reall <br/>
knowledge.  We just want them to question what they&#39;ve heard about <br/>
children in some of our culture&#39;s dubious folk wisdom.  &quot;Give them an <br/>
inch and they&#39;ll take a mile.&quot;  &quot;Don&#39;t pick up a crying baby, you&#39;ll <br/>
spoil it.&quot;  &quot;Kids who go to publicly funded preschool don&#39;t end up in <br/>
publicly funded prisons.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling absolutely needs to be responsive to the individuality of <br/>
the child.  That&#39;s crucial.  We don&#39;t want to be like public school and <br/>
exaggerate the similarities of all children to the point that we are <br/>
trying to pound square pegs into round holes.  Unschooling also needs to <br/>
be responsive to the circumstances of the family.  There&#39;s no reason to <br/>
find thirty other people and do what they are doing. &lt;g&gt;  I know that&#39;s <br/>
how most of us learned growing up, but public school is over for us <br/>
adults.  So, be free, and find ways to free your children.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a clearly marked path where what happens first is <br/>
followed predictably by the next step and the next step like the years <br/>
of public school K-12.  It doesn&#39;t start at 8:00am each weekday and stop <br/>
at 3.  It doesn&#39;t stop in June, July and August.  It isn&#39;t over when <br/>
your child is 18.  What you do first isn&#39;t pre-determined for you.  <br/>
**What you do next isn&#39;t dictated to you.**<br/>
<br/>
(Now I&#39;m going to say the same thing about 6 different ways.  If you <br/>
already get it and the repetition is bugging you, then skip some lines.  <br/>
I&#39;m just trying to find different ways to say what I&#39;m thinking that <br/>
will make sense to different people.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t laid out like a curriculum.  It doesn&#39;t limit itself <br/>
to 6 or 7 subjects.  It doesn&#39;t even guarantee coverage of those <br/>
specific subjects that high schools think are important.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is more like an experiment and less like a recipe.  What <br/>
your children will do everyday is not predictable and should not be <br/>
controlled.  (I mean don&#39;t treat them like marionettes.  I don&#39;t mean <br/>
let them run into traffic.)<br/>
<br/>
This list exists to help us question the way we used to do things.  But <br/>
it doesn&#39;t prescribe answers. <br/>
<br/>
The answers to question like --&quot;What do I do now?&quot; -- are not all in <br/>
*the book*.  There is no bible of unschooling.  There is no imposed <br/>
penalty for violating the unschooling laws.  There is no unschooling <br/>
Teacher&#39;s Manual with a table of contents and answers to tough questions <br/>
in the back.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t tell you how to unschool.   When &quot;typical&quot; days of unschoolers <br/>
are discussed is is not with the intention that someone copy them. <br/>
<br/>
I suppose this list does tell you what NOT to do, but you should only do <br/>
those things if you believe that they might work / will work / or will <br/>
do less harm than what you currently are doing.  <br/>
<br/>
This list is more like therapy, where you sit on a couch and discuss <br/>
stuff, than like boot camp where a bugle wakes you and someone orders <br/>
you around all day and sets your schedule for you.  (I wish I could say <br/>
there were no latrines to clean. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to make this list directly useful for a parent who <br/>
really wants to have a set plan to follow.  Because I think none of us <br/>
follows a set plan.  We follow the wishes of our children and the needs <br/>
of our life circumstances.  If we had a plan we&#39;d have to throw it out <br/>
after the first half hour or get out a big red pen and edit &quot;the plan&quot; <br/>
like crazy.  And I don&#39;t think metaphorical big red pens belong in <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

wouldn&#39;t either. We bought our house for our family and it&#39;s our <br/>
family&#39;s house. Just changing to thinking and speaking of it that way <br/>
might help a lot.<br/>

<br/>
Is there something specific?  With that many people in a home, wear <br/>
and tear is just going to happen. We had a family of four share our <br/>
home last month for several weeks and I was amazed at just how much <br/>
difference it made going from 4 to 8 people, just the amount of dirt <br/>
that gets tracked in, dishes that have to be done, etc. etc. You have <br/>
a lot of people living in your house and it will definitely show up <br/>
in wear over a family who has just two kids. Heck, even our dog makes <br/>
a signifigant difference. If they&#39;re doing something specific - <br/>
jumping on an antique couch that belonged to your great-grandmother <br/>
for instance, maybe find a good substitute. We have our king-sized <br/>
bed in the master bedroom just sitting on the ground, no bed frame. <br/>
That makes it an excellent jumping platform. Our couch, OTOH, is one <br/>
of those hideous futon things (never again) so it has no springs, <br/>
only a wood frame. If a kid (ours or someone else&#39;s) starts jumping <br/>
on it, we just redirect them to the bed. That way we don&#39;t have a kid <br/>
breaking their leg going through the wood slats of the couch, and we <br/>
have a bunch of happy kids bouncing on the bed. Another option would <br/>
be to buy a big trampoline or something. When I was growing up, it <br/>
was popular to have a &quot;rumpus room&quot; in the basement that was sparsely <br/>
furnished with ratty stuff and was basically just a kid hangout.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When we don&#39;t require them to care for things, they get ruined.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, obviously some things require good care. For instance, my kids <br/>
know not to pick up my violin without utmost care, or bang on the <br/>
piano keys hard enough to break them, or mess with the one piece of <br/>
antique furniture that&#39;s from my grandparents, etc. But most stuff <br/>
can be pretty indestructible, and if all the furniture is too fussy <br/>
or breakable, it might be time to put it up and buy some cheap <br/>
durable stuff for a few more years. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It makes me ill when I think that our upstairs is only 5 years <br/>
&gt; old, and it looks at least 10 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Making you ill is a pretty strong term. IMHO, you can&#39;t expect 7 kids <br/>
to live somewhere and leave it looking like another family&#39;s house <br/>
that has two kids - you&#39;ve got more than 3 times as many feet <br/>
crossing the carpet, brushing against walls, scraping cabinets, etc. <br/>
Also, it depends on what kinds of kids you have. Some are more rough-<br/>
and-tumble than others. Fortunately, when the kids move out, most of <br/>
the wear and tear can be fixed with sanding, painting, maybe some new <br/>
carpet. That&#39;s why apartments always charge you a deposit - they know <br/>
that this stuff is just necessary. Maybe you should start putting <br/>
aside a repainting and recarpeting deposit of your own. Would knowing <br/>
that you have money set aside to redo the stuff that gets worn help <br/>
you feel better about it?? Might be a good idea.<br/>

keeping up the home is your responsibility. You can do that <br/>
grudgingly and angrily about all that gets worn in the home, or you <br/>
can keep it up as best you can with all that you&#39;ve got going, and do <br/>
it cheerfully, knowing that you can redecorate when the kids are gone <br/>
(personally, I&#39;m planning on a different color of carpet entirely :-)<br/>
<br/>
Flylady (flylady.net) has a bunch of good suggestions on how to <br/>
develop efficient routines for housecare, as well as suggestions for <br/>
getting rid of what she calls &quot;stinkin&#39; thinkin&#39; &quot; which is <br/>
housecleaning martyrdom. Chances are, if you cheerfully go about <br/>
keeping things looking nice, and you ask the kids to pitch in when <br/>
needed, they will. We &quot;unchored&quot; a couple of years ago and the kids <br/>
are almost always willing to help out with something when I ask them <br/>
to. It&#39;s not always what I&#39;d want immediate help with (they&#39;re always <br/>
glad to wash one set of windows for instance, when maybe what I need <br/>
to do is unload the dishwasher) but they&#39;re definitely helpful! I try <br/>
to make housecare a game - I need to do this for my own sanity <br/>
because I&#39;m not a born housekeeper. So we use some of Flylady&#39;s <br/>
suggestions, like &quot;5 minute room rescues&quot;, &quot;27 Fling Boogies&quot; and <br/>
some of her other fun stuff, and it makes it way more enjoyable for <br/>
anyone involved. For instance, I hate folding laundry, so when I have <br/>
a pile in my bedroom to fold, I just fold 5 things any time I walk <br/>
into the bedroom. Sometimes I&#39;ll ask the kids to just put away 5 <br/>
things when they walk in. That way none of us feel like we have to <br/>
spend an hour folding or putting away clothes. It only takes 30 <br/>
seconds to do those five things, but by the end of the day our <br/>
laundry mountain is moved! You can take these types of things and <br/>
apply them to any housekeeping task and make it a lot more enjoyable <br/>
for you, which can end up meaning much more enjoyable for the kids to <br/>
be around or pitch in.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Think of this...what are you comparing it to?  The house you grew up in?  The <br/>
house of a friend (that only has 2 children)?<br/>
<br/>
Sooooooo much can happen in 5 years.  We&#39;ve only lived in our home for 5 <br/>
years, and the whole thing looks like it needs repainting.  5 years is a long time <br/>
with that many people living in the home (we have 10 people in our house, <br/>
plus 2 cats and a dog.)  We&#39;ve had holes in walls, paint pulled off with tape, <br/>
HUNDREDS of nail/tack holes, a gazillion scuff marks.  Not to mention the inside <br/>
of our home is half done.  We have huge holes ripped in the linoleum where we <br/>
moved a table that didn&#39;t have little plastic thingies on the bottom of the <br/>
legs.  The banister is so rickety on the stairs now, from kids swinging around <br/>
it, we&#39;ll probably be replacing it soon.  We&#39;ve replaced the guts of our <br/>
toilet (mechanical stuff) probably 5 times (a lot of flushing in a family of 10) <br/>
and we&#39;ve went through 2 used washers, 2 used dryers, and recently bit the <br/>
bullet and bought an expensive front loading model just so we could do larger loads!<br/>
<br/>
Not trying to minimize your frustration (OK, maybe I am) but don&#39;t feel so <br/>
bad!  It&#39;s normal.  Throw a few rugs down, go over stuff once in a while with a <br/>
bottle of 409, and spend more time with your family and reading good books.<br/>

Damage to the house is easier to repair than damage to the kids, if a parent <br/>
can only think of those two options.<br/>
<br/>
We have a hole in the wall where Kirby kicked it, when he was 13 or so.  A <br/>
friend&#39;s mother was dying of cancer, he knew.  He was out of town for a few <br/>
days, and a couple of weeks after he got back he found out she had died and he had <br/>
missed the funeral.  They hadn&#39;t called him specifically.  If he had been at <br/>
the gaming shop he would&#39;ve heard.  He really liked that lady.  Her name was <br/>
Zandra.  He liked her kids, and after she died they moved away.  He was <br/>
rightfully frustrated.  The hole can&#39;t be fixed easily, because there&#39;s a sliding <br/>
door behind it.  It&#39;s a memorial to Zandra, and it reminds the kids not to kick <br/>
the walls.<br/>
<br/>
-=- suggestions for <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s an AA term too.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I DID force-march my kids through the house making them mop and dust <br/>
and sort and polish, we wouldn&#39;t have a house that looks like a showhouse.  <br/>
It&#39;s not that kind of house.  We have STUFF.  COOL stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And what would happen is I would have a slightly cleaner house o&#39;stuff, and <br/>
my kids would be profoundly unhappy.  And I bet I&#39;d be unhappy too, because I <br/>
would have to decide they were lazy and uncooperative and wasting my time <br/>
making me march them around every day.<br/>
