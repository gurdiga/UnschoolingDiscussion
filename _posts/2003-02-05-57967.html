think he has a lot of deschooling to go.<br/>
He does enjoy reading at night before bed. He doesn&#39;t do much reading during <br/>
the day because I think there&#39;s to much else to do. At night when its quite <br/>
he&#39;ll read for quite a while. He loves Calvin & Hobbs!<br/>
His Dad is getting a little itchy about this time thinking he&#39;s not learning <br/>
anything. I do sometimes to but then I pull out a John Holt book and it <br/>
relaxes me.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping come summer we&#39;ll be able to get out more and investigate anything <br/>
and everything. That&#39;s what he enjoys most along with his brother Colt (2.5).<br/>

<br/>
But if the mom races ahead of the kid on deschooling, PS2 and the computer <br/>
will start to look like learning opportunities instead of the stalling time <br/>
before learning kicks in.<br/>
<br/>
Moms need to change THEIR views of what educational looks like.  If the mom <br/>
can&#39;t see what a kid can learn from computer games and from being on the <br/>
computer. unschooling isn&#39;t going to come easily to that family.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some things for the moms to read while waiting for the boys to <br/>
deschool:<br/>
