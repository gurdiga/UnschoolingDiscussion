&lt;&lt; The guy <br/>
<br/>
who plays &quot;Toad&quot; in American Graffiti is really good as Farley Mowat--<br/>
<br/>
looking for his name--Charles Martin Smith.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OOOh, and I was just thinking of American Graffiti, forgot to say, because at <br/>
unschooling.com there&#39;s a bit about drive-in theaters, and the only movie I <br/>
could definitely think of that has a drive-in theater scene is Peewee&#39;s Big <br/>
Adventure.  I considered American Graffiti, but haven&#39;t seen it for a long time <br/>
and only know for sure the drag race and the burger joint.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyone want to contribute names of movies that show drive-in theaters in them?<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at Costco we were looking at DVDs and I saw &quot;The World of Suzie <br/>
Wong.&quot;  Told my husband I had seen it at a drive-in when I was a kid had though I <br/>
remembered the red dress I had not a clue what it was about.<br/>
<br/>
But not movies we saw at drive-ins, movies kids can see now that show <br/>
drive-ins. <br/>
<br/>

The movie Twister with Helen Hunt has a drive in scene. I also remember a<br/>
movie with Roy Scheider where his girlfriend is being chased around a drive<br/>
in theater during the day in a car. I think that movie was Blue Thunder but<br/>
not sure.<br/>

Okay, cool.<br/>
and The Outsiders<br/>
and<br/>
Grease?<br/>
<br/>
Red Dawn has a drive-in theater, but they&#39;re not watching movies, it&#39;s being <br/>
used as a prisoner of war camp.  I think they used the theater in Las Vegas, <br/>
New Mexico, which was on that list!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A very fun site!  In the same vein as the drive in site, there is also a site about vintage <br/>
tv.  If you like the drive in site then you might also like this one;<br/>
 <br/>
Tvparty.com<br/>
<br/>
I actually paid the $8 to gain access to all of the video clips.  It&#39;s definately a trip <br/>
down memory lane.  Romper Room, HR Puff &#39;n Stuff, Johnny Jupiter, The <br/>
Thunderbirds, Clutch Cargo and lots lots more.  Broadband is definitely advisable.  <br/>
And it&#39;s not just videos, they have great stories about behind the sceens stuff too.  <br/>
 <br/>
Did any of you happen to get the page; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://driveintheater.com/security3.htm">http://driveintheater.com/security3.htm</a>  at <br/>
the drive in site?  Talk about urban legends! &lt;g&gt;  &#39;Tis very funny!  <br/>
