<div id="ygrps-yiv-745134604">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here and have been lurking for a short time. In the midst of all of <br/>
the TCS posting someone mentioned chores. This is something my family has <br/>
been struggling with for a while now and I would love to hear how you all <br/>
handle this area. My children are 15, 13 and 11.<br/>
<br/>
We have always felt that they live in and use the house as much as we do <br/>
and have a responsibility to pitch in and help keep it somewhat clean. <br/>
While this seems like a reasonable theory to me it&#39;s nothing but a battle <br/>
in reality. Housework is not high on our list of favorite things to do but <br/>
there are things in life that have to be done whether we like them or not. <br/>
If there is a way to make cleaning the toilet fun please let me know! :-) <br/>
Our goals are not to have well trained little maids running around picking <br/>
up after us but to help out because it is everyone&#39;s responsibility. If one <br/>
of them is supposed to do the dishes so their dad can make dinner when he <br/>
gets home then it would be considerate if they were done. Obviously we are <br/>
doing something wrong because this isn&#39;t happening. Any suggestions and <br/>
thoughts would be great and if you need any more details from me just ask.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
Lisa</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have always felt that they live in and use the house as much as we do<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fostering an atmosphere of teamwork is good. But are forced chores the only<br/>
route to that?<br/>
<br/>
Is a goal of everyone pitching in with an amount of work that feels<br/>
sufficient to the adults the same as an atmosphere of teamwork?<br/>
<br/>
What if, to fulfill a dream he&#39;d never discussed with you, your husband<br/>
bought a new house way out in the middle of no where that had no<br/>
electricity, no running water, no conveniences and decided you would live<br/>
there with him. Would it be then your responsibility to pitch in and help<br/>
him live the life he&#39;d chosen for the two of you? Or would it look like some<br/>
bizarre power trip?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that kind of the deal that kids get? They didn&#39;t get to choose which<br/>
families to be born into. They didn&#39;t get to say &quot;I love a sense of order so<br/>
I want that house where the toys are never to be left out past 5PM.&quot; ;-)<br/>
*We* chose to bring them into the world, into the lifestyle and standards we<br/>
choose to keep. We may have chosen a big back yard for them but do they then<br/>
inherit the responsibility for our gift to them? Isn&#39;t everything we provide<br/>
our gift to them? We are providing a life that *we* want to give to them:<br/>
the size of the house, the number and type of meals, the separate bedrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe *they&#39;d* prefer everyone slept in the same room so what kind of gift<br/>
have we really given? Why should we assume they even want what we are giving<br/>
them? Just because it&#39;s a gift *we* would like to be given, do they then<br/>
become obligated to appreciate it just because we worked so hard to get it<br/>
for them? And why do we attach strings to our gifts?<br/>
<br/>
We could say, &quot;Tough, that&#39;s just how life is,&quot; but isn&#39;t that just one of<br/>
those things people say when they want to force someone else to do what they<br/>
want them to do?<br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t a way of saying parents should become the servants of children.<br/>
It&#39;s just a way of viewing the situation from the kids&#39; point of view.<br/>
<br/>
If we say they have a responsibility, do they also have equal say in how the<br/>
house is kept? If they don&#39;t like mowing the lawn, could they choose to turn<br/>
it into a meadow? If they prefer to have their projects spread out in front<br/>
of the TV is that preference treated equally with adult preference to have<br/>
them cleaned up?<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean the kid preferences should supercede the adult<br/>
preferences, but if two adults had different preferences would the way of<br/>
resolving the conflict be for one adult to assert power and force over the<br/>
other adult to make the second adult do what the first wanted? (Well, yeah,<br/>
and we call it war! Or slavery.)<br/>
<br/>
By insisting that the only right way is the adult way, and because I&#39;m right<br/>
I then get to force you to do it my way, aren&#39;t we essentially saying<br/>
through our actions -- since the more strongly we feel we&#39;re right the less<br/>
likely we are to find any other method of resolive the conflict -- that the<br/>
best way to solve differences of opinion is by being the bigger, stronger,<br/>
more forceful one? Aren&#39;t we robbing them of the opportunity to see real<br/>
problem solving in action, resolving conflicts over things we really care<br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; While this seems like a reasonable theory to me it&#39;s nothing but a battle<br/>
&gt; in reality.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And when you step back and look at it objectively as one side setting the<br/>
standards, setting how to meet those standards and enforcing them, should it<br/>
be any other way?<br/>
<br/>
What if the kids set the standards and insisted you should comply with their<br/>
standards and how to meet those standards?<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband decided he didn&#39;t like seeing the food processor that<br/>
you use everyday sitting out on the counter and insisted you needed to take<br/>
it out and put it away for every use. And the only place it fit was on a<br/>
high shelf you needed to get the step ladder for? What if he insisted the<br/>
garage floor needed scrubbed by hand once a week?<br/>
<br/>
Those sound ridiculous, and yet the standards we set are just as ridiculous<br/>
from kid points of view. Kids don&#39;t care if the toilet is clean or the beds<br/>
are made or they have to wade through a floor full of toys. From their point<br/>
of view it&#39;s ridiculous to put away things that they&#39;re just going to take<br/>
out tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Housework is not high on our list of favorite things to do<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could put on lively music. You could put on show tunes and sing. You<br/>
could put a book on tape on. That won&#39;t *turn* it into fun. But we choose<br/>
what attitudes we bring to whatever we&#39;re doing. We can choose to be less<br/>
grumpy about housework.<br/>
<br/>
You can also see what can be done to simplify the tasks. Like rather than<br/>
having one laundry basket, have one for each child. That way the clothes are<br/>
already sorted. Someone had their house set up so all the clothes were<br/>
stored in the laundry room. Brainstorm wild ideas at home. Bring some here<br/>
and brainstorm.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s real easy to say no, such and such won&#39;t work because it&#39;s real easy to<br/>
get trapped by the boxes we live in without even realizing the boxes are<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but <br/>
&gt; there are things in life that have to be done whether we like them or not.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that really true? Can you name anything that you *have* to do whether you<br/>
like it or not? Give it a try :-)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t we *choose* to do those things because we prefer the onerous task to<br/>
the even more onerous consequences of not doing it?<br/>
<br/>
People often equate the responsibility of kids going to school with adults<br/>
going to work. But the *huge* difference is that the adults chose the type<br/>
of work they would do, chose the place of business they&#39;d work at, could<br/>
choose at any time to go work somewhere else or even stop working and live<br/>
off savings. Kids have *none* of that.<br/>
<br/>
I think we get a shift in outlook when we realize that *everything* we do is<br/>
a choice. There is no have to except dying. Not even paying taxes is a have<br/>
to. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If there is a way to make cleaning the toilet fun please let me know! :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I do is while I&#39;m waiting that minute for the water to heat up for my<br/>
shower I grab the spray bottle of cleaner and a paper towel and clean one<br/>
*small* portion of the bathroom, like just the spot between the seat and the<br/>
tank, *or* the spot on the floor to the right of *or* left of *or* behind<br/>
the toilet, *or* just the rim, *or* just the track for the shower doors *or*<br/>
whatever else is a bit dirty.<br/>
<br/>
I also wipe down a *small* portion of the shower afterwards with Soft Scrub,<br/>
let it dry and wipe it off later. (I have one of those shower hose<br/>
attachments to make rinsing lots easier.) (The waiting part probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t work if there are lots of people in the house using the shower so<br/>
I&#39;d just skip the drying and just wipe.)<br/>
<br/>
The bathroom is never entirely clean but it also never gets to the state<br/>
where I&#39;d suggest drop in guests might prefer to use the washroom at the gas<br/>
station down the street. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Admittedly that doesn&#39;t take care of the inside of the toilet, but it makes<br/>
it less onerous if it&#39;s not the toilet *and* everything else too. So the<br/>
only other toilet tip is to get one of those toilet brushes that stores in<br/>
the container that flips closed when you stand the brush up in it so you<br/>
never have to deal with the drippy disgusting thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If one <br/>
&gt; of them is supposed to do the dishes so their dad can make dinner when he<br/>
&gt; gets home then it would be considerate if they were done.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed something I do that should have been obvious. I&#39;d like to be<br/>
asleep by 9 (for various reasons). That doesn&#39;t have to be my daughter&#39;s<br/>
bedtime but she wants to be read to at night in bed. So if she&#39;s jumping on<br/>
the bed and running around at 9 -- which if I read to her then doesn&#39;t to<br/>
her qualify as reading in bed -- I&#39;m not going to have the light out at 9.<br/>
So I say essentially &quot;Please lay down. You say you want reading at night.<br/>
You said you&#39;d help me get to sleep by 9.&quot; But what I&#39;ve done  by saying<br/>
that is turn *her* into the problem. What I should say is &quot;Will you help me<br/>
get to bed by 9?&quot; and she becomes part of the solution.<br/>
<br/>
So you could say &quot;Can we help dad get dinner ready by getting these dishes<br/>
out of the way?&quot; Or you could talk to the kids and find ways other ways so<br/>
the dishes don&#39;t pile up and otherwise &quot;help dad get dinner read&quot;. Or<br/>
creative ways that the task could get done much quicker (like different bins<br/>
for different dishes -- glasses all in one -- so more kids could help). Or<br/>
if you do it with them, it could be a special time one on one with a child<br/>
to talk about things. Make them part of the solution instead of part of the<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
It also helps if you appreciate what help they give rather than pointing out<br/>
that they didn&#39;t meet your standards of enough.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t happen instantaneously. If you ask for help, they will hear<br/>
commands because they&#39;ve always heard commands. And for a while they will<br/>
take the freedom to say no, to literally say no. But if they do feel like<br/>
they&#39;re equal partners in the endeavor, and the help they give is<br/>
appreciated, they will come around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409149293">We sat down and worked out a chart with daily jobs, weekly jobs and <br/>
onetime jobs and extra spaces to fill in jobs not on the list.  That <br/>
was last september and the list has gotten tweaked several times <br/>
since.  I printed a new page weekly and the kids filled in their names <br/>
when they finished something.  This functioned really well though the <br/>
winter.  They take turns with some jobs and it was good way to keep <br/>
track of whose turn it was.  A lot of the reason it worked so well was <br/>
because one glance at the list showed who was or wasn&#39;t helping out.<br/>
<br/>
But, now that it is spring, I think things are going to have to <br/>
change.  Rachel does a lot of the outside garden stuff, so she really <br/>
doesn&#39;t have time for the inside stuff.  We are going to have to work <br/>
out a new list, but I&#39;m not sure how it will turn out.<br/>
<br/>
On the dishes issue, one thing we did was just not cook if the kitchen <br/>
was too far gone.  They got tired of not having dinner after a while <br/>
and it got better.  They got tired of warmedup freezer food after a <br/>
while.  Or someone would decide they wanted to bake and had to clean <br/>
to do it.  Now they all help keep in down to a reasonable level af <br/>
disarray.<br/>
