<div id="ygrps-yiv-477078265">I&#39;d &#39;second&#39; that, Pam. While both books are great reads, Real Lives <br/>
is easier to &#39;put yourself in their shoes&#39; and imagine *your* own <br/>
child doing this or that. TLH is more of a &#39;this is why it works&#39; <br/>
book. <br/>
Also, there&#39;s Dan Riley&#39;s School for a Girl!<br/>
And while we&#39;re talking about books, I&#39;d add to the list:<br/>
*We Took To the Woods by Louise Rich<br/>
*Punished By Rewards by Alfie Kohn<br/>
*Into the Forest by Jean Hegland<br/>
Sarah Carothers <br/>
