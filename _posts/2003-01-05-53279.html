<div id="ygrps-yiv-1883505709">Used XBOX game controller in good condition.  Reasonably priced.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, thanks for all the input.  You guys were right,  Just being <br/>
without the game today has made Ethan miserable.. He&#39;s mad at himself and <br/>
frustrated because he lost his temper.  He has had to share with JP on the <br/>
Nintendo 64.  I really am going to be looking for a used one in good shape.. <br/>
WIsh me luck, if I dont find one tomorrow.... Then its Wal-mart, here we <br/>
come.   And, next weekend&#39;s movie day will have to be foregone.  OH. btw, we <br/>
go to the $2 matinee, so we dont drop  a wad at the movies.. We&#39;re GREAT <br/>
bargain hunters. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

matinees.  <br/>
