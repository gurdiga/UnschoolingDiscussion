&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2867<br/>
&gt;Date: Tue, Jan 14, 2003, 10:41 AM<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I was wondering, do all of you who let your children eat<br/>
&gt; whatever they want have concerns for their childrens&#39; weight? And I am<br/>
&gt; not talking from a societal view, but a health view.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has been fascinating to me to watch my two daughters grow up.<br/>
<br/>
Brit is built like me and is growing up like I did -- tall, thin. I didn&#39;t<br/>
gain any weight no matter what I ate until I was in my 20s. Now I&#39;m a hefty<br/>
Amazon-woman &lt;g&gt; but I swear I was a stick until 24 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey is built like Wally&#39;s sisters -- they&#39;re short and she&#39;s tall, but I<br/>
don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be as tall as Brit, and she&#39;s just rounder all over.<br/>
She&#39;ll have actual curves as a teenager, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Neither one is fat. Brit was a huge baby and toddler -- born at 11.5 pounds,<br/>
off the charts for height and weight forever. Now, at 8, she&#39;s tall and thin<br/>
-- a perfect child&#39;s size 10. She looks like a kid model in jeans. Mikey was<br/>
a big baby and toddler, but nothing to compare with Brit, but looks<br/>
definitely &quot;fatter&quot; compared to her sister.<br/>
<br/>
They both run around inside and out like wild lunatic heathens at least<br/>
several times per day. &lt;g&gt; I don&#39;t ask them to exercise, and since we&#39;re in<br/>
a townhouse and share a wall with a very kind elderly neighbor, I even ask<br/>
them NOT to race around after 10 p.m. ;) They seem to have worked out their<br/>
own exercise needs. I&#39;m sure it helps that we live in California where the<br/>
weather is good enough to be outside even on most winter days.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; what if you guys are right?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is the very thing that wouldn&#39;t let me quit thinking about total, <br/>
radical unschooling.<br/>
I kept getting flustered at all  these things people were saying, it just <br/>
couldn&#39;t work! Or could it? <br/>
I mean it was working for THEM, maybe it really did work?<br/>
Oh how the brain cells just couldn&#39;t leave it alone until I fully grasped it, <br/>
and what an eye opener it was!!<br/>
Cook thing is, they WERE right.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Oh I am definitely with you on this one. Living in Florida, I can&#39;t <br/>
 understand why in heavens name they come out with major winter stuff here in <br/>
 Sept. It&#39;s hot until at least Nov. And now when we have some cool weather, <br/>
 our Target has out bathing suits. What is up with that???? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I SO agree.<br/>
We don&#39;t even ever need some of the clothes they sell here, who buys them?<br/>
We seem to be on the same retail cycle as the rest of the nation, and it <br/>
makes zero sense!!!<br/>

You know what really makes me nuts? At Halloween year before last, Alyssa <br/>
had just turned one. The only costumes were these huge snowsuit looking fur <br/>
things. How can I send out my kid in that when it&#39;s 85 out at night? <br/>
Everything for little ones here were those things. Cute as heck, but only if <br/>
you&#39;re up north.<br/>
