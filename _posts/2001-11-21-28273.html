<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961280230">And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.<br/>
And he said:<br/>
Your children are not your children.<br/>
They are the sons and daughters of Life&#39;s longing for itself.<br/>
They come through you but not from you,<br/>
And though they are with you yet they belong no to you.<br/>
<br/>
You may give them your love but not your thoughts,<br/>
For they have their own thoughts.<br/>
You may house their bodies but not their souls,<br/>
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, <br/>
not even in your dreams.<br/>
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.<br/>
<br/>
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.<br/>
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.<br/>
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you <br/>
with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.<br/>
Let your bending in the Archer&#39;s hand be for gladness;<br/>
For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He also loves the bow that <br/>
is stable.<br/>
<br/>
From: The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran<br/>

Thanks again....<br/>

Sweet Honey and the Rock sing it on a Music for Little<br/>

their own CD&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
