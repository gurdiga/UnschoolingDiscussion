I was more wanting to understand if there was a place you go, or game <br/>
you play or some kind of strategy other than buying them. I guess just <br/>
wondering is there something you have to do to get them.  I have the <br/>
same trouble with the dabloons, and nerkmid coins etc.  I just don&#39;t <br/>
understand it all yet.  We have only been playing for a few months.  <br/>
Since Aug/Sept I think.  Maybe these are just things you learn in time <br/>
from playing and looking around. Thanks!<br/>
