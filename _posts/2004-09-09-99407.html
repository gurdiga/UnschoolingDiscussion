&lt;&lt; This time, instead of water, the balloon contained a magnetic ball. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never put a magnet in a balloon.<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea!<br/>
<br/>
Did he think it up or did you or where&#39;d you get that idea?<br/>
<br/>
Funny, that I never thought of putting anything in a balloon (well I&#39;ve put <br/>
air, and helium, and water, and considered and rejected the idea of paint &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

The kids said it was dh who first did that--I would&#39;ve gladly<br/>
attributed it to them, though! *g* Dh is a scientist, though, so maybe<br/>
I should give him a bit of credit; he does come up with some fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
He brought home dry ice from the lab a couple weeks ago, which was<br/>
loads of fun. Most folks would watch it sublime (all the gas coming<br/>
off); he put it in water, which increased all the gas, but then also<br/>
put some in water with a few drops of dish washing liquid. Whoa!<br/>
Totally cool! It started blowing crazy bubbles! There&#39;s a picture of<br/>
the kids watching it at my Science page:<br/>
