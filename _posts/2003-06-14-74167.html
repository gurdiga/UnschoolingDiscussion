&gt; &quot;that <br/>

 </span></blockquote>OH, that is sooo cool!   I know exactly what my husband would LOVE to get for <br/>
an occasion like an anniversary.. Heck, he wouldnt even need an occasion for <br/>
it.. LOL..  PIERCINGS!<br/>
<br/>
Can you believe it?  I just can not bear the thoughts of getting some tender <br/>
spot pierced.. YOWWEEEE.. But when I countered that I would never do it unless <br/>
he did it too, he eagerly agreed he would!.. Opps.. BACKFIRE!.. .. Well, I <br/>
just cant get &quot;that&quot; pierced.. even if he gets &quot;his&quot; pierced too.  Now, a tatoo, <br/>
I could go for.   Something small and classy, an intimate &quot;brand&quot; on your <br/>
body to symbolize your love for each other.. Swoon, how romantic.   .. OH OH.. <br/>
that reminds me of a joke.. <br/>
<br/>
OK.. this happened to my Mom, she is 60, but a very cool 60 yo..  She was at <br/>
work and a two younger co-workers, Pat and Lisa, motioned for her to come into <br/>
a backroom.   Pat said excitedly.&quot; Hey. look at Lisa&#39;s new tatoo&quot;  Lisa has <br/>
several tatoos, but mom thought she had seen them all.. She said &quot;I already saw <br/>
it, didnt I?<br/>
<br/>
Pat- &quot;no no, its a new one, she just got it.. here, look at it..<br/>
<br/>
Lisa pulls her pants down to about her pubic region, and turns to display her <br/>
hip.<br/>
<br/>
Lisa- See, see it.. there it is<br/>
<br/>
Mom, looking closer.-  No, I dont see it.. I dont see anything.<br/>
<br/>
Pat- Its there , I saw it.. dont you see it&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mom- No, I dont see anything, what is it, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Lisa- Its a mouse, a small mouse, are you sure its not there?<br/>
<br/>
Mom- No, there is no mouse back there, its not there!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa- twisting around to look at her backside-  DAMN, my pussy must have ate <br/>
it.!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LMAO.. I swear that was so funny.   Mom bout died laughing.  Another <br/>
&quot;prudish&quot; co-worker looked into the room.. &quot;Whats going on in here?&quot;  The ladies just <br/>
stifled thier laughs and said somebody told a joke.   <br/>
<br/>
Hey, Pam, maybe Jackson can get a mouse tattoed somewhere down below.. LOL.. <br/>
OK .. Im getting silly now :-)<br/>

Cute. I&#39;ll have to keep that in mind. My mom would fall for that but <br/>
as it is she wouldn&#39;t be all that shocked that i would get another. <br/>
Between my sisters and me, there&#39;s not much left for her to be <br/>
shocked about anymore. But I keep trying. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
