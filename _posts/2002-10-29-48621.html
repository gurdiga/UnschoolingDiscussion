<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994791118">&lt;&lt;I know a little girl who thought like that.  She ended up being sexually<br/>
active at a young age&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was, am a girl/woman who thinks like that.  I had sex at 19 and have only<br/>
slept with 2 men.  I really don&#39;t think you can blame every thing a kid does<br/>
or doesn&#39;t do on &quot;the parents&quot;.  The kid isn&#39;t some blank slate that simply<br/>
reacts to what goes on outside of him/her.  Kids think, feel and often act<br/>
from their *own* souls.<br/>

<br/>
To be perfectly honest, I&#39;m not real sure what I think about that. There was <br/>
a time when I felt like there were just bad kids and no matter how loving <br/>
and nurturing and &quot;right&quot; parents were, some kids just went bad on their <br/>
own. Now I&#39;m more on the side of yes, each one of us has our own way about <br/>
us but there is something that we as parents can do to make situations <br/>
better or worse. I certainly don&#39;t expect any kid to be perfect and make no <br/>
mistakes, no matter how good a parent is. But I&#39;m thinking that how kids do <br/>
turn out may have a very big part in how we parent. Not 100 % sure on this <br/>
though.<br/>

Well I know I&#39;ve enjoyed blaming my parents all these years and I don&#39;t<br/>
intend to stop now!!&lt;G&gt;<br/>

There ARE definitely genetic factors, and factors still being discovered <br/>
about pre-natal conditions.<br/>
<br/>
Sex shouldn&#39;t always be automatically considered &quot;a mistake,&quot; I don&#39;t think.<br/>

Clarifying: I agree with the genetic part and all. And the mistakes I was <br/>
referring to was just to mean in general. Not meaning sex was a mistake, <br/>
although it could be at times. Just general I&#39;m not perfect stuff.<br/>
